geodesic sprays and frozen metrics in rheonomic lagrange manifolds steen markvorsen abstract we define systems of pre extremals for the energy functional of regular rheonomic lagrange manifolds and show how they induce well defined hamilton orthogonal nets such nets have applications in the modelling of e g wildfire spread under time and space dependent conditions the time function inher ited from such a hamilton net induces in turn a time independent finsler metric we call it the associated frozen metric it is sim ply obtained by inserting the time function from the net into the given lagrangean the energy pre extremals then become ordi nary finsler geodesics of the frozen metric and the hamilton or thogonality property is preserved during the freeze we compare our results with previous findings of g w richards concerning his application of huyghens principle to establish the pde system for hamilton orthogonal nets in 2 d randers spaces and also concern ing his explicit spray solutions for time only dependent randers spaces we analyze examples of time dependent 2 d randers spaces with simple yet non trivial zermelo data we obtain analytic and numerical solutions to their respective energy pre extremal equa tions and we display details of the resulting frozen hamilton orthogonal nets 1 introduction a large number of natural phenomena evolve under highly non isotropic and time varying conditions the spread of wildfires is but one such phenomenon see 9 the concept of a regular rheonomic lagrange manifold m l offers a natural global geometric setting for an initial study of such phenomena the anisotropy as well as the time and space dependency is represented by a time dependent finsler met ric f with l f 2 as a further structural ansatz for the phenom ena under consideration we will assume that they are driven in this finsler metric background as wave frontals issuing from a given initial base hypersurface n in m with f unit speed rays which all leave n orthogonally w r t the metric f huyghens principle then implies that the rays are everywhere what we call hamilton orthogonal to the 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 53 58 key

hamilton orthogonality for the special 2 d finsler manifolds known as 2 d randers spaces represented by their so called zermelo data our main result is that in general i e for any regular lagrangean and under the structural ansatz above hamilton orthogonality is equiva lent to the condition that all the rays of the spread phenomenon are energy pre extremals for the given lagrangean the first order pde system for hamilton orthogonality is thus equivalent to a second order ode system for these pre extremals the spread problem is in this way solvable via the rays which then together side by side mold the frontals of the spread phenomenon as a corollary which may be of interest in its own right we also show the following if we freeze the metric f to the specific functional value that it has at a given point precisely when the frontal of the given spread passes through this point then we obtain a frozen time independent finsler metric f in which the given rays are f geodesics which mold the same frontals as before these frozen metrics are highly dependent on both the base hypersurface n and on the time of ignition from n as already alluded to in the abstract we illustrate and support these main results by explicit calculations for simple 2 d time dependent ran ders metrics and we display various details from the corresponding point ignited spread phenomena 1 1 outline of paper in section 2 we describe the concept of a regular rheonomic lagrange manifold and introduce the correspond ing time dependent indicatrix field for any given variation of a given curve the corresponding l energy and f length for unit speed curves is differentiated with respect to the variation parameter in section 3 and the ensuing extremal equations are displayed the notion of a unit fiber net is introduced in section 4 as a background for the presen tation of the main results in sections 5 and 6 concerning the equivalence of hamilton orthogonality and energy pre extremal rays and concern ing the frozen metrics as mentioned in the introduction above the rheonomic randers spaces and their equivalent zermelo data are con sidered in section 7 with the purpose of presenting richards results and the promised examples in section 8 frozen finsler metrics 3 2 rheonomic lagrange manifolds a regular rheonomic lagrange space mn l is a smooth manifold m with a time dependent lagrangean l modelled on a time dependent finsler metric f i e l f 2 see e g 4 1 10 8 and 14 the metric f induces for each time t in a given time interval a smooth family of minkowski norms in the tangent spaces of m for the transparency of this work we shall be mainly interested in two dimensional cases and examples correspondingly we write with m r 2 p u v u 1 u 2 and v x y x 1 x 2 tpr 2 span u v 2 1 f ft f t p f t p v f t u v x y f t u 1 u 2 x 1 x 2 where the latter index notation is primarily used here for expressions involving general summation over repeated indices the higher dimen sional cases are easily obtained by extending the indices beyond 2 like p u 1 un and v x 1 xn tpm by definition see 13 and 6 a finsler metric on a domain u is a smooth family of minkowski norms on the tangent planes i e a smooth family of indicatrix templates which at each time t in each tangent plane tp u at the respective points p u v in the parameter domain u is determined by the nonnegative smooth function ft of t as follows 1 ft is smooth on each punctured tangent plane tp u 0 0 2 ft is positively homogeneous of degree one ft kv kft v for every v tp u and every k 0 3 the following bilinear symmetric form on the tangent plane is positive definite 2 2 gt p v u w 1 2 2 f 2 t v u w 0 since the function ft is homogenous of degree 1 the fundamental metric gt p v u w satisfies the following for each time t gt p v v w 1 2 f 2 t v w 0 2 3 gt p v v v f 2 t v v 2 ft 2 4 suppose that we use the canonical basis u b 1 v b 2 in tp u and let v xibi then we can define coordinates of g gt

t xixj is shorthand for the double derivatives of f 2 t with respect to the tangent plane coordinates xi in the following we shall need other partial derivatives of f 2 t such as f 2 t t v f 2 t uk v and f 2 t ulxk v as well as the inverse matrix of gij v which are now all well defined e g 2 9 gij v gij v 1 and gij v gkj v 1 0 0 1 moreover the following second order informations are of well known and instrumental importance for the study of finsler manifolds and lagrangean geometry see 13 6 3 and 14 2 10 gi y 1 4 gi l y f 2 t xk yl y yk f 2 t xl y n i 0 y 1 2 gi l y f 2 t t yl y definition 2 1 the set of points in the tangent plane tp u which have ft unit position vectors is called the instantaneous indicatrix of ft at p 2 11 it p f 1 t 1 v tp u f t p v 1 since gt p v is positive definite every indicatrix it p is automatically strongly convex in its tangent plane at p and it contains the origin of the tangent plane in its interior see 6 it is therefore a pointed oval the point being that origin of the tangent plane 3 variations of l energy and of f length since we shall be interested in particular aspects of the pre extremals of the energy functional in m l we briefly review the first variation of energy with special emphasis on the influence of the time dependence of the underlying metric in the following we suppress the indication of the time dependence and write f for ft the first variation formula will give the ode differential equation conditions for a curve to be an f 2 energy extremal in m the ode system for the extremals are of course nothing but the euler lagrange frozen finsler metrics 5 equations for the time dependent lagrange functional l see 1 3 5 3 6 and 2 we let c denote a candidate curve for an extremal of f 2 i e of l 3 1 c a b m this means that there is a partition of a b 3 2 a t 0 tm b such that c is smooth on each subinterval ti 1 ti for every i 1 m quad a variation of the curve c is then a piecewise smooth map 3 3 h a b m such that 3 4 h is continuous on a b h is smooth on each ti 1 ti h 0 t c t for all a t b the last equation in 3 4 states that c is the base curve in the family of curves cu t h u t which sweeps out the variation the variation h induces the associated variation vector field v t so that we have in local coordinates 3 5 h u 0 t v t v k t xk c t the f 2 energy values of the individual piecewise smooth curves cu t in the variation family h are then given by 3 6 e u b a l t cu t c u t dt b a f 2 t cu t c u t dt m i 1 ti ti 1 f 2 t cu t h t u t dt then we have the following u derivative of e u at u 0 we refer to 6 and apply the short hand notation presented in section 2 this calculation mimics almost verbatim the classical calculation in 13 with the difference however that our f field is now time dependent so that there will be an explicit extra term in the integrand below this extra term is precisely given by n i 0 y 6 steen markvorsen e 0 b a f 2 xk v k f 2 yk dv k dt dt b a f 2 xk d dt f 2 yk v k dt m i

and v denote a variation of a curve c as above then the energy functional on the given variation is 3 7 e c b a f 2 t cu t c u t dt with the following derivative 3 8 e 0 2 b a gj k c j 2 gj c n j 0 c

parametrized see 13 9 proposition 3 2 suppose again we conider the variational setting with h and v as above but now with base curve c satisfying the unit speed condition 3 9 c t f 1 for all t a b then the length functional on the given variation is 3 10 l c b a f t cu t c u t dt frozen finsler metrics 7 and it has the same expression for its derivative as the energy functional except for the factor 2 3 11 l 0 b a gj k c j 2 gj c n j 0 c v k dt m i 1 gj k c j v k ti ti 1 remark 3 3 we note that if the lagrange finsler metric f is actually time independent then the formulas 3 8 and 3 11 above are just modified by setting n j 0 c 0 4 unit fiber nets we first define a special class of nets in mn f as follows definition 4 1 let nn 1 be a smooth embedded orientable hyper surface in mn f with a well defined choice of normal vector field n at time t 0 i e n is everywhere orthogonal to n with respect to ft 0 and has unit length with respect to ft 0 an n t 0 based unit fiber net in mn f is a diffeomorphism 4 1 n t 0 t 7 u m with the property that each fiber s 0 t is a unit speed ray that leaves n orthogonally at time t 0 4 2 s t 0 s for all s n and t s t 0 n s for all s n and t s t 1 for all s n and all t t 0 t remark 4 2 the definition of an n t 0 based unit fiber net can easily be extended to submanifolds n of higher co dimension than 1 by fattening the submanifold to a sufficiently thin tube w r t ft 0 and then consider the boundary hypersurface of that tube instead we shall tacitly assume this construction for the cases illustrated explicitly below where n is a point p in which case the point in question should be fattened to a small sphere around p for example a p t 0 based unit fiber net in r 2 which corresponds to axis symmetric polar elliptic coordinates is then a parametrization of the following type s t p 1 t a cos s p 2 t b sin s t 0 s s 1 these specific nets appear naturally in constant randers metrics in r 2 with zermelo data a b c 0 and 0 see sections 7 and 8 below 4 1 huyghens principle a much celebrated and useful principle for obtaining a particular spray structure of an n t 0 based unit fiber net which is also our main concern in this work is huyghens prin ciple see 5 and 9 to state the principle together with one of its significant consequences we shall first introduce the time level sets of 8 steen markvorsen the given net for each t 1 t 0 t we define such a level in the usual way 4 3 t 1 p u t p t 1 definition 4 3 let s t denote an n t 0 based unit fiber net we will say that the net satisfies huyghens principle if the following holds true for all sufficiently small but nonzero time increments the time level set t 1 is obtained as the envelope of the set of p t 1 based unit fiber nets of duration t t 1 t 1 in u where p goes through all points in t 1 these p t 1 based unit fiber nets will be called huyghens droplets of duration from the level set t 1 see examples in figure 6 below the structural consequence of huyghens principle is then encoded into the following result see 5 theorem p 251 and compare 5 figure 196 concerning conjugate directions with figure 1 concerning the equivalent f orthogonal directions below theorem 4 4 let s t denote an n t 0 based unit fiber net which satisfies huyghens principle then the direction s s t 1 of the frontal t 1 at time t 1 and at a given point p on that frontal is f orthogonal to the direction t s t 1 of the ray s t through p i e 4 4 s s t ft t s t for all s n t t 0 t remark 4 5 the orthogonality obtained and expressed in 4 4 we will call hamilton orthogonality in fact the proof for hamilton or thogonality only needs an infinitesimal version of huyghens principle this specific consequence of huyghens principle was established for n t 0 based unit fiber nets in 2 d randers spaces by g w richards in 11 where the ensuing hamilton orthogonality is expressed directly in terms of a system of pde equations see theorem 8 1 in section 8 below remark 4 6 it is not clear if or under which additional conditions the converse to theorem 4 4 holds true i e if hamilton orthogonality for a given n t 0 based unit fiber net implies that the net and the background metric also satisfies huyghens principle the problem is that the metric f is in this generality time dependent so that e g the triangle inequality does not hold for the respective rays as we shall see below however the rays do solve an energy pre extremal problem and the rays are actually geodesics in the so called frozen metrics associated with f however these frozen metrics typically do not agree if the corresponding nets have different base hypersurfaces n nevertheless it is indicated by figure 6 in section 8 below that in suitable simplistic settings like the ones under consideration there the huyghens droplets from one frontal actually seem to envelope the next frontal in a corresponding increment of time frozen finsler metrics 9 figure 1 a typical elliptic indicatrix for a randers metric f at a given point for a given time the two vectors v and w are f orthogonal see section 7 below and 9 if f is time independent we do have the necessary triangle inequali ties at our disposal and in this case the converse to theorem 4 4 holds true as discussed in 9 5 main results we now show that the hamilton orthogonality defined above is equiv alent to a system of ode equations for the rays of the net in question theorem 5 1 suppose s t is an n t 0 based unit fiber net in m then the following two conditions for are equivalent a the energy pre extremal condition 5 1 s t t s t j j t s t 2 g j t s t n j 0 t s t j for some function of s n and t t 0 t and b the hamilton orthogonality condition 5 2 s s t ft t s t for all s n t t 0 t definition 5 2 the unit fiber net satisfying one hence both of the conditions 5 2 and 5 1 is called the n t 0 based wf net in m l before proving the theorem we first observe that standard ode theory gives existence and uniqueness of a net s t which satisfies the equations 5 1 and 5 2 10 steen markvorsen proposition 5 3 suppose n does not curve too much in the direction of its n field at time t 0 i e the hypersurface n has bounded second fundamental form in m with respect to ft 0 then there exists a unique n t 0 based wf net s t for t t 0 t for sufficiently small t remark 5 4 the rays of a wf net are usually not extremals for the l energy because s t 0 is ususally not compatible with the unit speed condition in 4 2 in definition 4 1 moreover it is important to note that a given n t 0 based wf net may be quite different from an n t 1 based wf net for different initial times t 0 and t 1 see example 8 4 proof of theorem 5 1 for transparency and mostly in order to relate directly to the key 2 d examples that we display below we will assume that m r 2 i e m is identical to its chart with coordinates u v in r 2 this is done without much lack of generality since in the general setting we are only concerned with the semi local aspects of the n based nets in question moreover the expressions and arguments in this proof generalize easily to higher dimensions suppose first that the net satisfies 5 1 since each ray in the net by assumption has unit f speed the specific variation v s determined by the rays in the net will give l 0 for all values of b in the variational formula 3 11 because each ray in the variation has constant length 5 3 0 l 0 b t 0 gj k c j 2 gj c n j 0 c v k dt m i 1 gj k c j v k ti ti 1 since also by assumption 5 4 c j 2 gj c n j 0 c t c j for some function we get for all b t 0 t 5 5 0 b t 0 m t t dt m b where m is shorthand for 5 6 m t gj k c j t v k t by assumption on the net we have m t 0 0 and from 5 5 we get upon differentiation with respect to b 5 7 m b m b b for all b t 0 t it follows that m t 0 for all t and therefore by 5 6 the variation vector field v t s s t is f orthogonal to c j t j t s t hence the net also satisfies equation 5 2 frozen finsler metrics 11 conversely suppose that s t satisfies 5 2 again we let v denote any net induced variation vector field along a given base ray s 0 t c t which again satisfies the following equation for all b since v is assumed to be f orthogonal to c 5 8 0 l 0 b t 0 gj k c j 2 gj c n j 0 c v k dt since the integrand is thence identically 0 the vector 5 9 j c j 2 gj c n j 0 c j is f orthogonal to the variation field v and hence parallel to c t t it follows that the given net satisfying 5 2 also satisfies 5 1 remark 5 5 we note en passant that if the lagrangean l is time independent i e if m l is a so called regular scleronomic lagrangean manifold then f is also time independent and the rays of any wf net in m l are geodesics for the metric f indeed in this case the wf net condition 5 1 is precisely that the rays are pre geodesics of con stant f speed 1 hence they are geodesics 6 frozen finsler metrics definition 6 1 let s t denote an n t 0 based wf net in m f with the image u n t 0 t then the frozen finsler metric f on u m is defined as the following time independent scleronomic finsler metric 6 1 f u v x y f t u v u v x y for all u v u the metric f is called the frozen metric associated to f induced by the n t 0 based wf net we show that the rays of a wf net are geodesics of the frozen metric theorem 6 2 let s t denote an n t 0 based wf net in m l with associated frozen metric f in the domain u then the rays s 0 t of are geodesic curves of f so that the given wf net in m l is also a wf net in m f proof this follows immediately from the fact that the given wf net of f is also a wf net of f since the hamilton orthogonality conditions are locally the same with respect to both metrics in the net which itself coordinates the freeze of f to f we now obtain the same result from the respective first variation formulas which is not surprising in view of their role in the establisment 12 steen markvorsen above of theorem 5 1 the freezing time function t t u v has partial derivatives which satisfy 6 2 1 t u u t t v v t moreover since the gradient of t in the euclidean coordinate domain r 2 is euclidean orthogonal to the frontal 6 3 t 1 u v u t u v t 1 we have 6 4 0 t u w 1 u 0 v 0 t v w 2 u 0 v 0 for any vector w t u 0 v 0 u which is tangent to the level set t 0 in r 2 in consequence we have for each vector w which is f orthogonal to and therefore tangent to the t 0 level 6 5 gj k f 2 t t ul gj lw k t uk w k 0 since s t is a hamilton orthogonal net equation 6 5 means that the vector with coordinates gj i f 2 t t ui is proportional to the chain rule implies 6 6 f

frozen finsler metrics 13 so that j j 2 g j j is also proportional to t hence is a pre geodesic curve with respect to f since the length of t is constrained to 1 by the wf net condition the curve must be a geodesic in the metric f see e g 6 exercise 5 3 2 7 rheonomic randers metrics in r 2 a rheonomic randers metric in m r 2 is represented by its in stantaneous elliptic indicatrix fields the representing ellipse field it p e t u v is parametrized as follows in the tangent space basis u v at u v in the parameter domain 7 1 e t u v r t u v a t u v cos b t u v sin c 1 t u v c 2 t u v where r t u v denotes the rotation in the tangent plane at u v by the angle t u v in the clock wise direction see figure 2 7 2 r t u v cos t u v sin t u v sin t u v cos t u v remark 7 1 the choice of orientation of turning in the clockwise direction is customary in the field of wildfires see 11 9 the translation vector c t u v c 1 t u v c 2 t u v must al ways be assumed to be sufficiently small so that the resulting rotated and translated ellipse contains the origin of the tangent plane of the parameter domain at the point u v i e so that the ellipse with its origin becomes a pointed oval in the sense of general finsler indicatri ces the time dependent finsler metric induced from time dependent zermelo data is now obtained as follows see 7 9 let h denote the riemannian metric with the following component matrix with re spect to the standard basis u v in every t u v r 2 7 3 h 1 a 2 b 2 a 2 sin 2 b 2 cos 2 a 2 b 2 sin cos a 2 b 2 sin cos a 2 cos 2 b 2 sin 2 for elliptic template fields the direct way to the finsler metric from the zermelo data is as follows suppose for example that we are given ellipse field data a t u v b t u v c t u v c 1 t u v c 2 t u v and t u v then the corresponding finsler metric f is determined by the following expression where v x y denotes any vector in t u v r 2 see e g 7 section 1 1 2 and 9 7 4 f ft f t p v f t u v x y h v v h 2 v c h v c 14 steen markvorsen where 7 5 1 h c c 0 8 richard s equations richards observed in 11 that huyghens principle for a spread phe nomenon in casu the spread of wildfires in the plane together with a background indicatrix field of zermelo type as discussed above forces the frontals of the spread to satisfy the pde system of differential equations in theorem 8 1 below theorem 8 1 we consider an n t

huyghens principle as by definition 4 3 then the net is determined by the following equations for the partial derivatives s s t u s v s and t s t u t v t where now as indicated above the control coefficients a b c 1 c 2 and are all allowed to depend on both time t and position u v u t a 2 cos u s sin v s cos b 2 sin u s cos v s sin a 2 u s sin v s cos 2 b 2 u s cos v s sin 2 c 1 cos c 2 sin

are assumed to depend only on time t and not on the position u v richards was able to find the following explicit analytic solution to the equations in theorem 8 1 see 12 section 4 1 theorem 8 2 for a rheonomic 2 d randers metric in r 2 with no spatial dependence the solution to the equations in theorem 8 1 are given by the following expressions for s t u s t v s t with u 0 v 0 u 0 v 0 u s t u 0 t 0 f r dr t 0 c 2 r sin r c 1 r cos r dr where f r a 2 r cos r cos r s b 2 r sin r sin r s a 2 r cos 2 r s b 2 r sin 2 r s and v s t v 0 t 0 g r dr t 0 c 2 r cos r c 1 r sin r dr frozen finsler metrics 15 where g r a 2 r sin r cos r s b 2 r cos r sin r s a 2 r cos 2 r s b 2 r sin 2 r s remark 8 3 the solutions presented in theorem 8 2 and indirectly in theorem 8 1 can be shown directly to satisfy the unit f speed condition and the hamilton orthogonality condition needed to form p 0 based wf nets with p u 0 v 0 we illustrate the construction of a frozen metric in a most simple example using the following rheonomic metric example 8 4 in u r 2 we consider the time dependent riemannian metric for all t 0 8 1 f t u v x y f t u 1 u 2 x 1 x 2 x 2 y 2 2 1 t the corresponding zermelo data are clearly the following 8 2 a t u v 1 t b t u v 2 2 t c t u v 0 0 t u v 0 for the rheonomic metric f we then have the following ingredients for the energy extremals and for the wf ray equations 8 3 f 2

then the two wf net solutions 8 13 and 8 8 do agree now in comparison we may consider instead the wf net geodesics obtained by starting at 0 0 at the later time t 0 1 in the same rheonomic metric f as above a calculation along the same lines as above now gives the new time function 8 15 t t u v 1 4 4 u 2 v 2 insertion of this new time function into the given rheonomic metric f now gives the new

curves of the frozen metric are the same straight line curves as before only now with a reparametrization in the t direction observe that the new parametrization t 2 2 t 3 is not simply obtained by inserting t 1 in place of t in the old parametrization t 2 2 t the 18 steen markvorsen frozen metric is clearly different with an extra 4 in the denominator square root two somewhat more complicated examples of rheonomic metrics in r 2 are considered in the next example example 8 5 we present two simple cases of time dependent randers metrics in r 2 their respective time dependent indicatrix fields are indicated in figures 2 and 3 the zermelo data for figure 2 are as follows 8 18 a t u v 1 b t u v 2 t 5 c t u v 0 0 t u v t 5 u v 20 the zermelo data for figure 3 which depend on time only are the same as for figure 2 except that the u and v dependence has been removed from the rotation angle so that 8 19 a t u v 1 b t u v 2 t 5 c t u v 0 0 t u v t 5 20 figure 2 the indicatrix field from the zermelo data in 8 18 at three different times t 0 t 8 and t 16 from left to right the spatial dependence is determined solely via the zermelo rotation angle t u v in 8 18 for these two relatively simple fields we obtain via numerical so lutions the p 0 based wf nets displayed in the figures 4 and 5 respectively with ignition at point p 0 0 at time t 0 the displayed frontals are then obtained at time values ti 0 2 16 i frozen finsler metrics 19 figure 3 the indicatrix field from the zermelo data in 8 19 at three different times t 0 t 8 and t 16 from left to right the field is clearly spatially constant in each time slice where i 1 5 so that the outermost frontal is the time level set t 5 16 in figure 6 is shown also the two sets of huyghens droplets of duration 0 2 16 ignited from points on the two respective level sets t 4 at the corresponding time t 4 in the two cases under consideration the huyghens droplets clearly show a tendency to envelope the outer frontal
