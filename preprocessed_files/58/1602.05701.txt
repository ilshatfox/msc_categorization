abs 1602 05701 v 2 8 notation and subject index 57 1 introduction the celebrated work of donaldson thomas 13 has inspired extensive studies on special holonomy on a seven dimensional manifoldm with a g 2 structure for a vector bundle e m it s suggested in 13 to consider theg 2 instanton equation of connections on e fa 0 1 where is the co associative form uniquely determined by and fa is the curvature form of the connection a as pointed out in 13 the g 2 instantons should form a basis for a casson floer type theory for 7 manifolds by adding the torsion free g 2 structures as a parameter in 1 a very natural moduli space is the set of solutions a to 1 modulo gauge and some other natural equivalence according to the seminal paper of tian 35 it s expected that instantons with point singularities should appear in the natural compactification therefore a fundamental step to understand this moduli space and any related one is to study the following question given a g 2 instanton with point singularities can we still see the instan ton and the singularity for nearby g 2 structures the best story we can expect is that the singularity disappears by per turbing the g 2 structure on mean curvature flows by the work of colding minicozzi 6 this indeed happens any flow which develops singularity as shrinking donuts angenent 2 can be perturbed away however our fol lowing main result shows that this does not happen very often forg 2 instantons theorem 1 1 let e be an admissible bundle defined away from finitely many points oj on a 7 manifold with a g 2 structure suppose e admits an ad missible g 2 instanton with trivial co kernel then for any small enough ad missible deformation of the g 2 structure there exists a g 2 monopole with the same tangent connection at each oj remark 1 2 the above statement is not the most precise but we hope it is easy to understand the most precise version of theorem 1 1 is theorem 5 1 to which we strongly recommend the readers to pay attention we will only prove theorem 5 1 remark 1 3 in the rest of the article we call the points where e is undefined singular points please notice that our definition also includes the case when the bundle is smooth across some of or all the singularities and in this case we allow both singular and smooth connections nevertheless we are more interested in the case when the bundle connection 2 is truly singular when the bundle and connection are both smooth across a singular point our local right inverse of the linearised operator is still different from the standard one see 19 23 remark 1 4 when the g 2 form is co closed any g 2 monopole 140 on a closed manifold is an instanton however a locally defined one might not remark 1 5 theorem 1 of yang 37 and lemma 2 4 suggest that via a bun dle isomorphism and a smooth gauge away from the singularities any g 2 instanton on a singular bundle with quadratic curvature blowing up at each singular point can be reduced to the case in theorem 5 1 the work of tian 35 indicates that the tangent connections at the singularities are the cone con nections bundles on r 7 o pulled back from a smooth hermitian yang mills connection over s 6 with respect to the standard nearly ka hler structure via the spherical projection remark 2 5 the work of charbonneau harland 7 indicates that the deformation of these hermitian connections can be identified with a subspace of the kernel of a dirac operator remark 1 6 we expect the co kernel to be trivial for most singular instantons i e we have tranversality in most of the cases this is reasonable at least when the inner product is unweighted the instanton constructed by walpuski 34 is rigid and the self adjointness implies the co kernel is trivial the key to the deformation problem is a fredholm theory for the lin earised operator 13 it is a dirac operator i e the square of it is a laplacian in the model case though we can not do separation of variable to the deformation operator itself we can do it for the laplacian as the standard laplacian in polar coordinate we have a polar coordinate for mula for the laplacian of any cone connection lemma 3 1 using the galerkin method see 7 1 2 in 15 we can construct a local inverse for the laplacian and this gives a local inverse for the deformation operator between the desired weighted sobolev spaces to handle the non linearity of the instanton equation or to preserve the tangent cone a theory of sobolev spaces is not sufficient the spaces should satisfy some multiplicative properties therefore it should be helpful to turn on the a priori schauder estimates of douglis nirenberg theorem 1 in 14 nevertheless the essentially difficulty is the c 0 estimate our crucial observation is that the w 1 2 p b estimate of sufficiently neg ative p yields the c 0 estimate moreover to handle the non linearity of 1 it suffices to consider a hybrid space consisting of a weighted c 2 space and the weighted sobolev space with norm as the sum of the two the global version of our main analytic theorem is theorem 1 7 let e m be the same as in theorem 5 1 suppose a is an admissible connection of order 4 then for any a generic negative p definition 2 21 and b 0 la see 13 is p b fredholm definition 2 18 3 from w 1 2 p b to l 2 p b weighted sobolev spaces in definition 3 24 la is also p b fredholm from hp b to np b hybrid spaces in definition 4 7 remark 1 8 our fredholm theory works for a much larger class of operators as long as the model operator is cone type and admits seperation of variable with respect to some operator on the link in particular it works for the laplace type operators theorem 3 19 we only assume discreteness and some natural asymptotics of the spectrum of the operator on the link when the eigenfunctions are explicitly known one might have a summation formula for the heat kernel and green s function thus more information can be extracted theorem 4 3 and 1 13 in 8 remark 1 9 it does not follow directly from definition that the kernel of the formal adjoint is finite dimensional nor equal to the co kernel nevertheless a trick in lemma 6 3 ensures that we can decrease the blowing up rate of the co kernel a little bit with respect to the spectrum gaps this does not only give us an interesting pde result but also implies the co kernel is precisely the kernel of the formal adjoint theorem 6 1 remark 1 10 we can t have optimal sobolev estimates unless the weight is properly chosen roughly speaking a generic means the weight p of our fredholm theory avoids some discrete values determined by the spectrum of the tangential operators this phenomenon in other settings is well under stood see 10 9 24 remark 1 11 usually the weight in the schauder estimate is required to have non negative power lemma 3 in 14 thus to obtain fredholmness for every negative p we should use a different norm see 4 when the power is negative and adopt a trick in 18 to avoid global interpolations the use of 200 remark 1 12 for theorem 5 1 theorem 1 1 we only need the hy brid theory when p 5 2 3 2 and b 0 the most important usage is to handle the first iteration 146 nevertheless a theory for all p and b is useful for other applications the local version of our deformation theory states as follows theorem 1 13 in the setting of remark 1 5 for any smooth so m bundle e s 6 equipped with a smooth hermitian yang mills connection ao there is a 0 0 such that for any admissible 0 deformation over bo 1 2 r 7 of the euclidean g 2 forms 167 there exists a g 2 monopole of 140 over bo 1 4 tangent to ao at the origin o remark 1 14 currently there is only one hermitian yang mills connection known over s 6 the canonical connection example 2 2 in 36 theorem 1 13 produces concrete local examples of singular g 2 monopoles tan gent to the canonical connection for almost euclidean g 2 structures 4 historically the fredholm problem of elliptic operators has been exten sively studied the most related work to the present article is done by lockhart mcowen 24 they proved that over non compact manifolds a large class of operators are fredholm between proper weighted sobolev spaces melrose mendoza 26 also obtained similar results in the w k 2 setting generalized to pseudo differential operators our hybrid spaces though not the most gen eral are sufficient for this study and are specially designed for singular connections very recently the author learned from thomas walpuski that using cylin drical method for the deformation operator and the theory in 24 he could also obtain a local inverse between weighted schauder spaces for cones this local schauder estimate is well illustrated in section 2 1 of 21 the author also learned from goncalo oliveira that in 27 he obtained g 2 monopoles with diffferent kind of singularities in the aspect of g 2 instantons or monopoles related work are conducted bywalpuski 34 sa earp walpuski 31 and oliveira 28 27 on monopoles in other settings see the

and professor xianzhe dai for valuable discussions 2 definitions and setting we work under the setting of theorem 5 1 by a bundle we mean a open cover and associated overlap functions two bundles with different overlap functions are considered to be different even when they are isomorphic the definitions in this section are all routine and natural a reader famil iar with related material such as 18 14 10 can skip this section and come back if necessary definition 2 1 a smooth so m bundle e m joj is said to be an admissable bundle if e is defined by an admissible cover u 0 definition 2 2 for some 0 0 for each singular point oj the overlap function between v oj and v oj does not depend on r see remark 2 5 i e the overlap function is pulled back from the sphere let denote 0 ade 1 ade ade valued 0 form and 1 form and the corresponding bundle over sn 1 as in section 3 1 all the analysis in this article are on sections to over m or various domains we omit in the notations of the section spaces in definition 2 19 all the definitions and discussions below apply to as well when e is a complex bundle we require it to be a u m 2 bundle and we still view it as a real bundle definition 2 2 admissible open cover given an reference open cover of m and a reference coordinate system a refinement with the same coordinate maps denoted asu 0 bl boj v oj v oj l j are integers with finite range is called an 0 admissible cover if the following conditions are satisfied 1 each bl is in the smooth part of e the ball 100 bl concentric and of radius 100 times larger is still away from the singularities and is contained in a coordinate chart this is different from saying that bl is a metric ball in the manifold in this article by abuse of notation bl means both the ball in the chart and the open set in the manifold it should be clear from the specific context which notion we mean 6 2 eachboj is centred at a singular point of e with radius 0 and contain no other singular point oj corresponds to the origin in the chart 100 boj is still a ball in a coordinate chart and are disjoint from each other moreover in this coordinate oj is the standard g 2 form 3 bl 100 and boj 100 still form a cover of m when 0 small enough with respect to m and e this cover always exists if one adds enough balls of small radius the letter o always means a singular point among the oj s and also the origin in the coordinate by abuse of notations we denote it as bo when we want a ball with radius the symbols bo boj without radius usually means one of balls in u 0 defined above let m denote m jboj the part far away from the singularities remark 2 3 in practice we usually choose the coordinates as the normal coordinates of the underline riemannian metric though our definition allows any smooth coordinate in 35 the existence of tangent cone connection near the singularities is proved in normal coordinates let bo 1 denote the unit ball in r n centred at the origin since bo 1 admits a natural smooth deformation retraction onto sn 1 1 2 the well known homotopy property theorem 6 8 and the last paragraph in page 58 of 4 of bundles gives the following lemma lemma 2 4 any smooth so m bundle e m joj defined by a locally finite cover is isomorphic to an admissible bundle e in definition 2 1 the isomorphism covers the identity map from m joj to itself remark 2 5 near each oj for some 0 0 the smooth isomorphism away from oj is the one in theorem 6 8 of 4 with respect to the natural homotopy deforming the identity map id of boj 0 to the map g f g sn 1 0 0 boj 0 s n 1 0 2 f where g is the spherical projection x t x 0 2 and f is the identity inclusion let r sometimes rx denote the euclidean distance to the singular set o 1 om 0 in the reference coordinate chart respectively remark 2 6 any bundle valued k form without dr component defined over rn o can be viewed as a r dependent bundle valued k form over sn 1 1 let denote the usual euclidean norm of as a form over rn o 7 and s denote the norm on the unit sphere with respect to the standard round metric as a spherical form the relation is 2 1 r 2 k 2 s for any 2 definition 2 7 admissible connections given a smooth bundle e m with finite many singular points and a smooth g 2 structure over m a connection a of e is called an admissible connection of order k 0 if it satisfies the following conditions a is smooth away from the oj s there exist a 1 0 such that for any o among the oj s there is smooth connection ao on e s n 1 such that the following holds in the reference coordinate chart k 0 j 0 r j 1 j ao a ao c log r 1 3 where we view ao as the pulled back connection over r 7 o for the purpose of quantization a is also said to be of polynomial rate 1 at oj we omit the oj if the rate holds at every singular point suppose for some constant c a satisfies 3 with right hand side replaced by cr 0 at oj 0 0 then a is said to be of exponential rate 0 at oj remark 2 8 when a is admissible and satisfies the instanton equation away from the singularities we call it an admissable instanton in practice the coordinate near the singularities are normal coordinate of g see remark 2 3 definition 2 9 a connection a is satisfies condition sa p if the following holds with respect to the reference instanton a a is an admissible connection of order 3 a is close to a in hp definition 4 7 and 2 19 consequently the tangent connections of a at each oj is the same as that of a a is with the same polynomial rate as a at each oj moreover if a is with exponential rate 0 0 at oj then a is with exponential rate min 0 3 2 p at the same point near any singular point o among the oj s the bundle e is trivialized by 2 coordinate patches u u of s n 1 then we choose the cover of bo as v o v o u u 0 0 in these coordinates we can easily define the weighted schauder norms for sections of without involving any connection 8 definition 2 10 as in definition 2 4 of 8 we don t even need a connection to define the schauder norms let rx y min rx ry rx y max rx ry near a singular point o let be a locally defined matrix valued tensor in a coordinate chart of definition 2 2 we define the following b u supx y u log rx y br x y x y x y when 0 supx y u log rx y b rx y x y x y when 0 4 b 0 u sup x u log rx br x x 5 the idea of 4 is to choose the weight function as small as possible note that we allow to be any real number while in lemma 3 in 14 the power is required to be non negative we usually let u be v o v o or a ball contained therein we then define b 2 v o 2 2 b v o 2 2 b 0 v o 1 b 0 v o b 0 v o 6 where the is just the usual gradient in euclidean coordinates moreover by abuse of notation which we adopt through out this article in this case the in 6 means the multi matrix valued function in v o representing b 2 v o is defined in the same way throughout this article so does b 2 b for any ball b v o or v o definition 2 11 global schauder norms in the same context as definition 2 2 let 0 0 be independent of a such that there exists a 0 admissible cover u 0 we define b 2 m i sup bl u 0 2 bl sup boj u 0 b 2 v oj sup boj u 0 b 2 v oj 7 the 2 bl are the unweighted schauder norms defined in 4 5 4 6 in 18 actually we have 2 other ways to define the schauder norms one is by using the smaller cover b 2 m ii sup bl u 0 2 bl 100 sup boj u 0 b 2 v oj 100 sup boj u 0 b 2 v oj 100 8 the third definition is by using the naturally weighted schauder norms in 4 17 of 18 away from the singularity b 2 m iii sup bl u 0 2 bl 50 sup boj u 0 b 2 v oj 50 sup boj u 0 b 2 v oj 50 9 an easy but important lemma is 9 lemma 2 12 the 3 norms in 7 8 9 are equivalent proof this is an easy exercise by definition for the reader s convenience we still point out the crucial detail obviously norm i is stronger than norm iii and norm iii is stronger than norm ii we only need to show norm ii is stronger than norm i this is because of the last item in definition 2 2 v oj v oj 100 is covered by the bl 100 s since the transition functions are smooth then the schauder norm of over v oj v oj 100 is controlled by the supreme of schauder norms on the bl 100 s the same holds for v oj v oj 100 and bl bl 100 away from the singularities definition 2 13 the weighted schauder space c k b m consists of sec tions with the norm 7 being finite this notation also applies to any domain definition 2 14 for the local perturbation in theorem 1 13 on bo r we need a schauder space whose weights near o and bo r are different to be precise we define the space c k t bo r by the norm t k bo r kj 0 sup x v o r min r jx r rx t j j x sup x y v o r min r k x r rx t k x x x y the same in v o r definition 2 15 admissible 0 deformations ofg 2 structures ag 2 structure is called an admissible 0 deformation of if is smooth and c 5 m 0 10 where the c 5 m norm is defined by the base g 2 structure at each oj then we automatically have x crx 11 when x is close to the singularities since the determines a smooth metric g and a smooth co associative form see 32 and 5 we also obtain a small deformation of the base form such that c 5 m c 0 12 note that we don t require to be closed but when we want an instanton we have to assume it s co closed i e is closed 10 definition 2 16 general constants the background data in this article is the dimension n in most cases it s 7 the manifold m and bundle e with a fixed coordinate system the p b in the weights the reference g 2 structures and the tangent cone connections aoj and the bundle e on the sphere the ho lder exponent and the base connection a without further specification the constants c 0 0 1 1 in each estimate means a constant depending at most on the above data we add sub letters to the c when it depends on more data than the above or when we want to emphasize the dependence on some specific factor the c s in different places might be different the 0 0 1 etc are usually small enough with respect to the above data there are some auxiliary small numbers like which we usually let tend to 0 when a bound depends only on the above data we say it s uniform definition 2 17 special constants for any o among the singular points we let c denote any constant depending only on the weights p b and the underlying cone connection ao and the sub symbol if there is any in particular these c s do not depend on the radius of the underlying balls so our requirements are fulfilled they mainly appear in section 3 2 and 3 3 definition 2 18 p b fredholm operators and isomorphisms in the space of l 2 loc sections to m joj consider the inner product given by the weighted space l 2 p b as in page 49 of 10 let h and n be banach spaces of sections to the bundle and l is a bounded linear operator h n l is called a p b fredholm operator if following conditions are satisfied both h and n are subspaces of l 2 p b let be the orthogonal comple ment with respect the l 2 p b inner product imagel is closed in n both kerl and cokerl n imagel are finite dimensional cokerl is isomorphic to image l n and under this isomorphism n admits a direct sum decomposition n imagel p b cokerl where p b is orthogonal with respect to l 2 p b l ker l h imagel is an isomorphism under the norms of h and n the isomorphism means l is bijective restricted to the 2 closed subspaces and both l and l 1 are bounded definition 2 19 abbreviation of notations for the spaces of sections when the log power b is equal to 0 we abbreviate all the notations w 1 2 p b l 2 p b hp b np b jp b qp b ao qa p b etc 11 as w 1 2 p l 2 p hp np jp qp ao qa p etc definition 2 20 tensor products the sign means a tensor product depending on some of and at most the reference g 2 structure the met ric g the euclidean metric in the coordinates or some other g 2 structure manifold or bundle thus the norms of these s are bounded with respect to the above data the s in different places might be different when we are considering some specific tensor product we add sub letter or symbol to the like in lemma 7 1 and proof of proposition 3 3 definition 2 21 given an admissible connection a let p be a real number p is called a generic if 1 p and p do not belong to the v spectrum of any aoj see 31 and definition 3 5 this means neither 7 25 1 p 2 nor 7 25 p 2 is an eigenvalue of any aoj 3 local theory 3 1 seperation of variable for the system in the model case by abuse of notation we still let denote the space of sections to the bundle etc by the monopole equation 140 the linearised operator with respect to 0 ade and a 1 ade at 0 0 0 ade 1 ade when is la a d aa da daa 13 where is the base co associative form in theorem 5 1 let lao denote the deformation operator of ao and euclidean g 2 structure if the operator depends on any different g 2 structure than the euclidean one and we add sub symbol thus l 2 ao is still an operator from to itself to achieve seperation of variable for this operator we should understand the bundle in another way working in general dimension n 4 given any a we write r a ar dr r as 14 where as does not have radial component and ar is a r dependent section of 0 e s n 1 in another word we want to view sections of as r dependent sections of the bundle over sn 1 0 ade s n 1 0 ade s n 1 1 ade s n 1 under the basis in 14 15 12 let s denote the covariant derivative with respect to the connection ao viewed as a connection over sn 1 for the 0 form the well known cone formula for the rough laplacian reads as 2 r 2 n 1 r r s r 2 16 let r by claim 3 11 we have r r 2 r 2 n 3 r r 3 n r 2 s r 2 17 where s is negative of the rough laplacian of ao over s n 1 on 1 forms we have the following polar coordinate formula lemma 3 1 suppose ao is a cone connection over r n o then a a is written as in 14 2 ar r 2 n 3 r ar r 2 n 2 ar r 2 sar 2 d sas r 2 dr r r ras n 1 r ras as r 2 sas 2 dsar r 2 where s is the negative of the rough laplacian of ao on s n 1 the proof of lemma 3 1 will be deferred to section 7 2 next we return to dimension 7 by the formula in lemma 7 1 l 2 ao is the rough laplacian of ao plus some algebraic operators thus the polar coordinate formula naturally involves the su 3 structure of s 6 see 17 36 for the formulas we need let as in 17 be the standard su 3 structure over s 6 where is the standard hermitian metric with respect to the almost complex structure and is the 3 0 form they satisfies d 3 re dim 2 2 18 moreover the standard g 2 forms can be written as 0 r 2 dr r 3 re 0 r 3 dr im r 4 2 2 19 a necessary algebraic definition is the following definition 3 2 some specific tensor products let be a p form and be a q form both are possibly ade valued suppose q p then we define y as the q p form y y 1 yq p i 1 ip vi 1 vip vi 1 vip y 1 yq p 13 where vj s form an orthogonal basis of the underlying metric suppose q p similar to the previous paragraph we define x as the p q form x y 1 yp q i 1 iq vi 1 viq y 1 yp q vi 1 viq the order of multiplication is important since they are matrix valued the symbol means the tensor product f a f ei ej a ei e j where f is an ade valued 2 form a is an 1 form and the e is form an orthonormal frame of the underline metric which is the euclidean metric in the model case the symbol s means the over s 6 with respect to the standard round metric so do the symbols ys and xs routine computation gives the main result in this section proposition 3 3 under the basis in 14 the equation l 2 ao 1 r 0 0 0 dr r id ar as 1 r 0 0 0 dr r id f 0 f 1 f 2 20 is equivalent to 2 r 2 4 r r 5 r 2 ao 0 r 2 f 0 2 ar r 2 4 r ar r 5 ar r 2 ao 1 r 2 f

ao is a smooth self adjoint elliptic operator over s 6 when ao is a 0 instanton i e fao 0 0 as a connection pulled back to r 7 o equivalent to that ao is hermitian yang mills on s 6 36 we have ao ar as s sar 5 ar 2 d sas sas 2 dsar 2 fao sas 23 14 proof we only prove 22 equation 23 is a special case and is implied by lemma 7 1 or by lemma 2 4 in 36 using 22 it suffices to combine lemma 3 1 lemma 7 1 and the proof of it formulas 17 18 19 we say a few more for the readers convenience first since ao is a cone connection then fao a fao as 1 r 2 fao sas 24 second formula 19 directly implies fao a

self adjointness of ao as an operator over s 6 it suffices to note that fao as ysre is adjoint to fao ysre fao ar ys is adjoint to fao ys 2 dsar is adjoint to 2 d sas and fao as ysim is adjoint to fao ar ysim moreover both fao sas and fao as ys 2 2 are self adjoint a very import formula for verifying these relations is claim 3 4 for any ade valued p form a 1 ade valued q form a 2 and ordinary p q form b we have a 1 yb a 2 1 pq a 1 a 2 yb 28 the assumption that s 6 is a so m bundle implies fa is anti symmetric with respect to the inner product of the lie algebra of so m we denote the eigenvalues of ao as and the corresponding eigensection as there might be multiplicities i e ao 0 1 2 0 1 0 ade s 6 2 1 ade s 6 we require to be an orthonormal basis in l 2 s 6 which is the space of l 2 sections to s 6 with respect to the natural inner product of the direct sums in 15 by 21 and 182 the equation l 2 ao f 29 15 is then equivalent to d 2 dr 2 4 r d dr 5 r 2 f where f f 30 let v 2 29 4 31 v is either a non negative real number or a purely imaginary number to reduce the above equation into the form we are most familiar with we consider v r 3 2 fv r 3 2 f then 30 becomes d 2 v dr 2 1 r d v dr v 2 v r 2 fv where v and fv only depend on r 32 by abuse of notation we shall study the ordinary differential equation d 2 u dr 2 1 r du dr v 2 u r 2 f 33 definition 3 5 v spectrum since the v s are determined by via 31 we call them v spectrum of the tangential operators by abuse of notation we write as v f as f v as v etc 3 2 solutions to the odes on the fourier coefficients in this section for any singular point o of the connection and bundle we shall solve 29 locally for the cone connection ao this is equivalent to solving the odes 33 of the fourier coefficients by proving theorem 3 6 we show the existence of good solutions to 33 with the correct and optimal l 2 estimates choosing different formulas for different spectrum the solution for each v are given by 35 37 41 43 these solutions possess the properties for building up a deformation theory for singular connections we can not prove theorem 3 6 only by potential estimates to be precise when v 0 proposition 3 10 a result by potential estimate is not the optimal estimate we want in theorem 3 6 nevertheless the interesting thing is that the 2 terms in 43 actually enjoy some magic cancellation this allows us to use integral identity to improve the non optimal estimate in proposition 3 10 to optimal estimate in propositions 3 8 since this technique involves integration by parts we need to choose the solution properly with respect to the weight so that the boundary terms in lemma 7 16 vanish so we have the identity 51 this is similar to theorem 9 9 of 18 though the weak l 2 1 estimate can be done by calderon zygmund potential estimate thew 2 2 estimate still requires integration by parts 16 theorem 3 6 suppose f is supported in 0 1 100 and vanishes near r 0 suppose p 0 is ao generic and b 0 then

of proposition 3 9 in this case we write i e v 2 2 0 where is real and positive hence equation 33 becomes d 2 u dr 2 1 r du dr 2 u r 2 f 40 since the solutions to the homogeneous equation are sin log

is easier than that of proposition 3 8 choosing q such that p q 0 for the estimate of ui sin log r r 0 x cos log x f x dx we only need to use 38 and 39 by replacing the rv there by sin log r x v by cos log x the estimate of the other term is similar proof of proposition 3 10 when v 0 the solutions to the homogeneous equation d 2 u dr 2 1 r du dr 0 42 are 1 and log r then we choose a particular

parts to improve proposition 3 10 to 3 13 we verify the following identity it doesn t harm to have identities for every v instead of only for v 0 claim 3 11 suppose b v 2 p are real numbers suppose u is a solution to the following differential equation d 2 u dr 2 b r du dr v 2 u r 2 f 45 then the function u rpu satisfies d 2 u dr 2 b 2 p r du dr v 2 p p 1 p b 2 p u r 2 frp 46 in particular when b

a 2 2 v 2 1 4 p 2 p 2 a 4 2 ka 2 2 a 2 v 2 p 2 v 2 p 2 2 49 moreover we consider the weight w 0 as w 0 1 2 r 10 log r 2 b notice that dw 0 dr 0 50 using u rpu and integrating the square of 48 we directly verify 20 lemma 3 12 under the same condition on f as in theorem 3 6 suppose in each case we choose the solutions to 48 33 as in 35 37 41 43 then all the boundary terms in 212 are 0

is non negative when b 1 but we do not assume this in general we compute d 2 w 0 dr 2 non negative terms 2 b 2 b 1 r 2 1 2 r 10 log r 2 b 2 hence 51 implies 1 2 0 u 2 r 3 w 0 dr c 1 2 0 f 2 rw 0 dr 1

complete by combining the above two inequalities 21 3 3 local solutions for the model cone connection our goal in this section is to solve the following deformation equation in model case and obtain optimal sobolev estimates lao f 54 definition 3 14 let w r 2 p log r 2 b p 0 let b be an open set in r n o and be a smooth section of over b we define 2 w 2 2 p b a 0 b b a 0 a 0 2 wdv b 1 r 2 a 0 2 wdv b 2 r 4 wdv 2 w 1 2 p b a 0 b b a 0 2 wdv b 2 r 2 wdv 2 l 2 p b b b 2 wdv since a is admissible the norm w 2 2 p b a b with connection a instead of ao is equivalent to w 2 2 p b a b etc thus by deleting the symbol of the connections we denote the spaces as w 2 2 p b b w 1 2 p b b when the bundle is trivial over bo and the connection is smooth across o our w 2 2 p b norm is stronger than the usual w 2 2 norm weighted by w it fits into our setting better in the sense that the estimates in 58 proposition 3 23 and corollary 3 20 do not depend on the radius of the balls definition 3 15 the space w 2 2 p b b is the completion of the section space c 2 b o w 2 2 p b b under the w 2 2 p b b norm the space w 1 2 p b b is the completion of the section space f f c 1 b o f w 1 2 p b b under the w 2 2 p b b norm the space l 2 p b b is the completion of the following under the l 2 p b b norm f f c c b o only finite terms in the series 30 are non zero we define the space w 1 2 p b w 2 2 p b w 0 2 p b as the following w 1 2 p b bo w 1 2 loc in the coordinates v o v o w 1 2 p b bo 55 lemma 3 16 for any 0 l 2 p b bo is the space of measurable functions on bo which are square integrable with respect to the weight w lemma 3 17 w k 2 p b bo w k 2 p b bo k 0 1 2 22 remark 3 18 the proofs of the above two lemmas are deferred to sec tion 7 4 lemma 3 16 reduces theorem 3 19 to a finite dimensional problem on lemma 3 17 we expect that when the bundle is trivial w 1 2 p b bo can even be approximated by sections that are smooth across the singularity this is because w and r 2 w are ap weights see theorem 1 in 20 our main result in this section is the following the crucial observation is that the l 2 estimate given by theorem 3 6 and simple integra tion by parts yield the w 2 2 estimate theorem 3 19 suppose p 0 is ao generic and b 0 then there is a bounded linear operator qp b ao from l 2 p b bo 1 4 to w 2 2 p b bo 1 4 such that l 2 a 0 qp b ao id from l 2 p b bo 1 4 to itself the bound on qp b ao is less than a c as in definition 2 17 proof of theorem 3 19 this is a direct application of theorem 3 6 we first prove it assuming that f satisfies the conditions in definition 3 15 for l 2 p b bo 1 4 we write f v v 0 r 3 2 fv v for some 0 v 0 see definition 3 5 for each fv we define v as the solution to 32 in 35 37 41 43 and let qp b aof vr 3 2 v v 56 it suffices to bound the l 2 p 2 b bo 1 4 norm of by theorem 3 6 we find bo 1 4 2 r 4 wdv v 1 4 0 s 6 1 2 vr 9 v 2 sr 6 wd dr v 1 4 0 v 2 r 3 wdr c v 1 4 0 f 2 v rwdr c bo 1 4 f 2 wdv 57 by definition 3 15 57 58 and proposition 3 23 the proof is complete when f satisfies the a priori conditions in the first paragraph of this proof in the general case for any f l 2 p b by lemma 3 16 there exists a sequence f j f in l 2 p b topology and f j satisfy the a priori conditions we denote j as qp b aof j by the a priori estimate proved in the first step and the linearity of qp b ao j is a cauchy sequence in w 2 2 p b bo 1 4 by completeness j converges to in w 2 2 p b bo 1 4 moreover satisfies the estimate in theorem 3 19 we thus define qp b aof as the bounds in theorem 3 19 implies that this definition does not depend on the approximation the proof is complete corollary 3 20 let p b be as in theorem 3 19 there exists a local right inverse qp b ao of lao with the following properties for any 1 10 23 qp b ao is bounded from l 2 p b bo to w 1 2 p b bo the bound is less than a c as in definition 2 17 in particular it does not depend on la 0 qp b ao id from l 2 p b bo to itself proof of corollary 3 20 by extending to vanish outsidebo f can be viewed as a section in l 2 p b bo 1 4 it suffices to take qp b ao laoqp b ao and re strict it to bo under this extension qp b ao does not depend on next we establish two crucial building blocks of theorem 3 19 lemma 3 21 under the same conditions in theorem 3 19 suppose f satisfies the a priori conditions in the first paragraph of proof of theorem 3 19 let qp b aof then for any 0 1 the following bound holds bo 4 5 ao 2 r 2 wdv c bo 4 2 r 4 wdv bo 4 f 2 wdv 58 c is as in definition 2 17 thus is independent of remark 3 22 the estimate is independent of because 58 is scaling correct this is important for 85 when f satisfies the a priori conditions qp b aof is smooth away from o thus every term in the proofs of theorem 3 19 lemma 3 21 proposition 3 23 makes sense proof let be the standard cut off function of the singular point o which vanishes in bo and is identically 1 when r 2 we have 2 2 c when 59 let be the standard cut off function

let f denote the image 4 1 global apriori estimate definition 4 1 for any real number let denote the v spectrum gap of aoj s at i e the distance from to the closest v eigenvalue of any aoj other than

of 0 remark 4 3 we don t need p to be ao generic since by condition 76 any harmonic section in w 1 2 p b does not have non trivial component on v p proof of lemma 4 2 the idea of proof is to use fourier expansion to rule out some bad eigenvalues we write r 3 2 uv v see definition 3 5 73 since is harmonic and uv is the spherical inner product by 21 with right hand side as 0 we directly verify

reduce the estimate for la to estimate of the model operator we only need to derive this estimate near the singularity away from the singularity it follows from the standard estimates then we patch up the estimates in each piece for any 0 when 0 small enough given w 1 2 p b bo 2 0 by corollary 3 20 there exists a such that lao lao and 80 w 1 2 p b bo 2 0 c lao l 2 p b bo 2 0 c is independent of 0 and 0 c la lao l 2 p b bo 2 0 c la l 2 p b bo 2 0 c la l 2 p b bo 2 0 0 w 1 2 p b bo 2 0 28 then we estimate w 1 2 p b bo 0 w 1 2 p b bo 0 w 1 2 p b bo 0 c la l 2 p b bo 2 0 0 w 1 2 p b bo 2 0 w 1 2 p

and 84 imply w 1 2 p b bo 0 c la l 2 p b bo 2 0 c 0 w 1 2 p b bo 2 0 c 0 l 2 p b bo 2 0 85 away from the singularities we have w 1 2 p b m 0 2 c 0 0 la l 2 p b m 0 4 cb p 0 l 2 p b m 0 4 86 adding 85 and 86 we find w 1 2 p b c la l 2 p b c 0 w 1 2 p b c l 2 p b 87 choosing the 0 initially in 80 to be less than 1 20 c we let 0 be small enough with respect to 0 the proof of theorem 4 5 is complete theorem 4 6 let a p b be as in theorem 1 7 then kerla in w 1 2 p b is finite dimensional moreover for any f imagela there exists a solution to la f such that ker la w 1 2 p b and w 1 2 p b c f l 2 p b proof we first show that kerla is finite dimensional were this not true there exist countably many k s in kerla such that for any k k is not in the span of the preceding vectors then using the l 2 p b inner product the gram schmidt process produces an orthonormal sequence k of sections in kerla on the other hand by theorem 4 5 we have k w 1 2 p b c then lemma 4 10 implies k converges in l 2 p b which contradicts the orthogonality 29 since kerla w 1 2 p b is now shown to be finite dimensional we consider the projection of onto kerla with respect to the l 2 p b inner product as kerla given any such that la f we consider kerla then ker la 88 to prove the estimate in theorem 4 6 by theorem 4 5 it suffices to show l 2 p b c f l 2 p b 89 were 89 not true there exists a sequence i w 1 2 p b fi la i imagela l 2 p b such that i l 2 p b 1 i ker la but fi l 2 p b 0 90 by theorem 4 5 and lemma 4 10 i converges in l 2 p b to by the linearity of la these in turn imply i is a cauchy sequence in w 1 2 p b i j w 1 2 p b c i j l 2 p b c fi fj l 2 p b 0 91 then i converges to in w 1 2 p b w 1 2 p b l 2 p b 1 and la 0 but i ker la implies kerla this is a contradiction 4 2 hybrid space and c 0 estimate using an interpolation trick the c 0 estimate is a direct corollary of thew 1 2 p b estimate to see this for any point q close enough to a singular point o w 1 2 p b l 2 p 1 b implies the average of over bq rq 2 is bounded correctly i e by r 5 2 p q log rq b since satisfies an elliptic equation the interpolation trick gives the c 0 bound for second order uniformly elliptic equations of

that this is different from y k b definition 2 13 on which the weight depends only on the distance to the singular point by lemma 7 4 and multiplication of weight in b bq rq 100 we have 7 2 1 b c la 9

by definition we have r 7 2 q f 9 2 b c r 1 q log rq b f b b 101 then q c r 1 q log rq b f b b l 2 9 2 b b 102 since q is an arbitrary point near the singularity and f b b f b m the proof of theorem 4

94 then 95 is a corollary of proposition 7 5 and 94 4 3 compact imbedding lemma 4 10 suppose p 1 1 p 2 or p 1 1 p 2 and b 1 b 2 then for any ball b such that b does not intersect the singularities the imbedding w 1 2 p 1 b 1 b l 2 p 2 b 2 b is compact consequently the imbedding w 1 2 p 1 b 1 l 2 p 2 b 2 of global spaces is compact proof it suffices to assume b is centred at a singular point o and does not contain any other singular point we only prove the case when p 1 1 p 2 and b 1 b 2 1 the proof in general is the same except that we have to spell out 32 more notations by definition the imbedding from w 1 2 p 1 b 1 b to l 2 p 1 1 b 1 b is bounded for any concentric and smaller ball b r we have b r u 2 wp 2 b 2 dx 1 logr 2 b r u 2 wp 1 1 b 1 dx 103 then suppose u w 1 2 p 1 b 1 b c 1 we can choose rm depending on b and c 1 such that b rm u 2 wp 2 b 2 dx 1 2 1 m 104 given a sequence ui such that ui w 1 2 p 1 b 1 b c using compactness of the imbedding w 1 2 b b rm l 2 b b rm we obtain a cauchy subsequence um j in l 2 p 2 b 2 b b rm and um j l 2 p 2 b 2 b rm 1 m this means for any m and the um j there is a nm such that j l nm implies um j um l l 2 p 2 b 2 b 4 m 105 when b a we choose ub j as a subsequence of ua j then we can write uaa as um ja ubb as um jb since they are subsequence of um j then ja a jb b consider the diagonal sequence uaa by the discussion above for any m when a b m nm we have uaa ubb l 2 p 2 b 2 b 4 m 106 thus the diagonal sequence uaa is a cauchy sequence in l 2 p 2 b 2 b 4 4 fredholm theory using the local inverse in corollary 3 20 and the above compact sobolev imbedding it s almost standard to prove la is fredholm we consider the linearized equation la f on a small ball 107 proposition 4 11 let a p b be as in theorem 1 7 there is a 0 0 such that for any singular point o there exists a bounded linear map qa p b from l 2 p b bo 0 to w 1 2 p b bo 0 with the following properties laqa p b id from l 2 p b bo 0 to itself the bound on qa p b is less than a c as in definition 2 17 33 consequently equation 107 admits a solution such that w 1 2 p b bo 0 c f l 2 p b bo 0 in particular c does not depend on 0 108 remark 4 12 note that for w 1 2 p b estimate we don t have to shrink domain this is similar to the case of standard laplace equation theorem 9 9 in 18 proof the proof is similar to that of theorem 5 2 in 18 equation 107 is equivalent to qp b aof qp b aopao a pao a lao la 109 where qp b ao is the one in corollary 3 20 0 by definition 2 7 and lemma 7 11 for any 0 when 0 is small enough with respect to 0 and we obtain the following for any 1 2 w 1 2 p b bo 0 pao a 1 2 l 2 p b bo 0 c 0 1 2 w 1 2 p b bo 0 110 by the optimal w 1 2 p b estimate of qp b ao we obtain 1 2 w 1 2 p b bo 0 c 0 1 2 w 1 2 p b bo 0 111 let c 0 1 4 is a contract mapping from w 1 2 p b bo 0 to itself then there must be a unique fixed point which solves 107 we define qa p bf as this the uniqueness also implies qa p b is linear the condition c 0 1 4 109 110 and corollary 3 20 imply w 1 2 p b bo 0 qp b aof w 1 2 p b 1 4 w 1 2 p b bo 0 112 therefore 108 is true the following lemma is well known lemma 4 13 lemma 1 3 1 of 19 theorem 4 3 of 23 under the same as sumptions in proposition 4 11 on a for the 0 obtained there the 0 admissible cover u 0 satisfies the following property for any ball bl u 0 away from the singularity there exists a local parametrix ql l 2 bl w 1 2 bl such that laql id kl kl is compact l 2 bl l 2 bl proof for the reader s convenience we mention a little bit any section l 2 bl can be extended as 0 outside bl thus gives a section in h 0 l 2 defined in page 6 of 19 choosing the in a of lemma 1 3 1 in 19 to be the standard cutoff function which is identically 1 in bl but vanishes outside 2 bl lemma 1 3 1 in 19 says laql id is an infinitely smoothing operator defined in first line of page 12 in 19 then by restricting laql id onto bl the proof is complete 34 theorem 4 14 let a p b be as in theorem 1 7 there is a bounded linear operator q l 2 p b w 1 2 p b such that kp b laq id l 2 p b l 2 p b is compact proof we consider the 0 admissible cover u 0 in definition 2 2 for the 0 in proposition 4 11 in the boj s near the singular points we use the right inverse inverse qj constructed in proposition 4 11 in the bl s away from the singular points we use the ql s in lemma 4 13 then let q f j jqj jf l lql lf 113 where j l s are the partition of unity of u 0 5 with co centric balls with radius 1 5 of the original one and j l are smooth functions such that j l 1 over supp j boj 5 supp l bl 5 0 outside boj 4 bl 4 then j j j l l l for any smooth function and section a we calculate la la g d where 114 g d 0 d a d d a is an algebraic operator 115 thus laq f jg d j qj jf lg d l ql lf l lkl lf 116 since each j is smooth corollary 3 20 yields jg d j qj jf w 1 2 p b c f l 2 p b 117 lemma 4 13 implies l lkl lf l 1 2 p b c f l 2 p b let kp b f jg d j qj jf lg d l ql lf l lkl lf 118 we obtain kp bf w 1 2 p b c f l 2 p b by lemma 4 10 kp b is compact from l 2 p b to itself proof of theorem 1 7 by theorem 4 14 using the argument in page 50 of 10 and in the proof of theorem 4 in 15 the proof of the sobolev theory part of theorem 1 7 is complete the hybrid part in theorem 1 7 is a direct corollary of the crucial c 0 estimate in theorem 4 9 suppose f is in cokernel 158 yields l af 0 away 35 from the singularities then theorem 4 9 for l a 9 2 p with f there being 0 and there being f yields f c 1 7 2 p b m c f l 2 p b 119 this means cokerla np b definition 4 7 since imagala w 1 2 p b is closed in l 2 p b for any f np b we have a resolution into parallel and perpendicular components with respect to imagela w 1 2 p b f f f f cokerla 120 the estimate 119 means f np b and f c 1 7 2 p b c f l 2 p b c f l 2 p b c f np b 121 the decomposition 120 implies f np b thus we have proved lemma 4 15 suppose f np b then f np b c f np b f np b c f np b 122 lemma 4 15 and theorem 4 6 yields a solution to la f which is orthogonal to the kernel and l 2 p 1 b w 1 2 p b c f l 2 p b 123 theorem 4 9 7 2 p and 123 gives 5 2 p b 2 m c f np b therefore hp b c f np b 124 the proof of the hybrid spaces part of theorem 1 7 is complete remark 4 16 the pre image space jp b we define jp b hp b kerla 125 theorem 1 7 says la is an isomorphism from jp b to imagela hp b np b denoting hp b as jp b when jp b we rewrite 124 as l 1 a f jp b c f np b for any f imagela hp b 126 36 5 perturbation in this section we don t need the log weight thus we conform to the abbrevia tion convention in definition 2 19 i e there will be no b in the symbols of the function spaces we prove the most precise version of theorem 1 1 theorem 5 1 let m be a 7 manifold with a smooth g 2 structure and e m be an admissible so m bundle defined away from finitely many points definition 2 1 suppose a is an admissible instanton of order 4 definition 2 7 and 1 then for any a generic p 5 2 3 2 definition 2 21 there exists a 0 0 with the following property suppose cokerla 0 theorem 6 1 for any admissible 0 deformation of definition 2 15 there exists a g 2 monopole a such that a satisfies condition sa p definition 2 9 in particular the tangent connection of a at each singular point is the same as that of a when is closed a is a instanton proposition 5 2 under the same conditions as in theorem 5 1 for any 1 0 and 1 there is a 0 with the following property for any admissible 0 deformation of we have fa c 1 1 1 m 1 for any 0 1 127 thus for any 2 0 and 1 the following is true when 0 is small enough fa n 5 2 2 1 128 proof the essential issue can be elaborated by the c 0 estimate the instan ton condition 1 implies fa fa 129 let 0 0 be small enough such that bo 0 is within the coordinate chart near o when r 0 the admissible condition implies o o hence cr adjust 0 such that c 1 0 1 2 we find fa c r c 10 r 1 1 1 r 1 1 130 when r 0 still by the condition in proposition 5 2 we have fa c 0 2 0 c 0 1 2 2 1 1 when 0 is small enough 131 thus we obtain the c 0 bound fa c 0 1 1 m fa c 0 1 1 m c 1 132 37 where means equivalent up to a constant in the sense of definition 2 16 the bounds on a fa c 0 2 1 m and 2 a fa c 0 3 1 m are similar for the reader s convenience we still do the gradient bound a fa a fa 133 fa fa a fa for the first term by 132 and that c 5 m c we have fa c 0 2 1 m fa c 0 1 1 m c 1 134 for the second term we have the following cheap estimate fa c 0 r 2 135 by exactly the trick relaxing the weight a little bit from 130 to 132 we obtain for any 1 0 that fa c 0 2 1 m 1 when 0 is small enough 136 in the same way it follows that the c 0 2 1 m norm of the third term is less than 1 using a fa c r 3 then we obtain a fa c 0 2 1 m c 1 when 0 is small enough 137 the proof of the hessian estimate 2 a fa c 0 3 1 m c 1 138 is absolutely the same except that we have one more negative power on r by replacing c 1 by 1 since 1 is arbitrary and c does not depend on it the estimates 132 137 138 amount to fa c 2 1 1 m 1 139 by lemma 7 6 the proof of 127 is complete using definition 4 7 the proof of 128 is done by letting 1 2 2 in 127 and 0 small enough the monopole equation with respect to is fa a da a 0 with gauge fixing equation d a a 0 140 it s equivalent to daa 1 2 a a da a fa 0 141 with gauge fixing equation 140 and 141 can be written as la a 0 1 2 a a a fa 142 38 lemma 5 3 under the same conditions as in theorem 5 1 la is an iso morphism from jp to np and the bounds on itself and the inverse of it are uniform for all admissible 0 deformations of when 0 is small enough with respect to the data in definition 2 16 proof the proof is exactly as that of proposition 4 11 for the reader s conve nience we include the crucial detail for any f np the equation la a f is equivalent to 143 a l 1 a la la a l 1 a f 144 the right hand side of 144 is a contract mapping in terms of a from jp to itself thus iteration implies 143 can be uniquely solved in jp the bound on l 1 a follows from the last part in the proof of proposition 4 11 by lemma 5 3 142 is equivalent to the following equation a l 1 a p a 145 where p a means the right hand side of 142 the first iteration is l 1 a p 0 0 l 1 a 0 fa 146 for any p as in theorem 5 1 there is a 2 such that p 5 2 2 thus proposition 5 2 implies the following bound on the first iteration l 1 a p 0 0 jp c fa np c 1 when 0 is small enough 147 proof of theorem 5 1 to solve the taming pair equation 140 it suffices to show that l 1 a p is a contract mapping when restricted to a small enough neighbourhood of 0 in jp then iteration as in section 3 of 8 implies the existence of a unique solution close enough to 0 since p 3 2 this is an easy consequence of the multiplicative property of jp hp np in lemma 4 8 and that the 2 terms 1 2 a a and a 148 39 are quadratic for the reader s convenience we include the crucial detail we compute p 1 a 1 p 2 a 2 149 1 2 a 1 a 2 a 1 1 2 a 2 a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 1 then lemma 4 8 implies p 1 a 1 p 2 a 2 np c 1 a 1 2 a 2 jp 1 a 1 jp 2 a 2 jp 150 thus letting 1 small enough with respect to the c above and the c in 126 the condition 1 a 1 jp 2 a 2 jp 1 implies l 1 a p 1 a 1 l 1 a p 2 a 2 jp 1 2 1 a 1 2 a 2 jp 151 the proof of the contract mapping is complete denote a a as a when is closed note that by applying d a to 141 away from the singularity we obtain d a da 0 then we choose the cut off function as in 59 and calculate 0 m d a da dv m da d m da 2 dv 152 jp implies da c r 7 2 p c r 5 2 p then m da d c b b 2 1 r 7 2 p 1 r 5 2 p 1 r c 2 p 0 as 0 153 let 0 in 152 monotone convergence theorem and 153 implies m da 2 dv 0 this means da 0 and thus 140 says a is a instanton proof of theorem 1 13 using corollary 3 20 this is much easier than theorem 5 1 the crucial trick is to cut off the nonlinear term and error in 140 142 i e let denote a we should consider the equation lao 0 fao 1 2 a a a 154 40 is the standard cut off function 1 in bo 1 4 and 0 outside bo 5 16 using 102 with 7 2 p for any p as in theorem 5 1 and proof of theorem 1 in 14 in bo 7 16 and near bo 7 16 we obtain 5 2 p 7 2 2 bo 7 16 c lao 7 2 p 9 2 1 bo 7 16 l 2 p 1 bo 7 16 see definition 2 14 155 we define h p is c 2 away from o w 1 2 p bo 7 16 5 2 p 7 2 2 bo 7 16 and n p is c 1 away from o l 2 p bo 716 7 2 p 9 2 1 bo 7 16 using corollary 3 20 and 155 the lao 0 h p n p is inverted by qp ao which is linear and bounded by a c as in definition 2 17 moreover the advantage of cutting off the monopole equation is claim 5 4 we have f c 1 7 2 p 9 2 bo 7 16 c f c 1 7 2 p bo 6 16 consequently 1 2 n p c 1 h p 2 h p where and are as in 154 the proof of the above is similar to lemma 4 8 the cutoff function plays the key role claim 5 4 means we can avoid the boundary estimate near b b as in theorem 1 13 with the help of proposition 5 2 by going through the proof of lemma 5 3 theorem 5 1 and replacing the a and proposition 5 2 by ao and 0 replacing the la la in lemma 5 3 by lao lao respectively replacing the l 1 a in proof of theorem 5 1 by l 1 ao replacing the jp np in proof of theorem 5 1 by h p n p respectively we obtain a solution to 154 in h p for any p as in theorem 5 1 since 1 in bo 1 4 ao a solves the monopole equation therein see 142 and the discussion above it the proof of theorem 1 13 is complete 6 characterizing the cokernel the formal adjoint of la is l af laf g d p b p b f defined away from

singularities using theorem 4 9 for 9 2 p we deduce cokerla f np b l af 0 away from the singularities 158 however a priorily there is no guarantee that the right hand side of 158 is finite dimensional fortunately when p is a generic the blowing up rate of elements in cokernel can be improved as follows theorem 6 1 let a p b be as in theorem 1 7 for all 0 1 p cokerla f c 1 7 2 p m l af 0 away from the singularites 159 moreover f 7 2 p 1 m c f l 2 p b for any f cokerla in particular if f satisfies the two conditions in the parentheses of 159 for some 0 then f satisfies them for all 1 p proof by theorem 5 of appendix d 5 in 15 cokerla ker id k p b l 2 p b lemma 6 3 implies any f ker id k p b is actually in l 2 p b with uniform bound in terms of the l 2 p b norm of f then theorem 6 1 is a directly corollary of 158 lemma 6 3 6 4 and theorem 4 9 for l a by taking 9 2 p the crucial observation is that in the setting of theorem 6 1 we have qaoj p bf qaoj p bf for any j 160 the reason is that the v spectrum of the tangential operators are fixed thus if v 1 p the same holds with p with replaced by p or p hence the solution formulas in 35 37 41 and 43 do not change proof it s directly implies by the lemmas 6 2 6 3 and 6 4 lemma 6 2 let a p b be as in theorem 6 1 then l 2 p b l 2 p b is an invariant subspace of kp b and kp b kp b when restricted to l 2 p b con sequently for any f l

do not depend on the weight chosen in the setting of 110 and 111 let qj p b denote qa p b near oj by 160 and uniqueness of fixed point of contract mappings we find qj p bf qj p bf when f c c boj oj since qj p b qj p b is bounded from l 2 p b boj l 2 p b boj to w 1 2 p b boj w 1 2 p b boj their extensions as in proof of theorem 3 19 agree on l 2 p b boj l 2 p b boj hence qj p bf l 2 p b boj f l 2

r r ar dr r 1 r 2 sar 2 n 4 ar dr r 2 r 2 dsar since 190 is independent of the coordinate chosen and p is arbitrary then it holds everywhere on r 7 o part ii we compute the rough laplacian of the

is completed by combining 190 and 195 7 3 appendix c fundamental facts on elliptic systems in this section we work under the same conditions as in theorem 1 7 for any q near a singular point o denote b bq rq 100 196 then b lies in one coordinate sector let l be the local elliptic operator with a 0 in b i e l a d a d day for any locally defined g 2 structure we have the following weighted estimate due to nirenberg douglis 14 2 b c l 1 1 b c 0 b 197 where c depends at most on the c 5 norm and the non degeneracy of an easy but important building block is lemma 7 4 suppose ck b the following estimate holds k b c la 1 k 1 b c 0 b k 2 3 4 the estimate holds the same with la replaced by l a 48 proof we only prove it for la when k 2 on l a note that definition 3 24 implies dwp b wp b c r thus we verify that dwp b wp b 1 2 0 b dwp b wp b 1 2 0 b c then formula 156 implies that the proof for la directly carries over to l a the admissible conditions implies a 1 2 0 b c hence a 1 1 b c using la l a g and splitting of weight we have a g 1 1 b a 1 1 b 1 b c 1 b thus la l 1 1 b c 1 b and this implies 2 b c la 1 1 b 0 b la l 1 1 b c la 1 1 b 1 b 198 by lemma 6 32 in 18 standard interpolation for any 0 1 100 we have 1 b 2 2 0 b c 0 b 199 then 198 and 199 imply lemma 7 4 proposition 7 5 let be any real number suppose is c 2 away from the singularity la c 1 b m c 0 1 b m then c 2 1 b m and 1 b 2 m c la b 1 m c 1 b 0 m proof we only consider the case when 1 0 by our choice of x and y the paragraph above 201 the proof is similar when it s negative without loss of generality for any singular point o we only consider x bo 0 and bx rx 1000 for any y bx rx 1000 the distance from y to bx rx 1000 is less than ry and we have 2 ry rx ry 2 10 log ry log rx log ry 10 thus rx y ry rx rx y hence using the proof of 4 20 in theorem 4 8 of 18 and lemma 7 4 multiplying both sides of the estimate in lemma 7 4 by r 1 q log rq b we obtain the following lower order estimate 1 b 2 0 m c la b 1 m c 1 b 0 m 200 the term left to estimate is the following one with highest order qx y log rx y br 1 x y 2 x 2 y x y this can be done in a standard way we can assume rx ry since otherwise we only need to interchange them we note that this choice is different from the paragraph above 6 15 in 18 suppose y bx rx 2000 the proof of 200 implies one more conclusion qx y c la b 1 m c 1 b 0 m 201 49 when y bx rx 2000 we only need to consider y in bo 0 we find qx y 202 log rx br 1 x 2 x log ry br 1 y 2 y c 1 b 2 0 m c la b m c 1 b 0 m by 200 the proof of proposition 7 5 is complete working on each coordinate patch separately by the proof of lemma 6 32 in 18 with slight modification on log weight as proposition 7 5 we obtain lemma 7 6 intepolation for any 1 3000 b 0 0 1 and real numbers k there exists a constant c k b with the following property for any section and non negative integer j the following intepolation holds j k b m j 1 k 1 b 0 m c k b j k b 0 m 203 where j is viewed as a combination of locally defined matrix valued tensors in each chart of u 0 lemma 7 7 suppose b is a ball such that 2 b is contained in a single coor dinate neighbourhood away from the singularity suppose w 1 2 2 b and la c 1 2 b in the sense of strong solution then u c 2 b remark 7 8 we believe lemma 7 7 is in literature since the author can not find an exact reference we still give a proof for the readers convenience proof we apply la to the equation again to obtain l 2 a laf c 2 b from the proof of lemma 7 1 we see that the difference of the weitzenbo ck formula between the model case and the general case is some lower order term concerning at most first derivative of in local coordinates then g t a 1 t a 0 laf 204 where the t s are tensors depending algebraicly on a and their deriva tives the t s might be only locally defined but this is sufficient the important point is that g means the metric laplacian of each entry of in local coordinates thus 204 is actually a bunch of scalar equations then lemma 7 7 follows by applying lemma 7 9 successively lemma 7 9 18 under the same conditions on b in lemma 7 7 suppose w 1 2 2 b is a weak solution to g h in 2 b 205 suppose h lp 2 b p 2 then l 2 p b suppose h c 2 b 0 1 then c 2 b 50 proof it suffices to construct local solutions with optimal regularity to 205 viewing 205 as a bunch of scalar equations let the boundary value over b be 0 when h lp 2 b and p 2 theorem 9 15 in 18 implies that 205 admits a solution l 2 p b in b when h c 2 b theorem 6 14 in 18 gives a solution c 2 b to 205 in both cases g 0 therefore is smooth by lemma 7 10 then l 2 p b or c 2 b when h lp b or c b respectively lemma 7 10 see gilkey 19 suppose f l 2 p b belongs to the cokernel of la in distribution sense see 157 then f is smooth away from the singular points kerla w 1 2 p b also implies is smooth away from the singularities proof it s an easy exercise on pseudo differential operators we only need to show the conditions imply l af 0 where we view l af as an element in h 1 see lemma 1 2 1 in 19 thus lemma 1 3 1 of 19 is directly applicable to achieve this for any ball b such that 100 b is still away from the sin gularities we choose as the standard cutoff function which vanishes outside 2 b and is identically 1 in b we also choose as the standard cutoff function which vanishes outside 3 b and is identically 1 in 2 b by lemma 1 2 1 and 1 1 6 in 19 using a limiting argument with respect the smoothing of f we obtain l a f 0 as an element in h 1 since l a is elliptic we conclude by lemma 1 3 1 of 19 that f is smooth in b lemma 7 11 suppose 0 and 1 2 are two g 2 structures over bo 2 0 1 2 suppose a 1 a 2 are 2 connections over bo 0 a 1 a 2 r then la 1 1 la 2 2 c a 2 c r in bo 0 206 remark 7 12 the c depends on c 2 norms of 1 2 and c 0 norm of ra 1 in local coordinates the a 2 is the covariant derivative with respect to the euclidean metric in the coordinate the estimate 206 still holds for a 1 and with respect to any smooth metric proof in 13 we only estimate the difference from d aa the errors from the other terms are similar by d a da we note 1 da 1 1 2 da 2 2 1 2 da 1 1 2 da 1 da 2 1 2 da 2 1 2 we only estimate the last term 2 da 2 1 2 the estimate of the other terms are similar and easier using da 2 1 2 a 1 2 a 2 a 1 2 a we get la 1 1 la 2 2 c a 2 c then we obtain 206 when r 0 7 4 appendix d density and smooth convergence of fourier series lemma 7 13 let s be a closed riemannian manifold of any dimension and s be a smooth so m vector bundle with an inner product suppose 51 as is a smooth connection on and as as as f is a self adjoint laplacian type operator acting on sections of where as as is the rough laplacian of as and the riemannian metric f is a smooth algebraic operator which does not concern any covariant derivative let be the real eigenvalues of as repeated according to their multiplicities and be the corresponding orthonormal basis in l 2 s then for any smooth section f to the fourier series f of f converges to f in the c topology moreover the speed of convergence only depends on the c norm of f i e there exists a integer 0 depending only on as such that for any 0 and integer s 0 there exists a k depending only on f w 2 2 s 2 s and as such that f kf w 2 s 2 s corollary 7 14 in the setting of lemma 3 16 and theorem 3 19 let f c c bo o then the fourier series in 30 converges in c 0 bo to f proof of lemma 7 13 since as is bounded from below by considering as a 0 i for some big enough a 0 we can assume all the s are larger than 1000 in claim 7 15 we note that las klf is the fourier partial sum of lasf let fk denote kf and k 100 sup 0 l s kl the standard w 2 2 estimate for as and claim 7 15 imply s 1 as fk m w 2 2 s c s as fk m l 2 s c s 1 as fk m l 2 s c

s c s replacing c s by the proof of lemma 7 13 is complete by assuming the following claim 7 15 for any 0 integer l 0 there exists a kl depending only on f w 2 l 2 2 s l as such that l as f las klf l 2 s 6 the proof of the claim is by the asymptotic property of zeta functions for any positive integer t using f s f s f tas t s tasf t 209 we get f c f w 2 t 2 s t then lasfkl l 2 s 6 c f w 2 t 2 s kl 1 t l the sum kl 1 t l is part of the zeta function of as there exists a large enough with respect to the data in lemma 7 13 such that 1 t l converges to an analytic function of t l by corollary 2 43 in 3 or lemma 1 10 1 in 19 we can take dims 2 2 nevertheless we don t need to be explicit 52 let t l and kl be large enough with respect to and the zeta function of as the proof of claim 7 15 is complete proof of corollary 7 14 the condition f c c bo o implies that by viewing f as an r dependent smooth section the sobolev norms of f are uniformly bounded in r i e f r w 2 t 2 sn 1 cf t moreover f and its fourier coefficients vanishes when r is small enough then for any let s n 1 4 10 by sobolev imbedding there exists a k as in lemma 7 13 such that the estimate f r kf r c 0 sn 1 c f f r kf r w 2 s 2 sn 1 holds uniformly in r the proof of corollary 7 14 is complete proof of lemma 3 16 without loss of generality we assume 1 drop ping the last condition in definition 3 15 we first show that c c bo 1 o is dense in l 2 p b bo 1 we assume f satisfies the condition after the which in lemma 3 16 under local coordinate f is a matrix valued function for any 0 by absolute continuity of lebesgue integration theorem 4 12 in 38 for any small enough h 0 we can decompose f f 0 f 1 f 0 is supported in v o v h and v o v h f 0 2 wdv 2 2 f 1 is supported in v h where v h is the set of points with distance to v o greater than h since f 1 is supported away from the singular point using lemma 7 2 in 18 we can find f such that f f 1 l 2 p b v o 2 suppf v h 2 then f f l 2 p b v o f f 1 l 2 p b v o f 0 l 2 p b v o f is exactly the desired approximation let f be the same approximation in v o we denote the partition of unity over sn 1 subordinate to u u as and pull them back to r 7 o let f f f we obtain f f l 2 p b bo 1 f f l 2 p b v o f f l 2 p b v o 2 210 viewing f as a r dependent smooth section of s 6 1 corollary 7 14 implies that the series vf v r v see 30 converges to f in c 0 bo 1 and the following holds for some large enough v 0 0 bo 1 f f v 0 2 wdv 2 where f v 0 v v 0 f v r v 211 inequalities 210 and 211 imply f v 0 f l 2 p b bo 1 3 the following proof does not depend on corollary 7 14 53 proof of lemma 3 17 we only consider the case k 1 and assume 1 the assertion w 1 2 p b bo 1 w 1 2 p b bo 1 is an easy exercise using monotone convergence theorem and theorem 7 4 in 18 away from the singularity the assertionw 1 2 p b bo 1 w 1 2 p b bo 1 means every section w 1 2 p b bo 1 can be approximated by smooth sections defined in bo 1 away from o in w 1 2 p b bo 1 topology it suffices to show every w 1 2 p b v o in local coor dinate can be approximated by smooth multi matrix valued functions defined in v o this job is done by using the proof of theorem 7 9 in 18 with the 2 j in 7 25 there replaced by 2 j j where j 1 sup j r 2 and j is the corresponding open set in a natural cover of v o 7 5 appendix e various integral identities and proof of proposition 3 23 lemma
