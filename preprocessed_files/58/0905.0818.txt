riemannian manifold m g diffeomorphic to the direct product m 4 s 2 s 2 of two two spheres by some diffeomorphism f s 2 s 2 m the flag foliation f on m 4 by the push forward construction by f provides the flag foliation f on m 4 we define some functional h on leaves of the foliation f applying the nash process we construct the smooth f such that h vanishes on some so called silent leaf f implying the affirmative solution to the hopf conjecture on the non existence of the riemannian metric g on s 2 s 2 with positive sectional curvature introduction the direct product m 4 s 2 s 2 contains many totally geodesic tori we may choose one of them f and construct the torus action on m 4 such the set of its orbits will give the singular foliation f of m 4 with f being one of the leaves starting to change the metric on m 4 we then observe what happens with this foliation and f we can not expect that the totally geodesic torus survives this change but may hope that possibly after some correction by a diffeomorphism of m 4 still there will be in arbitrary m 4 g diffeomorphic to m 4 some special torus f flat enough to guarantee the existence of zero curvature somewhere for instance due to the gauss equation and the gauss bonnet theorem this happens if in each point of f there exists a direction in which all second forms of f vanish assume that these are directions tangent to yet another one dimensional foliation on m 4 defined in a similar way as f take the orbits of the diagonal s 1 action of the s 1 s 1 torus action on s 2 s 2 the flatness of the each particular torus f then will be measured by the maximum rotation of its tangent planes along our wiring see the definition of the functional h f below if h f 0 we say that f is parallel 1 then the tangent planes are parallel along all curves and the hopf conjecture follows connecting an arbitrary m 4 g with the standard direct product m 4 g by a family m 4 g 0 1 where g is a smooth family of riemannian metrics we know that for 0 such torus exists how we can be sure that it does not disappear we associate to every flag foliation f a vector field w on the moduli space x 2 of the foliation f on m 4 in our case this is the square 2 2 2 2 such that parallel leaves would be zeroes of w then we check that w has one zero of the index one when the metric on m 4 of the standard direct product and that during the deformation g the vector field w never vanish on the boundary of x 2 non collapsing this provides us for every with some torus f such that w 0 and the last condition makes the nash minimizing process possible resulting in some parallel f 1991 mathematics subject classification 58 53 c key words and phrases foliations functionals the hopf conjecture 1 or holomorphic see appendix for explanations typeset by ams tex 1 http arxiv org abs 0905 0818 v 2 2 valery marenich remark that the given metric g is the limit of g when 1 where the family of metrics is chosen to satisfy some standard regularity assumptions therefore we do not claim that the silent torus exists in the arbitrary given m 4 g instead the family of planes of zero curvature tangent to the silent tori in m 4 g will have some limit due to compactness ofm 4 some two dimensional direction of zero curvature in m 4 g which infer the hopf conjecture 1 flag foliations take two two spheres s 2 and s 2 in a three dimensional euclidean space and denote by l and l two families of parallels on s 2 and s 2 which are correspondingly orbits of an s 1 action by rotation on the angle about the axe in space going through the north and south poles n and s of the sphere s 2 and similar s 1 action by rotation on the angle about the axe in space going through the north and south poles n and s of the sphere s 2 parameters and are altitudes and vary from 2 south poles to 2 north poles on the direct product m 4 s 2 s 2 the torus action s 1 s 1 is defined with orbits f 2 where f 2 l l and may be considered as coordinates of the points in m 4 for 2 2 these orbits are tori which degenerates to a circle when one of or converge to 2 or to one of the four fixed points of the torus action when both converge by an absolute value to 2 the square x 2 2 2 2 2 of all pairs is the space of all orbits of the torus action which we call the moduli space this family f 2 is a singular foliation of m 4 which we denote by f taking t we obtain the s 1 action on m 4 with orbits circles which provide wirings of every tori f 2 if t such an orbit issuing from the point with coordinates then all the points t t belong to the same orbit of this s 1 action and the circle has the homotopy class 1 1 in the fundamental group 1 f 2 of the torus f 2 l l generated by l and l parallels and meridians the family of these circles t we denote by it is a singular one dimensional foliation of m 4 at every regular point p of m except with 2 we have two vector spaces in the tangent space tp m two dimensional tangent to the foliation f and one dimensional subspace tangent to the foliation these vector spaces give a flag in tp m and we call the pair f the flag foliation next an arbitrary diffeomorphism f m 4 m 4 provides m 4 by a push forward construction with the pair of singular foliations which we denote by f and call the flag foliation 2 leaves of these foliations going through the point p of m 4 we denote by p t and fp correspondingly another notations are f 2 f f 2 and t f t by i t we denote the operator of a parallel translation in m 4 along p from the point p t to the point p assuming that parameter t on p is such that p p 0 to the tangent bundle tm 4 we associate two other bundles so the bundle with the fiber so 4 over p of orientation preserving isometries of tpm 4 and the grassmann bundle g of two planes with the fiber so 4 s 1 s 1 finely let t t be the tangent plane to fp at the point p t and h p denotes the length of the curve l t i t t t of two planes in the grassmann fiber gp over p obtained by parallel translations of t t along p to p then 1 1 h f max p f h and h m 4 g f min f h f considering one torus f we usually employ the pair t as coordinates on it and denote t simply by t then t t and l t denote correspondingly the family of tangent planes to the torus along t and the parallel transport of this family by i t to the initial point p 0 2 it appears that flag foliations are in a sense dual to open book decompositions see appendix 2 flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 3 besides the functional h f on leaves of the foliation f the second most important object we consider is the following vector field w 3 on the moduli space x of tori leaves f which is defined as follows each parallel translation i acts on its invariant planes and n by rotations on angles and then w is the profile curve of f and 1 2 w 2 0 d we may assume that this vector field is good i e it has only non degenerated zeroes inside the moduli space x 2 denote by ind x the index of zero x of w and set ind x 0 for non zeros finely 1 3 he m g f x x 2 ind x h f where x represent f in the moduli space x 2 4 below we show that for m 4 diffeomorphic to s 2 s 2 the index of the vector field w along the boundary of x equals one or it always has at least one zero inside x 2 in other cases say for s 4 the suspension over s 3 with a foliation by the clifford tori the field w has no zeroes note that slightly changing if necessary 5 we may assume that under a given smooth family f of diffeomorphisms zeros of w behave in a general way for all but a finite number i of instances of they are isolated and non degenerated while at each of the moment i the pair of zeros of opposite indexes 1 is born or annihilated this implies that our functional he m g f is continuous and with a possible exception of the set of i is differentiable on our nash process is diminishing h f on those leaves f which contribution to 1 2 is 1 we make sure that h f on leaves with contribution 1 which may be born together with a companion f of index 1 is not less than h f for this companion which is possible since they are born with equal h s since h of the two annihilating zeroes of w of opposite indexes are equal too this ensures the surviving of the zero f of w with index 1 and minimal h for all and since the zero of index 1 may annihilate only with popping up on h hight scale zero of index 1 which index 1 companion has smaller h and which we know exists at the beginning of the whole story during this process h m 4 g f may jump but only down and achieves its minimum zero on f all in the text below is about the holonomy operator so the following ambrose singer formula for the deformation of the holonomy operator plays a crucial role if t is the smooth family of closed curves w 0 is some vector field along 0 and w t i 1 t w 0 the parallel translation of w 0 along from 0 to t then 1 4 w 2 w 0 2 0 i t r v t t w t where v t is the variation field t 3 a field of directions actually since its coordinates are defined only up to the simultaneous change of a sign 4 note that 1 3 looks like the euler characteristic of some homology group related to m 4 i e the euler co cycle on a fundamental class of x 2 weighted by h 5 or introducing small fake holonomies 4 valery marenich 2 variations of h we study the behavior of our functional under the variations corrections silencing and tunings of the diffeomorphism f m 4 m 4 by taking compositions from the left f f with one parameter families of diffeomorphisms of m 4 6 families will be generated by vector fields v on m 4 below notations with subscript denote corresponding objects under the family of deformations f while x y or t t and others with pre scrip will denote the finite change usually of order o of the corresponding linear object let be the set of those f whereh h f which we call extremals i e those where our functional attains its maximum on the leaf for all other from the same leaf it holds h h the union of all with h h is an open set u f converging to the set of extremals as 0 since h continuously depends on and f the small variations of f inside u f does not affect h f so that 2 1 h f f 0 max h 0 i e in order to diminish the functional we should construct such corrections of f which diminish its value on extremals the only necessary restriction on our deformations is that they are tame or that they are chosen in such a way that their superposition converges to some smooth limit in the next section 3 we construct the curve f the nash process in the space diff m 4 m 4 of diffeo morphisms from m 4 to m 4 converging to the smooth solution f of the minimizing problem for h f to prove convergence we employ the theory of tame spaces and maps developed in h here we recall some facts of this theory we need below construct elementary deformations and verify tame estimates for them 2 1 the tame structure on diff m 4 m 4 it is known that the group of smooth diffeomorphisms diff m of an arbitrary smooth manifold has the structure of a fre chet manifold and is a fre chet lie group its lie algebra the tangent space at the identity map is the space c m of smooth vector fields on m with the bracket operation the usual lie bracket of vector fields in a similar way the set of all diffeomorphisms diff m 4 m 4 is also the fre chet manifold with the topology defined by the family of cn norms for the given diffeomorphism f m 4 m 4 the tangent space to this manifold may be identified with c m 4 or with c m 4 these are the spaces of vector fields v onm 4 and v on m 4 correspondingly in the construction of the nash process below we employ the smoothing operators s on these spaces one way to construct them is taking convolutions with smooth functions of small support and orthogonal to all polynomials in some fixed system of local coordinates up to some degree see g the chapter 2 2 3 the nash newton moser process pages 121 129 another equivalent way is to use the theory of the tame spaces and maps constructed in h according to which the tame structure on c m 4 may be introduced as follows embed m 4 into an open ball b 6 of the euclidean spaces m 4 b 6 r 6 and denote by c 0 c 0 r 6 r 6 the fre chet space of smooth functions w r 6 r 6 which all derivatives tend to zero at infinity with the topology given by a family of cn norms w n sup n sup m d w then we find a continuous extension operator c m 4 c 0 such that v n c v cn 6 another equivalent way is by taking compositions from the right f f with one parameter families of diffeomorphisms of m 4 but then tame estimates follow after longer arguments flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 5 say choose tubular neighborhoods of m 4 in r 6 extend v to be constant along the fibres and cut off with a smooth bump function if i inclusion restriction then iv n c v n and v n c v n and we have c m 4 c 0 b 4 i c 0 c m 4 where the long composition above is the identity map with the help of the fourier transform fr the map i may be factored through the fre chet spaces l 1 r 6 r 6 d log 1 with the family of norms w n enlog 1 w d as c 0 b 4 fr l 1 r 6 r 6 d log 1 fr 1 c 0 as in h the maps fr and fr 1 are tame i e satisfy the following estimates 7 fr 1 w n c w n and fr w n c w n r for some r which shows that c m 4 with a family of cn norms as above is tame see again h pages 136 138 for details in the tame space which can be identified with the space b of sequences wl in some banach space b with wl n enl wl b the smoothing operators have very simple form s wk s l wl where s is a smooth function which equals 1 for 0 0 for 1 and 0 s 1 in between for 0 1 8 in the same way we construct the smoothing operators s on the space c m 4 of smooth vector fields on m 4 both smoothing operators satisfy the following estimates 2 1 1 s v n cen m v m and i s v m cem n v n see h page 176 similarly using some isometric embedding m 4 rn the tame structure and smoothing operators are introduced for m 4 2 1 2 smoothing deformations our deformations will be localized near some leaf f in its open neighborhood o in coordi nates t i e o t f where 2 2 2 it is important not to forget that in order to be smoothing operators as above our corrections should be written in corresponding coordinates in the euclidean space of the isometric embedding m 4 rn never theless for our convenience we write them in our coordinates since the necessary translation to coordinates in the euclidean space rn of the isometric embedding is obvious 7 the lost of differentiability is uniformly bounded 8 i e the smoothing is the cutting out higher harmonics from the function 6 valery marenich as above and n denote invariant planes of the parallel transport i along closed let also ei i 1 2 and ej j 3 4 be the orthonormal bases at 0 of and n correspondingly if we assume for the moment that that ei are smooth vector fields along closed meridian l on f then the functions xi below are smooth periodic on in general and n are uniquely correctly defined and depend smoothly on only for those where i 6 id i e on some disjoint union of open subintervals m m of the circle 0 2 the same is true for ei on the closed intervals m m 1 the vectors fields ei may be extended arbitrarily we choose them to provide the smooth if possible i e when m 6 m 1 as the result we will have ei t and xi t smoothly depending on t and with the exception of parallels on f given by m m 1 by ei t we denote the parallel transport of ei along from an initial point 0 to t remind that above we denoted by the angle of the rotation in moving ei 0 i 1 2 to ei 2 i 1 2 therefore the pair of vectors e i t i 1 2 obtained from ei t i 1 2 by rotation on angle t 2 provides us with the smooth vector fields over the leaf f in the same way the pair of vectors e j t j 3 4 obtained from ej t i 3 4 by rotation on angle t 2 provides us with two more smooth vector fields over the leaf f complementing e i t i 1 2 to the moving orthonormal base of the tangent space to m 4 over the leaf f now x t always denote the unit vector parallel to t y t unit vector tangent to f at the point t and normal to x t while z t and w t an orthonormal base of the plane normal to f at t the functions we are going to smooth are 2 1 2 xi t t 0 t e i t dt t 2 2 0 t e i t dt i 1 4 the functions xi t are 2 periodic functions on and t we split them into the fourier series 2 1 3 xi t ai sin t k l 2 aik sin kt b i k cos kt i 1 4 then our smoothing operators act by cutting out all with the exception of the lowest one harmonics from these function silencing the torus note that if 2 1 3 contains only the first harmonic or the torus f is mono tone then the corresponding curves l t of the tangent planes in the grassmannian fibers are geodesic lines and vise versa we need to check only that this is possible to do by f by deforming the diffeomorphism f micro h principle and that these deformations diminish our functional h note that we should consider only variations of totally zero charge preserving the mean value zero of xi in 2 1 1 we start with the following deformations of this kind take the deformation of f localized in a neighborhood of some point p and given by a shape vector field v ei where is a function with a small support around p and such that its integrals over are zero say let in coordinates t the restriction of on f is t sin t t 0 cos 0 for some 0 0 2 0 t 0 2 and is sufficiently big such that the support of is inside the open coordinate rectangular 0 2 0 t 2 first we note that ei t are almost stable under such deformations if e i t are the vector fields defined for f in the same way as above then the following is true lemma 2 1 1 e i t ei t 1 2 for some universal constant 1 flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 7 proof it follows from the ambrose singer formula 1 4 since the oriented area of the deformation is zero the integral of the restriction of t over is zero an easy estimate integration by parts shows that the norm of the variation of the holonomy operator is small 2 1 4 i i 2 supp where supp denotes the diameter of the support of and the constant 2 depends on the norm of the derivative of the curvature operator sup t r v t t the estimate 2 1 4 implies the claim of the lemma the lemma is proved next we note that from the equality of mixed derivatives 2 t f t 2 t f t and 2 f t 2 f t follows that variations of the vectors fields x y are given by 2 1 5 x t xv t o 2 and x t xv t o 2 combining the lemma 2 1 1 and the last formulas we conclude the following lemma 2 1 2 xi t xi t t 0 t v t e i t dt 3 supp for some universal constant 3 proof indeed for the proof it is sufficient to note that the variation of the last term of 2 1 2 the mean value of xi is of the order supp by the same oriented area zero arguments as in proving 2 1 4 above the lemma is proved now we see that the variation f generated by the vector field 2 1 6 v ei where t sin t t 0 cos 0 gives the following correction to the xi 2 1 7 xi t sin t t 0 cos 0 4 for some universal 4 for further references we may call this micro h principle we defined our variations on the given leaf f in a standard way it is continued on its open neighbor hood o for an appropriate of the order preserving estimates above obviously variations of the type 2 1 6 for large generate the space of all harmonics with frequencies bigger than which would allow us due to 2 1 4 to get rid of all higher harmonics without increasing much the functional h this would be equivalent to the action of a smoothing operator s on f 8 valery marenich 2 2 basic variations for convenience we divide our corrections into two types 9 1 silencing as above i e such that f almost does not change the holonomy operator see 2 1 4 in this case the corresponding deformation of the curve of tangent planes l t is the deformation with almost fixed end points 2 tunings the new type of deformations changing the holonomy operators and shortening the profile curve w of the given torus but almost preserving the integral w f in this case if l t is almost a geodesic the corresponding deformation diminishes the distance between its end points 2 2 1 silencing deformations straightening the curve of tangent planes two bundles over m 4 of the grassmannians g and isometries so are associated to the tangent bundle tm 4 of m 4 and naturally inherit the connection or the parallel translation which we denote again by i t the parallel translation identifies restrictions g t and so t of the bundles g and so to the curve with the point p deleted with the direct metric products gp 0 2 and sop 0 2 or with the metric products with closed interval if we double the point p and fibers over it correspondingly the section t t of the grassmann bundle g t of two planes over is identified with the section l t t of the direct product gp 0 2 slightly abusing notations below we use this identification with the direct metric products when working in g t and so t e g covariant derivative t now is the derivative on t in the metric products gp 0 2 and sop 0 2 while x t y t is an orthonormal base of l t l t x t y t the tangent space to the grassmann fiber g t at the point x t y t is generated by four vectors axz t x t y t axw t x t w t ay z t y t z t and ayw t y t w t these vectors are images under the natural projection so t g t of the generators of isometry transformations of t t m 4 rotations in corresponding planes e g let soxz be a rotation with a unit speed of t t m 4 in the plane x t z t about the fixed plane y t w t then the vector axz t equals the image of the derivative of so at 0 under the differential of naturally we assume that g is endowed with the metric such that so t g t is a riemannian submersion where the metric on so is given by the standard lipschitz killing form for a skew symmetric matrix a aij it holds a 2 i j a 2 ij in this metric axz axw ay z ayw is an orthonormal base of the tangent space to the grassmannian fiber g for a given instant t the derivative of l t on t may be written as s t l t where s t is the generator of a one parameter subgroup so t of so t such that 2 2 1 l t so t l t o where s t d d so t 0 s t stands for the second form of f in the direction t we denote by t and n t invariant subspaces of so t and by ei i 1 2 3 4 an orthonormal base of t t m such that ei i 1 2 generates t while ei i 3 4 n t in this base so t is given by block diagonal matrix acting with respect to on invariant subspaces by rotations on t and t correspondingly where t and t are some constants speed of rotations depending on t 2 2 2 so t cos t sin t 0 0 sin t cos t 0 0 0 0 cos t sin t 0 0 cos t sin t to simplify computations instead of axz axw ay z ayw we use another orthonormal base eij ei ej i j 1 2 3 4 provided by ei in this base the geodesic curvature of the curve l t is easy to compute 9 whether the deformation field v is transversal or tangent to the torus flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 9 lemma 2 2 1 for the geodesic curvature gc t of the curve l t it holds 2 2 3 gc t 2 t 2 t r t where r t rij t 1 i 2 j 4 is the matrix of covariant derivatives 2 2 4 rij t d dt s t ei ej proof geodesic curvature of the curve l measures its deviation from the geodesic line if l is the geodesic issuing from the same initial point l 0 and speed l o as the curve l then the vector l l i e the unit direction of the minimal geodesic going from l to l multiplied by the distance between l and l equals up to higher order terms the vector gc of the geodesic curvature of l at l 0 multiplied by 2 2 times the square of the speed l 0 2 to see this take the second derivative of l l on at zero for instance what is the geodesic curvature of the curve of isometries so sending l 0 to l at the instance t from 2 2 1 it follows that the geodesic we should compare to is the one parameter family so t of isometries the speed equals s t 2 t 2 t and the second derivative of the vector so t so t on at zero is d dt s t the last vector tangent to the bundle so of isometries under the submersion to g goes to the vector r t from which the claim of the lemma follows lemma 2 2 1 is proved the idea is to construct the variation field v of f such that the corresponding variation l t is the vector parallel to the vector gc t of the geodesic curvature of the curve l t then the first variation formula would imply that the length of l t is decreasing under variation f an arbitrary vector tangent to g t 0 at the point t t 0 x t 0 y t 0 is a linear combination of four vectors azy t 0 awy t 0 axz t 0 and axw t 0 denote by vzy t 0 the variation field 2 2 5 vzy t 0 t 1 i sin t t 0 cos 0 z 0 t 0 ei 0 t 0 ei t for coordinates t in the coordinate rectangular t t 0 and 0 2 and zero elsewhere from 2 1 5 it follows that over the same rectangular x t 0 cos t t 0 cos 0 z t o and 2 2 6 t t 0 cos t t 0 cos 0 z t y t correspondingly for sufficiently small or large 1 in order to have smooth f diffeomorphisms we smooth a little bit more v in say 1 10 neighborhood of the coordinate rectangular and obtain the variation we need in the same way we construct the variational field vwy giving the variation of t t in the direction w y and in a little bit more subtle way because y is not the coordinate field and interchanging functions sin t and cos with cos t and sin if necessary variational fields vxz and vxw such that for the corresponding variations of the tangent plane t t are parallel to axz and axw correspondingly we summarize our arguments as follows 10 valery marenich lemma 2 2 2 for an arbitrary vector rij t 0 tangent to g t at t t there exists a tame deformation of f given by some tame vector field vij such that t t 0 t rij t where t good bump function with vanishing integrals over all using partition of unity an arbitrary vector field r t tangent to g t along t t may be presented as the sum of vector fields with small supports denote by the maximum size of such supports then construct r t sufficiently smooth approximating the unit vector field parallel to the geodesic curvature vector geod t of t t then the arguments above by linearity of the derivative lead to the following estimates 2 2 7 h t 1 5 2 0 geod t dt 5 for some universal positive 5 since we may choose the parameter converging to zero during the corrections the last estimate will guarantee the convergence of the nash process the constructed corrections diminish h 0 t of the one particular curve 0 by continuity the same is true for for from some neighborhood of 0 i e if the deformation vector field v implies the deformation t 0 t with an integral positive scalar product with a geodesic curvature vector of t 0 t then the scalar product of t t with the geodesic curvature vector of t t is still positive for from some neighborhood of 0 taking so small that the support of the deformation f lies in this neighborhood we define the deformation which diminish h in general case when the extremal is not necessarily isolated remark also that in the process of diminishing h we may at the same time deform f along other t diminishing h the limit of such deformations is the torus f where all curves l t of tangent planes are geodesics we call such torus f mono tone our next step is to deform this mono tone torus into the silent one 2 2 2 tunings deformations of the mono tone torus the sequence of corrections silencing f gives us the torus such that all corresponding to extremals curves t t of tangent planes are geodesics in this case whether the variation t t of a geodesic line shortens it or not depends on the difference of scalar products of the vectors of variations t with the unit speed t t of t at its end points therefore to further shorten t t and diminish h we may do the following boundary operator on flag foliations take a meridian l 0 of a torus and consider the grassmann bundle of two planes over it this bundle has two sections n we already defined and two sections t 0 and t 2 i t 0 of end points of the curves of tangent planes for each in the fiber g of this bundle the parallel translation i acts as a rotation about andn on angles and correspondingly i e for some one parameter group of rotations so t it holds so 2 i while t t is an 0 t 2 interval of the orbit of the action of this group on g we may further simplify the picture by doubling the point l 0 l 2 identifying the grassmann bundle g over the closed interval 0 2 with the direct product 0 2 g in such a way that and n be two parallel sections and projecting to g then in the grassmannian g we will have the curve l of tangent planes to the torus along the meridian l the beginning points of t t while the curve of end points l t 2 is obtained from l by the rotation so 2 i e these end points are connected by the geodesic t t so t l 0 t 2 note that the curve l in g is closed l 0 l 2 indeed and n are generated by e i t for t 0 and coincide for 0 2 this identifies 0 g with 2 g in the direct product bundle 0 2 g with and n parallel sections flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 11 we may clarify this picture further consider the direct product 0 2 tpm 4 as the trivial bundle over meridian l with the point p l 0 doubled and vector fields e i 0 i 1 4 parallel note also that our condition w 0 implies that the vector fields e i 2 in such a bundle have equal initial and end values e i 0 2 e i 2 2 since the angle between e i 0 and e i 2 in the corresponding invariant plane equals or who s integrals on vanish on the geometry of g remind that g can be identified with the direct product s 2 s 2 as follows let is generated by e 1 e 2 n by e 3 e 4 then any particular point l in g has the basis e 1 e 2 such that e 1 e 1 cos e 3 sin and e 2 e 2 sin e 4 cos and l is the image of under the composition of rotations on about the plane e 2 e 4 and on about the plane e 1 e 3 for a given the set of corresponding l is the torus t 2 in g similar to the above f and 2 2 gives the distance from to l the distance from l to n is 2 2 so that t 2 2 2 is the equidistant set of and n consider these functions they have equal end values 0 2 and 0 2 and considering the functional 2 2 8 2 0 2 2 d we may diminish it by construct deformations f as above this results in the mono tone torus f which is tuned i e such that the left end curve l would belong to some particular torus t 2 the parallel translations then draw a geodesic l t inside this torus connecting l with l another thing is that we may assume that this torus is t 2 2 2 i e is equidistant to and n indeed it is easy to see that for the mono tone torus its h functional is determined by the picture consisting of data l and so 2 2 9 h distg l so l next we note that in order to diminish distg l so l l we may construct the defor mations f which moves the curve l to one of the fixed points or n of all so rotations on g to be more precise first we check that if distg l 6 distg n l then the deformation f such that again 1 the holonomy is almost stable with zero oriented area as above and 2 l moves toward if distg l distg n l or toward n if distg l distg n l diminish h i e the distance between end points t 0 and t 2 indeed connect these endpoints l and l with by some minimal geodesics l s and l s and consider a deformation f such that the corresponding l equals the unit direction of l s at s 0 if again the variation of the holonomy operator i under such deformation vanishes is small then l equals the unit direction of l s at s 0 i e under such deformation the end points l and l moves along the sides of the triangle in g with vertices l and l when distg l distg n l the angles l and l of this triangle are less than 2 and the first variation formula implies 2 2 10 distg l l distg l l is it possible to construct such a deformation i e satisfying two properties above yes such deformation f may be constructed with a small support take v t sin t on t and zero elsewhere 12 valery marenich the change of the holonomy operator is small i o if the angles t 0 t 2 of the triangle t 0 t 2 in gp which are equal are strictly less than 2 this gives 2 2 10 for sufficiently small 10 we formulate the obtained result as follows lemma 2 2 3 if distg l 6 distg n l then there always exist a correction f diminishing the h for all from some neighborhood of i e such that 2 2 10 holds therefore from now on till the end of this section we may assume that the angles l and l in the triangle l l in g equal 2 or that l t lie in the torus tr 2 2 in g equidistant to and n 2 4 the final steps include the fine tuning deformations along the tangent vector fields x and y i e which is equivalent to re parametrization of the extremal torus f to picture these tunings call the union a t of all curves l t which are geodesics l t so t l in g connecting l with l the annulus of f on t 2 2 2 in g with boundary curves l and l then deformations along x will change the inner boundary l to l t tune with the corresponding move of the outer boundary l to l 2 tune where l t for t 2 is the point on the geodesic so t l which is defined for all t the deformations along y change the parameter which will result in the different correspondence between start and end points under such deformation the end l is l see details below by definition h equals the distance from the start point l to the end point l in a t now a simple picture of the deformations of a t as above 1 moves along geodesics l t and 2 independent rotations of boundary curves l to the end point l in a t by changing the parameter on them proves that h could be easily diminished unless 1 it is identically zero or 2 the inner and outer curves l and l are two points connected by a single geodesic l t l t which implies that the vector w is constant and not zero since the last case contradicts our condition 2 2 11 integral of w on is zero this proves that our fine tuning will ultimately results in the silent torus f with h f 0 this proves the lemma 2 2 4 below let us provide some details for this procedure how the deformation may affect the holonomy operator again by ambrose singer formula the local deformation f around the point t 0 leads to the variation of and changes the holonomy by an extra push i exp r v x inserted in t 0 for instance by definition t 2 is the parallel transport of t 0 along and after the deformation f will be generated by the vectors x x and y y where x equals the integral of r v x x and y equals the integral of r v x y if the restriction of the deformation vector field v on t is supported on the interval t 0 t 0 then all t t and l t for every t from the interval t 0 may be affected i e the local variation f may lead to the global deformation of the curve t t assuming that the curve t t after all our deformations above is already a geodesic the first variation formula says that the deformation f shortens its length i e 2 10 holds if the direction r f x of the generator of the additional rotation i has negative scalar product with the direction t 2 11 remind that for a given torus f its profile curve is w where each parallel translation i acts on its invariant planes and n by rotations on angles and 10 when those angles equal 2 the first derivative of the distance in gp under the deformation above is zero but the second is negative therefore 2 2 10 would follow if we could further up to o 2 reduce the affect of the change of the holonomy indeed assuming that under some local deformation f the extra push in the holonomy operator generated by r f x as we described above moves t 2 not normal to the direction of t t at t 2 then changing f to f if needed we obtain shortening deformation if not i e all t 2 under i are normal to t 2 then the change of the holonomy has reduced affect still to obstacle such deformation might the impossibility to choose correctly the deformation direction toward or n for all together 11 correspondingly the stationary of the functional h provides the orthogonality equalities for the curvature tensor of m 4 flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 13 correspondingly remind also that we consider only the torus such that 2 2 11 w 2 0 d 0 or with a profile which center of gravity lies in the origin next we omit from notations for simplicity and denote by w the speed w w of the profile curve in the plane reprove the ambrose singer formula let t be some deformation of the curve t with v t t 0 the deformation field let e t be a vector field parallel along t i e te t 0 since vector fields t and commute it holds by the definition of the curvature tensor t e t r t e t if d t is any vector field along t and d t denotes its parallel transport i t from the point t to 0 along then again by the definition of the parallel transport it holds d dt d t i t td t and d 2 d 0 2 0 i t td t dt applying this to the vector field d t e t 0 we get the ambrose singer formula 1 4 as follows 2 2 12 ambrose singer i 2 e 2 0 e 0 0 2 0 i t r t e 0 t dt now we apply this formula to the vector fields e i t and obtain formulas for the speed of the profile curve recall that these fields are obtained by rotating with a constant speed 2 and 2 the pairs ei t for i 1 2 and 3 4 bases of invariant planes and n correspondingly of parallel vector fields along t 0 t 2 in order to have smooth vector fields on closed t 0 t 2 with 0 2 by this definition e i t i 1 2 and e i t i 3 4 are projections on invariant planes and n correspondingly of orbits under the action of the one parameter group s o t exp ts 2 generated by the block matrix s which in the basis ei has the form s 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 the ambrose singer formula above gives the variation of s o t and applying the first variation formula we conclude that the derivatives of are the scalar products of the derivative of the holonomy operator i on with this vector i e the following is true 2 0 i t r t e 1 t e 2 t dt 14 valery marenich and 2 0 i t r t e 3 t e 4 t dt if we denote by t the area element of the torusf in coordinates t and byr t i t r t e 1 t e 2 t and rn t i t r t e 3 t e 4 t we get the following formula 2 2 13 2 0 t r t dt and 2 2 14 2 0 t rn t dt where r t and rn t are functions on the torus and do not depend on its particular parametrization by t like t of course the same formulas are true for an arbitrary deformation f given by the vector field v i e 2 2 15 0 2 0 i t r t v t e 1 t e 2 t dt and 2 2 16 0 2 0 i t r t v t e 3 t e 4 t dt fine tunings along x what happens under deformations along x is obvious if the vector field v is parallel to x i e v t tune t x then 0 tune 0 at this point the invariant planes tune 0 and n tune 0 are parallel transports of 0 and n 0 along while the tangent plane t 0 t tune 0 is the image of the parallel transport of t 0 under rotation so tune 0 i e corresponds to l tune 0 in our trivialization of the grassmann bundle as above the corresponding move of the outer boundary is l to l 2 tune where l t for t 2 is the point on the geodesic so t l which is defined for all t in all we see that considered deformations f along x move inner and outer curves of a t in the directions of geodesics l t at t 0 2 correspondingly in g with a speed given by the functions tune 0 and tune 2 fine tunings along y we define as f generated by 2 17 v t tune t t with tune t smooth equals one or minus one over all and t 2 but vanishing on the boundary of the coordinate rectangular 2 2 0 2 for small it holds 2 2 18 0 2 0 tune t t r t dt flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 15 and 2 2 19 0 2 0 tune t t rn t dt comparing with 2 2 13 and 2 2 14 we see that the effect of such tuning is that we act on the curve l not by rotations so t but almost by so t or so t resulting effectively in the change of the parameter to or correspondingly on the inner boundary curve if the angle between l and the direction of l t at t 0 is acute such tuning is diminishing the distance between end points of l t if the angle is obtuse use the tuning almost equal to minus one taking three points l i i 1 2 3 not on the same line we easily balance tunings defined in neighbor hoods of these points to keep the center of gravity of the profile curve at zero and shortening profile at the same time again obviously the only stationary under described deformations are straight segments but if is closed curve as in our case the deformation is always possible the profile straightening is a tame deformation indeed f might be very big compare to the change of the profile if only the curvature generators vanish but then the curve would be of almost zero curvature on the other hand it is inside some disk in the plane in its vertices the curvature is less than the inverse radius of the boundary circle which is bounded we formulate the obtained result as follows lemma 2 2 4 on local minimum if h f 6 0 for the mono tone torus f such that w 0 then there exists the fine tuning deformation f diminishing h f let us repeat again it is not clear immediately that our deformations are smoothing operators as we defined in the section 2 1 above for our convenience we defined them in t coordinates i e which is different from the definition in 2 1 as we note above we should consider the isometric embedding m 4 rn and translate our constructions to euclidean coordinates in rn 3 the nash process 3 0 standard assumptions according to our general scheme we first 1 connect the given metric g on m 4 with the standard metric of the direct product g on m 4 s 2 s 2 by some family of smooth metrics g 0 1 and then choose some partition 0 1 n 1 such that the sequence of values h f m 4 g k is sufficiently dense and starts with zero see 5 1 5 2 in the section 5 below this is done with the sole purpose to prove that the minimal value h f is not achieved on the singular torus i e for from the boundary of x if we would already know this we would not need any sequence g k and could start right with the given metric g 2 second besides conditions 5 1 and 5 2 the sequence g k should consists of the metrics satisfying some transversality conditions which guarantee as we wrote above that under the given smooth family of corrections f zeroes of w behave in a general way for all but a finite number i of instances of they are isolated and non degenerated while at each of the moment i the pair of zeros of opposite indexes 1 is born or annihilated such bumpy metrics could be constructed explicitly in a standard way taking partitions of unity and then adding small perturbations which make the holonomy the operator of the general type or this may be achieved by adding to the holonomy operator i small fake holonomies i converging to zero as 0 16 valery marenich 3 1 corrections sequences to diminish the functional we consider tori with positive contributions to the sum 1 3 and construct corrections f around their extremals s 3 1 first step assume that for every extremal we find a variational vector field v as above in 2 2 1 in some neighborhood u such that the derivative of h f on for the variation of f given by v is negative using continuous dependence of h and its derivatives on find possibly smaller neighborhood where such derivatives for other in this smaller neighborhood still negative say less then the half of the derivative for the extremal then find a finite covering ui of the extremal set by these neighborhoods and some partition of unity i corresponding to this covering ui such that i equals one in some smaller neighborhood of ui next consider the differential equation for f d d f ivi from the tame estimates above for the vector fields vi it follows the existence of the smooth solution of the above equation on some small interval 0 f 0 see h as we already mentioned our corrections may be chosen to generate the morse type or shortening deformations t of the curves t in the grassmann bundle g over m 4 in the same way as the morse deformations gives in the limit a geodesic line the above equation admits a solution f converging to some f 1 with the extremals t such that corresponding curves of planes l t in g 0 are geodesics 3 2 the second step is to apply deformations of the types 2 2 2 again for every extremal with l t being a geodesic define v as in 2 2 2 above find a small neighborhood u of where derivatives of the h are sufficiently negative and proceed as above continue f 1 over some small interval to a family of diffeomorphisms f 1 0 1 deformations for the case when all s on the given torus are extremals we described above in 2 2 4 these 3 1 and 3 2 are two building blocks of our nash process we do a sequence of successive corrections applied to an initial diffeomorphism f and then consecutive intermediate diffeomorphisms the correction process has an infinite sequence of stages each stage is like any other stage and consists of two steps first we apply the possibly infinite number of steps 3 1 to obtain f 1 from f correspondingly during the first step in the number k 1 stage we construct fk 1 from fk k the second step is then apply 3 2 to get f 1 1 from f 1 and correspondingly fk k from fk during the second step in the stage with number k applying this double induction we end up with the extremal map f and some leaf f stationary under the above described variations for which it holds h f 0 non degeneracy of f is a very important claim which we establish next together with another crucial fact the index one of w on x providing us with zeroes of index 1 inside x 4 non collapsing boundary estimates 4 1 the crucial fact we use below is that our functional h f does not vanish on the boundary of a parameter space when some or both parameters or converge by an absolute value to 2 i e when the tori leaf f degenerates to the circle or a point the value of the functional h f stays bounded from below by some positive constant kcollapse 12 for arbitrary given diffeomorphism f to see this we assume the contrary 4 1 h f 0 12 like 2 flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 17 and consider first the case when only one of the parameters say converge to 2 while stays bounded by an absolute value from it then f converges to the circle f l which we denote by l the second case is when f converge to the point one of the four fixed points of the s 1 action singular points of first case we divide further into two subcases first is when the operator il is not identity then the splitting of the tangent space to m 4 into the sum of invariant subspaces and n is correctly defined for all curves close to l e g from our family on all tori in the considered family converging to l hence this splitting is defined over the union of f close to l for instance in some tubular neighborhood of l from 4 1 we see that all translations i for close enough to l almost preserve tangent planes to f which means that each tangent plane is close to corresponding or n because the family of tangent planes is continuous while the distance from to n is a positive constant 2 this means that all tangent planes of f are close say to i e converge to the family of parallel planes l t along l since l t belongs to l t as the limit of vectors tangent to f the plane l t is generated by l t and another unit vector field y y normal to l t consider the annulus the film s t expl t sy t this film is normal to the n distribution along l t therefore the normal projection on it of an arbitrary f sufficiently close to l will be an almost projection along normal subspaces to f i e a regular immersion of a tori into the annulus s t which is impossible second subcase when il id is a little bit more involved now the splitting of the tangent spaces tpm 4 into the sums of two invariant subspaces and n is no longer defined instead we may verify that 4 1 now implies not only that the tangent spaces are almost parallel along t from but separately each of the vector fields x t and y t too indeed the f is the boundary of the image of the direct product under the smooth diffeomorphism f of the product of the circle l t and a small two disk b 2 around some point pole in s 2 the tangent plane to this disk goes under the differential of f into the family of two subspaces along l t which we denote n t if we denote by lt f l t b 2 meridian lines of f then tangent vectors to these meridians are close to n t let y t be a unit tangent vector to the meridian lt at lt and x t denotes as before the unit tangent vector to the curve from our one dimensional foliation at the same point note that by the definition the curve t issuing at t 0 from l 0 satisfies t lt t so that 4 1 means that the tangent plane t t generated by x t and y t is almost parallel along lines with coordinates t t 0 t 2 combining the facts that 1 under the parallel translation i t the plane t t t is almost parallel due to 4 1 2 this plane is generated by x t t and y t t 3 that all x t t for different close to the same vector l t while the collection of y t t for all tangent to meridians is close to the whole circle of unit vectors in the plane n t 4 all parallel transports i t along different in f converge to the same operator il t parallel transport along l we inevitably conclude that the parallel translation i t not only by 4 1 transport the plane t t t close to t 0 but also that i t x t t is close to x 0 which in particular means in the limit as 0 that il t l t l 0 or that l t is a geodesic since the collection of all possible y t t close to n t and i almost preserving x t t transport t t t close to t 0 generated by x 0 close to l 0 and y 0 we conclude that in the limit 0 all transports i preserve the family n i n t n 0 i e n t is parallel along l then the orthogonal complement z t to the three space generated by l t and n t gives a parallel vector field along l compare now y 0 with the vector filed y t obtained by the parallel translations from lt along parallels of the tori these parallel s are l t f l t l if n t denotes the direction of the minimal geodesic connecting l t with lt radius and n t its projection on n t then n t is always transversal to the projection of y t on the same n t from which and il id again it is easy to conclude that for each 0 t 2 there exist a homotopy ht from a normalized unit projections on n 0 of the vector field y t to y 0 continuously depending on t now we get our contradiction as follows the unit projection of the vector field y 0 tangent to the meridian on n 0 gives a map of degree one of the meridian to the circle of unit vectors in n 0 from the 18 valery marenich above arguments it follows that it is homotopic to the map y obtained as follows y is the parallel translation of y 0 0 first along 0 to 0 and then back to l 0 along parallel l note that by ambrose singer theorem y coincides with the parallel transport y of y 0 0 along the meridian to l 0 up to the error proportional to the area of the triangle with sides parallel l and meridian i e is small or y is homotopic to y 0 for small since y is null homotopic for small this contradicts the fact that y 0 has degree one the second last case left is when the tori f converge to the point p let f f be such a sequence denote by d the diameter of this tori f and re scale the metric of m 4 in small neighborhood of p by d 2 in this new metric the family f has constant diameter 1 and converges to the image of the direct product of two circles in flat r 2 r 2 under the differential of f at p f p p then 4 1 would imply that h t 2 0 for the standard tori we may see that this is not true in yet another way in the standard tori t 2 x y z w x 2 y 2 1 z 2 w 2 1 r 4 consider the curve t issuing from 0 1 0 1 in the direction 1 0 1 0 2 and find the curve t in f c 1 close to it if h t is small then the tangent plane of f is almost parallel along t implying that the derivative of the y coordinate of is small or y t stays close to 1 therefore can not intersect the parallel of f close to 0 1 cos t sin t in t 2 which is impossible since the homotopy class of in 1 f is 1 1 while the parallel is in 0 1 i e they must intersect each other 4 2 now consider the vector field w for the standard direct product of two two spheres we easily see that invariant planes and n are generated by the tangent planes to the factors of this direct product and that w sin sin 13 as we ve just seen under the change of the metric the maximum of h on does not go to zero which implies that some w also stay bounded away from the origin since all parallel transports i for collapsing tori thin or converging to a point converge to each other this implies that the integral w of w also is bounded from zero or that the vector field w does not vanish on the boundary hence it is homotopic to the initial one or has index one 4 2 ind w x 1 5 the hopf conjecture connect the given metric g on m 4 with the standard metric of the direct product g on m 4 s 2 s 2 by some family of smooth metrics g 0 1 for 0 the metric g 0 g admits the silent f leaf with h id 0 it is the product of equators of the factors s 2 and s 2 the totally geodesic torus as we already mentioned when defining h for the general family of metrics h f m 4 g continuously depends on hence for some small 1 and all 0 1 it holds h f m 4 g kcollapse where kcollapse is the constant from the previous chapter which implies that corresponding f is a regular tori if it exists further find a partition 0 1 n 1 such that 5 1 h f m 4 g k 1 h f m 4 g k kcollapse 2 and 5 2 h f m 4 g 1 h f m 4 g n 0 and such that g k k 1 n satisfy the standard assumptions applying the nash process we can establish by induction that h f m 4 g k 0 for all k and taking 0 that h f m 4 g 1 0 too for each we have the regular tori f of some flag foliation f on m 4 g n under some diffeomorphism f such 13 again by gauss bonnet theorem flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 19 that h f 0 by gauss theorem its extrinsic curvature vanish i e the integral of the inner gaussian curvature of f equals the integral of the sectional curvature of m 4 tangent to the tori since by the gauss bonnet theorem the integral of its inner curvature of any tori equals zero the sectional curvature of m 4 g n vanishes somewhere on f hence by continuity the same is true for m 4 g and the hopf hypothesi follows appendix 1 flag distributions functionals a 1 1 the text above is an application of a more general concept flag distributions functionals originally they were suggested for the construction introducing the metric and the hodge star operator on any manifold endowed with two flag distributions there the non integrability of distributions plays an important role for our particular purposes though we studied here a manifold endowed with only one flag distribution which is integrable a flag foliation i e we used half of the construction but already charged with some metric the flag foliation on a riemannian manifold mn g is defined when at every point x we have a flag of vector spaces v 1 v 2 vk in the tangent space txm such that each distribution vi is the tangent one to some foliation fi of the manifold m we say that the collection fi i 1 k is the k flag of foliations on m in general we allow foliations to be singular hence the dimension of a particular distribution vi is not constant but only semi continuous to give the idea of a flag foliation functional we restrict ourself to the simplest case of a flag of two foliations as above the pair f of a one and two dimensional foliations on m in this case the constructions of some other than h functionals may proceed as follows 1 relative integral and module h functionals first for an arbitrary curve s of the family denote by n its normal bundle in m by n the restriction of the normal bundle of f to and by g the grassmann bundle of codimf subspaces in n by s we denote the natural lift of s into g where s equals n s is the normal to f subspace at the point s denote by the riemannian connection of m and by or simply by when it does not lead to a confusion the component of normal to in other words for an arbitrary vector field y s along a 1 1 y s y s where denotes the component of the vector normal to this connection defines a metric in g as follows for an arbitrary curve l s in g i e the curve of codim f subspaces in the curve n of codim subspaces connection induces connection on g which we denote also by and such that l s is tangent to g s the norm of this vector in the natural metric on the grassmannian g s say coming from the riemannian submersion from o n equals the norm of l s in the case we consider in this note is a curve in some leaf f of the two dimensional foliation f of the four dimensional m then g is a bundle over of two subspaces in the bundle n over of three subspaces i e subspaces normal to in m let y s be a unit vector field normal to and tangent to f and w s z s be some unit and normal to each other vector fields along normal to f then s is the curve of two subspaces generated by w s z s in the three subspace n s generated by y s w s z s since s is uniquely determined by the vector y s in our case the norm of l s simply equals the norm of s y s a 1 2 l s 2 s y s 2 s y s w s 2 s y s z s 2 take for a particular curve s 0 s 1 from a 1 3 tmava f 1 0 l s 2 ds 20 valery marenich and a 1 4 stmava m f sup tmava where tmav a is t ma va f for the surface f from f which contains we say that the flag foliation f admits an invariant transversal measure if the foliation f admits an invariant transversal measure d f and almost d f everywhere the sub family f of our curves in the given leave f of f is also measurable then the integral over all is correctly defined in this case we take a 1 5 tmava m f f f tmava f d fd f let l 2 be the energy of if to denote tmav a f 2 l 2 then instead of a 1 3 another obvious choice is etmava f 2 l 2 2 l 2 accordingly we obtain another functionals s tmava m f by taking instead or sup norm as in a 1 4 over all or e tmava m f an integral l 2 norm as in a 1 5 other interesting possibility might be the conformal functional a 1 6 ctmav a m f sup l 2 f l 2 1 where inf s s ds a 1 2 even more interesting is the non commutative ntmav a m f one a la connes when is understood as an operator i e an element of the von neumann algebra w m f of bounded random operators acting as an integral above on sections of the hilbert bundle hx l 2 f x x f x see c 14 easy to see that our w is a remnant vector trace of some operator from w m f of this type when some m is endowed with a flag foliation f such that the moduli space x m f is not hausdorff say considering the rank problem which is the kind of the non commutative hopf conjecture this non commutative approach seems very naturale 2 further applications dutch category a 2 1 the text above may be understood as follows a one dimensional foliation defines the family of parallel transports i which in turn defines the distribution of two orthogonal plane fields and n invariant subspaces of i it defines an almost complex structure j on m 4 rotations on 2 about and n what we proved actually was that there exists a flag foliated diffeomorphism f m f m f admitting the silent leaf f which is 1 holomorphic 15 i e tangent to the one of the distributions of invariant subspaces of the almost complex structure j and 2 the almost complex structure is parallel along this leaf j 0 3 non collapsing in some important cases we can be sure that f is not degenerate 14 foliation immersions note that for more general than diffeomorphisms maps f m m the definition above may be still possible let m f be a manifold with a 2 flag foliation and f m m some differentiable map then the image of the flag foliation is not necessary a flag foliation due to possible degenerations of f but if f is regular enough say its restriction on every leaf f of f is an immersion f f f f then t ma v a m f is defined for every curve f for and correspondingly the supremum of all tma v a m f as in 4 the obtained number we denote by tma v a m f 15 another connection to the complex geometry may be through the identity between the grassmannian of two planes in r 4 and lines in cp 3 i e so 4 su 2 flag foliations functionals the hopf hypothesi 21 then our functional he appears count these holomorphic leaves with the help of the euler co cycle ind x acting on the fundamental class of the moduli space x 2 m 4 t 2 with weight h the whole text above then provides us with the existence of the holomorphic leaf by definition it is defined on the teichmu ller space t m metrics m 4 diff m 4 we may speculate a little bit more on how further complexification goes if we think of w as a new complex coordinate instead of in the moduli space x and assume that for some diffeomorphism f the corresponding h f is holomorphic in this new coordinates 16 then our functional is given by a 2 1 he m f g 1 2 x h w dw w a 2 2 possibly for bumpy metrics we may add many more objects of this type by changing the homotopy class of the wirings of the foliation f or taking another torus action onm 4 and then study how this collection f etazherka 17 behaves under the change of the class of the metric in t m which will gives as the functor from the category of paths in t m to our own this structures may play the role of the cut sets to double in order to decompose the manifold into simpler pieces note also that there exists an obvious duality between the classes of flag foliations and open book decompo sitions in the first one the disjoint union of lower dimensional leaves is the leaf of a higher dimension while in the second the intersection of disjoint leaves of a higher dimension is the leaf of a lower dimension this duality may be extended further to corresponding form descriptions of flag foliations and book decompositions if we call flag foliations closed books then f etazherka would be an appropriate place to store them it is also possible to composite both flag foliations and open book decompositions together say considering the open book whose pages are flag foliations etc references c allan connes noncommutative geometry g m gromov partial differential relations h richard s
