used by klainerman and machedon in their study of uniqueness of solutions for the gross pitaevskii hierarchy such estimates determine more general forms of stein weiss integrals involving restriction to smooth submanifolds analysis of the gross pitaevskii hierarchy has led to the development and application of functional analytic mappings for the rigorous description of many body interactions in quan tum dynamics in their formative and influential paper on uniqueness of solutions for the gross pitaevskii hierarchy klainerman and machedon determine uniform bounds for a three dimensional convolution integral the idea of their argument rests on an extension of the classical convolution for riesz potentials s 1 w g 1 y d where s is a smooth submanifold in rn w rm and the objective is to bound the size of the integral by an inverse power of w under suitable conditions on and such an estimate can be viewed as a step in the larger and dual program for understanding how smoothness controls restriction to a non linear sub variety see 1 two natural extensions to higher dimensions are suggested here w 2 rn rn xk 2 xn 2 w xk xk n 1 dx 1 dxn 1 w n 1 rn rn rn z 2 x 2 y 2 w x y z z x y n 1 dx dy dz 2 with the objective being to determine uniform bounds in terms of the variables 0 and w rn with n 1 here the prime on the symbol for sum product or sequence indicates that the last term should be dropped from the dilation character of the expression one can use uniformity to eliminate one variable so it suffices to consider 1 n w w 2 rn rn 1 xk 2 xn 2 w xk xk n 1 dx 1 dxn n w w n 1 rn rn rn 1 z 2 x 2 y 2 w x y z x y z n 1 dx dy dz one observes that the first expression is an extension of the classical convolution form g f 1 fn w g l 1 rn fk ln n 1 rn which is uniformly continuous and in the class c 0 r n using the riemann lebesgue lemma here the convolution for lebesgue classes is replaced by riesz potentials but the multivariable integration is constrained to be on a hyperbolic surface invariant under action by the indefinite orthogonal group 1 http arxiv org abs 1111 3857 v 2 2 william beckner theorem 1 n w is bounded for n 3 n w is bounded for n 2 the argument for the proof of theorem 1 will be developed in several steps and will be reduced to the second statement when the dimension is at least four note that 3 3 and this is the case determined by klainerman and machedon proof step 1 for n 2 2 w is unbounded this case is instructive and will identify the method used later in the proof of the second part 2 w w 2 r 2 1 w y 2 y 2 1 w y 1 y dy w 2

n 2 n 2 1 1 hence n w is bounded for n 3 if n w is bounded for n 3 an intriguing feature of this argument is that n 1 is the unique uniform inverse power where one can preserve dilation invariance and obtain a reduction of this type that connects bounds for integrals of the form n n perhaps this circumstance reflects a larger underlying symmetry in addition to the correspondence with the property that the convolution of n functions in ln n 1 rn will be uniformly continuous 4 william beckner step 3 consider n 2 2 w w r 2 r 2 1 w x 2 x y 2 y 2 w x x y y 1 dx dy w r 2 dx r 2 dy 1 w x 2 x 2 2 x y

the variable x r then 2 w c r 2 x 1 1 4 x 2 1 2 x 1 1 2 dx which is a convergent integral as one sees by using polar coordinates hence 2 w is uniformly bounded the option to directly use rearrangement

convolution estimates and the gross pitaevskii hierarchy 5 observe that the integrands for both expressions treated here n w and n w are func tions only of lengths and polar angles so that facilitates

2 this completes the proof of theorem 1 as noted above the inverse power x n 1 has a special role for the convolution estimates discussed here still the two dimensional result from the lemma is suggestive that useful bounds might be obtained for inverse powers close to n 1 consider for 0 and w rn w rn rn xk 2 xn 2 w xk xk dx 1 dxn 3 for dilation invariance p 2 n n 1 with the further requirement of positivity for the possibility of boundedness that means n 1 n 1 2 n so that asymptotically a n 1 for large dimension the upper bound is required by the nature of the proof for uniform boundedness as with theorem 1 the proof for uniform bounds will depend on a reduced integral form w rn rn x 2 y 2 w x y x y dx dy 4 here 2 2 n for dilation invariance for both forms it suffices to show uniform bounds for 1 and in two dimensions they are the same and already proved in the argument for the lemma theorem 2 for n 2 2 2 n and n 1 2 n 1 n w w rn rn 1 x 2 y 2 w x y x y dx dy is uniformly bounded for w rn proof let n 2 n w w rn 1 w y 2 y 2 w y y dy 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 w 1 1 0 1 w 2 2 w ru r 2 1 2 rn 1 1 u 2 n 3 2 dr du n 1 222 n n 1 2 w 2 1 w 2 2 n 1 1 0 1 u n 3 2 u n 1 2 1 1 2 u w

note that 2 2 theorem 3 for n 3 2 n n 1 and n 1 n 1 2 n n w w rn rn 1 xk 2 xn 2 w xk xk dx 1 dxn is uniformly bounded for w rn convolution estimates and the gross pitaevskii hierarchy 7 proof the argument here rests on the boundedness of n following the method of step 2 in the proof of theorem 1 for n 3 use the second delta function for the variable xn 1 and write n w w r n rn n 2 copies n 2 xk w n 2 xk w n 2 xk rn 1 xk 2 w xk y 2 y 2 w xk y y dy dx 1 dxn 2 cn w rn rn n 2 xk w n 2 xk dx 1 dxn 2 where cn sup v v rn v y 2 y 2 v g y dy sup w n w and in the earlier expression 1 n 2 xk 2 and v w n 2 xk then n w cn w rn rn xk w xk dx 1 dxn 2 with the integral w rn rn xk w xk dx 1 dxn 2 being constant in w so that n w is bounded for n 3 if n w is bounded for n 3 in surveying the estimates outlined above the critical computation would seem to be the surface integral s 1 w y 1 y dv which then the convolution algebra for riesz potentials allows an extended multilinear result for

1 i 2 n 1 relabel this ai as n 1 then n w rn rn 1 xk 2 xn 2 w xk xk k xn dx 1 dxn is uniformly bounded for w rn proof as in theorem 3 the argument here rests on the uniform boundedness of w rn rn x 2 y 2 w x y x n 1 y dx dy for 0 and w rn which is determined by theorem 4 for n 3 use the second delta function for the variable xn 1 and write with n 1 2 n n w r n rn n 2 copies n 2 xk k w n 2 xk w n 2 xk rn 1 xk 2 w xk y 2 y 2 w xk y n 1 y dx 1 dxn 2 cn w rn rn n 2 xk k w n 2 xk dx 1 dxn 2 where cn sup v v rn v y 2 y 2 v y n 1 y and in the earlier expression 1 n 2 xk 2 and v w n 2 xk then n w cn w rn rn xk k w xk dx 1 dxn 2 with the integral w rn rn xk k w xk dx 1 dxn 2 being constant in w so that n w is bounded in w for n 3 if n w is bounded for n 3 subject to the conditions on n 1 and convolution estimates and the gross pitaevskii hierarchy 9 implicit in the formulation of the problems treated here is the continuing development of new forms that characterize control by smoothness for size as an example and a consequence of the principal estimate obtained here bounds for new stein weiss integrals with a kernel determined by restriction to a smooth submanifold can be shown

proof apply pitt s inequality and the uniform bounds obtained above for n n n and n here c is a generic constant practical application for such convolution type estimates has proved to be efficient by re placing the riesz potentials with the fourier transform of bessel potentials 2 3 advantage is achieved by removing local singularities while gaining integrability on the potential side and improving the range of application as smoothing operators still the lack of homogeneity lim its determination of precise dependence on parameters in computing best size estimates but as with exact model calculations the role of riesz potentials can result in very elegant and useful formulae that underline intrinsic geometric structure capture essential features of symmetry and uncertainty and
