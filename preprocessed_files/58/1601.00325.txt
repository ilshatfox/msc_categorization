gradient ricci solitons with positive curvature operator and quadratic curvature decay at infinity 1 introduction we investigate the stability of expanding gradient ricci solitons with positive curvature operator along the ricci flow in the spirit of koch and lamm kl 12 the main aim of this approach is twofold on one hand it allows to start the ricci flow from singular initial metrics that are close to a self similar solution of the ricci flow in the l sense on the other hand it proves the existence of global solutions of the ricci flow i e solutions that are defined for all positive time we recall that an expanding gradient ricci soliton is a self similar solution of the ricci flow i e it evolves by dilating homotheties and diffeomorphisms generated by the gradient of a smooth function formally speaking it consists of a triplet mn g gf where mn g is a complete riemannian manifold endowed with a smooth function f mn r called the potential function such that the associated bakry e mery tensor is constantly negative as follows ric g g 2 f g 2 alternatively the corresponding ricci flow is given at least formally by g 1 g for 1 where 1 is a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms generated by the vector field gf 1 expanding gradient ricci solitons with non negative curvature operator are non collapsed that is the volume of geodesic balls is euclidean for any scale and are diffeomorphic to the euclidean space rn where n is the dimension of the underlying manifold thanks to the work of schulze and simon ss 13 they appear as natural blow down of ricci flows starting from riemannian manifolds with bounded non negative curvature operator and positive asymptotic volume ratio here are some examples of such geometric structures with non negative curvature

author proved the existence and uniqueness of defor mations of gradient expanders with positive curvature operator smoothly coming out of a metric cone over a smooth riemannian sphere x gx satisfying rm gx 1 finally we mention that there is a one to one correspondence between the following geo metric notions for such expanders the asymptotic cone in the gromov hausdorff sense is the singular initial condition of the corresponding ricci flow see the introduction of der 15 for an explanation now the ricci flow is well known to be a degenerate quasilinear parabolic equation this comes from its invariance under the whole diffeomorphism group of the underlying manifold that is why it is more convenient to study the so called time dependent deturck ricci flow let mn g 0 t t 0 be an expanding gradient ricci soliton we consider the following system tg 2 ric g t lv g t g 0 t g t on mn 0 g 0 g 0 0 h h l mn g 0 small where v g t g 0 t is a vector field defined by v g t g 0 t divg 0 t g t g 0 t 1 2 g 0 t trg 0 t g t g 0 t see section 2 for the equivalence with other flows that appear naturally in this setting we are now in a position to state the main result of this paper theorem 1 1 let mn g 0 t t 0 be an expanding gradient ricci soliton with positive cur vature operator and quadratic curvature decay at infinity i e rm g 0 0 rm g 0 g 0 x c 1 d 2 g 0 p x x m for some point p m and some positive constant c depending on p then there exists a positive such that for any metric g l m g 0 satisfying g g 0 l m g 0 there exists a global solution mn g t t 0 to the deturck ricci flow with initial condition g moreover 1 the solution is analytic in space and time and the following holds for any nonnegative indices sup x m t 0 t 1 2 g 0 t t t g t g 0 t g 0 t c g 0 g 0 l m g 0 2 this solution is unique in bx g 0 where x is a banach space defined in section 3 let us comment the assumptions and the proof of theorem 1 1 the condition on the sign of the curvature operator is global whereas the one on the decay of the curvature is asymptotic or local at infinity it ensures in particular that the asymptotic cone is c 1 for any 0 1 as shown in cd both assumptions are crucial to estimate the homogeneous equation associated to the deturck ricci flow section 4 th lth on m n 0 h 0 s 2 t m h 0 l mn g 0 weak stability of ricci expanders with positive curvature operator 3 where lt

g 0 t h ric g 0 t h h ric g 0 t rm g 0 t h ij rm g 0 t ikljhkl h s 2 t m the main strategy to prove theorem 1 1 is due to koch and lamm kl 12 inspired by a previous work on the navier stokes equation by koch and tataru kt 01 it is based on gaussian bounds for large time of the heat kernel associated to the linearized operator of course such bounds are given for free in the euclidean case reinterpreted here as the gaussian expanding soliton therefore the main challenge of this paper is to get uniform in time gaussian bounds for the heat kernel associated to the time dependent lichnerowicz operator we describe succinctly the main estimates we need to reach such goal 1 we establish a l l bound together with an l 1 l 1 bound for this heat oper ator only the positivity of the curvature operator is used see section 5 this gives more or less an on diagonal bound for the heat kernel modulo a nash moser iteration 2 this implies that the heat operator is bounded on lp for any p 1 but it does not imply that it is contractive unless the expander is flat in particular the l 2 norm of the solution to the homogeneous equation is not decreasing despite this lack of monotonicity we are able to adapt the ideas of grigor yan gri 97 to get an off diagonal bound we mention that the literature on heat kernel bounds in various geometric settings is immense see the book gri 09 and the references therein in the case of static metrics on the other hand more and more refined gaussian estimates for the heat kernel along the ricci flow for short time are being investigated intensively under weaker and weaker curvature bounds see the recent work by bamler and zhang bam 15 and the references therein in the presence of a uniform bound on the scalar curvature only let us describe now briefly where our main theorem 1 1 is placed in the panorama of sta bility results along the ricci flow the methods are very different whether the manifold is compact without boundary or not indeed the l 2 spectrum of the lichnerowicz operator is not discrete anymore in the non compact case concerning the compact case see hm 13 in the ricci flat case then kro 14 for ricci soli tons their work consists in establishing an adequate lojasiewicz inequality for the relevant entropies introduced by perelman this approach goes back to the work of leon simon it has been used recently by colding minicozzi for ricci flat non collapsed non compact riem manian manifolds cm 14 see also the work of sesum ses 06 under integrability assumptions of the moduli space in the non compact case the hyperbolic and euclidean case have first been considered by schnu rer schulze simon sss 11 their method is based on an exhaustion procedure solving corresponding dirichlet deturck ricci flows the inconvenient of this approach although being very geometric is that it does not provide local uniqueness of the solutions in some functional space bamler bam 10 proved among other things stability in the l sense for non compact symmetric spaces of rank larger than 1 the analysis is based on kl 12 the 4 alix deruelle and tobias lamm first author considered the expanding case in the l l 2 efd g sense for metrics with non negative curvature operator in the spirit of sss 11 der 14 b again as the solution is not built by a fixed point argument we did not know if this solution was unique by relaxing the assumptions on the initial condition theorem 1 1 ensures the well posedness of the ricci flow with small initial condition in the l sense for such expanders we end this introduction by explaining the reasons that led us to consider the time dependent deturck ricci flow in der 14 b we investigated the asymptotic stability of ex panding gradient ricci solitons with initial condition belonging to a weighted space l 2 efd g by studying the bottom of the spectrum of the weighted laplacian f it is then legitimate to ask only for stability in the l sense the quasi linear evolution equation to consider is tg 2 ricg g l g 0 f 0 g lv g g 0 g 1 where mn g 0 g 0 f 0 is a fixed background expanding gradient ricci soliton and lv g g 0 g is the deturck s term described previously the linearized operator of 1 is the weighted static lichnerowicz operator l f 2 rm g in the euclidean case the heat kernel associated to l f is the mehler kernel given by kt x y 1 8 sinh t 2 n 2 exp x y 2 4 1 e t 1 e t 2 1 e t x y 2 nt 4 the first difficulty lies in estimating the derivatives in time and space of the mehler kernel associated to a non necessarily euclidean metric indeed the semigroup associated is not strongly continuous nor analytic in l as daprato and lunardi showed dpl 95 secondly the choice of norms is crucial koch and lamm use scale invariants norms together with the implicit fact that the measure is doubling in this case this is not true anymore i e volf b x 2 r b x 2 r efd g is not uniformly comparable to volf b x r which would make the analysis harder that is why the main advantage of the time dependent deturck ricci flow on 1 is that the time dependent linearized operator is the unweighted classical lichnerowicz operator lt therefore even if the coefficients are time dependent the volume measure is now doubling and it is controlled by the time independent asymptotic volume ratio of the expander see appendix a as a consequence we get a uniform in time mehler bound for the static weighted lichnerowicz operator l 5 4 1 the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 discusses the equivalence of various ricci flows that are pertinent in this context and describes more precisely each non linear term that appears in the time dependent deturck ricci flow section 3 defines the relevant banach spaces section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the homogeneous equation associated to the time dependent deturck ricci flow section 5 proves gaussian bounds for the heat kernel associated to the time dependent lichnerowicz operator finally section 6 proves theorem 1 1 by a careful study of the inhomogeneous equation associated to this ricci flow the research leading to the results contained in this paper has received funding from the european research council e r c under european union s seventh framework program fp 7 2007 2013 erc grant agreement no 291060 weak stability of ricci expanders with positive curvature operator 5 2 equivalence of ricci flows an expanding gradient ricci soliton is a triplet mn g 0 g 0 f 0 where mn g 0 is a rie mannian manifold and f 0 m r is a smooth function called the potential function satisfying 1 2 l g 0 f 0 g 0 ric g 0 g 0 2 we assume that mn g 0 is complete this suffices to ensure the completeness of the vector field g 0 f 0 zha 08 let us fix an expanding gradient ricci soliton mn g 0 g 0 f 0 in this paper we study the stability of such gradient ricci soliton under the ricci flow i e tg 2 ric g t on m 0 g 0 g 0 h where h is a symmetric 2 tensor on m denoted by h s 2 t m such that g 0 is a metric in this setting a more relevant flow called the modified ricci flow has been introduced in der 14 b tg 2 ric g t g t l g 0 f 0 g t on m 0 g 0 g 0 h it turns out that these two flows are equivalent as shown in der 14 b here we decide to fix the vector field g 0 f 0 we could allow the metric to vary by choosing instead g t f 0 this would not affect the analysis choosing an implicit function f t for any positive time should be done by a minimizing procedure involving a relevant entropy in the spirit of perelman as it is done in hm 13 in the spirit of the so called deturck s trick as the modified ricci flow is a degenerate parabolic equation we first need to consider the following modified ricci harmonic map heat flow mrhf tg 2 ric g t g t l g 0 f 0 g t lv g t g 0 g t on m 0 g

that the ricci curvature ric g 0 t satisfies tric g 0 t ltric g 0 t along a ricci flow g 0 t t 0 on the other hand there is some constant c such that h 0 c h 0 l m g 0 h 0 h 0 c h 0 l m g 0 g 0 2 ric

infm 0 t is positive one can choose c big enough so that th lth on m 0 t now if infm 0 t h 0 there must be a first space time point x 0 t 0 m 0 t and some unitary vector u txm such that h x 0 t 0 u 0 since is an exhaustion function appendix a in particular h t 0 for t t 0 extend u in a neighborhood of x 0 by parallel transport with respect to g 0 t 0 independently of time as done in theorem 3 3

18 proof as in gri 97 the proof consists in three steps 1 we first estimate the evolution of i 0 t as follows lemma 5 11 the function t 0 1 t c r 0 i 0 t is non increasing where r 0 sup m 0 1 t rm g 0 t g 0 t proof of lemma 5 11 we temporally simplify the notations by suppressing the depen dence on the base point x 0 by using the properties of h t hx 0 t t 0 given by 19 ti 0 t 2 th h ric g 0 t ric

following differential inequality t ed t c r 0 1 t ed t t 0 t we proceed exactly as in gri 97 by estimating ir t from above by ir for any radius 0 r r and time 0 t by invoking lemma 5 12 we get 1 1 t

1 1 c e 2 d r r 2 t bg 0 t x 0 r h 2 g 0 d g 0 1 1 c bg 0 t x 0 r h 2 g 0 d g 0 now by assumption on i 0 t one has bg 0 t x 0 r h 2 g 0 d g 0 i 0 c n 2 and by lemma a 3 bg 0 t x 0 r bg 0 x 0 r therefore by letting t go to t one gets 1 1 t c ir t 1 1 c ir 1 1 c e 2 d r r 2 t 21 consider now the following decreasing sequences of positive radii rk k 0 and times tk k 0 defined by rk 1 2 1 k 2 r tk t k k 0 1 remark that irk tk goes to zero as k goes to since by assumption h x t 0 for any time t and any x 6 x 0 and rk tends to the positive constant r 2 therefore by iterating inequality 21 one has 1 1 t c ir t k 0 c t n 2 k 1 1 tk 1 c e 2 d rk rk 1 2 tk tk 1 now a rather straightforward estimate as done in gri 97 leads to the following ex pected estimate ir t c 1 tn 2 e c 2 2 d r 2 t where c 1 and c 2 are two positive constants depending on c 0 and n but independent of r and t weak stability of ricci expanders with positive curvature operator 23 2 the second step is almost word for word

constant such that the previous step holds now choose r such that r 2 dt ln 2 this particular value is arbitrary to get ed t c 3 tn 2 t 0 for any d large enough and where c 3 is a positive constant independent of t 3 the third step consists in proving the expected estimate for ed t for any d 4 it suffices to prove the estimate for d d 1 where d 1 is a sufficiently large constant such that the previous step holds adapting the proof of lemma 5 12 to the weight function x t d 2 g 0 t x 0 x 4 t t t 0 leads to the following inequality 1 1 t c h 2 g 0 t e 2 t d g 0 t 1 1 c h 2 g 0 e 2 d g 0 for any positive 0 t now we force the appearance of ed t respectively of ed 1 on the left hand side respectively on the right hand side of the previous inequality this amounts to solve the following

theorem 5 8 use in a very essential way the fact that the curvature rm g 0 t decays like c 1 t the uniform boundedness of the curvature for all time alone would not have been sufficient we are now in a position to prove gaussian bounds on the lichnerowicz heat kernel kl acting on symmetric 2 tensors theorem 5 14 gaussian estimate let mn g 0 t t 0 be an expanding gradient ricci soliton with

by der 14 b m f d f g m gf 2 d f g c 0 m gf rg n 2 therefore if h is a symmetric 2 tensor with compact support we get by the kato inequality m f 2 rm g h h d f g m rg 2 rm g h h d f g n 2 m h 2 gd f g 26 alix deruelle and tobias lamm hence the result if we prove the pointwise inequality rg h 2 2 rm g h h 0 for any symmetric 2 tensors indeed let h s 2 t m and x m let ei 1 i n be an orthonormal base

by the one parameter family of diffeomorphisms t t 1 generated by gf 1 t as suggested in the introduction the kernelkl f is the mehler kernel in the case m n g gf is flat therefore theorem 5 14 enables to prove mehler bounds instead of gaussian for the heat kernel kl f in case the expander has positive curvature operator 5 4 2 hardy inequalities on ricci expanders regarding remark 5 7 one

m r g 0 t x kl x t y s 1 s t r 0 y s d g 0 s ds in order to apply the riesz convexity theorem we show first that tkl is of type 1 p and of type p where p is the conjugate exponent of p as soon as p 1 n 2 n 1 tkl is of type p indeed by ho lder s inequality one has tkl r 0 x t g 0 t x kl x t lp m 0 t r 0 lp q 0 for x t m r now by the gaussian estimates established in theorem 5 14 together with

based on singular integrals defined on homogeneous spaces as in kl 12 indeed by theorem 2 4 and section 3 2 of koc 08 the result follows if the following parabolic riesz operator satisfies suitable estimates that are recalled below consider m m r endowed with the parabolic distance d x t y s max dg 0 s x y t s x y m 0 s t this turns m d into a homogeneous space i e a complete metric space with a doubling measure consider the operator tkl r 1 g 0 kl g 0 r 1 for r 1 with compact support in q 0 as defined above this operator is an integral operator whose kernel kl is given by the second covariant derivatives of kl by theorem 5 14 together with proposition 5 19 kl satisfies on m kl x t y s g cd x t y s n 2 min d x t y s n 2 d x t y s n 2 kl x t y s kl x t y s g c d x t x t d y s y s d x t y s d x t y s for any x t y s x t and y s in m 34 alix deruelle and tobias lamm moreover by an integration by part on m one can check that tkl is continuous operator on l 2 q 0 i e tkl r 1 l 2 q 0 c r 1 l 2 q 0 where c is a positive constant independent of q 0 and r 1 therefore by invoking theorem 2 4 of koc 08 tkl is a continuous operator on l n 4 q 0 which corresponds to the expected estimate after rescaling appropriately by a power of t 0 to prove theorem 1 1 it is now sufficient to invoke lemma 3 1 together with theorem 6 to show that the map h bx 0 x r 7 kl h 0 kl r h bx 0 x r is well defined and is a contraction mapping for r 1 sufficiently small therefore by the contraction mapping theorem one gets a locally unique solution to the deturck ricci flow with initial condition g 0 g 0
