15 on some conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations for n 3 consider u n 2 2 u n 2 n 2 on rn 1 the celebrated liouville type theorem of caffarelli gidas and spruck 3 asserts that positive c 2 solutions of 1 are of the form u x 2 n n 2 4 a 1 a 2 x x 2 n 2 2 where a 0 and x rn under an additional decay hypothesis u x o x 2 n the result was proved by obata 20 and gidas ni and nirenberg 8 let

on rn if for any mo bius transformation and any positive function u c 2 rn h u u 2 u h u u 2 u 2 we showed in 15 that h x u u 2 u is conformally invariant if and only if h x u u 2 u f au where au 2 n

operators of elliptic type theorem 1 15 for n 3 let u and f be as above and let u c 2 rn be a positive solution of f au 1 on rn assume that u is regular at infinity i e x 2 nu x x 2 can be extended to a pos itive c 2 function near the origin then for some x rn and for some positive constants a and b u x a 1 b 2 x x 2 n 2 2 x rn remark 1 in fact as established in 15 the conclusion of the above theorem still holds when replacing the assumption u c 2 rn by a weaker assumption that u c 2 rn 0 u can be extended to a positive continuous function near the origin and limx 0 x u x 0 theorem 1 indicates that behavior of solutions to conformally invariant equa tions is very rigid thus we expect some good theories for conformally invariant uniformly elliptic fully nonlinear equations let f be c functions defined on n n on some conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations 179 real symmetric matrices and let f be invariant under orthogonal conjugations we assume that for some constants 0 i fij m i for all n n real symmetric matrices we raise the following question 1 let f be as above and let b 1 be a unit ball in r n and a 0 be some constant are there some positive constants and c depending only on f a and n such that for any positive c solution u of f au 0 in b 1 satisfying min b 1 u a u c 2 b 1 1 a we have u c 2 b 1 2 c other interesting questions include to understand behavior near an isolated singularities of a solution in a punctured disc of this subclass of uniformly elliptic equations and to establish some removable singularity results let m g be an n dimensional smooth riemannian manifold without bound ary consider the schouten tensor ag 1 n 2 ricg rg 2 n 1 g where ricg and rg denote respectively the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature associated with g for 1 k n let k 1 i 1 ik n i 1 ik 1 n r n denote the k th symmetric function and let k denote the connected component of rn k 0 containing the positive cone r n 1 n 0 it is known see e g 2 that k is a convex cone with its vertex at the origin n 2 1 k i 0 in k 1 i n and 1 k k is concave in k 180 yanyan li fully nonlinear elliptic equations involving k d 2 u have been investigated in the classical and pioneering paper of caffarelli gidas and nirenberg 2 for extensive studies and outstanding results on such equations see e g guan and spruck 10 trudinger 25 trudinger and wang 26 and the references therein on riemannian manifolds of nonnegative curvature li studied in 17 equations 1 k k 2 gu g x u 4 where 2 gu g denotes eigenvalues of 2 gu g with respect to g on general riemannian manifolds viaclovsky introduced and systematically studied in 28 and 27 equations 1 k k ag x u 5 where ag denotes the eigenvalues of ag with respect to g on 4 dimensional general riemannian manifolds remarkable results on 5 for k 2 were obtained by chang gursky and yang in 4 and 5 which include liouville type theorems existence and compactness of solutions as well as applications to topology on the other hand works on the yamabe equation by caffarelli gidas and spruck 3 schoen 22 and 23 li and zhu 19 and li and zhang 18 have played an important role in our approach to the study of 5 as developed in 15 consider k ag 1 6 together with ag k 7 let g 1 u 4 n 2 g 0 be a conformal change of metrics then see e g 28 ag 1 2 n 2 u 1 2 g 0 u 2 n n 2 2 u 2 g 0 u g 0 u 2 n 2 2 u 2 g 0 u 2 g 0 g 0 ag 0 let g u 4 n 2 gflat where gflat denotes the euclidean metric on r n then by the above transformation formula ag u 4 n 2 auijdx idxj where au is given by 3 equations 6 and 7 take the form k a u 1 on rn 8 and au k on r n 9 our next result extends the liouville type theorem of caffarelli gidas and spruck to all k 1 k n for k 1 equation 8 is 1 on some conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations 181 theorem 2 15 for n 3 and 1 k n let u c 2 rn be a positive solution of 8 satisfying 9 then for some a 0 and x rn u x c n k a 1 a 2 x x 2 n 2 2 x rn 10 where c n k 2 n 2 4 n k n 2 4 k the case k 2 and n 4 was obtained by chang gursky and yang 5 more recently they 6 have independently established the result for k 2 and n 5 and they also established the result for k 2 and n 6 under an additional hypothesis rn u 2 n n 2 under an additional hypothesis that 1 x n 2 u x x 2 can be extended to a c 2 positive function near x 0 the case 2 k n was obtained by viaclovsky 28 29 as mentioned above the case k 1 was obtained by caffarelli gidas and spruck while under an additional hypothesis that 1 x n 2 u x x 2 is bounded near x 0 the case k 1 was obtained by obata and by gidas ni and nirenberg the methods of chang gursky and yang in 5 and 6 include an ingenious way of using the obata technique which as they pointed out allows the possibility to be generalized to establish the uniqueness of solutions on general einstein man ifolds our proof of theorem 2 is very different from that of 5 and 6 a crucial ingredient in our proof is the following harnack type inequality theorem 3 15 for n 3 1 k n and r 0 let b 3 r r n be a ball of radius 3 r and let u c 2 b 3 r be a positive solution of k a u 1 in b 3 r 11 satisfying au k in b 3 r 12 then max br u min b 2 r u c n r 2 n 13 the above harnack type inequality for k 1 was obtained by schoen 23 based on the liouville type theorem of caffarelli gidas and spruck an important step toward our proof of theorem 3 was taken in an earlier work of li and zhang 18 where they gave a different proof of schoen s harnack type inequality without using the liouville type theorem our next result concerns existence and compactness of solutions theorem 4 15 for n 3 and 1 k n let m g be an n dimensional smooth compact locally conformally flat riemannian manifold without boundary sat isfying ag k on m 182 yanyan li then there exists some smooth positive function u on m such that g u 4 n 2 g satisfies ag k k ag 1 on m 14 moreover if m g is not conformally diffeomorphic to the standard n sphere all solutions of the above satisfy for all m 0 that u cm m g u 1 cm m g c where c depends only on m g and m for k 1 it is the yamabe problem for locally conformally flat manifolds with positive yamabe invariants and the result is due to schoen 21 22 the yamabe problem was solved through the work of yamabe 30 trudinger 24 aubin 1 and schoen 21 for k 2 and n 4 the result was proved without the locally conformally flatness hypothesis by chang gursky and yang 5 for k n the existence result was established by viaclovsky 27 for a class of manifolds which are not necessarily locally conformally flat for k 6 n 2 the result is independently obtained by guan and wang in 12 using a heat flow method more recently guan viaclovsky and wang 9 have proved that ag k for k n 2 implies the posi tivity of the ricci tensor and therefore by classical results m g is conformally covered by sn and the existence and compactness results in this case follow easily our proof of theorem 1 different from the ones in 20 8 3 28 and 29 is in the spirit of the new proof of the liouville type theorem of caffarelli gidas and spruck given by li and zhu in 19 we also make use of the substantial simplifications of li and zhang in 18 to the proof in 19 the proof is along the line of the pioneering work of gidas ni and nirenberg 8 which in particular does not need the kind of divergence structure needed for the method of obata 20 and therefore can be applied in much more generality in our proofs blow up arguments are used which require local derivative es timates of solutions for 1 the yamabe equation such estimates follow from standard elliptic theories guan and wang 11 established local gradient and sec ond derivative estimates for k k 2 global gradient and second derivative estimates for k were obtained by viaclovsky 27 for the related equation 4 on manifolds of nonnegative curvature global gradient and second derivative esti mates were obtained by li in 17 by the concavity of 1 k k c 2 estimates hold due to the classical work of evans 7 and krylov 14 for the proof of the exis tence part of theorem 4 we introduce a homotopy k t 1 t 1 defined on k t r n t 1 t 1 k which establishes a natural link between 14 and the yamabe problem we extend the local estimates in 11 for k to k t 1 t 1 with estimates uniform in 0 t 1 the compactness results as stated in theorem 4 were established in 15 along the homotopy the compactness results for the yamabe problem was established by schoen 22 we gave a different proof which does not rely on the liouville type theorem which al lows us to establish existence results for more general f than k for which liouville type theorems are not available the existence results follow from the compactness results with the help of the degree theory for second order fully nonlinear elliptic on some conformally invariant fully nonlinear equations 183 operators 16 as well as the degree counting formula for the yamabe problem 22 the first step in our proof of the liouville type theorem 2 is to establish the harnack type inequality theorem 3 from which we obtain sharp asymptotic behavior at infinity of an entire solution then we establish theorem 2 by distin guishing into two cases in the case k n 2 theorem 2 is proved by using the sharp asymptotic behavior of an entire solution and theorem 1 remark 1 together with a result of trudinger and wang 26 in the case 1 k n 2 theorem 2 is proved by the sharp asymptotic behavior of an entire solution together with the obata type integral formula of viaclovsky 28 for the second case divergence structure of the equation is used theorem 2 theorem 3 and theorem 4 are established for more general nonlin ear f than k in 15 including those for which no divergence structure is available references 1 t aubin e quations diffe
