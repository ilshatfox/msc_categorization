ar x iv 1 10 7 34 40 v 3 m at h a p 2 4 o ct 2 01 1 a natural lower bound for the size of nodal sets hamid hezari and christopher d sogge the purpose of this brief note is to prove a natural lower bound for the n 1 dimensional hausdorff measure of nodal sets of eigenfunctions to wit theorem 1 let m g be a compact manifold of dimension n and e an eigenfunction satisfying ge e and m e 2 dvg 1 then if z x m e x 0 is the nodal set and z its n 1 dimensional hausdorff measure we have 1 1 2 m e dvg 2 c z 1 for some uniform constant c consequently 2 3 n 4 z 1 inequality 2 follows from 1 and the lower bounds in 14 3 1 n 8 m e dvg the lower bound 2 is due to colding and minicozzi 3 yau 17 conjectured that 1 2 z this lower bound 1 2 z was verified in the 2 dimensional case by bru ning 2 and independently by yau unpublished the bounds in 2 seem to be the best known ones for higher dimensions although donnelly and fefferman 5 6 showed that as conjectured z 1 2 if m g is assumed to be real analytic the first polynomial type lower bounds appear to be due to to colding and mini cozzi 3 and zelditch and the second author 14 see also 9 as we shall point out inequality 1 cannot be improved and it to some extent unifies the approaches in 3 and 14 as was shown in 14 the l 1 lower bounds in 3 follow from ho lder s inequal ity and the lp eigenfunction estimates of the second author 11 for the range where 2 p 2 n 1 n 1 these too cannot be improved but it is thought better lp bounds hold for a typical eigenfunction or if one makes geometric assumptions such as negative curvature cf 15 16 thus it is natural to expect to be able to improve 3 and hence the lower bounds 2 for all eigenfunctions on manifolds with negative curvature or for typical eigenfunctions on any manifold of course yau s conjecture that z 1 2 would be the ultimate goal but understanding when 3 can be improved is a related problem of independent interest the authors were supported in part by nsf grants dms

author and zelditch 14 4 m e g f dvg 2 z ge f dsg here dsg is the riemannian surface measure on z and g is the gradient coming from the metric and gu is the norm coming from the metric meaning that in local coordinates 5 gu 2 g n jk 1 gjk x ju ku identity 4 follows from the gauss green formula and a related earlier identity was proved by dong 4 as in 8 if we take f 1 and apply schwarz s inequality we get 6 m e dvg 2 z 1 2 z ge 2 dsg 1 2 thus we would have 1 if we could prove that the energy of e on its nodal set satisfies the natural bounds 7 z ge 2 dsg 3 2 we shall do this by choosing a different auxiliary function f this time we want to use 8 f 1 e 2 ge 2 g 1 2 if we plug this into 4 we get that 2 z ge 2 gdsg m e g 1 e 2 ge 2 1 2 dvg since we have the l 2 sobolev bounds 9 e hs m o s 2 it is clear that m e 1 e 2 ge 2 g 1 2 dvg o 3 2 and thus to prove 7 it suffices to show that 10 m e g 1 e 2 ge 2 g 1 2 dvg o 3 2 to prove this we first note that k 1 e 2 ge 2 g 1 2 e ke 1 2 k ge 2 g 1 e 2 ge 2 1 2 from this and 9 we deduce that m e g 1 e 2 ge 2 1 2 dvg o a natural lower bound for the size of nodal sets 3 this means that the contribution of the first order terms of the laplace beltrami operator written in local coordinates to 10 are better than required and so it suffices to show that in a compact subset k of a local coordinate patch we have 11 k e j k 1 e 2 ge 2 1 2 dvg o 3 2 a calculation shows that j k e 2 ge 2 1 2 equals e je 1 2 j ge 2 g e ke 1 2 k ge 2 g 1 e 2 ge 2 3 2 je ke e j ke 1 2 j k ge 2 g 1 e 2 ge 2 1 2 if dmf m f then by 5 k ge 2 o d 2 e de de 2 and j k ge 2 g o d 3 e de d 2 e 2 d 2 e de de 2 therefore j k e 2 ge 2 1 2 o 2 e 2 de 2 d 2 e 2 de 2 de 4 1 e 2 ge 2 3 2 o de 2 e d 2 e d 3 e de d 2 e 2 d 2 e de de 2 1 e 2 ge 2 1 2 this implies that the integrand in the left side of 11 is dominated by 1 2 de 2 1 2 d 2 e 2 de 2 1 2 de 2 1 2 e d 2 e e d 3 e 1 2 d 2 e 2 d 2 e e de e leading to 11 after applying 9 remarks we could also have taken f to be e 2 ge 2 1 2 and obtained the same upper bounds but there does not seem to be any advantage to doing this inequality 1 cannot be improved there are many cases when the l 1 and l 2 norms of eigenfunctions are comparable for instance for the sphere the zonal functions have this property and it is easy to check that their nodal sets satisfy z 1 2 which means that for zonal functions 1 cannot be improved there are many cases where inequality 1 can be improved for instance the l 2 normalized highest weight spherical harmonics qk have eigenvalues k k 2 and l 1 norms k n 1 4 see e g 10 this means that for the highest weight spherical harmonics the left side is proportional to 3 n 4 even though here too z 1 2 similarly the highest weight spherical harmonics saturate 7 it is 4 hamid hezari and christopher d sogge because of functions like the highest weight spherical harmonics that the current techniques only seem to yield 2 note that inequality 2 gives the correct lower bound in the trivial case where the dimension n is one as the dimension increases the bound gets worse and worse due to the fact that 3 is saturated by functions like the highest weight spherical harmonics gaussian beams whose mass is supported on a 1 4 neighborhood of a geodesic and the volume of such a tube decreases geometrically as n increases see 1 and 13 for related work on this phenomena
