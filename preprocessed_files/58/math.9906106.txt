graded c algebra we characterize kasparov s k theory group k 0 a in terms of graded homomorphisms by proving a general converse to the functional calculus theorem for self adjoint regular operators on graded hilbert modules an application to the index theory of elliptic differential operators on smooth closed manifolds and asymptotic morphisms is discussed 1 introduction let a be a graded unital c algebra with grading automorphism we characterize kasparov s k group in the category of graded c algebras k 0 a kk c a as the group of graded homotopy classes of graded homomorphisms from c 0 r the c algebra of continuous functions on the real line with the even odd function grading to the graded tensor product a k where k m 2 k is the c algebra of compact operators graded into diagonal and off diagonal matrices addition is given by direct sum the isomorphism is established in section 3 by proving a general converse to the functional calculus theorem 11 for self adjoint regular operators on graded hilbert modules in section 2 we will indicate in section 4 how this characterization is useful in simplifying calculations with asymptotic morphisms of c algebras and elliptic differential operators d with coefficients in a trivially graded c algebra a over a smooth closed manifold m the functional calculus will give an explicit formulation as nontrivial compatible graded homomorphisms of the generalized fredholm index indexa d k 0 a and the symbol class d k 0 a t m the topological k theory of vector a bundles of the cotangent bundle t m in a form which is suitable for composing directly with asymptotic morphisms with no rescaling or suspensions as in the general theory since the product in e theory is given by composition this approach to index theory is simpler than using the kasparov product in kk theory 10 which can be very technical we should note that kasparov s graded k theory is unrelated to van daele s version except when a is trivially graded 19 this paper

jody trout 2 graded c algebras and hilbert modules in this section we collect some definitions and results on graded c algebras and hilbert modules and fix notation for a complete discussion see the books 3 9 let a be a c algebra recall that a is graded if there is a automorphism a a such that 2 ida equivalently there is a decomposition of a as a direct sum a a 0 a 1 where a 0 and a 1 are self adjoint closed linear subspaces with the property that if x am and y an then xy am n mod 2 in fact an x a x 1 nx we write x n if x an if there is a self adjoint unitary called the grading operator in the multiplier algebra m a such that x x then a is said to be evenly graded a homomorphism a b of graded c algebras is graded if an bn for n 0 1 example 2 1 the following are the main examples we will be concerned with a every c algebra a can be trivially graded by setting a 0 a and a 1 0 this is an even grading with grading operator 1 the complex numbers c are always assumed to be trivially graded b the c algebra c 0 r of continuous complex valued functions on r van ishing at infinity is graded into the even and odd functions by defining f t f t for all functions f c 0 r and t r c let h be an infinite dimensional separable hilbert space by choosing an isomorphism h h h we obtain the standard even grading on the c algebra of compact operators k k h m 2 k with grading operator 1 0 0 1 which is determined uniquely up to conjugation by a unitary homotopic to the identity let a and b be graded c algebras define a graded product and graded invo lution on the vector space tensor product a b by the formulas a b a b 1 b a aa bb a b 1 a b a b the resulting algebra is denoted a b a grading on a b is defined by setting a b a b mod 2 now faithfully represent a and b by 1 and 2 on graded hilbert spaces h 1 and h 2 with grading operators 1 and 2 respectively then a b is faithfully represented on h 1 h 2 graded by 1 2 via the formula a b 1 a a 1 2 b the c algebra completion is denoted a b and is called the minimal graded tensor product it does not depend on the choice of representations there is also a maximal graded tensor product 3 but it will not be needed for our purposes since one of the factors will always be nuclear graded k theory functional calculus and elliptic operators 3 lemma 2 2 proposition 15 5 1 3 if b is evenly graded then a b a b if a is also evenly graded then under this isomorphism a b is also evenly graded corollary 2 3 let k have the standard even grading then a k m 2 a k if a is evenly graded by a k m 2 a k with standard even grading given by diag 1 1 let b be another graded c algebra with grading then b 0 1 c 0 1 b canonically inherits a grading by the formula f t f t two graded homomorphisms 0 1 a b are graded homotopic if there is a graded homomorphism a b 0 1 such that composition with the evaluation maps evt b 0 1 b for t 0 1 are equal to 0 and 1 respectively we shall denote by a b the set of graded homotopy classes of graded homomorphisms from a to b if a b is a graded homomorphism then we denote by its equivalence class in a b a hilbert a module h is graded if there is a banach space decomposition h h 0 h 1 such that hn am hn m and hn hm an m mod 2 we let l h denote the c algebra of all bounded a linear maps t h h with an adjoint t and let k h denote the closed two sided ideal of compact operators the grading on h induces gradings on l h and k h via the identities t m if t hn hn m we let h op denote h with the opposite grading hopn h 1 n note that if a is trivially graded h is the direct sum of two orthogonal a modules if b l h is a homomorphism a closed submodule e of h is invariant if b e e for all b b 3 the converse functional calculus let h be a graded hilbert a module a regular operator on h is a densely defined closed a linear map d domain d h such that the adjoint d is densely defined and 1 d d has dense range 1 d has degree one if dx x 1 for all x domain d proposition 3 1 for any graded homomorphism c 0 r a there is a maximal invariant closed graded hilbert a submodule a of a and a self adjoint regular operator d on a of degree one such that for all f c 0 r we have f a f d proof given a graded homomorphism c 0 r a define a c 0 r a c 0 r a to be the closed right ideal generated by the image of this is a closed graded hilbert submodule of a see blackadar 3 let cc r denote the dense graded ideal of continuous functions on r with compact support define domain d cc r a which is a dense graded submodule of a let d denote the function d t t on r define d domain d a by the formula d f x df x where f cc r so df cc r and extend linearly suppose that f x g y for some other 1 if h a then d is sometimes called an unbounded multiplier 4 8 11 4 jody trout g cc r choose a function d cc r such that d d on the compact set supp f supp g then we have d f x d f x d f x d g y d g y d g y it follows that d is well defined and is clearly a linear also d is degree one since d is an odd function on r the computation d f x g y x df g y x df g x f dg y f x d g y shows that d is symmetric on domain d this implies that d is closeable so we replace d by its closure d consequently d i are injective and have closed range by lemma 9 7 11 let f cc r for any x a we have 1 d 2 1 d 2 1 f x 1 d 2 1 d 2 1 f x f x it follows that range 1 d 2 domain d is dense and so d is regular we will show d is self adjoint by using a cayley transform argument extend to c 0 r a by adjoining a unit let z c 0 r denote the unitary z t t i t i 1 2 ir t for t r where r t t i 1 denotes the resolvent let ud z 1 2 i r a it is easy to check that for all x domain d we have that the unitary ud satisfies ud d i x d i udx d i x by lemma 9 8 and the discussion following proposition 10 6 in lance 11 the closed symmetric regular operator d is self adjoint and ud d i 1 d i to show f a f d it suffices to show this for the resolvents r t d i 1 t let fn n 1 be an approximate unit for c 0 r consisting of compactly supported functions let x a be given then fn x domain d for all n and fn x x as n we have that as n d i d i 1 fn x d i d i 1 fn x fn x x now since d i 1 fn x d i 1 fn x d i 1 x as n and d i is closed we conclude that d i 1 x d i 1 x since x a was arbitrary we are done let b be a c algebra if h is a hilbert b module a homomorphism a l h is called nondegenerate if a h is dense in h it is called strict if un is cauchy in the strict topology of l h for some approximate unit un in a nondegeneracy implies strictness 11 the following result may be considered the converse to the functional calculus for self adjoint regular operators 2 4 11 theorem 3 2 converse functional calculus let c 0 r l h be graded there is a closed graded invariant hilbert submodule h of h and a self adjoint regular operator d on h of degree one such that for all f c 0 r we have f x f d x for all x h moreover if is strict then h is complemented graded k theory functional calculus and elliptic operators 5 and f f d l h l h if is nondegenerate then h h and if c 0 r k h then d has compact resolvents proof let a l h let d domain d a be the self adjoint regular operator on a c 0 r a from the previous proposition such that f f d let i a l h be the identity define h c 0 r h a ih which is a closed hilbert submodule of h define d d i 1 on domain d domain d ih cc r h by proposition 10 7 11 d extends to a self adjoint regular operator on h d i d in the notation of 11 if x h we compute that f d x f d i 1 x f d i 1 x f d ix f x if is strict then h is a complemented submodule of h by proposition 5 8 11 and so l h includes as a graded subalgebra of l h the result now easily follows note that if is the zero homomorphism then h 0 and d 0 so f d 0 f 4 graded k theory standing assumptions throughout this section a will denote a complex unital graded c algebra and c 0 r and k will have the gradings as in example 2 1 let ha denote the hilbert a module of all sequences an 1 a such that n 1 a kak 1 converges in a it has a natural grading into sequences of even and odd elements let h a ha h op a where h op a denotes ha with the opposite grading this is the standard graded hilbert module for a we have the following very important result of kasparov in the theory of graded hilbert modules stabilization theorem kasparov 10 if h is a countably generated graded hilbert a module then h h a h a it is a standard result thata k is graded isomorphic tok h a the c algebra of compact operators on h a with the induced grading see 14 7 1 3 for the remainder of this section we will identify a k k h a from stabilization conjugation by the graded isomorphism h a h a h a determines a unitary in l h a m a k of degree zero lemma 4 1 let u m a k be a unitary of degree zero there is a strictly continuous path of degree zero unitaries ut t 0 1 m a k such that u 1 u and u 0 1 proof write k k h h where h l 2 0 1 then m a k contains a copy of l h h let vt be a strictly continuous path of isometries in l h with pt vtv t 0 strongly as t 0 as in proposition 12 2 2 3 set vt vt vt l h h and note that each vt has degree zero set wt 1 vt which also has degree zero and let ut wtuw t 1 wtw t 6 jody trout for t 0 and u 0 1 it is easy to check that this works definition 4 2 let a have grading automorphism define k a k a c 0 r a k define a binary operation on k a by direct sum where the direct sum is with respect to the graded isomorphism h a h a h a theorem 4 3 k a is an abelian group under the direct sum operation and satisfies the relation u u where u u 0 1 1 0 on h a ha ha proof it follows from lemma 4 1 and the proof of theorem 3 1 in rosenberg 15 carried over to the graded case that k a is an abelian monoid with zero given by the zero or any null homotopic homomorphism we only need to show inverses let c 0 r k h a be graded let d be the regular operator on h h a associated to from the converse functional calculus via stabilization h h a h a and lemma 4 1 we may assume up to graded homotopy that is strict by proposition 5 8 11 thus f f d for all f c 0 r then d op udu on the hilbert module h is the operator associated to u u since by the functional calculus f dop f udu uf d u u f u let be the grading on h a for each t 0 define dt d t t dop on h h op h a and let dt 0 on the complement define t c 0 r k h a by t f f dt for t 0 we have 0 f f d 0 u u note that d 2 t d t t dop 2 d 2 t 2 0 0 dop 2 t 2 and so the spectrum of dt is contained outside the interval t t therefore f dt sup f x x spec dt 0 as t for all f c 0 r and the result follows definition 4 4 a k cycle for a graded c algebra a is an ordered pair h t such that h h 0 h 1 is a countably generated graded hilbert a module and t l h where l h is the graded c algebra of all bounded a linear operators on h with adjoint which satisfies the following conditions i t is of degree one ii t t k h is compact iii t 2 1 k h is compact graded k theory functional calculus and elliptic operators 7 the k cycle is called degenerate if t 2 1 by a standard argument we may assume that t t is self adjoint there is an obvious notion of unitary equivalence for two k cycles 3 10 two k cycles h 0 t 0 and h 1 t 1 are homotopic if there is a k cycle h t for a 0 1 such that h evia t evi 1 are unitarily equivalent to hi ti where evt a 0 1 a are the evaluation maps a collection h tt t 0 1 of k cycles for a is called an operator homotopy if t 7 tt is norm continuous in t an operator homotopy induces a homotopy h t by defining h c 0 1 h and t f t tt f t for f 0 1 h proposition 4 5 theorem 4 1 10 the set kk c a of all equivalence classes of k cycles for a under the equivalence relation generated by homotopy is an abelian group under the relations h 1 t 1 h 2 t 2 h 1 h 2 d 1 d 2 h t hop t the class of any degenerate k cycle is zero in kk c a let u 0 1 1 0 be the degree one unitary with respect to the grading on h h 0 h 1 lemma 4 6 h t h t op kk c a where t op utu proof in the complex world h t h t since they are operator homotopic but not through self adjoint k cycles in general it follows that h t hop t hop t h utu h t op since u hop h implements a unitary equivalence theorem 4 7 k a is isomorphic to kk c a proof let g t t t 2 1 1 2 which defines a degree one self adjoint element in cb r m c 0 r the continuous bounded functions on r define a map k a kk c a via 7 h g d where d is the regular operator associated to c 0 r k h k h a via the converse functional calculus as in theorem 4 3 we may assume that is strict the operator g d is a degree one self adjoint element of m k h a l h a and g d 2 1 is compact since g d 2 1 d 2 1 1 g k h this map is easily seen to be well defined since applying the construction to a graded homotopy c 0 r k h a 0 1 yields a homotopy of k cycles by using the graded isomorphism k h a 0 1 a k 0 1 a 0 1 k k h a 0 1 8 jody trout it is also distributes over direct sums and maps u u 7 h g d op h g d via properties of the functional calculus and lemma 4 6 the reverse map is defined using the techniques of baaj and julg 2 let h f be a k cycle for a we may assume that f f and h h a let t 0 be a strictly positive element of k h a of degree zero which commutes with f any two such operators are operator homotopic via the straight line homotopy let d ft 1 note that domain d range t is a dense submodule of h a one has that d d and d 2 1 1 t 2 f 2 t 2 1 is compact we have the identity g d f f 2 t 2 1 2 and so it also follows that h a f and h a g d are operator homotopic it follows from the identity d i 1 d d 2 1 1 i d 2 1 1 that the resolvents are also compact define kk c a k a by sending h a f to the graded homotopy class of the graded homomorphism f 7 f d k h a as above k h a 0 1 k h a 0 1 so a homotopy h a 0 1 f is mapped to a homotopy c 0 r k h a 0 1 thus the reverse map is well defined one checks easily that these two maps are inverses to each other if a is trivially graded and unital then a k m 2 a k with even grading given by diag 1 1 that is m 2 a k is graded into diagonal and off diagonal matrices it follows from the above that k a c 0 r a k k 0 a we will describe the isomorphism directly via the more familiar language of projections it is a standard result that k 0 a is the group of formal differences of homotopy classes of projections p p p 2 a k with addition given by direct sum p q p q where p h p q h q and p q let u m 2 m a k be the degree one unitary u 0 1 1 0 recall that for any self adjoint involution w i e w w w 2 1 there is an associated projection p w 1 2 w 1 let x p q k 0 a where p and q are projections in a k define a map x c 0 r m 2 a k by the formula x f f 0 p 0 0 f 0 q f c 0 r graded k theory functional calculus and elliptic operators 9 this defines a homomorphism since p p 2 p similarly for q and is graded since f 0 0 for any odd function note that the homotopy class of x depends only on the homotopy classes of p and q now we define a map k 0 a k a by mapping x 7 x it also follows that p f q f f 0 diag p q diag 0 0 diag 0 0 diag 0 0 h f 0 p q 0 0 0 p q f and so it is additive for x p q we have x q p maps to x f f 0 q 0 0 f 0 p u x f u thus x u xu x x one should note that with the grading present x and x are not homotopic through graded homomorphisms since u has degree one and the identity has degree zero conversely given k a extend to a graded homomorphism c 0 r a k by adjoining a unit let z denote the unitary given by the cayley transform z t t i t i 1 2 ir t where r t t i 1 is the resolvent function let u denote the unitary u z 1 2 i r a k a simple computation shows that u 2 1 and u u we also have that and 2 1 consider the associated projections p p u a k by the definition of u above we see that p p u 2 i r a k also a homotopy of induces a homotopy of the unitary u and thus of p u we define k a k 0 a by p p u k 0 a a simple computation shows that 1 we only need to show is onto it then follows that 1 is a homomorphism since a is trivially graded h a ha ha with each factor determining the grading again identify a k k h a let k a up to graded homotopy we may assume that c 0 r k h a is strict via stabilization let d 0 d d 0 10 jody trout on h a be the self adjoint regular operator of degree one with compact resolvents from the converse functional calculus such that f f d let g d d d 2 1 1 2 which is a self adjoint bounded operator of degree one on h a with g d 2 1 compact by a graded homotopy we may assume that f f g d f g d note that the diffeomorphism g r 1 1 is the homotopy inverse to the inclusion 1 1 r thus we can write g d 0 g g 0 on ha ha where g ha ha is a generalized fredholm operator 18 up to a compact perturbation of g which would induce a graded homotopy we may assume that ker g d ker g ker g is a finite projective a module in h a and is thus complemented note that for x ker g d we have f g d x f 0 x since a is trivially graded ker g and ker g are finite projective a modules let p k ha be the compact projections onto ker g let x p p indexa g k 0 a 18 a graded homotopy connecting to the graded homomorphism x f f 0 p 0 0 f 0 p k ha ha k h a is given by t f f t 1 g d t 0 x f t 0 thus x and so is onto as was desired corollary 4 8 if a is unital and trivially graded then the maps and are inverses 5 elliptic operators over c algebras in this section we will show how the previous results and the functional calculus give explicit realizatons as graded homomorphisms of the k theory symbol class and fredholm index of an elliptic differential operator with coefficients in a trivially graded c algebra leta be a trivially graded unital c algebra andm be a smooth closed riemann ian manifold let e m and f m be smooth vector a bundles that is smooth locally trivial fiber bundles on m whose fibers ep and fp are finite projective a modules for each p m let c e denote the vector space of smooth sections of e which is a module over a similarly for c f let d c e c f be an elliptic differential a operator of order n on m 13 17 if a c then d is an or dinary differential operator let d e f denote the principal symbol of d which is a homomorphism of vector a bundles where t m m is the cotangent bundle the condition of ellipticity is the requirement that for each non zero cotangent vector 6 0 t pm the principal symbol d ep fp is an isomorphism of a modules equipping the fibers ep and fp with smoothly varying hilbert a module struc tures p ep ep a graded k theory functional calculus and elliptic operators 11 defines a pre hilbert a module structure on c e via the formula s s m s p s p p dvolm a for s s c e where dvolm is the riemannian volume measure on m and any two such structures are homotopic via the straight line homotopy it follows that an adjoint differential operator dt c f c e exists and is of the same order as d the principal symbol of the adjoint is the adjoint of the principal symbol d t d l fp ep for t pm consider the formally self adjoint differential a operator of degree one d 0 dt d 0 c e c f c e c f on the graded pre hilbert a module c e c f the principal symbol of d is the self adjoint bundle morphism of degree one d 0 0 e f e f on the graded pull back vector a bundle e f lemma 5 1 the resolvents i 1 e f e f are vector a bundle morphisms which vanish at infinity on t m in the operator norm induced by the hilbert a module structures on the fibers ep fp proof follows from homogeneity p t tn p and ellipticity form the cayley transform 14 u i i 1 1 2 i i 1 by complementing the vector a bundles e and f e g e g m an we may embed e f in a trivial a bundle a t m an an now extend the automorphism u to the a bundle a by defining it to be equal to the identity on the complement of e f in a from the lemma above it follows that u extends continuously to the trivial a bundle on the one point compactification t m by setting u i let diag 1 1 be the grading of the trivial a bundle t m an an since it follows as in the previous section u 2 1 and u u we also have obviously that and 2 1 therefore we obtain two projection valued sections p p u t m end a on t m which are equal at infinity we can view them as projection valued func tions t m m 2 mn a m 2 n a both define elements in k 0 c t m a and so their difference defines an element d p p u k 0 c 0 t m a 12 jody trout this is the symbol class of the elliptic a operator d as constructed in 7 14 17 by corollary 4 8 and stability it follows that k 0 c 0 t m a c 0 r c 0 t m m 2 n a and d is identified with the graded homotopy class of the graded homomorphism c 0 r c 0 t m m 2 n a m 2 n c 0 t m a given fiber wise by the ordinary matrix functional calculus f f d m 2 n a for t m the principal symbol d e f determines a class d k 0 a t m the topological k theory of t m defined via vector a bundles since it is a bundle morphism that is an isomorphism off the compact zero section m t m by the mingo serre swan theorem 12 16 we havek 0 a t m k 0 c 0 t m a which is induced via the action of taking sections as for the case a c it thus follows from this and the constructions in the previous section that all three of these symbol classes can be identified proposition 5 2 d d k 0 a t m k 0 c 0 t m a let l 2 e denote the completion of the pre hilbert a module c e the differential a operator d defines an essentially self adjoint regular operator of degree one on the graded hilbert a module hd l 2 e l 2 f we replace d by its closure d which is self adjoint since d is elliptic the resolvents d i 1 are compact this follows from the parallel sobolev theory for differential a operators 13 the complementation of the bundles e and f above allows a coherent inclusion with the previous constructions hd l 2 a l 2 m a 2 n which induces a graded inclusion of c algebras k hd m 2 n k a by the functional calculus for self adjoint regular operators 11 we obtain a graded homomorphism d c 0 r m 2 n k a f 7 f d recall that the usual definition of the generalized fredholm analytic index indexa d in terms of kernel and cokernel modules requires compact perturbations for a gen eral c algebra a 13 18 this is incorporated in the computations in the proof of corollary 4 8 so we see that the functional calculus for d gives this index proposition 5 3 indexa d d k 0 a naturally associated to m and a is an asymptotic morphism of c algebras t t 1 c 0 t m a k l 2 m a which is defined via fourier transforms and a partition of unity up to asymptotic equivalence for complete details on the construction see 5 7 17 the induced map k 0 a t m k 0 c 0 t m a k 0 a on k theory is useful for doing index theoretic and k theoretic calculations with elliptic operators if m rn the induced map is bott periodicity k 0 c 0 r 2 n a k 0 a 17 the following result implies the exact form of the mishchenko fomenko index theorem 13 hence the atiyah singer index theorem 1 when a c as proved originally by higson 7 graded k theory functional calculus and elliptic operators 13 theorem 5 4 lemma 4 6 17 if d is an elliptic differential a operator of order one on m then d indexa d k 0 a the proof reduces to composing the graded symbol homomorphism c 0 r m 2 n c 0 t m a f 7 f with the matrix inflation of this fundamental asymptotic morphism for m and a t m 2 n c 0 t m a m 2 n k a and comparing this to the continuous family of graded operator homomorphisms td t 1 c 0 r m 2 n a k f 7 f t 1 d one then proves 17 via fourier analysis and a compactness argument that for any f c 0 r lim t t f f t 1 d 0 and so the composition t is asymptotically equivalent to t d therefore by stability and homotopy invariance of the induced map 5 6 t d d k 0 a the result now follows by propositions 5 2 and 5 3 references 1 m f atiyah and i m singer the index of elliptic operators i annals
