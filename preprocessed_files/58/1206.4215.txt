short intrinsic proof is given for the bourgain brezis mironescu theorem with an extension for higher order gradient forms this argument illustrates the role of functional geom etry and fourier analysis for obtaining embedding estimates new hausdorff young inequalities are obtained for fractional embedding as an extension of the classical aronszajn smith formula these results include bilinear fractional embedding as suggested by the landau collision oper ator in plasma dynamics functional forms that characterize smoothness lie at the heart of understanding and rigor ously describing the many body interactions that determine the behavior of dynamical phe nomena coupled with the establishment of sharp embedding estimates our overall objective is to expand the working framework for n dimensional fourier analysis while gaining new in sight into uncertainty restriction phenomena and the role of geometric symmetry efforts to obtain optimal constants bring out new features of exact model problems encoded geometric information and precise lower order effects 1 bourgain brezis mironescu theorem let 4 2 2 0 1 p n and 0 1 the main purpose here is to establish embedding estimates for the besov norms rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy the intrinsic character of these norms captures the interplay between dilation and translation on r n classically such norms measure how differentiability controls function size and determines restriction behavior the bourgain brezis mironescu theorem corresponds to the estimate for 0 1 and 1 p n 15 16 31 and p 521 in 30 rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy c rn f q dx p q q pn n p for p 2 the best constant c is calculated by the author in 11 n 2 1 n 2 2 n 2 1 n 2 n 2 n this result extends to include fractional powers of the laplacian 1 http arxiv org abs 1206 4215 v 2 2 william beckner theorem 1 for f s rn 0 1 and 1 p n rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy c rn f q dx p q q pn n p 1 theorem 2 for p 2 n the value of c in theorem 1 is given by c 2 1 n 2 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 proof of theorem 1 this result follows by application of four lemmas utilizing symmetrization stein weiss techniques and the general hardy littlewood sobolev inequality set g f step 1 apply the symmetrization lemma below to obtain rn rn g x g y p x y n p dx dy rn rn g x g y p x y n p dx dy 3 where g is the equimeasurable radial decreasing rearrangement of g on rn step 2 use lemma 1 below see theorem 4 1 in 11 to obtain rn rn g x g y p x y n p dx dy dp rn x p g x p dx 4 with dp rn 1 x p x n p dx for n p p n q and sn 1 step 3 recall that q pn n p and let sn denote the surface area of the n dimensional unit sphere since g x is non negative and radial decreasing g x c x n q c n sn 1 1 q g

c f lq rn with c a generic constant and 1 q 1 q n which holds for q np n p and q np n p this completes the proof of theorem 1 embedding estimates and fractional smoothness 3 remark one could look for an alternate proof using lemma 1 but without first applying symmetrization the idea would be to use a stein weiss argument see appendix to 10 depending on young s inequality for convolution but the singularity in the convolution kernel is too strong to effectively use such a simple approach symmetrization lemma for f g measurable functions on rn with f g denoting the equimeasurable radial decreasing rearrangement of f g k x radial decreasing and p 1 rn rn k x y f x g y p dx dy rn rn k x y f x g y p dx dy 6 more generally for a radial monotone increasing function and a convex function on r satisfying 1 t 0 0 0 2 convex and monotone increasing t 0 3 t t convex rn rn k x y f x g y x y dx dy rn rn k x y f x g y x y dx dy 7 the development of this lemma was outlined in the author s paper 5 and motivated by earlier ideas of ahlfors 1 see lemma 2 2 pages 34 35 perhaps inspired by hardy and littlewood 24 but expanding on themes in hardy littlewood and po lya 25 also see baernstein taylor 3 details of the proof are given in the appendix below application of the symmetrization lemma is necessary for step 3 in the proof of theorem 1 but generally there is no difficulty in making a reduction to radial functions for the embedding forms described here reduction lemma let translation be a generic representation for any transitive action on a manifold for which the volume form is invariant then for k non negative and integrable and 1 p m m k u v f u g v p du dv m k u du f lp m g lp m p 8 proof m m k u v f u g v p du dv m k u m f u v g v p dv du m k u du f lp m g lp m p by using r e r 1 e on sn 1 one obtains from this reduction lemma rn rn k x y f x g y p dx dy rn rn k x y f x g y p dx dy 9 where f x sn 1 f x p d 1 p g y sn 1 g y p d 1 p with d denoting standard surface measure on the sphere 4 william beckner lemma 1 let f s rn 0 1 and 1 p n then rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy dp rn x p f x p dx 10 dp rn 1 x p x n p dx for n p p and sn 1 proof the first step is to apply the symmetrization lemma to obtain rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy then set t x s y h t x n p f x then inequality 10 for f will be equivalent to the inequality on the multiplicative group r r r g x t h t g t s h s p s t ds s dt t dp r h t p dt t 11 where g t t n p 2 p t sn 1 t 1 t 2 1 n p 2 d and d denotes standard surface measure on sn 1 note that is symmetric under inversion apply the triangle inequality lemma below using g 1 p as the second function in the lemma and one finds that dp r t 2 t 2 p t dt t rn 1 x p x n p dx where n p p and sn 1 since the determination of dp depends only on application of the triangle inequality the constant must be optimal as observed by a suitable variation of functions in that inequality to finish the proof of the lemma 1 observe the result that rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy dp rn x p f x p dx dp rn x p f x p dx lemma 2 triangle inequality for f g h lp rm 1 p rm rm g y x f x h x y

m pf x one observes that the inequality is optimal a slightly more general form of lemma 1 can be given that reflects the general stein weiss structure for fractional integrals see the appendix in 5 and uses an analogous proof though depending on radial reduction rather than symmetrization stein weiss lemma suppose k is a non negative symmetric kernel defined on rn rn con tinuous on any domain that excludes the diagonal homogeneous of degree n k u v n k u v 0 min n p and k ru rv k u v for any r so n then for f s rn and p 1 rn rn f x f y pk x y dx dy dp rn x f x p dx 13 dp rn 1 x pk x dx for n p and sn 1 this constant is optimal but note that there is no assumption made that it is finite the last lemma required for the proof of theorem 1 is the hardy littlewood sobolev in equality hardy littlewood sobolev inequality for f lp rn 0 n 1 p n and 1 q 1 p n then 1 x n f lq rn c f lp rn 14 and equivalently f lq rn c f lp rn 15 where c is a generic constant a standard proof of this inequality is given by stein using interpolation see theorem 1 in chapter 5 in 32 but a more intrinsic proof using young s inequality and radial symmetry fol lows by first applying symmetrization and then transferring the inequality to the multiplicative 6 william beckner group r once simply checks that the function t t n 1 p 1 2 2 n sn 1 t 1 t 2 2 1 1 n 2 d t 0 is in lr r for r n n see also the discussion of the stein weiss theorem in the appendix to 10 observe that initial integration on the sphere is necessary for the application of young s inequality proof of theorem 2 apply the classical formula of aronszajn smith see 32 and appendix to 11 rn rn f x f y 2 x y n 2 dx dy d rn 2 2 f 2 d 16 d 2 n 2 2 1 n 2 and use the dual form of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality due to lieb rn 2 2 f 2 d c f lq rn 2 with c n 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n putting these two statements together gives theorem 2 corollary for f s rn 0 1 and 1 p n 1 rn rn f x f y p x y n p dx dy c rn f q dx p q q pn n p 1 17 proof observe that by using the aronszajn smith formula rn rn f x f y 2 x y n p dx dy rn rn 1 f x 1 f y 2 x y n p dx dy and for g f rn rn f x f y 2 x y n p dx dy rn rn g x g y p x y n p dx dy follow the steps in the proof of theorem 1 where after step 3 one has for q pn n p and using the sobolev inequality rn f q dx p q c rn f q dx p q 18 for q pn n p 1 this gives the statement of the corollary

will be useful here the analysis developed above is applied to the forms rn rn f x g y f y g x x y n dx dy rn rn f x g y f y g x p x y n dx dy as expected from classical fourier analysis these forms can be related to convolution formulas both on the function side and on the fourier transform side theorem 4 for real valued f s rn 0 1 and f x f x rn rn x y n f x f y f y f x dx dy 2 rn x n f f x dx

observe that in fact the finiteness of the embedding norm implies that f g lp rn lq rn the sharp value of the constant for p 2 can be obtained using the aronszajn smith formula for r 2 n and then applying theorem 2 for 0 while this analysis is instructive and perhaps useful in understanding collision dynamics it does reflect that restriction to product functions will not accurately show the appropriate control by multilinear embedding see discussion on page 185 in 12 4 fractional smoothing on the heisenberg group the heisenberg group is a natural setting to study problems with mixed homogeneity as a nilpotent lie group it gives the simplest extension of rn where homogeneity is broken but a substantive part of the euclidean translation group action is retained moreover the group possesses an sl 2 r symmetry associated with its dilation structure which brings into play the non unimodular group associated with the hyperbolic plane the complexity of the sym metry structure makes some questions arising from euclidean analysis hard while other issues become relatively simple to sort out with multiple approaches this framework highlights the intrinsic tension between viewing a nilpotent semisimple group arising from complex geometry versus a manifold with non positive curvature and a non unimodular group action as the most characteristic extension of rn the heisenberg group hn is realized as the boundary of the siegel upper half space in cn 1 d z cn 1 im zn 1 z 1 2 zn 2 then hn w z t z cn t r with the group action ww z t z t z z t t 2 im zz and haar measure on the group

smoothness two examples expanding on besov norms and stein weiss fractional integrals are developed here but first as a technical tool to facilitate application relative to problems with mixed

above by combining methods taken from earlier papers see theorem 3 in 8 theorem 5 in 10 one can obtain sharp estimates for stein weiss fractional integrals on the heisenberg group as maps from lp hn

for j is well defined analysis on the heisenberg group reflects the characteristic property that the transitive group action breaks the closely coupled euclidean translation and homogeneity in a way that does not allow intrinsic symmetries to clearly determine precise estimates the complexity of the intertwining of lower order invariance on the heisenberg group perhaps reflecting the influence of complex geometry does not facilitate decoupling the contrasting symmetries partial discus sion of this behavior is given in arguments contained in the author s paper 6 proofs for the theorems above use integrability for the kernel to simply remove the non euclidean part of the convolution but here a reductioin to functions radial in the z variable will provide alternate proofs that utilize the underlying two dimensional dilation symmetry on hn that corresponds 14 william beckner to the embedded action of sl 2 r and hyperbolic space h 2 start with the metric on the heisenberg group w 1 w z z

bn 1 d where bn cn 2 k 2 1 and d denotes normalized surface measure on the boundary this representation allows not only development of an alternate framework for the proofs of theorems 8 and 9 but gives new insight on the role of embedding and convolution estimates on hyperbolic space hn and non unimodular groups with non positive curvature alternate proof theorem 9 the weighted fractional

pitt s inequality is a natural expression of the uncertainty principle to measure the balance between the relative size of a function and its fourier transform at infinity this underlying structure was outlined in an earlier paper 7 not only does pitt s inequality determine un certainty but it offers insight into the nature of optimal constants and provides an asymptotic upper bound for the constant given by the extended uncertainty inequality rn f 2 dx 2 b rn x f 2 dx rn f 2 d 31 embedding estimates and fractional smoothness 17 with b 4 n for 0 observe that if the non optimal constant taken from pitt s inequality is used for b n 4 n 4 2 then one obtains the sharp logarithmic uncertainty inequality in the limit 0 appendix proof of the symmetrization lemma the two point inequality lies at the heart of many results on rearrangement and sym metrization echoing a central spirit from the work of hardy and littlewood here the simplest form is given by the numerical inequality for sets of distinct positive real numbers a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 with a 1 b 2 a 2 b 2 a b a b where c max c 1 c 2 and c min c 1 c 2 extending to finite sequences ck with c k given by sequential rearrangement in terms of decreasing size n 1 akbk n 1 a kb k the symmetrization lemma used in the argument for theorem 1 above corresponds to a two function rearrangement inequality and its proof depends on two simple ideas which are outwardly independent of the geometric character of lebesgue measure 1 symmetrization of functions or sets can be achieved as the limit of a sequence of lower dimensional symmetrizations 2 rearrangement inequalities involving only two functions can often be obtained from symmetrization on two points the argument depends on having a manifold with a reflection symmetry that divides the space into two equivalent half spaces with the property that for two points p q in the same half space then dist p q dist p q where q is the reflection of q into the other half space in addition one needs a transitive group action that moves points on the manifold around two point symmetrization lemma consider a finite measure space m invariant under an involution symmetry suppose m has a mutually disjoint decomposition m m m p with p x m x x being a set of measure zero m m and d x y d x y for s y m k and are two nonnegative functions defined on m m with i k x y k x y x y x y ii k x y k x y x y x y for x y m is a nonnegative function defined on 0 with the following properties 0 0 convex and monotone increasing 0 0 and f t convex define f x max f x f x and f x min f x f x for x m and functions defined everywhere on m then m m f x g y x y k x y dx dy m m f x g y x y k x y dx dy 32 the key to the proof of this two point inequality lies with two simple observations 18 william beckner lemma 4 for convex with 0 0 and nonnegative numerical sequences a 1 a 2 and b 1 b 2 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 33 proof this result is determined by applying the property of convex functions that slopes are increasing that is s t t is increasing in t lemma 5 for convex 0 0 and t t convex then t a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 34 is nondecreasing for 0 proof observe that t t convex implies that t 0 which determines that not only does a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 not increase under rearrangement but that the variation does not decrease under scaling increase proof m m f x g y x y k x y dx dy m m f x g y x y f x g y x y k x y f x g y x y f x g y x y k x y dx dy m m f x g y x y f x g y x y k x y x y dx dy m m f x g y x y f x g y x y f x g y x y f x g y x y k x y dx dy m m f x g y x y f x g y x y f x g y x y f x g y x y k x y dx dy since is convex the first integral decreases when f and g are replaced by f and g using lemma 4 since t t is convex the second integral decreases when f and g are replaced by f and g using lemma 5 finally the third integral is invariant under symmetrization hence the proof of the two point symmetrization lemma is complete by using simple point wise estimates for the integrand corollary strict monotonicity assume that k x y k x y for x y m is strictly convex and there exist sets of positive measure a and b in m with f x f x for x a and g x g x for x b then inequality 32 becomes a strict inequality to complete the proof of the symmetrization lemma for the classical manifolds rn sn and h n hyperbolic space the two curved spaces can be represented as sitting in rn 1 with a embedding estimates and fractional smoothness 19 preferred point of reference and a euclidean half space is specified so that reflection across the half space has the required property for the metric namely reflection symmetry increases distance between points in the sense that dist x y dist x y for two points x and y in the specified half space symmetrization lemma let m be a geometric manifold that possesses 1 a transitive group action under which the metric is invariant and 2 reflection symmetry as defined above equimeasurable radial decreasing rearrangement is defined in terms of geodesic distance let k be nonnegative functions defined on 0 with the following properties i 0 0 convex and monotone increasing 0 and t t convex ii k monotone decreasing and iii monotone increasing and d x y is the distance between x and y then for measurable functions f and g m m f x f y d x y k d x y dx dy m m f x f y d x y k d x y dx dy 35 if k is strictly decreasing and is strictly convex then strict inequality holds unless f x f x and g x g x with 1 and x a translate of x or in the case of a finite measure one of the functions f g is constant almost everywhere in the case is constant the last condition in the hypothesis on can be dropped proof fix an origin inm and choose a hyperplane that does not pass through this point m will denote the half space containing the origin and will be reflection through this hyperplane by possibly changing values on a set of measure zero f and g will be defined everywhere on m choose a sequence of two point symmetrizations which when applied to f g give sequences fn gn that converge almost everywhere to the radial decreasing rearrangements f g on m each two point symmetrization applied to a function gives a rearrangement of that function the two point lemma shows that m m fn x gn y d x y k d x y dx dy is a decreasing sequence of numbers as n applying fatou s lemma to this sequence of non negative l 1 m m functions gives inequality 35 if f and g are not almost everywhere radial decreasing functions with respect to the same fixed point on m then the first two point symmetrization can be chosen to give a strict decrease in the inequality this fact is equivalent to the existence of a half space m such that the set x y m m f x f x g y g y 0 has positive measure acknowledgements i would
