r 2 s 1 n 1 a goursat distribution is a rank l s distribution on a manifold m of dimension l 2 s such that each element of its flag of lie squares d ds ds 1 ds ds dj 1 dj dj d 0 tm is of codimension 1 in the following one since 2000 goursat distributions were generalized in many works 7 12 13 14 15 20 special k flags k 2 which are considered to be extensions of goursat flags were defined in 7 14 and 20 in several equivalent ways all these approaches can be reduced to one transparent definition see 1 24 a special k flag of length s on a manifold m of dimension s 1 k 1 is a sequence of distributions ds ds 1 ds ds dj 1 dj dj d 0 tm such that the respective dimensions of ds ds 1 d 0 are k 1 2 k 1 s 1 k 1 for j 1 s 1 the cauchy characteristic subdistribution l dj of dj is included in dj 1 of constant corank one l ds 0 and there exists a completely integrable subdistribution f d 1 of corank one in d 1 the integer k is called width the purpose of this work is to show that the problem of modeling car towing n trailers can be generalized to the problem of modeling kinematic problem for an articulated arm constituted of n 1 segments in rk 1 such that to this model is naturally associated a special k flag in the following an articulated arm of length n 1 is a series of n 1 segments mi mi 1 i 0 n 1 in rk 1 keeping a constant length li and the articulation occurs at points mi for i 1 n it is proposed to study the kinematic evolution of such a mechanical system under the constraint that the velocity of each point mi is collinear with the segment mi mi 1 for i 0 n such a system is also studied in 10 and is called a n bar system in this paper we define precisely the kinematic evolution of this mechanical system in term of hyperspherical coordinates and we construct the special multi flag naturally associated to this model 1 universite de savoie laboratoire de mathe matiques lama campus scientifique 73376 le bourget du lac cedex france mail pelletier

version for k 1 an articulated arm of length n is a modeling problem of a car with n trailers see 3 when the number of trailers is large this problem can be considered as an approximation of the nonholonomic snake in the plane see 23 for instance for k 1 we can also consider a snake in rk 1 see 22 for a complete description again an articulated arm of length n for n large can be considered as a discretization of a nonholonomic snake in rk 1 for instance in r 3 some problems of towed cable can model in such a way 17 23 in section 2 we recall the classic context of the car with n trailers and its interpretation in terms of goursat distribution the articulated arm system is developed in section 3 and also we show how to associate a special multi flags to such a system in cartesian coordinates in section 4 we gives a version of the kinematic evolution of an articulated arm in terms of angular coordinates and we get a generalization of the classical model of the car with n trailers the last two sections are devoted to the proofs of the results 2 the car with n trailers in this section we will recall some fundamental results about the system of the car with n trailers and its relation with the goursat distribution all these results are now classical and can be found in a large number of papers as 2 3 11 18 26 and many others 2 1 notations and equations a car with n trailers is a configuration of n 1 trailers in the r 2 plane denoted bym 0 m 1 mn and keeping a constant length between each two trailers it is proposed to study the kinematic evolution of the trailer mn with the constraint that the motion is controlled by the evolution of m 0 which symbolize the car we will use the same representation as m fliess 2 and o j sordalen 26 where the car is represented by two driving wheels connected by an axle it s a kinematic problem with non integrable constraints i e a nonholonomic system due to the rolling without sliding of the wheels the configuration space of the system is characterized by the two dimensional coordinates of mn and n 1 angles whereas there are only two inputs namely one tangential velocity and one angular velocity which represent the action on the steering wheel and on the accelerator of the car consider the system of the car with n trailers and suppose that the distances rr between the different trailers are all equal to 1 we choose as a reference point of a body mn r the midpoint mr between the wheels its coordinates are denoted by xr and yr in a given cartesian frame of the plane r is the angle between the main axis of mn r and the x axis of the frame so the set of all positions of the car with with n trailers is included in a 3 n 1 dimensional space this system is submitted to 2 n holonomic links which give in the previous space the 2 n following equations 1 xr xr 1 cos r 1 yr yr 1 sin r 1 the configuration space of this problem is a submanifold of dimension n 3 which is parame terized by q x 0 y 0 0 n where x 0 y 0 are the coordinates of the last trailer mn n is the orientation of the car the trailer m 0 with respect to the x axis r 0 r n 1 is the orientation of the trailer n r with respect to the x axis the configuration space can thus be identified to r 2 s 1 n 1 the velocity parameters are x 0 y 0 0 n there are only two inputs namely the angular velocity wn and the tangential velocity vn of the midpoint of the guiding wheels associated to the action of the car see 3 assume that the contacts between the wheels and the ground are pure rolling it is then submitted to the classical nonholonomic links 2 x r sin r y r cos r 0 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 3 there are n 1 kinematic equality constraints one for each trailer in order to establish these constraints we can represent the points mr r 0 n in the complex plane i e mr xr iyr the geometric constraint between two consecutive trailers is written as mr mr 1 e i r 1 for r 6 0 by induction we have the following equation 3 mr m 0 r 1 l 0 ei l the kinematic constraint of mn r is m r re i r which is equivalent to i e i r m r 0 where i z denotes the imaginary part of z combining this characterization with the derivative of 3 and using the linearity of i we obtain the kinematic constraints 4 x 0 sin r y 0 cos r r 1 j 0 j cos j r 0 r 0 n combining m r re i r with the derivative of mr 1 mr 2 1 we obtain r r 1 cos r 1 cos r and by induction r n cos n n 1 cos r 1 r so m r n n j r 1 cos j j 1 e i r where n vn is the tangential velocity of the car m 0 the evolution of the system of car with n trailers can be given by the following controlled system with two controls vn tangential velocity and wn normal velocity of m 0 x 0 v 0 cos 0 y 0 v 0 sin 0 0 v 1 sin 1 0 r vr 1 sin r 1 r n 1 vn sin n n 1 n wn 5 the tangential velocity vr of the body mn r is given by vr n j r 1 cos j j 1 vn 4 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 2 2 goursat flag given a smooth distribution d on a manifold m we will use the standard notation d d to denote the smooth distribution generated by the vector fields tangent to d and the lie brackets x y of any pair x y of vector fields tangent to d definition 2 1 a goursat flag of length s on a manifold m of dimension l s 2 is a sequence of distributions on m ds ds 1 d 3 d 2 d 1 d 0 tm s 2 f satisfying the following goursat conditions 1 corang di i i 1 2 s 2 di 1 di di i 1 2 s g each di p is a subspace of tpm of codimension i for any point p m it follows that d i 1 p is a hyperplane in di p for any i 0 1 s 1 and p m definition 2 2 we call any distribution di of corank i 2 in a goursat flag f a goursat distribution to each flag f of goursat distributions we associate a flag of cauchy characteristic subdis tributions l ds l ds 1 l d 3 l d 2 l d 1 l where l d is the subdistribution of d generated by the set of vector fields x tangent to d such that x y is tangent to d for all y tangent to d l d is called the cauchy characteristic distribution of d lemma 2 1 sandwich lemma 11 let d be any goursat distribution of corank s 2 on a manifold m and p be any point of m then l d p l d d p d p with dim l d p dim d p 2 dim l d d p dim d p 1 it follows a relation between the goursat flag and its flag of cauchy characteristic subdistributions ds ds 1 d 3 d 2 d 1 d 0 l ds l ds 1 l ds 2 l d 2 l d 1 each inclusion here is a codimension one inclusion of subbundles of the tangent bundle l di is an involutive regular distribution on m of codimension i 2 2 3 goursat flag associated to the car with n trailers let fnr n j r 1 cos j j 1 and vr f n r vn for r 1 n 1 the motion of the system associated to the car is then characterized by the equation q wnx 1 n q vnx 2 n q it is a controlled system with controls vn and wn vn is the tangential velocity and wn is the angular velocity as we have already seen at the beginning of the section each trajectory of the kinematic evolution of the car towing n trailers is an integral curve of the 2 distribution on r 2 s 1 n 1 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 5 generated by x 1 n n x 2 n cos 0 f n 0 x sin 0 f n 0 y sin 1 0 f n 1 0 sin n n 1 n 1 the distribution generated by xn 1 x n 2 naturally associated to the system of the car with n trailers is a goursat distribution 3 articulated arm the purpose of this section is to construct a distribution of dimension k 1 naturally associated to an n 1 articulated arm and which generates a special k flag of length n 1 on the configuration space c rk 1 sk n 1 moreover the kinematic evolution of this arm is an integral curve of n we begin by recalling the context of special multi flag in the formalism of 1 14 3 1 special multi flags a special k flag of length s is a sequence d ds ds 1 dj d 1 d 0 tm of distributions on a manifold m of dimension s 1 k 1 which satisfies the following conditions i dj 1 dj dj ii ds ds 1 dj d 1 d 0 are of respective ranks k 1 2 k 1 sk 1 s 1 k 1 iii each cauchy characteristic subdistribution l dj of dj is a subdistribution of constant corank one in each dj 1 for j 1 s 1 and l ds 0 iv there exists a completely integrable subdistribution f d 1 of corank one in d 1 remark 3 1 it should be remarked that the covariant subdistribution f d 1 is uniquely deter mined by d 1 itself this covariant subdistribution f is completely described in 1 and 24 where it is defined in terms of the annihilating pfaffian system d 1 t m 7 for a complete clarification on this fact see 16 remark 3 2 in the following we mean by a special multi flag distribution all distribution generating a special multi flag from the definition above we obtain the following sandwich diagram ds ds 1 dj d 1 d 0 tm l ds 1 l ds 2 l dj 1 f all vertical inclusions in this diagram are of codimension one while all horizontal inclusions are of codimension k the squares built by these inclusions can be perceived as certain sandwiches i e each subdiagram number j indexed by the upper left vertices dj dj dj 1 l dj 1 l dj 2 is called sandwich number j we can read the length s of the special k flag by adding one to the total number of sandwiches in the sandwich diagram 6 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version remark 3 3 in a sandwich number j at each point x m in the k 1 dimensional vec tor space dj 1 l dj 1 x we can look for the relative position of the k dimensional subspace l dj 2 l dj 1 x and the 1 dimensional subspace dj l dj 1 x either l dj 2 l dj 1 x dj l dj 1 x dj 1 l dj 1 x or dj l dj 1 x l dj 2 l dj 1 x we say that x m is a regular point if the first situation is true in each sandwich number j for j 1 s otherwise x is called a singular point the set of singular points in the context of an articulated arm is studied in 25 and these results will be published in a future paper 3 2 special multi flags and articulated arm the space rk 1 n 2 will be written as the product rk 10 r k 1 i r k 1 n 1 let xi x 1 i x k 1 i be the canonical coordinates on the space rk 1 i which is equipped with its canonical scalar product rk 1 n 2 is equipped with its canonical scalar product too consider an articulated arm of length n 1 denoted by m 0 mn 1 in this paper we assume that the distances li are all equal to 1 on r k 1 n 2 consider the vector fields zi k 1 r 1 xri 1 x r i xri for i 0 n 6 from our previous assumptions see section 1 the kinematic evolution of the articulated arm is described by a controlled system q n i 0 uizi k 1 r 1 un r xrn 1 7 with the following constraints xi xi 1 1 for i 0 n see 10 chapiter 2 consider the map i x 0 xn 1 xi xi 1 2 1 then the configuration space c is the set x 0 xn 1 such that i x 0 xn 1 0 for i 0 n 8 for i 0 n the vector field ni k 1 r 1 xri 1 x r i xri 1 xri 9 is proportional to the gradiant of i so the tangent space tqc is the subspace of tq r k 1 n 2 which is orthogonal to ni q for i 0 n denote by e the distribution generated by the vector fields z 0 zn x 1 n 1 xk 1 n 1 lemma 3 1 let be the distribution on c defined by q tqc e then is a distribution of dimension k 1 generated by xrn 1 x r n n i 0 n 1 j i 1 ajzi xrn 1 for r 1 k 1 where aj q nj q nj 1 q zj q nj 1 q for j 1 n and an 1 1 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 7 proof any vector field x tangent to e can be written as x n i 0 izi k 1 r 1 r xrn 1 on the other hand on c a vector fields x is tangent to c if and only if x is orthogonal to the vector fields n 0 nn for i 0 n 1 each relation x ni 0 is reduced to i 1 zi 1 izi ni 0 which is equivalent to i i 1 ai 1 10 similarly the relation x ni 0 induces n k 1 r 1 r x r n 1 x r n 11 and from 10 and 11 we get i n j i 1 ai n for i 0 n 1 the properties of are summarized in the following result see also 10 chapiter 2 theorem 3 1 on c the distribution satisfies the following properties 1 is a distribution of rank k 1 2 the distribution is a special k flag on c of length n 1 the first part of theorem 3 1 is a direct consequence of lemma 3 1 part 2 will be proved in section 6 in terms of hyperspherical coordinates 4 the evolution of the articulated arm in a system of angular coordinates given an articulated arm m 0 mn 1 in r k 1 we will show that the constraint controlled system 7 can be written in the same way as 5 in an adapted system of angular coordinates with k 1 controls namely vn the normal velocity of mn 1 and the k components of the tangential velocity of mn 1 theorem 4 1 4 1 hyperspherical coordinates the following map x 0 x 1 xi xn 1 x 0 x 1 x 0 xi xi 1 xn 1 xn implies a global diffeomorphism of rk 1 n 2 into itself and c rk 1 sk n 1 where sk is the canonical sphere in rk 1 in this representation the canonical coordinates on rk 1 n 2 rk 1 n 2 will be denoted by x 0 z 1 zi zn 1 so that is given by x 0 x 0 and zi xi 1 xi for i 0 n via this global chart each point q x 0 x 1 xi xn 1 c can be identified with x 0 z 1 zi zn 1 r k 1 sk n 1 for i 0 n and c can be identified with s rk 1 sk n 1 we will put on sk n 1 charts given by hyperspherical coordinates we first recall some basic facts about this type of coordinates the hyperspherical coordinates in rk 1 are given by the relations 8 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version z 1 1 sin 1 sin k 1 sin k z 2 2 sin 1 sin k 1 cos k z 3 3 sin 1 sin k 2 cos k 1 zk k sin 1 cos 2 zk 1 k 1 cos 1 12 with 2 z 1 2 zk 1 2 0 k 2 and 0 j for 1 j k 1 we consider z the application from 0 0 0 0 2 to r k 1 remark 4 1 the previous expression uses the geographical version of hyperspherical coordinates an another version maybe more usual can be obtained by taking 2 k instead of k and then permuting the functions sine and cosine in each formula however our choice is motivated by the following fact the evolution of the articulated arm of length n 1 written in a such chart see 18 gives exactly the system 5 for n 1 the jacobian matrix d of is sin 1 sin k 1 sin k cos 1 sin k 1 sin k sin 1 sin k 1 cos k sin 1 sin k 1 cos k cos 1 sin k 1 cos k sin 1 sin k 1 sin k cos 1 sin 1 0 0 it is well known that det d 1 k 1 2 k k 1 i 1 sin k i i it follows that d is invert ible only for 0 k 2 and 0 j for j 1 k 1 in the sequence we note 1 k the moving frame on 0 0 0 0 2 that is the image byd of the canonical frame t 1 k consider a point z 1 we note that in this case we have d 1 k where resp j is the column vector of components 1 k 1 resp 1 j k 1 j note that in canonical coordinates this moving frame 1 k can be written z k 1 r 1 r xr and j z k 1 r 1 r j xr 13 and in hyperpsherical coordinates this moving frame is t and j j 14 on the other hand it is well known that det d 1 k 1 2 k k 1 i 1 sin k i i it follows that d is invertible only for 0 k 2 and 0 j for j 1 k 1 the column vectors of the jacobian matrix d are pairwise orthogonal and we have articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 9 2 1 2 1 j 2 sin 1 sin j 1 2 for j 2 k so at each point z the inverse of this jacobian matrix is the transpose of the matrix 1 1 1 1 k k 15 this inverse exists only if 0 k 2 and 0 j for j 1 k 1 consider a hyperspherical chart y a around some a rk 1 and note 1 k its associated moving frame let y a be another hyperspherical chart around some other point a rk 1 such that its domain intersects the domain of note 1 k the moving frame associated to it so at each point of the sphere sa of center a of radius 1 in r k 1 contained in the intersection of these domains we can write a k j 1 bj j 16 the components of these vectors are actually the components of the first column vector of the matrix d 1 d according to 15 we get a k 1 r 1 r r b 1 k 1 r 1 r 1 r bj 1 j k 1 r 1 r j r 17 remark 4 2 the vector k j 1 bj j is nothing but the orthogonal projection of on to tsa 4 2 the evolution of the articulated arm on s coming back to s rk 1 sk n 1 which is considered as a subset in rk 1 n 2 let si i 0 n be the canonical sphere in rk 1 i 1 recall that the canonical coordinates on r k 1 i are denoted by zi z 1 i z r i z k 1 i given a point in the sphere si there exists a hyperspherical chart zi 1 i i i i i 1 i k i defined for 0 k i 2 and 0 j i j 1 k 1 where i 0 0 so for a given point q x 0 z 1 zi zn 1 s we get a chart id x 0 0 1 n centered at q such that its restriction to i 1 i 0 n induces a chart of s centered at q for i 0 n in a neighborhood of each zi 1 r k 1 i 1 we consider the moving frame ri i 1 i k i remark 4 3 1 given q x 0 xn 1 c for i 0 n denote by s i the sphere in r k 1 of center xi and radius 1 one can put on r k 1 the hyperspherical coordinates yi i i i xi as xi 1 belongs to s i on a neighborhood of xi 1 we have also the following moving frame again denoted ri ri i 1 i k i note that on xi 1 the outward normal unit vector of s i is i xi 1 and 1 i xi 1 k i xi 1 is a basis txi 1 s i 10 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 2 from part 1 if q we get an isomorphism from t s to tx 0 r m 1 tx 1 s 0 txn 1 s n so we can identify t s with tx 0 r n 1 tx 1 s 0 txn 1 s n notations 4 1 in hyperspherical coordinates we define on s 1 ai k 1 r 1 ri 1 r i for i 1 n and an 1 1 2 z 0 k 1 r 1 r 0 xr 3 zi k j 1 b j i j i 1 for i 1 n with b 1 i k 1 r 1 ri 1 1 i 1 ri for i 1 n b j i 1 i 1 j i 1 k 1 r 1 ri 1 j i 1 ri for i 1 n and j 2 k 4 x im im for i 1 k m 0 n 5 x 0 m m i 0 f imzi for m 0 n with f rm m j r 1 aj for r 0 m 1 and f m m 1 for m 0 n 6 n the distribution generated by x 0 n x 1 n x k n with previous notations remark 4 4 1 for i 0 n consider i the column matrix of components 1 i k 1 i and d i 1 the matrix composed by the last k rows of the jacobian matrix of the application i 1 finally denote by i resp x the column matrix of components 1 i k i resp x 1 xk 1 for i 0 n so we can write z 0 t x 0 and zi t i 1 d i 1 1 i for i 1 n 2 according to remark 4 3 part 2 in the identification t s tx 0 r n 1 tx 1 s 0 txn 1 s n the component of x 0 n on txi s i 1 is exactly f i nzi with the previous notations we have the following result theorem 4 1 1 on s the distribution n is the image by of the distribution where c s is the diffeomorphism defined at the beginning of subsection 4 1 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 11 2 the evolution of the articulated arm of length n 1 is described in a chart by the following controlled system with k 1 controls x 1 v 0 1 0 x 2 v 0 2 0 x k 1 v 0 k 1 0 10 v 1 b 1 1 k 0 v 1 b k 1 1 i vi 1 b 1 i 1 ki vi 1 b k i 1 1 n 1 vnb 1 n kn 1 vnb k n 1 n v 1 n kn v kn 18 where vi vn n r i 1 ar and v 1 n v kn vn are the k 1 controls of the system 18 moreover according to remark 4 3 we have v 1 n v kn are the tangential components of the velocity of mn 1 namely the components in the canonical basis of txn 1 s n of the orthogonal projection of the velocity of mn 1 vi 1 is the normal velocity of mi for all i 1 n 1 namely the components of the orthogonal projection of the velocity of mi on the direction generated by i 1 xi remark 4 5 equations of system 18 for k 1 are exactly with the same notations the classical modeling of the car with n trailers 2 3 8 19 26 remark 4 6 according to remark 3 3 for k 2 a point q x 0 z 1 zn 1 is singular if and only if there exists an index 0 i n such that ai q 0 which is equivalent to mi 1 mi and mi mi 1 are orthogonal in mi in this situation the velocity all mj points are zero for j i the set of such points is studied in 25 5 proof of theorem 4 1 for part 1 it is sufficient to prove that any germ curve in c is tangent to at a point q c if and only if is tangent to the distribution generated by x 0 n x 1 n x k n at q let be t x 0 t x 1 t xn 1 t a curve in c defined on with 0 q we have xi xi 1 zi for i 1 n 1 19 assume that is tangent to it follows that we have for each t x i 1 vi 1 zi for i 1 n 1 20 in view of 20 by differentiation of 19 we get x i vi 1 zi z i for i 1 n 1 21 12 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version for some vi r which depends of t on the other hand in rk 1 we also have the orthogonal decomposition zi 1 zi 1 zi zi z i i 0 n 22 where z i is the othogonal projection of zi 1 on to the hyperplan orthogonal to zi 23 so we get x i vizi 1 vi zi 1 zi zi viz i for i 1 n 24 comparing 21 and 24 we get vi 1 vi zi 1 zi and z i viz i for i 1 n 25 for i n 1 we have the orthogonal decomposition x n 1 vn 1 zn 1 z n 1 26 but we also have x n 1 z n 1 x n vnzn 1 z n 1 so from the unicity of the orthogonal decomposition we get vn vn 1 and z n 1 z n 1 27 for i 0 we have of course x 0 v 0 z 1 28 from 25 and 27 we get the relation vi n j i 2 zj 1 zj vn for i 0 n 1 29 on the other hand according to remark 4 3 part 2 as xi s i 1 for t 0 x i can be considered as a vector in txir k 1 and so in the moving frame ri the relations 24 29 and 26 give rise to the following decompositions x i vi 1 i 1 xi vizi for i 1 n and x n 1 vn n xn 1 z n 1 30 where zi resp z n 1 belongs to txi s i 1 pour i 1 n resp txn 1 s n in fact according to 23 and remark 4 3 part 2 zi is the orthogonal projection of d 1 i 1 1 d i i xi 1 on txis i 1 for i 1 n taking in account remark 4 2 and 17 we get the expression of zi given in notations 4 1 for i 1 n moreover the i e component z i of d 0 is vi 1 zi in hyperspherical coordinates for i 1 n on the other hand in the hyperspherical n the vector z n 1 can be written z n 1 k j 1 wj j n finally from 29 and the value of aj we get vi f i nvn for i 0 n on the other hand from 28 as vector in tx 0 r m 1 we have the following decomposition x 0 v 0 m r 1 r 0 xr 0 so according to remark 4 3 part 2 and remark 4 4 part 2 in hyperspherical coordinates we finally obtain that d 0 is tangent n at q articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 13 conversely let be t x 0 t z 1 t zn 1 t a curve in s defined on and such that 0 q assume that in hyperpsherical coordinates is tangent to n and so satisfies the differential equation 18 according to the definitions of zi in hyperpsherical coordinates and taking in account 23 and remark 4 3 part 2 there exists a curve vn t in r such that for any i 1 n we have z i n j i 1 zj 1 zj vn zi 1 zi 1 zi zi for i 1 n and x 0 n j 1 zj 1 zj vh z 1 31 it follows that for i 1 n we have x i x 0 i j 1 z j n l i 1 zj 1 zj vn zi 1 32 so according to 31 and 32 we obtain that t 1 t is a curve in c which is tangent to taking in account part 1 of therorem 4 1 the kinematic evolution of the articulated arm is a controlled system on s which is exactly 18 however for the completeness of the proof of this result we must prove the interpretation of the control in terms of the components of the velocity of mi i 1 n 1 from 30 according to remark 4 3 part 2 in hyperpsherical coordinates n around xn 1 r k 1 the velocity x n 1 of mn 1 can be written x n 1 vn n xn 1 k j 1 v j n j n where vn is the normal velocity of mn 1 and v 1 n v kn are the tangential components of the velocity of mn 1 moreover according to the value of x 0 n the contol parameters are exactly vn v 1 n v kn in the same way for any i 1 n in hyperspherical coordinates i 1 around xi r k 1 the velocity x i of mi has the decomposition x i vi 1 i 1 xi vizi where zi belongs to txi s i 1 so vi 1 the normal velocity of mi 6 proof of theorem 3 1 we will see that the distribution n generates actually a special k flag of length n 1 on a k n 2 1 dimensional manifold let s introduce the following notations m is the distribution generated by x 0 m x 1 m x k m for m 1 n dm 1 is the distribution generated by x 0 m and x 1 j x k j m j n for m 0 n d 0 tm em 1 is the distribution generated by x 1 j x k j m j n for m 0 n 14 articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version proposition 6 1 n is a special k flag distribution more precisely it satisfies the following properties 1 for m 1 n 1 the distributions dm and em are of respective constant dimensions n m 2 k 1 and n m 2 k 2 for m 1 n 1 em is an involutive subdistribution of dm of codimension 1 more over em 1 dm 1 dm for m 1 n actually em 1 is the cauchy characteristic distribution of dm for m 1 n 13 14 3 dm 1 dm 1 dm for all m 0 n 4 n d n 1 dm d 1 d 0 tm en 1 em e 1 proof of proposition 6 1 it is sufficient to show the property 4 the inclusions em 1 dm 1 dm for m n 0 are an easy consequence of 4 and the properties 1 2 and 3 are always true according to the definition of spaces em dm and m denote by 0 the distribution generated by x 10 xk 10 for all m 1 n 1 we have dm em 1 m 1 d m 1 m 1 dm 1 dm 1 contains the space generated bydm 1 and the lie brackets x im x 0 m for i 1 k we will show by induction that in fact they are generating dm 1 dm 1 modulo dm 1 for all m n 0 we have x 0 m amx 0 m 1 zm it results from the definition of ai zi and x 0 m that x i m x 0 m 1 0 so we have x im x 0 m x i m am x 0 m 1 x i m zm for j 1 k 1 consider the vector fields y j m 1 j m 1 x 0 m 1 k r 1 1 m 1 r m 1 j m 1 rm 1 xrm 1 if we set m 1 m 1 m 1 m 1 then we have the relation ym 1 d m 1 1 xm 1 where the vectors column ym 1 and xm 1 have y 1 m 1 y k 1 m 1 and x 0 m 1 x k m 1 as components respectively it results that y 1 m 1 y k 1 m 1 is a basis of m 1 for m 0 n we note d m the jacobian matrix of m m m m the following decompositions occur x 0 m k 1 j 1 jmy j m 1 x im x 0 m k 1 j 1 jm im y j m 1 for all m 1 n by similar way for d m we can show that the family of vector fields x 0 m x 1 m x 0 m x k m x 0 m is also a basis of m 1 this result is also true for m 0 since dm 1 em 2 m the space d m 1 dm 1 contains em 2 all vectors x 0 m x 1 m x k m and the lie brackets x 1 m x 0 m x k m x 0 m also all the lie brackets x j r x 0 m articulated arm and special multi flags corrected version 15 are zero for r m 1 n and j 1 k since x 0 m does not depend on variables j r for r m 1 n and j 1 k the other lie brackets xjr x i m are zero for r m 1 n and i j 1 k since x 0 m x 1 m x 0 m x k m x 0 m is a basis of m 1 then we have dm 1 dm 1 em 1 m 1 d m which completes the proof of proposition 6 1 and theorem 3 1 comment 6 1 given two integers p and m such that 1 p m n we can look for the motion of a sub induced arm which consists of segments of the original arm between mp 1 and mm 1 included we can then study the motion of mp 1 as the motion of the extremity of this sub arm for the motion commanded by the segment mm mm 1 we put h m p 1 and we write p m for the canonical projection from rk 1 sk n 1 onto rk 1 sk h 1 defined as p m x z 1 zn 1 xp 1 zp 1 zp zm where xp 1 are the cartesian coordinates of mp 1 the evolution of the extremity mp 1 of this articulated sub arm controlled by the movement of mm mm 1 is a solution of the following differential system with notations of theorem 4
