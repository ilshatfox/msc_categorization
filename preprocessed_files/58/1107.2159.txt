let x denote a smooth projective curve over a finite field k fq is x determined up to isomorphism from counting its points over finite extensions of k i e by the numbers nn x fqn i e by knowing its zeta function x s exp n 1 nn q sn n the answer is no in general tate 1966 and turner 1978 proved that for two curves x y over k the equality x y is equivalent to their respective jacobians jac x jac y be ing k isogenous the following example of e howe from 1996 illustrates this phenomenon let x y 2 x 5 x 3 x 2 x 1 over f 3 then x 1 t t 2 3 t 3 9 t 4 1 t 1 3 t with t q s and here are the first few point counts for this occasion done independently in sage n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 nn 3 11 21 107 288 719 2271 can we remedy this number fields now consider the same problem for a number field k with its dedekind zeta function k s 06 a 1 n a s where the sum runs over all non zero ideals a of the ring of integers of k knowing k is the same as knowing f p p for all prime ideals p a theorem of mih ly bauer 1903 says that if k l are two number fields that are galois over q then k l is equivalent to k l however a result of ga mann from 1926 says that in general there do exist non isomorphic number fields k l with k l actually he proves that k l is equivalent to the following statement fix a common extension n of k and l that is galois over q with galois group g and let hk and hl denote the galois groups of n k and n l respectively then k l if and only if each g conjugacy class intersects hk and hl in the same number of elements a result from perlis from 1977 says that the first example with k l but k 6 l occurs in degree 7 over q and an example is given by k q l q with 7 7 3 0 and 7 14 4 42 2 21 9 0 1 http arxiv org abs 1107 2159 v 1 can we remedy this historical aside internal external failure success here are some further attempts at finding objects that determine isomorphism of number fields k and l an isomorphism of adele rings ak al is stronger than equality of zeta functions strictly stronger for number fields equivalent for function fields but still does not imply field isomorphism komatsu 1976 an example is k q 8 18 and l q 8 288 an isomorphism of abelian galois groups gabk gabl is not enough either kubota determined the isomorphism type of gabk its ulm invariants in terms of k and onabe 1976 gave explicit examples such as gab q 2 gab q 3 at the other side of the spectrum an isomorphism of absolute galois groups gk gl does imply that k l this is due to neukirch 1969 when k l are galois over q and uchida 1976 in general this last theorem is the first manifestation of what grothendieck called anabelian theorems we conclude that the objects listed above that are internal to a number field k i e can be described in terms of ideals of k such as k ak or g ab k which is internal by class field theory lead to failure whereas a mysterious object gk that is external to k described in terms of extensions of k or via the langlands program in terms of automorphic forms leads to success can we do better and have internal success method class field theory as noncommutative dynamical system let jk denote the group of fractional ideals of k j k the semigroup of integral ideals of k k a k gabk the artin reciprocity map and o k the integral finite adeles of k choose a section s of the natural map a k f jk xp p 7 p vp xp these objects were used by ha and paugam in 2005 to construct a dynamical system associated to k for k q this is the famous bost connes system as follows we make a topological space xk g ab k o k o k consisting of classes for gabk and o k defined by the equivalence k u 1 u for all u o k then we consider the action of n j k on xk given by n k s n 1 s n in this way we get a dynamical system xk j k main theorem c matilde marcolli arxiv 1009 0736 for two number fields k and l an iso morphismk l is equivalent to a norm preserving isomorphism of dynamical systems xk j k xl j l by isomorphism of dynamical systems we mean a homeomorphism xk xl and a group homomorphism j k j l such that n x n x for all x xk and n j k and norm preserving means that nl n nk n for all n j k 2 http arxiv org abs 1009 0736 in a sense this theorem shows that a suitable combination of failure k which will be the partition function of the system gabk and ak which occur in the system may lead to success it gives an internal description of the isomorphism type of a number field it also holds in a function field with a slightly different easier proof the proof is really to hit the dynamical system with a hammer until enough isomorphic objects jump out reformulation using quantum statistical mechanics there is a way to reformulate the main theorem by encoding the dynamics in banach algebra language we set ak c xk j k to be the semigroup crossed product c algebra corresponding to the dynamical system physically it corresponds to the algebra of observables if we let n and n denote the partial isometries of the algebra corresponding to n j k then we also need the non involutive subalgebra a k of ak generated by c x and n n j k but not the n we also consider a one parameter subgroup of automorphisms of ak denoted k r aut ak defined by k t f f and k t n nk n it n the algebra with this so called time evolution is an abstract quantum statistical mechanical system a slightly stronger statement than the main theorem is the following k l is equivalent to an isomorphism of ak k al l that maps a k to a l from the main theorem we can deduce our answer to the problems outlined before theorem if k and l are global fields number fields or function fields of curves over finite fields then k l which in the case of function fields of curves is equivalent to isomorphism of the curves is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism gabk gabl such that all abelian l series match lk ll 1 for all hom gabk s 1 we discovered this theorem because l series occur as evaluations of low temperature equilibrium states of the system at particular test functions related to the character our proof of this theorem is to deduce from l series equality an isomorphism of dynamical systems which basically boils down to a bit of character theory and then using the main theorem in the meanwhile bart de smit has discovered a purely number theoretical proof of the theorem for l series for number fields and has actually proven something much stronger for every number field k there is a character of order 3 such that lk 6 lk for every number field k 6 k and character for gabk this proof does not seem to transfer readily to function fields final remark the theorem is not really an analytic statement it suffices to have equality of l series at sufficiently large integers hence the theorem also holds with p adic l functions one may read it as an equivalence of rank one motives over k and l an analog in riemannian geometry the isospectrality problem has a long history that can be traced back at least to the wolfskehl lecture of the dutch physicist lorentz in g ttingen in 1910 where he asked whether the spectrum of the laplacian on a domain with suitable boundary conditions determines the volume he refers to the leiden phd thesis of johanna reudler that very cleverly computes several convincing examples published in 1912 hermann weyl proved 3 the general case in 1911 and much later mark kac popularized the question whether the entire shape of the region so up to euclidean transformations is determined by the spectrum as can you hear the shape of a drum this formulation is due to bers the problem was originally posed by bochner the first counterexample was the construction of two non isometric riemannian manifolds with the same spectrum by milnor based on witt s theory of quadratic forms then even came non homeomorphic isospectral manifolds in the work of ikeda lens spaces and vign ras 3 manifolds let x g denote a closed riemannian manifold with laplace operator x the question whether or not the spectrum with multiplicities determines the isometry type of x is the same as that whether or not the spectral zeta function x s 6 0 1 s tr s x sum over the non zero eigenvalues of the laplace operator with multiplicities does so can we do better this time our remedy is the following for a c x set x a s tr a sx and for a w x lipschitz functions set x a tr a x a sx then theorem c jan willem de jong arxiv 1007 0907 let x and y denote two closed riemannian manifolds and x y a c 1 bijective map then being an isometry is equivalent to the following two properties holding simultaneously a y a 0 x a 0 for all a 0 c y and b y a 1 x a 1 for all a 1 w y the proof is a rather formal computation with residues various analytically more challenging amplifications are possible for example condition a alone suffices when the spectrum is simple which is the generic case by a result of uhlenbeck in the above theorem one can also restrict to a countable dense subset of functions and to sufficiently large integral values of the zeta functions so the characterisation is really by countably many values lengths of maps one may now define the length of a map x y as the distance between the meromorphic zeta functions that occur in the theorem the usual distance of meromorphic functions doesn t quite work but the following does the length of of riemannian mani folds of dimension n is sup a 0 c y r 0 0 a 1 w 1 y r sup n s n 1 max log x a 0 s y a 0 s log x a 1 s y a 1 s this then satisfies 0 if and only if is an isometry and one can also show that d x y max inf c 1 x y 4 http arxiv org abs 1007 0907 defines an extended metric between isometry classes of riemannian manifolds as an example especially for don zagier we bound the distance d between two tori corresponding to i and 1 3 2

and d is the bloch wigner dilogarithm function pluralizing zeta zeta counts things points ideals geodesics spectra it is beautiful but sometimes lonely it can fail as an individual but it will be happy and succeed as part of a family of zetas 5
