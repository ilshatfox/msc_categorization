restricition theorem and the uni form sobolev estimates of kenig ruiz and the second author 13 by allowing criti cally singular potential we also obtain strichartz estimates for schro dinger and wave operators with such potentials due to the fact that there may be nontrivial eigen functions we are required to make certain spectral assumptions such as assuming that the solutions only involve sufficiently large frequencies 1 introduction and main results the main purpose of this paper is to extend the uniform sobolev inequalities in rn of kenig ruiz and the second author 13 as well as the l 2 restricition theorem of stein and tomas 22 to include schro dinger operators 1 1 hv v x with critically singular potentials v which are assumed to be real valued and 1 2 v ln 2 rn in a recent work of the authors with blair and sire 1 the same problem was considered for compact riemannian manifolds which generalizes results in 6 4 and 17 also in an earlier work of blair sire and the second author 2 quasimode and related spectral projection estimates were discussed in rn under the additional assumption that v k the kato class the spaces ln 2 and k have the same scaling properties and both obey the scaling law of the laplacian which accounts for their criticality it is natural to assume that v k when dealing with large exponents and as was shown in 2 this assumption is needed to obtain optimal sup norm estimates for quasimodes however motivated by the results in 1 for the smaller exponents arising in uniform sobolev inequalities it is natural to merely assume that v in ln 2 which we shall discuss below in theorem 1 1 as was shown in the appendix of 1 if v ln 2 then hv is essentially self adjoint and bounded from below as a result we shall assume throughout that 1 3 spec

estimates and quasimode estimates that we can obtain are the following theorem 1 1 let n 3 and suppose that 1 4 min q p q 2 n n 1 and 1 p q 1 q 2 n then if v ln 2 rn is real valued and 0 are fixed constants with q n v sufficiently large we have the uniform bounds 1 5 hv 1 u q u p q if where 1 6 c n 0 dist n 0 if re 2 also suppose that 1 7 2 n 1 n 1 q 2 n n 4 if n 5 or 2 n 1 n 1 q if n 3 4 then if u dom hv for any 0 2 we have 1 8 u q n 1 2 1 q 3 2 1 2 hv 2 i u 2 if here dom hv denotes the domain of hv and n 0 is as in 1 3 also r denotes the conjugate exponent for r i e the one satisfying 1 r 1 r 1 additionally we are using the notation that a b means that a is bounded from above by a constant times b the implicit constant might depend on the parameters involved such as n q and v but not on or in 1 5 and 1 8 the condition 1 4 on the range of exponents was shown to be be sharp in 13 the gap condition in 1 4 that 1 p q 1 q 2 n follows from scaling considerations while the necessity of the first part of 1 4 is related to the fact that the fourier transform of surface measure on the sphere in rn is not in lq rn if q 2 n n 1 the condition 1 7 on the exponents is also sharp since it agrees with conditions in the standard quasimode estimates when v 0 except for the case n 3 q in that case 1 8 may not be valid if we only assume v ln 2 rn due to the possible existence of unbounded eigenfunctions for the operator hv see e g 2 for more details 1 5 1 6 imply that we have uniform lp q lq operator bounds for hv 1 if re is large and im 6 0 which is a natural analog of the uniform sobolev estimates of kenig ruiz and the second author 13 and in the special case where v 0 is equivalent to the results in 13 inequalities of this type as well as weighted l 2 estimates for hv 1 have been extensively studied for different types of potentials see e g 10 16 3 15 in particular in 15 it is proved by mizutani that 1 5 1 6 hold for v ln 0 rn where l n 0 denotes the completion of c 0 functions under the l n 0 norm although ln 2 ln 0 the proof of 1 6 is based on a different method and we shall discuss at the end of section 2 that how we can modify the proof there to further weaken the conditions on v by results in 20 the bounds in 1 8 are equivalent to the following spectral projection bounds 1 9 v l 2 rn lq rn 1 2 n 1 2 1 q 1 2 0 1 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 3 for some large enough and q as in 1 7 if v denotes the spectral projection oper ator which projects onto the part of the spectrum of hv in the corresponding shrinking intervals 2 2 if in addition to 1 2 we assume that v is in the kato class then we also have 1 9 as in the v 0 case for all p 2 n 1 n 1 which is equivalent to the stein thomas restriction theorem for the sphere see i e chapter 5 in 19 in 2 analogs of 1 9 were obtained for all 0 under the assumption that the ln 2 norm of v is small in that case using a simple argument involving sobolev estimates it is not hard to show that hv v itself defines a positive self adjoint operator which can not have negative spectrum we generalize the results in 2 by removing the smallness condition at the cost of ignoring lower part of the spectrum by letting 0 inequalities like 1 9 certainly implies the absence of embedded eigenvalues in the corresponding region of spectrum as far as the problem of absence of eigenvalues is considered the ln 2 norm here is critical since in 14 koch and tataru showed that if q n 2 there are examples of compactly supported potentials v lq and smooth compact supported functions u such that hv u 0 in the opposite direction ionescu and jerison 9 proved that hv does not admit positive eigenvalues for v ln 2 loc with certain decay conditions as x since hv does not admit large eigenvalues if e denotes the density of the spectral measure associated to the operator hv with e d being the resolution of identity by stone s formula e 1 2 i lim 0 hv i 1 hv i 1 if 2 which is equivalent to e 1 lim 0 hv i 1 hv i 1 thus for defined as above by applying 1 8 with 1 2 1 2 and duality we have the following restriction type estimates corollary 1 2 suppose that q satisfies 1 7 then we have 1 10 e f lq rn c n 2 1 q 1 q 1 f lq rn if 2 among other things if v denotes the spectral projection onto the interval 2 for hv for q satisfying 1 7 the quasimode estimates 1 8 also implies 1 11 v l 2 rn lq rn 1 since hv is bounded from below using 1 9 and 1 11 it is straightforward to adapt the proof of theorem 8 1 and theorem 9 5 in 2 to obtain the following theorem 1 3 let n 3 and fix v ln 2 rn let u be the solution of 1 12 2 t v x u 0 u t 0 f 0 tu t 0 f 1 then for pc 2 n 1 n 1 we have 1 13 u lpc 0 1 rn cv i hv 1 4 f 0 l 2 rn i hv 1 4 f 1 l 2 rn 4 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials additionally suppose that c r is a smooth function satisfying 1 14 1 for 1 and 0 for 1 2 then 1 15 hv m u lpc r rn cv i hv 1 4 f 0 l 2 rn i hv 1 4 f 1 l 2 rn assuming that m is a large enough constant which depends on v here the operator hv m denotes a smooth spectral projection onto the interval m 2 for hv more specifically 1 16 hv m f m e fd similarly as 1 8 1 15 suggest by projecting onto the subspace with large spectrum we have the following global strichartz estimate for schro dinger equations theorem 1 4 let the potential v ln 2 rn be real valued and c r be as in 1 14 then for each pair of exponents p q satisfying 1 17 n 1 2 1 q 2 p 2 p and n 3 we have 1 18 hv m e ithv f l p tl q x r rn f l 2 rn where m is a large constant which depends on v additionally if v ln 2 rn l rn is real valued then for p q satisfying 1 17 we have 1 19 e ithv f l p tl q x 0 1 rn f l 2 rn if v 0 it is well known that the strichartz estimates 1 18 are a consequence of the following dispersive estimate 1 20 eit f l rn t n 2 f l 1 rn with the endpoint of above estimates corresponding to p 2 q 2 n n 2 n 3 obtained by keel and tao in 12 however the natural l 1 l dispersive estimates for the operator e ithv as well as the strichartz estimates 1 18 may break down due to the possible existence of bounded states if v ln 2 rn it was proved by goldberg in 7 that global strichartz estimates 1 18 hold with f projected onto the continuous part of the spectrum under the assumption that 0 is neither a eigenvalue or resonance under the same condition mizutani 15 also proved similar inhomogeneous strichartz estimates when the pairs p q are outside the admissible range in 1 17 the inequalities in 1 18 show that even if 0 is a eigenvalue or resonance the same estimates still hold as long as f is projected onto the higher part of the spectrum see also 11 for related high energy estimates for a different class of potentials v we are grateful to mizutani 15 for pointing out his recent work after a preliminary version of this paper was completed uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 5 2 uniform sobolev inequalities and quasimode estimates in rn in this section we shall prove theorem 1 1 as in 1 the main idea is to use the second resolvent formula 2 1 v 1 1 1 v v 1 im 6 0 along with quasimode estimates and uniform sobolev estimates for the unperturbed op erator h 0 from 13 and 2 specifically we shall require that for n 3 2 2 1 f lq rn c f lp rn c 0 for pairs of exponents p q satisfying 1 4 which is due to kenig ruiz and the second author 13 we also need the quasimode estimates 2 3 u lpc rn c 1 1 pc 1 2 2 i f l 2 rn 0 2 where pc 2 n 1 n 1 by a change of scale argument it is not hard to check that 2 3 is an equivalent version of stein thomas restriction theorem for rn see e g 2 proposition 9 3 actually similar estimates also hold in the case 2 but we skip these here since they are less useful to prove theorem 1 1 a key ingredient is the following theorem theorem 2 1 let n 3 and 2 n n 1 q 2 n n 3 then if v ln 2 rn is fixed we have 2 4 2 i 1 v f q 1 2 f q 0 assuming that q n v 1 sufficiently large 2 4 essentially follows from lemma 3 3 in 15 where the author gave a short proof of this lemma using uniform sobolev estimates for the free resolvent operator when 2 n 2 1 p 1 q 2 n the proof of 2 4 that we shall give is more complicated since it requires a decomposition of the free resolvent operator into dyadically localized operators however we obtain results that are less restrictive on the conditions required for v see the discussion at the end of this section for more details we shall postpone the proof of theorem 2 1 to the end of this section and first see how we can apply the above theorem to obtain 1 5 and 1 8 even though the proof mostly follows from the arguments in 1 we include it here for the sake of completeness to prove 1 5 if re 2 it is equivalent to showing that hv 2 i 1 lp lq 1 if with sufficiently large and p q as in 1 4 by duality it suffices prove this inequality when 2 5 2 n n 1 q 2 n n 2 thus our task is to show that 2 6 hv 2 i 1 f lq rn c f lp rn if with p q satisfying 1 4 and 2 5 we are also assuming that 2 2 and 2 3 are valid for this pair of exponents 6 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials we are assuming 2 5 since by sobolev estimates see e g 6 5 in the appendix of 1 we have u lq rn 2 q 2 n n 2 if hv 2 i u l 2 thus for q as in 2 5 2 7 hv 2 i 1 f lq rn if f l 2 rn in proving 2 6 since l 2 is dense in lp we may and shall assume that f l 2 rn to be able to use 2 7 to justify a bootstrapping argument that follows by using the second resolvent formula 2 1 write hv 2 i 1 f 2 8 2 i 1 f 2 i 1 v hv 2 i 1 f i ii if we apply the uniform sobolev estimates 2 2 for the unperturbed operator we have 2 9 i q c f p while by using 2 4 in theorem 2 1 2 10 ii q 1 2 hv 2 i 1 f lq if thus if we combine 2 8 2 9 and 2 10 we conclude that for we have hv 2 i 1 f lq rn c f lp rn 1 2 hv 2 i 1 f lq rn by 2 7 this leads to 2 6 since we are assuming as we may that f l 2 rn now we shall give the proof of quasimode estimates 1 8 which are needed later in the proof of 1 5 for re 2 first note that by the quasimode estimates 2 3 for the unperturbed operator 2 11 i pc c 1 1 pc 1 2 f 2 if 0 2 if we combine 2 8 2 10 and 2 11 we conclude that for we have hv 2 i 1 f lpc rn c 1 1 pc 1 2 f l 2 rn 1 2 hv 2 i 1 f lpc rn by 2 7 this leads to 1 8 for q pc 2 n 1 n 1 since in this case 1 1 pc n 1 2 1 pc 3 2 the remaining estimates in 1 8 for exponents q 2 n 1 n 1 as in 1 7 now just are a consequence of the following theorem theorem 2 2 let n 5 assume that 1 8 holds for some 2 n 1 n 1 r 2 n n 4 and r v with 0 2 then if v ln 2 rn we have for u dom hv 2 12 u q c n 1 2 1 q 3 2 1 2 v 2 i u 2 if r q 2 n n 4 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 7 similarly for n 3 or n 4 assume that 1 8 holds for some 2 n 1 n 1 r with 0 2 then we have 2 13 u q c n 1 2 1 q 3 2 1 2 v 2 i u 2 if r q assuming that q n v in 2 12 and 2 13 are sufficiently large theorem 2 2 is essentially the analog of theorem 2 3 in 1 which says we can use the quasimode estimates for smaller exponents r to obtain quasimode estimates for larger exponents q up to the optimal range here compared with theorem 2 3 in 1 we do not have to assume that has a lower bound which depends on by requiring that q n v as in the case of uniform sobolev inequalities 1 5 as in 1 the proof of theorem 2 2 requires the following lemma lemma 2 3 let v ln 2 rn be real valued then there exists a constant n 0 1 large enough such that for u dom hv we have 2 14 u q g v n 0 u 2 for 2 q if n 3 4 or 2 q 2 n n 4 if n 5 lemma 2 3 is essentially a special case of lemma 2 4 in 1 where the authors proved a sharp sobolev type estimates for the operator hv on compact manifolds however their proof works equally well in the case of rn thus for the sake of brevity we shall skip the proof of 2 14 here and refer the reader to the proof of lemma 2 4 in 1 for details the main idea is that although the uniform resolvent estimates for the operator 1 hold for a rather restricted range of exponents p q it is possible to enlarge the range of p q at the expense of requiring to lie in certain regions of the complex plane proof of theorem 2 2 throughout the proof we shall assume that 2 15 2 n 1 n 1 r q 2 n n 4 if n 5 or 2 n 1 n 1 r q if n 3 4 note that proving 2 12 and 2 13 is equivalent to showing that for q satisfying 2 15 2 16 hv 2 i 1 f q c n 1 2 1 q 3 2 1 2 f 2 if the proof of 2 12 and 2 13 also relies on the simple fact that if we let 2 17 v n x v x if v x n 0 otherwise then of course 2 18 v n l n and if v n x v x v n x 2 19 v n ln 2 rn n with n 0 as n since we are assuming that v ln 2 rn 8 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials fix a smooth bump function c 0 1 4 4 with 1 in 1 2 2 and let p write 2 20 hv 2 i 1 f p hv 2 i 1 f 1 p hv 2 i 1 f a b to deal with the first term note that since m is a mikhlin multiplier i e k km ck k 0 6 0 therefore by the mikhlin multiplier theorem see e g 19 theorem 0 2 6 we have 2 21 2 p lr lr if 1 r so by sobolev estimates 2 21 and 1 8 for the exponent r if n 1 r 1 q and 0 2 we have 2 22 a q g 2 p hv 2 i 1 f r n 1 r 1 q hv 2 i 1 f r c n 1 2 1 q 3 2 1 2 f 2 if 1 r to bound the second term we shall use the second resolvent formula 2 1 to write 1 p hv 2 i 1 f 1 p 2 i 1 f 1 p 2 i 1 v n hv 2 i 1 f 1 p 2 i 1 v n hv 2 i 1 f i ii iii since the function 1 vanishes in a dyadic neighborhood of it is easy to see that 1 2 2 i 1 2 1 is a mikhlin multiplier and so 2 23 1 p 2 i 1 f q 1 1 f q if 1 q so by 2 23 sobolev estimates and ho lder s inequality we have for q satisfying 2 15 2 24 ii q g 1 1 v n hv 2 i 1 f q v n hv 2 i 1 f p q c n hv 2 i 1 f q where 1 p q 1 q 2 n by 2 19 we can fix n large enough so that c n 1 4 yielding the bounds 2 25 ii q 1 4 hv 2 i 1 f q uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 9 for the third term iii note that as before by the support property of it is straight forward to check that 1 2 2 i 1 2 is a mikhlin multiplier and so 2 26 1 p 2 i 1 f q c 2 f q if 1 q thus by 2 18 we have 2 27 iii q c 2 v n hv 2 i 1 f q cn 2 hv 2 i 1 f q if we choose 2 such that 2 2 4 cn we have 2 28 iii q 1 4 hv 2 i 1 f q if 2 we are left with estimating the first term i note that for q satisfying 2 15 we have 1 2 1 q 2 n by sobolev estimates if n 1 2 1 q 2 29 1 p g 2 i 1 f q g 2 1 p g 2 i 1 f 2 since the symbol of the operator on the right side of 2 29 satisfies 2 30 1 2 2 i 1 2 by the spectral theorem this yields the bounds 2 31 i q n 1 2 1 q 2 f 2 which are better than those in 2 16 since we are assuming that 2 if we combine 2 22 2 25 2 28 and 2 31 we conclude that for with max 1 2 we have 2 32 hv 2 i 1 f lq rn c n 1 2 1 q 3 2 1 2 f l 2 rn 1 2 hv 2 i 1 f lq rn note that as a consequence of lemma 2 3 for q satisfying 2 15 we have 2 33 hv 2 i 1 f lq rn if f l 2 rn thus 2 32 and 2 16 are equivalent and so the proof of theorem 2 2 is complete now we shall prove 1 5 for the region re 2 by using the results we have just proved note that by spectral theorem as well as 1 3 we have 2 34 hv 1 f l 2 rn c hv 2 i 2 4 1 f l 2 rn if re 2 and dist n 0 on the other hand by a simple interpolation argument along with the trivial l 2 estimates 1 8 implies 2 35 hv 2 i 2 4 1 f lq rn c f l 2 rn if 2 nn 1 q 2 n n 3 10 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials by duality this yields 2 36 hv 1 f l 2 rn c f lp rn if 2 n n 3 p 2 n n

to exploit this we use the second resolvent formula 2 1 to write hv 1 f 1 f 2 38 1 v n hv 1 f 1 v n hv 1 f i ii iii by the uniform sobolev estimates 2 2 for the unperturbed operator we have 2 39 i q c f p as well as 2 22 ii q c v n hv 1 f p c v n ln 2 hv 1 f lq using ho lder s inequality and the fact that 1 p 1 q 2 n in the last step by 2 19 we can fix n large enough so that c v n ln 2 1 2 yielding the bounds 2 40 ii q 1 2 hv 1 f q to bound the third term iii note that by simple sobolev estimates for q satisfying 2 5 and satisfying conditions in 2 34 we have 2 41 1 f lq rn c f l 2 rn if we combine 2 41 and 2 36 we conclude that 2 42 iii q c n f p thus 2 39 2 40 and 2 42 imply that 2 43 hv 1 f lq rn c f lp rn 1 2 hv 1 f lq rn if re 2 and dist n 0 by 2 7 this implies 1 5 when re 2 to conclude this section we shall give the proof of theorem 2 1 proof of theorem 2 1 write v v n v n we shall focus on the term v n since as in 2 22 we can always fix n large enough so that 2 44 2 i 1 v

uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials note that as a consequence of 2 50 and young s inequality 2 51 kj 1 v nf q c 22 j n 1 2 v nf q c 22 j n 1 2 n f q if 2 j 2 j 0 2 n 1 thus by choosing 2 such that 2 c 1 2 n 1 12 we have 2 52 j 0 j 0 kj 1 v nf q 1 12 f q if 2 on the other hand for each fixed j 0 the operatork j 1 satisfies the following bounds proposition 2 4 let n 3 and

theorem 2 1 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 13 remark the above proof of theorem 2 1 does not make full use of the condition that v ln 2 rn and it can be easily adapted to prove bounds for certain potentials in l n 2 loc for example in 2 48 and 2 51 instead of using l q lq type estimates we can use their lp lq analogs with 1 p 1 q 2 n and exploit the locally supported condition for the operators k 0 and k j 1 to remove the l condition on v used there specifically if we assume that 2 59 lim r 0 sup x v ln 2 bx r 0 as well as 2 60 sup x v ln 2 bx r c r 0 r 1 then one could decompose the resolvent operator 2 i 1 as a sum of dyadically localized operators and repeat the above arguments to get the same conclusion also the condition 2 59 itself ensures that the operatorhv defines a self adjoint operator which is bounded from below thus it is possible to get the same results in theorem 1 1 assuming that v satisfies 2 59 and 2 60 recall that in ionescu and jerison 9 a special case of the conditions the authors used to guarantee the absence of positive eigenvalues was that v ln 2 loc rn and lim r v ln 2 r x 2 r 0 which implies 2 59 and 2 60 with r replaced by logr on the other hand by an interpolation theorem of stein and weiss i e chapter v theorem 3 15 in 21 it is straightforward to show that e g 2 56 still holds with v ln 2 replaced by v ln

singular potentials in r n in this section we shall prove theorem 1 4 we shall first give the proof of 1 19 which is an easy consequence of duhamel s principle and a bootstrap argument if v ln 2 rn l rn by adapting the arguments in the appendix of 1 one can show that hv v defines a self adjoint operator which is bounded from below if necessary we may add a constant to v so that hv 0 this will not affect our estimates since if we say add the constant n to v the two different schro dinger operators will agree up to a factor e itn by spectral theorem we have e ithv l 2 rn l 2 rn o 1 t r thus it

note that by the keel tao 12 theorem we have 3 3 eit f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn c f l 2 rn as well as 3 4 t 0 ei t s f s ds l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn c f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn thus the first term i is bounded by the right side of 3 1 and if we choose n large enough such that c n 1 2 for the constant c appeared in 3 4 we have 3 5 iii l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn c v ne ithv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x rn c v n ln

implies e ithv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn thus a combination of 3 3 3 5 3 6 and a bootstrap argument gives us 3 7 e ithv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn cv f l 2 rn if f h 1 rn since h 1 is dense in l 2 the proof of 3 1 is complete uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 15 the proof of 1 18 requires more work since we can not bound the term ii as before if the support of s is unbouned to proceed we shall follow the strategy in a recent work 8 by the authors and prove an analogous dyadic estimates which will allow us to obtain 1 18 also we have to show that the littlewood paley estimates for hv are valid for the exponents q as in 1 17 this was done in the appendix of 8 in the setting of compact manifolds and the same argument can be used to handle the euclidean space r n as in 8 the proof of dyadic variants of 1 17 rely on certain microlocalized quasi mode estimates for the unperturbed scaled schro ding operators with a damping term 3 8 i t i unlike the case of compact manifold we need to allow the damping term to be arbitrary small and prove results that are uniform in in order to get global strichartz estimates furthermore since the littlewood paley operators associated with may not be compatible with the corresponding ones for hv v x with v singular we shall also introduce the littlewood paley operators acting on the time variable dt h x 2 1 eit h d with defined as in 2 46 more specifically to prove 1 18 our main estimates will concern solutions of the scaled inhomogeneous schro dinger equation with damping term 3 9 i t g i w t x f t x w 0 0 it will be convenient to assume that the forcing term here satisfies 3 10 f t x 0 t 0 1 the result that we shall need in order to prove 1 18 is the following theorem 3 1 let n 3 suppose f satisfies the support assumption in 3 10 and w solves 3 9 then for 1 we have 3 11 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 2 1 2 f l 2 t x 0 1 rn and also 3 12 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn additionally if for all time t supp f t br with br being a fixed ball of radius r 1 in rn centered at origin we have 3 13 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r br cr 1 2 f l 2 tl 2 x 0 1 rn inequalities 3 11 and 3 12 are analogs of those in theorem 1 2 in 8 which as we shall see later can be proved by using a similar argument inequality 3 13 is the main new ingredient which will allow us to deal with forcing terms involving bounded and compactly supported potentials also compared with theorem 1 2 in 8 we only consider the special case p 2 q 2 n n 2 here for the sake of simplicity since we are assuming that n 3 where the endpoints are always admissible in other words this 16 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials endpoint strichartz estimate implies all the others by interpolating with the trivial l 2 estimate before giving the proof of theorem 3 1 which we shall postpone until the end of the section let us see how we can use the above inequalities to prove 1 18 recall that under the assumption 1 2 hv defines a self adjoint operator and as noted before we may assume that 3 14 hv 0 to proceed we shall require the following multiplier bounds associated to the operator hv proposition 3 2 let v ln 2 rn be real valued and suppose that 3 15 1 q for n 3 4 or 2 n n 4 q 2 n n 4 n 5 then if m c r is a mikhlin type multiplier i e 3 16 j m c 1 j 0 0 j n 2 1 we have 3 17 m hv f lq rn cq f lq rn as well as 3 18 h lq rn cq v 0 hv h lq rn k 1 hv 2 k h 2 1 2 lq rn for q v as above and being the littlewood paley bump function satisfying 2 46 the proof of 3 17 was given in the appendix of 8 in the compact manifold case we can repeat the arguments and see that to obtain 3 17 in the euclidean setting it suffices to check the following two properties hold for the operator hv in r n i finite propagation speed for the wave equation associated to hv that is if u v l 2 rn and dist supp u supp v r then 3 19 u cos t hv v 0 t r by a result of coulhon and sikora 5 3 19 is valid when hv is nonnegative self adjoint and v l 1 loc rn alternately one can use arguments from 2 to show this for the potentials that we are considering ii for q satisfying 1 7 and defined as in 2 46 we have the bernstein type dyadic sobolev estimates 3 20 hv u lq rn c n 1 2 1 q u l 2 rn 1 and 0 hv u lq rn c u l 2 rn if 0 s 1 k 1 2 ks this in turn is a direct consequence of 1 8 and the spectral theorem if we let u hv u and there the fact that the conditions i and ii implies 3 17 now follows from the same procedure as in the appendix of 8 also given 3 17 the littlewood paley estimate uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 17 3 18 can be proved using a standard argument involving radamacher functions see e g 19 p 21 in view of the littlewood paley inequalities 3 18 by using a standard argument involving minkowski s inequality see e g 3 33 in 8 the strichartz estimate in 1 18 is equivalent to the following 3 21 e ithv hv f l p tl q x r rn hv f l 2 rn if c 0 9 10 11 10 is fixed and assuming that v sufficiently large we choose this interval 9 10 11 10 as the support of since we are assuming that the littlewood paley bump function arising in theorem 3 1 satisfies 3 22 s 1 on 3 4 5 4 and supp 1 2 2 since by the spectral theorem 3 23 e ithv l 2 rn l 2 rn 1 the estimate trivially holds for p and q 2 therefore by interpolation since we are assuming that n 3 it suffices to prove the estimate for the other endpoint i e 3 24 e ithv hv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c hv f l 2 rn if to be able to use 3 11 and 3 12 we note that after rescaling 3 24 is equivalent to the statement that 3 25 e it 1 hv hv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 1 1 rn c 1 2 hv f l 2 rn 0 1 if where c c n v is a uniform constant independent of by 3 23 this is equivalent to showing that whenever c 0 1 0 1 are fixed we have 3 26 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c 1 2 hv f l 2 m if with w t x t e it 1 hv hv f to proceed we need the following simple lemma lemma 3 3 let n 3 and let w be as in 3 26 with c 0 0 1 and c 0 as in 3 21 then for large enough and each n 1 2 we have the uniform bounds 3 27 i dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn cn n hv f l 2 rn this is essentially the euclidean version of lemma 3 1 in 8 and so we can repeat the arguments there to prove 3 27 with minor modifications for completeness we include the details below 18 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials proof first note the fourier transform of t t e it 1 2 is 1 2 conse quently 3 28 i dt w t x a t hv hv f x where 3 29 a t 2 1 eit 1 2 1 d since for q 0 2 n n 2 by 6 7 in 1 the following sobolev estimates are valid 3 30 u lq 0 rn i hv 1 2 u l 2 rn therefore by the spectral theorem 3 31 a t hv hv f lq 0 rn a t hv hv f l 2 rn next since 2 q 0 by minkowski s inequality and sobolev s theorem for r we therefore have i dt w l 2 tlq 0 x r m a t hv hv f l q 0 t l 2 x r r n a t hv hv f l 2 xl q 0 t r r n dt 1 2 1 q 0 a t hv hv f l 2 xl 2 t r r n by the spectral theorem we conclude that 3 32 i dt w l 2 tlq 0 x r rn sup 9 10 11 10 dt 1 2 1 pa t l 2 t r hv f l 2 rn next by plancherel s theorem 3 22 and 3 29 dt 1 2 1 pa t 2 l 2 t r 2 1 1 2 p 1 2 2 1 2 d 5 4 3 4 1 2 p 1 2 2 d note that 2 if if 5 4 3 4 and 9 10 11 10 and since s r the preceding inequality leads to the trivial bounds 3 33 sup dt 1 2 1 pa t l 2 t r n combining this inequality with 3 32 yields 3 27 we now are able to prove 3 26 for fixed v ln 2 rn let us split v v 1 v 2 where 3 34 v 1 x v x if v x and x r 0 otherwise uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 19 the assumption v ln 2 rn then yields 3 35 v 2 ln 2 rn r with r 0 as r and we also trivially have 3 36 v 1 l rn to use this we note that since hv g v i t g i w i t hv i w v w i t hv i w v 1 w v 2 w and also w 0 0 so we can split 3 37 w w w 1 w 2 where 3 38 i t g i w i t hv i w f w 0 0 3 39 i t g i w 1 v 1 w f 1 w 1 0 0 and 3 40 i t g i w 2 v 2 w f 2 w 2 0 0 note that since w t x 0 t 0 1 each of the forcing terms f f 1 and f 2 also vanishes for such t which allows us to apply the estimates in theorem 3 1 for w w 1 and w 2 by 3 27 and 3 37 we have for each n 1 2 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 3 41 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn cn n hv f l 2 rn dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn dt w 1 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn dt w 2 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn cn n hv f l 2 rn based on this we would obtain 3 26 if we have the following three inequalities 3 42 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c 1 2 hv f l 2 rn as well as 3 43 dt w 1 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 4 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c 1 2 hv f l 2 rn and finally 3 44 dt w 2 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 4 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn indeed we just combine 3 41 3 44 and use a simple bootstrapping argument which is justified since the right side of 3 44 is finite by the aforementioned sobolev estimates for hv 20 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials to prove these three estimates we shall use theorem 3 1 as we may since as mentioned before the forcing terms in 3 38 3 39 and 3 40 obey the support assumption in 3 10 to prove 3 42 we note that if f is as an 3 38 then since w is as in 3 26 we have 3 45 f t x i t hv i t e it 1 hv hv f x i t t e it 1 hv hv f x consequently we may use the l 2 estimate 3 11 in theorem 3 1 to deduce that dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 2 1 2 i t t e it 1 hv hv f l 2 t x r rn 1 2 hv f l 2 rn as desired to prove 3 43 and 3 44 we shall need to use 3 12 and 3 13 in theorem 3 1 note that 1 q 1 q 2 n if q 2 n n 2 q 2 n n 2 consequently if we use 3 12 3 40 ho lder s inequality and 3 35 then we conclude that we can fix 1 r 1 large enough so that we have 3 46 dt w 2 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c v 2 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c v 2 ln 2 rn w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 4 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn assuming as we may in the last step that if 1 r 1 is as in 3 35 c 1 r 1 14 similarly by repeating the above argument and using the support condition on v 1 we have 3 47 dt w 1 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c v 1 w 1 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c v 1 ln 2 rn r 1 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c v ln 2 rn r 1 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn where r 1 c 0 rn with r 1 1 if x r 1 and vanishes if x 2 r 1 although at the moment we do not obtain the right side of 3 43 as we want we gain a support function r which will allow us to use 3 13 to see this as in 3 37 we shall split 3 48 r 1 w r 1 w r 1 w 1 r 1 w 2 with w w 1 w 2 satisfying 3 38 3 39 3 40 correspondingly but with a different choice of r in 3 34 which we shall specify later by 3 41 and 3 47 we would obtain 3 43 if we have the following inequalities 3 49 r 1 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn c 1 2 hv f l 2 rn uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials 21 3 50 r 1 dt w 1 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 8 c 1 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn and finally 3 51 r 1 dt w 2 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 8 c 1 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn with c 1 c v ln 2 rn as in 3 47 note that 3 49 follows directly from 3 42 and 3 51 follows from 3 46 if we choose 2 r 2 large enough such that r 2 r 1 and c 2 r 2 18 c 1 up until now we have not used the condition that we need the condition to obtain 3 50 with the required small constant on the right side to see this note that by applying 3 13 for r r 2 and using the fact that v 1 2 and supp v 1 br 2 we have 3 52 r 1 dt w 1 l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn cr 2 1 2 v 1 w l 2 tl 2 x r r n cr 2 r 2 2 1 2 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn thus if we choose such that 2 8 c v ln 2 rn cr 2 r 2 2 we obtain 3 50 for which complete the proof of 3 26 the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of theorem 3 1 with a focus on the fourier analysis related to the standard laplacian or free schro dinger equation in euclidean space in other words we can assume v 0 from now on to proceed if is as in 2 46 let us define wider cutoffs that we shall also use as follows 3 53 s j 10 2 js c 0 2 10 210 for future use note that 3 54 s 1 on 1 4 4 for fixed 0 1 our first estimate concerns the operator 3 55 u t 1 t p e it 1 e t where 1 s 1 0 s denote the heaviside function and p for later use let us note that we can rewrite this operator indeed if we recall that 2 1 eit i d 1 t e t we deduce that 3 56 u t f x i 2 eit i p f x d also if we regard u as an operator sending functions of x into functions of x t then its adjoint is the operator 3 57 u f x 0 e s e is 1 p f s x ds 22 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials consequently 3 58 u t u s f s x ds 1 t 0 ei t s 1 e t s 2 p e 2 sf s x ds note also that if say 3 59 f t x 0 t 0 1 then the solution to the scaled inhomogeneous schro dinger equation with damping term 3 60 i t g i w t x f t x w 0 0 is given by 3 61 w t x i 1 t 0 ei t s 1 e t s f s x ds 2 1 1 0 ei t s i f s x d ds thus since w t 0 for t 0 it follows from 3 56 3 57 and 3 61 that 3 62 2 p w t x i 1 t 0 u t u s e 2 sf s x ds 2 1 1 0 ei t s i 2 p f s x d ds using these formulas we claim that we can use the keel tao 12 theorem to deduce the following proposition 3 4 suppose that f satisfies the support assumption in 3 59 and that w solves 3 60 then for 1 we have 3 63 2 p w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 2 1 2 f l 2 t x 0 1 rn and also 3 64 2 p w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 rn additionally if for all times t supp f t br with br being a fixed ball of radius r 1 in rn centered at origin we have 3 65 2 p w

potentials 23 and since v t v s f x 1 t 1 s e t s 2 n rn rn ei x y t s 2 2 f y d dy by stationary phase methods we have v t v s l 1 rn l rn t s n 2 we can use the keel tao theorem along with these two inequalities to deduce that v t f l 2 t l 2 n n 2 x r rn f l 2 rn as well as t 0 v t v s g s ds l 2 t l 2 n n 2 x r rn g l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn and 0 v s g s ds l 2 rn g l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn using 3

using 3 62 along with 3 67 we find that if h e 2 sf 2 p w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 1 0 1 t s u t u s h s l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn ds 1 2 1 0 u s h s l 2 x ds 1 2 1 0 f s l 2 x ds 1 2 1 2 f l 2 t x 0 1 rn as desired which is 3 63 to prove 3 66 note that if we assume 3 70 2 p w t x i 1 rn r k t s x y f s y dsdy 24 uniform sobolev estimates in rn involving singular potentials then by 3 62 we have 3 71 k t s x y 2 n 1 0 t s e t s rn ei x y t s 1 2 2 d since in proving 3 65 we only consider the case where x y br by the definition of in 3 53 and using integration by parts 3 72 k t s x y cn n 1 x y t s n if t s 211 r now let us choose a function c 0 r satisfying t 0 if t 1 and j t j 1 given r 1 we shall set 3 73 j t j r t 2 11 r 1 t j and write 3 74 k t s x y k 1 t s x y k 2 t s x y j s z j k 1 j t k

than the right side of 3 65 hence it suffices to consider the case where t s are supported near diagonal i e we need to show that 3 76 k 1 f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r br cr 1 2 f l 2 tl 2 x 0 1 rn firstly for fixed j k using 3 62 along with 3 67 we find that if h k s e 2 sf j t k s k t s x y f s y dsdy l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn 1 0 1 t s u t u s h s l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn ds 1 2 1 0 u s h s l 2 x ds 1 2 1 0

shall basically repeat the argument at the end of section 2 in 8 to proceed we shall require the following two elementary lemmas which are analogous to lemma 2 2 and lemma 2 3 in 8 lemma 3 5 let c 0 and 1 p 2 q then 3 77 p f lq rn cp q sup 0 1 n 1 p 1 q f lp rn lemma 3 6 suppose that 3 78 k t t 1 t t 2 then if 1 p q we have the following uniform bounds for 1 3 79 k t t g t dt l p tl q x r rn c g

have for 1 3 80 wf lptlqx r rn c 1 s 1 p f lstlrx r rn both lemmas are well known the first lemma is a direct consequence of sobolev estimates and spectral theorem while the second lemma is essentially theorem 0 3 6 in 19 for more details about the proof of the two lemmas see i e 8 proof of theorem 3 1 we first note that the kernel of dt is o 1 t t 2 therefore by 3 79 dt 2 p w lpt lqx r

ei t s p 2 i 1 2 p f s d ds l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn actually 3 81 also implies that dt i 2 p w enjoys a better bound than 2 p w since we do not have the 1 2 factor on the right

translates to the bound t s 1 t s 2 2 2 1 if we use lemma 3 5 we deduce from this that the frozen operators tt sh x ei t s p 2 i 1 2 p h x d satisfy 3 83 tt sh l 2 n n 2 rn 1 t s 2 2 1 h l 2 rn as well as 3 84 tt sh l 2 n n 2 rn 1 t s 2 h l 2 n n 2 rn due to the fact that n 1 2 n 2 2 n 1 and n n 2 2 n n 2 2 n 2 if we combine 3 83 and 3 80 we conclude that the left side of 3 81 is dominated by 1 f l 2 t x r rn which is better than the bounds posited in 3 81 by a factor of 1 2 similarly if we combine 3 84 and 3 80 we find that the left side of 3 82 is dominated by f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r rn which
