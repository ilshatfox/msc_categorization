khovanov homology and binary dihedral representations for marked links sherry gong january 9 2018 abstract we introduce a version of khovanov homology for alternating links with marking data inspired by instanton theory we show that the analogue of the spectral sequence from khovanov homology to singular instanton homology introduced in 10 for this marked khovanov homology collapses on the e 2 page for alternating links we moreover show that for non split links the khovanov homology we introduce for alternating links does not depend on thus the instanton homology also does not depend on for non split alternating links finally we study a version of binary dihedral representations for links with markings and show that for links of non zero determinant this also does not depend on 1 introduction throughout this paper we shall work over a field of characteristic 2 let l s 3 be a link and let be a one dimensional submanifold of s 3 with boundary in l thought of as the poincare dual of w 2 q where q is an so 3 bundle on the link complement s 3 l in 10 kronheimer and mrowka introduced a singular instanton homology i l for a link l with singular bundle data given by and they constructed a spectral sequence with e 2 page the khovanov homology of the link which abuts to i l i l h 0 that is the instanton homology of l with a hopf link h at infinity and 0 a single arc between the two components of h they further show that for alternating knots the spectral sequence collapses on the e 2 page for pl a projection of the link l kronheimer and mrowka s spectral sequence can be generalised to all so that it becomes a spectral sequence whose e 2 page is an object we call h pl and which abuts to i l i l h 0 where h pl is constructed as follows let a denote the z 2 algebra z 2 x x 2 consider the cube of resolutions of of a link projection pl with n crossings where each vertex v 0 1 n of the cube is assigned a resolution dv by resolving each crossing as in figure 1 figure 1 1 ar x iv 1 80 1 02 58 5 v 1 m at h g t 8 j an 2 01 8 at each vertex of the cube we then have an unlink and some marked points on the unlink representing the boundary of let c pl be the complex that assigns to a resolution of c components a c if each of the components has an even number of endpoints of and otherwise assigns that resolution 0 for example for the trefoil with to the right the resolutions are as given in figure 2 the only resolutions whose unlink has more than one component for which the a c has not been replaced with 0 is the 1 0 0 resolution because for that one the arc has endpoints on the same component of the unlink figure 2 the differentials in c pl are along edges of the cube as depicted in figure 2 and given by the merge map m a a a and the split map a a a where m 1 1 1 m 1 x m x 1 x m x x 0 and 1 1 x x 1 x x x when the source and target are both non zero definition 1 1 the marked khovanov homology of pl with h pl is the homology of the complex c pl for a link projection pl with marking data and a basepoint p pl we may also consider the reduced complex cred pl formed by at each vertex replacing the a in a n corresponding to the component with the basepoint with a x similarly to the usual reduced khovanov complex the differentials in this complex are defined similarly replacing m and with the induced maps mred and red on the quotients the following definition is the reduced version of the above definition 1 2 the reduced marked khovanov homology of pl with hred pl is the ho mology of the complex cred pl in general h pl is not a marked link invariant in that it is not invariant with respect to moving an endpoint of along a component nor is it invariant with respect to reidermeister ii and iii moves in this paper however we show an invariance result for alternating link projections 2 theorem 1 3 for an alternating projection pl of an alternating link l with marking data h pl is a marked link invariant that is it is invariant with respect to different projections for the same alternating link and with respect to moving an endpoint of along a component of the link moreover for non split alternating links it does not depend on for based links the same is true for hred pl analogously to the spectral sequence in 10 there is a spectral sequence from h pl to i l in 10 they show that the spectral sequence collapses for quasi alternating knots k we extend that to a result for alternating link projections l with marking data theorem 1 4 for alternating link projections pl the spectral sequence from h pl to i l collapses on the e 2 page combining this theorem with theorem 1 3 we have corollary 1 5 for non split alternating links l the instanton homology i l does not depend on in 8 kronheimer and mrowka also exhibited filtrations q and h on the khovanov complex for an alternating link such that the khovanov differential increases h by 1 and preserves q and such that the difference between the instanton differential and the khovanov differential has order 1 with respect to the h filtration and 2 with respect to the q filtration they moreover use this to show that the isomorphism types of the pages of the spectral sequence with respect to the q and h filtrations are link invariants we extend the q filtration result to links with certain specifically consider corresponding to singular bundle data p satisfying that on the cobordism corresponding to each diagonal of the cube we have p w 2 p 0 mod 4 where p is the pontrjagin square here p is defined in section 2 2 as in 10 to be a certain principal pu 2 bundle on a non hausdorff space x coming from x where is the cobordism and x is the ambient space s 3 r for such we define a q filtration on the modified khovanov complex so that the instanton differential has order 0 we use this to show that the isomorphism class of the first page of the spectral sequence from h pl to the instanton homology is a tangle invariant of the tangle obtained by considering the part of the link outside of a ball containing in 15 scaduto and stoffregen studied the homology of the complex c pl which they called hd d and exhibited its relation via a spectral sequence to the framed instanton homology of the double branched cover of the link this spectral sequence is the framed instanton theory analogue of the spectral sequence in 10 they moreover conjecture a relation between hd d and a twisted khovanov homology similar to those in 2 6 and 14 which is an invariant of links with marking data and which also has a spectral sequence relating it to the framed instanton homology we will also look at modifying the space of binary dihedral representations to account for recall that the binary dihedral group bd su 2 s 3 h is given by bd s 1 a s 1 b where s 1 a e i and s 1 b je i recall that a dihedral subgroup of so 3 is a a group generated by rotations about a fixed axis and reflections about the orthogonal plane to that axis and a binary dihedral representation g su 2 is a representation whose image in so 3 via the canonical map su 2 so 3 is contained in a dihedral subgroup the space of binary dihedral representations of the fundamental group of a link complement which are conjugate to representations 1 s 3 k bd su 2 has been studied as a link 3 invariant in 7 klassen showed that for 1 s 3 k for a knot k the number of conjugacy classes of non abelian homomorphisms bd is k 1 1 2 where k t is the alexander polynomial of k in 17 zentner studied knots with the property that all of its su 2 representations are binary dihedral and called such knots su 2 simple he showed that if a knot k is su 2 simple and satisfies a certain genericity hypothesis then the higher differentials on the instanton complex vanish in this case we study a modification of the space of binary dihedral representations for links with note that all the meridians of each component of l are conjugate to each other in 1 s 3 l moreover elements of s 1 b can only be conjugate to other elements of s 1 b so either all meridians of a given component of l go to s 1 b or they all go to s 1 a for the representation to be non abelian they must go to s 1 b for at least one component to modify the link invariant of binary dihedral representations to account for in the spirit of the representations spaces that arise in instanton homology we consider the space of representations of 1 s 3 l which take the meridians around to 1 we will primarily want to consider the representations which map the meridians around the link components to s 1 b let l li be the components of li definition 1 6 for a link l let the spaces of marked binary dihedral representations modulo conjugation be denoted by r l 1 s 3 l bd 1 s 1 a conj and rb l 1 s 3 l bd li s 1 b 1 s 1 a conj where li is a meridian around li and is a meridian around these are marked link invariants that is lemma 1 7 the dependence on of the spaces r l and rb l can be reduced to the parity of the number of endpoints of on each component in particular if l is a knot then these invariants do not depend on we shall prove that similarly to the khovanov homology we defined for non split alternating links and more generally for links of non zero determinant this invariant does not depend on theorem 1 8 for a link l with non zero determinant and singular bundle data the number of conjugacy classes of binary dihedral representations in rb l does not depend on we will also show a partial converse to this for a link l with determinant zero the number of conjugacy classes in rb l does depend on in particular rb l 6 but we will show that there is such that rb l is empty 2 marked points khovanov homology given a link projection pl with a finite set of marked points recall in the introduction we defined a complex c pl which was like the khovanov complex but with 0 instead of a n at vertices of the cube where a component has an odd number of marked points in the latter case where a component has an odd number of marked points we say that kills the vertex in the modified khovanov complex 4 lemma 2 1 the c pl defined above is actually a complex ie d 2 0 proof just as in the usual khovanov homology we need only show that squares in the cube com mute d 10 d 11 d 00 6 d 01 6 if does not kill any of the corners in the square then the edge maps are the same as those in the usual khovanov complex so the square commutes if d 00 or d 11 is killed or if d 10 and d 01 are both killed then the square obviously commutes the only remaining case is that d 00 and d 11 are both not killed but one of d 10 and d 01 is killed without loss of generality assume that it is d 10 then there must be a two components in the d 10 diagram with an odd number of marked points each and these two components must be merged into one component in both d 00 and d 11 this is only possible when the square is the projection of a two component unlink that has two crossings between the components corresponding to the two dimensions of the square thus the other map d 00 d 01 d 11 is m which is 0 because m 1 m 1 x x 1 0 because we are over a field of characteristic 2 and m x m x x 0 at this point we have not assumed that the projection is alternating but it already makes sense to consider the spectral sequence from h pl to i l analogous to the one in 10 however h pl is not an independent of the choice of projection for l nor of choice of where the endpoints of are on the components for a counterexample to the latter see figure 3 figure 3 in this non alternating projection for an unknot with being the arc shown it is easy to see that h pl has dimension 6 over z 2 z however if we used a projection with no crossings we would get dimension 2 5 2 1 marked points and alternating links we have now seen an example that shows that our marked point khovanov homology may change as an endpoint of slides along a component in the link we shall see however that this cannot happen for alternating link projections proposition 2 2 for an alternating link projection the complex above is well defined up to not necessarily degree preserving quasi isomorphism that is the operations of sliding an end point across a crossing does not change the complex up to not necessarily degree preserving quasi isomorphism to that end first let us show that for alternating link projections we can compute our homology dropping one of the crossings remark throughout this discourse in all diagrams the vertical maps will always correspond to the one crossing we are trying to drop definition 2 3 note that if we drop one crossing in a cube a resolutions ie leave it unresolved we still have unlinks because a projection with only one crossing can only be an unlink we will call a partial resolution that is an unlink a pseudo diagram resolution for crossing x on the alternating link projection pl with marking data we define a complex c pl x whose underlying groups are the same as before if there are k crossings total form the k 1 dimensional cube of resolutions from resolving all crossings except x place a n at a vertex where there are n components to the unlink there unless some component has an odd number of markings in which case place 0 these are the chain groups let us define the differential dc there is a map for each edge and edges correspond to crossings so let us define the differential corresponding to edge y thus type 0 the number of components in the pseudodiagram resolution changes and neither source nor target is killed by in this case take the maps to be m or the merging or splitting maps of the khovanov complex type 1 the number of components of the pseudodiagram resolution changes and at least one of source or target is killed by in this case the map is 0 type 2 the number of components of the pseudodiagram resolution does not change in this case the map is 0 lemma 2 4 for a link projection the cube with a dropped crossing c dc defined above forms a complex since we are working over z 2 this is saying that the cube commutes proof consider a square in c c 2 c 4 c 1 6 c 3 6 there are two crossings that are being resolved in this square in addition to the crossing left unresolved let us consider only the active components that is the components in the pseudo diagram resolutions in question that involve at least one of the crossings let ai be the number of active components in the pseudodiagram resolution corresponding to ci 6 note that the minimal ai is at most two because in the corner of the square with the minimal ai each crossing can only involve one component if the total number of endpoints of on these active components is odd then all the ci are 0 so the diagram commutes we assume that the total number of endpoints on the active components is even moreover if the unresolved crossing is not in one of the active components then the diagram commutes because it looks the same as the marked khovanov for a fully resolved link which we showed commutes above thus we may assume that the unresolved crossing is on an active component we do some casework 1 if min ai 2 consider the corner with minimal ai it has two components both of which are active there cannot be a crossing that goes between components or resolving it the other way would lead to lower ai thus there must be one crossing on each of the two components in this case it is clear that the diagram commutes because the two crossings act independently of each other and are then tensored together for all other cases min ai 1 2 if min ai 1 and max ai 3 in this case all the maps change number of components so they are m or 0 where they are only 0 if either the source or the target is 0 then all maps are analogous to the case where we did not drop a crossing in particular at the corner with ai 1 the two resolved crossings must each be restricted to one wing of the component which means that if we resolve the remaining crossing in a way that doesn t change the number of components at the vertex with ai 1 we do not affect the other groups and morphisms in the diagram commutativity now follows from commutativity for the case with all crossings resolved 3 if min ai 1 and max ai 2 if adjacent vertices on the cube all have different ai then we get commutativity for the same reason that commutativity works in the case where we do not drop a crossing since all the maps are analogous as in the previous case so we may assume that there is either a pair of adjacent vertices with ai 1 or there is a pair with ai 2 if there are simultaneously a pair with ai 1 and a pair with ai 2 then it is clear that however you traverse the square you get zero so it commutes in there aren t both pairs simultaneously then the ai are either 1 1 1 2 in some order or 2 2 2 1 in some order since m 0 the case 1 1 1 2 commutes the case 2 2 2 1 is not actually possible consider the corner with one component this is a single loop with a crossing on it which divides it into two wings there are two other crossings on it such that if you resolve either of the crossings in the other way you get two loops this means each of these two crossings must be restricted to one wing ie it must go from one wing to itself if the two crossings are on different wings then switching the resolutions for both would give you 3 components thus we have that both crossings are restricted to the same wing then one wing does not have any crossing endpoints on it which means that we can think of the diagram ignoring the crossing and the empty wing thus it is not possible for another crossing not the change the number of components a contradiction 7 4 if min ai 1 and max ai 1 in this case all edge maps are 0 so the square commutes this finishes the cases and we have shown commutativity let c be the cube with one of the crossings not dropped and a and b be the corresponding cubes when we resolve that crossing in the 0 and 1 configurations we will establish maps ai bi ci ai for i 0 1 n 1 that commute with the maps in the cube such that ai bi ci ai bi is exact and also this splits i will define what that means in this context the maps within a b and c are already defined as shown in figure 4 define the maps b c a b c a thus whenever there are maps between terms with a different number of components take m or unless either the source or the target is 0 which happens when one of the components of the corresponding unlink has an odd number of endpoints of in which case the map is 0 if the source and target unlinks have the same number of components let the map be 0 unless an unresolved crossing divides a component into two parts with an odd number of marked points on each side in exactly one of the source and target in which case let the map be id figure 4 lemma 2 5 the cube commutes and for i 0 1 n the sequences ai bi ci ai bi are exact proof the exactness is easy to see as for the commutation we wish to show that squares contain ing the vertical maps commute for squares that only involve as and bs we have already shown this above when we checked that out modified khovanov homology forms a complex 8 this means it remains to show that the complex a 1 a 2 c 1 6 c 2 6 b 1 6 b 2 6 commutes as before let us ignore components that are not touched by either of the two crossings in question and only look at ones that are ie the active ones note that two crossings are involved in this picture the one corresponding to the vertical edges is the one we will be leaving unresolved in row c call this x the two columns correspond to the resolutions of the other call this y let a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 denote the number of components in the pseudo diagram resolutions corre sponding to a 1 a 2 b 1 and b 2 respectively note that min ai 2 again we divide into cases 1 if min ai 2 in this case at the corner of the ab square with the minimal number of components neither crossing x nor y goes between components and since both components have to be involved that means x is on one component and y on the other the maps then act independently on corresponding tensor factors so the squares commute figure 5 2 if min ai 1 and max ai 3 then the resolution looks like one of the resolutions in figure 5 possibly with in the corner with three components one of the components does not involve x therefore it persists in the entire column if that component has an odd number of endpoints of then any composed map across any square has either vanishing source or vanishing target so the squares commute 9 otherwise we have that if the vertical maps on the left are f and g as in the diagram then the ones on the right are f id and g id then each square in question is m f 6 m f id 6 here f is one of 0 id m if f 0 or f id the diagram clearly commutes for f m or f the picture is the same as a classical khovanov diagram where instead of the loop with a crossing as in row c it is just a loop so the diagram commutes 3 if min ai 1 and max ai 2 in this case if we look at the square formed by a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 ie the one corresponding to the classical khovanov complex for the two crossings it must have two vertices with ai 1 opposite each other the other two vertices have ai 2 more specifically a 1 and b 2 must have one component and a 2 and b 1 must have two com ponents if this were reversed then the square would represent a link projection for an unlink with two crossings between the components which cannot be a projection of an alternating link thus the full picture not including looks as in figure 6 figure 6 in this figure the top row is the row corresponding to the ai the middle one to the ci and the bottom one to the bi the four cases are based on whether either or both of a 1 and b 2 are killed by note that in this case c 1 and c 2 must both have 1 component so the map c 1 c 2 is 0 thus to show that the squares commute it suffices to show that b 1 b 2 c 2 and c 1 a 1 a 2 are zero these compositions are both either 0 or m which is also 0 this concludes the proof that the complex composed of a b c as exhibited commutes 10 we shall now explain the sense in which the vertical exact sequences split as we alluded to earlier in figure 7 we show the four cases for what the vertical maps could be only taking into account components with the crossing x figure 7 let us exhibit di ei fi such that ai ei fi bi di fi and ci di ei such that map ai bi is 0 on ei and id fi fi and similarly for bi ci and ci ei this again happens by casework for the four cases 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 b in figure 2 then di ei fi are given by case 1 a ai ei fi with ei 1 x x 1 x x fi 1 1 1 x bi di fi with di 0 fi 1 x ci ei di with di 0 ei 1 x case 1 b ai ei fi with ei 0 fi 0 bi di fi with di 1 x fi 0 ci ei di with di 1 x ei 0 case 2 a ai ei fi with ei 0 fi 1 x bi di fi with ei 1 1 1 x fi 1 x x 1 x x ci ei di with di 1 x ei 0 case 2 b ai ei fi with ei 1 x fi 0 bi di fi with ei 0 0 ci ei di with di 0 ei 1 x 11 note that in the above definition we have to make some choice with the term fi ai in case 1 a and di bi in case 2 a our definition depends on the choice of ordering of the two components we can do this consistently by choosing some one of the four corners of the crossing we want unresolved and always taking the loop containing that corner to be the first we call this the first loop in defining the d e f we are considering the component of the pseudodiagram resolution containing the unresolved crossing for the rest we tensor up with a n 1 componentwise now we are looking at sequences of cubes e f d f d e e f we can split d into di where di is the direct sum of all parts of d where the sum of the indices is i similarly for e and f ei fi ei 1 fi 1 di ei 6 di 1 ei 1 6 di fi 6 di 1 fi 1 6 ei fi 6 ei 1 fi 1 6 where the horizontal maps are the differentials in the cubes a b c and the vertical maps are all identity on one component and 0 on the other let us consider what the horizontal maps are ie how the differentials within cubes a b and c look when written in terms of d e f let us consider da ei fi ei 1 fi 1 and write it as de def df note that def 0 because if it were nonzero consider di fi dd dfd ddf df di 1 fi 1 bi 1 ei fi 0 id 6 de def df ei 1 fi 1 ai 1 0 id 6 then if def 6 0 then some x ei maps nontrivially to fi 1 which then maps nontrivially up to fi 1 bi 1 but this is impossible because the diagram commutes and x maps to 0 di fi similarly dde and dfd 0 let us remark that for this argument it is not surprising that we do not need to take into account the choice we made for f a and d b whose definitions required a choice of a corner of unresolved crossing because the statement that def dde and dfd vanish is saying that the part that the vertical differential kills must map horizontally to the part of the target that the vertical differential kills 12 we can now write da de 0 df db dd 0 df and dc dd 0 de lemma 2 6 in the notation above 0 where e d proof notice that in the cube c in each vertex of the cube we have di 0 or ei 0 notice this by checking all the cases see figure 7 the cases with nonzero e are 1 a and 2 b and the ones with non zero d are 1 b and 2 a hence a part of the differential on c with 6 0 must be 1 a or 2 b 1 b or 2 a we divide into cases 1 a 1 b looking at the square on the a and b rows b 1 b 2 a 1 6 a 2 6 the vertical maps come from merges and the horizontal map on row a must come from a split because it goes from a resolution that doesn t split to one that splits counting numbers of components we see that the horizontal map on level b must also be a split thus if b 1 has i components then a 1 b 2 have i 1 and a 2 has i 2 counting only active components components that involve at least one of the two crossings i is 1 or 2 in case i 1 the original link cannot be alternating if i 2 we are looking at two crossings on two separate components in the b 1 corner at least one of which has split across the crossing which means either a 1 0 in which case the first column is not in case 1 a or b 2 0 in which case the second is not in case 1 b a contradiction 2 b 2 a this proof works exactly the same way the vertical maps come from splits and for the horizontal map b 1 b 2 to go from splitting to not splitting it must be a merge and then the same argument applies 1 a 2 a and 2 b 1 b note that the number of components in the resolution for a 1 must be of opposite parity to the number of components in the resolution for a 2 but this means that the number of components in the resolution for c 1 must be the same as that for c 2 thus for this map the differential c 1 c 2 is simply zero because on level c we defined the differential to be zero whenever it goes between two resolutions of the same number of components thus 0 13 from the above analysis we see that the cone of the differential a b is di 1 fi 1 fi ei with the differential di 1 fi 1 ei fi di fi ei 1 fi 1 given by dd 0 0 0 df 0 id 0 0 de 0 0 0 df observe moreover that d e and f are chain complexes and and are chain maps this is because 0 d 2 b dd 0 df 2 d 2 d 0 dd df d 2 f so d 2 d 0 d 2 f 0 and is a chain map using da we can show the same for de and let us consider the composition di ei 2 lemma 2 7 the cone of the map a b that is the complex di 1 fi 1 fi ei is quasi isomorphic to the complex di 1 ei di ei 1 with differential d dd 0 de which we can think of as a complex based on the psuedodiagram that gave rise to c but with an extra differential term which bumps the degree up by 2 ie the differential now has components in un adjusted for self intersection of cobordisms cohomological dimension both 1 and 2 proof consider the maps di 1 fi 1 ei fi di 1 ei i given by i x z x 0 z x and x y z w x z y let us check that these are chain maps d i x z dd 0 0 0 df 0 id 0 0 de 0 0 0 df x 0 z x ddx x x dez x df x ddx 0 dez x ddx i ddx x dez i d x z where the equality comes from the facts that is a chain map and that we are working over characteristic 2 for the other direction we have d x y z w dd 0 de x z y ddx x dez de y 14 ddx dez w x df y w ddx x df y w dez w dfw d x y z w having checked that the maps are chain maps we proceed to show that their compositions are chain homotopic to the identity for i note that i x z x 0 z x x z 0 x z so is a true left inverse of i for i we have i x y z w i x z y x 0 z y x to show that this is chain homotopic to the identity it suffices to show that 0 y y x w is chain homotopic to 0 consider h 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 then we have hd dh x y z w 0 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 x y z w 0 y y x w as desired note that terms of the form ci ci 2 will involve 2 crossings other than the dropped one so we can think of it as a diagonal map on a square in c we can now show that 0 for alternating links lemma 2 8 for alternating link projections with our notation as above 0 thus for alternating link projections the complex a b is quasi isomorphic to the complex c with differential dd 0 de but as 0 this is dd 0 0 de which is the complex for one dropped crossing by lemma 2 6 proof we will exhaustively go through all cases where 6 0 or 6 0 to see what could be to understand and we only need to look at two crossings the one that is unresolved in c which we call x and the other one which we call y consider the types 1 a 1 b 2 a and 2 b as in figure 7 note that can only be nonzero if we are going from a type where d 6 0 to a type where f 6 0 so this is only possible when we are going 6 0 1 b or 2 a 1 a or 2 a similarly 6 0 1 a or 2 a 1 a or 2 b we can eliminate some cases 15 let s consider a map 1 b 1 a if we start with the 1 b picture and switch crossing y then on level a we go from splitting to not splitting thus the map a 1 a 2 is a merge however a 1 b 1 and a 2 b 2 are both merges by the definition of types 1 a and 1 b so all four maps in the ab square are merges this however is impossible because the fact that we are going from 1 b to 1 a means that both the maps a 1 a 2 and a 1 b 1 must come from merges between the two components which have an odd number of endpoints of in a 1 but for two merges between the same two components the two crossing diagram this is resolving has to be a hopf link which means the maps a 2 b 2 and b 1 b 2 must be splits similarly for maps 2 a 2 b by counting components the horizontal arrows must either both arise from merges or both arise from splits but the condition that only the b 2 diagram separates contradicts this thus for 6 0 the only possibilities are 1 b 2 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 b 2 a 2 a 1 a all four of these possibilities involve some map 2 a 1 a again let us consider the ab square for this b 1 b 2 a 1 6 a 2 6 since this picture is 2 a to 1 a the vertical maps are on the left and m on the right thus counting components we see that the horizontal maps can only be on the bottom and m on the top the map c 1 c 2 therefore comes from a resolution switch that doesn t change the number of components the crossing therefore has to go between the wings of a loop with x on it thus if we leave both x and y unresolved we get either a hopf link or a two component unlink with two crossings between components the 00 resolution of this picture has only one component so of these two possibilities it must be the unlink such an unlink projection however is not alternating so we have reached a contradiction corollary 2 9 for alternating link projections pl with the rank of the khovanov homology with we defined is invariant with respect to dragging endpoints of around a component proof the only problem case is when you drag an endpoint diagonally across a crossing and in this case we can compare both sides to the complex with that crossing dropped the one crossing dropped complex doesn t see where the endpoint is corollary 2 10 for alternating link projections pl with where l is not split the rank of the marked link khovanov homology of pl with does not depend on 16 proof consider some arc in with its two endpoints on two components of l we may call them l 1 lk where there are components l 1 l 2 lk such that li and li 1 have a crossing between them because l is not split then we can replace with i where i has one endpoint on li and one on li 1 and is sitting on adjacent branches of a crossing between li and li 1 which we call xi then adding each i does not affect the complex because we can consider the complex with xi unresolved in the resulting pseudo diagram resolution i cannot kill components because i sits across crossing xi which is not being resolved meaning i does not affect the underlying groups in the complex with xi unresolved and it is easy to see from the definition that it also does not affect any of the differentials thus it does not affect the homology of the complex with xi unresolved which means it also does not affect the homology of the original complex now we can remove the i one by one not changing the homology of the complex so removing the entire arc does not change the homology of the complex we may further remove all the arcs of one by one as desired as a consequence of this last corollary we see that the marked khovanov homology for alter nating link projections we defined is just the usual khovanov homology of the link in particular it is also a link invariant completing the proof of theorem 1 3 for h pl for the reduced version note that the same proof holds we may still form the complex with the dropped crossing by taking quotients by x appropriately lemma 2 5 still holds because the sequence a x a a x a a x a x with maps given by red mred and 0 is still exact then in the splitting of the complexes a b and c into d e and f there is a little bit of subtlety with the choice of f in case 1 a and e in case 1 b in particular let us make the choice so that if the the base point is on the active components then it is on the second component so that in case 1 a we have fi 1 1 and ei x 1 and for case 1 b ei 1 1 and fi x 1 then we again get direct sum decompositions this change in the choice for fi and ei does not affect the proof that def dfd and dde vanish in general nor for or for alternating links thus by the same argument we get that hred pl does not depend on completing the proof of theorem 1 3 2 2 a discussion of filtrations for non alternating links 2 2 1 dropped crossings without we have shown that for alternating link projections has no effect on h pl by way of a complex that comes from dropping one crossing the latter complex was inspired by the crossing dropping procedure that kronheimer and mrowka introduced in 8 let us omit for the moment and examine more carefully how the property that the projection was alternating came into our picture and how it relates to the one in 8 this will give another explanation for why one can drop a crossing when computing the khovanov homology of alternating link projections without in link projection that is not necessarily alternating most of the statements in subsection 2 1 regarding khovanov complexes computed with dropped crossings continue to hold though there are more cases to consider and we must take more care when defining the differentials in the pseudo diagram in the case of maps between resolutions with the same number of components 17 in particular this more subtle complex still commutes as in lemma 2 4 and still fits into a larger complex with the dropped crossing resolved as in lemma 2 5 moreover the exact sequence still has the splitting into d e f with 0 the main difference is that now does not necessarily vanish thus we still get a complex based on the resolutions with one dropped crossing but now the cube may have diagonal maps across squares let us compare this to what happens in 8 in which kronheimer and mrowka consider an oriented link projection pl and a subset n of its crossings such that resolutions of pl at the n crossings yield pseudo diagram resolutions they form the complex c lv d where lv runs over the resolutions of l and chain maps arise from counting solutions to the asd equation on the corresponding cobordisms they further consider two filtrations on the complex h and q coming from the topologies of the cobordisms and show that the isomorphism types of the pages of the corresponding spectral sequences for both of these filtrations are invariants of l these filtrations are given by q q c n v c 3 2 v o n 2 n and h c n v c 1 2 v o n where q is a grading on r x x 2 l which has x in grading 1 and 1 in grading 1 on the summand cv where v c denotes the resolution of c that is it is 0 or 1 depending on how c is resolved in the pseudo diagram resolution at cv with v c 1 for the 0 resolution and v c 0 for the 1 resolution o is a chosen vertex of the cube where the corresponding resolution can be oriented in a way that is consistent with the orientation on l v u is the self intersection svo svo of the cobordism svo when u v and is defined for u 6 v in such a way that it is additive that is for u v w w v v u w u and n and n the number of positive and negative crossings of the n crossings respectively remark in this subsection we will be following the notation in 8 and 10 in which the maps go from the 1 resolution to the 0 resolution so we are actually looking at the resolutions of the mirror image of the link this is the reverse of the direction our maps were going in subsection 2 1 consider the first page of this spectral sequence e 1 d 1 h where d 1 h fi fi 1 fi 1 fi 2 is the map induced by the differential on the page of the spectral sequence arising from the h filtration kronheimer and mrowka show in 8 proposition 10 2 that when all the crossings of l are resolved only maps along the edges of the cubes come into d 1 h and they show in 10 section 8 2 that these maps agree with the khovanov edge maps d 1 let us consider what happens when one crossing is left unresolved in this case the edge cobordisms in question have two possibilities if the edge corresponds to a change in number of components in the resolution then the cobordism is a pair of pants and otherwise it is a twice punctured rp 2 here we are only concerning ourselves with the parts of the cobordisms between the active components the rest of the cobordisms consist of cylinders which contribute to neither s nor s s if a cobordism s is a pair of pants then s s 0 if s is a twice punctured rp 2 consider the two crossing projection given by the unresolved crossing and the crossing that corresponds to the edge in question this cobordism is as depicted in figure 8 with the map left to right corresponding 18 to the hopf link and right to left corresponding to the unlink this is the opposite to the khovanov differentials because the e 1 d 1 page of the instanton complex corresponds to the mirror image of the khovanov complex figure 8 figure 9 by sliding the arcs around it is easy to see that these are the same as the cobordisms in figure 9 it was shown in lemma 7 2 of 10 that the cobordism going from the right to the left in 9 has self intersection 2 so the one left to right has self intersection 2 we conclude that for cobordisms corresponding to an unlink the self intersection is 2 and for hopf links it is 2 if l is an alternating link projection for v u if any punctured rp 2 s are involved in the path from v to u they must correspond to hopf links rather than unlinks because if we resolve some crossings of an alternating projection the resulting projection is still alternating thus for alternating projections svu svu 0 consequently the difference in h satisfies h u h v v u 1 2 v u which is at least 1 for edges and at least 2 for diagonals in the cube therefore the e 1 d 1 page does not involve diagonal maps in the cube and it is easy to check that it agrees with the cube from our previous section if l is non alternating however there may be diagonal maps on the cube that are part of d 1 that is which shift h by 1 this is because the change in h as you go along the diagonal is equal to the change in naive grading the grading on the cube shifted by 1 2 v u but now for v u v u could be positive thus some diagonals could change h by only 1 let us consider which diagonals can appear in the d 1 h level it was shown in 8 that when only one crossing is dropped v u 2 for any two vertices so the change in h can be at most 1 off from the change in naive grading thus the d 1 includes only edge maps and diagonal maps across squares now using the q grading one can write down what the diagonal maps across squares must be 2 2 2 figure 3 an example non alternating link projection with in the case of links with marking data the pages with respect to the q filtration in 8 no longer provide invariants this makes sense because the q filtration comes from studying the maps in the cube of instanton complexes which come from counting points in zero dimensional moduli spaces of certain anti self dual connections more specifically for a cobordism s s 3 r from lv s 3 to lu s 3 and singular bundle data p on s s 3 r we are considering connections on p that satisfy the perturbed asd 19 equation and agree with 1 and 0 on the ends for such connections the action which is given by a 1 8 2 x tr fa fa is a homotopy invariant of the path a and also satisfies a 1 4 p 1 p x 1 16 s s mod 1 2 where x and p are set up as follows let x s 3 r and let s x be a two dimensional submanifold recall from 10 that a pu 2 bundle p on x s modelled on 1 4 id gives rise to a double cover s of s coming from the two ways to extend p to s from this kronheimer and mrowka constructed a non hausdorff space x equipped with a map x x that is an isomorphism over x s and such that the pre image of s is s and a pu 2 bundle p over x which agrees with p outside of a neighbourhood of s x in 10 kronheimer and mrowka further constructed a space xh a hausdorff space with the same weak homotopy type as x and showed that x is a half integral class in h 4 x h q thus for p 1 p h 4 xh z we may consider the half integer p 1 p x moreover since p 1 p p w 2 p mod 4 where p is the pontryagin square p 1 p x p w 2 p x mod 2 for 1 and 0 solutions to the perturbed chern simons functional on the ends flat connections in the unperturbed case the dimension of the moduli space of solutions to the perturbed asd equation that agree with 1 and 0 on the ends in a homotopy class of paths with action is given by the formula dim m s 1 0 8 s 1 2 s s q 1 q 0 dim g where q is the grading on a n defined in subsection 2 2 1 g is the space of metrics over which the moduli space of connections sits and is the euler characteristic the coefficient of 0 in the image of 1 under the differential is then given by counting the number of points in the zero dimensional moduli space ie those paths with 8 s 1 2 s s q 1 q 0 dim g 0 the non negativity of the action for anti self dual connections implies that for small perturba tions 0 moreover in the situation without 1 4 p 1 p x 0 mod 1 2 because p 1 p is a multiple of 4 and x is a half integral class thus 12 s s 4 b s s 8 c the proof of invariance of the isomorphism type of the complex in the category of homotopy classes of q or h filtered chain complexes comes from keeping track of constraints on the edges and diagonal maps in the cube coming from the dimension formula above in the fully resolved case invariance of the isomorphism type of the khovanov homology could be extracted from looking at the h filtration for the diagonal maps and showing that there are no diagonal maps on the cube with h order 1 thus the isomorphism type of the khovanov homology agrees with that of the e 2 page of the instanton complex with respect to the h filtration and is therefore a link invariant in the case of the counterexample in figure 3 from subsection 2 1 we can still use the dimension calculation essentially to write down what the diagonal maps on the cube of instanton complexes 20 figure 10 have to be consider the cube of resolutions in figure 10 the groups c 1 0 0 c 1 1 0 c 1 0 1 and c 0 1 1 vanish the maps c 0 0 0 c 0 1 0 and c 0 0 0 c 0 0 1 can be seen to be merge maps as seen in section 8 of 10 the remaining possible maps are c 0 0 0 c 1 1 1 c 0 1 0 c 1 1 1 and c 0 0 1 c 1 1 1 from the definition given in 10 dim g is one less than the number of crossings in the cobor dism it is then easy to see that s dim g 1 so s dim g 1 moreover since the cobordisms in the diagram are orientable s s 0 thus for moduli spaces of dimension 0 we must have q 0 q 1 8 1 as in 8 we have 0 and 1 4 p 1 p x however p 1 p is no longer a multiple of 4 to figure out what it is instead let us consider the cobordisms in question the cobordisms 0 1 0 1 1 1 and 0 0 1 1 1 1 are twice punctured tori and the cobordism 0 0 0 1 1 1 is a thrice punctured torus if we cap off the ends we get a torus with given by a circle that winds once around each representative of h 1 to calculate the action in this situation let us consider the double branched cover the double branched cover of t 2 in s 4 is s 2 s 2 with t 2 s 1 s 1 sitting inside it as the product of the equators of the two s 2 s in this picture s 4 represents the h 2 s 2 s 2 class s 2 pt pt s 2 consequently on the double branched cover p w 2 p 2 mod 4 where p denotes the pontrjagin square thus p 1 p 2 mod 4 and 14 p 1 p s 2 s 2 1 2 mod 1 the action on the double branched cover is twice the action on the base so on the original space 1 4 mod 2 from here we see that q 0 q 1 8 1 1 mod 4 so by parity the only possible diagonal map is the one c 0 0 0 c 1 1 1 which takes x x to x and either 1 x or x 1 to 1 we know these maps must appear in the instanton complex because otherwise it would be impossible to end up with the right value for the instanton homology 21 remark this does not tell us which of the maps 1 x 1 and x 1 1 happens the specific map in the chain complex may depend on the choice of perturbation 2 3 modifying the q filtration in the presence of in the previous section we explained what happens to kronheimer and mrowka s q and h filtrations when a crossing is dropped in the case of non alternating links in this section we give a modification of the q filtration to show an analogous result to the q part of corollary 1 3 in 8 which stated that the isomorphism types of the pages of the spectral sequence with respect to the q filtration are link invariants for a projection pl of a link taking the cube of pseudo diagram resolutions with 0 1 or 2 adjacent meaning there are no crossings or endpoints of between them opposite sign dropped crossings with certain we define a modified version of the q filtration for the cube let us define the particular kind of that we would like to work with definition 2 11 we say that is trivial at a resolution if no component has an odd number of end points we say that is good if for every cobordism between projections with trivial ie for all diagonals vu of the cube including those which do not satisfy v u once we cap off the ends and consider the resulting closed orientable surface with genus does not intertwine any of the genus this is equivalent to saying that for every such cobordism p w 2 0 mod 4 where p is the pontrjagin square in this subsection we will show the following theorem regarding good theorem 2 12 let pl be a link projection in s 2 and be good marking data let b s 2 be a ball containing then the isomorphism type of kh pl as defined in the introduction is a tangle invariant of pl s 2 b similarly to the proof of the main theorem in 8 we will accomplish this by way of a filtration on the instanton complex before introducing the filtration it will be useful to give a property of good lemma 2 13 for good in the fully resolved cube of resolutions if u v are two vertices such that is trivial at both of these vertices then there is a path from v to u that only goes through vertices at which is trivial moreover there is such a path of length v u 1 and for v u there is such a path v v 1 v 2 vk u proof consider going from the resolution of v to the resolution of u applying the following steps greedily 1 merge 2 split into pieces with a remaining crossing between them ie that will later be merged 3 split into pieces with no remaining crossing between them then it is easy to see that the sequence of moves must be of the form mm m m m m because after we do merges until we cannot do any more we have components with only crossings to themselves then if we do a type 2 split we immediately do a merge and we are again in a 22 situation where no crossings go between components this proceeds until we can no longer do 1 or 2 at which point there are only splits left now note that since we started and ended with trivial the initial merges and final splits all preserve this trivialness for the m s going from trivial configurations to trivial configu rations if we look at the cobordism capped off it is a torus and it is easy to see that if does not intertwine this torus there must be at least one crossing we can split at that does not make non trivial so we split at that crossing this completes the proof let us now define a filtration q on the complex associated to the cube of pseudo diagram res olutions we will consider in particular three types of cubes of pseudo diagram resolutions those that come from a projection for which we resolve all crossings those for which we resolve all but one crossing and those for which we resolve all but two adjacent opposite sign crossings our q is only defined for vertices of the cube at which is trivial at other vertices the group is 0 anyway so it does not matter what filtration we choose for a generator q corresponding to a critical point for the resolution at a vertex v define q a q a c v c 3 2 v o v o 1 where v u is defined below o is a globally chosen vertex of the cube so that the is trivial at that vertex remark there is a choice of o involved in the definition of q but this will not matter because the results we will extract from the q filtration will only require q to be defined up to a constant shift for the whole complex in this subsection as in the previous our maps are going from v to u with v u see remark 2 2 1 definition 2 14 let d be the set of dropped crossings let v u u v where v c d 2 sign c s c where sign c 1 and s c is 1 or 0 depending on the parity of the number of endpoints on each of the wings that c divides its component into if applicable that is s c 0 c does not divide one component into two components 0 each wing has an even number of endpoints 1 each wing has an odd number of endpoints where the first of the three cases is only possible when there are two dropped crossings and the picture looks like the middle picture in figure 11 in particular when there are no dropped crossings 0 note that for v corresponding to a configuration on the left hand side of figure 11 the possible values of are 0 2 and 4 for the middle column configurations they are 0 and 2 and for the configuration on the right they are 0 2 and 4 by construction v w v u u w 23 figure 11 this figure shows all possible configurations with two adjacent dropped crossings the picture on the left shows the pseudo diagram resolution in which both unresolved crossings are negative and the picture on the right has both unresolved crossings positive the column in the middle consists of pseudo diagram resolutions with one positive and one negative unresolved crossing the maps depicted are all of the possible lemma 2 15 for a cobordism from the pseudo diagram resolution at v to that at u with good v u 4 p 1 p x mod 8 moreover if n has one more dropped crossing than n ie n is all the crossings and n is all but one or n is all but one and n is all but two the one missing in n and another adjacent one of opposite sign consider the complex over z 0 1 n with vertical cobordisms as in 10 we can still define v u u v in this situation we still have 4 p 1 p x mod 8 proof let us show the second statement only the first follows we begin by showing it for vertical maps that is the one corresponding to the extra dropped crossing in n since both p 1 and v u are additive it suffices to show v u 4 p 1 p x mod 8 for cobordisms of length 1 or 2 with the ones of length 2 being from a split followed by a merge where the middle term is killed by if the cobordism is length 1 and is a merge or a split where neither the source nor the target is killed by the cobordism corresponds to splitting into parts each of which has an even number of endpoints of which does not affect the contribution to v for any unresolved crossing so v u 0 on the other hand the cobordism is a pair of pants which upon having ends capped off becomes a sphere for which 4 p 1 p x 0 mod 8 if the cobordism is length 1 and it is between two resolutions with the same number of unresolved crossings and the same number of components because we are looking at a vertical 24 map the number of unresolved crossings must be 1 so the cobordism is between a component with one negative crossing and a component with one positive crossing along with some cylinders for the other components if the cobordism goes from negative to positive then it is a rp 2 with ends by the compu tation in section 2 7 of 10 rp 2 has two possibilities for the singular bundle data in the non trivial case p 1 p x 12 mod 2 so 4 p 1 p x 2 note that the fact that is good means that it is not possible that s c 1 for the unresolved crossing in both the source and the target so the only possibilities are if in both s c 0 in which case v u 0 and 4 p 1 p x 0 mod 8 or if s c 1 on one of the sides and 0 on the other in which case v u 2 and 4 p 1 p x 2 mod 8 as desired similarly if the map goes from positive to negative then the cobordism is a twice punctured rp 2 and the same argument applies with the signs reversed if the cobordism is length 1 and preserves the number of components but changes the number of unresolved crossings let c be the crossing that is unresolved in exactly one of the source and the target then only c contributes to v u moreover if c is a positive unresolved crossing in the source or a negative one in the target then the cobordism is rp 2 and otherwise it is rp 2 moreover the singular bundle data is nontrivial if and only if s c 1 for the unresolved projection the computation is now similar to the previous case if the cobordism is length 2 by lemma 7 2 of 10 the composite cobordism s 20 s 10 s 21 is i s 3 v 20 s 4 rp 2 where v 20 is the reverse of s 32 the b 4 rp 2 in this decomposition is localised around c and the singular bundle data may be taken to be trivial there thus the calculation for this case is the same as that for the previous two cases but with signs reversed for horizontal maps we can use the vertical maps to translate the horizontal so that it is confined to the 0 1 mod 3 levels choosing the right one of the 0 or 1 mod 3 so that is still trivial and applying the fact that the lemma holds for no dropped crossings so all 0 to show that it holds for 1 dropped crossing and then use that it holds for one dropped crossing to show that it holds for 2 the main result of this subsection will be the use of the q filtration to extract the following proposition proposition 2 16 let cq be the category of q filtered finitely generated differential z 2 modules with differentials of order 0 whose morphisms are differential homomorphisms of order 0 up to chain homotopies of order 0 then the isomorphisms type of the instanton complex of pl b is a tangle invariant up to shift in q that is if a is the q filtered instanton complex corresponding to pl b and a is that corresponding to p l b where pl b and p l b represent the same tangle then a is isomorphic to a c in cq where a c denotes a with the filtration shifted by c from this we deduce that the isomorphism type of the pages of the spectral sequence cor responding to the q filtration are tangle invariants and then comparing the q filtration to the khovanov picture we will deduce theorem 2 12 we will now show that the differential on the instanton complex has order 0 with respect to the q filtration this is the analogue to proposition 4 6 in 8 25 lemma 2 17 consider a cube of pseudo diagram resolutions for a link projection that comes from one of the following a full resolution for a projection dropping all but one crossing or dropping all but two adjacent opposite sign crossings then the differentials on the corresponding instanton complex have order 0 with respect to the q filtration proof note that lemma 4 4 of 8 which states that the parity of the q filtration on the instanton complex is constant still applies is even and our q filtration differs from theirs by v o for an asd connection with value 0 at u and 1 at v we have that if there is a map 1 to u on svu then q 0 q 1 q 0 q 1 u v 3 2 v u v u 8 1 2 s s 1 u v 3 2 v u v u 8 1 u v v u v u the second equality above is from equation 6 in 8 which states that dim m s 1 0 8 s 1 2 s s q 1 q 0 where m s 1 0 is the moduli space of instantons on s from 1 to 0 and m s 1 0 is the part with action from the fact that the parity of q is constant we see that it suffices to show q 0 q 1 1 in other words it suffices to show that for v u 8 u v v u v u 0 if there are no dropped crossings then and vanish and the above statement follows from the non negativity of the action and the fact that the differential in the instanton complex is upper triangular that is the maps vanish unless v u note that these are the possible values of v for the one dropped crossing case the dropped crossing is negative v 0 2 the dropped crossing is positive v 2 0 thus for one dropped crossing the possible values of v u for a cobordism s from v to u are if s s 2 then v u 0 2 4 if s s 0 then v u 2 0 2 if s s 2 then v u 4 2 0 because s s 2 if the cobordism goes from a diagram with a positive dropped crossing to one with a negative dropped crossing s s 0 for positive to positive or negative to negative and s s 2 for negative to positive for the two dropped crossing picture the possible values of v are left hand side of figure 11 ie both crossings negative v 0 2 4 middle column of figure 11 ie one negative one positive crossing v 2 0 2 26 right hand side of figure 11 ie both crossings positive v 4 2 0 note that these are the possible values of v u if s s 4 then v u 0 2 8 if s s 2 then v u 2 0 6 if s s 0 then v u 4 2 4 if s s 2 then v u 6 4 2 if s s 4 then v u 8 6 0 for the differentials on the cube v u and 8 0 so if 0 we are done thus we may assume that 0 recall that by lemma 2 15 v u 4 p 1 p x mod 8 by proposition 2 7 of 10 1 4 p 1 p x 1 16 s s hence 8 2 mod 4 and it is easy to see in the above cases that 4 so 2 2 then if 8 2 by the mod 4 computation we would have to have 8 2 4 0 a contradiction thus 8 2 it therefore suffices to show that 2 v u note that if v u then 0 and the inequality is true so we may assume that v u 1 but 2 takes values 0 1 2 so we only need to show that for 2 2 we have v u 2 we do this by going through the cases if s s 4 then obviously you need to take at least two steps if s s 2 then to have 4 we must have 2 but if v u 1 then the map is an rp 2 and s s 2 means that it is specifically an rp 2 so 4 p 1 p x 2 mod 8 a contradiction similarly if s s 2 then to have 4 we must have 6 but if v u 1 then the map is an rp 2 and s s 2 means that it is an rp 2 so 4 p 1 p x 2 mod 8 a contradiction finally if s s 0 then to have 4 we must have 4 but if v u 1 then the map is a pair of pants so 0 mod 8 our approach to proving proposition 2 16 will be to show invariance of reidermeister moves performed away from a ball containing by way of showing that dropping two adjacent opposite sign crossings does not affect the isomorphism type in cq and then performing isotopies between different projections with crossings dropped observe that isotopies preserve the isomorphism type in cq as in the following lemma which is analogous to proposition 5 1 in 8 and has the same proof namely by considering maps tvu for v u coming from counting instantons on the trace of the isotopy from l to l and showing that the chain maps and homotopies preserve the q grading as in the previous lemma lemma 2 18 let l n and l n be pseudo diagram resolutions with either no crossings dropped one crossing dropped or two adjacent opposite sign crossings dropped and suppose that l and l are isotopic via an isotopy that is constant around n and then c pl n and c pl n are isomorphic as elements of cq up to overall shift in q we can also extend the complex beyond the cube to zn and it will be useful to note that when we extend the complex beyond the cube in one direction there is a certain 3 periodicity that is if kv and ku are the links corresponding to vertices v and u with 3 v u zn then kv ku 27 and the cv and cu can be identified via isomorphisms with h s 2 p where p is the number of components as in equation 2 of 8 the analogue of lemma 4 3 or 8 which states that the aforementioned isomorphism between cv and cu preserves the q filtration still holds in our setting because v and u are the same so if v v 3 0 0 0 then v u v u 2 and v u v u definition 2 19 consider the extended complex over z 0 1 n let the type of a cobordism denote v 0 u 0 lemma 2 20 consider n n where either n is all the crossings and n has one dropped crossing or n has one dropped crossing and n has another adjacent opposite crossing dropped let n n and index the crossings of n 0 1 n so that the 0 th one is the distinguished crossing dropped in n the differentials on the instanton complex over z 0 1 n where the 1 mod 3 pages corre spond to leaving the 0 th crossing unresolved of type at most 3 have order 0 with respect to the q filtration proof the proof of this is similar to the proof of lemma 2 17 first note that the parity of q on the extended complex is still constant by the same argument as before thus it again suffices to show 8 u v v u v u 0 this is again clear for 0 so we may assume 0 let the vertical part of a map on the cube be the z part and the horizontal part by the part on 0 1 n then for the horizontal part there is at most one crossing and we have per the above chart that h h 2 0 2 for the vertical part for a map of type 3 we have v 2 and v 2 so we still have 6 thus for 8 0 and 8 2 mod 4 we still have 8 2 it again suffices to show that 2 v u for maps of type 1 the chart in the proof of lemma 2 17 still holds to see this we need to understand the vertical cobordisms between the resolution where one of the crossings is dropped and the resolutions where it isn t in the case of pairs of pants and are both 0 otherwise the cobordism is between a loop and that loop with one extra crossing say of sign c as in all of the cases on the outer rim of figure 11 if there is an extra crossing in the picture we can ignore it when analysing the cobordism up to isotopy the cobordism is between a loop and that loop with one extra crossing say of sign c is isotopic to that between a loop of sign c and a loop with sign c thus for this case we also have 0 or so the values takes indexed by are still as in the chart in the proof of lemma 2 17 moreover then the same proof applies to show 2 v u for a map of type 2 let us find the possible values of for the vertical part ie the cobordism from v v 2 0 0 to v consider v v 1 0 0 then v v v v 2 and v v v v 0 moreover v v is a type 1 vertical cobordism so the possibilities for v v are 2 0 2 and the possibilities for v v are v v 0 the way the resolution works for the map v v which we recall goes between a loop and a loop with an extra crossing the map has to go from either no crossing to positive crossing or from negative crossing to no crossing unless it is a pair of pants thus v v can be 0 or 2 with v v 0 if v v 0 and v v 0 2 if v v 2 thus v v can be 2 or 0 with v v 0 if v v 2 and v v 2 0 if v v 0 either way v v takes values 0 2 from here the same argument as in lemma 2 17 works finally in the case of type 3 we have 2 and 0 and the same proof holds 28 let pl be a link projection and n be either the set of all crossings or the set of all but one crossing let n n be obtained by dropping one crossing in the case that n already has a dropped crossing we further require that the second dropped crossing be adjacent to the first with opposite sign we will call the pair n n of sets of crossings okay if it is one of the aforementioned two situations recall from 10 that in this situation the instanton complexes c pl n and c pl n are quasi isomorphic let us describe this quasi isomorphism let c n denote that crossing that is dropped in n note that we can decompose c pl n into the two parts based on the resolution of c as c pl n c 1 c 0 we may then consider the complex i zci then c pl n is isomorphic to c 1 and c 1 is homotopic to c pl n c 1 c 0 via maps f 1 1 f 0 1 c 1 c 0 c 1 and 2 f 2 1 f 2 0 c 2 c 1 c 0 1 f 1 2 f 1 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 where c 2 c 1 and the fij are the maps on the instanton complex ci to cj for the composite 2 c 2 c 1 it is shown in 10 that f 2 1 f 2 2 f 1 1 f 2 1 t 2 1 n 2 1 where t 2 1 is an isomorphism coming from cylindrical cobordisms and n 2 1 is chain homotopic to zero via a map h 2 1 which we will describe in more detail in the proof of the following lemma the other composite 1 is shown in 8 to be homotopic via chain homotopy l f 1 2 f 0 2 f 1 3 f 0 3 to a map t 1 2 n 1 2 0 y t 0 3 n 0 3 c 1 c 0 c 2 c 3 which is in turn homotopic via chain homotopy h 1 2 0 0 h 0 3 to a map t 1 2 0 x t 0 3 c 1 c 0 c 2 c 3 for a map x c 0 c 2 lemma 2 21 if pl is a link projection and n n is okay then the instanton complexes for pl n and pl n are isomorphic in cq up to an overall shift in the q filtration proof we would like to show that the morphisms and as well as all the homotopies in the above discussion have order 0 with respect to the q filtration note that and the chain homotopy l all come from differentials of type at most three on the chain complex which are shown in lemma 2 20 to have order 0 in the case of the map h 2 1 we write down the map from pages 106 107 of 10 for c 2 c 1 this map works like this consider w s which is obtained from w s by removing 29 b 2 1 m 2 1 where b 03 contains basically the three handles of the 0 th crossing and m 2 1 is the plumbing of two mo bius bands the boundary of m 2 1 is a two component unlink attach back in b 03 d 2 d 2 the two disks for going from 2 v to 1 u the cobordism is now s 2 v 2 u ie what it would be if we removed the part corresponding to the additionally dropped crossing consider the family of metrics where you move the crossings 1 n back and forth and also stretch along the boundary of b 03 and also don t quotient anything the dimension of this family is v u 1 1 and s v u 1 so q 0 q 1 8 s 1 2 s s dim g 8 1 2 s s 1 and q 0 q 1 q 0 q 1 u v 3 3 2 s 2 v 1 u s 2 v 1 u v u where v u is three periodic this 8 1 2 s s 1 u v 3 3 2 s 2 v 1 u s 2 v 1 u v u 8 1 2 s s 1 u v 3 2 s s v u 8 1 u v s s v u but this is better than what we had before thus h 2 1 also has order 0 thus we have that and are morphisms in cq and in this category 2 t 2 1 and 1 t 1 2 0 x t 0 3 and by lemma 2 18 the maps t 1 2 and t 0 3 which correspond to isotopies are isomorphisms in cq so t 1 2 0 x t 0 3 is also an isomorphism in cq this shows that c pl n c 1 in cq however c 1 and c pl n represent the same complex up to a constant shift in q thus c pl n and c pl n are isomorphic in cq as desired at this point we can prove proposition 2 16 proof of proposition 2 16 we would like to show that the cq type is a tangle invariant for this it suffices to show that reidermeister moves performed away from preserve the isomorphism type of the complex in cq this follows the proof of proposition 8 1 of 8 we compare the complexes c and c obtained from cubes of resolutions corresponding to projections p and p of a link that differ by a reidermeister move performed away from consider the complexes c and c arising from the cube of pseudodiagram resolutions obtained by dropping the one or two relevant crossing in c and c respectively aa consequence of lemma 2 21 c has the same cq type as c and c has the same cq type as c and by lemma 2 18 c and c have the same cq type completing the proof 30 using proposition 2 16 we now deduce theorem 2 12 proof of theorem 2 12 theorem 3 5 in chapter xi of 11 states that homotopy equivalences of order t induce isomorphisms of the er pages of the spectral sequences for r t moreover by proposition 2 16 if pl and p l represent the same tangle then there they are isomorphic in cq which means there is a homotopy equivalence between the up to overall shift in q combining these two results we see that the e 1 d 1 page of the instanton complex filtered by the q filtration up to overall shift in the q filtration is a tangle invariant by the definition of the spectral sequence as in 11 it is easy to see that the isomorphism type of the e 1 page is the same as the homology of the instanton complex with the differential replaced with the q 0 part of the differential i e the part of the differential that changes the q grading by 0 indeed e 1 p h fpa fp 1 a where we have adjusted theorem 3 5 in chapter xi of 11 because we are considering descending rather than ascending filtrations unpacking the definition for e 1 p of a filtered complex as in the definition given in theorem 3 1 of chapter xi of 11 e 1 p is the homology of the part of q grading p with the q grading 0 part of the differential in the fully resolved picture and both vanish and if 0 is at vertex u and 1 at vertex v and the coefficient of 0 in d 1 does not vanish then q 0 q 1 8 1 u v thus this piece of the differential has q order 0 if and only if v u 1 8 however 8 is non negative so this implies that the map is part of an edge map it now suffices to show that the edge maps all have q 0 however the edge maps are calculated in lemma 8 7 of 10 and it is easy to see that these have q 1 so that 0 and q 0 as desired 3 spectral sequence collapse in the previous section we defined a complex c pl for alternating link projections and we showed that its homology was an invariant of l and indeed independent of in 10 kronheimer and mrowka exhibited a spectral sequence for l whose e 1 d 1 page is the khovanov complex which abuts to i l they did this by exhibiting a spectral sequence for a link l with whose e 1 term is v 0 1 n i y lv which abuts to i y lw where w 2 2 2 so that lv goes through the 0 and 1 resolutions of a link l and lw is the unresolved link they then showed that for unlinks lv with n components in the situation where is empty i y lv is the group a n and that the maps d 1 agree with those in the khovanov complex it is easy to see that for general and lv an unlink i y lv agrees with c pl with d 1 also agreeing with the differential of c l this leads us to the following theorem 31 theorem 3 1 for an alternating link projection pl with singular bundle data there is a spectral sequence whose e 1 d 1 term is c pl which abuts to i y l in 10 kronheimer and mrowka also showed that for k an alternating knot the spectral sequence from khovanov homology to instanton homology collapses on the e 2 page this means that the khovanov homology and the instanton homology have the same rank for a alternating knot projection pk by corollary 2 9 for an alternating knot projection pk with the homology of c pk is the same as the khovanov homology of k this implies the following lemma 3 2 corollary 1 6 from 10 for an alternating knot projection k with marking data the spectral sequence from c pk to the instanton homology collapses on the e 2 page proof to avoid confusion let us spell out the reasoning of corollary 1 6 from 10 in 10 kron heimer and mrowka show that with z coefficients for any link l there is a spectral sequence with e 2 term the reduced khovanov homology khr l which abuts to the reduced instanton homol ogy i l they further showed that with q coefficients the reduced singular instanton homology i l q is isomorphic to the sutured floer homology khi l q they also showed in 9 that for a knot the rank of the sutured floer homology khi k q is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the alexander polynomial of k thus for quasi alternating knots k the rank of khi k q and therefore that of i k q is bounded below by the determinant of k in 12 manolescu and ozsva th showed that the rank of the khovanov homology for a quasi alternating link is equal to the determinant thus for quasi alternating knots the rank of i k q is equal to that of khr k q moreover it was shown in 12 that the reduced khovanov homology over z is a free z module thus in the instanton complex the e 2 page is a free z module and for the e page to have the same rank over q as the e 2 page which we just proved must hold the differentials on the e 2 page and beyond must vanish over z thus the spectral sequence collapses on the e 2 page over z and therefore over z 2 as desired let us now extend this result to alternating links theorem 3 3 for a non split alternating link projection pl with marking data the spectral sequence from c pl to the instanton homology collapses on the e 2 page corollary 3 4 for a non split alternating link l the rank of the instanton homology i l is independent of proof of corollary by theorem 3 3 the instanton homology of i l has the same rank as the homology of c pl the latter however has the same rank as the homology of c pl by corollary 2 10 which by theorem 3 3 also agrees with i l thus the homology of i l has the same rank as that of i l proof of theorem 3 3 in the course of this proof we are returning to the notation in subsection 2 1 where the maps go from the 0 resolution to the 1 resolution recall that for an n dimensional cube of resolutions we have associated c f let us start by describing this complex in doing so we will set up the notation for this section consider the cube of resolutions associated to the link projection for v a vertex of the cube let cv be a n or 0 where n is the number of components realised as i s 3 l v for u v 0 1 n with v u let the map fuv cu cv count instantons on the cobordism from lu to lv the cube c is defined to be c vcv and the maps on it are the fuv 32 here fvv 0 for reasons of degree and for v u 1 fuv is merge or split map as in khovanov homology when is trivial at the source and target we group the complex and differentials by khovanov cohomological degree that is for i 0 let ci denote v icv and for x c let i x denote the part of x in ci let fp denote i pci so that f is a descending filtration on c we start with the following lemma which reformulates what it means for the spectral sequence to collapse lemma 3 5 to say that the spectral sequence collapses on the e 2 page for a link projection singular bundle data pl is the same as saying that for any r 2 and x fp such that p 1 x p 2 x p r 1 x 0 then there is y fp 1 such that p 2 y p 3 y p r 1 y 0 and p ry p rx proof by the definition of the spectral sequence as in the proof of theorem 3 1 of chapter xi of 11 erp p x fp p i x 0 i r p x fp r 1 p r 1 i x 0 i r 1 where p is the projection fp fp fp 1 the spectral sequence differential dr erp erp r is the map induced by the lemma follows from unpacking the definition of dr we now show show that given that the spectral sequence collapses on the e 2 page for alternating knots it also collapses similarly for alternating links regardless of by induction on the number of components the base case is the statement that the spectral sequence collapses for alternating knots lemma 3 2 in this case since there is only one component is always trivial and therefore does not affect i l we have shown that it does not affect kh pl earlier assume that the claim holds for alternating links of l components consider link l with l 1 components let n be the number of crossings indexed 1 n consider some crossing k where the two strands are from different components this exists because l is not split without loss of generality let k 1 consider the alternating link l formed by taking l and adding another crossing right next to k between the same two strands as in figure 12 note that there are two ways to do this depending on which side you add the new crossing in one of these it will be the case that the 0 resolution of the new crossing in l is the same as l in the other it will be the 1 resolution of the crossing that gives l choose the former of the two figure 12 a depiction of adding a crossing for example the usual projection of the hopf link would be turned into a trefoil let the new crossing be indexed 0 that is the crossings of l are labelled by 0 1 2 where 0 is the new crossing and the others are the same as the corresponding crossing in l 33 figure 13 let c and c be the complexes for l and l respectively let vx and v x be the sets of vertices of degree x for l and l respectively see figure 13 the cube for l consists of a bottom cube that is a cube with 0 ie coordinate 0 in index 0 and a top cube 1 the bottom cube is isomorphic to l with the same edge and diagonal maps as in the following claim we can consider ci c i as the bottom cube but this inclusion is not a map of complexes observe that relative to the other crossings the 0 and 1 crossing on l look the same so that on l c 0 1 x 2 x 3 c 1 0 x 2 x 3 and d 0 0 x 2 x 3 0 1 x 2 x 3 d 0 0 x 2 x 3 1 0 x 2 x 3 respecting the above isomorphism for xi 0 1 claim in the cube for l for integers a b the maps f ab c a c b restricted to the cube for l seen as 0 in the cube for l ie restricted to ca cb it is the same as fab ca cb proof for u v vertices in the cube for l we wish to show that fuv f uv where the right hand side is obtained from viewing u v as vertices in the cube for l but recall that the maps fuv come from a moduli space over a family of metrics on a cobordism from the unlinks representing cu to the unlinks repsenting cv which we call lu and lv let l u and l v denote the unlinks for 0 u and 0 v as vertices in the cube for l 34 then the cobordism lu lv is isomorphic to the cobordism l u l v and the families of metrics and moduli spaces are also isomorphic the induced maps therefore agree consider the cube c as c 00 c 01 c 10 c 11 with d ij on each c ij for i j 0 1 with additional maps d i j i 1 j and di j i j 1 between parts so what we have is that c can be thought of as c 00 c 01 with d 00 d 01 and d 0 0 0 1 for differentials and c 01 d 01 c 10 d 10 see figure 14 figure 14 lemma 3 6 the map of khovanov complexes i e disregarding diagonal maps g c c given by considering g x y x y y 0 for x y c 00 c 01 c and x y y 0 c 00 c 01 c 10 c 11 c is a chain map on the marked khovanov complex as is the map in the other direction h x y z w x y the quotient map h is moreover a chain map on the instanton complex proof consider c c 00 c 01 where the first 0 in the index doesn t actually mean anything but is just to keep notation convenient and the 0 and 1 in the second index indicates the resolution of crossing 1 let d 00 and d 01 be the differentials on c 00 and c 01 respectively and d 0001 is the differential c 00 c 01 note that the differentials here do not include the diagonal maps on the cubes then we know that c 00 c 00 c 01 c 01 d 00 d 00 d 01 d 01 and d 0001 d 0001 moreover c 01 c 10 d 1011 d 0111 and d 0001 d 0010 for g to be a chain map we want d g x y g d x y where lhs d g x y d x y y 0 d 00 x d 0001 x d 01 y d 0010 x d 10 y d 0011 x d 1011 y d 0111 y d 00 x d 0001 x d 01 y d 0001 x d 01 y 0 because we are over a ring of characteristic two and because d 1011 d 0111 d 0001 d 0010 and d 01 d 10 35 on the other hand rhs g d x y g d 00 x d 0001 x d 01 y d 00 x d 0001 x d 01 y d 0001 x d 01 y 0 lhs as desired the proof for h is similar the fact that h is a chain map on the instanton complex follows from the fact that it is a quotient by c c 10 c 11 and the latter is a sub complex for both khovanov and instanton differentials the diagonal maps on c and c can be chosen to agree with those on c by choosing auxiliary data such as perturbations for the cobordisms in c and letting c and c inherit these data from c to summarise we now have a sequence c i c h g c dkh di c where i is the inclusion of the upper cube c into the larger cube c which is a chain map for both dkh and di and h is the map described above projecting to the lower cube also a chain map for both dkh and di thus c can be seen as the mapping cone for the map c c for either the khovanov or the instanton differentials the map g is a splitting of the mapping cone for the khovanov differential lemma 3 7 consider a filtered complex c viewed as a filtered mapping cone of di c c such that there is a splitting g of the projection h on the e 1 page so that c c c fit into c i c h g c di c then if the spectral sequence for c d i collapses on the e 1 page then the same holds for c di proof we wish to show that for r 2 and x fpc such that p 1 x p 2 x p r 1 x 0 then there is y fp 1 c such that p 2 y p r 1 y 0 and p ry p rx let x fpc be such that p ix 0 for i r because p 1 x 0 fp 1 c fp 2 c applying the above lemma we have p 1 g x 0 fp 1 c fp 2 c here the differentials d and d 1 agree because when considering p 1 on fp only the d 1 maps come into the picture by the assumption of spectral sequence collapse on l there is y p 1 fp 1 c such that p 2 g x p 2 y p 1 fp 2 c fp 3 c consider g x y p 1 we have p 1 g x y p 1 0 and p 2 g x y p 1 0 so applying spectral sequence collapse again we get that there is y p 2 fp 2 c with p 3 g xp y p 1 y p 2 0 iterating we get that for any r there is y y p 1 y p r 1 fp 1 c such that p i g x y 0 for i r for x h y in c we have h y fp 1 c and p i xp h y 0 for i r by applying h to the statement p i g x y 0 for i r and using that h is a chain map for both d and d 1 let y h y fp 1 c then p i y p i h y p i x for i r as desired theorem 3 3 now follows from the above lemma 36 4 binary dihedral representations in this section we study the effect of on binary dihedral representations r l and rb l for a link l with as defined in the introduction to understand these representations let us consider a projection for the link along with drawn in two dimensions and let us consider arcs in the projection meaning continuous pieces of the drawing where two adjacent arcs are either separated by something passing over the gap between them or by an endpoint of let us label the arcs of the projection ai j with 1 j ji where i indexes the component number j indexes the arc number on a certain component and ji is the number of arcs on component i without loss of generality let us choose a labelling for the arcs such that ai 1 ai 2 ai ji go along component i in counter clockwise order let bi j denote the arcs of components of labelled similarly the index j in ai j will be taken mod ji however on bi j the indices are not modulo anything lemma 4 1 the dependence of the spaces r l and rb l can be reduced to dependence on the parity of the number of endpoints of on each component proof let xi j and yi j denote the meridians around ai j and bi j respectively then representations in r l are given by the images of xi j which we denote i j in the binary dihedral group n with constraints i j i j i j i j 1 when ai j passes between arcs ai j and ai j 1 i j 1 i j 1 1 when there is an endpoint of separating ai j and ai j 1 and i j 1 1 i j 1 where some arc bi j passes between arcs ai j and ai j 1 the last constraint would be the same if we had pass under instead of over the part of l because it just says i j i j 1 and if passed under instead of over we would have only one ai j instead of having split it into ai j and ai j 1 which would have the same effect this shows that r l only depends on the endpoints it remains to show that r l only depends on the parity of the number of endpoints of on each component it is clear that if there are two endpoints of on the same arc ai j then we can cancel them it now suffices to show that dragging an endpoint of across a crossing of the link does not affect r l suppose there is an endpoint of separating ai j and ai j 1 then the relations involving i j and i j 1 are i j 1 i j i j i j and i j 1 i j i j i j 2 but i j 1 i j because ai j and ai j 1 are separated by an endpoint of so we could just eliminate i j 1 and write the relations as i j 1 i j i j i j and i j i j i j i j 2 in this setting we can instead look at the picture as having some marked crossings on each component and having ij with crossing relations i j 1 i j i j i j at normal crossings and 37 i j 1 i j i j i j at marked crossings and we are saying that moving the markings around along aij for fixed i does not affect the representation but moving a marked crossing from being between ai j and ai j 1 to being between ai j 1 and ai j 2 is like flipping the sign of i j 1 which is just a renaming and has no effect on r l as desired in the course of showing that lemma we exhibited a different way to label arcs which we will now adopt consider aij the arcs of l now only considered to be separated if something in l passes over that is we are ignoring in this picture for each component of l that has an odd number of endpoints of we consider one of the crossings for which that component is the underbranch to be marked and we have that r l is given by ij bd with relations i j i j i j i j 1 for an unmarked crossing of ai j passing over li separating i j and i j 1 and i j i j i j i j 1 if the crossing in question is marked the relations for crossings shows that if two arcs belong to the same component their images are conjugate to each other note that in bd elements of s 1 b can only be conjugate to other elements of s 1 b and the same for s 1 a so each component maps entirely to one of s 1 a and s 1 b 4 1 concerning rb l we restrict our attention to rb l i e the conjugacy classes of representations that take merid ians of the link to s 1 b note that for x cos x j sin x k and y cos y j sin y k we have y 1 xy cos 2 y x j sin 2 y x k thus x 1 y y x 2 for xi cos xi j sin xi k means x 1 x 2 2 y modulo 2 moreover for x cos x j sin x k the quaternion x corresponds to angle x now changing notation we can think of arc xi j as mapping to angle i j r 2 z and the relations are i j i j 1 2 i j for an unmarked crossing and i j i j 1 2 i j for a marked crossing we can represent this as m v where m is a matrix with coefficients 0 1 or 2 is a vector whose entries are i j and v is a vector with coefficients 0 or with the corresponding to marked crossings let us describe m more explicitly the rows of m correspond to crossings and the columns to arcs for each crossing its row has a 1 for each of the two arcs that end there a 2 for the arc that goes over and 0 s elsewhere the reason the entries could be 1 or 2 is that it is possible that some of the three arcs described could coincide in which case the 1 s or 2 s add representations in rb l now correspond to solutions to m v note that conjugating a representation shifts all entries of by a constant thus conjugacy classes can be seen as vectors r 2 z n with n 0 with m v 38 note that if v 0 that corresponds to being trivial moreover if there is any solution to m v with n 0 then the number of such solutions is the same as the number of solutions to m 0 with n 0 because given one solution to the former other solutions are obtained by translation by solutions of the latter we immediately deduce the following lemma 4 2 for any link l either rb l rb l or rb l of course rb l cannot be empty because the 0 is a solution to m 0 with n 0 so the two cases described in the lemma are mutually exclusive note that if l l 1 l 2 is a split link and l 1 is an unknot with an endpoint of then rb l 0 because the equation for it is i i mod 2 if l 1 is an unknot with no endpoints of then it does not add any interesting structure to rb l 1 l 2 for the rest of this section we will only consider links that do not have a split unknot component if there is a component without any crossings in which it is the underbranch then it is clearly a split unknot component thus we may assume that every component has at least one crossing this implies that on each component the number of crossings is equal to the number of arcs after all every arc has two endpoints as long as it is not a whole component and every crossing has two endpoints on it thus the matrix m is square we may also rearrange m so that columns 1 a 1 correspond to arcs of the first component going in some direction along the component columns a 1 1 a 2 correspond to the arcs of the second component etc we may also arrange so that rows 1 a 1 correspond to the crossings that separate arcs 1 2 2 3 a 1 1 and rows a 1 1 a 2 similarly correspond to crossings separating arcs of component 2 note that this means that the diagonal of the matrix has all entries 1 or 2 let m denote the matrix obtained by deleting the nth row and the nth column of m it is easy to see that the rank of m is at least the rank of m moreover the determinant of m is the same as the determinant of the link this could be taken to be a definition of the determinant cf 13 page 79 80 we can now show the following theorem theorem 4 3 if l is a link with det l 6 0 then rb l is independent of proof as mentioned in the preamble to this theorem the determinant of l is the determinant of m so since the determinant is non zero m has rank n 1 so m has rank at least n 1 we wish to show that v is in the image of m r 2 z n r 2 z n recall that the entries of v correspond to crossings we have grouped them by the component of the underbranch the entries of v are for some crossings and otherwise zero where there is at most one entry that is for each component to understand the image of m in r 2 z n we analyse the image of m in rn note that im m ker mt rn where ker mt denotes the orthogonal complement of the kernel of the transpose of m since m has rank at least n 1 to describe ker mt it suffices to find one vector in ker mt consider the vector u with entries 1 where the sign is the sign of the crossing where vectors in the domain of mt are thought to be indexed by crossings we would like to show that mtu 0 rows of mt correspond to arcs with entries 1 for each of the two counted with multiplicity crossings in which the arc is an under branch and 2 for each crossings for which the arc is the over branch thus on each arc label the crossings c 1 c 2 ck where c 1 and ck are the crossings at the ends and are allowed to coincide here when we count the crossings of an arc we are including 39 both the crossings at the end where the arc is the underbranch and the crossings in the middle where the arc is the overbranch it is easy to see that with this definition each arc must involve at least two crossings then the crossings c 2 c 3 ck 1 alternate signs crossings c 1 and c 2 have the same sign and crossings ck 1 and ck have the same sign it is now easy to see that uc 1 2 uc 2 uc 3 uck 1 uck 0 by checking in the two cases arising from the parity of k thus the u we constructed is in ker mt so the image of m is the orthogonal complement of u at this point to show that v r 2 z n is in the image of m it suffices to show that there is some representative of it in rn which is orthogonal to u some representatives of v are 0 0 0 0 0 0 where there are an even number of entries that are and we are allowed to choose the signs it is easy to see that we can choose signs so that v u 0 r because all of the entries of u are 1 so we can choose the signs in v to make the s cancel this theorem implies that for quasi alternating links rb l is independent of moreover from the proof of it we see that the signed sum of each column of m is zero we already know that the sum of each row is zero because each row has two 1 s and a 2 with multiplicity hence deleting a column and then deleting a row do not change the rank of m and we deduce that the rank of m is equal to the rank of m we will use this to show the following partial converse to the above theorem theorem 4 4 let l be a two component link with det l 0 then for going between the two components rb l proof it suffices to show that there is an element u ker mt such that no representative of v in rn can be orthogonal to u note that v 0 0 0 0 0 0 r 2 z n where the non zero entries are in crossings from different components thus the representatives of v are of the form 2 a 1 2 a 2 2 ak 1 2 ak 2 ak 1 with ai z it then suffices to find u ker mt zn rn such that the entries of u are even on one component and odd on the other with that by a parity argument we could see that u cannot be orthogonal to any representative of v since det m 0 the rank of m and therefore the rank of m is at most n 2 that is the kernel of mt has rank at least 2 consider the exact sequence 0 k zn m t zn c 0 where k is the kernel and c is the cokernel of mt we know that k has rank at least 2 however k being a submodule of zn is a free z module so this sequence is a projective resolution of c thus the homology groups of 0 k z 2 z 2 z n m t z 2 z n 0 compute the torz z 2 c where the homology at k z 2 is torz 2 z 2 c note that z has global dimension 1 so torz 2 z 2 c 0 thus k z 2 z 2 z n in the above sequence is injective and indeed is an injection into the kernel of mt however mt consists of two diagonal blocks that look like 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 40 where one block corresponds to each component of the link so it is easy to see that its kernel has rank 2 with kernel generated by 1 1 1 0 0 0 and 0 0 0 1 1 1 ie vectors that are 1 on one component and 0 on the other thus the injectivity of the map k z 2 z 2 z n implies that it is an isomorphism to the kernel of mt in z 2 z n however the map comes from looking at generators of k zn modulo 2 so we get that looking at k modulo 2 in z 2 z n we get span 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 z 2 z n consequently some element of k must be odd on one component and even on the other as desired when l has more than two components and det l 0 there could be situations where rb l is the same as rb l for going between some components but rb l is empty for other for example consider the link in figure 15 if we consider only the black blue and green components ignoring the red component we get a three component link for this link between the blue and black components and between the blue and green components have rb l whereas for between black and green components rb l is not empty however we consider only the black blue and red components ignoring the green component we get a three component link for which if goes between any two components we get rb l figure 15 the question of whether has rb l or rb l rb l relates to the question of whether the corresponding elements of ker mt over z 2 z we constructed in the proof above lift to elements of ker mt over z references 1 john a baldwin and adam simon levine a combinatorial spanning tree model for knot floer homology advances in mathematics
