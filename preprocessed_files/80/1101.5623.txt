gujrati department of physics department of polymer science the university of akron akron oh 44325 january 24 2011 abstract we use rigorous non equilibrium thermodynamic arguments to prove i the residual entropy of any system is bounded below by the experimentally calorimetrically determined absolute tem perature entropy which itself is bounded below by the entropy of the corresponding equilibrium metastable supercooled liquid state and ii the instantaneous entropy cannot drop below that of the equilibrium state the theorems follow from the second law and the existence of internal equilibrium and refer to the thermodynamic entropy they go beyond the calorimetric observa tions by johari and khouri j chem phys 134 034515 2011 and others by extending them to all non equilibrium systems regardless of how far they are from their equilibrium states we also discuss the statistical interpretation of the thermodynamic entropy and show that the con ventional gibbs or boltzmann interpretation gives the correct thermodynamic entropy even for a single sample regardless of the duration of measurements 1 http arxiv org abs 1101 5623 v 2 i introduction in a recent publication johari and khouri 1 used upper and lower bounds on the isobaric entropy s t 0 of a glass as a function of the temperature t 0 of the surrounding medium obtained by using the measured heat capacity during cooling and heating to argue for the reality of the residual entropy sr as the latter has become a highly debated issue in the literature 2 11 for a brief review of the history of the residual entropy and the current controversy we refer the reader to goldstein 9 gutzow and schmelzer 12 nemilov 13 and the recent reviews 14 15 by us see also below the existence of a non zero residual entropy sr 0 is very common in nature and does not violate nernst s postulate as the latter is applicable only to equilibrium states with a non degenerate ground state see sect 64 in landau and lifshitz 16 its existence was first theoretically demonstrated by pauling and tolman 17 see also tolman 18 in addition the existence of the residual entropy has been demonstrated rigorously for a very general spin model by chow and wu 19 the residual entropy for glycerol was observed by gibson and giauque 20 and for ice by giauque and ashley 21 pauling 22 provided the first numerical estimate for the residual entropy for ice which was later improved by nagle 23 nagle s numerical estimate has been recently verified by simulation 24 25 the numerical simulation carried out by bowles and speedy 26 for glassy dimers also supports the existence of a residual entropy richet 27 uses the adam gibbs theory to justify the residual entropy thus it appears that the support in favor of the residual entropy is quite strong we wish to emphasize that what is customarily called the third law due to nernst according to which the entropy must vanish at absolute zero is merely a postulate and not a strict theorem even in equilibrium 16 28 29 indeed many exactly solved statistical mechanical models show a non zero entropy at absolute zero however as of yet no experiment can be performed at absolute zero to demonstrate the residual entropy in all cases some sort of extrapolation is required this point should not be forgotten in the following whenever we speak of measuring the residual entropy in addition we will speak of the equilibrium state associated with a non equilibrium state depending on the context the equilibrium state may represent a true equilibrium state such as a crystal or a time independent metastable state such as the supercooled liquid however for the purpose of clarity we will consider the supercooled liquid in the following but the arguments are applicable to both cases 2 a controversy and its current status it is surprising to see this controversy persist in the current literature even though it seemed resolved a long time ago 17 18 we also note somewhat recent attempts 30 31 the con troversial issue is the following as the irreversibility does not allow for an exact evaluation of the entropy is it possible for the entropy to decrease by an amount almost equal to sr within the glass transition region so that the glass see glass 2 in fig 1 would have a van ishing entropy at absolute zero the entropy for glass 2 follows from the recent proposals by kivelson and reiss 7 and by gupta and mauro 8 10 32 see also reiss 33 gupta and mauro 32 conclude that s sscl 1 at and below the glass transition in conformity with glass 2 they actually state the above inequality at the glass transition in eq 10 of the above paper but then take it to be also valid below the transition their conclusion is based on the fact that g gscl for the gibbs free energies and the equality h hscl of the enthalpy at the glass transition here s g and h refer to the glass and sscl gscl and hscl refer to the supercooled liquid the equality h hscl is widely accepted as an experimental fact in the field 34 36 the motivation for their proposal is their understanding 7 8 10 32 33 that the entropy of a single sample of glass at absolute zero must be zero as the microstate of the sample will not change no matter how long the glass is observed thus according to this view the entropy is not merely less than that of glass 1 such as glass 3 it must be strictly less than or equal to sscl the alternative shown as glass 3 s sglass 1 sscl 2 is not consistent with this view 32 according to eq 1 the entropy of a glass can only increase during relaxation as the glass strives to equilibrate at any temperature below the glass transition what could be wrong with such a simple deduction which does not require any sophisticated mathematics gutzow and schmelzer 12 see the discussion following their eq 39 also come to the same conclusion on the other hand the common view of the glass is shown by glass 1 in fig 1 with the clear implication that the entropy of the glass is higher than that of the supercooled liquid there is at present no consensus as is evident from the discussion reported in the proceedings 2 and the general conclusion drawn by goldstein 9 that the abrupt entropy loss 3 t 0 s t 0 g glass supercooled liquid relaxation t 0 g transition region glass 2 t tobs glass 3 fig 1 schematic behavior of the entropy equilibrated supercooled liquid solid curve without any relaxation and three possible glasses glass 1 dotted curve glass 2 dashed curve glass 3 dash dotted curve during vitrification as a function of the temperature t 0 of the medium structures appear to freeze over an extremely long period of time at and below t 0 g see text the transition region between t 0 g and t 0 g over which the liquid turns into a glass has been exaggerated to high light the point that the glass transition is not a sharp point for t 0 t 0 g the non equilibrium state undergoes isothermal structural relaxation in time towards the supercooled liquid for glass 1 the two vertical downward arrows show isothermal structural relaxation at two different temperatures during which the entropy decreases the same will also happen for glass 3 for glass 2 the en tropy increases during isothermal structural relaxation see the upward arrow the instantaneous temperature t t of the glass decreases towards the t 0 during relaxation so that the entropy is a function of t t during relaxation the entropy of the supercooled liquid is shown to extrapolate to zero per our assumption but that of glass 1 to a non zero value and of glass 2 to zero at absolute zero the entropy of glass 3 may or may not vanish at absolute the possibility of an ideal glass transition which does not affect our conclusion will result in a singular form of the solid curve the second law is used to support glass 1 and rule out glass 2 see the text comparable to sr as proposed by kivelson and reiss 7 33 will result in the construction of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind goldstein merely follows the consequence of the existence of a possible reversible connection between a glass and the supercooled liquid as 4 proposed by kivelson and reiss in view of the simple observation in eq 1 one can argue that the general demonstration by goldstein is either inapplicable to a glass or that the basic premise of a possible existence of a reversible connection between a glass and the supercooled liquid using kivelson reiss construction must be invalid indeed gupta and mauro 8 10 argue that the second law does not apply to the glass transition proposed by them as the loss of entropy in their formulation does not result in a latent heat while goldstein s general demonstration noted above depends crucially on this heat and therefore does not invalidate the proposal of a discontinuous loss by gupta and mauro although it does invalidate the proposal by kivelson and reiss one can also argue that the special electrode construction proposed by kivelson and reiss and used by goldstein requires microscopic information to confine the system into a unique basin a configurational microstate in that one needs to know precisely where each particle of the system is located within a certain small volume cell associated with its possible vibrations 37 38 see gujrati 15 for elaboration on microstate measurements oppenheim 39 has also raised somewhat of a similar objection in addition it is not obvious that thermodynamics which is a description of a macrostate can be applicable to a microstate such as the one obtained by the above special construction mauro et al 2 also consider a glass formed by continuous cooling such as glass 2 in which the entropy is lost continuously it should be noted that goldstein 9 40 does not explicitly discuss continuous cooling however in a private discussion goldstein has pointed out that his demonstration based on solubility also covers continuous cooling the amount of loss in this case is not going to be close to sr therefore goldstein s argument will not only invalidate glass 2 but also glass 3 despite all these attempts the situation remains confusing in part because to quote goldstein 40 as the residual entropies found by calorimetric measurements either equal or at least do not exceed the calculated value it is generally though not unanimously accepted that the residual entropies are real thus in these cases as already pointed out by bestul and chang 41 one cannot demonstrate whether the residual entropy differs from zero of course the attempts so far by those who believe in the residual entropy 1 3 12 13 31 have been only to demonstrate that the residual entropy is approximately equal to the calculated value to be denoted here by sexpt t 0 within a few percentages however as they do not deal directly with sscl they have not ruled out the inequality in eq 1 even though no experiments have revealed a situation in which sexpt t 0 lies below 5 sscl t 0 over the temperature range where the latter has been experimentally determined the above calorimetric studies make no claim that sexpt t 0 sscl t 0 3 for all temperatures below the glass transition even though many workers believe it to be intuitively true in light of eq 1 however t is possible that the above inequality turns out to be incorrect the contribution of goldstein 9 only proves that an abrupt or a continuous loss of a part of the residual entropy s sglass 1 cannot be valid but it neither rules out zero residual entropy nor the inequality in eq 1 it also says nothing about the above inequality is it possible that the demonstration of s sscl itself is invalid however we cannot find any discussion of it in the current literature thus it is not surprising that the controversy still persists goldstein 9 has suggested that the entropy loss proposal may be impossible to verify by any conceivable experiment thus leaving the possibility that some theoretical approach such as the one to be taken here may resolve the issue a theoretical approach will also allow us to investigate the inequalties in eqs 1 3 at absolute zero where experiments cannot be performed b clausius limits johari and khouri 1 have analyzed data from a large number of glasses to draw the con clusion that a non zero residual entropy is real in the cases they have analyzed the idea behind their discussion is simple the bounds called the clausius limits 1 on the thermody namic entropy reflect the contributions of irreversibility in the experimentally determined estimate sexpt t 0 of the entropy s t 0 they find that the two bounds are so tight in most cases less than 2 that one can neglect the corrections to the calorimetrically determined sexpt t 0 due to irreversibility along cooling and heating paths a conclusion arrived at by several others 1 3 12 14 it appears that this approach was first used by bestul and chang 41 and later by sethna and coworkers 31 johari and khouri finally conclude that the exper imental evidence of a non zero residual entropy see glass 1 in fig 1 is beyond reproach for the systems they have analyzed the implication of their contribution and of several others mentioned above 3 12 13 31 is that there is no thermodynamic reason such as the third law for the residual entropy to be zero a conclusion well known in theoretical physics 16 6 we should mention at this point that if there is ever any conflict between the second law 42 and any other law in physics such as the zeroth or the third law for a macroscopic body it is the second law that is believed to hold in all cases this suggests that glass 2 does not materialize for the systems considered by johari and khouri 1 c importance of bounds we wish to prove in this work that glass 2 cannot materialize for any system as far as glass 3 is concerned we will establish that it may represent an approximation for glass 1 but cannot represent a real glass therefore we will mostly consider glass 1 and glass 2 in the following to fulfill this goal we have to go beyond the calorimetric evidence 1 3 12 13 for the residual entropy we treat the two glasses in fig 1 basically as two separate proposals for the general behavior of glasses therefore they need to be demonstrated to be valid or invalid in all cases without a single exception to obtain such a general result we must not make any assumptions or approximations the latter would mean that the conclusion could not be valid in all cases see below we must also not rely upon heuristic or intuitive arguments as part of the proof as the exact values of the entropy require detailed information about the system it in not feasible to find the two entropies exactly for all systems thus we will not be interested in system specific knowledge rather we want mathematically sound conclusions about the entropy that will be valid for all glass formers without exception because the controversy is between two inequalities any approximation would turn the strict inequality such as s sscl into s approx sscl in that case we may have s ssclin some cases depending on how far s is from sapprox unfortunately various discussions 1 3 12 13 in favor of the residual entropy and the specific critique by goldstein 9 using solubility either use approximations such as replacing the inequality in eq 9 below by an equality or are phenomenological with a limited domain of validity indeed gutzow and schmelzer 12 have come to the conclusion see above eq 40 there that in any real process the entropy either remains constant or increases the conclusion is in accordance with eq 1 thus the current status of the field leaves open the possibility that the residual entropy could vanish it is abundantly clear from the above discussion that there is a need to look at the issue of residual entropy once again in our opinion the real issue is the inequality in eq 1 whose validity has not been scrutinized in the literature if the bound is jusitified it automatically 7 proves that sr is not real if on the other hand the bound is not justified it does not automatically prove that sr is real we then have the additional task to prove its reality as is customary we treat the supercooled liquid as an equilibrium state even though it not a true equilibrium state see above we proceed by following the strict second law inequality dis 0 in eq 8 and use it along with the existence of internal equilibrium 43 for theorem 2 to prove the following two theorems applicable to all non equilibrium systems regardless of how close or far they are from their equilibrium state theorem 1 the experimentally observed non zero entropy at absolute zero in a vitrification process is a strict lower bound of the residual entropy of any system sr s 0 sexpt 0 sscl 0 4 theorem 2 any drop of the glass entropy below that of the supercooled liquid such as glass 2 in fig 1 is a violation of the second law 42 thus s sscl 5 so that the entropy variation in time has a unique direction as shown by the downward arrows in fig 1 our conclusion in eq 5 is in contradiction with that in eq 1 therefore we need to understand the reason for this discrepancy all experiments on or exact approximate computations for non equilibrium systems must obey the strict inequalities in eqs 4 5 without any exception this is the meaning behind the usage of rigorous in the title of the paper the actual values of the entropy are not relevant for the aim of this work which is to settle the controversy between glass 1 and glass 2 under vitrification and the way their entropies relate to that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid because of the possibility that the systems may be far away from equilibrium where the irreversible contributions may not be neglected our results go beyond the previous calorimetric evidence 1 3 12 13 the systems we are interested in include glasses and imperfect crystals as special cases however to be specific we will only consider glasses below the discussion is valid for all non equilibrium systems we hope that the proofs of the above two theorems settle the controversy between the two forms of glasses and about the residual entropy sr 8 we first consider the behavior of the thermodynamic entropy that appears in classical non equilibrium thermodynamics as is well known this entropy is governed by the second law 42 in the next section we prove theorem 1 in the following section we prove theorem 2 both sections deal with the thermodynamic entropy in sect iv we explain how the thermodynamic residual entropy can be understood in terms probability of a microstate and how even a single sample can give a highly reliable result for the residual entropy the last section contains our conclusions ii forward entropy bound during vitrification theorem 1 the process we consider is carried out at some cooling rate as follows the temperature of the medium is isobarically changed by some small but fixed t 0 from the current value to the new value and we wait for not necessarily fixed time obs at the new temperature to make an instantaneous measurement on the system before changing the temperature again at some temperature t 0 g see fig 1 the relaxation time relax which continuously increases as the temperature is lowered becomes equal to obs just below t 0 g the structures are not yet frozen they freeze at a lower temperature t 0 g not too far from t 0 g to form an amorphous solid with a viscosity close to 1013 poise this solid is identified as a glass the location of both temperatures depends on the rate of cooling i e on obs over the glass transition region between t 0 g and t 0 g shown in fig 1 the non equilibrium liquid gradually turns from an equilibrium supercooled liquid at or above t 0 g into a glass at or below t 0 g a picture already known since tammann 34 over this region some dynamical properties such as the viscosity vary continuously but very rapidly however thermodynamic quantities such as the volume or the enthalpy change continuously but slowly as the observation time obs is increased the equilibrated supercooled liquid continues to lower temperatures before the appearance of t 0 g in the hypothetical limit obs it is believed that the equilibrated supercooled liquid will continue to lower temperatures without any interruption and is shown schematically by the solid blue curve in fig 1 we overlook the possibility of the supercooled liquid ending in a spinodal 44 it is commonly believed that this entropy will vanish at absolute zero sscl 0 0 as shown in the figure as we are going to be interested in sscl t 0 over 0 t 0 g we must also acknowledge the possibility of an ideal glass transition in the system if one believes in an ideal glass transition then there would be a 9 singularity in sscl t 0 at some positive temperature tk t 0 g below which the system will turn into an ideal glass whose entropy will also vanish at absolute zero 34 the possibility of an ideal glass transition which has been discussed in a recent review elsewhere 38 will not be discussed further in this work all that will be relevant in our discussion here is the fact that the entropy vanishes in both situations sscl 0 0 however it should be emphasized that the actual value of sscl 0 has no relevance for the theorems it is a common practice to think of the glass transition to occur at a point that lies between t 0 g and t 0 g gupta and mauro 32 consider the glass transition to occur at t 0 g to obtain the bound in eq 1 we will not make this assumption in this work except when we discuss their inequality later we have drawn the two entropy curves glass 1 or glass 2 in fig 1 that emerge out of sscl t 0 for a given obs in such a way that glass 1 has its entropy above so that sr 0 and glass 2 below so that sr 0 that of the supercooled liquid the entropy of glass 1 glass 2 approaches that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid entropy from above below during isothermal fixed temperature of the medium relaxation see the two downward vertical arrows for glass 1 it is the approach to equilibrium that distinguishes the two glasses glass 1 and glass 2 although johari and khouri do not mention in their conclusion their analysis of tight bounds also shows that the entropy does not drop by an amount close to sr within the glass transition region for the systems studied by them however because of the involved approximation it sheds no light on whether the glass entropy lies above or below the corresponding sscl t 0 thus their work and many others leave open the possibility that glass 2 may materialize if the irreversibility is too large this again shows why obtaining a bound is so important even if we do not determine the actual entropy values the concept of internal equilibrium 43 45 for a non equilibrium system means that its instantaneous entropy is a state function of its instantaneous state variables like energy volume etc and any internal variables 43 45 48 used to specify its state their usage is also a common practice 34 35 now a days for glasses employing internal equilibrium gives rise to an instantaneous gibbs fundamental relation see eq 14 below which determines its instantaneous temperature pressure etc we now prove theorem 1 consider an isobaric process we will not explicitly exhibit the pressure in this section from some state a at temperature t 0 in the supercooled liquid state which is still higher than t 0 g to the state a 0 at absolute zero the state a 0 depends 10 on the path a a 0 along with t 0 0 which is implicit in the following we have along a a 0 s 0 s t 0 a 0 a des a 0 a dis 6 where we have assumed that there is no latent heat in the vitrification process and where 43 45 48 ds des dis each of which for a non equilibrium system is path depen dent the component des t dq t t 0 cpdt 0 t 0 7 represents the reversible entropy exchange with the medium in terms of the heat dq t given out by the glass at time t to the medium whose temperature at that instant is t 0 the component dis 0 represents the irreversible entropy generation in the irreversible process in general the irreversible term dis 0 8 contains in addition to the contribution from the irreversible heat transfer with the medium contributions from all sorts of viscous dissipation going on within the system and normally require the use of internal variables 43 45 48 thus eq 6 contains all possible sources of entropy variations 43 45 48 this is easily proven by considering the system and the medium as an isolated system 43 45 and expressing the entropies as functions of the instantaneous values of the observables and internal variables a discontinuous change in the entropy is ruled out from the continuity of the gibbs free energy g and the enthalpy h in vitrification proved elsewhere 43 thus we only consider a continuous change in the entropy as shown by the two glass curves in fig 1 the equality in eq 8 holds for a reversible process which we will no longer consider unless stated otherwise the strict inequality dis 0 occurs only for irreversible process such as in a glass since the second integral in eq 6 is always positive and since the residual entropy sr is by definition the entropy s 0 at absolute zero we obtain the important result sr s 0 sexpt 0 s t 0 0 t 0 cpdt 0 t 0 9 this confirms the expectation noted above that the irreversibility during vitrification does not allow for the determination of the entropy exactly because determining the second inte gral in eq 6 is not trivial especially if internal variables are not considered 34 45 the for ward inequality is due to the irreversible entropy generation from all possible sources 43 45 48 11 that seems to not have been recognized by the proponents 7 8 10 32 33 of vanishing sr this strict forward inequality clearly establishes that the residual entropy at absolute zero must be strictly larger than sexpt 0 in any non equilibrium process this proves the first inequality in eq 4 we now prove the second inequality in eq 4 we consider processes that occur when obs relax t 0 let q t dq t dt be the rate of net heat loss by the system then for each temperature interval dt 0 0 below t 0 g we have dq cp dt 0 obs 0 q dt dq eq t 0 relax t 0 0 q dt t 0 t 0 g where dq eq t 0 0 denotes the net heat loss by the system to come to equilibrium i e become supercooled liquid during cooling at t 0 for t 0 t 0 g we have dq dqeq t 0 thus 0 t 0 cpdt 0 t 0 0 t 0 cp eqdt 0 t 0 where dq eq cp eq dt 0 we thus conclude that sexpt 0 sscl 0 10 the strict inequality is the result of the fact that glass is a non equilibrium state otherwise we will have sexpt 0 sscl 0 for any arbitary state this proves theorem 1 the difference sr sexpt 0 would be larger more irreversible the process is the quantity sexpt 0 can be determined calorimetrically by performing a cooling experiment we take t 0 to be the melting temperature t 0 m and uniquely determine the entropy of the supercooled liquid at t 0 m by adding the entropy of melting to the crystal entropy scr t 0 m at t 0 m the latter is obtained in a unique manner by integration along a reversible path from t 0 0 to t 0 t 0 m scr t 0 m scr 0 t 0 m 0 cp crdt 0 t 0 here scr 0 is the entropy of the crystal at absolute zero which is traditionally taken to be zero in accordance with the third law and cp cr t 0 is the isobaric heat capacity of the crystal this then uniquely determines the entropy of the liquid to be used in the right hand side in eq 9 we will assume that scr 0 0 thus the experimental determination of sexpt 0 is required to give the lower bound to the residual entropy in eq 12 4 experiment evidence for a non zero value of sexpt 0 is abundant as discussed by several authors 3 9 12 13 20 21 various textbooks 34 35 also discuss this issue goldstein 9 gives a value of sr 15 1 j k mol for o terphenyl from the value of its entropy at t 0 2 k however we have given a mathematical justification of sexpt 0 0 in eq 10 the strict inequality proves immediately that the residual entropy cannot vanish for glasses which justifies the curve glass 1 in fig 1 the inequality in eq 9 takes into account any amount of irreversibility during vitri fication it is no longer limited to only small contributions of the order of 2 considered by johari and khouri and by several others 9 14 34 35 which makes our derivation very gen eral the relevance of the residual entropy has been discussed by several authors in the literature 9 12 15 17 19 30 by considering the state a 0 above to be a state a 0 of the glass in a medium at some arbitrary temperature t 0 below t 0 g we can get a generalization of eq 9 s t 0 sexpt t 0 s t 0 t 0 t 0 cpdt 0 t 0 11 we again wish to remind the reader that all quantities depend on the path a a 0 which we have not exhibited by replacing t 0 by the melting temperature t 0 m and t 0 by t 0 and adding the entropy s t 0 m of the medium on both sides in the above inequality and rearranging terms we obtain with sl t 0 m sscl t 0 m for the liquid sl t 0 m s t 0 m s t 0 s t 0 m t 0 t 0 m cpdt 0 t 0 12 where we have also included the equality for a reversible process this provides us with an independent derivation of the inequality given by setna and coworkers 31 it is also clear from the derivation of eq 10 that the inequality can be generalized to any temperature t 0 t 0 g with the result sexpt t 0 sscl t 0 13 with sexpt t 0 sscl t 0 as t 0 t 0 g from below thus sexpt t 0 appears in form similar to that of glass 3 in fig 1 except that the latter represents a possible glass entropy while the former represents the calorimetric approximation for glass 1 while we have only demonstrated the forward inequality the excess sr sexpt 0 can be computed in non equilibrium thermodynamics 43 45 48 which provides a clear prescription 13 for calculating the irreversible entropy generation we do not do this here as we are only interested in general results while the calculation of irreversible entropy generation will of course be system dependent and will require detailed information gutzow and scmelzer 12 provide such a procedure with a single internal variable but under the assumption of equal temperature and pressure for the glass and the medium however while they comment that dis 0 whose evaluation requires system dependent properties their main interest is to only show that it is negligible compared to des we have proved theorem 1 by considering only the system without paying any attention to the medium but assuming the second law as is evident from eq 8 we have done this because the proponents of vanishing sr normally consider the glassy state without ever bringing in the medium in the discussion this does not mean that the conclusion would be any different had we brought the medium into our discussion this is seen from the derivation of the ineqaulity in eq 12 from eq 11 we will find it convenient to consider the medium in the next section to overcome the objection 8 10 that the glass does not obey the second law iii entropy and enthalpy during relaxation we now turn to the inequality in eq 1 to see if it would ever be satisfied to avoid directly discussing the relationship of the latent heat with the entropy loss the possibility of entropy loss or whether the second law applies to a glass we change our mode of presentation and consider the system not by itself but as a part of an isolated system in which the system is surrounded by an extremely large medium whose temperature t 0 pressure p 0 etc are not affected by what happens within the system to prove theorem 2 we consider the system to be not in equilibrium with the medium all processes that go on within the medium occur at constant temperature pressure etc thus there will not be any irreversible process going on within the medium all irreversible processes will go on within the system this simplification occurs because of the extremely large size of the medium and will be central in our discussion here while some may doubt that the second law is not applicable to the glass at the glass transition there cannot be any doubt that the second law applies to the isolated system it is found 43 45 49 that the instantaneous temperature t t pressure p t etc of the system are 14 different from the corresponding quantities of the medium when the former is not in equilib rium with the medium all that is required is for the system to be in internal equilibrium 43 45 which is defined as a state in which the entropy has no explicit time dependence its time variation is due to time dependent observables and internal variables the existence of instantaneous t t p t etc is a consequence of internal equilibrium and is a general property of any system out of equilibrium even at high temperatures and is not restricted to glasses only therefore t t p t etc should not be confused with fictive temperature and pressure etc that are meaningful for glasses this issue has been discussed earlier 43 the gibbs fundamental relation for the system when it is in internal equilibrium is given by de t t t ds t p t dv t a t d t 14 where we have allowed for a single internal or structure variable t for the sake of simplicity for glasses see nemilov 34 and gutzow and schmelzer 35 for the usage of internal variables we have explicitly shown the time dependence in the above equation to highlight the presence of relaxation in the system the affinity a t is conjugate to the internal variable and vanishes when the system comes to equilibrium with the medium a 0 0 in that case we also have t t t 0 and p t p 0 see eq 15 for a system out of equilibrium the instantaneous entropy s t and volume v t seem to play the role 43 of internal variables whose affinities are given by t t t 0 and p t p 0 respectively this fact is not common in the glass literature to the best of our knowledge the temperature and pressure of the system are usually taken to be those of the medium which is an approximation for example schmelzer and gutzow 50 identify des cpdt t see their eq 1 whereas it should be properly identified as in eq 7 with t replaced by t 0 they also identify the pressure in their gibbs fundamental relation see their eq 2 as the external pressure we now turn to prove theorem 2 let us rewrite the gibbs fundamental relation as de t t 0 ds t p 0 dv t t t t 0 ds t p t p 0 dv t a t d t 15 in which each of the last three terms can be associated with an irreversible entropy generation 43 for this it is easier to take all but the first term on the right side to the other side of the equation we thus note 43 that t 0 t t ds t 0 p t p 0 dv t 0 a t d t 0 16 15 in accordance with the second law the equalities above and below occur only for reversible processes as we are only interested in irreversible processes in non equilibrium systems the inequalities above and below become strict inequalities which cannot be violated in any real process thus as before we will exploit these strict inequalities to derive a bound on the rate of entropy variation we extend the derivation given earlier 43 to include the internal variable to obtain as the statement of the second law 42 ds 0 t dt 1 t t 1 t 0 de t dt p t t t p 0 t 0 dv t dt a t t t d t dt 0 17 each term in the first equation must be non negative in a vitrification process in which the energy decreases with time we must therefore have t t t 0 during any relaxation at a fixed temperature and pressure of the medium so that t t approaches t 0 from above t t t 0 as the relaxation ceases and the equilibrium is achieved it now follows from eq 16 that during vitrification ds t dt 0 18 the equality occurring only when equilibrium with the medium has been achieved the above inequality gives the bound on the rate that we are interested in at the end of the relaxation s t 0 p 0 t t s scl t 0 p 0 the plus sign is to indicate that the glass entropy reaches sscl t 0 p 0 from above we have shown t 0 p 0 in s t 0 p 0 t s t t p t a t to emphasize that the result is general during any relaxation in the derivation which only considers the behavior of s 0 t of the isolated system no assumption about the nature of irreversibility such as any loss of ergodicity in the system inapplicability of the second law to the system possibility of any chaotic behavior chemical reaction etc is made the only assumption that has been made is that it is possible to define the instantaneous temperature and pressure for the system we have also made no assumption that s t lies above glass 1 glass 3 or below glass 2 the entropy sscl t 0 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid see fig 1 being a general result it should be valid for any real glass this now gives a way to decide which 16 of the glasses in fig 1 is in accordance with the above conclusion above t 0 g the system is always in equilibrium with the medium so its temperature is the same as t 0 below t 0 g when the system is not in equilibrium with the medium then t t t 0 as long as there is no equilibrium the entropy of glass 1 and glass 3 approach sscl t 0 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid from above during any isothermal relaxation which is consistent with eq 18 as the entropy is a unique function of the path the two glasses must correspond to different histories therefore from now on we will not consider glass 3 anymore for glass 2 in fig 1 the entropy actually drops below that of the supercooled liquid by some amount 3 8 32 33 the amount does not even have to be comparable to sr in this situation the entropy must approach sscl t 0 of the supercooled liquid from below during relaxation see the upward arrow in fig 1 this will result in the increase of the entropy during relaxation which violates eq 18 thus glass 2 cannot be rationalized for the same reason the conclusion of gutzow and schmelzer 12 of increase in entropy cannot be rationalized we are now ready to investigate what could be technically wrong with the entropy loss proposal this will also settle whether the glass must obey the second law or not at the glass transition from the behavior of ds 0 t dt in eq 17 we can immediately identify 43 45 the rates for the entropy of the system and the medium respectively ds t dt 1 t t de t dt p t t t dv t dt a t t t d t dt ds t dt 1 t 0 de t dt p 0 t 0 dv t dt while the entropy change of the medium has no irreversible contribution as noted earlier the irreversible entropy change dis t of the system is given by the three terms in eq 17 each of which must be non negative writing ds t des t dis t we find that des t dt ds t dt 1 t 0 de t dt p 0 t 0 dv t dt dis t dt ds 0 t dt 0 in general des t dt can have either sign in a cooling process we have de t dt 0 moreover we normally have dv t dt 0 thus des t dt 0 however its sign is not relevant for our discussion on the other hand dis t dt 0 which follows from the second law applied to the isolated system for which there is no dispute with these consequences 17 of the second law we can now evaluate the merit of the entropy loss proposal 7 8 10 32 33 let us consider vitrification the change in the entropy des t 0 is due to exchanges with the medium this is part of the entropy change that will occur even in a reversible process the contribution from the entropy loss 7 8 10 32 33 which we denote by dsloss t is due to the vitrification process vitrification in the entropy loss view represents changes occurring within the system as the contribution from every internal process must be included in dis t and as each such contribution must be non negative there is no way to justify the negative contribution dsloss t due to vitrification 7 8 10 32 33 without violating the second law for the isolated system this proves theorem 2 this is the conclusion obtained by goldstein 9 we have just provided a direct proof of his conclusion there is also no merit to the suggestion of gupta and mauro 8 10 32 that the glass does not obey the second law it is easy to see that the discussion above can be easily extended to include other ob servables and internal variables without affecting theorem 2 the above discussion was also not restricted to a constant pressure of the medium indeed the discussion above has been very general the only restriction was the extremely large size of the medium which is easily satisfied in experiments for the general case the gibbs free energy is given by g t h t t 0 s t at fixed t 0 we have 43 dg t dt dh t dt t 0 ds t dt 0 19 from which it follows that dh t dt t 0 ds t dt we now turn to considering isobaric vitrification during which the system is not in equilib rium with the medium we will assume that the system is always very close to mechanical equilibrium so that its pressure is equal to p 0 however there is normally no thermal equi librium so that the instantaneous temperature t t of the system is different from t 0 we will now show that the above general conclusion remains unaltered from eq 14 we have dh t dt t t ds t dt 20 where we have used a t d t dt 0 the last bound is tighter than the previous bound and reduces to the equality obtained earlier 43 in the absence of any internal variable in any case the enthalpy of the glass is not constant in time at t 0 g even for an isobaric 18 vitrification if we accept that the entropy undergoes relaxation we thus conclude that there is no justification in assuming h t 0 g 0 we now turn to the inequality in eq 1 to inquire what may be wrong with its trivial justification offered by its authors we consider t 0 t 0 g the enthalpy h t 0 of the glass relaxes towards its equilibrium value hscl t 0 of the supercooled liquid from above during isobaric vitrification contrary to the assumption by gupta and mauro 2 acknowledging this immediately leads to t 0 g s t 0 g sscl t 0 g h t 0 g hscl t 0 g as the right side is strictly positive there is no justification in concluding the inequality in eq 1 it is most certainly possible to satisfy the above inequality and also have s t 0 g sscl t 0 g this is consistent with strict inequality in eq 18 the equality h t 0 0 is only valid at t 0 g where the difference s t 0 0 so that s t 0 g sscl t 0 g the isothermal relaxation that occurs during glassy vitrification originates from the ten dency of the glass to come to thermal equilibrium during which its temperature t t ap proaches t 0 in time the relaxation process results in the lowering of the corresponding gibbs free energy 43 in time as expected this results in not only lowering the enthalpy dur ing vitrification as observed experimentally but also of the entropy s t during relaxation as shown for glass 1 in fig 1 iv statistical interpretation of thermodynamic sr now that we have established the reality of the residual entropy sr by considering the thermodynamic entropy in classical thermodynamics we wish to discuss its possible statis tical interpretation we recall that the thermodynamic entropy cannot be given a unique value all that we can discuss in thermodynamics is the change in it it does not even have to be non negative as is evident from the entropy of an ideal gas at very low temperature however as we have defined s t 0 t with respect to scr 0 in this work and we have taken scr 0 0 the thermodynamic entropy has a unique value therefore any attempt to provide a statistical interpretation must result in an agreement with the numerical value 19 of the above thermodynamic entropy a point also made by sethna and coworkers 31 the issue of the statistical interpretation has been discussed elsewhere by us 14 15 as a glass is a frozen structure over an extremely long period of time we index each frozen structure which represents a microstate at absolute zero by i 1 2 wg each microstate is characterized by the set of observables and internal variables all glasses formed under identical macroscopic conditions will be in one of these microstates at t 0 0 let pi 0 denote the probability that a glass will be in the microstate i the instantaneous statistical entropy is an average quantity 15 16 we set kb 1 s t ln p i pi ln pi if the glass formation occurs under an unbiased condition all microstates will be equally probable pi p 1 wg for all i so that the residual entropy is sr lnwg the necessary but not sufficient condition for this is that the system be macroscopically large the suf ficient condition requires the system to be in internal equilibrium though not necessarily in equilibrium with the medium as discussed elsewhere 43 in this case the contribution ln p lnwg to the entropy from any of the wg microstates is the same so that s ln p lnwg 21 there is no need to sum over all microstates since i pi 1 just one microstate will give us the correct entropy similarly just one microstate will give a highly reliable value of any thermodynamic quantity as the equiprobable condition will be overwhelmingly satisfied for a system in internal equilibrium just one glass sample will give us a highly reliable thermodynamics the discussion can be applied to a system at any temperature provided it is in internal equilibrium there is no need to carry out an ensemble or time average this is what makes classical thermodynamics such a robust and highly reproducible endeavor a result quite well known in equilibrium we have just extended it to systems in internal equilibrium just because a glass sample at absolute zero is in a single microstate does not mean that its statistical entropy is zero such a statistical entropy interpretation does not agree with the thermodynamic entropy which as discussed above is known to yield a non zero residual entropy in many cases therefore such an interpretation the one taken by kivel son and reiss 7 and by gupta and mauro 8 must be considered physically irrelevant the correct statistical formulation of the entropy is given by ln p as shown in eq 21 and merely reflects the sample probability of a glass prepared under identical macroscopic 20 conditions 14 any sample will give the same statistical entropy equal to the thermodynamic residual entropy so that the statistical and thermodynamic interpretations of the entropy are equivalent the discussion should not imply that the ensemble average is no longer meaningful just because we are dealing with a single sample the way to see it most clearly is to imagine dividing the system into a macroscopically large number of quasi independent subsystems each of which itself is macroscopically large the subsystems are identical in size let denote a microstate of one of these subsystems and p 0 its probability then it follows from their quasi independence that p k p the product is over all subsystems it is now easy to see that s sk where the sum is over all subsystems each subsystem can be considered as representing a member of the ensemble all these members are considered at the same instant recently goldstein 40 has also discussed the relevance of a single microstate for the average at any temperature but he does not discuss the time required for the system to come to internal equilibrium or to equilibrium after adding the enthalpy increment to it thus it is by no means clear that a single microstate during this time will really represent the average properties of the system his requirement of overwhelming majority of microstates must refer to the equilibrium state of minimum gibbs free energy at given t 0 p 0 but this is not relevant for a glass as the enthalpy increment is added it takes a while for this enthalpy to distribute itself throughout the system from the boundary during this interval the system becomes inhomogeneous and will not even be in internal equilibrium let alone in equilibrium in this interval we can still treat each subsystem discussed above in internal equilibrium but then we are dealing with an ensemble average over inhomogeneous subsystems we believe that his conclusion would be valid only after the system has come into internal equilibrium though not necessarily in equilibrium as demonstrated above for this we must replace his above requirement by equiprobability of microstates v conclusions the current work was motivated by the confusion about the residual entropy and about the behavior of the entropy during relaxation that exists in the literature as discussed in 21 sect ia there are opposing views not only about the residual entropy but also about the impact of goldstein s observation for the latter the use of calorimetric data so far has been to demonstrate that the irreversibility during a glass transition is minimal so that sexpt t 0 is not different from the actual thermodynamic entropy s t 0 of the glass but the calorimetric evidence does not reveal how s t 0 or sexpt t 0 relate to sscl t 0 therefore how s t 0 approaches sscl t 0 remains unsettled there are competing views in the literature to clarify the situation we have considered the role of irreversible entropy generation during isobaric vitrification and prove theorems 1 and 2 that are valid regardless of how far the system is out of equilibrium as long as it is in internal equilibrium the latter is required to define the instantaneous temperature pressure affinity etc the theorems are very general and are not restricted by the amount of irreversibility theorem 1 shows that the calorimetrically measured absolute zero entropy forms a strict lower bound to the residual entropy the former is shown to be positive under the assumption sscl 0 0 otherwise we have the strict inequality in eq 10 for a glass in general we have sexpt 0 sscl 0 it then follows that the residual entropy has to be larger than sexpt 0 theorem 2 shows that the instantaneous entropy s t 0 t must always be higher than or at most equal to the entropy sscl t 0 of the equilibrated supercooled entropy which invalidates the inequality in eq 1 during isothermal relaxation the entropy must decrease towards sscl t 0 in time all physical systems must follow the two inequalities in eqs 4 5 without any exception we have demonstrated that the entropy loss proposal violates the second law and have put the original observation of goldstein on firmer grounds we have not only justified but also strengthened the calorimetric evidence of the residual entropy by establishing sr sexpt 0 sscl 0 the theorems follow from considering the thermodynamic entropy that appears in the second law for an isolated system thus any attempt to provide a statistical version of entropy must satisfy these two consequences we have shown that the conventional statistical entropy formulation is consistent with the thermodynamic notion of the residual entropy and that the equiprobability requirement explains why a single sample is sufficient to give a highly reliable thermodynamics of the system even when the latter is not be in equilibrium with the medium 22 acknowledgments i wish to acknowledge useful comments from gyan p johari and sergei v nemilov electronic address pdg uakron edu 1 g p johari and j
