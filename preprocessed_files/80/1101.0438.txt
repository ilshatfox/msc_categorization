rev e 81 051130 2010 to be denoted by i in this work to inhomogeneous systems by con sidering the latter to be composed of quasi independent subsystems the system along with the macroscopically extremely large medium forms an isolated system 0 starting from the gibbsian formulation of the entropy for 0 which is valid even when 0 is out of equilibrium we derive the gibbsian formulation of the entropy of which need not be in equilibrium we show that the additivity of entropy requires quasi independence of the subsystems which requires that the interaction energies between different subsystems must be negligible so that the energy also becomes additive the thermodynamic potentials of subsystems such as the gibbs free energy that continuously decrease during approach to equilibrium are determined by the field parameters temperature pressure etc of the medium and exist no matter how far the subsystems are out of equilibrium so that their field variables may not even exist this and the requirement of quasi independence make our approach different from the conventional approach due to de groot and others as discussed in the text as the energy depends on the frame of reference the thermody namic potentials and gibbs fundamental relation but not the entropy depend on the frame of reference the possibility of relative motion between subsystems described by their net linear and angular momenta gives rise to viscous dissipation the concept of internal equilibrium introduced in i is developed further here and its important consequences are discussed for inhomogeneous systems the concept of internal variables various examples are given in the text as variables that cannot be controlled by the observer for non equilibrium evolution is also discussed they are important because the internal equilibrium in the presence of internal variables is lost if internal variables are not used in thermodynamics it is argued that their affinity vanishes only in equilib rium gibbs fundamental relation thermodynamic potentials and irreversible entropy generation are expressed in terms of observables and internal variables we use these relations to eventually formulate the non equilibrium thermodynamics of inhomogeneous systems we also briefly discuss the case when bodies form an isolated system without any medium to obtain their irreversible contributions and show that this case is no different than when bodies are in an extremely large medium 2 electronic address pdg uakron edu 3 mailto pdg uakron edu i introduction a nature of the problem in an earlier paper 1 which we will refer to as i in this work we have considered some of the consequences of applying the second law of thermodynamics to an isolated system 0 which consists of a macroscopic system of interest containing a fixed number n of particles atoms or molecules surrounded by an extremely large medium see fig 1 from now on it will be implicitly assumed that the medium is extremely large to be unaffected by the system later in this work we will also consider to have a fixed volume v instead of n or fixed v and n furthermore we will also consider briefly the case of many similar size systems forming the isolated system 0 without the extremely large medium the motivation has been to develop this approach to obtain a non equilibrium thermodynamic description of the open system under various conditions throughout this work we will use body to refer to any of the three kinds systems the isolated system the medium or the system all quantities related to 0 and will be denoted by a suffix 0 over the top and without any suffix respectively all quantities related to a body will be denoted without any suffix as if we are dealing with an open system similarly in this work we will say that the system is open when it is in a medium even though it is not the common usage this should not cause any confusion as the context will be clear to avoid complications due to external shear we had only considered under no external shear in i this restriction is easily removed as we will do here the isolated system will still have no external force acting on it to ensure its isolation see below also we will now allow forces acting at the surface v of the system or any of its subsystems see fig 2 a these forces must balance the internal stress tensor for mechanical equilibrium thus the force tidf acting on a surface element df must equal the stress force ijnjdf summation over repeated indices implied and we have 2 3 for the surface traction force ti ijnj 1 here n is the outward unit normal at the surface element df surrounding a point on the surface this condition must be satisfied at every point on the surface v the net force 4 system t t p t medium t p 0 0 0 fig 1 schematic representation of a macroscopically large system and the medium sur rounding it to form an isolated system 0 the system is a very small part of 0 the medium is described by its fixed fields t 0 p 0 etc while the system if in internal equilibrium see text is characterized by t t p t etc and torque acting on the system are given by f v tdf k v r s tdf respectively here for convenience r s is taken to be the radius vector of the surface element with respect to the center of mass of the system the external forces are responsible for the deformation of the system and also result in the translation and rotation of the system let us consider an infinitesimal volume element dv of mass dm which is moving with a velocity v t and rotating with an angular velocity t and has an intrinsic angular momentum m t dv the linear and angular momenta of the system in some fixed frame are given by mv t v t v t dm m t mr t v t v t r t v t dm v t m t dv respectively here m m 0 n is the mass of the system m 0 being the mass of a particle which we consider fixed for fixed n andr t andv t are the location and the translational velocity of the center of mass in this frame if the frame is taken to be the center of mass frame then r t and v t are zero if the body as a whole is stationary then the energy of the body is known as the internal energy such a stationary situation was considered in our previous work 1 where no motions were considered this limitation will be removed 5 dq t 1 t 0 dq t 2 dq t 1 t t 1 2 t t 2 a 1 t t 1 2 t t 2 dq t b fig 2 we show schemtically the two subsystems 1 and 2 t 2 t t 1 t forming the system in an extensively large medium in a and by themselves forming an isolated system without an extensively large medium in b the heat output dq t in a by 2 is the sum of dq t and dq 2 t while the heat intake by 1 is the sum of dq t and dq 1 t as we are dealing with an isolated system the heat input and output must be equal therefore dq 1 t dq 2 t the equality of the heat input and output is also true in b as the heat transfer occurs between objects does not occur isothermally there is irreversible entropy generation due to each heat transfer we will study this issue later in sect xi b here so as to allow for relative motions translation and rotation between the system and the medium these relative motions are the additional sources of viscous dissipation and give rise to additional irreversibility the irreversibility due to temperature difference such as between the system and the medium has already been considered in i we should mention here the recent somewhat comprehensive investigation carried out by bouchbinder and langer 4 who also consider a system under external shear however our 6 approaches and emphases are very different we should also mention earlier very different equilibrium like attempts by lubchenko and wolynes 5 and by o ttinger 6 mention should also be made of a very interesting phenomenological approach by oono and paniconi 7 on steady state thermodynamics which was later advanced by sasa and tasaki 8 the classical local non equilibrium thermodynamics due to de donder 9 12 is close in spirit to our approach and that of bouchbinder and langer 4 it will be the standard formulation with which we will compare and contrast our approach initiated in 1 therefore for the sake of continuity and clarity we briefly discuss the classical formulation involving local equilibrium in sect ii we note that there are other versions of non equilibrium thermodynamics usually known as the extended rational and generic non equilibrium thermodynamics 13 14 however we do not discuss these formulations in this work it is well known that the second law of thermodynamics for the isolated system 0 states that ds 0 t dt 0 2 where s 0 t denotes the entropy of 0 at some instant t it should be stressed that the isolation of 0 requires that there be something outside of 0 from which it is isolated therefore we will assumes that 0 is confined to a finite though extremely large volume v 0 15 the isolation requires that we neglect all interactions such as gravitational interactions of 0 with the outside that cannot be shielded all interactions with the outside should be relatively very weak to be negligible all relevant interactions must be confined inside the volume v 0 this to not to be taken as a weakness of our approach as including the interactions with outside will only make 0 an open system so that our investigation of an open system which is our primary concern can then be applied to it we should emphasize the following important point the law of increase of entropy in eq 2 should give a pause to those readers who believe that the concept of entropy is meaningful only for an equilibrium state and that the entropy cannot be defined for a non equilibrium state this belief is unfounded the mere fact that the second law dictates the approach to equilibrium clearly implies that the entropy exists even when the system is out of equilibrium this issue and the related history in particular the gibbs formulation of the non equilibrium entropy has been reviewed recently 15 and references cited therein and we refer the reader to this for further details we should stress that the gibbs formulation of the entropy requires that the dynamics of the system and that of the isolated system are 7 not deterministic but rather stochastic see 15 for further details b important restrictions in i and their removal in the current work an assumption that was implicit but not stated in i was that there was no relative motion between the system and the medium and that the isolated system was stationary this is normally the case in practice in which the various bodies 0 and are stationary in the laboratory frame of reference the latter we will denote by l in this work in general one can allow for a translation and rotation of a body as done here because we now wish to study their effects on the deformation of the system because of the stationary assumption there is no difference between the energy and the internal energy for 0 and this is a very common but useful assumption as the entropies depend on the internal energies and not on the energies 16 the latter energies may contain the contribution from the translation and rotation of the system as a whole in contrast the internal energies are the energies systems have in a frame in which they are stationary whenever we discuss both energies together in the following the internal energy will be denoted by a superscript i to distinguish it from the energy which is denoted without the superscript otherwise it will be clear which energy we are considering for a stationary system in the lab frame l the internal energy is the same as the energy the translation of a body as a whole merely affects the energy but not its thermodynamic properties however the rotation of a body as a whole gives rise to centrifugal potential energy that modifies the energies of microstates and has to be carefully incorporated in any thermodynamic investigation 16 see sect 34 as done in sect viii see also appendices a and b c present goal and the layout we had focused exclusively on the system as a whole without worrying about its internal parts in i as entropy palys a central role in our development we discuss the formulation of entropy and thermodynamic averages in sect iii where we show the entropy itself as a thermodynamic average under the assumption of internal equilibrium in the system there were no relative motions between its various parts that could add additional irreversible processes inside the system in this work we will remove this limitation and treat the system 8 as inhomogeneous as glasses normally exhibit both spatial and temporal inhomogeneity see 17 19 for some recent investigations we do this by considering to be composed of a collection of a large number ns of subsystems k k 1 2 ns which may be different from each other to allow for inhomogeneity and for relative motions and shear forces between different subsystems in terms of internal variables each subsystem is still macroscopically large so that we can introduce a legitimate entropy function sk see sect xb for further elaboration apart from the observables that can be manipulated by the observer there also appear internal variables often used in describing glasses as is well known from the early works of davies and jones 20 21 the latter variables cannot be manipulated by the observer and were briefly introduced in i but not explored we will also remedy this situation here and consider glass as an inhomogeneous system with internal variables specifically we treat translations and rotations of various parts of a system as internal variables that are generated by surface traction forces the alternative approach is to use the traction forces and the strains instead see for example 4 the phenomenological ideology introduced by davies and jones 20 which has been recently reviewed by o ttinger 6 is by now standard and has been discussed in several textbooks see for example 22 23 the observables and internal variables will be collectively called state variables see sect iii for proper definitions of these terms in sect we discuss the consequences of internal equilibrium and its similarity with and differences from the concept of local equilibrium 9 12 discussed in sect ii in particular we argue in the form of theorem 1 that the system can only sustain a uniform translation and rotation in internal equilibrium it is assumed here that there are no additional conditions such as the potential flow in a superfluid on the velocity the proof is trivial but the theorem has far reaching consequences for example it implies that the uniform rotation must be about a principle axis of inertia a simple way to understand internal equilibrium is to think of the system as follows we first disconnect it form the medium with which it is not in equilibrium and connect it to another medium whose conjugate field variables t p etc are exactly the same as that of the system the system remains in equilibrium with this medium so that there will be no irreversible process in the system we discuss the generalization of equilibrium maxwell relation to systems in internal equilibrium the condition for additivity and quasi independence is considered in sect v where we prove 9 that the gibbs entropy formulation in eq 21 is also applicable to an open system which is assumed to be quasi independent of the medium various thermodynamic potentials are identified in sect vi that are in accordance with the second law it is here that we see a clear distinction between our approach and the conventional non equilibrium theory exploiting the local equilibrium concept 9 12 internal variables are discussed in sect vii we prove that the chemical potential or the affinity associated with an internal variable must be zero when the system is in equilibrium we also prove that the entropy expressed solely in terms of observables when there are independent internal variables must explicitly depend on time so that while the system is in internal equilibrium with respect to all state variables it is not in internal equilibrium with respect to only observables a system undergoing uniform translation and rotation is studied in sect viii where we also develop the gibbs fundamental relation for such a system we then apply the results from this study to an isolated system in which the system and the medium undergo relative translational motion in sect ix but the system is homogeneous an inhomogeneous system with relative motions between its subsystems is studied in the next section we also discuss in this section the case of several bodies each in internal equilibrium but different from others that form an isolated body together by themselves without a medium see fig 2 b these bodies are macroscopic in size but are not extensively as large as a medium we discuss a direct method of calculating the irreversible entropy generation in each body in terms of the equilibrium state of all the bodies we find that the same results are also obtained by bringing all bodies in contact with a medium as shown in fig 2 a this equivalence is used to prove theorem 2 all these investigations are extended to include extra observables and internal variables the final section contains concluding discussion and a brief summary of our results ii local non equilibrium thermodynamics a brief review as entropy is the central quantity appearing in the second law in eq 2 we will pay close attention to its determination although this is usually not done in classical local non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 12 where its existence is taken as a postulate with an implicit assumption that it is always additive 9 the entropy s of a system is defined in terms of the local entropy density s r per unit volume s v s r dv 3 10 the local temperature t and pressure p are assumed continuous functions of the location r and time t and are postulated to always exist the additivity of the energy e results in e v e r 1 2 m 0 r v 2 r m r r r dv 4 here e r dv is the internal energy 1 2 m 0 r v 2 r dv and m r r dv the translational and rotational kinetic energy density respectively and r dv the additional energy contribution due to interactions not included in the internal energy density in a volume dv of the system the local mass and angular momentum densities are given by m 0 and m r respectively compare with eq 112 derived later after limiting it to the volume element dv the functional form of the entropy density depends on the nature of the system for example for a simple system containing a fixed number of structureless particles it is assumed to be a function only of the internal energy density e and the local number density see for example 9 see eq iii 14 s r s e r r 5 the local gibbs free energy density g is given by g e ts p 6 whether local equilibrium exists or not the unconventional use of the symbol g instead of g will become clear later when we discuss the gibbs free energy which follows from the second law and which continuously decrease as the system approaches equilibrium however no direct method of calculating the entropy is given in this approach except by assuming as another postulate the validity of gibbs fundamental relation which for a simple system with no internal variables reads td s d e pd 1 7 this postulate is a consequence of assuming local equilibrium 9 see eq iii 15 the presence of the local temperature t and pressure p in the fundamental relation imposes strong conditions on the nature of the entropy in that its partial derivatives are related to the given t and p under local equilibrium which follow from eq 7 we avoid the above issues in the conventional non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 12 by first identifying the entropy of the system in terms of microstate probabilities as de scribed below see eq 21 and then use the concept of internal equilibrium to introduce 11 the temperature and pressure in terms of this entropy the latter are defined only when there is internal equilibrium 1 this thus avoids the issues inherent in the conventional approach our approach is not local in that we always deal with quantities s e etc related to macroscopically large systems or subsystems as opposed to the conventional thermody namics which deals with local quantities s e etc as a consequence not only s e etc but also the temperatures pressures etc associated with these systems or subsystems will not always be continuous functions of space at the interfaces thus we will not impose continu ity in space on these quantities which makes our approach distinct from the traditional local non equilibrium approach of de donder 9 12 where these quantities are always treated as continuous in the latter approach a system can be broken into subsystems each sufficiently small yet large enough to be in internal equilibrium to satisfy gibbs fundamental relation this hypothesis is known as the local equilibrium hypothesis we add another requirement that of quasi independence of the subsystems in our approach which we believe to be ex tremely important only this requirement ensures that the entropy retains the additivity property and also remains a state variable as we will discuss later in sect v a helmholtz theorem to accommodate relative motion we need to allow for surface traction forces ti which then give rise to internal forces causing the deformation of the system these forces can be related to the induced stress tensor ij as shown in eq 1 and will result in a motion of the system due to non zero net force and torque acting on the system it is well known that the local motions for a deformable system can be described as a combination of three distinct types of motions 24 25 a a pure translation b a pure strain and c a pure rotation by expressing the instantaneous difference in the velocity v at two nearby points sepa rated by a displacement vector r as vi ij xj ij xj 8 12 where the symmetric tensor ij 1 2 vi xj vj xi represents the rate of strain tensor and the antisymmetric tensor ij 1 2 vj xi vi xj eijk k is the vorticity tensor and represents the axial vector 1 2 v associated with ij the second term ij xj in eq 8 represents the components of the vector r one should think of v as the relative velocity between two neighboring points separated by r the first contribution represents a pure straining motion while the second contribution represents a rigid body rotation for example a simple shearing motion in which plane layers of the system slide over each other can be treated as a combination of a pure strain with no rate of volume change and a rotation 25 b stress tensor the motion at the local level can also be studied directly by considering the stress tensor the stress tensor is normally expressed as a sum of the non dissipative and dissipative or viscous contributions 3 ij ij ij 9 in which the viscous contribution ij is some function that depends on the velocity gradients i e on vi xj 2 vi xj xk etc thus we can express it as ij aijklfkl vm xn 2 vm xn xp where aijkl does not depend on the velocity distribution and fkl is a function of the velocity gradients for example in a linear approximation using only vi xj fkl is taken to be fkl f 0 vk xl with a constant f 0 which could be conveniently absorbed in aijkl in this approximation we see from eq 8 that ij depends on both the rate of strain tensor and the vorticity 13 in general we can partition ij into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part the latter due to the presence of intrinsic rotation of the system 9 and describing the role of the rotational viscosity thus we can also partition ij into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part we refer the reader to chapter 12 in the monograph of de groot and mazur 9 of course there may be symmetry reasons such as the isotropy of the system that would forbid the dependence on vorticity in which case there would be no antisymmetric part it is possible to show 9 that the rate of change of the intrinsic angular momentum is determined solely by the antisymmetric part of ij thus the absence of this part will imply the conservation of the orbital and intrinsic angular momentum separately it can now be shown 9 eqs xii 18 and xii 18 that the antisymmetric part aij 1 2 ij ji contributes a term proportional to to the rate of change of the internal energy e and to the entropy production here is the vector associated with aij aij eijk k and represents the angular velocity of rotation of the system cf eq 4 thus this contribution vanishes for uniform rotation as expected for 6 there would be precession of the local volume element 26 about the direction of so that the rotational viscosity would play an important role until becomes equal to c energy balance and the first law the decomposition in eq 9 allows us to break the surface traction also in two terms related to the individual contribution t where the two new terms are defined similar to that in eq 1 the non viscous contribution is sometimes expressed by taking out the isotropic pressure term as follows pn 14 assuming that the thermodynamic pressure can be defined the rate at which the work is done on the system is given by the average over all microstates of the stress tensor at the surface v of the system dw t dt v t tjv s j df v t jv s j df v t jv s j df 10 where dfi and v s j are the components of df t and the velocity v s of the surface element respectively when the pressure can be defined this rate can be expressed as dw t dt p t dv t dt v t jv s j df v t jv s j df 11 in this work we will not consider latent heats and chemical or nuclear reactions within the body in this case the rate at which the heat is added to the system is obtained by considering the heat flux through the surface v and is given by dq t dt where dq t is the heat added to the system in time dt we can then write down for the rate of change of the energy due to the dynamics in the system as de t dt dq t dt dw t dt 12 which is a restatement of the first law of thermodynamics see also 4 it should be remarked that the balance equation 12 is in an integral form for the entire system and should be contrasted with the differential form commonly stated in textbooks see for example 9 the latter formulation is valid for infinitesimal volumes here we are not interested in such a local description our main focus is to consider regions of the system that are macroscopically large enough so that they can be treated as quasi independent under this condition the entropy of the system can be approximated to a high accuracy by adding the entropies of the subsystems we discuss this point further in sect ixa d need for internal equilibrium if the system as a whole is stationary then the average velocity v t 0 in this case the energy of the system is the internal energy we will consider this case below in this section for simplicity 15 the first law statement in eq 12 does not by itself allow us to determine the way the entropy of the system changes this law is valid even if the system is not in internal equilibrium in the absence of internal equilibrium there is no way to determine the change in the entropy from this law we need to relate de t with the change ds t in the entropy to determine the latter however if we now assume that the system is in internal equilibrium see i and sect below then the entropy no longer has an explicit t dependence in this case we can write down the differential of the entropy s e v n of a monatomic system of neutral particles with fixed n as 1 ds 1 t t de p t t t dv 13 compare this equation with eq 7 we can now use eq 12 in this equation to determine the rate of change of the entropy however as we discuss in sect in this case there is no additional irreversible entropy production arising from viscous stress tensor thus the last contribution in eqs 10 or 11 vanishes 27 sect 7 4 2 if there is no shearing at the surface then the second term in eq 11 also vanishes and we obtain the standard relation t t ds t dt dq t dt 14 this identification was used in i 1 e reversible entropy change and irreversible entropy production we wish to emphasize as was done in the previous work 1 see eqs 16 and 18 in particular that this assumption of internal equilibrium does not mean that the irreversible entropy production dis t in the system is absent unless the system happens to be in equi librium with the medium to see this most easily we recount from 1 that d e s t dq t t t 15 is the change in the entropy due to heat transfer dq t to the system that is in internal equi librium and depends on its instantaneous temperature t t we have used the superscript e to indicate that the entropy change we are discussing is due to energy heat transfer for which the associated conjugate variable see eq 27 is ye s e v n 1 t t and takes the value y 0 e 1 t 0 in equilibrium it follows from this that the reversible entropy 16 change d e e s t in the system depends on its equilibrium temperature t 0 which is also the constant temperature of the medium and is given by d e e s t dq t t 0 16 regardless of the instantaneous temperature of the system this results in 1 d e i s t dq t 1 t t 1 t 0 fe t dq t 0 17 in all cases here fx t f y t y t y 0 18 with y y 0 representing the equilibrium value of the conjugate field y associated with the observable x represents the thermodynamic force for the flow of x since t t in eq 15 undergoes a change dt dq t due to the heat transfer the heat transfer is not isothermal thus it should not be surprising that there is an irreversible entropy generation as part of it on the other hand the determination of des t in eq 16 requires the heat transfer to be isothermal for the process to be reversible what is surprising is that des t is determined not by the current state of the system at t but its equilibrium state in the future so that the concept of causality is inapplicable 15 it is this particular aspect of des t that is the cornerstone of the second law of thermodynamics dis t 0 also depends on the future we will make use of this observations later the situation with other extensive variables like volume v is no different as shown in 1 the entropy change and the reversible entropy change due to a change dv are given by d v s t p t t t dv t d v e s t p 0 t 0 dv t 19 it follows from this that the irreversible entropy generation d v i s t is given by an identical formulation as above for d e i s t d v i s t dv t p t t t p 0 t 0 dv t fv t 0 20 with fv t given by eq 18 with yv p t t t see also eq 28 represents the thermodynamic force for the flow of volume v it should be stressed that the validity of eq 13 follows from the continuity of the entropy and the existence of the internal equilibrium this is a general relation and is valid 17 for all systems whose macrostate can be described by the three variables e v and n on the other hand the form of eq 14 depends on particular form of the processes that go on in the system thus it is process specific recall that we have eliminated various processes in deriving this equation we can incorporate the missing additional contributions in eq 14 by properly introducing internal variables to describe the microstates of the system and generalizing eq 13 to include other extensive observables the issue of internal variables is taken up in sect vii and the generalization of eq 13 is taken up in sect viii iii entropy and averages a isolated system the entropy of an isolated system such as 0 whether in equilibrium or not is given by the gibbs formulation s 0 t p t ln p t 21 where p t is the time dependent probability of the th microstate of the isolated system 0 see a recent review 15 of this formulation for an isolated system regardless of how far it is from equilibrium it is assumed that the dynamics of the system is stochastic and not deterministic as the latter dynamics makes the above entropy a constant of motion in direct contradiction with the second law in a deterministic i e hamiltonian dynamics a microstate uniquely evolves into a microstate while in a stochastic dynamics a microstates evolves into several microstates with certain probabilities the unique evolution is time reversible which results in the entropy being a constant of motion in a stochastic dynamic the entropy can only increase 15 since the system is isolated we do not allow external forces acting on it we of course neglect weak stochastic forces acting on it thus any defor mation if it occurs is due to internal forces we have defined the entropy as a dimensionless quantity which is equivalent to setting the boltzmann constant kb equal to 1 the collection of these microstates along with their non zero probabilities represents a macrostate m 0 or simply m 0 of 0 as equilibrium and non equilibrium thermodynamics is an exper imental science a macrostate of any body is specified in terms of a set of some extensive observables x that can be manipulated by the observer the same set of observables are also used to identify the microstates most often the microstates are identified by the energy 18 volume and the number of particles that form the elements of x because of their special role in thermodynamics if there are other extensive mechanical quantities quantities that are not purely thermodynamic in nature such as the total linear and angular momenta then the microstates are characterized by all these extensive quantities collectively denote by x see the discussion in sect vii for more details apart from these observables a body can also be specified by a set i of internal variables 9 12 that have been found very useful in describing glassy dynamics and will be discussed later in sect vii indeed one needs internal variables to also explain the time evolution of an isolated system towards equilib rium since all its observables remain constant thus the macrostate of the isolated system can use the internal variables for its specification we will take these internal variables to be also extensive and call both of them as state variables and collectively denote them by z taking internal variables as extensive allows us to deal all state variables on equal footing so that generalization from observables to internal variables becomes almost trivial let us continue with the discussion of the isolated system in general microstate prob abilities p t are functions of the state variables z 0 along with t as a consequence the entropy s 0 z 0 t t is also going to be a function of z 0 t and t there are situations when the entropy can also depend on some external parameters such as the angular velocity of the rotation of the frame of reference these parameters need not necessarily be extensive just as t is not the number of state variables are too limited for a complete microscopic description of the system but is sufficient to describe the macroscopic conditions of a system the observables remain fixed for the isolated system 0 the internal variable i 0 t if present in the isolated system is normally a function of time its time dependence describes the temporal evolution of 0 while the microstate hence the value of the state variable z 0 in the microstate does not vary with time the average z 0 t for the macrostates varies with t z 0 t p t z 0 22 it should be pointed out that the entropy as formulated in eq 21 is also an average of ln p 15 the negative of the index of probability ln p there will be times when we will also use an overbar such as in z 0 t to indicate such averages for the sake of clarity for common thermodynamic quantities such as average energy volume etc the normal practice is to not use the overbar unless clarity is needed as it is mostly these average quantities that we deal with 19 b an arbitrary body it should also be stressed that the microstates for a body remain the same whether the body is isolated or not we can apply eqs 21 and 22 to determine the entropy and the average quantity for any body isolated or not such as the system or the medium neither of which is isolated in the following we will always use i to denote a microstate of a body but reserve to denote the microstate of the isolated system the entropy and the average energy of a macrostate of a body is given by s t i pi t ln pi t 23 a e t i pi t ei 23 b where i denotes one of its microstates whose probability is denoted by pi t 0 while we can certainly allow microstates with probabilities pi t 0 in eq 23 we find it convenient to only allow microstates with non zero probabilities in the sum microstates with non zero probabilities will be identified as allowed 15 in this work while there cannot be any doubt about the validity of eq 23 b one may feel some reservation about eq 23 a for the entropy of an open system therefore we will give a direct proof of eq 23 a in sect v iv internal equilibrium thermodynamics a equiprobability concept and consequences no internal variables we will first consider the case when there are no internal variables as is the normal practice see i for details we assume that the medium is in internal equilibrium even if the system and the medium are not in equilibrium this assumption is similar to the assumption of local equilibrium in the conventional nonequilibrium thermodynamics noted in sect iii as discussed in i and in the review 15 the condition for the internal equilibrium to be met is that the entropy has the maximum possible value at each instant for the instantaneous average value xie x t of the observable of the body for the case considered in i they are e ie e t and v ie v t for the medium the number of particles of the medium is not allowed to change at all so that n ie n is always kept fixed it is easy to see from 20 gibbs formulation of the entropy in eqs 21 or 23 a that this happens if and only if all the microstates that are allowed pi t 0 at that instant are equiprobable another way to think about the internal equilibrium is to imagine isolating the medium by disconnecting it from the system this will keep x fixed at x ie then the entropy of the isolated medium cannot change anymore in other words it is in equilibrium we can apply the same idea to any body in internal equilibrium the body will remain in equilibrium if it is isolated let us follow the consequences of this concept beyond what was discussed in i 1 we allow for the possibility of external forces including stresses acting on the system and produced by the medium see fig 1 under internal equilibrium pi t 1 w t i 24 wherew t is the number of allowed microstates 15 at that instant this immediately leads to the boltzmann entropy s t lnw t 25 for a system in internal equilibrium a common assumption in non equilibrium thermo dynamics see for example bouchbinder and langer 4 since the entropy is maximum at each instant t it cannot increase further if all observables are kept fixed at their values xie at that moment t when the internal equilibrium is achieved to ensure that x is held fixed at xie we isolate the system from the medium so that turns into an isolated system let its entropy be denoted by sis t after isolation as the entropy is already at its maximum it cannot change in other words sis s xie at fixed xie must be independent of time the above argument proves that the entropy sie s xie has no explicit t dependence when the system is in internal equilibrium sie s eie vie n s e t v t n its implicit time dependence when is treated as an open system comes from the temporal evolution of x t thus the maximum entropy in eq 25 will change with time as x t changes with time in the open system for the isolated situation sis s xie at fixed xie will remain constant 21 2 since the entropy is maximum for fixedxie there cannot be any additional irreversible entropy production dis ie anymore disie xie 0 in internal equilibrium ie 26 here the symbol xie means that xie are held fixed 3 when the system is in internal equilibrium its various parts must be in equilibrium with each other otherwise there would be irreversible entropy generation 4 it also follows from 3 that all the arguments that one uses to follow the consequences of equilibrium can be applied to different parts of that are in equilibrium for example the arguments that establish that a system in equilibrium can only sustain uniform translation and rotation 16 sect 10 can be applied without any change to a system in internal equilibrium as this result is going to play an important role in our approach we state it as a theorem theorem 1 there cannot be any relative motion between different parts of for fixed xie in the state of internal equilibrium thus a system in internal equilibrium can only sustain uniform translation and rotation 16 proof we refer the reader to landau and lifshitz 16 sect 10 for the details their argument applies without any change to an isolated system in equilibrium we easily extend their argument by considering our system at some instant t when it has xie x t we keep x t fixed at xie by isolating the system from the medium the arguments now apply without any change to the system in internal equilibrium this proves the theorem the axis of the uniform rotation must be a principal axis of the instantaneous moment of inertia of the system otherwise the system will undergo precession in space 26 and the rotation will not be uniform 5 even with internal equilibrium in the system there are both elastic and inelastic or plastic deformations 27 sect 7 4 2 which result in viscoelasticity in the system 22 if and only if the system is under internal equilibrium the derivatives of s t with respect to x t have the significance of the field variables also called the conjugate variables which we will denote by y t or y t y t y t t t s t x t x t 27 where x t denotes all other elements ofx t except the one used in the derivative compare with eq 54 the temperature t t and the pressure p t are defined in the customary way by ye t 1 t t s t e t x t yv t p t t t s t v t x t 28 where x t denotes all other elements of x t except e t or v t respectively in the two derivatives the pair of quantities x t y t or x t y t are called conjugate to each other the definitions of the conjugate fields give us an alternative way to interpret the internal equilibrium we imagine bringing the system in contact with another medium whose field variables are also yie where yie yie tie s t x t xie here xie denotes the value of the derivative at xie to distinguish this medium from the first medium that is characterized by y 0 t 0 p 0 we denote the first medium by y 0 and the new medium by yie the system in internal equilibrium with observables xie is in equilibrium with the new medium yie if the system is isolated by disconnecting it from yie then there cannot be any change in the macrostate of the system as all its observables remain constant at xie in other words the system after being isolated remains in equilibrium if it was originally in internal equilibrium as noted earlier this will not be true if there are internal variables to which we will turn to in a moment b zeroth and the second law all the above discussion has been for the entire system but can be easily extended to a system consisting of various subsystems k each in internal equilibrium let us consider the system shown in fig 2 which consists of two subsystems 1 and 2 whose internal 23 temperatures are t 1 t and t 2 t t 1 t respectively let their respective energies be e 1 t and e 2 t with their sum denoted by e t we consider all other observables fixed for both subsystems we first consider the system to be isolated with no medium as shown in fig 2 b then e remains constant but not the individual energies the irreversible entropy gain for the entire system is d e i s dq 1 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 0 29 during an infinitesimal heat transfer dq from the hotter subsystem to the colder subsystem here fe t 1 t 1 t 1 t 2 t plays the role of the thermodynamic force fe t for the isolated system and should be contrasted with the same quantity for an open system in eq 18 as the system is isolated this is also the entropy change d e s d e s 1 d e s 2 for the system with d e s 1 dq t 1 t d e s 2 dq t 2 t for the two subsystems as follows from eq 15 we now consider the system to be in a medium at a fixed temperature t 0 as shown in fig 2 a we take t 0 to be the equilibrium temperature of the isolated subsystems it is intermediate between t 1 t and t 2 t the infinitesimal heat given out by the hotter subsystem is now dq dq dq 2 the heat gained dq dq 1 by the colder subsystem must be exactly the heat loss dq since we are dealing with an isolated system therefore dq 1 dq 2 so that the entropy of the medium does not change as the entropy change of the isolated system is equal to that of the system we have d e s dq t 1 t dq t 2 t dq 2 t 2 t dq 1 t 1 t dq 1 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 0 30 since dq dq dq 1 dq dq 2 this is the same irreversible entropy gain in eq 29 for the isolated system in fig 2 b this should not be surprising as none of the heat transfers is isothermal thus bringing the isolated system which consists of two subsystems in contact with a medium characterized by the equilibrium temperature t 0 of does not affect the irreversible entropy production it is easy to see that the arguments can be extended to many subsystems and to other field variables we will not pause here to do that 24 at this moment it is important to follow another important consequence of the thermody namic force fe t which vanishes if and only if the system has come to thermal equilibrium this is the zeroth law of thermodynamics in terms of the internal temperatures of the two subsystems thus the internal instantaneous temperature plays the role of a thermodynamic temperature in that the heat always flows from a hotter subsystem to a colder subsystem the above result can be easily generalized to many subsystems let us now consider the volumes of the two subsystems to adjust as they come to equi librium all other extensive observables are considered fixed then the same reasoniong as above results in d v i s dv t p 1 t t 1 t p 2 t t 2 t 0 where dv t is change in the volume of 1 the volume of the isolated system remains unchanged the corresponding thermodynamic force fv t p 1 t t 1 t p 2 t t 2 t vanishes when the system comes to mechanical equilibrium it usually happens that thermal equilibrium requires mechanical equilibrium in that the forces exerted on each other by any two subsystems must be equal and opposite thus the conditions for the equilibrium is that not only the pressure p t but also the temperature t t have the same value in both subsystems c presence of internal variables we can easily extend the above discussion to include internal variables i t by replacing x t by z t in the context of internal variables their conjugate variables are known as affinity the general form of eq 27 is w t w t t t s t z t z t 31 where z t denotes all other elements of z t except the one used in the derivative the affinity a t is given by a t a t t t s t i t z t 32 so that w t consists of y t s t x t z t 33 25 and a t the generalization of the thermodynamic force in eq 18 is given by fz t f w t w t w 0 34 with w 0 representing the equilibrium value of w corresponding to the state variable z let us now consider the system to be in internal equilibrium while the medium containing it is y 0 a 0 where y 0 a 0 characterize the medium if we now disconnect the system from this medium but bring it in contact with another medium yie aie where yie and aie are the field and affinity vectors associated with the system in internal equilibrium then the system will remain in equilibrium with this medium this is no different than what we have said above in the absence of any internal variable i but the situation is very different when we try to keep the system isolated since internal variables are not under the control of the observer they cannot be manipulated to remain constant after isolation and will continue to change thus after the isolation xis the value of x t at the instance of isolation will remain constant but i t will not remain fixed at its value iis at the instant it was isolated this time variation in the internal variables is what drives this isolated system towards its equilibrium state during which its entropy will continuously increase this is very different from the case above when there were no internal variables thus a system in internal equilibrium cannot be isolated as an equilibrium system if there are internal variables present it can only remain in equilibrium with the medium yis ais d maxwell relations as the concept of internal equilibrium is not that different from the concept of equilibrium it should not come as a surprise that there are analogs of maxwell relations we recall that in equilibrium thermodynamics the standard maxwell relations for a system characterized by only s and v fixed n are as follows in terms of jacobians t 0 s n v s n p 0 v n v s n t 0 s n p 0 s n p 0 v n p 0 s n p 0 v n t 0 v n t 0 s n t 0 v n t 0 s n p 0 t 0 n p 0 v n p 0 t 0 n 35 all four maxwell relations use the same numerators t 0 s n and p 0 v n they use different denominators thus they can all be combined into one compact relation that can 26 be simply written as t 0 s n p 0 v n 36 here the relation only has a meaning if each side is divided by one of the possible denomi nators v s n p 0 s n t 0 v n and p 0 t 0 n on both sides we now consider a system for simplicity we assume that only one internal variable which we denote by characterizes this system we assume the system is in internal equilibrium to simplify the notation we will suppress n but use the additional variable along with the other two variables by considering the system in a medium yis ais we recognize that the system is in equilibrium thus the maxwell relations now for fixed can be compactly represented by t s p v 37 by replacing t 0 p 0 by t t tis p t pis which for simplicity have been written as t p the extension to the maxwell relation in terms of the internal variable requires considering the pair a in place of t s or p v where a denotes the conjugate affinity to for fixed v the maxwell relation is t s v a v 38 and for fixed s the maxwell relation is p v s a s 39 if we consider the system in the medium yis ais then we have the standard equilibrium maxwell relations similar to those in eq 35 however we are interested in the possible non equilibrium maxwell relations when the system is in the medium y 0 a 0 we first consider fixed the maxwell relation in eq 37 turns into the identity t s p 0 s p v p 0 s 40 that is t p 0 s p p 0 s v s p 0 v p 0 s p s p 0 for the enthalpy and t s t 0 v p v t 0 v 41 27 that is p t 0 v t t 0 v s v t 0 s p 0 v t v t 0 for the helmholtz free energy the details will be given in a separate publications 28 one can also obtain maxwell relations at fixed v or s for example we find the following maxwell relation p v s v s a s v s that is p v s a v s similarly from the maxwell relation t s v s v a v s v we find t v s a s v the maxwell relations in eq 37 39 contain the internal fields of the system and not of the medium 28 when the system is out of equilibrium obviously the extensive variables in the relation must refer to the system e internal equilibrium thermodynamics versus local thermodynamics we will argue in sect v that the concept of internal equilibrium which we adopt is no different than the concept of local equilibrium used in eq 5 or in the gibbs fundamental relation in eq 7 despite this the two approaches based on the concept of local and internal equilibrium respectively differ in some important ways that will be elaborated later here we briefly mention these differences the first important difference is that our approach is truly a statistical mechanical approach for non equilibrium systems once the probabilities of microstates are known the averages and other moments of all state variables that are used to identify the microstates and the entropy are determined for the macrostate for example the average fluctuation in z for a body is given by z t 2 i pi t zi z t 2 42 28 where z t i pi t zi 43 is the average z for the body compare with eq 22 as the microstate probabilities exist even when the system is out of equilibrium these averages including the entropy exist at all times even if the system is not in internal equilibrium their temporal variations are controlled by the dynamics governing the system and give rise to various balance equations see for example eq 12 the use of a probabilistic approach in the determination of the entropy and other statistical properties means that the dynamics in the system must be stochastic and not deterministic as the entropy remains constant in a deterministic dynamics 15 a consequence of the stochastic nature is that irreversible dissipation becomes an integral part of the statistical description of any system which then results in the law of increase of entropy as captured by eq 2 it is this law that was the foundation of our approach in i and which we develop further in this work the second difference is in the identification of the thermodynamic potentials for the open system which has been discussed in i and will be further elaborated in sect vi and again in sect xb it is discovered in our approach that thermodynamic potentials con tain the field parameters temperature pressure chemical potentials etc of the medium which determine how far an open system is from its equilibrium with the medium these thermodynamic potentials satisfy the second law in that they do not increase in a sponta neous process in contrast the form given in eq 6 for the local gibbs free energy density or its integral over the volume of the system does not always satisfy this requirement see the discussion surrounding g t in eq 22 of i however there is no discrepancy for the internal energy in the two approaches as both approaches give the same gibbs fundamental relation this is because the fundamental relation in both approaches does not depend on the field parameters of the medium but include the instantaneous field parameters of the system the third difference is in the reversible and irreversible entropy changes which depend on the equilibrium value w 0 y 0 or a 0 of the conjugate field w y or a as is easily seen from eqs 16 17 19 and 20 in the localthermodynamics these quantities are determined by the local conjugate fields the presence of the medium field variable in the thermodynamic potentials of the system 29 does not mean that the situation would be any different if we consider the system or sub systems to form the isolated system 0 without any medium as shown in fig 2 b in this case which we consider in sect xib we again find that the thermodynamic potentials do not depend on the field variables of the system or subsystems the role of the field variables of the medium y 0 a 0 are now played by the equilibrium conjugate variables y 0 a 0 of the system or subsystems this then leads us to the following important theorem theorem 2 an isolated system is no different than the open system in an extensively large medium y 0 a 0 provided the medium is appropriately chosen to represent the equi librium state in terms of y 0 a 0 of the isolated system in particular the reversible entropy change and the irreversible entropy generation in the two cases a and b in fig 2 are exactly the same as they both depend on the equilibrium conjugate variables y 0 a 0 of the system or subsystems an example of this is already seen in eqs 16 and 17 we defer the proof of this theorem to sect xib v additivity of entropy and quasi independence for simplicity of discussion we consider all systems to be stationary in this section so that we only deal with internal energies it was noted in sect iii and recently reviewed in 15 the entropy of an isolated body is given by the gibbs formulation in eq 21 regardless of whether it is in equilibrium or not there is no reason to believe that this formulation also applies to an open body under all conditions though its applicability in equilibrium is not in dispute 16 we now prove that this formulation also applies to an open body under a condition that is always taken for granted we will specifically consider our system at some instant t but the conclusion is valid for all bodies let us consider all allowed microstates of with fixed number of particles n we index these microstates by i 1 2 w t theses microstates correspond to all possible energies and volumes of the system we use to denote the microstates of whose number of particles n is also fixed a specification of the microstates i and gives a unique microstate specification representing a microstate of the isolated system 0 hence the number of microstates w 0 t of the 0 is the product w 0 t w t w t 44 30 where w t and w t are respectively the number of all allowed microstates 15 of and respectively at that instant t as the concept of microstates does not depend on the nature of interactions they exist even in the absence of interaction the above equation is valid for all kinds of interactions let e 0 e t and e t denote the internal energies of 0 and respectively let e int 0 t denote the mutual interaction energy between and at that instant for short ranged interactions this energy is determined by the surface v t of for convenience we assume that this entire area is exposed to the surrounding medium as shown in fig 1 if long ranged interactions are also present or if the system size is very small this energy may depend on the entire volume v t of in all cases this energy is defined by the following identity e 0 e t e t e int 0 t 45 because of the smallness of relative to 0 e t e t if it happens that e int 0 t e t 46 we call and quasi independent for quasi independence the linear size of the system must be at least as large as but hopefully larger than the correlation length in the system in this case we can neglect their mutual interactions which is a common practice in the discipline 16 the quasi independence of the system and the medium holds to a very high degree of accuracy for all short ranged interactions 1 provided the system itself is macroscopically large so that the ratio of its surface to volume is insignificant in most cases this will also ensure that the correlation length is small compared to the size of the system if there are also long ranged interactions then we can still have quasi independence provided these interactions are relatively weak and shielding occurs and that eq 46 and the condition on the correlation length hold simultaneously let us now assume that and quasi independent in this case the microstates of the two systems are independent of each other to a very high degree of accuracy and we have we suppress all state variables for simplicity of notation p t pi t p t now using ln pi t p t ln pi t ln p t 31 and the sum rule p t 1 i pi t 1 we find that s 0 t i pi t ln pi t p t ln p t where the two terms in the above equations represent the entropies of the system and the medium s t i pi t ln pi t s t p t ln p t 47 respectively this demonstration justifies the additivity of entropies s 0 t s t s t 48 as a consequence of quasi independence so that e 0 e t e t 49 also holds to a very good approximation note that we have neither assumed the medium nor the system to be in internal equilibrium in the above demonstration if the system and the medium fail to be quasi independent because their mutual inter action cannot be neglected then eq 46 is violated in this case the presence of this interaction acts as a constraint on 0 consequently the entropy now will be strictly less than the above entropy in eq 48 we denote this difference by s int 0 t 0 29 which is defined by the following identity s 0 t s t s t s int 0 t 50 this identity reduces to the above additivity in eq 48 provided s int 0 t s t 51 compare with eq 46 this inequality will in general hold only if the interaction energy is also negligible if the strong inequality in eq 51 is not satisfied we have lost the additivity property of the entropy let us assume that the strong inequality is satisfied for some large size of the system now as the size of the system decreases which is what will happen on the way to considering physically infinitesimal volume elements used in eq 3 there comes a 32 point where the strong inequalities in eqs 46 and 51 are violated this will destroy the additivity of the entropy as exhibited in eq 48 the violation of entropy additivity occurs at intermediate sizes of the system somewhere between the macroscopic size where eqs 46 and 51 are valid and small local or mi croscopic size containing a small number dn of particles for example for dn 1018 the surface to volume ratio for the volume element dv is about 10 6 implying an almost imperceptible error in neglecting the interaction entropy s int 0 t provided the linear size of this region is large compared to not only to the inter particle separation 2 p 1 but also the correlation length in the system under these conditions the integrand in eq 3 truly refers to a physically infinitesimal volume element containing a very large number of particles in this sense our starting premise is similar to that adopted in the conventional non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 12 in particular our concept of internal equilibrium is no different than the concept of local equilibrium in conventional non equilibrium thermo dynamics as observed in i except that we require quasi independence which imposes the strong condition that not only the interaction energy be small but also that the linear size be larger than the correlation length at present there is some evidence that the correlation length in a glass forming system appears to increasing as the system approaches the glass transition 30 the discussion above also clarifies that the additivity of entropy is a consequence of the additivity of energy of various parts of the body and that the interaction energies between them must be negligible this additivity of the energy and entropy was adopted in i however as we will be interested in considering parts of as subsystems in this work the additivity of their entropy requires that their mutual interaction energies be also negligibly small compared to their individual internal energies and that their linear sizes be large compared to the correlation lengths 30 these requirements put a strong condition on the sizes of subsystems 33 vi thermodynamic potentials a fixed number of particles n of the system despite similarities between our approach and that adopted in conventional thermody namics 9 12 there were important differences noted in i one of these was the discovery that the differences of the temperature and pressure of and which are the same as that of and 0 play the role similar to internal variables the second difference was that the gibbs free energy in our approach exists even if the system is not in internal equilibrium and involves the temperature and pressure of 0 or of course we assume that the medium is in internal equilibrium see i and sect under this very weak assumption for the medium its field variables such as the temperature t 0 pressure p 0 etc are well defined and are unaffected by whatever processes happen to be going on within the system or whether is homogeneous or inhomogeneous when the number of particles n in the system is held fixed the appropriate thermodynamic potential is the gibbs free energy which is identified as g t 0 p 0 t e t t 0 s t p 0 v t 52 where the observables e t s t and v t have explicit time dependence for fixed n the particular form of the gibbs free energy is in accordance with the second law in eq 2 and remains valid even if the system is so far out of equilibrium that its temperature and pressure cannot be defined see also landau and lifshitz 16 see sect 20 it is not surprising therefore that it contains the temperature and pressure of the medium which are well defined theses quantities do not exists for the system unless it happens to be at least in internal equilibrium even then the gibbs free energy is given by eq 52 and contains the temperature and pressure of as such it does not represent a state function of the system in engineering context this quantity is also known as exergy or availability 31 however our form in eq 52 differs from the local form of the gibbs free energy in eq 6 which contains the local temperature and pressure one can argue that the identification of the gibbs free energy in i was for the entire system but that once we account for the inhomogeneity by considering subsystems the gibbs free energy for each subsystem will somehow become consistent with that in eq 6 this is a reasonable possibility and we 34 need to investigate this possibility this issue is deferred to sect xb as the method to identify the gibbs free energy or other thermodynamic potentials that follow from the second law in eq 2 is going to be employed here several times we briefly sketch the derivation for the sake of continuity the full details are given in i we do not assume the existence of the temperature pressure etc of the system to include the situation in our discussion when the system is far away form equilibrium so that they are not defined for simplicity we consider a monatomic system of structureless particles under no external shear as in the previous work 1 accordingly we only consider the energy e volume v and the number of particles n to describe the macrostate of the system at any instant t no internal variables will be considered at this moment the system and the medium are assumed not to be in equilibrium we use the additivity in eq 48 to write the entropy s 0 t of 0 as the sum of the entropies s t of the system and s t of the medium if we also assume that the latter is in internal equilibrium then we have s 0 e 0 v 0 n 0 t s e v n t s e v n 53 there is no explicit t dependence in s e v n due to its internal equilibrium with n and n fixed we expand s 0 in terms of the small quantities e t and v t of the system s e v n s e 0 v 0 n s e x 0 e t s v x 0 v t where the derivatives are evaluated at e 0 v 0 n however as n is very close to n 0 there is no harm in evaluating the derivatives at e 0 v 0 n 0 this is the reason that we have used x 0 above for the derivative this approximation will be made throughout in this work the error is inconsequential when the system is a very small part of the isolated system it follows from the internal equilibrium of that s e x 0 1 t 0 s v x 0 p 0 t 0 54 we observe that s s e 0 v 0 n is a constant which is independent of the system thus s 0 t s s e v n t e t t 0 p 0 v t t 0 55 35 in terms of g t h t t 0 s t h t e t p 0 v t 56 we finally have s 0 t s s t h t t 0 g t t 0 57 it immediately follows from eq 2 that the gibbs free energy g t of the system in eq 52 continuously decreases as the system relaxes towards equilibrium a result quite well known in classical thermodynamics 16 dg t dt 0 58 the function g t continues to decrease and finally becomes identical to the equilibrium gibbs free energy at the current temperature and pressure t 0 p 0 if we abruptly change the temperature t and pressure p of the system in some state a where the system was in equilibrium to a new state a where the temperature and pressure are t 0 p 0 respectively at time t 0 then the initial values of the energy volume and entropy at the new temperature and pressure remain equal to their respective equilibrium values in the previous state a as the microstate probabilities p t at t 0 have not had any time to change thus initially g 0 e a t 0 s a p 0 v a in the state a the quantities with a prime are the equilibrium values in the state a the gibbs free energy decreases in accordance with eq 58 and eventually becomes equal to its new equilibrium value ga ea t 0 sa p 0 va where the quantities with the subscript a denote the equilibrium values in the new state a it should be noted that the equilibrium gibbs free energy in the state a before the abrupt change is g a e a t s a p v a so that the gibbs free energy undergoes a discontinuity at t 0 due to the abrupt change g a t t 0 s a p p 0 v a its magnitude and sign has nothing to do with the second law as the abrupt change is not a spontaneous process 36 a similar looking quantity g t see eq 6 for its local analog in the local non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 12 g t h t t t s t h t e t p t v t 59 which can be defined only when the system is under internal equilibrium and not otherwise was shown to increase with time 1 during relaxation dg t dt 0 60 in a cooling process since it does not always decrease with time it cannot be taken as the gibbs free energy the latter is supposed to never increase as the system equilibrates spontaneously as happens with g t see eq 58 b fixed volume v of the system instead of keeping the number of particles in fixed let us keep its volume v fixed so that the volume of the medium is also kept fixed the number of particles n of the medium is no longer fixed the entropy s e v n of the medium in eq 53 is expanded in terms of small quantities e and n of the system we follow the steps similar to those above and obtain s e v n s e 0 v n 0 s e x 0 e t s n x 0 n t 61 where x 0 stands for e 0 v 0 n 0 for reasons explained above in deriving eq 54 let us now introduce the chemical potential 0 of the particle in the medium by the standard definition s n x 0 0 t 0 we thus find that in terms of s s e 0 v n 0 s 0 t s s e v n t e t t 0 0 n t t 0 e t t 0 s t 0 n t t 0 62 which identifies a different thermodynamic potential in this case as t e t t 0 s t 0 n t 63 37 this thermodynamic potential also uses the field variables of the medium we should empha size again that no assumption about the internal equilibrium of the system has been made the system may or may not be in internal equilibrium the application of the second law in eq 2 now gives d t dt 0 64 c fixed n and v of the system if both n and v are kept fixed it is easy to follow the above derivation to conclude that the helmholtz free energy f t e t t 0 s t must continuously decrease as the system reaches equilibrium df t dt 0 thus the second law for an open system is expressed in terms of different thermodynamic potentials depending on which variables are held fixed vii internal variables as said above a suitable equilibrium macrostate description of the system requires a set of independent macroscopic observables that can be controlled by an experimentalist and whose values will allow the experimentalist to differentiate between different macrostates of the same system it normally happens that experimentalists have a far less number of external controls than the possible extensive variables that can be used to characterize the macrostates thus one does not characterize a macrostate especially an equilibrium macrostate by specifying all of the relevant extensive system quantities for example for a single component system one normally uses e v and n to specify the macrostate if there are no external shearing forces let us for the moment consider a system without exter nal shear usually one considers a system with fixed n then e and v can be controlled by the two external variables t 0 and p 0 associated with the medium however these ex ternal variables need not necessarily control the local or internal structures in the system at all times during its evolution towards equilibrium as frenkel has observed the local 38 structures can be important when considering the structural relaxation in a glass or other non equilibrium systems 32 p 208 for example one can consider the average numbers of neighbors and next neighbors of a given particle to describe the local structure in the system these quantities multiplied by the number n can play the role of internal vari ables the corresponding conjugate variables normally identified as chemical potentials or affinity for these internal variables usually vanish in equilibrium frenkel goes on and calculates viscoelastic effects due to structural changes and compares them with maxwell s model of elastic relaxation or an rc circuit this investigation by frenkel 32 shows that internal variables can play an important role in the temporal evolution towards equilibrium in some systems such as glasses as such they become an integral part of the description of any non equilibrium system and determine the relaxation of the system 2 sect 78 the internal variables are also called hidden variables or internal order parameters to introduce the concept of internal variables let us consider our isolated system 0 for which one can identify a set of conserved quantities i e integrals of motion for a mechanical system of s degrees of freedom the number of such integrals of motion are 2 s 1 26 of these integrals of motion those that are additive play an important role in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics the notable ones are the energy and linear and angular momenta of the system among others such as the polarization magnetization etc for the moment let us consider 0 to be stationary its macrostate m 0 is characterized by fixed internal energy e 0 volume v 0 particle number n 0 and other extensive observables collectively denoted by x 0 all these observables are constant for 0 let us consider the energy e 0 which is an integral of motion it usually happens see below for an example that there are many different components e k 0 of the energy whose total sum is the energy of 0 e 0 n 1 k 1 e k 0 t 65 where n 1 1 is the number of energy components it is e 0 that is a constant of motion not the individual components e k 0 t the latter will continue to change as the system evolves in time while maintaining eq 65 let w 0 x 0 t denote the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostatem 0 at time t at each instant t the microstates in w 0 x 0 t can be partitioned into groups according to the possible values of e k 0 t because of the sum rule in eq 65 only n of the components are independent for a given 39 e 0 which we take to be given by k 1 2 n we will denote this set by an n vector i 0 t whose elements are i k 0 e k 0 t k 1 2 n then e n 1 0 t e 0 n k 1 i k 0 t let w 0 x 0 i 0 t t denote the number of microstates for a given z 0 t these microstates define a new macrostate which we denote by n 0 obviously w 0 x 0 t i 0 t w 0 x 0 i 0 t t 66 the sum is over all possible i 0 t as the system evolves different components e k 0 t of i 0 t evolve in time t but e 0 and x 0 remain fixed thus a better understanding of the evolution of the system can be obtained by monitoring how the various components e k 0 t change in time for this it is better to use z 0 x 0 i 0 t to identify the macrostate n 0 even though individual e k 0 t cannot be controlled by the observer as e 0 can be controlled by the observer it is still the choice observable to be used for identifying a macrostate this is even more true for the isolated system for which e 0 is a constant of motion the n components of i 0 t then play the role of internal variables in developing non equilibrium thermodynamics of the isolated system it is evident that the same extended description should also be useful for an open system the only difference between an open system and an isolated system is that not all elements of x remain fixed some of the observables denoted by x are controlled by external field parameters y 0 such as t 0 p 0 etc of the medium so that they do not remain fixed but continue to fluctuate about their meanx t that keeps changing in time however at least one of the extensive observables such as n must be kept constant to quantify the size of the system 33 thus for an open system these observables can be replaced by the fields y 0 with the remaining observables remaining constant we will denote the latter observables by c to remind us that they are constant the open system can be either specified by x t c or y 0 c however for the sake of convenience we will continue to use x t rather than x t c or y 0 c let us now consider which is not in internal equilibrium so that it undergoes internal deformation due to relative motions between its various parts if there are external strains on the system they can be controlled by us from the outside hence they will not be considered as internal variables however internal 40 stresses acting on various parts of the system when there are no external strains on the system are beyond our control and must be treated as internal variables in describing the system as said earlier we can describe the internal forces acting on each part in terms of translation and rotation of its various parts see sect iia these motions must be described by the use of suitable internal variables such as the linear and angular momenta as was discussed in sect i b as the internal variables are uncontrollable their affinity in equilibrium must vanish as we prove now as a theorem theorem 3 the affinity of an internal variable must vanish in equilibrium proof it is sufficient to prove the theorem for an isolated system also we will prove it for the energy components in eq 65 the extension to the general case is a trivial extension and will not be done here as we are dealing with equilibrium we consider equilibrium values of all the quantities which are going to be represented by suppressing the argument t as they are stationary we now construct the following partition function for the isolated system z 0 x 0 a 0 i 0 w 0 x 0 i 0 exp n k 1 a k 0 i k 0 where a 0 is the the n vector a k 0 equilibrium affinity such a partition function correctly describes the situation in which the n internal variables are not constant but keep changing from microstate to microstate we now observe that this partition function reduces to the equilibrium value w 0 x 0 in eq 66 where we take the limit t provided a k 0 0 a k 0 0 k 1 2 n for each of the internal variable in the set i 0 eq this proves the theorem the above theorem deals with equilibrium affinities and says nothing about the affinities of the internal variables when the system is out of equilibrium let denote one of the microstates associated with the macrostate m 0 and one of the microstates associated with the macrostate n 0 then using their probabilities p t and p t we can determine the entropy of the two macrostates using the gibbs formulation in 41 eq 21 s 0 x 0 t p t ln p t 67 a s 0 x 0 i 0 t t p t ln p t 67 b for a macroscopically large system the following standard statistical mechanical arguments can be used to highlight the maximum of the summand in eq 66 let the maximum of the summand be denoted by m 0 t which occurs for some particular value i 0 t of i 0 t m 0 t w 0 x 0 i 0 t t we separate the maximum contribution from the sum and rewrite eq 66 as follows w 0 x 0 t m 0 t 1 i 0 t 6 i 0 t w 0 x 0 i 0 t t m 0 t where the sum is over all remaining i 0 t it is normally the case that the ratio in the above sum is vanishingly small for a macroscopic system and that the sum can be neglected in this case we have w 0 x 0 t w 0 x 0 i 0 t t 68 for a macroscopically large open system such as the above equation is formally valid except that we must replace x 0 by x t which stands for x t c and i 0 t by i t w x t t w x t i t t 69 we now prove an important theorem about the nature of the entropy theorem 4 the entropy expressed only in terms of the observables when independent internal variables are present must explicitly depend on t proof we first consider the isolated system 0 and prove the theorem for it for i 0 t to be independent of fixed x 0 it must surely have an explicit dependence on time in other words i 0 t must be a function of x 0 and t let us assume that there is an explicit t dependence in both w 0 functions in eq 68 as the entropy of the macrostate m 0 is given by the sum over all microstates w 0 x 0 t in eq 23 a it must explicitly depend on t thus the theorem is satisfied if however neither of the w 0 functions in eq 68 have 42 any explicit t dependence then this is possible only if i 0 t becomes a function of x 0 as the left side is only a function of x 0 since x 0 is constant i 0 t itself must be constant the latter is the situation in equilibrium i 0 eq i 0 x 0 a constant 70 it follows that i 0 i 0 eq is no longer an independent variable when the system is in equilibrium obviously this case is not covered by the theorem since i 0 is not independent the entropy in this case is given by the boltzmann formulation cf eq 25 and we have from eq 68 s 0 x 0 s 0 x 0 i 0 a constant let us now consider the special case when the macrostate n 0 satisfies the condition of internal equilibrium in this case w 0 x 0 i 0 t t does not explicitly depend on t and should be written as w 0 x 0 i 0 t with i 0 t having an explicit time dependence this entropy is again given by eq 25 s 0 x 0 i 0 t lnw 0 x 0 i 0 t 71 it now follows from eq 68 that w 0 x 0 t must have an explicit time dependence due to the explicit t dependence of i 0 t in w 0 x 0 i 0 t this is because different values of i 0 t will result in different values of w 0 x 0 i 0 t which can be treated as w 0 x 0 t associated with the macrostate m 0 at different times this is the first case considered above thus s 0 x 0 t will have an explicit t dependence even though s 0 x 0 i 0 t does not this proves the theorem for an isolated system let us consider an open system such as again i t must be a function of x t and t to remain independent of x t let us assume that there is an explicit t dependence in the w functions in eq 69 as the entropy of the macrostate m of is given by the sum over all microstates w x t t in eq 67 a it must explicitly depend on t if however neither of the w functions have any explicit t dependence then i t becomes a function of x t in this case it is not independent of x t this situation is then not relevant for the theorem the possibility in which i t is independent of x t but w x t i t has no explicit t dependence when the system is under internal equilibrium is very important fixing xis x t allows us to think of the system as an isolated system now we can use the argument given above for the isolated system to conclude that different values of i t will 43 result in different values of w xis i t which can be treated as w xis t associated with the macrostate m at different times in other words the macrostate m does not represent an internal equilibrium state thus we conclude that a macrostate n under internal equilibrium results in a macrostate m the latter is however not in internal equilibrium this proves the theorem it follows from the above discussion that a general thermodynamic state can be taken to be a function of internal variables along with other observables and time t when we deal with non equilibrium states for an open system in which many of the observables are controlled by external field parameters y 0 such as t 0 p 0 etc of the medium we can express ieq either as ieq i x eq c or as ieq i y 0 c away from equilibrium the internal variable i x t c differs from its equilibrium values ieq and is normally treated as an independent variable and plays an important role in the dynamics of the system as the latter strives to reach equilibrium thus it is not surprising that internal variables are employed to specify the macrostate of a glass in non equilibrium thermodynamics this fact has been recognized for quite some time 9 12 internal variables can also be related to the presence of internal degrees of freedom in the particles of interest the internal degrees are more common in polymers but can also occur in small molecules in the form of rotation about some internal axes an example will clarify the point much better consider a polymerization process resulting in a system of polydisperse linear polymer chains of average molecular weightm in a solution 34 the model is defined on a lattice of n sites and volume v nv 0 with v 0 a constant representing the volume occupied by a lattice site one normally uses e v m defined below in eq 72 and the number of chains p as the standard observables that can be used to identify the macrostate equilibrium or not of the polymer solution in turn these quantities are controlled by the temperature pressure and the initiation termination and propagation rates the last two can be related to the initiation termination activity controlling the number of endgroups two for each polymer and the middlegroup activity these activities determine the corresponding affinity or chemical potentials let nm n nv denote the number of monomers each 44 monomer occupying a lattice site in terms of the number of voids or sites not covered by monomers nv so that m nm p 72 in terms of the number of middle groups nm nm 2 p or nm the number of chemical bonds in the p polymers is given by nb nm p nm p there are two kinds of energy in the model 34 one kind of energy is due to mutual interactions of voids v with the end e and middle m groups and the mutual interac tions between chemically unbonded m and e let nij i j v m or e denote the number of nearest neighbor contacts ij i 6 j and ij the corresponding interaction energies respec tively the other kind of energy is due to intrachain gauche bonds g and hairpin turns hp their energies are eg gng for gauche bonds and ehp hpnhp for hairpin turns here ng and nhp denote the number of gauche bonds and hairpin turns and parallel bonds and g and hp are their energies in addition there is a mutual interaction energy between two parallel chemical bonds which may belong to the same or different polymers let np denote the number parallel bonds each of energy p thus e i 6 j v m e ijnij gng hpnhp pnp i 6 j v m e eij eg ehp ep 73 where we have introduced eij eg ehp and ep with obvious definitions we thus observe that the energy can be partitioned into six extensive energies five of which can be taken as internal variables to summarize we conclude that the quantities that cannot be controlled by the observer can be identified as the internal variables this statement should not be taken literary as what is considered uncontrollable today may not remain so in the future thus to some degree the decision to identify the internal variables is left to the observer for us any variable that cannot be controlled to have a fixed value when the system is out of equilibrium will be taken as an internal variable 35 it should also be noted that the number of internal variables is not a unique number for a given system for example to describe local structures in a monatomic system 32 one can consider any number of neighboring particles neighbors next neighbors next to next neighbors and so on thus a choice will have to be made to 45 see how many of them are useful in a given experiment or investigation this certainly gives rise to an additional complication in the study of non equilibrium system our approach allows us to associate affinity in a formal sense with all internal variables this is how the classical non equilibrium thermodynamics has been developed 9 12 as observed by landau and lifshitz 2 the use of internal variables in a modern way can be traced to mandelstam and leontovich 36 see also pokrovski 37 under the internal equilibrium assumption prigogine addresses the issue of internal variables orientation of a molecule deformation due to flow elastic deformation etc in sect 11 chapter iii of his classic book 12 or in sect 10 4 in the modern version 11 and couples them to their chemical potentials or affinities indeed prigogine and mazur were the first one to do this in their classic paper 38 see also coleman and gurtin 39 the issue of the internal variables is also discussed in sect 6 ch 10 in 9 pokrovski 37 provides a very illuminating discussion of internal variables and their role in determining the internal energy thus we will treat internal variables as additional thermodynamic extensive quantities or observables similar to the number of chemical species in chemical reactions that can be controlled by affinities or chemical potentials more recently the idea has also been visited by bouchbinder and langer 4 viii thermodynamics of a simple rotating body a general case we will find it convenient for later use to consider observing a body in different frames of reference see also appendices a and b for concreteness we consider the system and assume that no internal variables and no other observables besides the energy volume and number of particles are present the latter can be added easily as we will discuss later we will consider three special frames the lab frame denoted by l an intermediate frame i with its axes parallel to those of and moving with respect to l with a velocity v t and a frame c with its origin common with i and rotating with respect to it with an angular velocity t let r t denote the location of the origins of i and c in the lab frame l at time t with r t 0 0 let rc t denote the coordinate of a particle of in the c frame and vc t its velocity in this frame at time t its coordinate rl in the lab frame l is given 46 by rl r rc 74 its velocity is given by eq a 1 as shown in the appendix a the energy of the particle in the two frames are related as shown in eq a 4 let us consider i to be the frame in which the center of mass of the body is at the origin we will call it the center of mass frame for the body then applying the above two relations to all the particles in the system and averaging over all allowed microstates 15 which is carried out later in sect viiic we obtain that the energy of the system in the three frames are related as shown in eqs b 5 and b 8 ec el p 2 2 m m ei m 75 a ei el p 2 2 m 75 b where p and m are introduced in eq b 2 we have not used the overbar to express the statistical averages as explained in sect viiic but is implied we first prove the following theorem theorem 5 the entropy of a system is the same in all three frames l i and c proof to prove the theorem we proceed as follows only for simplicity of the argument and presentation we focus on a system with fixed v v t and n at some instant t the extension to considering other extensive variables is trivial consider observing the system simultaneously at t in these frames it is evident that corresponding to each pair rl pl of the coordinates and momenta of a given particle in the lab frame l at this moment there is a unique pair ri pi and rc pc in the other two frames this is true of all the particles the collection of positions and momenta of all the particles defines a point in the phase space in classical statistical mechanics a microstate of the system is identified by a small volume element of size 2 3 n about a point in the phase space thus corresponding to each microstate i il ii or ic in one frame there exists a unique microstate in the other two frames the uniqueness of microstate mapping ensures that their probabilities in the three frames are also equal pil pii pic 76 let us consider all the microstates of the same energy ec in the c frame at time t and let w t w ec t denote their number and pc t the set of their probabilities not to 47 be confused with momenta pc etc because of the uniqueness of the mapping of these microstates noted above not only the number of microstates in the three frames are the same at that instant w t w ec t w el t w ei t but also the set of their probabilities pc t pl t pi t however their energies are different as given by eqs 75 75 a and 75 b this immediately shows that the entropies using the general gibbs formulation in eq 21 are equal in the three frames sc ec t si ei t sl el t 77 whether the system is in internal equilibrium or not this proves the theorem it should be noted that the center of mass kinetic energy p 2 2 m is the same for all microstates in w t similarly it follows from eq b 10 that even m is the same for all microstates in w t see also the discussion leading to eq 84 b thus the three energies only differ by some constants at each instant t b system under internal equilibrium we now specialize and assume the existence of the internal equilibrium so that all mi crostates are equally probable pi t 1 w t i 1 2 w t 78 hence the three entropies are each equal to s t lnw t 79 it follows from eq 77 that there is no reason to use different subscripts to distinguish the entropies accordingly we will use s to represent the entropies in different frames their energy arguments will of course depend on the frame of reference the arguments v and above are actually external parameters that are not extensive we will show below that the entropies in the i and l frames are actually functions of extensive quantities p and m that are conjugate to v and respectively cf eq 27 48 c statistical averaging over allowed microstates we now investigate the consequences of statistical averaging over microstates with non zero probabilities 15 and show that its consequences are the same as expressed in eqs 75 and 77 we first note that m in eq b 2 depends on the coordinates and momenta of the particles but this is not the case with p even though both are extensive quantities as ec in eq b 5 or 75 a is for a microstate determined by the coordinates and momenta of the particles we need to average it using microstate probabilities in eq 78 averaging over various microstates relates the average energies in the two frame we use an overbar see eqs 22 and 43 to denote the average we find that the same form also describes the desired relation between the average energies ec t el t p t 2 2 m m t t ei t m t t 80 where ei t el t p 2 2 m 81 the momentum p of course does not require any averaging as noted above eq 80 is valid at each instance t we can also take the statistical average of eq b 3 a to obtain ec t el t p t 2 2 m j mjrj vj 1 2 j mj rj 2 82 where the two sums are over all the particles in the system here rj and vj are the instanta neous position and velocity of the jth particle in a microstate with respect to the c frame we have suppressed the subscript c from rj and vj for the sake of notational simplicity in the last equation the third contribution is due to the relative motion of the particles with respect to the c frame indeed the average of eq b 4 immediately yields m t t j mjrj vj j mj rj 2 83 the third contribution in eq 82 and the first contribution in eq 83 vanish when the system is in internal equilibrium because of the absence of any relative motion in that case see theorem 1 since ei also does not depend on the velocity v a similar averaging of eqs b 9 and 49 b 10 gives us ec t v t ei v n 0 84 a ec t t ei v n m t 84 b comparing the above equations with the equations in the appendix b we see that there is no reason to make a distinction between m t used in the proof above and m t or the average energies and the energy used above in the proof this justifies not using overbars to indicate statistical averages in eq 75 since the entropy s t in eq 79 is fixed for fixed ei v n and we can express the above two derivatives at fixed s instead of fixed ei ec t v t s v n 0 ec t t s v n v m t 85 the above equation is similar to the well known result 16 sect 11 in equilibrium statistical mechanics that the statistical average of the derivatives of the the energy with respect to external parameters v and should be taken at constant entropy and other extensive quantities we have extended this result to internal equilibrium now introducing the following standard derivatives ec t s t v n v t t ec t v t s n v p t 86 defining the temperature and pressure of the system we can write down the following dif ferential identity dec t t ds t p t dv t m t d t 87 it should be noted that because of eq 84 a the average energy ec t does not depend on the velocity of the frames i and c thus there is no reason to keep v fixed in the various derivatives in eqs 84 86 for ei ec m we find that dei t t ds t p t dv t t dm t 88 50 which is an extension of the result given in landau and lifshitz 16 sect 26 to the internal equilibrium the point to note is that the entropy s t in the i frame is a function of the conjugate variable m t instead of t however for el t ec t p t 2 2 m m t t we also find an additional contribution due to v del t t t ds t p t dv t v t dp t t dm t 89 given in terms of all extensive quantities the additional contribution due to the momentum differential dp t is due to the velocity of the system as a whole and is important to include in the lab frame for example such a contribution is needed to describe the flow of a superfluid in which the normal and superfluid components have different velocities so that the superfluid cannot be considered at rest in any frame 2 see eq 130 9 we will need to allow for this possibility when we extend our approach of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to inhomogeneous systems where different subsystems will undergo relative motion it follows form eq 89 that the drift velocity of the center of mass of the system is given by el t p t s v n m v t 90 similarly the angular velocity is given by el t m t s v n p t 91 we again observe that the entropy in the lab frame l is a function of the extensive conjugate quantities p t and m t rather than the external parameters v and from now on we will not use the overbar to show statistical averages for the sake of notational simplicity it is clear from eq 87 that we must treat ec t as a function of s t v t and t for constant n alternatively we must treat s t as a function of ec t v t and t sc t sc ec t v t t n 92 which is identical to the functional dependence shown in eq 77 except that we no longer have an explicit t dependence because of internal equilibrium the important point to observe is that the entropy is a function of not only the energy in the c frame but is also a function of the angular velocity of the reference frame when rotation is involved 51 d same temperature and pressure in different frames we now make an important observation it follows from eqs 88 and 89 that ei t s t v n m el t s t v n p m t t 93 obtained by differentiating with respect to s t similar equations are obtained when we differentiate with respect to v t ei t v t s n m el t v t s n v m p t 94 these equations are identical to the derivatives in eq 86 and show that the internal temperature t t and the internal pressure p t are the same in the three frames moreover it is the same entropy function s t that appears in eq 87 also appears in eqs 88 and 89 in other words the entropy is the same in all frames except that the arguments are different ix thermodynamics potentials and gibbs fundamental rela tion for a homogeneous system with translational motion a thermodynamic potentials for a system under arbitrary conditions 1 fixed number of particles n of the system before we discuss the inhomogeneous case let us consider the homogeneous situation considered in i and revisited briefly in sect vi and extend it to the case when the system moves as a whole with a linear momentum p we still assume that 0 is at rest because of the linear momentum conservation the linear momentum of the center of mass of is p thus the centers of mass and are moving towards each other for simplicity we will assume the absence of overall intrinsic rotation for and individually this can easily be incorporated as we do in the next section then we only need to consider the orbital angular momentum l 0 of 0 in terms of the locations r and r of the centers of mass of and respectively it is clear that l 0 always vanishes since the centers of mass of and are moving towards or away from each other so that p and r r are colinear r p r p 0 52 the average internal energies of and in their center of mass frames the c frame are ei e p 2 2 m e i e p 2 2 m while e and e denote their total energies in the lab frame l respectively see eq 75 however because of the extreme large size of its mass m satisfies the inequality m m so that we can replace e i by e without any appreciable error the entropy s of is a function of the internal energy e i however this is not relevant for our argument here if we are only interested in identifying the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the system the energy e 0 e e of 0 remains constant in time as discussed above the additivity of energy is valid under the assumption that the interaction energy e int 0 t between the system and the medium is negligible this ensures that the entropies are also additive in the lab frame l the entropies of the and are obtained by considering their entropies in respective rest frames c and c they are s ei v n t and s e i v n t respectively recall that we have set 0 for each of them using the fact that the medium is under internal equilibrium we modify eq 53 to reflect the dependence on internal energies to obtain s 0 e 0 v 0 n 0 t s e i v n t s e i v n s ei v n t s e v n 95 we now expand and follow the steps in arriving at eq 55 the steps are unaffected by the motion of we thus obtain s 0 t s s e i v n t e t t 0 p 0 v t t 0 in terms of the energy and volume of the system we can now identify the gibbs free energy and enthalpy in the lab frame l in terms of the energy of the system g t e t t 0 s t p 0 v t h t e t p 0 v t 96 compare with the gibbs free energy in eq 52 thus the second law in terms of the gibbs free energy remains unchanged and is given by eq 58 53 in the center of mass frame c of the system the gibbs free energy and the enthalpy of the system are given by gi t ei t t 0 s t p 0 v t h i t ei t p 0 v t 97 note that the above functions depend on the internal energy and not the energy of the system but they are not useful in the lab frame in which the system is being observed thus we conclude that the overall motion of the system does not change the enthalpy and the gibbs free energy we must use the appropriate energy in the frame of observation the temperature and the pressure of the medium are not affected by the choice of the frame as noted near the end of sect viii similarly the entropy of the system is unaffected by the choice of the frame as shown by theorem 5 2 fixed volume v of the system let us assume that instead of keeping n fixed we keep the volume of the system fixed then following the procedure given in sect vi we find find that the correct thermodynamic potential now in the two frames l and c are given by t e t t 0 s t 0 n t i t ei t t 0 s t 0 n t respectively 3 fixed n and v of the system let us assume that we keep n and v fixed then following the procedure given in sect vi we find find that the correct thermodynamic potential now in the two frames l and c are given by the helmholtz free energy f t e t t 0 s t f i t ei t t 0 s t respectively 54 4 extension to many state variables from now on we will list energy volume and particle number for any body separately and use x and z to denote the rest of the observables and state variables respectively we will only fix the number of particles n n but allow all other state variables to fluctuate in this case s e i v n in eq 95 must be written as s e i v n z and its expansion in terms of small quantities gives s e i v n z s e 0 v 0 n z 0 s e 0 e t s v 0 v t s z 0 z t here 0 corresponds evaluating the derivative at e 0 v 0 n 0 z 0 x 0 and i 0 so that these derivatives are constant independent of the properties of the system see the discussion in deriving eq 54 introducing the corresponding chemical potential vector 0 for x 0 and the affinity vector a 0 a 0 t 0 0 see sect vii for i 0 because of the internal equilibrium of s x 0 0 t 0 s i 0 a 0 t 0 0 98 we can identify a new thermodynamic potential gx t t 0 s 0 e 0 v 0 n 0 z 0 t s e 0 v 0 n z 0 gx t e t t 0 s t p 0 v t 0 x t g t 0 x t 99 in the lab frame l as e 0 v 0 n 0 x 0 and n are constant we have d dt s e 0 v 0 n z 0 s i 0 0 di 0 t dt 0 because a 0 0 thus s e 0 v 0 n z 0 is a constant and the second law tells us that ds 0 dt 1 t 0 dgx dt 0 100 as expected in any spontaneous process in the c frame we will instead have gix t ei t t 0 s t p 0 v t 0 x t g i t 0 x t 101 the important point to note is that chemical potential vector 0 and the affinity vector a 0 0 are associated with the medium just as t 0 p 0 are the analogue of the thermodynamic 55 potential t and f t are x t t 0 x t ix t i t 0 x t fx t f t 0 x t f ix t f i t 0 x t respectively again it follows from the second law that d x dt 0 dfx dt 0 102 as expected in any spontaneous process b gibbs fundamental relation for a system under internal equilibrium 1 no extra state variables z t we will first assume that there are no internal variables but the system satisfies the condition of internal equilibrium so that s ei v n no longer depends explicitly on time then we can identify the temperature pressure and the chemical potential of the system by s ei 1 t t 103 a s v p t t t 103 b s n t t t 103 c this allows us to write down the gibbs fundamental relation for constant n as t t ds dei t p t dv t t dn t which can be rearranged to write down the first law of thermodynamics dei t t t ds p t dv t t dn t 104 we now turn to eq 80 in terms of the momentum of the center of mass frame c of the system we have dei de v dp 105 56 recall that according to our assumption the system has no intrinsic angular momentum this allows us to use eq 104 to write down the differential form de t t ds v dp p t dv t t dn t 106 for the first law of thermodynamics in terms of the energy e t rather than the internal energy ei t this has some important consequences and will be extremely useful in the following the first consequence is that it allows us to think of s ei v n as a function of four variables s e p v n t t ds de v dp p t dv t t dn t this equation is the gibbs fundamental relation relating the entropy with e t rather than ei t the second consequence which follows from the gibbs fundamental relation is that s e 1 t t 107 a s p v t t t 107 b s v p t t t 107 c s n t t t 107 d the drift velocity v of the center of mass of the system is given a thermodynamic inter pretation in terms of the derivative in eq 107 b at fixed e v and n for the case when the number of particles is held fixed dn t 0 and the last term in dei t de t and ds t will be absent for fixed v the third term in dei t de t and ds t will be absent and so on 2 inclusion of state variables z t in the presence of internal variables x and i the extension of the above relations is quite obvious introducing the instantaneous chemical potential vector t associated with x and the affinity vector a associated with i using s x t t t s i a t t t 108 57 we generalize the entropy differential to t t ds dei t p t dv t t dn t t dx t a t di t 109 a de t v t dp t p t dv t t dn t t x t a t di t 109 b x inhomogeneous system with relative motion a subsystems undergoing relative motion we now consider the isolated system to be stationary so that it has no linear and angular momenta however and may have relative motion so that they each may possess linear and angular momenta that individually must cancel out p p 0 m m 0 110 moreover we will now treat as inhomogeneous and assume that it can be decomposed into a collection of a large number ns of subsystems k k 1 2 ns which may be in different macrostates to allow for inhomogeneity and for relative motion between different subsystems and within each subsystem each subsystem is still macroscopically large so that we can not only introduce a legitimate entropy function sk for the macrostate mk via gibbs s formulation sk e i k k nk vk zk t k p k t ln p k where k denotes one of the allowed microstates of the subsystem k corresponding to the macrostate mk characterized by observables e i k nk vk and zk but we also have these entropies satisfy the additive property s ei n v z t ns k 1 sk e i k k nk vk zk t 111 which requires their quasi independence as discussed in sect v at each instant t using the entropy sk we can introduce the appropriate thermodynamic functions but care must be exercised in identifying these functions in the lab frame l where the experiments are done this is because the energies depend on the frame of reference which will result in different values of the energies and thermodynamic potentials in different frames such as 58 the lab frame l and the rotating frame frame ck attached to the center of mass of k which is translating with a linear velocity vk t and rotating with an angular velocity k t to make further progress we will make another assumption later as we did in i that each subsystem is in internal equilibrium this occurs when all microstates contributing to the entropy are equiprobable p k t 1 wk 1 2 wk t here wk t represents the number of microstates of the subsystem k at time t under the equiprobability assumption or the internal equilibrium assumption sk t lnwk t which is what one would obtain by applying the boltzmann formulation of the entropy 15 it also follows from theorem 1 that the entire subsystem is uniformly translating with a linear velocity vk t and rotating with an angular velocity k t so that the system in internal equilibrium is stationary in the frame ck b system under arbitrary conditions the internal energy for each subsystem k is related to its energy ek in the lab frame l eik ek p 2 k 2 mk mk k 112 see eq 80 alternatively we can use eq 82 to express this relation as eik ek p 2 k 2 mk jk mjkrjk vjk k 1 2 jk mjk k rjk 2 113 where each sum is over nk particles in the subsystem k the third term in the last equation vanishes when the subsystem is in internal equilibrium as commented earlier we also have the additivity laws v vk n nk x xk i ik 114 a e ek eik p 2 k 2 mk mk k 114 b p pk m mk rk pk 114 c 59 at each instant t the angular momentum lk rk pk is the orbital angular momentum of k with rk pk representing the location and momentum of the center of mass of k respectively and should not be confused with its intrinsic angular momentum mk introduced in eq b 2 we should emphasize that the additivity of the energy requires that the interaction energy between subsystems be negligible this condition is necessary for the entropy to be additive as discussed in sect v as a consequence we do not have the contribution analogous to r dv in eq 4 this distinguishes our approach with that taken in local non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 12 we keep nk fixed for simplicity so that n is also fixed and allow e i k vk and zk to vary in time we assume as above that has well defined field variables t 0 p 0 etc which do not change with time this is ensured by assuming internal equilibrium for the medium this is the only assumption we make regarding the isolated system 0 for which we have e 0 e e v 0 v v n 0 n n x 0 x x i 0 i i because the medium is taken to be in internal equilibrium its energy is related to its internal energy according to eq 80 e i e p 2 2 m m e p 2 2 m m 2 2 i 115 where according to eq 110 we have taken m m and where i is the moment of inertia of the medium about its axis of rotation the axis of rotation must be one of its principal axis of rotation see the comment after the proof of theorem 1 in sect the contribution coming from the internal motion which is similar to the third contribution in eq 113 applied to the medium vanishes because of its uniform translation and rotation following theorem 1 applied to the medium the contribution similar to the last term in eq 113 is the standard rotational kinetic energy of the medium treated as a rigid body the angular momentum m is given by m ij i ij j mij assuming that the motions are finite we conclude that m ij must be finite therefore for an extremely large medium and v must be extremely small which ensure that the last two terms in eq 115 are extremely small this allows us to approximate e e i 116 60 without any appreciable error as far as the system is concerned the relationship between its internal energy and the energy is still given by eq b 5 ei e p 2 2 m m 117 except that the system may not be uniformly translating and rotating about any of its principal axis of inertia we take n and n as constants but allow for e v and z x and i to change with time now we use the entropy additivity s 0 e i 0 n 0 v 0 z 0 t s e i n v z t s e i n v z and expand s e i n v z s e 0 n v 0 z 0 e s e 0 v s v 0 z s z 0 s e 0 n v 0 z 0 e t 0 v p 0 t 0 x 0 t 0 by treating e v x and i as small parameters here 0 corresponds to evaluating the deriva tives at e 0 v 0 n 0 z 0 x 0 and i 0 we have also used the definitions of the field variables of the medium in terms of the derivatives of the entropy s in eqs 54 and 98 and set a 0 0 as established in sect vii we thus finally obtain s 0 e 0 n 0 v 0 z 0 t s e 0 n v 0 z 0 s e t 0 v p 0 t 0 g t 0 x 0 t 0 gi t 0 p 2 2 mt 0 m t 0 x 0 t 0 where g e t 0 s p 0 v g i ei t 0 s p 0 v observe that the expansion of s e i n v z does not require any knowledge of what is happening with the system for example we have not assumed internal equilibrium in the system or any of its subsystems since s e 0 n v 0 z 0 is a constant as established earlier the second law tells us that ds 0 dt 1 t 0 dgx dt 0 118 the desired result for the system the inhomogeneity of the system has no relevance in the above conclusion 61 let us now assume that x 0 and introduce gk ek t 0 sk p 0 vk g i k e i k t 0 sk p 0 vk 119 for the subsystem k it is clear that g k gk g i k gik because of the quasi independence of various subsystems eq 118 immediately leads to dgk dt 0 120 thus gk t can be identified as the gibbs free energy of the subsystem k in the lab frame l comparing this definition with the definition in eq 6 used in the conventional non equilibrium thermodynamics we see that the discrepancy in the two gibbs free energy has not disappeared by taking into account the inhomogeneity inherent in the system it may be argued that the above identification of gk in eq 119 is based on considering the entire system in contact with the medium one can alternatively consider a particular subsystem of the system in contact with the medium and the remaining subsystems however a little bit of reflection shows that this will not affect the behavior of gk for the simple reason that the remaining subsystems still form a very small part of the isolated system so that they cannot affect the internal equilibrium of the medium to see this more clearly let us introduce a new medium consisting of and the remaining subsystems only for the sake of simplicity we do not consider any additional state variables the argument can be easily extended to include them let s denote the entropy and e i e v and n the internal energy volume and the number of particles of the latter of which is kept fixed expanding this entropy in terms of the small quantities ei and v of the chosen subsystem requires calculating the derivatives s e e 0 v 0 and s v e 0 v 0 because of the small size of the system relative to the original medium these derivatives are not different from s e e 0 v 0 and s v e 0 v 0 62 respectively thus using e e 0 e for the energy of the subsystem k we find that s e i n v s e 0 n v 0 e s e e 0 v 0 v s v e 0 v 0 s e 0 n v 0 e t 0 v p 0 t 0 using this in s 0 e i 0 n 0 v 0 t s e i n v t s e i n v where is the angular velocity of the c frame of the selected subsystem allows us to identify g e t 0 s p 0 v 121 as the gibbs free energy of the particular subsystem it now follows from eq 2 that dg dt 0 a property we expect from the gibbs free energy of a system incidentally this also provides an independent justification of the inequality in eq 120 in terms of gik we immediately have gi k gik p 2 k 2 mk mk k which is expected in view of the sum rule in eqs 114 b and 117 c system under internal equilibrium the above derivation only uses the second law and the assumption that the medium sat isfies the condition of internal equilibrium the situation with the first law is very different in general the differential dsk of the entropy of the subsystem k is given by dsk sk ek deik sk vk dvk sk nk dnk sk k d k sk zk dzk t sk t dt cf eqs 77 and 92 if we now assume internal equilibrium so that sk does not have an explicit t dependence we can get rid of the last term above in this case only the remaining derivatives identify the field variables 1 tk pk tk k tk etc of the subsystem k sk ek 1 tk t sk vk pk t tk t sk nk k t tk t dnk sk k mk t tk t sk xk k t tk t sk ik a k t tk t 122 these derivatives then allows us to obtain the gibbs fundamental relation deik t tk t dsk pk t dvk k t dnk mk t d k k t dxk t a k t dik t 123 63 using dek t de i k t vk t dpk t d k t mk t we find the first law of thermodynamics can be expressed in terms of the energy as dek tk t dsk t vk t dpk t k t dmk t pk t dvk t 124 k t dnk t k t dxk t a k t dik t compare with eq 89 this allows us to think of the entropy sk e i k k nk vk zk t as a function sk ek pk mk nk vk zk t so that the drift and the angular velocities in internal equilibrium are given by vk t tk t sk t pk t k t tk t sk t mk t 125 however different subsystems will undergo relative motions with respect to each other as vk t and k t are different for them in addition their temperatures tk t and pressures pk t are also different for each other and so are k t and a k t thus there would be viscous dissipation and consequently entropy production as they come to equilibrium with each other and with the medium we now turn to this issue xi reversible and irreversible contributions a general considerations bodies in a medium it is a well known fact 16 sect 10 that in equilibrium the system has a uniform translational motion as a whole with a constant velocity v 0 and a uniform rotation of the whole system with a constant angular velocity 0 thus there cannot be relative motions between different subsystems in equilibrium thus no internal macroscopic motion is possible in equilibrium in equilibrium the coefficients of the differential quantities in eq 124 take their constant values of the medium writing dsk t desk t disk t 126 as a sum of the change in the entropy desk t due to reversible exchange with the medium and the production of the entropy disk t 0 due to irreversible processes within the system 64 we have desk 1 t 0 dek t v 0 t dpk t 0 dmk t p 0 dvk t 0 dnk t 0 dxk t and disk f 1 tk t dsk t f vk t tk t dpk t f k t tk t dmk t f pk t tk t dvk t f k t tk t dnk t f k tk t dxk t f a k tk t dik t 127 0 128 where fz f w w t weq 129 is the difference of the conjugate field w t at time t and its value in equilibrium i e as t and represents the thermodynamic force associated with the conjugate extensive quantity z t see also eq 18 for the internal variables the equilibrium value of a 0 is zero according to the second law of thermodynamics not only disk 0 but each term in eq 127 is non negative f w dz 0 where z and w form a conjugate pair in terms of these pairs we can express the two parts of the entropy as follows dsk wk dzk desk w 0 k dzk disk f wk dzk 130 which is the general form of the entropy differenmtial and its two components let us now turn back to the current case under investigation we can express the gener alized gibbs fundamental relation as dek deek t diek t where deek t 0 dsk t v 0 t dpk t 0 dmk t p 0 dvk t 0 dnk t 0 dxk t and diek f tk t dsk t f vk t dpk t f k t dmk t f pk t dvk t f k t dnk t f k dxk t f a k dik t 65 the generalized form for the gibbs fundamental relation is evidently dek tkdsk wk dz deek t 0 dsk w 0 k dz diek f tk dsk f wk dz where z represents all state variables except the energy ek and where wk tw and w 0 t 0 w 0 it is easy to see that performing the legendre transform to obtain the gibbs free energy in eq 119 only affects the form of desk but leaves disk unaffected thus it is easy to see that dgk t degk t digk t where degk sk t dt 0 v 0 t dpk t 0 dmk t vk t dp 0 0 dnk t 0 dxk t and digk diek the general form of degk is degk sk t dt 0 vk t dp 0 wk dz where z represents all state variables except the energy ek and the volume vk b bodies forming a finite isolated system without a medium so far we have considered a system or a collection of subsystems in a very large medium so that its field variables are held fixed at y 0 we now consider a collection of bodies of comparable sizes forming an isolated system 0 in this case we cannot treat any of the bodies as a macroscopically extensively large medium with a fixed field at y 0 as the collection strives towards equilibrium their field variables continue to change in time this causes a problem in identifying reversible contributions to various quantities to solve this problem we discuss below a simple case the generalization to more complex situation will be obvious 66 1 two bodies let us consider the simplest possible case of two comparable bodies 1 and 2 in internal equilibrium at temperature t 1 and t 2 t 1 respectively that are brought in thermal contact at time t 0 we will simplify the discussion by assuming that all other extensive observables besides the energy are held fixed the case of two bodies in the shape of rectangular cuboid along the x axis are shown schematically in fig 3 a with the rectangular interface of area a lying in the yz plane let dq de be the infinitesimal heat given to the body 1 by the body 2 as the amount of heat is infinitesimal it does not alter the temperatures of the bodies in any significant way so that the entropy of the isolated system 0 changes by ds 0 dis 0 dq 1 t 1 1 t 2 0 at t 0 compare with eq 29 this expression will not be correct as time goes on as the temperature continues to change the general expression for the irreversible entropy generation is ds 0 t dis 0 t dq t 1 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 0 131 where dq t is the infinitesimal heat given to the body 1 by the body 2 between t and t dt and t 1 t t 2 t are the instantaneous internal temperatures of the two bodies it is clear from the discussion following eq 29 that the irreversible entropy generation in eq 131 is the sum of entropy changes in the two bodies thus eq 131 is exact for the isolated system consisting of the two bodies however the point to remember is that it is the irreversible entropy generation in the two bodies and says nothing about the irreversible entropy generation within each body if the system above were not isolated then eq 131 would still give the entropy change due to the direct flow of heat between the two bodies but it not represent the irreversible entropy generation due to this heat flow moreover there would also be changes in the entropy of the system and each of the bodies due to heat exchange with the medium or other bodies these entropy changes will also have their own irreversible entropy generations the presence of the medium at the equilibrium temperature t 0 of the isolated system is discussed below the situation when t 0 is not the equilibrium temperature of the isolated system is very different as discussed later see the discussion after eq 132 what can we say about the irreversible entropy generation within each body this 67 interface region e t a interface region 1 t t 1 2 t t 2 t 0 t t 2 b t t 1 x fig 3 we show in fig a a simplified situation in which two bodies 1 and 2 in thermal contact are alligned along the x axis initially the two bodies are in equilibrium at temperatures t 1 and t 2 t 1 their contact interface is taken to be a plane orthogonal to the x axis as shown in the figure but the discussion is valid for any shape of the interface in reality however any interface is an interface region of some very small width x over which the temperature continuously changes between t 1 t and t 2 t so that there is a very narrow region of width dx x around a point e on the x axis where the temperature is exactly t 0 the equilibrium temperature of the two bodies as shown in fig b for the simple case shown in fig a question is to the best of our knowledge is not answered within the local thermodynamics approach to answer this question in our approach we proceed as follows we know that the entropy generation in each body must vanish when the bodies come to equilibrium to obtain the desired result we introduce the common temperature t 0 when the two bodies come to equilibrium we now discuss two alternative approaches to determine the individual entropy generation on the way to prove theorem 2 68 a introduction of a medium at constant t 0 let us imagine that we insert the two bodies in an extensively large medium kept at a fixed temperature t 0 with all three bodies now forming a new isolated system 0 the situation is schematically shown in fig 4 there is no direct contact between the two bodies as shown despite this the heat loss dq t 0 by the body 2 to is completely transferred to body 1 an alternative is to insert the medium between the two bodies along the x axis but not surrounding them from all sides with the same effect of transferring the entire heat dq t from body 2 to body 1 the width of the medium along the x axis may be infinitesimally small of order dx but must have a macroscopically large cross sectional area in the yz plane to ensure its constant temperature t 0 at all times in either case the entropy of the medium does not change so that ds 0 des 0 and dis 0 therefore the irreversible entropy generation in the new isolated system 0 is identical to the irreversible entropy generation in 0 this artificial introduction of can now be exploited to obtain the irreversible entropy generation in each smaller body the method of calculation above can be easily applied to this case see eq 127 to yield dis 1 t dq t 1 t 1 t 1 t 0 dis 2 t dq t 1 t 0 1 t 2 t 132 where dq t 0 is the heat addede to body 1 or given out by body 2 by comparing with fig 2 we note that dq t dq 1 t dq t dq 2 t dq t giving dq 1 t dq 2 t it is evident that these entropy productions vanish in equilibrium as required by the notion of equilibrium between the two bodies if we had introduced a medium held at a constant temperature t 0 6 t 0 then the equilibrium will occur at t 0 and not at t 0 and we would end up with a different final state of 0 than that of 0 thus the medium must have the constant temperature t 0 the situation will be very different if the medium is taken to be at a themperature t 0 6 t 0 in this case the heat given to body 1 is different from the heat given out by body 2 comparing with fig 2 we note for the total amount of heat dq 2 tot t given out by 2 and the total amount of heat dq 1 tot t given to 1 that dq 1 tot t dq 1 t dq t 6 dq 2 tot t dq 2 t dq t giving dq 1 t 6 dq 2 t 69 dq 1 t t 1 t 0 dq t dq t 2 t t 2 fig 4 a schematic representation of a new isolated system 0 consisting of the two bodies 1 and 2 not in thermal conatct surrounded by an extensively large medium which is so large that the presence of 1 and 2 does not alter its internal temperature which therefore remains constant we choose the medium as exlained in the text to be at the temperature t 0 the irreversible entropy generation in the two bodies are now givem by dis 1 t dq 1 tot t 1 t 1 t 1 t 0 dis 2 t dq 2 tot t 1 t 0 1 t 2 t so that dis t dis 1 t dis 1 t is given by dis t dq t 1 t 1 t 1 t 2 t dq 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 0 dq 2 t 1 t 0 1 t 2 t 133 notice that for t 0 t 2 t t 1 t dq 1 t 0 and dq 2 t 0 similarly for t 0 t 1 t dq 1 t 0 and dq 2 t 0 thus each of the last two irreversible entropy generation contributions above is non negative as expected we will see below that the last two con tributions are absent in the local theory the above approach can now be extended to many bodies at different initial temperatures tk we assume that the medium surrounds all the bodies so that there is no direct contact between the bodies if t 0 still denotes the final temperature of all the bodies treated as an isolated system 0 then the medium must be chosen to be also at the same constant temperature t 0 it is obvious that disk t dqk t 1 tk t 1 t 0 134 70 where dqk t denotes the infinitesimal heat added to the k th body between t and t dt and tk t is its instantaneous internal temperature compare with eq 127 this is a general ization of eq 17 to many bodies and exploits the absence of causality inherent in desk t as exemplified by eq 16 the irreversible entropy generation in the isolated system 0 consisting only of the bodies without the medium is the sum of all these contributions dis 0 t k disk t k dqk t tk t k dsk t ds t as it must be for an isolated system obviusly dis 0 t does not depend on the final temper ature t 0 here we have used the fact that k dqk t 0 because of the isolation of 0 and 0 it is quite clear that the discussion is easily extended to include other extensive variables which results in the expression for disk t which is identical in form to the expression disk t in eq 127 one may feel uneasy that the introduction of the fictitious medium has changed the problem to see that this is not the case we reemphasize that its introduction does not affect the heat dqk t since it is the heat dqk t that determines the entropy generation and since the equilibrium state of each body is the correct equilibrium state the result must be correct to offer an even stronger argument we now provide an alternative proof without the introduction of the medium so that we can feel comfortable in associating a medium in the case when finite size bodies form an isolated system the importance of this trick is that it allows us to use all the results we have found by the use of a medium b without any medium let us revert to the simple case of two bodies in thermal contact in reality the interface or the contact region between the two bodies is not a sharp boundary with a discontinuity in temperature rather it is a narrow region of width x over which the temperature rapidly changes from t 1 t to t 2 t as shown in fig 3 b thus there exist a point e over this region where the temperature is precisely t 0 it is possible that the location of the point e along the x axis changes with time but this point is irrelevant the relevant point is that the temperature in a very narrow width dx x around and including this point will remain constant in time if we take the narrow neighborhood of a point whose temperature is different from t 0 its temperature will eventually change to t 0 as equilibrium is achieved thus the temperature of the narrow region around this point 71 will not be constant in time we take the region where the temperature is greater than t 0 along with the half width dx 2 around e on the side of 2 to be the part of the body 2 while the region with the temperature less than t 0 along with the half width dx 2 around e on the side of 1 to be the part of the body 1 from the quasi independence of the two bodies it is clear that the inclusion of these regions will not significantly affect the internal temperatures t 1 t to t 2 t the heat lost dq t by the body 2 is transferred to the body 1 at a constant temperature t 0 thus while ds 1 t dq t t 1 t where t 1 t is the internal temperature of the body 1 des 1 t dq t t 0 so that dis 1 t dq t 1 t 1 t 1 t 0 as discovered above see eq 132 in a similar fashion we obtain dis 2 t dq t 1 t 0 1 t 2 t in accordance with eq 132 the above discussion justifies the use of t 0 as a temperature in the interfacial region however the important point is that the determination of des t for any body requires the use of the equilibrium temperature of the body in accordance with eq 16 thus the discussion is equally valid for any number of subsystems in the system c comaprison with local thermodynamics the same result as in eq 131 is also obtained in the local thermodynamics as can be easily seen see for example 12 eq 3 14 in the limit in which the interfacial region between the two subsystems is infinitesimal in width along the x direction we can obtain the continuum analog of the irreversible entropy generation between the two neighboring regions denoting t 1 t by t x t and t 2 t by t x dx t t x t t x dx we have ds 0 t dis 0 t dq t 1 t x dx for conduction dividing and multiplying by the cross sectional area a of the interface and using adx as the volume of the interfacial region we have for the rate of entropy 72 production per unit interfacial volume x t q t 1 t x 135 where q t q t a denotes the heat flux this expression in three dimensions the result will contain 1 t in this limit is a standard result for the entropy production due to heat conduction in local thermodynamics it should be stressed that our derivation of x t above is independent of the how long the two subsystems are along the x axis but assumes implicitly that t x t has a taylor series expansion it is also obvious that x t must be zero outside the interfacial region thus x t should be correctly identified as the rate of entropy per unit volume in the interfacial region therefore as it follows from the discussion immediately following eq 131 the derivation says nothing about how much of the irreversible entropy is generated within each body the issue is avoided in local thermodynamics by assuming that the entire volume of the system is composed only of such interfacial regions this is contrary to the basic postulate of local equilibrium according to which each local region has a well defined temperature t t while the interfacial regions have non zero gradients of the temperature we also observe that the form of x t in eq 135 is only valid for the case when eq 131 is valid it is not valid for the case covered in eq 133 this is the case when the equilibrium temperature t 0 of the system is different from the equilibrium temperature t 0 of the two bodies under consideration if treated as isolated bodies thus the above expression x t will not be valid if our system consists of a large number of bodies so that the irreversible entropy generation between any two bodies in contact will be given by eq 133 in this case the expresasion explicitly contains the equilibrium temperature of the system in the last two terms which is not the case with x t in eq 135 thus verifying the earlier statment made after eq 133 2 several bodies let us now consider a simple extension of the case shown in fig 3 a in which there are several bodies 1 2 3 b in thermal contact along the x axis forming an isolated body 0 with their temperatures in an increasing order t 1 t 2 tk tk 1 tb let tk 1 t 0 tk again denote the equilibrium temperature t 0 of the isolated body 0 so 73 that there exist a point e over their interface region where the temperature is precisely t 0 let us consider the infinitesimal heat dq 1 t received by 1 to be the part of the heat dq 1 t that was given out by the body k and was transferred unaltered via k 1 k 2 3 2 to 1 any heat transfer through the interface region at constant t 0 is isothermal therefore the reversible entropy change due to dq 1 t is precisely des 1 dq 1 t t 0 the entropy change of 1 is ds 1 dq 1 t t 1 t so that it immediately follows that dis 1 t dq 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 0 as above similarly we find disb t dqb t 1 tb t 1 t 0 for the body b where dqb t is the heat rejected by b which was transferred isothermally to the body k unaltetred for the body 2 which receives an infinitesimal heat dq 2 t we similarly find dis 2 t dq 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 0 and so on all these results can be easily obtained by inserting a medium held at fixed temperature t 0 at the interface between each connsecutive pair of bodies thus we conclude that we can consider an isolated inhomogeneous body as a body embedded in a medium without affecting any of the consequences this then proves theorem 2 c general discussion we are now in a position to provide a proof of theorem 2 we consider the reversible entropy change des p in a given subsystem due to the p th conjugate field w p t y t or a t due to the change dzp it is given by des p w 0 t 0 dzp while dsp w t t t dzp so that dis p f w t t t dzp 0 in terms of the quantity f w in eq 129 this thus proves the theorem 74 xii discussion and conclusions we have proposed a scheme to extend our previous work in i to an inhomogeneous system in which subsystems may undergo relative translational and rotational motions with respect to each other to contribute to irreversibility another source of irreversibility is the temperature variation which was considered in i each subsystem or the medium is identified by a set of extensive state variables z t and some constant parameters c some of which may be external parameters and need not be extensive examples of c may be the number of particles in the system that characterize the system or the translational and the angular velocities of the frame of reference in which the observations are made examples of the state variables are mechanical quantities such as energy volume etc and the internal variables are the translational and angular momenta of the various subsystems etc a quasi independence and additivity of entropy and energy as our approach starts from the second law the law of increase of entropy the entropy as a state function plays the most important role in our approach accordingly we need to ensure that this quantity can always be determined by or at least formally defined in terms of some basic quantities pertaining to the macrostate of the system of interest we use the gibbs formulation of the entropy such as that in eq 21 which is applicable in all cases as discussed in a recent review 15 this formulation is well established for an isolated system 15 but we show in sect v that it is also applicable to an open system even when it is not in equilibrium with its surrounding medium this formulation of entropy for open system is a well known result in equilibrium thermodynamics 16 and our demonstration generalizes this result to non equilibrium systems so that this entropy can be used as the central quantity in developing a non equilibrium thermodynamics with the second law as the starting point it is required that the open system be quasi independent of the medium we have shown in sect v that this quasi independence is a very important property which is required for the additivity of the entropy and of energy for example quasi independence of the system and the medium ensures that their energy of interaction is negligible so that dropping it makes their energies additive as seen from eqs 45 and 49 indeed without the additivity of the energy the entropy cannot be additive as discussed in sect v the basic idea is very simple 75 but profound the entropy being a state function must only depend on state variables by definition all state variables of a body must be solely determined by what happens within the body if there are other bodies their influence on the body must not destroy the additivity of all extensive state variables let us consider the isolated system consisting of the system and the medium it is in contact with which is considered in sect v in particular consider the energies in eq 45 we will assume no relative motion between and the medium to make the discussion simple the energies e 0 e t and e t then represent the energies of the isolated system the system and the medium respectively however the presence of the interaction energy e int 0 t in this equation destroys the required property that the right side of eq 45 is the sum of internal energies of the system and the medium the interaction energy is a property of both bodies accordingly the entropy s 0 e 0 of 0 cannot depend only on the energies of the two bodies separately the difference represented by s int 0 t in eq 50 depends on both bodies thus the entropy of the isolated system cannot be a sum of entropies each representing the entropy of one of the bodies alone in other words generalizing this result to a collection of bodies bj forming a body b we conclude that the entropy s b of b cannot be expressed as a sum of entropies each term s bj representing the entropy of the body bj s b 6 j s bj however the additivity requires not only that the sum of the energies of various parts bj of a body must yield the energy of the body b itself e b j e bj which is satisfied if the linear sizes of the bodies are large compared with the range of interaction but also requires that various bodies are quasi independent which is satisfied if the linear sizes of the bodies are large compared with thecorrelation length unless thess properties hold the entropy cannot be expressed as a sum of the entropies of its parts with each entropy depending only on the properties of the part alone it is the latter property that makes entropy a state function 76 b concept of internal equilibrium for a body or its parts such as subsystems out of equilibrium the entropy usually has an explicit dependence on time in addition to the implicit time dependence s b s x i t the latter arises from the dependence of the entropy on state variables x t and i t that explicitly depend on time we will suppress this time dependence in the following for nota tional simplicity we will assume as discussed in 33 that at least one observable which we take to be the number of particles n is held fixed and is not contained in x thus such an entropy will continue to change increase if the body is isolated for fixed state variables for a homogeneous body this will happen if the state variables in x and i do not uniquely specify its state in other words there may be other internal variables not contained in i this is a connsequence of a simple generalization of theorem 4 the other possibility is that the body is not homogeneous if the isolated body is not in equilibrium its entropy continues to increase according to the second law in eq 2 however if it happens that the entropy of the body does not explicitly depend on time sie b s x i then its entropy must be at its maximum for fixed x and i this is how we had introduced the concept of internal equilibrium in i in this state the entropy of a system which is not in equilibrium with the medium y 0 0 has no explicit time dependence it can be brought in contact with another medium representing the medium yie aie so that it remains in equilibrium with the new medium in other words there is no difference between a body in internal equilibrium with the medium y 0 0 and the body in equilibrium with the medium yie aie in the latter case the medium ensures to keep the averages xie and iie fixed in both cases the entropy is maximum for the fixed values of their state variables xie and iie accordingly all properties of a body in equilibrium also hold for a body in internal equilibrium at each instant for example theorem 1 established in sect iid shows that there cannot be any relative motion within such a body the only possible motion is a uniform translation and a rigid body rotation as a consequence as discussed in sect iid there is no viscous dissipation within the body in internal equilibrium thus while there 77 s i ts eq ts ts 0 s ts e ts t fig 5 schematic form of the entropy s t solid curve and seq t dotted upper curve in a cooling experiment both curves start from s at t 0 and end at s 0 as t the entropy difference s t is shown by the leftmost downward pointing arrow and es t by the rightmost pointing arrow the irreversible entropy generation is t 0 is shown by the small upward pointing arrow is no relative motion between the system and yie aie there will in general be relative motions between the system and the medium y 0 0 this result can be generalized to the following statement the only source of viscous dissipation in a collection of bodies is then due to relative motions between different bodies when each of which is postulated to be in internal equilibrium it was assumed in i that the system at each instant remains in internal equilibrium as it goes from one equilibrium macrostate m in contact with a medium y 0 0 at time t 0 to another equilibrium macrostate m 0 in contact with a medium y 0 0 as t let us try to understand the behavior of its entropy s t during this process which can then be extended to a subsystem in internal equilibrium the field variables for the two macrostates are w y y 0 a 0 and w 0 y y 0 a 0 respectively as discussed several times the intermediate macrostate n t at some instant t can be thought of as an equilibrium state of the system in contact with a medium yie y t aie a t after being disconnected from the medium y 0 0 in this equilibrium state the system has a well defined field w t y t a t and the entropy s t which is shown by the 78 solid curve in fig 5 however this equilibrium state of the system does not represent the equilibrium state of the system in contact with either the medium y 0 0 or the medium yie 0 if we bring the system in contact with the medium yie 0 its entropy will increase as the internal variables relax towards the new equilibrium to be denoted by m t with fixed xie the equilibrium entropy of the system in m t will be denoted by seq t which is shown by the dotted curve in fig 5 because of our assumption of internal equilibrium s t represents the maximum possible entropy for the macrostate n t at t the change in the entropy s t is given by s t s t s where s is the equilibrium entropy in the macrostate m at t 0 and is shown by the left most arrow in fig 5 the total entropy change in the entire process is s s 0 s where s 0 as the equilibrium entropy in the macrostate m 0 as t the entropy difference s t can always be broken into two parts in analogy with the two terms in eq 126 s t es t is t with es t see the right most arrow in fig 5 representing the entropy exchange with the medium y 0 0 and is 0 0 the irreversible entropy production within the system see the middle small arrow in fig 5 it does not matter whether the process is reversible or irreversible the entropy change is always s t in the former process es t s t is t 0 and s t seq t in the latter process es t s t and there is irreversible entropy production during the passage from m to n t is t 0 in accordance with eq 128 we thus see that irreversible generation of entropy has been accounted for in our approach see also i and eq 128 we can easily extend the above discussion to the subsystems where we now also have the possibility of irreversible 79 entropy generation through relative motions between them which is also accounted for in our approach we have found theorem 4 that while a body is in internal equilibrium in the presence of internal variables it is not in internal equilibrium when internal variables are not considered in its description in other words the entropy of a body see the solid curve for s t in fig 5 s b sie b s x i 136 has no explicit time dependence however it becomes an explicit function of time if expressed only in terms of observables s b s x t 137 this theorem shows how important the internal variables are in describing glasses because of the presence of t this entropy will continue to increase and approach seq t shown in fig 5 if we keep x fixed as experimentalists can only control the observables in x it is the expression of the entropy in eq 137 that is experimentally relevant because of the explicit t dependence the body will continue to relax even if the observables are held fixed by isolating the body from its surroundings and bringing it in contact with the medium yie 0 this relaxation occurs because the internal variable i is no longer held fixed it will continue to change with time until finally the entropy reaches its maximum possible value for fixed x we can apply theorem 3 for an isolated system to our body the conclusion is that the maximum of the entropy occurs when a for the internal variable i is identically zero which is why we had selected this particular medium the final value of i is some value ieq x the body in this equilibrium state is the fully relaxed body with its entropy given by seq b seq x this entropy is shown as seq t in fig 5 the affinity a of the internal variable is identically zero and the fields in this state are given by y yie this equilibrium state of the isolated body should not be confused with the state of the body in internal equilibrium in the presence of the internal variable i as shown in eq 136 this body has i different from ieq 6 x and the corresponding affinity a different from zero 80 c thermodynamic potentials the additivity of the entropy and energy allows us to treat our system as a collection of quasi independent subsystems so that we can develop the thermodynamics of an inho mogeneous system under the mildest possible assumption that the medium is in internal equilibrium so that its field variables w k are defined via eq 98 but the system itself is or the subsystems are not necessarily in internal equilibrium we are able to identify the thermodynamic potential for the system the field variables of the system in internal equi librium vary with time and therefore they differ from the medium s field variables they become identical only when the system is in equilibrium with the medium it is obvious from eq 98 that the product w kz k no summation implied is dimensionless because the entropy is defined as dimensionless in this work accordingly the dimensionless entropy s z can be expressed in terms of these dimensionless products it follows then that resulting thermodynamic potentials will contain these products as shown in sect xb the actual form of the thermodynamic potential function depends on the choice of the set c and requires field variables to maintain the dimensions of each term appearing in it the fields variables in the thermodynamic potentials are the field variables of the medium and not of the system as the latter are not even defined when the system in not in internal equilibrium see for example eq 56 or 63 this is true whether we consider the system or any of its many subsystems the latter are considered in sect xb this is surprising since one knows that in equilibrium thermodynamics the thermodynamic potentials are state quantities therefore they must contain all quantities related to the system it just happens that in equilibrium the field variables are identical to the medium s field variables therefore our thermodynamic potentials reduce to the standard thermodynamic potentials in equilibrium in this case they become state functions but this is not true when the system is not in equilibrium what is surprising is that this result remains true even when the system or subsystem is in internal variable the thermodynamic potentials always contain fields of the medium and not of the system or subsystem these functions have the required thermodynamic property that they can never increase in any spontaneous process as seen from eq 100 or 102 one can easily see that this property is a consequence of the convexity property of the thermodynamic potentials in 81 contrast a function obtained from thermodynamic potentials by replacing medium s fields by the body s field when the latter is in internal equilibrium does not have this required thermodynamic property an example of this is the function g t or g t from g t or g t given in eq 6 or 59 while each subsystem is in internal equilibrium so that there can be no irreversible processes inside them the irreversibility occurs due to relative motions going on among them because of the internal equilibrium each subsystem has its own internal temperature tk t pressure pk t or other conjugate field variables how are these temperatures and pressures related to the internal temperature t t and pressure p t introduced in i to answer these questions we consider their definitions in the l frame 1 t t s e p t t t s v 1 tk t sk ek pk t tk t sk vk see eq 122 for the definition of tk t and pk t let us first consider the temperature introducing rk t e ek rk t 1 we have s e k sk ek e ek k rk t tk t thus we have 1 t t k rk t tk t introducing rvk t v vk k rvk t 1 we find that p t t t k rvk t pk t tk t the same exercise can be carried out for other state variables introducing rlk t zl zlk k rlk t 1 for the l th state variable zl we find that wl t wl t t t k rlk t yk t tk t 82 d contrast with local non equilibrium thermodynamics our approach differs from the traditional local non equilibrium thermodynamics due to de groot 9 12 briefly discussed in sect iii in three important ways 1 the first one relates to the principle of additivity of energy the energy in the local non equilibrium thermodynamics is not the sum of the energies of its various part due to the presence of the mutual interaction energies expressed by r dv as seen from eq 4 indeed usually one applies local equilibrium to a volume element dv what is traditionally called a physically infinitesimal volume in that while it contains a large number of atoms the corresponding volume is still infinitesimally small such a volume is conventionally called a particle not to be confused with our usage which refers to an atom or molecule for all practical purposes it is indeed considered as a limit dv 0 it is evident that one must then consider the interaction energy r dv to account for the interaction of this volume with the rest of the system thus the local non equilibrium thermodynamics takes the additivity of entropy is taken as postulate even when the energy is not additive 2 because the volume element dv is treated infinitesimal in the local theory all ther modynamic quantities are also treated as continuous in space while this continuity is not a prerequisite in our approach 3 our approach also differs from the local non equilibrium theory in the form of the thermodynamic potentials the volume element is considered to be in internal equi librium from the start so that it has a well defined temperature pressure etc these fields are used in identifying the thermodynamic potentials for example the gibbs free energy of the particle is taken to be g t dv even if the system consisting of such particles is not in equilibrium with the medium 4 another imporatnt difference between the two approaches is that the reversible entropy change and the irreversible entropy generation in each subsystem also depends on the equilibrium state of the system the irreversible entropy generation in the local theory depends only on the current local properties 83 these differences make our approach very different from the local non equilibrium ther modynamics due to de groot 9 12 acknowledgements i would like to thank arkady leonov for a discussion on the local non equilibrium thermodynamics and him and peter wolynes for their suggestion to apply the approach of i to inhomogeneous systems i would also like to thank an anonymous referee of i who wanted the current approach to include internal dissipation appendix a relation between lab and body frames let us consider a particle of mass m in the lab frame l where it has a velocity vl and the potential energy u the lagrangian ll in this frame is given by ll 1 2 mv 2 l u let us transform to a rotating frame c which is moving with a velocity v and rotating with an angular velocity the velocity of the particle in c is given by vc and is related to vl according to vl vc v rc a 1 where rc is the coordinate of the particle in the c frame and is related to the coordinate rl of the particle in the lab frame l by rl r rc in the following it would also be convenient to consider a nonrotating frame i which is only moving with the velocity v with respect to the lab frame but whose origin coincides with that of c the lagrangian in the frame c is given by lc 1 2 m vc v rc 2 u 1 2 mv 2 c 1 2 m r c 2 mvc v mvc rc mv rc u a 2 in which we have omitted 1 2 mv 2 which is a total time derivative the canonical momentum is obtained as pc lc vc m vc v rc 84 so that the energy of the particle becomes ec pc vc lc 1 2 mv 2 c 1 2 m r c 2 mv rc u a 3 expressing vc in terms of vl from eq a 1 we find that ec el 1 2 mv 2 pl v mrc vl el 1 2 mv 2 pl v m a 4 where el 1 2 mv 2 l u pl mvl m mrc vl a 5 incidentally we also note that pc pl thus m rc pl rc pc which explains why there is no need to use l or c as a subscript in m appendix b a rotating and translating system let us now extend the previous calculation for a single particle to a system of particles of total mass m at a given instant t the system is also characterized by the number of particles and its volume for specificity we use n and v t to denote these quantities the notation should not mean that we are only considering the system here the system we have in mind is any generic system we assume that this system is translating with a velocity v t and rotating with an angular velocity t as a whole both of which can change in time for notational simplicity we will suppress the explicit t dependence of various quantities here we focus on one particular instant t we take the center of mass of this system to coincide with the origin of c so that c is fixed to the body and rotating with it in this case c represents the center of mass frame we now sum eq a 4 over all particles with the result that it is replaced by ec el p 2 2 m pl v m b 1 where we have introduced p mv pl mvl m rc pl rc pc b 2 85 here mc is the intrinsic angular momentum of the system of particles in the c frame the summation in the above formulas which are also applicable to non uniform rotation and translation of the center of mass frame c is a sum over all the particles in the system the value of ec in the c frame represents the internal energy e i of the system the equation b 1 generalizes the result given by landau and lifshitz 26 see their eq 39 13 to the case when v 6 0 the present generalization is not limited to constant rotation and translation we can express m as follows m mrc vc v rc mrc vc mrc v mrc rc in which the second sum on the right vanishes for c the center of mass frame for the same reason the third term in the second equation in eq a 3 does not contribute to the energy of the system thus we find m mrc vc mrc rc b 3 a ec 1 2 mv 2 c 1 2 m r c 2 u b 3 b we see that m mrc vc m rc 2 b 4 the first term vanishes when the motion is radial thus it is the contribution to the energy from the relative transverse motion in the c frame and will vanish if the system is stationary in the this frame the latter condition is met when the system is in internal equilibrium in accordance with theorem 1 for the center of mass frame c p pl so that the energy of the system in the frame c is given by ec el p 2 2 m m b 5 which can be rewritten as el ec p 2 2 m m b 6 using eq b 3 b we find that el ec p 2 2 m 1 2 m rc 2 mrc vc b 7 in which the last term is the contribution of the transverse motion 86 the energy of the system in the i frame in which the system has only rotation is given by ei el p 2 2 m b 8 it is obvious that ei does not depend on the velocity v thus ec ei m does not depend explicitly on v we can take ec as a function of ei and from which it follows that ec v ei v n 0 b 9 ec ei v n m b 10 all the above results are for a particular microstate of the system undergoing a hamiltonian dynamics to obtain thermodynamics of the system we need to average the above equations over all microstates using their probabilities which will be taken up in sect viii the averaging takes into account the stochastic nature of the dynamics which has not been considered in both appendices 1 p d gujrati phys rev e 81 051130 2010 p d gujrati arxiv 0910 0026 2 l d landau and e m lifshitz fluid mechanics pergamon press
