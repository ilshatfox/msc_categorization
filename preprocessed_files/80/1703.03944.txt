an introduction to completely exceptional 2 nd order scalar pdes giovanni moreno abstract in his 1954 paper about the initial value problem for 2 d hyperbolic nonlinear pdes p lax declared that he had a strong reason to believe that there must exist a well defined class of not genuinely nonlinear nonlinear pdes in 1978 g boillat coined the term completely exceptional to denote it in the case of 2 nd order nonlinear pdes he also proved that this class reduces to the class of monge ampe re equations we review here against a unified geometric background the notion of complete exceptionality the

is linear if and only if f is a solution to the system 1 2 f uij ukl 0 i j k l 1 2 of 2 nd order pdes such a remark immediately becomes less silly when one begins thinking of the variables u 11 u 12 u 22 as 2 nd order formal derivatives of a function u in two extra variables x 1 x 2 such a perspective allows us to reinterpret f as the left hand side of a scalar 2 nd order pde in u u x 1 x 2 1991

condition viz 2 2 f u ij ukl 0 i j k l 1 2 obviously 2 is satisfied by all the left hand sides of linear 2 nd order scalar pdes less obviously yet still straightforwardly there is more than just linear pdes in the solution set of 2 the curious reader may check this on the manifestly nonlinear f u 11 u 22 u 212 usually a 2 nd order scalar pde f 0 is accompanied by some initial data if one is interested in the so obtained initial value problem then the first question to answer is whether or not the initial data are characteristic here comes to help a key geometric gadget associated with f namely the principal symbol 3 s f f uij i j of f loosely speaking 3 is a symmetric tensor on a 2 dimensional space 1 by abusing the notation we will call s f a metric even though s f is controvariant and it is degenerate in the majority of the really interesting cases by line hyperplane duality 2 the null directions of this metric which are easily computed can be interpreted as tangent hyperplanes in the space of the independent variables xi s these are the characteristic hyperplane associated with the generally nonlinear equation f 0 in the geometric framework for nonlinear pdes described below characteristic hyperplanes 3 are precisely the tangent spaces to the characteristic initial data i e those for which uniqueness of the solution to the initial value problem is not guaranteed the symbol s f is an intrinsic feature of the pde f 0 in the sense that the tensors s f 1 and s f 2 are the same up to a projective factor as long as f 1 0 and f 2 0 are the same equation but the components f uij of s f may change similarly 2 can be thought of as the components of a rank 4 symmetric tensor 4 s 2 f 2 f u ij ukl i j h k let f 1 0 be a pde a surprising discovery originally obtained by g boillat 3 in 1991 and further clarified in 2017 9 is that the tensorial equation 4 5 s 2 f s f where f is such that f 0 and f 1 0 are the same equation is intrinsically associated to the pde f 1 0 and not to its particular left hand side f 1 the equation 5 is clearly satisfied by the left hand sides of linear equations indeed s f 0 and the factor of proportionality can be set to zero but its entire set of solutions is much more large in case the reader is wondering why we introduced the condition s 2 f s f by starting from the trivial equation 1 that is why we introduced a certain class of pdes 1 we prefer to leave this space unspecified in order to contain the size of this introduction 2 throughout this paper we use to denote the annihilator of a linear subspace and in particular to express line hyperplane duality 3 the literature on this subject is boundless the chief reference is chapter v of the book 5 by bryant et al but this might prove hard to the novice the paper 1 perhaps provides a slenderer introduction to the subject the reader may also have a look at 13 17 15 4 here means proportional to completely exceptional pdes 3 by weakening the condition of linearity the answer is simple because the class of linear pdes is not invariant under contactomorphism and then a larger class must exist in fact the class defined by boillat by imposing 5 is even larger that the closure of the class of the linear pdes under the action of the group of all contactomorphism the role of conctactomorphism in this context is clarified below even though p lax dealt with systems of quasi linear 1 st order pdes and he never used the term completely exceptional introduced to the author best knowledge by g boillat and t ruggeri in 1978 4 the class of pdes satisfying 5 was called completely exceptional in the sense of lax by boillat himself referring to lax s 1954 paper 12 and to this terminology we shall stick the condition s 2 f s f will always be the condition of complete exceptionality for the pde f 0 below we provide a solid geometric background to the condition of complete exception ality s 2 f s f we also explain how the fact that f satisfies s 2 f s f reflects on the behaviour of the solutions to an initial value problem associated with the pde f 0 in this short note the reader will find an answer to the below questions 1 in which sense 5 is intrinsically associated to f 0 see section 1 2 what is the set of all the solutions of 5 see section 2 3 if a solution of 5 is interpreted in its turn as a 2 nd order pde then what makes the latter exceptional amongst all 2 nd order pdes see section 3 these answers already exist scattered throughout the literature 9 3 4 8 7 6 7 the purpose of this note is precisely that of arranging them in a unified self consistent and minimalistic way 1 geometry of 2 nd order pdes and their characteristics partial differential equations together with their solutions and initial data can be conveniently formalised in terms of smooth manifolds and differential forms on them this is the core of e cartan s pioneering work which evolved into the modern theory of exterior differential systems eds 5 1 1 1 st order scalar nonlinear pdes in the present context we are interested in pdes in n independent and 1 dependent variable these taken together can be understood as the local coordinates x 1 xn u of an n 1 dimensional manifold for the purpose of studying 1 st order pdes we need to add more variables say u 1 un we thus obtain a 2 n 1 dimensional manifold henceforth denoted by m with local coordinates x 1 xn u u 1 un so far u is just another name for a coordinate and as such it does not carry any dependence upon x 1 xn whatsoever therefore even if they seem so the coordinates u 1 un are not the derivatives of u and the hypersurface 6 e f x 1 xn u u 1 un 0 m cut out by a function f c m is not a 1 st order pde in order to recover the intuition which is still obviously missing in the picture it is enough to introduce the contact form 7 du n i 1 uidxi on m the contact manifold m is an example of an eds an eds is just a manifold equipped with a set of differential forms only in our example such a fundamental role of contact manifolds in the geometric framework for pdes explains why a class of pdes needs to be closed under the group of contactomorphisms 4 g moreno the main concern in the theory of eds is to study the so called variety of integral ele ments an integral element is simply a tangent plane to m such that all the forms which define the eds together with their differentials vanish on it usually one groups inte gral elements according to their dimension for example let us study the n dimensional integral elements of m i e the n dimensional tangent planes to m such that both and d vanish on them let l be such an n dimensional integral element and let p m be the point of m the n plane l is tangent to in order to have to vanish on l we need to pick the generators of l from the hyperplane ker p tpm plainly 8 ker p span 1 p n p u 1 p un p where the vector fields i xi ui u are often called total derivatives now we can ask when an n plane of the form 9 l span i p n j 1 uij ui p on which by construction vanishes makes also d vanish observe that the new symbols uij appearing in 9 are just numeric coefficients by taking the differential of 7 and by imposing d l 0 we find the simple condition 10 u ij 0 that is the space of n dimensional integral elements tangent to p m is parametrised by n n symmetric matrices hence the totality of all n dimensional integral elements tangent to arbitrary points of m form a set henceforth denoted by m 1 naturally fibered over m with abstract fibre s 2 rn now we can finally recover the familiar understanding of a partial differential equation an integral submanifold of an eds is a submanifold u m all whose tangent spaces are integral elements in our example an n dimensional submanifold u is integral if and only if there exists a function f such that 11 u u 1 f x 1 xn u f x 1 xn ui f xi x 1 xn then the hypersurface 6 can be correctly interpreted as a 1 st order pde in the sense that f is a solution to e if and only if u 1 f is contained into e but all of this is just a paraphrase of the darboux theorem on the structure of legendrian submanifolds of a contact manifold 10 in the literature the legendrian submanifolds u 1 f are often called graphs of 1 st jets of functions 2 1 2 2 nd order scalar nonlinear pdes it is somewhat useful to refer to the integral submanifolds u of the contact eds m as candidate solutions indeed thanks to 11 candidate solutions are in a local one to one correspondence with functions in n variables a candidate solution may be thought of as a solution of the trivial equation 0 0 it becomes a solution of the nontrivial equation 6 only if it is contained into e in a sense the whole machinery so far introduced just allowed to rephrase in terms of a set theoretical inclusion the property for a function and its 1 st derivatives to satisfy a certain relation given a candidate solution u m observe that all its tangent n planes are by defintion integral elements that is points of m 1 in other words u may be as well considered as an n dimensional submanifold of m 1 if we identify each point p u completely exceptional pdes 5 with the corresponding tangent space tpu usually this is formalised by introducing a new set 12 u 1 tpu p u manifestly identical to u but contained this time into m 1 it is customary to denote u 1 f 1 simply by u 2 f and call it the graph of the 2 nd jet of f a hypersurface e m 1 is called a scalar nonlinear 2 nd order pde in n independent variables indeed in view of 9 such an hypersurface can be locally represented 5 as 13 e f f x 1 xn u u 1 un uij 0 m 1 then a candidate solution u 2 f is contained into e if and only if the function f together with its 1 st and 2 nd derivatives fulfils the relation given by f 0 once again the familiar intuition of a 2 nd order pde has been recovered so far we have just recast the well known notions of pdes and their solutions in terms of hypersurfaces in m 1 and legendrian submanifolds of m respectively in order to see the first nontrivial implication of such a reinterpretation we need to inspect the vertical geometry of the bundle m 1 m 1 3 geometry of the lagrangian grassmannian lgrn 2 n the reader may have noticed that formula 9 is not entirely accurate in the sense that not all the n planes in ker p are of that form however 9 was useful to find a local description of the fibre m 1 p that is the set of all integral n planes at p m in fact the whole of m 1 p is a topologically nontrivial compactification of the linear space of s 2 rn known as the lagrangian grassmannian and usually denoted by lgrn 2 n let us regard a symmetric matrix a s 2 rn as a linear map from rn to rn and let us extend it to a linear map a between the corresponding exterior algebras rn and rn respectively by forcing a to preserve the wedge product denote by a k the restriction of a acting between elements of degree k this is well defined since a has degree 0 for instance a 0 1 a 1 a and a n deta under obvious identifications the curious reader may also check that a n 1 a the cofactor matrix of a on the top of that each a k turns out to be symmetric that is a k s 2 k rn this way we have defined the injective map s 2 rn p n k 0 s 2 k rn 14 a 7 a 0 a 1 a n and it can be proved that lgrn 2 n is precisely the closure of its image of interestingly enough the range of the map 14 can be made smaller more precisely there exists a proper projective subspace pv n which contains the image of 14 and is min imal with respect to this property on a deeper level lgrn 2 n should be regarded as a ho mogeneous manifold of the lie group sp 2 n and v n as the irreducible sp 2 n representation realising lgrn 2 n as a projective variety in pv n 9 section 5 1 we insisted on the fact that lgrn 2 n contains the linear space s 2 rn as an open and dense subset because this point of view allows to immediately see that 15 tl lgrn 2 n s 2 rn 5 from now on the symbol e refers to a hypersurface in m 1 as in 13 and not to a hypersurface in m as in 6 6 g moreno for all l lgrn 2 n in other words the tangent geometry of lgrn 2 n is modeled by n n symmetric matrices in fact the noncanonical identification 15 becomes canonical if rn is replaced by l viz 16 tl lgrn 2 n s 2 l on the canonical identification 16 alone stands the rich geometric approach to 2 nd order pdes based on contact manifolds indeed since lgrn 2 n is the abstract fibre of m 1 the element l may be thought of as a point of m 1 hence in view of the canonical character of the indentification 16 we as well have 17 tlm 1 p s 2 l for all points p m or in an equivalent but more abstract way 18 vm 1 s 2 l observe that now we have the vertical bundle vm 1 and the tautological bundle l both over the same base m 1 formula 18 explains their global interrelationship whereby 17 captures it only on the level of a single fibre the reader must be extra careful since the same symbol l denotes both an element of m 1 as in 17 and the n dimensional bundle l m 1 whose fibre at l is by definition l itself as in 18 1 4 the symbol of a 2 nd order pde if a 2 nd order pde is understood as a hypersur face 13 in m 1 then its vertical bundle v e is a sub bundle of vm 1 of codimension 1 hence its annihilator v e is a well defined one dimensional sub bundle a k a line bundle of s 2 l called the symbol of the equation e f 0 in practice one can use f to find a noncanonical generator of such a line bundle usually denoted by s f viz 19 vle span sl f ps 2 l equation 19 intrinsically defines s f up to a projective factor in local coordinates the definition of sl f is precisely the one given by 3 where now the derivatives of f have to be evaluated at the symmetric n n matrix corresponding to the lagrangian n plane l via identification 9 the reader should not forget that in spite of the abstract flavour of the definition 19 of the symbol its representative s f is easily computed now it is clear what is the n dimensional linear space mentioned in the introduction for n 2 such that the symbol is a tensor over it it is precisely l then the elements i appearing in 3 represent a basis of l in compliance with 9 indeed given l it is possible to choose contact coordinates in such a way that uij 0 1 5 characteristics of a 2 nd order pde if solutions of 13 are understood as la grangian submanifolds u m such that u 1 m then an initial condition must be understood as an n 1 dimensional 6 integral submanifold m of the contact eds m an initial value problem looks now as simple as a pair e a candidate solu tion u 1 f is then a solution to the initial value problem e if and only if u 2 f e and also 20 u 1 f observe that once again the formalism allowed to express everything in terms of set theoretical inclusions in local coordinates u 1 f means that the values of f and its 1 st derivatives are assigned over an hypersurface in the space x 1 xn of the independent variables thus recovering the familiar picture of an initial condition 6 see 13 for a thorough discussion on the geometry of cauchy data for nonlinear pdes completely exceptional pdes 7 let p and l e such that 21 tp l observe that l is always of the form l tpu 1 f for some candidate solution u 1 f so that 21 is exaclty the infinitesimal version of 20 at p accordingly we should think of l as an infinitesimal solution of e and we should think of tp as an infinitesimal initial datum at p the above introduced symbol s f allows to answer the following question is l the unique infinitesimal solution passing through that infinitesimal initial datum the answer is simple and operative regard tp as a line in l i e as a point of pl since pl contains the quadric hypersurface of equation sl f 0 see 19 there are only two options either tp belong to that quadric or it doesn t in the first case the answer is negative and tp is a characteristic hyperplane due to its importance the quadric sl f 0 is called the characteritic variety of e at l a line pl that is an hyperplane in l is characteristic if it belongs to the characteristic variety in conclusion we have obtained a natural geometric picture of ill defined infinitesimal initial value problems the characteristic lines are the normals to the tagent hyperplanes to those initial data for which the cauchy kowalevskaya theorem fails in uniqueness 17 section 1 2 it is worth observing that any line pl 0 i e an hyperplane l 0 determines a curve 22 1 l m 1 l in m 1 passing through l 0 then the reader may verify that is characteristic at l 0 i e it lies in the quadric sl 0 f 0 if and only if the curve 1 is tangent to e at l 0 this alternative interpretation immediately leads us to another definition if the curve 1 is entirely contained into e then is a strong characteristic line 1 section 3 1 1 6 the test s 2 f s f we are now ready to motivate the rank 4 tensor s 2 f introduced by 4 and to explain the condition 5 the quickest way to get to s 2 f inevitably sacrifices coordinate independence the construction goes as follows regard the components of the tensor 3 as functions on m 1 and replace each of them by its own symbol the result 23 s f uij i j interpreted as a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 is precisely 4 now both s f and s 2 f are elements of the polynomial algebra s l and as such it is legitimate to ask whether the latter is proportional to the former that is condition 5 makes sense so we can use it to single out a nontrivial class of 2 nd order pdes definition 1 1 the equation e passes the test s 2 f s f if and only if the condition 5 is satisfied by some f such that f 0 e it is worth stressing that it is the equation e cut out by f which passes the test s 2 f s f and not f itself see 9 proposition 3 6 the collection of all 2 nd order pdes passing this test is precisely the nontrivial class of 2 nd order pdes introduced by g boillat 3 following p lax s original intuition that there should exists a class of nonlinear pdes not genuinely nonlinear by construction this class is automatically invariant under the symmetry group of the theory that is the group of all contactomorphisms of m this is the class of completely exceptional scalar nonlinear 2 nd order pdes 8 g moreno 2 multidimensional monge ampe re equations since a linear pde manifestly passes the test s 2 f s f it seems natural to suspect that the class of completely exceptional pdes is the closure under the action of the group of contactomorphisms of m of the class of linear pdes we call such a closure the class of linearisable pdes 14 but life is slightly harder and interesting than that linearisable pdes form a proper subclass in the class of completely exceptional pdes the purpose of this section is to show that the latter coincides with the class of multidimensional monge ampe re equations on m a monge ampe re equation on m can be seen as an eds on m namely 24 m where n m is an n form on m recall that the set of n dimensional integral elements of the contact eds m is the bundle m 1 m hence the set of the integral elements of the eds 24 will be a proper subset of m 1 in fact it will be a hypersurface henceforth denoted by e that is a 2 nd order pde according to our understanding see section 1 2 since we are looking for n dimensional integral elements the condition d l 0 is vacuous that is we are just imposing the unique condition l 0 on the integral elements of m this explains the codimension one the definition of monge ampe re equations as hypersurfaces of the form e was given in 1978 by v lychagin 11 alternatively monge ampe re equations can be defined as hyperplane sections of the fibres of m 1 recall from section 1 3 that each fibre m 1 p of the bundle m 1 m is a projective variety in pv n then one can define monge ampe re equations as the codimension one sub bundles e m 1 such that each fibre ep is the intersection of m 1 p with an hyperplane of pv n such intersection is called an hyperplane section of the lagrangian grassmannian m 1 p this definition is by no means new it is only formulated in an abstract way bearing in mind the embedding 14 we easily see that a hyperplane section of m 1 p is locally given by a unique linear relation between the minors of the hessian matrix a uij p of u computed at p a simple exercise of multilinear algebra by letting the point p vary on m we obtain the coordinate expression of the left hand side of monge ampe re equations viz 25 f b 0 b ij 1 uij b 2 2 2 minors b ij n 1 u ij bn det uij where now b 0 b ij 1 bn are functions on m the local expression 25 is the classical way multidimensional monge ampe re equations are introduced its equivalent interpre tation in terms of hyperplane sections came later see e g 1 section 3 2 formula 25 shows that linear equations are in particular monge ampe re equations enough to set b 2 b 3 bn 0 less evident is that if f is of the form 25 then s 2 f s f the final result of this section tells precisely what are the solutions to the equation 5 this result was firstly proved by g boillat 3 and re examined recently 9 theorem 2 1 the 2 nd order pde e f 0 passes the test s 2 f s f see definition 1 1 if and only if e is a monge ampe re equation from an abstract standpoint that is by giving up any interpretation of the objects at play in terms of nonlinear pdes the equation s 2 f s f is the flatness condition for a family of hypersurface in the lagrangian grassmannian by reprising the first very completely exceptional pdes 9 trivial equation of this paper 1 we may observe that 26 2 q za zb 0 is the condition for the hypersurface q 0 in pv n to be a hyperplane the za s are projective coordinates and q is a homogeneous polynomial since lgrn 2 n pv n it is natural to ask how the very trivial condition 26 looks like if one knows only the restriction f q lgrn 2 n the nontrivial 7 answer is precisely s 2 f s f the subtle point is that equation 26 recognises when q is linear in the coordinates za s whereas s 2 f s f recognises when f is linear in the minors of the symmetric n n matrix uij that is when f is of the form 25 observe that as a function of the entries of uij a function f as in 25 is nonhomogeneously of degree n now we start thinking at a solution f of the equation s 2 f s f as the left hand side of a 2 nd order pde itself we ask ourselves what makes f so special amongst all possible left hand sides of 2 nd order pdes the answer to this question is in fact the original 1954 observation by p lax there exist certain scalar generally nonlinear 2 nd order pdes that are characterised by an exceptional behaviour of their solutions in continuity with p lax s work g boillat later called them completely exceptional and now we know that this class coincides precisely with the class of monge ampe re equations 9 the modern geometric reinterpretation of p lax s class of equations succinctly cap tured by the condition s 2 f s f by no means diminishes the value of his work on the contrary it shows that inside this class whose existence follows from abstract representation theoretic arguments one finds several different pdes an yet all these pdes share an important and physically meaningful property their solutions display a sort of linear behaviour this property and its link with the condition s 2 f s f will be explained in the last section below 3 discontinuity waves shock waves and completely exceptional pdes from now on we assume n 2 and we deal only with hyperbolic pdes this is necessary to shorten the distances between the original p lax g boillat s idea of a completely exceptional 2 nd order pde and the modern interpretation of monge ampe re equations 3 1 hyperbolic 2 nd order pdes all whose characteristics are strong let then e f 0 be a 2 dimensional hyperbolic 2 nd order pde in this case m is a 5 dimensional contact manifold and the generic fibre of m 1 is the 3 dimensional la grangian grassmannian lgr 2 4 the irreducible sp 4 module v 2 is 5 dimensional and hence pv 2 p 4 it is known that lgr 2 4 is a smooth quadric hypersurface called lie quadric and a conformal manifold as well 16 a remarkable and general property of lagrangian grassmannians is that the curves 1 cf 22 are straight lines in the projective space pv n suppose that pl is a characteristic of e at l e then by definition see the end of section 1 5 the curve 1 is tangent to e at l now we use the hyperbolicity of e that is the fact that sl f has two distinct roots the characteristic variety see section 1 5 is then a degenerate quadric namely the union 1 2 l of two lines since the polynomial sl f depends on l e the dependency of i on l should be stressed and from now on we write i l and let i be either 1 or 2 consequently to any infinitesimal solution l e we can can associate a line 1 i l in p 4 i e we have a sort of gauss map defined on e and taking its 7 see 9 section 5 for a taste of the techniques involved 10 g moreno values in the grassmannian of all projectives lines in p 4 as such the derivative of the map l 7 1 i l can be computed and this is the crucial point along the curve 1 i l itself at the point l without loss of generality let us assume that 1 i l passes through l for t 0 and let 1 i l 0 denote its velocity thereby theorem 3 1 the equation 27 1 i l 0 1 i 0 is satisfied for all l e f 0 if and only if s 2 f s f theorem 3 1 is the last step towards our main purpose which is to prove that the test s 2 f s f is equivalent to original lax s condition of complete exceptionality indeed as we will show in the next subsection in appropriate local coordinates the condition 27 takes precisely the form of lax s condition the proof of theorem 3 1 is not hard and can be found in 9 corollary 3 8 here we can provide an intuitive explanation the lines i are just the roots of the polynomial s f but in our hypothesis of hyperbolicity knowing the polynomial is exactly the same as knowing both its roots up to a projective factor but this does not matter cf 19 the condition 27 means that these roots do not vary along some special directions de termined by the roots themselves in a sense the condition s 2 f s f is dual to 27 instead of taking a particular derivative of the roots we took the whole differential of the corresponding polynomial and then we imposed its vanishing on the zero locus of the polynomial itself i e the same special directions as before it is worth stressing how the reformulation of 27 as s 2 f s f freed us from the necessity of a complete de composable polynomial hyperbolicity condition is however indispensable for interpreting s 2 f s f in terms of behaviour of solutions before recalling p lax s original observation let us comment further on the condition 27 stressing a detail which could not be appreciated when reformulated as s 2 f s f the equation 27 was deliberately laid down in a form which is reminiscent of the equation of geodesics curves whose speed is constant along the curves themselves indeed if 27 vanish identically it means that the family l 7 1 i l of projective lines in p 4 passes with speed zero through the point l 0 of 1 i l 0 which is now understood as a vertical curve tangent to e in other words for a fixed l 0 e the curve 1 i l 0 coincides for all points l 1 i l 0 with the curve 1 i l associated to l as such 1 i l 0 is tangent to e in all its points and hence is entirely contained into e we have therefore proved that if 27 is identically satisfied for all l e then any characteristic of e is a strong characteristic the converse is also true and even easier to prove 1 theorem 5 9 the conclusion of this subsection is that for hyperbolic pdes the condition s 2 f s f can be recast in a somewhat more tangible form a pde satisfies it if and only if all its characteristics are strong characteristics we see then how an abstractly defined class of pdes is characterised by a special behaviour of their characteristics which are ultimately linked to questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions it is only in p lax s original formulation that one can see how actual solutions behave 3 2 the not genuinely nonlinear nonlinear pdes in the sense of p lax for n 2 the symbol 3 computed at l e reads 28 s f fuxx 2 x fuxy x y fuyy 2 y completely exceptional pdes 11 recall that x and y are the generators of l and that s f is a quadratic polynomial on l see section 1 4 a line 8 span dx dy pl is characteristic iff 29 fuxx 2 fuxy fuyy 2 0 that is assuming 6 0 30 fuxx fuxy fuyy 2 0 where the function 9 is the characteristic speed according to p lax by the hyperbolicity assumption there are two functions i i 1 2 such that 31 i l span dx i l dy i 1 2 recall see section 3 1 above that the union 1 l 2 l is precisely the zero set of sl f consider then the curves 1 i l passing through l at time 0 and compute their speed at 0 it is a simple exercise 9 proposition 2 5 to prove that 32 1 i l 0 uxx i l uxy 2 i l uyy formulae 31 and 32 allows us to write down the condition 27 in terms of the charac teristic speed indeed locally 1 i is completely characterised by the characteristic speed i and hence instead of asking that the derivative of the former be zero we may require the derivative of the latter be zero in other words 27 is equivalent to 33 1 i l 0 i 0 that is 34 i uxx i i uxy 2 i i uyy 0 i 1 2 equation 34 is the local counterpart of s 2 f s f as can be found in 9 equation 14 or 8 equation 5 its derivation as presented here is however antihistorical since 34 was formulated decades before s 2 f s f observe the local and coordinate dependent nature of 34 as opposed to the intrinsic character of s 2 f s f however in the formulation 34 there enter the characteristic speeds i and these allow for a tangible interpretation of complete exceptionality in terms of behaviour of solutions in his 1954 paper 12 p lax was interested in the behaviour of solutions of certain 1 st order hyperbolic systems of pdes though he suspected and postulate the existence of a distinguished class of such pdes the problem whether or not a special linear behaviour of the solutions to a nonlinear pde could unambiguously define a class of pdes was marginal to him he was mainly interested in the phenomenon of development of shocks out of weak discontinuities and his key remark was that discontinuities propagates along characteristics cf theorem 3 1 in the present present context his original remarks may be recast as follows let us interpreted a small difference 1 i l 1 i l 0 as the jump in the 1 st derivatives of a contin uous and almost everywhere smooth solution of e what he called a weak discontinuity let us call this difference simply as in 8 according to the understanding of a charac teristic as an infinitesimal ill defined initial value problem a weak discontinuity can be obtained by gluing two pieces belonging to different solutions passing through the same characteristic initial datum see figure 1 but with different values of normal deriva tives the discrepancy between the tangent spaces l 1 i l 0 and l 1 i l of the two solutions passing through the same initial datum i l is measured infinitesimally 8 as the reader may have guessed dx and dy are dual to x and y respectively 9 we often neglect stressing the dependency upon l e of the quantities at play 12 g moreno u 1 u 2 u 3 figure 1 if two smooth solutions say u 1 and u 2 are combined a nondif ferentiable solution u 3 is obtained a weak discontinuity by construction the locus where u 3 is singular corresponds to characteristic initial data u 1 1 2 t p u 2 t p u tp t p t p t p u 0 t p figure 2 if the steady state solution u 0 is glued with another solution ui along then a weak discontinuity is obtained the jump measure that the discrepancy between the corresponding tangent spaces if is free to grow then a weak discontinuity may continuously evolve into a shock a typical nonlinear phenomenon u 1 u 2 figure 3 a shock is a discontinuous solution where the very value of the solution experiences a jump along by the jump see figure 2 the infinitesimal version of is precisely the tangent vector 1 i l 0 which in view of 32 is fully described by the value i l now we can rephrase the definition of completely exceptional pdes implicitly present in p lax s paper 12 a completely exceptional pdes is a nonlinear pdes whose weak discontinuities never evolve into shocks in a finite time 10 a shocks is a solution almost everywhere smooth but not even continuous along characteristics see figure 3 intu itively this amounts at requiring the jump to be constant along the characteristics themselves which immediately translates into 34 which in turn is equivalent to 27 10 by time here we mean a field transversal to the wavefronts that is characteristic surfaces completely exceptional pdes 13 which is a particular case of the condition s 2 f s f for hyperbolic pdes so all definitions are equivalent on their common ground 3 3 concluding remarks we have proved that the class of 2 nd order scalar nonlinear pdes passing the test s 2 f s f is an enlargement of the class of quasi linear pdes in oder to achieve this enlargement is it however not enough to apply all possible contactomorphism to the quasi linear pdes because this generates a proper sub class the correct interpretation of the pdes e f 0 such that s 2 f s f is as those nonlinear pdes displaying a linear behaviour in their solutions meaning that weak discontinuities never evolve into shocks a typical feature of linear pdes it is truly remarkable that p lax s class of completely exceptional pdes turned out to coincide with the class of monge ampe re equations which are defined in purely algebraic terms as families of hyperplane sections of the lagrangian grassmannian acknowledgements this note is an adaptation of the poster titled a representation theoretic characteri sation of completely exceptional second order
