consisting of a system such as a glass surrounded by an extremely large medium to show that the instantaneous absolute temperature t t thermodynamic entropy s t 0 t and enthalpy h t 0 t of decrease in any isothermal relaxation towards their respective equilibrium values t 0 seq t 0 and heq t 0 under isobaric cooling the decrease of the thermodynamic entropy and enthalpy during relaxation in vitrification is consistent with non negative temperature t t the gibbs statistical entropy also conforms to the above relaxation behavior in a glass which however is contrary to the conjecture by gupta mauro and coworkers that the glass transition and the structural relaxation during vitrification are inverse to each other this is then supported by computation in which their statis tical entropy s t 0 t drops below seq t 0 during the glass transition and then increases towards it during isothermal relaxation however they do not establish that the entropy loss during the glass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to maintain the second law these authors use a novel statistical formulation s t 0 t of entropy based on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate but do not compare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy s t 0 t the formulation is designed to show the entropy loss its subsequent rise not only contradicts our result but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative abso lute temperature to understand these puzzling results and the above conjecture we have carried out a critical evaluation of their unconventional approach we find that the inverse conjecture is neither supported by their approach nor by the second law the zero entropy microstate conjecture is only consistent with s t 0 t 0 at all temperatures not just at absolute zero and is found to have no scientific merit we show that the maximum entropy gain of the medium during the glass transition invalidates the entropy loss conjecture after pointing out other misleading confusing and highly exaggerated statements in their work we finally conclude that their unconventional statistical approach and computational scheme are not appropriate for glasses electronic address pdg uakron edu 2 mailto pdg uakron edu i introduction a conventional approach ca to glass transition in a recent paper 1 we have studied a homogeneous non equilibrium system sur rounded by an extremely large medium the work has been extended to also cover inhomogeneous systems and internal variables 2 the combined system 0 forms an iso lated system see fig 1 we apply the second law to the isolated system to describe the behavior of the non equilibrium system according to the second law 3 ds 0 t dt ds t dt ds t dt 0 1 where s 0 t s t and s t denote the entropy of 0 and respectively at time t in this work quantities pertaining to 0 have the suffix 0 the system have no suffix and have a tilde for 0 all of its additive observables variables that can be controlled by the observer such as its energy e 0 volume v 0 number of particles n 0 etc are constant in time these observables also identify the macrostate of 0 it is clear that for some homogeneous 0 the variation of its instantaneous entropy s 0 t cannot be explained by the dependence of the latter on its constant observables the variation can only be explained by assuming the dependence of s 0 t on additive internal variables variables that cannot be controlled by the observer that vary in time as s 0 t approaches its maximum value for an inhomogeneous 0 the variation of its entropy s 0 t can be explained by the way the inhomogeneity disappears 2 as it approaches equilibrium the inhomogeneity gives rise to induced internal variables see below one may not require any additional internal variable thus if we consider 0 to consist of and as we do in this work it is no longer a homogeneous system as long as is not in equilibrium with the medium thus it is possible to consider 0 without any internal variable as was the case studied in 1 we discover that the instantaneous values of its fields temperature t t pressure p t etc are in general different from those of the medium t 0 p 0 etc see also bouchbinder and langer 4 but the most surprising result of the mathematical analysis is that the instantaneous conjugate variables the entropy s t the volume v t etc play the role of inhomogeneity induced internal variables with the corresponding affinity 1 2 5 8 respectively related to the deviation t t t 0 p t p 0 etc see eqs 14 and 15 as a non equilibrium system at fixed t 0 p 0 of the medium strives to come to equilibrium 3 system t t p t medium t p 0 0 0 fig 1 schematic representation of a macroscopically large system and an extremely large medium surrounding it to form an isolated system 0 the system is a very small part of 0 the medium is described by its fixed fields t 0 p 0 etc while the system when it is in internal equilibrium see text is characterized by t t p t etc it undergoes relaxation during which its instantaneous fields t t p t etc continue to change at the completion of relaxation the affinities vanish so that t t t 0 p t p 0 etc as expected in an isobaric process which is of central interest to us here we will assume that the system is always in mechanical equilibrium so that its pressure p t is always equal to p 0 at all temperatures and all times however there is normally no thermal equilibrium so that the instantaneous temperature t t of the system is different from t 0 1 2 4 it is found that during relaxation the instantaneous entropy s t of the system continues to decrease in an isobaric cooling experiment such as vitrification the entropy of glass 1 see fig 2 approaches see the downward arrows that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid entropy seq shown by the solid curve from above during relaxation s t 0 p 0 t ca s eq t 0 p 0 2 where we have also exhibited the temperature of the medium being in equilibrium we do not consider possible crystallization here the supercooled liquid cannot have any relaxation it will be our practice to not exhibit t

off its equilibrium state whose location depends on the rate of cooling structures appear to freeze over an extremely long period of time at and below t 0 g see text the transition region between t 0 g and t 0 g over which the liquid turns into a glass has been exaggerated to highlight the point that the glass transition is not a sharp point for all temperatures t 0 t 0 g any non equilibrium state along the dotted and dashed curves undergoes structural relaxation in time towards the supercooled liquid the two vertical downward arrows show isothermal constant medium temperature t 0 structural relaxation at two different temperatures in glass 1 during which the entropy s t 0 t decreases in time as shown by the downward arrows for glass 2 the entropy s t 0 t must increase during isothermal structural relaxation during the relaxation the temperature t t of the system also decreases towards the temperature of the medium in both glasses the entropy of the supercooled liquid is shown to extrapolate to zero per our assumption but that of glass 1 to a non zero value and of glass 2 to zero at absolute zero the possibility of an ideal glass transition which does not affect our conclusion will result in a singular form of the solid curve exhibit them as we will mostly consider an isobaric process we will not exhibit p 0 in the argument in an isobaric heating experiment the entropy will increase during relaxation such a behavior of the entropy during relaxation will be called the conventional behavior in this work and our approach the conventional approach ca as it follows from classical 5 thermodynamics 1 2 5 7 this then explains the symbol over the arrow in eq 2 and the header of this subsection the behavior appears to be the right behavior for the entropy in an isobaric process as the entropy must be an increasing function of the enthalpy with the slope given by s t h t p 1 t t 0 3 see eq 23 it is well known that the enthalpy falls rises during isobaric cooling heating 8 the analysis in our previous work 1 2 is carried out for any non equilibrium system it is therefore also applicable to glasses where one must in addition make a distinction between fast and slow processes we have considered the issue of the fictive temperature in glasses in our work 1 where such a distinction has been made b unconventional approach uca to glass transitions in a series of papers 9 11 gupta mauro and coworkers to be collectively denoted in short by gmc here have developed a description of glasses without using any internal variables or any fictive temperature even the fictive temperature or pressure which some people treat as an internal variable is not considered in their theoretical development notwithstanding the fact that they are used when gmc consider experimental data their conclusion is that their statistical entropy s t 0 t for the glass increases during relaxation towards seq s t 0 t uca s eq t 0 4 see glass 2 and the portion of the upward thick arrow in fig 2 above the horizontal dash the latter is located at the value of the glass 2 entropy in the following we will use s for the statistical entropy used by gmc to distinguish it from the thermodynamic or the gibbs statistical entropy s used in our approach during the glass transition the entropy s t falls below seq of the supercooled liquid in this approach thus they suggest that the glass transition and relaxation are inverse processes they also take their glass as homogeneous just as we have done in our earlier work 1 the difference is that their glass is identified by its temperature t 0 pressure p 0 and its history thus they make no distinction between the instantaneous temperature of the glass and the external temperature of the medium as the above mentioned affinities vanish s t and v t etc do not play the role of internal variables internal variables are normally used in traditional non equilibrium 6 thermodynamics 1 2 5 7 although they are very hard to identify and even harder really impossible to control for the application of internal variables to glasses we refer the reader to nemilov 8 in the absence of any internal variable the approximation in eq 3 turns into an identity 1 see also eq 28 as the behavior of the entropy during relaxation does not obey eq 28 we will call their approach the unconventional approach uca in this work this explains the symbol over the arrow in eq 4 and the header of this subsection one can understand the drop gts t in the entropy of glass 2 during a glass transition provided the entropy of the medium goes up by gts t to compensate the loss and some more so that the entropy of 0 does not decrease gts 0 t 0 t gts t 0 t gts t 0 t 0 5 during the glass transition however the authors have not discussed this issue at all this is not surprising as they neither include any medium in their discussion nor do they consider an isolated system for which eq 1 holds we will always consider as a part of the isolated system 0 and apply eq 1 to the latter this will then allow us to evaluate gts t it is the magnitude of gts t that would determine whether the entropy of the glass remains above or below seq of the supercooled liquid as the entropy change of the medium is completely reversible its evaluation will not suffer from any irreversibility going on in 0 this is the major benefit of investigating a glass as part of 0 both glasses begin to deviate from the equilibrium supercooled liquid at t 0 g but their structures are not yet frozen they freeze over a long period of time t obs at a lower temperature t 0 g to form an amorphous solid to be identified as a glass glass 1 and glass 2 the location of t 0 g is determined by the choice of obs indeed t 0 g decreases with increasing obs over the transition region between these two temperatures the internal variables gradually change form their equilibrium values at t 0 g to their frozen values at t 0 g in the absence of any internal variable fixing the temperature and pressure fixes the instantaneous state as the uca glass glass 2 is homogeneous and has the same constant temperature and pressure as the medium it appears then that there cannot be any heat transfer between and if true then during an isothermal relaxation constant t 0 of the medium under isobaric condition the first law with dq t 0 t uca 0 and no internal variables yields de t 0 t uca p 0 dv t 0 t 0 7 this implies that dv t 0 t 0 during relaxation which is most certainly not a rule in glasses another important aspect of glass transition as has become apparent from recent work is the violation of the principle of detailed balance and of the fluctuation disspation theorem 12 such as the equivalence of the heat capacity with enthalpy fluctuations but the theorem is shown to be valid in uca 11 which is quite surprising faced with these hard to understand consequences and the conflict with our own re sults we decided to examine the basic assumptions in the unconventional approach these assumptions to the best of our reading of their work are not properly and adequately justified so far by gmc in many cases they are simply stated as facts alongside several statements that are either exaggerations or are outright false therefore we will treat them as conjectures and investigate whether we can justify them either rigorously or on physical grounds we defer to the next section these conjectures and the role they play in the logical development of uca we should mention at this point that some aspects of uca have already been criticized by other authors 13 19 in particular goldstein 13 see also 17 18 demonstrated that the entropy loss during the glass transition violates the second law to this gmc responded by suggesting that the process of glass formation is not governed by the second law 20 this is a surprising response as the second law is supposed to govern all processes but quite understandable as gmc have a very unconventional view of the second law we do not get into this debate by avoiding the issue altogether we focus on an isolated system 0 where there cannot be any dispute about the second law see eq 1 in that sense our work differs from other attempts 13 14 19 in our investigation which is at a fundamental level we look at all the underlying assumptions of uca to see if they can be justified so that uca could become an acceptable theory we only consider the thermodynamic entropy during this part of our investigation so we do not get confused by which statistical entropy formulation is appropriate to study vitrification once we settle the issues by using the thermodynamic entropy we turn to the statistical formulation of entropy to assess the notion of statistical entropy gmc have advocated it is our belief that the unconventional view of the second law and of the statistical entropy form the basis of uca which has been justified in various publications by following the logical steps listed below 8 uca 1 the use of equilibrium thermodynamics using calorimetric data cannot determine the entropy of the glass uca 2 thus there is no reason for the residual entropy to exist at absolute zero uca 3 the entropy of a single microstate is zero as a glass is in one microstate at absolute zero its entropy must be zero in accordance with the third law uca 4 the glass undergoes spontaneous relaxation during which the entropy increases and reaches that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid given by the solid curve in fig 2 from below uca 5 the entropy drop due to the loss of ergodicity and the spontaneous relaxation with entropy increase are therefore inverse processes uca 6 a calculation method for the entropy is developed to show drop in the entropy during the glass transition region see glass 2 in fig 2 so that the calculated entropy shows no residual entropy at absolute zero it is important to understand their final conclusion the so called inverse relationship uca 5 and to see if it and all of its underlying assumptions uca 1 uca 4 are consistent with the second law the only fundamental law of nature that is accepted by all including gmc various conjectures leading to uca 5 seem not to be adequately answered so far by gmc this deficiency by itself does not mean that uca is unfounded but it does mean that it requires closer scrutiny which forms the basis of this investigation these authors invariably consider their system the glass at fixed t 0 and p 0 which means that it is not an isolated system rather it is surrounded by see fig 1 in the following we will call their system an open system knowing very well that this is not the customary usage we believe that this will not cause any confusion as gmc constantly appeal to the second law in terms of the entropy of the system the most convenient way to examine their approach is to focus on the isolated system 0 in which the glass will be a possible state of the system this allows us to examine their approach at the most fundamental level 9 c summary of results we summarize our conclusions that follow from the application of the second law in terms of entropy to an isolated system we only consider vitrification in the rest of the work we agree with uca 1 but we find uca 2 unsubstantiated indeed we find the calorimetrically obtained sexpt t 0 forms a lower bound to the entropy s t 0 so that the residual entropy has a lower bound sexpt t 0 at absolute zero the latter entropy is usually non negative so that the residual entropy must be even larger than this such a glass cannot satisfy the third law which leads to uca 3 being invalid indeed if there is ever any conflict between the second and the third law it is the former that supersedes in an isothermal relaxation the entropy actually decreases towards the equilibrated supercooled liquid entropy thus invalidating uca 4 however the irreversible entropy generation remains non negative in accordance with the second law gmc do not recognize the importance of the irreversible entropy generation for the second law and mistakenly ascribe its universal non negative aspect to the entropy of the system following uca we find that s t 0 all times including t 0 when the external condition such as the temperature of the system is changed this is inconsistent with uca 5 even if we follow uca conjecture 3 see sect ii although it is inconsistent with the first part we find that the entropy now increases at t 0 and reaches that of glass 2 at t tobs the glass transition occurs at this instant if the external condition of the system is disturbed somehow if it is not disturbed the entropy would continue to increase thus the entropy is always increasing for t 0 in uca in both cases we do not find that there is any justification in calling the glass transition and relaxation to be inverse processes in uca thus uca 5 is not a consequence of the previous steps uca 1 uca 4 just because gmc have provided a computational scheme to support their invalid conclusion cannot be considered a proof of the validity of uca we find that uca misses out many important aspects of non equilibrium systems such as their temperature pressure etc being different from those of the medium absence of any internal variables to capture additional irreversible entropy generation the failure of the fluctuation dissipation theorem etc 10 ii important conjectures in uca as the recent work from gmc is expected to represent their most up to date and current state of understanding of various issues we will mostly focus on their recent work 11 for an understanding of the technical aspect of their approach the cornerstone of which is that it treats structural relaxations as the inverse of the glass transition 11 conjecture 1 the inverse of the glass transition is structural relaxation which involves a restoration of ergodicity as a glass spontaneously approaches the liquid state this sponta neous relaxation process is called a unifying process and must entail an increase in entropy as the observation time constraint is lifted the decrease in entropy during glass transition to that of glass 2 is justified on the basis of a seemingly innocuous conjecture about the effect of confinement to an ergodic component stated as a fact 11 conjecture 2 the loss of ergodicity at the glass transition necessarily involves a loss of configurational entropy since this causes the system to be confined to a subset of the overall phase space at absolute zero any glass is confined to one and only one microstate so the configurational entropy of a glass is necessarily zero in accordance with the third law and the principle of causality in vitrification the entropy does decrease this is most clearly seen by quenching the supercooled liquid from a temperature just above t 0 g to a below t 0 g see fig 2 the decrease is shown by the dashed downward arrow to b which represents the entropy of glass 1 that stays above seq a similar drop of much higher value occurs for glass 2 both glasses seem to conform to the first part of the conjecture therefore this part cannot be the defining characteristics of ergodicity loss or uca it is merely a consequence of a positive heat capacity and nothing more and has nothing to do with ergodicity loss whether the loss is big enough to satisfy eq 4 is never demonstrated as they have not calculated the entropy gain gts t 0 t of the medium the second half of the conjecture requires the entropy to vanish at absolute zero so the entropy of the uca glass is given by the dashed curve glass 2 in fig 2 and not by the dotted curve glass 1 thus uca requires the entropy to drop below seq of the equilibrated supercooled liquid and requires evaluating gts t 0 t to substantiate it this part of the conjecture is based on the following conjecture 9 11 conjecture 3 an instantaneous measurement causes the system to collapse into a single microstate i with probability pi t in the limit of zero observation time the system is confined to one and only one microstate and the observed entropy is necessarily zero however the entropy becomes positive for any finite observation time obs since transitions between microstates are not strictly forbidden except at absolute zero barring quantum tun neling the conjecture refers to a system collapsing into one out of many microstates and asserts as a fact that the entropy of a microstate is identically zero without any supporting justification this creates some conceptual problems at each instant of time t any system not necessarily a glass only is going to be in some microstate it of course we do not know which microstate it would be in at that instance if we make an instantaneous measure ment the system will remain in that microstate there is no collapse of the microstate even the macrostate which is by definition the collection of all relevant microstates along with their probabilities does not have time to change because the probability distribution pi t does not change indeed one does not need to make any measurement on the system to conclude the system to collapse into a single microstate at each instance the system is going to be in some microstate if we interpret a measurement as something that instantaneously alters the external condition such as the fields of the medium then such an instantaneous move measurement will probe the instantaneous microstate of the system the statistical entropy of the system s t 0 at each instant and therefore at all times in accordance with conjecture 3 this is true even if the system is an isolated system not in equilibrium this concept of statistical entropy in uca is in direct contradiction with the second law in eq 1 according to which the thermodynamic entropy s 0 t is not constant in time thus the conjecture needs some justification which gmc have not provided so far in particular it allows us to make the following remark 4 the statistical concept of entropy used by gmc in the above conjecture has nothing to do with the thermodynamic entropy used in eq 1 another conceptual problem is that the statistical entropy is defined for a macrostate as an average quantity over all microstates see eq 29 if it happens that a certain macrostate consists of a single microstate whose probability must be p t 1 then the 12 statistical entropy of that macrostate such as a completely ordered crystal is certainly zero but what does one mean by the statistical entropy an average quantity of a microstate what averaging does one perform for a microstate this issue is never addressed by gmc except by the above conjecture and by an appeal to the boltzmann entropy formulation s t lnw t we set kb 1 which requires the number of microstates w t forming the macrostate this is evident from 11 conjecture 5 boltzmann s definition of entropy is the only one valid and consistent with the second law for non equilibrium system they take w t 1 for a single microstate at all temperatures even if there may be other possible microstates and argue for zero entropy thus the instantaneous statistical entropy will always be zero at all times and at all temperatures since the system is in a single microstate at each instant the idea of introducing an instantaneous measurement is highly appropriate as we need to measure instantaneous values of the observables no measuring apparatus will ever measure the instantaneous entropy its value can only be inferred indirectly thus entropy is not an observable in the same sense as the mechanical variables such as energy volume etc are it is a thermodynamic quantity which has been given a statistical interpretation in statistical mechanics despite this gmc argue that when the measurement takes some non zero time the statistical entropy increases with the duration of measurement however gmc never clarify if the measurement gives an accumulated value or the average value of any quantity the first option is counter intuitive as this suggests that the value of the energy by such a measurement will increase with the duration of the measurement the second option seems reasonable as the value of the measurement will give an average energy this then suggests that since at each instant during the measurement the system is in a single microstate so that its entropy is zero the measurement will still result in a zero entropy why does it increase even if we adopt the first option then the measured entropy would still be zero as accumulating zero always gives zero no explanation is offered by gmc for this part of the conjecture recall that one cannot appeal to the second law which uses the thermodynamic entropy while gmc use their statistical entropy whose equivalence with the thermodynamic entropy is never shown by them we have addressed this issue elsewhere 15 16 21 22 with a very different conclusion we find see sect v that the statistical entropy contribution of a microstate i is 13 ln pi t which is inconsistent with the above conjecture thus we need to understand the basis of their conjecture this conjecture is amplified by the following two inter connected conjectures 10 conjecture 6 with boltzmann s definition the entropy increases during a spontaneous process conjecture 7 if entropy increases during the relaxation process and the glass transition is the inverse of relaxation then entropy must decrease during the glass transition this is consistent with our previous conclusion that the glass transition is nonspontaneous while this conclusion may appear as inconsistent with the second law there is no violation since the second law is a statement about spontaneous processes i e processes in which a system relaxes toward an equilibrium or less constrained state the glass transition is not such a process since here an equilibrium system becomes a constrained equilibrium state conjecture 6 is not only inconsistent with conjecture 3 it is inconsistent with classical thermodynamics when we consider a system which is not isolated for such a system its relevant free energy decreases in any spontaneous process it appears that gmc confuse isothermal relaxation occurring in a glass with spontaneous processes occurring at fixed observables such as energy volume etc the latter processes occur for isolated systems not for a glass at fixed temperature and pressure if gmc insist on focusing on the entropy then the statement should be in terms of the irreversible entropy generation is t 0 not in terms of the entropy change s t thus for the conjecture to make sense the reversible entropy drop es t during vitrification must not be too negative to ensure s t 0 this requires a justification that es t is t for the conjecture to be valid however no such justification is offered by gmc in their work as given it gives the impression that uca treats entropy to increase during relaxation in all kinds of systems isolated or not this is unsettling the same problem occurs with the last conjecture therefore to determine whether the above conjectures are justifiable we turn to the second law for 0 14 iii consequences of the second law for 0 a irreversible entropy generation the second law does tell us that the irreversible entropy generation in any spontaneous process is non negative but leaves the behavior of the entropy undetermined the latter depends on the process the entropy that appears in the second law in classical thermody namics is a thermodynamic concept it is postulated to exist even when the system is not in equilibrium its existence and continuity neither requires any statistical interpretation nor does it require the third law if there is any conflict between the second law and any other laws of physics the second law will always win in general in any thermodynamic process from macrostate 1 to macrostate 2 the change in the entropy 1 2 5 7 s s 2 s 1 es is is 0 6 in which is denotes the irreversible entropy generation within the system and es denotes the reversible entropy change due to exchange with the medium the actual value of s will depend on the values of es and is and can have any sign in general we have s es 7 which will prove extremely important below in the following we will only be interested in vitrification for which es is negative if it happens that es is negative enough to overcome the positive contribution of is then we will obtain a negative s b second law for 0 for an isolated system such as 0 es 0 so it is not surprising that s isolated system is 0 8 which explains the standard formulation 3 of the second law but only for an isolated system we now consider 0 but we allow the system to be not in equilibrium with the medium the medium is at a fixed temperature t 0 and pressure p 0 we are thinking of the system that has been brought in contact with the medium at some instant t 0 which we then 15 follow in time the entropy of 0 is written as a sum of the entropies of the system s t and the medium s t s 0 t s t s t 9 during its approach towards the maximum the instantaneous temperature pressure etc of the system if they can be defined are different from those of the medium 1 2 4 the condition required for defining temperature pressure etc of any non equilibrium system is that its entropy is a function of its instantaneous observables and internal variables 1 2 5 7 only it has no explicit time dependence the system is said to be in internal equilibrium 1 2 when this condition is met unless this condition is met we cannot identify fields for the system even though they exist for the medium for simplicity we will consider a system with a fixed number of particles with only observables e t and v t along with just one internal variable t thus s t s e t v t t 10 at each instance e t v t and t depend on the history of the system the corresponding fields are now given by respective derivatives of the entropy 1 t t s t e t p t t t s t v t a t t t s t t the new variable a t represents the affinity conjugate to t the gibbs fundamental relation is given by ds t 1 t t de t p t t t dv a t t t d t 11 which can be rewritten as de t t t ds t p t dv t a t d t 12 for the non equilibrium system in equilibrium this relation will reduce to de t 0 ds p 0 dv 13 where all variables are independent of time and we have used the fact that the equilibrium value a 0 of a t vanishes we can rewrite eqs 11 and 12 in the following form 2 ds t 1 t 0 de t p 0 t 0 dv 1 t t 1 t 0 de t p t t t p 0 t 0 dv a t t t d t 14 de t t 0 ds t p 0 dv t t t t 0 ds t p t p 0 dv t a t d t 15 16 the last three terms in eq 14 each give three distinct irreversible entropy generation terms and must be individually non negative in accordance with the second law let us consider the middle term in this equation which is non negative in a vitrification process the energy of the system decreases so that de t is negative thus in a vitrification process t t t 0 16 during isothermal relaxation constant t 0 and approaches t 0 from above as the relaxation ceases after equilibrium is achieved 1 as this is a general result coming from the second law it must be valid for all non equilibrium systems including glasses we need to see whether both glasses shown in fig 2 satisfy this result for the enthalpy h t e t p 0 v t we find dh t t 0 ds t v t dp 0 t t t 0 ds t p t p 0 dv t a t d t 17 let us consider the consequences of the second law from now on we focus on isobaric processes carried out at a fixed pressure p 0 of the medium we will assume that in such an isobaric process p t p 0 at all times for the time derivative of the entropy s 0 of the isolated system at fixed t 0 it can be shown 1 2 that in terms of the enthalpy and the internal variable of the system ds 0 t dt 1 t t 1 t 0 dh t dt a t t t d t dt 0 18 each term on the right side of the first equation gives an irreversible entropy generation see eq 8 and must be non negative accordingly 1 t t 1 t 0 dh t dt 0 19 which is unaffected by the number of internal variables with eq 16 this shows that dh t dt 0 20 which is found to hold in vitrification c determination of gts t 0 tobs and gts t 0 tobs from eqs 14 and 18 we find that ds t dt 1 t t dh t dt a t t t d t dt ds t dt 1 t 0 dh t dt 21 17 the two equations give the rate at which the entropy of the system and of the medium change in vitrification the rate for the medium is positive the second term in the entropy rate for the system is non negative the rate of the entropy drop is given by ds t dt 1 t t dh t dt a t t t d t dt 1 t t dh t dt ds t dt so that the rate of entropy drop for the system is bounded from above by the rate of entropy gain of the medium thus the drop s for is bounded from above by the entropy gain s during some interval t s s where we have introduced the change in any thermodynamic quantity t t t 0 from eq 21 we find that es t 1 t 0 h t is t t 0 h t t t dt h t t 0 t 0 a t t dt t t es t 1 t 0 h t where the dot above a symbol represents the time derivative the maximum entropy drop s occurs when comes to equilibrium with the medium in this case t t t 0 and a t 0 it is also equal to the maximum entropy gain of the medium at equilibration this situation correspond to the system as the equilibrated supercooled liquid with its entropy seq given by the solid curve in fig 2 thus we conclude that the entropy of the non equilibrium system always stays above that of the supercooled liquid s t 0 t seq t 0 during vitrification during relaxation s t 0 t approaches seq t 0 from above so that ds t dt 0 22 this conclusion is valid regardless of the number of internal variables the equality occurs only when equilibrium with the medium has been achieved we can understand this result on physical grounds as follows let t 0 t 0 g denote the temperature from which the system is cooled by bringing the system in contact with the 18 medium at t 0 t 0 g at t 0 see point a in fig 2 this situation corresponds to a rapid quench right after the contact the system has not had any time to change its microstate and remains in the microstate it had just prior to the contact is established thus at t 0 the system has the older entropy seq t 0 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid at the previous temperature we will justify this fact later see eq 33 the equilibrium entropy seq t 0 must be lower than seq t 0 since t 0 t 0 therefore the entropy must continue to drop during relaxation at t 0 even if the contribution from t is non negative this gives us the entropy of glass 1 at t texp the derivation of the last equation given in 1 was simpler as we had not considered the internal variable t there the above discussion justifies the behavior in the conventional approach described by eq 2 from eqs 20 21 and 22 we find ds t dh t 1 t t 1 a t d t dh t 0 23 which proves eq 3 this equation differs from the one given in 1 see eq 28 because of the contribution from the internal variable which was not considered there however the sign of the ratio remains the same from eq 21 we find s t s t s t 0 h t t 0 h t h t 0 t 0 at the glass transition we then have gts t 0 tobs h t 0 tobs h t 0 t 0 t 0 h t 0 t 0 heq t 0 t 0 eqs t 0 where eqs t 0 is the maximum entropy gain of the medium which occurs when the system has come to equilibrium with the medium this gain can be easily obtained by using a reversible path from the initial temperature t 0 to the final temperature t 0 this means that in fig 2 the system continues along the equilibrated supercooled liquid thus eqs t 0 eqs t 0 seq t 0 seq t 0 in such a reversible process s 0 0 as expected let us compare this entropy drop with that in the system because of the non negative contribution from t the entropy change gts t 0 t satisfies gts t 0 tobs tobs 0 h t t t dt gth tobs t 0 gts t 0 tobs eqs t 0 24 19 thus the entropy change of the medium and of the system satisfy eq 5 at the glass transition but most importantly the entropy loss of the medium cannot exceed eqs t 0 so that gts t 0 tobs eqs t 0 eqs t 0 25 we thus conclude 1 2 that the entropy of the glass must stay above that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid which makes glass 1 as the physical glass a conclusion based on the second law we can now extend the discussion to continuous cooling as follows we take t 0 t 0 g and t 1 0 t 0 g t 0 and wait for t tobs the entropy is that of glass 1 at t 1 0 we now decrease the temperature by t 0 to t 2 0 t 0 g 2 t 0 and wait for t tobs the entropy is that of glass 1 at t 2 0 we follow this cooling until the entire glass 1 curve is obtained at each temperature the entropy of the glass must stay above seq of the equilibrated supercooled liquid we have thus proved the following important theorem for any non equilibrium system theorem 8 the entropy of any non equilibrium system such as a glass in isobaric cooling must stay above that of the equilibrated state d thermodynamic entropy and glasses in the above discussion which starts with the second law behavior of the thermodynamic entropy s 0 t of 0 no assumption about the form of the thermodynamic entropy s t such as whether s t lies above glass 1 or below glass 2 the entropy of the equilibrated super cooled liquid see fig 2 of or the nature of irreversibility such as loss of ergodicity chemical reaction chaos phase transition etc in the system is made we do not impose any statis tical interpretation on these entropies either they are assumed to exist as thermodynamic quantities in classical thermodynamics thus their values are not relevant all that is rele vant is their rate accordingly we do not have to even worry if the entropies needed to be treated as statistical quantities with certain particular formulation of entropy boltzmann versus gibbs or the modification in uca any attempt to identify these classical entropies statistically must still conform to the consequence of the second law expressed for example in eq 22 during vitrification 20 although no assumption was made regarding s t 0 t lying above or below the entropy seq t 0 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid the second law has resulted in glass 1 as being the physically relevant glass and not glass 2 the deviation of glass 1 entropy s t 0 t from seq t 0 of the solid curve is due to the irreversible contributions the entropy of the non equilibrium state glass 1 approaches that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid entropy from above during isothermal relaxation this downward approach of the entropy of glass 1 is a consequence of the second law the entropy of the system howsoever defined must satisfy eq 22 in vitrification if the system has to obey the second law we assume that at time t 0 the system is above t 0 g so that the system is an equili brated supercooled liquid its temperature and pressure are equal to those of the medium let the e v and s denote the energy volume and entropy of the equilibrated supercooled liquid at this temperature t 0 respectively the equilibrium value of the internal variable is denoted by at time t 0 we abruptly bring this system in contact with another medium at temperature t 0 just below t 0 g see for example point a in fig 2 immediately after the contact the initial state of the system is characterized by its observables e v and s at t 0 after some time t texp the system appears to be glassy as shown by b on glass 1 during further relaxation the system eventually approaches the equilibrated supercooled liquid at t 0 during the relaxation process the entropy s t 0 t decreases in accordance with eq 22 this is an example of a fast quench in a continuous vitrification process carried out at a fixed rate the resulting glass entropy is shown by glass 1 if such a glass is allowed to relax see the two downward arrows it also converges to the solid curve of the supercooled liquid the resulting entropy during heating is shown by the dash dotted curve a and shows the resulting hysteresis over the transition region with the above background about the role of the second law for the open system we turn to uca to see if we can justify its consequences or assumptions conjectures iv irreversible contributions and calorimetric calcula tion during the glass transition gmc assert in the abstract 11 a common assumption in the glass community is that the entropy of a glass can be calculated by integration of measured heat capacity curve through the glass transition such integration assumes that glass is an equilibrium material and that 21 the glass transition is a reversible process this is an inaccurate and highly misleading statement which completely overlooks the tremendous progress made by prigogine and defay 23 davies and jones 24 and others who have followed the concept of internal variables due to de donder 1 2 5 7 we refer the reader to a very nice review by nemilov 14 and his monogram 8 workers in the glass community are well aware of the fact see fig 2 that the glass transition neither occurs at a single temperature it actually occurs over a range t 0 g t 0 g nor is it reversible see the dotted curve and the dash dotted curve a for the entropy during cooling and heating for glass 1 any attempt to use equation 1 of gmc 11 which we slightly modify to express it in terms of the thermodynamics entropy and present below s s t 0 s tm gmc es t 0 tm cp t 0 t 0 dt 0 26 by workers in the field merely reflects the desire to use an approximate description by replacing s t 0 by its calorimetric value sexpt t 0 sexpt t 0 s tm t 0 tm cp t 0 t 0 dt 0 the right hand side in the above equation 11 comparing with eq 7 shows that the approximation is simply to replace the forward inequality by a forward approximate equality approximate equality from the greater side s es 27 and the question one should ask is how reliable is the forward approximation 13 15 25 this question has also been recently answered by johari and khouri 19 this forward ap proximation cannot be confused with the above mentioned common assumption of equality s gmc es in eq 26 it appears that gmc confuse this forward approximation with an equality and use it see below to suggest that the traditional view of glasses is inapplicable 11 this suggestion is not the right conclusion an important aspect of non equilibrium systems is that their fields such as the tem perature t t are different from the constant fields such as the temperature t 0 of the sur rounding medium such a two field description captures the essence of non equilibrium states and is also consistent with the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem 12 in non equilibrium systems it has become apparent that non equilibrium systems violate 22 the principle of detailed balance and the fluctuation dissipation theorem the way irre versibility and the second law 3 are taken into account is by instantaneous fields and the introduction of internal variables the latter is a standard practice in non equilibrium ther modynamics 1 2 5 8 but their role is not considered in uca this leads them to make several inaccurate statements 11 not realizing that their eq 1 is a forward inequality 26 28 s t 0 sexpt t 0 due to all irreversible contributions to the entropy see the last three terms in eq 14 they incorrectly conclude that glass is treated strictly in the framework of equilibrium thermodynamics if the correction is made and the equality is replaced by a forward inequality it immediately rules out any contradiction with the statement that glass is exempt from the third law due to its nonequilibrium nature since the entropy of the glass at absolute zero is bounded below by sexpt 0 sres s 0 sexpt 0 one then discovers that there is no contradiction in logic in the traditional view and the following statement 11 in uca is without any scientific merit previous reports of a finite residual entropy of glass at absolute zero are an artifact of treating glass within the context of equilibrium thermodynamics or equilibrium statistical mechanics assuming ergodicity and without accounting for the observation time constraint not appreciating the important role played by instantaneous fields in non equilibrium systems leads them to doubt the applicability of ds dq t t t due to heat flow to such non equilibrium systems where dq is the heat transfer with the medium that it is the correct result follows immediately from eq 12 by rewriting it in the form of the first law as de t dq t p t dv t a t d t 23 so that dq t t t ds t the irreversible entropy generation within the system is given by dis dq 1 t t 1 t 0 0 in vitrification dq 0 which then requires t t t 0 this yields ds des dq t 0 which results in s t 0 sexpt t 0 as noted above the equality occurs only in equilibrium however gmc 11 confuse the forward approximate equation 1 of gmc 11 reproduced here as eq 26 with an equality and mistakenly conclude that the classical view is inapplicable the conclusion is without any foundation the second law clearly establishes that residual entropy is real as a non zero residual entropy is in conflict with the third law can only mean that the third law is not applicable to non equilibrium systems a conclusion well known in theoretical physics 30 as gmc do not consider any internal variable we must consider eq 23 by setting a t 0 in that case we have s t h t p 1 t t uca 1 t 0 0 28 since the temperature of the system is taken equal to t 0 in uca we then conclude that the increase in their statistical entropy along with the decrease in enthalpy during relaxation violates the positivity of the instantaneous temperature of the system and throws doubts that their statistical entropy can be identified with the thermodynamic entropy as the nature of the statistical entropy is crucial to understand the reasons for the possible failure of s t we turn to this issue in the following section v statistical entropy for non equilibrium systems a statistical entropy as an average for a macrostate the discussion so far has been about the thermodynamic entropy and its existence as used in classical thermodynamics and in the formulation of the second law for an isolated system see eqs 8 and 1 all that is required for this is the fact that there exists an entropy function s 0 t which is non decreasing in time its actual value is not relevant all that is relevant is the change in this function in other words the thermodynamic entropy is not constrained by the third law in any way the latter becomes relevant only for the 24 statistical interpretation of the thermodynamic entropy the latter does not even have to be non negative as is well known from the entropy of an ideal gas at low temperatures the existence of s 0 t immediately leads to the existence of s t and s t see eq 9 however it should be emphasized that whatever value any of these entropies such as s t has at any instance it has this value even if no measurement is made on the system remark 9 any statistical interpretation of the entropy must obey the property that its value must be unaffected by the measurement this point should not be overlooked we will explain later how this statement is justified in classical thermodynamics or non equilibrium statistical dynamics we now turn to the statistical interpretation of entropy that provides a justification of the third law for equilibrium states and endow the entropy such as s 0 t with a definite value let i denote a microstate of the isolated system 0 in some macrostate the formulation by gibbs in terms of the probability pi t of a microstate i at time t is as follows s 0 t i pi t ln pi t t 29 where the sum is over all microstates whose number is w 0 associated with the particular macrostate we have set kb 1 a microstate is called available at time t if its probability is non zero otherwise it is unavailable at that time 16 an available microstate does not mean that the microstate has necessarily been visited by the system during the time interval t following gibbs 31 we have introduced the index of probability t ln p t so that the entropy becomes a statistical average of the negative index of probability over all microstates belonging to the macrostate this makes entropy similar to any other average mechanical observable like the energy e 0 t i pi t e 0 i 30 where e 0 i is the energy of the i th microstate the only difference is that the entropy is a thermodynamic quantity as an average of t the index has its origin in the stochas tic nature 16 21 22 of a statistical system thus its nature is very different from the mechanical nature of observables like the energy momentum etc although both averages 25 give a statistical average it is clear from eq 29 that the negative index t is the contribution to the entropy from a single microstate one may wish to think of t as the entropy of a microstate but this is not the conventional view as the entropy is an average quantity for the macrostate see however eq 33 we refer the reader to recent reviews for more details 15 16 the probabilities pi t can be determined by considering an ensemble or by considering the temporal evolution as described at length elsewhere 15 16 21 22 but neither is really necessary provided the probabilities pi t are known if it is known initially that 0 is in some unique microstate i 0 then pi 0 i i 0 and s 0 0 0 as time goes on and assuming that the dynamics is stochastic the initial state will result in making various microstates available with some probabilities pi t at time t and the entropy given by eq 29 will increase 32 until it reaches its maximum value it is most certainly not a constant 16 21 22 the time needed for all the microstates to be available is in most cases much shorter than the poincare recurrence time 15 16 21 22 it may indeed be smaller than the relaxation time relax at the shorter time all microstates have become available but the entropy is still not necessarily at its maximum for the macrostate since the microstates are not yet equiprobable in the latter situation the system is in internal equilibrium to be discussed below if and only if all microstates are equally probable pi t 1 w 0 for all i which happens after the relaxation time relax do we have the maximum possible value of the entropy for the equilibrium macrostate s 0 t s 0 eq lnw 0 for t relax 31 this entropy is known as the boltzmann entropy it is the equilibrium value of the entropy and occurs because all microstates of the system are equiprobable this entropy is constant in time and depends on the constant observables e 0 v 0 n 0 etc the internal variables that are now constant are not independent of these observables in equilibrium 1 2 so the entropy does not depend on them anymore it is possible in many cases that over a period of time smaller than relax only a part of microstates whose number is given by w 0 t w 0 have become available in that case the sum in eq 29 is restricted to w 0 t but the entropy is strictly less than lnw 0 t unless all available microstates become equally probable in that case the entropy is given by s 0 t s 0 in eq lnw 0 t for t relax 32 26 which is the boltzmann entropy at that instance this entropy is now a function of the in ternal variables which themselves depend on time however s 0 in eq e 0 v 0 n 0 0 t cannot have an explicit time dependence as for fixed e 0 v 0 n 0 and 0 t s 0 in eq e 0 v 0 n 0 0 t is its maximum possible value this non equilibrium state of the system with the entropy given by s 0 in eq is said to be in internal equilibrium 1 2 introduced in sect iii the above discussion can be easily extended to an open system it has already been shown 16 that the gibbs entropy for the open system is given by exactly the same formula as eq 29 except that i now represents one of the possible microstates of the open system thus everything said above applies to the entropy s t of by removing the suffix 0 above the only difference is that e 0 v 0 n 0 etc will be replaced by the instantaneous values e t v t n the entropy sin eq is a function of e t v t t n 0 etc but it again cannot have an explicit dependence on time for the same reason that sin eq is already maximum for fixed e t v t t n 0 etc in the discussion below we only consider the system b importance of equiprobable microstates for measurements and microstate entropy the equiprobability assumption implies that the system exhibits no bias for any particular microstate a point already emphasized by several authors in the past including tolman 32 see sect 25 particularly pp 63 64 who uses this property of a statistical system as a postulate when he discusses the validity of statistical mechanics this postulate should be valid even for non equilibrium states that appear in a system as we vary macroscopic conditions this is the main idea about the internal equilibrium in our approach the equiprobable or unbiased sampling assumption for the application of the two boltzmann probabilities has a very important consequence for measurements in that one does not have to wait for the system to sample all of the relevant microstates the latter is known to take astronomically large poincare recurrence time 21 as can be found in any decent textbook on statistical mechanics see for example huang 29 let us consider a non equilibrium system in internal equilibrium because of the equiprobable assumption pi t 1 w t i 27 where w t denotes the number of microstates in the macrostate at that instant so that the average of any thermodynamic quantity like the energy or entropy is given by e t i ei w t s t i w t in which the sum is over w t microstates in reality equiprobable microstates do not have to imply an exact equiprobability they can be within statistical error one can think of lnw t as the entropy per microstate or the entropy of a microstate under the assumption of equiprobability as the observables in each of these microstates take values within statistical fluctuations of the average observables even a few samples will result in a highly reliable value of the observables the only difference is that we need to replace w t by the number of samples this is what makes classical thermodynamics so reproducible within statistical fluctuations for example let us take a single sample which happens to be in some microstate of energy e with probability 1 w t the value of e is within statistical error to the average energy e t there is no sum in the definition for e t now the result is that e t e s t lnw t 33 a single sample or equivalently a single microstate with probability p t 1 w t provides us with the energy e within statistical error and with the boltzmann entropy the latter is not zero and contradicts the uca conjecture 3 the same is also true of other observables remark 10 there is no need to take the average over a large ensemble or over a long period of time this is why only a few samples to obtain average thermodynamic quantities give rise to highly reproducible results in thermodynamics one most certainly does not have to take a very long time average or a very large ensemble average the above discussion shows how the measurement will not affect the thermodynamic properties in particular the entropy of the system in accordance with the expectation noted in sect v the requirement that the measurement should have ample time to sample all relevant microstates w t is not only unnecessary but also not physical as that time is comparable to the poincare cycle 15 16 21 we believe that gmc have unnecessarily confused the issue by their following suggestion 11 28 consequently only the time average can correctly reproduce the measured properties of glass the underlying reason for this is that at any instant in time a system has one and only one representative point in phase space the properties measured during a given experiment are a result of averaging over only those microstates that are accessed by the system during the measurement time this in a nutshell is the principle of causality for short observation times only a small number of microstates are accessed for long observation times a large number of microstates are accessed of course it is possible in some rare cases that the sample we have is not a representative of internal equilibrium in that case we will obtain results that are not reproducible but such a situation will be truly rare c gibbs vs boltzmann entropy formulation it should be clear form above that the gibbs formulation is more general than the boltz mann formulation 15 16 21 22 in both cases considered above the boltzmann entropy is the maximum possible entropy which occurs only when the available microstates have become equiprobable and the system is either in equilibrium or in internal equilibrium 1 2 the system is said to be in equilibrium when eq 31 determines the entropy and in inter nal equilibrium when eq 32 determines the entropy in all other cases the gibbs entropy is the correct entropy of the system as the gibbs formulation supersedes the boltzmann formulation it seems to be the more general one to use for non equilibrium systems the relevance of the gibbs formulation of entropy for non equilibrium systems has been discussed recently 15 16 21 22 by us and we refer the reader to them for more details we should however mention that boltzmann s h theorm already shows that the gibbs formulation is more general and conforms to the second law we have also discussed 15 16 there how the time average is not very useful at low temperatures with the above discussion of the statistical entropy we now turn to uca gmc 11 go on to state as a fact that the gibbs entropy is valid for canonical systems in equi librium cannot be used in nonequilibrium systems since it implicitly assumes ergodicity this is far from the truth see above also the gibbs entropy is valid for any system isolated or not which need not be in equilibrium we refer the reader to the derivation of the gibbs 29 entropy formulation in eq 40 7 for a non equilibrium ideal gas in the famous textbook by landau and lifshitz 30 when this entropy is maximized it gives the grand canonical distribution but the point is that the gibbs entropy is valid even for non equilibrium sys tems it also does not require ergodicity it should be stressed that gibbs never mentions ergodicity in his famous treatise 31 the entropy of a non equilibrium isolated system using gibbs formulation is considered by tolman 32 to show that it is a non decreasing function of time and satisfies the second law using this formulation for the isolated system it is easy to show 2 15 16 that the same formulation also applies to open systems gmc use their above limited view of the gibbs entropy to argue that the approach by lebowitz and goldstein of using the boltzmann entropy formulation is the only one valid and consistent with the second law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics see claim 5 this is a very strong statement with the implication that it is the truth to be accepted by the reader unfortunately the statement is not the truth as gibbs formulation of the entropy also satisfies the second law as we have discussed above moreover it is also not accepted by all workers in non equilibrium thermodynamics even ruelle 33 who is cited by gmc 11 categorically disagrees with the interpretation in uca we quote ruelle 33 the fact that we take seriously the expression s dx x ln x for the entropy seems to be at variance with the point of view defended by lebowitz 20 who prefers to give physical meaning to a boltzmann entropy different from s there is however no necessary contradiction between the two points of view which correspond to idealizations of different physical situations specifically lebowitz discusses the entropy of states which are locally close to equilibrium while here we analyze entropy production for certain particular steady states which maybe far from equilibrium it is our opinion that gmc have unnecessarily confused the issue of the statistical inter pretation of the entropy while they argue for the superiority of the boltzmann entropy for which no reasonable arguments are offered they go back to use the gibbs formulation which they blame to be an equilibrium quantity knowing well that the glass is not an equilibrium system we find nothing wrong with the gibbs formulation contrary to the implications in uca the suggestion by gmc that the glass confined to a component is like a canonical system 30 at fixed temperature and volume while it is really a non canonical system with time varying temperature and constant pressure misses out the most important aspect of the glass transi tion the temperature controlling the vibrations within the component and the temperature describing component hopping over a longer period of time are two distinct temperatures as they do not include any internal variable in their approach they miss out in capturing all non equilibrium contributions to the problem all they seem to be concerned with is to justify the loss of entropy using a computational approach proposing a computational ap proach that shows entropy of the glass below that of the supercooled liquid is not a proof of the conjecture of the entropy loss we need to ensure that the resulting physics is consistent with the established laws of physics such as the second law we now turn to this aspect of their approach d ergodicity and causality when the entropy is given by eq 31 the system is said to be ergodic a system is either ergodic or it is not when the entropy is given by eq 32 one can say that the system is ergodic with respect to the available microstates belonging to w t but this is not equivalent to the original concept of ergodicity which is mathematically defined 34 36 by requiring the equality of infinite time and ensemble or phase space averages see also tolman 32 f f where f lim t 1 t t 0 f t dt f f p q dpdq dpdq the infinite time average is required to ensure that the average does not depend on the initial state of the system thus the deborah number de t relax relax t t 0 if we wish to test whether a given system is ergodic or not if we observe a system over a period much shorter than relax so that de 1 all we observe is a non equilibrium system but it tells us nothing about the system being ergodic or not that can only be answered by observing a system much much longer than relax indeed this time must be comparable 31 to the poincare cycle even if we observe the system for a period t comparable to relax the system has not have enough time to visit all relevant microstate in this case f t relax 1 t t 0 f t dt will be dominated by microstates that the system has visited during t relax but these microstates have a strong correlation with the initial state which may be far from equilib rium thus such a finite time average will not be equal to the ensemble average f for the system and one would incorrectly conclude that the system is non ergodic even if it is ergodic it should be clear that because of the limit t ergodicity is a property of an equilibrium state it has no meaning for a non equilibrium state therefore any suggestion that a glass is non ergodic requires the phenomenological assumption that it is a permanently frozen structure this is most certainly not a valid assumption in the glass transition region thus to speak of ergodicity breaking at or near t 0 g is a misnomer in our opinion even though it is loosely used in the literature in practical terms a system is ergodic if after sufficiently long time t relax it visits all possible microstates consistent with a macrostate with equal probability this is no different than the above mathematical definition as the time required to visit all microstates is comparable to the poincare cycle 15 16 21 however the practical definition which uses the macrostate causes the following problem it depends on how the macrostate is defined as we have seen in sect iii the concept of a macrostate in non equilibrium systems depends on time and will eventually become the equilibrium macrostate when t relax this will make every system ergodic whether the equilibrium state is unique or not such as an ising ferromagnet which has two distinct equilibrium states and for which the macrostate can be described by the magnetization along with other observables if however the magnetization is not used in specifying the macrostate then the practical definition will show that the ergodicity is broken in ferromagnets usually we require the equilibrium state to be not unique for the loss of ergodicity therefore we believe that the mathematical definition of ergodicity as a limiting property is the proper way to investigate ergodicity such a definition will surely make the liquid above the melting temperature ergodic now just because we observe an ergodic system such as this liquid at some time t relax so that we observe a non equilibrium state of the system does not make the ergodic system non ergodic the system remains ergodic as it will eventually equilibrate to its unique equilibrium state for 32 t relax in accordance with its ergodic nature therefore to speak of ergodicity restoration for a glass is not proper as the glass fully relaxes from the proper mathematical definition of ergodicity a glass is also ergodic as it will eventually equilibrate to the unique equilibrated supercooled liquid the quotation marks on ergodic here is to reflect the fact that we are taking the corresponding crystal out of the consideration these issues have been discussed elsewhere 15 16 palmer 37 does talk about the loss of ergodicity but it is understood that the relevant part of the phase space is a union of disjoint components with no possible transitions between them the union of these components determine the macrostate however the system will be confined forever to one of these components so that we can set relax andde the situation is similar to that in a ferromagnet except that there are many more macrostates considered by palmer the ergodicity is clearly lost in this case however the situation with glasses is quite different since relax so that de 0 in the limit we believe that gmc unnecessarily complicate the issue of glass transition by invoking the loss of ergodicity just because we happen to observe the system in its non equilibrium state at time intervals t relax if we accept this rendition of ergodicity loss even a liquid above its melting temperature will become non ergodic at t relax and no useful purpose is served by introducing such a concept of ergodicity we refer the reader to a very good discussion of ergodicity by tolman 32 and by gallavotti 34 see in particular p 257 in our view the glass transition at t 0 g is a transition from equilibrated supercooled liquid to a non equilibrium supercooled liquid and the transition at t 0 g a transition from this non equilibrium supercooled liquid to a glass which is almost solid and its structure appears frozen over a long period of time t obs thus our interpretation is different from gmc gmc also refer to the concept of causality in their work see conjecture 2 this issue seems to be first raised by kievelson and reiss 38 39 it basically refers to the possible existence of a large number of degenerate microstates for a macrostate at absolute zero according to reiss 39 besides the residual entropy at 0 k being an artifact resulting from apparent entropy measurements along at least partially irreversible paths this specification is incompatible with a view of the second law which establishes entropy as a 33 function of state if it is a state function it depends only on its measured state not upon the history of the system and certainly not upon its future since the system does not visit its alternative degenerate states during the time of measurement it is unaware of these states and the principle of causality forbids it to be affected by these states the entropy in non equilibrium thermodynamics is a generalized state function in that it is not only a function of instantaneous observables but also internal variables the internal variables are no longer independent of the observables only when the system has come to equilibrium only the observables and not the internal variables are measurable thus reiss proposes a very narrow concept of entropy used in non equilibrium thermodynamics as the instantaneous observables and internal variables clearly depend on the history reiss s assessment about the history dependence is incorrect moreover as the second law destroys time reversibility the system is very much controlled by its future i e the equilibrium state every system no matter how it is prepared knows exactly where its future lies and relaxes towards it the idea of causality in the above quote with respect to the statistical entropy is somewhat misleading just as each role of a die results in an independent outcome yet their probabilities are not independent after all they have to add to unity different microstates are independent yet their probabilities are not 15 16 let us clarify this by a simple example discussed by us elsewhere 15 16 let us throw an six face unloaded die let the outcome of the throw be 5 then we have pi i 5 i 1 2 6 where i j is the kronecker delta and where i j denote the six possible outcomes let us assume that the outcome of the next throw is 3 then p 5 p 3 1 2 and all other prob abilities remaiin zero even if the two throws are independent the probaility distribution changes depending not only on the numeber of throws but also on the particular outcomes as the entropy is determined by the probability distribution it should not come as surprise that the microstates throws here though independent affect the value of the entropy only when the number of throws has become so large that pi 1 6 the equilibrium value can we say that additional throws will not affect the entropy but this is precisely the property of an equilibrium state 34 it should be clear that the probabilities of independent events are not independent in probability theory as entropy is a statistical quantity after all it is the average of the negative of the index its value is determined by microstate probabilities therefore the entropy is a measure of the index of probability of all independent microstates causality has nothing to do with the concept of statistical entropy let us consider the case when microstates are equiprobable the entropy of any sample at t a single microstate at that instance is given by its probability as shown in eq 33 mechanical quantities such as energy volume etc are not affected by this probability the mechanical quantities are independent for each sample as expected but entropy being a statistical or thermodynamic quantity is determined by the probabilities which themselves are controlled by the sum rule i pi t 1 over all microstates or samples so that the probability is determined by the number of microstates w t this expected result has nothing to do with the temperature such as the absolute zero and remains valid at all temperatures and at all times whenever internal equilibrium is present vi loss of entropy in uca and the glass transition continuous vitrification results in the entropy curves thermodynamic and statistical entropy s t 0 t of glass 1 in ca and statistical entropy s t 0 t of glass 2 in uca in fig 2 let us consider our system above t 0 g where the system is either the equilibrated supercooled liquid or the equilibrated liquid let e v and s denote the energy volume and entropy of the equilibrated state at this temperature t 0 respectively the equilibrium value of the internal variable is denoted by at time t 0 we abruptly bring this system in contact with another medium at temperature t 0 immediately prior to the instant the contact is made the system is in some microstate i but we do not know precisely which microstate it is in there is a probability pi that the system is in microstate i let denote the time required for i to evolve to another microstate at t 0 this microstate has no time to change immediately after the contact so the system remains in the same microstate initially for t what is the entropy s t 0 t for t after the contact 35 a the unconventional approach according to conjecture 5 the statistical entropy s t 0 t is identically zero recall that we are considering the entropy and not just the configurational entropy here and in fig 2 similarly our microstate refers to the system and not just to its configurational state s t 0 t 0 for t this will be true regardless of whether t 0 t 0 or t 0 t 0 we have already used this argument in sect i b which we will now formalize this zero entropy for t will result in an entropy curve similar to the entropy curve of glass 2 in fig 2 at t 0 in that it lies below seq t 0 except that it is identically zero for t the argument works the same way even if t 0 and t 0 happen to be above the melting temperature tm where we have an ordinary liquid which is not thought to lose ergodicity conclusion 11 it thus follows that the argument of the entropy loss in uca has nothing to do with any impending glass transition or any impending loss of ergodicity both of which require temperatures near t 0 g it is merely a consequence of two distinct facts a the duration of observation obs we will see below that this restriction on obser vation time is toally irrelevant for the conclusion b the entropy of a microstate is zero per conjecture 3 let us now consider the above thought experiment in time at any temperature t 0 the entropy is s t 0 t 0 for t we now watch the microstate i to evolve to some other microstate i 1 at t and let 1 be the evolution time for i 1 since the system is in a single microstate it follows from conjecture 3 that the entropy of the system is still zero for t 1 we wait till t 1 so that the current microstate evolves into another microstate i 2 and let 2 be the its evolution time from the same reasoning we find that s t 0 t 0 for t 1 2 it is easy to see that s t 0 t 0 for t this makes the second part of conjecture 3 inconsistent with its first part 36 conclusion 12 conjecture 3 cannot be justified even though we have rejected conjecture 3 let us assume that the entropy s t 0 t continues to increase in time from its initial value s t 0 0 0 for reasons not clearly specified by gmc we should recall see remark 4 that the statistical concept of entropy adopted by gmc cannot entertain the second law so its increase must be justified on some other grounds which gmc have not done so far within the framework of the unconventional approach let us ask what would happen if t obs if the relaxation time relax obs the entropy s t 0 t will continue to increase and become equal to the equilib rium entropy for t 0 g t 0 tm the entropy will equal seq t 0 of the supercooled liquid for t 0 t 0 g s t 0 t will continue to increase from zero and become equal to the entropy s t 0 obs of glass 2 see the horizontal bars on upward pointing arrows in fig 2 at t obs as it tries to grow to its equilibrium value seq t 0 for reasons not mentioned in uca if we disrupt the time evolution at t obs such as by abruptly changing the temperature of the medium the system will have this entropy s t 0 obs at the moment the change is made according to our understanding of uca this is the glass transition in the system if we let the system relax at t 0 the entropy will continue to increase form s t 0 obs this time from above the horizontal bar on the upwards arrow until it reaches seq t 0 as t relax t 0 the entropy is always increasing with the glass transition playing no special role in the growth of the entropy we see no evidence of this process being inverse of the glass transition at t obs entropy s t 0 t is an increasing function of t at all times conclusion 13 we see no real difference in the way entropy behaves during the evolution of the system which suggests that the glass transition and relaxation are not inverse processes b entropy loss and the second law regardless of the amount of drop it does not even have to be comparable to sres the statistical entropy s t of such a non equilibrium state in uca must approach that of the supercooled liquid from below this will result in the increase of the entropy during relaxation which violates eq 22 as this equation was a consequence of the second law we come to the following 37 conclusion 14 a conjecture of entropy drop below that of the supercooled liquid will vio late the second law as is clear from eqs 18 21 and 22 thus the statistical entropy s t 0 t and the thermodynamic entropy s t 0 t are two distinct quantities with the statis tical entropy s t 0 t having no relevance to the glassy state c our conventional approach we believe that the core of the problem with uca is the conjecture about the entropy of a microstate see conjecture 3 the entropy is a property of a macrostate however if the system is in internal equilibrium or in equilibrium then one can obtain the entropy of the system by simply using a microstate 21 22 as seen in eq 33 this entropy is not always zero it will be zero if and only if the microstate is unique the macrostate corresponding to given e t v t and t is the collection of all w t microstates with given e t v t and t along with their probabilities 16 all instantaneous thermodynamic averages including the instantaneous entropy are average quantities over the macrostate at that instant under the assumption of internal equilibrium the instatntaneous averages can be obtained from a single microstate or sample as discussed in sect vb the dynamics within a glass for it to jump from one microstate to another in time is not necessary for determining these instantaneous averages an issue discussed elsewhere 15 16 to which we refer the reader for details when we pick a glass or when we make an instantaneous measurement we do not know which microstate it belongs to all we know is the probability pi for the microstate i if the glass formation occurs under an unbiased condition all microstates will be equally probable so that pi 1 w t and we obtain the boltzmann entropy lnw t let wg denote the number of possible microstates at absolute zero when a glass is formed it is equally likely to be in any of the wg microstates at absolute zero so that the residual entropy resulting from this will be sres lnwg the residual entropy will be zero if and only if we know for sure that the glass is a particular microstate which will happen only if wg 1 this we believe will represent an ideal glass just because one glass sample at absolute zero is in some microstate out of wg 1 does 38 not mean that the glass entropy is zero the latter would be the case if we knew which particular microstate the glass sample happens to be only when wg 1 can we be sure that all glass samples would be in the same microstate and the glass entropy would be precisely zero 16 in all other cases all we know is that the probability that the system is in microstate i is pi and the entropy is given by the gibbs entropy in eq 29 there is another way to understand this probability 15 16 we consider dividing the system into a large number of macroscopically large but quasi independent parts of equal size each of which can be in any microstate associated with a part with a probability p then the entropy s t of each part is given s t p t ln p t and the entropy of the system using its additive property is given by s t s t nps t where the sum is over all np parts of the system and s t is the average entropy per part once we recognize that the entropy of a microstate is in general not zero identically we have no problem understanding that when we bring the system in contact with a medium at another temperature the entropy immediately after the contact is also unchanged it then changes towards the new equilibrium value during its relaxation which is shown by downward arrows in fig 2 if we interrupt this relaxation at t obs t 0 t 0 g by bringing the system in contact with a different medium at a lower temperature the system will not completely relax the current value of the entropy s t 0 t obs becomes the initial value of the entropy at the new temperature a sequence of such interruptions will eventually result in a frozen glass below t 0 g this understanding of the microstate entropy also shows that one does not have to observe the system over a period necessary to sample many of or all of the microstates associated with the macrostate or one does not require that the entropy is maximum only when all the microstates have been visited the latter understanding of entropy has been criticized in the past by several authors see for example huang 29 tolman 32 gallovatti 34 gujrati 21 and the argument has been revisited recently by goldstein 13 the time needed for all the microstates of a macroscopic system to be visited so that the entropy becomes maximum is beyond the current age of the universe we have already argued against the time average to be relevant for any measurement 15 16 in this 39 work we have shown clearly that a single instantaneous measurement is sufficient to provide us with a thermodynamic description of the system at that instant any measurement that takes some finite non zero duration will never yield any instantaneous information about the system vii discussion and conclusions we have briefly described and extended the conventional approach we have developed earlier for any non equilibrium system we consider the system to be surrounded by a very large medium to form the combined system 0 so that the fields of the medium are not affected by the presence of processes going on inside the system whatever they may thus the approach can be applied to glasses some authors sometimes identify them by some stretch of imagination as non ergodic however whether ergodicity is lost or not plays no role in the behavior of the collection 0 which we treat as an isolated body so that its thermodynamic entropy cannot decrease with time this is the statement of the second law for the isolated body we assume that both the body and the medium are separately in internal equilibrium but not in equilibrium with each other the internal equilibrium allows us to introduce instantaneous fields t t p t etc for the system and the constant fields t 0 p 0 etc for the medium we also use a single internal variable t in addition to s t v t as induced internal variables to describe possible relaxation in the system as it approaches equilibrium the non equilibrium nature of the system appears in the values of instantaneous fields t t p t etc being different from t 0 p 0 etc of the medium these differences in the fields cause non negative irreversible entropy generation in accordance with the second law in an isobaric vitrification which is what we consider in this work we assume that p t p 0 at all times the irreversible entropy generation requires t t t 0 the equality occurs when there is equilibrium between the system and the medium the instantaneous observables internal variables and entropy at time t are described by the microstate it the system happens to be in at that instance along with its probability this microstate also represents the instantaneous macrostate of the system the effect of an instantaneous measurement is to give the values of the instantaneous observables and the entropy the measurement does not alter the instantaneous value of the observables internal variables and the entropy the entropy above refers to the thermodynamic entropy and 40 its statistical interpretation is obtained by the gibbs entropy formualtion the statistical entropy is a statistical average of the negative index of microstate probabilities just like the observables are of mechanical quantities in our approach ca the two entropies behave in identical fashion any attempt to provide the classical entropy with a statistical interpretation must satisfy two important requirements ca 1 it must decrease during relaxation in an isobaric vitrification process ca 2 its instantaneous value must not be affected by any instantaneous measurement in our approach any non equilibrium state such as the one produced by changes in the medium by changing its temperature relaxes towards its new equilibrium during such a relaxation under isobaric cooling the entropy ehthalpy and the instantaneous temperature decrease towards their respective equilibrium values the relaxation is complete when we wait for t relax during the relaxation process the system will undergo a glass transition below t 0 g if the system is abruptly changed at t obs relax by bringing it in contact with a medium at a lower temperature the instantaneous macrostate of the system de scribed in terms of its observables and internal variable does not change when the contact is made this also means that the entropy also does not change if the contact is not made the relaxation will continue to go on thus the glass transition and relaxation are part of the same relaxation process in ca there is nothing inverse about them the gain in the thermodynamic entropy of the medium is shown to be bounded from above by the maxi mum change seq t 0 the latter is the maximum possible decrease in the thermodynamic entropy of the system from a careful analysis we have concluded that the thermodynamic entropy s t 0 t of the system such as glass 1 must always be above seq t 0 thus the thermodynamic entropy must decrease during relaxation the decrease is a consequence of the second law the conclusion of the thermodynamic approach is summarized in theorem 8 the ther modynamic entropy must decrease with time during any isothermal relaxation in isobaric vitrification uca developed by gmc as an attempt to describe glass transition in any material does not fulfill both requirements ca 1 and ca 2 not only that the glass transition and relax ation are described as inverse processes faced with these discrepancies and several other 41 unconventional and not adequetly explained aspects of uca we have carefully examined it in this work to test the validity of their inverse conjecture uca 5 we decided to treat as part of 0 we do this to determine the entropy gain by the medium to show unambiguously whether the system can lose so much entropy at the glass transition that it lies below seq in fig 2 see uca 5 gmc incorrectly conclude that the use of classical thermodynamics to calculate the ther modynamic entropy is logically inconsistent uca 1 using this erroneous conclusion they argue that the residual entropy must vanish in accordance with the third law uca 2 however a careful reconsideration shows that there is nothing wrong in using the classical non equilibrium thermodynamics indeed its use clearly establishes that the calorimetric entropy sexpt 0 at absolute zero is a lower bound to the residual entropy the former entropy is normally found to be non negative which makes sres sexpt 0 0 thus the primary motivation of gmc to develop their unconventional approach uca is based on an incorrect understanding of classical thermodynamics as discussed in sect ii uca is based on a set of conjectures some of which are inter related left unproven or satisfactorily justified by gmc in particular as summarized in remark 4 their statistical formulation s t 0 t of the entropy which is based on the zero entropy conjecture uca 3 for a microstate has nothing to do with the thermodynamic entropy s t 0 t used in the second law in eq 1 the entire uca is based solely on this statistical notion of entropy and its computation this formulation of s t 0 t in uca has been developed with a goal to show entropy loss yet we find that this formalism in particular the growth of the statistical entropy with time in conjecture 3 is inconsistent with uca 3 the latter if accepted only results in s t 0 t 0 at all times under all conditions including all temperatures this is most certainly unphysical in our opinion it is this conjecture that results in the entropy loss during a glass transition under cooling even if we allow for the entropy to increase from zero due to some unknown reasons not offered by gmc we find that s t 0 t will always increase towards seq t 0 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid we find no justification that the relaxation and glass formation are inverse processes their statistical entropy s t 0 t increases in both processes the increase of entropy scenario would hold at all temperatures not just at and below t 0 g thus the 42 entropy loss conjecture has nothing to do with any glass transition or any ergodicity loss it is merely a consequence of the zero entropy conjecture uca 3 the increase of the statistical entropy s t 0 t in uca contradicts the decrease of the thermodynamic entropy found in ca thus the statistical entropy in uca cannot represent the thermodynamic entropy of a glass as their computation also shows an increase of their statistical entropy their computational scheme is not useful to understand glasses the statistical entropy due to gibbs that is used in ca remains in conformity with the behavior of the thermodynamic entropy the entropy of a microstate see eq 33 is not necessarily zero thus at each instant of time the entropy of a system which happens to be in a microstate is not zero in ca this instantaneous entropy for an isolated system will always increase but for an open system such as a glass may decrease the latter behavior is in accordance with the second law in both cases it is the irreversible entropy generation that can never be negative it is our belief that gmc have overlooked this distinction beteen the entropy and irreversible entropy generation in their approach which causes them to incorrectly believe that the entropy must increase during isothermal relaxation in vitrification it is our opinion that gmc have unnecessarily confused the issue of the statistical concept of entropy by implying that the gibbs entropy is not suitable to describe glasses but the boltzmann entropy is this is not a correct conclusion both formulations are appropriate but care must be exercised to interpret them properly let us assume equiprobability of microstates the number of relevant microstats w t is most certainly not the number of microstates sampled by any measurement for a macrostate in time as gmc suggest the time for that is of the order of poincare cycle and far exceeds the age of the universe it is really the number of microstates available to the system as explained earlier and even an instantaneous measurement will give the expected value of the observables this is what makes thermodynamics so reliable a science this interpretation is the same whether we use the gibbs entropy formulation or the boltzmann entropy formulation there is no difference between them as long as we deal with internal equilibrium their continuous assertion in various publication that they are different is most probably due to their misunderstanding and serves no purpose except to confuse the issue of the statistical entropy there is no reason at all to doubt that the thermodynamic and statistical entropies are different in any way 43 it is our opinion that they have also unnecessarily made too much of an issue of ergodicity loss and of causality in glasses all one needs to do is to treat glasses as a non equilibrium state and to recall that the statistical entropy is an average of a statistical quantity the negative index of probability as discussed in the work gmc have taken a very simplistic view of glasses by ignoring internal variables two temperature description and the fact that fluctuation dissipation theorems used by them 11 fail for glasses we finally conclude that their current theoretical and computational attempts using uca has no relevance for glasses i am thankful to m goldstein for introducing me to the work by gmc and to g p johari
