prigogine defay ratio for systems in internal equilibrium p d gujrati and p p aung department of physics department of polymer science the university of akron akron oh 44325 usa december 15 2010 abstract we follow the consequences of internal equilibrium in non equilibrium systems that has been introduced recently phys rev e 81 051130 2010 to obtain the generalization of maxwell s relation and the clausius clapeyron relation that are normally given for equilibrium systems the use of jacobians allow for a more compact way to address the generalized maxwell relations the latter are available for any number of internal variables the clausius clapeyron relation in the subspace of observables show not only the non equilibrium modification but also the modification due to internal variables that play a dominant role in glasses real systems do not directly turn into glasses gl that are frozen structures from the supercooled liquid state l there is an intermediate state gl where the internal variables are not frozen thus there is no single glass transition a system possess several kinds of glass transitions some conventional l gl gl gl in which the state change continuously and the transition mimics a continuous or second order transition and some apparent l gl l gl in which the free energies are discontinuous so that the transition appears as a zeroth order transition as discussed in the text we evaluate the prigogine defay ratio in the subspace of the observables at these transitions we find that it is normally different from 1 except at the conventional transition l gl where 1 regardless of the number of internal variables electronic address pdg uakron edu 1 http arxiv org abs 1101 0431 v 2 mailto pdg uakron edu i introduction a previous results in a series of papers we have begun to develop non equilibrium thermodynamics starting from the second law and ensuring the additivity of entropy as a state function 1 3 the central idea in this approach is that of internal equilibrium within a macroscopic system surrounded by an extremely large medium the two form an isolated system 0 as shown in fig 1 while the entropy s t and the general non equilibrium thermodynamic potential t see 2 for more details such as the non equilibrium gibbs free energy g t of the system exist even when the system is not in internal equilibrium the gibbs fundamental relation exists only when the system is in internal equilibrium ds t y t dx t a t di t 1 where x t and i t represent the set of observables and the set of internal variables re spectively to be collectively denote by z t the entropy s z t t away from equilibrium no matter how far from equilibrium is normally a function of z t and t however when the system is in internal equilibrium where eq 1 remains valid s t has no explicit t depenedence the temporal evolution of the entropy in this case comes from the time dependence in z t with x t and i t still independent of each other the coefficient y t and a t represent the derivatives of the entropy and are normally called the internal field and the internal affinity respectively the energy e volume v and the number of particles n play a very special role among the observables and the corresponding internal fields are given by 1 t t s t e t z t p t t t s t v t z t t t t s t n t 2 where z t denotes all other elements of z t except the one used in the derivative thus internal temperature pressure etc have a meaning only when the system comes into internal equilibrium in general the internal field y t and affinity a t are given by y t y t t t s t x t z t a t a t t t s t i t z t 3 the fields of the medium t 0 p 0 0 etc which we collectively denote by y 0 are different from the internal fields of the system unless the latter comes to equilibrium with the medium 2 system t t p t medium t p 0 0 0 fig 1 schematic representation of a system and the medium surrounding it to form an isolated system 0 the medium is described by its fields t 0 p 0 etc while the system if in internal equilibrium see text is characterized by t t p t etc the same is also true of the affinity except that the affinity vector a 0 0 for the medium see ii from now on we will only consider the case when the system is in internal equilibrium the heat transfer is given by dq t t ds t t 0 des t 4 where des t is the entropy exchange with the medium the irreversible entropy generation dis t within the system is given by dis t ds t des t 0 thus as long as the system is not in equilibrium t t 6 t 0 accordingly dis t 0 in accordance with the second law there is irreversible entropy production even when the system is in internal equilibrium the latter only allows us to introduce the internal fields and affinities via eqs 2 and 3 in the absence of any internal variables the gibbs fundamental relation is given by t t ds t de t p t dv t t dn t 5 for the special case when x t only contains e t v t and n t for a fixed number of particles the last term would be absent as said above the temperature pressure etc 3 of the medium and the system are usually different when the system is out of equilibrium with the medium only in equilibrium do they become equal in which case the gibbs fundamental relation in eq 5 reduces to the standard form t 0 dseq deeq p 0 dveq 0 dneq 6 in which none of the quantities has any time dependence the extensive quantities represent the equilibrium values and are denoted by the additional suffix one normally considers a system with fixed number of particles in which case the last term is absent in eq 6 in the following we will not explicitly show the additional suffix unless clarity is needed the following maxwell relations that follow from the gibbs fundamental relation see eq 6 are well known and can be found in any good text book such as 4 on thermodynamics t 0 v s n p 0 s v n t 0 p 0 s n v s p 0 n p 0 t 0 v n s v t 0 n s p 0 t 0 n v t 0 p 0 n 7 in equilibrium there is no explicit t dependence in z moreover the internal variable i is no longer independent of x the equilibrium field and affinity of the system become equal to those of the medium y 0 and a 0 0 see 2 thus the gibbs fundamental relation reduces to ds y 0 dx 8 compare with eq 6 the equilibrium value of the internal variable can be expressed as a function of the equilibrium value of x i ieq xeq we now observe the similarity between the gibbs fundamental relations in eqs 6 and 8 this strongly suggests that there may also exist analogs of the maxwell relations or other important relations that are based on eq 8 for a system that although not in equilibrium with the medium is in internal equilibrium in this sequel to the earlier papers 1 3 which we denote by i ii and iii respectively we develop the consequence of this internal equilibrium thermodynamics for important relations such as maxwell relations clausius clayperon equation etc these extensions will play an important role in non equilibrium systems that are nonetheless in internal equilibrium 4 the time variation of the internal temperature t of a non equilibrium system such as a glass is due to the time dependence of the observable x t such as e t v t etc and of the internal variable i t for example at fixed t 0 the internal temperature will continue to change during structural relaxation the internal temperature will also change if the temperature of the medium changes thus dt t x dx t i di the rate of change of the internal temperature can be expressed in terms of the rate of change r dt 0 dt dt dt t x dx dt t i di dt 9 similarly dt dt 0 t x dx dt 0 t i di dt 0 10 the same analysis can be carried out for other internal fields b present goal our aim in this work is to follow the consequences of internal equilibrium in a non equilibrium system to find the generalization of maxwell s relations the clausius clapeyron relation and the relations between response functions to non equilibrium states we will be also be interested in glasses in this work they are traditionally treated as non equilibrium states therefore we begin with a discussion of what is customarily called a glass and the associated glass transition in sect ii a careful discussion shows that the term does not refer to one single transition rather it can refer to different kinds of transitions some of which appear similar to the conventional transitions in equilibrium but the other refer to apparent transitions where the gibbs free energy cannot be continuous there are some well known approximate approaches to glasses we will briefly discuss them we then turn to our main goal to extend the maxwell s relations where jacobians are found to be quite useful therefore we introduce jacobians and their various important properties in sect iiia this is technical section but we provide most of the required details so that the clarity of presentation is not compromised an important part of this section is to show that the jacobians can be manipulated in a straight forward manner even in a subspace of the variables this is important as the observations require manipulating the observables and 5 not the internal variables thus the experimental space refers to a subspace sect iii b of the space where non equilibrium thermodynamics is developed thermodynamic potentials for non equilibrium states are formulated in sect iv we develop the generalization of the maxwell s relations in sect v we discuss generalization of the clausius clapeyron relation in sect vi where we also discuss the conditions for phase transitions in non equilibrium states the response functions such as the heat capacities compressibilities and the expansion coefficients and various relations among them are developed for non equilibrium states in sect sect vii the prigogine defay ratio for glasses are evaluated at various possible glass transitions in sect viii we compare our approach with some of the existing approaches in determining the ratio in this section the last section contains a brief summary of our results ii glass transitions and apparent glass transitions an example of non equilibrium systems under investigation here is a glass 5 see figs 2 and 3 a supercooled liquid l is a stationary time independent metastable state 5 which for our purpose represents an equilibrium state by not allowing the crystalline state into consideration and is shown by the curve abf under isobaric condition at a fixed pressure p 0 of the medium we will refer to the equilibrium liquid always as l in the following in contrast a non equilibrium liquid state will be designated gl here and represents a time dependent metastable state 5 the choice of gl is to remind us that it is a precursor to the eventual glass gl at a lower temperature the equilibrium liquid l is obtained by cooling the liquid l and waiting long enough at each for it to come to equilibrium with the medium however if it is obtained at a fixed cooling rate r then at some temperature t 0 g p 0 l cannot come to equilibrium and turns into gl the resulting curve bd leaves abf tangentially at b and gradually turns into an isobaric glass gl represented by the segment de at d when the viscosity becomes so large 1013 poises that it appears as a solid at b the transition is from an equilibrium liquid l to a non equilibrium liquid form gl and will be called the l gl transition in the literature it is commonly known as a transition from an ergodic state l to a non ergodic state gl in our opinion this is a misnomer as the concept of ergodicity refers to the long time indeed the infinite time behavior in this limit there will be no gl only l therefore we will refer to this transition at t t 0 g p 0 6 as a l gl transition or a precursory glass transition the true glass transition at d is not a transition from l to gl but a transition from gl to gl we will refer to the glass transition at the lower temperature t 0 g p 0 at d as the actual glass transition or simply the glass transition the transition region bd represents a time dependent metastable supercooled liquid to be distinguished from the stationary metastable supercooled liquid l denoted by abf which turns into a glass at d the expansion coefficient in the glass is almost identical to that of the corresponding crystal below d the glass continuously emerges out of gl at d whose location is also determined by the rate r of cooling the relaxation time of the system the supercooled liquid becomes equal really comparable to the observation time obs at b as seen in fig 2 the volume remains continuous at b and d at the two glass transitions the same is also true of the entropy indeed the state of the system changes continuously at b and d which is highly reproducible for a given cooling rate r or the observation time obs thus the points b and d can be taken as a well defined and unique glass transition temperatures t 0 g p 0 and t 0 g p 0 associated with the point b and d respectively in both figures both transitions represent a non equilibrium version of a continuous transition see sect vi for elaboration on this point where not only the gibbs free energy see fig 3 but also its derivatives are continuous the non equilibrium nature of the transition appears in the dependence of the value of t 0 g p 0 and t 0 g p 0 on the rate of cooling the continuity of the gibbs free energy at b and d makes them as genuine candidates as glass transition points a requirement of a transition in equilibrium thermodynamics therefore both these transitions will be collectively called conventional transitions in this work unfortunately the idea of a glass transition was formulated as a transition between l and gl thus neither of the above two glass transitions represent the glass transition in the original sense as the glass is considered a frozen state it is common to assume that over the region de the glass has its internal variables denoted by i frozen at its value ig at d even though its observables denoted by x continue to change on the other hand the internal variables and the observables continue to change over bd from their values at b to their values at d consequently the properties such as the volume of gl which is shown schematically in fig 2 gradually change to those of the glass at lower temperatures thus the glass transition from ab to de is not a sharp transition it can be argued as we have done above that b and d should be taken as the glass transition points however the 7 0 a g 0 pt a b cd e v t 0 l supercooled liquid gl glass glass transition region 0 g 0 ptf g fig 2 schematic form of isobaric v as a function of t 0 for a given cooling rate the pressure is fixed at p 0 the supercooled liquid turns gradually into a glass through the glass transition region the transition temperature t 0 g p 0 is identified as the temperature at b where the actual volume begins to deviate from the extrapolated supercooled liquid volume bc on the other hand the apparent glass transition temperature t a 0 g p 0 is the temperature where the extrapolated glass volume dc meets the extrapolated supercooled liquid volume bc as indicated in the fuigure this temperature lies in the glass transition region practice in the field is to take a point between bd as a transition point obtained by electing some well defined rule of selection see for example 6 for a good discussion of various ways of identifying the glass transition temperature one such rule commonly used is to consider the volume of the system and introduce an apparent glass transition temperature t a 0 g p 0 by the equilibrium continuation of the volume bcf of ab and by the extrapolation of the volume dcg of de to find their crossing point c the state of the glass following tool and narayanaswamy 7 8 is then customarily identified by the point c on dc however there is no reason to take the state at c to represent any real glass as the extrapolation does not have to satisfy non equilibrium thermodynamics the latter is valid only along the physical path db for the given history of preparation such as determined by the fixed rate r of cooling during vitrification the glass at t a 0 g p 0 must be described by the point on 8 f g t 0 g 0 g 0 pt c e 0 a g 0 pt transition region l gl a b c 0 d l fig 3 schematic form of the isobaric gibbs free energy g shown by the continuous curve abde as a function of the medium temperature t 0 at a fixed pressure p 0 the extrapolation of the glassy portion gl along dcg and the supercooled liquid l portion abc 0 f do not meet the glassy gibbs free energy at point the apparent glass transition c where t 0 t a 0 g p 0 is higher than that at c 0 on the continuous curve l at the same temperature t a 0 g p 0 showing that the extrapolation results in a more unstable state at the apparent glass transition c than the physical state c 0 on the continuous curve the gibbs free energies match at the glass transition temperature t 0 g p 0 at b db corresponding to t a 0 g p 0 if we wish to employ non equilibrium thermodynamics to be sure one can find a slow enough cooling rate than the one used to obtain gl at b so that the point b actually coincides with the point c on abf as the latter represents l however the gl that will emerge at c for the slower cooling rate has nothing to do with the extrapolated state c on dcg because of the continuity of the state the gl at the slower rate at c will have its a 0 and eq and will have its gibbs free energy continuous moreover the new gl will follow a curve that will be strictly below bde these aspects make the new gl different from the extrapolated gl at c taking the point c on cd to represent the glass will be an approximation which we will avoid in this work as our interest 9 is to apply thermodynamics in the study of glasses therefore we will use the extrapolation to only determine t a 0 g p 0 but the real glass and the real liquid states are determined by the curve bd and bcf respectively where our non equilibrium thermodynamics should be applicable the location of this temperature t a 0 g p 0 depends on the property being extrapolated we can use the entropy of the system to locate the apparent glass transition temperature which would invariably give a different value for the apparent glass transition temperature to call one of these temperatures as a transition temperature is a misnomer for another reason none of these temperatures represent a non equilibrium thermodynamic transition for the simple reason that the two branches dcg and bcf do not have a common gibbs free energy at t a 0 g p 0 as is clearly seen in fig 3 the branch abc 0 f represents the gibbs free energy of the equilibrium supercooled liquid while the segment de represents the gibbs free energy of the glass with the segment bd denoting the gibbs free energy of the system during the transition region the extrapolation dcg in fig 2 to determine the glass transition temperature t a 0 g p 0 corresponds to the extrapolated segment dcg in fig 3 the gibbs free energy of the glass in this extrapolation is given by the point c while the gibbs free energy of the supercooled liquid is determined by the point c 0 evidently the two free energies are very different with that of the glass higher than that of the supercooled liquid as expected from the non equilibrium nature of the glassy state the above discussion of the apparent glass transition also applies to comparing the glass at d with the corresponding l at t 0 g p 0 which will represent yet another apparent glass transition temperature this apparent glass transition has the same problem regarding the gibbs free energy as the previous one at t a 0 g p 0 however this transition differs from the apparent glass transition at t a 0 g p 0 in that the glass at t a 0 g p 0 is not a frozen state while the glass at d is a frozen glass to some extent as it also undergoes structural relaxation in time it should also be remarked that whether we consider the apparent glass transition at t 0 g p 0 or t a 0 g p 0 the transition is an example of a discontinuity in the gibbs free energy of the two states this is different from the precursory glass transition and the actual glass transition at b and d respectively where the gibbs free energy is continuous because of the discontinuity in the gibbs free energies in the apparent glass transitions at t 0 g p 0 and t a 0 g p 0 we will refer to these transitions as apparent transitions in this work indeed one can think of these transitions as an analog of a zeroth order transition 10 because of the discontinuity in the gibbs free energy however it should be remarked that the apparent transitions do not represent any transition in the system those transitions are the two conventional transitions discussed above the apparent transitions represent our desire to compare two distinct states this is like comparing the supercooled liquid with the crystal at the same temperature and pressure therefore a discontinuity in the gibbs free energy is not a violation of the principle of continuity discussed in 3 we will consider all of the above glass transitions later when we discuss the evaluation of the prigogine defay ratio 9 13 in sect viii in this ratio a non equilibrium state is compared with the equilibrium supercooled liquid state along abf in the classic approach adopted by simon 6 14 the temperature range t 0 gg p 0 t 0 g p 0 is shrunk to a point either by considering the apparent glass transition at t a 0 g p 0 or by comparing the glass state at d with the supercooled liquid l at b the latter amounts to neglecting the segment bd from consideration we will avoid this ad hoc approach in this work the only possible scenario where simon s approach is meaningful is that of the ideal glass transition 5 and references thererin in the limit the cooling rate r 0 in this limiting case the crossover region bd disappears and the ideal glass igl emerges directly out of the l at the ideal glass transition temperature t 0 ig this is a conventional continuous transition between the two stationary states igl and l both of which remain in equilibrium with the medium at t 0 p 0 there is no need to invoke any internal variable i to describe the ideal glass the observable x is sufficient for the investigation of the ideal glass transition we will revisit this point later in sect viii iii some useful mathematical tools a jacobian method jacobians 15 will be found extremely useful in this work just as they are found useful in equilibrium thermodynamics 4 see also 16 18 the n th order jacobian of u 1 u 2 un 11 with respect to x 1 x 2 xn is the n n determinant of the matrix formed by uk xl u 1 u 2 un x 1 x 2 xn u 1 x 1 u 1 x 2 u 1 xn u 2 x 1 u 2 x 2 u 2 xn un x 1 un x 2 un xn it is clear from the properties of the determinant that 1 the jacobian vanishes if any two u s are identical u 1 u 2 ui ui un x 1 x 2 xi xi 1 xn 0 2 if ui and ui 1 interchange their order the jacobian changes its sign u 1 u 2 ui 1 ui un x 1 x 2 xi xi 1 xn u 1 u 2 ui ui 1 un x 1 x 2 xi xi 1 xn 3 if any ui is equal to xi the n th order jacobian reduces to a n 1 th order jacobian formed by derivatives at fixed xi for example for n 2 we have u 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 u 1 x 1 x 2 when we consider compound transformations x 1 x 2 xn u 1 u 2 un v 1 v 2 vn the resulting jacobian is the product of the two jacobians v 1 v 2 vn u 1 u 2 un u 1 u 2 un x 1 x 2 xn v 1 v 2 vn x 1 x 2 xn the definition of a jacobian can lead to some interesting permutation rules as the following examples illustrate consider a second order jacobian u 1 u 2 x 1 x 2 u 1 x 1 u 2 x 2 u 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 which can be rearranged as u 1 u 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 x 1 x 2 u 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 u 1 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 2 x 1 x 2 0 this can be symbolically written as u 1 u 2 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 u 1 x 2 x 1 u 1 u 2 x 2 0 11 12 by suppressing the common denominator in each term the result expresses the cyclic permutation of u 1 u 2 x 1 in the three terms with the remaining variable x 2 in the same place in all terms as a second example consider some quantity u as a function of three variables x y and z and consider the following relation between the partial derivatives u x y u x y z u z x y z x y 12 in terms of jacobians it can be written as u y x y u y z x y z u x y z x y z y x y 13 which simplifies to x y z u y y z u x y z u x y y u x y z y 14 where we have added a vanishing second term on the right because y y 0 this relation is easily constructed by considering the cyclic permutation of x y z u by taking three consecutive terms at a time for the 3 jacobians with the remaining variable yielding the 2 jacobians in which the second entry is the variable y the variable that is held fixed in all derivatives in eq 12 the ordering x y z in x y z u is determined by the denominator 3 jacobian in the first term on the right in eq 13 by writing all the 3 jacobians in the non vanishing terms in eq 14 so that y is the second entry and then suppressing the second entry we obtain the following relation x z u y z u x y u x z y 0 which is identical to the relation in eq 11 if we identify u 1 with x u 2 with z x 1 with u and x 2 with y we will use the jacobians and their properties to first re express the maxwell relations as follows t 0 s n v s n p 0 v n v s n t 0 s n p 0 s n p 0 v n p 0 s n p 0 v n t 0 v n t 0 s n t 0 v n t 0 s n p 0 t 0 n p 0 v n p 0 t 0 n 15 13 we now see a very important consequence of the use of the jacobians all four maxwell relations use the same numerators t 0 s n and p 0 v n they use different denomi nators thus they can all be combined into one compact relation that can be simply written as t 0 s n p 0 v n 16 here the relation only has a meaning if each side is divided by one of the possible denomi nators v s n p 0 s n t 0 v n and p 0 t 0 n on both sides b considerations in a subspace it is very common to consider a function f x y z in a subspace consisting of x y this requires manipulating a 3 jacobians to construct a 2 jacobians of its argument thus we may consider the 2 jacobian f y x y even though f also depends on z we can manipulate such jacobians in the normal way for example we can express it as f x y f y x y f y k x x k x y k y x f y k x 17 where k x y z is another function the derivation is tedious and has been supplied in the appendix the situation can be generalized to many variables z 1 z 2 without much complications we will not do this here c some transformation rules let us consider a derivative of some quantity r either with respect to t or p in case a below or at fixed t or p in case b below which we wish to express as a derivative involving t 0 p 0 that are manipulated by the observer a the derivative is at fixed u where u has any two different elements from e v s p 0 and t 0 14 we write the derivative as r t u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 2 t u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 2 t 0 u 1 u 2 t 0 u 1 u 2 t u 1 u 2 r t 0 u 1 u 2 t t 0 u 1 u 2 18 similarly we have r p u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 2 p u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 2 p 0 u 1 u 2 p 0 u 1 u 2 p u 1 u 2 r p 0 u 1 u 2 p p 0 u 1 u 2 19 b let us consider a derivative with respect to t 0 at fixed u 2 p or t u 20 p 0 or t 0 as the case may be but u 1 is any element from e v s p 0 and t 0 r t 0 u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 2 t 0 u 1 u 20 t 0 u 1 u 20 t 0 u 1 u 2 r u 2 u 1 t 0 u 20 u 1 u 2 u 20 u 1 u 2 20 similarly r p 0 u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 2 p 0 u 1 u 20 p 0 u 1 u 20 p 0 u 1 u 2 r u 2 u 1 p 0 u 20 u 1 u 2 u 20 u 1 u 2 21 let us now consider a derivative with respect to t at fixed p or with respect to p at fixed t the derivative is at fixed u 1 where u 1 is any element from e v s p 0 and t 0 r t u 1 p r u 1 p t u 1 p r u 1 p t 0 u 1 p 0 t u 1 p t 0 u 1 p 0 22 similarly r p u 1 t r u 1 t p u 1 t r u 1 t t 0 u 1 p 0 p u 1 t t 0 u 1 p 0 23 iv thermodynamic potentials and differentials a equilibrium the forms of most useful thermodynamic potentials such as the enthalpy h the helmholtz free energy f and the gibbs free energy g of a system in equilibrium are well known and are given in terms of the energy e s v n as h e p 0 v f e t 0 s g e t 0 s p 0 v 24 where t 0 p 0 are the temperature and pressure of the system they are also the temperature and or pressure of the medium depending on the medium here we are considering 15 a system with fixed number of particles for the enthalpy the medium p 0 containing the system exerts a fixed pressure p 0 for the helmholtz free energy the medium t 0 containing the system creates a fixed temperature t 0 for the gibbs free energy the medium t 0 p 0 containing the system exerts a fixed pressure p 0 and creates a fixed temperature t 0 the potentials are legendre transforms in that the potentials are functions of the fields t 0 p 0 rather than the observables e v as the case may be these potentials have the desired property that they attain their minimum when the system is in equilibrium as discussed in i b internal equilibrium when the system is in internal equilibrium we find from the gibbs fundamental relation for fixed n which is obtained from setting dn 0 in eq 5 de tds pdv ad 25 where we have also introduced a single internal variable to allow us to discuss non equilibrium systems that are not in equilibrium with their medium but are in internal equilibrium the consideration of many internal variables is to simply replace ad a d and will not cause any extra complication thus we will mostly consider a single internal variable but the extension to many internal variables is trivial we are no longer going to exhibit the time dependence in these variables for the sake of notational simplicity of let us return to eq 25 it should be compared with eq 6 which contains t 0 p 0 we rewrite eq 25 to show the non equilibrium contribution explicitly de t 0 ds p 0 dv t t 0 ds p p 0 dv ad 26 the last two terms are due to the non equilibrium nature of the system in internal equilib rium it is now easy to see that dh t 0 ds v dp 0 t t 0 ds p p 0 dv ad df sdt 0 p 0 dv t t 0 ds p p 0 dv ad 27 dg sdt 0 v dp 0 t t 0 ds p p 0 dv ad 16 these potentials correspond to as an independent variable of the potential one can make a transformation of these potentials to potentials in which the conjugate field a 0 of the medium is the independent variable by adding a 0 the resulting potentials will be denoted by a superscript a on the potential ea e a 0 h a h a 0 f a f a 0 g a g a 0 however as discussed in ii a 0 0 thus there is no difference in the values of the two potentials and the transformation is of no use in equilibrium the internal fields t p attain their equilibrium values t 0 p 0 of the medium and the affinity a vanishes identically because of a 0 0 v maxwell relations for systems in internal equilibrium from now on we will always consider the case of a constant n therefore we will no longer exhibit it anymore the maxwell relation in eq 16 will then be denoted simply as t 0 s p 0 v the field parameters that appear in the maxwell relation are the parameters t 0 p 0 of the medium which because of the existence of equilibrium also represent the field parameters of the system the maxwell relation is a relation between the pairs t 0 s and p 0 v each pair formed by the extensive variable and its conjugate field we will call these pairs conjugate pairs in this work for a system described by only two conjugate pairs there is only one possible maxwell relation for a system described by three conjugate pairs there will be three different maxwell relations between them for a system described by k conjugate pairs there will be k k 1 2 different maxwell relations as the system in internal equilibrium is very similar in many respects with an equilibrium system as discussed in i and ii there may be analogs of the maxwell relations for systems in internal equilibrium the question then arises as to the field parameters that must appear in the maxwell relations when the system is not in equilibrium but only in internal equilibrium we now turn to answer this question because of the absence of equilibrium we must now also include the internal variable in the discussion thus we expect three different maxwell relations between 17 a maxwell relation t s p v at fixed we start with eq 25 and observe that e s v t e v s p e s v a 28 using the first two derivative at fixed we find that 2 e v s t v s 2 e s v p s v as we are allowed to interchange the order of derivatives in the above cross derivative we have t v s p s v which can be written using jacobians as t s s v p v s v this suggests the existence of the maxwell relation t s p v between the conjugate pairs t s and p v at fixed to check its validity for other potentials with as an independent variable we consider the differential dg in eq 27 and note that g t 0 p 0 s t t 0 s t 0 p 0 p 0 p v t 0 p 0 g p 0 t 0 v t t 0 s p 0 t 0 p 0 p v t 0 p 0 we use these derivatives to evaluate the cross derivative 2 g p 0 t 0 to conclude that s p 0 t 0 t t 0 2 s t 0 p 0 t p 0 t 0 s t 0 p 0 p 0 p 2 v p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 p p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 v t 0 p 0 t t 0 2 s p 0 t 0 t t 0 p 0 s p 0 t 0 p 0 p 2 v p 0 t 0 s p 0 t 0 p t 0 p 0 v p 0 t 0 18 this is simplified to yield t p 0 t 0 s t 0 p 0 t t 0 p 0 s p 0 t 0 p p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 p t 0 t 0 v p 0 p 0 in terms of the jacobians this can be written as t s t 0 p 0 p v t 0 p 0 thus justifying the maxwell relation t s p v 29 at fixed this relation must be satisfied at every point on the curve abde that describes the vitrification process this maxwell relation turns into the identity t s p 0 s p v p 0 s for the enthalpy and t s t 0 v p v t 0 v 30 for the helmholtz free energy and are easily verified b maxwell relation t s v a v at fixed v we again start with eqs 25 and 28 and evaluate the cross derivative 2 e s v to obtain 2 e s v t s v 2 e s v a s v we thus have t s v a s v which can be written using jacobians as t s v s v a v s v 19 this suggests the existence of the maxwell relation t s v a v between the conjugate pairs t s and a at fixed v to check its validity for other potentials with v as an independent variable we consider the differential df in eq 27 and note that f t 0 v s t t 0 s t 0 v f v t 0 a t t 0 s v t 0 we now evaluate the cross derivative 2 f t 0 v and obtain the equality s t 0 v s t 0 v t t 0 v t t 0 2 s t 0 v a t 0 v t t 0 v 1 s t 0 v t t 0 2 s t 0 v which leads to the relation a v t 0 v t s v t 0 v this confirms that the maxwell relation between the conjugate pairs t s and a at fixed v is the following t s v a v 31 c maxwell relation p v s a s at fixed s we again start with eqs 25 and 28 and evaluate the cross derivative 2 e v s to obtain 2 e v s p s v 2 e v s a v s we thus have p s v a v s which can be written using jacobians as p v s v s a s v s this suggests the existence of the maxwell relation p v s a s between the conjugate pairs p v and a at fixed s to check its validity for other potentials with s 20 as an independent variable we consider the differential dh in eq 27 and note that h p 0 s v p p 0 v p 0 s f s p 0 a p p 0 v s t 0 we now evaluate the cross derivative 2 h p 0 s and obtain the equality v p 0 s v p 0 s p p 0 s p p 0 2 v p 0 s a p 0 s p p 0 s 1 v p 0 s p p 0 2 v p 0 s which leads to the relation a s p 0 s p v s p 0 s this confirms that the maxwell relation between the conjugate pairs p v and a at fixed s is the following p v s a s 32 one can easily check that this maxwell relation also works with other thermodynamic potentials like f and g we will satisfy ourselves by giving the demonstration for f only the natural variables for f are t 0 and v however instead of using v as the independent variable we will use s as the independent variable so that it can be held fixed for constant s the differential df from eq 27 reduces to df s sdt 0 pdv ad so that f t 0 s s p v t 0 s f s t 0 a p v s t 0 now evaluating the cross derivative 2 f t 0 s we find that a t 0 s p t 0 s v t 0 s p 2 v t 0 s v t 0 s p t 0 s p 2 v p 0 s 21 this now immediately leads to a s t 0 s p v s t 0 s 33 and confirms our claim that the maxwell relation is given by eq 32 d general maxwell relations with system variables only we wish to emphasize that the maxwell relation in eq 33 requires keeping s fixed so that we must divide eq 32 by t 0 s on both sides we must not use the independent variables t 0 and v of f for the division and keep t 0 fixed this will not give be a maxwell relation we demonstrate this explicitly by evaluating 2 f v t 0 two different ways and equating the results a simple calculation yields p v t 0 s v t 0 t v t 0 t t 0 2 s v t 0 a v t 0 s v t 0 t v t 0 t t 0 2 s v t 0 in terms of jacobians the above equation can be rewritten as a t 0 v t 0 p v t 0 v t 0 t s t 0 v t 0 34 this relation from the cross derivative requires keeping t 0 fixed however t 0 characterizes the medium and only indirectly characterizes the system in internal equilibrium in a similar way using the cross derivatives of the gibbs free energy at fixed t 0 and at fixed p 0 we find the following relations a p 0 t 0 p 0 t s p 0 t 0 p 0 p v p 0 t 0 p 0 a t 0 t 0 p 0 p v t 0 t 0 p 0 t s t 0 t 0 p 0 35 we now wish to observe that the maxwell relations appear only when we keep the quantities of the system t p s v a or fixed we have already seen the maxwell relations with fixed s v and we will now consider keeping t fixed to demonstrate our point for fixed t we obtain the following maxwell relation a t t 0 t p v t t 0 t 36 22 as can easily be checked by evaluating the cross derivative 2 f t 0 t at fixed t the calculation is identical to that carried out in obtaining eq 33 one can easily check that keeping p or a also gives us new maxwell relations a p t 0 p t s p t 0 p t s a t 0 a p v a t 0 a vi clausius clapeyron relation as a system in internal equilibrium is not very different from that in equilibrium except that its gibbs free energy g t continuously decreases until it reaches equilibrium with the medium it is possible for the system to exist in two distinct phases that have the same gibbs free energy at some instant such a non equilibrium phase transition situation will arise for example when an isotropic supercooled liquid can turn into a liquid crystal phase this is not a novel idea as there are several attempts in the literature 19 22 and references therin where such non equilibrium phase transitions have been investigated therefore let us now consider the possibility of the system being in two different phases at some time as experiments are carried out by controlling observables only and not the internal variables it is important to consider thermodynamic quantities as a function ofx only and not ofx i in all cases restricting ourselves to a single internal variable and to e and v we will treat thermodynamic quantities not only as a function of three independent variables but will also have the need to consider them as a function of observables or associated fields t 0 p 0 in particular the clausius clapeyron relation is obtained in the t 0 p 0 plane a subspace see sect iii b let us consider the two phases which we denote by 1 and 2 in the system we will use subscripts 1 and 2 to refer to the quantities in the two phases in internal equilibrium the entropy s of the system is a function of the averages x t i t along with the fixed number of particles n it is important to include n in our consideration as the two phases will contain number of particles n 1 and n 2 that are not constant except in equilibrium obviously x t x 1 t x 2 t i t i 1 t i 2 t n n 1 t n 2 t then we can express the entropy of the system as a sum over the two phases s x t i t n s 1 x 1 t i 1 t n 1 t s 2 x 2 t i 2 t n 2 t 23 which takes its maximum possible value for given x t i t n in internal equilibrium thus ds x t i t n ds 1 x 1 t i 1 t n 1 t ds 2 x 2 t i 2 t n 2 t 0 in internal equilibrium this can only happen if y 1 t y 2 t a 1 t a 2 t 1 t t 1 t 2 t t 2 t see eqs 1 3 and 2 for the restricted case under consideration this results in the equality t 1 t t 2 t p 1 t p 2 t 1 t 2 t a 1 t a 2 t for the internal fields and affinity along the coexistence of the two phases it also follows from the continuity of the gibbs free energy 1 that the gibbs free energies of the two pure phases n 1 n and n 2 n must be equal at the coexistence we will only consider the two pure phases below and not a mixture of the two as the numbers of particles in the two pure phases are constant we will no longer consider them anymore in the discussion we now consider the t 0 p 0 plane relevant for the observation of coexistence since the gibbs free energy is continuous along the transition line g t 0 p 0 t 0 0 where p 0 t 0 is the pressure along the transition line thus d g g t 0 p 0 dt 0 g p 0 t 0 dp 0 using d g 0 yields dt 0 dp 0 coex g t 0 p 0 g p 0 t 0 0 37 along the coexistence using dg from eq 27 gives us g t 0 p 0 s t t 0 s t 0 p 0 p p 0 v t 0 p 0 a t 0 p 0 38 g p 0 t 0 v t t 0 s p 0 t 0 p p 0 v p 0 t 0 a p 0 t 0 39 24 putting the above two equations in eq 37 we get the following clausius clapeyron equation for coexistence of phases in internal equilibrium dt 0 dp 0 coex v t t 0 s p 0 t 0 p p 0 v p 0 t 0 a p 0 t 0 s t t 0 s t 0 p 0 p p 0 v t 0 p 0 a t 0 p 0 40 we now express s p 0 t 0 in terms of v t 0 p 0 by using the maxwell relation p v t s and by using eq 17 f s k v x p 0 and y t 0 as follows s t 0 p 0 t 0 s t 0 s t p v p 0 v p 0 v p 0 t 0 which immediately gives s p 0 t 0 p p 0 v t t 0 s v t 0 p 0 41 which can now be used in the clausius clapeyron equation to express it in terms of mea surable quantities assuming that p t can be measured in equilibrium t t 0 p p 0 and a 0 so that the above equation reduces to the well known version dt 0 dp 0 eq coex v s 42 as expected vii response functions in internal equilibrium a c p and c v the heat capacities with respect to the internal temperature at fixed p or v are c p t s t p c v t s t v c p t s t p c v t s t v we again start from the fundamental relation in eq 48 and evaluate the derivative t s t p t s t v t s v t v t p 25 which can be rewritten in two equivalent forms cp cv t s p t v t p v p t 43 or cp cv t p t v v t p 44 where we have used the maxwell relation in eq 29 after we divide it by v t as s p v is not directly measurable the identity in eq 44 is more useful from a practical point of view however we need to transform the various derivatives in it to the derivatives with respect to t 0 at fixed p 0 or v by using the transformation rules in sect iii c as it is the pair t 0 p 0 that can be manipulated by the observer however the identities still contains c p and c v which are defined with respect to t and not with respect to t 0 therefore we now turn to heat capacities obtained as a derivative with respect to t 0 b cp and cv from eq 4 we have cp q t 0 p 0 t s t 0 p 0 cv q t 0 v t s t 0 v 45 cp q t 0 p 0 t s t 0 p 0 cv q t 0 v t s t 0 v 46 it would have been more appropriate to express the capacities cp and cp as cp 0 and cp 0 but we will use the simpler notation this should cause no confusion introducing the expansion coefficient p 1 v v t 0 p 0 p 1 v v t 0 p 0 47 we find that cp p tv s p 0 t 0 p 0 v p 0 t 0 p 0 tv s p 0 v p 0 tv s v p 0 the same discussion can be applied to cp and p with a similar result cp p tv s p 0 t 0 p 0 v p 0 t 0 p 0 tv s p 0 v p 0 tv s v p 0 26 let us now consider the relation between cp and cv and between cp and cv for which we consider s as a function of t v and which follows from eq 25 so that ds s t dt s v dv s d 48 therefore s t 0 p 0 s t v t t 0 p 0 s v t v t 0 p 0 now using eq 18 we have s t v s t 0 v t t 0 v 49 similarly using the maxwell relation in eq 30 we have s v t v p v t 0 v t 0 v t p t 0 v t t 0 v 50 we thus finally obtain s t 0 p 0 t t 0 v s t 0 v t t 0 p 0 p t 0 v v t 0 p 0 after multiplying by t on both sides we obtain the desired relation between cp and cv for the non equilibrium case cp t t 0 v cv t t 0 p 0 t p t 0 v v t 0 p 0 51 this relation generalize the following standard equilibrium relation c eq p c eq v t 0 p 0 t 0 v v t 0 p 0 obtained by setting t t 0 v t t 0 p 0 1 we can obtain a standard form of the above heat capacity relations as in eq 43 as follows cv t s v t 0 v t s v t 0 p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 we thus finally have cp cv t s p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 v p 0 t 0 cv t s v t 0 v t 0 p 0 52 27 which is an extension of eq 43 although tedious it is straightforward to show that this relation is identical to the above relation one needs to evaluate s v t 0 as follows s v t 0 s t 0 v t v t v t 0 t t 0 v s v t t 0 t v s t v t 0 v t where we must now use eqs 50 and 49 we finally obtain s v t 0 t t 0 v p t 0 v t 0 t v t 0 t v s t 0 v t 0 t v t 0 v t 53 the equivalence is now established by the use of the permutation property given in eq 11 in a similar fashion we find that cp cv t s v t 0 v t 0 p 0 54 where we must use see sect iii b s v t 0 t t 0 v p t 0 v t 0 t v t 0 t v s t 0 v t 0 t v t 0 v t 55 obtained in a similar fashion as eq 53 it is important at this point to relate cp with cp and cv with cv for this it is convenient to consider the differential ds by treating s as a function of t 0 p 0 and we find that cp cp t s t 0 p 0 t 0 p 0 cv cv t s p 0 v t 0 v 56 c compressibilities kt and ks the two important isothermal compressibilities are kt 1 v v p 0 t 0 kt 1 v v p 0 t 0 which we need to relate to the corresponding adiabatic compressibility ks 1 v v p 0 s ks 1 v v p 0 s 28 however we first consider the relation between the compressibility and the expansion coef ficient we find that kt p v t 0 t 0 p 0 v p 0 t 0 p 0 v t 0 v p 0 t 0 p 0 v the same discussion can be applied to kt and p with a similar result kt p t 0 p 0 v the relation between kt and kt and between ks and ks are obtained by treating v as a function of t 0 p 0 and and of s p 0 and respectively using dv v t 0 p 0 dt 0 v p 0 t 0 dp 0 v t 0 p 0 d 57 dv v s p 0 ds v p 0 s dp 0 v s p 0 d 58 we find that kt kt 1 v v t 0 p 0 p 0 t 0 ks ks 1 v v s p 0 p 0 s 59 which is similar to similar relations for the heat capacity in eq 56 we similarly find that p p 1 v v t 0 p 0 t 0 p 0 60 let us consider v p 0 t 0 v p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 t 0 v s p 0 s p 0 s p 0 t 0 v t 0 v s v p 0 s cp cv similarly we find that see sect iii b v p 0 t 0 v p 0 s cp cv thus we have the standard identity for both kinds of compressibility cp cv kt ks cp cv kt ks 61 let us again consider ks rewriting v p 0 s v s p 0 t 0 p 0 s p 0 t 0 v p 0 t 0 s p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 s t 0 p 0 we find that kt ks s p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 v s t 0 p 0 ks s p 0 t 0 v s p 0 29 viii prigogine defay ratio let us consider figs 2 and 3 again that describe various kinds of glass transitions the apparent transitions at t 0 g point d and t a 0 g point c and the conventional transitions at t 0 g point d and t 0 g point b from the discussion in sect ii we know that the gibbs free energies have a discontinuity between the two states involved at the apparent transitions even the volumes and the entropies exhibit discontinuities at these transitions on the other hand the gibbs free energies volumes and entropies have no discontinuities at the conventional transitions at t 0 g and t 0 g due to the continuity of the state let us introduce the difference q qi qii 62 for any quantity q at a given t 0 p 0 in the two possible states i and ii for the apparent glass transition at t 0 g qi qii are the values of q in gl and l respectively at t 0 g for the apparent glass transition at t a 0 g qi qii are the values of q in gl and l respectively at t a 0 g for the conventional glass transition at t 0 g qi qii are the values of q in the glass gl and gl respectively at t 0 g for the precursory glass transition at t 0 g qi qii are the values of q in gl and l respectively at t 0 g these states are summarized in the table below table various states apparent t 0 g apparent t a 0 g conventional t 0 g conventional t 0 g i gl gl gl gl ii l l l gl in terms of the discontinuities cp kt and p the prigogine defay ratio 9 is traditionally defined as 9 13 23 25 trad cp kt v t 0 p 2 where it is assumed that the volume is the same in both states at t 0 p 0 as is evident from earlier work as we will see below the volume is normally not continuous at the apparent glass transitions used in most experimental and theoretical analyses of the glass transition to allow for this possibility we will consider the following equivalent definition 30 of the prigogine defay ration in this work cp kt t 0 v p p 63 where we have absorbed v in one of the p factors it is clear that is not different from trad when the volume is the same as happens for conventional transitions as the experimentalists have no control over the internal variables and can only ma nipulate the observables x by controlling the fields y 0 of the medium we will discuss the evaluation of the prigogine defay ratio in the subspace of y 0 of the complete thermodynamic space of y 0 a 0 we will consider the simplest possible case in which the subspace reduces to the t 0 p 0 plane therefore we will restrict ourselves to this plane in the following knowing very well that the gl and gl are also determined by the set of internal variables see sect iii b we will consider the general case of several internal variables k k 1 2 n a conventional transitions at t 0 g and t 0 g we will first consider the prigogine defay ratio g at the conventional transitions at points b and d see figs 2 and 3 the continuity of the state across b and d means that e v and s remain continuous across the conventional transitions at b and d this is consistent with the continuity of the gibbs free energy let us first consider the transition at b where the relaxation time of the system becomes equal to the observation time scale obs so that both states gl and l remain in equilibrium with the medium thus t t 0 p p 0 and a a 0 0 for both states at b therefore there is no need to consider the internal variables in the gibbs free energy as they are not independent variables moreover v g p 0 t 0 and s g t 0 p 0 thus the gibbs free energy and its derivatives with respect to t 0 p 0 are continuous at b the second derivatives need not be it is clear that b represents a point that resembles a continuous transition in equilibrium it turns into a glass transition curve t 0 g p 0 of continuous transitions in the t 0 p 0 plane for the transition at d we have a glass gl on the low temperature side and gl at the high temperature side both states are out of equilibrium and have the same temperature t t and pressure p t different from t 0 p 0 respectively at the transition similarly a t 6 0 is the same in both states the important characteristics of the conventional transitions are the continuity of e v and s at b and d we now follow the consequences of these 31 continuities 1 continuity of volume from the continuity of the volume we have d g lnv g lnv t 0 p 0 dt 0 g lnv p 0 t 0 dp 0 0 64 where gq denotes the difference in eq 62 at the conventional glass transitions and the derivatives are also evaluated at the transition points this equation can be written in terms of the compressibilities and the expansion coefficients in the two states at the glass transition temperature t 0 g or t 0 g dt 0 dp 0 tr gkt g p 65 the isothermal compressibility kt and the isobaric expansion coefficient p are given in eqs 45 and 47 respectively and can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of the internal variable such as given in eqs 59 and 60 for a single internal variable we make no assumption about these derivatives such as their vanishing or any assumption about freezing of at its value at b indeed we expect to change continuously over bc of course we must remember that is an independent thermodynamic variable in gl and gl states only and not in the l state 2 the slope equation 65 determines the variation of t 0 g or t 0 g with the medium pressure p 0 along the glass transition curve t 0 g g p 0 in the t 0 p 0 plane regardless of the form of the above equation does not depend on the number of internal variables provided we use the proper definitions of kt and p as given in eqs 45 and 47 respectively its form follows from the continuity of the volume at the conventional glass transition 2 continuity of entropy from the continuity of the entropy at t 0 g we similarly have d gs g s t 0 p 0 dt 0 g s p 0 t 0 g dp 0 0 66 from which we obtain at the precursory glass transition at b dt 0 g dp 0 tr t 0 g v p gcp vgt 0 g p gcp 67 32 where we have used the equilibrium maxwell relation s p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 v p see eq 7 or eq 41 applied to this case here vg is the common volume of gl and l at b and has been taken out of g v p again this relation for the slope is quite general independent of the number of internal variables in gl state at lower temperatures t 0 t 0 g accordingly g gcp gkt vgt 0 g p 2 1 68 as expected for equilibrium states it is a consequence of the glass transition being a con tinuous transition between equilibrium states at b as we will see below it is not merely a consequence of the continuity of volume and entropy simultaneously let us now consider the glass transition at t 0 g it follows from eq 45 that g s t 0 p 0 gcp t in conjunction with eq 41 we find that dt 0 g dp 0 tr vgt g p gcp p p 0 v t t 0 s where vg is the common volume of gl and gl at d and has been taken out of g v p we finally obtain g gcp gkt vgt 0 g p 2 t t 0 p p 0 v t t 0 s 6 1 69 for the conventional glass transition at d the deviation of g from unity is independent of the number of internal variables it will be different from unity even if we have no internal variables b apparent glass transitions at t a 0 g and t 0 g unfortunately it is not a common practice to determine the prigogine defay ratio at the conventional transitions at temperatures t 0 g p 0 or t 0 g p 0 which resemble continuous transition in that the volume and entropy are continuous along with the gibbs free energy in experiments one determines the ratio at apparent glass transitions either at d or at t a 0 g p 0 in the glass transition region bd see figs 2 and 3 in these transitions there are discontinuities in the g e v and s the extrapolated point c see fig 2 identifies the apparent glass transition temperature t a 0 g p 0 which cannot be treated as a transition 33 temperature because the gibbs free energy in the two states gl and l are not equal as is clearly seen in fig 3 it is clear from fig 2 that the volume is also different in gl and l at the apparent glass transition t a 0 g p 0 the discontinuity of the volume should not be confused with the continuity of the extrapolated volumes used to determine the location of the phenomenological glass transition t a 0 g p 0 the extrapolated glass volume does not represent the physical volume of the glass at t a 0 g p 0 given by the point on the curve bd in fig 2 the discontinuity is between the physical volumes of gl and l at t a 0 g p 0 we already know that both the entropy and the enthalpy of the glass continue to decrease during vitrification as the system relaxes 1 indeed the volume of the glass or gl also relaxes towards that of the supercooled liquid l this will also be true at t a 0 g p 0 so that the volume and the entropy of gl are higher than their values in the supercooled liquid at t a 0 g p 0 in a vitrification process the same sort of discontinuities also occur at d in the following we will take into account these discontinuities in the volume and entropy in determining the prigogine defay ratio at the apparent glass transitions at t 0 g p 0 and t a 0 g p 0 the discontinuity of volume a g v 6 0 causes a modification of eq 64 at these transitions dt 0 dp 0 tr lnv a p a g kt a g p a g kt a g p 1 a g vp 70 in terms of lnv a p d a g lnv dp 0 tr 71 at t a 0 g or t 0 g as the case may be the three a g s are the difference in eq 62 evaluated at t a 0 g or t 0 g and the new quantity a g vp has an obvious definition a g vp lnv a p a g kt 72 at the appropriate temperature this contribution would vanish under the approximation a g lnv 0 or lnv a p 0 the slope equation 70 must always be satisfied at the apparent glass transition temperature the quantity lnv a p in it represents the variation of the discontinuity a g lnv lnvi t 0 p 0 lnvii t 0 p 0 with pressure along the apparent glass transition curve t a 0 g p 0 or t 0 g p 0 and can also be found experimentally indeed we can treat a g lnv as a function of p 0 g p 0 t a 0 g along 34 the transition curves then the contribution from the volume discontinuity is given by lnv a p 1 vi dvi p 0 dp 0 tr 1 vii dvii p 0 dp 0 tr 73 we can use eqs 59 and 60 to express the slope in terms of gkt and g p dt 0 dp 0 tr lnv a p a g kt v i p 0 tr vi a g p v i t 0 tr vi 74 where v g represents the derivative vi t 0 p 0 and vi is the gl volume at t 0 g or the gl volume at t a 0 g the contribution from the l state is absent due to the vanishing of the affinity a 0 0 in the l let us now consider the differential of the entropy difference at the apparent glass tran sition in the t 0 p 0 plane d a g s a g s t 0 p 0 dt 0 a g s p 0 t 0 dp 0 from which we find that dt 0 dp 0 tr s a p a g s p 0 t 0 a g s t 0 p 0 75 with s a p d a g s dp 0 tr 76 it represents the rate of variation of the entropy discontinuity a g s si t 0 p 0 sii t 0 p 0 along the apparent glass transition curves following the steps in deriving eq 73 we find that the contribution from the entropy discontinuity is given by s a p dsi p 0 dp 0 tr dsii p 0 dp 0 tr 77 the derivative si p 0 t 0 in the second term in the numerator in eq 75 can be manipulated as in eq 41 s t 0 p 0 t 0 s t 0 v p 0 p 0 v p 0 t 0 v t 0 p 0 s t 0 v p 0 35 in which the last jacobian reduces to unity under equilibrium by the use of the maxwell relation v p p 0 s t t 0 we therefore write s t 0 v p 0 p p 0 v t t 0 s 1 siv s for the glassy state this equation also defines the modification siv p given by siv s p p 0 v t t 0 s 1 78 for the glassy state where t p are the internal temperature pressure of the glassy state it vanishes under the approximation t t 0 and p p 0 we now have si p 0 t 0 vi t 0 p 0 1 siv s vi 1 s i v s i p for the supercooled liquid which represents an equilibrium state we evidently have sii sl sl p 0 t 0 vl t 0 p 0 vl l p so that a g s p 0 t 0 a g v p vi i p s i v s we now turn to the denominator in eq 75 for the supercooled liquid state whose temperature is t 0 we have sl t 0 p 0 clp t 0 we must use t a 0 g or t 0 g for t 0 to evaluate this slope at the appropriate apparent glass transition for the glass whose internal temperature is t we have si t 0 p 0 cip t 1 t i cip t 0 where we have introduced a correction parameter t i t a 0 g g t 1 79 with t a 0 g g denoting t a 0 g or t 0 g as the case may be again this modification term vanishes under the approximation t t 0 we thus find that t 0 a g s t 0 p 0 a g cp c i p t i 36 equating the two different versions of the slope in eqs 70 and 75 we have a g kt a g p

us assume that the discontinuities in the volume and entropy are negligible or that the contributions lnv a p and s a p are negligible in that case the prigogine defay ratio reduces to ga 1 vi i p s 1 v s a g v p 1 cip t i a g cp and will have a value different than 1 thus the continuity of volume and entropy alone is not sufficient to yield ga 1 as noted above if we further approximate t t 0 and p p 0 then s i v s 0 and t i 0 and we obtain ga 1 this is expected as the approximations change the apparent glass transition into a continuous transition if however we only assume p p 0 but allow t to be different from t 0 then siv s 1 t t 0 si 1 and we still have ga 6 1 37 2 approximation b we make no assumption about lnv a p and s a p but approximate t t 0 and p p 0 in this case siv s 0 and t i 0

as far as we know almost all previous attempts 9 13 23 25 in the evaluation of are based on treating the glass transition as a direct transition from l to gl the structure is supposed to be almost frozen in the latter as we see from figs 2 and 3 this can only occur at c between l and the extrapolated branch dc at c there will be a discontinuity between the values of the internal variable it will take the equilibrium value eq c in l but will take a non equilibrium value etrac 6 eq c obtained along dc similarly a a 0 0 in l at c while a ac 6 0 in the extrapolated gl at c as c is obtained by matching the volumes the volume remains continuous but there is no reason to believe that the entropy will remain continuous in this transition the gibbs free energy obviously remains discontinuous in this transition however we have been careful in not treating this transition as an apparent transition above for the simple reason that there is no guarantee that the branch dc can be described by vitrification thermodynamics at the constant cooling rate r to see it most easily we observe that as the cooling rate is gradually taken to be slower and slower the transition point b gradually moves towards c along bf however the analog of bd will most certainly not be identical to dc for the simple reason that the state of l will continuously change to gl so that the values of and a in gl at c will be identical to their values eq c and a 0 in l at c moreover there is no guarantee that the extrapolated branch dc can even satisfy thermodynamics with known controllable parameters t 0 p 0 and r to treat this transition as a glass transition requires some approximation which we have avoided 38 ix conclusions we have followed the consequences of internal equilibrium to derive generalizations of equilibrium thermodynamic relations such as maxwell s relations clausius clapeyron re lation relations between response functions heat capacities compressibilities etc to non equilibrium systems non equilibrium states are described not only by internal fields temperature pressure etc that are different from the medium but also described by in ternal variables which cannot be controlled from outside by the observer the observer can only control the observables thus in this work we have also discussed how the thermody namics should be described in the subspace of the observables only as glasses are a prime example of non equilibrium states we have reviewed the notion of the glass transition the frozen structure known as the glass gl does not emerge directly out of the equilibrium supercooled liquid l there is an intermediate non equilibrium state gl that is not yet frozen when it emerges continuously out of the equilibrium liquid l at a lower temperature this state continuously turns into gl because of this we find that there is no one unique non equilibrium transition we introduce four of the most conceptually useful transitions at two of them which we term conventional glass transitions the gibbs free energies and the states are continuous thus they are the non equilibrium analog of the conventional continuous or second order transition between equilibrium states at the other two glass transitions which we term apparent glass transition not only the states but also the gibbs free energies are discontinuous because of this these transitions are examples of a zeroth order transition where the free energy is discontinuous but there is no transition in the system itself at the apparent glass transition as discussed in sect ii we briefly review the use of jacobians which are found extremely useful in obtaining the generalization of the maxwell relations there are many other maxwell relations than reported here they can be easily constructed we then discuss various response functions and obtain relationship between them in non equilibriums states surprisingly many of these relations look similar in form to those found in equilibrium thermodynamics we finally evaluate the prigogine defay ratio at the four possible glass transitions we find that the ratio is normally different than 1 except at the conventional glass transition at the highest temperature where it is always equal to 1 regardless of the number of internal variables we also find that the continuity of volume and entropy is not a guarantee for 39 1 we
