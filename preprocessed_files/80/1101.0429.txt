residual entropy p d gujrati departments of physics department of polymer science the university of akron akron oh 44325 september 28 2010 abstract to investigate the consequences of component confinement such as at a glass transition and the well known energy or enthalpy gap between the glass and the perfect crystal at absolute zero see text we follow our previous approach phys rev e 81 051130 2010 of using the second law applied to an isolated system 0 consisting of the homogeneous system and the medium we establish on general grounds the continuity of the gibbs free energy g t of as a function of time at fixed temperature and pressure of the medium it immediately follows from this and the observed continuity of the enthalpy during component confinement that the entropy s of the open system must remain continuous during a component confinement such as at a glass transition we use these continuity properties and the recently developed non equilibrium thermodynamics to formulate thermodynamic principles of additivity reproducibility continuity and stability that must also apply to non equilibrium systems in internal equilibrium we find that the irreversibility during a glass transition only justifies the residual entropy sr to be at least as much as that determined by disregarding the irreversibility a common practice in the field this justifies a non zero residual entropy sr in glasses which is also in accordance with the energy or enthalpy gap at absolute zero we develop a statistical formulation of the entropy of a non equilibrium system which results in the continuity of entropy during component confinement in accordance with the second law and sheds light on the mystery behind the residual entropy which is consistent with the recent conclusion symmetry 2 1201 2010 drawn by us electronic address pdg uakron edu 1 http arxiv org abs 1101 0429 v 2 mailto pdg uakron edu i introduction a irreversibility in the previous two papers 1 2 to be referred to as i and ii respectively here we initiated a general statistical mechanical investigation of non equilibrium systems undergoing irreversible changes during approach to their equilibrium state it is a very general approach that is not restricted to glasses alone but covers all non equilibrium situations in i we deal with homogeneous systems while in ii we deal with inhomogeneous systems the approach is truly statistical mechanical in nature and is based on applying the second law of thermodynamics to an extremely large isolated system which we denote by 0 it consists of the macroscopic system of interest in a medium denoted by containing it see fig 1 we will use body in this work to refer to any of the three systems according to the second law the entropy s 0 of an isolated system 0 which is a sum of the entropies s and s of the system and the medium respectively s 0 t s t s t 1 can never decrease in time 3 8 ds 0 t dt 0 2 any change in the entropy of the isolated system is due to irrevesibility so that dis 0 ds 0 0 and des 0 0 in the standard notation 1 2 9 11 even for a body which is not isolated dis ds des 0 with des 0 6 0 indeed the latter can be of any sign two important observations about the entropy s 0 are in order for eq 2 to have a content 1 the entropy s 0 exists under all conditions thus it includes the situation when 0 is not in equilibrium or when undergoes a glass transition 2 the entropy s 0 is a continuous function of all its arguments z 0 t see below not shown in eq 2 and the time t which is shown what happens inside the isolated system loss of ergodicity in parts of 0 due to compo nent confinement chemical reactions phase changes turbulence viscous deformation inside it etc cannot affect the direction of the inequality which makes it the most general princi ple of non equilibrium thermodynamics 1 2 9 11 all the above entropies in addition to 2 system t t p t medium t p 0 0 0 fig 1 schematic representation of a system and the medium surrounding it to form an isolated system 0 the medium is described by its fields t 0 p 0 etc while the system if in internal equilibrium see text is characterized by t t p t etc being an explicit function of time t are also functions of extensive observables and internal variables see ii for more details that themselves may vary with time of the observables the energy volume and the number of particles are the most important extensive observ ables from an experimental point of view in the sequel to the above two paper i and ii we focus on non equilibrium thermodynamic principles dictating the behavior of a homogeneous system the general way its non equilibrium entropy should behave during relaxation the way s is determined in terms of its microstates and the way s must behave when the system becomes confined to a component of the phase space 12 14 during some interval of time for example at a glass transition and the concept of the residual entropy the entropy that will have at absolute zero as our interest is in investigating the out of equilibrium properties of we will assume throughout this work and as was done in i and ii that the medium is in internal equilibrium at all times as a consequence has a well defined constant temperature t 0 pressure p 0 and other fields and affinities see below at all times in contrast the system may have no well defined temperature pressure etc unless it is also in internal equilibrium in which case we will denote their instantaneous values by t t p t etc see i for details they are usually different from the those of the medium unless equilibrium is reached which occurs as t it was shown in i that t t t 0 in 3 a cooling and t t t 0 in a heating experiment and that dq t t ds t t 0 des t 3 where des t represents the entropy exchange with the medium the irreversible entropy generation or the uncompensated transformation of clausius and de donder 9 11 within the system is represented by dis t ds t des t 0 b determination of entropy the entropy can now be calculated in principle by using eq 3 even when the process is irreversible as the experimentalist has a control over t 0 p 0 the entropy can be calculated by varying t 0 keeping p 0 fixed the heat capacity cp at constant p 0 in terms of the enthalpy h t and the volume v t is given by cp t h t t 0 p 0 p t p 0 v t t 0 p 0 4 see i so that ds t cp t t dt 0 cpdt 0 t 0 in cooling cpdt 0 t 0 in heating 5 and can be used to obtain the entropy using the standard integration process s t 0 s 0 t 0 0 cpdt 0 t t sc s 0 t 0 0 cpdt 0 t 0 sc in cooling s 0 t 0 0 cpdt 0 t 0 sc in heating 6 where s 0 is the entropy at absolute zero and sc represents the sum of all possible discontinuities over the range 0 t 0 mainly due to latent heats at possible first order tran sitions it also includes any possible entropy discontinuity due to component confinement the above inequalities are a simple extension of is a well known classic result 15 which has been rederived in our approach because of a non negative heat capacity the entropy is a monotonic increasing function of the temperature s t 0 0 7 for all finite temperatures the presence of an internal order parameter can also be accounted for as we will discuss later we find that the integral t 0 0 cpdt 0 t 0 0 8 4 provides an upper bound to the entropy s t of the system during a cooling experiment and a lower bound for it during a heating experiment when the system is out of equilibrium the difference in the two bounds which we will denote by sb t 0 p 0 here strongly depends on the rates of cooling and heating the two bounds are exactly identical so that sb t 0 p 0 0 when the system is in equilibrium therefore sb t 0 p 0 can be used as a measure of the irreversibility when no internal variables order parameters are invoked as was recently done by johari and khouri 16 however introducing internal variables allows us to obtain the entropy without any error as we will discuss here even when the system is out of equilibrium and irreversibility is present so that the thermodynamic entropy can be always calculated at least in principle irreversible entropy generation appears through the internal order parameter in the calculation this is a well established approach to non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 11 see also 1 2 which we carefully discuss in sect iii for the sake of continuity c non equilibrium thermodynamic principles we have a through understanding of thermodynamic principles additivity reproducibil ity uniqueness and stability all defined later and the statistical entropy for an equilibrium system 3 7 the situation is not so obvious when the system is out of equilibrium we wish to examine the conditions necessary for the applicability of these principles to and ob tain the statistical formulation of the entropy of a non equilibrium system with the aim to develop a non equilibrium statistical thermodynamics while in traditional non equilibrium thermodynamics 1 2 9 11 the entropy of any body is postulated to exist under the as sumption of local equilibrium its actual value and its statistical connection with microstate probabilities is of no interest as only the difference in the entropy has any meaning the same is also true of the thermodynamics applied to glasses 14 17 20 the actual value of s is normally set by imposing additional requirement such as by invoking nernst postulate of the third law 4 21 22 our interest here is different we wish to identify the entropy of a body when it is out of equilibrium using statistical concepts it should be stated here that the entropy for a body in equilibrium is well understood in equilibrium statistical mechanics 3 6 thus any new attempt to define the entropy for a non equilibrium state must reduce the the well known form of equilibrium entropy 5 d component confinement entropy reduction and the residual entropy 1 component confinement and the gap phase space confinement at a phase transition such as a liquid gas transition is a well known phenomenon in equilibrium statistical mechanics 4 5 8 23 the component con finement also occurs when the system undergoes symmetry breaking such as during magnetic transitions crystallizations etc in such cases the confinement occurs under equuilibrium conditions and is well understood the confinement in phase space can also occur under non equilibrium conditions when the observational time scale obs becomes shorter than the equilibration time of the system such as for glasses 14 17 20 whose behavior and properties have been extensively studied see fig 2 which is adapted from fig 10 2 on p 442 in 14 the behavior of the entropies and their consequences for a given cooling rate r have been discussed by us in ch 10 in 14 and is based on the energy gap model for glasses discussed there the form of all these entropies is to ensure that they remain concave functions of the energy the basic premise of the model is the well known fact 4 that there exists a gap an energy gap between the energies of the perfect crystal and the glass at absolute zero which is at least as much as ek it is equal to ek for the ideal glass the gap is due to defects that are present in the glass with respect to the perfect crystal that raise the energy or the enthalpy of the former 14 24 the additional energy of a glass ene ek in a glass however is due to the presence of excitations relative to the ideal glass it should be observed that the slope of fg at g is infinite to ensure that the energy of the system described by fg is ene ek at absolute zero the investigation of the energy gap model in 14 is very relevant here as it is this non equilibrium component confinement during the glass transition that we wish to study in this work the entropy curve fg in fig 2 denotes the entropy of some arbitrary time dependent non equilibrium state includ ing glasses and is shown disconnected from the entropy curve ba 0 describing the entropy of the disordered state which includes the liquid and the supercooled liquid the latter is a stationary metastable state below the melting temperature tm with the crystal representing the stable state below tm the entropy of the ordered state which results in the crystal below tm is schematically shown by ba 0 it is a common practice to call the supercooled liquid as an equilibrium state when the interest is mainly to study non equilibrium states 6 e s g eee nek 0 f c a b d k sr fig 2 schematic form of the communal entropy dack of the disordered liquid supercooled liquid and the entropy ba 0 of the corresponding ordered crystalline state as a function of the energy other extensice observables are held foxed the common tangent to dack and ba 0 gives the inverse melting temperature tm the entropy of some non equilibrium disordered state for some non zero cooling rate r is given by fg which must strictly lie below in accordance with the second law it terminates at g at an energy ene which is strictly higher than the energy taken to be 0 here of the pure crystal at absolute zero or the energy ek at k on dack the entropy at g gives the residual entropy sr even though we have shown fg disconnected from dack for some arbitrary non equilibrium state it continuously emerges out of the latter at some point c at a temperature below tm in a glass transition the portion cg in this case represents the entropy of the glassy state as the cooling rate becomes slower cg moves towards ck until it finally merges with it as r 0 the terminal point k is known as the ideal glass transition where the entropy of the equilibrium supercooled liquid vanishes as fg moves towards ack ene moves towards the ideal glass energy ek and the residual entropy continues to decrease until the latter finally vanishes in the ideal glass transition at k however for any r 0 sr remains non zero due to the presence of excitations in the ideal glass that raises its energy above ek 7 denoted by fg the terminology is obviously incorrect if we need to bring the crystal into the discussion as our interest in this work is to mainly study time dependent non equilibrium states we will invariably call the supercooled liquid as the equilibrium liquid knowing well its limitation in a glass transition from the supercooled liquid the curve fg emerges out of back continuously at some point c which is determined by the experimental setup such as the cooling rate r as the system is not allowed to probe all the disjoint components in time it can be investigated by our recently developed non equilibrium approach in i and ii see for example eqs 3 8 one of the important observations of such systems is the existence of a residual entropy sr such as the entropy at the point g in fig 2 it is the entropy a glass or a crystal would have at absolute zero and is related to the possible number of disjoint components in the phase space 8 12 13 it is merely a measure of the number of lowest energy microstates of energy ene ek for a given mode of preparation at absolute zero the macrostate of the glass or the crystal is a collection of all these microstates along with their probability of occurrence for a given mode see 8 23 the mode of preparation determines the energies of these microstates which need not be the lowest possible energy such as ek for the supercooled liquid if we are concerned with a glass for the system 14 the lowest possible energy microstates represent the equilibrium macrostate at absolute zero it should be emphasized that there is no reason for the lowest energy macrostate to be non degenerate in principle although it seems to be true for a majority of the systems therefore we will assume in this work that seq k 0 for the supercooled liquid at k this is borne out of several exact calculations as discussed elsewhere 14 the system glass or crystal can be in any of lowest energy microstates and not the lowest possible enrgy microstates for a given mode of preparation and the residual entropy is determined by all these microstates 8 2 residual entropy the existence of a non zero residual entropy sr 0 is very common in nature and does not violate nernst s postulate as the latter is applicable only to equilibrium states with a non degenerate ground state 4 sect 64 its existence was first demonstrated by pauling and tolman 25 see also tolman 26 in addition the existence of the residual entropy 8 has been demonstrated rigorously for a very general spin model by chow and wu 27 for ice the residual entropy was observed by giauque and ashley 28 pauling 29 provided the first numerical estimate for the residual entropy for ice which was later improved by nagle 30 nagle s numerical estimate has been recently verified by simulation 31 32 the numerical simulation carried out by bowles and speedy 33 for glassy dimers also supports the existence of a residual entropy thus it appears that the support in favor of the residual entropy is quite strong we wish to emphasize that what is customarily called the third law due to nernst according to which the entropy must vanish at absolute zero is merely a postulate and not a strict theorem even in equilibrium 4 21 22 indeed many exactly solved statistical mechanical models show a non zero entropy at absolute zero based on these empirical observations the residual entropy sr at g in fig 2 has been taken as non zero and positive we refer to fig 2 to emphasize this point once more as r decreases g moves not only to the left but also down in the figure this has the consequence of lowering ene and sr so that entropy continues to decrease with temperature to ensure stability of the glass the additional energy or enthalpy due to excitation compared to the ideal glass raises the residual entropy of the glass relative to the ideal glass sr seq k 0 for ene ek 9 however it is possible that the residual entropy sr at g remains zero for all r as if all glasses are identical at absolute zero for any r indeed the situation shown in fig 2 has been challenged 34 38 because it is argued that the entropy cannot be estimated correctly in the glass transition region the region where component confinement occurs where irreversibility comes into play this is certainly true as can be easily seen form eqs 6 and 60 while the idea that the irreversibility raises some concern about the inferred values of the entropy is certainly justified the main point is not whether irreversibility is present see sect vif rather the question should be how much of an error does this create in the inferred values of the entropy thus the issue at hand is the magnitude of sb t 0 p 0 various estimates support an error that does not exceed more than 5 ja ckle 13 has also calculated the amount of uncertainty in the entropy for glycerol due to irreversibility near the glass transition and found it to be less than 5 gutzow and schmelzer 39 have shown by citing some earlier analysis that the irreversible contribution to 9 the entropy in the vicinity of the glass transition is small enough to be practically neglected they also provide a very enlightening historical review of the residual entropy in glasses nemilov 40 comes to a similar conclusion by suggesting that the error in sr is no more than 5 the conclusion is that there is no appreciable error in using conventional equilibrium thermodynamics by replacing the inequality to an equality in eqs 5 6 in studying glasses a point also made recently by goldstein 41 in particular one can get a highly reliable estimate of the entropy of a glass gl or the supercooled liquid scl without using any internal order parameter by the following standard integration process using the measured heat capacity s t 0 s 0 t 0 0 cpdt 0 t 0 sc 10 more recently johari and khouri 16 have come to a similar conclusion by reanalyzing experimental data 3 entropy reduction it has been suggested 34 38 that as a consequence of the component confinnment the system is no longer able to explore in time the entire part of the phase space that would be consistent with the observables such as the energy of the system with this interpretation in mind and recognizing the fact that the entropy is measured by the volume of the accessible phase space such as that belonging to a component it is then argued that the entropy s of the system must undergo a sudden or rapid reduction in its value due to component confinement 38 that is expected to occur at the glass transition but the experiments are unable to capture this because of the irreversibility we will call this entropy reduction scenario the unconventional view uv of the glass transition in this work in this scenario either fg in fig 2 remains disconnected from ba 0 to account for a sudden discontinuous reduction or touches ba 0 at some point c but falls off rapidly from c to give rise to a rapid but continuous drop in the latter scenario the portion of fg to the immediate left of c will have to change its curvature so that it will be no longer concave a point of critical importance that will be discussed at several occasions in this work it is impossible to continuously join two disjoint concave functions without creating a loss of concavity if it happens that the entropy s of the medium concurrently undergoes a sudden or rapid rise by an amount such that it not only compensates the reduction in s but add some more 10 so that s 0 does not decrease then the rapid reduction in s would not violate the second law for the isolated system as given in eq 2 however in this case also the irreversible entropy change in the system must still satisfy the second law dis t 0 therefore our third aim is to investigate if such a scenario can be supported by the second law our last goal is to use the second law to investigate the idea of the residual entropy from a statistical point of view and to prove that the situation in fig 2 with a non zero residual entropy is borne out of experiments this will be in contradiction with the idea of an entropy reduction in the unconventional view the enthalpy h and the volume v are known to be continuous during the glass transition 14 17 20 thus any entropy reduction will leave its imprint on the behavior of the gibbs free energy thus we will also investigate the behavior of the gibbs free energy in this work the other relevant issue which to the best of our knowledge has not been discussed in the literature so far for unexplained reasons is whether the experimental data support a non zero residual entropy even if the irreversibility may be quite appreciable as would happen in a rapid quench from above it is clear that the experimental determination of the residual entropy sexpt 0 invariably yields a non zero value we derive later a very simple consequence of the glassy irreversibility in the form of an inequality see eq 60 the inequality clearly supports a non zero residual entropy even if the irreversible contribution is appreciable see eq 62 it just happens that in most cases the irreversible contribution turns out to be minimal however the reality of the residual entropy is based not on the minimal irreversible contribution it is rather based on the inequality in eq 60 thus the entropy reduction due to confinement in the unconventional view cannot be attributed simply to the presence of irreversibility its root cuse if it exists has to be found elsewhere e goal and outline our aim in this work is to follow the recently developed non equilibrium thermodynamics 1 2 8 to specifically derive non equilibrium thermodynamic principles which should reduce to the well known thermodynamic principles for equilibrium bodies 4 5 26 we must ensure that these principles do not violate the second law in anyway we start by assuming the existence and continuity of s 0 and follow i and ii the existence assumption should not be surprising as the existence of s 0 is required to state the second law for an isolated 11 system 0 see eq 2 the equality in eq 2 occurs only when the isolated system is in equilibrium we will prove here that the existence and continuity of s 0 implies the existence and continuity of the gibbs free energy 1 2 g t 0 p 0 t e t t 0 s t p 0 v t 11 for the open system at fixed temperature t 0 and pressure p 0 of the medium even though it is not a common terminology we will use open to denote any body that is not isolated in this work the continuity of s 0 is easily traced to the continuity of microstate probabilities as discussed in sect iv the second law for the open system reduces to the well known inequality dg t dt 0 12 the equality occurs when the system achieves equilibrium with the medium this is exempli fied by the curve ack in fig 2 it is evident from fig 4 that glass free energies ggl cv t 0 and ggl uv t 0 approach gscl t 0 from above in conformity with eq 12 thus their behavior during relaxation is not sufficient to rule out either one as unphysical on the other hand the continuity of the gibbs free energy immediately rules out any discontinuous entropy reduction due to component confinement as discussed above but does not rule out a continuous entropy reduction the continuity of the gibbs free energy also establishes the continuity of the entropy of an open system in internal equilibrium by recognizing that the enthalpy of the system remains continuous at the glass transition the existence of internal equilibrium still allows irreversible relaxation in the system we find that as a consequence of the second law the entropy of the system in internal equilibrium decreases during relaxation thus validating eq 13 and invalidating eq 14 the latter requires the entropy to increase during relaxation as shown by the relaxation arrow for sgl uv in fig 3 thus the second law supports a continuous entropy s during component confinement on the other hand the gibbs free energies of the two glasses satisfy the second law in eq 12 in view of the incorrect behavior of sgl uv this is a very surprising result it appears that sgl uv t 0 and ggl uv t 0 do not have the same content we will find an explanation of this surprising statement later the statement about the continuity of the entropy of the system can be made stronger by removing the requirement of internal equilibrium by obtaining a statistical formulation for 12 it however we only need the above weaker continuity statement to rule out the unconven tional view of the entropy during the glass transition and to support fig 2 the statistical formulation of the entropy of an isolated system in terms of its microstates is given by eq 46 in compliance with the second law and which satisfies the above thermodynamic princi ples we then discuss how the entropy is defined for an open system under all conditions in terms of microstate probabilities this derivation also establishes the existence and continu ity of the entropy of an open system by recognizing that the entropy of the medium remains continuous during relaxation this again establishes that continuity of entropy when com ponent confinement occurs the continuity of the entropy of a body is a generic feature of a statistical system and is formulated as one of the thermodynamic principles therefore it should also not come as a surprise that the assumption of the existence of the entropy for non equilibrium states also forms the cornerstone of the conventional non equilibrium thermodynamics 9 11 we then proceed to explain the residual entropy in statistical terms and show that there is no reason for it to vanish we also show that irreversibility alone cannot justify any entropy reduction the layout of the paper is as follows we briefly discuss the two alternative views of the glass transition in sect ii which is then followed by a short review of some of the useful concepts and results derived earlier 1 2 8 in sect iii non equilibrium statistical entropy is introduced in sect iv and the concept of residual entropy is discussed we then list and discuss important thermodynamic principles that should be valid for a body in internal equilibrium in sect v sect vii is the important section where we discuss the consequences of the non equilibrium thermodynamics we discover in sect viid that the unconventional view is internally inconsistency the last section contains our conclusions ii two views of glasses a conventional glass view cv the small amount of irreversible contribution to the entropy of glasses does not mean that glasses are in equilibrium with the surrounding medium rather it implies that the fast degrees of freedom in glasses have equilibrated and the slow degrees of freedom although not yet equilibrated are changing so slowly as to be almost unchanged over the observation 13 time more details about this point can be found in i for most glasses the success of eq 10 rests on the premise that within 5 of the residual entropy as noted above dis 0 so that ds des as a consequence s 0 for a glass in eq 10 is correct within 5 its entire magnitude is only weakly affected by the irreversibility encountered during the glass transition this view will be called the conventional view cv of the glass transition gutzow and schmelzer 39 draw an analogy of dis 0 in slowly varying glasses with prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production 11 however we will not assume dis 0 so as to make our argument as general as possible later in this work we will derive an almost identical expression to eq 10 as an identity see eq 68 in the conventional view the entropy of the glass is schematically represented by the short dashed curve in fig 3 the upper solid curve represents the entropy of the supercooled liquid scl that would be eventually observed if we wait long enough for the system to equilibrate the point where sgl cv t 0 branches out of sscl t 0 is the glass transition temperature t 0 g and is determined by the choice of observation time obs as the entropy of the conventional glass lies above the supercooled liquid entropy sgl cv t 0 t sscl t 0 for t 0 t 0 g the entropy of the glass actually decreases in time dsgl cv t 0 t dt 0 13 the entropy of the conventional glass blue short dashed curve approaches sr 0 if we extrapolate to absolute zero for most glasses in this view the glass continuously emerges from the supercooled liquid at t 0 g both entropy functions are continuous with only gradual variation determined by their respective heat capacities b unconventional glass view uv despite the success of the conventional view that provides a justification of the residual entropy there have been several attempts to argue that the residual entropy is not a physical concept 34 38 it has been suggested that the entropy of a glass should approach 0 at absolute zero regardless of how it is prepared in other words the entropy of a glass has no memory of its mode of preparation at absolute zero notwithstanding the fact that 14 continuous loss of s sr supercooled liquid s t 0 t 0 g glass uv glass cv inflection point relaxation negative curvature fig 3 the entropy of the supercooled liquid sscl upper solid curve and of the cv glass sgl cv short dashed curve in the conventional view cv are shown schematically we are considering an isobaric cooling experiment the entropy sgl cv of the cv glass continuously emerges out of sscl at t 0 g and approaches the residual entropy at absolute zero not shown schematic form of the entropy sgl uv in the unconventional view uv is shown by a discontinuous entropy loss thin dashed vertical line of magnitude sr at t 0 g or a continuous entropy loss dashed curve of sr from sscl to the lower solid curve during the glass transition across t 0 g note the presence of an inflection point in the dashed piece of sgl uv the latter approaches 0 at absolute zero upon extrapolation not shown in the presence of an additional variable see text the entropy curves turn into surfaces defined over the t 0 plane most glasses do not represent equilibrium states the total loss of memory of the mode of preparation is the hallmark property of an equilibrium state while a non equilibrium state remains strongly correlated with its mode of preparation until it fully equilibrates which is reflected in its relaxation towards equilibrium despite this the above suggestion has been made repeatedly in the literature if it is true it will require either an abrupt or a gradual but rapid reduction in the entropy as the supercooled liquid scl turns into a glass gl at in the former case or around in the latter case t 0 g as we cool scl the amount by which the entropy must decrease during the glass transition by confinement to one of the possible exponentially large number of components should be comparable to sr this is 15 the unconventional view uv described above the abrupt entropy reduction during the glass transition is shown by the thin vertical dashed line of height sr at t 0 g to the lower solid entropy curve of the unconventional glass shown as glass uv in fig 3 the gradual entropy reduction is shown by the dashed red portion with an inflection point which falls very rapidly below the entropy of the supercooled liquid the total additional entropy reduction is equal to sr after the drop the dashed curve connects with the schematic lower solid glass uv which when extrapolated to absolute zero will now give a vanishing entropy thus resulting in no residual entropy we note that because of the entropy reduction sgl uv t 0 t sscl t 0 for t 0 t 0 g so that the entropy of the glass actually increases in time dsgl uv t 0 t dt 0 14 which is of opposite nature to that in eq 13 c gibbs free energy vconventional versus unconventional thus it appears that there are two competing views at present as far as the entropy of the glass is concerned with contradicting behavior of the entropy during relaxation as seen from eqs 13 14 however they both accept the same entropy function sscl t 0 of the supercooled liquid before it turn into a glass and is given by the solid blue curve indicated by supercooled liquid as the enthalpy h and the volume v of the glass are known to be continuous during the glass transition 17 20 both views agree on the same functions hgl t 0 and vgl t 0 for the glass the gibbs free energy g t 0 has been identified in i as g t 0 h t 0 t 0 s t 0 in terms of the entropy of the system conversely the entropy can be obtained from the gibbs free energy then the continuity of the entropy in the conventional view ensures that the gibbs free energy ggl cv t 0 hgl t 0 t 0 sgl cv t 0 of the glass is also continuous this is shown by the short dashed piece in fig 4 that emerges out of the lower solid curve gscl t 0 without any inflection point in the unconventional view the gibbs free energy abruptly jumps upwards by an amount close to tgsr for an abrupt reduction of entropy or rises rapidly along the dashed curve with an inflection point to meet continuously with the upper solid curve to give ggl uv t 0 hgl t 0 t 0 sgl uv t 0 16 glass uv supercooled

zero g 0 ggl cv 0 ggl uv 0 hgl 0 15 as shown in fig 4 otherwise ggl cv t 0 0 ggl uv t 0 0 for t 0 t 0 g the abrupt entropy reduction in the unconventional view has been recently criticized by goldstein 41 gutzow and schmelzer 39 nemilov 40 gujrati 8 23 42 and johari 43 we will not go into their arguments here for which the reader is advised to go to the original source however johari 43 provides a good summary of these approaches in addition kozliak and lambert 44 provide a new look at the issue of the residual entropy 17 these attempts are different from the approach we take here although we arrive at a similar conclusion these previous attempts neither consider a continuous entropy reduction nor do they visit the issue of how to define the entropy for non equilibrium states from first principles or how to interpret the residual entropy from a statistical point of view the issues that guide us here therefore the previous attempts do not reveal a pathological aspect of the continuous entropy reduction in that the behavior of the entropy sgl uv t 0 in fig 3 is not consistent with the entropy obtained from the gibbs free energy ggl uv t 0 in fig 4 this internal inconsistency poses a major problem for the unconventional view if the entropy can be defined for a non equilibrium body from first principles and if it satisfies the second law then we should be able to test whether component confinement results in an entropy reduction or whether the residual entropy is real for a non equilibrium body iii important concepts and useful results from i ii quantities pertaining to 0 are denoted by a subscript 0 for without any subscript and for by a tilda at the top the system although macroscopically large is considered to be a very small part compared to the medium so that the system can only create a very weak disturbance on the medium as said earlier a body refers to any of the three systems and 0 for the sake of convenience quantities pertaining to a body will be denoted without any subscript a state variables and internal equilibrium we first need to clarify the concept of the macroscopic state of a body as equilibrium and non equilibrium thermodynamics is an experimental science it must be based on observables which we take to be extensive and collectively denote byx t t being the time measured from some convenient reference point any thermodynamic state function must be a function of state variables z t consisting of observable x t and internal variable i t the observables are independent continuous variables that can be controlled and manipulated by an observer so that their values will allow the observer to differentiate between different macroscopic states macrostates of the same system of the observables the energy e volume v and 18 the number of particles n play an important role the observables are important as they remain fixed for an isolated system the internal variables see ii for details where they are denoted collectively by i t ik t cannot be controlled by the observer but play a very important role during relaxation in non equilibrium bodies such as glasses in addition the state function may also be an explicit function of time t it is useful to replace i t by the dimensionless vector t k t defined according to k t ik t ik ik 0 ik the variables k are usually known as internal order parameters or the degree of advance ment being a state function the entropy of a body whether in equilibrium or not is a con tinuous function of the state variables and will be expressed as s z t t or s x t t t when the body refers to the isolated system 0 we should remember that its observ ables are fixed so that x 0 has no t dependence the entropy of 0 must be expressed as s 0 x 0 i 0 t t or s 0 x 0 0 t t while it is relaxing towards its equilibrium state once it reaches equilibrium its entropy can only be described as a function of its observables so that it must be expressed as s 0 eq x 0 which is now a constant independent of t the explicit t dependence has disappeared at the same time 0 t is also no longer t dependent this means that in equilibrium 0 eq must become constant which from its definition above must vanish identically 0 eq 0 16 moreover as discussed in ii i 0 t is no longer an independent variable it becomes a function of the observable x 0 i 0 eq i 0 eq x 0 for an open system in equilibrium eq also must become constant in equilibrium similarly ieq is also no longer an independent variable it becomes a function of the observable xeq eq 0 ieq ieq xeq the case when the entropy of a body has no explicit t dependence so that the entropy appears as s x t t 17 19 is quite special as discussed in i and ii in this case the system is said to be in internal equilibrium accordingly s t 0 18 under internal equilibrium the entropy has the maximum possible value for given z t in this case the derivatives y t y t t t s z t x t a t a t t t s z t i t 19 of the entropy with respect to z t give the field y t and affinity a t characterizing the body see ii and below they are defined only when the body is in internal equilibrium or in equilibrium otherwise the derivatives do not have any physical significance it will prove useful to think at least in a formal sense that the internal variable can also be kept fixed consider the system in internal equilibrium at the instance when its state variables are xie x t iie i t and its field and affinity vectors are yie y t aie a t the medium is characterized by y 0 and a 0 0 and will be expressed as y 0 0 see ii we now disconnect this system from the medium and bring it in contact with another medium yie aie that is characterized by yie and aie the system is in equilibrium with this medium with the average values of its observables and internal variables given by xie and iie respectively being in equilibrium it must satisfy all the requirements of stability in particular the heat capacity of the system must be non negative cy ie aie 0 20 where y ie represents all fields except tie one can also formally consider this equilibrium system as an isolated system with fixed xie and iie by disconnecting it from the second medium this isolated system is still in equilibrium as its entropy is at its maximum for given xie and iie the heat capacity of such a system should also be non negative cx ie iie 0 21 20 wherex ie denotes all observables except energy e t if we connect this system to a medium which only controls eis and vis of the system by its fixed tie and pie respectively with the remaining observables x ie and iie kept fixed then the stability of such a system ensures that the following heat capacity is also non negative c pie x ie iie 0 22 b gibbs free energy of the system from now on we will considerably simplify our discussion by considering only e v and n as the only observables of a body and allow only one internal variable in describing it which we denote simply by moreover we will keep n fixed and allow the possibility of fluctuating e and v due to exchange with another body the medium accordingly we will not exhibit n in expressing any state function of the body thus x will refer to e v and z will refer to e v from now on we also assume that the medium is in internal equilibrium so that its entropy s z does not have an explicit t dependence so that eq 18 is satisfied although it is not in equilibrium with the system it follows from the internal equilibrium of that the associated fields are 1 t 0 s e z 0 p 0 t 0 s v z 0 23 here z 0 denotes e 0 v 0 and 0 of 0 the affinity a 0 0 for the medium the entropy s 0 t of 0 is a continuous function of time t at least twice differentiable with respect to its extensive variables and satisfies eq 2 as discussed in i and ii it can be written as the sum of the entropies s t of the system and s t of the medium s 0 e 0 v 0 0 t s e v t s e v 24 by invoking their quasi independence we will provide a direct proof of this sum later in sect iv when we identify the entropies as statistical quantities in terms of probabilities of microstates in terms of h t e t p 0 v t g t h t t 0 s t e t t 0 s t p 0 v t 25 which are the time dependent gibbs free energy and the enthalpy respectively of the system at fixed t 0 p 0 and a 0 0 we have s 0 t s 0 s t h t t 0 g t t 0 26 21 as shown in i where s 0 s e 0 v 0 0 is independent of the system theorem 1 the gibbs free energy g t 0 p 0 t of the system given in eq 11 is determined by the temperature and pressure of the medium and is equal to g t 0 p 0 t t 0 s 0 s 0 t 27 this is an important observation for the following two reasons firstly it shows that the gibbs free energy is defined even though we may not define the temperature and pressure of the system a situation that occurs when the system is not even in internal equilibrium of course we are assuming that the energy volume and entropy of the system are defined under all circumstances while there is less doubt that this is possible for the mechanical quantities such as energy and volume the concept of entropy valid under all conditions requires some care see i and sect iv later in engineering context the above gibbs free energy g t 0 p 0 t is also known as exergy or availability 45 secondly the above conclusion makes an important statement about the continuity of g t which we now explain we first recall that the entropy s 0 t is a continuous function now s 0 is the entropy of the medium in internal equilibrium but at e 0 v 0 0 as said above the properties of a body in internal equilibrium is similar to those of the same body in equilibrium when treated as an isolated system since the entropy of an isolated system is taken to be continuous s 0 must be continuous this ensures that the difference s 0 t s 0 is also continuous which then proves that g t 0 p 0 t is a continuous function since the system is an extremely small part of the isolated system we have s 0 0 z 0 s z 0 a 0 t 0 0 to a high degree of accuracy thus we have d dt s 0 e 0 v 0 0 t s e 0 v 0 0 s 0 t ds 0 dt 0 where we have used a 0 0 the constancy of e 0 v 0 and the second law the above equation is valid even it 0 is not constant and immediately proves eq 12 thus we come to another very important conclusion which we state as a theorem theorem 2 the gibbs free energy g t 0 p 0 t of the system is always a continuous function of time that continuously decreases in time in accordance with eq 12 22 the above result does not require any knowledge of the state of the system in par ticular the continuity of g t must remain valid even if the processes going on within the system are chemical reactions ergodicity loss chaos turbulence explosion etc or just normal quasi static slow processes going on in thus the continuity of g t is valid when the system is not in equilibrium with itself or with the medium as time goes on g t 0 p 0 t will continue to decrease towards the equilibrium value g t 0 p 0 e t 0 p 0 t 0 s t 0 p 0 p 0 v t 0 p 0 we now follow its consequences let us assume that the system is in equilibrium with the medium at some temperature t 1 and pressure p 1 of the latter the gibbs free energy of in equilibrium is g t 1 p 1 e t 1 p 1 t 1 s t 1 p 1 p 1 v t 1 p 1 obviously equilibrium quantities do not have any explicit t dependence at t 0 the system is brought in contact with a medium at the current temperature t 0 and pressure p 0 as the energy entropy and volume have not had any time to change the new gibbs free energy at t 0 will be g t 0 p 0 t 0 e t 1 p 1 t 0 s t 1 p 1 p 0 v t 1 p 1 this is true regardless of what changes may occur at t 0 it is clear that the two gibbs free energies are very different their difference is g t 0 s t 1 p 1 t v t 1 p 1 p 6 0 28 where q qcurrent qprior for any quantity q the difference g t 0 at t 0 however has no physical significance for the second law as the current isolated system with the medium at t 0 p 0 is different from the previous isolated system with the medium at t 1 p 1 while the second law refers to the behavior of a body in time under fixed macroscopic conditions we should also note that g t 0 0 as t and p vanish simultaneously for any system thus if the macroscopic conditions do no change the gibbs free energy undergoes no discontinuity at t 0 for t 0 however we are observing the same current isolated system for which eq 26 holds so that the gibbs free energy g of the system must vary continuously for t 0 regardless of the kinds of processes going on inside 0 23 it is interesting to note that for infinitesimal changes in the temperature and pressure eq 28 reduces to dg t 0 s t 1 p 1 dt v t 1 p 1 dp 29 a familiar expression from equilibrium thermodynamics if and when the internal equilibrium has been established in we can introduce as discussed in i its instantaneous fields and affinities such as the temperature t t t and pressure p p t 1 t t s e p t t t s v a t t t s 30 see eq 19 these are standard relations for the entropy for a body under internal equi librium and are used commonly in non equilibrium thermodynamics 1 2 8 11 to ensure that the inequality in eq 2 remains valid during relaxation i e during approach to equilibrium we must have see also 46 t t 6 t 0 p t 6 p 0 a t 6 a 0 0 31 they become identical only when equilibrium has been achieved thus as long as the relaxation is going on due to the absence of equilibrium the two inequalities must hold true see i thus we come to another important conclusions the use of the internal equilibrium is basically in the spirit of onsager s regression hy pothesis 47 non equilibrium relaxation is governed by the same laws as the relaxation of spontaneous fluctuations occurring in an equilibrium system we will assume that in an isobaric cooling experiment p t p 0 32 which we will refer to as the existence of the mechanical equilibrium for the system in this case we find that ds 0 t dt 1 t 1 t 0 dh dt 0 33 it can be shown on general grounds see i that in a cooling experiment under mechanical equilibrium dh dt 0 34 24 during relaxation in glasses this is also seen experimentally thus in such a cooling exper iment t t 0 35 the equality occurring only when equilibrium has been achieved furthermore in such cooling ds dt 1 t dh dt 36 during relaxation at fixed t 0 the relaxation that occurs in the glass originates from its ten dency to come to thermal equilibrium during which its temperature t t varies with time recall that we are considering a cooling experiment under mechanical equilibrium the re laxation process results in the lowering of the corresponding gibbs free energy which is a consequence of the second law in eq 2 and is valid even when there is no mechanical equi librium however under mechanical equilibrium the changes in the enthalpy and entropy are in the same direction see eq 36 this then gives rise to the following theorem 3 the lowering of g t with time in an isobaric experiment under mechanical equilibrium results in not only lowering the enthalpy in a cooling experiment as observed experimentally but also the entropy s t during relaxation ds dt 0 37 as shown in fig 3 for the conventional glass cv as it approaches towards the supercooled liquid during relaxation c gibbs fundamental relation it follows from eqs 30 and 18 that ds t 1 t t de t p t t t dv t a t t t d t 38 this relation is known as the gibbs fundamental relation the first law of thermodynamics is codified in the following differential de t t t ds t p t dv t a t d t 39 t 0 ds t p 0 dv t asd s avd v a t d t 40 25 where the two new and different internal order parameters or degrees of advancement s s t s s 0 s v v t v v 0 v are determined by the instantaneous entropy and volume governed by their corresponding affinities as t t t 0 s 0 s av p t p 0 v 0 v thus s v play the role similar to that of internal variables with as av playing the role of their respective affinity the differential of g t and h t see eq 25 turns out to be dg t s t dt 0 v t dp 0 asd s avd v a t d t 41 and dh t t 0 ds t v t dp 0 asd s avd v a t d t 42 for the isobaric case discussed above we have av 0 but as is normally non zero however in almost all applications of classical non equilibrium thermodynamics to glasses to date that we are familiar with even as is taken to be zero 19 20 as 0 43 this is equivalent to having t t t 0 44 which we will refer to here as the assumption of thermal equilibrium from eq 41 we see that g cannot vary in time if we have both thermal and mechanical equilibrium and if there are no internal order parameters thus there will be no relaxation unless we allow an order parameter theorem 4 under the assumption of thermal and mechanical equilibrium internal order parameters are required to describe relaxation observed in glasses except in sect vii we will not assume mechanical and thermal equilibrium so as to remain as general in our discussion as possible 26 iv non equilibrium entropy the results in the previous section are based on the thermodynamic concept of the entropy for a body not necessarily in equilibrium only the difference in the entropy has any meaning as the entropy itself has no unique value unless supplemented by nernst postulate 4 21 this should be contrasted with the statistical concept of the entropy originally due to gibbs 3 and based on first principles which provides a unique value of the entropy for a given macrostate everyone believes that the gibbs entropy is the correct thermodynamic equilibrium entropy 4 the situation with statistical interpretation of non equilibrium entropy appearing in eq 2 may not be so clear which we now analyze in this section the discussion in this section is very general and neither the medium nor the system is assumed to be in internal equilibrium a fundamental axiom of non equilibrium thermodynamics as thermodynamics is an experimental science it requires several measurements on the body to obtain reliable results to avoid any influence of the possible changes in the body brought about by measurements we instead prepare a large number n of samples or replicas under identical macroscopic conditions on which measurements are made the replicas are otherwise independent of each other in that they evolve independently in time this is consistent with the requirement that different measurements should not influence each other the samples are prepared so that the probability of a sample in microstate j is pj z t t which we simply write as pj t it is a continuous function of the state variable z t and of t for a macroscopically large body we now state the fundamental axiom of thermodynamics as proposed in 8 fundamental axiom the thermodynamic behavior of a system is not the behavior of a single sample but the average behavior of a large number of inde pendent samples prepared identically under the same macroscopic conditions at time t 0 such an approach is standard in equilibrium statistical mechanics 4 5 7 26 but it must also apply to systems not in equilibrium as it is required for the reliability of mea surements for non equilibrium systems this averaging must be carried out by ensuring 27 that all samples have been prepared with identical history this is obviously not an issue for systems in equilibrium we refer the reader to a great discussion about the status of statistical mechanics and its statistical nature in sect 25 by tolman 26 see also the last paragraph on p 106 in jaynes 48 this point has been recently reviewed in 8 23 the average over these samples of some thermodynamic quantity x then determines the thermodynamic average quantity x for the body x t w j 1 pj t xj 45 where xj is the value of x in the jth microstate of the body and w is the number of its distinct microstates b general formulation of entropy isolated system 1 gibbs formulation of non equilibrium entropy we begin by considering an isolated system 0 which need not be in equilibrium gibbs 3 tolman 26 and rice and gray 6 among others discuss at length the non equilibrium entropy using the gibbs formulation see also 8 23 it is given by the negative average of ln p what gibbs 3 calls the index of probability s 0 t ln p p t ln p t p t 1 46 where p t is the probability of the th microstate at time t it is shown below that it follows from eq 45 as the microstate probability p t is a continuous function of its arguments z 0 and t the entropy s 0 t s 0 z 0 t is also a continuous function of its arguments z 0 and t it is straightforward to establish 6 26 that this entropy satisfies eq 2 the identification of the entropy with the negative of the boltzmann h function 26 see p 561 the latter describing a non equilibrium state should leave no doubt in anyone s mind that the gibbs formulation of the entropy can be applied equally well to an equilibrium or a non equilibrium system in isolation 28 for a generic body we will write the continuous entropy as s t ln p j pj t ln pj t j pj t 1 47 where pj t is the probability of the jth microstate of the body at time t the justification for the entropy expression in eq 47 for an open system its continuity and its connection with the second law will be given below there are two different ways to understand the above entropy formulation 2 ensemble interpretation dynamics being irrelevant we now prove that the entropy is a statistical average given in eq 45 we consider a large number n cw 0 x 0 of independent replicas or samples of the isolated system with c some large constant integer let there be n samples in the microstate the probability of a sample in microstate is then p n n 48 the ensemble average of z 0 over these samples is given by z 0 1 n w 0 x 0 1 n z 0 w 0 x 0 1 p z 0 49 where z 0 is the value of z 0 in the microstate this is identical to the statistical average given in eq 45 the number of ways w to arrange the n samples into w 0 distinct microstates so that there are n samples in microstate is given by w n n taking its natural log to obtain an additive quantity s lnw 50 and using stirling s approximation for the factorials we see easily that s per sample can be written as s n w 0 x 0 1 p ln p 29 where p is given in eq 48 thus s n is the ensemble average of ln p thus it is nothing but the entropy s 0 of the body given in eq 46 again the continuity of s n follows directly from the continuity of p the maximum possible value of the entropy for fixed x 0 is s 0 max x 0 lnw 0 x 0 51 which occurs if and only if all microstates are equally probable p t 1 w 0 x 0 0 this maximum value is the boltzmann entropy of the system this certainly occurs as t for most systems then the system is said to be in equilibrium it is evident that the gibbs formulation in eq 46 is more general than the boltzmann formulation in eq 51 as the former contains the latter as a special limit in equilibrium n c for all so that p 1 w 0 3 temporal interpretation dynamics being relevant another way to interpret eq 46 is as follows which is quite standard at least in de veloping the kinetic theory of gases we consider the time evolution of an isolated system 8 23 starting at t 0 from some initial microstates 0 then p t at some later time t represents the frequency with which the th microstate has occurred during this time interval this is the temporal definition of the probability 4 the traditional way of intro ducing this probability all these microstates belong to the slice 0 of the microstate space consisting of fixed x 0 but different 0 t at t 0 p 0 0 where is the kronecker delta and s 0 0 0 with time this entropy will continue to increase until it reaches its maximum for fixed x 0 let w 0 x 0 denote the number of distinct microstates in the slice 0 for whatever reasons if it happens that the system is confined to or has visited during certain time interval such as the observation time obs only a part 0 0 of the above microstate space slice then p 0 0 52 even though these microstates corresponds to the same x 0 this happens because these microstates have not been visited yet let w 0 x 0 w 0 x 0 denote the number of 30 distinct microstates in 0 then the conventional entropy in eq 46 with the above condition in eq 52 would be strictly bounded s 0 x 0 0 p t ln p t lnw 0 x 0 the equality occurs if and only if all these microstates in 0 happen to be equally probable p 1 w 0 x 0 0 53 again we notice the generality of the gibbs formulation in eq 46 over the boltzmann formulation in eq 51 the ensemble approach is also very important from an experimental point of view at high temperatures where dynamics is very fast it is well known that it agrees with the temporal formulation however at low temperatures where dynamics becomes sluggish as in a glass the temporal entropy can be misleading however the ensemble entropy still gives the correct value this point has been discussed in 8 c general formulation of entropy open system let us now consider our system with at least one extensive observable that is fixed 22 which we take to be the number of particles n as usual the system is a small part of the isolated system 0 we wish to determine the entropy of in terms of its microstates which are indexed by i theses microstates correspond to all possible allowed energies and volumes we use to denote the microstates of with a fixed number of particles n a specification of the microstates i and gives a unique microstate specification hence the number of microstates w 0 of the 0 is the product ww where w and w are respectively the number of microstates of and because of the smallness of relative to 0 which results in the quasi independence of the system and the medium to a very high degree of accuracy we have in terms of their probabilities p t pi t p t as usual these probabilities are continuous functions of their arguments now using ln pi t p t ln pi t ln p t and the sum rule p t 1 i pi t 1 31 we find that s 0 t i pi t ln pi t p t ln p t where the two terms in the above equations represent the entropies of the system and the medium s t i pi t ln pi t s t p t ln p t 54 note that our entire discussion never puts any restriction on the kind of actual processes going on during approach to equilibrium hence whether there is any glass transition any loss of ergodicity loss etc has no bearing on the formulation of entropies in eq 54 or our other general results presented in the previous section let us imagine isolating the medium by disconnecting it from the system its entropy is given by s t s z t t the isolated medium is similar to the isolated system 0 whose entropy was assumed to be continuous see the discussion immediately after eq 2 thus s t must also be a continuous function the continuity of s 0 t and of s t then immediately leads to the continuity of the entropy s t of the system this result is also consistent with the continuity of microstate probabilities pi t the continuity of s t is independent of the kinds of processes that are going on within it this discussion then leads us to the following important theorem theorem 5 the entropy s z t t of an open system is a continuous function of its ar guments under all conditions in particular it is also continuous when the medium is in internal equilibrium the above derivation not only justifies eq 1 or eq 24 for an isolated system but also identifies the proper non equilibrium entropy for our open system which is always a continuous function of its extensive arguments and t the expression for s in terms of microstate probabilities in eq 54 is identical in form to what one would use for an equilibrium system 4 except that the microstate probabilities are now explicit functions of time t this entropy then determines the gibbs free energy and enthalpy in eq 25 of the system the second law in eq 2 for the isolated system 0 is now expressed in terms of the gibbs free energy for the system and is given in eq 12 provided that the medium is taken to be in internal equilibrium the fact that is in a medium is reflected in the fact that the g t and h t depend on t 0 p 0 of the medium and not on t t p t and a t 32 of the system recall that the system may have no well defined temperature pressure etc unless the system is in internal equilibrium this is important to emphasize as the validity of the second law cannot depend on the establishment of internal equilibrium in the system thus the entropy formulation in eq 54 is very general notice that the ensemble interpretation of the entropy in a body is due to the choice of samples with the probability pi the dynamics within the body never appears in the discussion thus such an interpretation is quite useful when the dynamics in a system becomes very sluggish such as in a glass v principles of non equilibrium thermodynamics based on the discussion above and the fundamental axiom we can formulate four fundamental principles of non equilibrium thermodynamics 23 these principles are well known and accepted in equilibrium thermodynamics we now discuss why they should also be applicable to slowly evolving metastable states such as glasses in which we are interested in this work we will assume that the system of interest is in internal equilibrium but not in equilibrium with the medium 1 the first one is the principle of additivity according to which the total entropy or other extensive quantities can be obtained by a sum over different macroscopic parts of the body each part must be large enough so that the usual argument that their surface effects can be neglected as thermodynamically unimportant is valid so that the parts become quasi independent 2 4 this principle is consistent with what one must do for any measurement which requires verification by performing the measurement many times over on different samples and per forming an average over these samples each measurement must be performed under iden tical macroscopic conditions we now argue that different quasi independent parts of the body represent different samples of the body prepared under identical conditions consider some body with n particles and imagine a much larger body that can be divided into a large number of parts k k 1 2 each part with n particles so that they are the same size as the body let us imagine itself to be a very small part of an isolated system 0 so that various k and do not affect the internal equilibrium of the much 33 larger medium in particular t 0 p 0 and a 0 0 of are unaffected by k and we can imagine each k to be in a medium k where the latter is composed of the medium and the remainder of the system obtained by taking out the part k under investigation because of the smallness of relative to the new medium also has the same t 0 p 0 and a 0 0 as the medium thus each part k experiences the same t 0 p 0 and a 0 0 as any other part all parts experience the same macroscopic conditions because of this different parts k are nothing but the preparation of the body many times over under identical conditions specified by the same t 0 p 0 and a 0 0 thus averaging any quantity over different samples is equivalent to averaging over different parts k of this principle of additivity must apply to any body even if it is not in equilibrium consequently the value of any extensive quantity over the entire body must be a sum over its various parts regardless of whether the body is in equilibrium or not 2 the second principle is the principle of reproducibility according to which the en semble average is equal to the average of the experimental values also called the thermodynamic average this principle follows from the fundamental axiom according to which thermodynam ics whether equilibrium or time dependent requires several measurements on the system to obtain reliable results to avoid any influence of the possible changes in the system brought about by measurements we can instead prepare a large number of samples under identical macroscopic conditions this is consistent with the requirement that different measurements should not influence each other then the principle follows immediately from eq 49 3 the third principle is the principle of continuity and uniqueness which states that the gibbs free energy is continuous and hence a unique single valued function of its arguments for equilibrium states this principle is certainly valid we extend it non equilibrium systems the principle follows from conclusion 2 as said there its validity is independent of the kinds of processes going on within the system in the absence of uniqueness different experimentalists will have no way to effectively communicate their results and no scientific investigation can be carried out this is a very important requirement if the second law for an open system in the form of eq 12 has to make any sense the existence of the 34 gibbs free energy as demonstrated in sect iii b does not require the system be at least in internal equilibrium it only requires the medium to be in internal equilibrium therefore it is most certainly also valid when the system is in internal equilibrium 4 the last principle is the principle of stability according to which the heat capacity compressibility etc must remain non negative for the system to remain stable we have already discussed the non negativity of the heat capacity in eqs 20 22 similar conditions also apply to compressibility and other response functions vi entropy as a macrostate property and component con finement can there anything be wrong with the original argument that suggests entropy reduction due to confinement as noted in sect i after all if the system is confined to just one component should not the confinement entropy be zero what can be wrong with such a simple argument to answer this question we need to understand the concept of the statistical entropy to which we now turn more details can be found in a recent review 8 a non interacting ising spins ensemble and temporal descriptions let us consider an ensemble of n non interacting ising spins located at the sites of a lattice with n sites all possible w 2 n microstates have the same energy e 0 and each microstate ij has the same a priori probability pj 1 w the spin macrostate i on the other hand is only specified by the number of up and down spins and not the sequence of spin states on the lattice one can relate this problem to picking n balls with replacement from an urn containing equal number of balls of two colors after picking a ball we must place it back in the urn the sequence of the colors of the n balls in time with replacement determines a microstate bj of the n balls a ball macrostate b is determined by specifying only the number of balls of each color but not the actual sequence of colors we can identify the state of the kth spin in ij with the color of the ball picked at the kth attempt in bj then the two problems are identical except that we are considering an ensemble of the ising spins whereas we are considering a temporal description for the balls indeed in the latter 35 case we have a temporal evolution of the state of a single ball in time now there is no dynamics that allows a ball microstate bj to change into another ball microstate b j there may be some dynamics that could change a spin microstate ij to another microstate i j whether there is any microscopic dynamics specified or not is irrelevant in determining the entropy for the spins the entropy for both systems spins and balls is s n ln 2 it is also the maximum entropy indicating that we are dealing with an equilibrium state this entropy will be the same even if there were no dynamics changing the spins such as at absolute zero in classical mechanics when a system is confined to one of disjoint components of the phase space from which it cannot escape we also encounter a situation with the absence of a dynamics the dynamics which takes the system from one component to another 8 12 23 accordingly every realization of the balls or spins will remain in its microstate forever just like a glassy system which remains confined to a disjoint component 8 12 19 20 23 due to kinetic freezing however as the fundamental axiom states the entropy is an average quantity obtained by an average over all samples or microstates as shown in eq 47 this is equivalent to saying that the entropy is determined by the macrostate which represents a collection of microstates each with certain a priori probability the entropy has a contribution from all of these microstates it is not the property of a single microstate this point should be very clear form the derivation of relating s n in eq 50 with the entropy the evaluation of s is due to the choice of various samples the dynamics is not part of the derivation as a consequence the entropy is unaffected by whether microstates have any dynamics for change or not in time one only needs to know the probability distribution for the microstates for a kinetically frozen glass different samples will correspond to a glass confined to any one of the components 8 12 23 we have no information as to which component a sample is frozen into thus the entropy must be obtained by averaging over these different samples or disjoint components we cannot just consider one particular sample since the entropy is not the property of a single component 36 b probability collapse and entropy reduction is it possible to justify that the entropy is determined by considering just one of the components in which the system is confined if such a determination is possible it must be because the entropy discontinuously decreases when the component confinement occurs the reduction in entropy is most certainly possible if we perform a measurement to iden tify the microstate in which a given sample is to identify a particular microstate requires complete information about the body which is ordinarily unfeasible in order to identify any particular microstate we need to perform a very special kind of measurement which we will call a microstate measurement 8 that provides us with the complete information about the body in its current microstate j 0 for the ising model this requires determining the orientations of each of the n spins after the microstate measurement we know with certainty which microstate the system is in before the measurement a given sample is known to be in one of the microstates the probability p 0 that the sample is in microstate j 0 is p 0 1 w this probability changes discontinuously from p 0 1 w to p 0 1 imme diately after the measurement the effect of the microstate measurement is to also reduce the probabilities of all other microstates j 6 j 0 to pj 0 for this sample thus pj j j 0 immediately after the measurement we will speak of probability collapse to indicate this change in the probability brought about by the microstate measurement in this work the entropy also vanishes in an abrupt fashion immediately after the measurement from the initial value of lnw in accordance with complete certainty about the body while quite an appealing argument for the justification it overlooks two important facts 1 in experimental glass transition no such measurement is ever made that identifies precisely which component the glass is frozen in such a measurement will tell us precisely the positions and momenta of all the n particles which then allows us to decipher which particular component the glass is in 2 because of the lack of such a measurement we must determine the entropy by averag ing over all components as shown in eq 55 by considering all possible samples with the probability distribution p for the components 37 c system confined in a component the residual entropy 8 in real glass formation no probability collapse occurs as no microstate measurement is ever performed to identify the particular component the sample is in the sample still has the same probability to be in any of the c components it had before the confinement occurs the confinement does not alter the probability distribution all we know for sure is that a glass sample is in any one of the c components we do not know the actual component it is in this situation is identical to the die which is known to be in one of the six possibilities when it is concealed by the cup or to the non interacting ising spins discussed earlier as long as the die is concealed the probability of an outcome of an unloaded die remains 1 6 regardless of what is on the top face even if the outcome cannot change when we lift the cup the outcome is most certainly not certain when concealed by the cup see 8 for more details on this point the information that the glass has been formed is most certainly not equivalent to knowing precisely the particular component in which the glass is trapped the latter will require the collapse of the original probability distribution by a microstate measurement the entropy is obtained by taking the average over all the samples and not only one glass sample in accordance with the fundamental axiom let us now follow this line of reasoning the entropy s t can be written as a sum over all the components indexed by 1 2 c s t c 1 j pj ln pj c 1 j pj 1 where j represents one of the microstates in the component the first sum is over all the components and the second sum is over all microstates in each component the above way of writing is an identity and applies under all cases thus it applies whether confinement occurs or not introducing p j pj c 1 p 1 we can rewrite s t as follows s t c 1 p s t sc t 55 where s t j pj p ln pj p 38 denotes the component entropy in a given component and sc t c 1 p ln p denotes the confinement entropy due to various components for an unbiased sampling of the components sc t must be at its maximum which requires p 1 c 56 for the case of the die sc ln 6 and s t 0 to give s ln 6 as noted earlier in real glasses the entropy s t vanishes as the glass approaches absolute zero in this case the entropy at absolute zero reduces to sc t which is what is customarily called the residual entropy sr 19 20 we thus define the residual entropy as sr c 1 p ln p 57 when the system explores various components without any bias so that eq 56 holds the residual entropy reduces to sr ln c 58 d residual entropy of subsystems and calorimetric measurements another way to understand eq 57 is to recall the additive of the entropy we imagine dividing the system into several macroscopically large but equal parts of size n these parts representing many samples of a smaller system each part now represents a glass trapped in a component of the smaller system let c denote the number of disjoint components for then the number of disjoint components c for is given by c c n n where n n denotes the number of parts in again we cannot be sure of which component each part is trapped in the components appear with probabilities p for any part so that s r c 1 p ln p 39 for each part the probability of is obtained by adding this entropy over all parts so that sr n n s r if the components appear with no bias then sr n n ln c 59 which coincides with the result in eq 58 for the additivity principle clearly shows that the residual entropy for is not zero it is evident now that to conclude that the residual entropy has vanished just because a sample has frozen into a single basin or glass form is incorrect the entropy reduction for only happens if a microstate measurement is performed to identify the particular component the glass is in this discussion also shows that calorimetric measurements explore different glass components associated with the subsystems so that they reveal a non zero residual entropy e spontaneous symmetry breaking versus glass confinement it is relevant at this point to contrast the above component confinement in glasses with the idea of confinement that occurs in spontaneous symmetry breaking such as a ferromagnet in the latter case there exists a symmetry breaking field whose presence picks out one of the components for example 0 for the system this is equivalent to our notion of the microstate measurement except that in this case it is really a component measurement resulting in picking the component 0 the application of the symmetry breaking field forces the system to be in a particular component 0 in this process the entropy of the system will be reduced by sc note that we have suppressed the time dependence as one usually considers equilibrium situations in symmetry breaking due to the probability collapse discussed above on p 37 and all thermodynamic averages are determined by the particular component 0 it usually happens that the value of sc in spontaneous symmetry breaking is not an extensive quantity so the effects of the confinement on the entropy become irrelevant for a macroscopic system there is no entropy reduction per unit volume in the process of confinement however the effects of the confinement on some thermodynamic quantities such as the order parameter associated with the symmetry breaking become very important 40 for glasses the residual entropy sc t is found to be an extensive quantity therefore it is very important to know if there could be some entropy reduction due to confinement in glasses to this date no one has identified any physical symmetry breaking field analog for glasses thus there does not seem to be a way to prepare a glass in a particular component when a glass is prepared we have no way of knowing which component it is trapped in hence one must consider all the components in obtaining any thermodynamic average such as the entropy as we have done above in particular there is no entropy reduction per unit volume in a glass transition we have discussed the unsuitability of time average instead of the ensemble average elsewhere 8 and we refer the reader to this for more details we will only make the following brief comment here it happens that at low temperatures the approach to equilibrium takes more time than feasible due to experimental constrained most measurements last a short period of time the temporal average over an extended time period has nothing to do with information obtained in measurements that may take a fraction of a second or so unless the system is already in equilibrium at the time of the measurement different measurements carried out on the system at different instances will give different results the system has a memory effect when the system is not in equilibrium thus temporal average is not desirable for glasses in contrast the ensemble average provides an instantaneous average and thus bypasses the above objection of the finite measurement time f role of irreversibility on the residual entropy there is another way to understand the inequalities in eq 6 in a vitrification experi ment from a state a at temperature t 0 in the supercooled liquid state which is still higher than the glass transition temperature to the state a 0 at absolute zero we have along the path a a 0 s 0 s t 0 a 0 a des a 0 a dis 60 where we have set sc 0 as there is no latent heat in the vitrification process and where ds des dis 1 2 9 11 with dis 0 representing the irreversible entropy generation and des cpdt 0 t 0 see eq 3 since the second integral in the above equation is always 41 non negative we obtain s 0 sexpt 0 s t 0 0 t 0 cpdt 0 t 0 61 in accordance with eq 6 as expected the forward inequality is due to the irreversible entropy generation thus the entropy at absolute zero must be larger than or equal to the right hand side sexpt 0 which can be determined by performing a cooling experiment we take t 0 to be the melting temperature tm and uniquely determine the entropy of the supercooled liquid at t 0 m by adding the entropy of melting to the crystal entropy scr t 0 m at t 0 m the latter is obtained in a unique manner by integration along a reversible path from t 0 0 to t 0 t 0 m scr tm scr 0 tm 0 cp crdt 0 t 0 here scr 0 is the entropy of the crystal at absolute zero which is traditionally taken to be zero and cp cr t 0 is the heat capacity of the crystal this then uniquely determines the entropy of the liquid to be used in the right hand side in eq 61 if experiments show that sexpt 0 greater than zero or greater than scr 0 if the latter is not taken to be zero in accordance with nernst postulate then the entropy s 0 at absolute zero on the left side itself must be greater than zero or greater than scr 0 we will assume that scr 0 0 thus the experimental determination of the right hand side of eq 61 is sufficient to unequivocally determine whether s 0 sexpt 0 the inequality in eq 61 takes into account any irreversibility during vitrification as is well known sexpt 0 is found to be non negative as discussed in sect ia thus there cannot be any doubt that sr s 0 sexpt 0 62 experiments invariably give a non zero value of sexpt 0 which then proves immediately that in thses cases the residual entropy cannot vanish vii non equilibrium entropy and gibbs free energy a consequences of the second law the important conclusions from the previous discussion can now be summarized as fol lows the conclusions are derived under the assumption that the entropy s 0 of the isolated system is a continuous function of e 0 v 0 n 0 0 t and t 42 a medium under internal equilibrium 1 the gibbs free energy g of the system is continuous function of its arguments and decreases continuously during relaxation toward its equilibrium value 2 the entropy s of the system is continuous function of e t v t t and t which follows from theorem 5 b medium and system under internal equilibrium 1 the entropy s of the system is continuous function of e t v t and t this is a weaker form of the continuity condition and follows from the continuity of the gibbs free energy in theorem 2 to see that we write s h g t 0 63 and use the experimentally observed continuity of h during the glass transition 2 the entropy continuously decreases during relaxation toward its equilibrium value according to eq 37 it follows from either a 2 or b 1 that the entropy cannot undergo any discontinuity at a glass transition since the continuity of g follows from the second law any discontinuous entropy reduction will result in the violation of the second law a point already made by goldstein 41 it follows from b 2 that the behavior of entropy during relaxation only supports eq 13 and not eq 14 in other words only the conventional view of the entropy during component confinement can be substantiated by the second law however this does not prove that the gibbs free energy ggl uv t 0 is incorrect as its variation in time conforms to the expected variation in eq 12 the gibbs free energy ggl cv t 0 also conforms to the expected variation in eq 12 does it mean that ggl uv t 0 is just as acceptable as ggl cv t 0 from the point of view of the second law and non equilibrium thermodynamics even if sgl uv t 0 is not or is it possible that both gibbs free energies are unacceptable then what should be the correct form of the gibbs free energy for a glass is it possible that ggl uv t 0 is acceptable even though sgl uv t 0 is found to violate the second law will this lead to some thermodynamic inconsistent in some way is it possible that only ggl cv t 0 is acceptable we turn to this issue now 43 b non equilibrium entropy evaluation the gibbs free energy ggl cv t 0 is shown by the short dashed blue curve which grad ually connects without any inflection point to gscl t 0 while ggl uv t 0 is shown by the solid red curve and by its discontinuous or rapid fall to gscl t 0 in fig 4 the latter pos sesses an inflection point a in the dashed red portion we rule out the discontinuous jump in ggl uv t 0 as physically unacceptable because of a 1 thus we only consider ggl uv t 0 with a continuous fall to gscl t 0 all known analyses of experimental data have been carried out under the assumption of mechanical and thermal equilibrium therefore we will also make this common assumption in this section according to which as av 0 64 accordingly we will assume that the instantaneous temperature and pressure t t p t of the system are no different from the constant temperature and pressure t 0 p 0 of the medium as there is no longer any need to distinguish the two we will use the common notation t p for both with the implicit assumption that they have no longer any t dependence in our discussion below we do not specifically endorse the statistical formulation of the entropy in eq 54 we simply use the thermodynamic notion of the entropy the resulting differential of the gibbs free energy is now given by 19 20 dg sdt v dp a d 65 the irreversible entropy generation is captured by the presence of in the above equation this form of dg is exactly what is postulated in the traditional non equilibrium thermo dynamics 9 11 where the existence of non equilibrium entropy is postulated how it is actually calculated is irrelevant for the general argument below this point should not be forgotten in the following discussion as the general conclusions should be confirmed by any formulation of the entropy the entropy is given by s g t p 66 which generalizes the conventional definition of the entropy for an equilibrium system to a non equilibrium system the above relation shows that we should be able to extract the 44 entropy s from the knowledge of the gibbs free energy g now it is easy to show 19 that the heat capacity is given by cp t t s t p t 2 g t 2 p 0 67 this is in accordance with eq 22 we can now integrate eq 67 to obtain the entropy in terms of the heat capacity cp s t s 0 t 0 cp t dt t sc 68 where s 0 is the residual entropy at absolute zero and where dqp cp t dt represents the amount of heat at constant p the eq 68 should be compared with eq 10 which is usually criticized as unreliable due to the glass transition in contrast eq 68 is an identity in our non equilibrium thermodynamics 1 under the assumption in eq 64 any irreversibility in the system is now captured by the time dependence of however the actual form of the variation is not relevant for our discussion in this work the integration in this identity must be carried out along constant this heat capacity cannot vanish at any positive temperature it can vanish at absolute zero without creating any conceptual problem we have discussed these issues elsewhere 21 22 any state with a negative heat capacity will be identified here as unphysical c consequences of for glasses let us try to understand the consequence of the additional variable in the presence of all the the curves including the broken red curve in figs 3 and 4 turn into surfaces defined over the t plane in particular the inflection point a that is present in the dashed piece in this figure turns into a line a of inflection points thus if we consider a slice of these surfaces at a constant c then this slice will give three curves similar to those shown in figs 3 and 4 with sgl uv t 0 and ggl uv t 0 still containing inflection points in particular we will find a region curving down at higher temperatures and a region curving up at lower temperatures in fig 3 just as we see in the figure for sgl uv t 0 nevertheless 45 the form of the entropy sgl cv t 0 or sgl uv t 0 for fixed c is monotonic as shown in fig 3 so that s t p cp t t 0 69 for both of them since we are allowed to take any value c in the above discussion there is no harm in showing the fixed value as a general in the above equation the above inequality corresponds to cp 0 in accordance with eq 67 again we show and not c for the reasons alluded to above in an isobaric experiment at fixed p the curves shown in fig 3 need not correspond to a fixed in the glass transition region in general we expect to vary with the temperature pressure and the history of cooling but the point to stress is that the presence of the inflection point a in fig 3 has no effect on the sign of the slope s t p it remains non negative for both entropies sgl cv t 0 or sgl uv t 0 d forms of gibbs free energies the enthalpy hgl t is the same in both views hgl cv t hgl uv t hgl t because of the continuity of the enthalpy during the glass transition the gibbs free energy ggl t hgl t tsgl t thus has the same value hgl 0 in cv and uv at absolute zero ggl 0 ggl cv 0 ggl uv 0 hgl 0 regardless of the value sgl cv 0 and sgl uv 0 take at absolute zero we obviously do not consider the unphysical case of an infinitely large s t for a finite but macroscopically large system depending on whether we follow cv or uv this is the same as eq 15 the scl gibbs free energy gslc t above tg t 0 g is the same in both views if it is possible for the supercooled liquid curve to be extrapolated to absolute zero as shown by the solid blue curve in fig 4 then gscl t would have the value gscl 0 hscl 0 hgl 0 there observe that gslc t ggl cv t ggl uv t 46 for t tg the value gscl 0 should be strictly lower than ggl 0 as ggl cv t or ggl uv t is expected to reach gscl t from above during relaxation the curve gslc t presumably approaches absolute zero with a slope equal to zero sscl 0 0 the entire supercooled liquid curve gslc t is concave as shown because it represents a stable state e constant internal order parameter let us first consider the additional variable to be constant for the sake of simplicity of the discussion therefore we will suppress in this section at absolute zero the gibbs free energy in either view takes the same value ggl 0 as noted above see the solid red curve and the dashed blue curve in fig 4 thus there are two possible gibbs free energy curves below the glass transition at tg ggl uv t or ggl cv t since the entropy s is given by eq 66 it is evident that the magnitude of the slope of ggl uv t will be smaller 0 than that of ggl cv t near absolute zero because of the entropy reduction as shown schematically with no entropy reduction ggl cv t will have a large negative slope equal to sr at absolute zero hence it will drop faster than the upper red curve so that ggl cv t will be given by the short dashed blue curve in fig 4 this curve will eventually connect to the lower solid blue curve gslc t indicated by supercooled liquid the combined curve short dashed blue curve ggl cv t below tg and solid blue curve gslc t above tg remain concave at all temperatures as shown schematically in the figure as there is no inflection point the gibbs free energy ggl uv t must also be continuously connected with gslc t along the long dashed red curve as shown in fig 4 now the connection give rise to an inflection point a according to eq 67 the gibbs free energy must be a concave function of the tempera ture so that the heat capacity remains non negative as the solid red curve the short dashed and solid blue curves in fig 4 are remember that we are talking about the total heat capacity of the system it is clear that being concave ggl cv t gives a non negative heat capacity on the other hand this is not true of ggl uv t which contains an inflection point at a near tg it is clear that any attempt to smoothly connect the solid red piece ggl uv t with gslc t must result in an inflection so that it cannot remain concave everywhere it must have a convex piece giving a negative heat capacity at higher temperatures as shown by the arrow let us emphasize that to connect the two solid curves by a straight piece 47 to avoid the convex piece is contrary to physics this will result in a discontinuity in the entropy and hence a latent heat where the connection is made this is contrary to all experimental evidence in addition over this intermediate temperature range the heat ca pacity will turn out to be zero which is also contrary to all experimental evidence thus the dashed piece must not be straight for a physically realizable glass f variable internal order parameter let us now understand the significance of eq 67 when a variable internal order pa rameter is present in this case these free energy curves will turn into surfaces defined over the t 0 plane in particular the inflection point a in this figure turns into a line of inflection point as is also the case with fig 3 let us consider a slice of these surfaces obtained by fixing 0 as this slice will also cut the line of inflection points the slice will have the middle piece in which the curvature will change sign on either side of this inflection point thus this slice will appear similar to the curves in fig 4 with the middle dashed red curve containing an inflection point at t ta at temperatures lower than ta the gibbs free energy is concave so that eq 67 is satisfied however at temperatures higher than ta the gibbs free energy becomes convex so that eq 67 is not satisfied this region then results in a region of negative heat capacity and this makes the system unphysical over this region above t 0 a indeed all experimental evidence collected so far for glasses have never ever exhibited a negative heat capacity the presence of a point of inflexion at ta where the heat capacity will vanish raises another issue it is obvious that ta is a positive temperature this gives rise to another unphysical aspect of uv in that the glass at this temperature can be brought in thermal equilibrium with any medium at any temperature no heat exchange is possible dqp cp dt 0 as the system has vanishing heat capacity this means that at a where the heat capacity is zero the temperature has no physical significance for a glass see the discussion above in addition to these problem the negative heat capacity is in contradiction with 69 the negative curvature of the gibbs free energy ggl uv t implies that the entropy must be a decreasing function of the temperature in direct contradiction with the behavior of the entropy sgl uv t in fig 3 the entropy derived from ggl uv t is different from the 48 entropy sgl uv t in fig 3 thus there is an internal inconsistency a thermodynamic inconsistency within the unconventional view the lack of thermodynamic consistency and the violation of eq 67 rules out the unconventional view as physically relevant only the conventional view can be supported by the second law viii conclusions the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics in eq 2 presupposes the exis tence and continuity of the entropy s 0 of an isolated system under all possible conditions and not only when the system is in equilibrium this point is however not always appre ciated a microstate is identified by specifying some extensive mechanical quantities of the system such as energy volume etc that we have identified here as state variables denoted collectively by z t these variables and therefore the microstates and their probabilities pi t exists even if the fields like the temperature pressure etc may not exist for the sys tem as the entropy is a state function the entropy s 0 as identified in eq 46 exists for an isolated body under all conditions and we have assumed it to be a continuous function of z 0 ant t this assumption must be made for eq 2 to have any content we start from this and show that this results in the continuity of the gibbs free energy in eq 25 for an open system see theorem 2 the gibbs free energy exists under all possible conditions of the system in terms of the gibbs free energy the second law for an open body is given by eq 12 if we now assume the open system to be in internal equilibrium we can identify its fields and affinities by eq 19 for a body under internal equilibrium certain results have been obtained in sect iii the most important being eq 34 and eq 37 under cooling when we have mechanical equilibrium p p 0 the last observation is later used to rule out any theory of vitrification via cooling that predicts an increase of entropy during relaxation the statistical concept of entropy is introduced in sect iv given by gibbs 3 for an isolated system under all conditions it follows form the fundamental axiom in this section 8 under the assumption of quasi independence the entropy of an open system follows from this statistical formulation and is given in eq 54 the principles of non equilibrium thermodynamics are enunciated in sect v which follow from the fundamental axiom these principles reduce to accepted principles 49 of equilibrium thermodynamics using these principles we explain how the entropy of a system should remain continuous during component confinement at a glass transition we then prove the continuity of s under two distinct situations see a 2 and b 1 this continuity of s is one of the most important results of this work and is derived under the most possible general condition see theorem 5 the statistical entropy merely explains how this happens the next most important result is captured by theorem 3 according to which only eq 13 can be justified by the second law eq 14 cannot be justified the discussion also explains the concept of the residual entropy the residual entropy is estimated by the experimentally obtained value sexpt 0 of the entropy see eq 61 by applying equilibrium thermodynamics to the glasse a standard practice in the field the experimental estimate sexpt 0 is normally a non negative value we give a direct proof that the residual entropy must be bounded from below by this experimental value see eq 62 thus making the residual entropy at least as big as the experimental estimate any irreversibility will only raise the value of the residual entropy even higher than the experimental estimate it is impossible for the residual entropy to be zero if the experimenatl estimate sexpt 0 is non zero this conclusion justifies a non zero sr at g in fig 2 using general arguments of stability and well established non equilibrium thermodynam ics we have also shown that ggl uv t is internally inconsistent in sect viid this conclusion is not based on any particular formulation of the entropy it only uses the ther modynamic concept of entropy our conclusion then adds another argument in support of the reality of the residual entropy any entropy reduction scenario during component confinement violates the second law and results in an internal inconsistency we wish to thank marty goldstein for suggesting to consider the issue of the residual entropy using a statistical mechanical approach and him and s v nemilov for useful corre spondence 1 p d gujrati phys rev e 81 051130 2010 p d gujrati arxiv 0910 0026 2 p d gujrati arxiv 1101 0438 3 j
