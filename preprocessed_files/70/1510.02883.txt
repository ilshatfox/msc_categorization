motion among random obstacles on a hyperbolic space enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti abstract we consider the motion of a particle along the geodesic lines of the poincare half plane the particle is specularly reflected when it hits randomly distributed obstacles that are assumed to be motionless this is the hyper bolic version of the well known lorentz process studied by gallavotti in the euclidean context we analyse the limit in which the density of the obstacles increases to infinity and the size of each obstacle vanishes under a suitable scaling we prove that our

local approxi mation of the geometry underlying the universe non euclidean manifolds has been a topic of growing interest among both mathematicians and physicists over the last few decades much attention has been paid to the random motions that occur in non euclidean spaces in particular random motions on hyperbolic spaces are often reported in the literature most of the papers focus on hyperbolic brownian motion but random motions at finite velocity have also been investigated recently see 5 6 7 12 date august 1 2018 2000 mathematics subject classification to be defined key words

costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti we believe that the lorentz process studied in detail by gallavotti 9 is a paradigmatic model for finite velocity random motions and therefore we have fo cused our attention on this topic the lorentz process studied by gallavotti is the motion performed by a particle in the euclidean plane r 2 where static spherical obstacles are distributed accord ing to a poisson probability measure with intensity the particle is assumed to move along straight lines and to be specularly reflected by the obstacles the pro cess is clearly non markovian because the trajectories recall the effect of previous collisions the main result of gallavotti s study is the proof of consistency of the so called boltzmann grad limit in which the radius r of each obstacle decreases to zero and the density increases to infinity so that the mean free path 2 r 1 remains constant few collisions regime under the boltzmann grad asymptotics the single time probability density of the lorentz process converges to that of a markovian process solving a linear boltzmann equation gallavotti s model was firstly improved by spohn 15 and boldrighini et al 3 and was further developed in subsequent papers in 8 desvillettes and ricci studied a variant of the model in which the obstacles are totally absorbing and an external force field is present in this case the boltzmann grad limit does not lead to a markovian process unless a random motion of the obstacles is assumed with gaussian distribution of velocities gallavotti s work has also inspired the approach of basile et al 2 for which there is a slightly different context espe cially because the obstacles are circular potential barriers instead of being hard spheres however the authors followed in gallavotti s footsteps and by suitably scaling the poissonian density and the potential intensity they obtained a mar kovian approximation that is governed by a linear landau equation the limiting process is halfway between the boltzmannn grad regime few collisions and the weak coupling regime many collisions in this paper we construct the lorentz process in the poincare half plane which is one of the most popular euclidean models of hyperbolic spaces for the reader s convenience we will report some of the basic facts on the poincare half plane it can be defined as the region h 2 x y r 2 y 0 endowed with the metric ds 2 dx 2 dy 2 y 2 1 1 from 1 1 it follows that geodesic curves in h 2 are either euclidean half circumferences with their centers on the x axis or euclidean lines parallel to the y axis moreover the hyperbolic distance between two points p 1 x 1 y 1 and p 2 x 2 y 2 in h 2 denoted as dh p 1 p 2 is given by cosh dh p 1 p 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 21 y 22 2 y 1 y 2 1 2 an hyperbolic circle with center c xc yc and hyperbolic radius is defined as b c w h 2 dh w c and its border is denoted as b c from 1 2 we obtain that b c x y h 2 x xc 2 y 2 2 yyc cosh y 2 c 0 1 3 3 corresponding to an euclidean circumference of radius yc sinh and center xc yc cosh the infinitesimal hyperbolic area is given by da dxdy y 2 1 4 and the area of the hyperbolic circle is thus b c 4 sinh 2 2 1 5 an equivalent definition of the hyperbolic half plane can be given in the com plex domain as the region h 2 z c im z 0 where the measure of the infinitesimal arc length is given by dz imz this formulation is convenient to express all isometries in h 2 which are given by the mo bius group of transformations see 4 m h 2 h 2 m z az b cz d with a b c d r ad bc 1 1 6 and will play an important role in the present work we can now give a brief description of our model the free particle moves along geodesic lines and is reflected by the scatterers considering that the hyperbolic velocity is defined as c t ds dt 1 y dx dt 2 dy dt 2 1 7 it is assumed that the particle moves at constant hyperbolic velocity c t c this means that the hyperbolic distance run by the particle in a time t is given by c t therefore an euclidean observer sees the particle moving with a position dependent velocity equal to c y without loss of generality one can assume c 1 we introduce the notion of poissonian distribution of obstacles in the poincare hyperbolic half plane the obstacles are hyperbolic balls of radius r whose centers are distributed according to a spatial poisson process which is homogeneous in the sense of the measure 1 4 i e the mean number of obstacle centers per unit hy perbolic area denoted as is uniform in h 2 this means that the obstacles are identical and homogeneously distributed in respect to the hyperbolic metric yet to an euclidean observer they appear to be smaller and denser when approaching to the x axis see figure 4 the main result of this study is the analysis of a boltzmann grad type limit in which the hyperbolic radius r of each obstacle decreases to zero and the density in the hyperbolic setting diverges to infinity so that the mean free path 2 sinh r 1 remains constant under this limit the density of our process converges to the density of some markovian random flight moreover we prove that this limit ran dom motion is similar to the process analysed by m pinsky 14 who generalized the well known euclidean isotropic transport process to the case of an arbitrary riemannian manifold 2 random obstacles in the poincare half plane 2 1 poisson random fields in h 2 assume that a countable set of points is randomly distributed on the poincare half plane h 2 with rate x y we say that is a poisson random field in h 2 if 4 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti for any appropriate set s h 2 the random variable n s namely the cardinality of s has the following distribution pr n s k e s s k k 2 1 with s s x y dxdy y 2 2 2 for any couple of disjoint regions s 1 and s 2 the random variables n s 1 and n s 2 are stochastically independent we here restrict our attention to the case where the rate is constant homogeneous hyperbolic poisson field thus the number of points inside any set s h 2 has poisson distribution with parameter s where s s dxdy y 2 2 3 is the hyperbolic area of s therefore the probability to have exactly n points in a region s and to find them inside the hyperbolic elements dc 1 dc 2 dcn around c 1 c 2 cn is given by pr p 1 dc 1 pn dcn n t n ne s dc 1 dcn 2 4 where dcj dxjdyj y 2 j 2 5 it is important to observe that the homogeneous poisson random field only depends on the measure of areas and therefore it is invariant under the group of isometries of h 2 expressed in 1 6 to have a more complete description of the homogeneous hyperbolic poisson field we treat briefly the distributions of the nearest neighbours points let us fix a point o h 2 and denote by tk the hyperbolic distance between o and the kth nearest point of denoting by b the hyperbolic ball of radius and by db the infinitesimal anulus of radii and d we have pr tk d pr n b k 1 pr n db 1 e b b k 1 k 1 db k 1 0 2 6 since b 4 sinh 2 2 the anulus db has measure 2 sinh d and thus pr tk d e 4 sinh 2 2 4 sinh 2 2 k 1 k 1 2 sinh d 2 7 in particular the distribution for the nearest neighbour t 1 reads pr t 1 d e 4 sinh 2 2 2 sinh d 2 8 with expectation e t 1 e 2 k 0 2 2 9 5 where k 0 z 0 e z cosh tdt 2 10 is the modified bessel function formula 2 8 is the hyperbolic counterpart of the well known rayleigh distribution which describes the distance t e 1 of the nearest neighbour point in the case of a poissonian random field in the euclidean plane pr t e 1 dr e r 22 rdr 2 11 with mean value e t e 1 1 2 2 12 by means of the asymptotic formula for the modified bessel function expression 2 9 reduces to 2 12 for large values of namely when the expected distance between poissonian points decreases and an euclidean description works well 2 2 poissonian obstacles we now introduce the notion of the poissonian distri bution of obstacles into the hyperbolic half plane h 2 and we distinguish between hard and soft obstacles which is a common practice for motions in euclidean spaces we are inspired by 13 where the author studies poissonian soft obstacles in a particular non euclidean manifold the surface of a sphere let us consider to be a homogeneous hyperbolic poisson field in h 2 with constant intensity and let us assume that each point p produces a potential around itself whose intensity is a function of the geodesic distance from p it is assumed that is compactly supported namely 0 for r the hyperbolic ball of center p and radius r where the function is non null is known as a soft obstacle when a particle hits a soft obstacle it is subject to an interaction described by of course the obstacles may overlap which occurs whenever the geodesic distance between two poissonian points is less than 2 r therefore at a certain point q the superposition of the action due to the points p 1 pn located in a hyperbolic ball br q defines a new random field v q n j 1 dh pjq 2 13 where n has poisson distribution with parameter br q and dh pjq is the geodesic distance between pj and q two facts play fundamental roles the first is that the random field 2 13 is homogeneous meaning that the distribution of v q does not depend on q the second is that 2 13 is isotropic namely the covariance between v q and v q only depends on the geodetic distance between q and q for the sake of brevity we omit a complete proof of these facts which can easily be obtained by following the same steps as in 13 hard obstacles are hyperbolic disks of radius r centered at the points of a poisson random field in h 2 in many models of random motions hard obstacles represent totally absorbing traps with random locations in other models they act as totally reflecting barriers and can be deemed to be the limiting case of soft obstacles where the following intensity function is considered r 0 r 6 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti thus in what follows we consider a system of hard obstacles whose centers are distributed according to a homogeneous hyperbolic poisson field of constant intensity a configuration of this kind is homogeneous and isotropic as already explained above 3 the lorentz process in the poincare half plane 3 1 description of the model let us now consider the following mechanical model a single particle moves in the poincare half plane where static circular obstacles are distributed according to a poisson measure at each instant t the state of the particle is described by the couple q v where q x y h 2 is the position in the half plane and v cos sin represents the direction of motion whenever the position q of a particle lies outside the obstacles the particle moves along the unique geodesic line tangent to v at the point q we assume that the particle has unit hyperbolic speed namely the hyperbolic distance traveled in a time t is equal to t for any initial state q v at t 0 the evolution of the particle position until the first collision is given by the geodesic flow q v t for t 0 the explicit expression of the geodesic flow is not essential now and will be given in the appendix formula 4 3 when a collision with an obstacle occurs the particle is reflected on its surface in our model we assume that the particle performs a specular reflection in h 2 now in order to generalize the notion of specular reflection from r 2 where it is straightforward to h 2 we recall these two basic facts the first one is that the measure of hyperbolic angles in the poincare half plane corresponds to the measure performed by an euclidean observer this is not true in general for all the models of hyperbolic space for instance the klein disk model the second one is that the angle between two geodesic lines coincides with the one formed by the corresponding euclidean tangents at the point of incidence as well as the angle between a geodesic line and a circle is the one detected by the respective tangent lines therefore we refer to the specular reflection in h 2 in the following way denoting respectively by g 1 and g 2 the pre collisional geodesic the tangent to the obstacle and the post collisional geodesic we say that the particle is specularly reflected if the angle between g 1 and is equal to the angle between g 2 and as shown in figure 1 due to collisions the sample paths of the moving particle are composed of arcs of circumferences pieced together for an expression of the piecewise geodesic flow see the appendix formula 4 8 as a first step assume now that a configuration of obstacle centers c c 1 c 2 cj is fixed let r be the hyperbolic radius of the obstacles for a given initial state q v the evolution of the particle position is given by the piecewice geodesic curve q v c t which clearly only depends on the obstacles of c centered within a hyperbolic distance t r from q since the hyperbolic velocity is assumed equal to 1 by deriving with respect to t we obtain the euclidean velocity of the particle i e the velocity perceived by an euclidean observer which is denoted by 7 figure 1 specular deflection of angle due to an obstacle whose hyperbolic euclidean center is ch ce the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are both equal to 2 q v c t the direction of motion is given by the unit vector v q v c t q v c t q v c t t 0 3 1 where denotes the euclidean norm hence we define the billiard flow among the obstacles configuration c as the following curve on the tangent bundle h 2 s 1 q v c t q v c t v q v c t t 0 3 2 by assuming that the locations of the obstacles is random the evolution of the particle defines a stochastic process qr t vr t t 0 on h 2 s 1 the subscript r representing the radius of the obstacles that we call hyperbolic lorentz process we denote its joint density by fr q v t and suppose that an initial condition fr q v 0 fin q v is given such that h 2 s 1 fin q v dqdv 1 the function fin should be chosen in such a way that its support lies outside the system of obstacles but here a difficulty arises since the obstacles location is random we can skip this problem by choosing fin as any probability density on h 2 s 1 and assuming that if the particle initially lies inside an obstacle it remains at rest forever it is important to note that such a constraint disappears in the limit of small obstacles considered in this study for each t 0 the joint density of the hyperbolic lorentz process is given by fr q v t e c fin q v c t 3 3 where the expectation is performed with respect to the poisson measure before stating the main result of the present work it is necessary to determine the probability distribution of the free path length among poissonian obstacles the calculation requires some properties of hyperbolic geometry and is shown in detail in the following section 8 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti 3 2 free path among poissonian obstacles let us consider a poissonian dis tribution of spherical obstacles of hyperbolic radius r in the poincare half plane suppose that a particle which is initially located at an arbitrary point q h 2 is shot towards an arbitrary direction v and moves along the geodesic line tangent to v at q we are interested in the probability distribution of the first hitting time t q v with the system of obstacles obviously under the assumption of unitary hyper bolic speed t q v coincides with the free path length namely with the hyperbolic distance traveled by the particle without having collisions the main idea is the following the free path t q v is greater than t if and only if none of the obstacles has its center in the tube q v t p h 2 inf s 0 t dh p q v s r 3 4 where dh p w is the hyperbolic distance between two points p and w of the hyper bolic plane in the euclidean case the tube is simply given by the union of a rectangle of sides 2 r and t and two half circles of radius r see figure 2 some difficulties arise in h 2 where surprisingly the two curves at hyperbolic distance r on either side of a geodesic line are not geodesic lines we have then to determine the shape and the hyperbolic area of q v t to this aim we use the following representation q v t 0 s t br q v s 3 5 in order to do that we make use of a suitable transformation in h 2 indeed one can show see 4 lemma 2 6 that among mo bius transformations 1 6 there exists a bijective isometry m q v h 2 h 2 such that 1 m q v s q v s s r 3 6 where q 0 1 and v 0 1 consequently q v s 0 es in other words m maps any geodesic line into a vertical geodesic line through m the region q v t is mapped into the region m q v t w h 2 inf s 0 t dh m 1 w q v s r w h 2 inf s 0 t dh w q v s r q v t 3 7 where we used that m is invertible it preserves distances and the property 3 6 so that the mapped region takes the following simple representation q v t 0 s t br 0 es 3 8 moreover sincem is an isometry it preserves areas whence we can finally compute the desired area as q v t q v t 3 9 1 we omit the calculations for sake of brevity m q v depends on q v as parameters for simplicity we will use the notation m in the following 9 figure 2 the euclidean tube like region q v t around the free particle trajectory now 3 8 is the region inside the envelope of the following family of curves ct br 0 s 1 s et 3 10 where br 0 s has cartesian equation h x y s x 2 y s cosh r 2 s 2 sinh 2 r 0 we obtain the envelope of ct by means of the following system h x y s 0 s h x y s 0 3 11 which gives the union of the following euclidean lines y x sinh r y x sinh r 3 12 thus the tube q v t is the section of a cone with vertex in 0 0 and central axis the line x 0 as shown in figure 3 it is now important to observe that 3 12 is tangent to br 0 1 at the points a tanh r 1 cosh r and b tanh r 1 cosh r and also tangent to br 0 e t at the points c et tanh r e t cosh r and d et tanh r e t cosh r moreover a and b lie on the geodesic line x 2 y 2 1 while c and d lie on x 2 y 2 e 2 t this makes it clear that q v t is composed of three parts the half circle below the geodesic segment ab the intermediate region q v t with vertices a b c d and the half circle above the geodesic segment cd the hyperbolic area of q v t is defined as q v t q v t dxdy y 2 by means of the substitutions x cos and y sin we have that q v t et 1 d d sin 2 2 t tan 10 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti figure 3 the hyperbolic tube like region q v t around the free particle trajectory where tan 1 sinh r is related to the slope of 3 12 finally the area of q v t is given by q v t 4 sinh 2 r 2 2 t sinh r 3 13 we can now come back to the probability distribution of the first hitting time t q v as before we denote by n s the number of points inside s by excluding the possibility that q is located within some obstacles we thus have pr t q v t n br q 0 pr t q v t n br q 0 pr n br q 0 e q v t e br q e 2 t sinh r where in the last equality we used 3 9 and 1 5 we conclude that t q v has an exponential probability distribution with parameter 2 sinh r thus the mean free path which is a fundamental quantity in what follows is given by 1 2 sinh r 1 3 14 performing the same calculation in the euclidean case leads to say that the free path has an exponential distribution of parameter 2 r and the mean free path is thus 2 r 1 3 3 the main theorem the most important result of the present work is the next theorem where we find a suitable scaling limit corresponding to small obsta cles among all possible scalings the one consisting in r 0 in such a way that 2 sinh r 0 11 that we call hyperbolic boltzmann grad limit in analogy with gallavotti s work ensures a non trivial approximation for fr q v t moreover as a final result we will also show see section 3 4 that the limit func tion f q v t is the probability density of a markovian process namely a random flight q t v t t 0 on the poincare half plane theorem 1 let qr t vr t t 0 be the lorentz process in the poincare half plane defined in such a way that the obstacles are disks of hyperbolic radius r whose centers are distributed as a hyperbolic homogeneous poisson field with intensity 2 sinh r let fin l h 2 s 1 be the initial probability density then in the limit r 0 the joint density fr of the lorentz process converges in l 1 sense to some probability density f for each t 0 moreover f solves the following equation t f q v t df q v t f 2 0 f q r v t 1 4 sin 2 d 3 15 f q v 0 fin q v where d is the operator of covariant differentiation along the geodesic lines and r is the rotation of an angle proof it is possible to write explicitly fr q v t of course fr q v t fin q v if q lies inside any obstacle the following calculations are made on condition that no obstacle center lies inside the ball of hyperbolic radius r around q let us suppose that the particle state at time t is given by q v and consider the backward trajectory we denote by n q v t the number of collisions which occurred up to time t from section 3 2 it is clear that pr n q v t 0 pr t q v t e 2 t sinh r 3 16 instead the probability that the particle collides exactly n obstacles whose centers are located in the infinitesimal hyperbolic areas dc 1 dcn around c 1 cn is pr n q v t n c 1 dc 1 cn dcn ne c q v t dc 1 dcn 3 17 where c q v t is the tube of hyperbolic width 2 r around the particle trajectory namely the tube like region swept by an ideal obstacle when its center is moved along the path while in the euclidean case this region is simply given by a non disjoint union of rectangles it here has a more complex shape and its hyperbolic area can be estimated as c q v t 2 t sinh r o sinh r 3 18 the particle density 3 3 can be written as fr q v t fin q v t e 2 t sinh r n 1 anq v fin q v c 1 cn t ne c q v t dc 1 dcn 3 19 where denotes the billiard flow defined in 3 2 and anq v is the subset of b n t r q containing all the obstacles configurations such that the backward trajectory with initial state q v collides with the n obstacles centered at c 1 cn following gallavotti s proof we observe that among all the possible configura tions of obstacles there are some such that the trajectory hits each obstacle at most once and there are others that lead to recollisions thus we can split fr into 12 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti figure 4 a typical backward trajectory with four collisions starting from the state q v at time t two components that we respectively call the markovian and the recollision terms fr q v t f m r q v t f rec r q v t 3 20 we now restrict our attention to the markovian term fmr q v t by considering the backward evolution let 1 n be the collision times such that 0 1 2 n t 3 21 and 1 n be the corresponding deflection angles then for a given particle trajectory there is a one to one correspondence between the 2 n variables c 1 cn and the 2 n variables 1 n 1 n we now obtain the transformation dc 1 dcn 1 2 n sinhn r sin 1 2 sin n 2 d 1 d nd 1 d n 3 22 which is a crucial point to prove the theorem for simplicity we treat the case n 1 the general case follows immediately by carrying out tedious calculations we explain how to determine the center c xc yc of the obstacle in terms of the flight time and the deflection angle let the particle be at position q and unit velocity v at time t we are interested in its backward evolution after a time the particle collides with the first obstacle namely a circle centered at c xc yc and it is reflected in a trajectory forming an angle with the incoming trajectory as shown in figure 1 in order to perform the calculation we first employ the mo bius transformation 3 6 in this way the particle backward trajectory is mapped into q v s 0 es for s 0 besides the obstacle centered at c xc yc is mapped into an obstacle 13 centered at c x c y c of the same hyperbolic radius 2 the traveled time is preserved under an isometry thus the point of impact is mapped into 0 e the deflection angle is also preserved since m is conformal as it is an isometry these facts will be of great importance in the following calculation finally we are interested in the area element dc that can be computed as dc dc dx c dy c y c 2 3 23 in this setting as can be clearly seen in figure 1 one can ideally reach the obstacle center c x c y c from the collision point 0 e it is sufficient to rotate the unit velocity of an angle 2 2 and to travel along a path of hyperbolic length r thus by using 4 3 we have x c e sinh r cos 2 cosh r sin 2 sinh r 3 24 y c e cosh r sin 2 sinh r 3 25 the jacobian determinant of the trasformation x c y c is given by det j 1 2 e 2 sinh r sin 2 cosh r sin 2 sinh r 2 3 26 and therefore the infinitesimal surface element is dc dx c dy c y c 2 1 2 sinh r sin 2 d d 3 27 as desired thus the markovian term can be then written as fmr q v t fin q v t e 2 t sinh r n 1 t 0 d 1 t 1 d 2 t n 1 d n 0 2 n d 1 d n fin q v 1 n 1 n t e c q v t n 2 n sinhn r sin 1 2 sin n 2 3 28 observe that the general term in the summation is bounded by fin l t n n which is the nth term of an exponential converging series thus in force of the dominated convergence theorem for the series passing to the limit as r 0 together with the assumption 2 sinh r we have that fmr q v t converges pointwise to 2 since m preserve distances it sends circumferences into circumferences 14 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti f q v t fin q v t e t e t n 1 n t 0 d 1 t 1 d 2 t n 1 d n 0 2 n d 1 d n 1 4 n sin 1 2 sin n 2 fin q v 1 n 1 n t 3 29 and the limit clearly holds also in l 1 sense by easy calculations we can check that 3 29 is a probability density since f l 1 h 2 s 1 f q v t dqdv 1 3 30 and furthermore it is bounded in the following way f l fin l 3 31 from 3 20 we have h 2 s 1 fr q v t dqdv h 2 s 1 fmr q v t dqdv h 2 s 1 frecr q v t dqdv 3 32 passing to the boltzmann grad limit it is clear that the left hand side of 3 32 is equal to 1 because the billiard flow obviously leaves the total probability mass invariant moreover conditions 3 30 and 3 31 and the dominated convergence theorem lead to 1 1 lim r 0 h 2 s 1 frecr q v t dqdv 3 33 the contribution of the recollision term thus vanishes in l 1 norm namely the measure of all the pathological paths goes to zero in the end by writing 3 20 as fr q v t f q v t fmr q v t f q v t f rec r q v t 3 34 immediately follows that fr q v t f q v t l 1 f m r q v t f q v t l 1 f rec r q v t l 1 3 35 under the boltzmann grad limit the right side of 3 35 vanishes and the proof of convergence is complete to prove that 3 29 is a solution to 3 15 we need to define two kinds of operators which are bounded in the norm l the first one is the semigroup of geodesic transport with damping given by ttf q v e tf q v t v q v t which is generated by a d where d denotes the operation of differentiation along the curve q v t v q v t lying in h 2 s 1 the second one is the collision operator lf q v 2 0 f q r v 1 4 sin 2 d 15 thus 3 29 can be written as f q v t ttfin q v n 1 0 s 1 sn t tt snltsn sn 1 lts 1 fin q v ds 1 dsn which is the duhamel expansion giving see 11 page 52 the solution to t f a l f and this concludes the proof 3 4 the limit markovian random flight we now show that a markovian transport process q t v t t 0 exists whose finite one dimensional distribu tion is given by 3 29 the rigorous construction of a process of this kind can be carried out by following the same steps as pinsky 14 who defined a random flight on the tangent bundle of a generic riemannian manifold we assume that q 0 q and v 0 v almost surely the case of distributed initial data is an immediate consequence we denote such a process by q q v t v q v t and we outline its construction let us consider a sequence of independent waiting times ej j 1 having distribution pr ej e 0 a particle moves along the geodesic lines in h 2 and changes direction at poisson times n e 1 e 2 en n 1 3 36 for 0 t 1 we have q q v t q v t v q v t q v t q v t 3 37 where is the geodesic flow defined in 4 3 the random point where the first deflection occurs and the corresponding post collisional velocity are respectively given by q 1 q v 1 v 1 r 1 v q v 1 3 38 where r denotes the rotation of an angle proceeding recursively the process is such that for n t n 1 q q v t qn vn t n v q v t qn vn t n qn vn t n 3 39 where the random point of the jth deflection and the jth post collisional velocity are denoted by qj qj 1 vj 1 ej vj r j v qj 1 vj 1 e j 3 40 a crucial point of the construction is that the deflection angles j are independent of the poissonian times and among themselves they have common distribution pr j d 1 4 sin 2 d 0 2 and this is consistent with the cross section due to the collision with a hard sphere 16 enzo orsingher costantino ricciuti and francesco sisti in the case where the process has initial density fin q v the single time density of q t v t t 0 is just given by 3 29 and it can be written as f q v t t tfin q v e fin q q v t v q v t where t t t 0 is a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on the space of differentiable and bounded functions on h 2 s 1 endowed with the norm l then following the same steps of pinsky 14 we can write the generator of t t the limit density 3 29 satisfies the following linear boltzmann type differential equation obviously coinciding with 3 15 t f q v t df q v t 2 0 f q r v t f q v t 1 4 sin 2 d where d denotes the operator of covariant differentiation along a geodesic line and r is the rotation of an angle 3 5 final remarks in this paper we studied the lorentz process and the related boltzmann grad limit on a classical model of hyperbolic geometry namely the poincare half plane it is not straightforward to show that our results hold in any hyperbolic space some problems could arise for example when calculating the mean free path as this is based on the knowledge of the volume of the tube like regions more precisely it would be interesting to study the lorentz process on another well known hyperbolic manifold namely the poincare disk d 2 which we recall to be defined as the set d 2 x y r 2 x 2 y 2 1 endowed with the metric ds 2 4 dx 2 dy 2 1 x 2 y 2 2 3 41 equivalently d 2 can be defined as the complex domain d 2 z c z 1 with infinitesimal arc length given by 2 dz 1 z 2 we believe that the isomorphism between h 2 and d 2 could be employed to study the lorentz process in this space the isomorphism is given by the cayley transform k h 2 d 2 that maps a point z h 2 into a point w d 2 w iz 1 z i 3 42 if a geodesic line in h 2 is represented by an euclidean half circle with center x 0 0 and radius r its image through k is given by an arc of circumference which is orthogonal to the border of d 2 having center at 2 x 0 x 20 r 2 1 x 20 r 2 1 x 20 r 2 1 and radius r such that r 2 2 r x 20 r 2 1 2 now although k represents a contraction of the half plane into the unitary disk it is a conformal transform namely it leaves angles between geodesic lines invariant and we saw how the measure of scattering angles plays a fundamental role in the study of the process the previous observation together with the fact that k 1 sends geodesic lines in d 2 into geodesic lines in h 2 suggests that a suitable use of the cayley transform could be the main tool in the study of the lorentz process in d 2 we remark that the assumption that hyperbolic angles coincide with the angles measured by an euclidean observer doesn t hold for example in the klein disc model 17 for hyperbolic space for random motions with branching on the klein disk see for example 10 finally we would like to state that we did not define the most general lorentz process on the hyperbolic half plane one could investigate for example the case of randomly moving obstacles as desvillettes and ricci did in 8 in an euclidean context it would be reasonable to assume that each obstacle moves with a fixed hyperbolic velocity following a gaussian distribution another line of research could be the analysis of the lorentz model when other boundary conditions are assumed e g the particle could be re emitted with a stochastic law instead of being specularly reflected by the obstacles 4 appendix piecewise geodesic motion on the hyperbolic half plane before writing an explicit expression for the geodesic flow in the poincare half plane we recall the corresponding one in the euclidean context if a particle starts at q r 2 with velocity v and is not subject to collisions the position at time t is well known to be equal to q v t q vt 4 1 on the other hand let 1 n be the hitting times with 0 1 2 n t 4 2 and let 1 n be the corresponding deflection angles the position of the particle at time t that we call q v n t for simplicity of notation can be written as q v n t q v 1 v 1 2 1 vn 1 n n 1 vn t n with vj r jvj 1 v 0 v r j representing the matrix of rotation of an angle j we now consider a particle starting at q x 0 y 0 h 2 with velocity v cos sin suppose that the particle moves along the geodesic line with hyper bolic velocity of intensity 1 then the position of the particle at time t is given by q v t x t y t x 0 y 0 sinh t cos cosh t sin sinh t y 0 cosh t sin sinh t 4 3 formula 4 3 can be obtained by observing that x t y t is obviously given by the intersection of 2 curves namely the hyperbolic circle of radius t centered at q x 0 y 0 having equation x x 0 2 y y 0 cosh t 2 y 20 sinh 2 t 4 4 and the geodesic line tangent to v at the point q having equation x x 0 y 0 tan 2 y 2 y 20 cos 2 4 5 by deriving 4 3 with respect to t we obtain the euclidean

case where the path is a piecewise geodesic let 1 n be the hitting times and 1 n be the corresponding deflection angles the particle starts at q x 0 y 0 with velocity v cos sin then it travels along the geo desic line until a time 1 when the position is q v 1 and the unit velocity is given by the vector v q v 1 which changes into v 1 cos 1 sin 1 r 1 v q v 1 during the time interval j 1 j the velocity evolves from vj 1 to v j and at time j it is changed to vj cos j sin j r jv j by iterating 4 3 we immediately obtain q v n t x n y n sinh t n cos n cosh t n sin n sinh t n y n 1 cosh t n sin
