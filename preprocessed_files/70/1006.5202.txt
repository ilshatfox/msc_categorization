magnetic field which is analogous to a constant uniform magnetic field in the euclidean space three integrals of motion are found and equations of motion are solved exactly in the special cylindrical coordinates motion on surface of the cylinder of constant radius is considered in detail pacs numbers 02 40 k 03 50 z keywords lobachevsky space magnetic field lagrange equations i introduction the description of a particle behavior in a constant uniform magnetic field is one of the basic problems in theoretical physics as well known in the case of the euclidean space this problem is exactly solved in the classical 1 and quantum 2 3 mechanics recently the generalization of the quantum mechanical solution to the case of the lobachevsky space was given 4 5 in the present paper an exact description of a relativis tic motion of a classical particle in an external magnetic field will be constructed on the background of the hyper bolic lobachevsky h 3 space this result can be used to describe the behavior of the charged particles in macro scopic magnetic field in the context of astrophysics ii the lagrange equations and integrals of motion we start with a metric of the lobachevsky space in the special cylindrical coordinates 6 ds 2 c 2 dt 2 cosh 2 z dr 2 2 cosh 2 z sinh 2 r d 2 dz 2 z r 0 0 2 1 where is a curvature radius the curvilinear coor dinates r z of the three dimensional lobachevsky space are connected with quasi cartesian coordinates of the comprehending four dimensional pseudo euclidean space by relations u 1 cosh z sinh r cos u 2 cosh z sinh r sin u 3 sinh z u 0 cosh z sinh r u 2 0 u 2 1 u 2 2 u 3 3 2 u 0 2 u 2 2 the given metric determines the explicit expression for a squared particle velocity dz dt 2 cosh 2 z dr dt 2 cosh 2 z 2 sinh 2 r d dt 2 3 in accordance with 4 5 we define a potential for a magnetic field in the following form a 2 b cosh r 1 4 this potential generalizes a potential for a constant uni form magnetic field with a strength b in the euclidean space when we choose the direction of the field as the z axis and use the usual cylindrical coordinates the po tential 3 is the solution of maxwell s equations in the lobachevsky space here these equations are reduced to a single equation 1 g xr g f r 0 where f r ar ra g cosh 2 z sinh r the relativistic lagrangian for a particle in above mag netic field is of the form l mc 2 1 c 2 eb 2 c cosh r 1 d dt 5 then the lagrange equations of the second order are expressed as d 2 r dt 2 2 tanh z dz dt dr dt sinh r cosh r d dt cosh 2 z d dt 6 http arxiv org abs 1006 5202 v 1 2 d dt 2 sinh 2 r cosh 2 z d dt 2 cosh r 1 0 7 d 2 z dt 2 1 cosh z sinh z dr dt 2 2 sinh 2 r d dt 2 0 8 here we have introduced notation for a quantity eb mc 1 c 2 9 the squared velocity is the integral of motion for the considered system in the lobachevsky space as the usual squared velocity is the integral of motion in the euclidean space it is obvious that a quantity i 2 cosh r 1 2 sinh 2 r cosh 2 z d dt 10 is conserved this integral of motion is the generalization of the usual angular momentum at last it is simply to verify that in addition to the conserved quantities and i third quantity a cosh 4 z dr dt 2 2 sinh 2 r d dt 2 11 is the integral of motion at it tends to the squared velocity of motion perpendicular to z axis iii integration of the equations of motion it should be stressed that the use of the special cylin drical coordinates allows us to find the simple analytical expressions for three integrals of motion in the presence of these conserved quantities it is easily to perform tran sition from the initial equations of the second order 5 7 to the following equations of the first order dz dt 2 a cosh 2 z 12 dr dt 2 a cosh 4 z i 2 cosh r 1 2 cosh 4 z 2 sinh 2 r 13 d dt i 2 cosh r 1 2 sinh 2 r cosh 2 z 14 first of all we consider eq 12 the sign of the quantity a determines the character of solution if a then we have the explicit expressions for the coordinate sinh z t 1 a sinh t t 0 15 and the velocity dz t dt a a sinh 2 t t 0 16 in this case a particle passes through the point z 0 with velocity dz dt a if a then we have other explicit expressions for the coordinate sinh z t a 1 cosh t t 0 17 and the velocity dz t dt a a sinh 2 t t 0 a 18 in this case the particle moves either in the region sinh z sinh z a 1 or in the region sinh z sinh z a 1 in other words there is the repulsion at the points z and z leading to existence of the forbidden region for motion it should be noted that velocity along z axis is con stant in the case of the euclidean space whereas velocity along z axis is variable in the case of the lobachevsky space from the equations 12 14 it is seen that after ob taining the explicit dependence z t the further solution of the problem is reduced to the following integrations sinh r dr w r dz cosh z cosh 2 z a 19 3 0 i 2 cosh r 1 dr sinh r w r 20 where w r a 2 sinh 2 r i 2 cosh r 1 2 both formula 19 for the dependence r z and formula 20 for the dependence r give the particle orbit now we examine the connection of and r in detail the integration in 20 leads to the following relation i 2 cosh r 2 c sinh r cos 0 21 where c a 2 2 1 2 i 2 2 22 a quantity c as function of a and i is the integral of motion and has the form c cosh 4 z dr dt 2 2 sinh 2 r cosh r cosh 2 z d dt 2 23 c 0 iv the motion on the cylindrical surface let us compare formula 21 with the well known for mula cosh r cosh r cosh r 0 sinh r sinh r cos 0 24 describing in the lobachevsky space a circle of radius r 0 if a distance between a circle center and the origin of coordinates is r formulas 21 and 24 coincide if the parameters r and r 0 are connected with the integrals of motion a and i by the relations cosh r 0 1 1 a 2 2 25 cosh r i 2 2 1 a 2 2 26 we emphasize that the expressions 25 and 26 be come sensible if the inequality a 2 2 27 is accomplished then in the r projection a par ticle moves along the circle the circle center is shifted with respect to the origin taking into account a mo tion in the z direction we get a complete motion on the cylindrical surface the coincidence of a coordinate ori gin and a circle center corresponds to the zeroth value of the integral of motion c in this case a z axis coincides with a cylinder axis the transition to this coordinate system leads to the considerable simplification from the condition c 0 we see that dr dt 0 r r 0 28 d dt cosh r 0 cosh 2 z 29 in this case the integrals of motion a and i are ex pressed via the circle radius r 0 as follows a 2 2 tanh 2 r 0 30 i 2 1 cosh r 0 1 31 taking into account the relations 15 18 we get the explicit formulas describing evolution of an angle and an angular velocity if a we obtain the following expressions t 0 cosh r 0 a artanh a tanh t t 0 32 d t dt cosh r 0 a sinh 2 t t 0 33 and if a we obtain other expressions t 0 cosh r 0 a artanh a tanh t t 0 34 4 d t dt cosh r 0 a sinh 2 t t 0 a 35 in the case of the euclidean space the angular velocity is constant whereas in the case of the lobachevsky space the angular velocity is variable and tends to zero at t v conclusion in conclusion several additional remarks should be given it can be shown that the formula 21 for trajec tories in the form f r 0 describes not only the mo tions on cylindrical surfaces shifted or not with respect to the initial axis z but also describes motions infinite in radial variable r so there exist two different classes of trajectories finite and infinite in radial variable besides it can be demonstrated that the potential of the magnetic field 4 is invariant with respect to shifts in the lobachevsky space in the plane perpendicular to the axis z this symmetry underlies the structure of two families of possible solutions of the equations of motion providing us with a transitivity group acting within two classes of motions all results can be extended to a spherical riemann model s 3 on the base of the metric ds 2 c 2 dt 2 cos 2 z dr 2 2 cos 2 z sin 2 r d 2 dz 2 z 2 2 r 0 0 2 36 and a potential for a magnetic field in s 3 according to a 2 b cos r 1 37 vi acknowledgments the authors are grateful to e a tolkachev for valu able comments and
