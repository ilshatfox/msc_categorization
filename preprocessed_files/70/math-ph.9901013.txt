structures s p hrabak abstract a geometric multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry of constrained first order classical field theories is described to effect this we introduce graded analogues of the bundles and manifolds of the multisymplectic formulation of first order field theories the lagrange d alembert formalism is also developed in terms of the multisymplectic frame work the result is a covariant hamiltonian bfv formalism in an accompanying preceding paper 9 the author detailed the homological algebra which provided an algebraic description of the marsden weinstein multi symplectic reduction the study of multisymplectic geometry 1 2 3 13 23 arose in the context of the search for the geometric foundations of classical field theory 17 18 19 20 we turn in this paper to a study of those multisymplectic man ifolds which form the geometric foundations of first order classical field theories we develop a geometric multisymplectic formalism describing the classical brst 1 symmetry of constrained first order classical field theories whose symmetries arise by virtue of the prolongation of a group action by bundle morphisms of the config uration bundle the essence of the geometric formulation is to encode the algebraic structures of the homological description of marsden weinstein multisymplectic re duction into geometric structures on graded multisymplectic manifolds 1 in the first section we introduce the lagrange multiplier into the multisym plectic framework we effect this by virtue of the introduction of a certain integrable distribution whose existence follows by virtue of the assumed free and proper group action by bundle automorphisms on the configuration bun dle we make use of this distribution in order to define a configuration bun dle multiphase space and covariant phase space extended by the addition of a lagrange multiplier and its canonical momenta we then generalise the lagrange d alembert formalism to the multisymplectic context whence we obtain both the generalised lagrange d alembert hamiltonian equations of motion and the conservation of the covariant noether currents from a single elegant geometric

section we construct graded analogues of the configuration bun dle the multiphase space and the corresponding covariant phase space of the multisymplectic formalism the geometric constructions described here for malise the introduction of the grassmann odd degrees of freedom known in the literature as ghosts 3 in the third section we shall complete the translation of the algebraic struc tures needed in the homological description of marsden weinstein multisym plectic reduction into geometric structures on graded multisymplectic mani folds we introduce a certain abelian grassmann odd bundle morphism of the graded configuration bundle which upon prolongation to the graded covariant phase space is the classical brst symmetry upon projection of the abelian grassmann odd bundle morphism to the configuration bundle one regains the original non abelian gauge automorphism of the configuration bundle the observables on the graded multisymplectic manifold form a z 2 z 2 graded poisson leibniz algebra we identify the algebraic differential complex of 9 with a pair consisting of a subalgebra of the algebra of observables and the poisson leibniz derivation generated by a grassmann odd n 1 form the grassmann odd n 1 form is the lifted momentum observable corresponding to the abelian grassmann odd bundle morphism of the graded configura tion bundle the observables on the reduced multisymplectic manifold are obtained as the zeroth homology of this geometric differential complex 4 in the fourth section we combine the lagrange d alembert formalism with the graded multisymplectic formalism in order to obtain a covariant hamiltonian bfv formalism 5 in the fifth section we shall illustrate the new formalism by deriving a new brst algebra for the well known exemplar of yang and mills the novelty in our covariant hamiltonian approach is that the resulting brst algebra is polynomial in the canonical variables unlike the non covariant approach where one finds the algebra to include spatial derivatives of the canonical variables 6 we conclude in the final section with an appendix containing a brief descrip tion of those elements of the multisymplectic formulation of first order field theories prerequisite to the exposition in this paper we thus obtain a covariant hamiltonian geometric formulation of the classical brst symmetry for first order field theories 1 a multisymplectic lagrange d alembert formalism the bfv formulation 11 of the classical brst symmetry includes a pair of dynamical variables which are the lagrange multiplier of the lagrange d alembert variational principle and canonically conjugate momenta which is prescribed to vanish so that the introduction of the lagrange multiplier does not introduce extra dynamical degrees of freedom since we should like to construct a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry it is therefore necessary to formulate the existence of this pair within the multisymplectic formalism in the first sub section we shall introduce the lagrange multiplier distribution we thus encode the notion of a lagrange multiplier into a geometric structure we shall show that our characterisation generalises the usual definition in the symplectic to the on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 3 multisymplectic case in the second subsection we shall use the lagrange multi plier distribution in order to define a configuration bundle and multiphase space extended by the addition of a lagrange multiplier and a canonically conjugate multimomenta in the final subsection we shall formulate a generalisation of the hamiltonian equations of the lagrange d alembert variational principle for field theories in terms of a geometric equation on a certain multisymplectic manifold 1 1 the lagrange multiplier distribution in order to formulate the hamil tonian bfv structures within the multisymplectic formalism we need to introduce lagrange multipliers and the canonically conjugate momenta we obviously need to know how to capture within the multisymplectic framework the notion of the lagrange multiplier a suitable starting point is an intrinsic property of the la grange multiplier within classical mechanics namely that the lagrange multiplier is a section of the cotangent bundle that annihilates the constraint distribution in the following we shall extend this characterisation to the case of those free and proper group actions on multisymplectic manifolds that arise by virtue of the pro longation of automorphisms of e covering diffeomorphisms of b viz a morphism of the configuration bundle see 6 all gauge symmetries are of this type let a a 1 dimg be a basis of the lie algebra g then if g acts by au tomorphisms of e covering diffeomorphisms of b then the corresponding vector fields are projectable namely in the adapted local coordinates they take the form ea a x x ia x u ui the ea x u span a subspace of the tangent space of e at x u let l x u e e a x u since we assume that the action of g is free diml x u e dimg x u e we therefore have a distribution over e namely le x u e l x u e definition 1 1 let l denote the lagrange multiplier distribution le l e having defined the distribution l we need to determine the local adapted coor dinates on l induced from those on recall that the local adapted coordinates of a point p u e are x ui see 6 by definition the fibres of the distri bution l have a global basis given by ea a 1 dimg any element v lpe of the fibre at p may therefore be written in the form v a 1 dimg a ea the a are uniquely determined by x ui and v they therefore determine coor dinate functions lpe r dimg in summary we have a coordinate chart u lpe r n m rdimg p v x ui a in 11 the lagrange multipliers are introduced as functions which parametrise the gauge orbits in the geometric formulation presented here this is made more precise by the explicit introduction of the distribution l proposition 1 2 the lagrange multiplier distribution l is integrable proof let x y l x u then in terms of local coordinates they may be written as x xa ea and y y a ea so that x y x a ea y b eb x ay b ea e b xa ea y c y b eb x c ec x ay bccab x a ea y c y b eb x c ec l x u definition 1 3 the constraint distribution d is the tangent bundle of the con straint submanifold namely tc in the context of interest to us the constraint submanifold is the manifold defined as the inverse image of the covariant momentum map corresponding to the lift of 4 s p hrabak the g action by bundle morphisms on the configuration bundle to the multiphase space m it is a distribution as the dimension of each fibre is constant by the assumed regularity of the covariant momentum map from the marsden weinstein multisymplectic reduction theorem see 9 we learn that the hamiltonian vector fields corresponding to the covariant noether currents span the symplectic comple ment of the constraint distribution the prolongations of the ea to the multiphase space thus span the symplectic complement of the constraint distribution the property that the lagrange multiplier is the annihilator of the constraint distribu tion is thus encoded within the following result proposition 1 4 the prolongation of the automorphism of generated by the ea spans a distribution over m that is the annihilator of the constraint distribution d 1 2 the lagrange multiplier extended bundles this subsection is an expo sition of the construction of the extended bundles associated with the introduction of lagrange multipliers into the multisymplectic formulation of first order field the ories the lagrange multiplier distribution l defines a bundle lb over b by virtue of the first of the two diagrams below the projection lb is thus defined to be lb l le l lb e j 1 lb 0 lb 0 lb 1 lb lb vv vv vv vv v b b definition 1 5 the extended configuration bundle lb is the triple le lb b the bundle lb has local adapted coordinates x ui a although l and lb have the same local adapted coordinates an important difference lies in the structures of their respective vertical bundles recall that the vertical bundle plays an important role in the definition of the multiphase space see 6 the structure of the vertical bundle v lb leads to a multiphase space extended by the additional structure of a lagrange multiplier and the canonically conjugate multi momenta the first jet bundle j 1 lb over lb has one jets which in local coordinates take the form j 1 u x x ui a ui a note that in comparison the one jets of the first jet bundle over l take the local form j 1 u x x ui a ui a u i j a j the first jet bundle over l is therefore a much larger bundle than we want the commutivity of the second of the two diagrams above defines the surjective sub mersion 0 lb lb 0 lb 1 we define the affine dual of the first jet bundle over lb by the following short exact sequence c f 6 0 n 0 lb i n 1 lb lb j 1 lb 0 proposition 1 6 n 1 lb is endowed with a canonical n form lb in local coordinates it takes the form lb pdnx p i du i dn 1 x b a d a dn 1 x proof let denote an n form on lb and let denote the corresponding section they are related by a canonical n form lb on lb according to lb the point in n 1 lb with coordinates x ui a p i b a p is the n form on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 5 pdnx p i du i dn 1 x b a d a dn 1 x at x ui a of lb then lb is uniquely determined to be lb pdnx p i du i dn 1 x b a d a dn 1 x by the tautology lb definition 1 7 let m lb n 1 lb we call the pair m lb lb where lb d lb the extended multiphase space in terms of the local adapted coordinates onm lb namely x ui a p i b a p the cartan n 1 form takes the form lb dp dnx dui dp i d n 1 x d a db a d n 1 x 1

hamiltonian equations of the lagrange d alembert formalism for a classical mechanical system subject to constraints there exists a formulation of the principle of least action called the lagrange d alembert principle by virtue of which the lagrangian equations of motion on the constraint subman ifold are obtained for our purposes the corresponding hamiltonian equations are more interesting for in this section we shall formulate the covariant analogue of hamilton s equations in a lagrange d alembert formalism for first order field theories for classical mechanical systems with generalised coordinates qi generalised mo menta pi where i 1 m hamiltonian h subject to constraints a where a 1 dimg the lagrange d alembert hamilton equations take the following form q i h pi um m pi p i h qi um m qi 2 in 7 8 these equations are obtained by virtue of a variational argument as is characteristic of the multisymplectic formalism we shall find that the analogue of these equations for first order field theories may be written as a geometric equation we begin by considering the extended multiphase spacem lb recall that the local adapted coordinates on m lb are x ui a p i b a p let m l 0 be the submanifold of m lb which is defined locally by the vanishing of the lagrange multiplier momentum namely b a 0 this is admissible because the triviality of 6 s p hrabak the distribution le since the fibres le have a global basis le e rg it there fore follows that tle te trg the global coordinates a a 1 dimg on r g then define a canonical global basis of trg namely a a 1 dimg the lifted momentum observables based on the vector fields a a 1 dimg are then also globally defined they take the form ba b a d n 1 x declaring ba 0 then im plies that b a 0 globally as the d n 1 x 1 n are linearly independent one may interpret the submanifoldm l 0 as the multiphase space of non propagating lagrange multipliers recall that in the formulation of the lagrange d alembert variational principle in mechanics we require that the lagrange multipliers enforce the constraint but do no work that is they have no propagating degrees of freedom the selection of this submanifold is an encoding of this requirement m l 0 has adapted local coordinates x ui a p i p let i be the immersion of m l 0 into m lb then we may use this immersion to pull back the cartan n form on m lb to m l 0 the result may be expressed in terms of the local adapted coordinates as 0 i lb pdnx p i du i dn 1 x corresponding to the multiphase spacem l 0 there exists a covariant phase space j 1 l 0 which we define by a short exact sequence namely 0 n 0 l 0 i m l 0 l j 1 l 0 0 recall that the covariant hamiltonian equations are encoded entirely within the the cartan n 1 form clearly if we wish to obtain the hamiltonian equations of the lagrange d alembert formalism we must enrich the structure of the cartan form we achieve this end by adding to the cartan n form a term of the form ad a where we write a for the pull back i a definition 1 8 the extended cartan n 1 form is ex d 0 ad a in the local adapted coordinates it takes the form ex dp dnx dp i du i dn 1 x d a d a 3 let h be the hamiltonian defined by p h by virtue of the legendre trans formation 4 5 we pull back the extended cartan form fromm l 0 to j 1 l 0 by virtue of the section p determined by p h let ex h p ex in the local adapted coordinates ex h takes the form ex h dh dnx dui dp i d n 1 x d a d h a where h a p a p i i a h a d n 1 x p i a du i d nx 22 definition 1 9 let be the prolongation to m l 0 of a section of lb satisfies the covariant lagrange d alembert hamilton equations iff u exh 0 u j 1 l 0 t j 1 l 0 4 proposition 1 10 let g a p i i a and f ai p i a for the case of the gen erators a arising by virtue of an automorphism of e covering the non trivial diffeomorphisms on b then in terms of the local adapted coordinates the covariant on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 7 lagrange d alembert

h p l dnx dul dn 1 x l ad a dn 1 x h p l a d a dn 1 x a d a dul dn 2 x 8 from which follow hamilton s equations of the lagrange d alembert formalism then setting a equal to zero we obtain corollary 1 11 for the case of the generators a arising by virtue of an au tomorphism of e covering the identity on b then in terms of the local adapted coordinates the covariant lagrange d alembert hamiltonian equations take the form p i h ui g a ui a ui h p i g a p i a 0 d h a where here d dx x 9 the equation 0 d h a is the covariant form of noether s theorem see 22 from which we learn that the covariant noether current h a is constant i e dx h a 0 we therefore have obtained from our multisymplectic 8 s p hrabak formulation of the lagrange d alembert principle both the lagrange d alembert hamiltonian equations of motion and the conservation of the noether current note that when dimb 1 and upon identification ua a we regain the lagrange d alembert hamiltonian equations for classical mechanics 2 the graded multisymplectic formalism in the usual formulation of the classical brst symmetry the classical phase space is enlarged by introducing a grassmann odd coordinate whose components equal in number the number of constraint equations and canonically conjugate momenta these grassmann odd coordinates were first introduced in the context of a path integral quantisation of constrained classical field theories in that con text they were termed ghosts since they were deemed to be unobservable the brst symmetry is then introduced as a grassmann odd symplectomorphism of this extended phase space in this section we shall give a new formulation of these classical structures in the context of multisymplectic geometry in this section we construct the graded configuration bundle the graded mul tiphase space and the corresponding graded covariant phase space for which the brst formalism takes the form of a grassmann odd nilpotent multisymplectomor phism we do not at this stage introduce the lagrange multiplier the formulation expounded in this section therefore corresponds to the minimal formulation of the hamiltonian bfv where one introduces only ghosts and not the anti ghosts 8 in a section which is to follow we will construct the lagrange multiplier extension which includes the introduction of anti ghosts 2 1 the graded configuration bundle we begin by defining the graded ex tension to the configuration bundle obtained by introducing the ghosts we effect this extension by virtue of an elaboration of the grassmann even geometry of the configuration bundle e to a z 2 graded geometry recall the functor from the cat egory of smooth vector bundles v to the category of graded manifolds s v asso ciating the bundle with its total space obtained by reversing the grassmann parity of its fibres that is v s v v v is the inversion functor it is idempotent and acts upon the fibres of vector bundles as rp rp 0 r 0 p see 24 for details in the definition which is to follow we shall use again the lagrange multiplier distribution this time we shall use the inversion functor in order to enlarge the configuration bundle by a grassmann odd superstructure the appropriateness of this definition will become apparent as the ensuing structures unfold le l le l lb e c cc cc cc c e yy yy yy yy y b the above diagram illustrates the construction and defines the surjections l l and lb l definition 2 1 the graded configuration bundle lb is the triple le lb b on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 9 by an analogous construction as for lb the distribution lb has adapted local coordinates x ui a where the a are grassmann odd again by anal ogy any element x lpe of the fibre at p may therefore be written in the form x a 1 dimg a ea the a are uniquely determined by x ui and x they there fore determine grassmann odd coordinate functions lpe r 0 dimg in summary we have a coordinate chart u lpe r n m r 0 dimg p x x ui a the graded configuration bundle lb therefore has adapted local coordinates x ui a the a are to be identified as ghosts recall that gauge symmetries in the multisymplectic formalism occur as prolongations of automorphisms of the configuration bundle 5 it is therefore natural that the grassmann odd brst symmetry ought to likewise occur as the prolongation of a grassmann odd bundle automorphism of the graded configuration bundle we shall show that the brst momentum observable is indeed the lifted momentum observable see 6 associated to the following grassmann odd globally defined vector field on lb namely v a lb a 1 2 ccab a b c 10 2 2 the graded multiphase space and graded configuration bundle in this subsection we shall construct the graded multiphase space and the graded covariant phase space corresponding to the graded configuration bundle lb we shall see that we may choose either a grassmann even or grassmann odd car tan n 1 form we shall advocate a graded multiphase space together with the grassmann even cartan n 1 form as the covariant multisymplectic analogue of the extended phase space of the usual brst formalism the first jet bundle of lb namely j 1 lb has 1 jets which in the adapted local coordinates take the form j 1 u x x ui a ui a the surjective sub mersion 0 lb is defined by the commutivity of the following diagram to be 0 lb lb 0 lb 1 where 0 lb 1 is the surjection mapping each one jet onto its source j 1 lb 0 lb 1 0 lb lb lb yytt tt tt tt tt b since lb is a graded manifold the forms on lb are z 2 graded so that the bundle n lb enjoys the following splitting property n lb n lb even n lb odd we shall choose the graded multiphase space to have total space n 1 lb even this choice leads to the identification of a unique canonical grassmann even n form on the multiphase space with the cartan n form this choice is also related to the fact that the jet bundle and its dual are to be related by the legendre transformation defined by a grassmann even lagrangian one may also choose a multiphase space with a grassmann odd cartan form this leads to a bracket on the n 1 forms which will pair grassmann odd observables to canonically conjugate grassmann even observables one might call the bracket corresponding to this second choice an anti bracket although it is intriguing to speculate that this second 10 s p hrabak choice may be related to the bv formulation we do not pursue this direction at this time the affine dual j 1 lb of the first jet bundle is defined by the following short exact sequence 0 n 0 lb even i n 1 lb even lb j 1 lb 0 n 0 lb and n 1 lb are defined in the same manner as in the ungraded con text see 6 let s denote n 1 lb even then s has adapted local coordinates x ui a p i p a p the commuting diagram below defines the surjective submer sions lb 0 lb 1 lb lb lb lb 0 lb lb 0 lb 1 s lb lb lb lb lb e ee ee ee ee j 1 lb 0 lb 1 oo 0 lb zzuu uu uu uu uu b proposition 2 2 s is endowed with a canonical grassmann even n form lb in local coordinates it takes the form lb pdnx p i du i dn 1 x p a d a dn 1 x proof the statement follows from the tautology lb where is the section corresponding to the grassmann even n form at x ui a of lb which corresponds to point x ui a p i p a p of s in local coordinates takes the form pdnx p i du i dn 1 x p a d a dn 1 x definition 2 3 the pair s lb is the graded multiphase space where lb d lb in the local adapted coordinates on s namely x ui a p i p a p the cartan n 1 form takes the form lb dp dnx dui dp i d n 1 x d a dp a d n 1 x 11 definition 2 4 a hamiltonian h on j 1 lb is a local section of the line bundle s lb j 1 lb definition 2 5 the pair j 1 lb lb h is the covariant phase space where the cartan form on lb h is obtained from that on s by pulling it back via the section h the pair j 1 lb lb h is a graded multisymplectic manifold definition 2 6 let j 1 b j 1 lb be the prolongation to j 1 lb lb h of a section of the graded configuration bundle j 1 satisfies hamilton s equations iff j 1 lb h 0 j 1 lb t j 1 lb on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 11 for a local section h of the line bundle s lb j 1 lb given by p h x ui a p i p a the covariant hamiltonian equations take the form p i x h ui ui x h p i p a x h a a x h p a 12 3 the geometric multisymplectic brst formulation of marsden weinstein reduction for first order field theories in this section we translate the algebraic structures of the homological description of marsden weinstein multisymplectic reduction 9 into geometric structures on graded multisymplectic manifolds we identify the differential complex of 9 with a pair consisting of a subalgebra of the algebra of observables on j 1 lb lb h and a grassmann odd n 1 form it then follows that the observables on the re duced multisymplectic manifold are obtained as the zeroth homology of this geo metric differential complex 3 1 the z 2 z 2 graded poisson leibniz algebra of observables in this subsection we shall describe the algebra of observables corresponding to the graded covariant phase space j 1 lb lb h the analogue of the z 2 graded poisson leibniz algebra of observables on a multisymplectic manifold 9 14 15 16 is a bi graded poisson leibniz algebra definition 3 1 the algebra of observables on j 1 lb lb h is the z 2 z 2 graded poisson leibniz algebra h j 1 lb lb h any element k h j 1 lb lb h has bi degree gk hk where gk n k 1 and hk is equal to 1 if k is grassmann odd and is equal to 0 if k is grassmann even k is the form degree of k the poisson leibniz bracket is defined to be f g 1 n f x f dg and satisfies the following properties 1 the left bi graded loday identity f g h f g h 1 gfgg hfhg g f h 13 2 the bi graded right poisson leibniz rule f g h f g h 1 g gh hhhg f h g 14 as a consequence of the left bi graded loday identity we have the following gen eralised bi graded commutivity c f 15 namely f g h gfgg hfhg g f h 15 we have the following subalgebras of h j 1 lb lb h 1 i the z 2 z 2 graded lie algebra of hamiltonian forms on j 1 lb lb h namely h j 1 lb lb h and 2 ii the z 2 graded lie algebra of hamiltonian n 1 forms on j 1 lb lb h namely h j 1 lb lb h 12 s p hrabak 3 2 the origin of the brst symmetry in this subsection we shall detail the form that the classical brst symmetry takes within the multisymplectic formalism more precisely we shall show that the brst multimomentum observable arises by virtue of the prolongation to the graded configuration phase space of a grassmann odd commuting automorphism of the graded configuration bundle recall that the sections of the distribution lb take the form x a 1 dimg a lba 16 the lie bracket of two such sections as vector fields on lb is then x x a b 1 dimg a bccab lb c in 2 1 we introduced a globally defined grassmann odd vector field on lb which is constructed by adding to a typical section of lb a term involving the structure constants of the group action namely v a lba 1 2 ccab a b c that this vector field is indeed globally defined is guaranteed by the triviality of lagrange multiplier distribution adding the extra term has the effect that this grassmann odd vec tor field has vanishing lie bracket with itself that is v v 0 the vector field generates a grassmann odd automorphism of the graded configuration bundle so corresponding to the possibly non abelian group action on e by bundle automor phisms we have constructed a grassmann odd commuting bundle automorphism of lb this is the origin of the classical brst symmetry the essence of the brst symmetry is thus an abelianisation of bundle automorphisms one thus trades a non abelian grassmann even bundle morphism for an abelian grassmann odd bundle morphism the lifted momentum observable corresponding to the vector field v is defined by 0 lb 1 v where s are n forms on lb see 6 2 in terms of the local adapted coordinates on s pdnx p i du i dn 1 x p a d a dn 1 x and the lifted momentum observable takes the form 1 2 a b c 1 dimg cabc b cpa a 1 dimg a a 17 we then pull back to j 1 lb via the section defined by p h and obtain h which in the local adapted coordinates takes the form h 1 2 a b c 1 dimg c a bc b cpa a 1 dimg a h a 18 h is not a hamiltonian n 1 form for lb h in the case where a is the lifted momentum observable corresponding to bundle automorphisms of e covering non trivial diffeomorphisms of b it is however for bundle automorphisms of e covering the identity on b one can most easily see that this is the case if one observes that in the former case d h contains a term involving d a dui d n 2 x which can not be obtained by taking the inner product of any vector field with lb h h is however a generalised hamiltonian n 1 form proposition 3 2 the brst n 1 form h generates as a left poisson leibniz derivation namely h a nilpotent generalised multisymplectomorphism of j 1 lb lb h on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 13 proof the adjoint operator h is nilpotent iff h h 0 this may be seen seen from the following identity f h h f h h h f h loday identity f h h h h f generalised commutivity f h h 1 2 h h f loday identity 19 then by direct computation

identity for the lie algebra of g the final three terms cancel each other so that we have obtained the desired result namely h h 0 3 3 the geometric brst homology and the reduced observables in this subsection we shall obtain the observables on the reduced multisymplectic manifold by virtue of a differential complex which is constructed from natural glob ally defined geometric objects on the graded covariant phase space the nilpotent differential is given by the adjoint operator h recall that the brst n 1 form takes the form h 1 2 cabc b cpa a h a the brst n 1 form is globally defined by virtue of the triviality of the distribution le for this implies that the fibre coordinates a a 1 dimg and the canonical momentum observable pa a 1 dimg and hence h are globally defined the reduced observables were obtained in 9 as the zeroth cohomology of the complex b d where b h m w g we shall show that the zeroth cohomology of this differential complex is isomorphic to the poisson leibniz derivation of the brst n 1 form on a certain subalgebra of the poisson leibniz algebra of observables on the graded covariant phase space j 1 lb lb h let x be the vector space with basis a 1 a 2 ak a 1 a 2 ak and let y be the vector space with basis pa a 1 dimg then the exterior algebra over y namely y has the basis pa 1 pa 2 pak a 1 a 2 ak one may then form the tensor product y x we claim the algebra y x plays the same role in the geometric framework of this paper as w g played in the algebraic framework of 9 that g is graded isomorphic to x where we have written 14 s p hrabak the product in the latter by juxtaposition is clear by the correspondence of a b to a b when the covariant noether currents arise by virtue of bundle automorphisms of e covering the identity on b e g for background field theories we claim that y and w are isomorphic as graded associative algebras in the more gen eral case of non trivial diffeomorphisms of b e g for parametrised field theories we shall see that p y is isomorphic to p w for all p such that p n 1 n in particular for p 0 1 they are always isomorphic that y and w are isomorphic as vector spaces follows from their definitions as dimw dimy dimg the graded associative products on w and y are identical to see this recall that see 9 for w r w and w s w one has w y 1 rs n 2 w w then for y r v and y s y one has y y 1 rs n 1 2 1 rsy y 1 rs n 2 2 rsny y 1 rs n 2 y y as required the structure of the basis defining w is such that s w for all s z such that s n 1 n for the case of automorphisms of e covering the identity on b and s w for all s z such that s n 2 n for the case of automorphisms of e covering nontrivial diffeomorphisms on b correspondingly s y for all s z such that s n 1 n we have therefore established that y s n 1 n s 0 s w as graded associative algebras j 1 is a submanifold of j 1 lb which is called the body of j 1 lb the superstructure which arises on j 1 by virtue of the superstructure added to the configuration bundle to form the graded configuration bundle is called the soul of j 1 lb 6 since j 1 is a submanifold of j 1 lb it follows that the graded poisson leibniz algebra of observables on j 1 is a poisson leibniz subalgebra of the bi graded poisson leibniz algebra of observables on j 1 lb from h j 1 and y x we may then construct the algebra a h j 1 y x which is the geometric analogue of the algebra b of 9 the following theorem is the fruit of the geometric multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry in which we obtain the true physical degrees of freedom of the constrained dynamical system under consideration theorem 3 3 the observables on the reduced multisymplectic manifold are given by the zeroth cohomology of the complex a h that is h 0 h a h b b 20 proof i let us firstly consider the case for noether currents for which the cor responding bundle morphism is the identity on b in this case we have shown that the graded vector spaces a and b are graded isomorphic we wish to show that the complexes a h and b d are isomorphic we also learn from proposition 3 2 that h is nilpotent it therefore only remains to show that the two differentials agree on generators by direct computation one finds that this on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 15 is indeed the case f h f h a a f d f a a pa h c d ab bpd h a wa d c d abwd b a a h 1 2 cabc b c a d 1 2 cabc b c the derivation h then agrees on products of the generators with d by virtue on the bi graded right leibniz rule the derivation h does not since it does not satisfy a leibniz like rule on products this concludes the proof as the differential complexes are isomorphic they have isomorphic cohomology and the statement follows ii for the more general case of noether currents for which the corresponding bundle morphism involves a non trivial diffeomorphism of b the graded vector spaces a andb are not quite graded isomorphic however recall 9 that the koszul complex gives a resolution of the poisson leibniz algebra of observables on the constraint submanifold the salient feature is that the koszul homology vanishes at all levels other than the zeroth one thus notes that it is only 0 w and 1 w that contribute to the homology since 0 w 0 y and 1 w 1 y even in this more general case we have the desired result 4 the lagrange d alembert graded formalism covariant hamiltonian bfv the bfv non covariant hamiltonian formulation of the classical brst sym metry involves the introduction of the lagrange multiplier the ghosts anti ghosts and their canonically conjugate momenta in this section we shall combine the lagrange d alembert formalism of 1 with the graded multisymplectic formalism of 2 in order to obtain a covariant hamiltonian bfv formalism 4 1 the extended lagrange distribution in the lagrange d alembert for malism of 1 we defined a certain submanifold of the graded multiphase space by virtue of the vanishing of the noether current ba this submanifold corresponded to the multiphase space extended by the addition of non propagating lagrange multipliers we lift the lagrange d alembert formalism off this submanifold by encoding this dynamical information into superstructure in the form of a certain distribution the noether current ba gives rise to the action of the abelian group k of reparametrisations of the lagrange multiplier onm lb let k be the lie algebra of k and a a 1 dimg be a basis for k the hamiltonian vector field corresponding to the hamiltonian form j a ba is x ba a this hamiltonian vector field pushes forward via the surjection lb to a vector field corresponding to the lie algebra element a giving rise to bundle automorphisms of the extended config uration bundle lb the g action on thus extendeds to a g k action on lb let lb a lb a a and lb a denote the prolongation of e from to lb the lb a and lb a span a subspace of the tangent space of lb at x u we therefore have a distribution over lb namely s lb x u lb s lb x u 21 where s lb x u lb a x u lb a x u 16 s p hrabak proposition 4 1 s lb is an integrable distribution over lb proof let x y s lb in local coordinates they take the form x xa 1 lb a xa 2 lb and y

detail the structures of the extended graded bundles which we shall advo cate as the starting point of a multisymplectic and therefore covariant hamiltonian formulation of the classical bfv framework we begin by defining the appropriate configuration bundle once we have this definition the extended graded multiphase space and the extended graded configuration phase space follow c f 6 the diagram below illustrates the construction and defines the various surjections s lb l s lb l lb le lb g gg gg gg gg le lb zzuu uu uu uu uu b definition 4 2 the extended graded configuration bundle lb is the triple s lb lb b one can show that one may extend the local adapted coordinates on to lb which is then endowed with local adapted coordinates x ui a a a where the new coordinate a is grassmann odd we call a the antighost corresponding to the noether current ba this correspondence is made concrete by virtue of the above construction the first jet bundle of lb namely j 1 lb has 1 jets which in local coordinates take the form j 1 u x x ui a a a ui a a a the surjective submersion 0 lb is defined by the commutivity of the following diagram to be 0 lb lb 0 lb 1 where 0 lb 1 is the surjection mapping each one jet onto its source j 1 lb 0 lb 0 lb 1 s lb lb xxrr rr rr rr rr r b let n lb even be the subbundle of the nth exterior cotangent bundle over lb whose sections are grassmann even n forms on lb the affine dual j 1 lb of the first jet bundle is defined by the following short exact sequence 0 n 0 lb even i n lb even lb j 1 lb 0 let s l n lb even s l may be endowed with local adapted coordinates x ui a a a p i b a p a c a the commuting diagram below defines the sur jective submersions lb 0 lb 1 lb lb lb lb 0 lb on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 17 lb

point is as before to notice that the group action by bundle morphisms on the extended configuration bundle lifts to a certain grassmann odd bundle morphism on the extended graded configuration bundle the corresponding grassmann odd vector field commutes and in the local adapted coordinates takes the form v lb a ea 1 2 c c ab a b c a a 24 the lifted momentum observable corresponding to the vector field v lb is defined by l 1 lb 0 v lb lb where lb s l are n forms on lb in terms of the local adapted coordinates on s l the lifted momentum observable takes the form l 1 2 cabc b cpa a a aba we pull back l by virtue of the section determined by p h to obtain l h on j 1 lb lb h l h is the brst n 1 form noether current of the covariant hamiltonian bfv formalism expounded above by a simple calculation c f proposition 3 2 the brst n 1 form l h generates via its left poisson leibniz action a nilpotent generalised multisymplectomorphism of j 1 lb lb h the analogue of the algebra a of the graded formalism is al a c d 25 where c is the vector space with the basis ba a 1 dimg of grassmann even n 1 forms and d is the vector space with basis ca a 1 dimg of grassmann odd n 1 forms the brst homology of the extended graded formalism is defined to be h l h al then by virtue of the ku nneth formula one has h p l h al m n p hm h a h n aba c d 26 the differential graded complex c d aba forms a koszul com plex and the homology is therefore found to be hn aba c d 0 for all n 0 r for n 0 27 we thus learn that in particularh 0 l h al h h 0 a and therefore that the brst homology in the extended graded framework is isomorphic to the poisson leibniz algebra of observables on the reduced multisymplectic manifold on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 19 5 an illustration of the covariant hamiltonian bfv formalism an application yang mills field theory in this section we shall illustrate via application the covariant bfv hamiltonian formalism developed above to yang mills field theory on minkowski space time the principle particle physics exemplar of a constrained classical field theory the novelty in our covariant hamiltonian approach is that the resulting brst algebra is polynomial in the canonical variables unlike the non covariant approach where one finds the algebra to include spatial derivatives of the canonical variables in 10 the authors study the brst symmetry of the yang mills theory from the view point of the poincare cartan form on jet bundles that is in the configuration phase space approach the presence of the derivative term in the usual brst algebra leads them to suggest that the brst symmetry should be formulated in a manner such that it preserves the poincare cartan form only up to contact terms in our approach the brst symmetry is a multisymplectomorphism in order to present the brst algebra in a form close to the usual formalism we must use here kanatchikov s formalism 6 3 this is because the usual presenta tion of the application of the brst formalism to examples is in terms of the poisson bracket formulation that is in terms of the adjoint action of the brst observable on the canonical coordinates and momenta in comparing our formulation in the context of particular examples one must therefore use the vertical covariant phase space formulation of kanatchikov we begin by defining the configuration bundle for yang mills we shall treat the connection defining the field of yang mills as a lie algebra valued 1 form on minkowski space time the configuration bundle for yang mills ym is g 1 t m ym m aa let eym denote the total space of the configuration bundle for yang mills the first jet bundle for ym has in local coordinates 1 jets of the form j 1 xa x x aa a a let z 4 1 e ym

multisymplectic manifold the dual of the first jet bundle is defined by the following short exact sequence 0 10 e ym z j 1 ym 0 let j 1 ym vym be the corresponding vertical configuration bundle see 6 3 in the local adapted coordinates the vertical cartan 4 form has the form vym a da a d 3 x modulo semi basic 4 forms 30 and the corresponding vertical cartan 5 form has the form vym da a d a d 3 x 31 20 s p hrabak modulo the image of semi basic 4 forms under the exterior differential z is too large to be the multiphase space for yang mills the appropriate mul tiphase space is the submanifold of z identified as the image of the first jet bundle under the covariant legendre transformation 22 in order to construct the co variant legendre transformation we will need the yang mills functional s j 1 xa x namely s j 1 xa x 1 4 m 4 fd f d 32 where fd a a a a f a bca b a c the covariant legendre transformations is 22 p i l vi p l l vi vi i where i is a connection for yang mills we define a a 1 2

equation 33 explicitly t a a f a d n 1 x 0 the constraints constrain the multi momenta a to be antisymmetric in the greek indices that is t a 0 a a 0 this defines a submanifold of z which we shall denote by zt the multiphase space of yang mills is the pair zt t where t is the pull back of z by the canonical embedding map of zt into z the local adapted coordinates are x aa f a p and the cartan 5 form has the local coordinate expression t dp d 4 x daa df a d 3 x 35 the corresponding sub manifold of the dual jet bundle is defined by the following short exact sequence 0 10 e ym zt j 1 ym t 0 one may observe that the primary constraints t a a f a d n 1 x 0 generate an abelian lie algebra on j 1 ym t v tym the vertical cartan 5 form takes the following form in terms of the local adapted coordinates v tym da a d a d 3 x 36 solving the multisymplectic structural equation for the hamiltonian vector field x t a corresponding to the momentum observable t a one finds x t a aa 2 fabca c a finally computing the brackets one finds x t a x t b v tym 2 fabc facb a c d n 1 x this vanishes by virtue of the anti symmetry of fabc and the algebra is thus seen to be abelian the pair j 1 ym t ym hym is the covariant phase space of yang mills where ym hym is the pull back of t by the section p hym j 1 ym zt determined by the covariant legendre transformation 34 the cartan 5 form ym hym in the

is determined by the covariant legendre transformation 34 to be hym 1 4 fd f d then 41 sa fabca b f c d n 1 x 0 we see that the sa generate the lie algebra g simply by computing the brackets whence one finds that x s a x s b v t ym f c absc 42 where x s a is the solution of the multisymplectic structural equation explicitly x s a faefa e a f faeff f f e 43 by virtue of the requirement that the hamiltonian evolution should preserve the constraints we thus find that there exits secondary first class constraints sa fabca b f c d 3 x which generate the group action by multisymplectomorphisms on

formalism for first order field theories in this appendix we shall briefly detail the multisymplectic framework for first order field theories see 22 4 5 12 for more details 6 1 the covariant phase space the fields of a classical field theory are sec tions of the configuration bundle e b where dimb n and dime m n e b vv for each x b two sections e b have first order contact at x if x x 47 x x txb 48 we denote the equivalence class of all sections with target x u and source x by j 1 x the set of all such equivalence classes is denoted j 1 ue and the total space of the first jet bundle is defined to be j 1 u e j 1 ue 49 it is a bundle over e and thus also b in fact i the bundle j 1 01 e is an affine bundle and ii the bundle j 1 0 b is a vector bundle if is a local section of e b the prolongation of is the section j 1 of j 1 01 e defined by j 1 x j 1 x in the adapted local coordinates j 1 x x i i the following diagram illustrates the various surjective submersions j 1 0 1 0 c cc cc cc c e b we now give a second characterisation of j 1 which we will find leads to a natural notion of a dual j 1 the vertical bundle v is the subbundle of the tangent bundle of whose fibres consist of the null space of the tangent projection the bundle j 1 01 e is the affine bundle modelled on the vector bundle v e t b let ne denote the bundle n t e e sections of this bundle are n forms 24 s p hrabak on e n e e ne let n 0 e be the bundle whose sections are in n 0 e n e 0 v the semi basic n forms and n 1 e be the bundle whose sections are in n 1 e n e 0 v the dual of j 1 j 1 is defined by the following following short exact sequence 0 n 0 e n 1 e j 1 0 by the identification of the affine maps from j 1 to r aff j 1 r with the space of n forms n 1 e and the constant affine maps from j 1 to r affconst j 1 r with the space of n forms n 0 e the short exact sequence identifies j 1 as a quotient of a bundle of n forms over e that is j 1 aff j 1 r affconst j 1 r let z n 1 e then in the local adapted bundle coordinates z has the generic form z pdnx p i dui d nx where pd nx n 0 e and d nx d nx one may therefore regard p p i as local fibre coordinates on n 1 e adapted to the fibration over e the local coordinates on j 1 01 e are therefore x ui p i n 1 e is endowed with a canonical n form in local coordinates it takes the form pdnx p i dui d nx this canonical n form is called the cartan n form and is an example of a multisymplectic potential let m n 1 e we call the pair m where d the multiphase space the n 1 form is called the cartan n 1 form m is an example of a multisymplectic manifold m 7 77 77 77 77 77 77 7 e c cc cc cc c j 1 0 1 oo 0 ww ww ww ww w b the above commuting diagram defines the surjective submersions 01 0 01 a hamiltonian h on j 1 is a local section of the bundle m 10 j 1 the cartan form on j 1 is obtained from that on m by pulling it back via the section h that is h h the pair j 1 h is called the covariant phase space and is a multisymplectic manifold a section j 1 j 1 b satisfies hamilton s equations if j 1 h 0 j 1 t j 1 for a local section h of the bundle m 10 j 1 given by p h x ui p i the covariant hamilton s equations take the form p i x h x ui p i ui ui x h x ui p i p i 50 6 2 covariant canonical transformation and hamiltonian group ac tions the following class of multisymplectomorphisms are the appropriate ones for studying the symmetries of field theories all gauge symmetries arise via the prolongation of automorphism of the configuration bundle to the covariant phase space this emphasises the role of a special class of n 1 forms called lifted momen tum observables on a multisymplectic formulation of the classical brst symmetry 25 a covariant canonical transformation m is a multisymplectomorphism of m such that m is a bundle morphism m m m covering a diffeomorphism b b b if e e e is a bundle morphism over a diffeomorphism b b b then its canonical lift to m is given by m z 1 e z m is the prolongation the bundle morphism from e to m let the lie group g act on m or e by the bundle morphisms of or over diffeomorphisms of b let b e m denote the transformations of b e m corresponding to this group action let b e m denote the vector fields associated with the lie algebra element g by virtue of this group action if the action m onm is the lift of an action e on e then g acts by special covariant transformations the multimomentum map defined by j z z m 1 e z is a covariant momentum mapping and is ad equivariant in the adapted local coordinates the lifted momentum observable takes the form z p i i p dn 1 x p i dui d nx and e i ui x 6 3 kanatchikov s poisson bracket formalism and the canonical ob servables there is no simple canonical object on j 1 corresponding to the mul tisymplectic potential onm we have seen that we may induce multisymplectic potentials on j 1 determining the section by virtue of which we pull back from m to j 1 by the covariant legendre transformation an alternative would be to consider modulo semi basic n forms which we denote as v in 14 i kanatchikov working with v introduces a set of canonical momentum observables with respect to these observables he is then able to give a poisson bracket formulation of the covariant hamiltonian equations analogous to the fa miliar formulation in classical mechanics in order to achieve this it is necessary to consider the cartan n form modulo semi basic n forms and we therefore work with v dui dp i d n x modulo im d n 0 e 51 we have therefore the multisymplectic manifold j 1 v which we shall call the vertical covariant phase space one is then able to introduce canonical momen tum observables ui u idn 1 x and pi p i d n 1 x which obey the canonical commutation relations uj pi pi u j j i d n 1 x 52 note that neither ui u idn 1 x nor pi p i d n 1 x are generically hamiltonian forms on j 1 h it is this fact which necessitates the introduction of v because the usual presentation of the application of the brst formalism to examples is in terms of the poisson bracket formulation that is in terms of the adjoint action of the brst observable on the canonical coordinates and momenta in comparing our formulation in the context of particular examples one must use the formulation of kanatchikov note however that theorem 20 is valid for the bi graded poisson leibniz algebra of observables based on either h j 1 h or h j 1 v acknowledgements the author would like to thank alice rogers for her encouragement with this article 26 s p hrabak references 1 f cantrijn some aspects
