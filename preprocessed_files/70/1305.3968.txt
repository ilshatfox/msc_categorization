accurate densities of states for disordered systems from free probability live free or diagonalize accurate densities of states for disordered systems from free probability live free or diagonalize matthew welborn jiahao chen and troy van voorhis department of chemistry massachusetts institute of technology 77 massachusetts avenue cambridge massachusetts 02139 usa we investigate how free probability allows us to approximate the density of states in tight binding models of disordered electronic systems extending our previous studies of the anderson model in one dimension with nearest neighbor interactions j chen et al phys rev lett 109 036403 2012 we find that free probability continues to provide accurate approximations for systems with constant interactions on two and three dimensional lattices or with next nearest neighbor interactions with the results being visually indistin guishable from the numerically exact solution for systems with disordered interactions we observe a small but visible degradation of the approximation to explain this behavior of the free approximation we develop and apply an asymptotic error analysis scheme to show that the approximation is accurate to the eighth moment in the density of states for systems with constant interactions but is only accurate to sixth order for systems with disordered interactions the error analysis also allows us to calculate asymptotic corrections to the density of states allowing for systematically improvable approximations as well as insight into the sources of error without requiring a direct comparison to an exact solution i introduction disordered matter is ubiquitous in nature and in manmade materials 1 random media such as glasses 2 4 disordered al loys 5 6 and disordered metals 7 9 exhibit unusual properties result ing from the unique physics produced by statistical fluctuations for example disordered materials often exhibit unusual elec tronic properties such as in the weakly bound electrons in metal ammonia solutions 10 12 or in water 13 14 paradoxically disorder can also enhance transport properties of excitons in new pho tovoltaic systems containing bulk heterojunction layers 15 17 and quantum dots 18 19 producing anomalous diffusion effects 20 22 which appear to contradict the expected effects of anderson lo calization 23 25 accounting for the effects of disorder in electro optic systems is therefore integral for accurately modeling and en gineering second generation photovoltaic devices 26 disordered systems are challenging for conventional quantum methods which were developed to calculate the electronic struc ture of systems with perfectly known crystal structures determin ing the electronic properties of a disordered material thus necessi tates explicit sampling of relevant structures from thermodynam ically accessible regions of the potential energy surface followed by quantum chemical calculations for each sample furthermore these materials lack long range order and must therefore be mod eled with large supercells to average over possible realizations of short range order and to minimize finite size effects these two factors conspire to amplify the cost of electronic structure calcu lations on disordered materials enormously to avoid such expensive computations we consider instead cal culations where the disorder is treated explicitly in the electronic hamiltonian the simplest such hamiltonian comes from the an derson model 23 27 which is a tight binding lattice model of the electronic structure of a disordered electronic medium despite its simplicity this model nonetheless captures the rich physics of strong localization and can be used to model the conductiv ity of disordered metals 24 25 however the anderson model can not be solved exactly except in special cases 28 29 which compli cates studies of its excitation and transport properties studying more complicated systems thus requires accurate efficiently com putable approximations for the experimental observables of inter est random matrix theory offers new possibilities for developing accurate approximate solutions to disordered systems 30 32 in this article we focus on using random matrix theory to con struct efficient approximations for the density of states of a ran dom medium the density of states is one of the most important quantities that characterize an electronic system and a large num ber of physical observables can be calculated from it 33 further more it only depends on the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian and is thus simpler to approximate as information about the eigen vectors is not needed we have previously shown that highly ac curate approximations can be constructed using free probability theory for the simplest possible anderson model i e on a one dimensional lattice with constant nearest neighbor interactions 34 however it remains to be seen if similar approximations are suf ficient to describe more complicated systems and in particular if the richer physics produced by more complicated lattices and by off diagonal disorder can be captured using such free probabilistic methods in this article we present a brief self contained introduction to free probability theory in section ii we then develop approxi mations from free probability theory in section iii that generalize our earlier study 34 in three ways first we develop analogous approximations for systems with long range interactions special izing to the simplest such extension of a one dimensional lattices with next nearest neighbor interactions second we study lattices in two and three dimensions we consider square and hexagonal two dimensional lattices to investigate the effect of coordination on the approximations third we also make the interactions ran dom and develop approximations for these systems as well these cases are summarized graphically in figure 1 and are represen tative of the diversity of disorder systems described above fi nally we introduce an asymptotic error analysis which allows us to quantify and analyze the errors in the free probability approxi mations in section iv ii free probability a free independence in this section we briefly introduce free probability by high lighting its parallels with classical probability theory one of the core ideas in probability theory 35 is how to characterize the relationship between two scalar valued random variables x and y they may be correlated so that the joint moment xy is not simply the product of the individual expectations x y or they may be correlated in a higher order moment i e there are some ar x iv 1 30 5 39 68 v 1 co nd m at d is n n 1 7 m ay 2 01 3 b free independence and the r transform iii numerical results figure 1 the lattices considered in this work a one dimensional chain with nearest neighbor interactions b one dimensional chain with many neighbors c two dimensional square lattice d two dimensional hexagonal honeycomb lattice e three dimensional cubic lattice and f one dimensional chain with disordered interactions smallest positive integers m and n for which xmyn 6 xm yn if neither case holds then they are said to be independent i e that all their joint moments of the form xmyn factorize into products of the form xmyn xm yn for random matrices similar state ments can be written down if the expectation is interpreted as the normalized expectation of the trace i e 1 netr where n is the size of the matrix however matrices in general do not commute and therefore this notion of independence is no longer unique for noncommuting random variables one cannot simply take a joint moment of the form am 1 bn 1 amk bnk and assert it to be equal in general to am 1 mk bn 1 nk the complica tions introduced by noncommutativity give rise to a different the ory known as free probability theory for noncommuting random variables 36 this theory introduces the notion of free indepen dence which is the noncommutative analogue of classical inde pendence specifically two noncommutative random variables a and b are said to be freely independent if for all positive integers m 1 mk n 1 nk the centered joint moment vanishes i e am 1 bn 1 amk bnk 0 1 where we have introduced the centering notation a a a this naturally generalizes the notion of classical independence to noncommuting variables as the former is equivalent to requiring that all the centered joint moments of the form xm yn vanish if the expectation a is reinterpreted as the normalized expecta tion of the trace of a random matrix a then the machinery of free independence can be applied directly to random matrices 37 b free independence and the r transform one of the central results of classical probability theory is that if x and y are independent random variables with distributions px x and py y respectively then the probability distribution of their sum x y is given by the convolution of the distributions i e 35 px y y px x py x y dx 2 an analogous result holds for freely independent noncommuting random variables and is known as the additive free convolution this is most conveniently defined using the r transform 36 38 39 for a probability density p x supported on a b its r transform r w is defined implicitly via g z lim 0 b a p x z x i dx 3 a r w g 1 w 1 w 3 b these quantities have natural analogues in green function the ory p x is the density of states i e the distribution of eigen values of the underlying random matrix g z is the cauchy transform of p x which is the retarded green function and g 1 w r w 1 w is the self energy the r transform al lows us to define the free convolution of a and b denoted a b by adding the individual r transforms ra b w ra w rb w 4 this finally allows to state that if a and b are freely independent then the sum a b must satisfy ra b w ra b w 5 in general random matrices a and b are neither classically in dependent nor freely independent however we can always con struct combinations of them that are always freely independent one such combination is a q bq where q is a random orthog onal unitary matrix of uniform haar measure as applied to real symmetric hermitian a and b 40 the similarity transform ef fected by q randomly rotates the basis of b so that the eigen vectors of a and b are always in generic position i e that any eigenvector of a is uncorrelated with any eigenvector of b 32 this is the main result that we wish to exploit while in general a and b are not freely independent and hence 5 fails to hold exactly we can nonetheless make the approximation that 5 holds approx imately and use this as a way to calculate the density of states of a random matrix h using only its decomposition into a matrix sum h a b our application of this idea to the anderson model is described below iii numerical results a computation of the density of states and its free approximant we now wish to apply the framework of free probability theory to study anderson models beyond the one dimensional nearest neighbor model which was the focus of our initial study 34 it is well known that more complicated anderson models exhibit rich physics that are absent in the simplest case first the one dimensional anderson hamiltonian with long range interactions has delocalized eigenstates at low energies and an asymmetric density of states features that are absent in the simplest ander son model 41 45 these long range interactions give rise to slowly decaying interactions in many systems such as spin glasses 3 46 and ionic liquids 47 second two dimensional lattices can exhibit weak localization 48 which is responsible for the unusual con ductivities of low temperature metal thin films 49 50 the hexag onal honeycomb lattice is of particular interest as a tight bind ing model for nanostructured carbon allotropes such as carbon nanotubes 51 and graphene 52 53 which exhibit novel electronic 2 iii numerical results a computation of the density of states and its free approximant phases with chirally tunable band gaps 54 55 and topological insula tion 56 57 third the anderson model in three dimensions exhibits nontrivial localization phases that are connected by the metal insulator transition 23 58 fourth systems with off diagonal dis order such as substitutional alloys and frenkel excitons in molec ular aggregates 1 59 exhibit rich physics such as localization tran sitions in lattices of any dimension 60 localization dependence on lattice geometry 61 van hove singularities 62 and asymmetries in the density of states 59 despite intense interest in the effects of off diagonal disorder such systems have resisted accurate model ing 63 71 we are therefore interested to find out if our approxima tions as developed in our initial study 34 can be applied also to all these disordered systems the anderson model can be represented in the site basis by the matrix with elements hi j gi i j ji j 6 where gi is the energy of site i i j is the usual kronecker delta and ji j is the matrix of interactions with jii 0 unless otherwise specified we further specialize to the case of constant interac tions between connected neighbors so that ji j jmi j where j is a scalar constant representing the interaction strength and m is the adjacency matrix of the underlying lattice unless specified otherwise we also apply vanishing dirichlet boundary condi tions as this reduces finite size fluctuations in the density of states relative to periodic boundary conditions for concrete numerical calculations we also choose the site energies gi to be iid gaussian random variables of variance 2 and mean 0 with these assump tions the strength of disorder in the system can be quantified by a single dimensionless parameter j the particular quantity we are interested in approximating is the density of states which is one of the most important descriptors of electronic band structure in condensed matter systems 33 it is defined as the distribution h x j x j 7 where j is the jth eigenvalue of a sample of h and the expectation is the ensemble average to apply the approximations from free probability theory we partition our hamiltonian matrix into its diagonal and off diagonal components a and b the density of states of a is sim ply a gaussian of mean 0 and variance 2 and for many of our cases studied below the density of states of b is proportional to the adjacency matrix of well known graphs 72 and hence is known analytically we then construct the free approximant h a qt bq 8 where q is a random orthogonal matrix of uniform haar mea sure as discussed in section ii b and find its density of states h specific samples of q can be generated by taking the orthogonal part of the qr decomposition 73 of matrix from the gaussian or thogonal ensemble goe 74 we then average the approximate density of states over many realizations of the hamiltonian and q and compare it to the ensemble averaged density of states gener ated from exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian we choose the number of samples to be sufficient to converge the density of states with respect to the disorder in the hamiltonian while this is not the most efficient way of computing free convolutions it provides a general and robust test for the quality of the free ap proximation the free approximant can be computed efficiently using numerical free convolution techniques 75 b one dimensional chain we now proceed to apply the theory of the previous section to specific examples of the anderson model on various lattices previously we had studied the anderson model on the one dimensional chain 34 hi j gi i j j i j 1 i j 1 9 which is arguably the simplest model of a disordered system de spite its simple tridiagonal form this hamiltonian does not have an exact solution for its density of states and many approxima tions for it have been developed 76 however unlike the original hamiltonian the diagonal and off diagonal components each have a known density of states when considered separately to calcu late the density of states of the hamiltonian we diagonalized 1000 samples of 1000 1000 matrices so that the resulting density of states is converged with respect to both disorder and finite size effects the results are shown in figure 2 a demonstrating that the free approximation to the density of states is visually indistin guishable from the exact result over all the entire possible range of disorder strength j c one dimensional lattice with non neighbor interactions going beyond tridiagonal hamiltonians we next study the an derson model on a one dimensional chain with constant interac tions to n neighbors the hamiltonian then takes the form h 1 di j gi i j j n k 1 i j k i k j 10 where we use the superscript to distinguish the one dimensional many neighbor hamiltonian from its higher dimensional analogs unlike the nearest neighbor interaction case above the density of states is known to exhibit van hove singularities at all but the strongest disorder 1 24 we average over 1000 samples of 1000 1000 hamiltonians which as before ensures that the density of states is numerically converged with respect to statistical fluctuations and finite size ef fects we looked at the case of n 2 6 neighbors with identical interaction strengths and also interaction strengths that decayed linearly with distance to better model the decay of interactions with distance in more realistic systems the free approximant is of similar quality in all cases as shown in figure 2 b for n 4 neighbors the free approximant reproduces these singular features of the density of states unlike perturbative methods which are known to smooth them out 77 78 the reproduction of singulari ties by the free approximant parallels similar observations found in other applications of free probability to quantum information theory 79 d square hexagonal and cubic lattices we now investigate the effect of dimensionality on the accuracy of the free approximant in three lattices first we consider the anderson model on the square lattice with hamiltonian h 2 d b 1 d i i b 1 d a 11 3 d square hexagonal and cubic lattices iii numerical results figure 2 comparison of exact density of states lines with free probability approximant circles for the lattices in figure 1 with b showing the case of n 4 neighbors data are shown for multiple values of a dimensionless parameter quantifying the strength of disorder to show the robustness of this approximation for a e this parameter is j the ratio of the noisiness of diagonal elements to the strength of off diagonal interaction in f the axis is chosen to be the relative strength of off diagonal disorder to diagonal disorder with j 1 10 0 10 0 1 1 10 x j 10 0 10 0 1 1 10 x j 10 0 10 0 1 1 10 x j 10 0 10 0 1 1 10 x j 10 0 10 0 1 1 10 x j 10 0 10 0 1 1 10 x a b c d e f x x where b 1 d is the off diagonal part of the h 1 d defined in equa tion 10 i is the identity matrix with the same dimensions as b 1 d a is the diagonal matrix of independent random site ener gies of appropriate dimension and is the kronecker direct product we have found that a square lattice of 50 50 2500 sites is the smallest lattice with negligible finite size fluctuations in the density of states as such we calculated the density of states for 500 samples of 3600 3600 hamiltonians we find that for both nearest neighbors shown in figure 2 c and non nearest neighbors specifically n 2 6 the free approxima tion is again visually identical to the exact answer second we consider the honeycomb hexagonal lattice which has a lower coordination number than the square lattice its adjacency matrix does not have a simple closed form but can nonetheless be easily generated for this lattice we averaged over 1000 samples of matrices of size 968 968 and applied periodic boundary conditions to illustrate their effect as in the square case of the two dimensional grid model the density of states of the hon eycomb lattice with any number of coupled neighbor shells is well reproduced by the free approximant figure 2 d even reproduc ing the van hove singularities at low to moderate site disorder additionally we see that the finite size oscillations at low disor der j 0 1 are also reproduced by the free approximation third we consider the anderson model on a cubic lattice whose hamiltonian is h 3 d b 1 d i i i b 1 d i i i b 1 d a 12 figure 2 e shows the approximate and exact density of states cal culated from 1000 samples of 1000 1000 matrices this rep resents a 10 10 10 cubic lattice which is significantly smaller in linear dimension than the previously considered lattices we therefore observed oscillatory features in the density of states aris ing from finite size effects despite this the free approximant is still able to reproduce the exact density of states quantitatively in fact if the histogram in figure 2 e is recomputed with finer his togram bins to emphasize the finite size induced oscillations we still observe that the free approximant reproduces these features e off diagonal disorder up to this point all of the models we have considered have only site disorder with no off diagonal disorder free probability has thus far provided a qualitatively correct approximation for all these lattices to test the robustness of this approximation we now investigate systems with random interactions the simplest such system is the one dimensional chain with a hamiltonian of the form hi j gi i j hi i j 1 i j 1 13 unlike in the previous systems the interactions are no longer con stant but are instead new random variables hi we choose them to be gaussians of mean j and variance 2 there are now two order parameters to consider j the relative disorder in the interaction strengths and the strength of off diagonal disorder relative to site disorder as in the prior one dimensional case we average over 1000 realizations of 1000 1000 matrices we now observe that the quality of the free approximation is no longer uniform across all values of the order parameters instead it varies with but not j in figure 2 f we demonstrate the results of varying with j 1 in the limits 1 and 1 the free approximation matches the exact result well however there is a small but noticeable discrepancy between the exact and approximate density of states for moderate relative off diagonal disorder though the quality of the approximation is 4 iv error analysis mostly unaffected by the centering of the off diagonal disorder in the next section we will investigate the nontrivial behavior of the approximation with the order parameter iv error analysis in our numerical experiments we have found that the accuracy of the free approximation remains excellent for systems with only site disorder regardless of the underlying lattice topology or the number of interactions that each site has details such as finite size oscillations and van hove singularities are also captured when present however when off diagonal disorder is present the quality of the approximation does vary qualitatively with the ratio of off diagonal disorder to site disorder as illustrated in section iii e and the error is greatest when to un derstand the reliability of the free approximant 8 in all these sit uations we apply an asymptotic moment expansion to calculate the leading order error terms for the various systems in general a probability density can be expanded with respect to another probability density in an asymptotic moment expansion known as the edgeworth series 80 81 x exp m 1 m m m d dx m x 14 where m is the mth cumulant of and m is the mth cumulant of when all the cumulants exist and are finite this is an exact relation that allows for the distribution to be systematically cor rected to become by substituting in the correct cumulants if the first n 1 cumulants of and match but not the nth then we can calculate the leading order asymptotic correction to as x exp n n n d dx n x 15 a 1 n n n d dx n x 15 b x 1 n n n n dn dxn x o dn 1 dxn 1 15 c x 1 n n n n dn dxn x o dn 1 dxn 1 15 d where on the second line we expanded the exponential ex 1 x and on the fourth line we used the well known re lationship between cumulants and moments and the fact that the first n 1 moments of and were identical by assumption we can now use this expansion to calculate the leading order difference between the exact density of states h a b and its free approximant h a b by setting h and h in 15 d the only additional data required are the moments n h h n and n h h n which can be computed from the sampled data or recursively from the joint moments of a and b as detailed elsewhere 80 this then gives us a way to detect dis crepancies which is to calculate successively higher moments of h and h to determine whether the difference in moments is sta tistically significant and then for the smallest order moment that differs calculate the correction using 15 d the error analysis also yields detailed information about the source of error in the free approximation the nth moment of h is given by n h h n a b n m 1 n 1 mk nk k j 1 m j n j n am 1 bn 1 amk bnk 16 where the last equality arises from expanding a b n in a non commutative binomial series if a and b are freely independent then each of these terms must satisfy recurrence relations that can be derived from the definition 1 80 exhaustively enumerating and examining each of the terms in the final sum to see if they satisfy 1 thus provides detailed information about the accuracy of the free approximation we now apply this general error analysis for the specific sys tems we have studied it turns out that the results for systems with and without off diagonal disorder exhibit different errors and so are presented separately below a systems with constant interactions we have previously shown that for the one dimensional chain with nearest neighbor interactions the free approximant is exact in the first seven moments and that the only term in the eighth moment that differs between the free approximant and the exact h is ab 4 34 the value of this joint moment can be understood in terms of discretized hopping paths on the lattice 30 writing out the term ab 4 explicitly in terms of matrix elements and with einstein s implicit summation convention gives ab 4 1 n e ai 1 i 2 bi 2 i 3 ai 3 i 4 bi 4 i 5 ai 5 i 6 bi 6 i 7 ai 7 i 8 bi 8 i 1 17 a 1 n e gi 1 i 1 i 2 jmi 2 i 3 gi 3 i 3 i 4 jmi 4 i 5 gi 5 i 5 i 6 jmi 6 i 7 gi 7 i 7 i 8 jmi 8 i 1 17 b 1 n e gi 1 gi 2 gi 3 gi 4 j 4 mi 1 i 2 mi 2 i 3 mi 3 i 4 mi 4 i 1 17 c from this calculation we can see that each multiplication by a weights each path by the site energy of a given site gi and each multiplication by b weights the path by j and causes the path to 5 a systems with constant interactions iv error analysis hop to a coupled site the sum therefore reduces to a weighted sum over returning paths on the lattice that must traverse exactly three intermediate sites the only paths on the lattice with nearest neighbors that satisfy these constraints are shown in figure 3 a namely i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 k k 1 k k 1 k k 1 k 2 k 1 k k 1 k k 1 and k k 1 k 2 k 1 for some starting site k the first path contributes weight e g 2 kg 2 k 1 j 4 e g 2 k e g 2 k 1 j 4 4 j 4 while the second term has weight e gkg 2 k 1 gk 2 j 4 e gk e g 2 k 1 e gk 2 j 4 0 similarly the third and fourth paths also have weight 4 j 4 and 0 respec tively finally averaging over all possible starting sites we ar rive at the final result that ab 4 2 4 j 4 with periodic bound ary conditions and ab 4 2 1 1 n 4 j 4 with vanishing boundary conditions we therefore see when n is sufficiently large the boundary conditions contribute a term of o 1 n which can be discarded thus showing the universality of this result re gardless of the boundary conditions figure 3 a diagrammatic representation of the four paths that con tribute to the leading order error for the case of a two dimensional square lattice with constant interactions and nearest neighbors dots contribute a factor of gi for site i solid arrows represent a factor of j each path contributes j 4 g 2 a g 2 b 4 j 4 to the error b build up of the diagram matic representation the leading order error in the case of a 1 d chain with off diagonal disorder the two dashed arrows contribute a factor of 4 22 because of the disorder in the interactions multiplication by b 2 allows loops back to the same site the first of these loops ab 2 has zero expectation value because it contains an independent random vari able of mean zero as a factor once two loops are present the expectation value instead contains this random variable squared which has nonzero expectation value applying the preceding error analysis we observe that the re sult from the one dimensional chain generalizes all the other sys tems with constant interactions that we have studied the only dif ference being that the coefficient 2 is simply replaced by n the number of sites accessible in a single hop from a given lattice site in order to keep the effective interaction felt by a site constant as we scale n we can choose j to scale as 1 n in this case the free approximation converges to the exact result as 1 n we can generalize the argument presented above to explain why ab 4 is the first nonzero joint centered moment and thus why the approximation does not break down before the eighth moment consider centered joint moments of the form aa 1 bb 1 aa 2 bb 2 aanbbn 18 for positive integers ai bi such that i ai bi 8 since a is diagonal with iid elements all powers of an are also diagonal with iid elements and so an 0 centered higher powers of b bn couple each site to other sites with interaction strengths jn but after centering the diagonal elements of bn are zero and mul tiplication by bn still represents a hop from one site to a different coupled site therefore the lowest order nonzero joint centered moment requires at least four hops so n 4 is the smallest pos sible nonzero term but but the only term of this form of eighth order or lower is the one with ai bi 1 i e the term ab 4 b random interactions when the off diagonal interactions are allowed to fluctuate the free approximation breaks down in the sixth moment where the joint centered moment ab 2 2 fails to vanish we can un derstand this using a generalization of the hopping explanation from before in this case b 2 contains nonzero diagonal elements which corresponds to a nonzero weight for paths that stay at the same site thus ab 2 2 contains a path of nonzero weight that starts at a site and loops back to that site twice shown in fig ure 3 b the overall difference in the moment of the exact dis tribution from that in the free distribution is 2 2 4 22 where 4 and 2 are the fourth and second moments of the off diagonal disorder as above the 2 component of this difference can be understood as the contribution of the two as in the joint centered moment the other factor 2 4 22 is the weight of the path of two consecutive self loops the sixth moment is the first to break down because as before we must hop to each node on our path twice in order to avoid multiplying by the expectation value of mean zero and ab 2 2 is the lowest order term that allows such a path we summarize the the leading order corrections and errors in table i at this point we introduce the quantity j 2 nj which is an aggregate measure of the interactions of any site with all its 2 n neighbors as can be seen the discrepancy occurs to eighth order for all the studied systems with constant interactions with a numerical prefactor indicative of the coordination number of the lattice and the factor of 1 8 strongly suppresses the contribution of the error terms furthermore for any given value of the total in teraction j the error decreases quickly with coordination number 2 n suggesting that the free probability approximation is exact in the mean field limit of 2 n neighbors this is consistent with previous studies of the anderson model employing the coherent potential approximation 24 82 83 in contrast the system with off diagonal disorder has a discrepancy in the sixth moment which has a larger coefficient in the edgeworth expansion 15 d this explains the correspondingly poorer performance of our free ap proximation for systems with off diagonal disorder furthermore the preceding analysis shows that only the first and second mo ments of the diagonal disorder contribute to the correction co 6 v

which can be constructed by partitioning the hamiltonian into two easily diagonalizable en sembles and then free convolving their densities of states previ ous work 34 showed that this approximation worked well for the one dimensional anderson model partitioned into its diagonal and off diagonal components our numerical and theoretical study de scribed above demonstrates that the same approximation scheme is widely applicable to a diverse range of systems encompassing more complex lattices and more interactions beyond the nearest neighbor the quality of the approximation remains unchanged regardless of the lattice as long as the interactions are constant with the free approximation being in error only in the eighth mo ment of the density of states when the interactions fluctuate the quality of the approximation worsens but remains exact in the first five moments of the density of states our results strongly suggest that free probability has the po tential to produce high quality approximations for the properties of disordered systems in particular our theoretical analysis of the errors reveals universal features of the quality of the approx imation with the error being characterized entirely by the mo ments of the relevant fluctuations and the local topology of the lattice this gives us confidence that approximations constructed using free probability will give us high quality results with rigor ous error quantification this also paves the way for future inves tigations for constructing fast free convolutions using numerical methods for r transforms 75 which would yield much faster meth ods for constructing free approximations additionally further studies will be required to approximate other observables of inter est such as conductivities and phase transition points these will require further theoretical investigation into how free probability can help predict properties of eigenvectors which may involve generalizing some promising initial studies linking the statistics of eigenvectors such as their inverse participation ratios to eigen value statistics such as the spectral compressibility 84 85 acknowledgements this work was funded by
