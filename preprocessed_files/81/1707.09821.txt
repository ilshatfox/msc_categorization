abstract the non selective and selective measurements of a self adjoint observable a in quantum mechan ics are interpreted as jumps of the state of the measured system into a decohered or pure state respectively characterized by the spectral projections of a however one may try to describe the measurement results as asymptotic states of a dynamical process where the non unitarity of time evolution arises as an effective description of the interaction of the measured system with the mea suring device the dynamics we present is a two step dynamics the first step is the non selective measurement or decoherence which is known to be described by the linear deterministic lindblad equation the second step is a process from the resulted decohered state to a pure state which is described by an effective non linear randomly chosen toy model dynamics the pure states arise as asymptotic fixed points and their emergent probabilities are the relative volumes of their attractor regions key words quantum mechanics measurement theory decoherence and collapse of quantum states non linear dynamics 1 introduction in quantum mechanics a selective measurement wz of a physical

maximal abelian subalgebra in mn iff the spectrum of a is non degenerate i e only minimal orthogonal projections occur in the spectral decomposition of a in this case the resulted state a on mn is always pure for example selective measurements of observables with infinite or finite dimensional abelian alge bras a are the position measurement of an electron on a screen in a double slit experiment or the measurement of the spin component of an electron along a chosen axis in the stern gerlach experiment respectively a non selective measurement of a self adjoint observable a a a apa

commutant a mn of a since a is abelian it is contained in the image of a a a equality holds iff a is a maximal abelian subalgebra of mn it is a natural attempt to replace these measurement jumps of quantum states by a very fast dynamical process however there are objections to do this within the frame of usual time evolution in quantum theories although the mn mn maps a and a in 2 and 3 respectively are completely positive cp maps a is even unit preserving they are not rank preserving in general therefore they destroy any unitary heisenberg time evolution even those with explicit time dependence on the operators in mn because they cannot be written as b 7 ubu i e by an adjoint map with a unitary u mn thus the question is whether these measurement jumps could be obtained as asymptotic states of a non unitary deterministic or stochastic dynamical process the non unitarity of the underlying time evolution may arise as an effective description of the interaction with the measuring device or may be thought as the true fundamental dynamics of a quantum process of measurements the results of non selective measurements are known to be described by asymptotic states of a de terministic linear lindblad dynamics l see e g ban w the generator of this non unitary heisenberg time evolution is the generator of a semigroup of unit preserving completely positive cp 1 maps on

ge 1 tam s geszti see also ge 2 raised the possibility of a non linear dynamics where the outcomes of selective measurements would arise as asymptotic fixed points and their emergent probabilities would be the relative volumes of their attractor regions we present here a simple effective model of such a dynamics on the convex set of density matrices in finite dimensional hilbert spaces the model is a two step description of selective measurements of a self adjoint observable a mn where the non unitarity of time evolutions in both steps are thought to be effective descriptions of the interaction of the measured subsystem with the measuring device the first step is a cp 1 time evolution given by a linear deterministic lindblad dynamics l which leads to a decohered asymptotic density matrices the second step is a non linear dynamics on a decohered density matrices the possible emergence of an effective non linear dynamics from a unitary one can be supported by recent results the gross pitaevskii non linear one particle effective dynamics gr pit can be derived from the unitary time evolution of the bose einstein condensation if the number of particles tends to infinity ls esy here the prescribed non linear deterministic dynamics leads to an a pure density matrix from the a decohered one however this dynamics contains a randomly chosen initial parameter namely an external or trial a decohered density matrix ext the choice of ext that is the choice of the second step effective dynamics is thought to reflect the unknown initial state of the full system measured system and the measuring device within the inverse image of the prepared initial 2 state 0 of the measured system because any effective dynamics on the measured subsystem depends on the state of the full system due to the presence of the interaction with the measuring device fixing ext the second step non linear deterministic dynamics leads to an asymptotic fixed point which is an a pure density matrix pa a a that is a spectral projection of the measured observable a the non linear dynamics reproduces the born rule repeated experiments with identically prepared initial state 0 of the measured system but with a random choice of ext from the uniformly distributed external density matrices lead to the probability relative frequency tr 0 pa of the possible asymptotic states pa a a the outline of the paper is as follows in chapter 2 we briefly describe two types of effective non unitary dynamics known in quantum theory which have motivated the two different dynamics used in our two step effective description of selective measurements first we discuss the effective dynamics given by a semigroup of cp 1 maps and present the general form of the generator called lindblad generator then we cite the results how the non linear gross pitaevskii dynamics arises in a rigorous way as the one particle effective description of bose einstein condensation when the number of particles tends to infinity in chapter 3 we present our two step toy model for selective measurements of a self adjoint observable a mn for completeness we prove a proposition based on known results about the necessary and sufficient conditions on asymptotic decoherence of density matrices in a lindblad dynamics then we present our ext dependent non linear deterministic effective dynamics on decohered density matrices and prove a theorem the stable fixed points of this dynamics are a pure the measures of their attractor regions with uniformly distributed ext are equal to the expectation values of the corresponding fixed point spectral projections of a in the initial state of the first step lindblad dynamics chapter 4 contains some closing remarks 2 two types of effective dynamics in quantum theory since we do not want to modify the fundamental unitary dynamics of quantum theories we have to look for effective non unitary dynamics for the description of selective measurements that arise from restrictions of unitary dynamics on infinitely large system to small finite subsystems examples for effective non unitary dynamics exist of course a large class of linear deterministic non unitary dynamics is given by semigroups of unit preserving completely positive cp 1 maps the second type of non unitary dynamics we discuss shortly is a non linear schr dinger equation connected to a particular model it is the one particle effective non linear dynamics of the bose einstein condensation the gross pitaevskii dynamics 2 1 the semigroup of unit preserving completely positive maps completely positive maps have a natural relationship with subsystems in quantum theory already its definition refers to the embeddings of the operator algebra b h into b h mn n n as a subsystem tensor product factor the following two statements l reinforce this relationship 1 if the group ut t r of unitaries in b h 1 b h 2 describe a heisenberg time evolution on b h 1 b h 2 then for any density matrix 2 b h 2 1 the map b h 1 a 7 t a tr 2 11 2 u t a 12 ut b h 1 4 is a cp 1 map for any time t r where 1 i b hi denotes the unit operator i 1 2 thus one can consider an effective cp 1 dynamics on the subsystem b h 1 instead of the unitary one the inverse result is that any cp 1 map of a subsystem arises as a restriction of a unitary sandwiching of an extended system 2 if is a weakly continuous cp 1 map on b h 1 then there exists a hilbert space h 2 and a v isometry on h 1 h 2 such that for any density matrix 2 b h 2 1 the following equality holds a tr 2 11 2 v a 12 v a b h 1 5 3 v can be extended to a unitary element by allowing a 2 dependent extension of h 2 of course the maps t t 0 in 4 do not form a semigroup t s 6 t s in general it is a further markovian type assumption that an effective dynamics can be described by a semigroup of cp 1 maps gks l an important benefit of this assumption is that the generator l of this semigroup can be completely characterized let l b h b h be a bounded map with l 1 0 then exp tl t 0 are unit preserving weakly continuous cp maps iff l is given by l b i h b k v k bvk 1 2 v k vk b b b h 6 where h h vk k v k vk b h and denotes the anti commutator clearly this heisenberg type time evolution can be translated to a schr dinger type of evolution of a given state on b h by defining the generator l l in case of a normal state given by the density matrix b h 1 this leads to the lindblad equation d dt l i h k vk v k 1 2 v k vk 7 which generalizes the schr dinger equation containing only the self adjoint hamiltonian h in the right hand side of 7 the property l 1 0 implies unit preserving property of the maps t exp tl t 0 which is translated to the trace preserving property of the maps t exp tl which remain cp on b h but they are not necessarily unit preserving it is known that the results of non selective measurements can be described as asymptotic states of a lindblad dynamics 7 by suitably chosen lindblad operators h vk which is described in the next chapter 2 2 the effective non linear gross pitaevskii dynamics the trapped interacting n boson hamiltonian in three dimensions is given by h trap n n j 1 rj vext rj n i j vn ri rj 8 on the symmetrized n fold tensor product hilbert space h n s with h l 2 r 3 the potential vext which is responsible for trapping has the property 0 vext r r the pair interactions are described by the n rescaled potential 0 vn r n 2 v nr where v is a spherically symmetric positive compactly supported smooth potential with scattering length a 0 the conjectured effective one particle description gr pit is given by the non linear gross pitaevskii equation and energy functional egp on the one particle hilbert space h i t t t 8 a 0 t 2 t t h 1 9 egp d 3 r r 2 vext r r 2 4 a 0 r 4 1 10 bose einstein condensation in the ground state of h trap n 8 was proved by lieb and seiringer ls their result reveals the precise connection to the effective gp description let n be the ground state of h trap n and let n n 1 n n be its n particle reduced density matrix let gp be the minimizer of the gp energy functional 10 then for any fixed n lim n n n gp gp n 11 4 one can ask what happens with the be condensed state n if the trap is removed that is when the evolution of the system is described by the hamiltonian hn n j 1 rj n i j vn ri rj 12 an exact connection between the unitary dynamics of the be condensation and the effective non linear hence non unitary one particle gp dynamics was given by erd s schlein and yau esy let n t be the solution of the schr dinger equation i t n t hn n t with initial condition n 0 n and let 1 n t be its one particle reduced density matrix let t be the solution of the gp equation 9 with initial condition 0 gp then for any t 0 1 n t t t n 13 pointwise for compact operators on h this important result allows us to conclude that a given unitary dynamics on a full system thought to be the measured subsystem plus the measuring device may lead to a non linear effective dynamics on a small subsystem thought to be the measured subsystem i e the abelian subalgebra generated by the measured self adjoint observable if the full system is large enough compared to the subsystem 2 3 dependence of the effective dynamics on the initial state of the full sys tem in this subsection we would like to highlight the fact that the emerging effective cp or non linear dynamics on the subsystem launched from identical initial states may depend on the possible different initial states of the full system due to the presence of interactions the dependence of effective cp dynamics on the initial density matrix of the full system within the inverse image of the initial density matrix of the subsystem is clear consider the cp dynamics 4 in the schr dinger picture t 12 1 tr 2 ut 12 u t b h 1 1 t 0 14 where 1 tr 2 12 is the initial density matrix in the subsystem b h 1 and 12 is one of the initial density matrices in the full system b h 1 h 2 within the inverse image of 1 tr 12 1 b h 1 h 2 1 tr 2 1 15 clearly the effective time evolution 14 of 1 heavily depends on the choice of the initial density matrix from tr 12 1 if ut is different on the b h 1 blocks within b h 1 h 2 that is if ut is not a product of unitary elements from b h 1 and b h 2 the initial state dependence of the effective non linear one particle dynamics in be condensation is less obvious due to the large n limit procedure involved in the light of the two theorems about be condensation above one can say the following the initial one particle gp density matrix gp gp gp on h leads to a sequence of inverse image sets r 1 n gp of density matrices on h n s n n where rn denotes the one particle reduced density matrix map from b h ns 1 to b h 1 since 1 n rn n n 11 implies that the sequence of ground state density matrices n n of htrapn on h n s n n approaches the inverse image set sequence r 1 n gp n n for large n moreover choosing n n n n as a particular initial state sequence with unitary dynamics hn 12 on h n s n n the non linear gp dynamics emerges in the large n limit as the effective one particle dynamics on h due to 13 since any initial density matrix sequences from the sequence of inverse image sets r 1 n gp n n lead to a constant one particle reduced density matrix sequence namely gp by definition one conjectures that clever choices from such initial density matrix sequences subject 5 to the unitary dynamics hn n n 12 lead to one particle effective dynamics in the large n limit different from the gp dynamics although there is no real hope to verify this guess we think that similarly to effective cp dynamics the emerging effective non linear dynamics involving large n limits depend on the choice of the initial state of the full system within the inverse image of the prescribed initial state of the subsystem keeping this dependence in mind one can perform repeated runs of a given unitary dynamics on the full system with fixed initial condition 1 b h 1 1 on the subsystem but with a random choice of initial condition tr 12 1 on the full system with respect to a probability distribution on the inverse image set tr 12 1 according to the considerations above these repeated runs will lead to a probability distribution on the different effective dynamics of the subsystem through relative frequencies such considerations that is non uniqueness and probabilistic description of the emerging effective dynamics will be taken into account in our effective toy model of selective measurements 3 a two step effective dynamics for selective measurement in qm our toy model serves as an effective two step dynamical description of selective measurement of a self adjoint observable a mn the two consecutive dynamical steps use the two types of effective dynamics on the set sn mn 1 of density matrices discussed in the previous chapter cp 1 dynamics and a parametrized set of non linear dynamics the first dynamical step the lindblad dynamics 7 on density matrices in sn is characterized by suitably chosen lindblad operators which results an a decohered asymptotic density matrix sa sn a from the initial one 0 sn the second dynamical step uses sa as the initial state 0 of a non linear effective dynamics on sa the possible non linear effective dynamics are parametrized by a decohered external density matrices ext sa the choice of the dynamics parametrized by ext sa in a single run measurement is thought to be the effective description of the choice of the initial state of the full system measuring device plus measured subsystem within the inverse image of the prepared initial state 0 of the measured subsystem we will prove that depending on the relative positions of 0 and ext the asymptotic state of the non linear dynamics on sa is one of the spectral projection pa a a of a the relative frequency of the outcome pa in repeated experiments with identical initial states 0 with respect to uniform distribution of ext sa is given by tr 0 pa 3 1 decoherence due to specific lindblad dynamics the possibility that certain lindblad dynamics t exp tl t 0 given by 7 could lead to asymptotic decoherence of an initial state with respect to the measured observable was known in the community of measurement theorists in case of a finite dimensional hilbert space a detailed analysis of possible lindblad evolutions of density matrices was given in ban recently the decoherence of the initial density matrix in non selective measurements was described in w using lindblad dynamics for completeness we formulate this decoherence in a proposition based on these earlier results in the following we refer to a density matrix sn as asymptotic state of a lindblad dynamics if there is an initial state sn such that limt t since the maps t t 0 form a semigroup sn is an asymptotic state iff it is an invariant state with respect to the dynamics t t 0 proposition 1 i the set of asymptotic states of a lindblad evolution 7 with l l h vk is equal to the image a sn of non selective measurements 3 of the self adjoint observable a mn iff the von neumann algebra generated by the lindblad operators satisfies h vk v k a ii let h vk v k a any initial state sn leads to an asymptotic state iff h vk v k vk v k then lim t t a a a pa pa 16 6 proof i we use the result in ban claiming that b mn is invariant t b b t 0 with respect to a heisenberg cp 1 dynamics t exp tl t 0 with lindblad generator l l h vk 6 iff b h vk v k let the lindblad operators be chosen in a way that h vk v k is equal to the commutative algebra a generated by the measured observable a mn then vkv k v k vk for all k hence l h vk given in 7 itself is a generator of a semigroup of cp 1 maps on mn given by 6 with l h v k l h vk applying the above mentioned result of ban to l the invariant subalgebra of mn with respect to t t 0 is equal to h v k vk a a mn therefore the set of asymptotic states that is the set of t invariant density matrices is equal to h v k vk sn a sn for the opposite implication let us note first that if the set of t invariant states is a sn then the t invariant subalgebra of mn is a mn because a is a linear map and sn linearly spans mn since a is unit preserving the unit 1 mn is t invariant that is l 1 0 which implies k vkv k k v k vk due to the form 7 of l thus l h vk is equal to the generator l h v k of a semigroup of cp 1 maps on mn therefore the t invariant subalgebra which is a mn a by assumption is equal to h v k vk by ban hence a h vk v k ii the adjoint of the lindblad generator l h vk in 7 with respect to the scalar product on mn given by the trace turns out to be the corresponding lindblad generator 6 that is l h vk l h vk therefore l is not self adjoint in general but a jordan decomposition of l as a linear map on mn exists thus the generalized eigenvalue problem for eigenmatrices of l that is the equation l k 0 k 1 for k dimensional jordan blocks spanned by a 1 a 2 ak mn leads to the solution of the lindblad equation 7 t ak e tak t ak 1 e t ak 1 tak t a 1 e t a 1 ta 2 tk 1 ak 17 in our case h vk v k a by assumption commutativity of this algebra implies that l is normal l l l l and l h vk l h v k hence only k 1 dimensional blocks occur in the jordan decomposition of l and t t 0 themselves become cp 1 maps however a unit preserving positive map between c algebras is a norm 1 map see e g br corollary 3 2 6 that is t a a for all t 0 and a mn therefore re 0 for proper k 1 eigenmatrices of l in 17 which implies that limt t a 0 for l eigenmatrices a with re 0 and the asymptotic states lie in the linear subspace of mn spanned by l eigenmatrices with re 0 it has been shown in w that the re 0 eigensubspace is given by vk v k the restriction of l in 7 to this subspace becomes the anti self adjoint operator l b i h b which has purely imaginary eigenvalues hence every initial state sn leads to an asymptotic state iff these purely imaginary eigenvalues are zero that is iff h vk v k or equivalently h vk v k vk v k the assumption h vk v k a implies that a t t a t 0 and since a being a norm one map is continuous 16 also follows we close this subsection by emphasizing that an idealized two step dynamical description of selective measurements is possible just because the first step the non selective measurement of a preserves the initial expectation values within a that is c c limt t c for c a indeed due to 16 we have b a b b mn and a b b if b a a mn by using of 3 therefore the probability relative frequency of the spectral outcome a a in the selective measurements with initial states and are equal pa pa because pa a a therefore the born rule is not violated if the initial state of the second dynamical step which is responsible for a purification will be the a decohered asymptotic state a of the first in terms of density matrices this idealized two step dynamics means that the initial density matrix of the second dynamical step will be the a decohered asymptotic density matrix a a sn sn a of the first to be more precise the second type dynamics will work on the set sa of density matrices on the abelian algebra a clearly sa a sn only if a is a maximal abelian subalgebra in mn i e when a a hence if a is not maximal abelian in mn then the initial density matrix sa of the second dynamical step will be the restriction of the a decohered density matrix a to a 7 3 2 purification due to non linear dynamics as we have seen in chapter 2 effective non linear dynamics may arise from the restriction of a large n limit unitary dynamics to a fixed small subsystem we have also indicated that the effective dynamics depends on the initial state of the full system within the inverse image of the initial state of the subsystem the effective non linear toy dynamics we present here is along these lines the subsystem is the abelian algebra a generated by the measured observable a the effective non linear dynamics are given on the convex set sa a 1 of density matrices on a the possible dynamics are characterized by external density matrices ext sa being fixed in a single run of the dynamics the choice of the external density matrix ext from sa is thought to be the effective description of the choice of the unknown initial state of the unknown full system measuring device plus measured subsystem within the inverse image of the initial state 0 sa of the subsystem therefore ext serves as an effective characterization of the dependence of the effective dynamics on the unknown initial state of the unknown full system the non linear dynamics on sa will be given by a first order non linear differential equation char acterized by a map f sa sa a let ext sa a then the time evolution of is given by d dt f ext tr f ext f ext a ext 18 where a 0 is a constant and the real number ext as a function of and ext is defined to be the maximal value of 0 1 for which ext is a positive operator to clarify the value let us note first that since a nm 1 sa is the convex hull of its extremal points pi i 1 n which are the minimal projections in a let the subsimplex si sa i 1 n be defined as the convex hull of p 1 pi 1 pi 1 pn clearly isi sa if ext si then it can be written as a convex combination ext i k 6 i kpk and one arrives at ext i for a special case with n 3 see figure 1 pp 1 2 p 3 ext 2 s figure 1 the convex set sa of a decohered density matrices in a 3 m 1 is shown which is spanned by its extremal points the spectral projections p 1 p 2 p 3 of a the subsimplices si are also indicated but only s 2 spanned by p 1 p 3 and sa is labeled which contains the external density matrix ext sa hence it can be written as a convex combination ext 2 1 p 1 3 p 3 s 2 although the dynamics 18 is deterministic the relative frequency of the outcomes that is the asymp totic states with identical initial conditions 0 will depend on the distribution of the choice of external density matrices ext sa in the repeated runs thus we have to define a measure on sa that is on the convex hull of the minimal projections in pi i 1 n a using the trace as a scalar product on the real vector space ha of self adjoint elements in a ha becomes a real hilbert space isomorphic to r n through the mapping of the minimal projections p 1 pn a into an orthonormal basis of rn 8 hence sa ha rn becomes a n 1 dimensional simplex in the unit cube of rn and the lebesgue measure in rn 1 provides a finite measure on sa theorem 1 let a mn c be a maximal abelian subalgebra generated by a self adjoint element a let the real hilbert space ha of self adjoint elements in a be identified with rn through the orthonormal basis given by the minimal projections p 1 pn a i let 0 sa be an initial density matrix for the differential equation 18 with an arbitrary but fixed external density matrix ext in the interior s int a of the closed convex set sa rn then there exists a unique solution of the initial value problem and the corresponding integral curve t t 0 lies in sa the generic asymptotic states for any pair 0 sa and ext sinta are the minimal projections p 1 pn a which are the stable fixed points of the dynamics 18 on sa ii let the measure on sa be induced by the lebesgue measure in r n 1 through the image of sa ha in rn which is a n 1 dimensional simplex in the unit cube of rn if the external density matrix ext sa is chosen uniformly random with respect to this measure then the asymptotic states of 18 started from identical initial states 0 are equal to pi with probability tr 0 pi i 1 n proof i the picard lindel f theorem for first order differential equations provides the existence of a unique solution of the initial value problem in a region of sa if uniform lipschitz continuity holds there for the tangent vector f ext f ext tr f ext ha rn i e for the right hand side of 18 hence it is enough to prove uniform lipschitz continuity f ext f ext ki ext di ext sa i 1 n 19 for domains that cover sa since trf ext 0 tr t 1 t 0 will follow for integral curves the domain di ext sa in 19 is defined as follows for sinta let ci be the n 1 dimensional affine convex cone in ha with base point sinta and generating vectors pk k 1 i 1 i 1 n being linearly independent if is in the interior of sa ci lies in the one co dimensional hyperplane in ha rn that contains sa let di ci sa clearly ni 1 di sa and the intersections di 1 dim 2 m n are the n m dimensional common boundaries of them for the special case n 3 see figure 2 pp 1 2 p 3 d 3 figure 2 in case of a 3 m 1 the closed domains di ci sa i 1 2 3 in the convex set sa p 1 p 2 p 3 of a decohered density matrices are shown they are bounded by straight lines the domain d 3 is even labeled the two extremal rays generated by p 1 and p 2 of the affine convex cone c 3 are indicated by dashed lines let di ext and let k rkpk and ext k skpk be the corresponding convex combinations since ext sinta by assumption we have sk 0 k 1 n since di ext by assumption that 9 is ext si ext can be written as the convex combination ext i k 6 i kpk which implies ri si hence ext i si ri in f ext given in 18 and f ext f k rkpk k skpk a k 6 i rk k pk a k 6 i rk sk si ri rk pk ci 20 therefore if di ext one can use the form 20 of the tangent vectors to prove that 19 holds with lipschitz constants ki ext a 4 6 si in di ext i 1 n to get these constants one uses triangle inequality for the norm that is bounded by 1 on sa non negativity of the coefficients rk r k sk k 1 n that they sum up to 1 the cauchy schwarz inequality for their scalar product in rn and the inequality ri si thus due to lipschitz continuity for any ext sinta there exists a unique solution of the initial value problem of 18 with 0 di ext i 1 n till the integral curve remains in the corresponding domain di ext due to 20 the tangent vector at the point is in the future affine cone ci which contains all cones ci with di ci sa therefore the unique integral curve with initial condition 0 di ext gives rise to monotone decreasing affine cones ci t ci t if t t which is strictly monotone at t if f t ext 6 0 this property excludes closed integral curves since 0 di ext ci ext sa that is ci 0 ci ext the unique integral curve t does not leave the affine cone ci ext it does not leave di ext that is sa either because t at the boundary face of sa characterized by a zero pk coefficient has tangent vector parallel with that face due to 20 the normal component ark t k t t pk of the tangent vector f t ext is zero because rk t 0 let us turn to the fixed point structure of the dynamics 18 that is to the possible asymptotic states since integral curves with initial points 0 di ext do not leave di ext the integral curves with 0 di 1 ext dim ext 2 m n do not leave the corresponding common boundary di 1 ext dim ext for m n the intersection contains the single point ext hence it is a fixed point in accordance with the fact that f ext ext 0 due to f ext ext 0 it is the only fixed point of 18 in sinta because if k rkpk di ext with all rk 0 and i 1 then f ext 6 0 due to 20 therefore the fixed points different from ext are on the boundary sa of sa if 0 di ext int that is if ext si 0 int then ext si t int for all t 0 which implies k t 0 k 1 n hence due to the corresponding expression of f ext in 20 such initial states necessarily lead to the asymptotic state characterized by rk 0 k 6 i that is by ri 1 which state is nothing else than the fixed point pi satisfying f pi ext 0 due to 20 thus all the other asymptotic states on the boundary sa should arise from initial states in a common boundary di 1 ext dim ext 2 m n since the corresponding integral curve remains in the intersection the possible asymptotic states are on sa di 1 ext dim ext therefore the only stable fixed points are pi i 1 n because they and only they have a neighborhood in sa as attractor regions the unstable fixed points on sa di 1 ext dim ext can be characterized by the d n 1 dimension of their attracting submanifold in sa which is n m in the generic case we do not solve the ext dependent fixed point condition f ext 0 for them 0 ext is a maximally unstable fixed point because any other initial state in the ext neighborhood s int a leads to a different fixed point as asymptotic state ii let the initial state 0 k rk 0 pk be fixed in repeated runs we have seen that if the dynamics 18 is characterized by ext si 0 int that is 0 di ext int then the asymptotic state is pi hence ff the external density matrix ext sa is chosen uniformly random within sa then the probability relative frequency of the asymptotic state pi is just the relative volume v si 0 int v sa that is the quotient of the lebesgue measures of si 0 int and sa since the n 1 dimensional simplices si 0 and sa in the unit cube of r n have a common n 2 dimensional boundary face the ratio of their volumes is given by the ratio of the distances of the remaining vertices 0 si 0 and pi sa from that common boundary face the ratio of these distances is nothing else than ri 0 tr 0 pi the probability of the outcome of an unstable fixed point is zero because such an outcome implies that ext is contained in a common boundary si 1 0 sim 0 2 m n which is a subset 10 of zero lebesgue measure in sa 4 closing remarks apart from the lack of derivation of the effective description of selective measurements our toy model has two technical weakness as well it works in finite dimensional hilbert spaces and it is a two step dynamics which requires two consecutive asymptotic evolutions of an initial state these technical weakness can be relieved a bit if both the hilbert space h both the abelian von neumann algebra a b h affiliated to a possibly unbounded self adjoint observable a are infinite dimensional then it is not clear how to choose the lindblad operators to get a decohered asymptotic states from any normal initial states on b h as a result of a lindblad dynamics however once an a decohered asymptotic state is reached the second non linear dynamical step can be used as an approximation one can prescribe a finite partition of the spectrum a r of a hence the corresponding spectral interval projections pi a i 1 n generate a finite dimensional unital abelian algebra a in a b h then the restriction of the original normal state on b h to a which should be equal to the restriction of the asymptotic a decohered state of a lindblad dynamics can be the initial state of the second step non linear dynamics described in the previous chapter one can also incorporate the simultaneous measurement of the joint spectrum of commuting ob servables a b c in the toy model since they generate an abelian algebra one can use the products of their spectral projections as minimal projections if they have finite spectra otherwise products of the above mentioned spectral interval projections can be used as a certain approximation of the outcomes thus one can have for example an effective finite dimensional description of position measurements of commuting coordinate operators with an arbitrary fine but finite spectral i e position resolution the idealized two step description of the selective measurement of a mn i e the use of lindblad dynamics 7 followed by the non linear dynamics 18 could be cured by combining them into a single dynamics on the set sn of density matrices in mn d dt l f ext sn ext sa 21 where the operators h vk in the lindblad generator l l h vk is chosen according to proposition 1 to ensure a decoherence the tangent vector f ext f ext tr f ext can be of the form given in 18 but f sn sa mn should be an extension of f sa sa a with self adjoint images for example one can choose f ext a 2 ext ext with the extended definition of ext it is the maximal value of 0 1 for which ext is a positive operator in mn we think that if the parameter a 0 in f is small enough that is the a decoherence is much faster than a purification then 21 leads to an effective two step dynamics with results described in the previous chapter finally let us make some remarks about a possible experimental test of the dynamical nature of selective measurements more precisely about the test of the effective non linear dynamical step in our toy model here the repeated measurements of a with identical initial state 0 sa can be thought as a 0 dependent map from probability distributions on external density matrices ext sa into probability distributions on the set p 1 pn sa of asymptotic states if the measuring device can be switched off and on quickly enough at t 0 without disturbing the intermediate state t of the measured system then one obtains a 0 dependent distribution of the intermediate states at time t on the one hand on the other hand the immediately restarted experiments with this intermediate state distribution as an initial state distribution lead to a t dependent distribution of asymptotic states p 1 pn which is different from the asymptotic state distribution of uninterrupted measurements in general the resulted asymptotic state distribution of repeated interrupted and restarted experiments with identical initial states 0 and identical interruption times t can be calculated from the effective toy 11 dynamics in principle and can be compared with the relative frequency of the asymptotic experimental outcomes for any interruption time t 0 acknowledgements the author is grateful to l szl b szabados for the fruitful discussions on first order differential equations special thanks to lajos di si and
