quantum random number generator based on quantum tunneling effect junlin li haihan zhou dong pan and guilu long 1 state key laboratory of low dimensional quantum physics tsinghua university beijing 100084 china in this paper we proposed an experimental implementation of quantum random number gen erator qrng with inherent randomness of quantum tunneling effect of electrons we exploited ingaas inp diodes whose valance band and conduction band shared a quasi constant energy bar rier we applied a bias voltage on the ingaas inp avalanche diode which made the diode works under geiger mode and triggered the tunneling events with a periodic pulse finally after data collection and post processing our quantum random number generation rate reached 8 mb s and final data was verified by nist test and diehard test our experiment is characterized as an innova tive low cost photonic source free integratable or even chip achievable method in quantum random number generation pacs numbers i introduction random numbers are crucial in many fields for instance the physical simulation 1 informa tion processing 2 quantum communication protocols 3 quantum cryptography 4 and quantum computation 5 under most circumstances security is directly associ ated with its unpredictability and uncopyablity how ever the prevalent pseudo random number or chaotic random number 6 are theoretically pre determined or not proven to be unpredictable meanwhile it is of great significance to develop true random number gen erator fortunately uncertainty is a fundamental prop erty of quantum mechanics so numerous studies on true random number generation has focused on the ap plication of quantum inherent uncertainty or probabil ity such as the path choice of single photon with fixed polarization after passing a pbs 7 8 the uncertainty of the arrival time of single photons 9 10 or the phase fluctuation of photons 11 12 and more recently bow els proposed a protocol of self testing quantum random number generator 13 with the measurement of dimen sion witness 14 it made a quantative analysis on the true randomness of a given system also ma studied how to generate true randomness with an untrustwor thy random source 15 moreover xu introduced a ro bust quantum random number generator via the high di mensional interference 16 the generation speed of these protocols varies from bps to gbps noteworthy all these pervasive protocols exploited photonic sources or even single photon sources in light of the difficulty of integration and the vul nerability to the environmental influence of photonic source together with other flaws that impede the prag matic application of quantum random number gen erators we focused on another intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics the tunneling probability of electrons 17 18 19 which aborted the essence of pho tonic source and turn to the electronic source conse quently our qrng could be highly integratable in this paper we introduced an efficient protocol of quantum random number generation via the ap plication of intrinsic indeterministic property of quan tum tunneling effect and experimentally realized this protocol via the widely applied ingaas inp avalanche diode 20 21 22 with the generation speed reaching 8 mb s furthermore higher speed up to 20 mb s can be reached by changing the frequency of trigger pulses on the other hand a more efficient system which could respond to a higher frequency of trigger pulse is com petent to augment the generation speed as stable high frequency voltage pulses up to gb s could be realized in a precise way in nowadays electronic controlling also post processing program can be easily transplanted into our data collecting fpga which enable a real time out put of quantum random number sequence ii protocol consider electrons trapped in a potential well we ap ply a periodic bias voltage whose peak value is uh on this system which could induce tunneling events with a constant probability p within each single period and then record a sequence of these signal with 0 when no tunnel ing occurs in a single pulse period and 1 when it occurs here the tunneling probability p can be determined the oretically 23 finally post processing of the sequence was operated and we obtained the eligible random num ber sequences 24 this protocol is also summarized in fig 1 we noticed that shelan khasro tawfeeq has exploited the dark counts of ingaas inp avalanche diode in ran dom number generation 25 however our protocol is utterly distinct with hers this difference is interpreted in the next section ar x iv 1 71 1 01 75 2 v 1 qu an t ph 6 n ov 2 01 7 2 fig 1 brief summary of the tunneling based qrng fig 2 experimental setup of tunneling based qrng 1 optical input channel 2 external clock input channel trigger signal input channel 3 final random number output chan nel iii experimental implementation the key problem in our experiment is setup of the electron reservoir bounded by a stable potential bar rier as the electronic realization of precise bias voltage pulses is not a challenge after several pre tests we uti lized the ingaas inp avalanche diode although the in gaas inp avalanche diode is prevailing in the photon de tectors our experiment is totally irrelevant to photonic source on the contrary we just take advantage of the quasi static barrier it possessed as concoluded in 26 an ingaas inp avalanche diode consists four parts in its energy band diagram and in our experiment trigger sig nals were applied to accelerate electrons in the p inp section these electrons tunneled through junction be tween p inp section and n inp section with certain probability determined on the peak voltage of trigger sig nals uh subsequently we recorded the tunneling signals and came to raw data setup of our experiment was shown in fig 2 and 3 showed the circuit of out experiment we confined the ingaas inp diode in a seal box hence no environmen tal photons could contribute to the signals received by the receptor module as we mentioned above the qrng source is the tun neling effect of electrons in ingaas inp avalanche diode which is irrelevant to the photons and was considered as part of the dark counts in the previous study 27 dark counts of ingaas inp avalanche diode can be fig 3 circuit of tunneling based qrng characterized into 3 kinds 28 1 dark counts induced by heat motion of electrons 2 dark counts induced by quantum tunneling effect 3 dark counts induced by after pulse effect when proper bias voltage is applied on the in gaas inp avalanche diode it works under the geiger mode 21 under this circumstance the accelerated elec trons triggered avalanche effect in the accelerating sec tion which could induce current signals while the bias voltage varies the tunneling probability changes so does the data properties data entropy data auto correlation parameter and the final data generation speed and as mentioned in the previous section our proto col focus more on the dark counts induced by quantum tunneling effect where the voltage of the trigger signal s high level uh dominates the tunneling probability in a single period t while shelan s work emphasized more about the pulsewidth of a fixed trigger signal the after pulse effect could responsible for her thesis which is not 3 fig 4 mean of output data under different voltage r 2 0 964 credited with quantum property in order to restrain the fisrt effect mentioned above the working environment is monitored at 200 k by the semiconductor cooling system under this circumstance the i type dark counts was reduced to 500 s which is equivalent to 10 5 pulse in a 50 mhz bias voltage pulse triggered system meanwhile the iii type dark counts is partly circumvented by the deadtime of this system the deadtime system ensures that after each tunneling occurs there will be a time interval t during which the detector is forced offline namely the after pulse during this time interval t could not be counted however due to the hardware impediment and the remnant after pulse our raw random number data requires a further optimization and post processing program is applied to countervail this bias and subsequently generate true ran domness the counting number of the tunneling induced signals in 1 s can be directly displayed on a screen in our ex periment the frequency of bias voltage pulses was set to 50 mb s then we adjusted the amplitude of these pulses u until the counting number reach 2 5 107 according to 29 we can demonstrate our tunneling probability as p v ae b v v 0 1 here a b are parametric expression which are deter mined by several indexes v 0 is the critical voltage under which the tunneling probability is 0 in order to deter mine proper voltage we measured the mean and entropy of output data from 49 25 v to 49 5 v and simulated the result based on the above equation we obtained figure 4 5 6 7 we noticed when u 49 28 v u 49 29 v u 49 30 v the mean obviously biased from other data so we omitted them and comes to figure 5 7 as the forward tunneling probability is too compli cated to have an analytical expression 23 we quantita tively fitted the data with curves shown above fig 5 mean of output data under different voltage without 49 28 v 49 29 v and 49 30 v r 2 0 9996 fig 6 entropy of output data under different voltage finally we chose uh 49 40 v and we designed a fpga module to collect all tunneling data and saved it into a txt document the speed of raw data collec tion is about 20 mb s which is restricted by the usb communication serial port iv post processing the post processing program is realized by the appli cation of toeplitz hashing extractor 24 min entropy estimation we measure the minimum fig 7

reach in our scheme we took n 8 namely we di vide our raw data into 8 bits sequences and then cal culate maximum probability of these segments and the min entropy in our experiments hm 5 1204 toeplitz hashing extractor after the min entropy es timation we characterized the raw data with the propor tion of quantum randomness namely independent 2 8 bits quantum random code can be extracted from each 8 bits raw data segment subsequently we generate a toeplitz matrix t with two independent random seeds sa sa 1 sa 2 sam sb sb 1 sb 2 sbn m and n are determined by the min entropy and the length of raw data l and sa sb consisted the row and column of t respectively n l m l hm h 0 2 log 2 3 notice that is the secure parameter and h 0 log 2 l hm is the min entropy of the raw data scheme of postprocessing for a raw data sequence d with length l eligible quantum random sequence d can be obtained as follows d t d d 1 dl l sa 1 sam sbn sa 1 m d 1 d m 4 here we noticed a systematic bias ascribed to the low peak peak value of our qrng briefly the lower level in our experiment was supposed to be low enough so that no tunneling could occur and the after pulse could be relieved unfortunately restricted by the inner set of the driven module in ingaas inp trigger mod ule the difference between high level and low level is fixed at u 4 v which means that even the low levelul uh 4 v and could result in tunneling cur rent inevitably the ingaas inp apd self protecting program which compels the ingaas inp apd out of avalanche effect was activated automatically as the in gaas inp apd works at avalanche mode in a prolonged period thus we could see a set of 0 s in our raw data periodically v data analysis in our final experiment we set the frequency of trig ger pulse to 50 mhz with 0 ns deadtime and the bias fig 8 upper is the result of nist test of our final random sequence while the lower is the eligible rate of sequences de composed from the original final sequence the voltage of high level vh 49 40 v and the data size of original final sequence is 5 gb voltage was fixed to 49 40 v as showed above the min entropy hm 5 12 for 8 bits sequences combined with a secure parameter 2 100 data length l 3000 the random bits generation rate was 8 3 mb s after a set of 5 gbfinal data we applied the nist sts test and diehard test see figure 5 and figure 6 aside from these two tests the auto correlation function is also drew from the data sheet as shown by figure 7 and more details of the test data is provided in the appendix it is apparently that all our random number passed these two tests and the auto correlation got a dramatic decline after postprocessing with toeplitz hashing ex tractor noteworthy that the improvement on the data collection module and the optimization of the trigger module is approachable certifies realization of higher gen eration rate vi conclusion in this paper we proposed a qrng protocol based on the tunneling effect in ingaas inp avalanche diode and thus no photonic sources is required in our experiments moreover with the application of integrated module in ingaas inp single photon detector we implemented a photonic source free qrng whose generation rate could reach 8 3 mb s moreover this rate can be lifted up to 20 mb s with the facilities we have our further study 5 fig 9 upper is the result of diehard test of our final random sequence the voltage of high level vh 49 40 v and the data size of original final sequence is 5 gb fig 10 auto correlation of the forgoing final data will focus on following questions 1 designing a trigger source with higher frequency shorter pulse width and larger peak peak voltage value 2 seeking a more stable and robust physical system as the tunneling source in light of the disadvantages of our ingaas inp avalanche diode system 3 combination of this tunneling protocol and other qrngs as mentioned in 13 15 16 31 statistical test p value proportion assessment frequency 0
