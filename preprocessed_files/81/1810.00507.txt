chemical and biological physics weizmann institute of science rehovot 76100 israel we report a detailed analysis of the energy spectra second and high order structure functions of velocity differences in superfluid 4 he counterflow turbulence measured in a wide range of tem peratures and heat fluxes we show that the one dimensional energy spectrum exz ky averaged over the xz plane parallel to the channel wall directly measured as a function of the wall normal wave vector ky gives more detailed information on the energy distribution over scales than the corresponding second order structure function s 2 y in particular we discover two intervals of ky with different apparent exponents exz ky k mc y for k k and exz ky k mf y for k k here k denotes wavenumber that separate scales with relatively strong for k k and relatively weak for k k coupling between the normal fluid and superfluid velocity components we in terpret these k ranges as cascade dominated and mutual friction dominated intervals respectively general behavior of the experimental spectra exz ky agree well with the predicted spectra phys rev b 97 214513 2018 analysis of the n th order structure functions statistics shows that in the energy containing interval the statistics of counterflow turbulence is close to gaussian similar to the classical hydrodynamic turbulence in the cascade and mutual friction dominated intervals we found some modest enhancement of intermittency with respect of its level in classical turbulence however at small scales the intermittency becomes much stronger than in the classical turbulence i introduction below the bose einstein condensation temperature t 2 17 k liquid 4 he becomes a quantum super fluid 1 3 with the vorticity constrained to vortex line sin gularities of core radius a 0 10 8 cm and fixed circula tion h m 4 here h is planck s constant and m is the mass of the 4 he atom the superfluid turbulence is manifested as a complex tangle of these vortex lines with a typical inter vortex distance 10 4 10 2 cm 5 large scale hydrodynamics of such system is usually described by a two fluid model interpreting 4 he as a mixture of two coupled fluid components an inviscid su perfluid and a viscous normal fluid the temperature dependent densities of the components s t and n t define their contributions to the mixture the total den sity of 4 he s t n t t weakly depends on the temperature the tangle of quantum vortexes medi ates the interaction between fluid components via mutual friction force 2 5 8 there is a building evidence 9 12 that the large scale turbulence in mechanically driven superfluid 4 he is sim ilar to the classical turbulence in this case both com ponents move with close velocities being coupled by the mutual friction force almost at all scales on the con trary the turbulence generated in superfluid 4 he by a heat flux in a channel has no classical analogy here two components are moving in the opposite directions relative to the channel walls with respective mean ve locities un and us in this way the counterflow velocity uns un us 6 0 proportional to the applied heat flux is created along the channel which can trigger the creation of a tangle of vortex lines above a small critical velocity systematic experimental studies of counterflow turbu lence pioneered by classical 1957 papers of vinen 7 were long concentrated mostly on global characteristics of the vortex tangle cf see ref 12 for a review the statistics of turbulent fluctuations was not accessible recently the turbulent statistics in the 4 he

streamwise velocity difference ux y y t ux y y t ux y t 1 b other studies 15 16 measured the statistics of the super fluid component recent theoretical analysis 17 found that the energy spectra in counterflow turbulence are not scale invariant and cannot be rigorously connected with apparent scal ing exponents of the second order velocity structure functions measured in ref 13 at modest values of the reynolds numbers in this paper we suggest a new way to analyze the visualization data 13 that allows the one dimensional energy spectra to be determined so that a direct comparison with theoretical predictions can be made 17 in addition we use higher order structure func tions to assess the level of intermittency in counterflow turbulence the paper is organized as follows the analytical background of the problem of statistical description of superfluid counterflow turbulence is cov ered in section ii it starts with sec ii a which is devoted to the second order statistical characteristics of homoge neous turbulence in sec ii b we suggest a new way of http arxiv org abs 1810 00507 v 1 2 velocity data analysis that allows to directly extract the one dimensional energy

find the normal fluid and superfluid energy spectra in a wide range of the problem parameters our experimental results on the statistics of the normal fluid turbulence and their analysis are presented in section iii in sec iii a we briefly describe the exper imental techniques the important cross over wavenum bers for the current problem are estimated in sec iii b section iii c is devoted to the second order statistics of counterflow turbulence the velocity structure functions s 2 see sec iii c 1 and left column of fig 1 and the energy spectra e k see sec iii c 2 and middle col umn of fig 1 in particular we demonstrate that the counterflow energy spectra can be divided in two sub intervals a cascade dominated interval and a mutual friction dominated interval with the apparent scaling exponents mc 2 and mf 3 see fig 1 right col umn an important question about the relationship be tween s 2 and e k is discussed in sec iii c 3 and il lustrated in fig 2 we show in sec iii d and fig 3 that the theoretically predicted energy spectra are in good agreement with the experimental energy spectra in the cascade dominated range of wavenumbers in section iii e we concentrate on high order velocity structure functions s 4 y ux y y t 4 s 6 y ux y y t 6 1 c in fig 4 we show that the flatness f 4 y and hyper flatness f 6 y f 4 y s 4 y s 2 2 y f 6 y s 6 y s 3 2 y 2 have two ranges of power

as y approaches the viscous scales i e y y the small scale intermittency becomes stronger x 2 4 0 5 and x 2 6 1 4 this behavior is similar to the intermi tency enhancement observed in the mechanically

approach in the ky space to the data analysis of the visualiza tion data allows one to get additional information on the statistics of counterflow turbulence that is hidden in the approach based on s

to eq 3 a we define next the 1 d energy spectrum 2 ky k y e ky v ky v k y 7 b which is nothing but exz ky defined by eq 4 c to see this notice that integration over dkx 2 and dkz 2 in eq 4 c according to eq 3 c results in ui x 0 y z 0 our expectation is that v ky and respectively e ky better separates turbulent fluctuations with different 4 scales than u y y and respectively s 2 y to see this one may consider relation between e ky and s 2 y using inverse fourier transform of eq 7 a u y v ky exp ikyy dy 7 c in the definition of s 2 y i e eq 1 a and applying eq 7 b one gets s 2 y 2 sin 2 kyy 2

fn ky and sn y is not so simple in any case one expects as we will demonstrate in this paper that direct measurement of the integrand exz ky gives more detailed information about the statistics of counterflow turbulence than the measurements of the in tegral eq 7 d for s 2 y c overview of the theory of counterflow turbulence analytical theory of counterflow superfluid turbulence developed in ref 17 describes the energy spectra of the normal fluid and superfluid components of superfluid 4 he at scales r exceeding intervortex distance 1 l where l is the vortex density i e total length of vor tex lines per unit volume the theory is based on the gradually damped version 20 of the coarse grained hall vinen bekarevich khalatnikov hvbk equations gen eralized in ref 21 for the counterflow turbulence these equations have a form of two navier stokes equations for the turbulent velocity fluctuations un r t and us r t coupled by a simplified version of the mutual friction force 22 fns s un

fluid and superfluid subsystems and the cross correlation function ens k is related simi larly to fns k eqs 9 are exact in the framework of hvbk equa tions but not closed to make them practically

features of the large scale normal fluid energy spectra of counterflow turbulence observed in the visualization experiments although it does not account for the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the flow iii experimental results and their analysis in this section we analyze the experimental data of the normal fluid turbulent velocity fluctuations u y ob tained for t 1 65 k 1 85 k 2 00 k and 2 10 k with three values of heat fluxes q at each temperature main parameters of these experiments are given in table i this table also collects the values of important characteristic wavenumbers estimated below in sec iii b the second order statistics i e the structure functions and the spec tra ezx ky are discussed in sec iii c and the higher order statistics of the structure functions in sec iii e a experimental techniques the experimental apparatus is identical with that de scribed in refs 13 14 a stainless steel channel of 9 5 mm square cross section with a total length of 300 mm is attached to a pumped helium bath whose temperature can be controlled within 0 1 mk by regulating the vapor pressure a planar heater around 400 at the lower end of the channel was used to drive a thermal coun terflow when the heat flux is sufficiently large both the superfluid and the normal fluid components can be come turbulent to probe the normal fluid turbulence our recently developed he 2 molecular tracer line track ing technique 24 was adopted a 35 fs pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 5 khz and a pulse energy of about 60 j was focused into the channel to produce a thin line of he 2 molecular tracers this tracer line can be driven to produce 640 nm fluorescent light by a pulse train from an imaging laser at 905 nm i e 5 6 pulses at a repeti tion rate of 500 hz the fluorescence was captured by an intensified ccd iccd camera mounted perpendic ular to both the flow direction and the laser beam path to produce the images of the tracer line in a typical ex periment a straight baseline image is acquired to serve as a reference then the heater is turned on for at least 20 s so that a fully developed counterflow can establish in the channel after that we produce a tracer line and let the tracer line move with the normal fluid by a drift time t before the drifted line is imaged in order to extract quantitative velocity field informa tion the center location of every line segment needs to be accurately determined in our previous research 13 14 a simple gaussian fit method was adopted first the image of a tracer line was cut into many small segments i e typically 40 60 segments then the fluorescence intensity profile of each line segment was fit by a gaussian function such that both the center location and the width of the line segment can be determined the streamwise velocity of the normal fluid at position y can be calcu lated as the displacement of the line segment divided by the drift time t this method works well only when the tracer line image has good quality and high signal to noise ratio however as the normal fluid velocity in creases some line segments can distort and smear which can result in significant uncertainty in locating the cen ter of these segments using the gaussian fit method in this research we utilized a more sophisticated approach which is based on the algorithm proposed by pulkkinen et al for finding curvilinear structures in noisy data 25 there are two steps involved in the image analysis first a tracer line image is noise filtered based on the intensity of bright pixels using numerically inexpensive nearest neighbors searches the basic idea is to remove those bright pixels that are surrounded all by dark pixels and hence are more likely created due to instrument or en vironmental noises 26 subsequently the algorithm of ref 25 is applied to determine the ridge line of the en tire fluorescence intensity profile the displacement of the ridge line then allows us to calculate the streamwise normal fluid velocity regardless of the bad quality of some local line segments based on the obtained streamwise normal fluid ve locity ux y we can evaluate the velocity difference ux y y ux y y ux y between two line segments that are separated by a distance y then the transverse structure functions of the normal fluid turbulence can be easily computed as sn y uy y y n where the angle brackets denote an ensemble average over all the images obtained under the same experimental condi tions typically 30 100 images the calculated structure function profiles are found to be insensitive to the refer ence location y the 1 d energy spectra averaged over x z plane and parallel to the channel wall can also be determined in fig 1 we show the obtained structure function and energy spectra curves at various tempera tures and heat fluxes it should be noted that the results for separation distance y smaller than the thickness of the tracer line i e about 100 200 m can have large uncertainties b estimates

were found in ref 13 and are re produced in table i column 13 the values of n for t 2 1 k are slightly larger than in ref 13 likely due to the improved image analysis and the fitting procedure note that the values of n vary widely depending on the flow parameters the temperature and the heat flux the dot dashed vertical lines colored as the structure functions and collectively marked y denote the scale that delineate the ranges of dominance of two dissipative mechanisms the mutual friction for y y and the viscous dissipation for y y we should also note that simple analysis of eq 7 d shows that the small scale behavior s 2 y y 2 appears if the energy spectrum e k decays as k 3 or faster in cluding the exponential decay therefore the apparent y 2 scaling cannot be uniquely connected with the viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy as in the classical turbulence moreover the asymptotic slope s 2 y y 2 at y y is not reached in our experiments due the limited spatial resolution cf fig 4 a 2 energy spectra of counterflow turbulence one dimensional energy spectra compensated by k 41 scaling k 5 3 e k are shown in figs 1 middle column we can easily identify several k ranges with different k dependence of the spectra the small wavenumber k k 0 behavior is clearly different from the rest of the spectrum a relatively short part of the spectra is close to compensation by k 41 while remaining steeper the large k part of the spectra has a much larger slope extending over all remaining interval of scales we will now try to relate between these different types of be havior and various crossover wavenumbers introduced in sec iii b a energy containing interval the outer scale of turbulence k 0 30 cm 1 was taken according to ref 13 where it was estimated as 2 r 0 with r 0

mw s 2 vertical solid lines denote the outer scale k 0 columns by vertical black thin solid lines the range k k 0 can be interpreted as an energy containing in terval where energy is pumped into the system due to instabilities of mean flow in the channel and in which the most of the flow energy is localized as we see this value corresponds well to a boundary between the large scale behavior and the inertial like scaling behavior of the spectra for large heat fluxes while for low heat fluxes and low temperature the energy containing interval seems to extend to higher wavenumbers b cascade dominated interval next characteristic scale k cf table i column 9 estimates the wavenumber for which the decoupling function d k 1 2 for k k d k 1 2 and the energy dissipation by the mutual friction is relatively weak in this k range the main mechanism responsible for the energy trans fer over scales is the richardson kolmogorov energy cas cade similar to that in classical turbulence nevertheless the energy dissipation by the mutual friction cannot be fully ignored therefore the energy spectra in this range of scales are steeper than the k 41 scaling as is clearly seen in figs 1 middle column all these motivate us to name the wavenumber range k 0 k k as cascade dominated interval it was suggested in ref 17 to characterize the appar ent scaling of the otherwise not scale invariant spectra by calculation of a mean exponent over some interval of scales the theoretical mean exponents over a first decade m 10 were found to agree with the experimen tal exponents 13 of the structure functions 17 we calcu lated the mean exponents over a k range k 30 300 a decade in k k 0 and collected them in tablei col umn 14 these values are close to n 1 where n is apparent scaling exponent of s 2 y y n defined by eq 7 d this means that the idea to estimate m 10 via n 1 indeed works reasonably well the corresponding fits are shown in fig 1 middle column as dashed colored lines however although the values of the mean expo nents agree with the scaling of the structure functions the actual scaling of the spectra is different to estimate the apparent scaling exponents mc of the energy spectra e k k mc in the cascade dominated interval we plot the experimental spectra compensated by kmc and choose the value of mc so as to maximize 9 the k range where kmce k const the resulting plots are shown in fig 1 right column where the crossover scales k are shown by vertical dashed colored lines it is remarkable that except for the low heat fluxes at t 1 65 and 1 85 k the cross over between different scaling regimes of the energy spectra coincide well with k c mutual friction dominated interval for k k where the decoupling function is small and mutual fric tion becomes important in the energy balance 17 the slope of the energy spectra increases significantly from mc 2 0 0 2 to mf 2 9 0 1 the transition be tween two types of behavior is not sharp especially for low heat fluxes but clearly visible the power law like behavior e k k mf qualita tively differs from the exponential decay of e k typical for the viscous interval of k in the classical hydrodynamic turbulence therefore we consider this behavior as an evidence that for k k the main mechanism of the energy dissipation is the mutual friction upper limits of the mutual friction dominated interval k are shown in fig 1 right column by vertical dot dashed lines of the corresponding colors as a rule the values of k are about or above the largest available values of k this means that the viscous interval of wavenumbers is beyond our spectral resolution the corresponding y are shown in the fig 1 left column and are mostly smaller than the implied boundary between the inertial and viscous behavior 13 i e black vertical thin solid lines there fore only at the smallest scales the viscous dissipation becomes important but it is still not dominant as we show below 3 more about connection between s 2 y and e k to clarify the relation between the energy spectra in a finite k range and the structure functions we plot in fig 2 a a piecewise linear model of the energy spectra consisting of e k k mc in the cascade dominated in terval k 0 k k continuously connected with the e k k mf part in the mutual friction dominated in terval k k k we used the typical values of mc and the same values of mf 3 0 k 200 cm 1 and k 1300 for all spectra for simplicity we adopt for the energy containing interval the same behavior e k k mc as in the cascade dominated interval the struc ture functions computed using eq 7 d are shown in fig 2 b together with the expected slope s 2 y y n with n mc 1 shown by the dashed lines as we see the actual range of scales over which the original scaling is recovered is very narrow the slope s 2 y y 2 typical for viscous exponential decay of e k in the classical hydrodynamic turbulence and e k k 3 typical for the mutual friction domi nated interval in counterflow turbulence are shown by black dot dashed line as expected for the finite scaling interval of a modest extent the resulting y dependence of s 2 y demonstrates very smooth transition between these regimes and does not reach the genuine asymptotic behavior s 2 y y 2 d comparison of analytically predicted and experimental energy spectra it is instructive to compare directly the experimental spectra with the spectra predicted by theory 17 remind that the theory does not describe the largest scales mo tion in the energy containing interval for k k 0 and has the energy influx for k k 0 or the boundary con dition e 0 e th k 0 as an external parameter of the theory the theory was developed for an idealized situation of fully developed space homogeneous turbulence natu rally the real physical situation in the experiments i e wall bounded space inhomogeneous channel flow for rel atively low reynolds numbers is more complicated than assumed by the theory therefore the comparison is meaningful only for the experiment with relevant flow conditions in our case we may take the ren 100 as a tentative criterion for the well developed turbulence in the channel this leaves out the low temperature data t 1 65 k as well as lowest heat fluxes for t 1 85 and 2 0 k however we keep for completeness all the data for t 1 85 k and 2 0 k in figs 3 we compare the experimental k 41 compensated energy spectra for t 1 85 k 2 0 k and 2 1 k plotted as solid colored lines with the predicted energy spectra denoted by dashed lines of the same color calculated for the same temperatures and the same heat fluxes the theoretical spectra were made di mensional and eth k 0 was taken to ensure overlap in the cascade dominated k range for high heat fluxes these values agree well with eexp k 0 the immediate observation is a qualitative agree ment between the experimental and theoretical spectra over large range of wavenumbers covering most of the cascade dominated range the deviations are mostly limited to the spectra with the lowest heat fluxes for t 2 0 k and t 2 1 k at t 1 85 k the agree ment is recovered for wavenumbers larger than k 0 which may indicate that the turbulence in these experiments is not yet fully developed and the outer scale is smaller that expected as mentioned above the overall suppression of the spectra compared to the classical behavior is well cap tured by the mean scaling exponents m 10 cf tablei column 14 on the other hand the theory does not describe the sharp drop of the spectra in the mutual friction dominated k range demonstrating only smooth decrease of the current slope m k of the spectra for large k a possible reason is that the theory 17 does not take into account the energy exchange between components that is most efficient in this range of scale

marked y 0 2 and y 0 5 respectively these values are slightly larger than typical for the classical hydrodynamic turbulence i e 0 14 and 0 38 in ref 27 however for y y the effective slopes of f 4 y and f 6 y strongly increase and become much larger than the classical values see the dashed lines marked as y 0 5 and y 1 4 respectively the vertical thin lines in all panels denote positions of the outer scale y 0 and the crossover scale y theory may contribute to this discrepancy also the experimental data in the high k regime may not be very reliable indeed this is because the corresponding separation scale is comparable or even smaller than the width of the tracer line which leads to large uncertainty e flatness hyper flatness and intermittency to analyze higher order statistics and possible in termittency effects we select one example at each temperature having similar y and plot in fig 4 the structure functions y 2 3 s 2 y the flatness f 4 y s 4 y s 2 2 y and the hyper flatness

gaussian statistics f 4 3 and f 6 15 shown in figs 4 b and c as horizontal dashed lines clearly for large scales y y 0 f 4 y and f 6 y are close to the gaussian values indicating that the statistics of the turbulent velocity field in the energy containing interval is indeed close to gaussian this is a common property of classical hydrodynamic turbulence indepen dent of the way of its excitation in a wide interval of scales y y y 0 covering scales corresponding to both the cascade dominated and mutual friction dominated spectral ranges both f 4 y panel b and f 6 y panel c have a power law like behavior fn y y x 1 n with exponents x 1 4 0 20 0 02 and x 1 6 0 5 0 03 to compare these expo nents with their counterparts x ht n in the classical hydro dynamic turbulence remind that x ht n ht n n ht 2 2 where ht n is the scaling exponent of the n order struc ture function in classical hydrodynamic turbulence with the most recent experimental values 27 ht 2 0 72 ht 4 1 30 and ht 6 1 78 this gives x ht 4 0 14 and x ht 6 0 38 we conclude that the values x 1 4 6 are moder ately but distinctly larger than ht n notably the struc ture functions and higher order statistics is not sensitive to the peculiarities of the energy spectra in particular to the existence of two significantly different scaling ranges however at smaller scales y y the effective slopes of f 4 y and f 6 y increase dramatically the esti mates shown in figs 4 b and c give x 2 4 0 5 0 1 and x 2 6 1 4 0 1 at these scales which correspond to the dissipative range with mixed contributions of the mutual friction and viscous dissipations the statistics become very intermittent the fact that we do not ob serve saturation of f 4 y and f 6 y typical for the vis cous range in the classical turbulence supports our con jecture that the viscous dissipation dominant range is be yond our resolution iv conclusion in this paper we report a detailed analysis of the energy spectra second and high order structure func tions of velocity differences in the superfluid 4 he coun terflow turbulence measured in a wide range of temper atures and heat fluxes in particular we discover two 11 ranges of wavenumbers ky with very different apparent exponents of the one dimentional energy spectra in the cascade dominated for relatively small ky and the mu tual friction dominated subintervals respectively the general behavior of the experimental spectra exz ky in the cascade dominated range agrees well with the pre dicted energy spectra in ref 17 the analysis of the statistics of the high order struc ture functions shows that in the energy containing in terval the statistics of counterflow turbulence is close to gaussian similar to the classical hydrodynamic turbu lence in the cascade and mutual friction dominated intervals we found some modest enhancement of inter mittency with respect of its level in classical turbulence however at small scales but not yet viscous scales the intermittency becomes much stronger than that in the classical turbulence in conclusion we should remind that the theory de veloped in ref 17 does not describe the experimental observations reported here in all details besides the ob vious reason of space inhomogeneity especially impor tant for modest available reynolds numbers ren there is one more possible reason for some disagreement even in the ren limit this is the anisotropy of statistics of counterflow turbulence although we do not have yet experimental information how strong the anisotropy of turbulent statistics is this effect is definitely there due to presence of preferred uns direction and strong depen dence of the cross correlation function ens k between the normal fluid and superfluid velocity components on the angle between uns and k predicted in ref 21 the study the effect of anisotropy on the statistics of counter flow turbulence is in our nearest agenda nevertheless the reasonable agreement between our observations and the theory 17 is encouraging in particular the crossover scales between different regimes predicted by the theory using macroscopic parameters of the flow and clearly ob served in the spectra and structure functions
