pasadena california 91109 8099 usa dated october 25 2021 standard quantum limit sql of a classical mechanical force detection results from quantum back action impinged by the meter on a probe mechanical transducer perturbed by the force of interest in this paper we introduce a technique of continuous broadband back action avoiding measurements for the case of a resonant signal force acting on a linear mechanical oscillator sup porting one of mirrors of an optical michelson sagnac interferometer msi the interferometer with the movable mirror is an opto mechanical transducer able to support polychromatic probe field the method involves a dichromatic optical probe resonant with the msi modes and having frequency separation equal to the mechanical frequency we show that analyzing each of the harmonics of the probe reflected from the mechanical system separately and postprocessing the measurement results allows excluding the back action in a broad frequency band and measuring the force with sensitivity better than sql i introduction optical transducers are frequently used for observa tion of mechanical motion they allow measuring dis placement speed acceleration and rotation of mechan ical systems mechanical motion can change frequency amplitude and phase of the probe light that is processed to obtain information about the motion the measure ment sensitivity can be extremely high for instance a relative mechanical displacement orders of magnitude smaller than a proton size can be detected this fea ture is utilized in gravitational wave detectors 1 6 in magnetometers 7 8 and in torque sensors 9 11 the fundamental sensitivity limitations of the mea surement always were of interest one of the limits re sults from the fundamental thermodynamic fluctuations of the probe mechanical system the absolute position detection is restricted due to the nyquist noise however this obstacle can be removed if one intends to measure a variation of the position not its absolute value the thermal noise does not limit sensitivity of the measure ment that occurs much faster than the system ringdown time another limitation comes from the quantum noise of the meter on one hand the accuracy of the measure ments of the observables of the meter is restricted because of their fundamental quantum fluctuations represented by the shot noise for the optical probe wave on the other hand the sensitivity is impacted by the perturbation of the state of the probe mass due to the mechanical action of the meter on the mass this effect is called quantum back action in the case of optical meter the mechanical perturbation results from the pressure of light interplay between these two phenomena results in so called stan dard quantum limit sql 12 13 of the measurement sensitivity the value of the sql depends on the measurement system as well as the measurement strategy and measure ment observable in the case of the detection of a classical force acting on a mechanical probe mass the sql can be avoided in a configuration supporting opto mechanical velocity measurement 14 15 the limit also can be sur passed using opto mechanical rigidity 16 17 prepara tion of the probe light in a nonclassical state 18 24 as well as detection of a variation of a strongly perturbed optical quadrature 25 27 curbs the quantum back ac tion and lifts sql the back action and sql can avoided with coherent quantum noise cancellation 28 30 as well as compensation using an auxiliary medium with nega tive nonlinearity 31 optimization of the detection scheme by utilizing a few optical frequency harmonics as a probe allows beating the sql of a force detection the technique was introduced forty years ago 32 33 and then expanded to various measurement configurations 34 38 additionally us age of a dichromatic optical probe in a resonant optical transducer may lead to observation of such phenomena as negative radiation pressure 39 40 optical quadrature dependent quantum back action 25 27 41 42 as well as mechanical velocity dependent interaction 14 15 all these phenomena are useful for back action suppression noncommutativity between the probe noise and the quantum back action noise is the reason for sql in a simple displacement sensor the probe noise is represented by the phase noise of light and the back action noise de pends on the amplitude noise of light the signal is con tained in the phase of the probe the relative phase noise decreases with optical power the relative back action noise increases with the power the signal to noise ratio optimizes at a specific power value the optimal mea surement sensitivity corresponds to sql because phase and amplitude quantum fluctuations of the same wave do not commute it is not possible to measure the amplitude noise and subtract it from the measurement result in this paper we suggest a measurement procedure that allows post processing of the measurement result ar x iv 2 10 5 02 53 2 v 1 qu an t ph 6 m ay 2 02 1 2 and subtracting the quantum back action contribution the measurement takes advantage of usage of a dichro matic optical probe in a resonant displacement trans ducer we show that the signal results in modification of the power distribution between the spectral components of the probe while the back action is proportional to the total power of the probe harmonics fundamentally the power difference and total power can be measured inde pendently as the result the quantum back action can be removed from the measurement result by post processing of the measurement results in the measurement procedure the probe mass is strongly perturbed in this way the technique has simi lar spirit with the variational approach leading to accu rate measurement of a variation of a quantum systems in spite of the strong perturbation of the system parameters unlike standard variational measurement the described here technique is broadband the back action can be removed at all spectral frequencies the proposed here technique is especially efficient when the signal force is resonant with the mechani cal probe mass suspension in this regime the exter nal force modifies the power redistribution between the probe spectral components most efficiently the varia tional measurement technique based on a monochromatic probe light does not perform well in this case the paper is organized as follows the physical model of the measurement system is introduced in section ii the mean amplitudes of the system parameters the quantum fluctuations and associated noise components are studied in section iii the optimal sensitivity of the measurement is also found in this section the impact of the parasitic sidebands is analyzed in section iv section v concludes the paper ii physical model let us consider an opto mechanical system consisting of two externally pumped optical modes coupled with each other and with a mechanical oscillator fig 1 the difference between the optical mode frequencies is equal to the frequency of the mechanical oscillator in what follows we show feasibility of the broadband detection of a small signal force acting on the mechanical oscillator while keeping sensitivity of the measurement better than the sql the opto mechanical system can be realized in a ring cavity with coupled clockwise and counterclockwise modes the uncoupled modes are frequency degenerate let us assume that their frequency is equal to 0 intro ducing a membrane inside the cavity see fig 1 removes degeneracy and frequencies of the modes split so called coherent coupling 43 0 0 2 1 where splitting factor depends on transparency of the membrane as well as on its position parameter is a m 0 m c 1 c 2 e 1 f 2 e 2 f 1 a 1 a 2 x m 2 m 1 l 1 l 2 b 2 b 1 r

complex value specific feature of coherent coupling is such that the absolute value of depends on optical parameters of the membrane and phase of depends on the membrane position 43 another example of a scheme enabling the back action evading measurement is the michelson sagnac interfer ometer msi shown in fig 2 the system also has two degenerate modes if the position of a perfectly reflect ing mirror m is fixed one msi mode characterized with frequency is given by a light wave which travels be tween m 1 and bs the light is split on the bs and after reflection from mirror m returns exactly to m 1 it does not propagate to m 2 the other mode characterized with frequency is represented by a wave which trav els from m 2 to bs and after reflection from m returns to m 2 and does not propagate to m 1 the frequencies of the modes are controlled by variation of path distances 1 2 variation of the position of mirror m provides coupling between the modes mirror m is a test mass of the mechanical oscillator with mass m and eigenfrequency m a main assumptions let us consider scheme shown in fig 2 we assume that the relaxation rates of the eigen modes are identical and characterized

describes thermal noise and the last one stands for the quantum measurement noise shot noise the quantum measurement noise decreases with the power increase the back action term is absent it worth noting that the thermal noise term is present in any opto mechanical detection scheme it can exceed the measurement error related to the measurement ap paratus rather significantly however a proper measure ment procedure allows to suppress this noise and also exclude the initial quantum uncertainty associated with the mechanical system the main requirement for such a measurement is fast interrogation time which should be much shorter than the ring down time of the mechanical system this is possible if the measurement bandwidth exceeds the bandwidth of the mechanical mode sensi tivity of narrowband resonant measurements is usually limited by the thermal noise instead of the amplitude quadratures one can measure sum and differences of the phase quadratures solving set 3 18 d 3 18 e

of quadra tures with arbitrary parameter b b a cos b sin 3 28 a b b a cos b sin 3 28 b the sum b b is not disturbed by the mechanical motion but contains the term proportional to the back action force whereas the difference b b contains the term proportional to mechanical motion with back action and signal the back action term can be mea sured and subtracted from the force measurement result iv parasitic back action fluctuation force acting on the mechanical oscillator is proportional to cross product c c c c of the probe modes in means that the fluctuation fields character ized with fourier amplitude c c 2 m centered at frequencies in the vicinity of 2 m and fourier amplitude c c 2 m centered at frequency in the vicinity of 2 m see fig 3 con tribute to the ponderomotive fluctuation force impinged by the light on the mirror we marked with a tilde these complex amplitudes of the input and output waves for the sake of shortness we neglected by these harmonic in the analysis above because the amplitude of the har monics can be small in what follow we take them into account and find the limitations they introduce for the proposed here measurement strategy 6 x b b 2 m b b 2 m a a b b a a

side bands provide additional terms to the ex pressions of the optical fields for instance 3 21 should be rewritten as comb a a kg a m i i 2 k m i 2 mqa fs 4 1 where noise term g a defined by c 9 at condition 2 2 is approximately equal to g a 2 m a a 4 2 see details in appendix c for details the back action created by the parasitic side bands limits sensitivity of the measurements instead of 3 23 we obtain a corrected expression for the single sided power spectral density that can be presented as sf 2 m 2 nt 1 2 m 2 k k 2 2 4 2 m 2 m 2 nt 1 2 2 2 m ssql f 4 3 while the sensitivity still can be less than sql at conditions 2 2 the sensitivity becomes limited after the probe power reaches the optimal value found from eq 4 3 k 2 4 2 m 2 m 2 2 2 ksql 2 4 4 where ksql corresponds the optimal power value needed to reach sql in the system the impact of the parasitic harmonics can be reduced if one is able to measure b b 2 m as well as b b 2 m independently on the other spectral components of the output light the measurement can be performed if narrow band band pass filters are available the scheme of such a measurement is illustrated by fig 3 measurement of optimally selected quadratures of b allows partial reduction of the parasitic back action described by term g a in 4 1 the reduction factor is r 2 m 1 see details in appendix d it means that in case m 0 and at conditions 2 2 the formula 4 3 will have form sf 2 k k 2 2 16 4 m 2 2 m ssql f 4 5 the sensitivity 4 5 is better than one defined by 4 3 achieved for the case of not suppressed parasitic harmon ics v discussion and conclusion in the transducers shown in the schemes fig 1 and fig 2 the information on the mechanical quadratures transfers to the optical quadratures the measurement of the difference of the optical amplitude quadratures is equivalent to the registration of the mechanical ampli tude quadrature whereas the measurement of the sum of the optical phase quadratures corresponds to the reg istration of mechanical phase quadrature as shown by eq 3 14 this is a peculiar property of the parametric interaction one of the main features of the proposed here measure ment strategy is in the usage of the dichromatic probe field results in the two independent quantum outputs it gives us a flexibility to measure back action separately and then subtract it completely from the measurement result the subtraction can be made in a broad frequency band in contrast in conventional variational measurements 25 27 there is only one quantum output and the back action cannot be measured separately from the signal measurement of the linear combination of the amplitude and phase quadratures in that case allows partial sub traction of the back action only one quadrature of the output wave has to be measured to surpass sql the scheme proposed here allows measurement either of a combination of sum and difference amplitude quadra tures 3 21 or sum and difference of phase quadratures 3 27 generalization 3 28 is also possible these mea surement lead to back action evasion in a broad frequency band we expect that this technique will find a realiza tion in other metrological configurations we propose to use filtration of output waves in order to depress back action due to parasitic side bands experi mental realization of this filtration is not a simple task but it is possible in principle 7 acknowledgments the research of spv and ain has been supported by the russian foundation for basic research grant no 19 29 11003 the interdisciplinary scientific and
