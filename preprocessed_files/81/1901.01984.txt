university 7 9 universitetskaya nab st petersburg 199034 russia dated november 8 2021 an asymptotic approach for a schroedinger type equation with a non selfadjoint slowly varying hamiltonian of a special type is developed the hamiltonian is assumed to be the result of a small perturbation of an operator with a twofold degeneracy turning point which can be diagonalized at this point the non adiabatic transformation of modes is studied in the case where two small parameters are dependent the parameter characterizing an order of the perturbation is a square root of the adiabatic parameter the perturbation of the hamiltonian produces a close pair of simple degeneracy points two regimes of mode transformation for the schroedinder type equation are identified avoided crossing of eigenvalues corresponding to complex degeneracy points and an explicit unavoidable crossing with real degeneracy points both cases are treated by a method of matched asymptotic expansions in the context of a unifying approach an asymptotic expansion of the solution near a crossing point containing the parabolic cylinder functions is constructed and the transition matrix connecting the coefficients of adiabatic modes to the left and to the right of the degeneracy point is derived results are illustrated by an example fermion scattering governed by the dirac equation ifialk gmail com

hamiltonian h may be non selfadjoint born and fock 1 showed in 1928 that under certain conditions on the hamiltonian exact solution can be approximated by a so called adiabatic mode ad with an error o the latter is defined as ad exp i x dx 2 where is an eigenvalue of h of multiplicity one h 3 is a corresponding eigenfunction with appropriate choice of the phase this fact became known as the quantum adiabatic theorem numerous papers have been devoted to generalizations of this theorem see reviews in 2 and 3 the study of adiabatic approximation of solutions of 1 was primarily stimulated by problems of molecular dynamics special attention was paid to cases where adiabatic approximation fails because of local degeneration or almost degeneration of two eigenvalues 1 x 2 x 4 which induces non adiabatic transitions between adiabatic modes taking place near x two small independent parameters rule the problem which is an adiabatic parameter and the parameter characterizing the perturbation which determines the discrepancy between almost degenerating eigenvalues the subject of study in such cases is the transition matrix which connects adiabatic modes at different sides of the degeneracy point it was first studied by landau 4 zener 5 the refined results were obtained by stueckelberg 6 shortly afterwards however mathematically rigorous results came only much later the difficulties arose in particular for such a relation between small parameters that enables exponentially small transitions between modes the account of exponentially small transitions between modes which are given by expansions in powers of small parameter is a complicated problem the first proof of the landau zener formula in the simplest case of dependent small parameters providing the entries of the transition matrix of order unity was given in 7 in the case of arbitrary relation between small parameters the justification of formulas were given in 8 we assume in the present paper that the small parameters are chosen dependent of each other to avoid difficulties of the exponentially small transitions the asymptotic results for eq 1 with a selfadjoint hamiltonian are termed time adiabatic theory or simply adi abatics e g 2 however a small parameter may also exist in stationary schroedinger equation and the relevant asymptotic methods are then named semiclassical or space adiabatic methods generally speaking the stationary equation is a multidimensional one and is not of the form 1 however some semiclassical problems which can be reduced to 1 with the hamiltonian satisfying conditions listed below can be studied in the framework of our formal ism differential equations describing irregular waveguide problems encountered in mechanics and electrodynamics have one variable selected it is the variable along the axis of a waveguide it should be x the differential equations are not normally represented in the form 1 and contain the second derivatives in x but can be reduced to the form 1 for slow enough inhomogeneity they have solutions in the form of 2 named adiabatic as examples of such problems we can mention the problems of wave propagation in elastic or electromagnetic waveguides and in the timoshenko beam adiabatic solutions fail if the phase velocities of two modes have a local point of the degeneration in the field of wave propagation the problems of the description of interaction of modes or transformation of modes or coupling of modes caused by the degeneracy point are analogs of the problems of non adiabatic transitions in quantum mechanics our aim here in particular is to generalize results elaborated in quantum mechanics to aforementioned problems i e we suggest to study physical problems with a slow variation of parameters in one variable but without dissipation as a particular case of 1 but with a non selfadjoint hamiltonian operator to be specific we assume that the non selfadjoint hamiltonian may be factorized h 1 k 5 4 a b figure 1 eigenvalues vs x in arbitrary units the non perturbed eigenvalues are shown by thin lines while the exact ones by thick lines dashed solid lines also blue green on line distinguish modes number 1 and 2 a avoided crossing exact eigenvalues have two complex turning points b unavoidable crossing exact eigenvalues have two real turning points with selfadjoint operators k and all the conditions on h are scrutinized in section ii a then eq 1 is reduced to the form k i x x 6 in this case for construction of adiabatic modes 2 we can use the same which now can be considered as eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a linear selfadjoint operator pencil k 7 basing on 6 we can study problems of mechanics or electrodynamics by analogy with time adiabatic methods of quantum mechanics the degeneracy points often named the turning points in the semiclassical theory and points of avoided crossing of energy levels are then all treated on the same footing at first time the equation 6 was applied to an anisotropic electromagnetic waveguide in the monography 9 where the operator k was a matrix differential operator with respect to variables transverse to x equation 6 has been already used by the some of us in several applied problems dealing with asymptotics near degeneracy points of different types for maxwell equations in the earth ionosphere waveguide 10 with a non invertible maxwell equations in curvilinear coordinates near the smooth boundary of the convex body 11 the timoshenko beam equations 12 and elastic wave equations 13 it was also applied to investigation of liquid crystals 14 the dirac equation for quasiparticles in graphene is given in the form of 6 in section iii moreover equation 6 may be used in the framework of pt symmetric quantum mechanics with playing the role of p symmetry operator see 15 and reference therein one of the advantages of the formulation of all these problems in form 6 is that it allows for a clear and intuitive physical interpretation of processes of non adiabatic transitions indeed 6 possesses a conservation law const 8 where generally speaking the quadratic form is not positively defined for problems of wave propagation it has a meaning of conservation of the time averaged flux of energy see the literature cited above then all modes can be divided into two groups depending on the sign of this constant ones carrying energy to a degeneracy point and others away from it such interpretation of the direction of mode propagation often does not coincide with that based on the sign of the phase velocity of modes the problems of constructing of asymptotic solutions as 0 in the presence of degeneracy points for the odes of second order and their generalizations to systems of odes has been studied in many papers see the books and reviews 16 17 18 19 20 and references therein all the methods applied to investigation of degeneracy points can be divided into three groups first ones are the uniform methods which work both in the vicinity of degeneracy points and away from them see 21 22 23 the second group comprises methods based on the fourier representation of the unknown function such as the maslov method 24 25 and the microlocal analysis 26 methods based on local considerations in the vicinity of the degeneracy point with further matching of local solutions with adiabatic ones constitute the third group there is the method of matched asymptotic expansions 20 27 also called the boundary layer method 28 in the field of nonadiabatic transitions it was applied in 7 this is the method we apply in the 5 present paper the same method was used in our previous papers 10 12 13 11 although it was not always written explicitly where different asymptotic situations for waveguide problems were considered methods of distinguishing different types of asymptotic solutions also vary greatly for simplest differential equation of the second order the asymptotic solutions near the degeneracy point depend on the type of the x dependence of eigenvalues for a system of ordinary differential equations k is a matrix and for more general cases where k is a differential operator some information about eigenfunctions is also necessary to build the classification of asymptotic cases different approaches have been suggested in the literature for equation in the form of 1 with a non selfadjoint hamiltonian the most typical cases were analyzed in 29 30 in assumption that a so called model equation is known however a recipe of reducing a concrete problem to a model equation was not suggested the type of singularity of the adiabatic coupling function should be prescribed in 31 32 for classification of asymptotic cases a detailed classification of points of level crossing in terms accepted in molecular dynamics is given in 33 in our opinion the reduction of a problem to 6 enables an easier classification of asymptotic cases in terms of the matrix elements of k and one of the typical cases is considered in the present paper we assume that the operator k x is the result of a perturbation of an operator with a single degeneracy point which is a point of crossing of two eigenvalues it is well known that if is an identity matrix the crossing of eigenvalues turns under perturbation to an avoided crossing it is a typical case for non adiabatic transitions described by landau zener formula however introducing we expanded the class of problems the connection formulas should be revisited and transition matrix should be generalized a perturbation of operator with two eigenvalues crossing may cause now not only avoided crossing but unavoidable crossing too moreover the knowledge of eigenvalues behavior for example crossing or avoided crossing is not sufficient for unique determination of the transition matrix it is crucial whether there are two independent eigenfunctions at x 0 in other words if the restriction of the operator 1 k to invariant subspace corresponding to 1 x 2 x is diagonalizable or an eigenfunction and its associated particular cases of the treatment of the degeneracy points with linear independent eigenfunctions were presented in 11 12 34 and ones with linear dependent eigenfunctions in 13 here we consider the former case we construct an inner and an outer formal asymptotic expansions show that the domains of their validity intersect and match them to find the transition matrix the obtained expansions are asymptotic solutions see subsection iv a 2 iv b 1 the outer expansion is the adiabatic one which is well known for the selfadjoint hamiltonians and was discussed for the non selfadjoint ones in 17 for linear systems of ordinary equations and in 35 for systems with large dissipation the equations for the leading term of the inner expansion can be interpreted as the model equation of 29 30 we show also that under the assumptions listed in section ii a these expansions are formal solutions of the equation 6 our main aim is to suggest studying asymptotics of 6 for problems of mode transformation in waveguide problems some of which were already studied by us we give here one new example of the problem for the dirac equation in the simplest case where transverse to direction of propagation momentum is dependent on the adiabatic parameter we intend to give example of elastic waveguides in the further paper ii statement of the problem and main result a statement of the problem we study asymptotic solutions of the following equation k x x i x x k x k x b x 9 in the hilbert space we assume that k x b x and its inverse are operators that are selfadjoint for real x the latter two of them are supposed to be bounded as well as k x k 0 for simplicity we consider independent on x this condition may be removed but it is satisfied in all practical cases known to the authors we introduce two crucial assumptions concerning eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the spectral problem k x x x x 10 and an additional third assumption which can be relaxed note that eigenvalues of 10 can be both real and complex while eigenfunctions are orthogonal see appendix b for more details 1 two eigenvalues of 10 1 x and 2 x are degenerating at a single point x 0 and they stay real on the whole interval the point x 0 is a degeneracy point of a crossing type i e 2 x 1 x x 0 2 qx q 0 11 6 here q does not depend on q 1 as 0 and both 1 and 2 are separated from the rest of the spectrum of 10 if any with a gap independent on 2 the operator 1 k is diagonalizable in the invariant subspace corresponding to 1 0 2 0 3 operator families k x k 0 and b x are holomorphic in some domain including an interval containing x 0 we will use the following consequences of the third assumption see for example 36 a operators k x k 0 and b x can be expanded in the taylor series with bounded operator coefficients b the eigenvalues j x are holomorphic and can be expanded in the taylor series c the eigenfunctions j x are holomorphic and can be defined at x 0 by continuity the obtained eigen functions 1 0 2 0 are orthogonal 1 0 2 0 0 j 0 lim x 0 j x j 1 2 12 our aim is to construct asymptotic outer inner expansions outside inside the neighborhood of the point x 0 the outer expansion we also call adiabatic one or adiabatic mode after that we seek the transition matrix connecting two sets of adiabatic solutions at both sides of the point x 0 we estimate the terms of obtained expansions and find conditions for them to have an asymptotic nature the straightforward consequence of these estimates is the fact that obtained expansions are asymptotic solutions we call n a x an asymptotic solution of order n in powers of a small parameter 0 on an interval of x if it satisfies 9 up to the terms of order o n i e k n a i n a x o n 13 uniformly with respect to x if a partial sum of an asymptotic series is an asymptotic solution of order n for any n then we call the series an asymptotic solution b main result our mains result is based on construction of the adiabatic solution of 9 which is performed in close analogy to the case of the self adjoint schroedinger equation 1 see section iv a our construction differs from the standard one by two facts first k is itself a function of the small parameter i e k k x see 9 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of 1 k denoted and respectively also depend on and are found by the perturbation method from the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of 1 k in sections c 1 c 2 therefore we find asymptotic solution as expansion in terms of but not second feature is the presence of in the right hand side of 9 which permits to express the eigenelements of the adjoint problem as the leading order term the asymptotic solution of order n 0 reads 0 j aj j x nj x 1 2 exp i x re j x imsjj x dx j 1 2 14 where aj j 1 2 are arbitrary constants adiabatic modes generally speaking differ on both sides of the point x 0 and the subscript indicates the side where the mode is constructed we note that the leading term 14 depends on non perturbed eigenfunctions j see 10 and perturbed eigenvalues j the normalization factor nj x and the diagonal conversion coefficient sjj x are defined as nj x j x j x 15 skj x k d j dx nk 16 where the scalar product is that inherent from the hilbert space in which k acts coefficients sjj x are connected with the berry phase 7 the choice of the lower limits of integration in 14 influences the arbitrary constants we take these limits equal to real parts of the degeneracy points for the perturbed operator 1 k which are as follows b b 12 n 1 n 2 ei 1 sgn n 1 n 2 4 d 2 1 dx x 0 b 1 d 2 1 dx b 22 n 2 b 11 n 1 x 0 17 where bij x i x b x j x j i 1 2 18 see details about the degeneracy points in section c 2 such choice of the lower limit is convenient although adiabatic solutions themselves are not applicable in the o vicinity of re as we will see later however calculating the integral of the eigenvalue j over this region is possible and to this end we find the expansion of eigenvalues j in appendix c the sum of the first terms of expansions of eigenvalues contributing the leading order term of the adiabatic mode is denoted main in the further text after these preliminary remarks and definitions we are able to formulate our main result which concerns the matching of adiabatic modes theorem 1 let k k b and eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 1 k meet the conditions stated in section ii a then the equation 9 has an asymptotic solution of order 0 that has the following representations in terms of adiabatic modes to the left and to the right of the turning point x 0 k 1 0 1 k 2 0 2 if x 1 2 k 1 0 1 k 2 0 2 if x 1 2 19 0 and the complex constants k j j 1 2 are connected by the transition matrix t k 1 k 2 t k 1 k 2 t ei i 2 ei 2 ln 1 2 e i 2 ln 1 ei 20 the dimensionless parameter governing the result is as follows i 1 2 q b 12 b 21 n 1 n 2 x 0 q d 2 1 dx x 0 21 if n 1 n 2 1 20 coincides with the landau zener formula however for n 1 n 2 1 20 gives a matrix which does not arise in considerations of self adjoint hamiltonians these two cases describe two qualitatively distinct cases of eigenvalues asymptotics near x 0 avoided crossing with complex turning points fig 1 a and unavoidable crossing with classical turning points fig 1 b two distinct physical processes correspond to these cases the transition matrix is dependent on arbitrary constants aj the form 20 of t corresponds to the following choice of aj aj exp i 1 j a i 2 re b 1 2 dx 22 a arg b 12 n 1 4 1 sgn n 1 n 2 x 0 23 we call the adiabatic modes with such choice of aj the canonical modes it is important to note that although generally speaking nj j 1 2 may vanish in degeneracy points the conditions 1 2 from section ii a ensure that it does not happen it is shown in appendix b iii example dirac equation in 2 1 dimensions the massless dirac equation in 2 1 dimensional space with the external potential u u x y for a stationary wave function eiet x y reads vf p u x y e x y 24 8 where x y is a pair of the pauli 2 2 matrices p i for simplicity we put the fermi velocity equal to one vf 1 one of the physical problems described by 24 is the electron scattering on an electrostatic potential barrier inside graphene 37 if the external potential depends on one variable only u u x we can separate the x derivative in the equation 24 and use the fourier transform for the y dependence x py r dye ipyy x y then the case where the electrons are incident almost perpendicularly to the potential barrier can be studied 38 39 the interest in this case was invoked by the so called klein paradox 40 present in graphene which is characterized by the unit probability of tunneling through the barrier for applications in graphene see 41 close to normal scattering of electrons on a potential is characterized by small values of py in particular if we assume that py is of order py p p o 1 then we write 24 in the form 9 k b i x 25 with the hermitian operators k e u x 0 0 e u x b 0 ip ip 0 0 1 1 0 26 the operators k b and act in the hilbert space l 2 c 2 the conservation law 8 in this case corresponds to the conservation of the x component of the electron current j 42 due to the fact that x jx 27 and can be both positive and negative the generalized eigenvalue problem k is solved by j 1 j e u x j 1 2 1 1 j j 1 2 28 and the normalization of modes reflects the electric charge current transferred by these modes having opposite signs so in this case we have n 1 n 2 1 29 the degeneracy points x are those where 0 i e e u 30 supposing that on the interval of interest there is only one such point 0 we conclude that all the assumptions of the section ii are satisfied if the potential has a non vanishing first derivative at q u x 6 0 for constructing the canonical modes we calculate the matrix entries b 12 b 21 ip b 11 b 22 0 31 and other necessary ingredients sij 0 q u i p 2 2 q 32 a argb 12 2 0 b 0 33 p q 34 we also note that in this case the eigenvalues are symmetric 1 2 9 the canonical modes are 0 j j x e i x x j x dx 35 the eigenvalues of 1 k are j x 1 j 1 e u x 2 p 2 y j 1 2 36 outside the vicinity of the crossing point x 0 e u 0 we have the expansion j x e u x p 2 2 e u x 37 if x is in the vicinity of the turning points of order o inclusively we get 1 x q sgnx x 2 p 2 q 2 o 38 2 x 1 x the transition matrix is given by 123 with from above thus our method can be applied readily to the description of the nearly normal scattering of electrons on an external potential this case was investigated successfully in 38 39 by a different method and it is a straightforward task to verify that our result for the transition matrix is in agreement with theirs we have an assumption that is of order one but result is valid for any iv asymptotic derivation a adiabatic outer expansion to proceed with resolving the connection problem via the method of matched asymptotic expansions in this section we construct adiabatic or outer expansions away from the degeneracy points of the original equation k k b i x 39 1 construction of adiabatic expansion we search for an adiabatic expansion of a solution of 39 in the form of x x e i x x dx 40 both and are given by formal series in powers of respecting the order of magnitude of the perturbation x 0 x 1 x 2 x 41 x 0 1 x 2 x 42 the standard adiabatic approximation contains only an expansion of while we also introduce the second expansion in the phase factor we are entitled to impose an additional condition 0 n 0 n 1 43 it fixes the arbitrariness of possible multiplication of the whole ansatz 40 by an arbitrary series in this condition makes the representation 40 42 unique as we will see in the sequel it also guarantees that the amplitude factor depends on the local properties of the medium only while all the integral nonlocal ones are contained in the phase factor 10 following the perturbation method we insert 41 42 into 39 equating the coefficients at equal powers of we obtain a sequence of equations k 0 0 0 44 k 0 1 b 0 1 0 45 k 0 2 b 2 2 0 1 1 i x 0 46 k 0 n b n 1 n 0 n 1 i 1 i n i i x n 2 47 aiming at constructing the first mode we choose as the solution of the principal order equation 44 the first eigenfunction of k and corresponding eigenvalue 0 1 1 0 1 1 48 we solve equations 45 46 and 47 step by step all these equations are solvable if their right hand sides are orthogonal to the solution of the homogeneous equation 44 this condition with account of 43 and 48 yields 1 1 b 11 n 1 2 1 1 b 1 1 i 1 x 1 n 1 49 n 1 1 b n 1 1 i 1 x n 2 1 n 1 n 2 50 we recall here that the eigenvalues j j 1 2 are assumed real taking into account 43 we write the higher order approximations in the form n 1 c n 12 2 n 1 n 1 51 where c n 12 is a scalar function of x and n 1 is orthogonal to 1 and 2 j n 1 0 j 1 2 52 in the following sections we consider the degeneracy between 1 and 2 so we separate the term proportional to 2 because it contains the main singularity where 2 is close to 1 see section iv a 2 to find n 1 we substitute 51 into 47 calculate its scalar product with 2 take into account 52 and the orthogonality properties of eigenfunctions see appendix b we find c 1 12 b 21 1 2 n 2 53 c n 12 2 b n 1 1 n 2 n 1 i 1 i 1 c n i 12 i 2 x n 2 1 1 2 n 2 n 2 54 to complete the construction of the adiabatic solution we need to deduce the orthogonal component n 1 n 1 2 however as we shall see in the next section it does not influence the transformation of the modes at least in the principal order thus we only need to show the possibility of its determination to prove that the recurrent system 44 47 can indeed be solved step by step we rewrite equation 47 as follows k 1 n 1 f n 55 where f n is the right hand side of 47 in view of the assumption of the presence of a finite gap between j j 1 2 and the rest of the spectrum and the fact that f n is orthogonal to j j 1 2 equation 55 has a single solution n 1 see appendix a property 5 thus all the terms of the formal series can be constructed in the case of a purely discrete spectrum of k the first order approximation 1 1 has the form of 1 1 j 6 1 2 c 1 1 j j j 6 1 2 bj 1 1 j nj j 56 11 where the summation ranges all the modes except for the first two in the o approximation we have 1 1 o h 1 2 exp i 1 i x x main 1 x s 11 dx o h 1 2 57 where 1 is a constant phase factor main 1 x reads main 1 1 b 11 n 1 b 21 b 12 1 2 n 1 n 2 1 b 1 1 n 1 58 it comprises the first terms of expansion of the eigenvalue 1 in powers of which is valid in the area of applicability of adiabatic modes and which is found in appendix c in c 8 the coefficients sij were defined in 16 the imaginary part of sjj is the berry phase 43 while its real part fixes the normalization of the whole solution indeed for smooth nj nj x we find re sjj x j j j x j 2 j j 1 2 x ln j j 59 and thus upon integration and exponentiation in 57 at the upper limit of integration it gives exactly n 1 x 1 2 and a constant at the lower one so that the principal order of the adiabatic mode 40 is 0 1 e i 1 n 1 x 1 2 1 x n 1 x 1 2 exp i x x main 1 x dx i x x ims 11 x dx 60 thus it can be made normalized 1 1 1 o assuming the eigenfunctions are normalized in x the overall sign of the normalization factor 1 1 however cannot be fixed and represents intrinsic properties of solution it is shown in appendix b property 4 that nj x j 1 2 is not equal to zero the structure of the amplitude guarantees that under the transformation j ei j j j 1 2 it maps in the same way j ei j j and at the same time the berry phase x ims 11 dx develops an opposite contribution under the same phase shift if j is not constant j j x x x ims 11 dx j e i j j 1 x 1 x x x ims 11 dx 61 so the only ambiguity left in definition of j is an overall constant phase factor it can be interpreted purely in terms of the lower limit of integration x but for simplicity of further analysis we introduced an additional parameter 1 we call the formal series constructed here the adiabatic expansion or adiabatics the principal term of the expansion is named the adiabatic approximation or adiabatic mode the other solution 2 is obtained by simply interchanging the indices 1 2 2 the validity region of adiabatic solutions and the slow variable all the approximations n j n 1 are of order one if 1 2 is of order one it follows from conditions in section ii a operators b are bounded and norms of eigenfunctions 1 2 and their derivatives are bounded norms of n 1 are also bounded as it follows from appendix b according to 53 54 the higher order terms n j n 1 in expansion of j j 1 2 contain the singularity near the degeneracy point x 0 where 2 0 1 0 we study here how rapidly the degree of singularity increases with the growth of the order of approximation n the first important fact is that main singularity of n j is contained in the term c n 12 2 the second necessary fact is that nj sjk and bjk are of order unity as follows from our assumptions by induction on n it is easy to show that for n 1 it holds n 1 c n 1 12 b 12 n 1 1 xn 1 62 c n 12 c n 1 12 1 2 b 22 n 2 i xc n 2 12 1 2 1 xn 63 12 therefore the higher terms of the expansions 41 42 can be estimated near the degeneracy point as n 2 n x o n 1 2 xn 1 n 2 n o n 2 xn 64 they stay small and thus guarantee the asymptotic nature of expansions 57 for x 1 2 1 2 65 for any 0 this suggests to seek the resonant or inner expansion of 39 in the vicinity of x 0 in terms of the slow or stretched variable x 66 we note that the constructed asymptotic expansion is an asymptotic solution to obtain an asymptotic solution of n th order we need to take partial sums of n terms of expansions 41 42 and insert these sums into 40 then we should substitute the result into the equation 39 and estimate the discrepancy the terms of order up to n are cancelled because of 44 47 and the discrepancy comprises terms from the right hand side of equations of order from n 1 till 2 n which can be estimated as o n as it follows from the reasonings given above we can now analyze the structure of the outer asymptotic expansion in terms of for further constructing ansatz of inner expansion expanding 50 and 54 for small x we deduce 0 p 0 0 p 0 1 2 p 0 2 67 1 p 1 0 p 1 1 2 p 1 2 68 n 2 n n 1 p n 0 p n 1 2 p n 2 n 2 69 n 2 n n u n 0 u n 1 2 u n 2 n 0 70 where p n k and u n k k 1 2 are constant scalars and vectors correspondingly after inserting 67 70 into 41 42 we can collect the terms with the same powers of principal singularities of every term of the adiabatic expansion i e the highest order terms in 1 contribute to the first term of the inner expansion the same is correct for the second terms and so on we will find thus p 0 0 p 0 1 p 1 0 n 2 p n 0 n 2 p 0 2 p 1 1 n 2 p n 1 n 1 3 p 0 3 2 p 1 2 2 n 2 p n 2 n 1 71 n 0 u n 0 n n 0 u n 1 n 2 n 0 u n 2 n 72 upon integration over as required in 40 the first term and the first parenthesis of 71 are non small for any values of 1 while the third and all consecutive are negligible if 0 1 6 73 this defines the area of asymptotic nature of the expansion in term of and thus also the applicability area of the inner solution since such expansion is unique under this condition we can expand the exponent containing the third and higher terms of 71 and obtain the following ansatz of the inner expansion e i b a b d 0 1 2 74 the functions a b and n n 1 2 will be found in section iv b 13 3 canonical modes for the simplification of the further matching procedure and a simpler form of the transition matrix we shall now introduce canonical modes by fixing arbitrary factors in the principal term 60 first of all we note that in its phase x x main 1 dx x x main 1 main 2 2 main 1 main 2 2 dx 75 we can actually choose the lower limit of integration differently for each of terms for it amounts only to a overall constant phase factor in 0 1 as it will be evident from section iv c 2 the most simple form of the transition matrix is obtained for the canonical modes defined as 0 1 e i 1 1 x n 1 x 1 2 exp i 2 x b main 1 main 2 dx i 2 x re main 1 main 2 dx i x re ims 11 x dx 76 the subscript of 0 1 and 1 corresponds to the sign of x i e to the side of the degeneracy point where the above asymptotics is used and are degeneracy points i e 1 2 see details in section c 2 near these points the adiabatic expansion is not valid as we show in section iv a 2 however eigenvalues are integrable we will use below the expansion of 1 which is found in appendix c 2 of which we need terms up to order o inclusively the obtained formula 76 may be written as 14 where main 1 approximates 1 with an error of order o the second mode is obtained by interchanging the subscripts 1 2 the constant phase is given by j 1 j a the choice of j can be simplified if we also fix the phases of j 0 j 1 2 in such a way that b 0 12 n 0 1 b 0 21 n 0 2 77 indeed if we replace 1 0 and 2 0 by e i a 2 1 0 and e i a 2 2 0 respectively b 0 12 is replaced by a real positive quantity for n 1 n 2 0 and by a purely imaginary one for n 1 n 2 0 in both cases a vanishes as follows from 23 for such choice of eigenfunctions we have simply a 0 j 0 78 which we assume in what follows thus we complete the unambiguous definition of the adiabatic modes 76 which we named canonical modes 4 adiabatic modes rearrangement in the matching region for the matching with the inner solution we shall now construct explicitly the principal term of the rearrangement of the adiabatic expansions on the boundary of their validity region 0 1 6 79 for these values of x the re expansion of the phase of

imsjj x dx i b 0 1 av d iq b 2 2 ln 2 q i o 1 2 3 82 where the remainder arose from integration of the higher terms the term containing s 11 is of order o 1 2 we introduce in 82 notation i 2 ln 2 83 taking the principal term of the amplitude factor in 76 we obtain that on the different sides of the degeneracy point the first mode is given by the same formula 0 1 e i b 0 1 av d ei 2 q e i q b 2 4

the first one for the second mode we get 0 2 e i b 0 1 av d e i 2 q ei q b 2 4 2 0 n 0 2 1 2 o 1 2 3 85 we recall that is purely imaginary and the principal terms 84 and 85 are of order one in b inner expansion 1 construction of asymptotic expansion we construct here a formal asymptotic expansion valid in the neighborhood of the degeneracy point and name it the inner or resonance expansion to do this we first express 39 in terms of the slow variable inserting expansions c 12 of k and b into 39 we obtain k 0 k 1 b 0 2 k 2 b 1 i 86 following ansatz 74 its solution can be sought in the form of e i b 0 1 av d 0 1 2 87 where 0 and 1 av are first terms of expansion of 1 2 2 in powers of see details in appendix c in c 19 and c 28 and the phase is chosen to simplify further matching with 84 85 substituting 87 into 86 and equating the coefficients at equal powers of we obtain a sequence of equations k 0 0 0 0 88 k 0 0 1 1 av k 1 b 0 0 i 0 89 k 0 0 2 1 av k 1 b 0 1 2 k 2 b 1 0 i 1 90 15 where the dot marks the derivative with respect to f f the recurrent system 88 90 is solved by analogy with the system obtained by the perturbation method for eigenvalues near degeneracy points and their solutions are given in terms of the same notation see subsection c 2 we note that the equations c 15 c 17 are transformed into 88 90 upon replacing 0 0 1 and 1 by 0 0 1 and 1 av i respectively thus we can repeat the line of argument of subsection c 2 also replacing 0 jk by a 0 k k 1 2 to avoid a conflict of notation thus the principal approximation of the amplitude 0 is given by the formula 0 a 0 1 1 0 a 0 2 2 0 91 where the scalar coefficients a 0 k k 1 2 satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations n 0 1 i 1 av k 1 11 b 0 11 a 0 1 k 1 12 b 0 12 a 0 2 0 k 1 21 b 0 21 a 0 1 n 0 2 i 1 av k

a 0 1 from the second equation in the form of a 0 1 n 0 2 b 0 21 ia 0 2 b qa 0 2 94 and substitute it into the first one to obtain the following equation for a 0 2 a 0 2 b 2 q 2 iq 2 a 0 2 0 95 here e i 4 2 q 96 and is given by 21 we note that in terms of a new variable t b 97 the equation 95 reduces to the parabolic cylinder equation 44 2 t y t 1 2 t 2 4 y t 0 98 where a 0 2 y b the general solution to 98 can be written as a linear combination a 0 2 y b ad b bd b 99 where a and b are arbitrary constants and d is the parabolic cylinder function in the notation of whittaker 45 by using its property 44 td t t 2 d t d 1 t 0 from 94 we derive the expression for the first coefficient in 91 a 0 1 i b 0 12 n 0 1 ad 1 b bd 1 b 100 16 where we took into account that n 0 2 b 0 21 b 0 12 n 0 1 101 using the formulas 87 91 99 100 and 97 we obtain the principal approximation of the inner expansion 0 e i b 0 1 av d o 102 0 ib 0 12 n 0 1 ad 1 t bd 1 t 1 0 ad t bd t 2 0 103 the process of constructing of the inner solution can be continued representing higher approximation as n j 1 2 a n j j 0 n we will obtain at each step the very same system 93 of two differential equations but now for a n j j 1 2 and with nontrivial right hand side the latter will be given by a particular linear combination of a l j j 1 2 l n 1 found on the previous steps after some algebraic transformations the free term can be written as a combination of d 1 t d t with coefficients given by a polynomials in then the solution for a n j j 1 2 is also given by a similar combination after some cumbersome but straightforward manipulations one can show that the relation n 2 n o n 2 3 n 104 holds for higher approximations see appendix e then the validity region of the inner solution is given by 1 6 g 105 with arbitrary small g 0 comparing with the validity region of the adiabatic solution 65 we observe that the intersection of these regions or the matching region is x 1 2 g 0 g 1 6 106 the straightforward consideration shows that the constructed inner expansion is an inner solution 2 inner expansion in the matching region we derive now the principal term of the inner expansion given by 102 103 in the matching region i e on the outskirts of the validity domain as x but 105 is still satisfied the asymptotics of d t is different in different sectors of the complex plane 44 d t t t e t

following observation d b ei arg e 2 b 2 4 o 1 109 is valid for arg 4 or arg 3 4 and here b is a fixed constant we also took into account the fact that for imaginary the second term in 108 is of order

asymptotics to the left of the turning point we fix the arguments so that for negative and b arg b arg e i 4 3 4 arg b 4 taking into account 109 111 for the amplitude of the principal term of the

arg b 3 4 formulas 109 111 in this case yield an asymptotics as 0 i 1 b 0 12 n 0 1 bei 5 4 e 2 b 2 4 1 0 ae i 4 bei 3 4 e 2 b 2 4 2 0 o 1 113 in both cases 102 should be applied for the inner expansion c transition matrix 1 matching of inner and outer expansions the adiabatic solutions j j 1 2 can only be defined at one side of a degeneracy point at a time and by passing over it the transformation of modes generally occurs let the asymptotics as 0 of an exact solution be a linear combination x k 1 1 k 2 2 114 on one side of the degeneracy point say to its left x 0 then the aim of the connection problem is to derive the coefficients of the linear combination on the other side for x 0 x k 1 1 k 2 2 115 as functions of k 1 and k 2 it is solved by the transition matrix t defined by the equality k 1 k 2 t k 1 k 2 116 to obtain it we shall match the inner and outer expansions in the intersection of their validity zones 106 comparing 112 and 113 with 84 and 85 correspondingly we immediately recognize that n 0 2 1 2 0 k 1 0 1 k 2 0 2 117 n 0 2 1 2 0 k 1 0 1 k 2 0 2 118 18 where k 1 i ei aa 1 e i 5 4 e i k 2 aei 3 4 be i 4 ei 119 k 1 i ei ab 1 e i 5 4 e i k 2 ae i 4 bei 3 4 ei 120 and we used that b 0 12 n 0 1 n 0 1 1 2 n 0 2 1 2 ei a 121 which follows from 96 the definition of a 23 and the choice of the branch of the square root as ei 4 sgn n 1 n 2 122 due to the condition 77 we actually have a 0 the formulas 119 120 enable us to find the transition matrix t as a solution of the equation 116 valid for all values of a and b it reads t ei i 2 ei 2 e 2 i 1 2 e i 2 e 2 i 1 ei 123 here we used the identities 1 2 1 e i and 1 sin 1 as it must the obtained transition matrix 123 satisfies general properties discussed in appendix d for any phase factor ei to check this fact one should take into account that 1 1 and 122 2 asymptotics of t and its canonical form first we check the limit of vanishing perturbation 0 we have t 0 1 0 0 1 124 for any choice of and both for the avoided crossing case and real turning points to consider the 1 asymptotics we start with the stirling s formula 44 1 2 e 1 arg 125 from the definition of see 21 it follows that i sgn n 1 n 2 and we obtain 1 2 e 2 ei i ln i 4 sgn n 1 n 2 126 note that arg 1 arg 1 now we may simplify the off diagonal terms t 12 and t 21 of t as follows t 12 e i 2 1 sgn n 1 n 2 1 i e ln 2 i t 21 e 2 sgn n 1 n 2 1 e ln 2 i 127 recalling the choice of the phase factor i 83 as i 2 ln 2 we confirm that for the canonical modes 76 the transition matrix asymptotics for 1 has the simplest possible form indeed t 0 1 1 0 if n 1 n 2 0 t e 1 1 1 1 if n 1 n 2 0 128 19 we interpret the first of the last formulas as follows if 1 and n 1 n 2 0 then the gap between eigenvalues near degeneracy points is large enough that adiabatic approximation found for the whole operator k is valid however the matrix t is not the unit matrix its form reflects the peculiarities of the numbering method and the choice of signs of adiabatic modes 76 for x 0 that we adopted note that the matrix entry 1 can be changed at will by choosing the phase of adiabatic modes but it would also change 124 substituting 83 into 123 we get the final result t ei i 2 ei 2 ln 1 2 e i 2 ln 1 ei 129 note that ei 4 sgn n 1 n 2 we present the matrix t in yet another form writing explicitly the absolute values and arguments of matrix elements to this end we take into account the fact that 1 2 1 2 sinh and obtain t e w 1 e 2 e 2 w 1 ei ei 2 1 w 1 e 2 e 2 w 1 e i e w 130 where w sgnn 1 n 2 and arg 1 131 and is the principal term of the asymptotics of arg 1 for see 126 therefore 0 in this limit the transition matrix t 129 or equivalently 130 between the canonical modes 76 we call canonical transition matrix v conclusions and physical interpretation we developed an asymptotical method and studied in details the transformation of the adiabatic modes for the schroedinger type equation 9 near a pair of degeneracy points of eigenvalues of the corresponding spectral problem the degeneracy points appeared after small perturbation of an operator with just one isolated point of eigenvalues degeneracy the main peculiarity of our statement of the problem is consideration of a linear operator pencil which is a direct generalization of eq 3 to non hermitian hamiltonians of a special type the striking distinction of 9 as compared to schroedinger equation with the self adjoint hamiltonian 1 is the absence of the positive definiteness of the corresponding conservation law which reads const indeed its sign sgn sgn where is an eigenfunction of the spectral problem can take both positive and negative values for problems of wave propagation known to the authors this conserved quantity has the meaning of averaged flux of energy and therefore we called it here the flux the absence of the positive definiteness opens a possibility for description of two situations with the same equation the avoided crossing of perturbed eigenvalues and the unavoidable crossing as well we studied both cases on the same footing by the method of matched asymptotic expansion with a simplifying assumption this assumption concerns small parameters of the problem the adiabatic parameter and the parameter characterizing an order of the perturbation of the operator k which is assumed to be see 9 we found both the adiabatic expansion an outer expansion and the asymptotic expansion near the degeneracy point 102 103 where adiabatic approach is not applicable an inner expansion the transition matrix connecting adiabatic modes 76 to the left and to the right of degeneracy points was presented as well in 129 130 the obtained matrix depends on the constant factors of adiabatic modes which are fixed by 77 the assumption on small parameters helps us to avoid difficulties caused by exponentially small entries of the transition matrix the transition matrix depends only on eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of two degenerating modes and does not depend on the rest of the spectrum as is prescribed by the adiabatic theorem the absolute values of the canonical matrix entries which are responsible for energy transmission are completely determined by perturbed eigenvalues behavior the results obtained coincide with those of landau and zener 4 5 and 7 for the avoided crossing scenario and 38 39 for the two real turning points scenario the only restriction on the choice of modes to obtain the absolute values of the matrix entries is that they should have the same normalization if in addition the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed operator are known at the degeneracy point the phases of adiabatic modes can be fixed by 77 and the phases of the transition matrix entries can be obtained they coincide with those found in 46 47 for the case of an avoided crossing and with 39 for two real turning points 20 the physical interpretation of obtained results depend on the signs of the energy fluxes nj j 1 2 of modes being degenerated if the signs are different we deal with the process of reflection from the degeneracy points neighborhood area and transmission through this area for negative x the mode with positive n is interpreted as an incident mode and the mode with negative n as a reflected one for positive x the mode with positive n is a transmitted mode putting in the definition of the transition matrix 116 k 1 1 k 2 r k 1 t k 2 0 we obtain for the reflection r and transmission t coefficients the following r t 21 t 22 t dett t 22 132 if the modes are canonical 76 the transition matrix 130 for n 1 n 2 1 gives r 1 e 2 e i t e 133 where is defined in 131 if the signs of energy fluxes nj j 1 2 are equal we have the transformation or interaction of adiabatic modes near the degeneracy points for this process the chosen numbering of modes is not the most natural one the perturbed eigenvalues approximating an original one with a given number become nonsmooth functions see c 37 c 38 if we change the numbering of modes on the left of the degeneracy point then the perturbed eigenvalues for large will be continuous and the transition matrix for the new numeration reads t t 0 1 1 0 134 the first mode incident from the left i e k 1 1 k 2 0 in 117 produces two modes on the right of x 0 with k 1 t 11 k 2 t 21 where the corresponding elements of the matrix t are the transmission coefficient t 11 of the first mode and the excitation coefficient t 21 of the second one t 11 1 e 2 ei t 21 e finally a comment on other methods is due the usual way of treating the non hermitian problems consist of dealing with a non hermitian hamiltonian h and constructing biorthogonal bases of eigenfunctions of h and h correspondingly in such approaches the normalization of a solution can always be chosen positive since there is no relation between and presupposed and the latter one can always be supplied with an appropriate phase factor in this case the nature of perturbed degeneracy points either avoided or real crossing of eigenvalues will be invoked is fully defined by the non hermitian perturbation operator b and its matrix elements b the connection of our approach with the aforementioned one follows from the relation which is valid for the non self adjoint hamiltonians factorized as 1 k b we put 1 thus fixing the ambiguity in the definition of the adjoint eigenfunction the advantage of our approach is that the nature of the perturbed degeneracy is revealed by simple comparison of the signs of the normalization of the degenerating modes sgn i i sgn i i i 1 2 we believe that the suggested approach enables one to get the results in a truly transparent manner our consid erations can be generalized to the case where 1 does not exist or is not a matrix but for example a differential operator further generalization of the approach to the multidimensional case i e to the equation of the form of k x y b x y i x x x y y 135 is also possible and is the subject of the future work an example of treatment of 135 for k and independent on x and y is given in 48 the extraction of can also reflect particular symmetries of a given physical problem as is for the dirac equation see 24 another example of the applications of the equation in the form 9 is the case of pt symmetric quantum mechanics with playing the role of a p symmetry operator see 15 we shall note that some aspects of the presence of degeneracy points also called exceptional ones 49 50 were considered e g in 51 52 however only the case of complex degeneracy points i e avoided crossing were dealt with since the presence of real degeneracy points would signal entering the broken p symmetry region considering the transition of a quantum system through such a region is yet another application of the general method presented here 21 acknowledgments this work was supported in part i v f by grant 2012 22426 7 sa o paulo research foundation fapesp m v p grant rfbr 17 02 00217 appendix a auxiliary general facts we give here some general facts from 36 formulated for our case and prove two lemmas for our operator 1 k where k and are selfadjoint and 1 are bounded we can construct a projection p to the invariant subspace m ph corresponding to an isolate part of the spectrum in our case consists of a single eigenvalue or a pair of degenerating eigenvalues separated from the other spectrum with a gap all the hilbert space h is split into the direct sum h m m a 1 where m i p h then every vector f is represented as f pf i p f pf m i p f m both subspaces m m are invariant for the operator 1 k the projection p can be found as an integral of the resolvent of 1 k along the contour c which surrounds an isolated part of its spectrum p 1 2 i c 1 k i 1 d a 2 the adjoint projection p is an integral of the resolvent of the adjoint operator along the contour c which surrounds an isolated part of the spectrum of the adjoint operator p 1 2 i c 1 k i 1 d a 3 we note that if k and are selfadjoint then the following is valid 1 1 k k 1 a 4 2 the spectrum of the adjoint operator k 1 coincides with the spectrum of the operator 1 k itself therefore the contours coincide c c the adjoint eigenfunctions j

lemma 1 we derive that q 0 and q q m appendix b properties of the eigenvalue problem we give here properties of the eigenvalue problem 10 k x x x x b 1 which have distinctions for 6 i i is the identity matrix as compared with the case of i 1 first of all the eigenvalues may be both real and complex the complex eigenvalues appear in pairs n and its complex conjugate n n the index n means the sequential number of the eigenvalue n the eigenfunctions corresponding to n are denoted by n 2 the normalization factor for a real eigenvalue n nn n n b 2 is real but may be positive and negative this causes new properties of solutions we note that it is always positive if i and n 6 0 for complex eigenvalues m the self orthogonality phenomena takes place and the normalization factor is given by m m 3 the eigenfunctions of the numbers m and n satisfy the orthogonality conditions n m 0 n 6 m b 3 4 if the eigenvalue n is not degenerate we have nn 6 0 b 4 the same is true if n is twofold degenerate and the algebraic multiplicity is equal to the geometric one 5 let 1 and 2 be eigenvalues of the problem b 1 separated from the rest of the spectrum with a gap the corresponding eigenfunctions are j j 1 2 if j f 0 j 1 2 the equation k 1 1 f b 5 has an unique bounded solution 1 such that j 1 0 j 1 2 6 let n be real then d n x dx k nn x nn b 6 23 let n and j be real then n x j x sjn x k jn x b 7 where k x dk x dx k jk x j x k x k x j 1 2 k 1 2 b 8 and the conversion coefficients sjk x are defined in 16 7 let 1 and 2 be real and 1 2 then the matrix entries of k satisfy the condition k 12 k 21 0 b 9 now we proceed with a proof of the properties 1 2 3 taking the inner product of the equation b 1 for n and the eigenfunction n we derive that n is real if nn 6 0 using the fact that n k n and nn are real taking the inner product of the equation b 1 for m and the eigenfunction n we obtain n m n m 0 b 10 we used the fact that k is self adjoint and the property of the inner product n n m n n m the relation b 10 yields b 3 the property 4 follows from lemma 2 of appendix a consider a one dimensional m which is c n for any constant c the subspace m has a single basis vector n if n n 0 then n belongs to m as well we have a contradiction because it belongs to m without loss of generality n 1 and let 1 be a twofold degenerate eigenvalue there are two linear independent eigenfunctions 1 and 2 in the corresponding invariant subspace m and 2 1 0 we intend to show that n 1 6 0 we prove it by contradiction let n 1 1 1 0 then 1 belongs to m according to lemma 2 this fact contradicts the assumption that 1 m the property 5 follows from lemma 2 as well it is assumed that f is orthogonal to m then f m by lemma 2 the subspace m is an invariant subspace for the operator 1 k 1 i which is invertible the solution can be found in the form n 1 1 k 1 i 1 f where 1 k 1 i 1 is the restriction of the resolvent to m which is bounded to prove the property 6 we differentiate the eigenvalue equation 10 for the n with respect to x and scalar multiply it by n we get j x k x n x n x j x j x d n x dx d n x dx nn nk b 11 where nk is the kronecker symbol if j n we obtain b 6 if j 6 n and the eigenvalues are real we have b 7 the property 7 follows from b 7 if we take into account the fact that the conversion coefficient sjk x is bounded for any x and 1 2 appendix c perturbation method for the spectral problem we adapt here the perturbation method developed by schroedinger for problems of quantun mechanics see the history of the problem and references in 36 to deal with the operator pencils i e with eigenproblems containing on the right hand side we construct an approximate solution to the eigenvalue problem both away from the degeneracy point and in its vicinity these considerations enable us to introduce physically relevant parameters governing our results and to clarify the conditions which cause eigenvalues behavior either as shown in figs 1 a or 1 b 24 1 perturbed eigenproblem away from degeneracy point away from degeneracy point we may search for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the problem k b c 1 as a formal asymptotic series in powers of and as functions of the original variable x x 0 x 1 x x 0 x 1 x c 2 this procedure is very well studied for i and will mostly be used as the reference in the rest of the paper so we just indicate the main steps upon inserting these series into c 1 and equating terms with equal powers of we get an infinite sequence of equations k 0 0 0 c 3 k 0 1 1 b 0 c 4 k 0 2 1 b 1 2 0 c 5 we supply the expansion c 2 with condition 0 n j 0 c 6 equation c 3 is the original spectral problem 10 thus we choose the principal approximation as 0 j j 0 j j where j is the number of the corresponding solution of the eigenproblem for the sake of definiteness we choose to construct here the first mode j 1 the solution of the above system of equations differs from the standard case only in the definition of the unperturbed eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and the presence of thus in the first approximation we can write 1 1 b 21 1 2 n 2 2 1 1 c 7 1 main 1 o 3 2 main 1 1 b 11 n 1 b 21 b 12 1 2 n 1 n 2 1 b 1 1 n

spectrum if any to the first approximation of 1 orthogonal to 1 and 2 in c 7 c 8 we also introduced the following notation for the eigenfunctions normalization ni i i i 1 2 c 9 it can always be chosen constant the matrix elements for an operator a are defined as aij x i x a x j x j i 1 2 c 10 the scalar product here is that inherent from the hilbert space in which k acts 2 perturbed eigenproblem in the vicinity of the degeneracy point as is evident from c 7 c 8 the expansions are not valid whenever j j 1 2 degenerate and they do degenerate in x 0 according to our assumption 11 25 in the vicinity of a degeneracy point we describe the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in terms of a slow or stretched variable x c 11 introduced in section iv a 2 we substitute c 11 in k and b and expand them in formal series as follows k k 0 k 1 2 k 2 b b 0 b 1 2 b 2 c 12 where k n 1 n dnk dxn x 0 b n 1 n dnb dxn x 0 inserting these expansions into c 1 we obtain k 0 k 1 b 0 2 k 2 b 1 c 13 we search for solutions of this eigenproblem in the form similar to c 2 0 1 0 1 c 14 note that in distinction to the approximations n n from the previous subsection the approximations n n are now functions of not x we mark these groups of approximations with a tilde upon inserting these series into c 13 and equating terms with equal powers of we get an infinite sequence of equations k 0 0 0 0

and we introduced the subscript j 1 2 to distinguish the two modes in what follows for the eigenfunctions we have 0 j 0 j 1 1 0 0 j 2 2 0 j 1 2 c 20 where j 0 limx 0 j x j 1 2 are linear independent eigenfunctions of the original problem to make the definition unique we determine them by the limiting transition the coefficients 0 jk j k 1 2 are unknown at this step they can be found from the condition of the solvability of the equation c 16 which is the condition of orthogonality of the right hand side of c 16 with k 0 k 1 2 it gives for both j 1 and j 2 the same system 1 j n 0 1 k 1 11 b 0 11 0 j 1 k 1 12 b 0 12 0 j 2 0 k 1 21 b 0 21 0 j 1 1 j n 0 2 k 1 22 b 0 22 0 j 2 0 c 21 26 here n 0 j nj 0 j 1 2 the matrix elements with a superscript n n 0 1 are all taken at the degeneracy point x 0 k 1 jk j 0 k 1 0 k 0 b 0 jk bjk 0 j k 1 2 c 22 note that as we show in the appendix b the relation k 1 12 k 1 21 0 always holds the diagonal matrix elements k 1 jj j 1 2 are proportional to the derivatives of the unperturbed eigenvalues j x at x 0 according to b 6 j 0 k 1 jj n 0 j c 23 the condition of solvability of the system c 21 with respect to 0 j 1 0 j 2 is the nullification of the determinant it gives a quadratic equation in 1 j under an appropriate choice of the notation its solution can always be written as 1 1 2 1 av b 2 q 2 p 2 sgn n 0 1 n 0 2 c 24 the square root is assumed to be positive if it is real we do not discuss the complex case in c 24 we used the following notation half the difference of the derivatives of the unperturbed eigenvalues at x 0 is denoted as q 1 2 k 1 22 n 0 2 k 1 11 n 0 1 q 0 c 25 and the degeneracy point displacement owing to the perturbation equal for both modes reads b 1 2 q b 0 22 n 0 2 b 0 11 n 0 1 c 26 the parameter p characterizes the degree of separation of the eigenvalues for sgn n 0 1 n 0 2 sgn n 1 n 2 1 as shown in appendix b the norms of eigenfunctions j j 1 2 cannot vanish once eigenfunctions are smooth and linearly independent on the whole interval then the sign of the norm of j sgn nj is a constant even for nj nj x and so is the product sgn n 0 1 n 0 2 sgn n 1 n 2 in what follows we always use the later expression or the width of the classically forbidden zone if n 1 n 2 0 it reads p 2 b 0 12 b 0 21 n 0 1 n 0 2 b 0 12 2 n 0 1 n 0 2 c 27 finally the average of degenerating eigenvalues in the first order approximation is as follows 1 av 1 2 b 0 11 n 0 1 b 0 22 n 0 2 2 k 1 11 n 0 1 k 1 22 n 0 2 c 28 we may give now formulas for two first principal approximations of eigenvalues main j j 1 2 j main j o main j 0 1 av 1 j 1 b 2 q 2 p 2 sgn n 1 n 2 c 29 which are important for leading terms of adiabatics at this stage we are ready to deduce that for sgn n 1 n 2 1 we have the avoided crossing case see fig 1 a with two complex degeneracy points while for sgn n 1 n 2 1 we have two real ones as in fig 1 b b ip q n 1 n 2 0 b p q n 1 n 2 0 c 30 27 in both cases the degeneracy points are the simple ones in what follows we use notation re c 31 the eigenfunction approximation 0 j c 20 for j 1 2 can be easily found now by solving c 21 for 0 j j 1 2 which can be written in the notation c 25 c 26 c 28 as 0 j 1 b 0 12 n 0 1 0 j 2 1 j av q b c 32 3 matching of eigenvalues expansion away and near the degeneracy point an asymptotics of main j see c 29 as reads main j 0 1 av 1 j 1 q b i o 1 c 33 we neglect b in comparison with in the denominator of the second term the parameter see 21 is a dimensionless combination of the above mentioned physical parameters which will govern our final result the branch of is fixed in 122 the obtained asymptotics matches the asymptotics of eigenvalues away from the degeneracy point main j if 0 0 1 2 indeed rewriting j x see c 8 in terms of the parameter and inserting there 11 in the form 2 1 2 q o 2 c 34 we obtain for the first mode main 1 1 0 1 0 b 0 11 n 0 1 b 0 21 b 0 12 2 q o 1 2 c 35 taking into account the notation c 19 c 23 c 25 c 26 21 c 28 and also c 34 we obtain for 0 main 1 0 1 av q b i o 1 2 c 36 analogous considerations for the second mode yield a coincidence with c 33 formulas c 36 and c 33 show that the asymptotics of the principal terms of eigenvalues away and near the degeneracy point match for x 0 1 2 to the left of x 0 main j main j o 1 2 j 1 2 c 37 while to the right the numbering of eigenvalues j and j is inverted main 1 main 2 o 1 2 main 2 main 1 o 1 2 c 38 we use these formulas as a definition of main j j 1 2 near the degeneracy points note that for n 1 n 2 0 these functions are not defined on the interval in the opposite case n 1 n 2 0 we obtain that x b given by c 31 and main j j 1 2 are defined around such x and have there discontinuities 28 appendix d the properties of the transition matrix the general properties of the transition matrix follow from the flux conservation law 8 for two solutions j j 1 2 having 0 j as their asymptotics to the left of the degeneracy point j x 0 j o d 1 their asymptotics to its right can be derived via 116 and will be given by j x tj 1 0 1 tj 2 0 2 o d 2 where tjk j k 1 2 are the t matrix entries at the same time the relation j k const j k 1 2 d 3 must hold and the constants must be the same on both sides of the degeneracy point calculating the scalar product in d 3 for all values of the indices by using d 1 and d 2 for both sides of the degeneracy point and equating the results we obtain n 1 t 11 2 n 1 t 21 2 n 2 d 4 n 2 t 12 2 n 1 t 22 2 n 2 d 5 0 t 11 t 12 n 1 t 21 t 22 n 2 d 6 equation d 6 yields t 11 t 22 n 2 n 1 t 21 t 12 d 7 where we introduce the notation the last formula enables us to derive from d 4 and d 5 that dett 1 therefore 1 i e is a phase factor we can govern by changing lower limits of integration in adiabatic formulas and may get 1 then we deduce that for an appropriate choice of the arbitrary phase of the adiabatic mode the matrix t has the following properties dett 1 t t 11 t 12 t 12 n 1 n 2 t 11 d 8 if n 1 n 2 the matrix t is unitary t t i where i is the identity matrix appendix e estimates for approximations of inner expansion our aim here is to give a sketch of the proof of estimates a n 1 o 3 n a n 2 o 3 n e 1 for large to obtain the estimates e 1 we derive the representation a n 1 p 3 n t d 1 t q 3 n t d t p 3 n t d 1 t q 3 n t d t e 2 a n 2 m 3 n t d t n 3 n 1 t d 1 t m 3 n t d t n 3 n 1 t d

terms contain a k j j 1 2 k n 1 if n 1 formulas e 5 e 6 are exact and no terms are omitted the equations above follow from the solvability conditions for equations of each approximation of the inner expansion to solve system e 4 we express a n 1 1 from the second equation in the form of a n 1 n 0 2 b 0 21 ia n 2 b qa n 2 if n 2 q b f n 2 e 7 and substitute it into the first equation of e 4 we obtain a n 2 b 2 q 2 iq 2 a n 2 b 0 21 n 0 2 f n 1 if n 2 q b f n 2 e 8 the formulas e 2 e 3 can be proved by the method of mathematical induction by applying the following fact the operators i d d b

o 3 n 1 from property e 9 we derive that the operator on the right hand side of e 9 acting on f n 2 reduces by one the degree of the polynomial multiplied by d 1 t and increases by one the degree of the polynomial multiplied by d t because of the term f n 1 the power of polynomial multiplied by d 1 t on the right hand side of e 8 is not changed we have a natural representation a n 2 a a where a satisfies a b 2 q 2 iq 2 a p 3 n 1 d 1 t q 3 n d t e 10 and the equation for a differs from 120 by replacing t by t the factorisation d 2 d 2 b 2 q 2 iq i d d b q i d d b q and the properties of operator factors enable us to show that a solution of e 10 has the form a n 3 n 1 d 1 t m 3 n d t analogous considerations for a yield e 3 properties of e 9 and e 7 result in e 2 1 m born and v fock
