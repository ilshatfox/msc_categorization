giuria 1 10125 torino italy dated june 21 2021 the issue of irreversibility in a universe with time reversal symmetric laws is a central problem in physics in this letter we discuss for the first time how irreversibility can emerge within the recently proposed con structor theory framework here irreversibility is expressed as the requirement that a task is possible while its inverse is not in particular we demonstrate that this irreversibility is compatible with quantum theory s time reversal symmetric laws by exploiting a specific model based on the universal quantum homogeniser realised experimentally with high quality single photon qubits pacs numbers 03 67 mn 03 65 ud introduction the emerging of irreversibility from time symmetric physical laws is a central problem in contemporary physics indeed there are several approaches to irreversibility in physics statistical mechanics methods 1 3 information theoretic descriptions of logically irreversible tasks such as reset 4 6 and classical and quantum thermodynamics sec ond laws 2 7 9 in all such cases a tension arises between the laws that describe the irreversible phenomena and the time reversal symmetric laws that describe the microscopic constituents in this paper we focus on a particular type of ir reversibility which we express as the requirement that a trans formation is possible i e there is no limitation to how well it can be realised by a system operating in a cycle while its inverse is not joule s experiment 2 in classical thermody namics is an example where this irreversibility manifests it self while it is possible to heat up a volume of water by mechanical means only for instance with a stirrer it is im possible to cool it down by the same means first introduced via a thermodynamic cycle e g carnot s the idea of a cy cle performing a transformation was generalised by von neu mann to a constructor a system that can perform a given task on another system and crucially retains the ability to per form the task again therefore we call the irreversibility gen eralising that of joule s experiment constructor based irre versibility to analyse it formally we use constructor the ory a recently proposed generalisation of the quantum the ory of computation to cover general tasks 10 11 this irreversibility presents many advantages with respect to tra ditional approaches in quantum thermodynamics with re spect to the usual information theoretic description it does not suffer from the circularity between the definition of infor mation and distinguishability 11 compared with traditional statistical mechanics methods constructor based irreversibil ity does not require the existence of dynamical trajectories in the phase space difficult to define in a quantum frame work finally concerning the second law of quantum ther modynamics this irreversibility overcomes the limitations of the two point measurement scheme definition of work 12 i e the destruction of quantum coherences between system and thermal reservoir starting from the general description of constructor based irreversibility we then specialise to the case of a qubit based toy model where we demonstrate that sur prisingly this type of irreversibility is compatible with quan tum theory time reversal symmetric laws demonstrating it in an experiment exploiting high quality photonic qubits let us consider a universe made of qubits available in unbounded numbers and in any state where all unitary transformations and their transposes are allowed a task t is the specification of a physical transformation on qubits e g from a quantum state x to another one y t x y 1 whose transpose t is simply defined as t y x 2 ar x iv 2 00 9 14 64 9 v 2 qu an t ph 1 8 ju n 20 21 2 we will refer to the substrate qubit on which the task t is defined as q and to the rest of the qubits as r a constructor for the task t on the substrateq is some subsystem of the rest enabling t without undergoing any net change in its ability to do it again a task is possible if the laws of physics do not put any constraint on the accuracy to which it can be performed by a constructor it is impossible otherwise the main point of our analysis is that constructor based ir reversibility can be defined as the fact that while the task t is possible its transpose t is not the second law of thermo dynamics can also be expressed via a statement of this kind 13 this is a long standing tradition in thermodynamics ini tiated by planck 13 and continuing with axiomatic thermo dynamics 14 15 we express now the conditions for a con structor for the task t to be allowed under our unitary quan tum model a unitary transformation acting on a substrate q and the rest r will be denoted by uq r for a fixed task t on q and a positive define the set of quantum states of r that can perform t to accuracy v t r uq r x r u q r trr y 3 where y is the ball centered around t s desired out put state y y f y 1 and f tr 2 is the quantum fidelity 16 we shall denote with e t a set of n qubits prepared in a state belonging to v i e a machine capable of perform ing the task t with an error let us now introduce a measure of how much a given e t can perform t to accuracy after n repeated usages on n fresh substrate qubits q 1 qn each in the input state n x x n define for a given initial state of the rest r a recursive expression for the rest density operator after the n th usage of the machine 1 r trq 1 uq 1 r 1 x r u q 1 r 4 n r trqn uqn r n x n 1 r u qn r where uqn r uqn n uqn 1 denotes a sequence of uni tary interactions between the n th substrate qubit undergoing t and the n rest qubits emerging from the n 1 th task execution we can then define the worst case scenario steadiness of the machine e t after performing the task n times se t n inf r v t f r n r 5 most machines lose the ability to perform the task with re peated use so we expect se t n to decrease with n for a fixed a figure of merit for the resiliency of e t is the relative deterioration of e t after having been used n times defined as e t n se t n 6 there are two conditions for a constructor realising t to be allowed under a given unitary law uqn r condition i for any positive arbitrarily small the set v t of eq 3 is non empty i e the rest can perform the task t to arbitrarily high accuracy once condition ii the relative deterioration e t n of the rest r in its ability to perform the task t with error goes to zero as the error goes to zero and the number n of repeated usages goes to infinity lim 0 lim n e t n 0 7 note that the order of the limits is relevant for the correct physical interpretation for a fixed accuracy we let the num ber of usages go to infinity if these two conditions are both satisfied then a sequence of machines e t converges to a limiting machine that perfectly retains the ability to cause the transformation with asymptoti cally small error even when used n times for arbitrarily large n the limiting point of the sequence of machines e t is a constructor for the task t please note that a constructor gen eralises the notion of catalyst in resource theory 17 relaxing the requirement to stay in exactly the same state by saying that it has to stay within the same set of states for the task t to be possible in general it is not enough that a constructor exists under the given laws there should also be no limitation to how well a constructor could be approximated given the supplementary conditions to the dynamical laws e g conditions on the available initial states of the dynamics in non relativistic quantum theory however under our assumptions all the states are permitted in unlimited number a constructor being allowed implies that the corresponding task is possible results we will now provide a simple toy model where the dynamical laws are time reversal symmetric unitary quantum theory but the fact that a task t x y is possi ble does not necessarily imply the same for its transpose t demonstrating the compatibility between time reversal sym metric laws and constructor based irreversibility this model utilises the powerful scheme of quantum ho mogenisation 18 19 depicted in fig 1 and defined as fol lows consider n qubits each prepared in the state y form ing the n qubits set hn t suppose the substrate q is ini tialised with the state x and then it interacts with the qubits in hn t one at a time via the unitary transformation uq k cos i i sin qk 8 where qk is the swap gate acting on the substrate qubit q and the k th rest qubit in the homogenisation machine and i is the identity the swap is defined as the gate 12 with the property that 12 this uq k is a partial swap whose intensity is defined by the real parameter the closer is to 2 the closer this transformation is to 3 a standard swap for small values it is a way of slightly modifying the original state of q making it closer and closer to the desired output state y fig 1 qubit based homogenisation machine a substrate qubit q in green interacting with a homogenisation machine azure shaded box composed of n qubits in blue the emerald hourglasses rep resent the unitary partial swaps uq k k 1 n the state of the qubit q after interacting with hn t is q n tr 1 n 1 k n uq k x ny n k 1 u q k 9 where denotes an ordered product define now the error in performing the task on q as n 1 f q n y 10 one can show 18 19 that n tends to zero as the number of qubits n in the machine tends to infinity lim n n 0 11 in other words the machine hn t tends to be capable of performing the task t perfectly when n is large thus sat isfying condition i for a constructor this is true for any task t transforming any quantum state x into any other state y however not all quantum homogenisation machines sat isfy condition ii failing to be constructors hence not all tasks are necessarily possible specifically t need not be possible even if t is possible this is how constructor based irreversibility emerges note how this trait makes it radically different from the standard irreversibility of the homogeniser analysed in 18 19 and demonstrated by various qubit imple mentations see e g 20 for a recent one consider the special case where x and y are respectively a pure and a maximally mixed state in this case the task t goes in the direction of more mixedness while t goes in the opposite direction purifying the state for small it is possible to show two facts see supplemental material for details 1 as n increases the homogenisation machine hn t tends to be a constructor for t because the relative deteri oration after performing the task once goes to 0 lim n lim n hn t n 0 12 2 the optimal candidate to perform t hn t is not a constructor for t specifically one can show that lim n lim n hn t n 13 thus t being possible and the assumption of time reversal symmetric laws do not imply that t must also be possible this makes constructor based irreversibility compatible with time reversal symmetric laws under unitary quantum theory the experiment to provide evidence of this mechanism at work we verified experimentally that the homogenisation machine performing the task t p m being p a pure state and m a mixed one is more efficient than the machine performing the transpose task t m p even at the first task execution n 1 this represents a clear demonstration of the convergence properties men tioned above showing that even though the underlying dy namics is time reversal symmetric t may not be possi ble even if t is possible let us consider two states the pure state p 0 0 and the quasi maximally mixed state m 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 1 with 1 to take into ac count experimental imperfections in the mixture preparation we compare the performance of the machinehn t with the substrate prepared in the state p pure to mixed task t with the one of the machine hn t acting on a substrate in the state m mixed to pure task t by measuring the accuracy of each machine in performing its task i e the error this is achieved in an experiment fig 2 based on qubits realised with single photons at 1550 nm see supplemental material for a detailed description of the setup fig 3 shows the re sults obtained for a partial swap parameter 4 plots a and b report respectively the progression of tasks t and t as the substrate q interacts with the k 1 n qubits of the corresponding homogenisation ma chines in the case n 1 the reconstructed diagonal el ements 00 and 11 of the q density matrix are reported by construction in our case 01 10 0 consid ering for t the substrate in the initial state p 0 0 and the homogenisation machine qubits in the mixed state m 0 55 0 0 0 45 1 1 and viceversa for t the experimentally reconstructed values of 00 and 11 blue and red dots respectively are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions azure and yellow bars respectively throughout the whole process in both cases plot c shows the error in eq 10 indicating the discrepancy between the q density matrix and the target state one the experimen tal points in good agreement with the theoretical expectations solid lines for both tasks show how the homogenisation ma chine for t always outperforms the one for t in addition we extended our analysis to the general case n 1 to ver ify the behavior of the relative deteriorations hn t n and hn t n see eq 6 and supplemental material for de tails to this end we evaluated the machines steadiness with a recursive method considering for the j th substrate state qj j 1 n the machine initialized in a state as close as 4 fig 2 experimental setup heralded single photons at 1550 nm are produced by a low noise prototype of single photon source 32 33 the heralded photon goes to a 1 4 fiber optical switch addressing it either to the substrate path q or to one of our 3 qubit homogeni sation machine paths r 1 r 2 r 3 the heralded single photons then meet a cascade of n 3 fiber beam splitters each responsible for one of the partial swaps implemented simulating the interaction between the substrate and the homogenisation machine finally the photons are detected by free running infrared detectors whose out put is sent to a time tagging electronics together with the heralding counts possible to the one of the machine outgoing the j 1 th substrate machine interaction for each j after executing the task and tracing over the substrate qj in eq 4 the state j r includes some entanglement between the qubits of the rest although we were not able to directly measure and quantify this entanglement we could nevertheless observe the result ing correlations among the rest qubits so we reconstructed these correlations in the computational basis 0 1 and reproduced them while initializing the machine state for the j 1 th usage the results for both tasks t and t are reported in fig 4 the figure illustrates for the two experimental values corresponding to a weak interaction between substrate and homogenisation machine the behavior of the relative deterio rations hn t n and hn t n providing an evidence of their asymptotic limits reported in eqs 12 and 13 by performing numerical simulations we studied the relative deterioration behavior for a limited number n of rest qubits and n machine usages extending our analysis beyond the n 3 experimental limit for the sake of completeness we investigated both the ideal scenario with the homogeniser qubits in an entangled state for n 1 solid lines and the case of the rest qubits forming a separable state for each use of the homogenisation machine dashed lines we also showed the relative deterioration behavior dotted lines in the approximation of small swap intensity and a homogenisation machine steadiness at the n th cycle given by 1 2

the dashed curves show the predictions given by approximating the homogeniser for n 1 as an ensemble of qubits in a separable state the dotted curves show instead the approxi mation considering for

the tensor product of the reduced density operators of the rest qubits emerging from the n th task execution such approximation allows finding an analytical solution for hn t n and hn t n satisfying the conditions in eqs 12 and 13 respectively details in supplemental material our experimental results obtained evaluating the fidelities of the detected events in the computational basis are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for the entangled rest scenario fig 4 shows that for the pure to mixed task t the relative deterioration hn t n steadily decreases for increasing values of n n qualifying the homogenisation machine hn t as a proper constructor for the task t ac cording to eq 12 conversely we observe that hn t n diverges for increasing n and n in agreement with the scenario corresponding to eq 13 allowing us to state that the homogeniser hn t fails to be a constructor for t hence we can conclude that in the constructor theory framework the task t is possible while its counterpart t need not be this is what makes the process corresponding to the task t potentially irreversible conclusions in this paper we proposed a novel take on the old age problem of reconciling irreversibility with reversible unitary dynamics with a radically different approach consid ering the irreversibility based on possibility impossibility of tasks rather than on dynamical trajectories being permitted or disallowed this notion of irreversibility extends the one of classical thermodynamics to a general information theoretic scenario thus representing a significant contribution to the development of a quantum thermodynamics 7 21 24 the problem is addressed by using the conceptual framework of constructor theory where the fact that a certain task t is pos sible does not imply that the transpose task t is possible too here we have demonstrated this idea with a specific ex ample exploiting homogenisation machines also providing an experimental demonstration of this mechanism at work as shown by the results obtained in our single photon exper iment the homogenisation machine implementing the pure to mixed task t always outperforms its counterpart for the reverse task t furthermore by looking at the relative de terioration of both machines it is evident how the one for t suffers much higher degradation than the one realising t ulti mately not satisfying condition ii and thus failing to qualify as a proper constructor this gives a clear proof of the com patibility of the constructor based irreversibility with unitary quantum theory providing also a frame for the emergence of a thermodynamical irreversibility in quantum mechanics 25 30 these results have also significant application in studying quantum computational processes and their reversibility
