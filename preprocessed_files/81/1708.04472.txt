dipc org 1 http arxiv org abs 1708 04472 v 1 dr carlos garcia dipc org abstract the electronic transport properties of a point contact system formed by a single co atom adsorbed on cu 100 and contacted by a copper tip is evaluated in the presence of intra atomic coulomb interactions and spin orbit coupling the calculations are performed using equilibrium green s functions evaluated within density functional theory completed with a hubbard u term and spin orbit interaction as implemented in the gollum package we show that the contribution to the transmission between electrodes of spin flip components is negative and scaling as 2 2 where is the soc and the co atom electrode coupling hence due to this unfavorable ratio soc effects in transport in this system are small however we show that the spin flip transmission component can increase by two orders of magnitude depending on the value of the hubbard u term these effects are particularly important in the contact regime because of the prevalence of d electron transport while in the tunneling regime transport is controlled by the sp electron transmission and results are less dependent on the values of u and soc using our electronic structure and the elastic transmission calculations we discuss the effect of u and soc on the well known kondo effect of this system introduction the study of single magnetic atoms on non magnetic metals has become a reality thanks to the advent of local scanning probe microscopies 1 2 this is a priviledged situation in which precise measurements can be performed on a very controlled environment many theoretical works have been recently undertaken to quantitatively evaluate the properties revealed in these experiments 1 3 among these properties kondo physics 4 5 is currently the object of much interest 6 13 here we take one of these almost ideal systems and perform calculations to unravel the electronic structure and its effect on the electronic transport revealed by the experiments 2 the system is a single co impurity adsorbed on a cu 100 surface that is contacted by a scanning tunneling microscope stm tip 8 9 11 12 many interesting effects have been found for this system polok and co workers 14 found that electron transport qualitatively changed with the tip adatom distance when the tip was far from the substrate transport took place through the sp induced electronic structure of the adatom when the tip apex atom approached until reaching covalent bond distances the electronic transmission involved the d system more curiously the effect of the tip was a reordering of the electronic structure changing the system s properties depending on the tip surface distance unfortunately these calculations did not address the very interesting kondo physics experimentally revealed 11 12 direct calculations of the kondo physics of co on cu 100 showed that the dynamical correlation processes where basically controlled by the dz 2 orbital of co 15 17 hence the problem seemed to be greatly simplified by just considering the behavior of the dz 2 orbital as the tip surface distance changed 18 however all of these calculations where based on the results of plain density functional theory dft which are known to underestimate the magnetic properties of adsorbed impurities particularly two important ingredients present in modern calculations were missing from the above studies the intra atomic coulomb interaction as given by the hubbard u and the spin orbit coupling soc of the co atom in this work we consider the effect of both interactions in the electronic structure of co adatoms both in the tunneling regime that corresponds well to the co cu 100 ad sorbed system and to the contact regime where the tip creates a covalent bond with the co adatom becoming a point contact junction the paper contains a first section devoted to the methodology and setup of the calculations we first show the results of the electronic structure and transmission calculations for different values of the hubbard u next the paper considers the effect of soc in the co atom and its influence on the electronic trans mission we analyze the electron transmission by simplifying the problem to the d manifold of the co atom and we rationalize the effect of soc on the electron transmission in terms 3 of the strength of the soc as compared to electronic coupling the co d orbitals with the electrodes we analyze the consequences of our findings on the kondo effect and summarize the article computational methodology in this work we depart from two of the reported optimized geometries of choi et al 18 for an atomic junction formed by an adsorbed co atom on a cu 100 surface and a copper covered tip the two surfaces representing substrate and tip were modeled using a periodic slab geometry with a 3 3 surface unit cell 6 layers for the surface holding the co atom and 5 layers for the tip electrode figure 1 atomic models with the two configurations used along this work a the tunneling regime where the distance between the co atom and the tip apex is 5 05 and b the contact regime where the same distance diminishes until typical covalent bonding distances here 2 2 periodic boundary conditions have been applied along the axes perpendicular to the transport direction dft calculations have been performed within the spin polarized generalized gradient ap proximation gga pbe 19 troullier martins full relativistic pseudo potentials 20 an energy cutoff of 500 ry and a 7 7 3 k point mesh generated according to the monkhorst pack scheme have been used in the siesta code 21 a double plus polarization dzp basis set was defined to describe the co and surface atom electrons while diffuse orbitals were used to improve the surface electronic description furthermore a single plus polarization szp 4 basis was set for the copper electrodes note that we employ a dzp basis set to describe the adsorbate states in order to yield correct transmission functions 22 quantum transport computations were performed from first principles within the frame work of the landauer buttiker formalism thus the dft hamiltonian and overlap matri ces obtained with siesta 21 were analized in a post processing step with the gollum pack age 23 this code is based on equilibrium transport theory and by carefully setting electrodes branches and the central scattering region 24 the transmision coefficients can be computed without performing independent selfconsistent calculations of the density matrix this ap proach results in considerable savings of time and computational resources furthermore one of the attractive features of gollum is its functionality to compute spin transport in systems with spin orbit interactions comparison with previous calculations 18 using self consistent non equilibrium green s function calculations shows that both calculations agree within the available numerical precision results and discussion electronic structure and transport the goal of the present section is to explore the sensitivity of the electronic and transport properties of the cu co cu junction with respect to two distinct interactions the coulomb on site repulsion or hubbard u on co d orbitals and the spin orbit coupling soc we first analize the effect of the u parameter on the electronic and transport properties of the system comparing with the results of standard dft for the pbe exchange and correlation functional in the tunnel fig 2 and contact regimes fig 3 next we include spin orbit coupling and evaluate the same properties we simplify the calculations to include just the d electrons of the co atom and rationalize our findings at the end of this section 5 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 e e fermi ev 4 2 0

agreement with the results by polok et al 14 and baruselli et al 15 however the detailed electronic structure of the co adatom changes in the contact region there is a re ordering of the minority spin

electron transmis sions t with the same parameters and conventions as in fig 2 orbitals become important at the fermi level 14 18 in spite of the changes observed in the electronic structure the overall magnetic properties slightly change since the co adatom can be described as in a 3 d 8 s 1 configuration in both regimes 14 18 25 the re ordering of d levels in contact induces changes in the transport properties as was previously reported 14 18 in the tunneling region we find that transport fig 2 b basically takes place through the majority spin sp electrons of the co atom in the contact regime however the d electron contribution to the transmission at the fermi level for the minority spin highly increases and the transport is governed by the minor ity spin channel indeed the spin polarization defined as p t ef t ef t ef t ef where t ef is the transmission per spin at the fermi energy changes its sign when going from tunneling to contact as reported before 14 18 our present calculations confirms the previous picture where 7 conduction takes place through the sp electrons of the co adatom in tunneling while co d orbitals dominate the transport in the contact regime the coulomb on site repulsion on co d orbitals is an indispensable component in the above scenario since such interaction could modify the picture if the partially occupied dz 2 dxz and dyz orbitals are pulled down with respect to unoccupied orbitals when u is increased here we explore such an issue by performing lda u calculations through the simplified rotationally invariant formulation of dudarev et al 26 with an effective ueff u j that includes the effect of the fock exchange interaction j we use the implementation of the siesta code 27 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 e e fermi ev 4 2 0 2 4 6 p d o s u eff 0

regime slightly change with respect to the pdos computed at the dft level fig 2 a being the main quantitative feature related to an increase of the energy separation among d levels however when the tip is close to the surface fig 3 c besides the separation among levels the minority dz 2 is shifted to lower energies leaving the dxz and dyz as the only orbital contributions around the fermi energy the increase of the separation among levels and the decrease of the minority channel contribution at the fermi energy when including the coulomb repulsion can be clearly seen in fig 4 depicting the total co 3 d pdos for three different values of the effective ueff 8 in transport a large co sp contribution remains in the transmission at the fermi level as a result good agreement is found between ueff 0 ev and ueff 3 ev calculations as can be seen from figs 2 b and d when the tip is near the surface adatom two differences are clearly seen between ueff 3 ev fig 3 d and ueff 0 ev fig 3 b there is a shift in the energy scale related to the new energy position of the co orbitals the second difference is an increase of 4 and 15 of t ef with respect to the ueff 0 values computed for the majority and minority spin channels respectively this difference can be traced back to a change in the dz 2 orbital energy in spite of these differences the overall scenario of refs 14 18 based on the leading trans mission through the minority spin channel governed by co d orbitals remains unchanged therefore we can conclude that the coulomb on site repulsion on co d orbitals does not have a strong effect on the transport properties of the co junction electronic transport in the presence of spin orbit coupling we include spin orbit coupling soc in the dft equations following the implementations in siesta 21 and gollum 23 the pdos fig 5 a ueff 0 reveals that the effect of soc on the electronic structure of the co adatom is negligible within the accuracy of dft calculations this translates into the calculations of the electron transmission showing that the presence of soc produces no effect figure 5 b compares the transmission with and without soc both curves agree however the plotted total transmission is the sum of four terms mainly the direct non spin flip transmissions and the transmissions where the electron spin changes between electrodes in the next section we study the spin flip contributions to the transmission and their sensibility to the coulomb on site repulsion spin orbit assisted spin flip scattering the present problem consists in a single center where the soc is localized we use the electronic structure computed above with and without the inclusion of ueff to compute 9 2 1 0 1 2 e e fermi ev 4 2 0 2 4 6 p d o s 2 1 0 1 2 e e fermi ev 10 0 10 1 t a b figure 5 total a pdos projected onto co 3 d atomic orbitals and b transmission at contact with orange line and without black line taking into account spin orbit interactions and ueff 0 the transmission by just considering the transmission through the d orbitals that are the ones containing sizeable soc contributions this approximation is particularly well fitted to the contact regime in ref 18 three channels of strong d character are shown to dominate the transmission at contact while the sp channels dominate transport in the tunneling regime the transmission between electrodes for an electron injected at energy e through the d orbitals of the co atoms is t e i j k l li jg r j k r k lg a l i 1 where i j k l are indices over the spin orbitals of the d electron manifold the green s functions grj k and g a l i are the retarded and advance resolvents of the atomic hamiltonian 10 h in contact with the two electrodes expressed again in the d electron spin orbitals g r a j k i e 1 h r a 1 j 2 the identity operator 1 becomes a matrix of the dimension of the d manifold as well as the retarded advanced self energy r a the imaginary part of the self energy is actually related to of each electrode by here i is the imaginary unit i r i a 3 the total self energy is the sum of self energies due to each electrode in the spirit of the above calculations we use kohn sham orbitals and the problem becomes a one electron transport problem from this analysis we find that for e between 2 and 2 ev transport at contact is dominated by three d orbitals in good agreement with previous results ref 18 prior to switching on the soc we can identify the three spin orbitals as the minority spin degenerated dxz and dyz with some further contribution from the dz 2 orbital this is particularly true for the ueff 0 cases figures 3 a and b the minority spin peak that dominates the transmission at the fermi energy is clearly a contribution of the just mentioned orbitals however for ueff 3 ev the dz 2 orbital shifts down in energy and the transmission at the fermi energy is controlled by the minority spin degenerated dxz and dyz the comparison of figs 3 a and c show the clear reduction of the weight of dz 2 type electronic structure at the fermi energy this is concomitant with the appearance of a sharp minimum at 1 5 ev in fig 3 d our calculations using the transmission through d orbitals eq 1 show that its origin is a sizeable interference term z 2 xy due to the mixing of orbitals by the cu d band that starts at 1 8 ev the soc is included in hamiltonian h restricted to the d electron subspace this is particularly simple to do in the cartesian representation of d electrons we follow ref 28 where all matrix elements are carefully written we write the soc contribution to the 11 hamiltonian as h soc l zs z l xs x l ys y l zs z 1 2 l s l s 4 while the first term connects orbitals with the same m and spin where m is the eigenvalue of l z the second term leads to spin flips connecting spin orbitals with different spins and orbitals of m 1 if we consider the matrix elements in cartesian terms we also remark that while the matrix elements of l zs z and l xs x are purely imaginary l ys y are purely real all diagonal matrix elements are zero because in cartesian orbitals the average angular momentum is zero e e fermi ev 4 2 0 t x 1 0 5 t x 1 0 3 2 1 0 1 2 4 2 0 2 a b figure 6 spin flip component of the transmission for a ueff 0 and b ueff 3 ev in the co d manifold there is a factor of 100 difference in the transmission between a and b marked in the y axis label it is straightforward to build the new green s function by inverting the old hamiltonian with the above additional term eq 4 the value we took for was the one of co i because dft yields a 3 d 8 state for co s 1 in the contact configuration 18 using the 12 values of ref 29 we have that 455 cm 1 and 2 s 0 0284 ev 5 we retrieve our calculations using dft with soc for the transmission function fig 5 b with the message that is so small that the effect on the transmission is negligible as we will show in the next section soc effects will be noticeable as soon as the ratio 2 is not small where is the width of the d levels given by eq 3 since the spin of the electron in the electrodes is a good quantum number we can study the transmission of each spin from eq 1 we single out the spins and follow the transmission of each spin we see that the transmission is a 2 2 matrix in spin due to the combinations of entering with either up or down spins and exiting with up and down including cross terms where the spin flips due to the presence of soc at the co atom let us analyze the spin flip term t e tr l g r r g a 6 tr stands for trace over d orbitals and there are three matrix products because both s and g s are matrices on d orbitals figure 6 shows the results for the spin flip transmission t e of eq 6 this con tribution is negative leading to the decrease of electron transmission in the system and to the increase of electron backscattering despite their small value stemming from the small ness of we see fundamental differences between the two plotted cases figure 6 a is the ueff 0 case while fig 6 b is the ueff 3 ev one the difference of two orders of magnitude between the two cases comes from the different electronic structure in the ueff 0 case the three orbitals dz 2 dxz and dyz are close in energy about the fermi level these three orbitals have non zero spin orbit matrix elements connecting them because of the above spin flip rule namely the flipping of an electron leads to the change of m where 13 m is the third component of the angular momentum of the spherical harmonics entering the orbital spin flip then involves matrix elements changing m by one which is the case between the degenerated dxz and dyz with the m 0 dz 2 orbital when ueff 3 ev the dz 2 orbital moves by more than 1 5 ev away from the dxz and dyz orbitals quenching the spin flip probabilities simplified spin orbit transmission it is interesting to simplify the above treatment to enhance our insight into the spin orbit induced spin flip let us assume a single d orbital in this case the spin orbit contribution to the hamiltonian becomes 30 h soc i d d d d 7 this is obviously hermitian and the matrix element is i purely imaginary we adopt the broken symmetry description of dft then the atomic level becomes and u with u the hubbard charging energy within the wide band approximation the green s function of the orbital in contact with two electrodes is g e e i l r 2 i i e i l r 2 1 8 with obvious notations for the self energies of the level due to the left and right electrodes real parts are strictly zero in the wide band approximation for each spin replacing these quantities in eq 1 we obtain for the direct terms t e l r e i l r 2 2 e i l r 2 e i l r 2 2 2 9 14 in the limit 0 we retrieve the usual result t e l r e i l r 2 2 10 the spin flip term is proportional to 2 t e l r i 2 e i l r 2 e i l r 2 2 2 11 in the limit of large r l we see that the spin flip contribution to the transmission becomes a negative quantity quadratic on the to ratio t e 2 2 12 this sets a scale for the values of that yield sizeable spin flip terms in electron transport typically is about a few hundred mev if is in the tens of mev 3 d transition metals the spin flip terms will be negligible in transport for a single scattering center however heavy elements will produce important spin flips in point contacts kondo effect the computed electronic structure has direct bearings on the kondo effect that a co impurity displays in contact with copper electrodes 15 17 the very different electronic properties of the calculations of figs 2 a and c depending on the value of the hubbard u will change the interpretation of this kondo effect indeed for ueff 0 fig 2 a is in perfect agreement with the analyses published in refs 15 17 leading to the conclusion that the s 1 kondo effect is actually a two stage kondo where initially a s 1 2 kondo effect is produced by the dz 2 orbital charge fluctuations and the remaining magnetic moment gets screened at lower temperatures driven by the charge fluctuations of the dx 2 y 2 orbital the above picture is qualitatively the same as u increases fig 2 c although the 15 quantitative details will strongly vary this is in agreement with the discussion by baruselli et al 15 on the values of the computed kondo temperatures pointing out the many difficulties to estimate accurate values based on dft calculations at contact the picture radically changes figures 3 a and c show the half occupied dx 2 y 2 orbital leads to a s 1 2 kondo effect the dz 2 orbital is not relevant for kondo physics anymore because it becomes completely occupied the rest of the magnetic moment is screened by the charge fluctuations of a mixed valence regime driven by the degenerate dxz and dyx orbitals qualitatively the inclusion of u does not change the discussion although the final values will greatly differ the above results show that the kondo effect of co in contact with cu electrodes can be considered as a single orbital kondo effect at least for a large range of temperatures in the tunneling regime and probably for all temperatures at contact in this last case non equilibrium effects have been discussed before 18 the main effect at contact is the increased coupling to the electrodes given by the intrinsically non equilibrium effects bias induced decoherence and peak splitting are largely absent from the conductance behavior in the contact regime 18 the effect of spin orbit interactions in kondo processes has been much debated in the literature most works refer to the influence of a rashba like spin orbit interaction on the kondo spin flip processes the debate was very much calmed by the work of meir and wingreen 31 showing that due to the preservation of time reversal symmetry by the spin orbit interaction kramers degeneracy is maintained and the kondo processes are not affected recent works actually show that rashba effects can change the kondo temperature reducing it 32 33 or increasing it 34 depending on the system indeed the effect of the environment is very important js ghy and co workers 35 36 showed that soc can lead to sizeable magnetic anisotropies depending on the environment this has important consequences for local spins larger than 1 2 because it reduces the spin degeneracy and prevents kondo spin flip processes here we are considering the local soc 16 of a single impurity and not the extended rashba like interactions since the mean field spin of cobalt is close to 1 we expect to find the disruptions caused by an emerging anisotropy due to soc and the environment of the co atom however our calculation yields a very small magnetic anisotropy energy mae when a co atom is adsorbed on the cu 100 surface the mae is 2 mev dividing by the boltzmann constant yields a mae 23 k much smaller than tk 90 k the kondo temperature of co on cu 100 11 12 37 hence we do not expect any effect of the soc in the tunneling regime when the tip contacts the impurity we find that the symmetry of environment of the co atom increases further reducing mae to 0 03 mev and unaffecting the kondo physics conclusions electron transport through a co atom between an stm tip and a cu 100 substrate is shown to be largely independent of the hubbard u values used in the evaluation of the electronic structure despite the dramatic effects of the inclusion of correlation transport at the fermi energy is basically controlled by the same orbitals when the tip is far from the substrate the tunneling regime is led by cobalt s sp electronic structure at contact the d electronic structure controls all electronic transport properties surprisingly the electronic transmission with or without hubbard u for both transport regimes is qualitatively the same and to a large extent also quantitatively the inclusion of spin orbit coupling soc does not change the quantitative values of transmission we show that this is due to the small ratio where is the soc values and is the co electronic coupling to the electrodes transport with spin orbit interactions gives rise to spin flip processes at lowest order in the above ratio we find that the spin flip component of the transmission is t e 2 2 hence for co in metals this value is very small but for heavier impurities will lead to sizeable decreases of electron transmission the effect of the hubbard u in the spin orbit induced spin flip transmission is dramatic 17 this is due to the shifting of critical orbitals to be able to complete a spin flip process indeed the non zero matrix elements of the soc involve sz 1 and m 1 states where sz and m correspond to the spin and orbital angular moment when the values of ueff are ramped from zero to 3 ev the m 1 states effectively split reducing in two orders of magnitude the spin flip component of the electron transmission t the kondo effect is strongly affected by the values of the hubbard u although the qualitative picture gleaned in previous works 15 18 remains unchanged moreover we find that the co soc leads to small magnetic anisotropy energies well below the typical kondo temperatures bearing no effect on kondo processes for any of the conductance regimes analyzed here
