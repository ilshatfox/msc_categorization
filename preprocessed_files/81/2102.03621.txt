s 22 81 v 10 1 introduction pauli fierz operators are used to describe the time evolution of charged particles with spins interacting with electric potentials and the quantized electromagnetic field photons and pos sibly with a non quantized external magnetic field 3 17 8 in the markovian approximation the interaction between particles and the quantized field is usually assumed to be small and in pauli fierz hamiltonians the terms for these interactions are multiplied by a parameter g coupling constant we then suppose in the following that g is small in the pauli fierz hamiltonian considered here and denoted by h g the purpose of this work is to give an approximation of a markov type for the time evolution of observables for small g in that aim we shall omit some terms in the hamiltonian that we expect would not modify our results below the precise definition of the simplified pauli fierz hamiltonian h g is given in section 2 let htot be the hilbert space of the model assuming that the hamiltonian h g is acting in htot we recall that the evolution x t g of an observable x in htot is usually given for any time t by x t g eith g xe ith g in the system studied here we consider moving spinless charged particles together with a spin 1 2 fixed particle in the quantized electromagnetic field with an external electric potential and an external constant magnetic field the hilbert space htot is the completed tensor product of 1 http arxiv org abs 2102 03621 v 1 the three hilbert spaces hph hel and hsp respectively corresponding to the quantized elec tromagnetic field the moving charged particles and the spin fixed particle concerning the observables we assume that they act only on the moving charged particle and the spin fixed particle spaces and not on the photon space that is the observables are written as i x with i the identity in hph and x an operator in hel hsp the photon vacuum state is denoted by 0 hph in this article we are concerned with the operator denoted 0 s t g x mapping from hel hsp into itself and defined by 0 s t g xf g hel hsp i x e ith g 0 f e ith g 0 g htot for all f and g in hel hsp thus we consider time evolutions with initial states in the vacuum of photon note that in the case g 0 one has 0 s t 0 x e it hel hsp xe it hel hsp where hel and hsp respectively are the schro dinger and the free spin hamiltonian see section 2 1 that is d dt 0 s t 0 x i 0 s t 0 hel hsp x this means that for g 0 the observable evolution follows the heisenberg equation for the schro dinger and the free spin hamiltonians our goal is to prove that for g small enough 0 s t g x follows a differential equation master equation with an explicit term lindblad operator and two negligible terms the first error term is estimated with o g 3 and the second with o g 2 but the latter can be negligible for large t the simplified equation obtained when omitting these two error terms is the quantum master equation and constitutes the markovian approximation let us be more specific concerning that result we define a mapping l g see proposition 2 3 below giving for any suitable operator x in hel hsp an operator l g x also in hel hsp satisfying for all t 0 d dt 0 s t g x 0 s t g l g x r 0 t g x r t g x the mapping l g is called lindblad operator see 7 1 18 19 25 26 27 30 concerning the error terms in this approximation we prove for small g the following estimates for all positive times r 0 t g x c g 2 1 t x r t g x cg 3 ln 1 t x and if the ultraviolet cutoff vanishes at the origin r 0 t g x c g 2 1 t 2 x r t g x cg 3 x where the above norm x will be specified this result is precisely stated in theorem 2 4 below and is the main result of the paper in section 2 2 we shall see the precise hypotheses and the definition of the chosen norms in order to get the control of the error terms there exists other types of corrections of the heisenberg equation for the schro dinger operator for example the breit operator see 6 5 there are other reduced dynamics see e g 22 31 which are different to the one that we consider return to equilibrium for pauli fierz are 2 studied e g in 4 12 14 15 16 for markovian approximation and weak coupling limit approximation see 9 31 and also 1 30 and 32 33 9 10 30 31 for the control of the error let us mention that the main result theorem 2 4 is proved in view of possible applications in nmr nuclear magnetic resonance for a system of several interacting electrons together with a fixed spin 1 2 particle subject to a constant external non quantized magnetic field see 2 for the case of several fixed spins but without moving electrons and see 27 23 in the positive temperature case in section 5 we make explicit the operator l g in a particular case namely we consider the case of single electron without constant magnetic field and without the fixed spin particle we make the hypotheses that the schro dinger operator is globally elliptic in the sense of 20 in that case there exists an hilbertian basis uj of l 2 r 3 with eigenfunctions uj of the schro dinger operator hel see section 2 1 and section 5 denoting by uj the orthogonal projection on the uj we make explicit for all m and j mmj g 2 l g uj um um the form of this matrix suggests that it is the infinitesimal generator of a markov semi group one can address the question of the existence of this semi group and whether it defines a good approximation for small g of the transition probability matrix that is the probabilities for an electron initially in an excited state um without photon to be at time t in the state uj different facts make this realistic first the matrix is triangular which means that up to this approximation the probability for the electron to be at time t 0 at an energy level higher than at the initial time is zero second the diagonal elements of this matrix are related to the imaginary part of the resonances studied by bach fro hlich and sigal 3 2 statement of the results 2 1 description of the model the hilbert space of the model is the completed tensor product of the three hilbert spaces of the elements constituting the system htot hph hel hsp and the hamiltonian of the model is the sum of the hamiltonians hph hel and hsp of the three elements when they are not interacting together with the interaction hamiltonian hint photon hilbert space and hamiltonian the single photon hilbert space h 1 ph is h 1 ph f l 2 r 3 r 3 3 j 1 kjfj k 0 k r 3 the photon hilbert space hph is the symmetric fock space fs h 1 ph over the single photon hilbert space h 1 ph and we use the notations and definitions of 29 in this fock space we shall mainly use two types of unbounded operators these two unbounded operators are initially defined in the subspace hfinph of hph of elements with a finite number of components see 29 for each v in the one photon space h 1 ph we use the segal field s v which is an unbounded operator in the fock space hph see 29 for each bounded or unbounded operator t in h 1 ph 3 we use the standard operator d t in the fock space see 29 in particular if m is the multiplication in h 1 ph by k k the operator hph d m is the usual free photon energy hamiltonian electron hilbert space and hamiltonian the electron hilbert space is hel l 2 r 3 q where q is the number of electrons we assume that there is a constant external magnetic fieldbext 0 0 b where b r the corresponding vector potential is denoted by aext x bx 2 2 b x 1 2 0 letting x x 1 x q be the variable in r 3 q we set for 1 q and j 1 2 3 d j 1 i x j j d j aextj x the hamiltonian of the system of electrons is the q body schro dinger operator with constant magnetic field hel d hel hel q 1 3 j 1 j 2 v x 2 1 where v is the electric potential supposed to be a real valued function on r 3 q with polynomial growth at infinity and identified with the multiplication operator by this function this hamil tonian operator is initially defined on s r 3 q one can also omit the polynomial growth on the electric potential but replace in the following the schwartz space by the set of c functions with compact support spin hilbert space and hamiltonian the spin hilbert space of the fixed particle is hsp c 2 we denote by j the standard pauli matrices 1 j 3 in the case of a constant magnetic field 0 0 b the energy of the spin 1 2 particle corresponds to the hamiltonian hsp b 3 2 2 interaction hamiltonian the interaction between electrons and the spin fixed particle with the quantized electromagnetic field is expressed with two types of operators one type corresponds to the three components of the quantized electromagnetic vector potential and is used to define the interaction between the electron motions and the field the other type corresponding to the three components of the quantized magnetic field at the position x 0 of the spin 1 2 fixed particle is used to define the interaction between the field and the spin particle these operators are the image by the segal field s of the elements ajx and bjx of h 1 x r 3 1 j 3 that we recall here the definitions ajx k k k 1 2 e ik x ej ej k k k 2 k r 3 0 2 3 bj x k i k k 12 2 3 2 e ik x k ej k k r 3 0 2 4 4 in the above equalities e 1 e 2 e 3 stands for the canonical basis of r 3 the function is a smooth ultraviolet cutoff always supposed in the schwartz space s r note that each ajx and bjx j and x fixed maps r 3 into r 3 and satisfy the equalities k ajx k k bjx k 0 k r 3 0 this means that the aj x and bj x are elements of the single photon hilbert espaceh 1 ph according to the decreasing property of the operators corresponding to the three components of the vector potential and of the magnetic field at point x respectively are s ajx and s bjx in order to define and use for upcoming computations the operatorhint we temporarily identify htot and l 2 r 3 q hph hsp and set for all f s r 3 q hph hsp and any x r 3 q hintf x q 1 3 j 1 s aj x i j f x 3 j 1 s bj x 0 j f x the tensor product in the above equality refers to hph hsp and i denotes the identity in hsp it appears to be more convenient in the sequel to use integral expressions with creation operators a k and annihilation operators a k k r 3 as in 3 for any v h 1 ph s v 1 2 r 3 a k v k a k v k dk then for each k r 3 we define an operator e k from hel hsp now identified with l 2 r 3 q hsp and taking values in hel hsp 3 by e k f x q 1 3 j 1 aj x k j f x 3 j 1 bj x 0 k jf x 2 5 for all f s r 3 q hsp the operator e k denotes the formal adjoint of e k let us emphasize that each e k takes values in hel hsp 3 and verifies k e k 0 k r 3 therefore for each f s r 3 q hsp and for each x r 3 q the function k ex k e k f x belongs to h 1 ph hsp where h 1 ph is the single photon hilbert space thus ex tending the segal field s to the hilbert space h 1 ph hsp as in 11 we have hintf x s ex this operator is initially defined in hregtot h fin ph s r 3 q hsp this definition may be written in a somewhat formal way but useful in the following sections as hint 1 2 r 3 a k e k a k e k dk 2 6 the above tensor product corresponds to the tensor product of hph with hel hsp full hamiltonian 5 the following operators are initially defined in hregtot h 0 hph hel hsp 2 7 h g hph hel hsp ghint h 0 ghint domain and unitary group the assumption on the hamiltonian hel is hypothesis h below we use the following nota tions for any j with 1 m and j j 1 jm where the 1 q and the j 1 2 3 we set d j 1 j 1 m jm and set j m we make the following hypothesis h hypothesis h the operator hel defined in 2 1 is essentially self adjoint and we denote by hel its self adjoint extension we assume that there exists c 0 satisfying hel c 0 and we denote by w elm the domain of c hel m 2 for all integers m w elm is the set of all u l 2 r 3 q satisfying d ju l 2 r 3 q if j m with the norm u 2 w elm u 2 j m d ju 2 2 8 where is the l 2 r 3 q norm this hypothesis is fulfilled for some potentials v in particular we consider in section 5 the case of globally elliptic schro dinger operator 20 where this hypothesis is satisfied our main result could be applied with other potentials since we consider hel hsp with hsp bounded we shall still denote by w el m the spaces associated to hel hsp instead of hel in the aim to avoid additional notations such asw el sp m for example w el 0 now refers to hel hsp theorem 2 1 under hypothesis h the operator h 0 initially defined on hregtot is essentially self adjoint let c 0 be such that h 0 c 0 and let w totm be the domain of h 0 c m 2 then for g small enough the operator h g with domain w tot 2 is self adjoint and the domain of h g c m 2 is w totm theorem 2 1 is proved in section 3 by this theorem the operators eith 0 and eith g make sense for g small enough see also 21 for self adjointness of pauli fierz without the condition g small 2 2 observable time evolutions full free and reduced time evolutions of electron spin observable for every operator x in hel hsp the time full evolution of x is defined by s t g x eith g iph x e ith g for any operator a in htot we denote by 0 a the operator defined in hel hsp by 0 af g hel hsp a 0 f 0 g htot 2 9 for all f and g in hel hsp in particular we have for s t g x t 0 6 definition 2 2 we call reduced time evolution the mapping x 0 s t g x from hel hsp into hel hsp defined for every t 0 and any operator x in hel hsp by 0 s t g xf g hel hsp iph x e ith g 0 f e ith g 0 g htot for all f and g in hel hsp in rest of the paper we often omit the hilbert space as a subscript in and when it is htot hph hel or hel hsp similarly we omit the hilbert subscript in the notation i for the identity since there is no ambiguity also l h 1 h 2 denotes the set of bounded linear maps from h 1 to h 2 for any hilbert spaces h 1 and h 2 the free evolution of an operator a in htot is defined by afree t eith 0 ae ith 0 2 10 and for an operator a in hel hsp we set using the same notation since no confusion will appear afree t eit hel hsp ae it hel hsp in particular with e k the function used to give an expression of hint in 2 6 we set efree k t eit hel hsp e k e it hel hsp 2 11 and efree k t is similarly defined definition of the lindblad operator the lindblad operator is defined by the following proposition proved in section 4 let us recall that the operator e k defined in 2 5 is an operator fromhel hsp to hel hsp 3 therefore we can write e k e 1 k e 2 k e 3 k in this subsection we agree in order to avoid running indices in the sums to write e k ae k instead of j e j k aej k for any operator a in all the integrals proposition 2 3 let x be a bounded operator in hel hsp and bounded from w el 1 into itself then for every g small enough and all t 0 the following operator is well defined from w el 2 into w el 0 hel hsp l t g x i hel hsp x g 2 2 r 3 0 t e is k e k x efree k s eis k efree k s e k x dkds 2 12 moreover for small g the limit as t of l t g x exists in l w el 2 w el 0 and this limit is denoted by l g x we also have for some c 0 l t g x l g x l w el 2 w el 0 cg 2 1 t x l w el 1 w el 1 for all t 0 if the ultraviolet cutoff function in 2 3 2 4 vanishes at the origin then this inequality can be replaced by l t g x l g x l w el 2 w el 0 cg 2 1 t 2 x l w el 1 w el 1 the operator l g x l g x is called lindblad operator main result 7 theorem 2 4 let x be an operator in w el 0 hel hsp bounded in w elj for all 0 j 4 we have d dt 0 s t g x 0 s t g l g x r 0 t g x r t g x 2 13 where r 0 t g x is an operator from w el 2 into w el 0 and r t x is an operator from w el 4 into w el 0 satisfying r 0 t g x l w el 2 w el 0 c g 2 1 t x l w el 1 w el 1 r t g x l w el 4 w

r t g x l w el 4 w el 0 cg 3 sup m 4 x l w elm w elm theorem 2 4 is proved in section 4 3 sobolev spaces proof of theorem 2 1 theorem 2 1 follows from proposition 3 2 and proposition 3 6 3 1 electronic hamiltonian we are first concerned with studying the action of the operator e k defined in 2 5 in the sobolev spaces w elm spherical coordinates for k namely k 0 and s 2 the unit sphere centered at the origin are used in that purpose proposition 3 1 under hypothesis h the operator e k defined in 2 5 for fixed k r 3 maps w elm into w el m 1 3 moreover for any all m and p there is c mp 0 such that 1 2 e l w elm w elm 1 3 c mp 1 p 3 1 in particular there exists cmp satisfying e k l w elm w elm 1 3 cmp 1 k p the analogous estimates holds for e k proof we use hypothesis 2 8 noticing according to the expressions 2 3 and 2 4 for the functions ajx and bjx that the commutator j e k ikje k since the smooth ultraviolet cutoff in 2 3 2 4 is supposed to belong to s r we see that for each integer p 1 2 e l w el 1 w el 0 3 c mp 1 p the proposition follows 8 3 2 free hamiltonian we first have the following property 28 proposition 3 2 the operator h 0 defined in hregtot by 2 7 is essentially self adjoint we also denote by h 0 its self adjoint extension if c 0 satisfies h 0 c 0 then w totm stands for the domain of c h 0 m 2 for all integers m we have f 2 w tot 2 m p q m hpphh q elf 2 3 2 we then deduce the proposition below proposition 3 3 we have the two following properties i if the operator a maps w elm into w el p then i a maps w totm into w totp ii if the operator b maps w totm into w tot p then 0 b maps w el m into w el p proof let us prove the point ii we see that c hel p 0 b 0 i c hel p b therefore for each f in w elm 0 b f w elp i c hel p b 0 f b 0 f w totp k 0 f w totm k 0 h m el f f w elm for some k 0 we have used above that hph 0 0 we shall also use the fact that eith 0 is bounded from w totm into itself for all m 3 3 full hamiltonian we now study the action of the operator hint in the sobolev spaces defined in section 3 2 proposition 3 4 the operator hint is bounded from w tot m to w tot m 2 for the proof we need the following lemma which is lemma i 6 of 3 lemma 3 5 let k f k be a function on r 3 taking values in l hel hsp hel hsp 3 and satisfying k f k 0 for all k r 3 we define two operators tf and uf from w tot 1 to w tot 0 by tff r 3 a k f k

domain the domain of its self adjoint extension is w tot 2 the domain of h g m is w tot 2 m for any integer m the operator eith g is bounded in w totm uniformly in t proof by proposition 3 4 we have for g small enough h g mf h 0 mf cg f w tot 2 m since w tot 2 m is the domain of the self adjoint extension of h 0 m the proposition follows from kato rellich theorem the last point of the proposition

identities we write a b if 0 a b 0 for two given operators a and b in htot where 0 is the operator defined in 2 9 we begin this subsection with formal equalities and the norm estimates making sense

main term l t g x and its limit as t to this end we need the next proposition proposition 4 5 let x be a bounded operator in hel hsp which is also bounded from w el 1 to itself then for all t 0 the following operators are well defined from w el 2 into w el 0 s x r 3 eis k e k x efree k s dk s x r 3 e is k efree k s x e k dk moreover under the above hypotheses there exists c 0 such that s x l w

function in 2 3 2 4 is vanishing at the origin then the first inequality can be replaced by s x l w el 2 w el 0 s x l w el 2 w el 0 c 1 s 3 x l w el 1 w el 1 and similarly for the second inequality proof we use spherical coordinates for k k 0 and s 2 we have s x 3 j 1 r s 2 eis fj x gj s d d with fj 1 2 ej gj s 1 2 e free j s according to proposition 3 1 we get fj l w elp w elp 1 c 1 2 using the

w el 2 w el 1 c 1 2 we can integrate twice by parts with the variable in the expression of s x we deduce s 2 s x 3 j 1 r s 2 eis 2 fj x gj s d d 14 to prove the last points of the theorem we note that if the function vanishes at the origin then we can integrate by parts three times instead of two the proof of the proposition is completed we then deduce the next result proposition 4 6 let x be a bounded operator in hel hsp which is also bounded from w el 1 to itself then the operator l t g x defined in 2 3 is bounded uniformly in t from w el 2 to w el 0 moreover as t tends to this operator tends in l w el 2 w el 0 to a limit l g x satisfying l t g x l g x l w el 2 w el 0 cg 2 1 t x l w el 1 w el 1 and the above factor 1 1 t is improved to 1 1 t 2 if the ultraviolet cutoff vanishes at the origin propostion 2 3 is then proved 4 3 estimates on the integral rests we now need to control the norms in some spaces of the operators r 1 t g x and r 2 t g x given by 4 2 and 4 3 proposition 4

0 cmg 3 ln 1 t sup j 4 x l w el j w el j if the smooth cutoff in 2 3 and 2 4 vanishes at the origin then the factor ln 1 t can be omitted in the above inequalities the same estimates holds true for r 2 t g instead of r 1 t g proof in the definition 4 2 of r 1 t g x we use spherical coordinates for k namely k with 0 and s 2 the unit sphere centered at the origin thus we can write r 1 t g x g 3 e t t s 1 s 2 ds 1 ds 2 with t s 1 s 2 r s 2 ei t s 1 eith g i f x e is 2 h g hint i g s 1 s 2 t ei s 2 t h g d d 4 4 where f 1 2 e g s 1 s 2 t 1 2 e s 1 s 2 t 15 according to proposition 3 1 the function f takes its values in l w elj w elj 1 and we have f l w elj w elj 1 cj 1 2 under the hypothesis of theorem 2 4 we see x f l w el j w el j 1 cj 1 2 sup k j x l w el k w el k by proposition 3 3 i x f l w totj w totj 1 cj 1 2 sup k j x l w el k w el k in the same way and since eit hel hsp is uniformly bounded from w elk into itself for all k we deduce g s 1 s 2 t l w el j w el j 1 cj 1 2 where cj is idependent on t s 1 s 2 therefore by proposition 3 3 i g s 1 s 2 t l w totj w totj 1 cj 1 2 by proposition 3 4 hint is bounded from w tot j to w tot j 2 thus hint i g s 1 s 2 t l w totj w totj 3 cj 1 2 finally we know that eith g e is 2 h g and ei s 2 t h g are uniformly bounded from w totj into itself for all j we can integrate twice by parts with the variable in 4 3 in view of the above estimates we get 1 t s 1 2 t s 1 s 2 l w tot j w tot j 4 cj sup k j x l w el k w el k if the cutoff vanishes at 0 we have f 0 0 and g 0 s 1 s 2 t 0 in equality 4 3 we can integrate three times by parts and obtain 1 t s 1 3 t s 1 s 2 l w tot j w tot j 4 cj sup k j x l w el k w el k if e t is the set defined in 4 1 we see that e t ds 1 ds 2 1 t s 1 2 c ln 1 t e t ds 1 ds 2 1 t s 1 3 c the first point in the theorem is then deduced the second one follows by proposition 3 3 end of the proof of theorem 2 4 by theorem 4 1 we have 2 13 with r 0 t g x l t g x l g x r t g x r 1 t g x r 2 t g x the norm estimate of r 0 t g x comes from proposition 4 6 and the norm estimate of r 1 t g x and r 2 t g x from proposition 4 7 16 5 transition probabilities we shall make explicit in this section the matrix of the operator l g in a suitable basis and in a particular case in this section there is one spinless electron q 1 no fixed spin particle and no external magnetic field aext 0 thus htot hph hel hel l 2 r 3 therefore hel is the usual schro dinger operator hel v we make the following assumptions h 1 the potential v is a non negative real valued c function on r 3 and there exists a real m 0 and a constant c 0 for each multi index such that v x c 1 x m h 2 there exists 0 such that v x x m the following result is proved in 20 proposition 5 1 under hypotheses h 1 and h 2 the operator hel initially defined on s r 3 has a unique self adjoint extension the spectrum of hel is discrete it is the set of finite multiplicity eigenvalues j going to there exists an hilbertian basis uj of hel satisfying heluj juj each uj belongs to the intersection of the spaces w el m we have for all m 0 d hmel u h 2 m r 3 v x mu l 2 r 3 consequently hypothesis h of section 3 is satisfied if the above assumptions h 1 h 2 hold we can rearrange the eigenfunctions in such a way that the sequence j is non decreasing we next define the transition probabilities let uj be the orthogonal projection in hel on the vector space spanned by uj definition 5 2 for all unitary eigenfunctions uj and um of hel and for each t 0 the transition probability of um to uj is defined by pmj t 0 s t g uj um um hel i uj e ith g 0 um e ith g 0 um htot 0 s t g uj um hs where hs is the scalar product of two hilbert schmidt operators in hel these identities together with our main result leads us to make explicit the following matrix mmj g 2 l g uj um hs g 2 l g uj um um hel 5 1 we now omit the subscript hel in the scalar product of hel we believe that this matrix is the generator of a semi group of markov matrices which perhaps will be a good approximation of the matrix pmj t 17 theorem 5 3 the mmj defined by 5 1 satisfy mmj 3 1 k m j e k um uj 2 r 3 d k if j m mmj 0 if j m mjj k 6 j mkj mmj 0 if j m and j 6 m therefore mmj 0 if j m mmj 0 if j m and mmj 0 if j m we have for each j m mmj 0 we remark that these properties are supposed to be verified by the infinitesimal generator of a markov semi group we do not know if the matrix mmj is indeed the infinitesimal generator of a semi group neither if we get a good approximation of the pmj t if this holds true then up to this approximation the transition probability of an initial electronic state to a higher electronic energy level state is zero proof by the definition 2 3 of l g since hel uj 0 we have l g uj g 2 2 lim t r 3 0 t e is k e k uj e free k s eis k efree k s e k uj dkds we have for all integers j and m l g uj um hs tr uml g uj by the definition 2 11 we have for the traces tr e k uj e free k s um eis m j e k um uj 2 eis j jm e ishele k uje k uj and tr efree k s e k uj um e is j jm eishele k uje k uj eis j m e k um uj 2 therefore g 2 amj l g uj um hs g 2 amj jm j with amj lim t r 3 0 t cos s k j m e k um uj 2 dkds we know that for each suitable function f we have if 0 lim t r 3 0 t cos s k f k dkdt k f k d k this limit is zero if 0 we then indeed obtain the expression ofmmj form 6 j for the diag onal elementsmjj the above computations are not used but rather l g i 0 denoting by i the identity operator on hel since i is the sum of the uj it follows that j l g uj um hs 0 for each m this completes the proof of
