uzhgorod 88017 ukraine abstract the dirac equation in the external coulomb field is proved to possess the symmetry determined by the 31 operators which form the 31 dimensional algebra two different fermionic realizations of the so 1 3 algebra of the lorentz group are found two different bosonic realizations of this algebra are found as well all generators of the above mentioned algebras commute with the operator of the dirac equation in the external coulomb field and therefore determine the algebras of invariance of such dirac equation hence the spin s 1 0 bose symmetry of the dirac equation for the free spinor field proved recently in our papers is extended here for the dirac equation interacting with external coulomb field relativistic hydrogen atom is modeling here by such dirac equation we are able to prove for the relativistic hydrogen atom both the fermionic and bosonic symmetries known from our papers about the case of non interacting spinor field new symmetry operators were found on the basis of new gamma matrix representations of the clifford and so 8 algebras which were found recently in our papers hidden symmetries were found both in the canonical foldy wouthuysen and in the covariant dirac representations the symmetry operators which are simple and graceful in the foldy wouthuysen representation become non local in the dirac model pacs numbers 03 65 pm email vsimulik gmail com 1 http arxiv org abs 1906 07018 v 1 i introduction symmetry studies of the equations for the hydrogen atom originate from the non relativistic case the so 4 symmetry of the non relativistic schro dinger equation for a hydrogen atom was found by v fock 1 see also 2 relativistic hydrogen atom is modeling here by the dirac equation in the external coulomb field i 0 h x 0 h 0 p 0 m ze 2 x 1 where x m 1 3 x z 1 0 3 j 1 2 3 2 m 1 3 x x x 0 t x xj is the minkowski space time and 4 component function x belongs to rigged hilbert space s 3 4 h 3 4 s 3 4 3 note that due to a special role of the time variable x 0 t x in obvious analogy with non relativistic theory in general consideration one can use the quantum mechanical rigged hilbert space 3 here the schwartz test function space s 3 4 is dense in the schwartz generalized function space s 3 4 and h 3 4 is the quantum mechanical hilbert space of 4 component functions over r 3 m 1 3 in order to finish with notations assumptions and definitions let us note that here the system of units c 1 is chosen the metric tensor in minkowski space time m 1 3 is given by g g g g diag 1 1 1 1 x g x 4 and summation over the twice repeated indices is implied the dirac matrices are taken in the standard dirac pauli representation 0 i 0 0 i 0 0 1 2 3 5 where the pauli matrices are given by 1 0 1 1 0 2 0 i i 0 3 1 0 0 1 1 2 i 3 123 circle 6 2 below we prove the dirac equation in the external coulomb field 1 to possess the symmetry determined by the 31 operators which form the 31 dimensional algebra so 6 i 0 so 6 i 0 two different fermionic d 1 2 0 0 1 2 representations of the so 1 3 algebra of the lorentz group are found two different bosonic tensor scalar d 1 0 0 0 and vector d 1 2 1 2 representations of this algebra are found as well the corresponding generators of the above mentioned algebras commute with the operator of the dirac equation in the external coulomb field 1 and therefore determine the hidden symmetries algebras of invariance of such dirac equation at first we consider the known symmetries of the dirac equation 1 after that we present the mathematical tools which are necessary for our investigations and finally the list of different hidden symmetries of the relativistic hydrogen atom ii known symmetries of the dirac equation in external coulomb field the first four constants of motion symmetry operators which commutes with the op erator of the dirac equation for the equation 1 were found by p dirac in his paper 3 where the equation 1 has been derived and introduced they are three components of the vector j j 1 j 2 j 3 of the total angular momentum j l s l x p s 1 2 0 0 7 where l is the orbital angular momentum s is the spin 1 2 angular momentum and the found by dirac additional constant of motion k k 0 2 s l 1 k 2 j 2 1 4 8 next symmetry operator is the johnson lippman constant of motion 4 d 2 s x x 1 mze 2 k 4 h 0 m d 2 1 h 2 m 2 1 k 2 z 2 e 4 9 which commutes with the operator i 0 h of the dirac equation and anti commutes with the dirac symmetry operator k of 8 here the anti hermitian 4 0 1 2 3 instead of hermitian 5 of other authors is used note that article 4 about excellent result 9 was 3 published as a brief 1 10 of a journal page remark containing only single formula for d from 9 after that the way to so 4 symmetry of the relativistic hydrogen atom was direct this symmetry was found in 5 and 6 for the consideration in 7 see the comments of 8 thus the so 4 symmetry of the dirac equation 1 for the hydrogen atom is given by the six operators i j t r j t 10 where j is known from 7 and components of t t 1 t 2 t 3 have the form t 1 d 2 d 2 t 2 idk 2 d 2 k 2 t 3 k 2 k 2 11 in the paper 5 the object t t 1 t 2 t 3 11 was called as lentz spin 1 2 vector operator the notations used in 11 are explained in 8 and 9 above next symmetry is as follows the pauli gu rsey operators 9 and 10 s 01 i 2 2 c s 02 1 2 2 c s 12 i 2 12 where c is the operator of complex conjugation c the operator of involution in the space h 3 4 determine according to 11 the so 1 2 so 1 3 algebra of invariance of the dirac equation in the form i m e 2 x x 0 in 12 the symmetry of relativistic hydrogen atom in the form of gl 8 r algebra has been found the stationary case of the dirac equation 1 was considered and the discrete transformation were used the author of 13 considered another problem the quasi potential two particle model was presented for the description of spinless relativistic hydrogen atom the o 4 symmetry and its breaking were investigated iii briefly on the gamma matrix representations of the real clifford and so 8 algebras in our long time investigations of the mapping of the maxwell theory on the dirac theory we also studied the different exotic representations of the clifford dirac algebra which were useful in the description of the maxwell theory in the notations taking from the formalism of the dirac spinor field see e g 14 and 15 step by step we have come to the idea of 4 generalization of the clifford dirac algebra in order to describe the bosonic features of the dirac theory and fermionic features of the maxwell theory as well recently see e g 16 we put into consideration the gamma matrix representations of the clifford algebra c r 0 6 and the lie algebra so 8 which are defined over the field of real numbers comparison with well known gamma matrix representations of algebras c c 1 3 in physical literature the clifford dirac algebra and so 1 5 defined over the field of complex numbers demonstrates that new representations contain much more useful elements and perspectives for application appealing to the gamma matrix representations of the clifford algebra c r 0 6 and the lie algebra so 8 made possible see e g 17 and 18 to find the hidden symmetries of the free non interacting dirac equation the bose symmetries were found as well 19 below we use these new algebraic objects 16 for the problem of finding the hidden symmetries of the relativistic hydrogen atom the necessary part of consideration from 16 is presented below in a compact version consider the fact that seven matrices 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 5 1 3 c 6 i 1 3 c 7 i 0 13 where matrices are given in 5 and operator c is defined after the formulas 12 satisfy the anti commutation relations a b b a 2 ab a b 1 7 14 of the clifford algebra generators over the field of real numbers due to the evident fact that only six operators of 13 are linearly independent 4 i 7 1 2 3 it is the representation of the clifford algebra c r 0 6 of the dimension 26 64 the first 16 operators are given in the table 1 of 16 the next 16 are found from them with the help of the multiplication by imaginary unit i 1 last 32 are found from first 32 with the help of multiplication by operator c of complex conjugation thus if to introduce the notation stand cd stand and cd are taken from standard clifford dirac for the set of 16 matrices from the table 1 in 16 then the set of 64 elements of c r 0 6 algebra representation will be given by stand cd i stand cd c stand cd ic stand cd 15 as the consequences of the equalities 4 3 0 4 0 i known from the standard clifford dirac algebra c c 1 3 and the consequences of the anti commutation 5 relations 14 in c r 0 6 algebra for the matrices a 13 the following extended equalities are valid 7 6 a 1 a 7 a 1 a i 5 6 i operators 13 generate also the 28 matrices sa b sab 1 4 a b sa 8 s 8 a 1 2 a a b 1 8 16 which satisfy the commutation relations of the lie algebra so 8 sa b sc d a c sb d c b sd a b d sa c d a sc b 17 it is evident that here we have the algebra over the field of real numbers as well furthermore it is evident that 28 elements 16 of so 8 do not form any clifford algebra and do not form any subalgebra of the clifford algebra it is independent from the clifford algebra mathematical object note that here as in 13 for the gamma matrices the anti hermitian realization of the so 8 operators is chosen for the reasons see e g the article 20 and monographs 21 or 22 the explicit form of the 28 elements of the matrix representation of the so 8 algebra is given in the table 3 of 16 the wonderful feature of this gamma matrix representation of the algebra so 8 is as follows here i two subsets s 23 s 31 s 12 and s 45 s 64 s 56 of operators sa b from 16 determine two different sets of su 2 spin 1 2 generators ii commute between each other and iii commute with the operator of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation 23 iv new symmetries of relativistic hydrogen atom below we present both the symmetries of the foldy wouthuysen equation 23 in the external coulomd field i 0 0 e 2 x x 0 m 2 x m 1 3 s 3 4 h 3 4 s 3 4 18 and of course the symmetries of the dirac equation 1 in such external field as well the first application of the matrix representations of the algebras c r 0 6 and so 8 is the symmetry analysis the search of groups and algebras with respect to which the equation is invariant it is easy to understand that the foldy wouthuysen representation 23 is preferable for such analysis indeed in this representation one must calculate the 6 commutation relations of possible pure matrix symmetry operators from 16 only with two elements of the foldy wouthuysen equation 18 operator 0 and i after the determining of the symmetries of the foldy wouthuysen equation one can find the symmetries of the dirac equation on the basis of the inverse foldy wouthuysen transformation 23 note that after such transformation only the small part of symmetry operators will be pure matrix the main part of operators will contain the nonlocal operator m 2 and the functions of it now we can start the consideration of the new symmetries of relativistic hydrogen atom the beginning was suggested in 24 the fundamental assertions are as follows i the gamma matrix representation of the subalgebra so 6 of the algebra so 8 which is formed by the operators sa b sa b 1 4 a b a b 1 6 19 determines the algebra of invariance of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen repre sentation 0 i 0 e 2 x x 0 in 19 the six matrices a 1 2 3 4 5 6 are known from 16 ii on the basis of so 6 19 the 31 dimensional gamma matrix representation of the lie algebra so 6 i 0 so 6 i 0 is constructed which is formed by the elements from c r 0 6 and is the maximal pure matrix algebra of invariance of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation 0 i 0 e 2 x x 0 iii the dirac equation in external coulomb field 1 is invariant with respect to the 31 dimensional gamma matrix representation of the algebra s o 6 i 0 s o 6 i 0 where the representation of the algebra s o 6 is given in the form of 19 with gamma operators found from matrices 13 by the inverse foldy wouthuysen transformation 23 resulting operators are given by m p m m 4 4 m 20 5 1 3 c 6 i 1 3 c 7 i 0 0 0 m where c i 2 i 1 1 i 2 2 2 m c and m 2 these formulas give the images of gamma matrices 13 in the dirac representation after fulfilling the inverse foldy wouthuysen transformation 7 thus the s o 6 i 0 s o 6 i 0 algebra is found from so 6 i 0 so 6 i 0 on the basis of the inverse foldy wouthuysen transformation 23 for the dirac equation only the part of this algebra is pure matrix other elements contain the operator m 2 consider the symmetries of the relativistic hydrogen atom with respect to the lorentz group on the basis of c r 0 6 and so 8 we can determine two different realizations of the d 0 1 2 1 2 0 representation of the lie algebra of universal covering l sl 2 c of the proper ortochronous lorentz group l so 1 3 with respect to which the equation 0 i 0 e 2 x x 0 is invariant s i s 0 k i i 2 k 4 skmi 1 4 k m 4 0 1 2 3 k m 1 3 21 s ii s 01 ii i 2 2 c s 02 ii 1 2 2 c s 03 ii 1 2 0 s 23 ii 1 2 0 2 c s 31 ii i 2 0 2 c s 12 ii i 2 22 taking the combinations of operators 21 22 we construct the generators of bosonic representations s ts s 0 k ts s 0 k i s 0 k ii s mn ts s mn i s mn ii s v s 0 k v s 0 ki s 0 kii smnv smnts 23 where s ts and s v are the generators of the tensor scalar d 1 0 0 0 and irreducible vector d 1 2 1 2 representations of the lie algebra so 1 3 of the lorentz group l respectively with respect to which the foldy wouthuysen equation 0 i 0 e 2 x x 0 is invariant anti hermitian operators of every set 21 22 or 23 satisfy the commutation rela tions of the lie algebra so 1 3 of the lorentz group l s s g s g s g s g s 24 for the dirac equation in the space of dirac spinors i e in the pauli dirac represen tation the form of the generators of the tensor scalar d 1 0 0 0 and irreducible vector d 1 2 1 2 representations of the lie algebra so 1 3 of the lorentz group l is similar to 23 with 21 22 but the gamma operators are in this case too much complicated and are given by 20 the images of the operators 21 22 or 23 in the dirac representation satisfy the commutation relations 24 as well in 15 and 19 for the free dirac and foldy wouthuysen equations we used also the evident bosonic representation of 23 in which the casimir operators are diagonal and the 8 proof of bose properties is most convenient such evident bosonic representation of 23 can be useful here as well the corresponding transition operator is given by w 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 i 2 c 0 0 c 0 1 0 c 0 1 w 1 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 c c 0 i 2 c 0 0 0 0 1 1 25 ww 1 w 1 w i 4 and translates the smnts operators from 23 into the form s 1 1 2 0 0 ic 0 0 0 c 0 ic c 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 2 1 2 0 0 c 0 0 0 ic 0 c ic 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 3 i 0 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 26 s 2 1 1 1 i 3 0 0 0 where the bose character of the operators is evident here operator of complex conjugation c is not matrix v discussion and summary the generalization of our results on the bose symmetries of the free non interacting dirac equation see e g 15 and the references therein for the case of the presence of external coulomb field is suggested the hidden fermi and bose symmetries of the relativistic hydrogen atom are found note that physical picture of the hydrogen atom as the electron in the external coulomb field is related to the spin 1 2 fermi symmetries on the other hand the physical picture of the hydrogen atom as a compound system of proton and electron is related to the total spin 1 or zero bose symmetries the main result of this paper is putting into consideration of two different bosonic tensor scalar d 1 0 0 0 and vector d 1 2 1 2 representations of the lie algebra so 1 3 of the 9 lorentz group l with respect to which the dirac equation in the external coulomb field is invariant two fermionic symmetries of this equation given by different d 1 2 0 0 1 2 representations of the so 1 3 algebra of the lorentz group are found as well the maximal pure matrix symmetry of the foldy wouthuysen equation for hydrogen atom is found and the explicit forms of operators of corresponding symmetry of the dirac model are calculated acknowledgments the author is
