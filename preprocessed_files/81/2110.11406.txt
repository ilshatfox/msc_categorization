institute of electron physics of ukrainian national academy of sciences uzhgorod 88017 ukraine abstract the 256 dimensional representations of the clifford algebras c r 0 8 and c r 1 7 in the terms of 8 8 dirac matrices are introduced the corresponding gamma matrix representations of 45 dimensional so 10 and so 1 9 algebras which contain the standard and additional spin op erators are introduced as

the suggested representations of the so m n and clifford al gebras are investigated the role of matrix representations of such algebras in the quantum field theory is considered briefly our start from the corresponded algebras in the space of standard 4 component dirac spinors is mentioned the proposed mathematical objects allow the gener alization of our results obtained earlier for the standard

arxiv org abs 2110 11406 v 1 i introduction brief consideration of the development of our investigations 1 4 new results and our future goals are presented the 256 dimensional gamma matrix representations of the clif ford algebra and corresponding representations of so 10 and so 1 9 algebras over the field of real numbers are introduced this turned out to be possible in the space of eight component spinors i e in the corresponding rigged hilbert space and not for the ordinary four component dirac spinors note that 8 component dirac equation have its own impor tant and independent role in modern quantum field theory which enhances our interest in the corresponding representations of clifford and so m n algebras the role of proposed here mathematical objects in generalization of our results obtained earlier for the standard four component dirac equation for the equations of higher spin and especially for the equations describing the particles with spin 3 2 is considered the start of these investigations was given in the space of standard 4 component dirac spinors the gamma matrix representation of 64 dimensional clifford algebra over the field of real numbers and corresponding representation of so 8 lie algebra for 4 component spinors were introduced in 1 4 the review and final description is given in 5 the realizations c r 4 2 and c r 0 6 have been considered the role of matrix representations of such algebras in the quantum field theory was investigated in 1 5 as well the example of the standard dirac equation has been considered the mathematical foundations for our algebraic considerations were taken from 6 10 therefore in 1 5 and here below we have continued our 25 years period of study in which different useful in mathematical physics representations of the clifford dirac algebra in the space of 4 component functions see e g 11 12 were introduced our publications 1 4 are not only about representations of the clifford and so n algebras the suggested applied mathematics for the derivation of the bose not fermi symmetries solutions and conservation laws for the dirac equation with nonzero mass has been used we started in 1 from the lorentz and poincare symmetries in 2 3 we have considered different realizations of the representations of the lorentz and the poincare groups with respect to which the dirac equation m 6 0 is invariant article 4 is about relationships between the representations of the clifford and so n algebras on this basis in 13 14 we were able to find new including bose symmetries of relativistic hydrogen atom 2 i e for the dirac equation in external coulomb field it is the essence of our fermi bose dualism conception for the dirac equation 1 3 and 5 moreover the 31 dimensional lie algebra so 6 i 0 so 6 i 0 which is the maximal pure matrix algebra of invariance of the dirac equation including the interaction with coulomb field in the foldy wouthuysen representation has been found in 13 14 the corresponding symmetry of the ordinary dirac equation for the relativistic hydrogen atom has been found as well but the main part of the symmetry operators are not pure matrix note that in addition to these main results the articles 1 4 deal with the comparison of the clifford and so m n algebras gamma matrix representations we started from the study of the papers 15 16 where 16 elements of the clifford dirac algebra are linked to the 15 elements of the so 3 3 lie algebra in our papers 1 4 we were able to give the link between the gamma matrix representation of the c c 1 3 algebra and the 15 elements of the so 1 5 lie algebra on this bases in 1 4 the relationship between c r 0 6 and so 8 argebras representations has been considered here below the links between c r 0 8 so 10 and c r 1 7 so 1 9 representations are investigated the proof of the fermi bose duality of the 4 component dirac equation in the case m 0 was much easier 17 we used the ordinary 16 dimensional clifford dirac algebra the pauli gu rsey ibragimov transformations 18 20 and did not appeal to the foldy wouthuysen representation as it occurred later in general case of nonzero mass 1 4 in the space of 8 component spinors contrary to 1 4 much more wide extended rep resentations of the clifford and so n algebras can be found below the 256 dimensional representations c r 0 8 and c r 1 7 of the clifford algebra together with corresponding representations of so 10 and so 1 9 algebras are put into consideration the relation ships between such clifford and so m n algebras representations are investigated as well such new representations of these algebras over the field of real numbers will be useful for the additional investigations of the first order 8 component partial differential equations of the quantum field theory see e g 21 22 especially for the equation without redundant components for the spin 3 2 particle suggested recently in 23 24 and 5 3 ii notations assumptions and definitions one of the principal objects of the relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory is the dirac equation see e g 25 this equation describes the particle antiparticle doublet with spins s 1 2 1 2 or in other words spin 1 2 fermion antifermion doublet the presenta tion of dirac equation operatord i m as well as a list of other operators of quantum spinor field in the terms of matrices gives a possibility to use the anti commutation rela tions between the clifford algebra operators directly for finding the symmetries solutions conservation laws fulfilling the canonical quantization and calculation of the interaction pro cesses in the quantum field models the important fact is that application of the clifford algebra essentially simplifies the calculations thus for the case of free non interacting spinor field the dirac equation has the form i m x 0 1 where x m 1 3 x 0 3 j 1 2 3 2 m 1 3 x x x 0 t x xj is the minkowski space time and 4 component function x belongs to rigged hilbert space s 3 4 h 3 4 s 3 4 3 note that due to a special role of the time variable x 0 t x in obvious analogy with nonrelativistic theory in general consideration one can use the quantum mechanical rigged hilbert space 3 here the schwartz test function space s 3 4 is dense in the schwartz generalized function space s 3 4 and h 3 4 is the quantum mechanical hilbert space of 4 component functions over r 3 m 1 3 for the manifestly covariant field theory the rigged hilbert space is taken as s 4 4 h 4 4 s 4 4 starting from sec 3 and below the space of 8 component spinors we choose as the rigged hilbert space s 3 8 h 3 8 s 3 8 in order to finish with notations assumptions and definitions let us note that here the system of units c 1 is chosen the metric tensor in minkowski space time m 1 3 is given by g g g g diag 1 1 1 1 x g x 4 4 and summation over the twice repeated indices is implied the dirac matrices are taken in the standard dirac pauli representation 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 1 2 3 5 where the pauli matrices are given by 1 0 1 1 0 2 0 i i 0 3 1 0 0 1 1 2 i 3 123 circle 6 four operators 5 satisfy the anti commutation relations of the clifford algebra 2 g g 0 0 7 and realize the 16 dimensional 24 16 matrix representation of the clifford algebra c c 1 3 over the field of complex numbers indeed the rule of recalculation of the complete set of the elements of this clifford algebra representation can be found e g in 26 corresponding set is as follows 0 1 2 3 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 2 1 3 2 3 0 1 2 0 1 3 0 2 3 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 i 4 8 in appendices 1 2 the similar recalculation of the elements for the c r 0 6 and c r 0 8 representations is used for our purposes we introduce the additional matrix 4 0 1 2 3 i 0 i 2 i 2 0 i 2 1 0 0 1 9 such matrix satisfies the anti commutation relations of the clifford algebra as well 2 g 0 4 g 10 where metric tensor is given by 5 5 matrix contrary to four generators 5 of this clifford algebra the operator 4 0 1 2 3 is dependent therefore 4 does not contribute to the definition of this algebra as 16 dimensional 24 16 c c 1 3 here and in our publications see e g the articles 1 5 we use the anti hermitian 4 0 1 2 3 matrix instead of the hermitian 5 matrix of other authors 25 our 4 is equal to i 5 standard notation 5 is used in 1 5 and below for a completely different matrix 5 1 3 c we use the definition of the clifford algebra from 6 7 5 iii representations of the c r 0 6 and so 8 algebras in the space of 4 component spinors consider the set of seven matrices 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 5 1 3 c 6 i 1 3 c 7 i 0 11 where 0 are given in 5 k are the standard pauli matrices 6 imaginary unit i 1 is considered as the operator c is the operator of complex conjugation c the operator of involution in h 3 4 i e these operators are here the nontrivial orts of the algebra operators 11 satisfy the anti commutation relations a b b a 2 a b a b 1 7 12 of the clifford algebra generators over the field of real numbers due to the evident fact that only six operators from 11 are linearly independent 4 i 7 1 2 3 we deal with the representation of the clifford algebra c r 0 6 of the dimension 26 64 the first 16 operators are given in 5 and 8 the next 16 are found from them with the help of the multiplication by imaginary unit i 1 last 32 are found from first 32 with the help of multiplication by operator c of complex conjugation thus if to introduce the notation stand cd stand and cd are taken from standard clifford dirac for the set of 16 matrices 5 and 8 then the set of 64 elements of c r 0 6 algebra representation will be given by stand cd i stand cd c stand cd ic stand cd 13 another way of recalculation of 64 elements of the representation of the c r 0 6 algebra is given in appendix 1 in 4 5 we consider another 64 dimensional realization c r 4 2 as well operators 11 generate also the 28 matrices sa b sa b 1 4 a b sa 8 s 8 a 1 2 a a b 1 8 a b 1 7 14 which satisfy the commutation relations of the lie algebra so 8 sa b sc d a c sb d c b sd a b d sa c d a sc b 15 6 it is evident that here we have the algebra over the field of real numbers as well note that here as in 1 4 the anti hermitian realization of the so 10 operators is chosen for the reasons see e g 1 5 and 9 10 we appeal to the anti hermitian realizations of the generators starting from 11 12 the explicit form of the 28 elements of the matrix representation of the so 8 algebra is given in the table 1 table 1 the 28 elements of the matrix representation of the so 8 algebra 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 5 1 2 1 6 1 2 1 7 s 18 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 4 1 2 2 5 1 2 2 6 1 2 2 7 s 28 1 2 2 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 6 1 2 3 7 s 38 1 2 3 1 2 4 5 1 2 4 6 1 2 4 7 s 48 1 2 4 1 2 5 6 1 2 5 7 s 58 1 2 5 1 2 6 7 s 68 1 2 6 s 78 1 2 7 the first application of the gamma matrix representations of the algebras c r 0 6 and so 8 is the symmetry analysis the search of groups and algebras with respect to which the equation is invariant of the dirac equation with nonzero mass it is easy to understand that the foldy wouthuysen representation 27 28 is preferable for such analysis indeed in this representation one must calculate the commutation relations of possible pure matrix symmetry operators from 14 and table 1 only with the matrix part i 0 of the foldy wouthuysen equation operator 0 i 0 m 2 e 2 x x 0 after the determining of the symmetries of the foldy wouthuysen equation one can find the symmetries of the dirac equation on the basis of the inverse foldy wouthuysen transformation note that after such transformation only the small part of symmetry operators will be pure matrix the main part of operators will contain the nonlocal operator m 2 and the functions of it the 31 dimensional lie algebra so 6 i 0 so 6 i 0 has been found which is formed by the elements from c r 0 6 and is the maximal pure matrix algebra of invariance of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation see e g 1 4 and 13 14 the nonlocal image of so 6 i 0 so 6 i 0 algebra in the dirac representation is given in 13 14 furthermore in the foldy wouthuysen representation two subsets s 23 s 31 s 12 and s 56 s 64 s 45 of operators sa b from the table 1 i determine two different sets of su 2 spin 7 1 2 generators ii commute between each other and iii commute with the operator of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation on this bases in 1 4 the bose symmetries bose solutions and bose conservation laws for the dirac equation with nonzero mass 1 have been found among the bose symmetries the important lorentz and poincare algebras of invariance of the dirac equation with nonzero mass were put into consideration the transition to the space of 8 component spinors and 8 8 gamma matrices open more wide possibilities and can be used for the equations of higher spins iv representation of the c r 0 8 algebra in the space of 8 component spinors consider the set of nine 8 8 matrices j 0 0 0 j 0 0 j 0 0 j 0 0 j 0 0 0 j 1 2 3 4 i 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 5 i 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 6 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 7 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 i 2 1 0 0 1 16 8 0 0 2 c 0 0 0 0 2 c 2 c 0 0 0 0 2 c 0 0 9 0 0 i 2 c 0 0 0 0 i 2 c i 2 c 0 0 0 0 i 2 c 0 0 where 6 are the standard pauli matrices and c is the operator of complex conjugation c the operator of involution in the hilbert space h 3 2 the operators 16 satisfy the anti commutation relations a b b a 2 ab a b 1 9 17 of the clifford algebra nevertheless only eight operators from the set 16 are linearly independent and determine the set of of the generators of the corresponding clifford algebra 8 for example such linear dependence can be demonstrated in explicit form as operator products 7 i 1 2 3 4 5 6 18 together with the following relationship 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 i 8 therefore the dimen sion of this algebra is 28 256 thus we deal with representation of c r 0 8 indeed first six operators from 16 form the representation of the c c 0 6 algebra here we deal with 26 64 dimensions note that such algebra is an analogue of the ordinary 16 dimensional clifford dirac algebra c c 0 4 see e g sec 2 in the space of 8 component spinors s 3 8 h 3 8 s 3 8 therefore similarly to 1 5 we can recalculate the complete set of 256 elements of the c r 0 8 algebra representation in the form 64 c c 0 6 i 64 c c 0 6 c 64 c c 0 6 ic 64 c c 0 6 19 where c is the operator of complex conjugation in the space of 8 component spinors c the operator of involution in the hilbert space h 3 8 it is useful to present these 64 and 256 elements visually in explicit form as one can found e g in 26 for the standard representation of c c 0 4 of the clifford dirac algebra see the formula 8 here for c c 1 3 representation the corresponding formalism are given below in appendices 1 and 2 respectively v representation of the c r 1 7 algebra in the space of 8 component spinors let us mark the first difference between the consideration in four component 1 4 and eight component formalism in the space of 4 component spinors it was impossible to intro duce the representation c r 1 5 instead or together with c r 0 6 here such variant is possible and is under consideration due to the more wide properties of the algebra c r 1 7 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 j 0 0 0 j 0 0 j 0 0 j 0 0 j 0 0 0 4 i 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 9 5 i 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 6 0 0 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 i 2 0 0 0 0 i 2 0 0 20 7 0 0 2 c 0 0 0 0 2 c 2 c 0 0 0 0 2 c 0 0 8 0 0 i 2 c 0 0 0 0 i 2 c i 2 c 0 0 0 0 i 2 c 0 0 the operators 20 satisfy the anti commutation relations a b b a 2 ga b g a b 0 8 21 of the clifford algebra generators again only eight operators from the set 20 are lin early independent for example such linear dependence can be demonstrated in explicit form as operator product 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ii 8 together with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 i 8 therefore we deal with 256 dimensional representation of c r 1 7 further description of this algebra is similar to the given in sec 4 above vi gamma matrix representation of so 10 algebra operators 16 generate also the 45 matrices sa b sab 1 4 a b sa 10 s 10 a 1 2 a a b 1 10 a b 1 9 22 which satisfy the commutation relations of the generators of the lie algebra so 10 sa b sc d a c sb d c b sd a b d sa c d a sc b 23 note that here as in sec 3 the anti hermitian realization of the so 10 operators is chosen for the reasons see e g 1 5 and 9 10 the explicit form of the 45 elements of the matrix representation of the so 10 algebra is given in the table 2 10 table 2 the 45 elements of the matrix representation of the so 10 algebra 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 5 1 2 1 6 1 2 1 7 1 2 1 8 1 2 1 9 s 110 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 4 1 2 2 5 1 2 2 6 1 2 2 7 1 2 2 8 1

45 there fore here we deal with so 10 algebra representation table 2 demonstrates not only the explicit form of the generators 22 but the commu tation relations 23 as well indeed it is evident that generators with different indices commute between each other further it is evident that here we have three independent sets of su 2 generators s 1 s 23 s 2 s 31 s 3 s 12 which commute between each other they are given by the following operators from the table 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 5 6 1 2 6 4 1 2 4 5 1 2 8 9 1 2 9 7 1 2 7 8 all above mention sets of su 92 generators commute with the operator of the 8 component foldy wouthuysen equation in anti hermitian form 0 i 0 m 2 e 2 x x 0 x m 1 3 s 3 8 h 3 8 s 3 8 24 note that in 1 5 in the representation of so 8 for 4 component spinors we have only two independent su 2 sets which combinations make us possible to prove the bose symmetries of the dirac equation here similarly due to the presence of the triplet of su 2 sets the spin 3 2 lorentz and poincare symmetries for the equation suggested in 23 24 and 5 can be found of course the bose symmetries of the 8 component dirac equation can be found as well 11 vii gamma matrix representation of so 1 9 algebra the explicit form of corresponding generators follows from the set 20 the 45 gamma matrix generators of so 1 9 algebra are given by sa b sa b 1 4 a b sa 9 s 9 a 1 2 a a b 0 9 a b 0 8 25 operators 25 satisfy the commutation relations of the generators of the lie algebra so 1 9 sa b sc d ga c sb d gc b sd a gb d sa c gd a sc b 26 where the metric tensor g is already given in 21 note that here as in sec 4 for the same reasons the anti hermitian realization of the so 1 9 operators is chosen the explicit form of the 45 elements of the matrix representation of the so 1 9 algebra is given in the table 3 table 3 the 45 elements of the matrix representation of the so 1 9 algebra 1 2 0 1 1 2 0 2 1 2 0 3 1 2 0 4 1 2 0 5 1 2 0 6 1 2 0 7 1 2 0 8 s 09 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 5 1 2 1 6 1 2 1 7 1 2 1 8 s 19 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 4 1 2 2 5 1 2 2 6 1 2 2 7 1 2 2 8 s 29 1 2 2 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 6 1 2 3 7 1 2 3 8 s 39 1 2 3 1 2 4 5 1 2 4 6 1 2 4 7 1 2 4 8 s 49 1 2 4 1 2 5 6 1 2 5 7 1 2 5 8 s 59 1 2 5 1 2 6 7 1 2 6 8 s 69 1 2 6 1 2 7 8 s 79 1 2 7 s 89 1 2 8 the gamma matrices in table 3 are taken from the set 20 the dimension of the corresponding so m n algebra is given by m n m n 1 2 10 9 2 45 therefore here we deal with the representation of so 1 9 algebra table 3 demonstrates not only the explicit form of the generators 25 but the commu tation relations 26 as well indeed it is evident that generators with different indices commute between each other here again we have three independent sets of su 2 gener ators s 1 s 23 s 2 s 31 s 3 s 12 which commute between each other therefore here 12 similarly to the consideration in sec 6 the spin 3 2 lorentz and poincare symmetries for the equation suggested in 23 24 and 5 can be found viii briefly on application to symmetry analysis consider only evident result that the 21 dimensional gamma matrix representation of the subalgebra so 7 of the algebra so 10 which is formed by the operators sa b sa b 1 4 a b a b 1 7 27 determines the pure matrix algebra of invariance of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation 24 the complete set of the pure matrix symmetries of equa tion 24 is given by 21 elements of so 7 plus three su 2 operators s 1 iii 12 8 9 s 2 iii 1 2 9 7 s 3 iii 12 7 8 the corresponding symmetries of the dirac equation can be found by inverse foldy wouthuysen transformation 27 in the space of 8 component spinors see e g 5 note that in the dirac representation the main part of these operators will not be pure matrix the usefulness of the foldy wouthuysen transformation is demonstrated recently in 29 30 and in our above mentioned papers as well the 84 dimesinal set of pure matrix operators can be found by multiplication of 21 elements of so 7 by each element from the given here su 2 set however it will be the overlapping algebra note that sometimes the overlapping algebra can be useful as well we can recall the 31 dimensinal algebra c 1 3 c 1 3 where is the duality transformation the transformation of heaviside larmor rainich 31 33 in the space of field strengths of electromagnetic field such maximal first order symmetry of the maxwell equations in the terms of field strengths was found in 34 the usefulness was demonstrated e g in 35 and in many papers of other authors which unfortunately often have forgotten to refer on 34 ix brief conclusions the presented above consideration is an introduction to the proof of the fermi bose duality property of the 8 component dirac equation with nonzero mass note that in the space of 8 component spinors the conception of the fermi bose dualism of the dirac equation 13 is more rich as for standard dirac equation in 1 4 here such conception contains i the spin 1 2 properties ii the spin 1 bose properties and iii the spin 3 2 properties derivation of the fermi bose duality property of the ordinary dirac equation in 1 4 was based on the assertion that in the foldy wouthuysen representation two subsets s 23 s 31 s 12 and s 56 s 64 s 45 of operators sa b from the table 1 i determine two different sets of su 2 spin 1 2 generators ii commute between each other and iii commute with the operator of the dirac equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation 0 i 0 m 2 e 2 x x 0 indeed on this bases in 1 4 the bose spin 1 symmetries bose solutions and bose conservation laws for the dirac equation with nonzero mass 1 have been found among the bose symmetries the important lorentz and poincare algebras of invariance of the dirac equation with nonzero mass were put into consideration here see e g the table 2 for the dirac equation in the terms of 8 component spinors more exactly for this equation in the foldy wouthuysen representation 24 as for the start three such subsets of su 2 generators are found 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 5 6 1 2 6 4 1 2 4 5 1 2 8 9 1 2 9 7 1 2 7 8 on this basis we can prove not only spin 1 properties of the corresponding dirac equation but the spin 3 2 properties as well the method is known from 1 4 therefore the suggested gamma matrix represen tations of different algebras open new possibilities for the investigations of the field theory equations for the higher spins especially for the spin s 3 2 note that well defined the ory for the particles with spin s 3 2 still is under consideration 36 45 and is one of the problems of
