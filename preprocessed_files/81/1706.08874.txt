ionization of atom autoionizing states quasistationary states interacting configurations method 1 introduction we presented here next step in our last years program to apply the method of interacting configurations in the complex number representation the iccnr method to the complex atoms description the previous step was considered in 1 2 where this method on the example of beryllium atom has been demonstrated the iccnr method was suggested in papers 3 5 and successfully applied to the description of the quasista tionary states of helium formed at its electron ionization in the energy interval above the threshold of excited ion formation at the modern stage in the development of this method a principal possibility is its application to the calculation of ionization processes in more compli cated atomic structures our step by step transition from the he atom descrip tion to the complex atoms consideration has been real ized via the problem of ionization of h li ions 6 7 up to the enough complex atoms such as be mg and ca investigations the results were reported at the in ternational conferences 6 8 11 as some approbation of the method and found data the complete descrip tion of the method formalism was given in 12 see e g 13 as well in 14 the choice of the ground state wave function for such precision calculations of the qua sistationary states parameters has been considered and discussed one of the goals of these investigations is to demonstrate that the iccnr method can be useful for the complex atoms study on the level of popular r matrix approach see e g 15 the comparison with theoretical calculations in other methods has been con sidered as well thus the iccnr method is applied here to the cal culation of spectroscopic characteristics of autoionizing states ais of mg and ca atoms in the problem of the electron impact ionization of these atoms in particular the energies and the widths of the lowest 1 s 1 p 1 d and 1 f ais of mg atom and the lowest 1 p ais of ca atom are calculated few results in the photoioniza tion problem on the 1 p ais above the n 2 threshold of helium like be ion are presented as well the first three 1 p resonances above the n 2 threshold are con sidered found results are compared with 16 17 the exact quantum mechanical methods are welcome here because the experimental investigations of some atoms e g beryllium atom are complicated due to its chemical properties some known results for mg atom 18 20 are compared with our calculations in iccnr method furthermore our results found in iccnr method for ca atom are compered with experimental and theoretical investiga 1 http arxiv org abs 1706 08874 v 1 tions 21 23 note that the analysis of the loss spectrum of ejected electrons made it possible to compare indirectly the ob tained results with the results of studies of the scattering problem as one can see in the literature beryllium 16 17 19 24 44 magnesium 18 20 24 25 45 58 and calcium 21 23 59 60 atoms turns out to be the promising ob jects for researches 2 some backgrounds of the method the iccnr method is a well defined quantum mechanical method for the calculation of parameters of atomic systems this method is a development and a generalization of the known method of interacting configurations in the real number representation it has some advantages in comparison with the standard method of interacting configurations in the real num ber representation and other calculation methods for the energies and widths of quasistationary atomic states first this is a capability of finding not only the energies but also the widths of quasistationary states second there are new possibilities for the resonance identifica tion the iccnr method makes it possible on the basis of the results of calculations to estimate the con tribution of each resonance state to the cross section of the process and if the resonance approximation is appli cable to introduce a set of parameters that determine the energies and the widths of quasistationary states as well as the contours of resonance lines in the ionization cross sections in the concrete problems this approach also enables to investigate the applicability of approxi mate methods of cross section estimation and to deter mine the limits of their validity those advantages make it possible to apply successfully the iccnr method not only to scattering processes but also to much more com plicated processes such as ionization of atoms by elec trons consider the equation of the examined reaction a n 0 l 0 s 0 e k 0 a nl 1 e k 1 e k 1 where k 0 k 1 k are the momenta of the incident ejected and scattered electrons respectively then the generalized oscillator strength of the transition for the incident electron in the born approximation is given by dfnl 1 de q e q 2 ll nl 1 el n j 1 exp i q ri n 0 l 0 s 0 2 2 in this formula e k 20 k 2 is the energy loss q k 0 k is the transmitted momentum and nl 1 el ls 0 is the wave function of an atom with total momentum l and spin s 0 provided that an electron with momentum l and energy e is in the field of ion a whose electron has the quantum numbers nl 1 the function of the atomic ground state is given by n 0 l 0 s 0 note that process 1 is a much more complicated physical phenomenon in comparison with the electron scattering by an atom exact theoretical calculations of such processes constitute a problem for modern theoreti cal physics therefore the consideration of this problem for multielectron atoms in the framework of the iccnr method is an important and challenging scientific step more details of the iccnr method formalism can be found in 12 3 the results of calculations here the electron impact ionizations of the mg ca atoms in the interval of ais excitation are considered the corresponding results 1 2 for beryllium atom are discussed briefly as well furthermore some results for helium like be ion are given 3 1 energies and widths of helium like be ion below the n 3 threshold autoionizing states of be atom in articles 1 2 energies and widths of the lowest ais 1 s 1 p 1 d and 1 f of a beryllium atom has been pre sented these resonances were obtained in the iccnr approximation in the problem of the electron impact ionization of an atom the indirect comparison with results of corresponding scattering problem has been ful filled furthermore the energies of 1 p states which are located between the first and second ionization thresh olds of a beryllium atom are found and compared with the results of calculations obtained by other authors see e g 5 10 in 2 in calculations the coulomb wave functions were used as basis configurations for ev ery term up to 25 basis configurations were taken into account here we are able to add energies and the widths in the photoionization problem of the 1 p ais below the n 3 threshold of helium like be ion the first three 1 p resonances above the n 2 threshold are presented the results are compared with theoretical calculations of 16 17 table 1 comparison of the energies and the widths obtained with the use of the iccnr method for the ais below the n 3 threshold of a helium like be

ionization of mg atoms and mg ions by photons and electrons is a challenging problem this assertion is proved by both experimental and theoretical papers of many authors see e g pub lications 24 25 45 58 cited here and papers 18 20 which are considered here directly in brief publications 2 9 10 we started to study the electron impact ioniza tion of a mg atom in the ais excitation interval with the use of the iccnr method in table 2 the results of our calculations for the energies and the widths of the lowest ais 1 s 1 p 1 d and 1 f of a mg atom obtained in the electron impact ionization problem in the iccnr approximation are presented first our results are compared with similar states that are formed in the problem of electron scattering by mg ions 19 see table 2 since another prob lem has been considered in article 19 namely the scattering one such a comparison is indirect in pa per 19 the calculations were carried out in the diago nalization approximation second in the framework of the problem of the electron impact ionization of atoms the energies of 1 p states must coincide with those ob tained in the problem of photoionization of a mg atom therefore a direct comparison of our results with ex perimental ones 18 and with the results of calculations on the basis of the r matrix method 20 can be made in table 3 the energy positions and the widths calcu lated for the 1 p ais of a magnesium atom with the use of the iccnr method are directly compared with the experimental data of paper 18 and the theoretical data obtained with the help of the r matrix formalism 20 as well as with the problem of electron scattering by a mg ion 19 thus the original scientific results obtained with the help of the iccnr method 3 5 for the energies and the widths of the lowest ais 1 s 1 p 1 d and 1 f of a mg atom in the problem of electron impact ionization of this atom are presented see table 2 their novelty con sists in the application of the exact calculation method namely the method of interacting configurations and moreover the iccnr method the comparison with the calculations of corresponding energies and widths of ais carried out in the diagonalization approximation in the problem of electron scattering by mg ions table 2 is indirect a different object in a different problem but really testifies to the reliability of the results ob tained some of the results obtained here namely the energy positions of the 1 p ais of a mg atom can be di rectly compared with the experiment and the r matrix calculations see table 3 the results of calculations carried out with the use of the iccnr method are in good agreement with the corresponding calculations us ing the r matrix method 20 and experimental results 18 see table 3 3 3 electron impact ionization of a ca atom in the interval of the excitation of autoioniz ing states the application of iccnr method to calculate the lowest ais of calcium atom was started in paper 11 the energies and the widths of the lowest 1 p states were calculated the results were compared with the data obtained by other authors in table 4 besides the re sults of our calculations the experimental data 21 and the results of theoretical calculations 22 23 are shown analysis of the presented data testifies that the classi fication of ais proposed in work 22 is possible thus the results of our calculations agree well with the theo table 2 energies and widths of the lowest ais 1 s 1 p 1 d and 1 f of a mg atom obtained in the iccnr approximation in the problem of electron impact ionization of an atom in paper 19 the energies of autoionizing states were calculated in the diagonal ization approximation in the framework of the problem of electron scattering by a mg ion 1 s e ev ev e ev 19 ev 19 4 s 2 13 08 0 0987 13 06 0 1010 3
