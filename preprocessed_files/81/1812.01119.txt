ucr edu abstract certain duality of relative entropy can fail for chiral conformal net with nontrivial representations in this paper we quantify such statement by defining a quantity which measures the failure of such duality and identify this quantity with relative entropy and global index associated with multi interval subfactors for a large class of conformal nets in particular we show that the duality holds for a large class of conformal nets if and only if they are holomorphic the same argument also applies to cft in two dimensions in particular we show that the duality holds for a large class of cft in two dimensions if and only if they are modular invariant we also obtain various limiting properties of relative entropies which naturally follow from our formula supported in part by nsf grant dms 1764157 1 http arxiv org abs 1812 01119 v 2 1 introduction in the last few years there has been an enormous amount of work by physicists con cerning entanglement entropies in qft motivated by the connections with condensed matter physics black holes etc see the references in 6 for a partial list of references see 5 12 11 13 14 19 22 and 23 for a partial list of recent mathematical work this paper is motivated by a very simple fact about von neumann entropy in finite dimensional case the von neumann entropy of a pure state for a matrix algebra m and its commutant m are equal a simple exercise in linear algebra in the case of conformal net the algebra m is replaced by the algebra of observables localized on disjoint union of intervals i denoted by a i the vacuum state is a pure state hence one may expect that the von neumann entropy of vacuum state for a i and its commutant are equal but for type iii factors von neumann entropy is always infinity so this is not very interesting by the work of 1 and 14 one can define a regularized von neumann entropy cf def 2 9 for a i denoted by g i which is finite but not positive yet verifies equations similar to von neumann entropy in the finite dimensional case when the global dimension of a is one a i a i one can therefore ask if the regularized von neumann entropy for a i and a i a i is the same this is what we called a duality relation it was observed in 3 of 14 that the regularized von neumann entropy for a i and a i are different when the global dimension of a is greater than one and it is natural to conjecture that duality relation above holds if and only if the conformal net has global index equal to 1 the only currently known example that verify such a relation is the free fermion net for which we have explicit formulas for mutual information in general as in 14 one of the goals of this paper is to prove that this conjecture is true for a large class chiral cft cor 2 16 and also cft in two dimensions which are modular invariant cor 3 7 for an example it follows from cor 2 16 that such duality relation is true for conformal nets associated with any even positive unimodular lattices the number of such lattices grow very fast as their rank increase to prove such results we are led to consider a quantity called deficit which is simply the difference da i g i g i and conjecture cf 2 12 that da i is equal to another quantity d a which is defined by using the data associated with the inclusion a i a i cf 9 our key observation is th 2 13 that da i d a i remain the same for a pair of conformal nets a b with finite index recall that da i d a i for free fermion nets can be verified by explicit formulas of 14 it follows that any conformal net a that is chain related to free fermion net ar i e there exists a sequence of conformal nets b 1 bn such that b 1 a bn ar and either bi bi 1 or bi 1 bi 1 i n 1 and all inclusions are of finite index must verify our conjecture cf cor 2 14 and cor 3 6 to give the reader an idea what kind of equalities are proved in this paper let us consider a special case of cor 2 14 for a conformal net a that is chain related to free 2 fermion net ar then for i i 1 i 2 i j 1 j 2 we have s j 1 j 2 s i 1 i 2 c 6 ln s fi 1 2 ln a where s is the relative entropy is the vacuum state c is the central charge a is the global index ofa rj 1 rj 2 ri 1 ri 2 is a cross ratio and fi a j 1 j 2 a i 1 i 2 is the conditional expectation previously relations among relative entropies central charge and global index are given in asymptotic form in th 4 2 of 14 the above relation is an identity the duality condition as described above holds when the righthand side is 0 the rest of this paper is as follows in 1 after introducing relative entropy spatial derivatives index for general von neumann algebras we prove a property of relative entropy 2 4 which is motivated by our conjecture above in 2 we consider chiral conformal net we first define a quantity d which is deficit to measure the failure of duality and we prove our main theorem th 2 13 we deduce cor 2 14 cor 2 15 as consequences of th 2 13 in sections 2 4 and 2 5 we apply th 2 13 to study a number of natural problems on relative entropy in 3 we consider the two dimensional cft cases while essentially all results of 2 hold with small modifications 2 preliminaries 2 1 spatial derivatives relative entropy and index theory for general subfactors let be a normal state on a von neumann algebra m acting on a hilbert space h and be a normal faithful state on the von neumann algebra m the connes spatial derivative usually denoted by d d is a positive operator cf 3 we will use the simplified notation of 18 and write d d if is faithful we have itm it t m m m itm it t m m m where t t are modular automorphisms d 1 2 t 1 it 2 it is independent of the choice of and is called connes cocycle also if 1 2 then 1 2 by page 476 of 21 this is equivalent to 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 as bounded operators supposem acts on a hilbert space h and is a vector state given by h the relative entropy cf 5 1 of 18 in this case is s ln where is the vector state on m defined by vector and d d is connes spatial derivative when is not in the support of we set s a list of properties of relative entropies that will be used later can be found in 18 cf th 5 3 th 5 15 and cor 5 12 18 theorem 2 1 1 let m be a von neumann algebra and m 1 a von neumann sub algebra of m assume that there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation e of monto m 1 if and are states of m 1 and m respectively then s e s m 1 s e 2 let bemi an increasing net of von neumann subalgebras ofm with the property imi m then s 1 mi 2 mi converges to s 1 2 where 1 2 are two normal states on m 3 let and 1 be two normal states on a von neumann algebra m if 1 then s 1 ln 1 4 let and be two normal states on a von neumann algebra m and denote by 1 and 1 the restrictions of and to a von neumann subalgebra m 1 m respectively then s 1 1 s 5 let be a normal faithful state on m 1 m 2 denote by i the restriction of to mi i 1 2 let i be normal faithful states on mi i 1 2 then s 1 2 s 1 1 s 2 2 s 1 2 let e m n be a normal faithful conditional expectation onto a subalgebra n e 1 n is in general an operator valued weight which verifies the following equation for any pair of normal faithful weights on n and on m we have e e 1 kosaki cf 8 defined index of e denoted by inde to be e 1 1 when 1 is in the domain of e 1 we say that e has finite index when both n m are factors and e has finite index we have the cf 20 pimsner popa inequality e m m m m where inde 1 the action of the modular group e t on n m is independent of the choice of when e is the minimal conditional expectation such action is trivial on n m also the compositions of minimal conditional expectations are minimal cf 10 2 2 a result on relative entropy lemma 2 2 let a b be positive unbounded operators on a hilbert space such that a b and is a unit vector such that b c where c 0 is a constant a 4 1 let ma be the spectral measure of a associated with then 0 ln 2 dma proof by page 476 of 21 we have that 1 1 n a 1 1 n b n 0 and it follows 0 1 1 n dma 1 1 n c n 0 let n goes to infinity and by monotone convergence theorem we have 0 1 dma 1 c n 0 we note that ln 2 is bounded by a constant times 1 on 0 1 and a constant times on 1 since by assumption 0 dma 1 we have shown that 1 0 ln 2 dma 1 ln 2 dma and the proof is complete lemma 2 3 let a be a self adjoint operator on a hilbert space and be a vector in the domain of a let f t be a strong operator continuous function in a neighborhood of 0 with value in the space of bounded operators such that f 0 is identity then lim t 0 i t eita 1 f t a proof by assumption it is enough to check that lim t 0 i t eita 1 f t 1 0 we note that i t eita 1 2 1 t eit 1 2 dma 2 dma f t f 0 goes to 0 as t goes to 0 and the lemma is proved proposition 2 4 let m be a factor and a normal faithful state on m acting on the standard representation space h and the corresponding vector such that m m m m we shall use the same notation to denote the vector state on b h and its restriction to subalgebras of b h let e 1 m m 1 e 2 m m 2 be normal conditional expectation with finite index where m 1 m 2 are also factors then s e 1 s e 2 s e 1 e 1 2 and this equation can also be written as s e 1 s e 1 2 s e 1 e 1 2 5 proof ad 1 by definition we have s e 1 s e 2 lim t 0 i t e 2 it e 1 it we note that e 1 it e 1 it it d e 1 d t e 1 e 2 it e 2 it e 1 it it it follows that s e 1 s e 2 lim t 0 i t e 1 e 2 it 1 e 1 it note that e 1 e 2 e 1 e 1 2 for some 0 here the spatial derivative is determined by state on m 2 and m 2 respectively by lemma 2 2 and lemma 2 3 we have proved the first equation apply this equation with e 1 equal to identity we get s s e 2 s e 1 2 and the second equation follows it is convenient to formulate the second equation of the above prop in the fol lowing form corollary 2 5 let n 3 n 2 n 1 be factors on a hilbert space h and is a vector state on b h given by a vector h let fi ni ni 1 i 1 2 be conditional expectation with finite index assume that is cyclic and separating for n 2 then s f 2 f 1 s f 2 s f 1 proof this is just a reformulation of the second equation of prop 2 4 by noting that we can rename n 1 m 2 n 2 m n 3 m 1 f 1 inde 2 1 e 12 f 2 e 1 remark 2 6 under the conditions of the above cor s f is additive under compositions of conditional expectations just like ln inde but of course s f also depends on the state this fact plays important role in the proof of th 2 13 and th 2 20 in the following 6 2 3 chiral cft case let a be a conformal net cf 9 and 14 it is always split cf 16 let pi be the set whose elements are disjoint union of intervals if i is an interval on the circle with two end points a b ri b a is called the length of i for any i pi i denotes the restriction of toa i it follows that i 1 in is a normal state on a i since we will be concerned with relative entropy of various states we introduce some definitions to simplify notations for i i 1 i 2 in pi where ii are disjoint intervals i 1 i 2 in a state on a i is said to be related to vacuum state if we can partition i into disjoint union i j 1 j 2 jm ji pi 1 i m such that j 1 j 2 jm we shall consider conformal net whose mutual information for vacuum state are always finite definition 2 7 a conformal net a is said to have finite mutual information if s i i pi suppose a b is an inclusion of conformal nets with finite index we shall denote by ei b i a i the unique conditional expectation which preserves the vacuum state when i is an interval when i i 1 i 2 in is a disjoint union of n intervals we shall use ei to denote ei 1 ein which is the unique conditional expectation from b i to a i which preserves i 1 in lemma 2 8 1 if a has finite mutual information then s for all on a i that is related to vacuum state 2 if a b and b has finite mutual information then a also has finite mutual information 3 if a b has finite index and a has finite mutual information then a also has finite mutual information proof by 5 of th 2 1 we have s i j s i s j s i i and s i j s i s j s i i it follows that any s can be expressed as linear combination of s j for suitable intervals j i and 1 is proved 2 follows from definition and monoticity of relative entropy in th 2 1 by th 2 1 sb i sa i s ei since s ei ln indei 3 is proved it is proved on page 13 of 23 that essentially all known conformal net and probably all has finite mutual information 7 a conformal net is called rational if for some i i 1 i 2 i 1 i 2 where the a i a i has finite index which is called global index and is denoted by a two conformal nets a and b are said to be chain related if there exists a sequence of conformal nets b 1 bn such that b 1 a bn b and either bi bi 1 or bi 1 bi 1 i n 1 and all inclusions are of finite index see 4 of 14 for a large class of conformal nets that are chain related to free fermion nets for a conformal net a with central charge c and finite mutual information we define definition 2 9 the regularized von neumann entropy of vacuum state for a i i pi is defined as follows for an interval i we let g i c 6 ln ri ri is the length of interval i and g i 1 i 2 in g i 1 g in s i 1 i 2 in note that von neumann entropy for type iii factors are always infinity and regu larized von neumann entropy as defined are motivated by the results of 1 and 3 of 14 note unlike relative entropy the regularized von neumann entropy is not always non negative and not invariant under the conformal transformations on i when a 1 a i a i i pi and the vacuum state is a pure vector state we expect that the von neumann entropy of for a i i pi and a i i pi should be the same of course both are infinity but what is more interesting is to conjecture that g i g i i pi if a 1 in 3 of 14 we have shown that in general g i 6 g i if a 1 hence we expect that g i g i i pi if and only if a 1 at present the only known example which verifies a 1 and g i g i i pi is the free fermion net cf 2 of 14 for which g i i pi is known to investigate the general cases we define the following definition 2 10 we define the deficit for a i i pi to be da i ga i ga i let fi a i a i be the condition expectation of index n 1 a cf 9 when there are a pair of nets involved we shall use the notation fi a to avoid confusions definition 2 11 let i pi be a disjoint union of n intervals define d a i s fi n 1 2 ln a 8 the main conjecture of this paper is conjecture 2 12 for a rational conformal net da i d a i note that when a 1 the above conjecture implies that g i g i i pi suppose a b is an inclusion of conformal nets with finite index recall that ei b i a i is the unique conditional expectation which preserves the vacuum state when i is an interval when i i 1 i 2 in is a disjoint union of n intervals ei denotes ei 1 ein which is the unique conditional expectation from b i to a i which preserves i 1 in we will prove conj 2 12 for a large class of conformal nets the idea is the following since we have an important example of free fermion net ar for which we already know dar i d ar i and there are many conformal nets that are chain related to ar if we can show that for a pair of conformal nets a b with finite index that da i d a i db i d b i then it follows that conj 2 12 is true for conformal nets that are chain related to ar to state the theorem in more general terms we note that assuming that all the quantities involved on the left hand side are finite then da i d a i db i d b i is equivalent to s ei s ei d a i d b i then the following th does exactly this theorem 2 13 1 let a b be rational conformal nets with finite index then s ei s ei d a i d b i 2 1 also holds when b is free fermion net ar proof fix i pi which is a disjoint union of n intervals ad 1 let e indei indfi b 1 eif 1 i be 1 i be the condition expectation from a i a i set e 1 eif 1 i be 1 i let us compute s ei s fi b s ei note that is separating and cyclic for b i by prop 2 4 we have s ei s fi b s ei s e 1 9 by 4 of 8 and 10 e restricts to trace on a i a i let pa be the projection in a i a i which projects onto the closure of a i then we have e itpa e it pa t where is the state on a i given by it follows that e commutes with pa we note that when restricted to paa i pa e is given by e pa epa where epa paa i pa paa i is the unique conditional expectation and can be identified with fi a a i a i where the algebras are on pahb ha note that e pa b a 1 1 2 b 1 2 a hence ln e lne pa ln epa lne pa ln fi a note that indei a b n 2 indfi b n 1 b putting the above pieces together we have shown that s ei s fi b s ei s fi a n 1 2 ln a ln b finally by prop 2 4 we have s fi b s s fi b s f 1 i b s fi b n 1 ln b and the proof of the theorem is complete ad 2 note that in this case fi b is identity so we only need to evaluate s ei s ei note that e 1 i a i ar i kar i k 1 where k is the klein transform let us define e i kak 1 ei a a ar i since k it follows that e i kak 1 ei a kak 1 a and s ei s e i hence by 2 of prop 2 4 s ei s ei s e i s ei s e ie 1 i the rest of the proof is the same as in 1 above by th 2 13 we immediately have 10 corollary 2 14 if a is chain related to ar then conj 2 12 is true for a we also have corollary 2 15 if a is chain related to ar then da 0 if and only if a 1 proof if a 1 then da 0 by cor 2 14 now suppose that da i 1 i 2 0 by 2 of th 4 2 in 14 it follows that a 1 corollary 2 16 conj 2 12 is true for conformal nets associated with even positive definite lattices proof first we prove this for rank one lattices let au 1 a be the conformal net associated with rank one lattice with a a positive even integer denote by d 1 a dau 1 a i d au 1 a i we prove by induction on k that d 1 ka d 1 a k 1 when k 1 this is trivial assume the above equation is true for k consider the following finite index inclusions u 1 k 1 a u 1 k 1 ka u 1 ka u 1 a where u 1 k 1 a is diagonally embedded in u 1 ka u 1 a and its commutant in u 1 ka u 1 a is u 1 k 1 ka by th 2 13 and induction hypothesis we have 2 d 1 k 1 a 2 d 1 a and it follows by induction we have proved d 1 ka d 1 a k 1 now from the inclusion u 1 2 u 1 2 u 1 1 u 1 1 and th 2 13 we conclude that d 1 2 0 it follows that d 1 a 0 for all even a now assume that the corollary is proved for all rank k lattices if l is an even positive definite lattice choose a nonzero element e l and consider sublattices l 1 ze of l and l 2 of l which is orthogonal to l 1 with rank equal to k apply th 2 13 to the finite index inclusions al 1 al 2 al and induction hypothesis we have proved the corollary 11 2 4 some continuous properties let us first fix a rational conformal net a with finite mutual information by 2 of th 2 1 relative entropies are continuous from inside as an application of th 2 13 we will prove that relative entropies in th 2 13 are also continuous from outside first we have lemma 2 17 if i j i j pi then fj restrict to fi on a i and hence s fi increase with i proof this is proved in 2 of 9 for n 2 but the same argument works for any n corollary 2 18 let a b be as in th 2 13 then s ei is continuous from outside i e if in is a decreasing sequence of intervals such that in i and ei restrict to ei n then lim n s ein s ei proof this follows from th 2 13 and lemma 2 17 2 5 singular limits it is usually an interesting problem to study the limiting properties of relative entropies when intervals get close together one can find such studies in 3 and 4 of 14 in the same spirit we will consider such singular limits for related entropy s fi for a conformal net a the following theorem is a reformulation of proposition 3 25 of 14 theorem 2 19 assume that mn is an increasing sequence of factors act on a fixed hilbert space nn mn are subfactors and is a vector state associated with a vector suppose that en mn nn n 1 is a sequence of conditional expectations such that when restricting to mn en 1 en n 1 and inden is a positive real number independent of n if strong operator closure of nnn contains m 1 then lim n s en ln proof set n en it is sufficient to prove the following as in proposition 3 25 of 14 given any 0 we need to find e mn for sufficiently large n such that e 1 e 1 e e 1 n ee let e 1 m 1 be the jones projection for e 1 m 1 n 1 and v n 1 be the isometry such that v e 1 v 1 by assumptions we can find a sequence of elements en nn n 2 which converges in strong star topology to e 1 now choose xn 12 1 v e 1 env then xn 1 in strong star topology and so xn xnx n converges to 1 on the other hand by definition en x nxn v e nenv converges to v e 1 v 1 strongly hence given any 0 we can choose n sufficiently large such that if we set e x n then e mn and e 1 e 1 e e 1 n ee let i i 1 i 2 in pi and i i 1 i 2 i n let us arrange indices such that i i share end points with ii ii 1 1 i n 1 we are interested in shrinking i let us first introduce some terminology by a contraction of i along i 1 we mean keep i 1 i 1 i 2 i 12 fixed and let the length of i 1 go to 0 we will use a sequence i 1 k i 1 k i 2 k such that i 1 k is decreasing to describe such a process such a sequence is called a contraction sequence along i 1 let c 1 i i 12 i 3 in pi theorem 2 20 choosing a contracting i 1 k i 1 k i 2 k sequence along i 1 then lim k s fi s fc 1 i ln proof observe that when restricting fc 1 i to a i we get a conditional expectation simply denoted only in the proof by fk a i a c 1 i a i 1 let ek a c 1 i a i 1 a i be the conditional expectation such that ek restricts to identity on a i 3 in and on a i 12 a i 1 is the unique conditional expectation onto a i 1 i 2 note that the index of ek is notice that is cyclic and separating for a c 1 i a i 1 by cor 2 5 we have s fi s ekfk s ek s fk by 2 of th 2 1 we have limk s fk s fc 1 i to finish the proof it is sufficient to show that lim k s ek ln this follows from th 2 19 since ki 1 k i 2 k is equal to i 12 minus a point we note that we can apply th 2 20 a few times to shrink intervals i 2 i n 1 successively this way we see that lim k s fik n 1 2 ln a where one take an increasing of disjoint intervals ik each one is a disjoint union n intervals such that kik is equal to s 1 minus finitely many points this can of course be proved directly using th 2 19 now consider the case of a b with finite index 13 lemma 2 21 choosing a contracting i 1 k i 1 k i 2 k sequence along i 1 then lim k s ei 1 2 ln a ln b s ec 1 i proof for the ease of notations we set 2 i 3 in by 5 of th 2 1 s i 1 i 2 2 s i 1 i 2 s 2 s i 1 i 2 2 we note that as k goes to infinity i 1 i 2 increase to i 12 hence lim k s i 1 i 2 2 s i 12 2 hence lim k s ei lim n s ei 1 i 2 s ec 1 i the lemma now follows from th 4 4 of 14 proposition 2 22 let a b be as in th 2 13 choosing a contracting i 1 k i 1 k i 2 k sequence along i 1 then lim k s ei s ec 1 i this follows from th 2 13 th 2 20 and lemma 2 21 the above cor can be phrased as follows let ik i 1 k i 2 in pi be such that i 1 k is a decreasing sequence such that the length of i 1 k tends to 0 as n goes to infinity then lim k s eik s ei 2 in it follows that if either a or b has the property that lim k s ik s i 2 in then the other net also has this property in particular all conformal nets that are chain related to free fermion nets have this property since free fermion nets verify such property it will be interesting to see if this can be proved under more general conditions 3 cft in two dimensions for a formulation of cft in two dimensions we refer to 2 of 7 for more details a double cone c is defined to be i j where i j are intervals on the circle s 1 and we consider c to be a subset of s 1 s 1 denote by pc the set which consists of finite disjoint union of double cones we shall use c to denote the casual complement of c we will consider the case a b where a i j al i ar j both al and ar are rational and a b has finite index denote by cl cr the central charges of al and ar 14 definition 3 1 for a double cone c i j we let g c cl 6 ln ri cr 6 ln rj and g c 1 c 2 cn g c 1 g cn s c 1 c 2 cn definition 3 2 we define the deficit for b c c pc to be db c gb c gb c note that when the two dimensional net is tensor product al ar and c c 1 c 2 cn ci ii ji 1 i n we have gal ar c gal i 1 i 2 in gal j 1 j 2 jn let fc b c b c be the condition expectation of index n 1 b definition 3 3 when c is a disjoint union of n double cones define d b c s fc n 1 2 ln b the conj 2 12 for b is now conjecture 3 4 for a rational two dimensional conformal net db c d b c the proof of th 2 13 applies verbatim to the case of two dimensional conformal nets a b and we have the following theorem 3 5 1 let a b be rational two dimensional conformal nets with finite index then s ec s ec d a c d b c corollary 3 6 suppose b is chain related to al ar where both al and ar are chain related to ar then conj 3 4 is true for b we also have corollary 3 7 1 suppose b is chain related to al ar where both al and ar are chain related to ar then db 0 if and only if b 1 2 suppose that al ar b and both al and ar are chain related to ar then db 0 if and only if b is modular invariant proof the proof of 1 is the same as the proof of 1 of cor 2 15 2 follows from th 4 2 of 15 a large class of examples with b 1 can be obtained as follows take any conformal net a which is chain related to free fermion net and take the longo rehren two dimensional net which corresponds to identity modular invariant it follows by the above corollary that such net verifies db 0 15 remark 3 8 the computation of entropies in physics literature is usually done cf 2 with replica trick using path integrals and when the underlying cft can be de scribed by a lagrangian it is usually assumed that the cft is modular invariant in cases where such computations are done one finds that the deficit vanishes hence 2 of the above cor is a rigorous formulation of such intuitions finally we note that the results of sections 2 4 and 2 5 apply to two dimensional conformal nets as well with essentially the same proof references 1 h casini and m huerta a finite entanglement
