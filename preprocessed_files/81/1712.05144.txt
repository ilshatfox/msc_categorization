220030 minsk belarus known majorana fermions models are considered as promising ones for the purposes of quantum computing robust to decoherence one of the most expecting but unachieved goals is an effective control for braiding of majoranas another one is to describe z 2 topological semimetals apres spectra of which testify on eight fold degenerate chiral fermions with su 2 holonomy of wave functions whereas the last can not be reproduced within existing models quasi relativistic the ory of non abelian quantum charge transport in topological semimetals is developed for a model with a

topological semimetal graphene majorana like equation dynamic mass term braiding non abelian transport chiral anomaly i introduction topological semimetals sms are graphene like materials with

precisely chiral edge gapless 3 d ti modes have revealed a chiral anomaly of their transport properties and simultaneously signatures of zero energy majorana modes 12 berry curvature for the monolayer graphene model diverges in touching points between valence and conduction bands dirac points of the brillouin zone also called valleys 13 the existence of topological currents in graphene superlattices has been proposed in 14 in graphene signatures of majorana excitation have been experimentally observed in 15 majorana zero energy modes are new type of quasiparticles which have been theoretically predicted in high tc topological p wave superconductors majorana zero energy modes and gapped fermi arcs in angle resolved photoemission spectra arpes 16 17 18 21 and have been experimentally discovered in a ferromagnetic atomic chain one dimensional quantum wire placed on the surface of a conventional s superconductor 22 a majorana fermion is its own antiparticle 23 a dirac mass fermion can be represented as a particle formed from two majorana fermions mfs 1 2 1 i 2 2 1 i 2 2 and majorana accordingly can be considered as a particle hole pair from the dirac fermions here denotes the complex conjugation the construction of quantum devices based on dirac materials is a challenge because of the lack of understanding of deep connection of their unique electrical properties with the majorana pattern texture of dirac fermions pairs in sm and as a consequence the deficit of simulation methods let us assume that a majorana fermion can be self fissionable with subsequent self fusion provided the presence of such a mechanism of existence of the majorana particles an external electromagnetic field would separate charged majorana states in space and time resulting in charge transport such representation of majorana particle has been called a braiding representation in 24 braiding operators on a set of majoranas exist and form a unitary representation of the circular artin braid group 25 the materials with braiding majorana excitations are known to be promising materials for quantum computing by quantum tunneling 18 19 26 27 unfortunately physical grounds of the 2 d braiding are unknown in spite of the fact that braiding majorana fermions by ising spin 1 d chains have been proposed in 28 particles and holes in 2 d and 3 d dirac semimetals graphene 6 29 31 na 3 bi 32 33 cd 3 as 2 34 36 perovskite sm 4 are massless but majorana equation of motion for ultrarelativistic massless fermions is not an oscillatory one electronic address

majorana fermions can not represent a secondary quantized field one can overcome this obstacle using majorana like equations derived in 38 for quasi particle massless excitations in sm degeneration of the dirac bands is removed in the weyl sm 39 40 with the dirac point splitting into two massless weyl nodes and with gapless fermi arcs in arpes observations for taas family of such materials 41 47 hypothetically one can assume that after pairing of weyl nodes nontrivial gapless surface states from the weyl band structure are transformed into majorana surface modes inside the pairing gap as majorana and fermi arcs in arpes for a magnetic weyl semimetal in superconducting state 48 50 moreover some topological sms with without spin orbit coupling soc or when spin orbit interaction being ne glected are nodal line ring semimetals 51 53 the 1 d nodal line states which possess mirror reflection inversion coexisting with time reversal and an additional non symmorphic symmetries screw axis are symmetry protected so they are stable against perturbations including soc 52 54 57 the nodal line state enhances the surface rashba splitting 58 the 2 d drumhead like surface states inside the closed nodal ring are nested between conduction and valence bands 59 65 the flat band surface states density of which is very high are similar to those in a high temperature superconductor 66 67 a nodal line no magnetic semimetal pbtase 2 where the pb conducting orbitals the particle like 6 p pb bands around k which inevitably cross the hole like 5 d ta bands with similar energy leading to formation of the nodal rings form the topological nodal line states is a candidate to a topological superconductor with nontrivial gapless surface states 53 68 the nodal lines in pbtase 2 with strong soc are protected by a reflec tion symmetry of the space group 53 the massless chiral majorana modes in pbtase 2 are placed on a 1 d contour contrary to the majorana zero energy modes localized at 0 d points right and left hand particles always appear in pairs in virtue of the helicity conservation law and can not change their helicity as they are massless hence there must be a mechanism that allows particles to exist only at one of the touching bands therefore the graphene like materials with chiral symmetry or 3 d ti modes can be described using a mass term taking zero values at dirac points provided the chirality of the remaining single valley particle is preserved similar problem of chiral anomaly in high energy physics has been treated in the following way for single valley massless dirac fermions a similar mass term could correspond to the so called wilson mass term which vanishes at momentum k 0 and frequency 0 but the wilson mass term explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry 69 known receipt of its restoration 70 72 is to find a lattice dirac hamiltonian with a sign alternating mass term on a space like surface in such a way that the mass would be zero valued on all lattice sites rather than in the origin only the last leads to emergence of the zero energy mode a mass term eigenvalues of the mass operator entering into the equation of motion for the majorana particle should be alternating one due to positive and negative values of the mass for dirac particles and anti particles respectively therefore the use of majorana representation is the way to the chiral theory of sms in a dirac hamiltonian describing 3 d materials with band inversion 73 74 a mass term is a sign alternating one as a majorana mass term and similar to the wilson term it gains zero value in the dirac like point the band inversion is typical for 3 d tis for example for bi 2 se 3 75 where the inversion takes place in point of the brillouin zone the discovery of dirac materials with nodal line surrounding drumhead like surface states has shown that the construction of a 2 d hamiltonian by adding a sign alternating mass term is limited to the cases when the entire nodal line can be placed on a zero mass surface soc in the absence of inversion and time reversal symmetries breaks a nodal line into separate weyl nodes as it has been calculated in 49 76 79 however soc and odd parity pairing can realize mfs in the nodal topological superconductor phase 80 moreover in the stoichiometric high tc superconductor sc yba 2 cu 4 o 8 under pressure the quasiparticle mass decreases as the critical temperature tc increases 81 vortex cores in topological scs host braiding mfs 17 thus though dirac materials are emerging topological phases with emergent dirac 30 weyl 82 and majorana fermions 18 83 majorana representation should be a background for the description of their properties and charge transport this explains the fact that the first principles band structure calculations which are based on the usage of one particle quasi relativistic dirac equation demonstrate bands crossing but cannot serve as a proof of the fermi arcs as it has been mentioned in 84 there is a necessity in new theoretical approaches to design nodal line structures and topological phases linked with them 85 dichroism of s polarized arpes spectra has been observed for tis bi 2 se 3 bi 2 te 3 in 86 88 and for nbp in 47 dichroism puts forward the problem to find a hamiltonian preserving the chiral symmetry of the dirac cone bands rather than a set of dirac cone apexes the dirac points in the brillouin zone hence the search for the sm hamiltonian should be based on new approaches such as the addition of an sign alternating mass term which gets zero values on the surface of the brillouin zone rather than in distinct dirac points space of ti states is a space of even dimensionality d d 2 in which an infinite number of pairs of oppositely twisted vortices with nontrivial topological charges emerges in accord with the nielsen ninomiya no go theorem on the existence of vortex lattices in only even dimensionality of the space 89 91 the proliferation of these vortices drives the berezinskii kosterlitz thouless transition in a standard way 92 the only way to preserve the chirality of all the vortex single valley nodes simultaneously with introducing the sign alternating mass term is to use a singular divergent mass operator the massless weyl nodes in weyl sms were considered as topological defect structures vortices 93 of the type of u 1 gauge fields named as skyrmions or a su 2 o 4 gauge fields named as merons half skyrmions in 94 or o 3 non linear sigma models in 95 there is a good coincidence of experimental data with theoretical predictions on topological quantum phase transitions in 1 d xy universality class which includes different 3 realizations of vortex chain configurations in the continuum limit for free fermions 92 96 99 multiple vortices creation is observed in graphene and topological insulators in an electromagnetic field at lowering the symmetry of the structure 100 101 a resonating valence bond rvb picture 102 105 and its quantum mechanical 1 d formulation 105 model a fermi arc in arpes spectrum as a break of the double conjugated chemical bond located on the left right side of a certain lattice site with the subsequent formation of the same bond between electrons of this site and electrons of the right left site to the considered one the rvb picture has been formulated statistically in terms of skyrmions or merons 106 108 in these field theories defect staggered spin flows 109 originated from rvb breaks are cores of vortices but skyrmions do not carry an electric charge therefore to overcome the obstacle complex constructions with additional quasiparticles holons have been developed 110 to describe the high tc conductivity moreover the coupling of massless fermions to gauge fields in the o 4 su 2 non linear sigma models is confining assuming violation of su 2 to u 1 as a deconfinement one gets the so called triple quantum electrodynamics qed 3 model 111 112 to make a deconfined state stable the number of matter fields should be large enough 113 the zero energy majorana bound state mbs is associated with the non abelian excitation the vortex leads to the mbs for example in a superconductor px ipy 114 117 thus to describe nodal line weyl semimetals a new theory is required which would predict a phenomenon similar to deconfinement and would be characterized by a sufficiently large number n of gauge fields another difficulty is that the fermi arcs are not closed because of that the fermi pockets are not formed from the luttinger theorem it follows that the area of the fermi surface is the same as that of free fermions i e it is determined by the total density of electrons in the unit cell 118 violation of the luttinger theorem in landau fermi liquid theory leads to a non conservation of the total electric charge therefore if the fermi pockets are not formed then the violation of the luttinger theorem becomes unavoidable obstacle in utilizing dirac particle physics 119 120 to describe strongly correlated systems the majorana representation allows any fermionic system either fermion number conserving or not to be treated on equal footing 121 123 the nodal lines restore the fermi pockets and surround drumhead like states 56 77 the last gives hope for the construction of a field theory of dirac materials provided one understood the origin and mechanisms of the decay of these lines complex magnetic dynamics is developed in double perovskite compounds ba 2 ymoo 6 ba 2 meoso 6 me li na despite of perfect cancelation of spin and angular momentum contributions at cubic symmetry 124 128 this testifies that soc can effectively augment the hubbard correlations effects in mott hubbard physics 129 130 so quantum statistics of many body systems with a particle hole symmetry should be a non abelian one the absence of which is the main obstacle in investigation of majorana like states in the paper we develop a quantum non abelian statistical approach to pseudo majorana fermionic systems with calculus of quasi relativistic currents and analyze emergent majorana like features of quantum charge transport in the dirac materials we demonstrate that natural background to describe all types of dirac materials is in accounting of relativistic exchange interactions which destroy pseudo antiferromagnetic order in the majorana basis in section 2 we construct a transformation which produces one to one map of quasiparticle states hole particle with the negative positive energy in one of two trigonal sublattices to states particle hole of the positive negative energy in other trigonal sublattice of the hexagonal lattice utilizing this transformation we find the equations of motion for a pseudo real braiding majorana quasiparticle electrically charged exciton on a 2 d hexagonal lattice in section 3 we develop a relativistic theory of the secondary quantized field with a number of flavors n 3 on a hexagonal lattice within the quasi relativistic dirac hartree fock self consistent field approximation 131 141 in the section we also demonstrate that the relativistic exchange leads to dynamically gapped fermi arcs in topological semimetals we use the k p perturbation theory and maximally localized wannier functions which provide accurate characterization of points of interest in the brillouin zone bz in terms of a relatively small number of parameters with the first principles accuracy and linear scaling computational costs opposite to known non relativistic k p approaches 64 142 148 we propose a quasi relativistic chiral band structure theory calculating majorana bands in section 3 we neglect the majorana dynamical mass however the presence of heavy and light carriers is considered as a mass correction to complex conductivity in section 4 in section 5 splitting zero conductance peaks longitudinal magnetoresistance minimal direct current dc conductivity negative differential conductivity appearance of majorana resonance and anti resonance pairs in frequency dependence of dielectric permeability and other phenomena of majorana braiding in charge transport in topological sms are

following way ij ab ba include bilinear on combinations of wave functions so that 4 d phase enter into iii 1 iii 2 in the form k exp 0 k k exp k iii 3 therefore an effective number n of flavors in our gauge field theory is equal to 3 a model of the dirac material with two or three flavors as a model with two or three dimer electron configurations is represented schematically in fig 1 a b electrons of the first model in fig 1 a are paired pz electrons among pz electrons of the second model in fig 1 b there exist two unpaired electrons the first model with pz electrons has been proposed in 149 for graphite part of electrons in the second model are unpaired ones and respectively dimers are formed as in the anderson rvb picture the weak exchange for the second model leads to a gapless band structure as it has been demonstrated in 150 151 and respectively to metallicity the strong quantum exchange for the first model leads to the appearance of the gap which has been experimentally observed for graphene bilayers 152 in the model n 2 the valley currents are absent due to the fact that all pz electrons are pared contrary to this valley currents exist for n 3 153 in contrast to the rvb picture the stochastic staggered spin flows or identical to them d density wave states 154 are absent for our model their place as we show further is occupied by the quantum staggered valley currents of the electric charge carriers with a precessing spin similar to a spin vortex the spin precession is due to soc coupling experimentally such a staggered orbital order a staggered quadruple ordered phase with distinct orbital polarization on two sublattices without lattice distortions has been found in 155 to account translational symmetry we introduce the phase multiplier exp i to the wave function at site i i 1 2 3 in the following form exp c q q i iii 4 to eliminate arbitrariness in the choice of phase factors c in iii 4 one needs gauge condition for the phase fields a first order approximation let us consider the case of small wave numbers q q 0 then in the first order approximation a gauge condition can be chosen as follows the phases 0 and k k 1 2 3 of the wave functions p z r 2 d and pz k r 2 d k 1 2 3 respectively are the same for pz electrons in the expressions iii 1 iii 2 due to iii 4 by virtue of the arbitrariness in the choice of phases at q 0 the phases in the first order approximation were chosen the same for all lattice sites at power series expansion on a small parameter 1 0 v f 0 in the right hand side of ii 11 one can neglect the second term for small wave numbers q then accounting the fact that the mass term ab ba ba ab vanishes in the dirac point one gets ba 2 d pab ab e 0 0 v f 0 ab iii 5 in this case the exchange interaction terms iii 1 iii 2 are given by the matrixes with real integrands it turns out that with such a phases choice for p z r 2 d and pz k r 2 d we obtain an imaginary part for the energy e 0 in iii 5 without the mass term 139 141 the deviations of the first order approximation from the massless dirac fermion model 29 are of the order of q 4 136 6 a b c d fig 1 models n 2 a n 3 b pz electrons

iii 12 eigenvalues e 1 i i 1 2 of iii 13 are functions of c the gauge condition is imposed as a requirement on the absence of imaginary parts in eigenvalues e 1 i i 1 2 of iii 13 this condition can be written as a system of two equations of the form m e 1 i 0 i 1 2 iii 14 direct solution of this system turns out to be unstable for some specific points in the momentum space instead for every point in the momentum space we use a minimization procedure with the price function f c c m e 1 1 m e 1 2 its absolute minimum evidently coincides with the solution of the system iii 14 the phase factors c iii 4 entering iii 13 periodically change their values on the polar angle with the period in fig 2 and hence our model describes 2 d z 2 topological insulators 156 159 the gauge fields c hold hexagonal symmetry near the dirac point k k and are rotated on 60 with respect to each other in figs 2 a d at high momenta the gauge field c changes symmetry to octagonal one in q space as figs 2 c b demonstrate the behaviour of the phases c c in figs 2 a d is the same and hence they describe the same gauge field the gauge field fluctuates strongly and is characterized by the hexagonal symmetry near the dirac point k k due to phase entanglement c c a core of vortex is observed in figs 2 a d so that c c fluctuate least of all at the boundary of six identical sectors of the circle with the increase of the excitation energy e q the value of the gauge field begins to increase only in one of three pairs of sectors of the circle in figs 2 a d with the increasing e q the amplitude of the fluctuations decreases and 2 d z 2 topological phase is originated the phases c c become two different gauge fields as it is shown in figs 2 c f and hence the gauge field is deconfined the phase c changes sharply its sign four times due to the eight fold dirac cone for the deconfined quasiparticle state at large excitation energy e q high momentum q in fig 2 g the phases c c start to fluctuate strongly with the decrease of the value e q as for example c dependency demonstrates in fig 2 h c dichroism of the dirac bands deconfinement nodal lines and drumhead surface states a helicoidal spin

defect as a core of vortex in the in fig 3 b d this topological defect is a majorana zero energy mode multiple vortices structure of these bands is visualized in the form of concentric circles of varying degrees of helicoidality and different widths the spin valley orbit texture varies in both space and time dichroism of arpes spectra is a manifestation of the electron orbit pseudo precession in inset to fig 3 d since the pseudo majorana modes are simultaneously their antimodes majorana sinks vortex cores are simultaneously majorana sources antivortex anticores sinks and sources locating at the same place braid particles and holes into majorana fermions deconfinement which splits the four fold particle hole dirac cone should lead to the divergence of the locations of sinks and sources meanwhile a nodal ring nld an image of which is schematically presented in fig 3 e separates the region of eightfold splitting of the dirac cone in fig 3 a the left and right hand pz electrons possess relativistic total angular momentum j 3 2 due to soc after the deconfinement the emergent tilted dirac cones which have been introduced earlier as tilted dirac cone replicas in 133 break the vortices in fig 3 c d vortex current lines pass from one vortex cores to others the connections of different vortices form an infinite number of fermi arcs which link divergent majorana sinks and anti sinks hence together with the nodal ring nld four more pairs of weil nodal lines are formed divergence of sinks and sources transforms the brainding majorana excitations into another type of massless fermions in such a way that their vacuum core and anticore states become uncorrelated thus before the deconfinement the secondary quantized wave function always describes a fermionic state entangled with a particle hole pair whereas after the deconfinement the non correlated vacuum spin up and down states lead to su 2 su 2 o 4 symmetry 9 a b c d e fig 3 band structure with the majorana zero

system 160 for certain crystal groups describing nodal line semimetals quasiparticles are eight fold degenerate fermions with su 2 holonomy of wave functions wilson loop 212 213 54 55 thus the majorana particles decay into a continuous set of weyl nodes and a number of quasiparticle excitations in such a decay channel does not change since the number of particles remains unchanged the luttinger theorem still holds indeed the hole particle pockets are observed in arpes spectra for nodal line tis 56 161 in the q 4 model iii 5 with dumping nodal lines decay into a discrete set of wey nodes 38 now we can predict features of band structures which should be observed in arpes of topological sms removing the degeneracy of zero energy majorana mode leading also to divergence unbraiding of majorana sinks and sources yields as well to two additional nodal rings nl 1 and nl 2 as it is shown in fig 3 e nld nli i 1 2 form a contour of drumhead like states dispersing inwards with respect

place of touching of nl 1 and nl 2 majorana sink and source form a dirac like band orthogonal to the origin dirac band as it is shown in fig 3 e such a band structure shown in left inset to fig 3 e is a feature of type ii topological weyl sms as wte 2 mote 2 26 56 161 162 so the spin valley currents coupling which is small on the energy turns out to be topologically protected by emergent vortices d majorana dynamical mass operator and chiral anomaly eigenvalues of the mass operator ab ba ii 5 are represented in fig 4 these values are the dynamic masses of particle and hole components of the majorana state since the eigenvalues are equal to zero in the dirac points k k majorana zero energy modes exist in our model let us prove that the chirality of zero energy modes is preserved in the dirac points within the approximation of zero gauge phases the first order approximation c k and respectively zero valued gauge fields the eigenvalues 10 of the mass operator differ by two orders of magnitude from each other outside of the dirac point as one can see from the comparison of particle and hole masses in fig 4 a b since the mass operator is not diagonal in the energy representation of the massless hamiltonian h 0 the masses of majorana fermions are obtained by mixing particle and hole states the density of 2 d states dos holds the van hove singularity 163 because dos is divergent in the dirac point since a hyperbolic point saddle is a feature of the dependence of mass on momentum in fig 4 a b this singularity remains after including the mass term therefore particle and hole densities are concentrated at the energy e 0 that leads to particle hole annihilation since the mass term is alternating in one point the chirality is preserved for the majorana zero energy modes only in the first order approximation there is no such a neighborhood of the dirac point where the mass term takes zero values and hence the dirac bands are not chiral everewhere except of the dirac points thus dichroism of the bands can not be described in the zero gauge field approximation in what follows we show that dichroism can be observed in the second order approximation the comparison of particle and hole masses in fig 4 a c demonstrates that in the second order approximation of non zero gauge fields c q qualitatively the same momentum dependence remains for one of the mass operator eigenvalues the dependence of the mass term second eigenvalue upon the momentum in fig 4 d exhibits a singular alternating behaviour and gets a zero values in the vicinity of the dirac point it means that chirality is preserved not only in the dirac point but in the dirac band as well meanwhile the dichroism is observed outside the dirac point but only one of two right or left hand majorana modes remains chiral the appearance of the mass term peak in fig 4 d leads to divergence of dos at some another value of the energy e that makes the particle and hole densities spatially separated from to each other as a result there exist non zero energy majorana modes in the model n 3 without particle hole annihilation a b c d fig 4 eigenvalues of the mass operator in approximations of zero a b and non zero c d gauge fields a c for particles holes b d for holes particles values of spectral weight spectral function a q are much higher for a heavy particle than for the light one accordingly the dielectric permeability of the system of heavy particles is very small compared with those of the system of light ones 164 hence low intensive fermi arcs of the heavy particle hole components of majorana states augment much more intensive fermi arcs of the light ones up to fermi particle hole pockets therefore the luttinger theorem is not violated in our approach moreover the examples of the narrow gap chalcogenide pbme me te se s being graphene three dimensional analogue 165 166 and of doped mott insulator la 2 xsrxtio 3 167 appear to take the heavy mass route so the construction and simulation of the mass operator in the topological sm theory point to the main difference of the chiral lattice theory of particle hole pairs from the theory of majorana fermions a majorana mass term lm for left hand l and right hand r majorana wave functions reads lm l t 0 l l t 0 l owing to r l and hence chirality of the majorana theory is broken everywhere except of zero energy states 21 contrary to that in our majorana like theory the second eigenvalue of the mass term equals to zero in the vicinity of the dirac point and therefore the chirality breaks for only one constituent of a particle hole pair the violation of the law of conservation of topological charge in the form of weak imbalance in the number of topological charges of the opposite signs is a feature of our theory it is called a chiral anomaly iv charge carrier transport in the model n 3 an equation with accounting of electron photon interactions in the semimetal can be obtained from ii 11 by ordinary use of the

and proves the existence of charge transport in topological sm with equal number of electrons and holes as charge carriers at higher values of chemical potential contrary to the massless dirac fermion model of graphene conductivity with one region of negative values of oii for a doped sm in our non abelian sm model with pseudo majorana excitations there exist two regions with negative values of dielectric permeability oii in fig 6 a one of these regions is stipulated by high value of chemical potential due to doping the second one is the region of plasma oscillations owing to the presence of majorana modes value of the optical conductivity opt e 2 4 for sm model with majorana model and the massless dirac fermion model coincide in the visible optical range and are equal to opt e 2 4 in fig

186 the heterostructures at m 0 are superlattices with center of inversion when dirac electron and hole cone of band structures are degenerated accordingly coincidence of van hove singularities of

negative values of the dielectric permeability are regions of plasmonic oscillations where the complex frequencies kpl i kpl satisfy the following equation 188 189 m oii k z i e o ii k z 0 z i v 6 16

according to simulation presented in fig 8 a m oii k at 10 10 k is practically constant function in the model n 2 and hence the expression v 7 diverges therefore contrary to the model n 3 the plasmon

sm model n 3 with skew topological currents in zero magnetic fields this splitting peak is stipulated by non zero curvature of the majorana model in the model n 3 there exists a mechanism for dynamical reduction of spatial dispersion of states this dynamic reduction provides a non zero value of minimal dc conductivity of graphene plasmonic oscillations in the massless dirac fermion model occur in electrophysic frequency range 2 hz but practically dump instantly contrary to this the plasmonic oscillations in the majorana like massless fermion model have a finite dumping rate and exist both in optical and electrophysic frequency ranges significant advantage of the proposed majorana like fermion theory augment by a mixing mass term over the massless dirac fermion and weyl sm models consists in the achieved qualitative and quantitative consistency with experimentally observable properties of topological semimetals the z 2 topological sm model with the flavors number n 3 can be

interaction s 11 s 12 in tight binding approximation are deter mined by eqs iii 1 iii 2 of the main text in the direction perpendicular to the sm layer the integration has been limited to a distance equals two c c bond lengths the phases have been chosen as ka kb simulations of the band structure have been performed for two variants of approximation to the exchange operator the first one already mentioned above is the series expansion of the exchange matrices on deviation of the wave vector from the dirac point up to 4 th order in the length of wave vector q as it has been shown in 136 139 this approximation leads to small imaginary part for the energy spectral line width this in fact not very bad as it effectively corresponds to a finite decay the approximation of the zero gauge phases is valid in the dirac point the second approximation is the use of the exchange interaction matrices calculated based on pz orbital wave functions with full exponents and with non zero gauge phases see the detail of the approximation in 38 138 139 141 the last approximation holds real eigenenergies for all wave vectors the condition of the real values for the energy playing a role of the gauge condition in the second approximation has been achieved by minimization on respect to a given phases set of its imaginary part this results into finite accuracy at the energy evaluation in situation with non zero phases numerical simulations of eigenenergies have been performed for approximately 3500 200 grid points r in 2 d q space for the purposes of subsequent estimation of charge transport

t and the one particle green function g 1 x x x x 160 one can express the product of the field components entering in the form of multipliers in s 15 through g 1 r r r r t t as g 1 r r r r t t 1 2 u r r t t u r r t 1 2 u r r t and through g 2 x x x x as g 2 x x x x 2 x x x x now we take into account the linear in ai terms only in eq s 15 then after the standard procedure of transformation of the

it is shown in fig 4 therefore d ab ba dpab i 0 near the majorana zero energy state and respectively the third term in the equation s 16 is also equal to zero b low frequency limit of the conductivity in the models n 2 and n 3 with spatial dispersion let us analyze the behavior of the low frequency conductivity of the models n 2 and n 3 with spatial dispersion of charge carriers first let us prove the following theorem theorem 1 low frequency conductivity of the charge carriers system with spatial dispersion for the n 3 model in contrast to the model n 2 takes nonzero finite values at frequencies 1 proof self energy operator self is expressed through the polarization operator as 164 self k g 1 i v k k s 17 where v k is the coulomb interaction operator in the momentum representation g 1 is the one particle green function in the neighborhood of the dirac point the one particle green function of negatively positively charged carrier is g 1 1 k let us use the feynman diagram technique the feynman diagram for has the form the feynman representation for i v k is a wavy line for holes the left hand side of the expression s 17 is 29 represented by the diagram self k g 1 whereas the right hand side of s 17 is given by the diagram i v k k using the diagram technique the expansion of the expression s 17 into perturbation theory series is written as s 18 here by the cross there have been marked crossed out lines the first and the second terms in the expansion s 18 are called the hartree fock approximation for xc the rest terms are for correlation interaction correlation energy self xc c let us account for terms up to the second order in series on v in s 18 as s 19 from the form of the first and the second diagrams in expansion of s 19 it follows that the hartree fock approximation xc x v self consists of the exchange x and the self consistent coulomb potential v self which is the polarization correction of the first order on interaction v from the another side the self energy self k is the interaction energy for the current of charge carriers with an electromagnetic field a k 0 self k 0 0 e a k 0 0 j a k 0 here are the dirac matrices 0 is the vacuum state in the hartree fock approximation s 19 electron hole decay is absent m xc k 0 and respectively in this approximation we can rewrite imaginary part of the expression s 17 through the photon creation and annihilation operators a k a k as m 0 j a k 0 m i 2 v 2 k rpa k g 1 m i v k 1 k g 1 s 20 where 1 i v k rpa rpa is the polarization operator in the random phases approximation rpa expressing current component j through the complex conductivity k as j k a k and using commutation relations one can transform s 20 to the following form m k 0 a k a k 0 m v k 1 k g 1 s 21 where the vacuum expectation 0 a k a k 0 from the commutator a k a k is a photon propagator 1 2 k 2 for the case of small spatial dispersion k 0 one has g 1 1 and the expression s 21 becomes optical alternating current ac conductivity 164 iv 2 k rpa k i 1 s 22 where 1 v k 1 is a complex dielectric permeability now let us consider the case of spatial dispersion of states k 0 0 at very small frequencies 1 in the model n 2 of massless pseudo fermions with spatial dispersion the expression s 21 for the hole conductivity min having positive values is transformed to the form m min k k m iv k 1 k s 23 because of k 0 in accord with formula s 22 the left hand side of s 23 gains physical positive values if the real part of the polarization operator 1 in the right hand side equals zero the last means that the direct current dc conductivity minimal dc conductivity min in the model n 2 is equal to zero in the model n 3 the action of the operators xrel ab iii 1 and x rel ba iii 2 provides the squeezing k kab of the part of states and respectively the expression for s 23 is transformed to the following m min kab m iv 2 kab rpa kab kab s 24 if vf kab due to dynamic decrease of spatial dispersion there could exist part of quasi particle states s 24 it is possible because can not gain the values less than vacuum frequency 0 the last means that in the model n 3 30 min can get non zero value as well as optical conductivity thus we prove that contrary to the n 2 model the model n 3 can demonstrate non zero dc conductivity let us write down the fourier laplace image of the operator vab in the coordinate representation of secondary quantization e te p r b x vix x b x dt d r s 25 because of the fact that the operator vab does not depend on time trace tr of the fourier components of s 25 in

from time to imaginary time in order to find fourier laplace image of the expression s 25 at finite temperatures t in this representation the fourier image of one particle green function g 1 r 1 r 1 t

accordance to fig s 3 c all quantities necessary for calculation of the complex conductivity have been calculated on a grid in the space of wave vectors with 200 discretization in angle for every given wave number q and variable step a denser grid at small wave numbers and larger at large ones to the maximum wave number qmax 0 44 ka 2 d interpolation on this grid has been used to integrands evaluation in the intermediate points that is necessary for conductivity simulations an error stipulated by the interpolation from the grid in wave vectors space has been roughly estimated by interpolation of the conic spectrum of dirac pseudo fermion model on the same lattice with subsequent usage of the interpolation data for evaluation of the conductivity its value turns out to be less than 10 3 total estimation of the conductivity error has been performed by variation of the number of points used for inter polation of the energy band spectrum by diminishing this number at factor two and subsequent comparison of the simulation results in both cases it turns out to be not exceeding 10 in the considered frequency region it should be noted that the error bars for values of the
