ny 11794 and glimmanalytics llc usa m c lee new york university new york ny 10012 usa dated july 14 2021 we construct several quantum gauge theories in 4 dimensional space time including both abelian and non abelian gauge groups with the abelian gauge fields coupled to zero mass matter fields the construction occurs in a fixed finite euclidean spatial domain the construction begins with the doubly cutoff bare field theory with a finite space time volume and a mesh based ultraviolet cutoff constructed in a separate paper we use a limited range of renormalized perturbation theory just sufficient to cancel all the diver gences we demonstrate convergence of the ultraviolet limit and of the renormalized perturbation theory when summed to all orders we construct the fully renormalized lagrangian and schwinger functions i introduction we construct ultraviolet uv converged renormalized perturbation theory rpt converged solutions of super renormalizable quantum gauge fields in 4 dimensional space time we consider either a abelian gauge groups coupled to a matter field or na non abelian gauge groups with no matter field for a we consider a u 1 group minimally coupled to a real massless scalar field because the fluid is massless the quantum field is super renormalizable a four particle feynman diagram defines the coupling constant this has multiple types labeled by the di mension of the lie algebra g of the gauge group and the dimension of lie algebra gmf for the fully renormal ized theory all these charges are unity in all cases the coupling constant has mass dimension 1 it is a physics parameter that specifies the model and completes the definition of the lagrangian it is constant throughout the remormalization the equations of motion for the matter field in the coulomb gauge are the isotropic newtonian i e conven tional fluid navier stokes and euler equations 10 12 the bare theory lagrangian order n 0 of rpt is constructed using wick ordered products of annihilation and creation operator in the standard manner these free fields become nontrivial through the introduction of the bare n 0 lagrangian lu 1 g a 1 1 4 f a f a g 2 dimgmf a 1 d a d a 1 electronic address glimm ams sunysb edu electronic address jarret petrillo stonybrook edu electronic address mcl 674 nyu edu here g is the coupling g constant between the gauge fields and the matter fields the latter assumed to be parame terized by the lie algebra gmf of the matter field to have a single coupling constant we assume that the lie group of this matter field is simple additional details for this construction are given in a separate paper our methods allow complex as well as real matter fields and allow coupling to a zero mass boson field of a lie algebra of an arbitrary compact simple lie group i for na we deal with the pure and super renormaliz able yang mills theory the bare lagrangian is lym dim g a 1 laym dim g a 1 1 4 f a f a 2 the base space is r 4 or a finite cube with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions and is contractible it follows that spatial translations and thus fourier trans forms are defined on the bundle convergence of rpt was established for qed 3 1 3 our methods are simpler than the hopf algebra formal ism 14 commonly used to address rpt combinatorics and lead to stronger conclusions a the gauge field lagrangian we work in a euclidean framework we refer to 13 as well as 5 whose analysis is valid for any simple compact non abelian gauge group as stated in 5 p 265 as stated above we also consider the u 1 gauge theory coupled to a matter field our starting point is the classical gauge lagrangian density which is in full generality is given by 12 l g 2 4 dim g a 1 f a f a lmf 3 http arxiv org abs 2107 05981 v 1 mailto glimm ams sunysb edu mailto jarret petrillo stonybrook edu mailto mcl 674 nyu edu 2 where g is the lie algebra of the gauge group g and lmf is the matter field lagrangian if present there are two complications in the construction of the quantum theory the need to fix a gauge and the presence of ghost states on this basis we rewrite 3 to obtain the modified bare lagrangian lmod dim g a 1 lay m l a gf l a gf lmf 4 where lagf is the gauge fixing term and l a gf is the ghost field modification see also 13 chapter 15 especially sect 15 6 15 7 in the lorentz gauge aa 0 the gauge fixing term has the form lgf dim g a 1 1 2 aa 2 5 where the limit 0 is understood with this choice of gauge we avoid the constraint equation that occurs with the axial gauge 13 for some purposes it is convenient to impose a coulomb gauge with t x 0 as the time parameter and with a uniform euclidean metric for x 1 x 2 x 3 our re sults are not affected by this choice b ghosts the most serious modification to the lagrangian re sults from the presence of ghosts conceptually the ghosts arise from the gauge invariance of 4 degrees of freedom within an orbit under the gauge group are not physical and must not be quantized thus quanti zation occurs properly only on a quotient space which is the space of gauge group orbits this quotient space is implemented through the addition of fermion ghost op erators c and anti ghost operators c in the fadeev popov formalism 13 a nilpotent op erator q qq 0 is defined on the field configuration elements as a map whose null space is the physical states and whose image defines equivalence classes of states with identical physics that is the space of gauge group orbits from this description we see the identity of the fadeev popov formalism discussed in 13 and the quotient space and quantization over a space of orbits 5 in this formalism lgf ab c m abgf c 6 and adapted from 5 formula 2 283 m ab gf 2 ab g abcac 7 the ghost states are not observable and the observ able states that is the schwinger functions and the fock space they define are constructed through division by the subspace spanned by products of ghost state operators applied to a vacuum state we avoid the ghosts by the following theorem theorem ib 1 ghost states are not required in a computation that uses only gauge invariant terms proof gauge invariant terms such as f a f a are inde pendent of their representative in a gauge orbit chosen to express them thus they are well defined quantities on the space of gauge orbits as a result the division by the space of ghost states has already achieved that is the ghosts states do not enter in the calculation or its results in quantum electrodynamics conventional renormal ization has been carried out using only gauge invariant counter terms 4 the equation of motion for the gauge field in the absence of a matter field is d f a ja 8 according to 13 formulas 15 3 6 and 15 3 7 this is a completely gauge invariant expression in this paper we will obtain the rpt and uv limits in a gauge invariant fashion hence we never introduce ghost states in this paper ii kubo theory a finite rpt and the continuum limit we give an overview of our technical methods the key estimates are power counting to assess the size uv asymptotics of an individual term in the rpt expansion and combinatorics to estimate the number of terms to which the uv estimates apply the terms of rpt can be understood in terms of feynman diagrams our results overlap in part with conclusions reached through use of hopf algebras 14 our cumulant based methods are simpler and the results are more satisfactory cumulants are central to kubo s ideas 7 an historical survey 6 of cumulant expansions relates them to the laplace central limit theorem and to chebyshev and hermite polynomi als a complication of the small asymptotics is their nonuniformity expressing terms in momentum fourier transform space with dependence on momenta p gives estimates of the small asymptotics that are not uniform in the sense that their validity depends on a uniformity assumption that the distinct momenta pi are constrained to tend to infinity with their relative magnitudes lying within a fixed ratio isolated subsets of pi can have more divergent less convergent properties here the weak sobolev norm solves the problem the small asymp totics have uniform uv divergence or convergence prop erties when a common sobolev norm is applied to all of 3 the integrand variables for rpt convergence this norm has the negative index 2 with 0 the uv sobolev norms are not suitable for addressing uv convergence to study uv convergence we use the more powerful second variation estimates in terms of par ticle irreducible diagrams these diagrams are uv con vergent so that their convergence can be studied using a sobolev norm of positive index 0 in this series each variable satisfies a power counting estimate in a sobolev norm of index 0 variational properties of a lagrangian are best un derstood in an exponential formalism which we adopt here the kubo expansion 7 is term by term identical to renormalized perturbation theory it has the advan tage of a natural formulation in log variables so that the analysis occurs in the exponent using the theory of cu mulants quantum field theory lagrangian analyses are often considered in the exponent the log variables in the kubo analysis are described in terms of cumulants the kubo analysis is represented graphically in terms of diagrams that express correlations among subsets of variables the diagrammatically con nected state represents a physically fully renormalized state in contrast the starting point of renormalization with the bare or unrenormalized state has no correla tions expressed among the variables that define the inte grand of the feynman diagram according to established graphology of feynman dia grams it is conventional to divide out the disconnected diagrams and consider only the connected diagrams this is accomplished with the kubo cumulant expansion the consequence of this division and the elimination of disconnected diagrams is examined computationally in terms of bell numbers in sec ii c and leads to a pois son statistics evaluation for the expectation values with a 1 n combinatorial factor the bell number analysis of the cumulant expansion allows a combination of the combinatoric and power counting estimates in a single expression our proofs depend on this formula and its generalizations our improvement on the kubo rpt expansion is through the use of prime sequences which enforce a wick ordering for the two factors of a quadratic term in the lagrangian through the use of prime sequences we re duce a combinatoric count of n to n a critical step in the proof of convergence of rpt these ideas are ex tended to mass diagrams having 2 external legs they are also extended through a cumulant expansion for a second variational derivative of the vacuum and mass di agram cumulant series application of a second moment variational derivative to the series leads to one particle irreducible diagrams and uv convergence a fourth vari ational derivative allows consideration of 2 particle irre ducible diagrams continuation of this methodology to a sixth order variational derivative and 3 particle irre ducible diagrams is not possible as it introduces non renormalizable field theories schwinger functions on the base space are gauge covariant but not gauge invariant they do not bene fit from the double factorials occuring in the lagrangian analysis accordingly we restrict the order i e the num ber of variables j in the definition of the schwinger func tions to be bounded by a small power of n the order of the rpt expansion for the lagrangian with this restriction the external field lagrangian which is the generating function for the schwinger functions is also convergent in effect the schwinger functions borrow convergence factors from the lagrangian sum and both are convergent b moment generating functions with two particle types we apply kubo s cumulant method and its infinite or der generalizations 7 to dim dim g dimmf type particles compromising both gauge field and matter field lagrangian terms let represent the vacuum expectation value of polynomials in dim random variable with x 1 xdim representing the quantum field operators of the possible particle types let 1 dim x 1 1 x dim dim denote momenta defined by the xj the moment generating function is defined as m 1 dim exp dim i 1 ixi 1 0 dim 0 dim j 1 j j j 1 dim 9 we define the cumulant generating function k by the formula k logm then k logm 1 dim dim j 1 j j j 1 dim 10 where the prime on the sum indicates omission of the term 1 dim 0 the cumulant is defined by 10 we improve on the estimates for the rpt of the la grangian with a combinatorial bound n replacing the n coming from the kubo analysis and also through consid eration of the second and fourth variational derivatives of the kubo cumulant series an explicit evaluation of is given by a formula from 8 as quoted in 7 a survey of these formulas is pre sented in 6 the sums over partitions and the factorials can be understood as originating in multinomial expan sions we start with a partition p of 1 n into p non overlapping subsets of size mi we form a sum over all such partitions in the formulas for k each parti tion summand is a product of correlations running over the indices within the partition these factors are multi 4 plied by a sign to ensure subtractions and divided by the factorial i to reflect multiplicity of the terms let ki denote the size of the i subset of p so that n p i 0 ki and mij is the number of type j particles occuring in mi let mi mi 1 midim and mi xmi 11 x midim dim the formula for the cumulant is dim j 0 j n p 1 p 1 1 p 1 p i 1 kimij j p i 1 mkiij ki dim j 0 mij 11 what appear to be minor errors in the formula from 7 have been corrected c poisson statistics we define a cumulant connected or kubo diagram for an n system as an unlabeled n node graph where edges correspond to cumulant connected subsets the usefulness of this abstraction comes from the con nection between cumulant connectivity and statistical in dependence theorem iic 1 kubo two groups of random variables are independent if and only if every between group cumulant average is zero rpt describes a cumulant as a sum of moments the inverse expansion equates the moments with a cumulant connected sum the number of distinct n diagrams is the number of partitions of n this is called the bell number a closed form evaluation of the bell numbers is not known but they satisfy dobinskii s expression theorem iic 2 the nth bell number is bn 1 e j 0 jn j 12 with b 0 1 as an identity after taking expectation values n 0 bnx n n exp ex 1 13 eq 13 defines the exponential generating function for the sequence of bell numbers bn the multivariate version of this formula is eexp dim j 1 jxj exp e dim j 1 jxj 1 14 proof see 11 for proof of 13 see 7 for 14 the factor 1 n in 13 can be seen as arising from a symmetry needed to ensure interchangablity of identical random variables definition iic 1 a feynman diagram is one particle reducible if it contains at least one line whose removal makes the resulting diagram disconnected it is one particle irreducible if it is not one particle reducible theorem iic 3 consider the cumulant rpt expan sion for the vacuum state el 0 we denote the sec ond gauge invariant variational derivative of the vari able xn of this series as gi 2 xn gixn 2 15 where by gi we understand a variation using only gauge invariant quantities the differentiated series has the explicit evaluation n 0 bn n gi 2 xn gixn 2 n 2 nbn n xxn 2 n 0 bn 2 x n n 1 ex 1 exp ex 1 16 the multivariate generalization of 16 is given by n 0 bn n gi 2 dim j 0 jxj n gi dim j 0 jx j 2 n 0 n 2 bn 2 n 2 dim j 0 jx j n e dim j 0 jx j exp e dim j 1 jx j 1 17 proof we observe that the gauge invariant functional derivative forces the consideration of a single coupled upper lower index pair to be differentiated as a single unit the first variational derivative selects one of the n upper indices to differentiate while the second is con strained to differentiate the lower index that is paired to the selected upper index the first differentiation of xn yields nxn 1 the second differentiation is simply divi sion by x in combination the two differentiations yield nxn 2 the two variational derivatives remove two factors of x from the vacuum series a substitution of n 2 by n completes the proof of the first two equalities of 16 the same variational derivative applied to the third member of 16 completes the proof theorem iic 4 in the cumulant expansion for the second variation rpt 16 17 the series is connected and in the cumulant series of the second variation the terms of the vacuum series are one particle irreducible 5 proof any cumulant is connected the second vari ation operator maps any one particle reducible line in the rpt expansion to a feynman graph which is dis connected we evaluate the second variation in its own cumulant expansion where the disconnected pieces can not arise the formula for variational derivatives can be carried to any order 2 n with an extension to the multivariate case which we do not write down explicitly the cumu lant expansion for the fourth variational derivative leads to two particle irreducible diagrams and computation of bare and renormalized charges the latter being unity the proofs follow along the lines given above details are omitted proposition iic 4 gi 2 n exp ex 1 gi exp ex 1 2 n n 1 ex 1 n exp ex 1 18 proof the proof is induction on n iii feynman diagrams a vertex insertions we explain methods for the manipulation of feynman diagrams rpt is applied to construct the renormalized lagrangian and the hilbert space on which it acts for each term we define el as the number of external legs in a diagram which is the number of field variables present in the term to develop these ideas in detail we introduce the con cept of a vertex insertion a vertex is a product of the field operators f a f a and if matter fields are present which we allow in the abelian case d and d these can be interpreted as traditional feynman dia grams of rpt in the rpt expansion of the lagrangian as stated above only gauge invariant insertions are al lowed thus the bare insertions are f a f a and with matter fields present d d we focus on the num ber el of external legs in the diagram the type and order of the field variables these legs represent in more detail we consider a feynman diagram g and a subdiagram g 0 g the insertion consists of replac ing g 0 by another graph g 1 for this to make sense the external legs of g 1 must match in type number and order with the lines of g that join g 0 to g g 0 these vertex insertions can be interpreted as a manipulation of traditional feynman diagrams of rpt the simplest vertex insertion a bare vertex is a single term from the lagrangian it has two external legs el 2 and so it is a mass insertion any insertion in rpt for the la grangian is gauge invariant as rpt for the lagrangian is expressed completely in terms of gauge invariant quan tities we consider the values el 0 2 and for renormalizable theories el 4 to define vacuum el 0 mass el 2 and charge el 4 renormalization values of el 4 give rise to nonrenormalizable field theories and are not considered through use of cumulant exponential variables we consider only connected diagrams and for el 2 only one particle irreducible diagrams el 4 diagrams are uv finite graphs with el 2 or el 4 play only a technical role in our convergence studies all terms in the rpt expansion of the lagrangian are gauge invariant and thus are single valued functions on the base space the schwinger function expansion does not follow this rule and becomes single valued on the base space only when restricted to a chart subsequent el rpt steps assume that the vacuum ex pansion is complete graphically this means that the graphs are connected for el 2 b prime sequences we analyze prime sequences a concept which appears to be new we are looking at diagrams that do not fac torize this is the meaning of prime we restrict the analysis to rpt for the lagrangian proposition iiib 1 any vertex that arises in the rpt expansion of the lagrangian is gauge invariant it has an even number of external field lines of each type the numbers of upper and lower lines balance that is they occur in pairs with equal numbers of upper and lower factors for each type of field proof the gauge invariance of the individual terms of rpt for the lagrangian when organized in a gauge invariant fashion is derived in 13 the remaining state ments follow from the definition of gauge invariance there are no tadpoles el 1 and no n 3 vertices in the rpt expansion of the lagrangian such vertices do occur in the rpt expansion for the schwinger functions which are not constrained by gauge invariance definition iiib 1 any estimate or constant is called universal relative to the models considered here if it depends on the quantity dim dim g dimgmf we next identify the starting and final state of the rpt expansion with fixed el definition iiib 2 a bare el vertex insertion is uniquely defined by the types and order of its external lines and by its integrand which is a product of prop agators one for each matched pair of el vertices of a specified type the propagators are proportional to p 2 in fourier space in accordance with power count ing rules definition iiib 3 the physical el 0 insertion marks the end of rpt for the vacuum state with a 6 connected diagram and no external legs the physical insertion of an el 2 vertex which marks the com pletion of rpt for a el 2 is the connected kubo diagram with the given type of external legs proposition iiib 2 each prime sequence has exter nal legs of a single type only for fixed el the number of prime sequences is finite with a universal bound proof there are no type labels on the el 0 vac uum diagrams and a universally in the sense of defini tion iii b 1 bounded number of prime sequences for the mass diagrams el 2 orientations among the matter field indices and the gauge field indices are also uni versally bounded basis element choices are universally bounded c the rpt integrand the individual terms of the lagrangian as they occur in the rpt analysis of the lagrangian are called bare insertions each lagrangian term of type a corresponds to a specific quadratic term in the lagrangian xaxa with angle brackets denoting the bare vacuum expectation value the expectation value xaxa is a feynman diagram for each diagram we need to consider multiplici ties combinatorics and the diagram integrand whose uv asymptotics are determined by power counting with a universal constant multiplier per variable each quadratic term xaxa has an integrand defined by the product of two propagators 1 p 21 a and 1 p 2 2 a specific to the type a this is the full diagrammatic description of the bare lagrangian vacuum at the level n 0 of rpt we consider the elementary step of breaking a type a line that is a factor xaxa for a a becomes a type a mass line influenced by type b particles the rpt term for this insertion is xaxa xbxb xbxb 19 combinatorially in this step b is incremented by 2 and a is unchanged as a simple analysis the number k of factors is incremented from k to k 2 so that a global k combinatorial factor results the subtraction yields one term with the original in tegrand and one term with two type b propagators re moved to take advantage of the cancellation from the subtraction we use the formula 1 1 0 dx x 1 x 2 20 which expresses the difference in 19 as the average of the square composite of the two propagators if we assume 1 m m for some m we have improved the propagator by one power of some integrated composite propagator assuming the propor tionality limit on the momenta the improved uv power law asymptotics is valid outside of these limits the nominal increase in uv asymptotics is subject to sub variable divergences proposition iiic 1 the integrand of the feynman diagram for order n of rpt equals the average of a symmetric mixture of n propagators proof 9 next we evaluate the mass integrands the mass di agrams refer to the mass of a type a particle and thus have a type a label with a second label b 6 a for the type b mass effect upon the type a particle mass as with the vacuum diagram we subtract its vacuum ex pectation value the mass diagram propagators can be realized by a construction which follows the vacuum renormalization we replace the line xa with the second order correlation matrix xaxa xbxb xbxb 21 as the first order mass diagram of type a in a line of type a due to the influence of a type b particle diagrammatically we think of breaking a line repre senting an a propagator and replacing the new vertex thus created by a pair of b lines the difference due to a minus sign and partial cancel lation between two terms again improves the uv con vergence by one propagator of type b and the difference is again realized by 16 iv the converged uv and rpt limits we now consider the bare vacuum expectation values of the u 1 theory that gives rise to the navier stokes equation and the pure super renormalizable yang mills theories the lagrangians 1 2 are gauge invariant thus they are globally single valued on the base space also ac cording to standard power counting rules they are are uniformly proportional to 2 with uniform coefficients of proportionality where is the lattice spacing we estimate uv convergence properties in a weak sobolev norm of index 2 with 0 this statement is uniform in all above models to justify power count ing to assess uv divergences a sobolev norm of positive index is used with a uniform index and coefficient remark iv 1 consider a cauchy sequence in some variable v n depending on the uv length and the rpt order n we let 0 be the larger of the two s in the sequence and n 0 the smaller of the two rpt orders n assuming that 0 and n 0 occur in a single term convergence of the cauchy sequence in the small and or large n limit signifies the asymptotic vanishing of v 0 n 0 in 0 and or n 0 7 in using this remark we apply bell number upper bounds to the differences between the individual pairs of the cauchy sequence we obtain bounds on the cauchy sequence member proportional to the least converged larger of the cauchy sequence pair definition iv 2 we define ren as the natural loga rithm of the el 0 rpt lagrangian series we de fine the renormalized lagrangian lren as the natural logarithm of the sum of the convergent el 2 rpt lagrangian series the series lren can be divided into the sum of the gauge term lgf ren 1 4 dim g a 1 f a ren f a ren 22 and in the case of u 1 the matter field term lmf ren g 2 4 dim gmf a 1 d a rend aren 23 theorem iv 1 the lagrangian rpt series is uv and rpt convergent in the converged uv rpt limit the vacuum energy is zero the norm of the physical vacuum state is 1 and the field strength renormalization is 1 for each particle type each particle type has mass 0 the renormalized charge is zero proof in proving convergence of the cauchy sequence we appeal to 16 17 in this formula we obtain an up per bound of the convergence by replacing each jx j by maxi ix i in effect we choose the most highly divergent of the subdiagrams continuing with the examination of worst cases we embed the one particle irreducible line in the smallest possible el prime diagram the most diver gent least convergent case is the bare el diagram this diagram can have no subdiagram divergences above the order of the diagram as a whole meaning that all lines are equally divergent or convergent to the same order the divergence for the diagram as a whole is 2 el 2 and the convergence per line is el 2 el 1 2 el 0 except for el 0 or el 2 thus the proof is reduced to the consideration of vac uum and mass diagrams that is the value of ren mren lke ren and lmf ren with a sum over types in all three cases we make use of proposition iii c 1 to express prop agators of rpt order n as an average of symmetrized propagators by consideration as above of prime se quences we reduce the divergent subsets of the integrand to the case of a single renormalized vacuum mass or mat ter field diagram in this case the product of the prop agators is p 2 n so that the cumulant variable x 0 in 16 17 at infinite order rpt it follows that x 0 and sub stituting in 13 we have exp e 0 1 exp 0 1 so that ren 1 the same reasoning is applied to the el 2 expansion so that x 0 in 16 17 to show that the field strength renormalization for each mass of the system is 1 and the strength of the matter field la grangian is also unity the vacuum energy is computed from the expectation of the hamiltonian in the vacuum state this is the dif ference between the kinetic and potential energy terms in the lagrangian in the present case the sign is not relevant because each of these is zero the energy of the vacuum state is 0 the particle masses are given by the renormalized vac uum expectation values of the cumulant for the second variational derivative of ren we evaluate the particle masses and similarly the charge a fourth order varia tional derivative as zero according to proposition ii c 1 theorem iv 2 there is a 0 with the following property the schwinger functions are uv and rpt convergent assuming that j n in the combined or der j schwinger function expansion and the order n lagrangian expansion proof with the fourier transforms defined on the triv ial bundle the proof is a repeat of previous estimates v conclusions we lay out a physics road map which might follow from the results derived here we consider two extreme cases if there is no limit placed on the total system en ergy the temperature is infinite and zero mass gluons are observed if there is some effective bound on the system energy the temperature is zero and a phase transition re sults the zero mass gluons are replaced by positive mass elementary particles constructed as projective planes and connected product higher genus projective planes 1 j dimock ultraviolet stability for qed in d 3 j math phys 59
