povms are equivalent to projections for perfect state exclusion of three pure states in three dimensions povms are equivalent to projections for perfect state exclusion of three pure states in three dimensions abel molina institute for quantum computing and school for computer science university of waterloo january 25 2019 performing perfect conclusive quantum state exclusion means to be able to discard with cer tainty at least one out of n possible quantum state preparations by performing a measure ment of the resulting state this task of state exclusion has recently been studied at length in 5 and it is at the heart of the celebrated pbr thought experiment 31 when all the prepara tions correspond to pure states and there are no more of them than their common dimension it is an open problem whether povms give any ad ditional power for this task with respect to pro jective measurements this is the case even for the simple case of three states in three dimen sions which is mentioned in 11 as unsuccess fully tackled in this paper we give an analyt ical proof that in this case considering povms does indeed not give any additional power with respect to projective measurements to do so we first make without loss of generality some assumptions about the structure of an optimal povm the justification of these assumptions involves arguments based on convexity rank and symmetry properties we show then that any pure states perfectly excluded by such a povm meet the conditions identified in 11 for perfect exclusion by a projective measurement of three pure states in three dimensions we also dis cuss possible generalizations of our work includ ing an application of quadratically constrained quadratic programming that might be of special interest 1 context and motivation the task of quantum state exclusion corresponds to a setting where an agent alice is given a quantum sys tem the state of this system is chosen at random be tween n options 1 n with corresponding non zero probabilities p 1 pn it is unknown to alice which of the i was chosen but she does know the i and pi values characterizing the corresponding distri bution alice s goal in the state exclusion task is to be able to give an index j such that the state was not pre pared in the state j when alice can achieve this with probability 1 we will say that we have perfect state ex clusion this task of state exclusion has recently been studied at length in 5 and is at the heart of the cel ebrated pbr thought experiment 31 where 11 the article from where we take the problem we solve is cred ited as the original source for the concept the concept of this task has also been used for proving results in the context of quantum communication complexity 24 30 as well as for designing quantum signature schemes 2 formalizing further this concept of state exclusion 5 obtains the following semidefinite programming sdp formulation minimize i pi mi i subject to i mi i mi 0 1 where mi 0 means that mi is positive semi definite being able to perform perfect state exclusion corre sponds to the optimal value of this sdp being equal to 0 similarly any optimal solution to the semidefinite program corresponds to an optimal positive operator valued measure povm for state exclusion note that since we are only concerned with perfect state exclusion we can just ignore the pi in the rest of this presentation since whether the value of the sdp is 0 or not does not depend on them perfect exclusion of quantum states is also a meaning ful concept in the context of the foundations of quantum mechanics in particular when considering the topic of quantum state compatibility in that framework one considers several quantum states 1 n as differ ent beliefs about the same system then one can ask whether the outcome of a measurement on the system will disprove some of these beliefs or they will all still be possible in the latter case we say that the states are compatible with each

orcid org 0000 0003 2618 3071 quantum state compatibility 11 proposes several for malizations one of which corresponds to the impossi bility of performing perfect state exclusion since this formalization is a generalization of previous work by peierls 28 they refer to it as post peierls pp com patibility in more detail the post peierls compatibility of sev eral quantum states 1 n relative to a subset s of all povms means that for all measurements in s there will be at least one outcome that can be ob tained with non zero probability for all of the possible states beliefs 1 n if we consider the negation of this definition we obtain that this negation corre sponds with the existence of a measurement in s such that each outcome of the measurement excludes at least one of the quantum states which corresponds to an agent being able to perform perfect state exclusion given a mixture of the quantum states 1 n and ac cess to measurements in s when the set s of allowed measurements corresponds to the set of all povms the corresponding compatibility criteria is called pp povm compatibility when s is restricted to the set of projective measurements or more precisely the set of measurements defined by one dimensional orthogo nal projectors 11 names the corresponding criteria as pp odop compatibility one can consider the case where all of the n states beliefs 1 n are known to belong to a par ticular subset a of all quantum states and ask whether for all such tuples of n beliefs in a the pp odop and pp povm criteria will coincide with each other when this happens we will say that in that context pp odop pp povm note that this is equivalent to pro jections being optimal for perfect state exclusion within the context of input states in a in 11 the authors identify a necessary and sufficient condition for pp odop incompatibility of 3 pure states a b c in 3 dimensions i e they establish a condition for the states to be perfectly excludable via a projec tive measurement this condition can be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of their inner products given by a b a c b c and which we will denote as j 1 j 2 and j 3 respectively in particular the condition obtained in 11 is that 3 pure states will be pp odop incompatible whenever j 21 j 2 2 j 2 3 2 j 1 j 2 j 3 1 2 we will refer to this formula as the caves fuchs schack inequality after the authors of 11 note that we have corrected in our presentation of this for mula the original strict inequality sign that they use following the indications in 6 33 and we have also merged the two conditions from the original presenta tion in 11 into one single condition when this result was introduced in 11 it was men tioned that the authors were not able to prove that pp odop pp povm in the context of 3 pure states in 3 dimensions despite having numerical evidence that this is the case the authors also present results es tablishing that this is the first open case they cite previous work 25 showing that for two pure states in any dimension pp odop pp povm and establish that for k 2 pure states in 2 dimensions this will not necessarily be the case we will give now an analytical proof which an swers the corresponding question by showing that pp odop pp povm in the context of 3 pure states in 3 dimensions our work can be seen as part of the line of work that studies povms in the context of low dimensional sys tems of a fixed dimension for example 36 and 38 re cently examined 2 dimensional povms in the contexts of nonlocal games and quantum state discrimination re spectively while 40 looked into 4 dimensional povms in the context of imposing symmetry conditions we conclude with a discussion about different ways in which our work might be generalized of special interest here might be our discussion on the usage of quadrati cally constrained quadratic programming qcqp to model the n dimensional variant of the question we solve this is a type of mathematical optimization for malism that has seen a large number of applications in recent years but only limited usage so far within the context of quantum information processing to our knowledge this is the first time that state exclusion of pure states through projections is expressed through a problem in a standard form of a mathematical optimiza tion framework in our derivation we will use standard quantum in formation theory notation and vocabulary standard texts on the topic e g 37 39 can be consulted for definitions of the corresponding terms 2 main derivation 2 1 restrictions that can be imposed without loss of generality on povms that achieve perfect exclusion our goal is to prove that for any set of 3 pure states in 3 dimensions that are perfectly excluded by a povm they are also perfectly excluded by a projective mea surement following equation 1 and our analysis of it we can identify the perfect exclusion of three pure states a b and c with obtaining an optimal value of 0 in the following semidefinite program accepted in quantum 2019 01 14 click title to verify 2 minimize a m 1 a b m 2 b c m 3 c subject to i mi i mi 0 3 note that all the operators involved can be represented as 3 3 matrices it is well known in convex optimiza tion that the solution to optimizing a linear function over a non empty compact convex set in a finite di mensional hilbert space can be assumed without loss of generality to be an extreme point of the set of feasible solutions 1 note that in this case that feasible set is the set of povms therefore we can assume that at most one out of the mi has rank greater than 1 otherwise assume for the sake of contradiction that two of them saym 1 andm 2 have rank at least 2 so there is a com mon vector u in the images of m 1 and m 2 then for small enough both m 1 uu m 2 uu m 3 and m 1 uu m 2 uu m 3 are povms which implies m 1 m 2 m 3 is not an extreme point of the feasible set without loss of generality we can permute indices so that the ranks of m 1 m 2 and m 3 are sorted in non increasing order also if m 1 has rank 3 it cannot exclude any quantum state so it must be the case that its rank is at most 2 note too that if the ranks are of the form 1 1 1 it is not hard to see that the con dition m 1 m 2 m 3 i implies that m 1 m 2 m 3 form a projective measurement themselves similarly in the case where the ranks are of the form 2 1 0 m 1 i m 2 implies that m 1 and m 2 form a pro jective measurement this is because for the right hand side i m 2 to have rank 2 m 2 must have its non zero eigenvalue equal to 1 which implies then the same for the eigenvalues of i m 2 m 1 we can assume then without loss of generality that there is an optimal povm m 1 m 2 m 3 with ranks of the form 2 1 1 we can also choose now without loss of generality to work in a basis such thatm 1 is diagonal and it perfectly excludes a 0 we have then that m 1 will be determined by the choice of a real diagonal vector 0 1 x 1 y and m 2 and m 3 by a choice of complex vectors v v 1 v 2 v 3 and w w 1 w 2 w 3 such that m 2 vv and m 3 ww we claim now that we can assume y 0 v 1 6 0 w 1 6 0 v 2 6 0 w 2 6 0 v 3 0 w 3 0 to see why consider the following five observations 1 this fact follows from applications of the krein milman and extreme value theorems which in their most general versions require in fact constraints less strong than the ones we have here 1 the condition m 1 m 2 m 3 i corresponds to the equations v 1 v 1 w 1 w 1 1 4 v 2 v 2 w 2 w 2 x 5 v 3 v 3 w 3 w 3 y 6 v 1 v 2 w 1 w 2 7 v 1 v 3 w 1 w 3 8 v 2 v 3 w 2 w 3 9 2 we can assume v 1 6 0 and w 1 6 0 as otherwise m 1 m 2 m 3 can be trivially transformed into a projective measurement to see this suppose for example that w 1 0 then 4 implies that v 1 1 7 that v 2 0 and 8 that v 3 0 we have then that m 2 is diagonal and its diagonal is equal to 1 0 0 this implies that m 3 is diagonal as well while w 1 0 implies that the first term in its diagonal is equal to 0 so we can group m 1 and m 3 into a single operator and obtain a projective measurement 3 suppose we had v 2 6 0 and v 3 6 0 then 9 implies w 2 6 0 and w 3 6 0 this means we can divide 7 by 8 and the conjugate of 9 and obtain that v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 v 3 w 3 let be the value of these ratios then each of equations 7 9 implies that 0 which contradicts v 1 6 0 4 we have then that either v 2 0 or v 3 0 and by symmetry we can assume without loss of gen erality that v 3 0 then w 3 0 as well since otherwise 8 would imply w 1 0 which we know not to be the case 6 implies then that y 0 5 if we were now to additionally impose that v 2 0 7 would imply that w 2 0 which can only happen when x 0 by 5 however in the x 0 case we have thatm 1 is a projection on 1 and 2 andm 2 andm 3 can be merged into a projection on 0 so there trivially is an optimal projection for state exclusion and the case is not of interest to us we can assume then that v 2 6 0 and similarly that w 2 6 0 we can introduce now a parameter r which deter mines the distribution of the weight x between m 2 and m 3 and let v 2 2 be equal to x 1 r 1 r 0 we have then that 5 implies w 2 2 x r r 1 and that 7 and 4 imply then that v 1 2 r r 1 w 1 2 1 r 1 the magnitudes of each element of v and w are then com pletely characterized by the values of r and x accepted in quantum 2019 01 14 click title to verify 3 as for the phases of the elements of v and w we can assume that v 1 w 1 r without affecting the values of m 2 and m 3 then if the phase of v 2 is given by 7 implies that the phase of w 2 is given by we reach then our final form for what a povm m 1 m 2 m 3 for perfect state exclusion of 3 pure states in 3 dimensions can be assumed to be without loss of generality in matrix form it is given by m 1 0 0 00 1 x 0 0 0 1 10 m 2 1 r 1 r e i rx 0 ei rx x 0 0 0 0 11 m 3 1 r 1 1 e i rx 0 ei rx rx 0 0 0 0 12 where 0 x 1 r 0 0 2 2 2 verification that any states perfectly ex cluded by our parametrized optimal povm satisfy the caves fuchs schack inequality we look first at the structure of the states b and c per fectly excluded by m 2 and m 3 and obtain that it is enough to consider a one parameter family for each of them let b be given by b 1 b 2 b 3 and c by c 1 c 2 c 3 then our conclusion follows from the following five ob servations 1 as usual we can get rid of unphysical global phases and assume b 1 is a real positive number this is because multiplying b by a phase will not affect the value of our semidefinite program 3 and it will not affect either the satisfaction of the caves fuchs schack inequality 2 it can be seen from 11 that the value of b 2 is com pletely determined by the value of b 1 by the con straint m 2 b 0 which is equivalent to b m 2 b 0 since m 2 is hermitian in particular one obtains that b 2 b 1 ei r x 3 the fact that b has norm 1 since it represents a pure state allows us now to express the magni tude of b 3 as a function of b 1 in particular the magnitude of b 3 is given by 1 b 21 1 r x while its phase which we will denote by can take any value note that this implies an upper bound on b 21 given by 1 1 r x 4 a similar analysis applies to c and we have that it can be parametrized by a real positive value c 1 such that 0 c 21 1 1 1 rx together with the phase of c 3 in this case the value of c 2 is given by c 1 ei 1 rx and the magnitude of c 3 is given by 1 c 21 1 1 rx 5 we can assume now that the phases and of b 3 and c 3 are selected in order to maximize the left hand side of the caves fuchs schack inequal ity the reason we can do this is because we are interested in proving that the caves fuchs schack inequality holds so this is a worst case scenario in our situation to do so note that j 1 b 1 and j 2 c 1 so they do not depend on the phases of b 3 and c 3 therefore maximizing the left hand side of the caves fuchs schack inequality will be equivalent to maximizing j 3 b c to do that we compute first the value of b c given by ei 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx b 1 c 1 1 x b 1 c 1 13 the magnitude of this expression will be the largest possible whenever the term in the first line inter feres constructively with the term in the second line this will happen whenever the first line term is also real and has the same sign as b 1 c 1 1 1 x we can in fact achieve this by picking since 0 x 1 we obtain then that in our worst case situation j 3 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx b 1 c 1 1 x 1 14 the caves fuchs schack inequality is expressed then in our case as j 23 b 2 1 c 2 1 2 j 3 b 1 c 1 1 15 where j 3 is given in 14 x 0 1 r 0 b 1 0 1 1 r x c 1 0 1 1 1 rx we will refer from now on to the left hand side of 15 as f x r b 1 c 1 if b 1 0 or c 1 0 a simple al gebraic manipulation of the value of j 3 gives us that f x r b 1 c 1 1 expanding the value of j 3 we have that f x r b 1 c 1 is given by accepted in quantum 2019 01 14 click title to verify 4 b 21 c 2 1 1 1 x 2 2 x 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx 2 b 1 c 1 1 x 1 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx b 21 c 2 1 2 b 2 1 c 2 1 1 x 1 2 b 1 c 1 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx 1 b 21 r x c 21 1 rx c 21 b 2 1 2 x 2 1 x r 1 r 2 b 1 c 1 1 x 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx to prove that this is less or equal than 1 one can act similarly to the standard proof for x 1 x 2 moving everything to one side of the inequality and writing as a square what one obtains in more detail multiplying by x and dividing by b 21 c 2 1 our last expression we have that f x r b 1 c 1 will be less or equal than 1 whenever 2 1 b 21 1 r x 1 c 21 1 1 rx r 1 c 21 1 r 1 b 21 2 x r 1 r 16 observe now that both sides of this inequality are positive this is trivial for the left hand side and fol lows for the right hand side from the previous obtained upper bounds on b 1 and c 1 if we square both sides of this inequality and simplify the resulting expression we obtain r 2 1 c 41 2 c 21 1 1 r 2 1 b 41 2 b 21 1 2 1 c 21 1 b 21 1 b 21 c 2 1 1 0 17 this can be rewritten as r 1 c 21 1 1 r 1 b 21 1 2 0 18 which is true so we have successfully proved that a b and c satisfy the caves fuchs schack inequality and therefore can be excluded by a projective measurement note that x is not involved at all in 17 although one can verify computationally that the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side of 16 does depend on x 3 perspectives for generalization 3 1 usage of quadratically constrained quadratic programs qcqps we will now discuss how to study the perfect exclu sion of n pure states by a projection through a collec tion of quadratically constrained quadratic programs qcqps for a situation with a n dimensional com plex variable x and m constraints the standard form for such a program can be taken to be minimize x gx subject to x ckx lk k 1 m 19 where the lk take real values and g and the ck are n n hermitian matrices this is a type of mathematical optimization formal ism that has received considerable attention in recent years with wide ranging applications in science and en gineering see 1 9 19 22 for just a few amongst many relevant examples there has also been a considerable number of results about the theoretical structure of the corresponding problems and the design of algorithms that can solve them see e g 20 21 26 however there have only been a handful of applications so far 4 14 23 34 of the qcqp model to quantum informa tion processing in our collection of qcqps there will be one program for every n combination with repetition s 1 sn out of the set w 1 wn of states to be excluded each choice represents a possibility for how the states ex cluded after obtaining different outcomes of the projec tion relate to each other and the reason why we need to consider those choices is that two different outcomes of the projection could plausibly lead to excluding the same state which in the povm case would be handled by grouping those two outcomes into the same one in particular each of the corresponding qcqps for perfect state exclusion via projections formalizes the following two ideas a projection in n dimensions corresponds to a choice of n unit vectors v 1 vn that are pair wise orthogonal we would like for every vi to be orthogonal to the corresponding si accepted in quantum 2019 01 14 click title to verify 5 these ideas are then reflected in the following qcqp minimize i v i sis i vi subject to v i vj v j vi 0 i j 1 n s t i j v i vi 1 i 1 n vi cn i 1 n 20 note that we have written v i vj v j vi 0 rather than v i vj 0 in order to have the matrix representing the constraint be hermitian as required in 19 one can then go as usual from an equality with 0 constraint to two constraints of inequality with respect to 0 we can also write v i vi 1 rather than v i vi 1 making usage of the fact that such a change does not alter whether the value of the program is 0 or not also while for ease of presentation we have stated the problem with n variables they can be easily combined into one sin gle variable taking values in cn 2 in order to obtain a program of the exact same form as 19 the number of such programs in dimension n that we need to consider is given by the number of n combinations with repetition out of a set of length n equal to 2 n 1 n while asymptotically this will scale very quickly as a function of n it will still be com putationally tractable for values like n 5 or n 6 which goes beyond the theoretically understood range of up to n 3 to compute the final answer one will take the minimum value out of all the programs if this value is equal to zero then the states w 1 wn can be perfectly excluded with a projection while if it is a non zero value then perfect state exclusion of the set w 1 wn will not be possible as for its applications to future results there are two main consequences of the formalism we just described beyond the indirect consequence of our work possibly inspiring further usage of the qcqp framework within quantum information processing the first of these consequences correspond to our newfound ability to use results about qcqps in or der to obtain new structural results about the perfect exclusion of pure states through projections one can straightforwardly check that basic weak duality results will not help since the value of the lagrangian dual programs will always be zero however as we discussed earlier there is an ongoing stream of non trivial theo retical results about qcqps and it seems reasonable to conjecture that some of those results will eventually apply to the highly structured programs that we con sider the second of these consequences corresponds to the increased potential for the usage of standard mathemat ical optimization packages while the work on solver software supporting qcqp is not yet at a stage giving a simple path for an implementation of the programs described by 20 it seems reasonable to expect that such a stage will be reached in the near term then such a piece of software could be compared with an other one that implements the program in 1 from this one would obtain a numerical study through stan dard solvers of the difference between povms and pro jections for perfect state exclusion of n pure states in n dimensions 3 2 direct generalizations of our proof a naive approach for generalizing our result would start by considering conditions equivalent to the caves fuchs schack inequality in the 4 dimensional case however this seems far from trivial since the original derivation in 11 presents obstacles to such a general ization in particular it relies on the fact that when using the basis determined by an excluding projection the sums corresponding to the inner products between two of the perfectly excluded states a b c will have ex actly one non zero term this makes it relatively easy to obtain formulas for the coefficients of a b and c in that basis as a function of the inner products between the states however solving the corresponding equations in 4 dimensions seems like a significantly more com plicated task as each inner product between excluded states involves not 2 but 4 non zero coefficients it could also be fruitful to take a geometrical perspec tive in order to better understand the situation at hand following the approach in 7 to see at an intuitive level what this might be like one can start by observing that the space of density matrices is a section of the con vex cone of positive semidefinite matrices also the space of probability distributions with 3 outcomes can be seen as an equilateral triangle with each vertex of the triangle corresponding to a different deterministic distribution then as one can see in chapter 10 of 7 for any fixed 3 outcome povm the map which takes a density matrix to the probability distribution associ ated with applying the povm to the density matrix will be an affine map from the convex cone section to the equilateral triangle in light of these facts we can interpret any limits to state exclusion via projectors as saying that three points close to each other in the section of the convex cone cannot be sent to 3 different faces of the trian gle by an affine map corresponding to a projection as otherwise some points in the section would be sent out side the triangle which is not allowed then our result that projections are equivalent to povms can be seen as saying that in the case of pure states this does not accepted in quantum 2019 01 14 click title to verify 6 change when we also allow the affine maps correspond ing to non projection povms it might be interesting to fully formalize this thought mathematically prove in this framework the known results about limits to state exclusion and see if it is now easier to extend them to the case of 4 pure states where the space of outcomes of a 4 outcome povm can be seen as a regular tetra hedron another way in which a geometric perspective might useful would be for obtaining a constructive algorithm that transforms an excluding povm into an excluding projection for the case we analyze in this paper 3 pure states in 3 dimensions it seems plausible that obtain ing such an algorithm would then give insight about how to generalize our result along the lines of using state exclusion characteriza tions alternative to the one given by 1 the work in 18 considers a generalization of the explicit perfect state exclusion criteria given in 11 for the 2 dimensional case however it finds this generalization to be a suf ficient condition for the n dimensional case but not a necessary one this work also observes that if pure states are perfectly excluded via a povm they will be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0 of the corresponding povm element and they can be assumed to be an ele ment of its spectral decomposition then one can con sider the feasibility of an optimization program where one tries to fill in the remaining coefficients and vectors in the spectral decomposition of the povm elements while one might expect at first glance that the stan dard sdp framework in 1 would offer a greater chance of applying mathematical optimization results perhaps the fact that this formulation is closer in its shape to the qcqps in 20 could help make non trivial connections between the projection case and the povm case note too that the main insight that leads to our result is the fact that one can take a povm for perfect state exclusion to be an extremal one this does not triv ially lead to an answer since there are extremal povms that are not projections such as those in the family in equations 10 12 however an analysis of what the ranks of an extremal povm in 3 dimensions have to look like allows us to obtain a parametrization of the situation that can be algebraically solved the usage of more sophisticated facts about the structure of extremal povms such as those facts derived in 17 27 32 could be similarly involved in a generalization of our results to higher dimensionality in fact these consid erations seem to us a very likely ingredient of any such generalization 3 3 other considerations it might also be of interest to find relations between the optimality of projections for tasks involving povms and the optimality of unitaries without the use of an cillas for certain tasks involving channels discussed for example in 3 8 specially considering the numerical ev idence suggestive of such kind of connection identified in 3 5 when doing so it might also be of interest to consider results such as those in 15 that charac terize from a computational complexity point of view the power of computing with unitaries as opposed to general quantum channels note too that for the case of mixed states state ex clusion is mathematically equivalent to state discrimina tion the discriminated states would be those we obtain by computing i i this means one can apply exist ing results about optimal measurements for mixed state discrimination 13 16 and also consider the chance for generalizing results 12 35 that look into the optimal ity of projections for state discrimination of pure states relatedly as we discussed earlier the work in 11 gives a characterization for perfect exclusion of 2 dimensional pure states that makes it clear that for any number of k 2 states in 2 dimensions projections are not nec essarily equivalent to povms it is the case that they additionally use a reduction to that setting to point out that for three mixed states in three dimensions projec tions are not equivalent to povms within the context of perfect state exclusion note as well that if one considers the possibility of constraining the number of non zero components of a perfectly excluding povm the possibility of doing so simply corresponds to being able to perfectly exclude a subset of the set of states under consideration another related variation one might want to study is requiring that there are no zero components of a perfectly exclud ing povm as considered in 18 one could also look into determining whether the re sults here carry over to the gradual measure of pp incompatibility defined in 10 which is the value of the sdp in 1 when the uniform distribution is as sumed this would correspond for example to asking whether projections are optimal for state exclusion of 3 pure states in 3 dimensions even when perfect exclusion cannot be achieved by povms if that was successfully answered it would be natural to relax assumptions even further and consider arbitrary distributions 29 offers a partial answer to these questions by giving for an ar bitrary number of pure states a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal excluding povm that is a projection this is the condition that there is an optimal povm such that none of the outcomes are perfectly ex cluded and we also have that the pure states are linearly independent accepted in quantum 2019 01 14 click title to verify 7 note that the qcqp framework discussed in sec tion 3 1 extends without issues to the variants of the problem discussed in the previous paragraphs in par ticular if one wishes to study the exclusion of k 6 n states one can simply write w 1 wk rather than w 1 wn for the set of states to be excluded giving rise to k n 1 n rather than 2 n 1 n programs of the form in 20 similarly if one wishes to study mixed states rather than pure states or introduce a probabil ity distribution on the states one can simply modify the objective function in 20 by replacing the values of sis i with a corresponding i and combining them with a multiplicative term pi respectively furthermore if one wishes to study non perfect state exclusion the programs given in section 3 1 can be used towards that purpose without additional modifications as for the variant that limits the number of non zero components of a perfectly excluding povm it will correspond to limiting the number of distinct terms that can appear in the n combinations with repetition of w 1 wn that characterize the programs in 20 similarly the requirement that there are no zero com ponents of the povm corresponds to requiring that every state is excluded by a measurement outcome and therefore to only considering the n combination given by s 1 sn w 1 wn acknowledgments thanks are due to
