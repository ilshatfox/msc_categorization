exhaustive tables 17 of grad shteyn and ryzhik 1 and when i fed this problem to maple 18 and to mathematica 11 both software programs choked even the great augustin louis cauchy 1789 1857 who posed the problem got the answer wrong on his first try there is no hope to evaluate 1 by first computing an explicit an tiderivative of the integrand the failure of standard computer pro grams to produce an elementary antiderivative is compelling evidence that there is none skeptical readers can prove the nonexistence by in voking the theory of differential fields as illustrated in the expository article 25 by maxwell rosenlicht 1924 1999 mathematicians of the 19 th century knew so many special tricks for evaluating definite integrals that the dutch scholar david bierens de haan 1822 1895 could write a book 3 on the topic the approach to the integral 1 that likely occurs to a mathematician of the 21 st century is cauchy s residue theorem for functions of a complex vari able indeed the application of complex analysis to solve purely real problems is nowadays a familiar idea 22 euler s formula for the complex exponential function implies that ee ix ecos x i sin x ecos x cos sin x i sin sin x accordingly a conceivable method for attacking 1 is first to integrate the expression ee iz z z 2 1 around a suitable contour and then to take the imaginary part of the result the integral

the original integration path is not a closed curve the integral 1 appears 11 appendix formula 25 in a long list of integrals that cauchy evaluates 2 in a memoir of 1825 that is often viewed as the origin of the residue theorem observing by symmetry that 1 is half the integral over the whole real line cauchy deduces the incorrect value 1 2 e 1 e for 1 he soon corrects the mistake 13 p 139 acknowledging that a mishandling of his powerful new tool is the cause of his smashed thumb 3 the influential philosopher imre lakatos 1922 1974 emphasizes in a seminal book 20 that new concepts and theorems are generated by proofs not the other way around two examples that he cites from the work of cauchy are a purported proof of euler s formula for polyhedra and a purported proof of continuity of convergent series of continuous functions both of which lakatos views as good arguments in search of valid theorems similarly the residue calculus represents a remark ably successful technique even though cauchy s implementations lack accurate hypotheses my goal in this article is not merely to supply a sound calculation of the integral 1 but also to formulate and prove natural theorems that realize cauchy s original vision my treatment differs from the standard exposition of the residue calculus in modern sources so many cooks have seasoned the residue broth during the past two centuries that the recipe now has become codified in a form that loses sight of cauchy s simple initial conception i present in a few paragraphs 4 a self contained development of the part of cauchy s theory needed for evaluating integrals over the real axis although i do not aim to compete with comprehensive studies of the history and applications of cauchy s work on complex integration such as 23 26 and 7 i do hope to counteract a false impression students get from current textbooks that cauchy epitomizes precision and rigor to me browsing cauchy s sprawling oeuvre is like exploring 2 i write about cauchy s work in the present tense on the grounds that his mathematics is timeless 3 cauchy s confession of error appears in a footnote the hammer metaphor is my own 4 amusingly a catchphrase of the prolific cauchy is en peu de mots literally in a few words cauchy s residue sore thumb 3 the nooks and crannies of a hyperactive child s tree house a convoluted structure improvised from scrap lumber and bent nails remodeled and elaborated over many years the continuing attraction of the edifice consists in the ingenuity of the creation the lofty location and the expansive views from the windows 1 first aid some preliminary observations about the integral 1 are useful cauchy actually includes three positive parameters a b and r in the integral thus 2 0 ea cos bx sin a sin bx x x 2 r 2 dx the integral 1 is the special case in which a b r 1 the number b in 2 can be considered a fake parameter in the language of 24 indeed replacing bx with a new variable u produces the equivalent integral 0 ea cos u sin a sin u u u 2 br 2 du since this integral depends on b and r only through the product br there is no loss of generality in setting b equal to 1 once the value of the integral is known when b 1 the general value can be obtained by replacing r in the answer by br when b 1 why does the improper integral 2 converge since the expression ea cos x sin a sin x is an antisymmetric odd function of x the integral of this quantity over the symmetric interval is equal to 0 periodicity implies that the integral of the same expression vanishes over every interval of width 2 therefore the magnitude of the integral r 0 ea cos x sin a sin x dx is no more than the magnitude of the integral over half a period hence is bounded above by ea for every r the expression x x 2 r 2 is decreasing when x r and has limit 0 when x so dirichlet s test for integrals 8 p 430 implies that the integral 2 converges when b 1 hence for every positive value of the fake parameter b the convergence is a delicate issue however for the improper inte gral 3 0 eae ibx x x 2 r 2 dx 4 harold p boas of which 2 is formally the imaginary part actually diverges to see why let f x denote the sum of the series n 1 aneibnx n ibn absolutely convergent when x is a real number and observe that the derivative f x equals eae ibx 1 adding and subtracting 1 in the integrand then making use of an explicit antiderivative of x x 2 r 2 and finally integrating by parts shows that r 0 eae ibx x x 2 r 2 dx r 0 eae ibx 1 x x 2 r 2 dx 1 2 log 1 r 2 r 2 f r r r 2 r 2 r 0 f x r 2 x 2 x 2 r 2 2 dx 1 2 log 1 r 2 r 2 the function f is uniformly bounded on the real line since n 1 aneibnx n ibn 1 b n 1 an n ea 1 b therefore f r r r 2 r 2 0 when r and lim r r 0 eae ibx x x 2 r 2 dx 1 2 log 1 r 2 r 2 0 f x x 2 r 2 x 2 r 2 2 dx since f is bounded the improper integral on the right hand side con verges absolutely by comparison with the convergent integral 0 x 2 r 2 1 dx thus the integral 3 diverges at a logarithmic rate accordingly the idea of computing cauchy s integral 2 by first evaluating 3 seems to be a nonstarter following cauchy s lead i will show nonetheless that the residue method succeeds when 2 is sneakily realized as the imaginary part of the convergent integral 4 1 2 eae ibx 1 x x 2 r 2 dx 2 cauchy s rectangular mallet in 1814 the twenty five year old cauchy must have been pleased when the french academy of sciences accepted his long submission about the evaluation of real definite integrals especially since his bid for election to that august body had failed the year before 15 p 206 but the actual printing of his article was delayed until 1827 by which time cauchy had published improved accounts of his theory superseding the first paper i will focus on the following statement from cauchy s 1814 article 14 the ore me 1 p 713 paraphrased in modern language if f x yi is holomorphic that is complex analytic except for some simple poles cauchy s residue sore thumb 5 and if limy f x yi 0 for every x and limx f x yi 0 for every y then the integral f x dx along the real axis equals 2 i times the sum of the residues of the function f in the upper half plane essentially the same statement appears in the 1823 write up of his calculus lectures 10 lec on 34 p 136 cauchy s hypotheses actually are not sufficient to guarantee validity of the conclusion as his mistaken initial evaluation of 1 reveals his 1826 correction strengthens one hypothesis 13 the ore me vi to the still inadequate assumption that x yi f x yi tends to 0 when y but cauchy s new method does give the right answer for many ex amples including this one 14 p 758 5 0 x sin bx x 2 1 dx 2 e b when b 0 cauchy knows that this formula is correct since he is aware of an al ternative derivation 21 p 100 by pierre simon laplace 1749 1827 further on cauchy points out 14 p 789 that this integral depends discontinuously on the parameter b since the left hand side of 5 ev idently vanishes when b 0 yet the right hand side reduces to the limiting value 2 this example challenges a belief cherished by many calculus students that discontinuities appear only in artificial esoteric situations cauchy s main observation is that computing the integral of a func tion from a point x 1 y 1 to a point x 2 y 2 in two different ways either along a horizontal path from x 1 y 1 to x 2 y 1 and a vertical path from x 2 y 1 to x 2 y 2 or alternatively along a vertical path from x 1 y 1 to x 1 y 2 and a horizontal path from x 1 y 2 to x 2 y 2 produces iden tical answers if the function is holomorphic in the rectangle bounded by the indicated line segments see figure 1 and if the function has singularities inside the rectangle then the two integrals differ by a cor rection term equal to 2 i times the sum of the residues of the function inside the rectangle my paraphrase is anachronistic cauchy does not have the present terminology of line integrals path integrals and only in 1826 does he introduce the word residue 12 expressed in today s language the proof is straightforward stu dents and teachers of multivariable calculus should recognize the argu ment from the proof of green s theorem in the plane 5 to say that a 5 although the remarkable george green 1793 1841 privately published his essay concerning the three dimensional theorem in 1828 his work became known only after his death but that is another story 9 18 6 harold p boas x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 figure 1 two paths from x 1 y 1 to x 2 y 2 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 figure 2 evaluating f x complex valued function f of the two real variables x and y is holomor phic means intuitively that the function depends only on the combina tion x yi the complex variable z a more precise statement is that the partial derivative of f with respect to y equals i times the partial derivative with respect to x assuming as cauchy does implicitly that the partial derivative f x is continuous apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to rewrite the two dimensional integral of f x over the rectangle as y 2 y 1 f x 2 y f x 1 y dy see figure 2 similarly the two dimensional integral of f y over the rectangle equals x 2 x 1 f x y 2 f x y 1 dx cauchy s residue sore thumb 7 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 figure 3 localizing the singularities when f is holomorphic the second two dimensional integral equals i times the first the geometric interpretation is that the line inte gral f x y d x yi around the oriented boundary of the rectangle equals 0 if f has some simple poles first order singularities then a correction term needs to be computed to say that f has a simple pole at z 0 with residue equal to the complex number c means that the difference f z c z z 0 1 is holomorphic near z 0 or equivalently can be expanded near z 0 in a taylor series in powers of z z 0 adding and subtracting integrals along suitable line segments and then discarding vanishing integrals over rectangles that avoid the singularities as indicated in figure 3 reduces the problem to calculating 1 z z 0 dz around a square centered at z 0 making a translation and a dilation converts the problem into showing that 2 i equals the value of the counterclockwise line integral 1 x yi d x yi equivalently x yi x 2 y 2 d x yi around the square with vertices at 1 1 symmetry considerations show that the preceding integral equals 4 1 1 i t 2 1 dt or 4 i arctan 1 arctan 1 or 2 i as claimed higher order singularities can be handled too as cauchy makes explicit in 13 the ore me ii p 131 but this refinement is not needed for the main examples cauchy s application is to put the bottom edge of the rectangle on the real axis and to let the top and the sides zoom off to infinity he supposes wrongly that if the function vanishes at infinity then so do the limits of the integrals over the line segments and he deduces 8 harold p boas that the integral of the function over the real axis equals 2 i times the sum of the residues of the function in the upper half plane at this stage in the development of his theory cauchy is not thinking about integrals over general simple closed curves rectangles suffice for evaluating integrals over the real axis issues about domains do not concern cauchy for most of his ex amples involve concrete elementary functions i will suppose that all functions in question are holomorphic on an open neighborhood of the closed upper half plane except for finitely many isolated singularities using his new invention of singular integrals cauchy can allow poles on the real axis but i will assume for simplicity that all the singular points have nonzero imaginary part with these conventions in force cauchy s method can be formalized rigorously as follows theorem 1 after cauchy if the improper integral 0 f x yi dy tends to 0 when x and if for each bounded interval i the integral i f x yi dx tends to 0 when y then f x dx equals 2 i times the sum of the residues of f in the upper half plane for the proof fix a small positive number and invoke the hypothe ses to say that for all sufficiently large positive numbers a and b the integrals 0 f a yi dy and 0 f b yi dy have absolute value less than 3 and every singular point of f has real part between a and b fix such numbers a and b and use the meaning of conver gence of an improper integral to deduce that for every sufficiently large positive number c the integrals c 0 f a yi dy and c 0 f b yi dy have absolute value less than 3 by hypothesis the number c can be chosen additionally large enough that the integral b a f x ci dx has absolute value less than 3 consequently the integral of f over the rectangle with opposite corners a 0 and b c not only equals 2 i times the sum of the residues of f in the upper half plane but also differs from b a f x dx by less than since is arbitrary the doubly improper integral f x dx converges and has the required value the problem to which cauchy has no adequate solution is to specify readily verified conditions on the integrand to guarantee that the hy potheses of the theorem hold the assumption that limy i f x yi dx 0 certainly holds when f x yi tends to 0 uniformly with respect to x when y this assumption may be what cauchy has in mind when he says that limy f x yi 0 but he lacks the concept of uniform convergence the property certainly holds when f is a rational function whose denominator has higher degree than the numerator for then f x yi decays at least as fast as a constant cauchy s residue sore thumb 9 times 1 x yi and this expression is uniformly bounded above by 1 y when y a trickier issue is to identify simple but widely ap plicable conditions on f to control the integrals on vertical lines there is no trouble working with a rational function if the degree of the de nominator is at least 2 larger than the degree of the numerator for then f x yi decays at least as fast as a constant times 1 x yi 2 and 0 1 x 2 y 2 dy 2 x which does tend to 0 when x to handle more general functions requires further analysis a topic that i address next 3 whacking jordan at first sight theorem 1 seems insufficient to evaluate the integral in 5 that the integral lives on only a part of the real axis is no dif ficulty by symmetry the value equals half the integral over the whole axis a serious issue however is that sin b x yi blows up as y tends to infinity when x 0 for instance this function becomes sin byi which equals the unbounded purely imaginary expression i sinh by as suggested in the introduction cauchy s device for overcoming this obstacle is to express the real function sin bx as the imaginary part of the complex exponential eibx and to view the integral as the imaginary part of 1 2 x x 2 1 eibx dx if z x yi then eibz e by an expression that tends to 0 uniformly with respect to x when y since the fraction z z 2 1 also tends to 0 uniformly when y the second hypothesis in theorem 1 holds to check the hypothesis about integrals on vertical lines observe that z z 2 1 z i i z i z i 1 z i 1 z i z i 1 x 1 x 2 therefore 0 x yi x yi 2 1 eib x yi dy 1 x 1 x 2 0 e by dy the right hand side tends to 0 when x the integral 0 e by dy being finite thus both hypotheses of theorem 1 are satisfied the residue of 1 2 z z 2 1 eibz at the singular point i equals e b 4 so theorem 1 validates formula 5 10 harold p boas r r cr figure 4 jordan s contour curiously a more difficult argument for establishing such integral formulas has been standard in textbooks since the 19 th century cours d analyse 19 of camille jordan 1838 1922 students are taught to evaluate lim r 1 2 r r x 1 x 2 eibx dx by closing the contour with a semicircle cr in the upper half plane see figure 4 this method is trickier than using cauchy s rectangle indeed i was unable to complete the proof as an undergraduate until a fellow student proposed integrating over a triangle instead of a semi circle our instructor was lars ahlfors 1907 1996 recipient of the fields medal at the first award ceremony in 1936 he indicated that he had not seen triangles used before in this context so we students published the idea 6 naively unaware that rectangles are the original polygonal contrivance from the dawn of the theory a student who attempts to prove that the integral over cr has limit equal to 0 when r typically falls short on the first try as follows since eib x yi e by 1 and z 1 z 2 r r 2 1 when z r as long as r 1 bounding the integral by the length of the integration path times the maximum of the absolute value of the integrand shows that 6 cr z 1 z 2 eibz dz r r r 2 1 the indicated upper bound tends to not 0 when r this inequality admits an essential improvement however for e by not only is bounded but actually decays when y grows since y is large only on part of the semicircle cr care is needed to exploit this extra informa tion the second try is to parametrize the semicircle by setting z equal to rei moving the absolute value signs inside the integral yields the cauchy s residue sore thumb 11 following upper bound for the left hand side of 6 7 r 2 r 2 1 0 e br sin d the factor in front of the integral tends to 1 when r so what needs to be shown is that the integral with respect to has limit equal to 0 when 0 the quantity b sin is positive so the integrand e br sin has limit 0 but this limit is not uniform with respect to a complication that could trip up even professional mathematicians as recently as the early 20 th century edmund taylor whittaker 1873 1956 waves his hands unconvincingly in the first edition of a course of modern analysis 28 p 86 claiming nonsensically that since the original integrand zeibz 1 z 2 is infinitesimal compared with 1 z at points on cr the integral round is infinitesimal compared with dz z or 2 and is therefore zero the integrand is certainly not small in comparison to 1 z on the real axis nonetheless the required convergence of the integral 7 to 0 when r does follow directly from any one of several propositions that are standard nowadays the bounded convergence theorem the dominated convergence theorem and the monotone convergence theorem the preceding analysis shows more generally that if f is a func tion for which zf z is bounded when z is sufficiently large then cr f z eibz dz tends to zero when r in particular f can be any rational function that vanishes at infinity this argument can be sharpened by leveraging the fast decay of the exponential to avoid using any quantitative information about the decay rate of the other factor jordan observes 19 289 for a general function f that cr f z eiz dz sup 0 f rei 0 e r sin rd adjusting the argument to hold for eibz in place of eiz is a simple matter of rescaling the variable since sin sin the integral equals twice the integral from 0 to 2 now sin 2 when 0 2 so an upper bound for the integral is 2 2 0 e 2 r rd or 1 e r accordingly if f rei 0 when r and if the convergence is uniform with respect to the angle then cr f z eiz dz has limit 0 too rarely needed in practice this refinement is dubbed jordan s lemma in textbooks the person responsible for naming the lemma seems to 12 harold p boas be george neville watson 1886 1965 in his textbook 27 30 al though historically accurate the nomenclature is unfortunate for an identically named algebraic proposition exists in the theory of invari ants see for instance 16 appendix iii the name of the analytic lemma is recorded in the second edition of a course of modern anal ysis 29 presumably due to watson s collaboration with his teacher on the revision the wide influence of this book still in print has en sured the permanence of the terminology jordan himself died at the age of 84 during the interval between the third edition and the fourth edition of this treatise familiarly known as whittaker and watson watson s own textbook evaluates cauchy s integral 2 by argu ments similar to those used in proving jordan s lemma 27 p 62 but the exposition requires some contortions since the lemma does not apply as formulated thus there is a need to upgrade jordan s lemma i offer a replacement in the spirit of cauchy s initial work on definite integrals although not explicitly covered by cauchy s writings of 1825 1826 the statement is in the penumbra the integrand in jordan s lemma is a product of two functions of different character accordingly i consider functions f 1 and f 2 that are holomorphic in a neighborhood of the closed upper half plane and have finitely many singularities all located in the open upper half plane theorem 2 after cauchy suppose that when y the function f 1 x yi tends to 0 uniformly with respect to x in an arbitrary bounded interval i and the integral i f 2 x yi dx stays bounded suppose that when x the function f 2 x yi tends to 0 uniformly with respect to y and the integral 0 f 1 x yi dy stays bounded then f 1 x f 2 x dx equals 2 i times the sum of the residues of f 1 f 2 in the upper half plane this statement is an immediate corollary of theorem 1 for the hy potheses imply that the product function f 1 f 2 satisfies the conditions of that theorem the traditional jordan lemma is the special case in which f 1 z is an exponential function of the form e ibz where b 0 and f 2 z vanishes when z there are many other interesting functions to which theorem 2 ap plies indeed let g w be an arbitrary power series n 1 cnw n that has radius of convergence greater than 1 and lacks a constant term i claim that the composite function g eibz will serve for f 1 z in theorem 2 when b 0 indeed g eib x yi e by n 1 cn when y 0 cauchy s residue sore thumb 13 now n 1 cn converges because n 1 cn g 1 and every power series converges absolutely inside the open disk of convergence ac cordingly the function g eib x yi tends to 0 uniformly with respect to x when y the preceding inequality additionally implies that 0 g eib x yi dy 1 b n 1 cn the finite upper bound being independent of x thus the function g eibz does satisfy both hypotheses required of f 1 z in theorem 2 in particular choosing eaw 1 for the function g w shows that f 1 z can be taken to be eae ibz 1 in theorem 2 letting f 2 z be z z 2 r 2 reveals that the value of the integral 4 is 2 i times the residue at ir of the function 1 2 z z 2 r 2 eae ibz 1 the residue being 1 4 eae br 1 consequently the integral 2 equals 2 eae br 1 and the integral 1 equals 2 e 1 e 1 cauchy s blunder in his first attempt is the failure to account for the term 1 needed to make g 0 equal to 0 4 driving the point home cauchy s marvelous tool for computing definite integrals has re mained useful into modern times notwithstanding the development of automated computation one example dear to my heart is the follow ing formula from my mother s ph d dissertation on theoretical physics 5 directed by herman feshbach 0 1 x 1 x 2 log x 3 x 3 dx 2 6 the integrand has a removable singularity when x 0 and an in tegrable singularity when x 3 the relatively fast decay of the integrand at infinity yields an easy verification of the main hypotheses of theorem 1 and the indicated result follows after a bit of care to de fine a suitable branch of the complex logarithm function and a finesse to handle innocuous singularities on the real axis yet both maple and mathematica beg the question by evaluating the integral in terms 14 harold p boas of the dilogarithm function which itself is defined as an integral and neither software program succeeds in simplifying 6 the answer to 2 6 to emphasize the continuing strength and value of cauchy s simple rectangle method i offer the following sampler of additional
