on the upper half plane in these problems we consider spectral data depending partially or fully on the spectrum derivative values at the spectrum clark measure or the spectrum of the negative of a meromorphic inner function 1 introduction inner functions on the upper half plane c are bounded analytic functions on c with unit modulus almost everywhere on the boundary r if an inner function extends to c meromorphically it is called a meromorphic inner function mif which is usually denoted by mifs appear in various fields such as spectral theory of differential operators 1 6 krein de branges theory of entire functions 3 8 19 functional model theory 10 11 approximation theory 14 toeplitz operators 4 7 16 and non linear fourier trans form 17 mifs also play an important role in the toeplitz approach to the uncertainty principle 6 15 which was used in the study of problems of fourier and harmonic analysis 9 12 13 each mif is represented by the blaschke singular factorization z ceiaz n n cn z n z n where c is a unimodular constant a is a nonzero real constant n n n is a discrete sequence i e has no finite accumulation point in c satisfying the blaschke condition n n n 1 n 2 and cn i n i n mifs are also represented as x ei x on the real line where is an increasing real analytic function a complex valued function is said to be real if it maps real numbers to real numbers on its domain a meromorphic herglotz functionm is a real meromorphic function with positive imaginary part on c it has negative imaginary part on c via the relation m z m z there is a one to one correspondence between mifs and meromorphic herglotz functions via equations m i m i m i 1 1 2020 mathematics subject classification 30 key words and phrases meromorphic inner functions uniqueness theorems 1 http arxiv org abs 2110 12384 v 1 2 burak hati nog lu therefore mifs can be described by parameters b c via the herglotz representation m z bz c is z where b is a non negative constant c is a real constant and s z 1 i 1 t z t 1 t 2 d t is the schwarz integral of the positive discrete poisson finite measure on r i e d t 1 t 2 the number b is considered as the point mass of at infinity this extended measure is called the clark or spectral measure of the spectrum of the mif denoted by is the level set 1 so is supported on or the point masses at t are given by t 2 t and the point mass at infinity is non zero if and only if limy iy 1 and the limit limy y 2 iy exists all of these above mentioned properties of mifs can be found e g in 15 and references therein existence uniqueness interpolation and other complex function theoretic problems for mifs were recently studied in various papers 2 15 18 19 in this paper we con sider unique determination of the mif from several spectral data and conditions depending fully or partially on and t t the two spectra and are the sets of poles and zeros of m respectively they are interlacing discrete sequences on r so we denote them by an n z 1 bn n z 1 indexed in the increasing order we also introduce the disjoint intervals in an bn for n z if is bounded below an bn and in are indexed by n in theorem 2 3 we consider unique determination of from an n z and an n z or equivalently an n z with the condition that in 1 dist 0 in n z l 1 z in theorem 2 4 this condition is replaced by the condition 1 x 1 l 1 and that has no point mass at infinity so the clark measure uniquely determines in this case theorem 2 5 shows that if is bounded below or above then is uniquely determined by an n n and an n n without any other condition in theorems 2 6 and 2 7 we proved that the knowledge of an from theorems 2 3 and 2 5 can be partially replaced by the knowledge of the corresponding points bn from the second spectrum 2 results and proofs let us firstly fix our notations we denote mifs by or and the corresponding meromorphic herglotz functions by m since the spectrum of a mif is a discrete sequence in r we denote it by an n z similarly the second spectrum is denoted by bn n z since e i on r for an increasing real analytic function and an n z and bn n z are interlacing sequences we get x r x 0 uniqueness theorems for meromorphic inner functions 3 an bn n z we denote the disjoint intervals an bn by in a sequence of disjoint intervals jn on r is called short if 2 1 n jn 2 1 dist 2 0 jn and long otherwise here jn and dist 0 jn denote the length of the interval jn and its distance to the origin respectively collections of short and long intervals appear in various areas of harmonic analysis see 15 and references therein if we assume 0 in then condition 2 1 is nothing but jn dist 0 jn l 2 in some of our results we use the condition that this sequence for in belongs to l 1 i e n in 1 dist 0 in before our uniqueness theorems we need an infinite product representation result lemma 2 1 the meromorphic herglotz function m corresponding to the mif has the representations 2 2 m z i 1 z 1 z c n z z bn 1 z an 1 1 and 2 3 m z i 1 z 1 z c n z z bn 1 1 z an 1 1 where c 0 and the product converges normally on c n n an proof the interlacing property of an and bn implies convergence of the infinite products in 2 2 and 2 3 then lemma 4 1 in 5 proves these representations for the m function of the schro dinger operator on 0 1 with dirichlet dirichlet boundary conditions the m function is a meromorphic herglotz function its sets of poles and zeros are bounded below and satisfy some asymptotic properties however the argu ments used in the proof of that lemma can be generalized to any meromorphic herglotz function remark 2 2 if is bounded below or above representations 2 2 and 2 3 become 2 4 m z c n n z bn 1 z an 1 1 and 2 5 m z c z b 1 1 n n z bn 1 1 z an 1 1 respectively 4 burak hati nog lu theorem 2 3 let be a mif if n z in 1 dist 0 in then an n z and an n z uniquely determine proof let us note that n z bn an 1 an n z in 1 dist 0 in and n z bn an 1 bn n z in 1 dist 0 in therefore 0 n z an bn and hence l lim y m iy lim y c n z z bn 1 z an 1 1 c n z an bn which implies limy iy l i l i 6 1 therefore 0 i e m z b is b k z ak 1 ak z ak 1 a 2 k now let s observe that l b k z ak ak 1 a 2 k indeed we just observed that the limit of m iy is finite as y goes to therefore m is bounded on i for a fixed 0 and l lim y m iy b 1 k z lim y ak 1 ak iy ak 1 a 2 k b 1 k z ak ak 1 a 2 k which implies 2 6 m z l 1 k z ak ak z so the only unknown on the right hand side is l in order to show uniqueness of l let us consider another mif satisfying the following properties 1 an n z an an for any n z n z i n 1 dist 0 i n and hence 0 uniqueness theorems for meromorphic inner functions 5 where i n an b n and b n n z in other words mifs and share the same clark measure i e and i n n satisfy the summability condition so m z i 1 z 1 z c n z z b n 1 z an 1 1 l 1 n z an an z if we consider the difference of m and m evaluated at one of the zeros of m we get l l m bk m bk m bk l n z b k bn b k an for some k z using interlacing properties one can observe that bk bn bk an is positive for any n 6 k we also know that b k ak so l l and b k bk have the same sign for any k n and hence the sequences bn and b n are interlacing let us assume l l and hence b n bn for n z note that an bn is bounded above and below since n z an b n is convergent then the infinite product n z b n bn is absolutely convergent i e n z bn bn bn is convergent indeed for some c 0 c n z bn bn bn n z bn bn an bnbn n z bn an bn n z bn an bnbn so the meromorphic function m z m z is represented as f z m z m z c c n z z bn bn b n z b n l l n z z bn z b n interlacing property of bn nv and b n n z and positivity of l l imply that f is a meromorphic herglotz function so it is represented as f z i 1 z 1 z l l n z z bn z b n where is a mif with the following properties 1 b n n z 1 bn n z i f 1 an n z note that the last property follows from the fact that m and m share same set of simple poles an n z with equivalent residues at the corresponding poles using the fact that n z b n bn is absolutely convergent and following the arguments we used on the representation 2 6 of the function m we get f z i 1 z 1 z l l 1 n z bn z b n where is the clark measure corresponding to therefore 1 f ak f bk l l 1 n z bn ak b n l l 1 n z bn bk b n 6 burak hati nog lu for any k since both of the infinite sums on the right end are convergent we get 1 1 n z bn bk ak ak b n bk b n let us observe that each term of this infinite sum is negative so letting k go to gives a contradiction indeed 1 1 k z lim k bn bk ak ak b n bk b n 0 when l l we can get another contradiction using similar arguments therefore l l i e m m and through the one to one correspondence between meromorphic herglotz functions and mifs so we get the desired result if we assume that the clark measure has no point mass at infinity then we can formulate a uniqueness result in terms of theorem 2 4 let be a mif and be its clark measure if d x 1 x and has no point mass at then uniquely determines proof recall that knowing means knowing an n and an n we also know that 0 so the meromorphic herglotz function corresponding to has the representation 2 7 m z b is b 1 n z an 1 an z an 1 a 2 n the condition d x 1 x means n z an 1 an this implies that n z an an 1 a 2 n is convergent and n z an an z is uniformly bounded by n z an 1 an on the set i 1 these observations together with the representation 2 7 and lemma 2 1 imply l c n z an bn lim y m iy b 1 n z an an 1 a 2 n uniqueness theorems for meromorphic inner functions 7 i e n z an bn is convergent therefore m z l 1 n z an an z so we get the representation 2 6 again in order to show uniqueness of l we can follow the arguments starting after 2 6 we used in the proof of theorem 2 3 even if n z an bn is convergent but not necessarily absolutely convergent uniqueness of l gives uniqueness of m and hence uniqueness of through the one to one corre spondence between meromorphic herglotz functions and mifs so we get the desired result if is bounded below then no extra condition is required for the uniqueness result of theorem 2 3 theorem 2 5 let be a mif if an n n is bounded below then an n n and an n n or an n n uniquely determine proof let d max a 1 b 1 since the meromorphic herglotz function m cor responding to satisfies one of the infinite product representations 2 4 or 2 5 by substituting z d for z we can keep the derivative values of same and make an d n n and bn d n n subsets of r therefore without loss of generality we assume an n n bn n n r we know that 2 8 m z az b is az b 1 n n an 1 an z an 1 a 2 n where a 0 b r and an 0 for any n n first let s show that a 0 if without loss of generality we assume m satisfies the infinite product representation 2 2 then its partial products are represented as m n z c n n 1 an an z bn z bn n n 1 n n an z c n n 1 an bn where c n n 0 for any n 1 n n n let us also note that n n converges to an for any fixed n and an a 2 n n n l 1 n then for k n let us consider the difference m n z k n 1 n n 1 an z an 1 a 2 n n n k 1 n n an z c n n 1 an bn k n 1 n n an 1 a 2 n note that for any z 0 k n and n n the right hand side is positive since n n c an bn are positive numbers so the left hand side is positive for any z 0 k n and n n first letting n tend to infinity we get m z 1 k n 1 an 1 an z an 1 a 2 n and then letting k tend to infinity we get m z 1 n n an 1 an z an 1 a 2 n 8 burak hati nog lu we observed that this difference should be non negative for z 0 however by 2 8 it is nothing but az b with a 0 which is possible only if a 0 i e 2 9 m z b 1 n n an 1 an z an 1 a 2 n in order to show uniqueness of b let us consider another mif satisfying the following properties 1 an n n an an for any n n where b n n therefore m z i 1 z 1 z c n n z b n 1 z an 1 1 b 1 n n an 1 an z an 1 a 2 n if we consider the difference of m and m evaluated at one of the zeros of m we get b b m bk m bk m bk c n n an bn b k bn b k an for some k n using interlacing properties one can observe that bk bn bk an is positive for any n 6 k we also know that b k ak so b b and b k bk have the same sign for any k n and hence the sequences bn n n and b n n n are interlacing let us assume b b and hence b n bn for n n so the meromorphic function f z m z m z is represented as f z m z m z c c n n z bn bn b n z b n interlacing property of bn n n and b n n n and positivity of c c imply that f is a meromorphic herglotz function so it is represented as f z i 1 z 1 z c c n n b n z b n where is a mif with the following properties 1 b n n n 1 bn n n i f 1 an n n note that the last property follows from the fact that m and m share same set of simple poles an n n with equivalent residues at the corresponding poles using the fact that b n n n r and following the arguments we used on the representation 2 9 of the function m we get f z i 1 z 1 z b 1 n n bn 1 b n z b n 1 b 2 n uniqueness theorems for meromorphic inner functions 9 where b r and is the clark measure corresponding to therefore 1 f ak f bk 1 n n bn 1 b n ak b n 1 b 2 n 1 n n bn 1 b n bk b n 1 b 2 n for any k since both of the infinite sums on the right end are convergent we get 1 1 n n bn bk ak ak b n bk b n let us observe that each term of this infinite sum is negative so letting k go to gives a contradiction indeed 1 1 k n lim k bn bk ak ak b n bk b n 0 when b b we get another contradiction using similar arguments therefore b b i e m m and through the one to one correspondence between meromorphic herglotz functions and mifs so we get the desired result next two theorems show that missing part of an from the spectral data can be compensated by the corresponding data from bn in theorems 2 3 and 2 5 theorem 2 6 let be a mif and a z if 2 10 n z in 1 dist 0 in then the spectral data consisting of an n z bn n z a and an n a or an n a uniquely determine proof from lemma 2 1 without loss of generality we can assume that m has the representation m z c n n z bn 1 z an 1 1 note that for any k a we know 2 11 ak res m ak c bk ak ak bk n n n 6 k ak bn 1 ak an 1 1 let m z f z g z where f and g are two infinite products defined as f z c n a z bn 1 z an 1 1 g z n n a z bn 1 z an 1 1 10 burak hati nog lu let us observe that at any point of an n a the infinite product 2 12 g z n n a z bn 1 z an 1 1 is also known then conditions 2 11 and 2 12 imply that for any k a we know res f ak res m ak g ak since real zeros and poles of f are simple and interlacing f is a meromorphic herglotz function if is the mif corresponding to f then 1 an n a 1 bn n a and our spectral data become an n a and an n a the convergence condition 2 10 implies 0 n n an bn and hence 0 n a an bn therefore applying the proof of theorem 2 3 we determine and hence c and bn n a uniquely this means unique recovery of m and then unique recovery of through the one to one correspondence between meromorphic herglotz functions and mifs theorem 2 7 let be a mif and a n if an n n is bounded below then the spectral data consisting of an n n bn n n a and an n a or an n a uniquely determine proof following arguments from the proof of theorem 2 6 we convert our problem to the problem of unique determination of the mif from the spectral data an n a and an n a where 1 an n a 1 bn n a since an n a is bounded below by theorem 2 5 these spectral data uniquely determine and hence c and bn n a this means unique recovery of m and then unique recovery of through the one to one correspondence between meromorphic herglotz functions and mifs references 1 a baranov y belov and a poltoratski de
