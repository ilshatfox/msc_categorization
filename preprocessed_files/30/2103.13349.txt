system of differential equations equivalently we prove an analog of carleson s theorem on almost everywhere convergence of fourier series for a version of the non linear fourier transform our proofs are based on the study of resonances of dirac systems using families of meromorphic inner functions generated by a ricatti equation corresponding to the system introduction in this paper we study pointwise convergence of the scattering data for a dirac system of differential equations scattering transforms play an impor tant role in the study of various differential operators and related problems extensive evidence generated in this area during the last several decades sug gests that scattering can be viewed as a non linear version of the classical fourier transform see for instance 1 30 28 29 these connections lead to natural problems of establishing versions of the classical results of fourier analysis in the non linear settings of scattering such problems have been appearing in various forms for most of the last century and remain an object of active research today see for instance 27 for further references as an example one can look at the non linear version of parseval s identity 5 3 which can be traced as far back as the work of verblunski in the 1930 s and a non linear analog of hausdorff young inequality which appears in more recent work of christ and kiselev 4 3 one of the fundamental results of classical fourier analysis is the theorem by l carleson 1966 2 which says that the fourier transform f t x t t f s e ixsds converges to f x f x as t at almost every point x r for any f l 2 r answering a question by luzin from 1915 carleson s theorem the author was partially supported by nsf grant dms 1954085 1 http arxiv org abs 2103 13349 v 7 2 a poltoratski finished a long and turbulent story of partial results and counterexamples created by some of the most prominent mathematicians of the 20 th century after more than fifty years the existing proofs are still challenging despite several significant contributions by other analysts including those by fef ferman 1973 11 and by lacey and thiele 2000 13 the theorem and its proofs opened a variety of directions for further research see for instance 8 21 for some of the recent developments and references our main goal is to prove an analog of this classical result in the scattering setting i e to establish pointwise convergence for a version of the non linear fourier transform see theorem 1 in section 5 our result implies in particular that generalized eigenfunctions of dirac systems on the half line with real l 2 potentials are bounded for almost every real spectral parameter answering a question by muscalu tao and thiele 20 for 1 p 2 this follows from the work of christ and kiselev 4 5 convergence in the d adic model along with a statement on the maximal operator was established in 19 further discussion of these problems in the context of ablowitz kaup newell segur akns systems can be found in the book by muscalu and schlag 18 vol 2 chapter 5 our proof is independent from the linear proofs and is based on a study of resonances of dirac systems using the methods of spectral problems for dif ferential operators and complex function theory while our tools include the basics of the krein de banges theory and its later developments in 15 16 we are not using any of the deep results of the theory or any of the re cent advances of the non linear fourier analysis the necessary background material is presented in sections 1 2 and 3 convergence results are usually closely related to estimates of the maximal operator as was the case with the original version of carleson s theorem while some of such estimates for the non linear transform can be extracted from the results of this paper sharpness and full extent of such estimates remains unclear and will be studied elsewhere let us only mention that pointwise convergence trivially implies finiteness of the maximal function at almost every point which was unknown up to now the plan of our proof is as follows first we prove universality type results and show that near almost every point of a szego weight the reproducing kernels of the de branges spaces corresponding to the dirac system resemble standard sinc functions approximations for the reproducing kernels do not imply approximations for the hermite biehler functions generating the space per se but under an additional assumption of existence of a resonance of the system near a point s r those functions can be approximated by sines and cosines next we show that to keep a resonance near s in the case when pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 3 the hermite biehler function is a sine or a cosine or a function close enough to those requires a large l 2 norm of the potential function interestingly this step requires us to consider two substantially different cases when the resonance of the system restricted to the interval 0 t moves near s vertically or diagonally as t increases the motion of resonances is studied using families of inner functions satisfying a ricatti equation related to the original dirac system obtaining a contradiction with the finiteness of the l 2 norm of the potential function we show that for a e point s r the system restricted to 0 t cannot have a resonance within the distance of 1 t from s for large enough t from that we deduce that the absolute values of and the angle between the scattering functions corresponding to neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions converge a e on r our main result then follows the contents of the sections in section 1 we introduce the main object of the paper a dirac system on r with real potential section 2 contains basics of krein de branges theory for dirac sys tems section 3 contains a definition and a brief discussion of meromorphic inner functions mifs in section 4 we define families of dirac inner functions satisfying a ricatti equation these families will play a role in the study of resonance dynamics later in the paper the definition of the scattering matrix and the non linear fourier transform together with their relations with the hermite biehler functions are presented in section 5 in section 6 we prove universality results characterizing the behavior of reproducing kernels of the de branges spaces corresponding to the dirac system near regular points of the spectral measure on the real line universality results are translated into approximations of the hermite biehler functions by elementary sines and cosines in section 7 simultaneous approximations for hermite biehler functions corre sponding to neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions are ob tained in section 8 in section 9 we classify the time intervals according to the motion of the resonances near a fixed point on r in section 10 we estimate the l 2 norm of the potential function of the dirac system on the time intervals during which the resonances move almost vertically estimates for the intervals corresponding to the motion with large horizontal component are obtained in section 11 in section 12 we finish the proof of the main result theorem 1 4 a poltoratski acknowledgments the approach used in this paper stems from our joint work with nikolai makarov to whom i am grateful for introducing me to spectral and scattering problems i would also like to thank sergey denisov and fedor nazarov for useful discussions related to this work initial progress was made during my sabbatical stay at the university of helsinki in april june of 2019 i am grateful to the math department and especially to my host eero saksman for the inspiring working environment and hospitality 1 real dirac systems we study one of the basic models of scattering corresponding to the real dirac system on the right half line r x zx qx 1 1 where z c is a spectral parameter 0 1 1 0 and q t 0 f t f t 0 for some real valued locally summable function f a slightly more general form of the system allows for a locally summable functions g and g on the main diagonal of q the function f ig is then called the potential of the system to simplify our exposition we keep the potential real although our methods will work similarly for the general potential we will be most interested in the scattering problems corresponding to the case f l 2 r for each value of the spectral parameter z the unknown function x t z u t z v t z is assumed to be differentiable on r with respect to the time variable t and satisfy a self adjoint boundary condition at t 0 a special role will be played by solutions satisfying the neumann x 0 z 1 0 and dirichlet x 0 z 0 1 initial conditions the matrix function m whose columns are the neumann and dirichlet solutions i e the matrix function which solves 1 1 with the initial condition m 0 z 1 0 0 1 is called the fundamental matrix or the transfer matrix of the system pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 5 any dirac system can be rewritten in the so called canonical form and henceforth become a part of the krein de branges theory of canonical sys tems see 6 10 25 26 what follows is a brief outline of the basics of the theory as applicable to the subclass of dirac systems 2 hermite biehler functions and spectral measures if x t z u t z v t z is a solution of 1 1 with a self adjoint boundary condition at 0 then for each fixed t r the function h t z u t z iv t z is an hermite biehler entire function i e an entire function satisfying h t z h t z for all z from the upper half plane c throughout this paper we will denote by e t z and e t z the functions corresponding to the neumann and dirichlet conditions at 0 correspondingly according to krein s formula for the exponential type see for instance 25 theorem 11 the functions e t e t have exponential type t if m t z a t z b t z c t z d t z is the fundamental matrix then e t z a t z ic t z and e t z b t z id t z here a b c d are real real valued on the real line entire functions anal ogous to sine and cosine this analogy becomes an equation in the free case f 0 when e t z eitz e t z ieitz a t z d t z cos tz and c t z d t z sin tz we will use the standard notation h z for the schwarz reflection of an entire function h z h z using this notation a e e 2 and b e e 2 i it follows from 1 1 that detm t z 1 2 1 6 a poltoratski for all t and z rewritten in terms of e and e this relation becomes det e e e e 2 i 2 2 associated with every hermite biehler function e z one can consider a de branges space b e a hilbert space of entire functions defined as b e f f is entire f e h 2 c f e h 2 c where h 2 c denotes the standard hardy space in the upper half plane the hilbert structure in b e is inherited from h 2 f g b e r f x g x dx e x 2 each b e consists of functions of exponential type at most that of e in particular in our settings b e t contains functions of exponential type at most t with this structure b e is a reproducing kernel space point evaluations are bounded linear functionals on the space and as follows from the repre sentation theorem for each c there exists k b h such that for any f b e f f k b e the function k z is called the reproducing kernel for the point in the case of the de branges space b e k z has the formula k z 1 2 i e z e e z e z 1 a z c c z a z where a e e 2 and c e e 2 i are real entire functions such that e a ic in the free case f 0 the hermit biehler functions produced by the system 1 1 are the exponential functions e t z e itz e t z ie itz and b e t z is the standard paley wiener space pwt the reproducing kernel of pwt is the sinc function sinc t z 1 sin t z z 2 3 it follows from the definition of k z that k b e k e h 2 k sup f b e f b e 1 f 2 4 pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 7 we denote by the poisson measure on r d x dx 1 x 2 we call a measure on r poisson finite if d x 1 x 2 the family of de branges spaces b e t z t r possesses a unique pos itive poisson finite measure on r such that the embedding b e t z l 2 is isometric for all t r similarly the family b e t z gives rise to a unique measure the measures and are called the spectral mea sures for the dirac system 1 1 corresponding to the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions at 0 correspondingly let w x be the density of the absolutely continuous part of d ac w x dx and let w be the density for the absolutely continuous part of for f l 2 r the spectral measures satisfy the szego condition log w log w l 1 see the paper by denisov 9 for this and many related results in particular w w 6 0 a e on r it is well known that in the case of locally summable potentials and thus in our case when f l 2 r the spaces b e t z and b e t z are equal to the standard paley wiener spaces pwt as sets but with different norms indeed 2 5 below implies e t x e t x e t 0 f s ds for x r and the condition detm 1 implies that e and e are bounded from below on r therefore the norms in b e and b e are equivalent to the norm in l 2 r together with the property that b e t z and b e t z consist of functions of exponential type at most t we obtain that they are equal to pwt as a sets hence for the reproducing kernels k t z of b e t z 2 4 can be rewritten as k t b e t z sup f pwt f l 2 1 f and similarly for the reproducing kernels k t z of b e t z the equation 1 1 rewritten for the hermite biehler function e e t z u t z iv t z becomes t e t z zv t z fu t z i zu t z fv t z 8 a poltoratski which yields t e t z ize t z f t e t z 2 5 the initial condition is e 0 z 1 for e and e 0 z i for e some simple corollaries of the last equation will be useful to us below we denote by arge the continuous branch of the argument of e in the closed upper half plane satisfying arge t 0 0 arg e t 0 2 for e if e satisfies 2 5 then for e t x x r we have t e t x f t e t x cos 2 arge t x which results in e t x e t 0 x exp t t 0 f t cos 2 arge t x dt 2 6 for all t t 0 0 3 meromorphic inner functions recall that an inner function in the upper half plane is a bounded analytic function whose non tangential boundary values are unimodular a e on r see for instance 12 an inner function in c is called a meromorphic inner function mif if it can be continued meromorphically into the whole complex plane it can be shown that every mif has a representation eiaz n n z n z n where is a unimodular complex constant a is a positive number n is a sequence of points in c tending to infinity as n and satisfying the blaschke condition n 1 n 2 the subclass all inner functions consisting of mifs appears in spectral prob lems for differential operators with compact resolvents see 15 16 such functions also appear in problems of fourier analysis see 22 23 24 since every mif is analytic in a neighborhood of the real line their bound ary values and derivatives are well defined everywhere on r we will need the following simple lemma relating their derivatives and zeros pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 9 for a sequence n c satisfying the blaschke condition we denote by b the corresponding blaschke product b n n z n z n lemma 1 let be a mif and let 1 0 let x y r be such that x y 1 3 1 then the ball z x y x contains at least one zero of proof as a mif can be represented as z eiczb for some c 0 and a blaschke sequence n c for a blaschke factor n n n z n z n n xn iyn the derivative of its argument is yn x xn 2 y 2 n for x which equals to the derivative of the argument of at x we have x c n yn x xn 2 y 2 n the sum on the right hand side is a sum of positive functions and for 3 1 to hold we need a similar inequality to be satisfied by at least one of the summands i e yn x xn 2 y 2 n y xn 2 y 2 n yn y n 2 x n 2 1 for at least one n the last inequality holds when n is in the interior of an apollonian circle with foci x and y which is contained in the ball form the statement 4 dirac inner functions in this section we introduce families of inner functions related to the systems 1 1 we call them dirac inner functions in addition to playing a role in our arguments below such families seem to present independent interest and may prove useful in the studies of further properties of the system standard formulas expressing blaschke products in terms of their zeros establish in this context the relation between resonances poles of the inner function and spectra level sets on r of the system 10 a poltoratski if h z is an hermite biehler entire function then the function h z h z h z is a meromorphic inner function in c under the restriction that h has bounded type which is the case for functions related to dirac systems with locally summable potentials h can be uniquely up to a real constant mul tiple recovered from h recall that to each dirac system we associate two families of hermite biehler functions e t z and e t z corresponding to neumann and dirich let boundary conditions at t 0 we will denote the corresponding mifs by e and e similarly families of mifs can be considered for any self adjoint boundary condition for t z we have t z u t z iv t z u t z iv t z and t t z t u i t v u iv u iv t u i t v u iv 2 2 i u d dt v v t u u iv 2 2 i zu 2 zv 2 2 fuv u iv 2 2 iz u iv u iv 4 if uv u iv 2 2 iz u iv u iv f u iv u iv u iv u iv u iv 2 which produces a ricatti equation for the family of dirac inner functions corresponding to the system 1 1 t 2 iz f 1 2 4 1 this equation together with its derivatives will be used in our study of the behavior of resonances of the system 1 1 remark 1 the ricatti equation 4 1 and corresponding families of func tions pose some interesting questions in our settings 4 1 is considered with neumann boundary condition 0 z 1 for and dirichlet 0 z 1 for one can however consider other initial conditions conditions of the type 0 z z where is a bounded analytic function in c 1 present a natural subclass one can show that with such initial conditions the solutions t z will remain analytic in z and satisfy t z 1 for z c interpreting the complex values as vectors in r 2 one can see that at the real points where t x 1 the right hand side of 4 1 is orthogo nal to t z which implies that stays unimodular hence with an inner pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 11 initial condition t z is a family of inner functions one can also show that t z are mifs if the initial condition is a mif if t z is a neumann family of dirac inner functions each level set z t z 1 represents the spectrum of the system 1 1 re stricted to the interval 0 t with the neumann boundary condition at 0 and the condition u t sin v t cos 0 at t where e 2 i analyzing 4 1 one may follow the dynamics of the spectra of the system 1 1 as t see remark 2 below let t be a continuous curve in c such that t t a for some constant a c then d dt t t 0 t t t z t t t which implies t 2 i t a f t 1 a 2 z t t 4 2 for those t for which the denominator is not 0 we will be especially inter ested in the behavior of the zeros of whose complex conjugates represent the resonances of the dirac system 1 1 let z t be a curve in c such that t z t 0 for all t 0 then 4 2 becomes z t f t z t z t 4 3 in our proof we will use this formula in the case when e is locally ap proximated by a sine see lemma 6 below and therefore the zeros of are simple in this case the derivative in the denominator is non zero and the application of 4 3 is straight forward remark 2 when a 1 the point t belongs to nn t the spectrum of the restriction of the dirac system to the interval 0 t with neumann conditions on both ends the dynamics of an eigenvalue n t from nn is therefore given by n t 2 in t z t n t similarly for the eigenvalues of the neumann dirichlet spectrum d t we have a t 1 and 4 2 produces the equation d t 2 id t z t d t note that the derivative of any mif on r is non vanishing 12 a poltoratski since for each fixed t is unimodular on r and its argument is an increas ing function the z derivative of is always co linear with i since t n t 1 and t d t 1 the previous two equations imply that n t and d t are negative for the positive eigenvalues and positive for the negative ones this simple obser vation implies the known fact that the points of nn and nd tend to zero monotonously as t when a in 4 2 is unimodular but not equal to 1 the point t is an eigenvalue for the neumann condition at 0 and some other self adjoint con dition at t different from neumann or dirichlet notice that in this case the function f does not disappear from the numerator in 4 2 and the mov ing eigenvalue changes direction when it reaches the point f t 1 a 2 2 ia note that this number is real for real f and unimodular a this interesting dynamics of dirac eigenvalues viewed as level sets of dirac inner functions deserves a separate discussion which we hope to undertake elsewhere let again z t be a continuous curve such that t z t 0 our next goal is to study the change of derivative z at the zero z t using 4 1 and 4 2 we obtain d dt z t z t zt t z t zz t z t z t 2 iz z t z t f t zz t z t z t z t 4 4 these formulas will prove useful to us in section 7 5 scattering functions and nlft closely related to the hermite biehler functions e t z and e t z corre sponding to the dirac system 1 1 are the scattering functions e t z eitze t z and e t z eitze t z without going into a discussion of the physical meaning of the scattering model let us recall that e itz is the hermite biehler function of the free system and note that the functions e t z and e t z represent the propa gation of a wave signal up to time t in the system described by 1 1 and return of the same wave in the free system note that scattering functions e and e satisfy the equation t e t z ize t z eizt t e t z f t e 2 izte t z 5 1 pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 13 further for each t 0 define entire functions a t z and b t z as a t z e t z ie t z 2 eitz 2 e t z ie t z b t z e t z ie t z 2 eitz 2 e t z ie t z 5 2 note that our notations are slightly different from those in 29 where a stands for a in our definitions using 5 1 or 2 5 for e and e one can show that the matrix g t z a t z b t z b t z a t z satisfies the differential equation gt 0 e 2 iztf t e 2 iztf t 0 g with the initial condition g 0 z i one can deduce from the ivp that detg 1 for all t and z which also follows from 5 2 and 2 1 since detg a 2 b 2 1 on r a b on r since both e t z and e t z are functions of smirnov class in c for each fixed t so are a and b moreover it is well known and not difficult to show that a is outer in c since detg a 2 b 2 1 on r a b 1 on r hence a b is a bounded analytic function in c a b 1 as was noticed in 29 since a 2 b 2 1 a t 0 0 and a is outer in c a b and g can all be uniquely recovered from a b it is well known that under the restriction f l 2 r the scattering matrix f g z lim t g t z exists at least in some sense in the discrete case discussed in 29 the convergence is proved with respect to a metric on the unit circle which replaces the line in the discrete situation see lecture 2 using the same methods one can show convergence in measure for log a t with respect to lebesgue measure on r normal convergence in the upper half plane is established in 9 in the equivalent settings of krein systems in chapter 12 for the scattering functions e and e corresponding to dirac systems it follows from the relations established in chapter 14 9 normal convergence in c for a and b then follows from 5 2 note that since log a t is a non negative function on r convergence of its poisson integral at z i is equivalent to the convergence of the norms log a t l 1 together with convergence in measure this implies con vergence of log a t in l 1 since b 2 a 2 1 b converges in measure with respect to for log b max log b 0 using again the 14 a poltoratski relation b 2 a 2 1 we obtain convergence in l 1 note that for a family of functions from smirnov class pointwise convergence in c to a non zero function from smirnov class under a restriction that the outer part is positive at a fixed point implies pointwise convergence in c for their outer and inner parts convergence of the outer parts of b at i together with convergence of log b in l 1 implies convergence of the l 1 norms of log b log b log b together with convergence of b in measure we get convergence of of log b in l 1 for the inner components of b one can show that pointwise convergence in c implies convergence in measure on r with respect to all in all we obtain that a and b and therefore e and e converge in measure on r with respect to all of the functions a t z including the limit function a a z for t satisfy the non linear version of parseval s identity log a t l 1 r f 2 l 2 0 t 5 3 which was known in various forms for many decades see 9 19 29 for proofs and further references in this paper we pay special attention to the function b t z a t z and its limit at infinity let us denote f f z b z a z if ft is the restriction of the potential function f to the interval 0 t extended by 0 outside of the interval then f f t z b t z a t z there is abundant evidence that various versions of the scattering trans form including f and f f can be viewed as non linear analogs of the fourier transform see for instance 19 27 28 29 for a discussion and fur ther references the transform f 7 f f we are about to study shares the modulation shift property and the rescaling property with its linear prede cessor parseval s identity in terms of f f takes the form 1 2 log 1 f f 2 l 1 r f 2 l 2 r the analogy extends further by the property that the transform of a func tion f supported on a half line produces a function f f holomorphic in the upper half plane as was mentioned before the pair of functions a b and therefore the matrix g can be uniquely recovered from f f since a is an outer pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 15 function in c which has absolute value a 1 1 f f 2 on r and is positive at 0 and b a f f in this paper we prove the following analog of carleson s theorem theorem 1 for every real f l 2 r f f t s f f s as t for a e s r where ft denotes the restriction of f to the interval 0 t we actually prove a slightly stronger statement that for a e s r and any c 0 sup z s c t f f t z f f s 0 as t see section 12 such convergence is established for e e and log a 6 universality type results in this section we show that if the spectral measure of a chain of de branges spaces satisfies the szego condition then near almost every point on the real line the scaling limits of the reproducing kernels are equal to the sinc func tions the reproducing kernels of the paley wiener space similar problems motivated by universality results in random matrix theory were previously studied by lubinski 14 for spaces of polynomials and by mitkovski 17 for de branges spaces in particular an analog of lemma 4 below was proved in 17 for points s of continuity of density of a regular spectral measure we keep our notations of and for the spectral measures of the dirac system 1 1 with neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions correspond ingly w and w denote the densities of the absolutely continuous parts of the measures d wdx d s d w dx d s by k t z we denote the reproducing kernel of the space b e t z for the point all our statements can be similarly proved for the reproducing kernels k t z of b e t z we use the notations and 2 for the norms in l 2 and in l 2 r for an absolutely continuous measure d w x dx we use w in place of 16 a poltoratski for a poisson finite measure on r we denote by p its poisson extension to the upper half plane p x iy 1 yd t x t 2 y 2 for x r let x be the non tangential sector x z c z x z for any function z in c we denote by m its non tangential maximal function on r m x sup z x z thus mp will stand for the maximal function of the poisson extension of for s r and c 0 we will denote by q s c the square box centered at s q s c z s c z c the proximity of reproducing kernels k t z to sinc functions sinc t z defined in 2 3 will be studied on boxes q s c t whose size decreases with time we start with the following statement lemma 2 for almost all s r and any c 0 sup z q s c t w s k t z 2 sinc t z 22 1 o 1 6 1 as t proof recall that k t z sup f pwt f 1 f z and sinc t z 2 sup f pwt f 2 1 f z the relation we need to establish therefore becomes w s sup f pwt f 1 f z 1 o 1 sup f pwt f 2 1 f z 6 2 let us first prove that the left hand side of 6 2 is no greater than the right hand side for some choice of o 1 pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 17 let g be an outer function in c with g 2 w suppose that the non tangential limit g s exists at s and g s w s multiplying g by a unimodular constant we can choose g so that g s w s due to the weak 1 1 type of the non tangential maximal operator the function r mp logw is locally summable and we assume that s is its lebesgue point in this part we will assume that g s w s 1 otherwise since w s 6 0 for a e s we can divide w by w s notice that since f f w sup f pwt f 1 f z sup f pwt f w 1 f z and it is enough to show that the last supremum is less or equal to the right hand side of 6 2 put gt g s z s t for each t 0 choose a point zt q s c then s zt s t q s c t using that f w fg 2 and rescaling we obtain sup f pwt f w 1 f s z s t t sup f pw 1 fgt 2 1 f zt the inequality we need to establish for every choice of zt q s c becomes sup f pw 1 fgt 2 1 f zt 1 o 1 dt 6 3 where dt sup f pw 1 f 2 1 f zt suppose that fn is a sequence of functions from pw 1 such that fngkn 2 1 for some kn but fn zkn dkn notice that all the points zkn belong to q s c and therefore by choosing a subsequence if necessary we can assume that zkn z 0 q s c let d sup f pw 1 f 2 1 f z 0 then dkn d 18 a poltoratski leg gn e izfngkn then all gn are h 2 c functions of norm at most 1 by choosing a subsequence if necessary we can assume that gn converge to some g h 2 weakly in h 2 and therefore pointwise in c then g 2 1 notice that since g z 1 as z s gt 1 as t normally in c therefore the sequence e izfn converges to g normally in c similarly by choosing a subsequence if necessary we can assume that e izfn converges normally in c to some analytic function g h 2 c recall that s is a lebesgue point of mp logw therefore for an arbitrary large constant l and every n we can choose cn l cn 2 l such that p logw is uniformly bounded on the union of the lines x s cn kn let us consider a square rn whose sides lie on the lines z cn and z s cn on the vertical sides of rn fngkn 1 y because eizfngkn h 2 1 and by the choice of cn gkn 0 hence on the vertical sides of rn fn s cn iy 1 y from normal convergence of fn in c and these estimates we obtain dominated convergence for cauchy integrals for points inside r z l 2 z s l 2 and conclude that fn converges uniformly on any compact inside r since l can be arbitrarily large it follows that fn converge normally in c since a normal limit of a sequence of entire functions is entire the function h defined as e izg in c and as e izg in c extends to an entire function the property that g and g belong to h 2 c implies that h pw 1 from normal convergence of fn to h it follows that h z 0 lim fn zkn limdkn d since h 2 g 2 1 we obtain a contradiction to prove that the left hand side of 6 2 is no less than the right hand side let now zt be a point in q s c t for each t notice that st x sinc t zt x 2 sinc t zt 22 is an approximative unity at the point s and therefore st x

follows from lemma 2 from the l 2 approximation of the kernels we now pass to the uniform ap proximation near s if i is an interval on r and c 0 we denote by ci the interval with the same center as i of length c i 20 a poltoratski lemma 4 for a e s r and any c 0 sup z q s c t k t z 1 w s sinc t z o t as t 6 5 proof let zt q s c t let g again be an outer function satisfying g 2 w define t z as t z k t zt z 1 w s sinc t zt z then by lemma 3 for f t z eitzg z t z we have f t 2 h 2 o t from the strong l 2 type of the non tangential maximal operatorm it follows that mf t 22 o t we will denote by it the interval q s c t r consider the set 5 it 3 it which is a union of two intervals j 1 t and j 2 t on two thirds of each of j 1 t and j 2 t mf 2 3 mf 2 2 t c o t 2 we denote by s 1 t and s 2 t the subsets of j 1 t and j 2 t correspondingly where this inequality is satisfied once again we notice that the function r mp logw is locally summable and assume that s is its lebesgue point it follows that for sufficiently large t there exist points x 1 x 2 in s 1 t s 2 t correspondingly such that r xk 2 r s and therefore max z xk z 3 c t t z 2 e 3 ce 2 r 2 s mf xk o t where the right hand side

for a e s r and any c 0 sup z q s c t d t z 1 w s r t z 7 2 sup z q s c t d t z 1 w s sin t z o 1 as t proof note that d t z 1 w s r t z k t z 1 w s sinc t z z now the statement follows from lemma 4 because z 1 t for z q s c t the last lemma admits the obvious self improvement one can allow the size of the box q tend to zero slower than 1 t corollary 1 for a e s r there exists a function c t 0 c t as t such that sup z q s c t t d t z 1 w s r t z 7 3 22 a poltoratski sup z q s c t t d t z 1 w s sin t z o 1 as t we can now proceed to the approximation of the hermite biehler function e near s in the case when s is close to a resonance we define t 0 s c r as the set of all t for which q s c t contains a zero of e t here c can be a constant or a function of t let us denote by p the function p 2 sinh 2 p lemma 6 for a e s r such that t 0 s d is unbounded for some con stant d 1 there exists c t d c t as t with the following properties consider a continuous function z t x t iy t on t 0 s c such that for each t t 0 s c z t is one of the zeros of e t in q s c t t then for those t for which ty t 1 sup z q s c t t e t z s t ty t w s sin t z z t o 1 7 4 for some unimodular continuous function s t as t t t 0 s c ty t 1 remark 3 as follows from our proof below if one omits the restriction ty t 1 then 7 4 holds with o ty t instead of o 1 in the right hand side the restriction is included in the statement because the main part of the proof below we only need the estimates in the case ty t 1 proof let s and c 1 t be such that 7 3 is satisfied with c c 1 since e a ic vanishes at z t a t z t ic

establish 7 4 for q s l t with a constant l 2 d in place of c t on one hand from the last equation for all z w q s l t det i e t z i e t w i e t z i e t w 1 w s 2 det sin t z z t sin t w z t sin t z z

for a e s any z w q s l t and t t 0 s l 2 i w s sin t w z det e t z e t w e t z e t w o 1 2 t z w as t for some bounded function 2 comparing the last two equations we obtain 2 2 w s 1 o 1 sinh 2 ty t as t t t 0 s l altogether using that ty t 1 we get sup z q s l t e t z 2 w s sinh 2 ty t sin t z z t o 1 for some continuous unimodular as t t t 0 s l ty t 1 once again considering larger l the statement can be improved from con stant l to l t the function c from the statement can be chosen as c t l t let q s c q s c c in terms of dirac inner functions t z the last lemma can be reformulated as follows corollary 2 if s c and z t are from 7 4 then sup z q s c t t z 2 sin t z z t sin t z z t o 1 7 6 as t t t 0 s c ty t 1 we obtain the following property of resonances for dirac systems 1 1 24 a poltoratski corollary 3 let c be an arbitrary positive constant the set of all s r for which q s c t contains a zero of e for all sufficiently large t has lebesgue measure zero although we will need this statement as an intermediate step it will even tually be improved from for all sufficiently large t to just for arbitrarily large t proof let 0 be a set of s such that for some t s 0 q s c t contains a zero of e for all t t and 7 4 holds for all s with o ty t 1 2 in the right hand side see remark 3 by lusin s theorem we can assume that t s t and o ty t 1 2 are the same for all s suppose that for all s the left hand side of 7 4 is less than ty t 1 2 for t t 0 for some t 0 t and some small 0 to be specified later we can also assume that w s d for all s let n be such that 2 n t 0 let us consider a cover of index 2 of the set with intervals of length 2 n 2 the equation 7 4 shows that for t 2 n and for t 2 n 1 the functions e 2 n x and e 2 n 1 x are approxi mated on those intervals by sines with frequencies 2 n and 2 n 1 respectively note that absolute values of the approximating functions reach the values ty t 1 2 1 at the points where the absolute values of sines have local maxima on the intervals it follows that on each of the intervals e 2 n x e 2 n 1 x 0 on at least 1 100 th of the interval for some small if is small enough since the intervals cover with index 2 the last inequality holds on a set of measure at least 1 200 since n can be chosen arbitrarily large this contradicts the convergence of e t x in measure on r for two complex numbers z x iy and w u iv projzw stands for the complex number p iq such that the vector p q is the orthogonal projection of u v onto the direction of x y lemma 7 let s c t d and z t x t iy t ty t 1 be like in lemma 6 there exists t 0 such that for every interval t 1 t 2 t 0 s d t on which 7 4 holds the function s t from 7 4 can be chosen to satisfy s t eist t 7 7 on t 1 t 2 where is a function on t 1 t 2 such that x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 3 coshd f t d t dt pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 25 for any t 1 x 1 x 2 t 2 proof since the two functions in the left hand side of 7 4 are close on q s 2 d t for large enough t by the cauchy estimates their derivatives inside q s d t must be within o t from each other their absolute values at z t are 1 and within o 1 from each other the argument of the second function at z t is 2 and the argument of e is within o 1 from 2 mod 2 noticing that z sin t z z t z z t t 0 we see that arg i 2 z t z t o 1 mod 2 hence s t can be changed to satisfy i 2 z t z t 1 7 8 the rest follows from the equation 4 4 for z t z t indeed first note that proj i z t z t t z t z t is the component of the vector t z t z t responsible for the change of the argument of z the equation 4 4 shows that proj i z t z t t z t z t i z t z t z t proj i z t z t f t zz t z t z t z t s z t s f t a t i z t z t for some real function a t it follows from 7 6 that z t z t 1 o 1 t 1 sin 2 ity t and zz t z t 1 o 1 t 2 2 cos 2 ity t sin 2 2 ity t hence a t 2 cosh ty t o 1 3 coshd for large enough t since z t q s d t z t s d t now the statement follows from the equation 2 2 arg s t arg z t z t which is implied for properly chosen continuous branches of argument by 7 8 26 a poltoratski consider again the boxq s c t from corollary 1 recall that we denote by t 0 s c the set of t such that q s c t contains a zero of e t in lemma 6 we used corollary 1 to obtain approximations for e for t t 0 s c let us now discuss the case when 7 3 holds but t 6 t 0 s c i e q s c t does not contain a zero of e t our goal is to show that then e can be approximated by an exponential near s see corollary 4 below let it r q s c t for x w it one can interpret d t x w as a scalar product of two r 2 vectors and write 7 3 as d t x w a t x c t x t c t w a t w 1 w s sin t w x o 1 t x 7 9 as t 0 for some uniformly bounded fix t large enough so that o 1 t x 1 w s and c t 2 let us consider two fixed val ues of w in it w 1 and w 2 w 1 2 t since the last formula must hold for both w 1 2 and every x it we see that the vector a t x c t x t has modulus bounded away from zero on it and rotates around the origin as x runs over it since it c t t 2 t the vector makes at least one full rotation hence there exist points x 0 and x 1 on it such that e t x 0 is positive and e t x 1 is negative imaginary then c t x 0 0 and a t x 1 0 using 7 9 for x x 0 w x 1 we see that a t x 0 c 1 and c t x 1 c 2 where c 1 2 are positive constants satisfying c 1 c 2 1 w s sin t x 0 x 1 o 1 using 7 3 with d t z x 0 and d t z x 1 we see that c t z is within o 1 from 1 c 1 w s sin t z x 0 and a t z from 1 c 2 w s cos t z x 2 on q t c t where x 2 x 1 2 therefore e t z is within o 1 from 1 c 1 w s cos t z x 2 i c 2 w s sin t z x 0 on q s c t let x arge t x and let jt s 4 t s 4 t notice that if x 2 x 0 mod 2 then supjt infjt 1 for some 0 since c t lemma 1 implies that for large t there is a zero of e in q s c t which contradicts our assumption that pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 27 t 6 t 0 s c hence x 2 x 0 o 1 mod 2 similarly we obtain a contradiction if c 1 c 2 since c 1 c 2 1 w s sin t x 0 x 1 o 1 1 w s o 1 c 1 2 1 w s o 1 and e t z is within o 1 from t w s e itz on some q s c 1 t c 1 t for some t t 1 let z t u t ip t then for the second function in 7 4 we have tp t w s sin t z z t tp t w s sin t z u t ip t 2 w s sinh 2 tp t sin t z u t cos itp t sin itp t cos t z u t notice that 2 sinh 2 tp t cos itp t 1 and 2 sinh 2 tp t sin itp t i as p t and therefore the second function in 7 4 tends to i t w s eitz which is within o 1 from e on q t c 1 t if we put i summarizing the above discussion we see that 7 4 holds not only for t t 0 s c for which z t in 7 4 can be chosen as a zero of e in q s c t or a point close to zero as in lemmas 9 and 10 below but for all t with some z t when t 6 t 0 s c z t in 7 4 needs to satisfy z t c t in which case the approximating function is close to an exponential on a smaller box as before t 0 s c denotes the set of those t for which q s c t contains a zero of e t we will denote by t 1 s c the set of those t for which q s c t does not contain a zero z t of e t satisfying t z t 1 recall that all zeros of e t are in c note that those t not contained in t 0 s c also fall into t 1 s c we obtain the following 28 a poltoratski corollary 4 1 for a e s there exists c t 0 c t as t and z t x t iy t c such that sup z q s c t e t z ty t w s sin t z z t o 1 7 10 for some s t 1 as t t t 1 s c for t t 0 s c z t can be chosen as a zero of e t 2 if 7 10 holds for some s r and some c t 0 c t as t t t 1 s c then for any constant d 0 sup z q s d t e t z i s t w s eitz o 1 7 11 as t t 6 t 0 s c remark 4 similarly to remark 3 one can remove the restriction t ty t 1 in 1 and replace the right hand side of 7 10 with o ty t 8 joint approximations for e and e approximations obtained for the neumann family of hermite biehler func tions e t z in the previous section are also valid for the dirichlet family e t z it will be more convenient for us to use cosines instead of sines for e which corresponds to the substitution of z t with z t 2 t in the last statement in this section we establish relations between the parameters of the two approximating functions recall that t 0 s c denotes the set of those t for which q s c t contains a zero of e t and t 1 s c is the set of those t for which q s c t does not contain a zero z t of e t with z t 1 t lemma 8 for a e s there exists c t 0 c t with the following properties for every t t 1 s c there exist z t u t ip t z t u t ip t and t s t such that p t 0 t 1 and sup z q s c t e t z t tp t w s sin t z z t o 1 and sup z q s c t e t z t tp t w s cos t z z t o 1 pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 29 as t the function p t satisfies p t c t for t 6 t 0 s c and p t c t for t t 0 s c u t and u t satisfy cos t u t u t w s w s proof applying corollary 4 with remark 4 to e and then to e we obtain that for a e s sup z q s d t e t z t ty t w s sin t z t o ty t and sup z q s d t e t z t ty t w s cos t z t o ty t 8 1 on q s d t for some t x t iy t t x t iy t any fixed constant d 4 and unimodular t t if the approximating functions from 8 1 are plugged into the determinant 2 2 in place of e and e we get ty t ty t w s w s sin t z t cos t z t sin t z t cos t z t 8 2 notice that 8 1 imply that e ty t e ty t are bounded onq s d t uniformly with respect to t which implies that the expression in 8 2 is within o ty t ty t from the determinant in 2 2 on q s d t for z x r 8 2 becomes 2 i ty t ty t w s w s sin t x t cos t x t 2 i ty t ty t w s w s 1 2 sin t t t sin t 2 x t t suppose that t y t y t 0 then for a fixed t with the first sine being constant the second has absolute value sinh and its argument grows by more than 2 on it q s d t r hence the expression cannot be within o ty t ty t from 2 i on it this shows that t y t y t o 1 hence we can replace y t with y t so that 8 1 still holds with a different o and put p t y t in the case t q s d t ty t 1 setting z t t we obtain the following equations from 8 2 2 i w s w s cos t x t x t 2 i o 1 and 30 a poltoratski 2 i w s w s cos t x t x t 2 i o 1 from these equations we see that the unimodular constants must satisfy 1 o 1 and put t t t o 1 calculating the absolute values on each side of either of the equations we obtain cos t x t x t w s w s o 1 to see that x t and x t can be changed into u t and u t respectively to satisfy the equations of the lemma we obtain the statement with a constant d in place of c t since d can be chosen arbitrarily large standard argument allows us to improve the statement to c t remark 5 it is well known alexandrov clark formulas that for a certain bounded analytic function in c h 1 w s 1 s 2 1 s 2 w s 1 s 2 1 s 2 and w s w s 1 s 2 1 2 s 1 one can see that there always exists such that cos w s w s in the last statement ut and u t ut t satisfy cos t u t ut cos w s w s because of periodicity one can assume that 2 recall that for almost all s r w s w s 6 0 and can be chosen so that 2 in lemma 6 the approximation of e by a sine was constructed so that one of the zeros of e was also a zero of the approximating function in some of our future calculations it will be more convenient for us to choose the approximating functions so that their values at s coincided with the value of the approximant our next lemma states that it is possible to achieve such an approximation simultaneously for e and e while keeping the relations between the parameters of the approximating functions from lemma 8 lemma 9 suppose that s r and c 1 is a constant suppose that w s w s 6 0 there exists 0 0 such that for any 0 the following holds if e t z ty w s sin t z x iy pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 31 and e t z ty w s cos t z x iy on q s 3 c t for some t 0 x x y r c satisfying 1 ty 2 c 1 and 2 t x x 2 cos t x x w s w s 8 3 then there exist y x x r and c 1 satisfying tx tx tx tx ty ty d x x x x for some constant d d c s and such that e t s ty w s sin t s x iy and e t s ty w s cos t s x iy 8 4 proof put f z w s w s sin t z x iy cos t z x iy note that under the restriction t x x 2 f is not constant denote by j the middle third of i q s 3 c t r note that e t s e t s f s 2 for all s j if 0 is small enough under the restriction imposed on y f z t and f z t 2 are bounded and bounded away from zero in 1 2 t neighborhood of j for large enough t by constants depending only on w s w s hence for small enough there exists d 1 0 such that in the disk b s d 1 t f takes all values from b f s 2 let a b f s 2 be such that f a e s e s then x x a s x x a s y y a s will satisfy e s e s w s w s sin t s x iy cos t s x iy recalling that e e satisfy 2 2 this implies that e s ty w s sin t s x iy and e s ty w s cos t s x iy 32 a poltoratski in addition to arg e s e s arg sin t s x iy cos t s x iy hence 8 4 will hold with some 1 then will follow automatically form the inequalities in the statement it will be convenient for us to restate the last lemma without corollary 5 for a e s r there exist positive functions c t c t t t

0 1 be a small number we will say that an interval i r is a interval for f if i f 1 i f as one can see from the definition a interval is an interval where f has almost the same sign which leads to limited cancellation in i f note that for a locally summable f almost every point where f 6 0 is a lebesgue point and therefore has a neighborhood which is a interval pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 33 for the rest of the paper we consider intervals for the potential f with a fixed a small positive 1 100 whose exact value is unimportant in our next statement we show that the approximating functions can be chosen so that their zeros move in the same way as the zeros of e and e as t changes over a interval while the values of approximating functions at s remain equal to e s and e s lemma 10 for almost every s r there exists c t 0 c t and t 0 t 0 as t such that the following holds let t 1 t 2 t 0 s c t t t 2 t 1 1 s 1 be a interval such that t 2 t 1 f 1 100 and c t 10 for t t 1 let a be a constant 8 a c t for t t 1 let 1 be a zero of e t 1 z in q s a t 1 which moves inside q t a t continuously to 2 as t changes from t 1 to t 2 2 is a zero of e t 2 z in q s a t 2 let 1 2 be similar zeros of e inside q t a t assume that tk k tk k 2 for k 1 2 then the zeros of e and e change in similar ways as t changes from t 1 to t 2 2 1 2 1 t 1 2 1 and there exist real

zeros of approximating functions change similarly to the zeros of e and e i e xt 2 iyt 2 xt 1 iyt 1 2 1 t 1 2 1 and x t 2 iyt 2 x t 1 iyt 1 2 1 t 1 2 1 proof assume that s is such that the conclusion of corollary 5 holds then yt 1 xt 1 x t 1 and t 1 satisfying 1 3 exist our goal is to find yt 2 xt 2 x t 2 and t 2 to satisfy 1 3 and 4 34 a poltoratski let s t z be the solution to the equation 2 5 for t t 1 t 2 with the initial condition s t 1 z t 1 t 1 yt 1 w s sin t 1 z xt 1 iyt 1 let i t z be the corresponding dirac inner functions which solve 4 1 with the initial condition i t 1 z is t 1 z since s t z eitzs t z satisfies 5 1 it follows that for x r t s t x f t s t x and therefore s t x s t 1 x e t t 1 f 4 w s 1 t t 1 f 8 w s 8 10 using 5 1 once again we obtain s t 1 x e ix t t 1 s t x 8 w s t t 1 f 8 11 for all t t 1 t 2 and x r let us denote by t 1 1 the zero of s t 1 z and by and t the zero of s t z evolved from 1 we will assume that 1 is the zero of s t 1 z closest to 1 or one of the closest zeros if there are more than one at the same distance then 1 1 o 1 t because of 2 let t be the zero of e t z evolving from 1 t 1 since s t z is outer in c the previous inequality and the maximum principle implies s t 1 z s t z 8 w s t t 1 f for all z c it follows that s t 1 t s t t s t 1 t 8 w s t t 1 f and therefore 1 t c 1 t 2 t 1 f t 2 8 12 where the constant c 1 depends only on w s and a the same inequality holds for every zero 1 of s t 1 z and its evolution t we also have z 1 zt c 2 t 2 t 1 f t 2 pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 35 for t t 1 t 2 for the zeros of e in q s 3 c t 1 t 1 including zt t indeed by 8 5 z t zt t for t t 1 t 2 hence 4 3 implies the last inequality note that since as follows from 8 5 1 1 o 1 t the last two inequal ities imply t t 2 c 3 t 2 t 1 f t 2 o 1 t 2 since e and s satisfy 8 5 at t t 1 z t 1 1 iz t 1 1 o 1 t 1 since e satisfies 8 5 for all t t 1 t 2 z t t zz t t z t t c 4 t since the zeros of s t z are close to the zeros of s t 1 z see 8 12 iz t t izz t t iz t t c 5 t for t t 1 t 2 from 4 4 we now obtain iz t t z t t t t 1 2 t t c 4 c 5 t c 4 c 5 t f t c 4 c 5 t t 2 t 1 f o 1 for all t t 1 t 2 since z t zt

f t t 2 together with 8 12 we obtain that for all zeros of i t z t 2 t 1 2 1 8 14 without loss of generality we can assume that c t t then all zeros of i t 1 z in q s c t 1 have the same imaginary parts and their real parts differ by at most 1 t 1 since all zeros satisfy 4 4 their velocities t may differ by at most c 8 t 1 t t 2 t 1 f o t similarly to 8 13 their arguments arg t change by less than 2 which implies that for any such zero t for which t 1 belonged to q s c t 1 t 1 we have like for 1 2 t 2 t 1 2 1 o 2 1 8 15 this estimate together with 8 14 which holds for the zeros of s which are far away from q s a t imply that s t 2 z d 1 sin t 2 z 1 2 1 o t 2 2 1 for z q s a t for some complex constant d 1 this relation can be de duced from the infinite product representation for the sine using the relations between the zeros of s t 2 and the zeros of sine described above once again the constant a in q s a t can now be replaced with a slowly growing function and we will assume that the last equation holds for z q s c t t making c grow slower if necessary analogously the solution s t z of 2 5 with the initial condition s t 1 z 1 t 1 y 1 w s cos t 1 z 1 where 1 x t 1 iyt 1 will satisfy s t 2 z d 2 cos t 2 z 1 2 1 o t 2 2 1 on q s c t t for some complex constant d 2 if c t is different from the one above we choose the minimum of the two for each t since e e satisfy 8 5 and 8 6 z t 1 1 z t 1 1 o t pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 37 since 1 1 1 t and z t t z t t satisfy 4 4 via the argument similar to the one used above we get z t t z t t o t o z t t for all t t 1 t 2 since the velocities of zeros of e and e satisfy 4 3 2 1 2 1 o 2 1 therefore s t 2 z d 2 cos t 2 z 1 2 1 o t 2 2 1 next notice that the uniqueness of solution for the differential equation 2 5 implies that s t 2 s e t 2 s s t 2 s e t 2 s combining this with earlier estimates it follows that sin t 2 s 1 2 1 cos t 2 s 1 2 1 e t 2 s e t 2 s o t 2 2 1 using the same argument as in the proof of lemma 9 one can find a constant o 1 2 1 such that sin t 2 s 1 2 1 cos t 2 s 1 2 1 e t 2 s e t 2 s 8 16 note that we still have s t 2 z d 1 sin t 2 z 1 2 1 o t 2 2 1 and s t 2 z d 2 cos t 2 z 1 2 1 o t 2 2 1 for z q s a t let y 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 because of the determinant equation 2 2 which must be satisfied by the solutions s and s in place of e and e d 1 and d 2 can be chosen so that d 1 d 2 0 d 1 d 2 2 t 2 y 2 w s w s 8 17 if the point s 1 is such that t 1 s 1 t 1 s x 1 x 1 2 then s t 1 s 1 s t 1 s 38 a poltoratski notice that since s s 1 2 t 2 2 5 implies t arg s t s 1 s t s s s 1 t 2 t 1 2 t 2 t 1 f 2 t 2 2 t 2 t 1 f for t t 1 t 2 for the absolute values if we take into account the initial condition s t 1 s 1 s t 1 s d 2 2 6 implies s t s 1 s t s d e t t 1 f t cos 2 arg s t s 1 e t t 1 f t cos 2 args t s 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 f t 2 t 1 f therefore s t 2 s 1 s t 2 s c 9 t 2 t 1 f 2 t 2 t 1 f t 2 combining the last relation with 8 17 we obtain that the constants d 1 d 2 can be chosen so that d 1 2 t 2 y 2 w s d 2 2 t 2 y 2 w s for some unimodular constant 2 using trigonometric identities one can show that t 2 y 2 w s sin t 2 s 1 2 1 t 2 y 2 w s cos t 2 s 1 2 1 t 2 y 2 w s sin t 2 s 1 2 1 t 2 y 2 w s cos t 2 s 1 2 1 2 i since e e must satisfy the same relation 2 2 and 8 16 it follows that t 2 y 2 w s sin t 2 s 1 2 1 e t 2 s and t 2 y 2 w s cos t 2 s 1 2 1 e t 2 s hence one can put xt 2 1 2 1 x t 2 1 2 1 yt 2 y 2 1 2 1 finally the unimodular constant 2 can be adjusted to satisfy 3 and taken as t 2 pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 39 9 classification of time intervals according to the movement of resonances in this section let c 1 be a large fixed constant recall that for s r t 0 s c is the set of t r such that the box q s c t contains a zero of e t suppose that there exists a set s such that s 0 and the set t 0 s c is unbounded for every s s it follows from corollary 3 that t 0 s 3 c cannot cover a half line except possibly for a zero set of s we will assume that for all s s t 0 s c is unbounded but t 0 s 3 c does not cover a half line then for each s s there will exist time intervals t 1 t 2 arbitrarily far in time such that a zero z s t of e t z enters q s 3 c t at t t 1 and enters q s c t at t t 2 while moving continuously inside q s 3 c t q s c t during the time period t t 1 t 2 without loss of generality we can assume that for all s s z s t 1 t for all t t 1 t 2 indeed choose z s t to be the first zero to reenter the box q s c t at t t 2 then if z s t 1 t for some t t 1 t 2 applying lemma 6 together with remark 3 to the box q s 3 c t we see that many zeros of the approximating sine function and hence many zeros of e are already in the box q s c t which contradicts our choice of z s t in particular we can assume that for every s s there will exist infinitely many intervals with the following properties arbitrarily far in time let ls 1 2 t 0 s 3 c be a time interval satisfying 1 there exists a zero z s t of e t z inq s 3 c t for all t ls t 7 z s t is a continuous curve for t ls and z s t 1 t for t ls 2 z s 1 q s 3 c 1 3 if 2 n 1 2 n 1 then 2 is such that either z s 2 q s c 2 or 2 2 n 2 if the zero enters the box q s c t after t 2 n 2 as was mentioned before for every s s we can find infinitely many disjoint intervals ls with the above properties arbitrarily far in time we will denote such an interval by lns if 2 n 1 2 n 1 if there are more than one such interval for a given s and n we will choose one of them we will denote by sn the set of all s such that there exists an interval lns 1 2 with the above properties then each s s belongs to infinitely many sn we will also assume that the approximation formulas from our previous lemmas and corollaries which hold for a e s hold for all s s by lusin s theorem we can also assume that all o appearing in those statements are majorated by uniform o over s s 40 a poltoratski next observe that there exists 0 depending only on c such for each lns 1 2 2 1 f t dt 9 1 this follows from the property that z t z s t t for all t lns which is implied by 7 6 from 4 3 and the property that z s 1 z s 2 1 t we will assume that 0 1 100 cosh 3 c 9 2 and adjust lns 1 2 in such a way that 2 2 1 f t dt 0 9 3 by decreasing 2 if necessary also choosing a smaller if necessary we can fix lns 1 2 so that 2 1 3 c t dt 1 100 9 4 indeed since 2 1 3 2 n the last integral is at most 9 c if one divides 1 2 into k equal subintervals k 900 c at least on one of them the integral of f t will be no less than k the last integral will be at most 9 c k 1 100 hence we can choose that subinterval and adjust the endpoints to satisfy the inequality 9 3 with k in place of for t t 0 s 3 c let s t be be the continuous function from 7 4 in lemma 6 satisfying the conclusion of lemma 7 an interval i t 0 s 3 c is a vs interval if 2 s t 1 100 for all t i it is an hs interval if 2 s t 1 200 for all t i note that since s t is continuous on lns the whole interval l n s can be covered up to countably many points by disjoint intervals each of which is either vs or hs interval or both we will denote the first collection of intervals v lns and the second hl n s in our notations above v stands for vertical and h for horizontal indeed according to 4 3 when 2 s t is small the resonance moves almost vertically and when it is bounded away from zero the motion has a horizontal component comparable with the total increment these two cases of motion will require different estimates in the next two sections the set sn can be split into disjoint subsets snv and s n h defined as pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 41 snv s sn i v lns i f 99 100 lns f and snh s sn i v lns i f 99 100 lns f note that then for each s snh i hlns i f 1 100 lns f 10 vertical intervals let s snv since s sn for each such s there exists the interval lns 1 2 with 2 n 1 2 n 1 defined in the last section split the interval lns into three intervals l n s t n t ns t n where t n is the interval to the left from t ns and t n is the interval to the right so that tns f 3 tn f 3 tn f 3 10 1 without loss of generality we can assume that each interval from v lns and hlns is either contained in t n s or is disjoint from t n s let f denote the two positive functions with disjoint essential supports such that f f f since either tns f 6 or tns f 6 we can also assume that the inequality with f holds for all t n s note that 10 1 implies that if t n s intersects t nq for some other q snv then t nq lns consider the set w s sn v t ns one can choose a finite collection t k t nsk k 1 2 n such that a 1 w t k f 100 a 2 each t k intersects at most 2 other t k and each point in t k is covered by at most two intervals note that as follows from a 1 and a 2 for each t ns s snv there exists an interval from our collection t m such that tns t m f 12 42 a poltoratski furthermore if the last inequality is satisfied then t m e 4 itsf t dt 40 indeed s snv and t m lns which implies b 1 t m i v lns i f 100 b 2 t m i v lsi f 6 100 10 b 3 t m i v lns i f 2 t m i v lsi f 4 s t 4 t m i v lsi f e 4 itsdt the first inequality in b 3 follows from the definition of vertical intervals from v lns and the second inequality holds because on ls 1 2 and therefore on i v lsi s t satisfies the relation from lemma 7 which together with 9 2 9 3 and 9 4 yields s t s 1 eist 4 cosh 3 c 1 100 1 10 for t lns t 0 s 3 c let sm be the set of all s snv such that tns tm f 12 then as we discussed before sm snv we obtain that for all s sm t m e 4 itsf t dt 40 therefore f 2 l 2 t m d s m and f 2 l 2 t m d sm d snv for some d 0 since each point of t m is covered by at most two intervals see a 2 this implies claim 1 2 f 2 l 2 2 n 2 n 2 2 f 2 l 2 tm d s n v pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 43 11 horizontal intervals in this section we will estimate the scattering function at 1 t 2 corresponding to an interval t 1 t 2 r the shortest way to define such a function is to say that it is the function a defined as in section 5 corresponding to the system 1 1 whose potential function is equal to f on t 1 t 2 and to 0 elsewhere more constructively if m t z is the transfer matrix of the system 1 1 then one can define the transfer matrix from t t 1 to t t 2 as mt 1 t 2 z at 1 t 2 z bt 1 t 2 z ct 1 t 2 z dt 1 t 2 z m t 2 z m 1 t 1 z after that the hermite biehler functions et 1 t 2 z and e t 1 t 2 z can be defined as et 1 t 2 at 1 t 2 ict 1 t 2 e t 1 t 2 bt 1 t 2 idt 1 t 2 and at 1 t 2 z 1 2 ei t 2 t 1 z et 1 t 2 z ie t 1 t 2 z note that mt 1 t 2 is equal to the transfer matrix m t 2 t 1 z of the real dirac system whose potential function f is equal to f t t 1 for 0 t t 2 t 1 and to 0 for t t 2 t 1 similarly the functions et 1 t 2 e t 1 t 2 and at 1 t 2 are equal to the functions e t 2 t 1 z e t 2 t 1 z and a t 2 t 1 z generated by that system in particular parseval s identity for at 1 t 2 becomes log at 1 t 2 l 1 r f l 2 t 1 t 2 one of the main tools in our estimates for the hs intervals will be the following lemma lemma 11 let s be such that the conclusion of lemma 10 holds let the interval t 1 t 2 t 0 s a c t a xt and yt be like in lemma 10 let let at 1 t 2 be the scattering function and let it 2 be the interval s 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 then log at 1 t 2 l 1 it 2 d t 2 t 2 xt 2 s t 1 xt 1 s o t 2 yt 2 t 1

in lemma 10 thus we obtain that log at 1 t 2 s 1 2 1 o 22 21 note that lemma 10 could be formulated with any any point u in it 2 s 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 in place of s using the same zeros k k of e e in condition 4 let xuk x u k yuk be the coordinates of the zeros of approximation functions from lemma 10 with u in place of s suppose that 1 in the last inequality is positive since in the conditions of lemma 10 a 8 the box q s a t contains several zeros of approximating functions and switching to the next zero if necessary we can assume that xuk u xk s by lemma 10 we have xu 2 iy u 2 xu 1 iyu 1 2 1

from below and deduce the inequality in the statement as was mentioned before every lebesgue point s of f such that f s 6 0 has a neighborhood which is a interval for f therefore for each hs interval i the set i f 6 0 can be covered up to a set of arbitrarily small mass by finitely many disjoint intervals contained in i these intervals will also be hs intervals pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 47 claim 2 let the interval j t 1 t 2 in the last statement be an hs and a interval put it 2 s 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 then log at 1 t 2 l 1 it 2 d t 2 t 2 t 1 f for large enough t 1 and some absolute constant d 0 proof since j is a interval j f 9 10 j f let t be the zero of e t z from the statement of lemma 10 k tk k 1 2 then z t t t for all t j also by the definition of hs intervals by corollary 2 and 7 8 z t t z t t 300 for all t j if t 1 is large enough by continuity it implies that z t t z t t 300 or z t t z t t 300 on j denote k tk and assume that 2 1 j f t z t t 0 the case 0 can be proved similarly note that because j is anhs interval 2 1 2 1 by condition 4 of lemma 10 the zeros of the approximating function satisfy xt 2 s xt 1 s o 2 1 since in lemma 10 xt is the real part of any zero of the approximating function in q s a t 1 and a 8 one can pick the zero with xt 2 s recall that t 2 t 1 1 now using condition 4 of lemma 10 since j is an hs and a interval t 2 xt 2 s t 1 xt 1 s t 1 xt 2 xt 1 d 1 t 1 2 1 d 1 t 1 j f t z t t d 2 j f for large enough t 1 whereas t 2 yt 2 t 1 yt 1 d 3 j f now the claim follows from the last lemma recall that we are considering the set s r as defined in section 9 we can assume that s once again we can assume the condition for large enough t in the last statement is uniform over s and that the inequality holds for all s s for large enough t the sets snh were also defined in section 9 48 a poltoratski claim 3 snh d f 2 l 2 2 n 2 n 2 for some constant d 0 proof note that snh s consider a finite collection of intervals i 1 in centered at s 1 sn sh of the size ik c 2 n which covers at least one half of snh so that no point on r is covered by more than two of ik consider the intervals l n sk k 1 2 n as defined in section 9 notice that if t 1 t 2 from claim 2 is inside l n sk then each it 2 sk from claim 2 is inside ik consider a collection of disjoint intervals t 1 tm tk k 1 k 2 with the following properties 1 each tl belongs to hlsk for some k 1 all tl are intervals 2 for each k tl hlsk tl f 500 where 0 is from 9 1 existence of such intervals tl follows from the property that sk snh and from the fact that for every lebesgue point t of f f t 6 0 all small enough intervals containing t are intervals then by claim 2 m l 1 log a l 1 l 2 l 1 r m l 1 tl f k tl hlsk ik n k 1 ik l tl hlsk tl f 500 n k 1 ik 2000 sh now applying parseval s identity to each a l 1 l 2 in the above inequality we obtain the statement 12 proof of main theorem recall that the set s r was defined as the set of s such that the set t 0 s c is unbounded i e such s for which there exist arbitrarily large t such that the box q s c t contains a zero of e t as was discussed in section 9 every s s must belong to infinitely many subsets sn consisting pointwise convergence of the non linear fourier transform 49 of those s for which the zero enters the box during the time period t 2 n 2 n 1 since by claims 1 and 3 n sn n snv snh n f 2 l 2 2 n 2 n 2 the set of s that belong to infinitely many sn has measure zero therefore s 0 for any c hence for a e s r there exists c t 0 c t as t such that q s c t t has no zero of e t corollary 4 part 2 now implies that for a e s and any d 0 sup q s d t e t z i s t w s eitz o 1 12 1 as t since 1 it follows that e t s 1 w s for a e s similarly for a e s sup q s d t e t z i w s eitz o 1 12 2 where is the same as in the previous formula the equation 2 2 implies that t can be chosen as a constant e i arcsin w s w s therefore e t s 1 w s and a t s 1 2 1 w s cos 2 w s 1 2 1 w s w s at a e s and b s t 1 2 1 w s cos 2 w s 1 2 1 w s w s at a e s note that convergence of a a e and convergence of log a 1 which follows from parseval s identity implies convergence of log a in
