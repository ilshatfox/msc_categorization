ar x iv 2 10 8 00 33 9 v 1 m at h c v 3 1 ju l 20 21 a direct proof of stahl s theorem for a generic class of algebraic functions sergey p suetin abstract under the assumption of the existence of stahl s s compact set we give a short proof of the limit zeros distribution of pade polynomials and convergence in capacity of diagonal pade approximants for a generic class of algebraic functions the proof is direct but not from the opposite as stahl s original proof is the generic class means in particular that all branch points of the multi sheeted riemann surface of the algebraic function are of the first order i e we assume the surface is such that all branch points are of square root type we do not use the relations of orthogonality at all the proof is based on the maximum principle only bibliography 13 titles 1 introduction 1 1 the seminal stahl s theory see 12 13 1 and the bibliography therein on the convergence of diagonal pade approximants for the multivalued analytic functions consists of two parts namely geometrical part and analytical part in the first part it is proven that for a multi valued function there exists a unique admissible compact set s possesses stahl s symmetric property traditionally it is refereed to as an s compact set or briefly s curve see 12 and 9 for details in the original stahl s theory it is supposed that the set of singularities of a multivalued analytic function is of zero logarithmic capacity here we restrict our investigation to the case of finite number of singular points only note that a short proof of the existence of an s curve for a multivalued analytic function with a finite number of singular points was proposed by e rakhmanov in 1994 in the unpublished paper 8 see also 6 rakhmanov s proof is based on the connection between capacity and potential of equilibrium measure of a compact set in the second part of the stahl s theory it is proven that there exists zeros limit distribution of pade polynomials and convergence in capacity of the diagonal pade approximants takes place as well the original stahl s proof of the existence of limit zeros distribution of pade polynomials is based on the method of proof from the opposite in the current paper we give a short and direct proof of the second part of stahl s theory for a generic class of algebraic functions and under the assumption that the first geometrical component is valid we do not use the relations of orthogonality at all the proof is based on the maximum principle only cf 7 and 11 let introduce a generic class f of admissible multivalued functions which was mentioned above date july 1 2021 1 http arxiv org abs 2108 00339 v 1 2 sergey p suetin we set that f f if the following conditions are satisfied 1 f is an algebraic function with all the branch points of the first order i e we assume that all the branch points are of square root type 2 s curve of f consists of a finite number of non intersected closed analytic arcs each of which contains exactly two branch points of f the ends of the arc some discussion on this assumptions are given in section 3 1 2 let f f f h and s s f be the corresponding stahl s compact set let s be the probability equilibrium measure supported on s and v s z be the corresponding logarithmic potential of s v s z s gs z z d c s 1 gs z is the green function for the domain d with the logarithmic singularity at the infinity point z and s is the robin constant for d set pn cn z be the set of all algebraic polynomials with complex coefficients of order 6 n for arbitrary polynomial q c z q 6 0 we denote by q the zero counting measure of q q q 0 where each zero of q is represented with respect to its multiplicity for f h and arbitrary n n pade polynomials pn qn pn qn 6 0 are defined non uniquely from the following relation rn z qnf pn z o 1 zn 1 z 2 rn z is the so called error function the following result holds see 12 13 theorem 1 let f f and f h then as n 1 n qn 1 n pn s 3 set qn z z kn then as n rn z 1 n cap cap s e gs z inside d 4 f z n n f z 1 n cap e 2 gs z inside d 5 recall that the existence of an s compact set for a function f f follows from 8 2 proof of theorem 1 2 1 for two positive sequences n and n the relation n n means that 0 c 1 6 n n 6 c 2 for n 1 2 and some constants c 1 c 2 which do not depend on n for two sequences n z and n z of functions holomorphic in a domain the relation n n means that for each compact set k and n 1 2 0 c 1 6 n z n z 6 c 2 for z k where the constants c 1 c 2 depend on k but do not depend on n and z k evidently that for such pairs of sequences and functions we have that n n 1 n 1 as n on a stahl s theorem 3 since f f we have that s s f p j 1 sj where sj arc a 2 j 1 a 2 j set w 2 p j 1 z a 2 j 1 z a 2 j then the two sheeted hyperelliptic riemann surface rs r 2 w of the function w is the rs associated with f h f f in accordance with stahl s theory point z on r 2 w is given by z z w the rs r 2 w may be considered as a two sheeted covering of the riemann sphere c with the canonical projection r 2 w c z z let 1 s then shares r 2 w into two domains we shall call them the open sheets of r 2 w the function w is a single valued function on this rs and has opposite signs on the sheets we denote by r 0 2 the sheet of r 2 w where w z z p 1 as z and refereed to it as zero sheet another sheet will be denoted by r 1 2 and refereed to as first sheet of r 2 w then we have r 2 w r 0 2 r 1 2 points on the sheets will be denoted by z j j 0 1 respectively evidently r j 2 d we shall identify r 0 2 with the stahl s domain d c s and 0 with and consider the germ f as the germ f 0 in general r 2 w is not the riemann surface of f and thus f is not a single valued on r 2 w but since f f the germ f 0 can be extended from the infinity point 0 to the whole zero sheet r 0 2 and even more to a small enough neighborhood v 0 1 of v 0 1 r 1 2 6 in accordance with stahl s theory see also 8 the green function gs z of d can be lifted to rs r 2 w as g z with the following properties g z 0 g z g z 1 g z 0 0 from now on we shall suppose that v 0 1 is such that v 0 1 r 1 2 z 1 g z logr r 1 set d r 0 2 v 0 1 be a domain on r 2 w and f 0 continues in d as a meromorphic analytic and single valued function f m d the function rn z is also extended to d as a meromorphic function rn z let a polynomial qm z z m is such that the set of its zeros coincide with the projection of poles of f in d then f qnf and qmrn are holomorphic functions in d 2 2 for each 1 r we denote by 1 the set of points z 1 such that gs z log as z 1 1 clearly we have g z 1 log the set 0 is defined similarly and we have on that set g z 0 log for 1 r let d 1 be a subdomain of d with d 1 1 0 d 1 similarly d 0 d d 0 0 0 d 0 set un z log qm z rn z n 1 m g z z d 6 function un is a subharmonic function in d thus for each 1 r we have that un z 6 max 1 un z d 1 7 from 7 it follows that rn z 0 qm z 6 1 2 n 2 2 m mn 1 z 8 4 sergey p suetin where we set mn 1 max z rn z 1 qm z relations 6 and 7 imply that for 1 1 2 r we have mn 1 1 6 2 1 n m 1 mn 1 2 9 the following identity holds true rn z 0 qn z f z 0 pn z qn z f z 1 pn z qn z f z 0 f z 1 rn z 1 qn z f z 0 f z 1 z 10 from 8 and 9 it follows that max z qn z f z 0 f z 1 qm z mn 1 1 n n 0 11 from now on we shall consider only such 1 r that qm z f z 0 f z 1 c 0 as z clearly f z 0 f z 1 6 0 set mn max z qn z then from 11 it follows that mn mn 1 12 since degqn 6 n then bernstein walsh theorem gives us the inequality qn z 6 e ng 1 z mn 1 z 2 2 1 13 where g 1 z is the green function for the domain gs z log 1 clearly g 1 z gs z log 1 from 13 we obtain the estimate mn 2 6 2 1 n mn 1 14 after combining the relations 9 12 and 14 we obtain that mn 2 2 1 n mn 1 and mn 1 2 2 1 n mn 1 1 15 let qn z z kn kn degqn 6 n again bernstein walsh theorem gives us the inequality qn z 6 e kng 1 z mn 1 z 2 2 1 16 from this relation it follows that mn 2 6 2 1 kn mn 1 17 but in accordance with 15 mn 2 2 1 nmn 1 from here and 17 we obtain the inequality 2 1 n 6 c 2 1 kn 18 where c c 1 2 kn 6 n 1 1 2 it directly follows from 18 that degqn n 1 n 19 on a stahl s theorem 5 2 3 let d z c gs z log 1 g z be the green function for d then g z gs z log log z o 1 log z s log o 1 thus s log set un z 1 kn log qn z g z 1 kn logmn 20 since function un is subharmonic in the domain d and un 6 0 on then un 6 0 in d and un 6 0 thus we have that log s 6 logmn 1 kn and finally obtain mn 1 kn e s cap s 21 for z k d and we have by definition g z 0 let now extend the function g z inside by identity g z 0 when z d int let qn z kn j 1 z j vn z 1 kn log qn z g z 1 kn kn j 1 g z j 1 kn logmn 22 z d then vn is a harmonic function in d and vn 6 0 on from this it follows that for z 2 2 r we have qn z exp kn j 1 g z j 6 mn exp kng z 23 let z n 2 is such that qn z n mn 2 then from 23 we obtain that mn 2 exp kn j 1 g z n j 6 mn 2 kn 24 ultimately from 24 and 15 we obtain that exp 1 kn kn j 1 g z n j 6 c 2 1 kn n 0 25 let now n is a subsequence such that z n z 2 and 1 kn qn as n n 1 1 then according to the descendence principle see 5 chapter i 3 theorem 1 3 10 2 and 3 we have that g z d 6 0 z 2 2 26 it directly follows from 26 that supp c d since it is true for every 1 than we have that supp s 6 sergey p suetin 2 4 so we have got that kn n 1 and each limit point of the sequence 1 kn qn satisfies the condition supp s since supp s we have that lim n n mn 1 kn 6 c 2 also from 21 it follows that lim n n mn 1 kn c 1 0 set un z 1 kn log 1 qn z 1 kn kn j 1 g z j g z z d then un is a sequence of harmonic functions in d let u z lim n un z then u is a harmonic function with the following properties see 15 u z v z v s z const min z 1 u z min z 2 u z for each 1 2 from this it follows that u z const and thus v z v s z for z d since supp s then v z v s for z d finally s because s has no inner points eventually we have that for each 1 there exist the limits lim n mn 1 n lim n mn 1 1 n caps 1 27 lim n max z s qn z 1 n caps e s lim n max z rn z 0 1 n 1 e s 28 from the above it easy to prove that rn z 1 n cap cap s e gs z n 29 indeed let vn z 1 n m 1 log qm z rn z gs z s 30 then for each 1 function vn is a subharmonic function in d and from 28 it follows that for z we have vn z 6 cn 31 where cn 0 as n from 31 we obtain that for z d qm z rm z 1 n m 1 6 cap s e gs z ecn 32 thus lim n rn z 1 n 6 cap s e gs z 33 relation 29 follows from 28 and 33 by two constants theorem cf 4 3 subsection 8 31 36 since 1 n qn s then inside d qn z 1 n cap e v s z n 34 on a stahl s theorem 7 from 29 and 34 the relation 5 follows theorem 1 is proven 3 appendix in fact the admissible class of analytic functions is wider then it is described in the items 1 2 of definition of f in particular our approach is valid for the class of multivalued functions generated by the inverse zhoukovskii transform more precisely let z z z 2 1 1 2 where z c 1 1 and such branch of the function 1 2 is chosen that z z 2 as z let 1 a b and a a 1 a 2 b b 1 b 2 then the function f z a 1 z b 1 z 1 2 35 is an algebraic function of forth order with the set of square root singularities f 1 a b under the above conditions on 1 2 we have that f h c and stahl s compact set s f 1 1 now let j z be the inverse zhoukovskii function for a segment j j j j 1 m j k j 6 k set f z m j 1 f j z 36 where each f j z is defined by 35 with some suitable aj and bj when all j r j 1 m then s f m j 1 j since c z f f our approach is valid for each f c z f another admissible and non trivial subclass of f is obtained when at least one of the branch points j j j 1 m of f does not belong to the real line we can generalize 35 in the following way set f z a 1 z b 1 z c 1 z 37 where c z z to obtain functions which are not from f but for which the proof from section 2 is also valid references 1 a i aptekarev v i buslaev a mart nez finkelshtein s p suetin pade approximants continued fractions and orthogonal polynomials russian math surveys
