completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno abstract by studying the development of shock waves out of discontinuity waves in 1954 p lax discovered a class of pdes which he called completely exceptional where such a transition does not occur after a finite time a straightforward integration of the completely exceptionality conditions allowed boillat to show that such pdes are actually of monge ampe re type in this paper we first recast these conditions in terms of characteristics and then we show that the completely exceptional pdes with 2 or 3 independent variables can be described in terms of the conformal geometry of the lagrangian grassmannian where they are naturally embedded moreover for an arbitrary number of independent variables we show that the space of rth degree sections of the lagrangian grassmannian can be resolved via a bgg operator in the particular case of 1 st degree sections

19 completely exceptionality is what marks the line between genuinely nonlinear systems and nonlinear systems displaying a linear behavior the essence of this claim can be grasped by thinking about a well known physical phenomenon the sonic boom an aircraft produces a disturbance in the otherwise steady surrounding medium the air in the terminology of 19 the solution representing the still air is referred to as the unperturbed state u 0 whereas the perturbed state u 1 describes the fluctuations in the air pressure introduced by the flying object since the disturbance travels at finite speed there is always a portion of the medium which does not feel the fluctuations this implies the existence of the so called wave front i e the locus where the solution u 0 bifurcates into the solution u 1 in other word the global solution which describes the status of the medium traversed by a sub sonic vehicle is the discontinuity wave obtained by gluing u 0 from the left of the wave front with u 1 on its right see figure below by construction a discontinuity wave is a c 1 piecewise solution even if both u 0 and u 1 are regular i e c perturbed state u 1 perturbed state u 1 unperturbed state u 0 unperturbed state u 0 wave front shock front as the plane goes super sonic a geometric locus appears where the pressure peaks of the disturbances introduced by the moving body sum up to an explosive value immediately beyond this locus the pressure drops back to its steady state value in other words the states u 0 and u 1 are now separated i e the global solution obtained as before by gluing 1 u 0 and u 1 is not even continuous as its value suffers a jump along what is now called a shock front such a solution is known as a shock wave the name shock being evocative of the fact that when the geometric locus intersects the ground people can actually feel the pressure discontinuity as a loud sometimes painful bang 2 a key feature of both discontinuity and shock waves is that the wavefront in the former as well as the shock front in the latter are characteristic hypersurfaces or lines when the number of independent variables is equal to 2 the speed at which the characteristic lines travel in time is known as the characteristic speed the speed of sound in our case essentially a system is called completely exceptional if the phenomenon just described never occurs i e when discontinuity waves never turn into shock waves 20 since the development of shock waves out of discontinuity waves is a typical feature of nonlinear systems of pdes it is easy to understand p lax s claim that non completely exceptional systems are in a sense genuinely nonlinear the notion of complete exceptionality was extensively studied in the case of quasi linear hyperbolic systems of first order pdes see for instance 6 5 20 the eigenvalues associated to a given system of this type that can be interpreted as characteristic velocities can have jump discontinuities along a characteristic hypersurface as higher in this case first order derivatives of solutions can suffer a jump through it 5 it can be proved that this phenomenon does not occur if and only if the system is completely exceptional 20 these reasonings naturally extend to 2 nd order scalar pdes so that we can give the following definition definition 1 1 a quasi linear hyperbolic system of first order pdes resp hyperbolic 2 nd order scalar pde is completely exceptional if its characteristic velocities have no jump discontinuities 1 it should be stressed that not all pairs of regular solutions can be glued to a weak solution see 19 def 3 1 but some compatibility conditions known as rankine hugoniot equations must be checked beforehand see 19 sec 3 2 2 2 needless to say a non continuous solution is just an approximation since a non zero jump in the field value can only be caused by an infinite force whose existence is usually forbidden by physical laws in practice the jump discontinuity in a sonic boom takes place in a very thin though three dimensional domain whose thickness has been experimentally detected in 200 nm 10 completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 3 we underline that for characteristic velocities of a 2 nd order scalar pde we mean the solutions of its characteristic polynomial on the top of that as pointed out by g boillat a donato and others any completely exceptional 2 nd order scalar pde must be of monge ampe re type proposition 1 2 3 8 a hyperbolic scalar 2 nd order pde is completely exceptional iff it is a hyperbolic monge ampe re equation the first aim of this paper is to provide a geometric notion of complete exceptionality given in terms of characteristics rank one lines and symbols more precisely the characterisation of completely excep tional pdes can be reduced to the characterisation of hyperplane sections in the lagrangian grassmannian lgr n 2 n for n 2 we show that the problem reduces to the characterisation of flat surfaces in a three dimensional conformal space known as the lie quadric whereas for n 3 one needs to study the analogues of flat five folds in a six dimensional space equipped with a trivalent conformal structure for an arbitrary number n of independent variables we focus on the function f instead of the equation e f 0 more precisely we provide a general method to detect whether a function f to which we associate the pde e f 0 gives rise to a completely exceptional equation such a method is purely representation theoretic being based on the homogeneous structure of lgr n 2 n and a corresponding bgg sequence indeed as a compact homogeneous space of the lie group sp n r the manifold lgr n 2 n is canonically embedded into a suitable projective space pm see remark 2 7 later on the reason why one must bring in the bgg operator is that is represents the most natural way to resolve the space of functions on lgr n 2 n which are the restrictions of the rth degree homogeneous polynomials on pm for r 1 one has hyperplane sections i e monge ampe re equations for r 1 one encounters new interesting classes of nonlinear pdes like e g the quadratic monge ampe re equations currently studied in 16 according to proposition 1 2 the complete exceptionality must be regarded as a form of linearity in the sense that such a linearity reveals itself only through the embedding of the lagrangian grassmannian into pm the last section of this paper points towards the existence of higher order analogues of complete exceptionality i e a property characterising quadratic cubic quartic etc monge ampe re equations the notions and the results herewith obtained can be generalised to the higher order case in the spirit of 4 15 but this will be the subject of a future work structure of the paper and main results section 2 merely puts together all the necessary geometric gadgets and can be safely skipped by anyone feeling confident enough in section 3 we explain the property of complete exceptionality of a 2 nd order pde first we go through the classical derivation and then we recast it in a more intrinsic geometric way in this new perspective theorem 4 1 of section 4 proposes a test to check whether a given pde is completely exceptional i e in view of proposition 1 2 a monge ampe re equation based on standard considerations of conformal geometry proposition 4 5 this test is then generalised to three valued conformal structures section 4 2 finally in section 5 we show that the functions whose zero loci correspond to a rth degree hypersurface of lgr n 2 n constitute the kernel of suitable natural differential operator arising in a purely representation theoretic approach to the problem theorem 5 9 obtaining the case of monge ampe re equations i e of hyperplane sections in the particular case r 1 notations and conventions for simplicity when x is a vector field and p is a distribution on the same manifold we write x p to mean that x is a smooth local section of tangent subbundle p we stress that when dealing with the classical notion of complete exceptionality we confine ourselves to the two dimensional context since the multidimensional case see 7 poses no extra conceptual difficulties with respect to the two dimensional one the only differences being formal 2 geometric background 2 1 prolongation of contact manifolds lagrangian grassmannians and 2 nd order nonlinear pdes the framework for pdes based on the prolongations of contact manifolds was implicitly made use of in the original cartan s works one of the earliest modern treatment of the subject was given by yamaguchi in 1982 23 for the present purposes we stick to the simplified setting and on the notation used in 2 for more details on the topics and extensive references the reader should consult the classical book 12 for the sake of self consistency the main ideas ad results are briefly recalled below 4 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno let m c be a 2 n 1 dimensional contact manifold i e a 2 n 1 dimensional manifold where c is a completely non integrable distribution of codimension 1 locally c is the kernel of a contact 1 form defined up to a conformal factor by darboux theorem there exists a system of coordinates xi u pi i 1 n which we call contact coordinates such that du pidxi the restriction d c defines on each hyperplane cm a conformal symplectic structure lagrangian i e maximally isotropic n dimensional planes of cm are tangent to maximal integral submanifolds of c we denote by lgr cm the grassmannian of lagrangian planes of cm and by 1 m 1 m m lgr cm m the bundle of lagrangian planes previous constructions lead naturally to consider a geometric object which will play an important role in our analysis namely the so called tautological bundle over m 1 2 l m 1 where the fibre lm 1 is m 1 m 1 itself understood as an n dimensional subspace of c m 1 contact coordinates on m induce coordinates on m 1 a point m 1 lm 1 m 1 has coordinates xi u pi pij 1 i j n iff the corresponding lagrangian plane lm 1 is given by m 1 lm 1 dxi i 1 n where 3 dxi def xi pi u pij pj and pij is a symmetric matrix a scalar 2 nd order pde with n independent variables and one unknown function is defined as a hypersurface e of m 1 and its solutions are lagrangian submanifolds m such that t e we assume that e projects onto m this means that the restriction e is a bundle over m whose fibre at m m is 4 em e lgr cm this eventually explains our perspective em is a hypersurface of the grassmannian lgr cm of lagrangian planes of c in what follows different yet equivalent symbols will be used for lgr cm either lgr n 2 n if we wish to detach the notion from the particular symplectic space cm or xn when we focus in the projective algebraic aspects of the space as in the last section 5 we conclude by recalling that the conformal symplectic group csp cm acts naturally and transitively on lgr cm which turns out to be a homogeneous manifold in particular the abstract fibre of m 1 can be described as the homogeneous space lgr n 2 n sp 2 n r p where p is the parabolic subgroup gln n s 2 rn 2 2 natural conformal structures on lagrangian grassmannians it is well known keeping in mind the definition of tautological bundle 2 that 5 tlgr cm s 2 l so that the rank of a vector in tlgr cm is defined as the rank of its correspondent symmetric bilinear form through the isomorphism 5 of course this definition is invariant under a conformal change of the symplectic form and proportional tangent vectors have the same rank so that this notion applies to directions in tlgr cm as well let t klgr n 2 n v tlgr n 2 n rank v k be the set of vectors of rank k thus we have a canonical distribution of cones on lgr n 2 n made from lines of non maximal rank there exists up to a conformal factor a unique symmetric n form tn on lgr n 2 n such that the aforementioned cones are its isotropic varieties the conformal class of tn can be represented by the total polarisation of the determinant det sn s 2 l which in turn spans the unique one dimensional irreducible gl n submodule of the kernel of the total symmetrization map 6 s sn s 2 l s 2 nl having defined a canonical conformal n tensor tn on lgr n 2 n we can define the following set of sym metric 2 tensors s 2 tn xn 2 ytn xn 2 n 2 tlgr n 2 n note that in the case n 2 x 0 yt 2 x 0 t 2 with x 0 c lgr n 2 n so that s 2 t 2 is the set of bilinear forms on lgr 2 4 that are conformal to t 2 completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 5 the image of the contraction map sn 2 s 2 l tn s 2 s 2 l determined by tn is precisely s 2 tn on the top of that the total symmetrization gives rise to the short exact sequence sn 2 s 2 l tn s 2 s 2 l s s 4 l 0 so that s 2 tn ker s easy computations shows that dims 2 tn n 2 n 2 1 12 1 6 20 50 for n 2 3 4 5 in other words lgr n 2 n tn is a genuine conformal manifold only for n 2 2 3 prolongation of subspaces and characteristics the prolongation u 1 lgr cm of a subspace u cm is defined as follows u 1 lm 1 lgr cm lm 1 u if dim u n lm 1 lgr cm lm 1 u if dim u n since l l one can easily check that u w u 1 w 1 and that u 1 u 1 definition 2 1 the set t 1 m 1 e tm 1 e t 1 m 1 lgr cm of rank one tangent vectors to e is called the rank one cone at m 1 of the hypersurface e proposition 2 2 vectors of t 1 m 1 e are up to sign the tensor squares of a covectors l m 1 such that understood as a vertical vector to m 1 is tangent to e definition 2 3 an isotropic subspace u is called characteristic for a covector t m 1 lgr n 2 n if u lm 1 and t m 1 u 1 0 it is called characteristic for a hypersurface f 0 of lgr n 2 n at a point m 1 of the hypersurface if it is characteristic for df m 1 a covector l m 1 is called characteristic for if ker is characteristic for characteristic directions and characteristic subspaces turn out to be in a tight relationship remark 2 4 any rank one vector v t 1 m 1 lgr n 2 n defines the hyperplane h ker of lm 1 which has the property that tm 1 h 1 v and viceversa note that h 1 is 1 dimensional thus we have the key correspondence between hyperplanes of lm 1 which correspond to elements of pl m 1 and rank one directions of tm 1 lgr n 2 n accordingly n 1 dimensional characteristic subspaces for a hypersurface e of lgr n 2 n at m 1 are in one to one correspondence with the characteristic directions for e at m 1 we focus now on the case n 2 which will be of key importance in the sequel fix a point m 1 m 1 and let m lm 1 be a direction in lm 1 i e an element of plm 1 and 7 m 1 span dx 1 dx 2 ker dx 1 dx 2 where dxi are defined by 3 proposition 2 5 the tangent line to 1 m where m is defined by 7 is given by tm 1 1 m span p 11 p 12 2 p 22 proof first describe 1 as the set of pij such that 1 0 01 0 p 11 p 12 0 1 p 12 p 22 is of rank 2 easy computations shows that this is the case if and only if 8 p 11 p 12 p 22 t t 2 t t r 6 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno 2 4 plu cker embedding an important feature of the lagrangian grassmannian lgr n 2 n is that it can be naturally embedded into a projective space by taking the volume of its elements viz lgr n 2 n p nr 2 n 9 l span l 1 ln 7 vol l l 1 ln by hyperplane sections of lgr n 2 n we mean the outcomes of the intersection of lgr n 2 n with a hyper plane of p nr 2 n via the above embedding that is called plu cker embedding it has the remarkable property of converting the curves u 1 where u l lgr n 2 n is a hyperplane into lines into its image example 2 6 let n 2 and consider the curve 1 lgr 2 4 given by the lagrangian planes see 8 l t t t t t 2 then vol l t 1 t t t 2 0 is precisely the line joining the points 1 0 0 0 0 and 0 1 2 0 remark 2 7 actually the target space p nr 2 n is oversized for there exists a proper subspace pm p nr 2 n characterised by the property of being the smallest one containing the image of the map 9 the existence of such a pm is a basic representation theoretic fact see section 5 later on it is worth observing that the notion of a hyperplane section stays unaltered 2 5 symbol of a function and its iterations let f c m 1 define the symbol smbl f of f as the map m 1 m 1 smbl f m 1 d f lgr cm m 1 t m 1 lgr cm t m 1 lgr n 2 n s 2 lm 1 by recalling the definition of tautological bundle 2 in short we can write smbl f s 2 l essentially the symbol of a function f c m 1 is its vertical differential with respect to the projection 1 we call the characteristic equation the quadratic polynomial associated to smbl f equated to zero i e 10 i j fuij i j 0 notice that dsmbl f m 1 tm 1 lgr n 2 n s 2 l m 1 tsmbl f m 1 s 2 lm 1 s 2 lm 1 i e the differential of smbl f takes values in s 2 l so that dsmbl f s 2 l s 2 l actually a direct computation shows that dsmbl f s 2 l s 2 l in contact coordinates dsmbl f i j h k fuijuhk dxi dxj dxh dxk i j h k 2 i j h k fuijuhk dxi dxj dxh dxk where dxi are defined by 3 and i j h k is equal to 1 if i j h k and 0 otherwise now we can define smbl 2 f s dsmbl f s 4 l as the projection of dsmbl f on s 4 l via 6 remark 2 8 according to the general definition one can obtain a coordinate description of smbl 2 f for f c m 1 first if 11 smbl f fp 11 2 fp 12 fp 22 2 then smbl 2 f smbl fp 11 2 smbl fp 12 smbl fp 22 2 turns out to be a degree four homogeneous polynomial on l iteratively we can define the kth order differential dk smbl f sk 1 s 2 l of the symbol smbl f of f and obtain the map smblk f s 2 k 2 l completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 7 3 complete exceptionality 3 1 the equation of completely exceptionality classical derivation concerning scalar pdes with 2 independent variables the roles of characteristic velocities are played by the roots 2 1 of the charac teristic equation 10 12 fp 11 fp 12 fp 22 2 0 the denomination characteristic velocity is somehow misleading since it is not the speed at which the wave front travels through the space of independent variables which would require an additional metric structure but rather the rate of change of the tangent direction to the characteristic lines within the tangent spaces even if this correct interpretation may seems dependent on the choice of a local coordinate system we shall prove later that it is in fact a truly intrinsic notion for the time being we stick to the classical understanding of the characteristic velocity as the slope of the characteristic line at each point of a given solution see fig below solution space of independent variables characteristic lines tangent space at x 1 2 arctan x so we can say that the function f determines the completely exceptional pde e f 0 if and only if 0 for any solution of the equation 12 restricted to e where following 9 17 20 0 0 is the operator measuring the jump of the value of a function f f x 1 x 2 through the curve x 1 x 2 0 here some considerations are in order if we want to compute the jump of a function f through the curve x 1 x 2 0 near a point p of such curve we can compute limt 0 f t limt 0 f t with t a curve in the x 1 x 2 space such that 0 p and 0 is transverse to x 1 x 2 0 as recalled in the introduction complete exceptionality is the property which prevents the discontinuity waves from evolving into shock waves mathematically this means that the worst kind of discontinuity which can take place is a jump one in turn this implies that the previous value is independent of the chosen curve and in particular we can consider an orthogonal curve at p in view of the above reasoning to compute pij it is enough to take into account the components of pij along a normal vector of x 1 x 2 0 for our convenience we put p 1 ux 1 p 2 ux 2 p 11 ux 1 x 1 and so on we need a change of coordinates 13 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 where x 1 0 x 2 0 describes the curve x 1 x 2 0 and x 1 0 x 2 0 is a curve orthogonal to x 1 x 2 0 at 0 0 we can always choose 13 in such a way that x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 x 2 a straightforward computation gives uxixj xi xj u thus getting the hadamard s relation see 4 ux 1 x 2 2 1 ux 1 x 1 ux 2 x 2 2 1 2 ux 1 x 1 so the complete exceptional condition 0 for satisfying 12 translates as follows 14 p 11 p 12 p 22 2 0 a direct computation shows that the condition 14 for a hyperbolic pde f p 22 h 0 where h h x 1 x 2 u p 1 p 2 p 11 p 12 is described by the following system of pdes 15 hp 11 p 11 hp 11 hp 12 p 12 0 2 hp 11 p 12 hp 12 hp 12 p 12 0 8 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno proposition 3 1 a hyperbolic pde e f 0 is completely exceptional definition 1 1 if and only if 14 is satisfied for all roots of 12 remark 3 2 for parabolic equations i e 2 nd order pde whose symbol is a perfect square condition 14 is always fulfilled in fact the discriminant of the equation 12 is f 2 p 12 4 fp 11 fp 22 and when it is zero in a neighborhood the only solution to 12 is 1 2 fp 12 fp 22 if we substitute this into 14 we obtain the equation p 22 fp 12 fp 22 p 12 f 2 p 22 fp 22 p 22 fp 12 fp 22 fp 12 p 22 0 that in this case is always satisfied as is zero remark 3 3 for the sake of completeness we also recall that the completely exceptional pdes form a sub class of another important family of pdes the so called temple class 1 21 3 2 complete exceptionality and monge ampe re invariants if 2 nd order pdes are understood as hypersurfaces in m 1 see 2 1 then the complete exceptional ones form a cont m invariant sub class where cont m is the set of the contactmorphisms of m in particular fibre by fibre such pdes must correspond to csp 4 invariant hypersurfaces in the three dimensional lagrangian grassmannian lgr 2 4 known also as the lie quadric q 3 11 recall that we set n 2 the theory of surfaces in q 3 is thoroughly described e g in d the s paper 22 so that the obvious question arise how completely exceptional pdes fit into the classification of surfaces in q 3 the answer provided in this section is that for hyperbolic pdes the two equations 14 one for each root of the symbol correspond precisely to the vanishing of the monge ampe re invariants i 1 and i 2 see the above cited paper fig 1 incidentally this provides a geometric proof to proposition 1 2 recalling see 2 3 that to any point m 1 of a pde e m 1 one can associate two rank one directions in tm 1 e or better to say in its vertical part to which correspond two directions in cm recall again that n 2 thus we have two sections 16 m 1 e 7 im 1 plm 1 i 1 2 of the projective line bundle 17 pl e which is nothing but the projectivised tautological bundle restricted to e the point i m 1 plm 1 determines the rank one curve im 1 1 em whose tangent direction is im 1 tm 1 i m 1 1 if i m 1 i m 1 1 then see also proposition 2 5 18 im 1 p 11 i m 1 p 12 i m 1 2 p 2 proposition 3 4 the derivative of the direction 18 along any curve passing through the point m 1 with tangent space i m 1 is zero if and only if 14 is satisfied in m 1 proof if m 1 t denotes the point moving along the curve then i m 1 t defined as in 16 is a point in plm 1 t so in principle the curve r 3 t 7 im 1 t plm 1 t takes values in different spaces nevertheless for small values of t each lm 1 t can be identified with lm 1 by means of the projection of cm lm 1 vm onto lm 1 where vm span p 1 p 2 is the vertical subspace 3 since i m 1 t i m 1 t 1 in the basis of lm 1 t the projected line into lm 1 will have the same components i m 1 t 1 but now in the basis of lm 1 in other words the curve im 1 t can be regarded as the curve r 3 t 7 i m 1 t 1 plm 1 in turn the latter is equivalent to the curve r 3 t 7 i m 1 t r whose velocity at zero is precisely the left hand side of 14 now we are ready to recast proposition 1 2 in a purely geometric perspective corollary 3 5 a hyperbolic 2 nd order pde e is completely exceptional if and only if it is doubly ruled 3 observe that the theorem does not suffer from the choice of vm indeed upon a different choice of vm the vector 1 is replaced by an its linear image and the vanishing of its derivative give the same condition on completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 9 proof first of all observe that a hyperbolic 2 nd order pde e is equipped with two distinct rank one distributions to which there are associated two distinct sections 1 and 2 of 17 if e is completely exceptional then the curves i m 1 1 are precisely the integral curves of the aforemen tioned rank one distributions since via plu cker embedding see 9 these i m 1 1 are lines the surface e turns out to be doubly ruled see also example 2 6 conversely if e is doubly ruled then e is described by two transversal families of curves i m 1 1 i 1 2 let us fix i and consider at each point m 1 e the curve i i m 1 1 whose coordinate representation is 8 since the section m 1 i m 1 is constant along i its derivative is zero and hence recalling proposition 3 1 in view of proposition 3 4 e is completely exceptional 3 3 geometric formulation of complete exceptionality the symbolic way proposition 3 4 gives a geometric meaning to the local formula 14 i e to complete exceptional hyperbolic pdes it claims that the roots of the polynomial 12 have zero acceleration along the rank one directions determined see section 2 3 by the roots themselves nevertheless it cannot be denied that hyperplane sections i e monge ampe re equations exist also in the realm of non hyperbolic equations consequently there must be a natural way to extend the test of complete exceptionality to non hyperbolic equations the purpose of this section is to show that such an extension does exist and it allows to characterise monge ampe re equations in general the bottom line is simple the zero acceleration condition for the roots of the characteristic polynomial 12 used in proposition 3 4 can be actually formulated without solving the polynomial itself proposition 3 6 let e m 1 be a hyperbolic scalar second order pde then e is completely exceptional iff e f 0 for some f c m 1 such that smbl 2 f is proportional to smbl f proof let i i 1 be the roots of smbl f this means that 19 smbl f 2 1 2 1 2 then by remark 2 8 one has smbl 2 f 2 1 p 11 1 2 p 11 2 1 p 12 1 2 p 12 1 p 11 2 p 11 20 2 1 p 22 1 2 p 22 1 p 12 2 p 12 2 1 p 22 2 p 22 3 now smbl 2 f is proportional to smbl f if and only if an element k h s 2 l exists such that 21 smbl 2 f smbl f k h since 21 is a polynomial identity of degree 3 in it gives 4 linear equations in h k straightforward computations show that this system is compatible if and only if the two equations obtained by replacing with i in 14 are satisfied corollary 3 7 the equation e is a monge ampe re equation if and only if for some f such that e f 0 smbl 2 f is proportional to smbl f proof if e is hyperbolic the result immediately follows from propositions 1 2 and 3 6 for a general e one must rely on the original direct integration method 4 of boillat 3 now we can recast 14 in an intrinsic geometric way not requiring the actual existence of the roots of the characteristic polynomial corollary 3 8 let us consider a local trivilization of line bundle 17 so that w r t this trivialization each i see 16 can be seen as a function on e then hypersurface e is completely exceptional iff 22 smbl i t i 1 0 i 1 2 proof let 1 be either 1 or 2 and just recall see proposition 2 5 that t 1 is spanned by p 11 p 12 2 p 22 since locally one can compute the symbol of the function as in 11 viz 23 smbl p 11 2 p 12 p 22 2 and pair it with t 1 hence condition 22 coincides with 14 4 this method amounts at integrating 15 without the hyperbolicity condition 10 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno 4 conformal geometry of 2 d and 3 d completely

vector t p by 24 iig v w g vn w g xy n p v w tp where x y and n are respectively local extension to m of v w and some consideration of definition 24 is in order note that if is a semi riemannian hypersurface then tpm tp t p p here we use definition 24 also when is not a semi riemannian hypersurface i e when t p tp since in our reasonings the orthogonal vector does not play an essential role we will often use the symbol ii g to denote the second fundamental form of let us denote by symmax tn the set of infinitesimal conformal symmetries of the tensor tn of maximal rank if n 2 then we put symmax t 2 c lgr 2 4 note that if x is a vector fiend on lgr 3 6 of maximal rank then xyt 3 is a non degenerate symmetric 2 tensor we recall that for hyperplane sections of lgr n 2 n we mean hyperplane sections of lgr n 2 n via the plu cker embedding 9 theorem 4 1 let be a hypersurface of lgr n 2 n 2 n 3 and xn 2 symmax tn then the condition 25 ii xn 2 ytn s 2 tn is independent of xn 2 furthermore satisfies condition 25 iff it is a hyperplane section corollary 4 2 let be a semi riemannian hypersurface of lgr 2 4 t 2 the following statements are equivalent 1 is a hyperplane section 2 iit 2 is proportional to i t 2 3 the trace free part of second fundamental form of is zero in the next sections 4 1 and 4 2 we prove theorem 4 1 and corollary 4 2 in the case n 2 and n 3 respectively 4 1 hyperplane sections of lgr 2 4 since on lgr 2 4 there exists a canonical conformal semi riemannian metric t 2 before proving theorem 4 1 and corollary 4 2 we will see how the main object we use transforms under a conformal changing of t 2 let m g be a semi riemannian manifold let g e 2 g where c m let g be the levi civita connection of the metric g then 26 g xy g xy x y where tm tm tm is a

consider the trace free part iig 0 of the second fundamental form of 32 iig 0 ii g 1 n 1 h g where h g ijii ij is the mean curvature vector remark 4 4 iig 0 is conformally invariant whereas the 1 1 tensor g ikiig 0 kj is invariant up to conformal transformations note that the zero set of both iig and ii g 0 of are independent of the normal field as for iig in our reasonings the orthogonal vector in ii g 0 does not play an essential role as we are mainly interested in the zero set of iig 0 so we will often use the symbol ii g 0 to denote the trace free part of the second fundamental form of next propositions prove theorem 4 1 and corollary 4 2 in the case n 2 proposition 4 5 a hypersurface of lgr 2 4 t 2 is a hyperplane section of lgr 2 4 if and only if ii t 2 is proportional to it 2 furthermore if is a semi riemannian hypersurface of lgr 2 4 t 2 then it is a hyperplane section if and only if iit 2 0 0 proof without loss of generality we suppose that is locally described by f p 22 h p 11 p 12 0 so that t 1 0 hp 11 0 1 hp 12 the second fundamental form ii t 2 is proportional to the first fundamental form it 2 here we do not assume that i t 2 is necessarily non degenerate if and only if system 15 is satisfied we recall that here h h p 11 p 12 as we already seen this system can be explicitly solved its general solution h gives a monge ampe re equation f p 22 h 0 3 6 let now assume that is semi riemannian so that the determinant of the first fundamental form it 2 6 0 is not zero i e 4 hp 11 h 2 p 12 6 0 the condition iit 2 0 0 gives the following system of three equations 33 2 hp 11 p 11 hp 11 hp 11 p 11 h 2 p 12 2 hp 11 hp 12 hp 11 p 12 2 h 2 p 11 hp 12 p 12 0 4 hp 11 p 12 hp 11 hp 12 hp 11 p 11 hp 12 hp 11 hp 12 p 12 0 2 hp 11 hp 12 p 12 hp 12 p 12 h 2 p 12 2 hp 11 p 11 2 hp 12 hp 11 p 12 0 if hp 11 0 then the first two equations of 33 are identically satisfied whereas the third one gives hp 12 p 12 0 so that h k 1 p 12 k 2 the same reasoning holds if hp 12 0 so that in the remaining part of the proof we suppose 34 hp 11 6 0 hp 12 6 0 system 33 is equivalent to 15 in fact if we denote by eq 1 and eq 2 respectively the first and the second left hand side term of system 15 then system 33 reads as follows 35 2 hp 11 h 2 p 12 eq 1 hp 11 hp 12 eq 2 0 hp 12 eq 1 2 hp 11 eq 2 0 2 eq 1 hp 12 eq 2 0 the solution of this system is eq 1 eq 2 0 if and only if hp 11 hp 12 4 hp 11 h 2 p 12 6 0 this inequality is satisfied as we are supposing 34 and that is a semi riemannian hypersurface proposition 4 6 let be a hyperplane section of lgr 2 4 then it corresponds to a hyperbolic resp elliptic parabolic monge ampe re equation iff det it 2 0 resp det i t 2 0 det i t 2 0 proof we recall that a monge ampe re equation k 0 p 11 p 22 p 212 k 1 p 11 k 2 p 12 k 3 p 22 k 4 0 is hyperbolic resp elliptic parabolic iff its discriminant k 22 4 k 1 k 3 4 k 0 k 4 12 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno is greater than resp less than equal to zero by using the notation of proposition 4 5 we have that det it 2 1 4 k 3 k 0 p 11 2 and the proposition follows 4 2 hyperplane sections of lgr 3 6 infinitesimal conformal symmetries of t 3 form a 21 dimensional lie algebra which by dimensional reasons must coincide with sp 6 below we write a list of generators i i 1 2 j m 1 2 k n 2 i 1 i j 2 i k 3 2 j 4 j k 5 2 k 6 1 2 1 1 2 22 1 4 2 1 2 2 3 1 5 3 4 2 4 1 2 5 2 3 4 5 3 5 6 1 3 1 1 2 2 3 1 5 2 1 2 23 1 6 3 5 2 4 1 2 3 5 2 6 5 6 3 6 2 3 1 1 2 5 2 3 4 2 1 2 3 5 2 6 3 4 5 4 1 2 25 4 6 5 6 5 6 i j k m n 1 2 3 2 4 5 3 5 6 where we used the notation 1 2 6 p 11 p 12 p 33 we note that the above generators are all of non maximal rank nevertheless the stretching i j pij pij which can be obtained as a particular linear combination with constant coefficients of the above vector fields is of maximal rank a straightforward computation based also on the usage of a maple symbolic computation package shows that condition 25 for n 3 is independent of the chosen infinitesimal symmetry of maximal rank if e f 0 condition 25 is described by fpijphk i j h k g ijfphk i j h k for some g ij which means precisely that the symmetric derivative of the symbol is proportional to the symbol itself the result thus follows 5 from corollary 3 7 5 higher degree hypersurface sections of lgr n 2 n the main result of section 4 above is theorem 4 1 it allows to decide when a hypersurface in the lagrangian grassmannian xn lgr n 2 n is a hyperplane section by using tensors naturally associated with doing so theorem 4 1 revealed the intrinsic character of complete exceptionality and this is its main strength the drawback is that theorem 4 1 has been proved only for n 2 3 and it still has to be extended to the case of higher degree sections in this section we embrace an extrinsic perspective which will lead us to characterise certain distinguished functions on xn cutting out r th degree hypersurface sections of xn for arbitrary values of n and r to this end we shall exploit the natural action of the symplectic group sp 2 n on xn and we shall find a natural differential operator between certain bundles over xn such that the zero loci of the sections in its kernel are precisely the regular intersections with rth degree hypersurfaces in the ambient projective space pm the main result of this section theorem 5 9 is thus more general than theorem 4 1 since it is valid for all dimensions n and degrees r but at the same time it is less direct rather than characterising a hypersurface xn in intrinsic terms it only characterises certain distinguished functions cutting out needless to say theorem 4 1 and theorem 5 9 match on their common overlapping in section 5 8 we show how to obtain from theorem 5 9 an intrinsic necessary condition for complete exceptionality which expectedly turns out to be also sufficient in the cases n 2 3 covered by theorem 4 1 the reader already familiar with the bgg techniques can safely jump to the main result theorem 5 9 by skipping the subsections 5 1 5 6 whose purpose is that of providing a minimal self consistent background on the subject for the non experts apparently there is no alternative way to prove the main theorem 5 9 other than the bgg resolution in spite of the simple formulation of the theorem itself following the proof of theorem 5 9 there are two concluding sections in section 5 9 we recall that xn is rational and use this fact to obtain a simple confirmation of the fact that the functions cutting out completely exceptional pdes are suitable pull backs of the linear functions on pm in section 5 10 we show that the rth jet space of hypersurfaces of xn is foliated by canonical equations each of which is noncanonically equivalent to the equation of generalised complete exceptionality thus confirming the natural character of this property 5 recall that corollary 3 7 was formulated in the hypothesis n 2 though its validity is general see boillat 3 completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 13 5 1 the homogeneous structure of lagrangian grassmannian and its minimal projective em bedding our point of departure is the fact that xn is a homogeneous space for sp 2 n in order to make it explicit we identify xn with the grassmannian of n dimensional lagrangian subspaces of rn rn where the latter space carries the tautological symplectic structure defined by rn 0 v v for all v rn and rn and rn 0 the group sp 2 n is precisely the automorphism group of thus obviously acting on xn we fix an origin in xn corresponding to the isotropic subspace rn and we let p sp 2 n be its stabiliser the group p is a semi direct product p glnns 2 rn its levi factor gln is the subgroup of sp 2 n preserving the direct sum decomposition in rn rn i e stabilising the complementary rn in addition to rn the unipotent radical s 2 rn is abelian and maps rn into rn in the essentially unique gln equivariant manner in the following discussion we shall often work with representations of both sp 2 n and the subgroup gln in particular an irreducible representation of sp 2 n will often be decomposed into gln irreducible summands the plu cker embedding introduced in section 2 4 is sp 2 n equivariant and realises xn as a subvariety in the projectivisation of the space of n forms on rn rn orthogonal to i e precisely the space pm introduced in remark 2 7 this latter space temporarily denoted w is the sp 2 n irreducible summand of n rn rn containing the one dimensional subspace detrn we then embed xn pw identifying the lagrangian grassmannian with the sp 2 n orbit of the point corresponding to detrn now given a non zero element f srw for some r 0 we may intersect xn with the zero locus of f the resulting subset xn consists of points corresponding to one dimensional subspaces of w on which f restricts to zero in general it may happen that is all of xn i e xn is contained in the zero locus of f as we shall see later one only needs to consider the sp 2 n irreducible summand of s rw containing the image of w under the rth power map 5 2 the idea of the bgg resolution of the space of rth degree sections before proceeding to the more technical part of this section let us for a moment pretend that the elements of srw give rise to actual functions on xn rather than sections of a line bundle for instance intersect with a standard affine open in pw and trivialise we would then obtain a finite dimensional subspace f c xn with the property that rth degree hypersurface sections of xn are precisely the zero loci of non trivial elements of f how does one decide whether a given smooth function f c xn belongs to f though solving for a linear combination of some basis functions is certainly not a viable method instead one seeks to identify f as the kernel of a differential operator the basic example is the identification of constant functions with the kernel of the exterior derivative d c xn 1 xn while trivial from the point of view of our problem it fits into an important object the de rham resolution of the locally constant sheaf 0 r 0 1 by differential operators it turns out that our problem of characterising f as the kernel of a differential operator finds its place and solution in an analogous resolution the latter known as the bgg resolution or rather its generalised version due to lepowsky resolves a finite dimensional irreducible representation of sp 2 n by a sequence of equivariant differential operators between certain natural vector bundles on xn its first map is a differential operator acting on sections of the line bundle oxn r the rth power of the dual of the tautological line bundle of pw restricted to xn the kernel of this operator consists precisely of restrictions to xn of elements of s rw which cut out rth degree hypersurface sections of xn 5 3 representation theoretic preliminaries in order to define the bundles and operators involved we need to set up some rudimentary representation theoretic notation passing to the level of lie algebras we have the inclusions gln pn sp 2 n and pn gln s 2 rn semidirect sum in fact pn admits a gln invariant complement thus giving rise to a gln equivariant decomposition 36 sp 2 n s 2 rn gln s 2 rn where the extremal summands are abelian and their commutator lies in the middle one recall that being a split real form of a simple lie algebra sp 2 n contains a unique up to conjugacy split cartan subalgebra that is a maximal abelian self normalising subalgebra h such that sp 2 n decomposes as a direct sum of h and finitely many one dimensional h invariant subspaces labelled by distinct elements of h these one dimensional summands are the root subspaces an element h h acts on a root subspace labelled by h as the scalar h r the subset of h consisting of these labels is the root system and its elements are the roots to each root one associates the coroot h h acting as 2 on the root subspaces labelled by and together with these spanning a sub algebra isomorphic to sl 2 14 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno now this decomposition of the adjoint representation extends to an arbitrary finite dimensional represen tation of sp 2 n namely a finite dimensional representation decomposes under the action of h into a direct sum of invariant subspaces labelled by distinct elements of h this time called weights an element h h acts on a weight subspace with weight h as the scalar h r thus roots are simply the weights of the adjoint representation the root system is invariant under reflection about the origin 0 h one may choose a hyperplane in h such that half of the roots lie in one of the resulting half spaces and declare these as the positive roots given such choice one says that a non zero element of a given representation of sp 2 n is a highest weight vector if it is annihilated by all elements of sp 2 n lying in root subspaces labelled by positive roots in case of an irreducible finite dimensional representation a highest weight vector is indeed a weight vector i e an element of a weight subspace and the weight that labels it is called the highest weight then the highest weight is unique with a one dimensional weight subspace and characterises the irreducible representation up to isomorphism an element h is the highest weight of an irreducible finite dimensional representation if and only if h is a non negative integer for each positive root such weights are called dominant integral in our case we will choose the cartan subalgebra h to consist of the diagonal matrices in gln sp 2 n then each summand in 36 decomposes into a direct sum of root subspaces plus h in gln we choose the positive roots so that they label root subspaces spanning s 2 rn plus the space of upper triangular matrices in gln now given a dominant integral weight we have the irreducible representation v with highest weight we choose a highest weight vector v v unique up to scale restricting v to the reductive subalgebra gln gives rise to a decomposition into gln irreducibles the unique one containing v will be denoted l finally we note that since h is also a cartan subalgebra for gln we may use the elements of h to label irreducible finite dimensional representations of gln some of these are the l v as described above but one may also make sense of l for gln that is dominant integral for gln but not for sp 2 n here we consider the root system of gln as a subsystem of the root system of sp 2 n with a compatible choice of positive roots whence the condition on h is imposed only for a subset of positive roots 5 4 tautological bundle and its powers as associated bundles we are now ready to describe the plu cker embedding xn pw in our newly set up notation first w is an irreducible representation of sp 2 n so we may write w v for some dominant integral weight we shall from now on fix to denote this particular weight then an inspection of the action of s 2 rn on w shows that the elements of detrn are the highest weight vectors accordingly xn sp 2 n p is the orbit of the highest weight line v in pv but since gln acts on detrn we actually have v l now given g sp 2 n we may view gl v as the fibre of the tautological line bundle at gp xn the action sp 2 n l v thus allows us to identify the tautological line bundle over xn with the associated vector bundle l sp 2 n p l where s 2 rn p acts on l trivially by definition we may in fact apply this construction for any integral dominant weight first extend the gln irreducible representation l to a representation of p with a trivial action of s 2 rn then form the associated bundle l note that the sp 2 n action on xn lifts to the total space of l and thus turns its space of global sections in to a representation but keep in mind our main goal we are interested in rth degree hypersurface sections of xn and thus in elements of srv the symmetric power s rv is in general not irreducible there is however a unique irreducible summand containing vr and as such necessarily isomorphic to vr furthermore there is no other summand with the same highest weight accordingly the dual srv contains a unique irreducible summand isomorphic to v r once again the line spanned by v r is actually gln invariant so that lr v r l r observe that evaluating an element f srv on the tautological bundle of xn gives rise to a global section of srl l r by the associated bundle construction the latter may be identified with a p equivariant map sp 2 n l r we may then conveniently state the following lemma 5 1 there is a commutative diagram of sp 2 n equivariant maps srv pr xn l r v r c sp 2 n l r p completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 15 where the top horizontal arrow is the evaluation map while the bottom one is adjoint to the action map sp 2 n lr vr the proof is a left as a simple yet instructive exercise for the reader note that we do in particular find that the remaining irreducible summands in srv consist of r th degree homogeneous polynomials vanishing identically on xn hence the actual r th degree hypersurface sections of xn are precisely the zero loci of non zero elements in the image of v r xn l r our task is thus to express this image as the kernel of a differential operator the bgg machinery will do this as a first step in the resolution of v r by equivariant differential operators between natural vector bundles of the form l the easiest way to introduce it is in a dual picture to which we shall now pass 5 5 the dual picture via verma modules recall how passing from l to xn l produced a rep resentation of sp 2 n from a representation of gln there is a dual algebraic variant of this construction producing a representation of sp 2 n we will use u to denote the universal enveloping algebra functor from lie algebras to associative algebras over r it is customary to speak of u sp 2 n modules rather than representations of sp 2 n these are equivalent given a weight dominant integral for gln we view l as a u p module with a trivial action of s 2 rn then we form the so called verma module u sp 2 n u p l with highest weight which is a u sp 2 n module by left action on the first factor the induced structure of a u p module coincides with the natural one on each factor and in fact integrates to a representation of p this allows us to form an associated bundle and leads to a geometric interpretation proposition 5 2 there is a natural sp 2 n equivariant identification 37 sp 2 n p u sp 2 n u p l j l with the bundle of infinite jets of sections of l over xn sketch of a proof the basic ingredients of the proof are 1 identify sections of an associated bundle with p equivariant maps from sp 2 n 2 represent sp 2 n as vector fields on sp 2 n 3 represent u sp 2 n as differential operators on sp 2 n we thus see that verma modules are in a suitable sense dual to infinite jet bundles 6 recalling the relation between jets and differential operators we further identify homomorphisms of verma modules with equivariant differential operators corollary 5 3 let h be a pair of dominant integral weights for gln there is a natural isomorphism hom u sp 2 n u sp 2 n u p l u sp 2 n u p l diff l l sp 2 n between the space of u sp 2 n module homomorphisms on the left hand side and the space of sp 2 n equivariant differential operators on the right hand side proof a differential operator d from l to l is a vector bundle map j l l factoring through some finite jet bundle an inspection of the identification of proposition 5 2 shows that the cofiltration on j l induced by finite jet projections j l j l coincides with the cofiltration on the left hand side of 37 induced by the standard filtration u sp 2 n on the universal enveloping algebra hence the operator d is the same as a p equivariant function on sp 2 n with values in hom r l u sp 2 n u p l it is sp 2 n equivariant if and only if the function is constant and its value is a u p module homomorphism l u sp 2 n u p l equivalently by the universal property of u an equivariant operator d is the same as a u sp 2 n module homomorphism of the verma modules associated with l and l before we use this result to look for a differential operator resolving v r let us pin point one last element the dual algebraic manifestation of the evaluation map lemma 5 4 let u sp 2 n u p lr vr be the unique u sp 2 n module homomorphism extending the natural u gln module inclusion lr vr then 1 is surjective and 2 there is a sp 2 n equivariant 6 since u sp 2 n u p l is not just a representation of p but also of sp 2 n the left invariant maurer cartan form on sp 2 n induces a flat connection on the associated vector bundle the canonical flat connection on the bundle of infinite jets 16 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno commutative diagram 38 sp 2 n p v r sp 2 n p u sp 2 n u p lr xn v r j l r where the left vertical arrow is induced by the action map the right vertical arrow is the isomorphism 37 of lemma 5 2 and the bottom horizontal arrow is induced by the evaluation map v r xn l r proof surjectivity of follows from irreducibility of vr commutativity of the diagram is checked using lemma 5 1 and an inspection of the identification 37 of proposition 5 2 5 6 the resolution of the module v r proposition 5 5 the identification of corollary 5 3 sends u sp 2 n module homomorphisms such that 0 vr u sp 2 n u p lr u sp 2 n u p l is exact to equivariant differential operators d such that 0 v r u l r d u l is exact for each nonempty connected open u xn proof by lemma 5 4 the isomorphism 37 descends to sp 2 n p ker coker xn v r j l r where we use exactness properties of the associated bundle functor it follows that exactness of the sequence involving is equivalent to exactness of 0 xn v r j l r d j l where d is the vector bundle map induced by the differential operator d hence we only need to show that vr is the kernel of d on the level of local sections if it is so on the level of formal sections clearly in both cases vr is contained in the kernel now assuming v r is the entire kernel of d on j x l r for all x xn let u xn be a nonempty connected open subset and consider f u l r such that df 0 we have that j x f is in the image of v r for all x u thus defining a map v u v r such that j x f j x vx where vx v r is understood as a section of l r the map v is furthermore locally constant and thus constant by connectedness of u letting v v r denote its value we have j x f j x v for all x u and thus f v u we shall now invoke the first actually easy step of the bgg resolution of lr proposition 5 6 let h be the highest weight of the u gln module s 2 rn sp 2 n p there is an exact sequence 0 vr u sp 2 n u p lr u sp 2 n u p lr r 1 of u sp 2 n module homomorphisms proof see j lepowsky a generalization of the bgg resolution 1977 14 5 7 on the structure of the resolving operator by proposition 5 5 we know that the image of v r is the kernel of some differential operator from l r to l r r 1 but what is this operator and how should we think of the target bundle a good answer to the latter question is the following lemma 5 7 there is an sp 2 n equivariant identification of l r r 1 with a direct summand of s r 1 t xn proof note first that since lr is one dimensional and is the highest weight vector of s 2 rn lr r 1 may be identified with the highest weight summand s 2 r 1 rn sr 1 s 2 rn as a u gln module with the trivial action of s 2 rn this extends to an identification of u p modules where s 2 rn is more naturally viewed as sp 2 n p we thus have that the associated bundle l r r 1 is a direct summand of the associated bundle sp 2 n p sr 1 sp 2 n p sr 1 t xn let us now proceed as before and decompose the modules into gln irreducibles note first that the u sp 2 n module homomorphism of proposition 5 6 is uniquely determined by its restriction to lr r 1 a u p module homomorphism lr r 1 u sp 2 n u p lr on the domain side side of we have already seen that lr r 1 s 2 r 1 rn lr where s 2 r 1 rn is the highest weight irreducible summand in sr 1 s 2 rn on the codomain side 39 u sp 2 n u p l s s 2 rn r l completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 17 for any verma module it follows that induces a u gln module homomorphism s 2 r 1 rn lr s s 2 rn lr now the domain is gln irreducible and furthermore appears precisely once as an irreducible summand in the codomain hence is necessarily given by the gln equivariant inclusion in particular it factors through sr 1 s 2 rn lr thus showing that the corresponding differential operator is of order r 1 as a final step we shall make it even more explicit by working in an adapted coordinate system indeed note that s 2 rn sp 2 n is an abelian subalgebra acting nilpotently in the adjoint representation and thus exponentiates to a subgroup s 2 rn sp 2 n with vector addition as the group operation since its lie algebra is a complement of p it follows that the subgroup s 2 rn embeds as a dense open subset of xn sp 2 n p moreover its inclusion map into sp 2 n may be then viewed as a local section of the p principal bundle sp 2 n xn this allows us to trivialise all associated bundles l s 2 rn s 2 rn l so that a map l l induced by a p equivariant map l l identifies upon restriction to s 2 rn xn with ids 2 rn now the symmetry group sp 2 n is broken 7 to s 2 rn o gln where the factor s 2 rn acts on s 2 rn xn by translations this action is compatible with the trivialisations gln acting naturally on the l factor the isomorphism of proposition 5 2 becomes the usual isomorphism 40 s 2 rn s s 2 rn l j s 2 rn r l induced by the canonical affine connection on s 2 rn lemma 5 8 let u sp 2 n u p l u sp 2 n u p l be a u sp 2 n module homomorphism and denote by i i l si s 2 rn r l its restriction to a u gln homomorphism then restricting to s 2 rn xn and using the standard trivial isations the differential operator corresponding to is the translation invariant gln equivariant operator f c s 2 rn l c s 2 rn l defined by ff h i i h i f where f c s 2 rn l h l and i f c s 2 rn si s 2 rn l is the tensor of ith derivatives proof the key point is the commutative diagram sp 2 n p u sp 2 n u p l j l s 2 rn o gln gln s s 2 rn l oo j l s 2 rn oo s 2 rn s s 2 rn l j s 2 rn r l where the top horizontal arrow is 37 the bottom horizontal arrow is 40 the top left vertical arrow is induced by 39 the bottom left vertical arrow is induced the trivialising local section xn s 2 rn sp 2 n the top right vertical arrow is the restriction map and the bottom right vertical arrow is induced by the local trivialisation l s 2 rn s 2 rn l the inverse of the bottom horizontal arrow is induced by the map j s 2 rn r i 0 i s 2 rn s s 2 rn tensored with idl whence the desired formula follows now we are in position of proving the main result of this section theorem 5 9 identify s 2 rn with a dense open subset of xn let i c s 2 rn c s 2 rn si s 2 rn denote the ith partial derivatives map induced by the canonical affine connection on s 2 rn then rth degree 7 not to be confused with p gln n s 2 rn 18 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno hypersurface sections of xn pv passing through s 2 rn are precisely the zero loci of non trivial functions in the kernel of the differential operator c s 2 rn r 1 c s 2 rn sr 1 s 2 rn pr c s 2 rn s 2 r 1 rn proof using lemma 5 8 one only needs to choose an identification lr r as one dimensional vector spaces a little bit more can be said about the functions on s 2 rn in the kernel of pr r 1 a simple computation with weights shows that the restriction of u sp 2 n u p lr vr to s s 2 rn lr is surjective if and only if nr furthermore s s 2 rn lr is contained in ker for all nr dualising these statements one sees that the solutions of pr r 1 are polynomials of degree at most nr and that this bound is saturated observe that for fixed r 0 the degree of solutions grows linearly with the dimension n while the order of the differential operator is constant 5 8 tensorial obstructions to complete exceptionality in general we do not know an explicit intrinsic characterisation of rth degree hypersurface sections as submanifolds in the same spirit as theorem 4 1 however for r 1 i e hyperplane sections and any n 2 we may at least construct a tensorial obstruction namely let xn be a codimension 1 submanifold and write f l for the sub module of sections of l vanishing to 1 st order along recall that f 1 f 2 is naturally identified with the module n l of global sections of the twisted conormal bundle we then have a commutative diagram f 1 f 3 s 2 t xn l f 1 f 2 s 2 t l where the top horizontal arrow is induced by our differential operator l s 2 t xn l while the right vertical arrow is the pullback map along s 2 rn one checks e g using theorem 5 9 that the bottom horizontal arrow is c linear thus corresponding to a tensor s 2 t n whose vanishing is a necessary condition for to be a hyperplane section for n 2 one may identify with the trace free second fundamental form of with respect to the invariant conformal structure on x 2 thus in the notation of theorem 4 1 vanishing of is equivalent to the condition ii t 2 s 2 t 2 over the dense open s 2 r 2 x 2 where t 2 is well defined as an actual metric tensor for n 3 again over s 2 r 3 x 3 one may identify with ii xyt 3 modulo s 2 t 3 for any translation vector field x s 2 r 2 of maximal rank indeed the tensor t 3 may be chosen constant with respect to the affine connection on s 2 r 2 whence is the levi civita connection for xyt 3 then by theorem 4 1 vanishing of is again equivalent to the condition iixy t 3 s 2 t 3 for any x symmax t 3 hence for n 2 3 we conclude that vanishing of is also a sufficient condition for to be a hyperplane section 5 9 the lagrangian grassmannian as a rational projective variety observe that xn has the same dimension as pw 0 where w 0 r s 2 rn is a gln submodule of v let us denote by w 1 the sum of the remaining irreducible pieces of v theorem 5 10 the natural projection pv pw 0 restricts to a birational map 41 xn pw 0 proof it will be carried out by constructing an explicit inverse for 41 to this end we must observe that any bilinear form s 2 rn can be extended naturally to a bilinear form on krn and that such an extension say k belongs in fact to s 20 krn the desired inverse is then given by the rational map pw 0 p p w 0 w 1 pv 42 7 n n 1 n 2 2 n whose image lies in xn completely exceptional 2 nd order pdes via conformal geometry and bgg resolution 19 remark 5 11 by restricting 42 to the affine neighborhood s 2 rn 1 pw 0 one gets precisely the special affine neighborhood u xn defined earlier corollary 5 12 the lagrangian grassmannian is rational the map p pw 0 pv defined as in 42 is of degree n and as such it factors through the veronese map i e p h vn where vn is the veronese map and h is linear viz pw 0 vn psnw 0 h pv dually opv r h opw 0 nr and by taking sections over u 43 opv r u h snrs 2 rn in other words the lagrangian grassmannian xn is covered by the veronese variety vn pn through a linear projection h theorem 5 13 the image of the morphism h in 43 is made precisely by the polynomials of degree n on u which corresponds to degree r hypersurface sections moreover 43 becomes an exact sequence if the total symmetrisation snrs 2 rn s 2 nrrn is appendend proof follows from theorem 5 9 5 10 canonical equations on xn it should be clear that the main results obtained so far namely the orem 4 1 theorem 5 9 and theorem 5 13 have something in common they all allow to recognise special hypersurfaces in xn by manipulating the natural structures associated with xn the natural place for study ing the differential invariants of the hypersurfaces in xn is the jet space j r jr xn dn 1 where r is the order of the invariant i e hyperplane sections will be characterised by the vanishing of a first order invariant and dn dimxn n n 1 2 theorem 5 14 jr is equipped with a canonical vertical distribution e which is tangent to the equation of degree r hyperplane sections proof we just deal with the case r 1 since the general one is formally analogous recall the canonical identifications j 1 pt xn p s 2 lgr and that the contact plane on j 1 is given by c q ker q t q ps 2 l s 2 l t q ps 2 l t q j 1 where l xn is the projection of q j 1 but t q ps 2 l ker q s 2 l ker q ker q so that c q ker q ker q is the canonical symplectic 2 n 1 dimensional space rn 1 rn 1 according the fibre j 2 q of the projection j 2 j 1 is given by 8 j 2 q lgr n 1 c q lgr n 1 2 n 1 x n 1 which is an affine space modelled over s 2 ker q s 2 rn 1 but since there is a natural restriction map 44 s 2 s 2 l s 2 ker q and s 2 s 2 l contains the special subspace s 4 l then there is also a distinguished subspace s 20 ker q in s 2 ker q since the linear models of the fibres of j 2 j 1 contain a canonical linear subspace the bundle j 2 is equipped with a canonical vertical distribution the result follow from theorem 5 9 by comparing 44 with pr 2 the so obtained vertical distribution can be regarded as an infinitesimal description of the generalised condition of complete exceptionality 8 we denote by x n the big cell in xn i e the standard affine neighborhood 20 jan gutt gianni manno and giovanni moreno conclusions all reasoning carried out here stemmed from the peculiarity of the tangent geometry of the lagrangian grassmannian in one way or another we always relied on the fundamental isomorphism 5 in small dimensions and low degree it was easy to realise that among the natural tensorial identities following from 5 there are the conditions of complete exceptionality which in turn can be recast in the familiar terms of conformal possibly trivalent geometry even the result obtained in theorem 5 9 could be guessed so to speak by analogy but proving its validity necessarily required such a heavy machinery as the bgg resolution acknowledgements important hints and suggestions came from david calderbank willie wong v t tuc ek ciro ciliberto and pawe l nurowski 9 the work
