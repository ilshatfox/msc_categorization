means of the concept of a modulus of local connectivity and the extremal distance of the separating curves of an annulus 1 introduction the goal of this paper is to give a new proof of the carathe odory theorem which states that if d is a jordan domain and if is a conformal map of d onto the unit disk then extends to a homeomorphism of d with the closed unit disk see e g 4 5 and 9 this proof has a feature which appears to be new in that for each d it explicitly constructs a for each when proving the existence of limz z furthermore a closed form expression for in terms of and is obtained such expressions are potentially useful when estimating error in numerical computations this is accomplished by means of a modulus of local connectivity for the boundary of d roughly speaking this is a function that predicts how close two boundary points must be in order to connect them with a small arc that is included in the boundary as in 9 the proof uses the extremal distance of the separating curves of an annulus to bound z the paper is organized as follows section 2 covers background material sec tion 3 states the main ideas of the proof sections 4 and 5 deal with topological preliminaries our estimates are proven in section 6 and section 7 completes the proof 2 background let n denote the set of non negative integers when a is an annulus with inner radius r and outer radius r let a 2 log r r a is the extremal length of the family of separating curves of a see e g 3 note that a decreases as the annulus a gets thicker i e as the ratio r r increases and increases as a gets thinner i e as the ratio r r decreases when x y and z are subsets of the plane we say that x separates y from z if y and z are included in distinct connected components of c x in the case where y p we say that x separates p from z in the case where y p and z q we say that x separates p from q 1991 mathematics subject classification 30 key words and phrases complex analysis conformal mapping

connected see e g section 3 5 of 6 suppose x is a compact and connected metric space then x is locally connected if and only if it is uniformly locally arcwise connected this means that for every 0 there is a 0 so that whenever p q x and 0 d p q x includes an arc from p to q whose diameter is smaller than although its length may be infinite again see section 3 5 of 6 accordingly we define a modulus of local connectivity for a metric space x to be a function f n n so that whenever p q x and 0 d p q 2 f k x includes an arc from p to q whose diameter is smaller than 2 k thus a metric space is uniformly locally arcwise connected if and only if it has a modulus of local connectivity and a metric space that is compact and connected is locally connected if and only if it has a modulus of local connectivity note that if f is a modulus of local connectivity then limk f k in addition if a metric space has a modulus of local connectivity then it has a modulus of local connectivity that is increasing moduli of local connectivity originated in the adaptation of local connectivity properties to the setting of theoretical computer science in 1 and 2 computa tional connections between moduli of local connectivity and boundary extensions of conformal maps are made in 7 here we show that this notion may be useful in more traditional mathematical settings 3 outline of the proof we first observe the following which is proven in section 4 theorem 3 1 if 0 is a boundary point of a simply connected jordan domain d then for every r 0 0 is a boundary point of exactly one connected component of dr 0 d suppose 0 is a boundary point of a simply connected jordan domain d in light of theorem 3 1 when r 0 we let c d 0 r denote the connected component of dr 0 d whose boundary contains 0 suppose is a conformal map of d onto the unit disk the fundamental strategy of the proof is to bound the diameter of c d 0 r to do so we first construct an upper bound on the diameter of c where c is a connected component of dr d for some point in the complement of d namely in section 6 we prove the following theorem 3 2 let be a conformal map of a domain d onto the unit disk suppose a is an annulus so that a separates its center from 1 dr 0 where r a let c be a connected component of the points of d that are inside the inner circle of a suppose l 1 r 2 a then the diameter of c is at most l 2 4 a note that theorem 3 2 applies to non jordan domains with theorem 3 2 in hand some basic calculations which we perform in section 6 lead us to the following theorem 3 3 suppose is a conformal map of a jordan domain d onto the unit disk let 0 be a boundary point of d and let 0 then the diameter of c d 0 r 0 is smaller than whenever r 0 is a positive number that is smaller carathe odory s theorem and moduli of local connectivity 3 than 3 1 sup 0 l exp 8 2 l 2 2 min 0 1 w w 1 l 2 2 l 2 4 when 0 1 and l 2 7 16 1 l 2 2 l 2 4 1 thus 3 1 is positive when 0 1 in other words for all sufficiently small 0 there is a positive number r 0 that is smaller than 3 1 so suppose is a conformal map of a jordan domain d onto the unit disk we use theorem 3 3 to form an extension of to d as follows let 0 be a boundary point of d note that c d 0 r c d 0 r when 0 r r it follows from theorem 3 3 that there is exactly one point in r 0 c d 0 r we define this point to be 0 our next goal is to show that this extension of is continuous that is limz z whenever is a boundary point of d this is accomplished by showing that z c d r whenever z d is sufficiently close to this is where we use moduli of local connectivity namely in section 4 we prove the following theorem 3 4 suppose g is a modulus of local connectivity for a jordan curve suppose d is an open disk whose boundary separates two points of suppose z 0 and 0 are points so that 0 d z 0 d and z 0 0 2 g k where 2 k 2 g k max d 0 d d z 0 d then 0 is a boundary point of the connected component of z 0 in d theorem 3 4 was previously proven by means of the carathe odory theorem in 8 we give another proof here with a few extra topological steps so as to avoid circular reasoning we then obtain the following form of the carathe odory theorem from theorems 3 3 and theorem 3 4 theorem 3 5 suppose is a conformal map of a jordan domain d onto the unit disk let 0 be a boundary point of d then limz 0 z 0 furthermore if g is a modulus of local connectivity for the boundary of d then for each 0 z 0 0 whenever z 0 is a point in d so that z 0 0 2 g k and k is a non negative integer so that 2 k 2 g k is smaller than 3 1 finally the extension of to d is a homeomorphism of d with the closed unit disk the proof of theorem 3 5 is given in section 7 suppose d g 0 are as in theorem 3 5 without loss of generality suppose g is increasing thus 2 k 2 g k 2 k 1 let 0 1 we define a positive 4 timothy h mcnicholl number 0 so that z 0 when z z 0 0 let k 0 2 sup 0 l 8 2 l 2 2 min log 0 1 w w 1 l 2 2 l 2 4 0 2 k 0 2 g k 0 here x denotes the largest integer that is not larger than x thus by theorem 3 5 z 0 whenever z d and z 0 0 4 proofs of theorems 3 1 and 3 4 theorem 3 4 is used to prove theorem 3 1 the proof of theorem 3 4 is based on the following lemma and theorem lemma 4 1 let d be a jordan domain let be a crosscut of d and let 1 2 be the subarcs of the boundary of d that join the endpoints of then the interior of 1 is one side of and the interior of 2 is the other side of proof let uj denote the interior of j choose a point p in d there is a positive number so that d p d since p is a boundary point of uj uj d p is non empty so let qj uj d p and let dj be the side of that contains qj we show that uj dj uj is a connected subset of d that contains a point of dj namely qj so uj dj on the other hand dj is a connected subset of c j that contains a point of uj so dj uj d 1 6 d 2 since d 1 6 d 2 thus u 1 and u 2 are the two sides of theorem 4 2 let d be an open disk and let be a jordan curve suppose the boundary of d separates two points of let c be a connected component of d then c is the interior of a jordan curve furthermore if p is a boundary point of c that also lies in d then p lies on and the boundary of c includes the connected component of p in d proof since c 6 d the boundary of c contains a point of let p denote such a point since the boundary of d separates two points of if g is a connected component of d then g is a crosscut of d let e denote the connected component of p in d since c is a connected subset of d e there is a side of e that includes c let e denote this side and let e denote the other side by lemma 4 1 each of these sides is a jordan domain again since the boundary of d separates two points of if g is a connected component of e then g is a crosscut of e we aim to show that the boundary of c is a jordan curve which includes e to this end we construct an arc f so that e f is a jordan curve whose interior is c f will be a union of subarcs of and connected subsets of the boundary of d to define these subarcs of we define a partial ordering of the connected components of e namely when g 1 g 2 are connected components of e write g 1 g 2 if g 2 is between g 1 and e that is if e and g 1 lie in opposite sides of g 2 carathe odory s theorem and moduli of local connectivity 5 since is locally connected it follows that there is no increasing chain g 1 g 2 g 3 it then follows that if g 1 is a connected component of e then there is a maximal component of e g so that g 1 g we now define f let f e d thus e f e let m denote the set of all maximal components of e for each g m let g be the subarc of f that joins the endpoints of g let f be formed by removing each g from f and replacing it with g thus f is an arc that joins the endpoints of e and that contains no other points of e let j e f then j is a jordan curve we show that c is the interior of j note that since j e e includes the interior of j when g m let g be the side of g that includes e when g is viewed as a crosscut of d rather than e and let g denote the other side the rest of the proof revolves around the following four claims 1 for each g m the exterior of j includes g 2 the interior of j includes g m g e 3 for each g m g includes c 4 the interior of j contains no point of claims 2 and 3 together imply that the interior of j includes c claim 1 will be used to prove 4 claim 4 shows that the interior of j is included in a connected component of d which then must be c we begin by proving 1 let p g let z 0 c d thus z 0 is exterior to j since j d we construct an arc from p to z 0 that contains no point of j let q g g by lemma 4 1 g is the interior of g g so there is an arc 1 from p to q so that g q there is an arc 2 from q to z 0 so that 2 d q thus 1 2 is an arc from p to z 0 that contains no point of j thus p is exterior to j for every p g we now prove 2 suppose p 0 e belongs to g for every g m by way of contradiction suppose p 0 is exterior to j again let z 0 c d thus the exterior of j includes an arc from p 0 to z 0 let denote such an arc by examination of cases cannot cross the boundary of d at any boundary point of e so it must do so at a boundary point of e but this entails that crosses e which it does not since j includes e this is a contradiction and so p 0 is interior to j next we prove 3 let g m since is locally connected and since p e there is a positive number so that d p contains no point of any connected component of e however this disk must contain a point of c p so p p contains a point of e but no point of g hence p g since c is a connected subset of d g c g finally we prove 4 by way of contradiction suppose p is a point on that is interior to j as noted above e includes the interior of j so p e let g 1 be the connected component of p in e let g be a maximal component of e so that g 1 g since p lies inside j and since j includes g p 6 g so g 1 g this means that g 1 g by 1 p is exterior to j a contradiction so the interior of j contains no point of by the remarks after 4 c is the interior of j and the proof is complete proof of theorem 3 4 let c be the connected component of z 0 in d let l z 0 0 let z 1 be the point in l that is closest to z 0 thus z 1 c since 6 timothy h mcnicholl z 1 0 2 g k includes an arc from z 1 to 0 whose diameter is smaller than 2 k call this arc 1 we claim that d includes 1 for let q 1 it follows that max q z 0 q 0 2 k 2 g k since 2 k 2 g k max d 0 d d z 0 d it follows that q d since 1 d 0 belongs to the connected component of z 1 in d by the furthermore part of theorem 4 2 the boundary of c includes this component thus 0 is a boundary point of c proof of theorem 3 1 without loss of generality suppose dr 0 does not include d let j denote the boundary of d it follows that dr 0 separates two points of j it follows from theorem 3 4 that 0 is a boundary point of at least one connected component of dr 0 j we now show it is a boundary point of exactly two such components let e be the connected component of 0 in dr 0 j thus as noted in the proof of theorem 4 2 e is a crosscut of dr 0 if c is a connected component of dr 0 j and if 0 is a boundary point of c then exactly one side of e includes c by the proof of theorem 3 1 if c is a connected component of dr 0 j then the side of e that includes c completely determines the boundary of c thus 0 is a boundary point of exactly two connected components of d j one for each side of e so let c 1 c 2 denote the two connected components of dr 0 j whose bound aries contain 0 each of these components is a connected subset of c j so each is either included in the interior of j or in the exterior of j since there are points of the interior and exterior of j that are arbitrarily close to 0 it follows from theorem 3 4 that one of these components is included in the interior of j and one is included in the exterior of j suppose c 1 is included in the interior of j that is d c 1 let p c 1 and let u be the connected component of p in d dr 0 we show that u c 1 since c 1 is a connected subset of d dr 0 that contains p c 1 u since u is a connected subset of dr 0 j that contains p u c 1 this completes the proof of the theorem 5 preliminaries to proof of theorem 3 2 polar separations definition 5 1 let a be an annulus and let be an open subset of a a polar separation of the boundary of is a pair of disjoint sets e f so that whenever c is an intermediate circle of a there is a connected component of c whose boundary contains a point of e and a point of f our goal in this section is to prove the following theorem 5 2 let a be an annulus and let d be a simply connected jordan domain suppose that a separates two boundary points of d and let 1 and 2 be the subarcs of the boundary of d that join these points then 1 a 2 a is a polar separation of the boundary of d a our proof of theorem 5 2 is based on the following lemma carathe odory s theorem and moduli of local connectivity 7 lemma 5 3 let c be a circle and let d be a simply connected jordan domain suppose c separates two boundary points of d then there is a connected com ponent of c d whose boundary hits both subarcs of the boundary of d that join these two boundary points of d proof let p be a boundary point of d that is exterior to c and let q be a boundary point of d that belongs to the interior of c let 1 2 denote the subarcs of the boundary of d that join p and q let be a crosscut of d so that c consists of a single point label this point p let dj denote the interior of j by lemma 4 1 d 1 and d 2 are the sides of now for each j 1 2 we construct a point qj in c dj so that p is a boundary point of the connected component of qj in c dj since d is open there is a positive number so that d p d let c c d p thus c is a subarc of c let q c p then q 6 since c p so q d 1 d 2 without loss of generality suppose q d 1 relabel q as q 1 let q 2 be a point of c so that p is between q 1 and q 2 on c again q 2 d 1 d 2 since d 1 is the interior of a jordan curve and since the subarc of c from q 1 to q 2 crosses the boundary of d 1 exactly once q 2 6 d 1 so q 2 d 2 let ej denote the connected component of qj in c dj by construction p is a boundary point of ej so the other endpoint of ej must be in j since c p set e e 1 e 2 thus e is a connected component of c d one endpoint of e belongs to 1 and the other belongs to 2 this proves the lemma proof of theorem 5 2 by assumption a separates two boundary points of d one of these points is interior to the inner circle of a and the other is exterior to the outer circle of a let p denote a point that is exterior to the outer circle of a and let q denote a point that is interior to the inner circle of a let c be an intermediate circle of a then p is exterior to c and q is interior to c so by lemma 5 3 there is a connected component of c d so that one of its endpoints lies on 1 and the other lies on 2 thus 1 a 2 a is a polar separation of the boundary of d a 6 proof of theorems 3 2 and 3 3 when x y c let dinf x y denote the infimum of z w as z ranges over all points of x and w ranges over all points of y the proof of the following is essentially the same as the proof of lemma 4 1 of 7 which is a standard length area argument lemma 6 1 let a be an annulus and let be an open subset of a suppose e f is a polar separation of the boundary of then a sup dinf e f 2 area where ranges over all maps that are conformal on a neighborhood of proof of theorem 3 2 note that r 1 since c is non empty we begin by constructing a rectangle r as follows let z 0 be any point of c choose m l 0 so that l 0 l m a and 1 l 0 2 m 2 1 l 2 a since r 2 1 l 2 a z is exterior to the outer circle of a whenever z 8 timothy h mcnicholl 1 l 0 2 m 2 let 1 z 0 z 0 1 l 0 mi 2 z 0 z 0 1 l 0 mi thus the radius 0 z 0 z 0 is a perpendicular bisector of the line segment 1 2 the midpoint of 1 2 is 1 l 0 z 0 z 0 and the length of 1 2 is 2 m let 3 z 0 z 0 1 mi 4 z 0 z 0 1 mi thus the line segment 3 4 is perpendicular to the radius 0 z 0 z 0 further more the length of this segment is 2 m and its midpoint is z 0 z 0 let r be the open rectangle whose vertices are 1 2 3 and 4 that is r is the interior of 1 3 3 4 4 2 2 1 note that the diameter of r is l 20 4 m 2 also the diameter of r approaches l 2 4 a as l 0 m l a it thus suffices to show that c r we claim that it suffices to show that c contains no boundary point of r for since 1 z 0 is interior to the outer circle of a the modulus of z 0 is larger than 1 l 0 2 m 2 which is larger than 1 l 0 this implies that z 0 r since r contains at least one point of c namely z 0 and since c is connected it suffices to show that c contains no boundary point of r since 3 4 contains no point of the unit disk it contains no point of c by construction 1 2 1 l 0 2 m 2 thus z 1 l 0 2 m 2 whenever z 1 2 it follows from what has been observed about l 0 and m that 1 2 contains no point of c so it suffices to show that 1 3 4 2 contains no point of c let us begin by showing that 1 3 contains no point of c by way of contradiction suppose otherwise in order to obtain a contradiction we construct a jordan curve j so that a separates two points of j as follows let z 1 be a point of c that belongs to 1 3 thus by what has just been observed z 1 6 1 let 0 be the pre image of on 1 0 let 1 be the pre image of on 1 z 1 let 3 be the pre image of on 0 z 0 since c is connected it includes an arc from 1 z 1 to 1 z 0 label this arc 2 let w 1 be the first point on 1 that belongs to 2 let w 2 be the first point on 3 that belongs to 2 let 1 be the subarc of 1 from 1 1 to w 1 and let 3 be the subarc of 3 from w 2 to 1 0 let 2 be the subarc of 2 from w 1 to w 2 let j 0 1 2 3 thus j is a jordan curve by construction a separates two points of j let d denote the interior of j let d a let e 1 a and let f 3 a we claim that e f is a polar separation of the boundary of for let p 1 1 and let q w 1 where w 1 is as in the construction of j thus p is exterior to the outer circle of a since q c q is interior to the inner circle of a let 1 1 and let 2 2 3 0 therefore 1 2 are the subarcs of the boundary of d that join p and q so by theorem 5 2 1 a 2 a is a polar separation of the boundary of since 0 is the pre image of on 1 0 0 carathe odory s theorem and moduli of local connectivity 9 contains no point of a since 2 c 2 contains no point of a thus e 1 a and f 2 a hence e f is a polar separation of the boundary of by construction dinf e f m so by lemma 6 1 the area of is at least as large as m 2 a 1 this is impossible since the unit disk includes thus 1 3 contains no point of c by similar reasoning 4 2 contains no point of c thus c r and the theorem is proven proof of theorem 3 3 suppose r 0 is a positive number that is smaller than 3 1 we begin by defining an annulus a as follows choose l so that 0 l and so that r 0 exp 8 2 l 2 2 min 0 1 w w 1 l 2 2 l 2 4 there is a positive number r 1 so that r 1 min 0 1 w w 1 l 2 1 4 2 l 2 and so that r 0 exp 8 2 l 2 2 r 1 since l r 0 r 1 so define a to be the annulus whose center is 0 whose outer radius is r 1 and whose inner radius is r 0 we now show that the diameter of c d 0 r 0 is smaller than first note that a 2 l 2 4 set r l 1 2 a it follows that 0 z r 1 whenever z r for if z r then z l 1 2 2 l 2 4 and so r 1 0 z by the choice of r 1 this means that a separates its center from 1 dr 0 by theorem 3 2 the diameter of c d 0 r 0 is at most l 2 4 a we have l 2 4 a l 2 8 2 log r 1 r 0 l 2 2 l 2 2 thus the diameter of c d 0 r 0 is smaller than 7 proof of the carathe odory theorem we now conclude with the proof of theorem 3 5 set r 0 2 k 2 g k by theorem 3 4 z 0 c d 0 r 0 by theorem 3 3 z 0 0 thus limz 0 z 0 we now show that this extension of is injective it suffices to show that 0 6 1 whenever 0 and 1 are distinct boundary points of d by way of contradiction suppose 0 1 let p 0 we construct a jordan curve as follows let be a crosscut of d that joins 0 and 1 thus is a jordan curve that contains no unimodular point other than p let 10 timothy h mcnicholl we now construct an annulus a that separates two points of fix a positive number r so that r max z p z choose another positive number r so that r r let a be the annulus whose center is p whose inner radius is r and whose outer radius is r by the choice of r there is a point q that is exterior to the outer circle of a let 1 and 2 be the subarcs of that join p and q let e 1 a and let f 2 a finally let a d where d is the unit disk then by theorem 5 2 e f is a polar separation of the boundary of now since r is fixed as r 0 a 0 however by the choice of r dinf e f is bounded away from 0 as r 0 thus by lemma 6 1 applied to 1 area 1 as r 0 since 1 d this is a contradiction thus 0 6 1 finally we show that this extension of is surjective let be a point on the unit circle it follows from the balzano weierstrauss theorem that there is a boundary point of d 1 so that 1 1 r 0 r 1 thus 1 by the continuity of
