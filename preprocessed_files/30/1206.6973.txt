are the non zero coefficients of the maclaurin series of the riemann xi function the riemann hypothesis is the assertion that all zeros of b 1 f are real we prove that every zero of by f is the inverse of a power series in y with real coefficients which converges for y 0 2078 we show the existence of a constant similar to the de bruijn newman constant satisfying 0 y if and only if all zeros of by f are real we prove that 1 4 1 and that 1 is equivalent to the riemann hypothesis we show that the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to what the discriminant of each jensen polynomial of by f does not vanish on the interval 1 4 1 we prove the riemann hypothesis implies that the zeros of by f are simple for 0 y 1 and we conjecture that the reciprocal implication is true keywords riemann hypothesis two complex variables laguerre entire functions de bruijn newman con stant analytic continuation simple zeros 1 introduction following standard practice we define the riemann xi function as z 1 2 s s 1 s 2 s 2 s s 1 2 iz 1 where is the riemann zeta function it is well known 15 chap 1 10 that is an entire real function of order 1 and that the riemann hypothesis abbreviated rh is the assertion that all zeros of are real we have z n 0 1 na nz 2 n 2 the coefficients a n being some strictly positive numbers 9 p 41 introduce the auxiliary function f x i x n 0 a nx n 3 f is an entire real function of order 1 2 and factorizes therefore according to the hadamard theorem as f x a 0 p 1 1 x xp 4 thus rh is also the assertion that all the zeros xp of f are negative numbers in fact it suffices to show that the zeros xp are real since the coefficients a n are positive in 3 a new method was introduced by the author to determine the value and the reality of zeros of an entire function whose all coefficients of its maclaurin series are non zero real numbers this method has been generalized in 4 to the functions which may be represented by a laurent series convergent in c it was therefore natural to apply this method to the function f that satisfies these characteristics note that this is why we introduce the auxiliary function f rather than using the function that does not chek these characteristics this is the purpose of this article whose here is the plan and the main results in section 2 we recall the principle of the method introduced in 3 in defining a functionnal transformation called y borel transform and denoted by by by direct application of theorem 16 of 3 we show that the inverse of zeros e mail address vincent brugidou univ lille 1 fr 1 http arxiv org abs 1206 6973 v 1 of by f may be represented by power series in y convergent in a disk with center 0 and radius equal to 2 o 0 2078 where o is the positive root of the equation k 1 k 2 1 2 theorem 2 2 in the following sections we limit ourselves to study by f for y r in section 3 we recall some properties of the laguerre entire functions necessary for the rest of the article in section 4 we define from by f a constant whose theorem 4 3 shows that it plays a role similar to the de bruijn newman constant in particular the point iv of theorem 4 3 is a reformulation of rh in section 5 based on the results already established we get another reformulation of rh by using the theory of analytic continuation along a path theorem 5 1 in section 6 we prove corollary 6 2 that the riemann hypothesis implies that the zeros of by f are simple for y 0 1 and we discuss the reciprocal implication remark 1 it is easy to see that rh is equivalent to what f is a laguerre entire function see section 3 below for the definition of these functions in fact many of the necessary or sufficient conditions for the rh that we exhibit in this article follow from conditions of which we will demonstrate the necessity or the sufficiency in order that an entire real function may be a laguerre entire function so our article can also be considered from this point of view we can say that our approach to the rh is an external approach in the words of balazard in section 3 of 1 the theory of the fourier transforms with real zeros see 1 section 3 2 with in particular polya s results is a well known external approach of rh these two external approaches present similarities as we will see below in section 4 3 2 direct application of the method introduced in 3 to present this method it is convenient to introduce a functional transformation 2 1 formal y borel transform definition 1 let k be a field and f x n n anx n k x we will call y borel transform of f the formal power series in x and y by f x q x y n n anx ny n n 1 2 5 this definition is still valid when y is a fixed element of k by f is then a formal power series in x depending on the parameter y note that we have in particular b 1 f f when k c these definitions and notations extend naturally to cases of convergent power in the following we use the notation by f in general but it may happen that we use the notation q x y when we consider the y borel transform as a function of two variables if we change variables y 1 q x q here is a simple variable in the equation 5 by reduces to a q analogue of the formal borel transform introduced by ramis see eg 16 definition 4 4 the relationship is clearly between by and the q borel transform as in ramis assume q 1 whereas for us the interesting case is y 1 note however that our results are independant of the theory of q difference equations for which the q formal borel transform was introduced by ramis note also that we have the following relation valid for y k and y 0 k by f by y 0 by 0 f 6 and the following convergence properties valid for k c proposition 2 1 if for y 0 r by 0 f is an entire function then by f is an entire function for y y 0 furthermore when y y 0 0 y y 0 by f converges uniformly to by 0 f on every compact subsets of c and the zeros of by 0 f are the limits of zeros of by f 2 proof suppose first that y 0 1 then it is a special case of lemma 19 of 3 so we summarize the proof briefly let r be any positive number for x r and y d 0 1 y c y 1 we have anxnyn n 1 2 an rn then the power series anx nyn n 1 2 converges normally with respect to x r and y 1 q x y is therefore a continuous function in c d 0 1 it follows that q x y is uniformly continuous on each k d 0 1 where k is an arbitrary compact of c we deduce that by f is an entire function for y 1 and by f converges to b 1 f f uniformly with respect to x on each compact subsets of c when y 1 y remaining in d 0 1 then we prove that similarly to the hurwitz theorem the zeros of f are the limits of zeros of by f when y 1 y remaining in d 0 1 this is a fortiori true when y 1 along the radius 0 1 for any y 0 r we reduce to the previous case using the relationship 6 2 2 summary of the method introduced in 3 let k be a field of characteristic zero and f x n 0 anx n k x with an 6 0 for all n by considering by f as a formal power series in x over the field k y it was shown theorem 1 of 3 that the zeros of by f are the elements of k y given for p 1 by xp y 1 p y 7 where p y k y is given by p y q p up q y q and up q vp q vp 1 q 8 in particular up p ap ap 1 9 further theorem 15 of 3 shows that for p 1 q p vp q x 1 yq p 1 logqp x y 10 with qp x y y p 2 p 1 2 ap 1 xp 1 q x y in the equation 10 logqp denotes the extended composition as it was defined in section 4 of 3 of the formal power series qp x y k x y by log 1 z k z and we use the notation xiyj to denote the coefficient in xiyj in the 2 variable power series which follows this symbol we thus get vp q section 5 of 3 as a product of a 1 a 0 by a polynomial expression in the variables n defined for n 1 by n an 1 an 1 a 2 n suppose now that k c when r 0 we say that f satisfies the property a r if for all real number r 0 r r we have p 1 q p vp q r q 11 we then put down r sup r 0 a r is true if this set is not empty and r 0 otherwise it has been shown theorem 3 of 3 for y c such that y r that the power series p y converge as well as the infinite product by f x a 0 p 1 1 p y x 12 the zeros of by f are therefore exactly given by equation 7 for y r p taking all values such that p y 6 0 3 using a method of majorant series it was also shown theorem 16 of 3 that if we put supn 1 n we have r 2 o 1 where o is the positive root of the equation in k 1 k 2 1 2 13 in particular if all coefficients an are real and if 2 o 0 2078 all the zeros of the entire function f are real corollary 18 of 3 note that if f is a polynomial of degree n whose all coefficients are different from zero the method outlined above is fully applicable for the n zeros xp y 1 p n with the following convention k 0 for k n in 4 these results were extended to the case of laurent series n zanx n convergent on c finally note that the factorization of q x y in infinite product and the formula 10 can be generalized to the case where q x y n an y x nyn n 1 2 where an y is now a series in y with a valuation equal to zero 5 this latter result can be easily applied to factorize a large number of q series in an infinite product 2 3 application to the function f as noted in the introduction the coefficients a n of the entire function f are real and different from zero we can therefore apply the method described above this gives the following new theorem theorem 2 2 let o be the positive root of equation 13 and f be the entire function defined by equation 3 then the zeros of the y borel transform of f can be calculated explicitly by the formulas 7 8 10 for 0 y 2 o 0 2078 and they are all real for 0 y 2 o proof in 8 csordas and al 1986 it was proved for n 1 the double inequality 1 bn 1 bn 1 b 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 1 where the coefficients bn are related to our coefficients a n by bn 2 n a n 2 n 3 it follows that 2 n 1 2 n 1 n n 1 n a n 1 a n 1 a n 2 n n 1 14 the inequality on the right side of 14 is sometime called the turan inequality proof is now a direct application of theorem 16 of 3 to the function f with supn 1 n 1 and gives r 2 o so for y 2 o the power series p y converge for all p 1 and we get all the zeros of by f with 7 by taking all values of p 1 such as p y 6 0 further as the coefficients a n are real numbers it is the same for vp q then for p y and therefore for all the zeros of by f when y 0 2 o it follows from proposition 2 1 that the zeros of by f are also real numbers when y 2 o assume now we can show that r 1 for f then the results of theorem 2 2 extend to the disk y 1 specifically theorem 16 of 3 shows that all series p y converge and give by the equation 7 the zeros of by f for y 1 we then show as above that all zeros of by f are real for y 0 1 and in particular that rh is true hence we just prove the implication r 1 for the function f rh is true 15 note that to prove the condition r 1 we cannot use theorem 16 of 3 for which the lower bound r 2 o is optimum so we have to seek a majoration of vp q different from that used in this theorem and probably specific to the function f this raises difficult technical problems so we cannot at present increase the convergence radius of the power series p y that s why we have limited ourselves in the rest of the article to study the reality of the zeros of by f when y increases along the real segment 2 o 1 in renouncing a priori to the convergence of the power series p y in the disk y 1 4 3 background on the laguerre entire functions for the reader s convenience we recall in this section the definitions and some known properties of these functions see for example 12 or 7 definition 2 i we say that an entire function f is of the first type of laguerre abbreviated l 1 if it can be written f x cxme x p 1 1 apx with c ap 0 m n and p 1 ap ii we say that an entire function f is of the second type of laguerre abbreviated l 2 if it can be written f x cxme ax 2 bx p 1 1 apx e apx with c b ap r a 0 m n and p 1 a 2 p note that in 7 the laguerre entire functions are called the laguerre polya class let us give two others definition that will be useful definition 3 let f x n 0 anx nbe a formal power series on c finite or infinite for n n the n th jensen polynomial of f is the polynomial we follow the definition given in 7 section 3 jn x n k 0 n n k akx k 16 definition 4 we say that a formal power series f x n 0 anx n is without gaps if it can be written f x n 2 n n 1 anx n with an 6 0 for 0 n 1 n n 2 for any formal power series without gaps we put n an 1 an 1 a 2 n for n 1 n n 2 and n 0 otherwise here are the known properties of laguerre entire functions we need proposition 3 1 if f is l 1 then it is l 2 if f is l 2 and if all the coefficients of its maclaurin series are positive then it is l 1 if f x n 0 anx n is l 1 then it is without gaps and we have the inequality of turan n n n 1 for all n 1 17 the set of functions l 1 respectively l 2 is closed for the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of c and stable by derivation theorem 3 2 laguerre let f x n 0 anx n be l 2 and let be l 2 without positive zeros then the function n 0 an n x n is l 2 theorem 3 3 let f x n 0 anx n be an entire function with coefficient in c such that f 0 6 0 then jensen f is l 1 if and only if its jensen polynomials have only negative zeros f is l 2 if and only if its jensen polynomials have only real zeros moreover polya 14 if f is l 2 and not of the form p x e x where p is a polynomial and a real number different from zero its jensen polynomials have only simple real zeros remark 2 we chek with 4 and definition 2 that rh is equivalent to what f is l 1 as announced in remark 1 conversely if f is l 1 proposition 3 1 shows that f has no gaps and satisfies the inequality 17 hence we can apply to f the method introduced in 3 and summarized above futher the inequality 17 shows that 1 for f therefore theorem 2 2 applies exactly to f 5 4 an analogue of the de bruijn newman constant 4 1 some additional properties of the y borel transform we establish a principle of contraction we need to prove the following theorems in the article theorem 4 1 let f x n 0 anx n be an entire function with real coefficients an i if f is l 2 then by f is also l 2 for y 0 1 ii if there is y 0 0 1 such that by 0 f has only real zeros then by f is l 2 for y 0 y 0 in 2 see also 16 definition 4 1 be zivin introduced the following definition definition 5 let q c we say that a formal power series f x n 0 anx n c x is q gevrey type 1 if the power series bq 1 f xq n 0 anx nq n n 1 2 has a convergence radius different from zero first we prove lemma 4 2 let q 0 be such that the formal power series f x n 0 anx n c x is q gevrey type 1 then for y 1 q by f is an entire function of order zero in particular if f is an entire function by f is an entire function of order zero for y 1 proof it is easy to see that f is q gevrey type 1 is equivalent to the fact that there exist c a 0 such that for n n an cq n n 1 2 an 18 let be any positive number and y a nonzero complex number such that y 1 q we have then for n n n an yn n 1 2 1 n n c 1 n y q n 1 2 a with y q 1 hence the left hand side of the above equation tends to ze ro as n there is therfore a naturel integer n 1 such that for n n 1 we have an yn n 1 2 1 n 1 n 19 let us write by f n 0 cnx n ie cn any n n 1 2 taking 1 equation 19 gives limn n cn 0 what already shows that by f is an entire function this implies in particular that there is a naturel integer n 2 such that for n n 2 log c 1 n 0 20 we set n 0 max n 1 n 2 from 19 and 20 we get for n n 0 0 n logn log c 1 n 1 since is arbitrary in r we deduce lim n n logn log c 1 n 0 it follows from theorem 14 1 1 of 11 that the order of by f is zero now if f is an entire function then limn n an 0 there is thus a natural integer n such that for n n we have an 1 hence with c max 0 n n an 1 and a 1 18 shows that f is 1 gevrey type 1 by f is therefore an entire function of order zero for y 1 6 proof of theorem 4 1 i if f is l 2 and y 0 1 we consider the function c c defined by x y x x 1 2 exp ln y 2 x 2 ln y 2 x is an entire function and l 2 because ln y 0 and it has no positive zeros because it has no zeros the application of theorem 3 2 to f and shows that the function n 0 an n x n by f x is l 2 the case y 0 is obvious since b 0 f x a 0 ii if f is an entire function and y 0 0 1 we know from lemma 4 2 that by 0 f is an entire function of order zero thus it can be written by 0 f x amy m m 1 2 0 x m p 1 1 apx where am is the first non zero coefficient of the maclaurin series of f and where the product is normally convergent on each compact subset of c it follows that by 0 f is l 2 if f is real and by 0 f has only real zeros for y 0 y 0 we get by 6 by f b y y 0 by 0 f with y y 0 0 1 thus it follows from the previous cases that by f is l 2 4 2 constant associated with by f definition 6 let f be given by 3 we define sup y 0 such that by f is an entire function and has only real zeros we are going to show that satisfies the following equivalences for y 0 we have y by f is an entire function whose zeros are all real 1 rh 21 in fact we will prove the more accurate following result theorem 4 3 we have i if 0 y by f is l 1 and has thus only negative zeros ii if 1 and y 1 by f is an entire function with at least two non real zeros iii if 1 y the convergence radius of by f is zero iv 1 if and only if the riemann hypothesis is true v we have 0 2 o 1 4 1 this theorem is one of the main results of the article in particular the point iv gives a reformulation of rh to prove this theorem we need two lemmas lemma 4 4 let f x n 0 anx n be an entire function with an 6 0 for all n and satisfying lim infn 1 n 1 then the radius of convergence of by f is zero for all y c such that y 1 7 proof let y c y 1 we have y y 1 2 1 by assumption there exists an integer n 0 1 such that for n n 0 we have n 1 in addition we have for all n 2 an an 1 n 1 n 2 1 a 1 a 0 if as above cn any n n 1 2 we have for n n 0 cn cn 1 n 1 n 0 y n nom with m n 0 1 1 y n 0 a 1 a 0 thus cn cn 1 1 y n n 0 m m is a constant different from zero and 1 y 1 it follows that the convergence radius of by f is zero lemma 4 5 for any formal power without gaps f x n 0 anx n c x satisfying a 0 6 0 and the y borel transform of f is an entire function of order zero for y 1 in addition if the coefficients an are positive by f is a function l 1 for y 0 1 4 proof with an easy recurrence we have for n 1 an n 1 n 2 2 1 n 1 a n 1 an 10 then an n n 1 2 a 1 a 0 n a 0 by comparison with the inequality 18 it follows that f is q gevrey type 1 for q lemma 4 2 then shows that by f is an entire function of order zero when y 1 assume now an 0 and consider the jensen polynomials of f jn it is easy to see that the jensen polynomials of the y borel transform of f are the y borel transform of the jensen polynomials of f ie by jn x n k 0 n n k akx ky k k 1 2 n k 0 cn kx k 22 for y 0 we have cn k 0 and for 1 k n 1 cn k 1 cn k 1 c 2 n k ak 1 ak 1 a 2 k n k n k 1 y and then for y 0 1 4 cn k 1 cn k 1 c 2 n k 1 4 it follows from a theorem of kurtz see section 4 of 7 that all the zeros of by jn are negative this being true for any n n we deduce from the theorem 3 3 that by f is l 1 for y 0 1 4 the case y 0 is obvious proof of theorem 4 3 according to the double inequality 14 we have limn n 1 thus lemma 4 4 shows that for y 1 by f has a convergence radius equal to zero which proves iii this also shows that 1 ie the last inequality of v 8 now let y be such that 0 y 1 according to the definition of there is y 0 such that y y 0 1 and such thatby 0 f has only real zeros it follows from item ii of theorem 4 1 that by f is l 2 in addition it is clear that the coefficients of the maclaurin series of by f are positive therefore by f is actually l 1 with proposition 3 1 since l 1 is closed for the topology of uniform convergence on each compact subset of c see proposition 3 1 we deduce from proposition 2 1 that b f is also l 1 this proves i we reason by contradiction to prove ii assume that 1 and that there is y 0 1 such that by 0 f has only real zeros if y 0 1 the point ii of theorem 4 1 shows that for y 0 y 0 the zeros of by f are real numbers in contradiction with the definition of if y 0 1 the function b 1 f f is l 2 because we know that f is written as f x a 0 p 1 1 x xp with a 0 0 the point i of theorem 4 1 then shows that the zeros of by f are real for y 0 1 in contradiction with 1 for the point iv the implication rh 1 is now clear with ii since we already know that 1 the reciprocal implication follows from i to complete the proof of v we apply lemma 4 5 to f with 1 hence by f is l 1 and has all its zeros real for y 0 1 4 which proves 1 4 remark 3 we can now prove that for the function f we have 2 o r 1 the inequality 2 o r follows from theorem 2 2 in addition assume that r 1 then the theorem 3 of 2 shows that we have for y r by f x a 0 p 1 1 p y x where the product is normally convergent on any compact subset of c thus by f would be an entire function for y 1 r contradicting iii of theorem 4 3 4 3 analogy of with the de bruijn newman constant in 13 newman working after de bruijn 6 on the fourier transforms with real zeros see remark 1 defines for r z 2 0 exp u 2 u cos zu du that is the fourier transform of exp u 2 u where u n 1 4 2 n 4 e 9 u 2 6 n 2 e 5 u 2 exp n 2 e 2 u we have 0 z z where is the riemann xi function the constant of de bruijn newman whose the existence was proved in 13 satisfies the properties we follow the presentation given in 1 section 3 2 2 for r we have 4 is an entire function whose zeros are all real 0 rh by comparison with the properties 21 we see that the constant plays a role similar to that of the constant it would be interesting to find an equation relating to we leave aside the issue in the following of the article 5 another reformulation of the riemann hypothesis here is the reformulation theorem 5 1 let a n be defined by the equation 2 where is the riemann xi function given by 1 for n 0 denote by n y the discriminant of the following polynomial by j n x n k 0 n n k a kx kyk k 1 2 9 then the riemann hypothesis is true if and only if for all n 2 n y does not vanish on the interval 1 4 1 to prove this theorem we need two lemmas lemma 5 2 let k be a field of characteristic zero and p x a 0 a 1 x anx n k x with ak 6 0 for 0 k n then i the discriminant y of by p is a polynomial in y not identically zero ii if k r sup 1 k n 1 ak 1 ak 1 a 2 k and if we assume the roots of by p are simple for y 2 o 1 1 p has only real roots proof i by application of theorem 1 of 3 we have in the ring k x y by p x a 0 n p 1 1 p y x with see equations 8 and 9 above p y ap ap 1 yp q p 1 up q y q 23 thus the zeros of by p considered as a polynomial in x on the field k y can be written as see equation 7 xp y p y 1 ap 1 apyp 1 q 1 wp q y q 24 where wp q k it follows that the polynomial by p is separate over k y and that its zeros are all distinct because they have different valuations this proves that the discriminant y of by p is a polynomial in y not identically zero ii first we assume 2 o 1 1 otherwise corollary 18 of 3 shows that p has only real roots without requirement of simplicity of the roots we know by the theorem 16 of 3 that the series p y are absolutely convergent in the disk d 0 2 o 1 y c y 2 o 1 thus they define holomorphic functions in this disk since any n n 1 2 does not vanish outside 0 it is the same for the functions p y therefore the n zeros xp y 1 p y of by p are also holomorphic functions in the punctured disk d 0 2 o 1 y c 0 y 2 o 1 and their laurent series at the point 0 given by 24 converge on this punctured disk it is well known that the roots of q x y by p x 0 are the branches of one or several algebraic functions that would be obtained by decomposing q into irreductible factors in the factorial ring c x y the following decomposition shows that the case of several algebraic functions cannot be excluded q x y by 1 x x 2 x 3 1 xy x 2 y 3 x 3 y 6 1 xy 2 1 x y y 2 x 2 y 4 however we will follow the reasoning of section 12 1 of 11 which deals with the case of a single algebraic function indeed the reasoning of section 12 1 of 11 does not depend for the part that concern us to the fact that q is irreductible or not for a fixed value y c s s is a set defined below the equation q x y n k 0 akx kyk k 1 2 0 25 has n distinct finite roots the set s of exceptional values is composed of three subsets the first of these is the subset of roots of any n n 1 2 0 ie 0 the laurent series 24 shows that y 0 is actually a pole of order p for xp y secondly we must exclude the values of y for which 25 has multiple roots it is well known that these values of y are the roots of the discriminant y we know from the point i of lemma 5 2 that y is not identically nul so this second subset is finite third we must exclude the point at infinity s is thus finite and the hypothesis of the point ii of lemma 5 2 shows that s 2 o 1 1 let d be the distance between s r and r we set d if s r put b max y s r y 2 o 1 we have b 0 since 0 s 10 and consider the real number a b 2 o 1 2 we have a d 0 2 o 1 put 1 2 min d a b we have 0 for each p 1 2 n the function xp y holomorphic in d 0 2 o 1 can be expanded in a taylor series around the point a which converges in a disk y a p p 0 put min 1 2 n we have 0 for y 0 2 o 1 1 t y 0 denotes the closed rectangular subset of the complex plane whose vertices are the complex numbers a i a i y 0 i y 0 i t y 0 denotes the interior of t y 0 let y 0 be a fixed positive number in 2 o 1 1 the distance between t y 0 and s is a positive number y 0 0 for p 1 2 n the taylor series of xp y around the point a is convergent in the disk y a which is included in t y 0 for all y 0 2 o 1 1 following the reasoning of section 12 1 of 11 for the open subset t y 0 the implicit function theorem shows that each of these taylor series can be continued analytically along every path in t y 0 since t y 0 is a simply connected domain the monodromy theorem see 11 p 12 shows that these analytic continuations provide for each p 1 2 n a holomorphic function in t y 0 which coincides respectively with xp y in the disk y a it follows from the principle of analytic continuation that we have for each p 1 2 n an analytic continuation of xp y which is now defined and holomorphic in d 0 2 o 1 t y 0 if we do this for all y 0 2 o 1 1 we get for each p 1 2 n an analytic continuation of xp y that we denote x p y holomorphic in the open subset o d 0 2 o 1 t 1 y 0 2 o 1 1 d 0 2 o 1 t y 0 note that 0 1 o by construction for p 1 2 n and y o x p y is a zero of by p in addition since q 0 y a 0 6 0 we have x p y 6 0 in o for each p 1 2 n hence the law of permanence of functional equations see section 10 7 of 11 shows that the relation q x y a 0 n p 1 1 x x p y 0 is still valid for x c and y o it follows that the n values x p y are exactly the roots of by p for y o it is clear that the domain o is symmetrical about the real axis by assumption the coefficients ak are real thus p y and xp y p y 1 are also real on the nonempty open interval 0 2 o 1 where they coincide with respectively p y and x p y hence applying the schwarz reflection principle to o and each holomorphic function x p y we find that x p y is a real number for y 0 1 and 1 p n in fact we have just shown that the zeros of by p are all real for y 0 1 the proposition 2 1 then allows to conclude lemma 5 3 let f x n 0 anx n be an entire function and for n n let jn be the n th jensen polynomial of f i if the coefficients an are real different from zero and satisfy the condition we have f is l 2 and therefore its zeros are real the polynomials by jn have only simple zeros for y 2 o 1 1 ii if the coefficients an are strictly positive we have f is l 1 and therefore its zeros are negative and the polynomials by jn have only simple zeros for y 1 4 1 proof i suppose first that for all n n by jn has only simple zeros for y 2 o 1 1 as before we assume 2 o 1 1 otherwise corollary 18 of 3 and lemma 4 2 above show that by f is l 2 for y 0 1 and we deduce from proposition 2 1 and the last point of proposition 3 1 that f is l 2 without requirement of simplicity of zeros we have jn x n k 0 cn kx k with cn k n n k ak r and for 1 k n 1 cn k 1 cn k 1 c 2 k n k n k 1 ak 1 ak 1 a 2 k n 1 n k 11 thus sup 1 k n 1 cn k 1 cn k 1 c 2 n k supk 1 k we then apply lemma 5 2 to jn which shows that this polynomial has only real zeros since this is true for any n n it follows from theorem 3 3 that f is l 2 conversely if we assume that f is l 2 we know from theorem 4 1 that by f is l 2 for all y 0 1 furthermore lemma 4 2 shows that the order of by f is zero in this interval thus by f is not of the form p x e x where p is a polynomial and a nonzero real number it follows from the last point of theorem 3 3 that the jensen polynomials of by f have only simple zeros for y 0 1 and in particular for 2 o 1 1 ii assume first that we assume 1 4 1 otherwise lemma 4 5 shows that f is l 1 without requirement of simplicity of zeros and that for all n n the polynomial by jn has only simple zeros for y 1 4 1 we know by lemma 4 5 that by f is l 1 thus also l 2 for y 0 1 4 and moreover it is zero order it is thus not of the form p x e x where p is a polynomial and a nonzero real number and the zeros of by jn are then also simple for y 0 1 4 by theorem 3 3 hence the zeros of by f are simple for y 0 1 and we can apply the results of i which shows that f is l 2 it follows from proposition 3 1 that f is also l 1 we deduce the converse from i and the fact that 1 by inequality 17 proof of theorem 5 1 let f be the function defined by 3 we already now that the riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that f is l 1 we notice now that the polynomials by j n x n k 0 n n k a kx kyk k 1 2 are the y borel transform of the jensen polynomials of f we then use the ii of lemma 5 3 taking into account the fact that we have 1 for f see section 2 3 hence rh is true if and only if by f has only simple zeros for y 1 4 1 and n n this is obvious for n 0 and n 1 and for n 2 this amounts to saying that n y does not vanish in this interval remark 4 it is well known that n y can be expressed as a determinant theorem 5 1 can then be compared to a condition equivalent to rh given in section c 8 of 17 and using a different sequence of determinants 6 simplicity of the zeros of by f a new necessary condition for the rh follows from the following general theorem theorem 6 1 if f is l 2 with f 0 6 0 then the zeros of by f are simple and real for y 0 1 corollary 6 2 we can improve theorem 4 3 by replacing the point i of this theorem by i if 0 y by f is l 1 and thus has only negative zeros furthermore the zeros are simple if 0 y in particular the riemann hypothesis implies that the zeros of by f are simple for y 0 1 proof the first part of the point i is the point i of theorem 4 3 we have already proved it then suffices to apply theorem 6 1 to b f to deduce that the zeros of by f are simple for 0 y further rh implies that 1 see iv of theorem 4 3 and the final implication follows from i we need the following lemma to prove theorem 6 1 12 lemma 6 3 let q x y n n 0 anx nyn n 1 2 with an c and n a natural number greater than 1 or n if n assume that the power series in two variables x and y converges in a neighborhood of a b c 2 with a and b different from zero assume further that q a b 0 q x a b 0 2 q x 2 a b 6 0 then there is a convergent puiseux series h satisfying q a h b h 0 and whose the first term is a 2 b h 1 2 26 proof let t h k be the taylor expansion of q x y about a b taken as t h k q a k b h n n 3 2 n 0 i j n ai jh ikj with ai j 1 i j nq yi xj a b by assumption we have a 0 0 0 a 0 1 0 a 0 2 6 0 thus a 0 1 b n n 1 nana n 1 b n 2 n 2 2 0 and since b 6 0 a 1 n n 2 nana n 1 b n 2 n 2 2 27 then a 1 0 q y a b n n 1 n n 1 2 ana nb n 2 n 2 2 or a 1 0 aa 1 n n 2 n n 1 2 ana nb n 2 n 2 2 and with 27 a 1 0 n n 2 n n 1 2 ana nb n 2 n 2 2 in addition we have a 0 2 1 2 n n 2 n n 1 anan 2 bn n 1 2 6 0 and since a 6 0 we get a 1 0 a 2 b a 0 2 6 0 the newton polygon is thus reduced in a h k plane to the segment that connects the point 0 2 to point 1 0 the puiseux theorem asserts the existence of a convergent puiseux series h satisfying t h h 0 let us determine the first term of this series with the method of newton puiseux see for exemple 10 chap 7 the quasi homogeneous polynomial corresponding to the newton polygon is t h k a 2 b h k 2 a 0 2 so the parametrization is at the first approximation h t 2 k t 13 where is determined by the equation t h k a 2 b 2 t 2 a 0 2 0 it follows a 2 b 1 2 giving the first term 26 proof of theorem 6 1 we are going to show that there are no zeros of the function by f which may have an order greater than one for y 0 1 let m be a natural number superior or equal to 2 and f x n n 0 anx n be a l 2 function here n is an integer superior or equal to m if f is a polynomial of degree n or n if f is transcendent assume the existence of b 0 1 and a r such that a is a zero of bb f with order m ie bb f a q a b 0 bb f a q x a b 0 bb f m 1 a m 1 q xm 1 a b 0 bb f m a mq xm a b 6 0 note that we have a 6 0 otherwise bb f 0 a 0 b 0 with b 6 0 which implies a 0 f 0 0 in contradiction with the hypothesis an easy induction shows that we have formally for all l n by f l x y l l 1 2 by f l x yl in particular we have bb f m 2 x b m 2 m 1 2 bb f m 2 x bm 2 where the power series in x are convergent on c if n therefore bb f m 2 x b m 2 m 1 2 bb f m 1 x bm 2 and bb f m 2 x b m 2 m 3 2 bb f m x bm 2 we set g f m 2 and c abm 2 the degree of g is superior to 1 or g is transcendent c is a real number different from zero and we have bb g c b m 2 m 1 2 bb f m 2 a 0 bb g c b m 2 m 1 2 bb f m 1 a 0 bb g c b m 2 m 3 2 bb f m a 6 0 it follows that by g satisfies the assumptions of lemma 6 3 with c b c 2 where c and b are different from 0 hence there exists a convergent puiseux series k h such that bb h g c h 0 and whose the first term is c 2 b h 1 2 it is possible to choose a determination of the power z 1 2 holomorphic in an open subset containing r and such that 1 1 2 i so we have for h 0 and small enough h i c b h o h it follows that for positive small enough h h will have a nonzero imaginary part it is the same for c h since c is a real number we just prove that there is 0 such that by g has at least one non real zero for y b b 0 1 but the last point of proposition 3 1 shows that g is l 2 thus we have a contradiction because the point i of theorem 4 1 shows that by g is also l 2 and has therefore only real zeros for y 0 1 14 remark 5 theorem 6 1 can be used in the proof of lemma 5 3 instead of the point 3 of theorem 3 3 it can also be used to prove with theorem 5 1 that rh implies actually that n y does not vanish on the interval 0 1 for all n 0 it is natural to think that the reciprocal of theorem 6 1 is true so we formulate the following conjecture conjecture if f is an entire real function whithout gaps in the sense of definition 4 and supn 1 n then f is l 2 with f 0 6 0 is equivalent to that the zeros of by f are simple for y 0 1 first note that with the function f the conjecture gives the reciprocal of the final implication of corollary 6 2 ie the conjecture announced in the abstract we just prove the necessity of the condition of simplicity of the zeros we now discuss the sufficiency of this condition for each p 1 we can write the power series see 8 et 9 above p y ap ap 1 yp 1 ap 1 ap q 1 up q y q where the power series in parentheses converges for y 2 o 1 as before we assume 2 o 1 1 otherwise we have already seen that f is l 2 without requirement of simplicity of zeros it follows that p y does not vanish in a punctured disk 0 y rp 2 o 1 where rp depends a priori on p each zeros of by f xp y p y 1 is therefore a holomorphic function in this punctured disk we can now try to follow the reasoning of the point ii of lemma 5 2 by using the implicit function theorem for each p 1 this would lead to an analytic continuation x p y of the holomorphic function xp y where x p y is now defined in an open subsets containing 0 1 the rest of the reasoning would be the same as that of lemma 5 2 however there is now a challenge to make this reasoning rigorous because we can not exclude here the fact that some zeros of by f tend to infinity for certain values of y in the interval 0 1 acknowledgements i am grateful to h queffe lec for advices i also thank p de bes for useful discussions we had references 1 m balazard un sie cle et demi de recherches sur l hypothe se de
