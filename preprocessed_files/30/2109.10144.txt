maximum principle and asymptotic properties of hermite pade polynomials sergey p suetin abstract in the paper we discuss how it would be possible to succeed in stahl s novel approach 1987 1988 to explore hermite pade polynomials based on riemann surface properties in particular we explore the limit zero distribution of type i hermite pade polynomials qn 0 qn 1 qn 2 degqn j 6 n for a collection of three analytic elements 1 f f 2 the element f is an element of a function f from the class c z w where w is supposed to be from the class z 1 2 1 1 of multivalued analytic functions generated by the inverse zhukovskii function with the exponents from the set 1 2 the riemann surface corresponding to f c z w is a four sheeted riemann surface r 4 w and all branch points of f are of the first order i e all branch points are of square root type it is proved that there exits the similar limit zero distribution for all three polynomials qn j the answer is done in terms of nuttall s condenser which was introduced by e rakhmanov and the author in 2013 the corresponding limit measure is supported on the second plate of nuttall s condenser which coincides with the projection of the boundary between the first and the second sheets of the three sheeted riemann surface r 3 w associated by nuttall with the element w the limit measure is a unique solution of a mixed green logarithmic theoretical potential equilibrium problem in general the surface r 3 w can be of any genus since the algebraic function f c z w is of fourth order and we con sider the triple of the analytic elements 1 f f 2 but not the quadruple 1 f f 2 f 3 ones the result is new and does not follow from the known results as in previous paper arxiv 2108 00339 and following to stahl s ideas 1987 1988 we do not use the orthogonality relations at all the proof is based on the maximum principle only bibliography 45 titles contents 1 introduction 2 2 proof of theorem 1 4 3 concluding remarks and some conjectures 8

function here and in what follows such branch of the function z 2 1 1 2 is taken that outside of the segment e 1 1 it holds z 2 1 1 2 z 1 as z therefore we have that z z 2 as z let m n and aj bj r be real numbers with the following properties a 1 b 1 ak bk 1 1 ak 1 bk 1 am bm set w z m j 1 aj 1 z bj 1 z 1 2 z d c e 1 we denote the class of all analytic functions given by the explicit representation 1 by z 1 2 e we emphasize once again that it is supposed that the parameters aj and bj satisfy the above conditions notice that for m 1 the systems w w 2 and w w 2 w 3 form nikishin systems see 40 being defined in such a way the function w is an algebraic function of fourth order all of its branch points are of the first order i e all branch points are of square root type and they constitute the set w 1 a 1 b 1 am bm where aj aj 1 aj 2 bj bj 1 bj 2 j 1 m the riemann surface rs corresponding to w is a four sheeted rs r 4 w under the above condition on z there is an analytic element w h of w with the following property w m j 1 aj bj 0 the element w extends as a holomorphic single valued analytic function to the domain d c e set f m j 1 aj bj let f c z w then f is a single valued meromorphic function on the rs r 4 w therefore the asymptotic properties of type i hermite pade polynomials hp polynomials for the collection of four functions 1 f f 2 f 3 follows directly from the results of the paper 18 see also 19 and 20 but this is not the case for the collection of three functions 1 f f 2 when f c z w notice also that in general function f c z w is a complex valued function on the real line therefore a very general and powerful approach initiated by gonchar and rakhmanov 13 in 1981 and substantially generalized and advanced in the excellent papers 14 and 2 is not applicable in the case under consideration in the current paper 1 2 let f c z w and f h be the element of f which corresponds to the element w being described before in particular w m j 1 aj bj 0 we suppose that this condition holds up to the end of the paper let n n be fixed and polynomials qn 0 qn 1 qn 2 of degree 6 n be defined not uniquely from the relation rn z qn 0 qn 1 f qn 2 f 2 z o 1 z 2 n 2 z 2 those polynomials qn 0 qn 1 qn 2 are type i hermite pade polynomials for the multiindex n n n and the collection 1 f f 2 function rn z rn z f is the error function maximum principle and hermite pade polynomials 3 for each positive borel measure supp c we demote by v z the logarithmic potential of v z log 1 z d z c supp let gf z z c f be the green function for the domain with logarithmic singularity at the point z let g f z gf z d 3 be the corresponding green potential of the measure in a similar way we define the functions ge z and g e z for the domain d c e it is well known see 31 and the bibliography therein that there exists a unique probability measure e supported on the compact set e e m 1 e with the following property 1 3 v e x g e f x we const x e 4 let f f e m 1 f be the balayage of the measure e from the domain to the compact set f on the base of the properties of potentials of the measure e and according to the scheme proposed in 31 see also 42 it is possible to construct a three sheeted riemann surface r 3 f with the so called nuttall partition into open sheets r 0 3 3 z 0 r 1 3 3 z 1 and r 2 3 3 z 2 3 z j z and with the fol lowing properties the given element f h is lifted to the infinity point 0 r 0 and after then extends as a meromorphic function up to the bound ary between the first sheet r 1 3 and the second sheet r 2 3 it is easy to see that this element extends even beyond this boundary a little on the second sheet the following function u z 2 g e f z v e z z f u z 1 g ef z v e z z e f u z 0 2 v e z we z e 5 extends to the whole set r 3 f 0 1 2 as a harmonic function u z with the following singularities at the infinity points u z 2 log z o 1 z u z 1 log z o 1 z u z 0 2 log z o 1 z 6 from 5 it follows see 31 and subsection 2 1 below that u z 0 u z 1 u z 2 7 thus from 6 and 7 it follows that the partition into three open sheets r 0 3 r 1 3 and r 2 3 is indeed the nuttall partition of r 3 f with respect to the point 0 for more details about the construction of the riemann surface r 3 f see 31 42 section 3 below and fig 1 notice that the structure of the nuttall partition with respect to the point 0 for the four sheeted rs r 4 w 1 we suppose that there will be no ambiguity in the notations we w and etc 4 sergey p suetin of the function w was analyzed in detail in 17 from that paper it follows that under the above conditions on the parameters aj and bj in both cases of r 3 w and r 4 w zero and first sheets of the partitions are just the same but it is not the case in the general situation for more details see 17 4 and section 3 below for a polynomial q c z 0 let q q 0 be the corresponding zero counting measure the main result of the paper is the following statement cf 41 18 19 20 theorem 1 let f c z w and the analytic element f h satisfies the above conditions then for type i hermite pade polynomials qn j j 0 1 2 we have that as n 1 n qn j f j 0 1 2 8 qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 1 n cap e 2 g e f z 1 z 9 from the proof of theorem 1 it follows that corollary 1 the sequences n degqn j j 0 1 2 are bounded finally we notice that the asymptotic properties of hermite pade polynomials are still of unabated interest see 1 5 22 34 23 34 4 and the bibliog raphy therein an accessible presentation of the potential theory on riemann surface is given in the papers 9 11 2 proof of theorem 1 2 1 for two positive sequences n and n the relation n n means that 0 c 1 6 n n 6 c 2 for n 1 2 and some constants c 1 c 2 which do not depend on n for two sequences n z and n z of functions holomorphic in a domain g the relation n n means that for each compact set k g and n 1 2 0 c 1 6 n z n z 6 c 2 for z k where the constants c 1 c 2 depend on k but do not depend on n and z k evidently that for such pairs of sequences and functions we have that n n 1 n 1 as n let r 3 r 3 w be the three sheeted riemann surface associated by nut tall with the given element w w z 1 2 e w m j 1 ajbj 0 see 26 31 41 42 the zero sheet r 0 3 of rs r 3 is equivalent to riemann sphere cutted along the segment e r 0 3 c e and we have r 0 3 e 0 1 where 3 e 0 1 e the first sheet r 1 3 of r 3 is equivalent to the riemann sphere cutted along the compact sets e and f m j 1 aj bj r 1 3 c e t f and have r 1 3 e 0 1 t f 1 2 where 3 f 1 2 f the second sheet r 2 3 is equivalent to the riemann sphere cutted along to the compact set f r 2 3 c f and we have that r 2 3 f 1 2 where 3 f 1 2 f see fig 1 maximum principle and hermite pade polynomials 5 let prove the inequity 7 we have that u z 2 u z 1 2 g ef 0 z f from 7 16 it follows the identity 3 v e z g e f z g f e z 3 ge z we const z c 10 where ge z is green function for the domain d with the logarithmic singu larity at the infinity point from 10 we obtain that u z 1 u z 0 g ef z 3 v e z we g f e z 3 ge z 0 z e the relations 7 follow directly from the last inequalities it the future we will be needed the following equality u z 2 u z 0 2 g ef z g f e z 3 ge z 0 z e f 11 2 2 for 1 let be a level curve of the function g ef i e z c g ef z log 12 since g ef z 0 when z f and ak bk aj bj k 6 j then for some r 1 and any 1 r the set consists of exactly m noninterlaced closed components j with the property int j fj fj aj bj j 1 m set 2 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 1 r for clarification of the introduced structure see fig 1 below let v 1 2 r 3 be a neighborhood of the compact set f 1 2 with the property that 3 v 1 2 r and the element f 0 extends into the domain d r 0 3 te 0 1 tr 1 3 v 1 2 as a meromorphic single valued function f m d from that it directly follows that the error function rn z is also lifted to the point 0 and then extends from this point into the domain d as a meromorphic function rn z z d the function rn z has a zero at the point z 0 of order not less then 2 n 2 and a pole at the point z 1 of order not greater then n we suppose here for simplicity that f is a holomorphic function at the point z 1 also f can have some other poles at the points in the domain d let qs z zs where s n is fixed be a polynomial with the following property the function qsf is a holomorphic function in the domain d 1 let d d be a domain on rs r 3 f with the boundary d 2 1 r up to the end of the paper we will consider only such 1 r that qs z f z 6 0 and f z 0 f z 1 6 0 when z it is easy to see that f z 0 f z 1 6 0 we will refer to such values of as admissible values let g z u z z r 3 w it is the so called g function cf 17 44 set cf 45 6 un z log qs z rn z n 1 s g z z d 13 function un z is a subharmonic function in the domain d and is a continu ous function in a neighborhood of 2 1 r therefore by the maximum principle we have that max z un z 2 max z un z 1 1 r 14 6 sergey p suetin from the definition of un it follows the representation eun z qs z rn z e n 1 s g z thus from the definition of g function we obtain that max z 2 eun z max z qs z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z n 1 s g e f z max z qs z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z 1 n 1 s 15 max z 1 eun z max z qs z rn z 1 e n 1 s v e z n 1 s g e f z max z qs z rn z 1 e n 1 s v e z n 1 s 16 from 14 15 and 16 we easy obtain the estimate max z qs z rn z 1 e n 1 s v e z 1 2 n 1 s max z qs z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z 17 in the similar way by applying the maximum principle to the function un z we obtain the inequality for 1 2 r max z 2 qs z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z 2 n 1 s max z qs z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z 18 2 3 it is easy to check the representation rn z 1 rn z 2 qn 1 z f z 1 f z 2 qn 2 z f 2 z 1 f 2 z 2 rn z 2 f z 1 f z 2 qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 1 f z 2 19 where f z 1 f z 2 6 0 z for any admissible 1 r from 17 and 19 it easy follows that for any admissible and as n we have that max z qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 2 f z 2 e n 1 s v e z max z rn z 2 env e z 20 from maximum principle applied to the function un z it easy follows the inequal ity max z rn z 0 e n 1 s v e z 6 1 2 n 1 s max z rn z 1 e n 1 s v e z 21 from this inequality and the identity rn z 0 rn z 1 f z 0 f z 1 qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 22 we obtain that as n max z qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 e n s 1 v e z max z rn z 1 e n s 1 v e z 23 maximum principle and hermite pade polynomials 7 in the same way as above i e based on the maximum principle applied to the function un z we obtain the following relations as n max z qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 e n 1 s v e z max z rn z 1 e n 1 s v e z 24 max z qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 2 e n 1 s v e z max z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z 25 from 17 24 25 and the identity qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 2 qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 qn 2 z f z 2 f z 1 it follows that max z qn 2 z e n 1 s v e z max z rn z 2 e n 1 s v e z 26 2 4 since f is the balayage of the measure e m 1 e from the domain to the compact set f we have the identity v f z v e z g ef z const z c 27 with some constant note now that the function qs z f z 0 f z 1 is a holomorphic function in the domain from this fact and 27 it follows that the function vn z log qs z qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 n s v f z 28 is a subharmonic function in therefore by the maximum principle and taking into account that is a level curve for the green potential g e f z we obtain that for 1 2 r max z 2 qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 env e z 6 2 n max z qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 env e z 29 since the function log qn 2 z n v e z g ef z is a subharmonic function in then the following inequality holds max z 2 qn 2 z env e z 6 2 n max z qn 2 z env e z 30 note that the inequality 30 is an analog of the bernshtein walsh theorem but for the level curves of the green potential g ef z instead of the green function gs z see 45 8 sergey p suetin combining 18 26 and 30 we obtain finally that for any admissible 2 1 r and as n the following asymptotic relations valid max z 2 qn 2 z env e z 2 n max z qn 2 z env e z 31 max z 2 rn z 2 env e z 2 n max z rn z 2 env e z 32 from 31 it follows cf 45 that the sequence n degqn 2 is bounded and 1 n qn 2 f n 33 based on these results it easy to check that the sequences n degqn 0 n degqn 1 are also bounded and 1 n qn j f j 0 1 n finally from 17 and 26 we obtain the estimate lim n rn z 1 env e z 1 n 6 1 2 z 34 now let consider the function un z see 13 in the open set v 1 2 r where 3 v 1 2 r r function un z is a pice wise subharmonic function in v 1 2 r ultimately from 32 33 34 and by the three constants theorem applied to un and for any component of v 1 2 r we obtain that as n max z rn z 1 env e z 1 2 35 from this relation 24 and 33 it finally follows that qn 1 z qn 2 z f z 0 f z 1 1 n cap e 2 g e f z 1 z e 36 theorem 1 is proven 3 concluding remarks and some conjectures 3 1 let f c z w w be the element of the function w specified above and f h be the corresponding element of f let n n and p 2 n p 2 n 1 p 2 n 2 degp 2 n degp 2 n 1 degp 2 n 2 6 2 n be the corresponding type ii hermite pade polynomials for the pair of functions f f 2 and multiindex 2 n 2 n i e rn 1 z p 2 nf p 2 n 1 z o 1 zn 1 z rn 2 z p 2 nf 2 p 2 n 2 z o 1 zn 1 z 37 it would be natural to conjecture that the following statement is valid maximum principle and hermite pade polynomials 9 conjecture 1 if f c z w and f h corresponds to the w specified above then we have as n 1 n p 2 n 1 n p 2 n 1 1 n p 2 n 2 e 38 p 2 n 1 p 2 n z cap f z 0 inside d 39 p 2 n 2 p 2 n z cap f 2 z 0 inside d 40 note that since f c z w in general is a complex valued function on the real line then the powerful methods developed in the papers 13 14 and 2 are not applicable to prove the relations 38 40 in this connection see also 27 5 32 34 4 if 39 would be proven then from that and 36 it would be followed that on the base of type i and type ii hp polynomials a multi valued analytic func tion f c z w is constructively recovered on the two sheets of the rs r 3 w here we use the term constructive recovering in the sense of the paper of p henrici 15 sec 2 on that subject see 6 3 39 18 41 34 8 16 19 and the bibliography therein note that so far all the consideration in this paper were connected with the element w w 0 therefore the next question arises in a natural way when we consider as a start point the element w 1 but not the element w 0 as it was done in this paper what will be there a three sheeted rs r 3 w 1 associated by nuttall with that element w 1 and what can we say about the asymptotics of hp polynomials associated with the chosen element w 1 and with the corresponding element f 1 3 2 traditionally the problem of asymptotics of pade and hermite pade polyno mials consists of two components namely geometrical component and analytical one in the current paper we suppose the geometrical component to be trivial i e both plates of the nuttall condenser are located on the real line e f r but since f c z w is a complex valued function on the real line then the analytic component is not trivial thus the next step is very natural let suppose that in the representation 1 a more general situation is admissible i e for some j 1 m we still have that aj bj but some other j 1 m we have that aj bj r this case requires to consider the general definition of the nuttall condenser e f as it was done by e a rakhmanov and the author in 31 in 2013 see also the fig 2 namely the situation when the plate e r but it is not the case for the plate f instead it is supposed that f is symmetric with respect to the real line i e z f z f of course in any case it is supposed that e f conjecture 2 if f c z w and f h then under the assumptions of this subsection 3 2 we have the relations 8 9 and 38 40 are valid as n 10 sergey p suetin 1 1 a 1 b 1 r am bm r c 1 1 r 0 3 1 1 a 1 b 1 1 r am bm 1 r r 1 3 1 1 a 1 b 1 2 r am bm 2 r r 2 3 1 figure 1 on the figure it is
