characterize linear operators on the space of uni variate polynomials that preserve stability where a polynomial is stable with respect to a region in the complex plane if it has no zeros in stable preserving operators have proven to be important in a variety of applications ranging from statistical mechanics to combinatorics and variants of po lya schur problems involving analytic functions are im portant in applications to signal processing we present a structure theorem that bridges polynomial and analytic po lya schur problems providing constructive characterizations of stable preserving operators for a general class of domains the structure theorem facili tates the solution of open po lya schur problems in the classical setting and provides con structive characterizations of stable preserving operators in cases where previously known characterizations are non constructive in the analytic setting the structure theorem en ables the explicit characterization of minimum phase preserving operators on the half line a problem of importance in geophysical signal processing 1 introduction a univariate polynomial p c z is said to be stable with respect to a set c if it has no zeros in let s denote the set of all stable polynomials together with 0 a linear mapping a c z c z is stability preserving with respect to if a s s we denote the semigroup of all such mappings by s the general po lya schur problem is to characterize s for various c the name harkens back to work by po lya and schur on multiplier sequences in the case c r 10 recently po lya schur problems have come into prominence for a variety of applications see 12 for an overview notably in the ising model of statistical mechanics where they underpin construction of lee yang polynomials 2 11 these results rely on characterizations of s for circular domains and their boundaries presented in 3 the latter work gives two types of characterizations algebraic in which a particular class of test functions such as translates of monomials determines whether a given operator preserves stability and transcendental whereby an operator preserves stability according to whether its characteristic function belongs to a certain analytic class independently of the above developments we have studied an analytic version of a po lya schur problem in the context of the hardy hilbert space h 2 h 2 d on the unit disk mo tivated by geophysical applications 5 more precisely the classical factorization theorem for h 2 expresses an arbitrary function as a product of an inner function defined to have

only if the span of functions of the form znf z where n 0 is dense in h 2 referring to functions of the form znf z as shifted outer functions 5 constructively characterizes continuous linear operators a h 2 h 2 that preserve the class o h 2 of all shifted outer functions this is analogous to a po lya schur problem because outer functions have no zeros in the open unit disk d and hence shifted outer functions have no zeros in the punctured disk d 0 the characterization of operators that preserve shifted outer functions translates via the inverse z transform to a characterization of operators acting on causal digital signals that preserve the class of delayed minimum phase signals a property of importance for seismic recordings see 5 for full details the present paper stems from two principal objectives i to bring the classical po lya schur problems and their analytic analogues together within a common framework and ii to extend the characterization of operators preserving delayed minimum phase digital signals to operators acting on continuous signals in l 2 r where the methods of 5 are insufficient we prove a structure theorem that achieves both of these objectives and that furthermore solves an array of previously open po lya schur problems let a d denote the vector space of analytic functions on the open unit disk d given a set d let sa a d denote the family of functions having no zeros in together with 0 let sa denote the set of linear operators a c z a d such that a s d sa as with polynomials an analytic function in sa is said to be stable with respect to our main result characterizes the set sa in terms of multiplication and composition operators defined by the respective formulas m p p and c p p where p c z and a d theorem 1 structure theorem given a non empty connected open set d a linear map a c z a d has the property that a s d sa if and only if either 1 there exist a function sa and a linear functional c z c such that a f f for all f c z or 2 there exist a function sa and a non constant function a d where d such that a m c this result provides a bridge between the polynomial and analytic contexts it applies to operators preserving any class x of functions that are stable with respect to an appropriate region provided only that s x sa in 2 1 we use theorem 1 to solve the general po lya schur problem of characterizing linear operators a c z c z such that a s 1 s 2 where 1 is bounded and 2 has non empty interior theorem 2 this solves one of the open problems posed by borcea and bra nde n in 3 just as importantly it gives a constructive solution in cases where there was a known non constructive characterization of s furthermore it removes altogether the previous restriction to circular domains august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 3 in 2 2 we apply theorem 1 to the context of outer functions on the hardy hilbert spaceh 2 we characterize operators a h 2 h 2 that preserve the class of outer functions theorem 3 as well as those that preserve the class of shifted outer functions theorem 4 while the latter result was proved earlier in 5 the method of proof used there depends essentially on the fact that moment functions zn are shifted outer functions we have included an alternate proof using theorem 1 with d 0 to show that the latter result subsumes the earlier methods it turns out that in analyzing operators on the space l 2 r of causal signals with respect to a continuous time variable the class of delayed minimum phase signals corresponds to modified outer functions with respect to hardy space on the half plane see 7 this in turn can be related to h 2 but it is no longer shifted outer functions that come into play full details of the connection between minimum phase preserving operators on l 2 r and outer preserving operators on h 2 are given in 4 which is based on an earlier preprint version of the present paper our main result theorem 1 is proved in 3 the paper concludes with a brief discussion in 4 2 applications of the structure theorem in this section we apply theorem 1 to both the polynomial and analytic contexts obtaining new results in both in particular we solve the open problem a posed in 3 4 which corresponds to 1 2 d in theorem 2 below note that our notation differs from that of 3 in that they refer to the complement c as opposed to the zero free region more than this we give a constructive solution that is different from and complementary to existing algebraic or transcendental characterizations 2 1 general po lya schur problems theorem 2 suppose 1 c is bounded and 2 c has non empty interior a linear map a c z c z has the property that a s 1 s 2 if and only if either 1 there exist a linear functional c z c and a polynomial s 2 such that a f f for all f c z or 2 there exist s 2 and a non constant polynomial for which 2 1 such that a m c proof given 0 let d c z c z denote the dilation operator defined by the formula d p z p z for every p c z and every z c note that for any c d s s 1 if a c z c z is a linear operator such that a s 1 s 2 where 1 is bounded and 2 has non empty interior then there exist 0 such that 1 d and 0 and an open connected set c such that d 2 it follows that for a d 1 ad a s d s thus by theorem 1 either august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 4 1 there exist a function sa and a linear functional c z c such that a f f for all f c z or 2 there exist a function sa and a non constant function a d where d such that a m c in the former case a f d 1 f d f where d and d 1 and in the latter case a d m c d 1 m c where d and 1 d it remains to verify that s 2 and that the non constant function is a polynomial such that 2 1 this is rather straightforward if a is the zero operator then there is nothing to prove since can be taken to be the zero functional and can be taken arbitrarily in particular one may take s 2 if a is non zero of rank 1 then by hypothesis a 1 1 s 2 since 1 s 1 either 1 6 0 in which case 1 s 2 implies that s 2 or 1 0 and there exists n 0 such that zn 6 0 in the latter case fix r 0 sufficiently large that 1 rd then q z zn rn s 1 whereby aq q s 2 and q z n 6 0 it follows that s 2 thus s 2 whatever the value of 1 otherwise a m c has rank at least 2 and a 1 s 2 to see that is a polynomial such that 2 1 let z 0 c 1 so that p z z z 0 belongs to s 1 then ap s 2 where ap z z z z 0 z note that because a has rank at least 2 is not constant and so ap cannot be 0 therefore ap z 0 s 2 0 which given that s 2 implies that for all z 2 z 6 z 0 since z 0 c 1 was arbitrary it follows that for every z 2 z 1 as desired that a d is actually a polynomial follows from the fact that azn n is a polynomial for each n 0 the converse direction of the theorem is much simpler if a m c where s 2 and is a polynomial such that 2 1 then it follows immediately that a s 1 s 2 and similarly if a f f for every f c z where c z c is a linear functional 2 2 outer preserving operators on hardy space next we consider the analytic context of the hardy hilbert space h 2 h 2 d see 5 4 for details on how this relates to signal processing and in particular to geophysics let o denote the set of all outer functions in h 2 and let o denote the set of all shifted outer functions august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 5 lemma 1 a bounded linear functional h 2 c satisfies o c 0 respectively o c 0 if and only if there exist a point z 0 d respectively z 0 d 0 and a scalar c 0 such that for all f h 2 f f z 0 proof if there exist a point z 0 d and a scalar c 0 such that for all f h 2 f f z 0 then h 2 c is bounded as evaluation at a point in d is a bounded linear functional on h 2 and if f o then f z 0 6 0 since outer functions have no zeros in the interior of the unit disk similarly for the case of shifted outer functions o with z 0 d 0 for the converse implication suppose that h 2 c is a bounded linear functional such that o c 0 set n z n for each n 0 and for each d let g h 2 denote the function g z n 0 z n since is well defined and bounded the series g n 0 n n converges for every d in particular the inequality n r n holds eventually for each fixed 0 r 1 for each w c let fw denote the scaled exponential fw z e wz each fw o and therefore by hypothesis the function f w defined as f w fw n 0 n wn n is zero free moreover the eventual inequality n r n shows f to be entire of order at most 1 whence f w e w for some scalars and by hadamard s theorem it follows that n e n for each n 0 furthermore the riesz representation theorem for linear functionals implies that there exists a g h 2 such that f f g for every f h 2 august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 6 the coefficients of g z n 0 anz n are given by an z n n e n therefore g has the power series expansion g z e n 0 n zn and 1 since g h 2 thus f g e f setting z 0 and e this shows that f f z 0 as desired the case where o c 0 is similar except that the fact that z o implies that z e 6 0 whereby d 0 theorem 3 let a h 2 h 2 be a bounded linear operator such that a o o then there exist an analytic function d d and a function o such that a m c proof since c z h 2 a d and s d o sa d the hypothesis of the theorem implies that the restriction of a to polynomials is a linear operator of the form a c z a d such that a s d sa d thus theorem 1 applies with d and hence either 1 there exist a function s d and a linear functional c z c such that a f f for every f c z or 2 there exist a function s d and a non constant analytic function d d such that a m c in case 1 the hypothesis that o o implies that o and o c 0 since a is bounded this implies in turn that h 2 c is a bounded linear functional since f f for each f h 2 therefore by lemma 1 the linear functional is proportional to evaluation at a point for every f h 2 f f z 0 for some z 0 d and some non zero c thus letting d d denote the constant function z z 0 and setting the rank 1 operator a has the form a m c in conformity with the conclusion of the present theorem in case 2 where a has the form m c the fact that 1 o implies that a 1 o giving the desired conclusion once again the following fact about shifted outer functions which is needed for the proof of theorem 4 follows easily from the standard integral representation for outer functions see 9 august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 7 proposition 2 let f g h 2 if f o and fg o then g o theorem 4 see 5 let a h 2 h 2 be a bounded linear operator such that a o o then there exist functions o where d d such that a m c proof the proof is very similar to that of theorem 3 setting d 0 note that s d o sa thus the hypothesis of the theorem implies that a c z a d with a s d sa theorem 1 therefore implies that either 1 there exist a function s d and a linear functional c z c such that a f f for all f c z or 2 there exist a function s d and a non constant function a d where d such that a m c in case 1 as in the proof of theorem 3 above lemma 1 yields that the linear functional is proportional to evaluation at a point for every f h 2 f f for some and some non zero c with the difference that 6 0 as per the part of lemma 1 pertaining to o as before letting d d denote the constant function z and setting the rank 1 operator a has the form a m c where the non zero constant function belongs to o in case 2 where a has the form m c the fact that 1 o implies that a 1 o and the identity function f z z belongs to o so af o also by proposition 2 this implies that o since a d is analytic the property d given by theorem 1 implies further that d d completing the proof 3 proof of the structure theorem hadamard s theorem 1 thm 8 or 8 ch i 10 applied to entire functions of exponential type provides a key analytic tool used to prove theorem 1 for present purposes an entire function f c c is of exponential type if f z ce z for some c 0 8 serves as an essential reference on the subject such functions are sometimes also referred to as having order 1 see 6 hadamard s theorem constrains the weierstrass product form of what we call the characteristic functions defined later in this section of a given operator a c z a d preserving stability in the sense of theorem 1 this in turn allows us to determine the precise structure of the operator itself our argument makes essential use of both the first and second characteristic functions whereas versions of the first characteristic function appear elsewhere in the literature it appears that the second characteristic function has not been previously august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 8 recognized as important before hadamard s theorem can be applied we need first to infer some basic consequences of the hypothesis that a s d sa on the moments of a a linear map a c z a d is evidently determined by its action on monomials zn thus for each n 0 denote the nth moment of a by n a z n for the remainder of the present section denotes a connected open subset of d unless the contrary is explicitly stated it turns out that for a sa either all the moments n lie on a single complex line or else for each z the numbers n z are bounded uniformly in n this dichotomy is expressed in detail by the following two propositions proposition 3 suppose a sa and that 0 is identically zero then there exists a d such that n c for every n 0 i e the operator a has rank at most 1 proof if a is not the zero operator then for some n 1 the nth moment n is not identically zero since is analytic and contains a condensation point there exists a point at which 6 0 given an arbitrary m there is a choice of a c such that m a 0 whereby the function m a is not stable note that for any c with a 1 the polynomial p z zm azn is d stable therefore since a sa ap m a is either stable or identically 0 the former possibility has been ruled out forcing m a thus each of the moments of a lies in the line c if all its moments are scalar multiples of a fixed function then the operator a has rank 1 and has the form ap p where c z c is a linear functional this represents the degenerate case of the main structure theorem the following proposition addresses the non degenerate case proposition 4 suppose a sa and that a has rank at least 2 then for each n 1 the nth moment of a is subject to the following bounds 1 if n 6 c 0 then n z 0 z 1 for every z 2 if n c 0 then n 0 3 proof since a has rank greater than 1 it follows from proposition 3 that 0 is not identically 0 and 0 is therefore stable since 1 s d and a sa suppose that n 6 c 0 for some fixed n 1 and let be arbitrary note that for a c d the polynomial p z a zn is d stable therefore ap a 0 n is either stable or identically zero but n 6 c 0 so the latter possibility is ruled out since the august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 9 value a n 0 renders ap unstable it follows that n 0 d and hence that n 0 proving part 1 next suppose that n 0 for some c by proposition 3 there exists an m 1 for which m 6 c 0 since a has rank at least two let and set a m 0 then a 1 by part 1 above and so the polynomial p z a zm zn is d stable as long as 3 but ap a 0 0 m n a 0 m which has a zero at and is not identically zero therefore p cannot be stable forcing 3 this proves part 2 for integers j 1 define the jth characteristic function of a sa by the formula fj z w n 0 nj z wn n 1 note that the subscript nj on the right hand side of 1 denotes a product not a pair of indices in the present paper only the cases j 1 2 are needed proposition 5 the following statements hold for any a sa of rank at least 2 and any j 1 1 with respect to w the characteristic function fj z w is an entire function of exponential type and fj z w is analytic with respect to z 2 if fj z 0 w 0 0 for some z 0 w 0 c then fj z w 0 0 for all z moreover the order of w 0 as a zero of f z w is independent of z proof for fixed z the function fj z w is entire in w by the bound jn z 3 0 z that it has order at most 1 follows from the estimate fj z w 3 0 z e w for each compact subset k the function 0 is bounded on k whence the functions n are uniformly bounded on k by proposition 4 so for fixed w the series 1 is uniformly cauchy on k and thus the series converges to an analytic function in z proving part 1 fix w 0 c and set n z n m 0 w 0 z k m m the nth partial sum of the taylor series expansion of ew 0 z k as ew 0 z k is bounded away from zero on the closed disk and the partial sums converge uniformly on this disk the n are eventually d stable the images a n are either stable or identically zero and converge uniformly to august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 10 fj z w 0 if fj z w 0 is not identically zero it can be written as a limit of a subsequence of stable functions a n and thus by hurwitz s theorem fj z w 0 has no zeros at all in to see that the order of each zero is independent of z fix a point w 0 in the set ej w c fj z w 0 choose a circular path in c centred at w 0 of sufficiently small radius that every other member of ej lies strictly outside since fj z w is analytic in z the order of the zero w 0 given by the integer valued function z 1 2 i fj w z w fj z w dw is continuous and therefore constant since is connected based on proposition 5 let ej denote the sequence of zeros distinct from 0 w c w 6 0 fj z w 0 listed according to multiplicity thus ej may be empty finite or countably infinite let j 0 denote the order of w 0 as a zero of fj z w in what follows we adopt the convention that products indexed by the empty set denote the constant function 1 proposition 6 suppose that a sa has rank at least 2 then the first two characteristic functions have the form f 1 z w q 1 w e z w 1 z f 2 z w q 2 w e z w 2 z where 1 is non constant and where q 1 and q 2 are entire of the form q 1 w n 0 cnw n with c 0 1 and c 1 0 q 2 w n 0 dnw n with d 0 1 proof by proposition 5 fj z w is entire of order at most 1 as a function in w for j 1 2 hadamard s theorem implies that the genus of fj z w as a function in w is either 0 or 1 if fj has genus 0 then wn ej 1 wn 2 and the canonical weierstrass product representation of fj has the form fj z w e j z w j wn ej 1 w wn 3 if fj has genus 1 then either 2 holds and fj has canonical weierstrass product of the form fj z w e j z j z w w j wn ej 1 w wn 4 august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 11 where j z 6 0 or wn ej 1 wn and wn ej 1 wn 2 and fj has canonical weierstrass product of the form fj z w e j z j z w w j wn ej e w wn 1 w wn 5 see 1 ch 5 2 3 since 2 implies wn ej 1 wn 2 and hence that the product wn ej e w wn 1 w wn converges uniformly on compact sets if fj has canonical product 4 it may be represented also by the non canonical formula fj z w e j z j z j w w j wn ej e w wn 1 w wn 6 where j wn ej 1 wn after relabeling this conforms to 5 it is the representation that we shall analyze below thus to summarize hadamard s theorem implies that the characteristic function fj may be represented by a weierstrass product of the form 3 or 5 proposition 5 also guarantees that the zeros wn including their multiplicities and the indices j do not depend on z of course the values j and j appearing in the weierstrass products may depend on z in fact the index j 0 for j 1 2 to see this note that by definition fj z 0 0 since a has rank at least 2 it follows from proposition 3 that 0 is not identically 0 according to the formulas 3 and 5 fj z 0 qj 0 e z which is non zero only if qj 0 6 0 whereby j 0 the given weierstrass product formulas then yield that qj 0 1 which proves that c 0 d 0 1 and that 0 e j from which it follows that 1 2 we thus drop the subscripts writing 1 2 comparing the taylor series expansion of 3 with respect to w to the definition 1 of the characteristic function f 1 shows the moments of a all to be multiples of e z whereby a has rank 1 therefore f 1 z w has the form 5 since a has rank at least 2 if 1 z is constant than a is again seen to have rank 1 so 1 z is non constant since the coefficient of w in the taylor expansion of each elementary factor e w wn 1 w wn is 0 the coefficient c 1 of w is necessarily 0 in the expansion of q 1 w allowing 2 0 the formulation f 2 z w q 2 w e w w 2 z covers both possibilities 3 and 5 for j 2 hadamard s theorem itself guarantees that each qj w is entire august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 12 it will be convenient to normalize the moments of a by dividing by 0 to this end we define n n 0 for each n 0 with this notation we have that fj z w 0 z n 0 nj z wn n 7 and also that f 1 z w 0 z q 1 w e w 1 z n 0 cnw n n 0 1 z nw n n n 0 n n j 0 cn j 1 z j j w n n 8 f 2 z w 0 z q 2 w e w 2 z n 0 n n j 0 dn j 2 z j j w n n 9 we will show that the only way 8 and 9 can be consistent with 7 is if q 1 1 is constant proposition 7 suppose that a sa has rank at least 2 then the first characteristic function of a has the form f 1 z w e z w z proof to begin consider 2 z according to 7 this is the coefficient of w 2 2 in 8 and the coefficient of w in 9 thus we have 2 z 2 c 2 1 z 2 d 1 2 z it is not possible for 2 z d 1 2 z to be independent of z since this contradicts the assertion in proposition 6 that 1 z is non constant this shows that 2 is also not constant it follows further that d 1 0 just as c 1 0 in the proof of proposition 6 since the weierstrass product form for f 2 z w involves only even powers of w if 2 is non constant thus 2 z 2 c 2 1 z 2 the next step is to consider 4 z in light of the facts that d 1 0 and 2 z 2 c 2 1 z 2 on one hand 4 is the coefficient of w 4 4 in 8 so 4 z 4 c 4 c 3 1 z c 2 1 z 2 2 1 z 4 4 10 on the other hand 4 is the coefficient of w 2 2 in 9 whereby 4 z 2 d 2 2 z 2 2 2 d 2 2 c 2 1 z 2 2 2 2 d 2 4 c 2 2 4 c 2 1 z 2 1 z 4 11 august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 13 comparing coefficients of 1 z 2 between 10 and 11 yields that c 2 0 therefore 2 2 1 we shall henceforth drop the subscript and write in place of 1 and 2 in place of 2 having established that 2 z z 2 it is a straightforward matter to infer that q 1 1 by comparing coefficients between 8 and 9 as follows for each n 1 2 n is the coefficient of w 2 n 2 n in 8 and the coefficient of wn n in 9 thus 2 n z 2 n c 2 n c 2 n 1 z z 2 n 2 n 12 n dn dn 1 z 2 z 2 n n 13 and 2 n 2 z 2 n 2 c 2 n 2 c 2 n 1 z z 2 n 2 2 n 2 14 n 1 dn 1 dn z 2 z 2 n 2 n 1 15 comparing the coefficients of the first power of z in 12 with that in 13 reveals that c 2 n 1 0 comparing constant terms between the same two formulas shows that 2 n c 2 n n dn while comparison of the coefficients of z 2 between 14 and 15 reveals that 2 n 2 c 2 n 2 n 1 dn the unique solution to these latter two equations is c 2 n dn 0 this proves that cn dn 0 for every n 1 whereby q 1 1 as claimed thus f 1 z w e z w z by proposition 6 theorem 1 may be proved using proposition 7 as follows since f 1 z w e z w z comparison to 1 shows that the moments of a have the form n z e z z n 16 for z in particular for all z 0 z e z and 1 z e z z setting 1 0 17 it follows that is a meromorphic extension of from to the disk d moreover for every z n z 0 z z n 18 by equation 16 since contains a condensation point and both n and 0 n are meromor phic in d for every n 0 the equation 18 extends to d furthermore since n is analytic cannot have any poles in d since otherwise n too would have poles for sufficiently large n august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 14 by 18 thus sa since is non constant for a of rank at least 2 by proposition 6 17 and part 1 of proposition 4 imply that d since a is determined by its moments it follows from 18 and the subsequent remarks that if a has rank at least two a m c where 0 sa a d is non constant and d the only remaining possibility for a non zero operator a sa is that it have rank 1 in which case it has the structure indicated in item 1 of theorem 1 conversely any operator corresponding to items 1 or 2 of theorem 1 is easily verified to belong to sa this completes the proof of theorem 1 4 conclusions sections 2 1 and 2 2 illustrate the depth and scope of our main structure theorem as a bridge between classical po lya schur problems and analogous analytic problems on one hand the orem 1 facilitates the resolution of a basic question in geophysical signal processing motivated by practical applications and on the other hand the same theorem sheds new light on the basic theory of po lya schur problems in the classical setting the results in 2 2 make it possible to characterize explicitly the operators on l 2 r that preserve the class of delayed minimum phase signals a minimum phase signal f l 2 r is one that maximizes partial energy t 0 f t 2 dt among all functions having the same power spectrum as f for all t 0 full details of this characterization and its relevance to seismic signal processing are laid out in 4 several remarks are in order concerning the implications of theorem 2 for general po lya schur problems firstly the conclusion of the theorem is constructive being formulated ex plicitly in terms of product composition operators of the form m c by contrast consider 3 cor 3 which characterizes sa in the case d in algebraic terms as follows theorem 5 from corollary 3 in 3 a linear map a c z c z satisfies a s d s d if and only if either 1 there exist a linear functional c z c and a polynomial s d such that a f f for every f c z or 2 letting fw n z 1 wz n the polynomial afw n is d stable for every w d and n 0 in other words letting m denote the set of polynomials m fw n w d and n 0 theorem 5 reduces the case 1 2 d to the non trivial problem of determining all linear op erators a c z c z such that a m s d theorem 2 solves the latter problem explicitly thus providing complementary information in cases where there is a known characterization apart from giving constructive solutions in cases where there are known non constructive characterizations theorem 2 solves the previously open case of 1 2 d as well as the array of cases where 1 and 2 do not correspond to circular regions or their boundaries a final remark concerns the general po lya schur problem of characterizing sa for c theorem 2 implies that if is bounded with non empty interior then sa consists only of rank 1 operators and product composition operators it is clear for example that if c is convex then sa includes differential operators by the gauss lucas theorem which are august 28 2015 pc gibson mp lamoureux po lya schur problems 15 not rank 1 and are not expressible as product composition operators but there is a substantial gap between non convexity of c and being bounded with non empty interior and it remains an open question to characterize precisely all regions c such that sa consists exclusively of rank 1 operators and product composition operators acknowledgements research for the present paper was supported by nserc discovery grants
