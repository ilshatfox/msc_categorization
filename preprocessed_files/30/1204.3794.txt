some function spaces on the complex plane c x c for which the quasiregular solutions of the beltrami equation f z z f z have first derivatives locally in x c provided that the beltrami coefficient belongs to x c key words quasiregular mappings beltrami equation sobolev spaces 1 introduction a function f c c is called quasiregular if it belongs to the sobolev space w 1 2 loc c functions with distributional first order derivatives locally in l 2 and sat isfies the beltrami equation f z z f z a e z c 1 where called the beltrami coefficient of f is a lebesgue measurable function on the complex plane c satisfying 1 if in addition f is a homeomorphism then we say that f is quasiconformal quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings are a central tool in modern geometric function theory and have had strong impact in other areas it is well known that quasiregular functions are locally in some ho lder class mori s theorem and moreover they actually belong to w 1 p loc for some p 2 in this paper we are interested in studying how the regularity of the beltrami coefficient affects the regularity of the solutions of 1 thus if the beltrami coefficient belongs to the ho lder class c l s 0 s 1 using schauder estimates see for instance aim chapter 15 then quasiregular functions belong to c l 1 s loc for the borderline cases s 0 and s 1 the c l 1 s regularity fails e g aim p 390 if w 1 p 2 p then one can read in ahlfors book ah p 56 the result that quasiregular functions are locally in w 2 p the cases w 1 p p 2 were studied in cfmoz for instance when p 2 one gets that the solutions are locally in w 2 q for every q 2 1 http arxiv org abs 1204 3794 v 1 our goal in this work is to present some function spaces x for which all quasireg ular solutions of 1 have first derivatives locally in x provided that the beltrami coefficient belongs to x these function spaces will enjoy the additional property of being an algebra that is the product of two functions in x is again in x and this feature will play an important role in our arguments we deal with triebel lizorkin spaces f sp q c and besov spaces b s p q c with s 0 1 p 1 q and sp 2 let asp q c denote any of these function spaces with the indices as we have determined in any case the condition sp 2 ensures that we have bounded continuous functions and multiplication algebras e g rs 4 6 4 in section 2 we will give the precise definitions of these function spaces involved in the statement of the our first theorem theorem 1 suppose that asp q c is compactly supported with k 1 then any f w 1 2 loc c satisfying the beltrami equation 1 has first derivatives locally in asp q c when the beltrami coefficient is compactly supported there is a unique w 1 2 loc c solution of 1 normalized by the condition z o 1 z near moreover it is a homeomorphism of the complex plane it is called the principal solution of 1 by stoilow s factorization theorem e g aim section 5 5 for any quasiregular function f there exists a holomorphic function h such that f h where is the associated principal solution therefore we will only concentrate on principal solutions as is well known is given explicitly by the formula aim p 165 z z c h z where the operator ch z 1 c h z w 1 w dw 2 is the cauchy transform of h when h lp 1 p one has the identity c h h consequently our theorem immediately follows from next proposition proposition 1 suppose that is compactly supported with k 1 and z z c h z is the principal solution of the beltrami equation 1 let s 0 1 p 1 q and sp 2 if asp q c then h a s p q c sketch of the proof the beurling transform is the principal value convo lution operator bf z 1 p v c f z w 1 w 2 dw the fourier multiplier of b is or in other words b f f 2 thus b is an isometry on l 2 c and is well known that b as any caldero n zygmund convolution operator is bounded on asp q c recall the relation between the cauchy and the beurling transforms c b thus 1 b h and h and consequently the function h is determined by the equation i b h so we only need to invert the beltrami operator i b on the corresponding function space this task is completed in section 3 for the critical case sp 2 we consider a riesz potential space i 1 l 2 1 c the set of functions with first order derivatives in the lorentz space l 2 1 c even though close to l 2 the lorentz space l 2 1 c is strictly contained in l 2 this small improvement on the derivatives allows us to have continuous functions vanishing at infinity by the way remind that functions with first order derivatives in l 2 may not be continuous proposition 2 suppose that i 1 l 2 1 c is compactly supported with k 1 and z z c h z is the principal solution of the beltrami equation 1 then h i 1 l 2 1 c as we mentioned ago proposition 2 does not hold when the beltrami coefficient only has first derivatives in l 2 however the analogous result would remain valid if we replace i 1 l 2 1 c by is l 2 s 1 c 0 s 2 the main result of mov identifies a class of non smooth beltrami coefficients which determine bilipschitz quasiconformal mappings in particular one proved the following result theorem mov let be a bounded domain of c with boundary of class c 1 0 1 and let c 0 with 1 let z z c h z be the principal solution of the beltrami equation 1 then h c 0 for any and moreover is billipschitz now we replace the ho lder smoothness of the beltrami coefficient by a sobolev or besov condition restricted on a domain see definitions in the next section theorem 2 let 0 s 1 and 1 p such that sp 2 and let be a bounded domain of c with boundary of class c 1 suppose that is supported in with k 1 and z z c h z is the principal solution of the beltrami equation 1 1 if w s p then h w s p 2 if bsp p then h b s p p 3 the proof runs in parallel to that of the above propositions but now a new ob stacle appears the boundedness of the beurling transform on w s p or bsp p in general it is not clear if caldero n zygmund convolution operators are bounded on w s p or bsp p of course the answer depends on the operator and on the boundary of the domain we will study this question in domains of rn n 2 in rn we consider the kernel k x x x n x 6 0 where is a homogeneous function of degree 0 with zero integral on the unit sphere and c 1 sn 1 then the singular integral tf x p v f y k x y dy is bounded on lp rn 1 p really the condition c 1 sn 1 could be weakened but it is enough for our purpose on the other hand sobolev spaces w s p rn f sp 2 r n are described as spaces of bessel potentials that is f w s p if and only if f gs g where gs denotes the bessel kernel of order s and g l p e g st chapter 5 remember that the bessel kernel of order s gs is the l 1 function with fourier transform 1 2 s 2 then because t is a convolution operator one has the identity t f t gs g gs tg and one gets the boundedness of t on w s p 1 p but if one takes f w s p a domain of rn then t f x p v f y k x y dy clearly belongs to lp however perhaps t f w s p for instance let q denote a rectangle in c and q denote its characteristic function a computation shows that the beurling transform of q b q has logarithmic singularities at the vertices of the rectangle and therefore its first derivatives belong to lp q only if p 2 e g aim p 147 for positive results we restrict our attention to operators with even kernel that is k x k x in section 4 we will deal with theorem 3 theorem 3 let be a bounded domain of rn with boundary of class c 1 0 and let t be an even smooth homogeneous caldero n zygmund operator 1 if t b s p p 0 s 1 n sp then t b s p p b s p p 2 if t w s p 0 s 1 n sp then t w s p w s p 3 if t w 1 p n p then t w 1 p w 1 p in any case the norm operator depends on the domain and the caldero n zygmund constant of the kernel of t see 7 for the definition 4 the result reduces the study of the boundedness of the operator t to the be haviour of t on the function thus we have a necessary and sufficient condition of type t 1 in the proof of theorem 3 we follow the same method of y meyer in me where he studied the continuity of generalised caldero n zygmund operators on sobolev spaces w s p rn since t is bounded on lp using complex and real interpolation one could think that items 1 and 2 of the above theorem are a consequence of the third one but this it not the case because the conditions on items 1 and 2 are weaker than t w 1 p when is a bounded domain of rn with boundary of class c 1 0 s 1 and n sp then t is bounded onw s p and bsp p see de tails in section 4 in particular the assumptions on the domain in the statement of theorem 2 are to ensure that the beurling transform is bounded on the corre sponding function space recently v cruz and x tolsa ct to have showed that if the outward unit normal n on belongs to the besov space b s 1 p p p then b w s p in section 2 we shall introduce some basic notation and set up some necessary preliminaries the proof of proposition 1 and proposition 2 are in section 3 in section 4 we study even smooth homogeneous caldero n zygmund operators on do mains the proof of the theorem 2 is explained in section 5 as usual the letter c will denote a constant which may be different at each occurrence and which is independent of the relevant variables under consideration 2 preliminaries we start reviewing some basic facts concerning triebel lizorkin spaces and besov spaces let s rn be the usual schwartz class of rapidly decreasing c functions and g stands for the fourier transform of g let s rn with 1 if 1 and 0 if 3 2 we set 0 and j 2 j 2 j 1 j n since j 0 j 1 for all r n the j form a dyadic resolution of unity then for f l 1 loc r n 1 p q and s 0 one defines the norms f bs p q j 0 2 js j f q p 1 q and f f s p q j 0 2 js j f q 1 q p the besov space bsp q r n consists of the functions such that f bs p q while the functions in the triebel lizorkin space f sp q r n are those such that f f s p q 5 the spaces f sp 2 1 p are known as sobolev spaces of fractional order or bessel potential spaces and we prefer denote them by w s p since p 1 and q 1 both bsp q and f s p q are banach spaces a systematic treatment of these spaces may be found in tri 1 rs and gr chapter 6 a remarkable fact when sp n is that bsp q and f s p q form an algebra with respect to pointwise multiplication that is f g as p q c f as p q g as p q 3 where asp q denotes the corresponding besov space or triebel lizorkin space e g rs 4 6 4 moreover functions in these spaces satisfy some ho lder condition and so they are continuous functions with f c f as p q we say that a bounded domain rn has a boundary of class c 1 if is a c 1 hyper surface whose unit normal vector satisfies a lipschitz ho lder condition of order as a function on the surface to state an alternative condition for x x 1 xn r n we use the notation x x xn where x x 1 xn 1 then has a boundary of class c 1 if for each point a one may find a ball b a r and a function xn x of class c 1 such that after a rotation if necessary b a r is the part of b a r lying below the graph of thus we get b a r x b a r xn x 1 xn 1 4 we say that is a bounded lipschitz domain if the function in 4 is of class c 0 1 in general if one has a function space x defined on rn and a domain rn one defines the space x as the restrictions of functions of x from rn to in addition the restriction space is endowed with the quasi norm quotient in the cases that we are considering we have an intrinsic characterization of elements of x we will use these characterizations in the proofs of theorems 2 and 3 let be a bounded lipschitz domain in rn 1 p and 0 s 1 then 1 f bsp p if and only if f l p and f x f y p x y n sp dxdy e g tar p 169 2 f w s p if and only if f lp and f x f y 2 x y n 2 s dx p 2 dy 5 e g str p 1051 6 3 f w 1 p if and only if f lp and lim 0 f x f y p x y n p dxdy 6 e g br 2 p 703 a smooth of class c 1 homogeneous caldero n zygmund operator is a principal value convolution operator of type t f x p v f y k x y dy where k x x x n x 6 0 x being a homogeneous function of degree 0 continuously differentiable on rn 0 and with zero integral on the unit sphere note that one trivially has k x y c x y n and k x y k x y c y y x y n 1 whenever x y 2 y y the caldero n zygmund constant of the kernel of t is defined as t cz k x x n k x x n 1 7 the operator t is said to be even if the kernel is even namely if x x for all x 6 0 the even character of t gives the cancellation t b b 0 for each ball b which should be understood as a local version of the global cancellation property t 1 0 common to all smooth homogeneous caldero n zygmund operators this extra cancellation property is essential for proving lemma 5 and so theorem 3 it is well known that caldero n zygmund convolution operators are bounded on lp rn and also on w s p rn because w s p gs l p using the method of real interpolation one easily gets that these operators are also bounded on bsp q r n see also gr 6 7 2 for a direct proof the boundedness of caldero n zygmund convolution operators on f sp q r n was proved in ftw theorem 3 7 see jhl theorem 1 2 for a nice proof summarizing if s 0 and 1 p q we have tf as p q c f as p q 8 where c is a constant which depends on s p q n and t cz 7 lorentz spaces are defined on measure spaces y m but we only need the case y c and m is the lebesgue planar measure the classical definition of lorentz spaces use the rearrangement function for any measurable function f we define its nonincreasing rearrangement by f t inf s m z c f z s t for 1 p q the lorentz space lp q c is the set of functions f such that f lp q with f lp q c 0 t 1 pf t qt 1 dt 1 q for 1 q supt 0 t 1 pf t for q a second definition of lorentz spaces which is equivalent to the first one is given by real interpolation between lebesgue spaces lp 0 lp 1 q l p q where 1 p 0 p p 1 1 q 0 1 and 1 p 1 p 0 p 1 lorentz spaces inherited from lebesgue spaces the stability property of the multiplication by bounded function that is if f l and g lp q then fg lp q and we have fg lp q f g lp q 9 let 1 p q and consider 0 2 the lorentz potential space i l p q c is the set of functions f such that f i g where g l p q c and i x c x 2 is the riesz potential of order the norm in this space is given by f i lp q c g lp q note that when 1 one has f i 1 lp q c f lp q it is well known st 2 that functions f of i 1 l 2 1 c are continuous and there exists a constant c such that f c f i 1 l 2 1 c 10 in general i l 2 1 c are embedded in c 0 the space of continuous functions van ishing at the infinity see ba again a remarkable property of these spaces i l 2 1 c is that they are multiplication algebras that is fg i l 2 1 c f i l 2 1 g i l 2 1 11 finally note that caldero n zygmund convolution operators are bounded on lp q rn and so also on lorentz potential space i l p q c with constant de pending on 7 8 3 invertibility of the beltrami operator as we mentioned in the introduction to prove proposition 1 and then theorem 1 and proposition 2 we only have to consider the invertibility of the beltrami operator i b on asp q c and on i 1 l 2 1 c following the idea of iwaniec iw p 42 43 we define pm i b b m so that we have i b pn 1 pn 1 i b i b n i nbn k where k nbn b n can be easily seen to be a finite sum of operators that contain as a factor the commutator b b b in lemma 2 and in lemma 3 we will prove that b is compact on asp q c and on i 1 l 2 1 c so that k is also compact in lemma 1 we will check that the operator norm of nbn on asp q c and on i 1 l 2 1 c is small if n is large therefore i b is a fredholm operator on asp q c and on i 1 l 2 1 c clearly i t b 0 t 1 is a continuous path from the identity to i b by the index theory of fredholm operators on banach spaces e g sch the index is a continuous function of the operator hence i b has index 0 on the other hand i b is injective on asp q c and on i 1 l 2 1 c because by iw p 43 it is injective on lp c for all 1 p that concludes that i b is invertible lemma 1 a the operator norm of nbn on asp q c is small if n is large b the operator norm of nbn on i 1 l 2 1 c is small if n is large proof let bn 1 nn z n 1 zn 1 the kernel of iterated beurling transform bn then the caldero n zygmund constant of bn is bn z z 2 bn z z 3 cn 2 a it is an easy consequence of well known results since gm as p q c g m 1 g asp q see rs teorem 5 3 2 4 using 3 and 8 we have nbn f as p q c n as p q bn f as p q c n as p q n 2 f as p q c n 2 n 1 asp q f asp q and the norm becomes small if n is big enough because k 1 b using f i 1 l 2 1 f l 2 1 11 9 and the boundedness of caldero n zygmund convolution operators we have nbn f i 1 l 2 1 c n i 1 l 2 1 b n f i 1 l 2 1 c n i 1 l 2 1 n 2 f i 1 l 2 1 c n 3 n 1 i 1 l 2 1 f i 1 l 2 1 9 and the norm becomes small if n is big enough because k 1 lemma 2 the commutator b is compact on asp q c proof first we have b f as p q bf b f as p q as p q bf as p q c f as p q c as p q f as p q and so the commutator is bounded in asp q using that the limit of compact operators is a compact operator we can assume that c c c with its support contained in the disk d 0 r now we use a trick from aim p 145 consider an arbitrary function g c f with f asp q where c f denotes the cauchy transform of f see 2 as g b f g f and b g g b f b f g b g g b g b g g g b g b g g b c f c f from this representation one can see that b is compact given c c d 0 r the operator c f is a compact operator on asp q c because by the lifting property see rs 2 1 4 c f as 1 p q c obviously c f z 0 if z r and the inclusion of as 1 p q d 0 r into a s p q d 0 r is compact e g rs 2 4 4 lemma 3 the commutator b is compact on i 1 l 2 1 c proof as above we have b f i 1 l 2 1 bf b f i 1 l 2 1 i 1 l 2 1 bf i 1 l 2 1 c f i 1 l 2 1 c i 1 l 2 1 f i 1 l 2 1 12 and so the commutator is bounded in i 1 l 2 1 so by density we only need to prove the compactness of the commutator when c c on the other hand b f i 1 l 2 1 2 j 1 j b f b f l 2 1 2 j 1 j b f b jf l 2 1 2 j 1 j b f l 2 1 b jf l 2 1 10 since the commutator is a compact operator in lp when is smooth u and using real interpolation of compact operators cop we have that b l 2 1 c l 2 1 c is compact therefore we only have to prove that a b i 1 l 2 1 c l 2 1 c is a com pact operator when a c c b 0 r for some r 0 given 0 we consider a regularization of the beurling transform b f z 1 p v f z w k w dw where k z z z 2 and 0 z 1 is a radial c function satisfying z 0 if z 2 and z 1 if z it is easy to check that b is a convolution caldero n zygmund operator with constants depending on in the rest of this proof we will use the estimate 10 without any mention for any f i 1 l 2 1 the function a b b f has compact support on the other hand a b b f z 1 a z a y 1 z y 2 z y z y 2 f y dy c f a z y 1 z y dy c f i 1 l 2 1 a consequently the operator a b tends to a b when 0 to prove that a b i 1 l 2 1 l 2 1 is compact we will use fre chet kolgomorov theorem for lorentz spaces e g br 1 p 111 for lp spaces by 12 the image by a b of the unit ball of i 1 l 2 1 c is uniformly bounded in l 2 1 c to get the equicontinuity take f i 1 l 2 1 and z w 8 then a b f z a b f w 1 a z a w c z z 2 f d 1 c z z 2 w w 2 a w a f d 1 z w 2 z w since b is a convolution caldero n zygmund operator 1 z w 1 a z a w b f z c z w a f i 1 l 2 1 11 and 2 z w 1 c b z 4 z z 2 w w 2 a w a f d c z w f a z 8 1 z 3 d 2 z 8 z 2 d c z w f i 1 l 2 1 therefore a b f z a b f w c z w f i 1 l 2 1 13 where the constant c depends on a and on the other hand if z m 2 r a b f z c a z a w z w z w 2 f w dw f a w r 1 z w 2 dw c f i 1 l 2 1 a 1 z 2 and then a b f c b 0 m l 2 1 c f i 1 l 2 1 a 1 z 2 c b 0 m l 2 1 14 which tends to 0 as m 0 combining 13 and 14 by fre chet kolgomorov the orem for lorentz spaces one gets that a b is a compact operator from i 1 l 2 1 c to l 2 1 c as we desired 4 caldero n zygmund operators on domains in this section we will prove theorem 3 let x denote any of function spaces in the statement of theorem 3 and let f x it is clear from the caldero n zygmund theory that t f l p so in order to study the behaviour of t on x we must deal with t f x t f y because we have a characterization of x using first differences following me we consider the next decomposition lemma 4 let c c such that u 1 on u 2 and u 0 if u 4 define u 1 u then t f y t f x 4 i 1 gi x y f x t y t x 12 where g 1 x y k y

prove let b b x 0 r be the ball in r n of center x 0 and radius r and b denotes a smooth function supported in b such that b 1 and b r 1 to deal with the term g 4 we will use the next lemma which is an application of the main lemma of mov lemma 5 let be a bounded domain of rn with boundary of class c 1 0 and let t be an even smooth homogeneous caldero n zygmund operator then there exists a constant c c such that t b c proof since the c 0 norm of b is bounded by 1 r by the main lemma of mov we have t b x c 1 r for all x c and t b x t b y cr x y x y 13 associated to the domain there is a r 0 0 satisfying 4 then if 3 r r 0 one has t b x c 1 3 r 0 for all x c if 3 r r 0 we write t b x k x y b y dy 3 b k x y b y dy 3 b k x y b y b x dy b x 3 b k x y dy p x q x for p x we have p x c 3 b b x b y x y n dy c b 3 b dy x y n 1 c if x b q x 0 and for x b one can prove 3 b k x y dy c proceeding as in the proof of the main lemma of mov p 408 410 observe that for x b the function t 3 b has the same behaviour that t 1 t let s continuous with the proof of theorem 3 in the case that f bsp p 0 s 1 n sp we have to prove that t f x t f y p x y n sp dxdy 15 by lemma 4 t f y t f x 4 i 1 gi x y f x

mov main lemma t x t y c x y x y therefore t belongs to w s p and bsp p for any s 0 16 5 proof of the theorem 2 consider the beurling transform restricted on the domain of class c 1 b g z 1 g w z w 2 dw by mov main lemma b z b w c z w for all z w now applying theorem 3 we have that b is bounded on the spaces b s p p and w s p let s denote by x any of these two spaces we will show that the beltrami operator i b is invertible on x then taking h i b 1 we get the conclusions as in the proof of the proposition 1 we claim that i b is a fredholm operator on x define pm i b b m so that i b pm 1 pm 1 i b i m b m r where r m b m b m can be easily seen to be a finite sum of operators that contain the commutator b as a factor we will prove that b x x is a compact operator on the other hand for z i m b m f z i m bm f z m z bm f z b mf z i m bm f z m z kmf z where bm is the m iterated beurling transform and kmf b m f b mf as in the proof of lemma 1 if f x we get mf x c m m 1 x f x 16 remind that the kernel of bm is 1 mmz m 1 zm 1 and then by theorem 3 if f x we have bm f x c m 2 f x 17 consequently combining 16 and 17 m bm f x c m 3 m 1 x f x which implies that i m bm is invertible if m is large assume for a moment that the operatorskm are compacts on x thus i b is a fredholm operator and in addition has index zero since x lp we also have that i b is injective see iw and therefore invertible on x the compactness of the operators b and km on x follows arguments parallels since x is an algebra and the beurling transform b is bounded on x we have b f x b f b f x c x f x 17 moreover because the domain is lipschitz there exists a sequence of functions j c such that j converges to in x so we have reduced to prove the compactness when c in this case the kernel of the commutator b f z 1 z w z w 2 f w dw k z w f w dw clearly satisfies k z w c z w for all z w k z w k z w c z z z w 2 if z w 2 z z then a simple computation gives see mov p 419 for z 1 z 2 b f z 1 b f z 2 c z 1 z 2 1 log d z 1

commutator e g tri 2 proposition 7 we have kmf b m f b mf to prove that km is compact on x we will proceed by induction for m 2 b mf b b m 1 f b b m 1 f b bm 1 f km 1 f b bm 1 f b m 1 f c km 1 f bm f
