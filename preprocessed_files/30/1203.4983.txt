x 2 2 y 2 s 2 hilbert schmidt class of operators norm since we are dealing with matrix and operator valued functions we will use the symbol usually with a subscript for the norm in a function space while is used for the norm in the underlying vector operator space thus for a vector valued function f the symbol f 2 denotes its l 2 norm but the symbol f stands for the scalar valued function whose value at a point z is the norm of the vector f z h the space of all functions bounded and analytic in d l e e class of bounded functions on the unit circle t whose values are bounded operators from a

sup z d f z esssup t f t toeplitz operator with symbol all hilbert spaces are assumed to be separable we also assume that in a hilbert space an orthonormal basis is fixed so that any operator a e e can be identified with its matrix thus besides the usual involution a 7 a a is the adjoint of a we have two more a 7 at transpose of the matrix and a 7 a complex conjugation of the matrix so a a t at although everything in the paper can be presented in an invariant coordinate free form the use of the transposition and complex conjugation makes the notation simpler and more transparent 0 introduction we consider the question of when operators with a complete analytic family of eigenvectors are similar recall that operators t 1 and t 2 are said to be similar if there exists a bounded invertible operator a satisfying the intertwining relation at 1 t 2 a the problem of determining when two such operators are unitarily equiv alent goes back to the 1970 s when the cowen douglas class was introduced in 4 it is proven there that unitary equivalence has to do with the curva tures of the eigenvector bundles of the operators and the partial derivatives of them up to a certain order matching up unlike the unitary equivalence case however the similarity problem posed a more complicated situation bergman similarity 3 only some necessary conditions are listed in 4 and no such criterion was obtained by adding the assumption that the operators in consideration be con tractive t 1 the authors in 8 dealt with a special case of the prob lem they gave a description of operators with a complete analytic family of eigenvectors that are similar to s the backward shift operator on the hardy space h 2 both scalar and vector valued of the unit disk d the backward shift s is defined to be the adjoint of the forward shift s sf z zf z for f h 2 and similarity is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a bounded subharmonic solution defined on d to the poisson equation g where g is a function related to the curvatures of the eigenvector bundles of the operators one can ask whether the above characterization also holds for the back ward shift operators b defined on the weighted bergman spaces a 2 again both scalar and vector valued of d if we let p denote the bergman projection and let t be the toeplitz operator with symbol given by t f p f then it is easily seen that our backward shifts can be represented for f a 2 as b f z p z f z tz f z just like in the hardy space case where the bergman projections are replaced by the szego projection we show in this paper that the function theoretic proof provided in 8 for s on h 2 can be applied to b on a 2 giving a generalization of the results there finally we mention the recent paper 5 where the authors use a hilbert module approach to prove that the similarity to the backward shift operator on certain reproducing kernel hilbert spaces can be reduced to the similarity to s on h 2 1 preliminaries let n be a positive integer following the notation of 2 we denote by mn the hilbert space of analytic functions on the unit disk d satisfying f 2 n i 0 f i 2 1 n i 1 i for mn f i 0 f i z i note that mn corresponds to the hardy space h 2 for n 1 and for each positive integer n 2 to the weighted bergman space a 2 n 2 defined by a 2 n 2 f hol d n 1 d f z 2 1 z 2 n 2 da z 4 douglas kwon and treil for da the normalized area measure on d we can define the vector valued spaces mn e taking values in a separable hilbert space e in a similar way on the space mn e are the forward shift operator sn e sn ef z zf z and the backward shift operator s n e its adjoint sincemn is a reproducing kernel hilbert space with reproducing kernel kn 1 z n d the eigenvectors of s n e corresponding to the eigenvalue is k n e for e e we now come to the definition of an n hypercontraction introduced in 1 and 2 let h be a hilbert space an operator t l h is called an n hypercontraction if k i 0 1 i k i t it i 0 for all 1 k n note that the 1 hypercontraction case corresponds to the definition of the usual contraction lastly we recall the definition of a carleson measure let q i z t z z i 1 z i for i t an arc of length i a complex measure in the closed unit disk is called a carleson measure if for some constant c q i c i where denotes the variation of 9 2 main results let n be a positive integer andh a hilbert space we assume the following for the operator t l h that we consider 1 t is an n hypercontraction 2 span ker t d h and 3 ker t depend analytically on the spectral parameter d assumption 3 says that for each d a neighborhood u of and an operator valued analytic function f defined on u that is left invertible in l satisfying ran f w ker t w for all w u exist therefore the disjoint union d ker t v d v ker t is a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle over d with the metric inherited from h and the natural projection v note that assumption 3 then implies that dimker t is constant for all d according to 4 the operators that belong to the cowen douglas class bm d or more generally those with a certain fredholm condition for instance satisfy assumption 3 we next mention that a bundle map is a holomorphic map between two holomorphic vector bundles over d that linearly maps each fiber 1 of one bundle to the corresponding fiber of the other bundle now we state the main results of the paper bergman similarity 5 theorem 2 1 let t l h satisfy the above 3 assumptions with dimker t m for every d denote by d l h the projection valued function that assigns to each d the orthogonal projection onto ker t the following statements are equivalent 1 t is similar to the backward shift operator s n cm on mn cm via an invertible operator a mn cm h 2 there exists a holomorphic bundle map bijection from the eigen vector bundle of s n cm to that of t such that for some constant c 0 1 c v mn cm v h c v mn cm for all v ker s n cm and for all d 3 there exists a bounded solution defined on d to the poisson equa tion z z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 corollary 2 2 a contraction t that satisfies assumptions 2 3 and n i 0 1 i n i t it i 0 enjoys the similarity characterization given in theorem 2 1 corollary 2 3 a subnormal contraction that satisfies assumptions 2 and 3 enjoys the similarity characterization given in theorem 2 1 remark 2 4 note that the function is c and even real analytic in the operator norm topology so it does make sense to consider z z remark 2 5 since z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 0 see section 3 is actually subharmonic remark 2 6 for m 1 z z 2 s 2 and n 1 z 2 2 represent the curva tures of the eigenvector bundles of t and of s n c respectively 4 7 remark 2 7 the existence of a bounded subharmonic function defined on d satisfying z z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 is equivalent to the uniform boundedness of the green potential g 2 d log z 1 z z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 dxdy inside the unit disk d 6 douglas kwon and treil in order to prove theorem 2 1 we first need to obtain a tensor product structure for the operator t then since the equivalence of statements 1 and 2 of theorem 2 1 is obvious and 3 follows from the two statements 4 the measure z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 1 z dxdy is carleson and 5 we have the estimate z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 1 2 c 1 z it suffices to show that 2 implies both 4 and 5 section 4 and that 3 implies 1 section 5 3 tensor structure of the eigenvector bundle 3 1 structure of the eigenvector bundle of t the following theorem by j agler 2 proven through the rovnyak de branges construction is the first step to obtaining a tensor product representation of the eigenvector bundle of t the reader is advised to consult 1 also for an alternative proof of the theorem based on complete positivity theorem 3 1 let t l h there exists a hilbert space e and an s n e invariant subspace n mn e such that t is unitarily equivalent to s n e n if and only if t is an n hypercontraction with limk t kh 0 for all h h let us first observe that limk t kh 0 for h h that is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of t according to assumption 2 these linear combinations form a dense subspace of h moreover since an n hypercontraction is automatically a contraction we have t k 1 we can thus employ a standard argument to show that limk t kh 0 for all h h hence the eigenspaces of t s n e n are given by ker t kn e e n where kn 1 z n d is the reproducing kernel for mn and n e e kn e n note that by assumption 3 the subspaces n also depend analytically on the spectral parameter i e the family of subspaces n is a holomorphic vector bundle over d now since the vector valued hilbert space mn e can be identified with mn e the tensor product of the hilbert spaces mn and e the eigenvector bundle of t takes on the form ker t span kn n bergman similarity 7 3 2 calculation involving the eigenvector bundle of t recall that stands for the orthogonal projection onto ker t using the tensor structure given above we can express as 3 1 1 2 where 1 is the orthogonal projection from the space mn onto span k n and 2 is the orthogonal projection from e onto n we remark that rank rank 2 m lemma 3 2 for d let be orthogonal projections onto an analytic family of subspaces holomorphic vector bundle then the identities z z z 0 and i z z z z z z hold proof of lemma 3 2 since the family of subspaces is a holomorphic vector bundle it can be locally expressed as ranf where f is an analytic left invertible operator valued function thus f f f 1 f we obtain through direct computation that z z i z f z f z f z 1 f z since z is a projection we immediately arrive at the first identity for the second one we note that z f z f z implies z z z z z we then invoke the first identity lemma 3 3 the projection 1 satisfies the identity 1 z z 2 s 2 n 1 z 2 2 proof of lemma 3 3 we first use the reproducing kernel property of kn 1 1 z n to see that kn 22 k n kn 1 2 n thus 1 f k n 22 f k n kn 1 2 nf kn for f mn we next use the fact that f 0 and kn z nz 1 z n 1 k n z to get 3 2 1 f 1 2 n 1 f n kn 1 2 k n since f k n f for f mn k n 2 2 n 1 n 2 1 2 n 2 k n 22 8 douglas kwon and treil once again the reproducing property of kn implies that k n kn n 1 2 n 1 taking all these calculations into account we conclude that n kn 1 2 k n 22 n 1 2 n thus 1 2 n 1 2 2 and we note from 3 2 that rank 1 1 therefore 1 2 s 2 1 2 n 1 2 2 lemma 3 4 the projection satisfies the identity z z 2 s 2 m 1 z z 2 s 2 2 z z 2 s 2 mn 1 z 2 2 2 z z 2 s 2 proof of lemma 3 4 we apply the product rule to 3 1 to obtain 1 2 1 2 x y since 2 2 0 by lemma 3 2 x y 0 therefore x y 2 s 2 trx x try y 2 re tr x y x 2 s 2 y 2 s 2 using the fact that a b 2 s 2 a 2 s 2 b 2 s 2 and that p 2 s 2 rankp for an orthogonal projection p we get 2 s 2 m 1 2 s 2 2 2 s 2 the result now follows from lemma 3 3 bergman similarity 9 4 proof of 2 implies 3 let us mention again that statements 4 and 5 of section 2 together imply statement 3 of theorem 2 1 moreover since we have by lemma 3 4 2 2 s 2 2 s 2 mn 1 2 2 the quantity 2 s 2 mn 1 2 2 in statements 4 and 5 can be replaced by 2 2 s 2 assume that statement 2 of theorem 2 1 holds to guarantee the ex istence of a holomorphic bundle map bijection with a certain property between the eigenvector bundles then for all e cm kn e kn f e where f is some function in h cm e satisfying ranf n and c 1 i f f ci thus it makes sense to consider f f 1 and we can express the orthogonal projection 2 from e onto n in terms of f as 2 f f f 1 f since 2 z z i 2 z f z f z f z 1 f z we get 4 1 2 z z c f z lastly we note that since f is a bounded analytic function taking values in a hilbert space the estimate 4 2 f z c 1 z holds and the measure 4 3 f z 2 1 z dxdy is carleson the first estimate 4 2 is well known for scalar valued analytic functions and one can pick x x z x 1 in the dual space x such that f z x f z to show that it holds for functions with values in a banach space x to see that the carleson measure condition 4 3 holds we use uchiyama s lemma which states that for a bounded subharmonic function u the measure u z 1 z dxdy is carleson we apply this lemma to the function u z f z 2 and note that f z 2 f z 2 by 4 1 4 2 and 4 3 we get the existence of a bounded subharmonic function on d with z 2 z z 2 s 2 10 douglas kwon and treil to obtain equality we note that the equation u z f z always has a solution namely the green potential gf 2 d log z 1 z f z dxdy but since g g 2 z 2 s 2 0 and g is bounded the subharmonic solution g 2 z 2 s 2 to u z 2 z z 2 s 2 is bounded as well 5 proof of 3 implies 1 the goal of this section is to prove the existence of a bounded invertible operator a mn cm n such that as n cm s n e n a we first consider the following theorem that will let us get a bounded analytic projection onto rann z for z d 11 theorem 5 1 let d l h be a c 2 function whose values are orthog onal projections in h assume that satisfies the identity z z z 0 for all z d given a bounded subharmonic function with z z z 2 for all z d there exists a bounded analytic projection onto z i e a function p h h h such that p z is a projection onto ran z for all z d we know from lemma 3 2 that the function 2 whose values are orthog onal projections from e onto n satisfies the identity 2 z 2 z z 0 so that the above theorem is applicable we thus get a bounded analytic projection p z onto ran 2 z n z and consider the inner outer fac torization p pipo of p where pi h e e for some hilbert space e is an inner function and po h e e is an outer function we then define a function qi on d by qi z pi z and form the anti analytic toeplitz operator tqi we claim that this bounded toeplitz operator tqi is an invertible operator that establishes similarity to this end we need to prove the following three statements 1 tz tqi tqitz 2 tqi is left invertible and 3 rantqi n bergman similarity 11 we begin by recalling some well known facts about toeplitz operators on the vector valued spaces mn let f g h e e 5 1 tfg tftg and 5 2 tf k n e k n f e for e e since q i h e e statement 1 easily follows from 5 1 to prove 2 we consider the following lemma lemma 5 2 po z pi z i for all z d proof of lemma 5 2 by 5 1 we have that tpitpo tp tp 2 tpipopipo tpitpopitpo since tpo has dense range and ker tpi 0 tpopi i so popi i for all z d we then note that since q o h e e where qo z po z we can once again use 5 1 to conclude that tqotqi tqoqi i it now remains to show statement 3 the inclusion n ranp ranpi is obvious due to the factorization p pipo for the other in clusion since ranpo is dense in e for all d and pi ranpo n ranpi n thus 5 3 ranpi n we next observe that by 5 2 5 4 tqik n e kn qi e k n pi e for all e e then 3 follows from 5 4 the fact that span k n d mn and assumption 2 that span ker t d h 6 proof of corollaries now we prove the corollaries of theorem 2 1 that appeared in section 2 the statements used in these proofs are contained in 2 proof of corollary 2 2 we have limk t kh 0 for h h that is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of t which by assumption 2 is dense in h if t is a contraction then t k 1 so that limk t kh 0 for all h h now we use the result that an operator t l h with n i 0 1 i n i t it i 0 and such that limk t kh 0 for all h h is an n hypercontraction proof of corollary 2 3 an operator t is an n hypercontraction for every n if and only if t 1 and t is subnormal 6 12 douglas kwon and treil
