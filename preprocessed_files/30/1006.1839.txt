benoit barusseau math u bordeaux 1 fr abstract we consider a bounded function f on 0 1 in 4 b korenblum and k e zhu give a case where we have equality between the limit near the boundary of the unit disc of the berezin transform and the limit of the normalized mellin coefficient when one of them is 0 we previously describe the case where one limit point has modulus f we also use the mean values of f near 1 the aim of this article is to show that between these two extreme cases we can have distinct limits in the same time we also study the sets of limit points of these quantities 1 preliminaries in the following d denote the open unit disc and da the normalized lebesgue measure of d the bergman space la 2 of the disc is the hilbert space of analytics squared integrable func tions on d a function f l d da is said to be radial if f z f z almost everywhere on d the toeplitz operator tf la 2 la 2 is defined to be tf h p fh where is the orthogonal projection from l 2 d da onto la 2 let f be a bounded radial function we denote cn f n 1 0 1 f r dr the normalized mellin coefficient of indice n n the berezin transform of f is defined to be f z d f w 1 z 2 2 1 z w 4 da w in 1 we show that 0 6 limsup z d f z 6 limsup n cn f tf e 6 limsup 1 1 1 1 f r dr 6 f 1 where tf denote the essential norm of the bounded toeplitz operator on the bergman space now considering the three intermediate quantities b korenblum and k e zhu show in 4 that if one of these quantities is zero so is for the other we have shown in 1 that if one of the previous quantity is equal to f then so is for the other moreover these two works answer the questions when the essential norm of the toeplitz operator tf is zero and when it is f here we answer the following natural question is there exist a bounded function which gives strict inequalities in equation 1 we prove that such a function exists and explain why it works our method underlines a link between the limits points of the normalized mellin coefficients and the limits of the berezin transform near the boundary of the unit disc we will need some technical tools which are contained in the following lemmas lemma 1 u kovi 2 let f be a bounded m quasihomogeneous function with f as radial part for any complex z r ei we have f z 2 1 r 2 2 r m eim n 0 n n m 2 n m 1 c 2 n m f r 2 n 1 lemma 2 b barusseau 1 let 0 k a compact subset of d and l t k if ar r 0 1 mr r 0 1 and nr r 0 1 are complex functions of r 0 1 such that ar 0 1 mr k nr d 1 then liminf r 1 ar 0 liminf r 1 armr 1 ar nr l 0 2 the result theorem 3 there exists f a bounded radial function such that the sets 1 am f l c liminfz d l cn f of the limits points of the normalized mellin coefficients 2 ame f l c liminf 1 l 1 1 1 f t d t of the limits points of the mean values of f near 1 3 ab f l c liminfz d l f z of the limits points of the berezin transform near the boundary of the unit disc are disjoint moreover these three sets have disctinct supremum this is limsup z d f z limsup n cn f limsup 1 1 1 1 f r dr using proposition 3 in 1 we know that if one of these quantities has a limit not only a supe rior limit then so is for the others and these limits are equal thus we need to consider a func tion which has no limit in the neighbourhood of 1 a simple way is to look at functions which quickly oscillate in the neighbourhood of 1 s grudsky and n vasilevski define in 3 the fol lowing function f for any z d f z ln z 1 i 2 where 0 1 ln r 1 idr 1 from now f is fixed by equation 2 we remark that f is bounded but has no limit in 1 proposition 4 3 we have cn f n n exp i ln n 1 n n in particular am f d and limsupn cn f tf e 1 now we consider the set ame f proposition 5 we have ame f 2 d in particular limsup 1 1 1 1 f r dr 2 1 proof let 0 a change of variable gives 1 1 1 f r d r 1 1 ln 1 r id r 1 ln ln 1 eiveve e v d v we split the previous integrale in the following way 1 1 1 f r d r 1 ln ln 1 eivevd v 3 2 section 2 and 1 ln ln 1 eivev e e v 1 dv using the mean value theorem we obtain that for any u r e e u 1 6 sup v 0 ev eu 0 6 eu thus 6 1 ln ln 1 e i 2 v d v 6 1 ln ln 1 e 2 vd v 1 1 2 ln 1 2 now since lim 1 ln 1 1 lim 1 1 1 we have lim 1 6 2 lim 1 ln 1 0 equation 3 gives 1 1 1 f r d r 1 ln ln 1 eivevd v o 1 1 1 1 1 i ln 1 i 1 o 1 1 1 i ln 1 i ln 1 1 o 1 1 since lim 1 ln 1 i ln 1 1 1 we have lim 1 1 1 1 f r d r 1 i 2 it is clear that ame f 2 d the converse is clearly true finally a simple estimate of gives that 2 1 to describe am f we will use lemma 2 and summation by part we recall that considering two sequences an n n and bn n n for any n n we have n 0 n anbn an n 0 n bn n 0 n 1 k 0 n bk an 1 an theorem 6 let g be a bounded radial function and l be such that l sup am g if there exists 0 such that liminf n card n 0 n c 2 n 1 g l n 0 4 then l ab g in particular if it is true for any l supam g d then tf e limsupz d f z proof to show this proposition it suffices to show that liminf z d f z l 0 5 in order to simplify our calculations we consider the 1 quasihomogeneous function f with radial part f this means that f rei ei f r the result 3 we show in 1 that equation 5 is equivalent to liminf z d f z l 0 since f is also 1 quasihomogeneous the previous equality is obviously equivalent to the fol lowing one liminf r 1 f r r l 0 we will apply lemma 2 with l supam g and k ec d d l the closure of the convex hull of d d l we denote p n n c 2 n 1 g l and for all 0 r 1 mr n p nc 2 n 1 g r 2 n 2 n p n r 2 n 2 nr n n p nc 2 n 1 g r 2 n 2 n n p nr 2 n 2 and ar 1 r 2 2 n p n r 2 n 2 thus for all 0 r 1 we have armr 1 ar nr 1 r 2 2 n n n cn g r 2 n 2 and f r r l armr 1 ar nr l since for all 0 r 1 we have 1 r 2 2 n n n r 2 n 2 1 we see that ar 0 1 moreover it is clear that mr k and nr d now in order to apply lemma 2 it remains to show that liminfr 1 ar 0 for any n n we denote pn card n 0 n c 2 n 1 g l let n n using a summation by part with an n si n pn 0 sinon and bn r 2 n 2 we have n pn n r 2 n 1 r 2 n 2 k pn k n 1 n 1 k pn k r 2 n 2 r 2 n 6 we easily see that k pn k 16 k 6 pn k pn pn 1 2 pn 2 2 thus n 1 n 1 k pn k r 2 n 2 r 2 n n 1 n 1 pn 2 2 r 2 n 2 r 2 n by hypothesis there exists m 0 such that pn n for n m so n 1 n 1 pn 2 2 r 2 n 2 r 2 n 2 2 1 r 2 n m n 1 n 2 r 2 n 2 4 section 2 thus using equation 6 we deduce n p n r 2 n 2 lim n r 2 n 1 k pn k 2 2 1 r 2 n m n 2 r 2 n 2 2 2 1 r 2 n m n 2 r 2 n 2 since n 0 n 2 r 2 n 2 r 2 1 1 r 2 3 we have lim r 1 1 r 2 n m n 2 r 2 n 2 2 thus liminf r 1 ar 2 0 since d is compact and ab f is closed we have the particular case corollary 7 there exists 1 such that ab f d in particular we have limsupz d f z 1 proof let l d there exists such that l e i we will apply theorem 6 with 2 we recall that for any n n n pn 0 6 n 6 n and eiln 2 n 1 ei 2 06 n 6 n and ln 2 n 1 k 1 2 2 k 3 2 2 k for any sufficicently large n n there exists t r such that n 1 2 e 3 2 2 t 1 thus pn k 0 t card 1 2 e 2 2 k 1 1 2 e 3 2 2 k 1 n k 0 t 1 2 e 3 2 2 k 1 2 e 2 2 k 1 finally we remark that k 0 t 1 2 e 3 2 2 k 1 2 e 2 2 k 1 k 0 t 1 2 e 2 k k e 2 t 1 1 where k 0 thus pn n k e 2 t 1 1 1 2 e 3 2 2 t 1 k x 1 1 2 e 3 2 x 1 where x e 2 t 1 it is now clear that liminfn pn n 0 and using the previous theorem the proof is finished theorem 3 is now proved the result 5 we have given a function f such that am f ab f and ame f are disjoint sets and con sidering the real part of f we obtain ab re f am re f ame re f 3 generalization to extreme points we can generalize this approach and give conditions on the sequence of the normalized mellin coefficients to ensure that some particular points cannot be attained by both berezin transform and normalized mellin coefficients theorem 8 let g be a bounded radial function and l be an extreme point of am g if there exist 0 such that liminf n card n 0 n c 2 n 1 g l n 0 7 then l ab proof since g is bounded so is am g if l is an extreme point of the closed set am g then there exists a c and r 0 such that am d a r and am d a r l thus g a l a r the previous corollary can be applied with g a and since c 2 n 1 g a l a c 2 n 1 g l the condition is just condition 7 and we can conclude that l a l c liminf z d l a g a z which is just l ab since g a g a we can hope that if am contains two elements then the condition 7 is true this will be true if am has a finite cardinal in fact since am is a connected set see 3 if am contains at least two elements then am is not finite using the same idea as in theorem 8 we give now an analogous of theorem 4 in 1 consid ering extreme points theorem 9 let g be a bounded radial function and l be an extreme point of the essential range of g the following conditions are equivalent a l ab g b l am g c l ame g proof using the theorem 4 in 1 together with the same argument as in the proof of the pre vious theorem and the fact that 1 1 1 g r l dr 1 1 1 g r dr l we clearly obtain the theorem the following example is an application of the previous theorem example 10 let g be defined by r 0 1 g r 16 r r 0 1 16 1 r n 1 1 1 2 2 n 2 1 1 2 2 n 1 2 0 r n 1 1 1 2 2 n 1 2 1 1 2 2 n 2 2 6 section 3 for any n 1 we have 2 2 n 2 1 1 2 2 n 2 1 g r d r 2 2 n 2 p n 1 1 2 2 p 2 1 1 2 2 p 1 2 2 2 n 2 1 1 2 2 n 2 1 1 2 2 n 1 2 2 2 n 2 1 2 2 n 2 1 2 2 n 1 2 1 1 24 n 1 since 2 2 n 2 1 1 2 2 n 2 1 g r d r 6 1 we have lim n 2 2 n 2 1 1 2 2 n 2 1 g r d r 1 the same reasoning gives 2 2 n 1 2 1 1 2 2 n 1 2 1 1 g r d r 1 1 26 n 3 which implies that 06 2 2 n 1 2 1 1 2 2 n 1 2 1 g r d r 6 1 26 n 3 so lim n 2 2 n 1 2 1 1 2 2 n 1 2 1 g r d r 0 since 0 inf f and 1 sup f are extreme points of the essential range of g we have 0 1 am and 0 1 ab we have given condition on the set of the mellin coefficients to ensure that these limits are distinct or equal it remains to give conditions on f or on the means of f near 1 in the case where they are distinct it is still an open question bibliography 1 benoit barusseau on the spectrum of toeplitz operators with quasi homogeneous symbols operators and matrices 2010 2 eljko u kovi
