solvable lie algebra can be represented as a matrix lie algebra with upper triangular square matrices as elements however this result does not specify which is the minimal order of the matrices involved in such repre sentations hence the main goal of this paper is to revisit and implement a method to compute both that minimal order and a matrix representative for a given solvable lie algebra as application of this procedure we compute representatives for each solvable lie algebra with dimension less than 6 key words and phrases solvable lie algebra faithful upper triangular matrix repre

algebras and groups which has broad applications to the analysis of continuous symmetries in mathematics and physics more concretely in mathematics the classification of lie groups reveals symmetries in differential equations with respect to physics representation theory yields natural connections between representation of lie algebras and the properties of elementary particles ado s theorem states that given a finite dimensional complex lie algebra g there exists a matrix algebra isomorphic to g see 1 for the classical proof and 2 for a very short alternative in this way every finite dimensional complex lie algebra can be represented 1 corresponding author phone 34 954349354 fax 34 954349339 1 http arxiv org abs 1404 3510 v 1 as a lie subalgebra of the complex general linear algebra gl n c of complex n n matrices for some n n this paper focuses on lie algebra hn of n n upper triangular matrices it is well known that every finite dimensional solvable lie algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of hn for some n n see 3 proposition 3 7 3 therefore the following interesting question arises for a given finite dimensional solvable lie algebra g determining the minimal n n such that hn contains g as a lie subalgebra i e obtaining the minimal faithful representation of g by using n n upper triangular matrices several authors have studied the minimal dimension g to represent a given lie algebra g see burde 4 for instance however most of them have considered faithful g modules instead of the particular subclass consisting of lie algebras hn therefore the value of g is less than or equal to the dimension to be computed in this paper regarding this matter matrix representations were computed by ghanam et al 5 for low dimensional nilpotent lie algebras but not studying the minimality and giving some non minimal representations the interest in these faithful representations is motivated among other issues by problems from geometry and topology for example milnor 6 and auslander 7 8 studied generalizations of crystallographic groups in relation with this minimal value for matrix representations another motivation is based on the following result lie algebra g of a given lie group g admitting a left invariant affine structure satisfies that its minimal dimension of faithful representations is g n 1 several papers throughout the literature deal with matrix representation of these solv able lie algebras for example benjumea et al 9 introduced an algorithmic procedure which explicitly computed a representative of minimal faithful unitriangular matrix repre sentations for a given nilpotent lie algebra and its associated lie group subsequently the complete list of minimal faithful unitriangular matrix representations was given by ben jumea et al 10 for nilpotent lie algebras of dimension less than 6 finally the matrix representation of filiform lie algebras of dimension less than 9 was computed in 11 ad ditionally n ez and tenorio 12 continued with this research and gave the outlines of an algorithmic procedure to compute explictly representatives of the minimal faithful matrix representation for solvable lie algebras by using lie algebras hn giving some examples of application by hand this procedure adapted that given in benjumea et al 9 but neither the algorithm was completely debugged nor implementations were carried out and run the main goal of the current paper is to advance in the above mentioned research by debugging and implementing the algorithm sketched in 12 in order to automate the computation of minimal faithful matrix representations for a given solvable lie algebra starting from its law as application we have also computed representations for each solvable lie algebra of dimension less than 6 as well as for others of higher dimension to do so we have used the classifications given by mubarakzyanov and turkowski see 2 13 14 15 16 this paper is structured as follows section 2 reviews some well known results on lie theory to be applied later thereupon section 3 revisits the algorithmic procedure sketched in 12 to compute minimal faithful representations for solvable lie algebras by using upper triangular matrices incorporating a formulation of the algorithm which can be dealt computationally with implementation in maple 12 to shorten the paper length the computational method is only explicitly applied to two algebras in section 4 just afterwards section 5 gives an explicit list with representatives of minimal faithful matrix representations for solvable lie algebras of dimension less than 6 2 preliminaries for an overall review on lie algebras the reader can consult 3 in the present section we only recall some definitions and results about invariant theory and lie algebras to be applied later throughout this article we only consider finite dimensional lie algebras over the complex number field c given a lie algebra g its derived series is defined as follows c 1 g g c 2 g g g c 3 g c 2 g c 2 g ck g ck 1 g ck 1 g 1 additionally the lie algebra g is said to be solvable if there exists a natural integer m such that cm g 0 the solv index of g is precisely the value of m n such that cm g 0 and cm 1 g 6 0 the relation between the derived series of a given lie algebra g and that of a lie subalgebras is given as follows proposition 1 if h is a lie subalgebra of a given lie algebra g then ck h ck g for all k n given n n the complex solvable lie algebra hn consists of n n upper triangular matrices i e its vectors are expressed as hn xr s x 11 x 12 x 1 n 0 x 22 x 2 n 0 0 xnn with xr s c for 1 r s n 2 lie algebra hn has a basis bn consisting of vectors xi j hn xr s with 1 i j n and such that xr s 1 if r s i j 0 if r s 6 i j 3 3 the dimension of hn is n n 1 2 and the nonzero brackets with respect to basis bn are xi j xj k xi k 1 i j k n 4 xi i xi j xi j 1 i j n 5 xk i xi i xk i k i n 6 3 computing minimal matrix representations this section continues the work started in 12 and introduces an algorithmic method to compute minimal matrix representations of solvable lie algebras in such a way this can be dealt with computer algebra after explaining step by step the algorithm this is implemented in maple 12 and applied to several examples given a lie algebra g a representation of g in cn is a homomorphism of lie algebras g gl c n then n n is called the dimension of this representation ado s theorem states that every finite dimensional lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero as in the case of c has a linear injective representation on a finite dimensional vector space that is a faithful representation usually representations are defined as g modules consisting of homomorphisms of lie algebras from g to lie algebra gl v of endomorphisms over an arbitrary n dimensional vector space v like in 18 regarding minimal representations of lie algebras burde 4 introduced the invariant g for an arbitrary lie algebra g g min dim m m is a faithful g module in this section matrix faithful representations of solvable lie algebras are studied more over we are interested in minimal faithful matrix representations with a particular restric tion the representation is contained in hn for some n n in this way given a solvable lie algebra g we want to compute the minimal value n such that hn contains a lie subalgebra isomorphic to g this value is also an invariant of g and its expression is given by g min n n subalgebra of hn isomorphic to g in general invariants g and g can be different from each other next we show the algorithmic method to compute minimal faithful matrix represen tations for those algebras by using lie algebras hn the minimality must be understood in the following sense there exists a faithful matrix representation of g in hn but no in hn 1 to do so we give a step by step explanation of the algorithm used to determine these minimal representations for a given solvable lie algebra g of dimension n 4 1 according to proposition 1 we compute the first natural integer k such that the derived series of hk is compatible with that associated with g 2 we search a lie subalgebra of hk isomorphic to g with k as low as possible to do so the vectors in the basis ei n i 1 of g are expressed as the following linear combinations of basis bk eh 1 i j k h i jxi j for 1 h n 7 3 bracket ei ej is computed for 1 i j n when imposing the law of g a system of non linear equations is obtained by comparing coordinate to coordinate with respect to basis bk 4 we solve the system of equations and a solution of the system provides us one of the representations searched for lie algebra g if the solution corresponds to a set of vectors being linearly independent when no solution is obtained lie algebra g cannot be represented as a lie subalgebra of hk in this case we go back to step 2 and repeat each step with lie algebra hk 1 the representation obtained for lie algebra g is minimal because we start with k 1 and k increases one unit when no representation can be obtained from hk obviously the set of solutions of the system in the last step depends on the lie algebra which the algorithm is applied to as an example of application we have minimally repre sented solvable lie algebras with dimension less than 6 in section 4 the set of solutions in step 4 has been computed with the command solve in the symbolic computation package maple 12 this command works efficiently with polynomial equations receives as inputs the list of equations and the list of variables and returns as output the algebraic expression of the set of solutions furthermore in order to compute a particular solution of the previous system we have searched one having as many coefficients hi j being equal to 0 as possible in this way a coefficient is assumed to be equal zero when it does not appear in the relations obtained by the equations this will be a natural representative of the lie algebra g 3 1 implementation next we show the implementation of the different routines in order to apply the previous method they have been written using the symbolic computation package maple 12 loading the libraries differentialgeometry liealgebras to activate commands related to lie algebras first the routine law h is implemented to compute the law of the solvable lie al gebra hn this routine receives as input the value of n and returns the list of brackets expressing the law of hn with respect to the basis e 1 e 2 en n 1 2 which corresponds 5 to x 1 1 x 1 n x 2 2 x 2 n xn n for the implementation a list b saves the basis of hn and s keeps all the non zero brackets involved in the law to carry out the computations three different loops are programmed to find and save the three different types of non zero brackets in eqs 4 6 finally the law of the algebra is saved in the variable ext 1 to be loaded in a later routine law h proc n local b s b s for i from 1 to n do constructing the basis for j from i to n do b op b x i j end do end do for i from 1 to n 1 do finding brackets in eq 5 for j from i 1 to n do s op s x i i x i j x i j end do end do for i from 1 to n 1 do finding brackets in eq 6 for j from i 1 to n do s op s x i j x j j x i j end do end do for i from 1 to n 2 do finding brackets in eq 4 for j from i 1 to n 1 do for k from j 1 to n do s op s x i j x j k x i k end do end do end do return liealgebradata s b ext 1 liealgebradata defining the algebra end proc next the routine derviedseries h receives as input the value of n and computes a list with the dimension of each term in the derived series of hn let us note that we have to distinguish two different cases being the first when n is very low otherwise we only have to consider powers of 2 as it can be proved by a straightforward inductive reasoning derivedseries h proc n local l l n n 1 2 if n 4 then for i from 1 to n do l op l n i n i 1 2 end do else for i from 0 by 1 while 2 i n do 6 l op l n 2 i n 2 i 1 2 end do end if if member 0 l false then l op l 0 end if return l end proc now we define solvable lie algebra g according to the following notation l dg liealgebra g n a dgsetup l where n is the dimension of g a value inserted by the user and a is a list containing information about the structure constants of the law of g elements in a must be of the form i j k cijk where cijk is the structure constant ki j corresponding to the coefficient of ek in the bracket ei ej once these data are loaded we can operate over lie algebra g the next routine is called derivedseries and computes a list with the dimension of each ideal in the derived series of g g derivedseries proc g local k g c 1 seq e i i 1 n c 2 derivedalgebra initiating derived series g if c 2 then return abelian lie algebra end if testing abelian lie algebras g for i from 3 by 1 while c i do constructing derived series g c i derivedalgebra c i 1 g if c i then return seq nops c j j 1 i end if g end do g end proc next the solv index of g is saved in the variable called index g and all the ideals of the derived series are also defined to do so we execute the following sentences g assign index g nops derivedseries g c 1 g seq e i i 1 n g c 2 g derivedalgebra g for i from 3 to index g do g c i g derivedalgebra c i 1 g g end do the routine dimrepresentation computes the minimal dimension for a matrix repre sentation of g by using lie algebras hn to implement this routine we compare the dimen sion sequence of the derived series of both g and hn by using the routines derivedseries h and derivedseries the output is the minimal k n such that step 1 is verified g dimrepresentation proc g l derivedseries g k 0 d nops l 7 g if d 4 then initiating dimension of representation g n d 1 else n d g end if g while k 0 do g m derivedseries h n g for i from 1 to nops l do g if l i m i then k k comparing dimension sequences of derived algebras g else k k 1 g end if g end do g if k 0 then k 0 checking compatibility between dimension sequences g else return n returning dimension of representation g end if g n n 1 g end do g end proc after completing step 1 in the algorithm we need to express all the vectors in the basis of g as a linear combination of basis bk of hk where k is the output of the routine dimrepresentation therefore we start loading lie algebra hk with the sentence g dgsetup law h k x a in this sentence x is used to denote the basis vectors in bk as xi k k 1 2 i 1 instead of ei k k 1 2 i 1 since we need different notations for the bases of both lie algebras g and hk the notation a corresponds to the list of structure constants defining the law of lie algebra hn and expressed as in 4 5 and 6 from this point we can also work over the lie algebra hk named l 1 by the package next as we did with lie algebra g we define all the ideals of the derived series of hk as follows l 1 c 1 h seq x i i 1 k k 1 2 l 1 c 2 h derivedalgebra l 1 for i from 3 to nops derivedseries h k do c i h derivedalgebra c i 1 h end do next we express all the vectors ei n i 1 from the basis of g as a linear combination of basis bk xi k k 1 2 i 1 of hk to do so we first implement a subroutine called listposi which computes the position of an element within a list then we also implement the routine expr the latter uses the derived series of both g and hk and by applying propo sition 1 returns as output two lists the first contains all the expressions according to the second step of the method that is equation 7 and in the second the conditions over the coefficients so that non zero vectors are considered l 1 listposi proc a l l 1 for i from 1 to nops l do l 1 if a l i then 8 l 1 return i l 1 end if l 1 end do l 1 end proc let us note that in order to implement routine expr we have defined several clusters comparing the derived series of g and hk with this rouitne we express the basis vectors of g as a linear combination of the basis vectors from hk l 1 expr proc l 1 l m l 1 for i from 1 to index g 1 do l 1 for j from 1 to nops c i g do l 1 if member c i g j c i 1 g false then l 1 if c i 1 g then l 1 l op l c i g j sum a j k c i h k k 1 nops c i h l 1 m op m sum a j k 2 k 1 nops c i h 0 l 1 end if l 1 else member c i g j c 1 g p l 1 n seq listposi c i 1 h k c 1 h k 1 nops c i 1 h l 1 l op l c i g j sum a p n k c i 1 h k k 1 nops c i 1 h l 1 m op m sum a p n k 2 k 1 nops c i 1 h 0 l 1 end if l 1 end do l 1 end do l 1 return l m l 1 end proc after expressing the basis of g with respect to basis bk of hk we impose the law of both lie algebras to the previous expressions in this way we implement the routine listeq which returns two lists the first one contaning the elements to be equal to zero and the second one with the conditions to assure the linear independence of the basis l 1 listeq proc l 1 r l 1 for i from 1 to nops expr 1 1 do l 1 for j from i 1 to nops expr 1 do l 1 if bracketofsubspaces lhs expr 1 i lhs expr 1 j then l 1 r op r op bracketofsubspaces rhs expr 1 i rhs expr 1 j l 1 else r op r op bracketofsubspaces lhs expr 1 i lhs expr 1 j op bracketofsubspaces rhs expr 1 i rhs expr 1 j l 1 end if l 1 end do l 1 end do l 1 return op eval r expr 1 op expr 2 l 1 end proc next we define two variables listexp and listcond to save the two outputs of the routine listeq respectively finally we implement the routine sys to solve the system of 9 equations resulting from the previous expressions this routine must receive as input the lists listexp and listcond returning as output the set of solutions which determine the coefficients of the representation of g by using lie algebra hk l 1 sys proc l m l 1 local q l 1 q l 1 for i from 1 to nops l do l 1 q op q seq coeff l i x j j 1 nops c 1 h l 1 end do l 1 q op q op m l 1 return solve q l 1 end proc if no solution is obtained then it is not possible to represent g as a lie subalgebra of lie algebra hk and we must try with the next lie algebra hk 1 therefore we would have to re peat the process from the execution of hk 1 with the sentence dgsetup law h k x a but replacing k with k 1 3 2 examples of application next we show an example with the 3 dimensional solvable lie algebra with law e 1 e 3 e 2 we must run all the routines implemented in the previous section here we only reproduce the most important outputs and those sentences to be modified for this specific example to define the solvable lie algebra g the follow sentence is run l dg liealgebra g 3 1 3 2 1 dgsetup l we must fill in derivedseries the value n 3 and then execute the following sentences derivedseries 3 1 0 assign index g nops derivedseries index g 3 c 1 g seq e i i 1 3 c 1 g e 1 e 2 e 3 c 2 g derivedalgebra c 2 g e 2 for i from 3 to index g do c i g derivedalgebra c i 1 g c 3 g at this point loading the routine dimrepresentation we obtain dimrepresentation 2 10 therefore we must use k 2 in step 1 of the algorithm we look for a representation of g as a lie subalgebra of h 2 now we start loading lie algebra h 2 and we define all the terms of its derived series as follows g dgsetup law h 2 x a lie algebra l 1 l 1 multiplicationtable liebracket x 1 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 l 1 c 1 h seq x i i 1 2 3 2 c 1 h x 1 x 2 x 3 l 1 c 2 h derivedalgebra c 2 h x 2 l 1 for i from 3 to nops derivedseries h 2 do c i h derivedalgebra c i 1 h end do c 3 h by executing the routine expr we obtain the following output l 1 expr e 1 a 1 1 x 1 a 1 2 x 2 a 1 3 x 3 e 2 a 2 2 x 2 e 3 a 3 1 x 1 a 3 2 x 2 a 3 3 x 3 a 1 1 2 a 1 2 2 a 1 3 2 0 a 2 2 2 0 a 3 1 2 a 3 2 2 a 3 3 2 0 the output of listeq is l 1 listeq a 1 3 a 2 2 a 1 1 a 2 2 x 2 a 2 2 x 2 a 1 3 a 3 2 a 1 2 a 3 3 a 1 2 a 3 1 a 1 1 a 3 2 x 2 a 2 2 a 3 3 a 2 2 a 3 1 x 2 a 1 1 2 a 1 2 2 a 1 3 2 0 a 2 2 2 0 a 3 1 2 a 3 2 2 a 3 3 2 0 after defining the variables listexp and listcond from the previous output the rou tine sys is executed as follows l 1 sys listexp listcond since no answer is returned there is no solution for the underlying system hence lie algebra g cannot be represented as a lie subalgebra of h 2 thus the process must now be repeated from the execution of the sentence dgsetup law h 2 x a where h 2 is replaced with h 3 g dgsetup law h 3 x a lie algebra l 1 l 1 multiplicationtable liebracket x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 4 x 2 x 2 x 5 x 3 x 3 x 6 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 6 x 5 l 1 c 1 h

this time the variables listexp and listcond are defined from the output of listeq as follows l 1 listexp a 1 4 a 2 2 a 1 1 a 2 2 x 2 a 1 6 a 2 3 a 1 5 a 2 2 a 1 2 a 2 5 a 1 1 a 2 3 x 3 a 1 6 a 2 5 a

the representative e 1 x 5 e 2 x 3 e 3 x 2 or by considering the original notation for basis b 3 e 1 x 2 3 e 2 x 1 3 e 3 x 1 2 to conclude this section we would like to point out that our algorithmic method is not only valid for low dimensional solvable lie algebras but it provides minimal faithful repre sentations for solvable lie algebras of higher dimension in this sense we have computed some other examples corresponding to solvable lie algebras such that their dimension is greater than the last being classified namely dimension n 7 more concretely ko bel 19 gave the list of 7 dimensional solvable lie algebras with codimension 1 from that list we have considered that with law e 2 e 7 e 3 e 3 e 7 e 4 e 4 e 7 e 5 e 5 e 7 e 6 e 6 e 7 e 6 and our algorithm returns the following representation e 1 x 1 1 e 2 x 2 3 e 3 x 2 4 e 4 x 2 5 e 5 x 2 6 e 6 x 2 6 e 7 x 3 4 x 4 5 x 5 6 x 6 6 12 we have also considered a second example consisting of the 8 dimensional solvable lie algebra with a 4 dimensional abelian ideal and law e 1 e 2 e 3 e 2 e 5 e 6 e 4 e 5 e 8 e 1 e 6 e 7 e 2 e 6 e 8 e 3 e 5 e 7 in this case our algorithmic method gives this representation e 1 x 1 4 x 3 5 e 2 x 1

section 3 obtaining a minimal faithful upper triangular matrix representation for each solvable lie algebra of dimension less than 6 in addition we compute such representations for several important families of n dimensional solvable lie algebras tables 1 to 3 show the classification of solvable lie algebras of dimension less than 6 given in 13 14 taking into account that we have only written the nonzero brackets in the law of each lie algebra whereas tables 4 to 6 contain a representative for each algebra in the previous tables in virtue of these tables we can state the following proposition 2 a minimal faithful representation by upper triangular matrices for each solvable lie algebra of dimension less than 6 with the dimension of such a minimal repre sentation is given in tables 4 to 6 moreover such representations can be obtained with a natural representative next we show several results to determine a representative for minimal faithful upper triangular matrix representations of three different families of solvable lie algebras propo sition 3 deals with a family of solvable non nilpotent lie algebras then proposition 4 computes a minimal representative for heisenberg algebras these lie algebras constitute a special subclass of nilpotent lie algebras and are very interesting for their applications to both the theory of nilpotent lie algebras itself and theoretical physics finally propo sition 5 provides a minimal representation for model filiform lie algebras these algebras are the most structured lie algebras in the nilpotent class and were introduced by vergne 17 in 1966 these propositions can be proved by applying the algorithm considered in section 3 from a theoretical point of view and not by running the implementation proposition 3 let sn be an n dimensional solvable lie algebra with basis ei n i 1 and law ei en ei for 1 i n then sn n in fact a natural representative of sn is given by ej x 1 j 1 j n 1 j 1 en x 1 1 13 proposition 4 let h 2 n 1 be the 2 n 1 dimensional heisenberg algebra with basis ei 2 n 1 i 1 and law e 2 i e 2 i 1 e 1 for 1 i n then h 2 n 1 n 2 moreover a natural representative of h 2 n 1 is given by e 2 j 1 xj 1 n 2 j n j 0 e 2 k x 1
