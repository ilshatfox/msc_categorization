popular object of study in the field of complex function theory we look at meromorphic inner functions with a given spectrum and provide sufficient conditions for them to have uniformly bounded derivative on the real line this question was first studied by louis de branges in 1968 and was later revived by anton baranov in 2011 1 introduction an inner function on the upper half plane c is a bounded analytic function on c with unit modulus almost everywhere on the real line r a meromorphic inner function mif on c is an inner function on c with a meromorphic continuation to c the spectrum of an mif is the level set tx p r pxq 1 u and we denote it by p q inner functions arise often in the study of complex function theory a rather well studied object is the weyl titchmarsh inner function that frequently occurs in the study of the spectral theory of differential operators we are interested in the following problem given a separated sequence tanu on r does there exist an mif with tanu as spectrum such that 1 is uniformly bounded on r by a separated sequence tanu we simply mean that there is a 0 such that an am for all n m integers in his book hilbert spaces of entire functions 4 louis de branges formulated a result lemma 16 that was equivalent to the the statement given any sequence of separated points tanu on r there exists a meromorphic inner function such that 1 is uniformly bounded on r and p q tanu in 2011 anton baranov discovered this statement to be false and demonstrated this in private communications with mathematicians working in this area 2 he noticed that any meromorphic inner function having the natural numbers n as spectrum must indeed have unbounded derivative on r in fact he formulated a more general result which could be loosely stated as any mif that has as spectrum clusters followed by gaps must necessarily have unbounded derivative on r in this paper we will characterize sequences for which there do exist corresponding mifs with bounded derivatives as well as describe the method used by baranov to contruct counterexamples before proceeding any further we must clarify de branges motivation for his result as well as its appli cation lemma 16 that de branges stated was used to show the existence of a non zero measure that is supported on a sequence such that its fourier transform vanishes on an interval of positive measure readers may recognize this as beurling s gap problem for sequences wherein he asks the question under what conditions on the sequence does there exist a corresponding measure with vanishing on an interval of positive measure in 8 mitkovski and poltoratski provided a sufficient condition for beurling s problem for separated sequences in terms of the beurling malliavin density we notice in hindsight that de branges was specifically looking at sequences that were regular and that these sequences satisfy the re quirement as stated in 8 thus despite the erroneous lemma de branges application of it still holds we describe this briefly in the applications below we remark that even for such special sequences however there may not exist any corresponding mif with a bounded derivative this and other such counterexamples were constructed by baranov and we decribe these in the last section apart from this there have been demands for meromorphic inner functions with a certain spectrum and a bounded derivative in more general contexts for instance in the beurling malliavin theory for toeplitz kernels makarov and poltoratski require this to prove the most general form of the bm multiplier theorem 7 see application 2 below in 8 mitkovski and poltoratski have characterized po lya sequences and gap conditions using the existence of an mif with bounded derivative in his paper 1 on the stability 1 http arxiv org abs 1309 6728 v 5 of completeness of a system of exponentials under certain perturbations baranov requires the existence of such an mif with spectrum as the perturbed sequence he also states a sufficient condition lemma 5 2 on sequences to possess this special mif we will exploit this as well as a new sufficient condition to describe sequences that are spectra for mifs with bounded derivatives we also prove a partial converse result acknowledgements the author would like to thank anton baranov for going through this work in great detail and suggesting crucial corrections and improvements to mikhail sodin and mishko mitkovski for extremely useful feedback and finally her adviser alexei poltoratski for suggesting this problem and for innumerable discussions and good advice 1 1 preliminaries a well known theorem by riesz and v i smirnov says that all meromorphic inner functions have the form pzq b pzqeiaz where a 0 and b is the blaschke product of the zeros of the function given by t nun where n 8 and satisfy the convergence criterion np n 1 n 2 8 these functions enjoy the antisymmetric relationship pzq 1 pzq 1 which can be obtained by weierstrass s factorization theorem as given in 5 any meromorphic inner function can be represented as ei on r where is an increasing real analytic function on r this is not hard to see this for eiaz pa 0 q and for finite blaschke products which we can then generalize to infinite ones it is easy to construct a meromorphic inner function with a given spectrum although the procedure is standard in existing literature 9 we go over it again as the construction is crucial to our main proofs let tanu 8 8 be a separated sequence on r we proceed similarly for one sided sequences also let be a poisson finite positive measure on r with point masses at the an i e 8 n 8 wn an 2 for some wn 0 such that 8 n 8 wn 1 a 2 n 8 the cauchy transform of a poisson finite measure on r is given by k pzq 1 i r 1 t z t 1 t 2 d ptq applying the cauchy transform to the measure just defined k pzq 1 i 8 n 8 wn an z wnan 1 a 2 n we have that k is an analytic funtion from the upper half plane c to the right half plane we compose k with a fractional linear transformation that maps the right half plane into the unit disk to get c d as follows pzq k pzq 1 k pzq 1 3 observe that is a meromorphic inner function on c with spectrum the set tanu 8 8 for is non negative giving us k pzq 0 on c with k pxq p r for all x p r along with the fact that w w 1 w 1 2 maps t w 0 u onto d taking ir onto the unit circle morever we notice that would take the value 1 exactly at the singularities of k i e at the ans the measure is known as the clark measure associated with the function by a reversal of steps and using herglotz s theorem one can construct a clark measure given any meromorphic inner function on c in particular clark measures associated with inner functions are singular with respect to the lebesgue measure with the spectrum of the inner function as its support except possibly the point at infinity a natural question to ask is if the inner function with spectrum tanu is unique a look at 2 assures us that that is quite not the case for the wn are almost arbitrarily chosen we can obtain restrictions on the wn by imposing additional conditions on the function here we ask for boundedness of the derivative on r 1 2 applications let us see how useful it is to have an mif with a bounded derivative on r with two applications 1 we describe the sufficient condition for the gap problem as described in 8 if d p q 0 then there does exist a nonzero measure supported on such that vanishes on an interval of positive length hered p q refers to the interior beurling malliavin density of there are several equivalent definitions of d to understand the most relevant definitions here let us clarify a few things given a separated sequence on r it s counting funtion n is the step function that jumps by 1 unit at each point in and is 0 at 0 for a 0 a sequence is said to be a regular if r n pxq ax 1 x 2 dx 8 we now define the interior bm density as follows d p q supta d an a regular subsequence 1 u using this definition it is easy to see that a regular sequences have interior density equal to a 0 such sequences are also po lya i e it has the following property if there is an entire function f of zero exponential type that is bounded on this sequence then f must be a constant this was proved by de branges in 4 and it s connection with the gap problem is described in 8 thus for regular sequences the gap condition holds the proof of the gap condition is much simpler in the case the there is an mif with as spectrum and bounded derivative on r let us explain briefly de branges motivation for having an mif with bounded derivative we refer the reader to 4 for definitions and results consider an entire function e satisfying the inequality epzq epz q for z p c such functions are usually called de branges functions the de branges space be associated with e is the space of entire functions f such that f pzq epzq and f pzq e pzq are in h 2 pc q the hardy space on c here e pzq epz q every de branges function e gives rise to a meromorphic inner function as follows pzq e pzq epzq conversely every mif gives rise to a de branges function see for instance 5 thus every mif corresponds to a de branges space of entire functions let ptq ei ptq on r the phase function of epzq is defined as 1 2 ptq now we recall our discussion in the introduction wherein we mentioned that de branges required the gap condition to hold for a certain regular sequence i e he required the existence of a measure that was supported on this regular sequence such that it s fourier transform vanished on an interval of positive length the crucial result that he used was the existence of a certain de branges space of entire functions on c with some conditions on the mean type of the space he was able to do this using the fact that 1 is uniformly bounded on r we refer the reader to theorem 65 in 4 for details 2 we will refer to 7 for this application we use the standard notation hpp hppc qq to denote hardy spaces and n tg h g h p h 8 h is outeru to denote the smirnov nevanlinna class 3 in c given an inner function we define model spaces in the smirnov class and general hardy spaces to be the spaces k r s tf p n x c prq f p n u kpr s k r s x lpprq we recall that to every u p l 8 prq there corresponds the toeplitz operator tu h 2 h 2 defined as tu pfq p pufq where p is the projection onto h 2 the toeplitz kernel is defined as n ru s kertu as with model spaces we can also define the toeplitz kernels in the smirnov class and hardy spaces as n ru s tf p n x l 1 locprq uf p n u n pru s n ru s x lpprq p 0 p 8 q as described in 7 these kernels play a crucial role in answering questions in the inverse spectral theory of differential operators and completeness problems of families of functions among others let us consider one such problem let ei be a meromorphic inner function and let r we say that is a defining set for if for any other meromorphic inner function ei on it has been described in 7 that a sufficient condition for to be a defining set for is for to be a uniqueness set for k 8 r 2 s this condition translates to one about toeplitz kernels theorem 1 is a uniqueness set for k 8 r s if and only if for every meromorphic inner function j such that pjq we have that n 8 r js 0 thus the non triviality of toeplitz kernels n 8 r js is useful in answering questions about defining sets in particular for mifs that have a bounded derivative these questions are easier to answer let us refer to the following two theorems theorem 2 suppose is a tempered inner function then for any mermorphic inner function j and any p 0 npr js 0 dn n 8 rb n js 0 by being tempered one simply means that 1 has at most polynomial growth at 8 i e dn 1 pxq op x n q x 8 here the n we obtain in the theorem is the same as n regarding the growth of 1 thus in the case of bounded derivative 1 we have that n pr js 0 n 8 r js 0 the next theorem comes under the heading of beurling malliavin multiplier theorem theorem 3 suppose is a meromorphic inner function satisfying 1 const then for any meromorphic inner function j we have n r js 0 n 8 rs js 0 the space n contains n 8 and hence it is easier to construct functions in these spaces similarly it is often easier to work with n 2 which is a subspace of the hardy space h 2 using the above theorems we can just restrict our attention to these larger spaces in case has a bounded derivative as mentioned in 7 in the case of a general bounded where j ei we cannot multiply down to h 8 elements of n ru sp n 2 ru sq even by using factors like s thus an mif having a bounded derivative is an extremely useful object 4 2 main results we ll denote the gaps between the successive ans as n an 1 an n 0 an an 1 n 0 4 in their paper 6 makarov and poltoratski have proved the existence of the required inner function when the n are uniformly bounded our approach in this paper will be to consider sequences characterized by the growth of their gaps we start with gaps that are increasing but very slowly formally the gaps obey the relation ln an ln ln n n ln an here and throughout the paper fpnq gpnq will denote the existence of constants c 1 c 2 0 such that c 1 fpnq gpnq c 2 fpnq for large enough n and fpnq gpnq will mean fpnq cgpnq for some c 0 and large enough n it turns out that this case is a generalization of the result proved in 6 lemma 1 if tanu is a sequence in r and the n defined by 4 are such that n 1 n ln an ln ln n n ln an then there is a meromorphic inner function on c such that tanu is the spectrum of and 1 is uniformly bounded next we consider sequences with slightly larger gaps baranov s counter example of the one sided sequence n leads us to ask the natural question if we have n on one side how sparse can the sequence be on the other side simple computations tell us that on the other side the gaps may be at most geometrically increasing i e n ec n for some c 0 to put it precisely observation 1 let be an mif on c with uniformly bounded derivative on r and the spectrum of if x r and n then d a c 0 such that n ec n for n p proof if zn xn iyn are the zeros of ei then 1 pxq n yn px xnq 2 y 2 n we notice that these are sums of poissons kernels with the property that r yn px xnq 2 y 2 n dx let us restrict our attention to the zeroes in the upper right quadrant i e xn 0 and yn 0 for any t 0 and fixed xn the integral 0 t yn px xnq 2 y 2 n dx attains minimum at y 2 n xnpxn tq t and increases for y 2 n xnpxn tq t but we notice that 0 t yn px xnq 2 y 2 n dx 0 t 1 pxqdx p q x pt 0 q so when t is large enough then larger the yns the denser thus to explore the case when is as sparse as possible we must assume that yn k for all n for some k 0 on the other hand the zeros of must be bounded away from the real line in order for 1 to be bounded thus we can assume without loss of generality that yn 1 consider the entire function e associated with i e pzq e pzq epzq epzq epzq these functions are called de branges functions associated with an mif we refer the reader to 4 and 8 for more on de branges functions we know that e e has zeroes on n at least and so must be of exponential type at least thus the exponential type of e is at least and so the zeros of e are of the form zn n iyn where n p n then p q x pt 0 q 0 t n 1 px nq 2 1 dx n t 1 n ln t 5 the extreme case in the above situation i e when n ec n has the property that the gaps are co measurable i e n n 1 this gives us motivation for our next result where we analyse a more general case of co measurable gaps we recall that the choice of the weights wn determine the growth of the function let us choose wn n lemma 2 if an is a separated sequence on r and n defined as in 4 are such that n 1 n and n pln an q 2 then by choosing wn n defined as in 3 is a meromorphic inner function on c with spectrum tanu 8 8 such that 1 is uniformly bounded on r some examples of such sequences are an psgnnq n k where k 0 and an psgnnqr n where r 1 next we consider sequences that are sparse by sparse we mean sequences that are at least geometrically increasing with common ratio bigger than 1 for instance an psgnnqee n the following statement may seem technical but all that is being said is if we consider finite clusters of points such that consecutive clusters are sparse then choosing the weights wn 1 the corresponding inner function will have a bounded derivative on r lemma 3 for each n p n let us consider a finite sequence cluster of points tajnu 1 j mn mn being uniformly bounded that is defined by the property a j 1 n a j n 1 as n 8 and 1 j mn moreover the gaps between consecutive clusters is large in the sense that there is a d 0 such that a j n 1 al n 1 d 0 for n 0 and a j n 1 aln 1 d 0 for n 0 then there is a meromorphic inner function such p q tajnu and 1 is uniformly bounded on r to summarize we have the following theorem 4 let tanu be a separated sequence on r satisfying one of the conditions below 1 n 1 n and ln an ln ln n n ln an or 2 n 1 n and n pln an q 2 or 3 there is a d 0 such that the sequence can be partitioned into clusters tajnun with number of points in each cluster being uniformly bounded such that for any cluster a j n a j 1 n 1 and between successive clusters a j n 1 al n 1 d 0 then there exists a meromorphic inner function with spectrum tanu with uniformly bounded derivative on r the above results cover a wide range of sequences what happens when the sequence falls in none of these categories there are several ways ways in which this could happen and we have a partial converse which is inspried by baranov s counter example as described in 2 let us first state baranov s result proposition 1 let tanu be a separated sequence with the following property given any n 0 there is a cluster tanuk nn k such that ak m ak m for 1 m n and ak n 1 ak n n then any mif with spectrum tanu must have unbounded derivative on r in essence this sequence has arithmetic clusters followed by unbounded large gaps we generalise this result as follows let tanu be a sequence of points on r and a d 0 be a constant such that given any n 1 there is a cluster of points tanunn 1 such that a 2 a 1 nd and an 1 an d for n 2 notice that this sequence has clusters whose size grows unboundedly thus excluding case 3 from above and 1 n 2 thus the gaps are not co measurable i e n ffi n 1 such sequences serve as counterexamples and we state the result below proposition 2 suppose tsnu is a separated sequence on the real line and d 0 is a constant such that given any n 0 there is a subset ttnunn 1 such that pt 1 tn q tsmu ttnunn 1 for which t 2 t 1 nd and 6 tn 1 tn d for all 2 n n 1 and let be an mif with this spectrum tsnu then given any 0 there is a zero zn xn iyn of such that 0 yn hence 1 is unbounded on r the above result can be used to prove that even in the regular case we are not assured of an mif with bounded derivative we describe this in the last section another way to characterize non sparsity would be to have growing clusters that are sparser than any arithmetic progression with common ratio approaching 1 intertwining with a subsequence having non comeasurable gaps some other cases that we still don t know about is when the gaps are co measurable n n 1 and 1 the gaps are very small n ln an ln ln n 2 the gaps are in between i e ln an n ln 2 an 3 the sequence has clusters and gaps i e n pln an q 2 and n ln an 3 proofs and details as mentioned before we closely follow the proof of the result in 6 to give a proof of lemma 1 proof we use krein s shift formula to create a meromorphic inner function define bn an an 1 2 and let e n pan bnq to define the function 1 i log 1 1 ku ic u 1 e 1 2 c p r 5 let 1 and 1 be the corresponding aleksandrov clark s measures defined by the herglotz

obtained the estimate n neln ln n n ln n let us now indulge in a simple observation that will aid us in proving as well as understanding the proofs of lemmas 2 and 3 we recall the construction of the inner function as described in the first section using cauchy s estimate it is easy to see that if there is a strip around the real axis on which the function is 8 uniformly bounded then the derivative on the real line is also uniformly bounded in other words if there are constants c m 0 such that for z c pzq m then 1 pxq 1 2 z x c pzq z x 2 dz m c we recall 1 and the relationship of with the cauchy transform 3 to formulate a sufficient condition observation 2 if there exist constansts c m 0 such that for 0 z c we have k pzq 1 m then the mif pk 1 q pk 1 q is such that 1 is uniformly bounded on r conversely however it is only required that there be a zero free strip for about the real axis in order to prove lemma 2 we need the following result lemma 4 if n 1 n then choosing wn n n we have n k wn an ak wnan 1 a 2 n ln ak let us see the effect of this result in the situation when the gaps in the sequence are at least logarithmically increasing proof of lemma 2 let c be a constant such that n c ln 2 an let us choose and fix a c we will separate the real line into two disjoint sets 1 x p pak 1 ak 2 ak ak 1 2 q and x ak 2 k ln ak 2 x p pak 1 ak 2 ak ak 1 2 q and x ak 2 k ln ak case 1 we take derivatives in 3 to obtain the estimate 1 pzq 1 2 wn z an 2 for any x p pak 1 ak 2 ak ak 1 2 q and x ak 2 k ln ak 8 1 pxq wk px akq 2 k 2 2 k 4 pln ak q 2 4 pln 2 ak q 2 k 1 case 2 we first notice that for z p dpb rq where b 1 2 ak ak 1 2 ak 1 ak 2 and r ak 1 ak 1 4 we have that k pzq k pakq 1 for n k wn an ak wn an z n k wnpak zq pan akqpan zq n k n k pan akqpan zq nrtk 1 k k 1 u n k pan akq 2 k rzpak 1 ak 1 q dt pt akq 2 1 9 let x p pak 1 ak 2 ak ak 1 2 q and x ak k 2 ln ak then for any z p d x k 2 pln ak q k pzq wk ak z wkak 1 a 2 k i k wi ai z wiai 1 a 2 i k k 2 ln ak k ak c 1 ln ak ln ak 2 c 1 ln ak op 1 q where c 1 is such that i k wi ai z wiai 1 a 2 i c 1 ln ak by lemma 4 thus by choosing a sufficiently small we have that k is bounded away from 1 we notice that is independent of k thus k is large on disks centred at points close to the ans we recall obsertaion 2 which stated that it is sufficient to have a strip above the real line on which k is bounded away from 1 here we obtain a slightly weaker configuration we have disks with centres at ak and radii k 2 ln ak 1 such that at each point z in the disk k is bounded away from 1 thus 1 pxq is bounded for x p pak 1 ak 2 ak ak 1 2 q and x ak k 2 ln ak cases 1 and 2 together give us that 1 is bounded on r let s now prove lemma 4 proof the proof is essentially computation of integrals the underlying idea is that when n 1 n the singular measure now with weight at wn equal to the gap n at an behaves like the lebesgue measure explicitly we look at the following calculations let n k then wn an ak n 1 an ak an an 1 dt t ak and wnan 1 a 2 n an an 1 tdt 1 t 2 thus 0 8 n k 1 wn an ak wnan 1 a 2 n 8 ak 1 t ak t 1 t 2 dt ln t ak 1 2 ln 1 t 2 8 ak ln ak where is just some arbitrary positive number that is say 1 2 identical calculations exist for the sum n k wn an ak wnan 1 a 2 n we now prove the following result leading to the proof of lemma 3 this lemma considers sparse singletons which we will generalize to sparse clusters lemma 5 let tanu be a sequence on r such that 1 akak 1 d 0 k 0 and 1 ak ak 1 d 0 k 0 where d is independent of k then there is a meromorphic inner function on c with spectrum tanu whose derivative is uniformly bounded in r proof we will use lemma 5 2 in 1 to prove this result first note that the ratio test for convergence of a series gives us that 8 n 8 1 an 8 we also notice that for all n k ak an 1 min d d 1 d d 9 for if n k then 1 ak an 1 ak ak 1 d and for n k ak an 1 d 1 d we notice that this also tells us that ak k 1 d for all k let us choose the weights wn 1 10 we rearrange terms n k wn an ak anwn 1 a 2 n n k 1 a 2 n a 2 n anak pan akqp 1 a 2 nq n k 1 pan akqp 1 a 2 nq n k anak pak anqp 1 a 2 nq s 1 s 2 then s 1 n k 1 pak anqp 1 a 2 nq n k 1 a 2 n 8 and s 2 n k anak pak anqp 1 a 2 nq n k ak k an 1 a 2 n 1 d n k 1 an 8 thus we have that sup n n k wn an ak anwn 1 a 2 n 8 hence by lemma 5 2 in 1 the corresponding mif defined by 3 has uniformly bounded derivative on r the hypothesis of the above lemma characterizes sequences which are sparse i e at least geometrically increasing with common ratio strictly bigger than 1 thus gaps that grow rapidly but are still finite do indeed have the required inner function notice that we could make this result stronger by allowing sequences that instead of singletons have finite bunches that are sparsely distributed for each bunch would contribute a uniformly bounded weight to the existing sum we prove lemma 3 proof of lemma 3 suppose we choose one point from each cluster and call it aj 0 m 0 then by the proof of the previous lemma n m 0 wjn a j n aj 0 m 0 ajnw j n 1 pajnq 2 n m 0 1 a j n aj 0 m 0 ajn 1 pajnq 2 b where b is a bound independent of k consider a point aj 0 n 0 and let the in the sum denote summation over all points except aj 0 m 0 1 a j n aj 0 m 0 ajn 1 pajnq 2 j j 0 1 a j m 0 a j 0 m 0 ajm 0 1 pajm 0 q 2 n i 0 1 j nm 1 a j n aj 0 m 0 ajn 1 pajnq 2 s n n k 1 an ak an 1 a 2 n s nb where s and b are constants the maximum size of each cluster n assures that s is independent of m 0 and n 0 and we know from the previous lemma that b is independent of m 0 and n 0 we now proceed to the last part of our discussion before we begin our proof of proposition 2 let us elucidate some notations let us enumerate the zeroes znp xn iynq of and let pxq ei pxq on r let us pick and fix a large n and let ttiu be a set of points on r as described in the statement of the lemma let s be the box pt 2 tn q p 0 ndq and t the box pt 1 t 2 q p 0 ndq let a be the mid point of the interval pt 2 tnq and let s be the box pt 2 a q p 0 ndq on the adjacent interval let c be the point in pt 1 t 2 q such that a t 2 t 2 c since zn form the zeroes of the blaschke product of we can write 1 pxq n yn px xnq 2 y 2 n 11 proof suppose that the zeros are bounded away from the real line i e there is a 0 such that yn for all all the zeros zn xn iyn of without loss of generality let 1 we have that for t p pc t 2 q and s p pt 2 a q znrsyt yn ps xnq 2 y 2 n znrsyt yn pt xnq 2 y 2 n where 0 is a constant independent of n then a t 2 znrsyt yn ps xnq 2 y 2 n dt t 2 c znrsyt yn pt xnq 2 y 2 n dt and the zeros in the box t pt 1 t 2 q p 0 ndq induce the following inequality a t 2 znpt yn ps xnq 2 y 2 n ds t 2 c znpt yn pt xnq 2 y 2 n dt let z be the number of zeros tznu in the box s then a t 2 znps yn ps xnq 2 y 2 n z then a t 2 znps yndt ps xnq 2 y 2 n a t 2 npz psyt qc t yn ps xnq 2 y 2 n dt n thus n 1 z this gives us that z n 1 thus for a large enough n z n 2 in a similar vein it can be proved that the box s contains at least n 4 zeroes and for any subinterval of the form pt 2 uq containing nu points from p q the box pt 2 uq p 0 ndq contains at least nu 2 zeros we know that tn t 2 pn 1 qd for n 2 thus enumerating the zeros inside s we have xn t 2 2 pn 1 qd thus t 2 c 1 ptqdt t 2 c s yn pt xnq 2 y 2 n dt t 2 c n 4 n 1 yn pt pt 2 ndqq 2 y 2 n dt n 4 n 1 t 2 c 1 pt pt 2 ndqq 2 1 dt n 4 n

the placement of other points does not affect the calculations above we can make such clusters and gaps along a very rare subsequence of n without affecting the regularity for example let us consider the following sequence nza where a t 2 nk mu for m 1 2 k where nk is a rare subsequence of n say the sequence nk 3 k then we have gaps of length k which is unbounded followed by clusters with gaps of size 1 the size of the clusters 2 nk 1 this sequence is a regular where a 1 for r n pxq x 1 x 2 dx k k 1 p 2 nkq 2 8 thus even for regular sequences there may not exist any mif with bounded derivative
