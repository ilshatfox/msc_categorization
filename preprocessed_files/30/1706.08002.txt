references 36 1 introduction toeplitz operator tu with symbol u l r on the hardy space h 2 in the upper half plane c is defined as tuf p uf where p denotes the orthogonal projection from l 2 r onto h 2 see sec tion 2 3 for further discussion this standard definition can be extended to larger function spaces and more general symbols to accommodate various ap plications of toeplitz type operators in complex and harmonic analysis a recently developed approach based on the use of toeplitz operators brought new progress to the area of uncertainty principle in harmonic analysis up see for instance 21 22 33 this note is devoted to further develop ment of the toeplitz approach one of the cases of the toeplitz operator which appears most often in ap plications is the operator with the symbol u i j where i and j are inner functions recall that a bounded analytic function in the upper half plane is called inner if its boundary values are unimodular almost everywhere with respect to lebesgue measure on the boundary inner functions constitute arguably the most important collection of func tions in the standard one dimensional complex function theory starting with the seminal result by beurling which says that all closed invariant subspaces of the shift operator sf f 7 zf in the hardy space h 2 in the unit disk have the form h 2 where is inner these functions became a focal toeplitz order 3 point of research for complex analysts beurling s result implies that the in variant subspaces for the operator adjoint to s the backward shift operator s f f 7 f f 0 z have the form k h 2 h 2 h 2 this property of the spaces k put them into the foundation of the famous nagy foias functional model theory which says that any completely non unitary contractive operator t in a hilbert space h satisfying t nx 0 for all x h is unitarily equivalent to a compression of multiplication by z on one of such k spaces for a properly chosen inner function in general such spaces are vector valued see 26 these fundamental results demonstrated the importance of inner functions and related spaces in function theoretic problems stemming from functional analysis such problems became the main stream of complex function theory in the last several decades of the 20 th century at present inner functions are firmly established as a key ingredient of complex analysis and appear in most of its applications including harmonic analysis control theory spectral theory of differential operators signal processing and mathemat ical physics via the same connections toeplitz operators of the type ti j where i and j are inner functions appear in many of such applications problems on injectivity and invertibility of toeplitz operators with symbols i j have been known to play crucial role in the study of riesz bases frames and completeness in various function spaces see for instance 14 21 as was mentioned before recently such operators have become a central object in the toeplitz approach to up 21 22 33 via the toeplitz approach these and similar operators apply to many fields of analysis including questions in fourier analysis and spectral problems for differential operators see for instance 21 33 23 24 intuitively the property that the toeplitz operator ti j has a non trivial kernel means that i is in some sense larger than j similarly invertibility of such an operator indicates that i and j are equivalent or have roughly the same size however as we will discuss in section 3 2 neither of these properties can yield a formal definition of order or equivalence since they lack axiomatic properties of transitivity and reflexivity correspondingly in this note we attempt to fix this problem and lift these intuitive notions to the level of formal order and equivalence via the toeplitz approach the new order encompasses a variety of problems and applications mentioned above it reveals relations between problems of complex and harmonic analysis and helps to systematize some of the well known questions from the area of up and its applications the goal of this paper is to present the basic definitions and properties of toeplitz order outline its connections with known problems and to suggest further directions for research acknowledgment this paper is based on a mini course given at the uni versite paul sabatier toulouse in october of 2016 as a part of cimi the matic semester in analysis i am very grateful to the organizers serban 4 a poltoratski belinschi stefanie petermichl and pascal thomas for giving me a reason and an opportunity to collect my thoughts on this subject 2 preliminaries 2 1 inner functions in this note we will mostly concern ourselves with inner functions in the upper half plane c such functions can be repre sented as a product i b j whereb is the blaschke product corresponding to the sequence n c of zeros of i and j is a singular inner function corresponding to a pos itive singular measure on r r the measure can be represented as c where is poisson finite on r i e d x 1 x 2 and c 0 is the mass at infinity the singular function j is defined as j e s e s icz where s is the schwarz integral of s z 1 i 1 t z t 1 t 2 d t the blaschke product b for n is defined as b cn z n z n where cn are unimodular constants chosen so that cn i n i n 0 if is an infinite sequence then the necessary and sufficient condition for the normal convergence of the partial products of b is that satisfies the blaschke condition n 1 n 2 throughout this paper we will use the notation sa z eiaz for the complex exponential function which is the singular inner function corresponding to the pointmass a 0 at infinity using our notations sa ja similar statements and formulas are true for the case of the unit disk see for instance 12 16 a special role in our notes will be played by meromorphic inner functions mif which are inner functions in the upper half plane that can be extended meromorphically to the whole plane the above formulas imply that an inner function is a mif if and only if its blaschke factor corresponds to a discrete sequence c a sequence without finite accumulation points and the measure in the singular factor is a point mass at infinity i e j s a eiaz for some non negative a toeplitz order 5 2 2 model spaces and clark theory for each inner function z one may consider a model subspace k h 2 h 2 of the hardy space h 2 h 2 c here stands for the orthogonal difference i e k is the orthogonal complement of the space h 2 f f h 2 in h 2 as was mentioned in the introduction these subspaces play an important role in complex and harmonic analysis as well as in operator theory see 26 each inner function z defines a positive harmonic function 1 z 1 z and by the herglotz representation a positive measure such that 1 z 1 z py 1 yd t x t 2 y 2 z x iy 2 1 for some p 0 the number p can be viewed as a point mass at infinity the measure is a singular poisson finite measure supported on the set where non tangential limits of are equal to 1 the measure p on r r is called the clark measure for z following standard notations we will sometimes denote the clark measure defined in 2 1 by 1 if c 1 then is the measure defined by 2 1 with replaced by in some settings it is convenient to call the measue 1 the clark dual of the measure 1 conversely for every positive poisson finite singular measure and a num ber p 0 there exists an inner function z satisfying 2 1 every function f k has non tangential boundary values 1 a e and can be recovered from these values via the formula f z p 2 i 1 z f t 1 t dt 1 z 2 i f t t z d t 2 2 see 29 if the clark measure does not have a point mass at infinity the formula is simplified to f z 1 z kf 2 3 where kf stands for the cauchy integral kf z 1 2 i f t t z d t 2 4 this gives an isometry of l 2 onto k the clark measure 1 has a point mass at infinity if and only if 1 t l 2 r similar formulas can be written for any corresponding to for any 1 and any f k f has non tangential boundary values a e on r those boundary values can be used in 2 2 or 2 3 to recover f 6 a poltoratski in the case of meromorphic z mif every function f k also has a meromorphic extension in c and it is given by the formula 2 2 each meromorphic inner function z can be written as t ei t on r where t is a real analytic and strictly increasing function the function t arg t is a continuous branch of the argument of z for any inner function in the upper half plane we define its spectrum spec as the closure of the set 1 the set of points on the line where the non tangential limit of is equal to 1 plus the infinite point if the corresponding clark measure has a point mass at infinity i e if p in 2 1 is positive if spec r then p in 2 1 is 0 recall that a sequence of real points is discrete if it has no finite accumulation points note that spec is discrete if and only if is meromorphic the corresponding clark measure is discrete with masses at the points of the set 1 given by x 2 x plus possibly a point mass at infinity related similarly to the derivative at infinity if r r is a given discrete sequence one can easily construct a mero morphic inner function satisfying 1 by considering a positive poisson finite measure concentrated on and then choosing to satisfy 2 1 one can prescribe the derivatives of at with a proper choice of pointmasses the same construction shows that an arbitrary continuous growing function on r can be approximated up to a bounded function by the argument of a meromorphic inner function if 2 n then constructed as above with 1 satisfies arg 2 on r furthermore if 2 n 1 one can easily construct so that 1 and 1 and achieve an even better approximation arg for more information and further references on clark measures see 30 2 3 toeplitz kernels recall that the toeplitz operator tu with a symbol u l r is the map tu h 2 h 2 f 7 p uf where p is the riesz projection i e the orthogonal projection from l 2 r onto the hardy space h 2 passing from a function in h 2 to its non tangential boundary values on r h 2 can be identified with a closed sub space of l 2 r formed by functions f l 2 r whose fourier transform f is supported on 0 which makes the riesz projection correctly defined we will use the following notation for kernels of toeplitz operators or toeplitz kernels in h 2 n u ker tu toeplitz order 7 an important observation is that n k if is an inner function along with h 2 kernels one may consider toeplitz kernels np u in other hardy classes hp the kernel n 1 u in the weak space h 1 hp l 1 0 p 1 or the kernel in the smirnov class n c defined as n u f n l 1 loc r u f n for n and similarly for other spaces if is a meromorphic inner function k n can also be considered for more on such kernels see 33 2 4 entire functions and de branges spaces recall that an entire function f z is said to be of exponential type at most a 0 if f z o ea z as z the infimum of such a is the exponential type of f throughout the paper we denote by the poisson measure on r d x dx 1 x 2 a classical theorem of krein gives a connection between the smirnov class n c and the cartwright class ca consisting of all entire functions f z of exponential type a which satisfy log f t l 1 an entire function f z belongs to the cartwright class ca if and only if f z s a z n c and f z s a z n c where f z f z recall that a paley wiener space pwa is defined as a space of entire func tions of exponential type at most a which belong to l 2 r equivalently pwa ca l 2 r as an immediate consequence one obtains a connec tion between the hardy space h 2 c and the paley wiener space pwa namely an entire function f z belongs to the paley wiener class pwa if and only if f z s a z h 2 c f z s a z h 2 c the definition of the de branges spaces of entire functions may be viewed as a generalization of the last definition of the paley wiener spaces with s a z replaced by a more general entire function consider an entire function e z satisfying the inequality e z e z z c such functions are usually called de branges functions the de branges spaceb e associated with e z is defined to be the space of entire functions 8 a poltoratski f z satisfying f z e z h 2 c f z e z h 2 c it is a hilbert space equipped with the norm f e f e l 2 r if e z is of exponential type then all the functions in the de branges space b e are of exponential type not greater then the type of e z see for example the last part in the proof of lemma 3 5 in 10 a de branges space is called short or regular if together with every function f z it contains f z f a z a for any a c one of the most important features of de branges spaces is that they admit a second axiomatic definition let h be a hilbert space of entire functions that satisfies the following axioms a 1 if f h f 0 then f z z z h with the same norm a 2 for any 6 r point evaluation at is a bounded linear functional on h a 3 if f h then f h with the same norm then h b e for a suitable de branges function e this is theorem 23 in 7 usually for a given hilbert space of entire functions it is not difficult to check the above axioms and conclude that the space is a de branges space if the axioms do hold it is however a challenging problem in many situations to find a generating function e this problem can be viewed as a deep and abstract generalization of the inverse spectral problem for second order differential operators every de branges space b e is a reproducing kernel hilbert space i e for each point c there exists a function k b e such that f f k for any f b e the reproducing kernel k is given by the formula k z e z e e z e 2 i z it is not difficult to show that for any de branges function e sequences of reproducing kernels k where r e e for some constant 1 form orthogonal bases of b e moreover these are the only orthogonal bases of reproducing kernels de branges spaces possess the so called nesting property which makes krein de branges theory especially suitable to study spectral problems for differen tial operators it says that for any two de branges spaces b e 1 and b e 2 isometrically embedded into a third de branges space either b e 1 b e 2 or b e 2 b e 1 it follows that any space b e admits a unique chain of subspaces b et 0 t 1 monotone by inclusion with e 0 const and toeplitz order 9 e 1 e in the case of so called jump intervals the parameter t may not take all values from 0 to 1 moreover for any positive poisson finite measure on r there is a unique regular chain of de branges spaces isometrically embedded into l 2 every de branges function e z gives rise to a mif z e z e z e z and a model space k that this inner function generates there exists a well known isometric isomorphism between b e and k given by f f e conversely for every mif there exists a de branges function e such that e such a function e is unique up to a multiplication by a real entire function without zeros in c r an entire function is called real if it is real on r we call a de branges function e an hermite biehler hb function if it has no zeros on the real line for a given mif one can always choose the corresponding de branges function e to be an hb function as was mentioned above if is a mif then all clark measures of are discrete and their point masses can be computed by 2 for we will call the measures e 2 where is a clark measure for z e z e z spectral measures of the corresponding de branges space it is well known and follows from a similar property for clark measures that for any spectral measure of a de branges space b e the natural embedding gives an isometric isomorphism between b e and l 2 this isomorphism generalizes the parseval theorem on the real line each inner z coming from a de branges function can be written as t ei t t r where t is real analytic strictly increasing function a continuous branch of the argument of z on r the phase function of the corresponding de branges space is defined by t t 2 and is equal to arge throughout this paper we will utilize the following notations for the objects discussed in the last several sections if e is an hb function we will denote by e the corresponding mif e e e if is a positive singular poisson finite measure on r we denote by the inner function with the clark measure equal to even though for a mif the function e such that e is not unique we will use the notation e for one of such functions the reader may think of a function with lowest order and type among all such hb functions e 3 toeplitz order to and equivalence te 3 1 main definitions in this section we use toeplitz operators to define partial order and equivalence on the set of inner functions in the upper half plane our definitions can be naturally extended to broader classes of functions and measures see section 3 2 below however in this note we choose to concentrate on the inner case moreover in most applications 10 a poltoratski discussed in the rest of this paper the inner functions are meromorphic mifs we begin with the following definition recall that n u denotes the h 2 kernel of the toeplitz operator with symbol u definition 1 if is an inner function we define its toeplitz dominance set d as d i inner n i 6 0 every collection of sets admits natural partial ordering by inclusion in our case we consider dominance sets d as subsets of the set of all inner functions in the upper half plane and the partial order on this collection this partial order induces a preorder on the set of all inner functions in c proceeding in a standard way we can modify this preorder into a partial order by introducing equivalence classes of inner functions the details of this definition are as follows definition 2 we will say that two inner functions i and j are toeplitz equivalent writing i t j if d i d j this equivalence relation divides the set of all inner functions in c into equivalence classes we call this relation toeplitz equivalence te further we introduce a partial order on these equivalence classes defining it as follows definition 3 we write i t 6 j meaning that the equivalence class of i is less or equal than the equivalence class of j if d i d j we call this partial order on the set of inner functions in c toeplitz order to the following simple examples illustrate our definitions example 1 let bn and bk be blaschke products of degree n and k corre spondingly then bn t bk iff n k and bn t bk iff n k if j and j are two singular functions j t 6 j if is a non negative measure however there exist and such that but j t 6 j as follows from an example given in 3 it is a good exercise on toeplitz kernels to establish the statements of the above example 3 2 extensions of to and other orderings as was explained in sec tion 2 2 clark theory provides a natural one to one correspondence between inner functions in c and positive singular poisson finite measures on r via this correspondence one may introduce toeplitz equivalence and order on the set of all such measures i e for any two positive singular poisson finite measures and t if i t i and t 6 if i t 6 i similarly toeplitz toeplitz order 11 order on inner functions induces an order on hermite biehler functions de branges spaces canonical systems model spaces model contractions etc in the same way one can order the set of all unimodular functions on the real line if u ei is a unimodular function on r and is a measurable real function then one can defined its dominance set d u as the set of inner functions such that n u is non trivial after that once again using the ordering of dominance sets by inclusion one can introduce equivalence classes on the set of unimodular functions and partial order on those classes in a slightly different way one may view the ordering described above as an ordering of equivalence classes of real measurable functions on r defined as t 6 if ei t 6 ei analogously to can be moved from the upper half plane to the unit disk or even more general domains without any changes in the above definitions to can be extended to bounded analytic functions in c or even unbounded functions if one is willing to deal with unbounded toeplitz operators using quadratic forms one can consider toeplitz operators with distribu tional symbols if m is a distribution on r then d m can be defined as the set of inner functions such that t m exists and has a non trivial kernel after finding a way to overcome obvious technical difficulties in this defini tion one can proceed with an extension of to to this class in particular one obtains a different way to extend to to the set of measures and it may be interesting to study relations with the extension outlined above perhaps the simplest way to order inner functions is by division i e to say that i j if i divides j if j i is an inner function the main flaw of the order by division is that most pairs of inner functions remain incomparable it is easy to see that to is an extension of the order by division since i t 6 j whenever i divides j see section 5 1 while for two functions to be comparable in the order by division the zero set of one has to be a subset of the zero set of the other in to one zero set only needs to be near the other another way to define an order on inner functions is to say that i j if n i j 6 0 or if n i j 6 0 the kernel in the smirnov class n these orders are different from ours the n order is related to and used implicitly in the beurling malliavin theory this order is meaningful but less relevant to problems discussed in these notes as follows from lemma 1 to is a proper extension of the h version of the above order while all versions of toeplitz order mentioned in this section seem to be interesting in this note we will concentrate on the inner version of to in c as defined in the last section 12 a poltoratski 4 structure of the dominance set d the goal of this section is to study the dominance set d the key element of toeplitz order we will identify two important subsets of d the sets of base and total elements and discuss their relations with adjacent questions 4 1 difference of arguments let i j be two mifs and let us denote by i j the difference of arguments 1 2 arg i arg j recall that the argument of a mif on the real line can be chosen as a real analytic function and therefore the last expression makes sense if i j is poisson summable then its harmonic conjugate exists and we will denote by h i j the outer function exp i note that then h i j 1 h j i clearly a sufficient condition for i t j is that has a bounded harmonic conjugate i e 0 c h c on r for some constants c and c indeed in that case f n i l iff hf n j l which implies that d i d j however this condition is not necessary example 2 let i b where n 2 n 1 i n n notice that then i o 1 x on r as x let us construct j in the following way for a rare subsequence nk 2 k k n pull the zeros closer to the real line i e define j i dk z 2 nk ick z nk z nk z 2 nk ick where ck 0 are positive constants tending to zero and dk are convergence constants then j i satisfies 0 c exp on r because exp qk 1 z nk 1 z 2 nk ick with proper convergence constants qk one can show that if ck tend to zero slow enough say ck 1 k we also have exp l 2 r i dx l r if f n i l for some mif l then hf n j l because f belongs to ki and hence is bounded on r by c i 1 2 conversely if f n j l then f h n i l because 1 h is bounded therefore i t j even though is unbounded 4 2 base and total elements of d we say that an inner function i d is a base element if it does not divide any other element of d in other words base elements are the maximal elements of d with respect to the order by division we will denote by db the set of all base elements of d toeplitz order 13 we denote by ba the blaschke factor with zero at a c ba a a z a z a if a 0 for some a c then a ba is a base element of d more generally one can show that if c a for some c c then ba bc is a base element where ba is the mo bius transform of the unit disk with zero at a ba z a 1 a z a general description of the set db in terms of is an important but difficult problem as we will see in section 7 it generalizes the problem of describing complete and minimal sequences of reproducing kernels in model and de branges spaces let i and j be two inner functions we say that f n i j is purely outer if f is outer and i jf g where g is outer note that then automatically f g we call an element i of d total if n i contains a purely outer function we chose this name for such elements because in a sense each total element represents a total inner component of one of the functions from n k indeed if if n for some inner i and outer f then if j f for some inner j then ijf f and therefore n ij contains a purely outer function and ij is a total element of d moreover every total element can be obtained this way i e it is a total inner component of a function from n combining inner components in both half planes we denote by dt the subset of all total elements of d one can show that together with each function i the set dt it contains every j such that i j is a finite blaschke product it follows that dt contains the set of all inner divisors i of such that i is a finite blaschke product finite products can be replaced is this statement with all blaschke products whose arguments satisfy 2 log h 2 here we denote by log h 2 the set of functions f f ln g g h 2 c in other words log h 2 consists of real functions f such that f l 1 and exp f l 2 where f max f 0 proposition 1 every element of d is a factor of a total element 14 a poltoratski to prove the last statement just notice that if ijf l f for some inner j l and outer f h 2 then jli is the desired total element in regard to relations between our new sets we have proposition 2 for every inner db dt d the sets dt and db are equal iff is a blaschke factor in which case they are also equal to d and consist of constants proof if i is a base element then the relation if j f implies that f is outer and j is constant otherwise i ji d which contradicts that i is a base element hence f n i is purely outer and i is also a total element the second statement follows from the fact dt contains base elements divided by any finite blaschke sub products notice that db cannot consist of singular functions only since together with every element d contains all of its inner divisors proposition 1 implies that d is determined by the set of its total elements the inverse statement follows from theorem 3 corollary 1 if i t j then dt i dt j to deduce the above corollary note that total elements of d are the total inner components of the de branges space the spaces b ei and b ej must coincide as sets by theorem 3 4 3 d and dt in terms of arguments it is not difficult to describe elements of dt in terms of arguments let us start with dt in the case when is a mif in this case all functions from dt are mifs and their arguments are real analytic functions on r defined uniquely up to 2 n recall the notation i j 1 2 arg i arg j proposition 3 i dt i log h 2 as to d recall that it consists of all divisors of functions from dt corollary 2 i belongs to d iff i h 1 2 where h log h 2 and is an argument of an inner function to establish the above statement simply notice that 1 2 for some argu ment of a mif is the argument of a purely outer element of n i with some additional effort one can find analogs of statements from this section for general non mif inner functions toeplitz order 15 4 4 total elements and de branges theorem 66 a well known the orem by l de branges theorem 66 from 7 page 271 is an important result in the area of up one can find a discussion of this result and its applications in 34 along with further references more general versions of this theorem from 31 32 played important roles in the study of the gap and type problems see also 33 here we present the statement from 31 corollary 4 in the settings of to theorem 1 let i be inner functions in c d i then there exists an inner function j in c such that specj speci and dt j the function j can be chosen so that the purely outer f n j is also zero free on r if is a meromorphic function then j can be chosen as a meromorphic function if i is a mif then f in the statement is analytic through r and the term zero free can be understood in the usual sense in the general case a function f h 2 has a zero at x r if f z x h 2 and a zero free function has no such points let us finish this section with the following problem given a collection of inner functions we will call the minimal d containing these functions the toeplitz hull th of our collection it seems to be an interesting question to find th for a given collection in view of our discussion in section 7 versions of this problem are equivalent to finding the minimal de branges space or model space for a given collection of zero sets etc 5 to and te in comparison with other relations 5 1 to as a proper extension of the order by division as was mentioned before another natural way to introduce a partial order on the set of inner functions is by division we say that an inner function i divides another inner function j if j i is an inner function the relation divides satisfies the axioms of a partial order toeplitz order introduced above is an extension of the order by division i e if i divides j then i t 6 j to is a proper extension because one can easily construct a pair of inner functions i and j such that i t 6 j but j does not divide i indeed choose any pair such that j divides i and j has at least one zero then that zero has also to be a zero of i take that zero of i and move it by a finite distance in c it is not difficult to show an exercise on toeplitz kernels that then we still have i t 6 j although j no longer divides i 16 a poltoratski 5 2 to versus dominance intuitively when n i j 6 0 for two inner functions i and j it means that i is larger than j this relation between i and j starts to resemble a strict order even more after one recalls that by a lemma of coburn n i j and n j i cannot be non trivial simultaneously formally however this relation does not constitute an order due to the lack of transitivity n i j n j l 0 does not imply n i l 0 accordingly the relation i j which can be defined to mean that n i j 0 and n j i 0 fails to produce a formal equivalence an interesting geometric connection for this relation is observed in 2 it is shown that for two inner functions i j holds if and only if the subspaces ih 2 and jh 2 viewed as points in the grassmanian manifold of all closed subspaces of l 2 are connected by a geodesic lack of transitivity for this relation can be illustrated by the following example example 3 let us construct three mifs i j and l such that i j and j l but i 6 l where the relation is defined as above let c 0 be a large number and let i be a blaschke product with zeros at n ic n z let j be the blaschke product with zeros at n ic for n 0 and at n 1 2 ic for n 0 finally let l be the blaschke product with zeros at n ic n z n 6 0 then 2 j i arg j arg i tends to 0 as x for large positive x x 2 where c is a small number c 0 as c from basic properties of toeplitz kernels since lim sup x x lim inf x x and lim sup x x lim inf x x both n i j 0 and n j i 0 i e i j similarly argl arg j tends to 0 as x and x 2 near which implies j l it is left to notice that n i l n b ci where bci z ci z ci is the blaschke factor and the kernel contains an h 2 function 1 z ci hence i 6 l to study the relations between to and triviality of kernels further let us formulate the following statement showing in particular that to is an ex tension of the order mentioned at the end of section 3 2 lemma 1 let i 1 and i 2 be non constant inner functions such that n i 1 i 2 6 0 then i 1 t i 2 proof if d i 2 then for f n i 2 and g n i 1 i 2 we have i 1 gf i 1 i 2 g i 2 f h 2 therefore d i 1 toeplitz order 17 5 3 te versus twins following 21 we will call two mifs i and j twins if speci specj this relation naturally appears in applications to spectral problems involving isospectral differential operators clearly twin relation is an equivalence relation on the set of all mifs which is different from the toeplitz equivalence it is obvious that i t j does not imply that i is a twin of j the opposite implication fails in general as well however we do have the following statement we use the notation f g for two functions f and g if c f g c f for some positive constants c and c and all values of the argument lemma 2 let i and j be two mif twins with the common spectrum r then i t j iff i j on proof let n xn and n xn be the clark measures of i and j respectively suppose first that i 6 j on then by the formula for pointmasses of clark measures given in section 2 2 n 6 n wlog we can assume that there exists f ki f l 2 such that f 6 h for any h l 2 let d i be the total inner component of f ki we can assume that it is the inner component of f in c since f 1 i kf is the inner factor of the cauchy integral kf if i t j then d j and there exists g kj such that kg is divisible by in c moreover by corollary 1 g can be chosen so that is its total inner component then kg kf is an entire function of exponential type zero without zeros hence it is a constant which implies f const g and we have a contradiction it is left to notice that if i j then l 2 l 2 which implies d i d j and i t j 5 4 te and invertibility another important relation between inner func tions which resembles equivalence comes from invertibility of the toeplitz operator with the symbol i j due to the work of hruschev nikolski and pavlov 14 this condition became one of the main tools in the study of basis properties for systems of reproducing kernels including the classical problem on exponential bases as a particular case up to some technical details a system of reproducing kernels k forms a riesz basis in a model space ki if and only if ti b is invertible intuitively the condition that ti j is invertible also tells us that the functions i and j are similar this relation is reflexive as ti j is invertible iff tj i is our next goal is to show that toeplitz equivalence is not the same as the invertibility of ti j as a matter of fact unlike toeplitz equivalence invertibility is not a formal equivalence since once again it lacks transitivity example 4 similar to example 3 construct i 1 i 2 i 3 so that the difference of arguments arg in 1 arg in n 1 2 18 a poltoratski is smooth and close to 3 at and to 3 at then ti nin 1 n 1 2 is invertible but ti 1 i 3 is not as follows from a theorem by devinatz and widom thus invertibility does not induce an equivalence relation 6 conditions for te while we do not see a reasonable if and only if condition which describes te in terms of the arguments or other requisites of inner functions here we give some simple one sided conditions for two mifs to be equivalent recall that for two inner functions i and j we denote by i j the function 1 2 arg i arg j if i t j then is poisson summable and h h i j stands for the outer function h e i h exp as was mentioned before if i j is bounded i e h i j is bounded and separated from zero on r then i t j this condition is not necessary as was shown in example 2 6 1 conditions in terms of arguments and derivatives our first necessary condition is in terms of the difference of arguments and derivatives lemma 3 let i and j be two mifs i t j then j i exp 2 1 on r proof by theorem 4 multiplication by h h j i is a bounded operator kj ki hence h x kjx x k i x hk j x ki k i x ki hk j x ki c i x 1 2 kjx kj c i x 1 2 j x 1 2 c j x i j 1 2 c kjx x i j 1 2 for all x r which implies one of the two estimates applying similar argument to the operator ki kj we obtain the other further metric properties of h give the following conditions theorem 2 let i j be mifs i j if the functions j 1 2 exp and i 1 2 exp belong to l 2 r then i t j if i t j then log 1 x log h 2 toeplitz order 19 proof by theorem 4 i t j iff multiplication by h i j is a bounded in vertible operator from ki to kj note that since every f ki satisfies f f 2 i 1 2 the conditions in the statement imply that hf h 2 and therefore hf kj similarly for every f kj f h ki note that two singular mifs cannot be equivalent unless they are constant multiples of each other hence if i t j then one of them say i has a zero if i a 0 then i ba is a base element of d i and therefore a base element of d j by proposition 2 it is a total element of d j and by proposition 3 j i ba log h 2 it is left to notice that j i ba i j log 1 x as x the following question was suggested by the referee in relation to the above proof is it true for general singular inner functions that they are equivalent iff they are constant multiples of each other we would like to leave this question for the reader 6 2 te for functions with comparable derivatives the condition of comparability for the derivatives of the inner functions appearing in section 5 3 is worth exploring a bit further such conditions appear in applications for instance inner functions corresponding to schro dinger equations with regular potentials as well as to other similar classes of canonical systems will satisfy this condition completeness problems for various families of special functions also lead to mifs with comparable derivatives see 21 let us provide the following description of toeplitz equivalence pertaining to this case lemma 4 consider two mifs i and j such that i j on r then i t j iff i j 1 2 arg i arg j has a bounded harmonic conjugate proof if is bounded then i t j see section 6 assume now that i t j but is unbounded this contradicts lemma 3 7 to in terms of model and de branges spaces 7 1 d as inner factors in k and b e in terms of the model space k the set of dominance d has a natural meaning it is the set of all inner components of functions from k in case of mifs k is directly related to the de branges space b e via the isometric isomorphism ek b e hence d is also the set of all inner components of functions f e f b e in the upper half plane the set dt can be similarly identified with the subset of all total inner components of functions from k or b e as was discussed in section 4 2 if is a mif and i db then i b s a for some blaschke sequence n and a 0 in the case of pure blaschke product a 0 20 a poltoratski the sequence satisfies f 0 with muliplicities for some function from k or b e in the case a 0 for any mo bius transform bw of the unit disk bw s a b is a blaschke product from db hence 2 n a ic c 0 is again equal to f 0 for some f k b e we will return to the discussion of zero sets in section 7 7 sets of inner components of functions from k have been studied by other authors see for instance 9 3 as follows from our discussion above i d iff i lurks within k using the terminology of 3 in 11 the authors study the set of multipliers m i j between model spaces ki and kj i e the set of all h functions such that ki kj in relation to to m i j 6 0 implies i t 6 j in these papers the reader may find additional properties of d 7 2 base elements and asymptotics along the imaginary axis lemma 5 let be a mif f k f iy 6 o y 3 2 as y then the total inner component of f is a base element of d proof suppose that the total inner component i of f is not a base element then there exists inner j and outer g such that i properly divides j and jg k let h be an outer component of f then the argument of the outer function g h is 1 2 arg j i i e it is a continuous decreasing function on r which decreases by at least by claim 1 below and the asymptotics of f this implies that g iy 6 o y 1 2 as y this contradicts g h 2 the following can be easily established claim 1 let h be an outer function in c whose argument on r satisfies lim inf x x lim sup x x then y o h iy as y our next statement combined with lemma 5 shows that functions whose total inner components are base elements of d are dense in k proposition 4 for every inner the space k contains a dense subset of functions f satisfying f iy 1 y as y proof let c z be the cayley transform from the unit disc to the upper half plane then z c z is an inner function in the unit disc recall that k is obtained from k via the map f z 7 c 1 w 1 f c 1 w now the statement is equivalent to the statement that functions with finite non zero limits limr 1 f r are dense in k toeplitz order 21 let n be a sequence of divisors of such that n point wise in d and each n can be analytically continued through 1 then k n is dense in k but in each k n all functions can be continued through 1 and a dense subset have non zero values there 7 3 d in terms of de branges spaces let e be a de branges function and let e be a corresponding mif if f b e then f i 1 fe in c where i 1 is inner and f h 2 is outer similarly in c f i 2 f e an important property of b e is that the inner components can be moved from one half plane to the other i e if i 3 i 4 i 1 then the function g defined as i 3 fe in c and as i 4 i 2 f e in c also belongs to b e similarly one can move inner factors from c to c the set of all inner functions i 1 i 2 appearing this way for a fixed b e is exactly the dominance set d if f is an entire function defined as above in c we will call the inner function i 1 i 2 the total inner component of f if i is a total inner component for a function from a de branges space then the argument of fe on r is determined by the argument of i up to n the argument of mif i is a real analytic function on r while the argument of fe is piece wise real analytic making a jump of at each real zero of fe all in all we have arg fe 1 2 arg i mod 7 1 note that total inner components of functions from b e are exactly the elements of dt e denote by d t e the set of exact total elements the total elements cor responding to functions from b e which have no zeros on the real line if f b e is such a function and i d t is its inner component in c then the last equation holds exactly i e arg fe 1 2 arg i on r for a proper choice of arguments on both sides 7 4 db spaces for inner toeplitz kernels the following discussion will be used in section 7 7 let i and j be two mifs such that n i j 6 0 notice that i jf ei e i e j ej f g which shows that an h 2 function f belongs to n i j iff ei ej f can be con tinued to the lower half plane as an entire function the formula for the continuation is e i e j g consider the space of entire functions b ei ej n i j equipped with the norm fei ej f h 2 22 a poltoratski by verifying the axioms one can conclude that b b e is a de branges space for some hb function e we will denote this hb function by ei j to summarize to each pair of mifs i j such that n i j 6 0 there corre sponds an hb function ei j our construction implies the following impor tant property proposition 5 the set jd ei j is the set of all functions from d i divisible by j 7 5 te and equality of de branges spaces while model spaces k are equal as sets if and only if the corresponding inner functions are equal up to a constant multiple de branges spaces b e and b e can be equal as sets for two different functions e and e equality of two de branges spaces as sets of functions with possibly dif ferent norms is an important aspect of spectral theory for differential equa tions the so called gelfand levitan theory which treats spectral problems for regular schro dinger equations and dirac systems utilizes the fact that the corresponding de branges spaces are equal to paley wiener spaces as sets this property becomes the key ingredient of the theory allowing one to use the structure of paley wiener spaces to study relations between the potential of the differential operator and the fourier transform of its spec tral measure an extension of gelfand levitan techniques to more general classes of krein s canonical systems see for instance 24 requires further understanding of properties of hb functions e and e which produce equal as sets spaces b e and b e such questions are also equivalent to prob lems on sampling measures see section 8 4 although total description of such pairs of hb functions presents an impor tant open problem intuitively such functions must be similar to each other which raises a natural question on the correspondence of this relation and toeplitz equivalence for the mifs and our next theorem connects this problem to to we will use the notation b e b e for the two de branges spaces equal as sets note that if b e b e then norms in the spaces are automatically equivalent theorem 3 let e and e be hb functions such that e e n c then t for the corresponding mifs iff b e b e conversely if t for two mifs and then the corresponding hb func tions can be chosen to satisfy e e n c and b e b e proof suppose first that b e b e since d and d are the sets of inner components of f e for the elements f of the corresponding space in c d d and t toeplitz order 23 conversely let d d then the subsets of base elements db co incide as well if i db db then i is a total inner component for some f b e and for some g b e note that then f g is a zero free entire function indeed since the total zero components of f and g coincide f g may only have zeros on the real line then f has zeros on the real line say at a r but then z i f z a is an element of b e with total inner component bii which contradicts the property that i is a base el ement hence f g is zero free it must be outer in both half planes because otherwise i is not a base element in one of the d sets hence f g const we obtain that the sets of functions in b e and b e whose total inner components are base elements coincide let now f b e b e by proposition 4 there exists h b e such that h e iy 6 o y 3 2 as y by lemma 5 the total inner component of h is a base element and therefore h b e by the argument above notice that f e iy o y 3 2 because otherwise its total inner compo nent would have been a base element which would imply f b e hence f h e 6 o y 3 2 which implies that f h has a base total inner component and therefore belongs to both de branges spaces since h also belongs to both spaces so does f and we arrive at a contradiction in the process of the last proof we have established the following useful property proposition 6 if the total inner component i of a function f from b e is a base element of d e then f has no real zeros equivalently db d t for any mif 7 6 te and model spaces in this section we formulate our result for general inner functions in order to do that we will need to extend the notations i j and h i j introduced in section 4 1 from the case of mifs to the general case to make sense of the definition i j 1 2 arg i arg j in the general case we understand arg i j as a measurable function on r such that i ei arg i is positive a e on r it is not difficult to show that if i t j then their arguments can be chosen in such a way that exists and h i j e i is an outer function in what follows we will assume that and h correspond to the arguments of i and j chosen in such a way our statement in this section is theorem 4 i t j iff multiplication by h i j is a bounded and invertible operator ki kj for general i and j this means that if i t j then their arguments can be chosen so that the outer function h i j exists and multiplication by h i j 24 a poltoratski is a bounded and invertible operator ki kj conversely if the arguments can be chosen in such way then i t j proof suppose first that i and j are mifs then h ei ej and the equivalence of i t j and b ei b ej gives the statement in the general case if multiplication by h i j is a bounded and invertible operator ki kj then the sets of all inner components of functions from ki and kj coincide because h is outer hence d i d j and i t j in the opposite direction if i t j one can reduce the proof to the case of mifs via a limiting argument we leave the details to the reader 7 7 complete and minimal sequences of reproducing kernels and zero sets in de branges spaces we call a sequence c a zero set of a de branges space b e iff there exists f b e f 6 0 such that f 0 on with multiplicities we call an exact zero set if there exists f b e such that f 0 with multiplicities a maximal zero set is a sequence of points such that there exists a non zero function from the space vanishing on but there is no such function for any set properly containing a maximal zero set is exact but not vice versa blaschke products cor responding to maximal zero sets are base elements from d and those corresponding to exact zero sets are total elements see lemma 6 below maximal zero sets are also related to complete and minimal sequences we say that is a complete and minimal sequence for b e iff the system of reproducing kernels k is complete and minimal i e any proper subsequence is incomplete in b e note that a sequence is complete and minimal iff the same sequence minus any one of its points is a maximal zero set for sequences c similar definitions can be given for the model spaces k we will now establish relations between zero sets and the subsets of the dominance set recall that as was defined in section 2 2 the spectrum speci of a mif i is the sequence of points from r where the function is equal to 1 if c r is a sequence of complex points we denote by b the blaschke product with zeros at the points of in c and at the points conjugate to the points of in c assuming the blaschke condition holds lemma 6 let e be an hb function e let c r and r be sequences of points 1 is a zero set of b e iff there exists an inner i such that speci and b i d toeplitz order 25 2 is an exact zero set of b e iff there exists an inner i such that speci and b i d t 3 is a maximal zero set of b e iff there exists an inner i such that speci and b i db proof 1 suppose that f 0 on for some f b e then there exists a finite positive measure concentrated on an n such that an 0 are small enough to satisfy f e k h 2 then for i i the inner function whose clark measure is we have f e 1 i h 2 and g f 1 i b e for the function g e k e we have e g e e f e 1 1 i h i 1 i a e on r for some h h 2 h ef g here we use the fact that f e k e and the observation that i 1 i 1 i 0 a e on r since f vanishes on the inner component of g e is divisible by b according to the last equation the inner component of eg e is divisible by i hence the total inner component of g e is divisible by b i conversely let b i d for some inner i such that speci then b e contains a function equal to b ife in c where f is outer from h 2 then b e also contains a function equal to b fe in c subtracting we obtain a function in b e equal to b 1 i fe in c which vanishes on 2 and 3 can be proved similarly theorem 5 every element of d is a divisor of a base element before we prove the last statement let us note that each de branges space possesses a large collection of maximal zero sets complete and minimal sequences minus one point for instance if one takes an orthogonal basis of reproducing kernels described in section 2 4 and deletes one point from the corresponding sequence the remaining sequence is a maximal zero set by perturbing this real sequence one can obtain a maximal zero set in c note that maximal zero sets in c as any zero sets of a de branges space b e in c satisfy the blaschke condition the corresponding blaschke products b are exactly the base elements of d e which have no singular divisor proof of theorem 5 first let us assume that is a mif and let j d let c be a maximal zero set of b e j as defined in section 7 4 then jb is a base element of d indeed if bajb d for some blaschke factor ba a c then by proposition 5 a is a zero set of 26 a poltoratski b ei j which contradicts maximality of hence j divides a base element of d i finally in the case of non mif notice that is a normal limit of mifs and apply a limiting argument considering the case when j is a blaschke product in the statement of theorem 5 and using lemma 6 we obtain the following result by yu belov in fact our last proof is a variation of the proof in 4 corollary 3 4 any incomplete sequence of reproducing kernels in a de branges space is contained in a complete and minimal sequence of reproduc ing kernels note that any incomplete sequence of reproducing kernels is automatically minimal which is used implicitly in the above statement denote by z b e the collection of all zero sets for the space b e and let ze stand for the exact zero sets then theorem 5 becomes the following statement theorem 6 the collection of zero sets z b e determines the space b e uniquely within the regularity class of e i e if z b e z b e and e e n c then b e b e proof the collection of sets r z b e determines the set of blaschke products from d e for the non blaschke elements we have the simple observation that whenever bsa d the blaschke prod uct bbw s a belongs to d as well for all w d which implies that the sets r ze b e determine d uniquely it follows that ze b e determines d and the statement follows from theorem 5 note that since z b e determines b e it also determines ze b e conversely since zero sets are subsets of exact zero sets ze b e deter mines z b e even easier one can establish the same connection between z and zm the collection of maximal zero sets as each maximal zero set is a maximal element of z with respect to inclusion hence either of the sets ze or zm can be substituted into the last statement instead of z however the statement with z b e is the strongest of the three 7 8 to and inclusion of de branges spaces the last statement raises a natural question if te is equivalent to equality of the corresponding de branges spaces are the relations t 6 and t equivalent to inclusions of the spaces if the answer were positive we would obtain an equivalent definition of to the relation does hold in one direction toeplitz order 27 proposition 7 if b e b e then t 6 the statement follows from the fact that the corresponding dominance set consists of all inner components of f e f b e f e f b e in c however as shown by the example below the opposite direction fails example 5 consider a sequence n 2 n sign n 1 2 n i n z where n 0 and the corresponding blaschke product b denote i b s where once again s z eiz and consider the corresponding cartwright hb function ei let s z sin z z be the sinc function then if n decays to 0 fast enough s ei 6 l 2 hence s 6 b ei and b es 6 b ei because s b es pw 1 at the same time since s is a divisor of i s t i 7 9 chains of de branges spaces and chains in to recall that for a partial order a chain is a subset where every pair of elements is comparable on the other hand every de branges space or every poisson finite measure on the real line gives rise to a chain of de branges spaces of entire functions see section 2 4 although the term chain is given different meanings in these two situations we note the following simple connections between de branges chains and chains in toeplitz order it follows from proposition 7 that de branges chains produce chains in toeplitz order if b et is a de branges chain then et is a chain in to clearly such chains do not present all possible chains in to since for instance not all such chains consist of mifs even if we restrict our at tention to all to chains in the subset of mifs de branges chains do not produce all such chains as follows from example 5 finding a way to deter mine if a chain in to is a de branges chain seems like another interesting problem 8 to in problems of harmonic analysis in the rest of the paper we look at connections of toeplitz order with some of the classical problems of harmonic analysis our goal here is to provide only a brief overview of such connections without going into deeper technical details we start with two completeness problems for families of complex exponen tials the beurling malliavin bm problem and its extensions studied in 21 22 and the type problem recently considered in 32 we then dis cuss sampling problems in paley wiener and de branges spaces with some remarks on the two weight hilbert problem see 28 and 27 19 20 for further references 28 a poltoratski 8 1 bm problem let n be a sequence of distinct points in the complex plane and let e e i nx be a sequence of complex exponential functions on r with frequencies from for any complex sequence its radius of completeness is defined as r sup a e is complete in l 2 0 a the famous bm problem which was solved in 5 6 asks to find a formula for r for an arbitrary c it is well known in the theory of completeness that the general problem can be easily reduced to the case of real sequences more precisely if is a general complex sequence then e is complete in l 2 0 a if and only if e is complete in the same space where is the real sequence defined as n 1 1 n wlog has no purely imaginary points see for instance 15 also as will be explained below one can always assume that is a discrete sequence i e has no finite accumulation points a system of complex exponentials e is incomplete in l 2 0 a if and only if there exists a non zero f l 2 0 a such that f ei nx for all n taking the fourier transform of f we arrive at the equivalent reformulation that e is incomplete in l 2 0 2 a if and only if is a zero for pwa one immediate consequence of this connection is that if has a finite ac cumulation point then r aso since any zero set c of a pw space must satisfy the blaschke condition r for any non blaschke c to give the formula for r we will need the following definitions if in is a sequence of disjoint intervals on r we call it short if in 2 1 dist 2 0 in and long otherwise if is a sequence of real points define its exterior bm density effective bm density as d sup d long in such that in d in n for a complex sequence define d d theorem 7 beurling and malliavin around 1961 5 6 let be a dis crete sequence then r d toeplitz order 29 in regard to toeplitz order bm theorem is equivalent to the following state ments recall that any mif i has the form i b s a where b is a blaschke product and sa eiaz is the exponential function put r i d a the most direct equivalent of theorem 7 is in terms of the dominance set theorem 8 i d sb if r b and i 6 d sb if r b the statement can be equivalently reformulated in terms of to theorem 9 for any mif i i t 6 sb r i b and r i b i t sb note that equivalence of the last two statement no longer holds if s is replaced with a general inner function finding a broader set of functions for which the equivalence does hold is an open problem proof of theorem 9 the general case can be trivially reduced to the case i b suppose first that r d b let a be a zero of i then d a b and i ba 6 d s b by bm theorem theorem 8 since i ba d i the relation i t 6 sb does not hold to establish the second statement suppose that r d b if j d i then there exists f n i j f 6 0 also since d b by theorem 8 there exists g n s bi g 6 0 note that ig sb 2 pwb 2 which implies g h then s bjgf s big i jf h 2 which means that j d sb hence d i d sb and i t sb as we can see the beurling malliavin formula gives a metric condition for the relation of to in the very specific case when one of the functions to be compared is the exponential function similar descriptions for more gen eral classes of inner functions especially those appearing in applications to completeness problems and spectral analysis remain mostly open below we present one of such extensions found in 22 8 2 further generalizations reformulations of the bm theorem given in the last section present a clear direction for generalizations of the bm theory while a statement analogous to theorems 8 and 9 with a general inner function in place of sa may be out of reach at the moment one can attempt to replace the exponential function with an inner function from a larger class to determine the right classes of inner functions to study in these settings one may look at a variety of applications of the toeplitz approach in harmonic analysis and spectral theory 30 a poltoratski one of such extensions was recently studied in 21 22 as was shown in 21 the class of mifs with polynomially growing arguments appears naturally in a number of applications including completeness problems for airy and bessel functions spectral problems for regular schro dinger operators and dirac systems etc an analog of theorem 8 proved in 22 can be applied to some of such problems here we present an equivalent reformulation similar to theorem 9 let r r be a continuous function such that i e lim x x lim x x define to be the smallest non increasing majorant of x max t x t the family of intervals bm in is defined as the collection of the connected components of the open set x r x 6 x let 0 be a constant we say that is almost decreasing if in bm dist in 0 1 2 in 2 8 1 as before an argument of a mif i on r is a real analytic function such that i ei theorem 10 let u be a mif with u x 0 argu on r let j be another mif arg j on r then i if 1 is almost decreasing then j d u ii if 1 is not almost decreasing then j 6 d u let us point out that even finding an analog for the above statement for 0 presents an open problem such mifs appear in some of the applications mentioned in 22 to finish this section let us reformulate the last theorem using the relations of to theorem 11 in the conditions of theorem 10 i if 1 is almost decreasing then j t u ii if j t 6 u then 1 is almost decreasing toeplitz order 31 proof once again the general case can be reduced to the case j b oth erwise replace the singular factor of j with its frostman transform bw s a i if 1 is almost decreasing then by theorem 10 there exists a non trivial function f n u jb where b is any finite blaschke product denote the zeros of b by a 1 an note that then h f z a 1 z a 2 z an n u j if n n is large enough h is bounded because f c u 1 2 suppose now that i d j i e there exists non trivial g n j i then u ihg u jh j ig h 2 which implies that i d u hence d j d u and j t u ii if 1 is not almost decreasing then 1 is not almost decreasing where arg j ba for some zero a of j by theorem 10 it means that j ba 6 d u while j ba d j hence the relation j t 6 u does not hold 8 3 the type problem like the beurling malliavin problem the type problem concerns completeness of complex exponentials in l 2 spaces this time one considers l 2 for a general finite positive measure on r and studies completeness of families of exponential functions with frequencies from a fixed interval we define the type of as t inf a e ist s a a are complete in l 2 the problem is to find t in terms of this problem was considered by n wiener in an equivalent form 35 a kolmogorov and m krein see 17 18 or 33 for further discussion and references using the toeplitz approach a formula for t was recently found in 32 see also 33 the idea of the toeplitz approach to the type problem can be expressed in terms of toeplitz order in the following form recall that for a positive singular poisson finite measure we denote by the inner function with clark measure the general case of the type problem can be easily reduced to the singular case theorem 12 let be a positive singular poisson finite measure then t sup a s a d we say that an inner function divides a cauchy integral k for some finite complex measure if k hp for some p 0 note that then k k where is another finite complex measure 29 32 a poltoratski proof of theorem 12 recall that according to the clark formula every func tion from k can be represented in the form f 1 kf since 1 is an outer function in c sup a sa d sup a s a divides f k sup a sa divides kf f l 2 by a theorem of aleksandrov 1 sa divides kf iff f eist s a a such an f exists iff the family of exponentials eist s a a is incomplete in l 2 utilizing the beurling malliavin multiplier theorem one can deduce the following statement theorem 13 let be a positive singular poisson finite measure then t sup a s a t 6 8 4 sampling measures let be two positive poisson finite measures such that the hilbert cauchy transform is bounded from l 2 to l 2 initially one can understand this property in the sense that for a dense family of functions f l 2 the cauchy integral kf in the upper half plane has non tangential boundary values f x at a e point x and the norm estimate f l 2 c f l 2 holds for all f from that family with a uniform c it follows from a theorem by aleksandrov 1 that then f actually exists a e for all f l 2 and the same norm estimate holds the general two weight hilbert problem asks to describe pairs of measures with this property extensive studies of the tauberian version of the two weight hilbert prob lem were started in 27 and recently completed in 19 20 these important results produced a real analytic description of pairs and our goal in this section is to connect this problem with to once again if is a positive singular poisson finite measure on r we de note by the corresponding inner function i e the function whose clark measure is by a theorem from 29 every function f from the model space k has non tangential boundary values a e with respect to the operator of embedding k l 2 is a unitary operator as was men tioned before this statement generalizes the parseval theorem from ks and the counting measure of z which is the clark measure for s to an ar bitrary model space and the corresponding clark measure the function f k can be recovered from its boundary values in l 2 via the formula f 1 kf some of these connections have already been used in our discussion of to to summarize these relations let us recall that the dominance set of toeplitz order 33 is the set of all inner divisors of functions from k as was discussed in the last section d i i is an inner divisor of kf f l 2 let us now return to a pair of poisson finite measures and such that the cauchy transform is bounded from l 2 to l 2 in view of the above this is equivalent to saying that k is embedded via passing from a function to its non tangential boundary values into l 2 k 2 or 1 2 note that under the condition of boundedness of the cauchy transform the integral k or equivalently the inner function have non tangential boundary values a e and the above definition of makes sense in the case when the measures and are discrete the condition of bound edness of the cauchy transform can be reformulated in terms of de branges spaces recall that we denote by e an hermite biehler function such that e k b e the boundedness of the cauchy transform is equivalent to the boundedness of the natural embedding of b e into l 2 e k 2 note that if e a ib is the standard representation of e a b are real entire functions 2 a e e 2 ib e e then e k a 2 b 2 b we say that a positive measure on r is sampling for a banach space h of analytic functions in c if the non tangential limits f x exist a e for a dense family of f h and f h f l 2 an important case of the two weight hilbert problem is when f l 2 kf l 2 in view of our discussion above this is equivalent to the property that k 2 is a sampling measure for k the general property when the cauchy transform is only norm bounded from above can be reduced to the sampling case by adding the clark measure 1 to namely if 1 is the clark measure for let us denote by 1 1 the clark dual measure see section 2 2 the cauchy transform is bounded from l 2 to l 2 iff 1 is a sampling measure for k reformulating clark theory for mifs in terms the corresponding de branges spaces we may notice that for any poisson finite positive discrete measure on r there exists a unique regular de branges space b e such that b e l 2 and supp e e we will denote the corresponding hb function by e and the mif e e by i the measure is called a de branges measure for b e note the following clear connection with the clark measure for i e 2 34 a poltoratski other clark measures t produce other de branges measures to form the family of de branges measures for the given space as we saw above the two weight hilbert problem is directly related to the problem of description of sampling measures for model spaces k if is a mif and is a discrete poisson finite measure on r then is sampling for k if and only if e is sampling for b e where e is any hb function such that e e thus in the case of discrete measures the two weight problem connects to the description of sampling measures for de branges spaces finally for the last problem we have the following reformulation in terms of to any measure satisfying f b e f l 2 is called a spectral measure for b e any de branges space b e pos sesses an infinite family of spectral measures with the de branges measure defined above being one of them the spectral measures for a given de branges space are de branges measures for the space de branges measures for larger de branges spaces in the chain which contains the given space and limits of such measures along the chain the set of spectral measures of a given de branges space is quite well understood in krein de branges theory those measures are spectral measures for the corresponding krein canonical systems of differential equations see 7 10 25 the following statement follows from theorem 3 theorem 14 let be two positive discrete poisson finite measures on r tfae 1 the hilbert cauchy transform is bounded from l 2 to l 2 2 the measure 1 e 2 is a spectral measure for some b f such that f t note that the condition f t means that the inner factors of functions from b f in c are the same as inner factors of cauchy integrals kf f l 2 in 28 a theorem by de branges from 7 was applied to describe sampling sequences for the paley wiener space recall that the paley wiener space is a de branges space with e s 1 using the same ideas we can formulate the following statement in terms of to theorem 15 is a sampling measure for b e iff p f f f f for some hb function f such that f t e and some h 1 toeplitz order 35 9 concluding remarks and further questions for decades numerous problems in complex function theory were motivated by functional and spectral analysis this tradition can be traced to beurl ing s description of invariant subspaces of the shift operator using inner func tions proofs of uniqueness theorems for schro dinger operators by borg and marchenko etc one of the main sources for such problems is the nagy foias functional model theory mentioned in this text see 26 problems appearing in this context are related to inner functions and model spaces k the krein de branges theory 7 10 created to treat spectral problems for differential operators is another source of such problems where the main objects are entire functions and meromorphic inner functions recent developments in the toeplitz approach to up have raised a large number of new questions one of the main goals of this paper was to outline some of such questions and bring them to the attention of the experts in complex function theory in conclusion let us give a brief summary of prob lems appearing in relation to to this is only a small sample of questions from the area of the toeplitz approach and interested reader will be able to find many more challenging problems in other sources including those cited in this note giving metric conditions for to and te seems to be a natural question in particular producing conditions for two blaschke products b 1 and b 2 to satisfy b 1 t b 2 or b 1 t 6 b 2 in terms of their zeros or arguments presents the main version of this problem while giving if and only if conditions for general inner functions may be out of reach at the moment solving this problem for the inner functions from a restricted class like in theorem 10 or fixing one of the functions like in theorems 8 and 9 would still be interesting and challenging let us point out that one of the important cases in theorem 10 when 0 which appears in applications see 22 is still open such results would provide generalizations of bm theory and numerous other applications as we saw in the text study of the structure of the dominance set d and in particular providing metric conditions in terms of for a given function i to be a base or total element in d generalizes problems on complete ness minimality and zero sets in model and de branges spaces while such problems are well understood in the standard paley wiener spaces where they become equivalent to bm problem and related problems on exponen tial families as well as spectral problems for regular schro dinger and dirac operators see 21 they are mostly open for 6 s among questions more specific to toeplitz order let us mention the natural question of finding supremum or infimum with respect to the relations t 6 and t for a given collection of inner functions starting with finite col lections and functions from restricted classes this problem can reach any 36 a poltoratski desired level of difficulty even its first step determining the existence of an upper lower bound which is simple for finite collections can be interesting for the infinite ones another problem mentioned in the text is the problem of finding the toeplitz hull for a given collection of functions i e the smallest dominance set d containing the collection some of the cases of this problem are equivalent to finding the smallest de branges or model space for a given collection of zero sets a version of the same question corresponds to finding the differential operator for which the given sequences are are not defining in the terminology of 22 apart from pure function theoretic problems finding further connections from the objects of this note to problems of up and spectral theory remains one of natural directions for research references
