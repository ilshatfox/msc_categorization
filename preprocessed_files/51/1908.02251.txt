grid dissections of tangential quadrilaterals erica choi dan ismailescu jiho lee and joonsoo lee abstract for any integer n 2 a square can be partitioned into n 2 smaller squares via a checkerboard type dissection does there such a class preserving grid dissection exist for some other types of quadrilaterals for instance is it true that a tangential quadrilateral can be partitioned into n 2 smaller tangential quadrilaterals using an n n grid dissection we prove that the answer is affirmative for every integer n 2 1 the problem for any integer n 2 a square can be naturally partitioned into n 2 smaller squares via a checkerboard type dissection are there any other properties p such that any convex quadrilateral q having property p can be dissected in a grid like manner into smaller quadrilaterals all of which have property p as well the answer is obvious if property p says q is a parallelogram or q is a trapezoid or q is a convex quadrilateral what if property p states q is a cyclic quadrilateral or q is a tangential quadrilateral or q is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral for instance figure 1 displays the case of a tangential quadrilateral partitioned into nine smaller tangential quadrilaterals is such a dissection always possible and if it is how do we find it figure 1 a 3 3 grid dissection of a tangential quadrilateral into smaller tangential quadrilaterals 1 ar x

sets of segments s s 1 s 2 sm 1 and t t 1 t 2 tn 1 with the following properties a if s s then the endpoints of s belong to the sides ab and cd similarly if t t then the endpoints of t belong to the sides ad and bc b every two segments in s are pairwise disjoint and the same is true for the segments in t we then say that segments s 1 s 2 sm 1 t 1 t 2 tn 1 define an m n grid dissection of abcd see figure 2 note that either s or t could be empty figure 2 a 3 2 and a 4 4 grid dissection of the convex quadrilateral abcd the following problem raised in 1 is the main motivation of our paper problem 2 2 is it true that every cyclic orthodiagonal or tangential quadri lateral can be partitioned into cyclic orthodiagonal or tangential quadrilaterals respectively via an m n grid dissection the authors call such dissections class preserving grid dissections in 1 it is proved that if either m or n is even then an m n grid dissection of a cyclic quadrilateral q into mn cyclic quadrilaterals exists only if q is either an isosceles trapezoid or a rectangle the situation is a little bit better if both m and n are odd theorem 2 3 1 a every cyclic quadrilateral all of whose angles are greater than arccos 5 1 2 51 83 admits a 3 1 grid dissection into three cyclic quadrilaterals b let q be a cyclic quadrilateral such that the measure of each of the arcs determined by the vertices of q on the circumcircle is greater than 60 then abcd admits a 3 3 grid dissection into nine cyclic quadrilaterals it is conjectured however that when m and n both odd become large a cyclic quadrilateral admits an m n grid dissection into cyclic quadrilaterals only if it is close to being a rectangle things get even worse for class preserving grid dissections of orthodiagonal quadrilaterals it is conjectured that with the possible exception of some special cases such dissections do not exist 2 after these mostly negative results it comes as a surprise that there is some hope when dealing with tangential quadrilaterals ismailescu and vojdany 1 proved that every tangential quadrilateral has a 2 2 class preserving grid dissection and asked whether this result can be extended for n n grid dissections surprisingly enough the answer is affirmative and this constitutes the main result of our paper the following elementary result provides a characterization of tangential quadrilaterals and will be used in the sequel the direct statement is due to pitot and the converse to steiner theorem 2 4 see e g 3 a quadrilateral is tangential if and only if the sum of two opposite sides equals the sum of the other two opposite sides 3 the main result theorem 3 1 for any integer n 2 and for any tangential quadrilateral q there exists an n n grid dissection of q into n 2 smaller tangential quadrilaterals the idea of the proof is natural given a checkerboard dissected axes parallel square abcd in the xy plane and a target tangential quadrilateral a b c d in the uv plane see figure 3 below we are trying to find a geometric transfor mation t with the following properties figure 3 the main idea behind transformation t t maps arbitrarily small axes parallel squares from the xy plane into tangential quadrilaterals in the uv plane t maps the horizontal grid lines from the xy plane into the grid lines passing through the point o 0 0 in the uv plane t maps the vertical grid lines from the xy plane into the grid lines passing through p 1 0 in the uv plane of course at this point we do not know whether such a transformation exists and even if it does whether it achieves the overall goal of generating the desired n n grid dissection of a b c d into smaller tangential quadrilaterals 3 4 the local condition lemma 4 1 suppose that there exists a transformation t r 2 r 2 from the xy plane to the uv plane defined as t u f x y v g x y such that t maps every square from the xy plane into a tangential quadrilateral in the uv plane then 1 f 2 x a b g 2 x a b f 2 y a b g 2 y a b for every a b r 2 figure 4 the local condition proof let abcd be an axis parallel square of side in the xy plane and let a t a b t b c t c and d t d as shown in figure 4 it follows that ua f a b va g a b ub f a b vb g a b etc consider first the ratio a b 2 2 f a b f a b 2 g a b g a b 2 from which lim 0 a b f 2 x a b g 2 x a b 2 similarly c d 2 2 f a b f a b 2 g a b g a b 2 lim 0 c d f 2 x a b g 2 x a b 3 analogously we obatain the following equalities b c 2 2 f a b f a b 2 g a b g a b 2 d a 2 2 f a b f a b 2 g a b g a b 2 which give lim 0 b c lim 0 d a f 2 y a b g 2 y a b 4 since we want a b c d to be tangential by using the pitot steiner condition it is necessary and sufficient to have that a b c d b c d a divide both sides by and pass to the limit as 0 then use relations 2 3 and 4 to obtain the desired equality 4 5 the trapezoid case theorem 5 1 there exists a transformation t r 2 r 2 with the following properties a t maps vertical lines from the xy plane into vertical lines in the uv plane b t maps horizontal lines from the xy plane into lines through the origin in the uv plane c t maps any axes parallel square from the xy plane into a tangential trapezoid in the uv plane d for any given tangential trapezoid k in the uv plane an appropriately scaled and or rotated copy of k can be obtained as the image under transformation t of a conveniently chosen square in the xy plane proof let t u f x y v g x y any vertical line x c in the xy plane is mapped into a vertical line u c in the uv plane this means f c y c where c depends on c only it follows that f x y depends on x only that is 5 f x y f x on the other hand any horizontal y c is mapped into a line through the origin v mcu which can be rewritten as g x c mc f x c from which g x c f x c mc wheremc depends only on c this means that g x y f x y g y which after using 5 becomes 6 g x y f x g y taking partial derivatives we obtain fx x y f x gx x y f x g y fy x y 0 gy x y f x g y using equation 1 we have that f 2 x g 2 x f 2 y g 2 y f x 2 f x 2 g 2 y f 2 x g y 2 from which f x f x 2 g y 2 1 g 2 y since the left hand side of the above equation depends on x only while the right hand side depends on y only it follow that we have system of differential equations f x f x k g y 1 g 2 y k one set of solutions of this system is given by f x ax g y ay a y 2 using now relations 5 and 6 we have obtained 7 t f x y ax g x y ax ay a y 2 we still have to verify property c consider the axes parallel square abcd in the xy plane with a x y b x l y c x l y l d x y l where l 0 denote a t a b t b c t c d t d it is easy to verify that a b c d is a positively oriented trapezoid it remains to check that a b c d is tangential denote x ax y ay l al obviously x 0 y 0 l 1 to this end we compute the side lengths of a b c d 5 a b x 1 y 2 l 1 2 y c d x 1 y 2 l 2 l 1 2 y l b c x 1 y 2 l l 1 2 y d a x 1 y 2 l l 1 2 y l it is easy to verify that a b c d b c d a thus a b c d is tangential finally we show that given any tangential trapezoid k an appropriate scaled and or rotated copy of k can be obtained as the image under transformation t of a conveniently chosen square in the xy plane without loss of generality assume that the parallel sides of k are vertical and that the non parallel sides intersect at the origin see figure 5 figure 5 the square abcd being mapped into the tangential trape zoid a b c d vertical lines are mapped into vertical lines horizontal lines are mapped into lines through the origin let the slope of a b be m and let the slope of c d be p with p m we have that the slope of a b y 2 1 y and the slope of c d y 2 l 2 1 2 y l choosing x 1 y m 1 m 2 and l 1 p 2 p 1 m 2 m achieves the desired goal 6 the general case a result similar to theorem 5 1 holds when the tangential quadrilateral to be dissected is not a trapezoid we present the details below theorem 6 1 there exists a transformation t r 2 r 2 with the following properties a t maps vertical lines from the xy plane into lines through the point p 1 0 in the uv plane b t maps horizontal lines from the xy plane into lines through the origin o 0 0 in the uv plane c t maps any axes parallel square lying in the halfplane x y 0 of the xy plane into a tangential quadrilateral in the uv plane 6 proof let t u f x y v g x y any vertical line x c in the xy plane is mapped into a line v mc u 1 in the uv plane this means g c y mc f c y 1 from which g c y f c y 1 mc it follows that g x y f x y 1 depends on x only that is 8 g x y f x f x y 1 on the other hand any horizontal y c is mapped into a line through the origin v mcu this can be rewritten as g x c mc f x c from which g x c f x c mc where mc depends only on c this means that 9 g x y f x y g y from which g x y g y f x y solving 8 and 9 we obtain 10 f x y f x f x g y g x y f x g y f x g y taking partial derivatives in 10 we obtain fx x y f x g y f x g y 2 gx x y g y fx x y fy x y f x g y f x g y 2 gy x y f x fy x y using the local condition 1 we have that f 2 x g 2 x f 2 y g 2 y fx x y 2 1 g 2 y fy x y 2 1 f 2 x f x 2 g y 2 1 g 2 y f x 2 g y 2 1 f 2 x f x f x 1 f 2 x 2 g y g y 1 g 2 y 2 since the left hand side of the above equation depends on x only while the right hand side depends on y only it follows that we have the following system of differential equations f x f x 1 f 2 x k g y g y 1 g 2 y k one set of solutions of this system is given by f x 2 ax a 2 x 1 g y 2 ay a 2 y 1 where a 1 substituting these into 10 we obtain the desired transformation 11 t f x y ax a 2 y 1 ax ay ax y 1 g x y 2 ax y ax ay ax y 1 we still have to verify property c notice that transformation t is not defined for points along the line x y 0 it is only the squares which are entirely contained in one of the two open half planes determined by x y 0 which have the desired property consider the square abcd in the xy plane with a x y b x l y c x l y l d x y l where l 0 further assume that x y 0 so that the entire square abcd is above the line x y 0 7 let a t a b t b c t c d t d and denote x ax y ay l al obviously since a 1 and x y 0 it immediately follows that x 0 y 0 xy 1 l 1 thus the coordinates of these four points can be written as a x y 2 1 x y xy 1 2 xy x y xy 1 b lx y 2 1 lx y lxy 1 2 lxy lx y lxy 1 c lx l 2 y 2 1 lx ly l 2 xy 1 2 l 2 xy lx ly l 2 xy 1 d x l 2 y 2 1 x ly lxy 1 2 lxy x ly lxy 1 it is easy to verify that a b c d is a positively oriented quadrilateral it remains to check that a b c d is tangential calculate the side lengths of a b c d a b xy l 1 y 2 1 x 2 l 1 x y xy 1 xl y xy l 1 b c xy l 1 y 2 l 1 x 2 l 2 1 x y xl y xy l 1 xy l 2 1 c d xy l 1 y 2 l 2 1 x 2 l 1 x y x y l xy l 1 xy l 2 1 d a xy 1 x 2 l 1 y 2 l 1 x y xy 1 x y l xy l 1 it is easy to verify that a b c d b c d a thus by the pitot steiner theorem it follows that a b c d is tangential this proves the theorem as in the trapezoid case we can show that given any tangential quadrilateral a b c d an appropriate scaled and or rotated copy of a b c d in the uv plane can be obtained as the image under transformation t of a conveniently chosen square in the xy plane however in this case the computations are more complicated we present the details in the following theorem theorem 6 2 let a b c d be a tangential quadrilateral in the uv plane with out loss of generality assume that after an eventual scaling and or rotation we have that a b c d o 0 0 and b c d a p 1 0 as shown in figure 6 below then for any a 1 there exists constants x y and l with x y 0 l 0 such that the image of the axes parallel square of side l with the bottom left corner located at a x y under the transformation t defined by 11 is the quadrilateral a b c d proof denote by t 1 tan a 2 t 2 tan b 2 t 3 tan c 2 and t 4 tan d 2 obviously ti 0 for every 1 i 4 since the angles of a quadrilateral sum up to 2 it follows easily that the quantities ti satisfy the following identity 12 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 1 t 3 t 4 t 2 t 3 t 4 from our choice of a b c d we have that a b and therefore t 1 t 2 1 similarly since a d it follows that t 1 t 4 1 8 figure 6 proving that the transformation t is surjective every ap propriately scaled rotated tangential quadrilateral is the image of some axes parallel square we also need the following identity 13 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 cos c 2 cos a 2 cos b 2 cos d 2 in particular it follows that t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 0 hence 14 1 t 1 t 2 0 1 t 1 t 4 0 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 0 assume now that abcd is the axes parallel square which is the desired pre image of a b c d assume that this square has side l 0 with a x y b x l y c x l y l d x y l and x y 0 we thus want to find x y and l such that a t a b t b c t c d t d denote ax x ay y and al l since a 1 the inequalities x y 0 and l 0 are equivalent to proving that xy 1 and l 1 straightforward computations lead to the following equalities tan a 2 t 1 x y 1 x y tan b 2 t 2 x l y xy l 1 tan c 2 t 3 xy l 2 1 l x y tan d 2 t 4 x y l xy l 1 15 after taking resultants of the expressions for t 1 t 2 and t 4 in 15 it follows that x y and l satisfy the following quadratic equations x 2 2 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 21 t 2 t 4 1 t 1 t 2 x 1 0 16 y 2 2 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 21 t 2 t 4 1 t 1 t 4 y 1 0 17 l 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 1 2 t 22 t 2 4 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 l 1 0 18 these equations are well defined as we earlier proved that 1 t 1 t 2 0 1 t 1 t 4 0 and t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 0 let x y and l be the larger roots of 16 17 and 18 respectively 9 in particular x 2 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 21 t 2 t 4 1 t 21 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 2 2 t 2 t 4 2 2 1 t 1 t 2 y 2 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 21 t 2 t 4 1 t 21 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 2 2 t 2 t 4 2 2 1 t 1 t 4 l t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 1 2 t 22 t 2 4 1 t 2 t 4 1 t 21 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 2 2 t 2 t 4 2 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 ensuring that these choices for x y and l satisfy the system 15 is just a matter of algebraic calculation for the value of t 3 one can use identity 13 such verifications can be easily performed using any computer algebra software for instance we checked them using maple it remains to prove that for these choices of x y and l we do have that xy 1 and l 1 let us introduce the following notations a 2 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 21 t 2 t 4 1 t 1 t 2 19 b 2 t 1 t 2 t 4 t 21 t 2 t 4 1 t 1 t 4 20 c t 1 t 2 t t 4 1 2 t 22 t 2 4 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 21 the numbers a b and c above are the coefficients of the linear terms in the quadratics 16 17 and 18 hence x y and l are the larger roots of the equations 22 x 2 ax 1 0 y 2 by 1 0 l 2 cl 1 0 that is 23 x a a 2 4 2 y b b 2 4 2 l c c 2 4 2 quick computations show that a b t 1 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 2 t 2 t 4 2 1 t 1 t 2 1 t 1 t 4 c 2 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 2 t 2 t 4 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 4 t 2 t 4 1 combining the above equalities with 14 it follows that a b 0 and c 2 then a b and since the function h x x x 2 4 is strictly increasing on r we have that h a h b from which a a 2 4 b b 2 4 and after multiplying both sides by b b 2 4 a a 2 4 b b 2 4 4 a a 2 4 2 b b 2 4 2 1 xy 1 on the other hand since c 2 it clearly follows that l c c 2 4 2 1 as claimed we thus proved that xy 1 and l 1 as needed this completes the proof of the main result it can be noticed that transformation t given by 11 proves slightly more than that any given tangential quadrilateral has an n n class preserving grid dissection for every n 2 10 corollary 6 3 for any given tangential quadrilateral q and any dissection of an axes parallel square into smaller squares there exists a topologically equivalent dissection of q into smaller tangential quadrilaterals 7 three nice properties of tangential quadrilaterals there are three natural centers associated to every given tangential quadri lateral a b c d first we have i the incenter of a b c d second we have s the point of intersection of the diagonals a c and b d third there is w the 2 2 center of a b c d the common point of the four smaller tangential quadrilaterals which determine the 2 2 grid dissection of a b c d see figure 7 one very interesting fact is that these points are always collinear theorem 7 1 let a b c d be a tangential quadrilateral placed such that a b c d o 0 0 and a d b c p 1 0 as shown in figure 7 a let i s and w be the three centers defined above then these points are collinear and the line determined by them is perpendicular to op b denote the radii of the inscribed circles of the four small tangential quadri laterals a b c d is dissected into by r 1 r 2 r 3 and r 4 respectively then 24 1 r 1 1 r 3 1 r 2 1 r 4 figure 7 the incenter i the 2 2 center w and the point of inter section of the diagonals s are collinear in any tangential quadrilateral proof from theorems 6 1 and 6 2 it follows that there exists an axes parallel square abcd with a x y b x l y c x l y l d x y l a 1 l 0 x y 0 and a transformation t given by 11 such that t abcd a b c d as before denote x ax y ay l al from our choices it follows that x 0 y 0 xy 1 and l 1 11 we just have to compute the coordinates of the points i s and w straight forward calculations show that all these points have the same abscissa ui us uw x l 2 y 2 1 x y xy l 2 1 which proves the first assertion for the second part similar computations give the expressions of ri for 1 i 4 r 1 xy l 1 x y xy l 1 r 2 xy l l 1 xl y xy l 2 1 r 3 xy l l 1 x y l xy l 2 1 r 4 xy l 2 l 1 x y l xy l 3 1 equality 24 follows it is interesting to mention that a similar relation is satisfied by the inradii of triangles a sb b sc c sd and d sa this was proved in 2 to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a quadrilateral to be tangential 25 1 ra sb 1 rc sd 1 rb sc 1 rd sa another property an n n class preserving grid dissection has is what we call the triple grid property the situation is displayed below for the case n 3 figure 8 the triple grid property both incenters and the points of intersection of the diagonals form an n n grid the green points represent the incenters of the nine smaller quadrilaterals while the red points represent the intersections of the diagonals within each of these nine quadrilaterals it can be easily seen that the incenters as well as the intersection points of the diagonals create a grid like pattern a third grid not pictured in figure 8 in order to maintain clarity is created by the 2 2 centers of these nine quadrilaterals the general proof is just a matter of algebraic verification 12 references 1 d ismailescu and a vojdany class preserving
