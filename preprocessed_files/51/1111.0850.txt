1 an infinite number of closed flrw universes for any value of the spatial curvature 1 helio v fagundes 2 instituto de f sica te rica universidade estadual paulista s o paulo sp cep 01140 070 brazil abstract the friedman lema tre robertson walker flrw cosmological models are based on the assumptions of large scale homogeneity and isotropy of the distribution of matter and energy they are usually taken to have spatial sections that are simply connected they have finite volume in the positive curvature case and infinite volume in the null and negative curvature ones i want to call the attention to the existence of an infinite number of models which are based on these same metrics but have compact finite volume multiply connected spatial sections some observational implications are briefly mentioned i friedman lema tre robertson walker models as is well known the friedman lema tre robertson walker flrw cosmological models have the general metric see for example 1 with spatial sections for k 1 for k 0 and for k 1 the spherical sections have the finite volume while the euclidean and hyperbolic ones have infinite volumes when i first studied this subject i was uncomfortable with this situation then i learned from efimov s higher geometry 3 2 that the plane could be tessellated into a mosaic of regular 4 g sided hyperbolic polygons where g 2 the tessellation or honeycomb is generated by a symmetry group such that 1 presented at the 5 th international workshop on astronomy and relativistic astrophysics jo o pessoa pb brazil october 10 12 2011 and at the 1 o simp sio jayme

there i found efimov s treatise quoted above and a p norden s elegant textbook on lobachevskian geometry 3 i eagerly studied the latter despite my poor german sin 1 22222 2 2 222 drdr kr dr tadtds 2 32 ta 2 h g 3 ts 3 te 3 th 2 is a closed meaning compact and without boundary surface of genus g in my first paper on this matter 4 i took advantage of this fact to construct a closed cosmological model with sections so i had rediscovered one of kantowski sachs metrics 5 but these sections could approximate the metrics only in a small range of t ii j wolf s book and l best s paper in wolf s spaces of constant curvature 6 i found infinitely many compact orientable 3 manifolds with k 0 and k 1 there are six classes of such euclidean spaces and a countably infinite number of spherical ones except for spherical space itself these compact spaces have nontrivial topology their fundamental group being the tessellating group e g for the flat torus for projective space but wolf s space forms include the ones with hyperbolic metric because he restricted his book to homogeneous compact manifolds and there is a theorem cf 7 for example that asserts there are no such manifolds of negative curvature then i read a paper by l a best 8 where a compact hyperbolic 3 space was constructed what led to my publishing of a two page article 9 with that manifold as spatial section 4 there it was shown that if homogeneity of the space of repeated images was substituted for homogeneity of the sources distribution then the model would not contradict on this matter the data of extra galactic astronomy best s paper also presented a number of closed hyperbolic 3 manifolds based on a regular icosahedron and a regular dodecahedron as fundamental tiles iii weeks s snappea software my final source for hyperbolic closed 3 spaces came from american geometer j r weeks who had done his ph d work at princeton university under fields medalist william p thurston known by mathematicians for his work on the topology and geometry of 3 manifolds 4 a theoretical background for the use of multiply connected spaces in flrw models has been given by ellis 10 g h 2 12 s g h 3 1 z 1 2 z 3 th 3 weeks s thesis was the development of a computer program which he called snappea 11 for the construction and study of such spaces based on their connection with the theory of knots this executable program contained a catalog of about 11 000 entries ordered by increasing volume with the sectional curvature normalized to k 1 starting with one of volume 0 94 and it provided mathematical data on each space such as the lorentz representation in minkowski coordinates for the generators of its tessellation jeff sent me a copy of snappea which was originally written only for macintosh computers i got a us 2 500 grant from funda o de amparo pesquisa do estado de s o paulo and government permission to import one such machine for instituto de f sica te rica of universidade estadual paulista s o paulo so my students and i could have access to the program iv an isosahedron based cosmological model let me finish by mentioning one of my favorite works the article quasar galaxy associations with discordant redshifts as a topological effect ii a closed hyperbolic model 12 it had one of best s icosahedron based manifolds as spatial section the title refers to an application that tried to solve a then famous controversy on the nature and distance of quasi stellar sources or quasars my paper showed the possibility of the image of a galaxy being aligned with much more distant and hence earlier images of the same galaxy when it could have been a quasar then h arp s quasar galaxy associations 13 might be produced by this topological process instead of his same distance interpretations this model was constructed before the work of the just announced physics 2011 nobel prize winners it assumed 0 0 30 the then favorite values among astrophysics and a number of source second image alignments was obtained these results were not good enough for comparison with astronomical observations but the methods used for dealing with hyperbolic geometry might still be useful as a final remark i refer to applications of the compactness of cosmological space in my 2001 paper 14 4 this talk is dedicated to the memory of distinguished brazilian scientist jayme tiomno who had a broad range of interests in
