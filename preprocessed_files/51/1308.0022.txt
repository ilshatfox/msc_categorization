associated hermitian form is closed compact ka hler manifolds have been extensively studied from a number of view points for example a compact complex surface admits a ka hler structure exactly when its first betti number is even this follows from the enriques kodaira classification grha 78 and was also proved directly in buc 99 dorfmeister and nakajima classified ka hler manifolds on which the group of holomorphic isometries acts transitively dn 88 they proved that any such manifold is holomorphically isomorphic to a bounded homogeneous do main a flag manifold and cn modulo a lattice with additive structure or a 1 product of such manifolds the transitivity condition of isometries is a very strong condition borel remmert handled the compact case by showing that any connected compact homogeneous ka hler manifold x which is homogeneous under the automor phism group of x can be written as a direct product of a complex torus and a flag manifold see theorem 2 19 the situation in the non compact setting however is not so well studied nor understood in order to consider problems that are tractable throughout this dissertation we consider a complex homogeneous manifold x g h where g is a connected complex lie group acting almost effectively on x and h is a closed complex subgroup of g such that x has a ka hler structure however a classification of such homogeneous ka hler manifolds without any restriction is not realistic in this dissertation we consider homogeneous ka hler manifolds x with a topological invariant dx 2 we mention that dx is dual to an invariant introduced by abels abe 76 and is defined as follows dx min r hn r x z 2 6 0 where by hn r x z 2 we mean the singular homology of x with coefficients 2 in z 2 and dimx n note that since x is a complex manifold x is oriented the topological invariant dx can be handled more easily in the algebraic setting because algebraic groups have a finite number of connected compo nents in fact akhiezer classified g h where g is an algebraic group and h is an algebraic subgroup with dg h 1 in akh 77 and dg h 2 in akh 83 on the other hand a closed subgroup h of a connected lie group g can have an infinite number of connected components and this phenomenon can contribute to the topology of g h and so influences dg h for example let g r and h z and g h s 1 which is compact not because of any compactness of g but because h is infinite discrete this implies that the most delicate problems in working with the invariant dx occur when the isotropy is discrete the purpose of this dissertation is to classify ka hler g h with dg h 2 in the important special case when h is discrete in fact we prove the following theorem in chapter 4 3 note that the notion of a cousin group is defined in definition 2 3 theorem 1 1 let g be a connected complex lie group and a discrete subgroup of g such that x g is ka hler and dx 2 then the group g is solvable and a finite covering of x is biholomorphic to a product c a where 3 c is a cousin group and a is e c c or c 2 moreover dx dc da the dissertation is organized as follows in chapter 2 we give a brief review of particular known classification results of g h some of which are used in our classification in chapter 3 we introduce some tools to calculate dx mentioned above we also give some other tools that are used for our classification theorem note that in these chapters h might not be discrete unless otherwise stated our main results are collected in chapter 4 while classifying homo geneous ka hler manifolds x g with discrete isotropy and dx 2 we prove that g is solvable this is related to a variant of a question of akhiezer in akh 84 that is discussed in section 2 5 finally in chapter 5 we present some projects which can be done in fu ture in the first project we introduce a method that will be used to give the full classification of homogeneous ka hler manifolds with top non vanishing homology in codimension two i e those ka hler manifolds which might not necessarily have discrete isotropy the next project involves complex mani folds that are homogeneous under the holomorphic action of real lie groups suppose x g h where g is a real lie group and h is a closed subgroup 4 of g such that g h has a left invariant complex structure we propose to investigate globalization of the g action when dx 2 the third project investigates extensions of the akhiezer question in the ka hler setting and the last one looks at finding some sufficient conditions in order that a holo morphically separable complex homogeneous manifold is stein 5 chapter 2 background in this chapter we provide background material which we will need in chap ter 4 to prove the main theorem in section 2 1 we define ka hler manifolds and present some of their properties and examples in section 2 2 we give general information about lie groups as transformation groups stein man ifolds appear in the classification theorem as fundamental building blocks we present some of their properties in section 2 3 in section 2 4 we intro duce the classification of homogeneous manifold g h when there is a special restriction on the complex lie group g one motivation for proposition 4 1 is the question of akhiezer we dis cuss this in section 2 5 let x g be a homogeneous ka hler manifold 6 with discrete isotropy such that is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup of g if there are no non constant holomorphic functions on x then lemma 2 2 states that the radical orbits of g are closed in x a fact which we will use to prove theorem 4 1 2 1 ka hler manifolds in this section we define ka hler manifolds and give a brief discussion con cerning their structure for more information we refer the reader to hw 01 can 01 or kn 63 a riemannian metric on a complex manifold m is a covariant tensor field g of degree 2 which satisfies 1 g x y 0 where g x x 0 if and only if x 0 and 2 g x y g y x where x and y are vector fields on m an almost complex structure on a manifold m is a tensor field j which is at every point m of m an endomorphism of the tangent space tmm such that j 2 1 where 1 denotes the identity transformation of tmm the almost complex structure is complex when it is integrable this means that there exist local complex coordinates on the manifold i e an atlas of holomorphically compatible complex charts defining a complex structure on 7 the manifold note that this is known to be equivalent to the vanishing of the nijenhuis tensor n x y x y j x y j x jy j jx y see nn 57 a hermitian metric on a complex manifold is a riemannian metric g which is invariant by the almost complex structure j i e g jx jy g x y for all vector fields x and y note that any paracompact real manifold has a riemannian metric one can always find such metrics locally and then use an appropriate partition of unity to extend to a global one given a riemannian metric g on any almost complex manifold note that h x y g x y g jx jy defines a hermitian metric on that manifold since h takes its values in c we can write h x y s x y ia x y note that s is symmetric and a is alternating i e a 2 form on x called the associated ka hler form if da 0 then h is called a ka hler metric definition 2 1 a ka hler manifold is a complex manifold equipped with a ka hler metric 8 2 1 1 properties of ka hler manifolds if m and n are ka hler then m n is ka hler with the product metric for any compact ka hler manifold x the odd betti numbers are even see page 117 grha 78 2 1 2 examples of ka hler manifolds cn a hermitian metric on cn is given by ds 2 n j 1 dzj dzj this metric induces a metric on the torus t cn here cn is a complete lattice acting on cn by translation and the above metric is invariant under translations and thus pushes down to the quotient t cpn complex projective space is defined via the following equivalence relation for v w cn 1 0 we let v w v w for some c then we have the holomorphic c bundle cn 1 0 cn 1 0 cpn where cpn is defined to be the base of this bundle let be a local section of i e id over an open subset v of cpn the 9 fubini study metric on v is given by its associated 1 1 form 1 2 log 2 let be another local section of the map defined over an open set w if v w 6 then g where g is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function on v w thus we have 1 2 log 2 1 2 log 2 log g log g 1 2 log g log g since this form is defined locally and is independent of the section chosen this construction yields a globally defined differential form of cpn one can also see that this form is positive and closed see page 31 grha 78 so it defines a hermitian metric on cpn thus the fubini study metric is ka hler a complex submanifold of a ka hler manifold is ka hler by the induced ka hler structure as a result any stein manifold embedded in cn or projective algebraic variety embedded in cpn is of ka hler type any riemann surface is ka hler as noted above any complex manifold 10 x admits hermitian structures and the associated hermitian form is closed for dimension reasons when dimcx 1 2 1 3 examples of non ka hler manifolds compact case any connected compact complex homogeneous manifold which is not the trivial product of a flag manifold and a torus is not a ka hler manifold the orem 2 19 we define a properly discontinuous action of the discrete group z on c 2 0 0 given by z w 2 k z w for all z w c 2 and k z the complex surface c 2 0 0 is compact and diffeomorphic to s 3 s 1 and is called the hopf surface since the hopf surface is not the product of a flag manifold and a torus it follows from the theorem of borel remmert br 62 that the hopf surface does not admit a ka hler metric 11 non compact case consider the three dimensional heisenberg group g 1 x z 0 1 y 0 0 1 x y z c and consider the discrete subgroup 1 m k il 0 1 n 0 0 1 n m l k z the center of g is the subgroup c 1 0 z 0 1 0 0 0 1 z c by a simple calculation one can see that the fibration g g c realizes g as a torus bundle over c c let g 0 be the real lie subgroup g 0 1 x z 0 1 y 0 0 1 x y r z c 12 that contains cocompactly let m g 0 ig 0 g 0 ig 0 and so g 0 m 6 0 where g 0 is the lie algebra of g 0 and g 0 is its commutator group it has been proven that if a nilmanifold g has the above form is ka hler then m g 0 0 see remark 4 b and example 6 b in or 87 for more details since this is not so here g is not ka hler 2 2 lie groups as transformation groups on complex manifolds a complex lie group is a set with the structure of both a complex manifold and a group such that the group operations are holomorphic since the sum of two solvable ideals is a solvable ideal every complex lie algebra contains a maximal solvable ideal called the radical the corresponding connected subgroup is closed and in the case of complex lie groups is complex one sees this at the lie algebra level since if r is a solvable ideal in the complex lie algebra g then a calculation shows that r ir is also a solvable ideal in g since the radical is maximal with these properties one has r r ir and thus r is a complex ideal in addition the quotient of the complex lie algebra g by the complex ideal r is a complex lie algebra say s which is semisimple 13 see theorem below the following result was first proved by levi for lie algebras but the corresponding statement for lie groups is a consequence of his result theorem 2 1 levi malcev theorem lev 05 let g be a simply connected connected lie group with radical r then there is a closed semi simple sub group s in g so that g is the semi direct product g s n r the group s is unique up to conjugation if g is complex then so are r and s if the lie group is not simply connected we may have to consider the universal covering group of g to apply the theorem for example gln c c sln c as lie groups i e g r s but r s 6 e 2 2 1 lie groups as transformation groups a holomorphic left g action of a complex lie group g on a complex manifold x is a holomorphic map g x x for g g and x x we write g x instead of g x for convenience note that g x x is holomorphic for any fixed g g we say that g is acting as a lie transformation group on x if in addition has the following two properties 1 gg x g g x for all g g g and x x 14 2 e x x for all x x here by e we mean the identity element of g we call a g action on x effective if it has an additional property that whenever g x x for all x x then g e by a g orbit g x of a point x we mean the set g x g x g g for a subset m x the stabilizer h of m in g is a subgroup of g defined by h stabg m g g g m m furthermore if m is closed then h is closed and so is a lie subgroup of g if m is a closed complex analytic subvariety and the g action is holo morphic with g a complex lie group then h is a complex lie subgroup of g here m can also be a point in which case we denote the stabilizer group by hx the map ghx 7 g x establishes an identification between the left coset g hx ghx g g and the orbit g x in general if h is a closed complex subgroup of the complex lie group g then we have the holomorphic principal bundle h g g h where g h has a complex analytic quotient structure the ineffectivity of the holomorphic action of g on x is the normal closed complex lie subgroup j x xhx this will gives us a natural action of g j on x defined by gj x g x the g action is called almost effective if the ineffectivity of the g action is discrete 15 note that from now on all our group actions are almost effective unless otherwise stated the reason for this assumption is the following the identity component j 0 of j is a normal subgroup of g contained in h one can replace g with g g j 0 and h with h h j 0 in the homogeneous manifold x g h and again get the same manifold since x g h but with an almost effective action of g instead 2 2 2 facts about discrete isotropy we begin with some facts about complex homogeneous manifolds of the form g where is a discrete subgroup of the complex lie group g these will be need later suppose x is a connected complex manifold with a g action of a complex lie group g on x given by the holomorphic map g x x for any v g let v c tv t c be the complex span of v and exp v c be the corresponding one parameter subgroup of g for x x the complex derivative at the point x defines a fundamental vector field by v x d dt t 0 exp tv x the kernel of the map v v is the lie algebra of the isotropy subgroup of the g action at the point x if x g with discrete then the map 16 v 7 v is injective so in the setting of discrete isotropy a basis of g gives us a corresponding frame on x consisting of n dimcx linearly independent holomorphic vector fields at every point i e x is complex parallelizable lemma 2 1 wan 54 let x be a connected compact parallelizable complex manifold then x g where g is a connected complex lie group and is a discrete subgroup of g proof let dimx n since x is parallelizable there are n linearly indepen dent holomorphic vector fields x 1 xn on x that generate the tangent space txx at any point x x denote by g the lie algebra of all holo morphic vector fields on x for v g there are holomorphic functions f 1 fn o x such that v n i 1 fixi every fi is constant since x is compact so g x 1 xn c is an n dimensional complex lie algebra the holomorphic vector fields on any complex manifold x give rise to local holomorphic 1 parameter groups in general a similar statement about global 1 parameter groups does not hold however for x compact every holomorphic vector field on x can be globally integrated to a holomorphic 1 parameter group of x as a consequence the connected simply connected complex lie group g associated to the lie algebra g acts holomorphically on the compact manifold x the g orbit of every point x x is open because 17 the vector fields generating g also generate tx x since x is connected g is transitive on x for dimension reasons the isotropy of the g action on x is a discrete subgroup of g hence x is biholomorphic to g 2 3 stein manifolds definition 2 2 a complex manifold x is a stein manifold if the following two conditions hold 1 x is holomorphically separable i e for two distinct points x and y in x there exists a holomorphic function f o x such that f x 6 f y 2 x is holomorphically convex i e for any compact subset k x the holomorphic convex hull k x x f x sup k f for all f o x is again a compact subset of x here we give some well known examples example 2 1 1 cn is stein 18 2 a domain cn is called a domain of holomorphy if there do not exist non empty open sets 1 and 2 cn where 2 is connected 2 6 and 1 2 such that for every holomorphic function f on there exists a holomorphic function g on 2 with f g on 1 a connected open set in cn is a domain of holomorphy if and only if it is holomorphically convex domains of holomorphy in cn are stein 3 non compact riemann surfaces are stein bs 49 4 every closed complex submanifold of a stein manifold is stein 5 the cartesian product of two stein manifold is a stein manifold 6 suppose x y is a covering map with x stein if the fiber of this covering map is finite then y is stein ste 56 theorem 2 2 embedding theorem rem 56 let x be a stein manifold then there exists a proper biholomorphic map of x onto a closed complex submanifold of some cn remark 2 1 any stein manifold is also a ka hler manifold one can pull back a ka hler form on cn by using a proper biholomorphic map given by the embedding theorem cited above 19 holomorphic bundles over stein manifolds if x b is a holomorphic covering space and the base b is stein then x is stein ste 56 this is also true for holomorphic vector bundles but might fail for fiber bundles with fibers cn n 1 and with a nonlinear transition group see for example skoda sk 77 for a c 2 bundle over an open subset in c whose total space is not stein here we present a version of the grauert oka principle which we will use in the main theorem theorem 2 3 grauert oka principle satz 6 in gr 58 let x f b be a holomorphic fiber bundle where f is a complex manifold and b is a stein complex manifold assume the group of the bundle is a not necessarily con nected complex lie group if the bundle x is continuously homotopic to another bundle x over the stein base b then it is holomorphically homo topic to x in particular if the bundle x is topologically trivial then it is holomorphically trivial theorem 2 4 satz 7 in gr 58 let x be an analytic fiber bundle over a non compact riemann surface y with a connected complex lie group as its structure group then x is analytically trivial 20 remark 2 2 we later use a classical result of serre concerning the vanish ing of certain homology groups of stein manifolds ser 53 footnote p 59 stating that if x is an n dimensional stein manifold then hk x z 2 0 for all k n where by hk x z 2 we mean the kth homology group of x with coefficients in z 2 2 3 1 lie s flag theorem a particular example of a stein manifold as a homogeneous manifold is given by the orbits of a complex linear solvable lie group g acting holomorphically on pn by lie s flag theorem see 4 1 in hum 72 there is a full flag x l 1 l 2 ln pn that is stabilized by the g action on pn suppose x g y is some orbit of the group g in pn and set k min m x lm 6 without loss of generality we may assume that y lk and thus x lk since lk is g invariant thus x x lk lk lk 1 cm 21 as a consequence x is holomorphically separable in this setting snow proved theorem 3 3 sno 85 that x is biholomorphic to c s ct and thus that x is stein 2 4 toward the classification of homogeneous manifolds let g be a complex lie group and h a closed complex subgroup borel and remmert br 62 classified compact connected homogeneous ka hler mani folds see also theorem 2 19 they showed that any such manifold is the direct product of a complex torus and a flag manifold it is not realistic to classify non compact homogeneous ka hler manifolds g h without any restriction in this section we present helpful results when there is a condition on g we will use these results in chapter 4 note that we are interested in applying the topological restriction dx 2 which we will introduce in section 3 4 in the next result and throughout this thesis we need the concept of an affine cone minus its vertex for the convenience of the reader we now recall what this is suppose q s p is a flag manifold where s is a connected 22 complex semisimple lie group and p is a parabolic subgroup then q can be s equivariantly embedded into some projective space pn consider this projective space as the hyperplane at infinity in the projective space pn 1 i e pn 0 z 1 zn 1 pn 1 where we have used homogeneous coordinates now consider the complex manifold x consisting of all the complex lines joining the point 1 0 0 to points in q contained in the hyperplane at infinity but minus the point 1 0 0 itself and the points of q this is the affine cone minus its vertex over the flag manifold q it happens that x s h is homogeneous under the induced s action and s h s p is a c bundle where h is the kernel of a non trivial character p c as an example if q pn then x cn 1 0 theorem 2 5 ag 94 suppose g is a connected complex lie group and h is a closed complex subgroup such that x g h satisfies o x 6 c and dx 2 let y g j be the base of the holomorphic reduction see section 3 3 of x and f j h be its fiber a if dx 1 then f is compact and connected and y is an affine cone minus its vertex 23 b if dx 2 then one of the following two cases occurs b 1 the fiber f is connected and satisfies df 1 and the base y is an affine cone minus its vertex b 2 the fiber f is compact and connected and dy 2 moreover y is one of the following manifolds 1 the complex line c 2 the affine quadric q 2 3 p 2 q where q is a quadric curve 4 a homogeneous holomorphic c bundle over an affine cone with its vertex removed in this case y is either an algebraic principal c bundle or is covered two to one by such 2 4 1 g abelian let g be an abelian complex lie group with a closed subgroup h thus h is normal and g h is an abelian complex lie group in the following we define a special complex lie group called a cousin group and then give a classification of complex abelian lie groups 24 cousin group cousin was the first to call attention to abelian non compact complex lie groups now called cousin groups or toroidal groups with the additional property that o c c these groups appear in the classification of abelian complex lie groups mor 66 definition 2 3 cousin group a cousin group is a complex lie group c which admits no non constant holomorphic function let c be a connected complex lie group with o c c since glc v is holomorphically separable there is no non constant holomorphic homo morphism c glc v to the general linear group of a complex vector space v let v c be the lie algebra of c the kernel of the adjoint rep resentation ad c glc c is the center of c showing that a connected complex lie group c with o c c is abelian since a cousin group is abelian the exponential map exp c c is a surjective homomorphism the kernel of the exponential map is discrete so c c since c is a vector space it is isomorphic to cn for some n this gives us the structure of a cousin group c cn where is a discrete additive subgroup of cn note that we have the real torus span r 25 inside any cousin group classification of connected abelian complex lie groups we first give a classification of connected abelian real lie group g with lie algebra g since x y 0 for all x y g we can consider the lie algebra g as a vector space over r for an abelian connected lie group the exponential map exp g g is a surjective homomorphism with discrete kernel thus a finitely generated free abelian group theorem 3 6 page 25 bt 85 hence ker exp v 1 vp z where v 1 vp is a linearly independent set of vectors in g let v v 1 vp r and choose a complementary vector subspace w with g v w recall dim g n dimv p so dimw n p then g g ker exp v w v 1 vp r v v 1 vp z w s 1 p rn p here k s 1 p is the product of p copies of a circle s 1 and is the unique maximal compact subgroup of g for an abelian complex lie group g cn one has the following classi 26 fication due to remmert and morimoto e g see mor 66 we now choose a complex vector space w that is complementary to v v 1 vp c since g is holomorphically isomorphic to v w we can reduce to the setting where generates v as a complex vector space and w ct let v r then the corresponding subgroup k v is the maximal compact subgroup of g set w v iv the maximal complex vector subspace of v the w orbits in g are isomorphic to w w and give a complex foliation of g the closure of the w orbit through the identity of g is a subtorus l 1 of k and we can choose a complementary totally real subtorus l 2 such that k l 1 l 2 there are uniquely defined vector subspaces li of v such that li li li and we set ui li ili assuming generates v as a complex vector space we have g v u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 note that u 2 u 2 c s since l 2 is totally real we claim u 1 u 1 is a cousin group i e that o u 1 u 1 c for any f o u 1 u 1 the restriction of f to l 1 attains a maximum at some point x l 1 since the latter group is compact the orbit map m 7 g is holomorphic and thus the pullback of f to m is holomorphic and 27 its modulus attains a maximum at any preimage of x by the maximum principle this pullback function is constant thus f is constant on the orbit of f through x since this orbit is dense in l 1 the restriction of f to l 1 is constant finally by using the identity principle it follows from the fact that l 1 l 1 l 1 and u 1 l 1 il 1 that f is constant on u 1 u 1 i e u 1 u 1 is a cousin group example 2 2 the set 1 0 0 1 i i is linearly independent over r where 0 1 and q let v 1 0 0 1 i i r one can check that k v 1 0 0 1 i i z is the maximal compact subgroup of c c 2 1 0 0 1 i i z we claim that o c c here m 1 c the orbit of m in c is dense in k thus l k in this case and lc kc c suppose f o c define c m z 7 z 1 consider the holomorphic map c m exp m f c since m lies in k and f k is compact the holomorphic function f exp is a bounded entire function hence constant but and exp are not constant therefore f m is constant and thus f k is constant however k has real co dimension one in c it follows that f is constant on c 28 2 4 2 g nilpotent we need the following definition definition 2 4 a principal cousin group tower of length one is a cousin group a principal cousin group tower of length n 1 is a principal holomorphic bundle with fiber a cousin group and base a principal cousin group of length n 1 one has the following structure theorem theorem 2 6 gh 78 let g be a connected nilpotent complex lie group and let h be a closed complex subgroup of g then there exists a closed complex subgroup j of g containing h such that o g h o g j where g h g j is the bundle projec tion g j is stein the fiber j h is connected o j h c j h is a principal cousin group tower e g see theorem iv 1 5 in oel 85 29 proof sketch one can reduce the situation to the discrete case by the following argument the holomorphic reduction of g h factors through the normalizer fibration since the base of the normalizer fibration is holomorphically separable lie s flag theorem so it is enough to consider the normalizer fibration g h n h g j g n by assumption g is a connected nilpotent lie group and h 0 is a connected subgroup of g matsushima mat 51 proved that for a nilpotent lie group g the normalizer n ng h 0 of a connected subgroup is connected so g n cn and g h g n n h by theorem 2 3 as a consequence it is enough to study the fiber of the normalizer fibration which has discrete isotropy to be discussed in section 3 1 from now on we assume h is a discrete subgroup of g such that the smallest closed connected complex subgroup of g containing is all of g the center z of g is a positive dimensional normal subgroup of g i e z is a closed subgroup of g see gh 78 we have the fibration g z g z 30 this fibration is applied to the base of the holomorphic reduction to prove by induction that g is holomorphically separable if and only if gr is totally real in g if and only if g is stein for more explanation see gh 78 d akhiezer akh 84 and k oeljeklaus oel 85 showed the following re sult that applies to the fiber of the holomorphic reduction of any complex nilmanifold x and proves the remaining point in this structure result for complex nilmanifolds theorem 2 7 theorem iv 1 5 oel 85 let x g be a complex nil manifold with o g c then x is a principal cousin group tower proof sketch the proof is by induction on dimg and for dimg 1 it is clear that g is a torus if g is abelian clearly g is a complex lie group with o g c and thus g is a cousin group so we assume the center z of g satisfies 0 dimz dimg its orbit z z is closed in g and is a connected abelian complex lie group in the previous section we noted that z z is isomorphic to a product ck c p c where c is a cousin group we need to show that dimc 0 in order to apply the induction 31 as noted above there is a real connected subgroup gr of g containing cocompactly and since g is not stein gr is not totally real thus the ideal m gr igr 6 0 let z be the center of g and set h z m in a nilpotent lie algebra every non zero ideal intersects the center non trivially so h 6 0 see page 13 in hum 72 leth be the lie group corresponding to h let k denote the lie algebra of the maximal compact subgroup k of z z note that k contains a positive dimensional complex lie subgroup namely the orbit of h through e thus dimc 0 let c denote the preimage of c in g and note that c is a central closed complex subgroup of g that has closed orbits in g then the holomorphic fibration g g c has the positive dimensional cousin group c as fiber and the lower dimensional complex nilmanifold g c as base also because of the fact that c is central in g this bundle is a principal bundle since necessarily o g c c the result now follows by induction 2 4 3 g solvable let g be a connected solvable complex lie group and be a discrete sub group assume there exists a closed connected real subgroup gr of g containing such that gr is compact the triple g gr will be called 32 a crs manifold the condition for the existence of such a real subgroup gr in a given complex solvable lie group g and discrete subgroup is not known however if g is a nilpotent complex lie group then it contains such a real lie subgroup mal 49 note that the classification of g for a ka hler solvmanifold is given in go 11 whenever gr exists and gr is of codimension two inside g c ure and loeb present the following example cl 85 which states that in the solvable case this real subgroup might exist but g might not even be ka hler example 2 3 let gk k n k 2 where k z or c with the group operation given by z b z b z z eaz b b where z z k b b k 2 and a is the real logarithm of the matrix 2 1 1 1 then gc is a connected simply connected three dimensional complex lie group that contains the discrete subgroup gz such that its holo morphic reduction is given by gc gz gc g c gz with the base biholomorphic to c and the fiber to c c 33 huckleberry and e oeljeklaus showed that the base of the holomorphic reduction is stein theorem p 58 in ho 86 the following two theorems give valuable information for holomorphic reductions of ka hler solvmanifolds theorem 2 8 or 88 let x be a ka hler solvmanifold and let x f y denote the holomorphic reduction of x then y is a stein manifold and f is a cousin group moreover the first fundamental group 1 x contains a nilpotent subgroup of finite index theorem 2 9 go 08 suppose g is a connected solvable complex lie group and h is a closed complex subgroup of g with x g h a ka hler manifold let g h g i be the holomorphic reduction then there is a subgroup of finite index i i such that the bundle x g i h g i is a holomorphic i 0 h i 0 principal bundle and represents the holomorphic reduction of x 34 2 4 4 g semi simple let g be a semisimple complex lie group and recall that g admits the structure of a linear algebraic group a borel subgroup of g is a maximal connected solvable subgroup of g a parabolic subgroup is a subgroup of g containing a borel subgroup if p is a parabolic subgroup of g then the manifold g p is a flag manifold for information on flag manifolds we refer the reader to wol 69 and 3 1 in akh 95 theorem 2 10 bo 88 and corollary 4 12 in gmo 13 let g be a semi simple complex lie group and h a closed complex subgroup of g then the following conditions are equivalent i h is algebraic ii the homogeneous space g h is ka hler one important consequence of this theorem is that when x is a ka hler manifold under the transitive action of a semisimple group with discrete isotropy then the isotropy group is automatically a finite set of points one should note that since there is no known classification of discrete subgroups of complex lie groups even in low dimensional cases such as sl 2 c the 35 classification of semisimple homogeneous manifolds is impossible at the mo ment 2 4 5 g linear algebraic theorem 2 11 let g be a connected complex linear algebraic group and h an algebraic subgroup of g set x g h 1 akh 83 suppose dx 2 then the space x is a twisted product x g p f here p is a parabolic subgroup of g and the manifold f is isomorphic to a 1 c c or p 2 q with q a quadric and the transitive operation p f f is given by affine transformation by group translations or by projective transformations preserving q 2 akh 77 if dg h 1 then there exists a parabolic subgroup p of g containing h such that g h g p is a c bundle over the flag manifold g p 2 4 6 g reductive a complex lie group is reductive if it is the complexification of a totally real maximal compact subgroup then a finite covering of any reductive complex 36 lie group has the form s r where r c k in passing we note that here s eg the following result had been proved earlier theorem 2 12 mat 60 oni 60 let g be a reductive complex lie group h be a closed complex subgroup then g h is stein if and only if h is reductive in passing we note that the ka hler setting is characterized by the follow ing theorem 2 13 theorem 5 1 in gmo 13 suppose g is a reductive complex lie group with levi malcev decomposition g s r and let h be a closed complex subgroup of g then g h is ka hler if and only if s h is closed in g and s h is an algebraic subgroup of s theorem 2 14 lemma in 2 4 in bo 73 assume g is a reductive com plex lie group let h be a closed subgroup with h as its zariski closure every h invariant holomorphic function on g is necessarily h invariant in other words for g reductive the holomorphic reduction g j of the complex homogeneous space g h is also the holomorphic reduction for g h and so the holomorphic reduction map factors through g h as is given in 37 the following commutative diagram g h g h g j in fact j is algebraic see satz in 2 5 in bo 73 2 5 akhiezer s question in ka hler setting a ka hler manifold x g with discrete isotropy and dx 2 is a solvmanifold see proposition 4 1 this interesting phenomenon which we prove is related to a question of akhiezer akh 84 the original question concerned the existence of analytic hypersurfaces in complex homogeneous manifolds we consider the following variant of this question in the ka hler setting modified question of akhiezer suppose x g h is a ka hler homogeneous manifold that satisfies i o x c ii there is no proper parabolic subgroup of g which contains h 38 is g then solvable note that if g is known to be solvable then it follows that x is a cousin group by theorem 2 8 since in that theorem the base of the holomorphic reduction of x will be a point hence x will be isomorphic to the fiber of its holomorphic reduction which is a cousin group we will need the following theorem 2 15 corollary 6 p 49 in ho 84 let g h be a complex homogeneous manifold and n ng h 0 if o g h c and if n 6 g then h is contained in a proper parabolic subgroup p in g next we prove that the radical orbits in some special setting are closed we use this fact to prove proposition 4 1 note that the following example shows the radical orbits might not be closed in general example 2 4 consider g s 1 r where we consider the circle as complex numbers of modulus one let be the discrete subgroup ik k k z where is an irrational number note that r is not closed in g for a complex version of this embed the s 1 into the diagonal matrices in s sl 2 c which is biholomorphic to c set g s c one can see that r is not closed in g where r denotes the radical of g 39 lemma 2 2 suppose g is a mixed connected complex lie group i e g s r is a levi malcev decomposition where both s and r have positive di mension let x g where the discrete isotropy is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup of g if there is no non constant holomorphic function on x then the radical orbits of g are closed in x proof all r orbits are closed if and only if r is closed to prove that r is closed we assume it is not and derive a contradiction let h r where by bar we mean the topological closure auslander using earlier results of zassenhaus aus 63 proved that h 0 is solvable if h 0 is not a complex lie group let h 1 be the connected lie subgroup of g associated to the complex lie algebra h 1 h ih where h denotes the lie algebra of h 0 note that h 1 is solvable and complex if h 1 is not closed we continue this process which has to stop after a finite number of steps because g has finite dimension we let i be the minimal closed connected complex solvable lie group obtained in this manner define j ng i note that i is not the radical since by assumption r does not have closed orbits and so j 6 g now consider the fibration g g j since j is by definition the normalizer of a connected group we see that g j is an orbit in some projective space see section 3 1 since o g c it then follows that 40 o g j c theorem 2 15 applies so j is contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of g if we prove that j then is contained in this proper parabolic subgroup which is a contradiction to our assumptions to see this first note that for any g h we have gh 0 g 1 h 0 and so we have h 0 gig 1 i but i is the minimal closed connected complex solvable lie group that contains h 0 so gig 1 i hence h j but h thus j and this contradiction proves that r is closed in g we first look at the case where g s r i e g is the trivial product group of a maximal semisimple subgroup s with the radical r of g lemma 2 3 lemma 6 in ag 94 suppose g is a complex lie group whose levi decomposition is a direct product s r let be a discrete subgroup of g such that s is finite then is contained in a subgroup of the form a r where a is an algebraic subgroup of s such that its identity component a 0 is solvable we will use the following theorem in chapter 4 theorem 2 16 p 116 in or 87 theorem 2 in gi 04 suppose g is a connected simply connected complex lie group whose levi malcev decompo 41 sition is a direct product g s r suppose is a discrete subgroup of g such that x g satisfies the conditions a x is ka hler b is not contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of g and c x does not possess non constant holomorphic functions then s e that is g is a cousin group depending on the analytic behavior of the radical orbits there is an answer to the akhiezer s question if the radical orbits do not possess any non constant holomorphic functions then we have the following theorem which basically presents us to the situation of the theorem 2 16 theorem 2 17 theorem 3 in gi 04 suppose g is a connected complex lie group and is a discrete subgroup of g such that g satisfies the condition a b and c of the theorem 2 16 let r denote the radical of g assume the typical radical orbit has no non constant holomorphic function that is o r c then s e that is g is solvable if the r orbits possess non constant holomorphic functions then the an swer to akhiezer s question in the general ka hler setting is not known how ever enough is known in certain cases that we are able to use these results 42 to prove the classification in our main theorem the remaining special case that we need is when g s n r is a semidirect product and the radical r has complex dimension two then one has the following theorem which is extracted from the proof of lemma 8 in ag 94 lemma 2 4 let g be a complex lie group with levi malcev decomposition g s n r with dimcr 2 let be a discrete subgroup of g such that x g is ka hler then is contained in a proper subgroup of g of the form anr where a is a proper algebraic subgroup of s proof without loss of generality we may assume that g is simply connected suppose that the adjoint action of s on r is trivial then g s r and s is finite by theorem 2 10 the result follows by lemma 2 3 i e anr where a is a proper algebraic subgroup of s assume now that the adjoint action of s on r is not trivial then we claim that r is abelian if not then r is one dimensional and s invariant hence the s action on r is trivial and since s is semisimple this action is completely reducible so there is a one dimensional subspace of r comple mentary to r that is also s invariant but this action is also trivial which gives a contradiction to the s action on r being non trivial so r is abelian and the s action on r is irreducible 43 we next note that g has the structure of a linear algebraic group we see this in the following way consider a semisimple complex lie group s with an irreducible two dimensional representation r s gl 2 c since s is perfect its image is too and thus this image must be isomorphic to sl 2 c which is 3 dimensional by the rank nullity theorem the kernel of r has codimension 3 and is a normal subgroup of s thus s decomposes as a direct product s s 1 s 2 where s 2 acts trivial and s 1 sl 2 c with the usual action on c 2 any element s s has the form s 1 s 2 with s 1 having different eigenvalues and s 2 acting trivially on r so g s 2 s 1 n c 2 since s 2 and s 1 nc 2 are both linear algebraic it follows that g has a linear algebraic structure we claim that is contained in a proper algebraic subgroup of g we assume not i e that is zariski dense in g and derive a contradiction then is zariski dense in s where g s denotes the projection it follows that contains a free group with two generators that is also zariski dense in s ti 72 we pick preimages of two of these generators in and let be the subgroup of generated by these elements there is a torsion free subgroup 1 of finite index in corollary 6 13 page 95 rag 08 then 1 is also zariski dense in s for any g g the intersection 1 gsg 1 is 44 finite since the gsg 1 orbit in the ka hler manifold g 1 has finite isotropy bo 88 since 1 is torsion free we have 1 gsg 1 e thus 1 e g g g gsg 1 g 1 s z 1 z where z is a proper zariski closed subset of s given by lemma 7 in ag 94 then 1 z contradicting the fact that 1 is zariski dense in s hence is not zariski dense in g i e a is a proper algebraic subgroup of s so anr as desired this has the following consequence which we use later theorem 2 18 suppose g is a connected complex lie group with levi malcev decomposition g s n r with dimcr 2 let be a discrete subgroup of g such that x g is ka hler is not contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of g and o g c then s e i e g is solvable proof the radical orbits are closed by lemma 2 2 by lemma 2 4 the sub group is contained in a proper subgroup of g of the form anr where a is an algebraic subgroup of s thus there are fibrations g g r s a where the base g r s with s r if a is reductive then s a is stein and we get non constant holomorphic functions on x as pullbacks 45 using the above fibrations but this contradicts the assumption that o x c if a is not contained in a proper reductive subgroup then theorem in 30 4 in hum 75 applies and a is contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of s and so is thus contradicting the assumption that this is not the case we finish this chapter with a very well known theorem of borel and remmert concerning compact complex ka hler manifold we will refer to this theorem through this thesis theorem 2 19 br 62 let x be a connected compact complex ka hler mani fold such that the group of all holomorphic transformations of x is transitive then x is the product of a complex torus and a flag manifold 46 chapter 3 basic tools fibration methods one of our standard tools throughout is the use of fibrations in particular those that arise as homogeneous fibrations i e g h j h g j where g is a complex lie group and j and h are closed complex subgroups with h contained in j let h 0 be the identity component of h and h be the largest subgroup of h normal in j the group of the bundle is j h acting in j h as left translations see the theorem on page 30 ste 57 if this action is trivial the bundle splits as the trivial product g j j h 47 here we give a brief explanation of some fibrations that we will use in later chapters for further discussion we refer the reader to the references ho 84 hu 90 and ho 81 3 1 normalizer fibration the normalizer of a subgroup of a group has been a useful tool in group theory for a long time tits was the first who analyzed the structure of com pact complex homogeneous manifolds using the normalizer subgroup ti 62 given a complex homogeneous manifold x g h where g is a connected complex lie group and h is a closed complex subgroup let n ng h 0 be the normalizer in g of the identity component h 0 of h then h n and n is a closed complex subgroup of g one then has the fibration g h g n this fibration is useful because its base g n is an orbit in some projective space to see this consider the adjoint representation ad g gl g where g is the lie algebra of g let h be the lie algebra of h since h is a vector subspace of dimension k in the vector space g of dimension n we may consider h as a point in grassmann manifold gr k n and n as its isotropy group as a conclusion we can always consider the base of a normalizer 48 fibration g n as an orbit in some grassmann manifold by plu cker embed ding theorem this grassmann manifold can be equivariantly embedded in a complex projective space pm since h 0 is normal in n it acts trivially on the fiber f n h and we can write the fiber as f n where h h 0 is a discrete subgroup of the complex lie group n n h 0 thus the fiber of the normalizer fibra tion is always complex parallelizable if the fiber of the normalizer fibration is also compact and ka hler then the lemma below shows that it is a torus lemma 3 1 corollary 2 in wan 54 let x be a compact complex paral lelizable ka hler manifold then x is a torus i e x cn where is a co compact discrete additive subgroup proof by lemma 2 1 we have x g to prove the lemma it is enough to prove that the lie algebra g is abelian and so g cn let 1 n be a basis of right invariant holomorphic 1 forms on g because these forms are right g invariant they are right invariant so we can consider them as forms on x since x is compact and ka hler holomorphic forms on x are closed hence for the basis x 1 xn of invariant vector fields on x one 49 has 0 d i xj xk 1 2 xj i xk xk i xj i xj xk i xj xk for all i j and k see page 36 kn 63 this implies xj xk 0 for all j and k and therefore the lie algebra g is abelian the base of the normalizer fibration of a compact homogeneous manifold is a flag manifold if a homogeneous complex manifold is not compact it might happen that the base is compact the next lemma is the borel fixed point theorem and is stated here for future reference lemma 3 2 if the base g n of the normalizer fibration is compact then it is a flag manifold i e homogeneous under the effective action of a semisim ple group 3 2 commutator fibration the base of the normalizer fibration is an orbit in some projective space in this setting g is represented as a complex linear group with g as its lie algebra let g be the algebraic closure of g and note that the corresponding g orbit g h contains the g orbit g h by abuse of language we are using 50 h to denote the isotropy of the g orbit and not the algebraic closure of h since g is an algebraic group acting algebraically on the projective space its commutator subgroup g is also algebraic and has closed orbits this gives rise to the following diagram g h g h g i g g h let g be the commutator group of g with g as its lie algebra by cheval ley s theorem theorem 13 page 173 che 51 one has g g and thus g g now we claim that i g h g g h let g g 1 g 2 g g h where g 1 g g and g 2 h but since g 2 g h h we conclude g g 1 g 2 g h and hence g g h g h the opposite inclusion is also true and we get the equality as desired as a consequence g i g g h is an orbit in the affine algebraic abelian group g g h since the latter group is stein we see that g g h is also stein and we have the commutator group fibration g h g g h if g is also solvable then the commutator group is unipotent so the fiber of the above fibration is algebraically isomorphic to some affine space cn 51 3 3 holomorphic reduction let x g h be a homogeneous complex manifold where g is a con nected complex lie group and h a closed complex subgroup define an equivalence relation on x by x y f x f y f o x we have the natural map x x g j where j g g f gh f eh f o g h then j is a closed complex subgroup of g and contains h the map is called the holomorphic reduction of x note that for an arbitrary complex manifolds non homogeneous x might not be locally compact and so might not have the structure of a complex space also the base of a holo morphic reduction need not to be stein and one may not have o j h 6 c example 3 1 in g sl 2 c we let h 1 k 0 1 k z 52 the algebraic closure of h is h 1 w 0 1 w c we have the intermediate fibration g h g h g j where j is the subgroup of g that appears in the definition of the holomorphic reduction of g h since g is reductive the theorem of barth and otte theorem 2 14 applies and every h invariant holomorphic function on g is necessarily h invariant note that h j hence the holomorphic reduction of g h and g h are the same in this case g h c 2 0 0 which is holomorphically separable i e j h so we see that the base of the holomorphic reduction is not necessarily stein the fiber j h c is stein and so not necessarily a cousin group the holomorphic reduction has the following properties the homogeneous complex manifold g j is holomorphically separable o g j o g h i e all holomorphic functions on g h arise as the pullbacks of holomorphic functions on g j via the holomorphic map 53 3 4 topological invariant dx by dx we mean the co dimension of the top singular homology group of x with coefficients in z 2 that does not vanish definition 3 1 let x be an oriented manifold with dimrx n define dx min k hn k x z 2 6 0 note that dx 0 exactly if the manifold x is compact otherwise dx is positive the integer dx is dual to an invariant introduced by h abels abe 76 the following theorem is a good tool to calculate dx when x has connected isotropy the reader should note that this does not apply in the setting of discrete isotropy and one needs the fibration lemma given in the next section in order to handle that setting theorem 3 1 covariant fibration mos 55 let g be a connected real lie group and h a connected closed lie subgroup further suppose k is a max imal compact subgroup of g and l is a maximal compact subgroup of h contained in k then g h can be retracted by a strong retraction to the compact space k l i e g h admits the structure of a real vector bundle over k l thus dg h dim g h dim k l 54 since g k rs and h l rt where l k and g h r s t k l we have dg h s t for example since x c is diffeomorphic to s 1 r we see that dx 1 here we bring a more interesting example which we use later example 3 2 lemmas 1 and 2 akh 83 suppose g is an algebraic group and h is an algebraic subgroup with unipotent radicals u and v respectively then a direct computation of dimensions shows us that dg h dimcg dimch dimc u dimc v as a consequence if j is an algebraic subgroup such that h j g then dg h dg j dj h example 3 3 we consider what happens for s sl 2 c and various algebraic subgroups of this s note that k su 2 here subexample a let h b be a borel subgroup of s then s h is compact and ds h 0 subexample b let h be a maximal unipotent subgroup of a borel subgroup of s such h is isomorphic to c and l e the minimal compact orbit in s h is k l su 2 e and s h fibers as a holomorphic c bundle over p 1 it follows that ds h 1 55 subexample c now let h diag 1 c here l s 1 and v r where the equivalences are topological hence the minimal compact orbit in s h is k l su 2 s 1 and s h fibers as an affine c bundle over p 1 i e s h is the affine quadric thus ds h 2 the normalizer n h of h gives a 2 1 covering s h s n h where the base is p 2 q with q a quadric curve thus ds n h dp 2 q 2 subexample d let h e then ds 3 example 3 4 let g be the heisenberg group consisting of matrices of the form 1 x y 0 1 z 0 0 1 where x y z c for any integer k from 0 to 6 we can make discrete subgroups such that dg k for example if we define to be a subgroup of g with x z z and y z iz then dg 2 since g t c c where t is a one dimensional complex torus 56 3 4 1 the fibration lemma if h is a connected subgroup of a connected lie group g such that i h g where i is another connected subgroup of g by iwasawa decomposition we have the homeomorphisms g k rs h l rt and i m ru where we can choose maximal compact subgroups k l and m of g h and i respectively such that m l k by theorem 3 1 we have the simple calculation dg i s u s t t u dg h dh i this was noted in example 3 2 in the setting of algebraic groups since we are dealing with isotropy subgroups that are not connected we need the next observations to handle these settings interesting such groups exist e g see the proof of proposition 4 2 lemma 3 3 given a locally trivial fiber bundle x f b with f x b con nected smooth manifolds the following were proved using spectral sequences in 2 in ag 94 1 if the bundle is orientable e g if 1 b 0 then dx df db 2 if b has the homotopy type of a q dimensional cw complex then dx df dimb q 57 3 if b is homotopy equivalent to a compact manifold then dx df db for example this happens if b is homogeneous with connected isotropy or is a solvmanifold aus 63 58 chapter 4 main results in this chapter we give the classification theorem for homogeneous ka hler manifolds with discrete isotropy and with top non vanishing homology in codimension at most two in section 4 1 we prove that all such manifolds are solvmanifolds this partially answers the modified question of akhiezer discussed in section 2 5 in section 4 2 we prove that any homogeneous ka hler manifold with dis crete isotropy which is a torus bundle over c c splits as a product we use this in section 4 3 to prove the main theorem we prove that any homogeneous ka hler manifold x with dx 2 and with discrete isotropy is a product of a cousin group and one of e c c or c 2 59 4 1 reduction to solvable case we now prove one of the key ingredients that will allow us to prove our classification in the case of discrete isotropy first we need the following lemmas lemma 4 1 let g be a connected complex lie group that acts holomorphi cally transitively and effectively on any of the following complex manifolds 1 c c 2 c c or 3 c c 2 where c is a cousin group then g is solvable proof we first claim that the g action on c a induces a transitive g action on a where a is c c or c c to see this let p c a a be the projection map to the second factor since o c c and a is holomorphically separable p g c z is always a point in a for all g g and z a since the g action is holomorphic and p is also holomorphic this induces the required action on a 60 let g snr be a levi malcev decomposition of the complex lie group g theorem 2 1 for any complex lie group h if s h is a lie homomorphism then s is semi simple see section 5 2 hum 72 a fact which we use later if a c it follows that the g action on c is given by a homomorphism g aut c but aut c c n c is solvable i e s e by a fact mentioned above let a c note that aut c 0 c which is solvable hence s e for any homomorphism g aut c let a c 2 and assume that the g action on c 2 is given by a representation g aut c 2 first s has no 1 dimensional orbit in a such an orbit would be a p 1 since c 2 is holomorphically separable this is not possible if s has a two dimensional orbit then the s action is transitive i e c 2 s h for some algebraic subgroup h of s consider part of the exact homology sequence for the fibration s h s h as follows 1 s 1 c 2 0 h both 1 s and 0 h are finite but 1 c 2 z 2 is infinite giving us a contradiction hence s acts ineffectively on a c 2 too 61 under the g action on c a the semisimple group s stabilizes c z 0 which is given by a representation g aut 0 c c this means s e so s is acting ineffectively i e s e hence g is solvable in all cases lemma 4 2 let g be a connected complex lie group and a discrete sub group of g such that x g is a homogeneous ka hler manifold assume that is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup of g o g c and dx 2 then g is solvable proof according to lemma 2 2 the r orbits are closed and we have the fibration g g r s where s r is zariski dense and discrete in s there are two cases one case is when the r orbits have no non constant holomorphic functions using theorem 2 17 we get the desired conclusion the other case is when o r 6 c let j be the closed complex subgroup of r that contains so that we have the holomorphic reduction r r j note that this exists by the discussion in 3 3 this holomorphic reduction gives the intermediate fibration g g j g r 62 note that since j 0 cg theorem 2 15 page 39 we can make the following quotients g g j 0 r r j 0 j j j 0 which gives g j g j and g s r where s is a levi factor for g applying the result stated in section 3 3 on page 57 and the topological condition dg 2 we have 2 dg dr j dimcr j hence dimc r 1 or 2 if dimc r 1 then s acts trivially on r and theorem 2 17 on page 42 applies and g is solvable since g s r we have s e but g s r hence g is also solvable if dimc r 2 then either g s r which again is the case dealt with in theorem 2 17 or g is not a trivial product of s and r this with theorem 2 18 on page 45 proves g is solvable lemma 4 3 let c be a connected abelian lie group and a a closed con nected subgroup then da dc proof the maximal compact subgroups in this setting are unique and c k v and a l w with l k and with the vector space group w 63 contained in the vector space group v it now follows from the definition of d that da dimrw dimr v dc lemma 4 4 let g be a connected complex lie group and a discrete subgroup let x g be a ka hler manifold for any semisimple lie subgroup s of g the s orbit s s is closed proof let s be a complex semi simple lie subgroup of g pick x x so that the s orbit through x is of minimal dimension such an s orbit is necessarily closed inside x otherwise it has a boundary of a smaller dimension theorem 3 6 gmo 11 note that remark 2 2 in the same paper guarantees that we are in the situation of the theorem since dims x dims dim s and dim s 0 we conclude that all s orbits are minimal i e of the same dimension and closed lemma 4 5 let be a finite subgroup of a semisimple lie group s then ds 3 proof this follows since ds ds codimrk 3 where s kc and k is any maximal compact subgroup of s 64 lemma 4 6 suppose g sl 2 c nr and is a discrete subgroup g with x g ka hler and dx 2 then is not contained in a proper parabolic subgroup p of g proof we assume is contained in a proper parabolic subgroup p of g and derive a contradiction such a group has the form p b n r where b is isomorphic to a borel subgroup of sl 2 c consider the holomorphic reduction p j p j and note that because p is solvable j is a cousin group or 88 and p j is a stein manifold ho 86 note that o p 6 c otherwise p itself would be a cousin group and p would be abelian a contradiction thus p j is a positive dimensional stein manifold with dp j 2 hence p j c c c c or the complex klein bottle consider the following diagram with its induced s sl 2 c orbit fi brations g f j g j p j g p p 1 s s a 1 s s j a 2 s b p 1 4 1 65 note that since dimp j 0 and p j is not compact it follows that df 1 by the fibration lemma since a 1 is a closed abelian subgroup of f lemma 4 3 implies da 1 1 also lemma 4 5 for s sl 2 c implies that ds s 3 we will consider all the possibilities for s j and use the fibration s s s s j in order to derive a contradiction first observe that g j is ka hler in all cases a the one dimensional space p j is equivariantly embeddable in p 1 so g j is an open subset in a homogeneous p 1 bundle over p 1 which is ka hler by a theorem of kodaira kod 54 thus g j is ka hler b if p j c c then lemma 3 3 gives dg j 2 and df 0 in fact f is a compact complex torus see lemma 3 1 since f is a torus by means of integration over this compact fiber bla 56 we can push the ka hler metric down to conclude g j is ka hler now since g j is ka hler any s orbit in g j is ka hler and as a conse quence has algebraic isotropy s j theorem 2 10 the algebraic subgroups of a borel subgroup b in s sl 2 c are up to isomorphism finite sub groups a diag 1 n a a maximal unipotent subgroup u of b and b itself 66 1 dim s j 2 then s j b so ds b 0 see example 3 3 a by lemma 3 3 we have ds s da 1 ds b 1 0 1 3 2 dim s j 1 we consider the fibration 4 1 mentioned above there are two possibilities i s j c then s s j is an affine quadric or the complement of a quadric in p 2 in both cases a 2 c note that p j 6 c so p j c or c c by fibration lemma lemma 3 3 we have df 0 hence f is compact by lemma 4 3 we see that da 1 0 thus a 1 is a torus but this also means s is infinite which is in contradiction with the fact that discrete isotropy group of ka hler manifolds transitive under a semisimple group must be finite see the remark after theorem 2 10 on page 35 ii s j c then s s j is a finite quotient of c 2 0 0 and so a 2 c then p j c c c or c for the first two cases f is compact and we get the same contradiction as in i if p j c then df 1 by fibration lemma hence da 1 1 and a 1 c or a torus in both cases s is infinite which is in contradiction with the fact that s is finite as explained in the previous case 67 3 dim s j 0 and then s j is finite in this case dim s s j dims dim s j 3 and dimg j 3 it then follows that s s j is open in g j note that the only case that dimg j 3 is when it is c c bundle over s p i e dg j 2 lemma 4 4 says this s orbit is also closed thus g j s s j which means ds s j 2 since da 1 df 0 we see that ds s 3 which is a contradiction we conclude that the assumption that there is a proper parabolic sub group ofg which contains yields a contradiction and the lemma follows we now combine the above to prove the main result of this section namely g is solvable in our setting proposition 4 1 let g be a connected complex lie group and a discrete subgroup of g such that x g is a homogeneous ka hler manifold if dx 2 then g is solvable proof first suppose x s is a ka hler manifold where s is a semisimple complex lie group by theorem 2 10 we see that is algebraic and so finite but then dx 3 by lemma 4 5 this is a contradiction to the assumption dx 2 we conclude that g cannot be semisimple and so must have a positive dimensional radical i e dimr 0 68 we prove that g is solvable by induction on the dimension of g clearly if dimcg 3 then the group g is solvable so we assume that the result holds for any connected complex lie group whose dimension is strictly less than n and assume g is a complex lie group with dimcg n we first claim that is not contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of g in order to prove this we assume that is contained in a proper parabolic subgroup ofg and derive a contradiction let p be a maximal such subgroup since p is ka hler dp 2 and dimp n the induction hypothesis implies p is solvable recall that a maximal proper parabolic subgroup of a complex semisimple lie group s is solvable if and only if it is isomorphic to the borel subgroup b in s sl 2 c then p b n r g s n r we are now in the situation of lemma 4 6 which gives us the desired contradiction we conclude that is not contained in a proper parabolic subgroup of g we now have to consider two cases as follows first assume that x has no non constant holomorphic functions i e o x c then lemma 4 2 shows that g is solvable next assume x has non constant holomorphic functions i e o x 6 c 69 under these assumptions the classification given in the main theorem in ag 94 see also theorem 2 5 on page 23 applies and the base g j of the holomorphic reduction g j g j is one of the following 1 an affine cone minus its vertex 2 the affine line c 3 the affine quadric q 2 4 p 2 q where q is a quadric curve or 5 a homogeneous holomorphic c bundle over an affine cone with its vertex removed note that in case 2 the fiber is a torus by lemma 4 1 g is solvable for 3 4 we get fibrations g g j g p p 1 with p a proper parabolic subgroup of g now p gives a contradiction for 1 5 first note that a cone minus its vertex is a c bundle over a flag manifold g p see section 2 4 where p is a parabolic subgroup in g 70 in both cases we get the fibration g j g j g p we cannot have g 6 p i e p a proper parabolic subgroup because then p g which is a contradiction as noted above if g p i e if the base of the second fibration is a point then g j or a 2 1 covering of it is biholomorphic to c or c 2 note that if g j or its 2 1 covering is c 2 the fiber j is a torus by lemma 4 1 it follows that g is solvable if g j c then the fiber j is ka hler and there are two separate cases to consider in 5 this fiber will be compact and we have a torus bundle over c c the result then follows from lemma 4 1 in 1 if dx 2 then dj 1 by the fibration lemma since j has dimension strictly less than the dimension of g it follows by the induction hypothesis that j is solvable but then g is solvable too since g j c so completing the proof 4 2 triviality of torus bundle over c c in subsection 2 1 3 we consider a discrete subgroup of the 3 dimensional heisenberg group g such that the holomorphic reduction of g is a non trivial holomorphic torus bundle over c c the reason the bundle is 71 not even homeomorphic to a product t c 2 is because the fundamental group of the latter is abelian while the fundamental group 1 g is nilpotent and not abelian note that this example is not ka hler in sharp contrast to this we consider in this section homogeneous ka hler solvmanifolds with discrete isotropy which fiber as torus bundles over c c and prove that such x are biholomorphic to the product of the torus and c 2 the structure of the holomorphic reductions of ka hler solvmanifolds has been analyzed in or 88 and go 08 see also theorem 2 8 and theorem 2 9 proposition 4 2 suppose g is a connected simply connected solvable com plex lie group and is a discrete subgroup such that g is ka hler and has holomorphic reduction x g t g j c c y where t j is a compact complex torus then a finite covering of g is biholomorphic to the product t c c proof there are two cases to consider namely either j 0 is normal in g or not if j 0 is normal in g then the group g j 0 is a simply connected 2 dimensional complex lie group up to isomorphism there are two possi bilities the abelian case and the solvable case 72 first assume that the group g j 0 is abelian and let g g j 0 be the projection homomorphism since y contains the real subgroup s 1 s 1 the pullback g 0 1 s 1 s 1 is a real subgroup of g we then have the fibration g t c c g 0 t s 1 s 1 with compact fibers t thus g 0 is compact the triple g g 0 is a ka hler crs manifold see subsection 2 4 3 for definition thus the bundle splits as a product theorem 6 14 2 iii page 189 go 11 next we assume that g j 0 is isomorphic to b the borel subgroup of sl 2 c and we let b denote its lie algebra let g be the lie algebra of g and g j be the lie algebra of g j 0 let g g j 0 be the quotient map and d g b g j its differential by definition the nilradical n is the largest nilpotent ideal in g since the sum of two nilpotent ideal is nilpotent proposition 6 on p 25 in jac 62 n contains every nilpotent ideal in g in particular g and j are in n also d n is a nilpotent ideal in g j b hence it is contained in the nilradical nb of b thus we have j n d 1 nb note that dim j n 2 and 73 dim d 1 nb n 1 but n 6 j since g j is not abelian the quotient by the nilradical is always abelian so n d 1 nb let n be its lie group define n n since n is nilpotent the exponential map exp n n is surjective let n then there is y n such that exp y let u y c be the lie algebra generated by y let u be its lie group then n u j and so n u j 0 note that y j 0 since centralizes j 0 see the proof of theorem 1 in go 08 so n is abelian define u u z and j j 0 which is a full lattice in j 0 it is immediate that n n u u j 0 j since n z we choose so that projects to a generator of n pick any w g n and define a exp sw s c note that a is complementary to n in g and thus g ann let a a and n n so that a n then since and n both centralize j 0 we see that a centralizes j 0 since a a we have exp h a with h sw for some s c note that h j 0 4 2 a fact which we use later since a u is isomorphic to b g j as a vector space we may take e u 74 so that d h d e 2 d e let e 1 en 2 be a basis for j it follows that there are structure con stants ai so that h e 2 e n 2 i 1 aiei the remaining structure constants are 0 due to the fact h j 0 see 4 2 conversely any choice of the ai defines a solvable lie algebra g and the corresponding simply connected group g ann we compute the action of a a on n by conjugation for this note that the adjoint representation restricted to n i e the map adh n n is expressed by the matrix m adh 2 0 0 a 1 0 0 an 2 0 0 so the action of a on n is through the one parameter group of linear trans formations t etm for t c for k 1 tm k 1 2 2 t km 75 and it follows that etm 1 2 e 2 t 1 m id now the projection of the element a acts trivially on the base y g j so t ik where k z hence a acts trivially on u also n acts trivially on n since n is abelian thus acts trivially on n and as a consequence although g is a non abelian solvable group the manifold x g is just the quotient of cn by a discrete additive subgroup of rank 2 n 2 its holomorphic reduction is the original torus bundle which since we are now dealing with the abelian case is trivial assume j 0 is not normal in g and set n ng j 0 let g j n j g n be the normalizer fibration since the base g n of the normalizer fibration is an orbit in some projective space lie s flag theorem applies see section 3 1 and g n is holomorphically separable and thus stein sno 85 since we also have dg n 2 we see that g n c c or c c assume g n c since dx 2 the fibration lemma lemma 3 3 applies and dn j 0 i e n j is biholomorphic to a torus t by grauert theorem g j t c however we assume that g j c c and this gives us a contradiction 76 assume g n c c by chevalley s theorem theorem 13 page 173 che 51 the commutator group g acts algebraically hence the g orbits are closed and one gets the commutator fibration g n c g g n since g is solvable it follows that g is unipotent and the g orbits are cells i e g n n c by the fibration lemma the base of the commutator fibration is a torus but it is proved in ho 81 that the base of a commu tator fibration is always stein which is a contradiction now the only case remaining is when g n c by the fibration lemma lemma 3 3 we get dn j 1 and hence n j c sinceg is simply connected g admits a hochschild mostow hull hm 64 i e there exists a solvable linear algebraic group ga c k ng that contains g as a zariski dense topologically closed normal complex subgroup by passing to a subgroup of finite index we may without loss of generality assume the zariski closure ga of in ga is connected gilligan and oeljeklaus go 08 proved that ga j 0 and that ga is nilpotent let g a ga be the universal covering and set 1 since 77 g a is a simply connected nilpotent complex lie group the exponential map from the lie algebra ga to g a is bijective for any subset of g a and in particular for the subgroup the smallest closed connected complex resp real subgroup g 1 resp g 0 of g a containing is well defined by construction g 0 is compact e g see theorem 2 1 2 4 in raghunathan rag 08 set g 1 g 1 and g 0 g 0 we consider the crs manifold g 1 g 0 see 2 4 3 note that the homogeneous cr manifold g 0 fibers as a t bundle over s 1 s 1 in order to understand the complex structure on the base s 1 s 1 of this fibration consider the following diagram g 0 g 1 g a g 0 g 1 ga t t t s 1 s 1 g 0 g 0 j 0 g 1 j 0 ga j 0 as observed in the proof of part i of theorem 1 in go 08 the manifold ga j 0 is a holomorphically separable solvmanifold and thus is stein ho 86 so g 1 j 0 is also stein and thus g 0 g 0 j 0 is totally real in g 1 j 0 the corresponding complex orbit g 1 j 0 is then biholomorphic to c c 78 it now follows by theorem 6 14 in go 08 that a finite covering of g 1 splits as a product of a torus with c c and in particular that a subgroup of finite index in is abelian now set a exp t t c where g n and n is the lie algebra of n 0 then g ann 0 and any can be written as a n with a a and n n the fiber g g n is the n 0 orbit of the neutral point and acts on it by conjugation since n is ka hler and has two ends it follows by proposition 1 in gor 89 that a finite covering of n is biholomorphic to a product of the torus and c by abuse of language we still call the subgroup having finite index now the bundle g g n is associated to the bundle c g n 0 g n c and thus g c t c where n n 0 aut t c is the adjoint representation since is abelian this implies a acts trivially on n n 0 now suppose j has complex dimension k then a is acting as a linear map on n 0 c n j 0 ck 1 and commutes with the additive subgroup n that has rank 2 k 1 and spans n 0 as a linear space this implies a acts trivially on n 0 and as a consequence the triviality of a finite covering of the bundle as required 79 4 3 main theorem in the following we classify ka hler g when is discrete and dx 2 note that dx 0 means x is compact and this is the classical result of borel remmert theorem 2 19 and the case dx 1 corresponds to x having more than one end and this was handled in gor 89 theorem p 164 the proof will show this equivalence theorem 4 1 let g be a connected complex lie group and a discrete subgroup of g such that x g is ka hler and dx 2 then the group g is solvable and a finite covering of x is a direct product c a where c is a cousin group and a is e c c or c 2 moreover dx dc da proof by proposition 4 1 we only need to consider the case thatg is solvable if there is no non constant holomorphic function on x i e if o x c then x is a cousin group theorem 2 8 on page 34 the case when x is compact dx 0 is theorem 3 1 on page 49 so we assume that o x 6 c i e we have non constant holomorphic functions on x let g c j g j be the holomorphic reduction of g it is known that the base is stein 80 see the theorem on p 58 in ho 86 a finite covering of the bundle is principal theorem 2 9 on page 34 and the fiber is biholomorphic to a cousin group theorem 2 8 on page 34 since g j is stein by the fibration lemma lemma 3 3 on page 57 one can see that dimcg j dg j dx 2 let dx 1 then dg j 1 since g j is stein g j is biholomorphic to c since theorem 2 9 on page 34 states that a finite cover of a ka hler solvmanifold has a holomorphic reduction that is a cousin group principal bundle this means up to some finite cover the structure group of the bundle is a connected complex lie group so the grauert ro hrl theorem theorem 2 4 then states that this finite covering is trivial let dx 2 again by fibration lemma it follows that g j c c c c or a complex klein bottle ag 94 the case of c is handled as above a torus bundle over c is trivial by grauert oka principle theorem 2 3 to be more specific note that since c is continuously contractible to a point we conclude that the bundle is a topologically trivial bundle and hence is holomorphically trivial by theorem 2 3 finally it is enough to discuss the case c c since we discussed the first two cases already and a klein bottle is a 2 1 cover of c c but this is proposition 4 2 the proof of the 81 theorem is now complete as we covered all the possibilities remark 4 1 we list the possibilities that can occur in the theorem 1 suppose dx 0 then x is a torus this corresponds to x compact 2 suppose dx 1 then one of the following holds i x is a cousin group of hypersurface type ii a finite covering of x is t c with t a torus this corresponds to x having two ends see gor 89 3 for dx 2 then one of the following holds i x is a cousin group ii a finite covering of x is a cousin group of hypersurface type times c i e of the form c c where c is a cousin group with dc 1 iii x is a product t c iv a finite covering of x is a product t c 2 remark 4 2 let g be the product of the 3 dimensional heisenberg group and c as noted in example 6 a in or 88 there is a discrete subgroup of g such that g is ka hler and dg 3 no finite covering of its 82 holomorphic reduction splits as a product so d 2 is optimal for the main theorem remark 4 3 the example discussed in subsection 2 1 3 has d 2 but is not ka hler and its holomorphic reduction does not split holomorphically as a product 83 chapter 5 future work 5 1 complete classification let g be a complex lie group and h a closed subgroup such that the homo geneous manifold x g h is ka hler with dx 2 in this dissertation we give a classification of such manifolds when the isotropy h is discrete how ever a classification in the general case is missing we intend to solve the general case where h is not necessarily discrete in chapter 3 we introduced the normalizer and commutator fibrations by fibration lemma lemma 3 3 it is immediate that the base of the normalizer fibration x g h g n 84 has dg n 2 chevalley showed theorem i 3 page 173 che 51 that g g and thus g g is acting as an algebraic group on a projective space hence there is a closed g orbit but we know that g eg thus all g orbits are closed and we can consider the commutator fibration g n g n h g g n the base of the commutator fibration is a positive dimensional abelian stein lie group one has to analyze all the possibilities of the bundle over this stein base 5 2 globalization of holomorphic action letx be a connected compact complex manifold it was proved by bochner montgomery bm 47 proved that the identity component g aut 0 x of the automorphism group of x is a complex lie group acting holomorphically on x assume h is a connected real lie group acting holomorphically on x any h orbit lies inside the corresponding g orbit in fact if h acts tran sitively on x i e if h x x then x g x so a holomorphic transitive action of a real lie group automatically extends to the complex lie group g 85 gilligan and heinzner extended this result to any connected homogeneous complex manifold x with dx 1 which can be thought of as very close to compact homogeneous manifolds gh 98 the situation fails for bigger dx an obvious example of this is an open disk in c which has d 2 for a more interesting example consider the action of h sl 3 r on cp 2 there are two orbits which are rp 2 and its complement x cp 2 rp 2 which has dx 2 no complex lie group acts transitively and holomorphically on x hs 81 analyzing the real group action similar to the methods used in gh 98 and using the classification of x g h where g is linear algebraic homogeneous manifold with dx 2 akh 83 and looking at the real orbits inside the homogeneous manifolds with the methods used in hs 81 we have strong evidence that we can prove unless some special cases like the example above happen any homogeneous manifold x g h which is homogeneous under the holomorphic and transitive action of a lie group g with dx 2 is also homogeneous under the holomorphic and transitive action of the globalization gc of g one of the essential tools we can use is an analogue of the normalizer fibration which was defined for a complex manifold x homogeneous under 86 the transitive holomorphic action of a real lie group g in the nancy band ho 84 the following observations concerning this fibration are essential for our purposes 1 given x g h a homogeneous complex manifold there exists a closed subgroup j of g containing h with j n h 0 but not nec essarily equal such that g j is g equivariantly an orbit in some projective space 2 the orbit g j is open in the corresponding gc orbit where gc denotes the smallest connected complex subgroup of the automorphism group of the projective space that contains g 3 the fiber j h is complex parallelizable 4 the bundle g h g j is a locally trivial holomorphic fiber bundle with structure group the complex lie group j h 0 5 3 the akhiezer question almost thirty years ago akhiezer akh 84 posed a question concerning the existence of analytic hypersurfaces in complex homogeneous manifolds the 87 following variant of his question turns out to be essential for our proof of theorem 4 1 stated above in order to show that the group g is solvable as far as we know there is no general answer to this question but there is enough known in special cases to be useful for our present purposes 5 3 1 modified question of akhiezer suppose g h is a ka hler homogeneous manifold that satisfies a o g h c b there is no proper parabolic subgroup of g that contains h then g h is an abelian complex lie group in particular the group g is solvable in the future we intend to consider other settings where this problem might be solvable 5 4 stein sufficiency conditions suppose g is a connected complex lie group and h is a closed complex subgroup such that x g h is holomorphically separable there are obvious examples where such x are not stein e g x cn 0 for n 1 88 one setting where one might hope that holomorphic separability implies stein for complex homogeneous manifolds would be if the isotropy subgroup is discrete there is however a counterexample to this in oel 92 in this counterexample one has a homogeneous complex manifold y g with dg 4 5 dimcg this violates the homological condition of serre see footnote p 79 in ser 53 for steinness of a complex manifold this suggests that one should impose a further condition suppose x g is holomorphically separable and satisfies the condition dg dimcg again one constructs counterexamples by considering x ck y where y is the complex homogeneous manifold in the previous paragraph as k increases by one the invariant d increases by two and the dimension by one some further type of condition is needed that would prevent such ex amples we will study this question in the setting where g s n r is a mixed group and r is a simply connected nilpotent complex lie group with the property that the smallest connected complex lie subgroup of g that contains r is assumed to be r this can be expanded to include cases where g is algebraic and r is zariski dense in r 89 bibliography
