means of properties of the set of its tangent spaces is proved these tangent spaces form a regular generalised dual arc we prove an extension result for regular generalised dual arcs to motivate our research we show how they are used to construct a large class of secret sharing schemes a typical problem in finite geometry is the study of highly symmetrical substructures for example arcs are configurations of points in pg n q such that each n 1 of them are in general position while n 1 dimensional dual arcs are sets of n 1 spaces such that each two intersect in a point and any three of them are skew these two structures appear naturally in cryptographical applications in this article we define objects called generalised dual arcs a class of objects that contain classical arcs and n 1 dimensional dual arcs as special cases these generalised dual arcs have applications in cryptography as well we give a construction method for a wide class of parameters and prove an extension result for regular generalised dual arcs of order d 1 in sections 1 and 2 we give the necessary definitions constructions and ex amples of applications in cryptography section 3 refers to known classification results and section 4 states our main characterization theorem theorem 13 we now start with the required definitions to make this article self contained 1 definitions and constructions definition 1 a generalised dual arc f of order d with dimensions n n 0 n 1 n 2 nd 1 1 of pg n q is a set of n 1 dimensional subspaces of pg n q such that 1 each j of these subspaces intersect in a subspace of dimension nj 1 j d 1 2 each d 2 of these subspaces have no common intersection we call n n 0 n 1 nd 1 the parameters of the generalised dual arc 1 http arxiv org abs 1309 2008 v 1 definition 2 a generalised dual arc of order d with parameters n n 0 nd 1 is regular if in addition the n 1 dimensional spaces span pg n q and if it satisfies the property that if is the intersection of j elements of f j d then is spanned by the subspaces of dimension nj 1 which are the intersections of with the remaining elements of f construction 1 let pg v be an n dimensional space with basis ei 0 i n let pg w be an n d 1 d 1 1 dimensional space with basis ei 0 id 0 i 0 i 1 id n we now define a multilinear mapping from pg v to pg w in the de scription of this multilinear mapping and in the remainder of this article the vector ei 0 id for 0 i 0 i 1 id n is identical to the vector ei 0 i d where is a permutation of 0 d with 0 i 0 i d n for example e 001 e 010 e 001 all denote the same vector e 001 let v d 1 w be the multilinear mapping n i 0 0 x 0 i 0 ei 0 n id 0 x d id eid 7 0 i 0 id n x 0 i 0 x d id ei 0 id 1 for example x 0 0 e 0 x 0 1 e 1 x 1 0 e 0 x 1 1 e 1 x 0 0 x 1 0 e 0 0 x 0 0 x 1 1 x 0 1 x 1 0 e 0 1 x 0 1 x 1 1 e 1 1 for each point p x of pg v we define a subspace d p of pg w by d p x v 1 vd v 1 vd v 2 theorem 3 5 the set d d p p pg v is a generalised dual arc with dimensions di n d 1 i d 1 i 1 i 0 d 1 for q odd and q n 1 q 1 n d d 1 there is an alternative construction construction 2 we define pg v pg w by n i 0 xiei 7 0 i 0 id n xi 0 xidei 0 id this mapping is a generalisation of the well known quadratic veronesean map see 3 we call it the generalised veronesean with b and b respectively we denote the standard scalar product of v and w i e b n i 0 xiei n i 0 yiei n i 0 xiyi 2 and b 0 i 0 id n xi 0 idei 0 id 0 i 0 id n yi 0 idei 0 id 0 i 0 id n xi 0 idyi 0 id with summations over 0 i 0 id n for each x v we denote by x the subspace of v perpendicular to x with respect to b so x y v b x y 0 then d p z pg w b z y 0 for all y x 3 is a generalised dual arc we will not use construction 2 in this article hence we refer to 5 for a proof that construction 2 gives generalised dual arcs isomorphic to the ones described by construction 1 for the second construction we call the arcs of form d d p p pg v veronesean dual arcs below we give two examples of our general construction example 1 starting with pg 2 q the mapping pg 2 q pg 5 q with x 0 x 1 x 2 x 2 0 x 2 1 x 2 2 x 0 x 1 x 0 x 2 x 1 x 2 defines the quadratic veronesean v 42 if p a b c the planes d p defined above have the equation d p ax 0 bx 1 cx 2 ax 1 bx 0 ax 2 cx 0 bx 2 cx 1 x 0 x 1 x 2 fq these planes form a regular generalised dual arc of q 2 q 1 planes with parameters 5 2 0 example 2 the map pg 2 q pg 9 q with x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 0 x 3 1 x 3 2 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 0 x 2 x 2 1 x 0 x 2 1 x 2 x 2 2 x 0 x 2 2 x 1 x 0 x 1 x 2 defines a cubic veronesean construction 1 associates to each of the q 2 q 1 points a 5 dimensional space in pg 9 q each two of these 5 spaces intersect in a plane each three 5 spaces share a common point and each four 5 spaces are skew 3 three of the q 2 q 1 5 spaces are 0 d 1 0 0 e 0 0 0 e 1 e 2 e 3 0 e 4 0 e 5 ei fq 1 d 0 1 0 0 e 0 0 e 1 0 e 2 e 3 0 e 4 e 5 ei fq 2 d 0 0 1 0 0 e 0 0 e 1 0 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 ei fq in each 5 space the other q 2 q 5 spaces intersect in a configuration of q 2 q planes these planes are a part of the veronesean described in example 1 for 0 the corresponding veronesean has the form v 0 x 2 0 0 0 x 0 x 1 x 0 x 2 x 2 1 0 x 2 2 0 x 1 x 2 this veronesean v 0 has q 2 q 1 tangent planes where q 2 q of the tangent planes are intersections of 0 with the other 5 spaces the extra plane has the form e 0 e 0 0 0 e 1 e 2 0 0 0 0 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 fq similarly we see in 1 the veronesean v 1 0 x 2 1 0 x 2 0 0 x 0 x 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 2 2 x 0 x 2 and the extra plane e 1 0 e 0 0 0 0 e 1 e 2 0 0 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 fq and in 2 we have the veronesean v 2 0 0 x 2 2 0 x 2 0 0 x 2 1 x 0 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 0 x 1 and the extra plane e 2 0 0 e 0 0 0 0 0 e 1 e 2 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 fq generalised dual arcs can be used to construct message authentication codes 5 below we give another application namely secret sharing schemes 2 secret sharing now we will investigate applications of generalised dual arcs in secret sharing schemes for an overview of secret sharing and the links with geometry we refer to 4 a recent overview of different adversary models in secret sharing can be found in 6 we only consider a particular class of secret sharing schemes here which is defined below 4 definition 4 in a k out of n secret sharing scheme a dealer generates n shares s 1 sn and a secret s the shares are given to different participants each k participants can reconstruct the secret with their shares less than k participants cannot reconstruct the share by pi we denote the probability that i k participants may guess that share correctly the probabilities pi are called the attack probabilities if pi 1 pi 1 the system leaks information about the share actually we don t apply generalised dual arcs directly but the dual of these structures which we call generalised arcs definition 5 a generalised arc a of order d with dimensions n 1 n 2 nd 1 of pg n q is a set of n 1 dimensional subspaces of pg n q such that 1 each j of these subspaces generate a subspace of dimension nj 1 j d 1 2 each d 2 of these subspaces span pg n q we call n n 1 nd 1 the parameters of the arc if in addition the common intersection of all nj 1 dimensional subspaces spanned by j 1 elements of the arc containing a given nj dimensional subspace spanned by j elements of the arc is we call the arc regular theorem 6 the dual of an arc with parameters n n 1 nd 1 is a dual arc with param eters n n 1 n 1 n 1 nd 1 and vice versa furthermore the dual arc is regular if and only if the arc is regular proof dualising in pg n q maps every k dimensional subspace onto an n 1 k dimensional subspace dualising exchanges the concepts span and intersection dual to construction 1 we have the following construction of generalised arcs construction 3 as in construction 1 let pg v be an n dimensional space with basis ei 0 i n let pg w be a n d 1 d 1 1 dimensional space with basis ei 0 id 0 i 0 i 1 id n we define pg v pg w by n i 0 xiei 7 0 i 0 id n xi 0 xidei 0 id 5 with b and b respectively we denote the standard scalar product of v and w i e b n i 0 xiei n i 0 yiei n i 0 xiyi and b 0 i 0 id n xi 0 idei 0 id 0 i 0 id n yi 0 idei 0 id 0 i 0 id n xi 0 idyi 0 id for each x v we denote by x the subspace of v perpendicular to x with respect to b so x y v b x y 0 for each point p x of pg v we define a subspace a p of pg w by a p y y x 4 theorem 7 the set a a p p pg n q defined in construction 3 is a generalised arc with parameters ni n d 1 d 1 n d 1 i d 1 i 1 i 1 d 1 the generalised dual arc described in construction 1 is the dual of that arc proof by definition check equation 3 we have d p a p with respect to the bilinear form b since b is a non degenerate form this means that d p is dual to a p thus we may apply theorem 6 which together with theorem 3 shows that a is indeed an arc before we describe the construction of a secret sharing scheme in general we give two examples that use the dual arc with parameters 9 5 2 0 we have seen in example 2 example 3 the dual of the dual arc with parameters 9 5 2 0 is an arc consisting of q 2 q 1 different 3 dimensional spaces in pg 9 q with the following properties 1 each two 3 dimensional spaces generate a 6 space 2 each three 3 dimensional spaces generate an 8 space 3 each four 3 dimensional spaces generate pg 9 q now take the space pg 10 q select any hyperplane as the secret in that hyperplane select the above configuration of q 2 q 1 3 dimensional spaces as shares if the attacker does not have a share he has a probability of q 1 q 11 1 to guess the secret 9 space if the attacker knows only one share he has to guess a 9 space through the known 3 dimensional space so he has a probability of q 1 q 7 1 to guess the secret 6 similarly an attacker that knows 2 or 3 shares has a probability of q 1 q 4 1 or q 1 q 2 1 1 q 1 to guess the share any 4 shares reconstruct the secret example 4 as in the previous example we select a hyperplane in pg 10 q and an arc consisting of q 2 q 1 3 dimensional spaces with the same properties as above one of these 3 dimensional spaces will be the secret the other 3 dimensional spaces are the shares furthermore we select a 4 dimensional space 4 through not contained in and make it public if an attacker wants to find the secret space he has to reconstruct and then the secret space is the intersection 4 a short calculation shows that an attacker who knows i i 4 shares has a probability of q 1 q 5 i 1 to guess the secret another way to vary the attack probabilities is the following recall that the q 2 q 1 different 5 spaces of the dual arc are of the form d p where p is a point of a 2 dimensional space pg 2 q the q 1 different 5 spaces that correspond to the q 1 points of a line of pg 2 q lie in a common 8 space in the dual setting this means that the q 1 corresponding 3 dimensional spaces intersect in a common point so if we fix one such 3 dimensional space it has q 1 different intersection points with the other q 2 q 3 spaces suppose is the image of the point p 0 1 0 0 furthermore let p 1 0 1 0 and p 2 0 0 1 consider lines of the form p 0 ap 1 p 2 and p 0 p 1 then they define q 1 different intersection points forming the twisted cubic arc consisting of the points pa 1 a a 2 a 3 a fq and p 0 0 0 1 choose a plane in which contains no intersection point this is possible since fq x contains an irreducible polynomial of degree 3 now we select this plane as the secret we select a 3 dimensional space 3 through this plane not contained in and make this public an attacker who knows i i 4 shares has attack probabilities p 0 p 1 1 q 3 q 2 q 1 p 2 1 q 2 q 1 and p 3 1 q 1 to guess the secret thus the new scheme leaks no information if only one share is known by selecting the correct subspace of we can also construct schemes that have no information leak for 2 or 3 shares then we must select a line or a point inside as the secret and take a plane 2 or line 1 through the selected line or point not in and make this public now we give two theorems which use generalised arcs to construct secret sharing schemes theorem 8 in pg n 1 q select an n dimensional subspace as the secret in select a generalised arca of order k 2 with n elements and parameters n d 1 dk 1 the elements of a are the shares 7 this describes a k out of n secret sharing scheme with the attack probabili ties pi q 1 qn 1 di 1 for 0 i k formally we set d 0 1 proof every k shares span since a is a generalised arc of order k 2 less than k participants can take their shares 1 i and compute the di dimensional space 1 i they know that must contain that space but for every n dimensional space containing 1 i there exists an arc which has 1 i as elements thus the best attack is to guess an n dimensional space through 1 i the number of such spaces is q n 1 di 1 q 1 theorem 9 in pg n 1 q select a d 1 1 dimensional subspace and make it public in select a d 1 dimensional subspace as the secret choose any hyperplane of pg n 1 q that contains but not let a be a generalised dual arc of of order k 2 with n 1 elements and parameters n d 1 dk 1 the subspace should be an element of a the n elements of a different from are the shares this describes a k out of n secret sharing scheme with the attack probabili ties pi q 1 qdi 1 di 1 1 for 0 i k 1 formally we set d 0 1 and dk n proof every k shares span since a is a generalised arc of order k 2 thus k participants can compute which is the secret less than k participants can take their shares 1 i and compute the di dimensional space 1 i since the secret is also an element of the arc a we find that 1 i has dimension di 1 this means that dim 1 i di d 1 di 1 since by construction we also have dim 1 i di d 1 di 1 the i participants know that is a d 1 dimensional subspace of containing the di d 1 di 1 dimensional subspace 1 i but for every d 1 dimensional subspace through 1 i in there exists a generalised arc containing 1 i and so the i participants have no further information and must guess a d 1 dimensional subspace of through 1 i the probability for guessing this correctly is pi q 1 qdi 1 di 1 1 8 3 known results in 1947 bose studied ovals in 1 in that paper he proved that an oval in pg 2 q has at most q 1 points if q is odd and at most q 2 points if q is even special cases of generalised dual arcs have a long history a generalised dual arc of order 0 is just a partial spread of pg n q the generalised dual arc of order n 1 in pg n q with parameters n n 1 1 0 is just the dual of an ordinary arc of points in pg n q generalised dual arcs of order 1 with n 2 0 are known as n 1 dimensional dual arcs it is known that the dimension n of the ambient space pg n q of an n 1 dimensional dual arc satisfies 2 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 n 1 3 see 9 definition 10 a family a of q l 1 1 q 1 1 l dimensional subspaces of pg n q with n 2 is called an l dimensional dual hyperoval if it satisfies the following three axioms every two elements of a intersect in a point every three elements of a have no point in their intersection all members of a span the whole space pg n q the next theorem is the translation to veronesean dual arcs of the well known fact that ovals in pg 2 q q odd are maximal but ovals in pg 2 q q even can be extended to hyperovals see also 9 theorem 11 for q odd the veronesean dual arc is maximal while for q even the veronesean dual arc can be extended by an n 1 dimensional space to an n 1 dimensional dual hyperoval the extension element is called the nucleus proof in every arc element d x 0 xn 1 there is only one point not covered by a second arc element this point is x 0 xn 1 x 2 0 x 2 n 1 2 x 0 x 1 2 xn 1 1 xn 1 where is the veronesean map for odd q these points x 0 xn 1 span pg 1 2 n 1 n 1 3 q i e the veronesean dual arc is not extendable for q even they form an n 1 dimensional space which extends the veronesean dual arc this space is called the nucleus in 1958 tallini 7 see also 3 showed that every 2 dimensional dual arc of q 2 q 1 elements in pg 5 q q odd must be isomorphic to the dual arc defined by construction 1 this result was generalised in 8 to the following characterization of the finite quadric veronesean v 2 n n 9 result 12 let f be a set of q n 1 1 q 1 n dimensional spaces in pg n n 3 2 q with the fol lowing properties vs 1 each two elements of f intersect in a point vs 2 each three elements of f are skew vs 3 the elements of f span pg n n 3 2 q vs 4 any proper subspace of pg n n 3 2 q that is spanned by a collection of ele ments of f is a subspace of dimension i 2 n i 3 2 1 for some i 0 n vs 5 if q is even at least one space spanned by two elements of f contains more than two elements of f then either f is a veronesean dual arc with respect to a quadric veronesean v 2 n n or q is even and there are two members 1 2 f such that the 2 n dimensional space 1 2 only contains 2 elements of f and there is a unique subspace of dimension n such that f is a veronesean dual arc with the nucleus space as constructed in theorem 11 in particular if n 2 then the statement holds under the weaker hypotheses of f satisfying v s 1 v s 2 v s 3 and v s 5 for order d 1 and q even there are non veronesean dual arcs with the property that every space spanned by two elements of f contains exactly these two elements of f for n 2 one can classify all examples that do not satisfy v s 5 by a result of 2 the only possibilities are for q 2 and q 4 this classification remains open for n 3 although an infinite class of examples is known described in 8 4 the case d 1 we prove that for 0 small a dual arc with parameters n 0 n 1 n 2 of size q n 1 1 q 1 is not maximal the proof techniques are similar to the techniques used in 3 to give an algebraic characterisation of a dual arc of size q n 1 1 q 1 the main difference is that the deficiency makes simple counting arguments impossible so we have to use more difficult structural arguments theorem 13 assume that q 7 2 for q odd and q 8 2 for q even and let f be a set of q n 1 1 q 1 different n dimensional spaces in pg n n 3 2 q with the following properties 1 each two elements of f intersect in a point 2 each three elements of f are skew 10 3 the elements of f span pg n n 3 2 q 4 any proper subspace of pg n n 3 2 q that is spanned by a collection of ele ments of f is a subspace of dimension i 2 n i 3 2 1 for some i 0 n 5 if q is even at least one space spanned by two elements of f contains more than two elements of f then f is extendable to a regular generalised dual arc of size q n 1 1 q 1 in the case q even this dual arc of size q n 1 1 q 1 is even extendable to a dual hyperoval the idea of the proof is in the same spirit as the proof of result 12 so the proofs of some results describing the general structure will look very similar as the ones used for that result the main work lies in the lemmata which actually deal with the deficiency itself where we have to reconstruct the missing elements definition 14 a contact point is a point belonging to at most one element of f property 4 seems very technical our next lemma shows that for large q property 4 is no restriction this motivates property 4 lemma 15 let q n then any configuration f which satisfies the properties 1 3 also satisfies property 4 proof assume that the claim of the lemma is wrong i e there exists a sequence 0 k of elements in f with the property j 0 j for j k dim j j 1 2 n j 2 2 1 for j k k 2 n k 3 2 1 dim k k 1 2 n k 2 2 1 by induction we will construct a sequence k 1 n 1 of members of f with the properties i the subspace defined recursively by i i 1 i has at least an i dimensional subspace in common with i 1 ii the space i 1 is not contained in i for i n these two conditions yield a contradiction because the elements of f have dimension n this proves the lemma 11 now we construct j 1 from the sequence 0 j note that dim j is bounded by dim k n k n j 1 k 1 2 n k 2 2 2 j k 2 n k j 1 2 n n 3 2 1 thus j is not the whole space by property 3 we know that there exists a space j 1 of f not in j there are at least q n 1 elements of f meeting j 1 in a point outside of j thus there are at least q n elements of f not in j since i 1 has at most an n 1 dimensional space in common with i i k we conclude that at most q n 1 q 1 elements of f intersect i 1 in a point of i thus for at most j q n 1 q 1 elements of f there exists an i j such that this element intersects i 1 in a point of i because k n q qn k qn 1 q 1 0 implying that there is an element j 1 of f with the property that j 1 is not in j and j 1 i 1 i especially we have dim j 1 i 1 1 i j j i e j 1 j is at least a j dimensional space thus by induction we have found the members of f with the properties i and ii which proves the lemma property 4 allows us to compute the dimensions of many objects related to f an important special case is the following result remark let be a 2 n dimensional space spanned by two elements of f then an element of f either lies inside or intersects in a line the next lemma gives us an upper bound on the number of elements of f contained in a space having one of the dimensions mentioned in property 4 lemma 16 every i 2 n i 3 2 1 dimensional space contains at most q i 1 q 1 elements of f proof let be an i 2 n i 3 2 1 dimensional space spanned by i elements 1 i of f an element of f not contained in intersects in an i 1 dimensional space i this is part of property 4 each element of f contained in must share a point with i furthermore no two elements of f in intersect i in the same point so contains at most q i 1 q 1 elements of f to understand the goal of the next lemma consider the dual arc obtained by construction 1 in this example every element of f corresponds to a point of a projective space pg n q the 2 n dimensional spaces spanned by two elements of f correspond to the lines of pg n q thus if a dual arc with q n 1 1 q 1 12 elements is a subset of this example then the following is true every 2 n dimensional space spanned by two elements of f contains at least q 1 elements of f lemma 17 is the first step in that direction lemma 17 every 2 n dimensional space contains 0 1 2 or at least q q 7 2 for q odd and q 8 2 for q even elements of f if q is odd no 2 n dimensional space contains exactly 2 elements of f proof let be a 2 n dimensional space which contains k elements of f where 2 k q let be any element of f not contained in this element intersects in a line l by the remark after lemma 15 at least q points of l must be covered by a second element of f since q k 0 there must be a second element of f not contained in which intersects l let l the lines l and l span a plane since every one of the k elements of f in must intersect and these k elements intersect and in a point on l respectively on l different from l l hence they intersect in lines assume that is another element of f not contained in that intersects in l we prove that if l has a point in common with l then it has also a point in common with l suppose that l intersects l if l does not intersect l then every element of f contained in must share a line with the plane spanned by l and l and has a point in common with l thus these elements share a plane with the 3 dimensional space spanned by l l and l especially two of these elements intersect each other in a line a contradiction this proves that the elements of f not contained in can be partitioned into groups the elements from one group intersect each other in and el ements from different groups intersect each other outside of each group defines a plane inside and the k elements of f contained in must intersect such a plane in lines let 1 and 2 be two planes inside defined by such groups we distinguish several cases for the intersection 1 2 1 the planes 1 and 2 cannot be skew to each other otherwise they would span a 5 dimensional space now every element of f in shares a line with 1 and 2 so shares at least a 3 dimensional space with but then the elements of f in intersect each other in at least a line which is false 2 if 1 and 2 intersect in a line then at most one element of f contained in contains the line 1 2 so at least k 1 elements of f contained in must share a plane with the 3 dimensional space spanned by 1 and 2 thus each two of these elements must share a line a contradiction for k 2 we now eliminate the case k 2 where one of the two elements of f in for instance passes through the line 1 2 13 for k 2 all groups have size at least q 1 for consider a first element of f not in then consider the line this line has at most 1 contact points so it is intersected in a point by at least q 2 elements of f not lying in this shows that a group of elements of f not lying in has at least size q 1 but now consider the line 1 2 lying in an element of f in and in the two planes 1 and 2 containing at least q 1 lines lying in elements of f not contained in since no point of lies in three elements of f and every point of already lies in the element of f we must have q 1 2 q 1 1 where the 1 arises from the second element of f in this implies q 2 2 a contradiction 3 thus 1 and 2 intersect in a point q but then the only possibility for an element of f contained in to intersect 1 and 2 in lines is that q is a point of that element thus all elements of f contained in contain q since every three elements of f are skew this means that k 2 assume now that we are in the case k 2 and q is odd since there are q n 1 1 q 1 2 elements of f not contained in and since for odd q a dual arc of lines in pg 2 q contains at most q 1 elements each group can contain at most q 1 elements so there are at least 1 q 1 qn 1 1 q 1 2 qn 1 q 1 different groups each group defines a plane through q which intersects an element of f contained in in a line since an n dimensional space only contains q n 1 q 1 different lines through q there must exist two groups which define planes 1 and 2 intersecting in a line but this is impossible as we already proved so the case k 2 is only possible for q even even if we could not exclude the case k 2 for q even we have proven in step 3 the following characterisation corollary 18 let q be even and let be a 2 n space that contains only and as elements of f then the elements of f intersect in groups of pairwise intersecting lines furthermore there can be at most q n 1 q 1 such groups we call a 2 n dimensional space big if it contains at least q elements of f the next lemma associates with each big 2 n dimensional space a plane which will be very important in the remaining part of this section lemma 19 let be a 2 n dimensional space containing q 1 i q elements of f then contains a plane which intersects the q 1 i elements of f in in lines the elements of f not in intersect in a line these lines either lie in or they are skew to and then contain i contact points moreover those 14 latter lines skew to which are the intersection of with an element of f not lying in are pairwise disjoint proof assume that two elements 1 and 2 of f not in intersect in two intersecting lines 1 and 2 let be the plane spanned by 1 and 2 we are not in the case which is assumed in the beginning of the proof of lemma 17 however the same kind of arguments as the ones used in the proof of lemma 17 show that 1 every line in that intersects and that comes from an element of f not in must lie in 2 every element of f in must intersect in a line 3 the lines in that come from an element of f not in and that do not lie in must be pairwise disjoint property 3 is proven in the following way otherwise we have two planes 1 and 2 corresponding with two different groups of lines as in the proof of lemma 17 we have shown in the proof of lemma 17 that 1 and 2 must intersect in a point q which lies on every element of f in but this implies that has only 2 elements of f which is not the case so from now on we may assume that all the elements of f not in intersect in pairwise disjoint lines now we construct the plane let 1 2 and 3 be three elements of f in let q 12 1 2 q 13 1 3 and q 23 2 3 the points q 12 q 13 q 23 generate a plane since otherwise 1 2 3 share a line assume that an element of f not in intersects in a line that meets we claim that must lie in suppose the contrary without loss of generality we may assume that 1 2 but then 1 and 2 share a plane with the 3 dimensional space i e they share a line a contradiction at most one line in that comes from an element of f not in lies in since these lines are pairwise disjoint since every element of f has only 1 contact points this proves that at least q 1 points of q 12 q 13 lie in an element of f in different from 1 assume that there exists an element of f in which intersects 1 in a point q not on q 12 q 13 the above arguments show that q 12 q 13 qq 12 and qq 13 must contain at least 3 q 1 3 q 1 points in 1 which lie on two elements of f inside a contradiction with lemma 16 thus every element of f in meets q 12 q 13 q 12 q 23 and q 13 q 23 i e it has a line in common with the next series of lemmas deal with the case q even and k 2 let us again have a look at the example that comes from construction 1 in this example every 2 n dimensional space containing at least one element of f contains either 1 or q 1 elements of f if q is even we can extend the dual arc of size q n 1 1 q 1 by one element this element has the special property that for all other 15 elements f the 2 n space contains no other element of f see 8 we call this element the nucleus of f we will prove in lemma 22 that this property holds for every regular gen eralised dual arc for q even lemma 20 let q be even and let f be such that the 2 n dimensional space contains no other element of f let q let be a big 2 n dimensional space containing and let be the plane inside described by lemma 19 then q proof let f let q as we have already seen in corollary 18 this gives us a group of intersecting lines in this plane but lemma 19 states that the only plane in which contains a group of intersecting lines is i e lemma 21 let q be even for each f either all 2 n dimensional spaces with 6 f contain exactly two elements of f or there exists at most one element 6 f such that contains exactly two elements of f proof assume that lies in a big 2 n dimensional space and let be the plane described by lemma 19 and let be the line by lemma 20 we know that an element of f for which contains no other element of f must intersect in a point of since has only q 1 points and f q n 1 1 q 1 this means that must lie in more than one big 2 n space but then we have a second line and every element of f for which contains no other element of f must intersect in a point of and are different since must meet the q elements of f in must meet the q elements of f in and 2 q 2 2 q 1 see also step 2 of lemma 17 this proves the lemma lemma 22 let q be even and assume that there exists a 2 n dimensional space which contains exactly two elements of f then there exists at most one element f such that for every 6 f the 2 n space contains exactly two elements of f proof let assume that both elements and lie in a big 2 n dimensional space then all other elements of f generate with and respec tively a big 2 n dimensional space lemma 21 let be such an element and 0 with the special plane 0 and 1 with the special plane 1 by the proof of lemma 20 we know that 0 1 but this is a contradiction since this plane cannot contain 2 q 1 q 2 different lines coming from elements of f in 0 and 1 thus either or does not lie in big 2 n dimensional spaces they cannot both lie only in 2 n spaces which contain 2 elements of f or else by condition 5 of theorem 13 which 16 we assume to be valid for f we find a f lying in at least one big 2 n space and in two 2 n spaces with only two elements of f a contradiction with lemma 21 if q is even and the special element from lemma 22 exists we simply remove it from f this increases the deficiency by 1 remark thus from now on we assume that a 2 n space cannot contain 2 elements of f and that q 6 2 when q is even and q 7 2 when q is odd our next goal is a stronger version of lemma 19 which states that an element of f not in a big 2 n space must be skew to the plane we will reach this goal with lemma 28 lemma 23 let 1 2 and 3 be distinct 2 n dimensional spaces containing at least q elements of f then dim 1 2 3 n proof by property 4 we know that dim 1 2 n 1 assume that 1 2 3 is an n 1 dimensional space since two elements of f span a 2 n dimensional space the space contains at most one element of f and the other elements of f in i intersect in a line let be such a line in that comes from an element of f in 1 the elements in 2 and 3 intersect in a point since 2 q 1 q 1 some point of lies on an element of f in 1 2 and 3 a contradiction since each point lies on at most 2 elements of f in the case of construction 1 we know that the big 2 n dimensional spaces correspond to the lines of an n dimensional projective space pg n q thus in that case every element of f lies in exactly q n 1 q 1 big 2 n spaces now we can prove this for a regular generalised dual arc lemma 24 let f consider all 2 n dimensional spaces through containing at least q elements of f then the planes of these 2 n spaces intersect in different lines through a common point moreover there are exactly q n 1 q 1 different big 2 n spaces through proof let and be two different 2 n spaces through and let and be the corresponding planes defined by lemma 19 by lemma 19 we know that and are lines these lines must be different since otherwise would contain at least 2 q 1 q 1 points lying on and on another element of f by the proof of lemma 19 we know that at most 2 elements of f not in intersect in lines contained in the other elements intersect in pairwise skew lines thus contains at least q 2 3 3 elements of f that 17 intersect in pairwise skew lines we call this set of lines l 1 by symmetry we know that contains at least q 2 3 3 elements of f that intersect in pairwise skew lines we call this set of lines l 2 each line in l 1 must intersect each line of l 2 in the intersection point of the corresponding elements of f thus l 1 and l 2 are the lines of two opposite reguli of a hyperbolic quadric q 3 q by lemma 19 we know that every element of f in has a line in common with thus the line intersects all lines of l 1 i e it lies in the regulus defined by l 2 by symmetry lies in the regulus defined by l 1 thus and intersect in addition we see that every element of different from must lie in the regulus defined by l 1 i e all elements of intersect in pairwise skew lines not in thus the first case in lemma 19 cannot occur especially the intersection point of and must be a contact point since it can lie only in elements of f that lie in the intersection this proves that either the lines of the form share a common point or they lie in a common plane since they pairwise share a point but the lines of the form must additionally cover all non contact points in and intersect only in contact points thus the lines of the form share a common contact point and there are at most q n 1 q 1 lines of the form that there are at least that many such lines follows from the fact that each big 2 n space contains at most q 1 elements of f and hence is contained in at least q n 1 1 q 1 1 q q n 1 q 1 1 big 2 n spaces remark we note that in this proof we encounter the strongest condition on namely q 2 3 3 equivalently q 6 2 for d 1 an important consequence of lemma 24 is the following result corollary 25 let 1 qn 1 q 1 be the big 2 n spaces containing a given element of f let the space i contain q 1 i elements of f then q n 1 q 1 i 1 i especially most big 2 n dimensional spaces through contain q 1 elements of f moreover each 2 n space contains at least q 1 elements of f proof we already know that every 2 n space containing more than two ele ments of f contains q 1 i q elements of f lemma 17 since q n 1 q 1 i 1 i necessarily i so we can conclude that every 2 n space containing more than two elements of f contains q 1 i q 1 elements of f the next lemma allows us to reduce the case of an n n 3 2 n 0 arc to the case of a 5 2 0 arc lemma 26 let be a 3 n 1 space spanned by three elements of f let f be the set of elements of f in 18 for every in f define 6 f for every in f the space is a plane and these planes form a dual arc in 5 dimensions proof for each element in f we define a linear space l with the following properties i the points of the linear space are the points with 6 f ii the lines of the linear space are the lines of through two points of the form and 6 6 f if is not contained in the 2 n dimensional space spanned by and then it intersects in a line containing and in fact this line contains at least q elements of the form with 6 f lemma 17 if is contained in the 2 n space then and lie on the intersection line of with the plane of lemma 19 which contains at least q 1 intersection points of with other planes of f the number of points in l is at least 3 q 1 3 lemma 17 and at most q 2 q 1 lemma 16 if p 0 p 1 and p 2 are three non collinear points of the linear space then p 0 p 1 contains at least q 1 intersection points of two elements of f and thus there are at least q 1 lines through p 2 and therefore at least q 1 q 2 1 intersection points in the plane p 0 p 1 p 2 by the same arguments four points p 0 p 1 p 2 and p 3 of the linear space l that do not lie in a plane would imply that the linear space l contains at least q 2 q 1 q 2 1 1 points but this is not possible since the number of points in l is bounded by q 2 q 1 thus 6 f is a plane it remains to be proven that the planes span a 5 space their span has at most dimension 5 as we know from 9 assume that they only span a 4 space then the three elements of f that span would have a plane in common with this 4 dimensional space this would imply that has at most dimension 4 3 n 2 3 n 2 but this is false corollary 27 every big 2 n space lies in exactly q n 1 1 q 1 different 3 n 1 spaces spanned by three elements of f proof every big 2 n space through corresponds to a line and all these lines go through a common point q a 3 n 1 space defined by three elements of f through corresponds to the lines in one plane through q inside by 19 lemma 26 thus the 3 n 1 spaces defined by three elements of f through correspond to planes inside through there are exactly q n 1 1 q 1 such planes now we are able to improve the result of lemma 19 lemma 28 with the notations of lemma 19 the following result holds no element of f not in intersects proof we know from the preceding lemma that shares a line with every element of f in passing through a fixed contact point of assume that contains an extra line from an element of f not contained in let r the elements and define a big 2 n dimensional space and contains a plane the intersection is a line which containsr and the fixed contact point thus a contradiction thus contains no line that comes from an element of f not in elements of f inside intersect in a dual arc of q 1 i lines remark if contains lines of contact points these lines extend the dual arc of q 1 i lines induced by the elements of f in for i 1 and q odd we find one line of contact points and for i 1 and q even we find two lines of contact points now we are reaching our final goal to prove that f is not maximal as a first step we prove that the planes contain lines of contact points lemma 29 let 1 and 2 be two big 2 n spaces with the property that 1 2 is a 3 n 1 dimensional space assume that 1 and 2 share no element of f let 1 and 2 be the planes in 1 and 2 which exist by lemmas 19 and 28 then 1 2 is a line of contact points proof first of all it is impossible that the plane 1 is contained in 2 for assume the contrary we obtain a contradiction in the following way every element of f in 1 intersects 2 in a line if 1 lies completely in 2 then the intersection line 2 equals the line 1 this line contains at least q 1 points lying in two elements of f in 1 but the q 1 2 elements of f in 2 must intersect in a point so at least q 1 2 points of still lie in an element of f in 2 then there are points of lying in three elements of f this is false note that the plane 1 lies in the 5 space 1 1 spanned by the planes defined in lemma 26 then 2 cannot contain 1 since otherwise every element of f would intersect 2 at least in a plane contradicting the remark after lemma 15 thus 2 1 is a 4 dimensional space spanned by two planes and corresponding to elements and of f in 2 the plane 1 lies in the 20 5 dimensional space 1 and thus it intersects the 4 dimensional space 2 1 and therefore 2 in at least a line consider again the intersection line 2 of an element of f in 1 with 2 this line contains q 1 2 points lying on an element of f in 2 and 2 contact points lemma 19 and lemma 28 so the points of do not lie in an other element of f in 1 now and 1 intersect in a point since both lines lie in the plane defined by lemma 26 this point must be a contact point for else it lies in a second plane of f in 1 but this was excluded in the preceding paragraph so shares a contact point with 2 which also lies on the intersection line of 2 with 1 this proves that the line 1 2 intersects the dual arc in 1 consisting of lines of the form 1 where is an element of f in 1 only in contact points i e 1 2 only contains points covered by at most one element of f this proves the theorem lemma 30 let 1 and 2 be two big 2 n dimensional spaces with the property that 1 2 is a 3 n 1 space assume that 1 and 2 share no element of f and let q 1 1 be the number of elements of f in 1 and let q 1 2 be the number of elements of f in 2 let 1 and 2 be the planes in 1 and 2 which exist by lemma 19 then the lines l 1 2 1 1 2 1 f 1 1 and l 2 1 2 2 1 2 f 2 2 are lines of two opposite reguli of a hyperbolic quadric q 3 q especially this implies that 1 0 and 2 0 since a regulus has only q 1 lines and that 2 1 and 1 2 are concurrent proof by lemma 28 we know that the elements of f in 1 intersect 2 in pairwise skew lines thus l 1 1 2 1 f 1 1 and l 2 2 1 2 f 2 2 are sets of pairwise skew lines since 1 2 1 2 every line of l 1 intersects every line of l 2 since both sets contain more than 2 lines it follows that the lines of l 1 and l 2 are lines of opposite reguli now consider the line 2 1 which exists by lemma 29 by lemma 28 the plane 2 is skew to all elements of f in 1 thus 2 1 is different from all lines in l 1 but every element 2 of f contained in 2 has a line in common with 2 thus 2 1 intersects all lines of l 2 this proves that l 1 2 1 l 1 are the lines of a regulus by symmetry the same is true for l 2 recall that the final goal is to prove that f is given by construction 1 thus every element of f should correspond to a point of pg n q since f has only q n 1 1 q 1 elements points of pg n q are not used in construction 1 the next lemma will identify these holes 21 consider the linear space l with the elements of f as points and the 2 n spaces generated by two elements of f as lines this is a linear space with q n 1 1 q 1 points as planes of l we define the 3 n 1 dimensional spaces generated by three elements of f lemma 31 every plane of l is a projective plane of order q with possibly some holes proof let p be a 3 n 1 dimensional space generated by three elements of f let p be a 2 n dimensional space that contains q 1 elements of f this 2 n space exists since there are q 1 different big 2 n dimensional spaces through an element of f in p and at most of them contain less than q 1 elements of f corollary 25 let be an other big 2 n dimensional space in p by lemma 30 we know that and share an element of f let 1 and 2 be two big 2 n dimensional spaces in p let be an element of f in 1 but not in 2 since 2 contains at least q 1 elements of f there must be at least q 1 big 2 n dimensional spaces in p through at most of the q n 1 q 1 different big 2 n dimensional spaces through contain less than q 1 elements of f corollary 25 each of the at least q 1 elements of 2 spans together with a big 2 n dimensional space in p thus there are at least q 1 2 2 big 2 n spaces in p through which contain exactly q 1 elements of f we denote these 2 n dimensional spaces by 1 and 2 by the same arguments we find an additional 2 n dimensional space 3 which contains q 1 elements of f and which intersects 1 and 2 in different elements of f thus that plane p of l contains a triangle 1 2 3 and each side of the triangle contains q 1 points of l every other big 2 n dimensional space in p intersects 1 2 and 3 in elements of f lemma 30 thus a direct counting argument shows us that p contains q 1 2 3 q 1 3 q 2 q 1 lines of l where q 1 2 is the number of lines intersecting the side of the triangle in different points 3 q 1 is the number of lines through a vertex different from the sides and 3 is the number of sides of the triangle the number of elements of f in p is at most q 2 q 1 by lemma 16 and at least q 2 q 1 by corollary 25 now consider any line of p with q 1 x points x 1 then q q 1 x lines intersect and thus there are xq lines skew to every point not on lies on x lines that do not intersect thus there must exist a point not on that lies on a line disjoint to with at least q 2 q 1 q 1 x x qx q 1 points by lemma 30 has q points as we have seen above there are q lines of p skew to and every point not on lies on such a line we may extend l by a point that lies on and all lines skew to extending l stepwise by at most points we obtain a 2 q 2 q 1 q 1 1 design i e a projective plane of order q 22 lemma 32 let f be a dual arc that satisfies the assumptions of theorem 13 let 0 then f is not maximal proof since 0 we find a big 2 n space which contains less than q 1 elements of f corollary 25 every 3 n 1 dimensional space spanned by three elements of f through such a 2 n space contains less than q 2 q 1 elements of f let p be such a 3 n 1 space select a 2 n space in p that contains exactly q elements of f such a space exists because by lemma 31 the linear space l is a projective plane with at most holes and such linear spaces contain lines with exactly q points consider the 3 n 1 spaces through generated by three elements of f by lemma 31 these 3 n 1 spaces define projective planes with holes we will call a big 2 n space parallel to if it goes through the unique hole of in the corresponding projective plane defined by lemma 31 the 2 n spaces parallel to partition the set f by corollary 27 we know that every big 2 n space lies in q n 1 1 q 1 different 3 n 1 spaces spanned by three elements of f thus there are exactly q qn 1 1 q 1 1 qn 1 q 1 2 n spaces parallel to including itself consider two big 2 n spaces 1 and 2 parallel to if 2 6 1 then 1 2 is a 4 n 3 dimensional space property 4 since 2 n dim 1 2 dim 1 2 4 n 3 property 4 implies that dim 1 2 3 n 1 thus any two elements in the parallel class satisfy the conditions of lemma 29 and lemma 30 i e they lie in a 3 n 1 space let q be odd choose any 2 n space parallel to which contains exactly q elements of f by a direct counting argument we find that at least q n 1 q 1 1 of the q n 1 q 1 elements in the parallel class have this property then by lemma 28 the plane of contains exactly one line of contact points by lemma 29 these lines must lie in the common intersection of all 2 n spaces parallel to thus contains q n 1 q 1 1 lines of contact points that share a common point q lemma 30 this proves that is an n dimensional space it cannot be bigger by lemma 23 now look at any big 2 n space parallel to containing q 1 i elements of f by lemma 29 and lemma 30 the plane must share a line through q with every other 2 n space parallel to this line must lie in since otherwise would need different lines for each 2 n space thus contains q n 1 q 1 lines of contact points through q i e it only contains contact points and we can extend f by for q even the situation is more complicated we have always two lines of contact points and we must choose the correct one let 1 be a 2 n space which contains exactly q elements of f by lemma 29 the plane 1 of 1 must share a line of contact points with each 2 n space parallel to 1 by the pigeon hole principle there are at least 1 2 q n 1 q 1 different 2 n spaces parallel to 1 which 23 contain q elements of f and which intersect 1 in the same line 1 of contact points let 2 and 3 be two such spaces choose 2 and 3 such that dim 1 2 3 n for n 2 this is always the case since the intersection of three 4 spaces in a 5 space is at least a plane and since lemma 23 states that dim 1 2 3 2 for n 2 we can choose 2 and 3 such that dim 1 2 3 4 n 3 and then we obtain dim 1 2 3 n by the dimension formula let 2 be the line 2 1 consider the hyperbolic quadric with the two reguli l 1 2 1 1 2 1 f 1 1 and l 2 1 2 2 1 2 f 2 2 see lemma 30 then 3 contains the line 1 1 2 of this hyperbolic quadric since 1 shares the same line of 1 with 2 and 3 hence 3 must contain a second line of this hyperbolic quadric we prove this as follows we know that dim 1 2 n 1 and that dim 1 2 3 n the hyperbolic quadric l 1 l 2 cannot lie in 1 2 3 or else every space 1 f of 1 shares the same line with 2 and 3 then some points of this line necessarily lie on three elements of f false so 1 2 3 intersects the solid containing the hyperbolic quadric l 1 l 2 in a plane this plane contains already one line 1 of this hyperbolic quadric l 1 l 2 so it contains a second line of l 1 l 2 but for each 1 1 we find that the line 1 2 cannot lie in 3 since otherwise 1 2 would meet q elements of f in 2 and q elements of f in 3 a contradiction thus 2 2 1 must be the second line of the hyperbolic quadric in 3 by symmetry we also find that 3 intersects 1 and 2 in the same line applying this argument for all the 1 2 q n 1 q 1 1 different parallel spaces found in the first step we obtain a space in the common intersection which contains 1 2 q n 1 q 1 1 different lines of contact points this proves that must have dimension n and we can copy the final steps of the case q odd to prove that contains only contact points concluding arguments applying lemma 32 precisely times we find that f can be extended to a dual arc f of size q n 1 1 q 1 even in the case q even no 2 n dimensional space contains exactly 2 elements of f by result 12 this implies that f is the dual arc given by construction 1 as we know from theorem 11 in the case q even this dual arc can be extended by one extra element acknowledgements the authors profoundly like to
