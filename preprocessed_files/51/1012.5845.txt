with a fixed point set of codimension k the conjugacy class of such an involution denoted sk generates mo b n the the group of isometries of hyperbolic n space if k is odd and its orientation preserving subgroup if k is even in this paper we supply effective lower and upper bounds for the sk word length of mo b n if k is odd and the sk word length of mo b n if k is even as a consequence for a fixed codimension k the length of mo b n with respect to sk k even grows linearly with n with the same state ment holding in the odd case moreover the percentage of involution conjugacy classes for which mo b n has length two approaches zero as n approaches infinity 1 introduction and results let g be a group and s a set of symmetric generators for a supergroup of g s is not necessarily a subset of g but every element can be written as a product of elements from s for g g the length of g with respect to s or s length is the minimal number of elements of s needed to express g as their product the supremum over all group element lengths is called the length of g with respect to s or simply the s length of g and is denoted g we are interested in the set sk mo b n of involutions with a codimen sion k fixed point set acting on hyperbolic space hn supported in part by psc cuny grant 627 14 00 40 the author is indebted to his advisor jane gilman and would like to thank rutgers newark

is even sk generates mo b n and satisfies n n 1 2 k n k 1 mo b n k 2 n 4 1 if k is odd sk generates mo b n and satisfies n n 1 2 k n k 1 mo b n k 2 n 2 k 2 where k denotes sk length in particular we have corollary 1 2 linear growth for a fixed codimension k if k is even mo b n k n if k is odd mo b n k n our main tool is a dimension count which yields the fact that the set of elements of the form 1 m where i is a k involution and m n n 1 2 k n k 1 has measure zero in mo b n see theorem 4 1 and corollary 2 2 we next consider the percentage of involution conjugacy classes for which mo b n 2 more precisely define n k the sk length of mo b n is 2 involution conjugacy classes in dimension n 3 recall that the conjugacy class of an involution is determined by the dimension of its totally geodesic fixed point set thus a k involution determines a conjugacy class and the denominator above is n setting mo b n 2 and using the lower bound in inequality 13 after a straight forward computation to find bounds on k in terms of n we have corollary 1 3 n o n 1 2 in the paper 1 the authors show that in each dimension n there exists an involution conjugacy class sk for which mo b n 2 when n is even k may be taken to be n 2 and when n is odd k can be taken to be n 1 2 the results of this paper show that away from the middle codimensions relative to n one cannot expect the length of mo b n to be small factoring of isometries from a geometric viewpoint in hyperbolic 4 space is also studied in 3 where a slightly different formulation and generalization of two and three dimensional half turns is given 2 hyperbolic n space is denoted hn the orientation preserving isometries of hn the mo bius group is mo b n and the full group is mo b n an involution is an order two isometry of hn and a k involution is an isometry with a fixed point set of codimension k a reflection is an involution with a codimension one fixed point set and a half turn is an involution with a codimension two fixed point set the involution is orientation reversing if and only if the codimension of the fixed point set is odd for k 1 2 3 n let sk be the set conjugacy class of k involutions for the basics on hyperbolic space and its isometry group we refer to maskit or ratcliffe 2 4 a good background for n dimensional hyperbolic geometry and some lower dimensional factorization results are given in 6 for standard material on differential topology and lie groups the reader is referred to 5 and 7 we will use the well known facts that the dimension of o n as well as so n is n n 1 2 and the dimension of mo b n as well as mo b n is n n 1 2 the paper is organized as follows section 2 contains the proofs that conjugacy classes of involutions generate the mo bius group as well as up per bounds on word length in section 3 we show that the space of k involutions is a submanifold of mo b n having dimension k n k 1 finally we prove theorem 1 1 in section 4 2 k involutions in the orthogonal and mo bius groups throughout this section we fix an integer n 2 and an integer k 1 2 n 1 the case k n is excluded since sn o n has only one element and hence does not generate the orthogonal group this section is devoted to proving theorem 2 1 sk o n generates o n if k is odd and generates so n when k is even furthermore for g o n g 2 n if g is orientation preserving 2 n 2 k if g is orientation reversing 4 where g is the sk o n length of g corollary 2 2 sk generates mo b n if k is odd and generates mo b n when k is even furthermore for g mo b n g 2 n 4 if g is orientation preserving 2 n 2 k if g is orientation reversing 5 where g is the sk length of g 3 remark 2 3 in both theorem 2 1 and corollary 2 2 we note that k is necessarily odd when g is orientation reversing the stabilizer of any point in hn has a natural identification with o n we fix such a copy of o n mo b n denote the n n diagonal matrices with k entries being 1 and n k being 1 by d n k since an involution in o n is o n conjugate to a diagonal matrix it is immediate that a k involution in o n is conjugate to a diagonal matrix in d n k there are n k such matrices lemma 2 4 assume n 2 and k 1 n 1 1 if k is odd then any element of d n 1 can be written as the product of k elements of d n k 2 any element of d n 2 can be written as the product of two elements of d n k proof for ease of notation we identify the diagonal matrices of size n having 1 entries with the group zn 2 that is n k 0 d n k z n 2 we write an element of zn 2 as a vector with the obvious component wise multiplication in z 2 to prove item 1 consider a 1 1 1 1 d n 1 it suffices to show that a can be written as the desired product for i 1 k let ci d n k with j th component being c j i 1 if j i 1 or k 2 j n 1 if 1 j k 1 and j 6 i 1 6 then a k i 1 ci and we have the desired decomposition of a to prove item 2 consider a 1 1 1 1 d n 2 it suffices to show that a can be written as the desired product let r d n k be such that its j th component is rj 1 if j 1 or k 2 j n 1 if 2 j k 1 7 and let s d n k have jth entry sj 1 if j 2 or k 2 j n 1 otherwise 8 then rs a and we are finished with the proof of item 2 4 lemma 2 5 let a and b be reflections in hyperplanes and in hn n 3 and let g ab then there exist half turns h and k such that g hk proof consider the upper half space model of hn let r n 1 and r n 1 then and are n 2 spheres in r n 1 we may assume that neither nor contains the point at infinity consider the unique circle through and each of the centers of and it is clear that any n 2 sphere containing is orthogonal to each of and let be one such n 2 sphere then r n 1 where is a hyperplane in hn which is orthogonal to each of and let c denote reflection in then h ac and k cb are half turns in hn such that hk ac cb accb ab g proof of theorem 2 1 fix k 1 n 1 using the block diagonal form an element in g so n it is easy to see that an element g so n can be written as a product 1 m where i s 1 o n m is even and m is at most n now using lemma 2 5 we write g as a product of m half turns of course the half turns are o n conjugate to a diagonal matrix in d n 2 and hence using item 2 of lemma 2 4 we can write g as the product of at most 2 n elements in sk o n if g o n so n then g 1 m where m is odd and at most n note that it must be that k is odd as above we write 1 m 1 as the product of at most 2 n 2 elements in sk o n the reflection m using item 1 of lemma 2 4 can be written as the product of k elements in sk o n thus for such an element g g 2 n 2 k proof of corollary 2 2 for g mo b n it is well known that g where and are reflections and is an element of o n moreover g is orientation preserving if and only if so n using lemma 2 5 we can replace by the product of two half turns which by lemma 2 4 can be written as the product of 4 elements in sk the corollary now follows from theorem 2 1 3 involutions and the space of totally geodesic sub spaces of hn throughout this section we fix an integer n 2 and an integer k 1 2 n 1 lemma 3 1 sk mo b n is a connected differentiable submanifold of dimension k n k 1 proof set g mo b n fix sk mo b n and denote its fixed point set by an n k dimensional plane consider the smooth conjugation 5 action of the lie group g on itself namely g f gfg 1 since an orbit of a lie group action is a submanifold we have that the g orbit of that is sk is a submanifold of mo b n furthermore the map from g to g given by g 7 g g 1 induces a one to one smooth map from g k onto sk where k stabg note that k is a closed subgroup of g next observe that stabg stabg and consider the map stabg mo b n k 9 given by g 7 g this is a surjective map with kernel being isomorphic to o k stabg hence stabg o k is isomorphic to mo b n k and thus dim k dim stabg dim mo b n k dim o k 10 thus we have dim sk dim g dim k dim g dim mo b n k dim o k 11 now plugging in the various quantities and simplifying yields the dimen sion of sk to be k n k 1 for k 1 n 1 let gk denote the space of k planes that is k dimensional totally geodesic subspaces in hn the boundary at infinity of a k plane is a round k 1 sphere the space of k 1 spheres with the gromov hausdorff topology induces a natural topology on gk corollary 3 2 gk is a differentiable manifold of dimension n k k 1 proof consider the map gk sn k given by taking the k plane to the n k involution with fixed point set this map is a homeomorphism needs to be checked pulling back the differentiable structure from sn k gk becomes a differentiable manifold whose dimension by lemma 3 1 is n k k 1 4 bounds for the sk length of the mo bius group given a subset j 1 n 1 let s be the generating set s k jsk and set m m s maxc j dim sk maxk j k n k 1 theorem 4 1 except for a set of measure zero no element of mo b n can be written as a product 1 m where i s and m n n 1 2 m 6 proof consider the manifold which is the m fold product of the mo bius group given a sequence k 1 km of m elements from j repetition is allowed consider the mapping sk 1 skm mo b n which assigns the m tuple of ordered ki involutions 1 m to the product 1 m this is a smooth mapping between manifolds the dimension of sk 1 skm is bounded from above by mm which is by assumption less than the dimension of mo b n n n 1 2 hence is a smooth mapping from a manifold of lower dimension to one of higher dimension it is a standard fact that the image of a smooth map from a manifold of lower dimension to one of higher dimension has measure zero finally there are a finite number of namely n n 1 2 m i 1 j i sequences from j of length less than or equal to n n 1 2 m and hence a finite number of maps above thus the set of elements in mo b n that are in the images of such maps is the finite union of sets of measure zero hence has measure zero this precisely says that the elements of mo b n that can be written as a product of at most m elements from s has measure zero theorem 1 1 let n 2 and k 1 2 n 1 if k is even sk generates mo b n and satisfies n n 1 2 k n k 1 mo b n k 2 n 4 12 if k is odd sk generates mo b n and satisfies n n 1 2 k n k 1 mo b n k 2 n 2 k 13 proof the upper bound in either the even or odd case follows from corollary 2 2 for the lower bound if all ki k then m k n k 1 now if g n n 1 2 k n k 1 for all g mo b n then theorem 4 1 is contradicted references 1 a basmajian and b maskit space form isometries as commutators and products of involutions preprint 2 b
