university of oxford and his colleagues from oxford bristol university the isis rutherford laboratory and the helmholtz zentrum berlin 1 performed a neutron scattering experiment on cobalt niobate which describes the one dimensional quantum ising chain they have determined masses of the five emerging particles first two are obeying the relation 8 w e 2 6 conb o 2 1 m m their results could be attributed to the zamolodchikov model 2 which describes the one dimensional ising model at critical temperature perturbed by an external magnetic field leading to eight spinless bosons with the mass

theory of 3 the masses can be related to the radii of the gosset s polytope of 4 in the derivation of the mass relations in 1 the maximal subgroup 5 of the coxeter weyl group plays a crucial role this is evident from the relation 1 where four of the masses are the 8 e w e 8 e 4 w h 8 times the other four masses this motivates us to study the structure of the group w h in terms of quaternions and its 4 d polytopes 4 the rank 4 coxeter group is unique in the sense that it has no correspondence in higher dimensions and describes the quasi crystallography in 4 dimensions it is the extension of the icosahedral group to 4 dimensions the group has four 4 dimensional irreducible representations one of its 4 dimensional irreducible representations can be described by the transformations on the quaternions by performing a left right multiplication of the binary icosahedral group elements i which constitute one of the finite subgroups of quaternions the coxeter group has five maximal subgroups 6 described by the groups 4 w h 3 5 a 2 hw h c i 4 w h 4 w h 4 4 4 2 3 1 2 2 2 2 2 w d aut a w a c w h a aut h h aut a a s c 3 8 2 we use the notation for the semi direct product of two groups importance of these groups will be discussed in the next section it is perhaps interesting to note that the coxeter weyl group seems to show itself as an affine toda field theory in the zero temperature the coldest regime and perhaps as a lie group in the form of describing the heterotic superstring theory at very hot regime planck scale the coxeter weyl group includes the crystallographic tetrahedral and 8 w e 8 e e 8 w e 2 octahedral symmetries in 3 d and 4 d as well as the quasi crystallographic symmetries icosahedral symmetry in 3 d and its generalization to 4 d the icosahedral group of rank 3 describes fully the structures of the fullerenes such as the molecule which is represented by a truncated icosahedron the icosahedral quasicrystals and the viral structures displaying the icosahedral symmetry 60 c 4 w h 4 a short historical account of the development of the theory of polytopes could be in order the platonic solids tetrahedron cube octahedron icosahedron and dodecahedron have been discovered by the people lived in scotland nearly 1000 years earlier than the ancient greeks their models curved on the stones are now kept in the ashmolean museum at oxford 7 they were used in old greek as models to describe fundamental matter associating tetrahedron with fire cube with earth air with octahedron and water with icosahedron and dodecahedron with the universe or ether archimedes discovered the semi regular convex solids now known as archimedean solids kepler completed the classifications of the regular polyhedra in 1620 by inventing prisms and anti prisms as well as four regular non convex polyhedra in 1865 the belgian mathematician catalan constructed the dual solids of the archimedean solids now known as catalan solids 8 extensions of the platonic solids to 4 d dimensions have been made in 1855 by l schlaffli 9 and their generalizations to higher dimensions in 1900 by t gosset 10 further important contributions are made by w a wythoff 11 among many others and in particular by the contemporary mathematicians h s m coxeter 12 and j h conway 13 in what follows we study the branching of the regular semi regular and quasi regular 4 d polytopes described as the orbits of the coxeter group constructions of the defining representation of the coxeter group and its maximal subgroups in terms of quaternions provide an appropriate technique to pursue for this reason we introduce the finite subgroups of quaternions in section 2 and construct the group elements of the groups in terms of quaternions the section 3 deals with the decomposition of the polytopes under the subgroup a similar analysis is carried in section 4 for the decomposition under the subgroup noting that the tetrahedral group is a subgroup of the group w a we give a few examples of the projections of the polytopes into 3 d preserving the tetrahedral symmetry dual polytopes of the 4 d semi regular polytopes have not been studied in mathematical literature the section 5 deals with the construction of the dual polytopes of the regular and semi regular polytopes of the coxeter group w h some concluding remarks are made in section 6 3 4 w h 4 4

the imaginary units satisfy i j ij ijk k e e e 1 2 3 i j k 3 let p q be unit quaternions and r represents an arbitrary quaternion then the transformations 14 r prq p q r prq p q 4 define the orthogonal group o 4 which preserves the norm rr rr we shall use the abstract notations and p q p q respectively for the transformations in 4 the first term in 3 represents a proper rotation and the second includes also the reflection generally called rotary reflection in particular the group element r prp p p 5 represents the reflection with respect to the hyperplane orthogonal to the unit quaternion p the orthogonal transformations in 3 d can be simply written as r prp p p where r is an imaginary quaternion 2 2 finite subgroups of quaternions the finite subgroups of quaternions are well known and its classification can be found in the references 15 they are given as follows a cyclic group of order n with n an odd number b cyclic group of order 2 n is generated by 1 exp p e n and

constitute the vertices of an icosidodecahedron the set of quaternions representing the binary icosahedral group i can also be written as the union of two sets sti 8 where the set s is represented by the quaternions 5 2 e 1 e 3 e 2 1 1 e 3 e 2 e 2 1 3 e 2 e 1 e 2 1 1 e 3 e 1 2 1 3 e 2 e 1 2 1 2 e 1 e 1 2 1 1 e 3 e 2 1 3 e 2 e 2 1 2 e 1 e 2 1 2 e 3 e 2 1 1 e 2 e 2 1 3 e 1 e 2 1 s 9 it is interesting to note that the set of quaternions i represents the vertices of 600 cell 17 and the set s represents the vertices of the snub 24 cell 18 the coxeter diagram is illustrated in figure 1

p q i we can use a symbolic notation for the designation of the group now the subgroup can be represented by the set 4 w h i i i i 3 w h 3 with h p p p p p p i w it is obvious that the group can be represented by the set 3 5 c h i i i i a 2 5 aw where is the group of even permutations of five letters with an order of 60 and the stands for the group generated by inversion an extended diagram allows us to represent an extended root represented by the quaternion 2 c 4 h 0 2 when the root 4 is deleted the remaining diagram represents the group structure where the generator can be represented by reflection with respect to the hyperplane orthogonal to the unit quaternion 1 then the representation of the maximal subgroup of order 240 is given by 3 1 w h a 0 1 1 r 1 2 0 r r r 3 r 0 r 3 1 5 2 a c cw h w a i i i i 2 13 since the index 4 3 1 60 w h w h w a then the maximal subgroup can be embedded in the coxeter group in 60 different ways which are all conjugate to each other the group in 13 leaves the unit quaternion 3 w h w a 1 4 w h 1 invariant the other conjugate groups can be represented by the set 3 1 qw h w a i q i q i q i q 14 which leaves invariant where qq i is an arbitrary element of the binary icosahedral group i the subgroup can be generated by the reflections on the simple roots of the weyl coxeter diagram shown in fig 2 4 w a r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 figure 2 the coxeter

the group 4 aut a i i i is of the order 240 and can be embedded in the coxeter group in 60 different ways one for each pairs before we conclude this section we also mention that another 4 dimensional irreducible representation of the group can be described as then the above analysis can be carried out with the interchange of two irreducible representations of the binary icosahedral group 4 w h q i

polytopes and branching under the group 4 w h 3 w h an arbitrary highest weight vector describing an irreducible representation of a rank 4 lie group is given in the dynkin basis 19 as 443322114321 aaaaaaaa where 4321 ii are the vectors of the dual basis satisfying the relation i j ij 0 ia 4 for the highest weight vector the dynkin indices are non negative integers although the coxeter group is

negative real number not necessarily restricted to integers only 0 ia we define an orbit of the group by the group action 4 w h 4 o w h the size of the orbit is 14 400 with 4 o w h 0 ia 4 3 2 1 i which is equal to the order of the group one can count the number of cells of the polytope by using 4 w h 4 o w h 8 its rank 3 subgroups 3 w h 3 5 2 3 and w a d c d c 2 3 w h 120 4 3 1 i i w h g 120 1 i o the last two groups are the symmetries of the pentagonal and triangular prisms respectively in principle the polytopes can be projected in 3 dimensions by preserving any one of these rank 3 subgroups we will give examples only for the case of the groups and a right coset 4 w h 3 w a 3 iw h decomposition of the group w h 4 under its subgroup w h 3 can be given by w h 17 then the orbit

120 ig i indeed the set 1 i form an invariant subgroup of the group w h thus the set of vectors are the set of 120 quaternionic vectors 4 i ig i applying the group w h on these 120 vectors one generates 120 different orbits each consisting of 120 vectors in general 3 the group acts on an arbitrary vector 3 w h 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 b b b b b 3 3 b with 1 2 3 i j ij i j where and the cartan matrix i

dodecahedron icosidodecahedron and icosahedron 20 the orbits obtained from the vectors represent respectively a quasi regular truncated dodecahedron with edges of lengths and a quasi regular truncated

uniform polytopes of the coxeter weyl group 4 w h in the references 20 and 23 we have proved that all the catalan solids can be derived from the coxeter diagrams with a simple technique which we will also apply for the constructions of the dual polytopes of the 4 d polytopes to obtain the vertices of the dual polytope of a given polytope one determines the centers of the cells joined to the vertex the relative magnitudes of these vectors are determined from the fact that the hyperplane formed by the vectors representing the centers of the cells are orthogonal to the vertex let us recall that the dual polytopes are cell transitive similar to the catalan solids which are face transitive in what follows we study the duals of the uniform polytopes in turn 333 hba 1 2 3 4 a a a a 1 2 3 4 a a a

4 20 number of vertices of the polytope 24 120 w h w a 36 this formula has an interesting group theoretical interpretation the orbit which includes the vector 1 1 0 0 0 can be generated by the icosahedral group and represents a dodecahedron note that the dihedral subgroup 3 1 2 w h r r r 3 r 3 3 2 d r leaves the vector 1 invariant a left coset decomposition will generate the vertices of the dodecahedron where 20 3 1 i i w h g d 3 3 3 3 i ig w a g i g w h d 3 at each vertex of the 600 cell there exist 20 tetrahedra each of which is generated by a conjugate group 1 1 i 2 20 similarly the left coset decomposition of the tetrahedral group can be written as where the group 4 3 1 i i w a f d 3 2 3 d r r leaves the vectors 1 1 0 0 0 and 4 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 1 3 i i invariant it is those conjugate groups f w h f i generate four dodecahedra when applied on the vector 1 14 whose centers form four tetrahedra the number of vertices of the polytope 4 1 w h is 600 which are equal to the number of left cossets index of the group in the group the number of dodecahedral cells of the polytope 3 w a 4 w h 4 1 w h is 120 since it is equal to the number of conjugate groups of the group in the group therefore the 120 cell is the dual of the 600 cell and the vice versa 3 w h 0 0 4 w h 5 2 dual polytope of the 720 cell o o 2 0 1 this uniform polytope consists of the cells tetrahedra and the icosidodecahedra since the subgroup w a 3 r 2 r 3 r 4 acting on the vector 0 generates a tetrahedron and the subgroup 1 0 0 3 2 3 0 1 0 0 w h w h generates an icosidodecahedron with 30 vertices for the index of the group 2 2 1 3 c c r r leaving the vector 3 2 2 30 w h c c invariant is equal to 2 actually the vector 2 is left invariant by the group of generators 3 2 d c 1 3 r r r 4 defining the symmetry of the triangular prism of order 12 therefore the number of the vertices of the polytope is equal to the index 4 3 2 w h d c 1200 total number of cells are given by the sum of indices 4 4 3 3 600 w h w h w a w h 120 37 the number of cells which share the vector 2 as a vertex is determined by the formula similar to the one in equation 36 which leads to 2 tetrahedra and 3 icosidodecahedra at the vertex 2 then the centers of these polyhedra are given by the vectors up to a relative scale factor 1 1 r 1 4 3 4 4 r r the centers of the tetrahedra 4 3 4 rr 38 the centers of the icosidodecahedra these vertices define a hyperplane orthogonal to the vector 2 therefore one can determine the scale factor from the equation 1 4 2 0 leading to the value 2 3 the set of vertices of the dual polytope is the union of the orbits 2 1 0 0 o 0 0 0 0 1 3 o they define two concentric spheres with the fraction of radii 3 s 4 1 1 061 r r where 1 4 and r r represent the radii of the

4 r r 1 1 1 1 r 1 is orthogonal to the plane of the triangle therefore the solid is a dipyramid with triangular base with the edge 15 lengths 2 1 41 and 1 4 0 867 let us introduce new set of

symmetries represented by the coxeter groups and the regular and semi regular polytopes are all well known in the mathematical literature however their constructions in terms of quaternions are recently gaining some interest moreover their duals have not been constructed to date in this paper we have first constructed the group in terms of quaternions and proved that its two 4 dimensional irreducible representations can be constructed with the use of two irreducible representations of the binary icosahedral group represented by the sets of quaternions 4 aw 4 bw 4 hw 4 fw 4 w h i and ii we have constructed semi regular polytopes in terms of quaternions and projected them to 3 d by decomposing the orbits under the icosahedral group w h explicit decomposition of an arbitrary polytope of the group under the group has been made this decomposition allows the projection of the polytopes into 3 d by preserving the tetrahedral symmetry the vertices of the dual polytopes of the semi regular polytopes have been constructed and their cells have been determined 4 w h 3 w a 3 4 aw 4 w h 4 w h 4 w h references 1 r coldea d a tennant e w wheeler e wawzynska d prabhakaran m telling k
