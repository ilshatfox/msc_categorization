department of pure mathematics and computer algebra ghent university krijgslaan 281 s 22 b 9000 gent belgium sgdwinte jschille cage ugent be september 28 2007 abstract in this article we show that non singular quadrics and non singular hermitian varieties are completely characterized by their intersection numbers with respect to hyperplanes and spaces of codimension 2 this strongly generalizes a result by ferri and tallini 4 and also provides necessary and sufficient conditions for quasi quadrics re spectively their hermitian analogues to be non singular quadrics re spectively hermitian varieties 1 introduction when segre 12 proved his celebrated characterization of conics ev ery set of q 1 points in pg 2 q q odd no three of which are collinear is a conic he did more than proving a beautiful and interesting theorem he in fact provided the starting point of a new direction in combinatorial geometry in this branch of combinatorics the idea is to provide purely combinatorial characterizations of objects classi cally defined in an algebraic way this article wants to contribute to this theory by proving strong characterizations of classical finite polar spaces 1 http arxiv org abs 1309 2005 v 1 1 1 polar spaces though we suppose the reader to be familiar with polar spaces that is via polarities quadrics and hermitian varieties in pg n q we will quickly overview notation and terminology and recall some results that will be useful throughout this paper a finite classical non singular polar space is one of the following a hyperbolic quadric in pg 2 n 1 q denoted by q 2 n 1 q a parabolic quadric in pg 2 n q denoted by q 2 n q an elliptic quadric in pg 2 n 1 q denoted by q 2 n 1 q a hermitian variety in pg n q 2 denoted by h n q 2 a symplectic polar space in pg 2 n 1 q denoted by w 2 n 1 q remark throughout this article we will use the above notations for non singular polar spaces a cone with vertex a point p or a line l over a non singular polar space e g over a q 2 n q will be denoted as pq 2 n q respectively lq 2 n q a small letter will always indicate the vertex of the cone is a point while a capital letter will indicate the vertex is a line with these conventions the notation will always immediately tell whether the considered polar space is singular or non singular only in the statements of our lemmas and theorems we will explicitly mention the non singular character of the considered polar spaces 1 2 characterizations of polar spaces a thick partial linear space of order s t is a point line geometry such that each line contains s 1 2 points such that each point is contained in t 1 2 lines and such that two distinct lines intersect in at most one point a thick partial linear space s is said to be a shult space if for every antiflag p l of s either exactly 1 or all points of l are collinear with p the following very nice theorem is the result of work done by veldkamp 17 tits 16 buekenhout and shult 2 theorem 1 1 suppose that s is a shult space such that no point of s is collinear with all other points of s and such that there exists an antiflag p l with the property that p is collinear with all points of l 2 then s is isomorphic to the point line geometry of a finite classical non singular polar space if a shult space is fully embedded in a projective space then the fol lowing theorem follows from buekenhout and lefe vre 1 and lefe vre percsy 8 9 theorem 1 2 suppose s is a shult space such that no point of s is collinear with all other points of s if s is fully embedded in a projective space then s consists of the points and lines of a finite classical polar space here fully embedded means that the set of lines of s is a subset of the set of lines of the projective space and that the point set of s is the set of all points contained in these lines the following characterizations of quadrics and hermitian vari eties which can be found in hirschfeld and thas 7 will be of great importance in the proof of our main theorem these theorems also provide nice examples of segre type theorems definition a point setk in pg n q is said to be of type r 1 r 2 rs if l k r 1 r 2 rs for all lines l of pg n q a point p k is called singular with respect to k if all lines through p intersect k either in 1 or in q 1 points if a set k contains a singular point then k is called singular the theorem below is an amalgation of results by tallini scafati 15 hirschfeld and thas 6 and glynn 5 theorem 1 3 let k be a non singular point set of type 1 r q 2 1 in pg n q 2 n 4 and q 2 satisfying the following properties 3 r q 2 1 there does not exist a plane such that every line of intersects k in r or q 2 1 points then the set k is the point set of a non singular hermitian variety h n q 2 the result below was obtained by tallini in 13 and 14 theorem 1 4 in pg n q with n 4 and q 2 let k be a non singular point set of type 0 1 2 q 1 if qn 1 1 q 1 k qn 1 q 1 then one of the following holds 3 i k qn 1 q 1 n is even and k is the point set of a q n q ii k qn 1 q 1 q n 1 2 n is odd and k is the point set of a q n q iii k qn 1 q 1 1 q is even and k tk n with t some pg t q pg n q and with k the point set of a q n t 1 q in some n t 1 dimensional subspace of pg n q skew from pg t q hence n t 1 is even or with k a q 1 arc in plane skew from pg t q if t n 3 in each case n is the nucleus of k these two theorems provide characterizations of certain polar spaces by their line intersections it is a natural question to ask whether po lar spaces can also be characterized by their intersections with respect to other subspaces a first result in this direction was given by the following theorem of ferri tallini 4 theorem 1 5 if a set k of points in pg n q n 4 with k q 3 q 2 q 1 is such that it has as intersection numbers with planes 1 a b where a b and b 2 q 1 and as intersection numbers with solids c c q c 2 q and such that solids intersecting k in c and c q points exist then k is the point set of a q 4 q this theorem is a clear motivation to look at the following questions is it possible to characterize finite classical polar spaces by their intersection numbers with respect to planes and solids respectively by their intersections with respect to hyperplanes and subspaces of codimension 2 note that these questions of course do not make any sense for the polar space w 2 n 1 q as this polar space comprises all points of its ambient projective space the first question was answered affirmi tively in schillewaert 10 and schillewaert and thas 11 the second question will be the subject of this paper though it is possible to characterize certain polar spaces only by their line intersections the existence in abundance of quasi quadrics and quasi hermitian vari eties shows that it is not possible to characterize them merely by their intersections with respect to hyperplanes here we define a quasi quadric respectively quasi hermitian variety to be a subset of the set of points of a projective space having the same intersection numbers with respect to hyperplanes as a non singular quadric respectively a non singular hermitian variety in the parabolic case this is a slight 4 deviation of the standard definition as given in 3 the concept of a quasi hermitian variety in fact does not appear in the literature but in unpublished work the second author showed that examples can be constructed with the same techniques as used to construct quasi quadrics for an overview on quasi quadrics we refer to 3 hence the following segre type characterization of polar spaces which is the main theorem of this paper also provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a quasi quadric or a quasi hermitian variety to be a non singular quadric or hermitian variety theorem 1 6 if a point set k in pg n q n 4 q 2 has the same intersection numbers with respect to hyperplanes and subspaces of codimension 2 as a polar space p h n q q n q q n q q n q then k is the point set of a non singular polar space p remark for n 3 the conclusion of the above theorem remains true in the hermitian and hyperbolic case this is easily seen using theorem 1 2 in the elliptic case the conclusion only remains true if q is odd as every non classical ovoid provides a counter example if n 4 the conclusion of the theorem is true for all q in the parabolic case this is a corollary of theorem 1 5 see schillewaert 10 and in the hermitian case this result was obtained in schillewaert and thas 11 in the next section we will handle the four different types of polar spaces one by one the basic idea is to study certain structures in the dual projective space however the elliptic and parabolic case will turn out to be harder than the other two cases and especially the parabolic case will be more complex and interesting this is basically due to the fact that there are more intersections with respect to hyperplanes 2 proof of the theorem 1 6 from here on we always assume that we work in a projective space of dimension at least four and that q 2 2 1 hermitian varieties let us first recall the intersections of an h n q 2 in pg n q 2 with hyperplanes and subspaces of codimension 2 a hyperplane intersects an h n q 2 either in an h n 1 q 2 or in a cone ph n 2 q 2 a 5 subspace of codimension 2 intersects an h n q 2 either in an h n 2 q 2 in a cone ph n 3 q 2 or in a cone lh n 4 q 2 hence the intersection numbers with hyperplanes are h 1 qn 1 n qn 1 1 n q 2 1 h 2 1 q 2 qn 1 1 n qn 2 1 n q 2 1 and the intersection numbers with subspaces of codimension 2 are c 1 qn 1 1 n qn 2 1 n q 2 1 c 2 1 q 2 qn 2 1 n qn 3 1 n q 2 1 c 3 1 q 2 q 4 qn 3 1 n qn 4 1 n q 2 1 from now on let k be a point set in pg n q 2 having the above in tersection numbers with respect to hyperplanes and subspaces of codi mension 2 we want to prove that k is the point set of an h n q 2 we will call subspaces intersecting k in a given number m of points subspaces of type m for obvious reasons a hyperplane intersecting k in h 2 points will also be called a tangent hyperplane lemma 2 1 the set k contains h n q 2 points there are h n q 2 tangent hyperplanes proof we count in two ways the pairs p where p is a point of k and a hyperplane such that p respectively the triples p r where p 6 r are points of k and a hyperplane such that p r denote by h 1 the number of hyperplanes intersecting k in h 1 points and by x the size of k we obtain x q 2 n 1 q 2 1 h 1 h 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 2 1 h 1 h 2 1 and x x 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 2 1 h 1 h 1 h 1 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 2 1 h 1 h 2 h 2 1 2 solving the first equation for h 1 and substituting this value in the second equation yields a quadratic equation in x the solutions are x 1 h n q 2 and x 2 which is a tedious expression in q however easily computed with any computer algebra package 6 we show the latter is impossible so suppose by way of contra diction that the set k contains x 2 points consider a subspace of codimension 2 intersecting the set k in ci points denote by ki the number of non tangent hyperplanes containing we obtain the following equation ki h 1 ci q 2 1 ki h 2 ci ci x 2 solving this equation in ki for i 1 2 3 yields respectively k 1 qn 1 n q 2 q 1 qn 1 1 n k 2 2 qn 1 n q 2 1 qn 1 1 n k 3 qn 1 2 qn 1 n qn 1 1 n these are not natural numbers if n 2 proving x 2 cannot occur the second assertion follows by substituting x h n q 2 in equation 1 remark notice that for n 2 we would obtain natural numbers and in that case we have x 2 q 2 q 1 that is exactly the number of points of a baer subplane which was to be expected lemma 2 2 through a space of codimension 2 of type c 1 c 2 c 3 there pass respectively t 1 q 1 t 2 1 t 3 q 2 1 tangent hyper planes proof let be a codimension 2 space intersecting k in ci points and let ti denote the number of tangent hyperplanes containing we obtain the following equation ci ti h 2 ci q 2 1 ti h 1 ci k solving the equation in ti for i 1 2 3 yields the result lemma 2 3 each tangent hyperplane contains ai subspaces of codi mension 2 intersecting k in ci points where a 1 q 2 n 2 a 2 qn 2 qn 1 1 n q 1 a 3 qn 1 1 n qn 2 1 n q 2 1 7 proof consider any tangent hyperplane denote by ai the number of codimension 2 subspaces of type ci contained in then i ai q 2 n 1 q 2 1 we count in two ways the pairs p p with p a point of k and a subspace of codimension 2 we obtain i aici h 2 q 2 n 2 1 q 2 1 next we count in two ways the triples p r with p r with p 6 r points of k and a subspace of codimension 2 we obtain i aici ci 1 h 2 h 2 1 q 2 n 4 1 q 2 1 the obtained system of three linear equations in a 1 a 2 and a 3 can easily be solved yielding the desired result lemma 2 4 each point of k is contained in h 2 tangent hyperplanes while each point not in k is contained in h 1 tangent hyperplanes proof we need to show that each point of k is contained in h 2 tangent hyperplanes set k p 1 p h n q 2 let ai denote the number of tangent hyperplanes containing the point pi counting pairs p p k p a tangent hyperplane we obtain i ai h n q 2 h 2 3 next we count triples p 1 2 p k p i i a tangent hyperplane i 1 2 1 6 2 this yields the following equation i ai ai 1 h n q 2 j aj tj 1 cj 4 where as before ti denotes the number of tangent hyperplanes con taining a fixed codimension 2 space of type ci and ai is the number of codimension 2 subspaces of type ci in a tangent hyperplane 8 from equations 3 and 4 we can compute h n q 2 i a 2 i i ai 2 0 from which we deduce using the variance trick that ai is a constant equal to h 2 the second assertion is proved in a similar way denote byh the set of tangent hyperplanes ofk let pg n q pg n q d be any fixed chosen duality of pg n q lemma 2 5 the point set k h is a 1 q 1 q 2 1 set in pg n q d proof as by lemma 2 2 a codimension 2 subspace is contained in either 1 q 1 or q 2 1 tangent hyperplanes applying immediately yields the result lemma 2 6 the set k is the point set of a non singular hermitian variety h n q 2 in pg n q d proof we will check the conditions of theorem 1 3 since every tangent hyperplane contains subspaces of type c 1 by lemma 2 3 we see that every point of k is contained in lines intersecting k in exactly q 1 points hence k is non singular as q 2 also the first condition is satisfied now assume there would be a plane intersecting k in a point set such that every line of would intersect k in q 1 or q 2 1 points then k would be the complement of a maximal q 2 q arc in implying that q 2 q divides q 2 a contradiction since q 2 consequently also the second condition of theorem 1 3 is satisfied and k is the point set of a non singular hermitian variety in pg n q 2 theorem 2 7 the set k is the point set of a non singular hermitian variety h n q 2 proof clearly k is a point set satisfying the same conditions on intersections with hyperplanes and subspaces of codimension 2 as k in pg n q 2 since the tangent hyperplanes at k are exactly those hyperplanes containing h 2 points of k we find that if we apply the duality 1 to pg n q d the tangent hyperplanes of k are mapped bijectively to the points of k see lemma 2 4 hence we can now apply lemma 2 6 with k in pg n q 2 d replaced by k in pg n q 2 we conclude that k is the point set of an h n q 2 9 2 2 hyperbolic quadrics first of all let us recall what the intersections of a q 2 n 1 q with hyperplanes and spaces of codimension 2 look like a hyperplane can intersect a q 2 n 1 q in a q 2 n q or in a cone pq 2 n 1 q a space of codimension 2 can intersect a q 2 n 1 q either in a q 2 n 1 q in a cone pq 2 n 2 q in a q 2 n 1 q or in a cone lq 2 n 3 q so the intersection numbers with hyperplanes are h 1 q 2 n 1 q 1 h 2 1 q qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 the intersection numbers with spaces of codimension 2 are c 1 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 c 2 1 q q 2 n 2 1 q 1 c 3 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 c 4 1 q q 2 qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 from now on let k be a set of points in pg 2 n 1 q having the same intersection numbers with hyperplanes and codimension 2 spaces as a q 2 n 1 q we want to prove that k is the point set of a q 2 n 1 q we will call subspaces intersecting k in a given number m of points subspaces of type m for obvious reasons a hyperplane intersecting k in h 2 points will also be called a tangent hyperplane lemma 2 8 the set k has size q 2 n 1 q furthermore there are q 2 n 1 q tangent hyperplanes proof we count in two ways the pairs p where p is a point of k and a hyperplane such that p respectively the triples p r where p 6 r are points of k and a hyperplane such that p r call h 1 the number of hyperplanes intersecting k in h 1 points and x the size of k this yields the following equations h 1 h 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 1 h 1 h 2 x q 2 n 1 1 q 1 5 h 1 h 1 h 1 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 1 h 1 h 2 h 2 1 x x 1 q 2 n 1 q 1 6 10 solving h 1 in terms of x from the first equation and substituting this in the second equation yields a quadratic equation in x the solutions are x 1 q 2 n 1 q and x 2 which is as in the hermitian case an easily computed but tedious expression in q we show that the latter cannot occur so suppose the set k con tains x 2 points consider a space of codimension 2 intersecting the set k in ci points denote by ki the number of non tangent hyper planes containing then we obtain ki h 1 ci q 1 ki h 2 ci ci x 2 solving this equation in ki for i 1 2 3 4 yields k 1 3 q 1 qn 1 k 2 q qn 1 1 qn 1 k 3 2 qn q 1 qn 1 k 4 qn 1 2 qn 1 qn 1 these are not natural numbers the desired contradiction the second assertion follows by substituting x q 2 n 1 q in equation 5 lemma 2 9 through a space of codimension 2 of type c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 there pass respectively t 1 0 t 2 1 t 3 2 and t 4 q 1 tangent hyperplanes proof let be a codimension 2 space intersecting k in ci points and let ti denote the number of tangent hyperplanes containing we obtain the following equation ci ti h 2 ci q 1 ti h 1 ci k solving the equation in ti for i 1 2 3 yields the result lemma 2 10 each tangent hyperplane contains ai subspaces of codi mension 2 intersecting k in ci points where a 1 0 a 2 q n 1 qn 1 a 3 q 2 n a 4 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 11 proof consider any tangent hyperplane by the previous lemma a 1 0 hence 4 i 2 ai q 2 n 1 1 q 1 we count in two ways the pairs p p with p a point of k and a subspace of codimension 2 we obtain 4 i 2 aici h 2 q 2 n 1 q 1 next we count in two ways the triples p r with p r with p 6 r points of k and a subspace of codimension 2 we obtain 4 i 2 aici ci 1 h 2 h 2 1 q 2 n 1 1 q 1 the obtained system of three linear equations in a 2 a 3 and a 4 can easily be solved yielding the desired result lemma 2 11 each point of k is contained in h 2 tangent hyper planes while each point not in k is contained in h 1 tangent hyper planes proof we need to show that each point of k is contained in h 2 tangent hyperplanes set k p 1 p q 2 n 1 q let ai denote the number of tangent hyperplanes containing the point pi counting pairs p p k p a tangent hyperplane we obtain i ai q 2 n 1 q h 2 7 next we count triples p 1 2 p k p i i a tangent hyperplane i 1 2 as before ti denotes the number of tangent hyperplanes containing a fixed codimension 2 space of type ci we obtain the following equation i ai ai 1 q 2 n 1 q j aj tj 1 cj 8 from equations 7 and 8 we can compute q 2 n 1 q i a 2 i i ai 2 0 12 from which we deduce that ai is a constant equal to h 2 the second assertion is proved in a similar way denote by h the set of tangent hyperplanes of k let pg 2 n 1 q pg 2 n 1 q d be any fixed chosen duality of pg 2 n 1 q lemma 2 12 the set k h is the point set of a non singular hyperbolic quadric q 2 n 1 q in pg 2 n 1 q d proof this is an immediate consequence of lemma 2 9 lemma 2 10 and theorem 1 4 theorem 2 13 the set k is the point set of a non singular hyper bolic quadric q 2 n 1 q in pg 2 n 1 q proof clearly k is a point set satisfying the same conditions on intersections with hyperplanes and subspaces of codimension 2 as k in pg 2 n 1 q since the tangent hyperplanes at k are exactly those hyperplanes containing h 2 points of k we find that if we apply the duality 1 to pg 2 n 1 q d the tangent hyperplanes of k are mapped bijectively to the points of k see lemma 2 11 hence we can now apply lemma 2 12 withk in pg 2 n 1 q d replaced byk in pg 2 n 1 q we conclude that k is the point set of a q 2 n 1 q 2 3 elliptic quadrics first of all let us recall what the intersections of a q 2 n 1 q with hyperplanes and spaces of codimension 2 look like a hyperplane of pg 2 n 1 q can intersect a q 2 n 1 q either in a q 2 n q or in a cone pq 2 n 1 q a space of codimension 2 can intersect a q 2 n 1 q either in a q 2 n 1 q a cone pq 2 n 2 q a q 2 n 1 q or a cone lq 2 n 3 q so the intersection numbers with hyperplanes are h 1 q 2 n 1 q 1 h 2 1 q qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 the intersection numbers with spaces of codimension 2 are c 1 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 c 2 1 q q 2 n 2 1 q 1 13 c 3 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 c 4 1 q q 2 qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 from now on let k be a set of points in pg 2 n 1 q n 2 having the same intersection numbers with hyperplanes and codimension 2 spaces as a q 2 n 1 q we want to prove that k is the point set of a non singular elliptic quadric we will call subspaces intersecting k in a given number m of points subspaces of type m for obvious reasons a hyperplane intersecting k in h 2 points will also be called a tangent hyperplane lemma 2 14 the set k has size q 2 n 1 q furthermore there are q 2 n 1 q tangent hyperplanes proof this is proved in a similar way as lemma 2 8 lemma 2 15 through a space of codimension 2 of type c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 there pass respectively t 1 0 t 2 1 t 3 2 and t 4 q 1 tangent hyperplanes proof this is completely analogous to the proof of lemma 2 9 lemma 2 16 each tangent hyperplane contains ai subspaces of codi mension 2 intersecting k in ci points where a 1 0 a 2 q n 1 qn 1 a 3 q 2 n a 4 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 proof the proof is similar to the proof of lemma 2 10 lemma 2 17 each point of k is contained in h 2 tangent hyper planes while each point not in k is contained in h 1 tangent hyper planes proof this is proved as in lemma 2 11 denote by h the set of tangent hyperplanes of k let pg 2 n 1 q pg 2 n 1 q d be any fixed chosen duality of pg 2 n 1 q by lemma 2 15 the set k h is a 0 1 2 q 1 set in pg 2 n 1 q d we want to show that k is the point set of an elliptic quadric 14 notice however that k does not satisfy the conditions of theorem 1 4 by lemma 2 17 the intersection numbers of k with respect to hyperplanes are h 1 and h 2 we define a point line geometry s with point set k and line set those lines of pg 2 n 1 q d intersecting k in q 1 points the incidence is the natural one theorem 2 18 the geometry s is a shult space such that no point of s is collinear with all other points of s proof consider a point p of s and a line l of s such that p and l are not incident consider the plane generated by p and l if this plane contains another point r of s then the fact that k is a 0 1 2 q 1 set implies that intersects s either in two intersecting lines or is fully contained in s notice that q 2 is necessary here in both cases the 1 or all axiom holds next suppose that intersects s only in p and l assume that would not be contained in a hyperplane of type h 1 we count pairs u h with u a point of s not in and h a hyperplane containing u and we obtain q 2 n 1 q q 2 q 2 n 2 1 q 1 q 2 n 1 1 q 1 h 2 q 2 a contradiction hence is contained in at least one hyperplane of type h 1 by theorem 1 4 the 0 1 2 q 1 set k is the point set of a non singular parabolic quadric we conclude that in s the point p is collinear with 1 or all points of l since each point of s is contained in at least one hyperplane of type h 1 no point of s is collinear with all other points of s we still have to proof that through every point there passes a constant number of lines in order to conclude that s is a shult space using our definition from the introduction of shult space which is slightly different from the original one consider first two non collinear points p and r then for every line containing p there is exactly one line through r hence through p and r there pass the same number of lines next consider two collinear points p and r considering all planes containing the line pr it is clear that one can find a point s which is both non collinear with p and r by the above there pass equally many lines through p and r corollary 2 19 the point set k forms the point set of a non singular elliptic quadric q 2 n 1 q 15 proof this is an immediate consequence of k q 2 n 1 q the previous lemma and theorem 1 2 theorem 2 20 the set k is the point set of a non singular elliptic quadric q 2 n 1 q in pg 2 n 1 q proof clearly k is a point set satisfying the same conditions on intersections with hyperplanes and subspaces of codimension 2 as k in pg 2 n 1 q since the tangent hyperplanes at k are exactly those hyperplanes containing h 2 points of k we find that if we apply the duality 1 to pg 2 n 1 q d the tangent hyperplanes of k are mapped bijectively to the points ofk see lemma 2 17 hence we can now apply corollary 2 19 with k in pg 2 n 1 q d replaced by k in pg 2 n 1 q we conclude that k is the point set of a q 2 n 1 q 2 4 parabolic quadrics first of all let us recall what the intersections of a q 2 n q with hy perplanes and spaces of codimension 2 look like a hyperplane can intersect a q 2 n q either in a q 2 n 1 q a q 2 n 1 q or in a cone pq 2 n 2 q a space of codimension 2 can intersect a parabolic quadric q 2 n q either in a q 2 n 2 q a cone pq 2 n 3 q a cone pq 2 n 3 q or a cone lq 2 n 4 q notice that this cone contains the same number of points as aq 2 n 2 q so the intersection numbers with hyperplanes are h 1 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 h 2 qn 1 qn 1 1 q 1 h 3 1 q q 2 n 2 1 q 1 the intersection numbers with spaces of codimension 2 are c 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 1 c 2 1 q qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 c 3 1 q qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 from now on let k be a set of points in pg 2 n q having the same intersection numbers with hyperplanes and codimension 2 spaces as a 16 q 2 n q we want to prove that k is the point set of a q 2 n q we will call subspaces intersecting k in a given number m of points subspaces of type m for obvious reasons a hyperplane intersecting k in h 2 points will also be called a tangent hyperplane lemma 2 21 the set k contains q 2 n q points proof let hi respectively ci denote the number of hyperplanes of type hi respectively the number of codimension 2 spaces of type ci by counting pairs and triples as in lemma 2 8 but now with respect to hyperplanes as well as with respect to codimension 2 spaces we obtain i hi q 2 n 1 1 q 1 9 i hihi q 2 n 1 q 1 k 10 i hihi hi 1 q 2 n 1 1 q 1 k k 1 11 i ci q 2 n 1 1 q 2 n 1 q 2 1 q 1 12 i cici k q 2 n 1 q 2 n 1 1 q 2 1 q 1 13 i cici ci 1 k k 1 q 2 n 1 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 2 1 q 1 14 now consider a hyperplane of type hj and denote by m j i the number of codimension 2 spaces of type ci it contains by counting pairs p and triples p r with p 6 r points of k a codimension 2 space and p r we obtain i m j i q 2 n 1 q 1 i m j ici hj q 2 n 1 1 q 1 17 i m j ici ci 1 hj hj 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 1 from these equations all values m j i can easily be determined as m 22 0 we see that the number of hyperplanes of type h 1 through a codimension 2 space of type c 2 is a constant f k depending only on the size of k with f k linear in k by counting pairs h with h a hyperplane of type h 1 h a codimension 2 space of type c 2 we obtain h 1 m 1 2 c 2 f k 15 so h 1 h 1 c 2 k with h 1 c 2 k linear in k from equations 12 13 and 14 we can obtain an expression for c 2 depending only on k say c 2 c 2 k with c 2 k quadratic in k from equations 9 10 and 11 we can now obtain a quadratic equation in k of the form s k 2 t k h 1 0 by substitution we obtain s k 2 t k h 1 c 2 k k 0 16 which turns out to be a cubic equation in k one simply checks that k q 2 n 1 q 1 is a solution of equation 16 we want to exclude the other roots of equation 16 as possible sizes for the set k though maple is not able to directly calculate the other roots for general n and q it is not too hard to determine the product and sum of the roots of equation 16 with it one obtains that the three roots have product q 4 n 2 q 2 n 1 3 q 2 n q 2 n 1 q 2 n 2 1 q 1 3 q 2 n 1 1 and sum 3 qn 1 qn 1 q 1 from the above expressions one can deduce that the roots different from q 2 n 1 q 1 are not real numbers a contradiction lemma 2 22 there are exactly q 2 n 1 q 1 tangent hyperplanes further more every codimension 2 space of type c 2 or c 3 is contained in exactly one tangent hyperplane 18 proof the first assertion follows from equations 9 10 and 11 once we know k q 2 n 1 q 1 to prove the second assertion we notice that m 13 m 2 2 0 hence if ti denotes the number of tangent hyperplanes containing a given codimension 2 space of type ci i 2 3 then ti h 3 ci q 1 ti hi 1 ci ci k we obtain t 2 t 3 1 lemma 2 23 for every codimension 2 space of type c 1 the number of hyperplanes of type h 1 containing it is equal to the number of hy perplanes of type h 2 in which it is contained proof one notices that k q 1 h 3 c 1 c 1 and that h 1 h 2 2 h 3 the lemma follows lemma 2 24 let be a codimension 3 space contained in a hyper plane h of type h 1 suppose that is contained in nh codimen sion 2 spaces of type c 2 such that h then k qn 2 nh qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 furthermore if is also contained in a hyperplane e of type h 2 then nh 2 proof let x denote the number of points of k contained in as m 13 0 we have q 1 nh c 1 x nh c 2 x x h 1 it follows that x nhq n 2 qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 next let e be a hyperplane of type h 2 containing and let ne be the number of codimension 2 spaces of type c 3 such that e since m 22 0 we obtain that q 1 ne c 1 x ne c 3 x x h 2 substitution of the higher obtained expression for x in terms of nh yields ne 2 nh as ne 0 the lemma follows 19 lemma 2 25 a codimension 3 space that is contained in a hyper plane of type h 1 contains nq n 2 qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 points of k with n 0 1 2 q 1 proof let be any codimension 3 space contained in a hyperplane of type h 1 and set x k if is contained in hyperplanes of type h 1 as well as of type h 2 there is nothing to proof because of the previous lemma if is contained in no hyperplane of type h 2 then cannot be contained in a codimension 2 space of type c 3 since through each codimension 2 space of type c 3 there passes a hyperplane of type h 2 which follows from m 13 0 furthermore since the number of h 2 hyperplanes containing a given codimension 2 space of type c 1 equals the number of h 1 hyperplanes containing it cannot be contained in a codimension 2 space of type c 1 such that h hence in h all codimension 2 spaces containing must be of type c 2 by the previous lemma we obtain that x q 1 qn 2 qn 1 1 qn 2 1 q 1 corollary 2 26 every hyperplane of type h 1 intersects k in the point set of a non singular hyperbolic quadric proof by the previous lemma the conditions of theorem 2 13 are satisfied in each hyperplane of type h 1 whenever n 2 if n 2 the corollary follows by the remark after theorem 1 6 lemma 2 27 every point of k is contained in at least one hyper plane of type h 1 proof let p be any point of k assume by way of contradiction that p is contained only in hyperplanes of type h 2 and h 3 then by counting pairs r h r k r 6 p p r h h a hyperplane we obtain l 2 h 2 1 q 2 n 1 q 1 l 2 h 3 1 q 2 n 1 q 1 1 q 2 n 1 1 q 1 with l 2 the number of hyperplanes of type h 2 containing p it follows that l 2 0 an absurdity theorem 2 28 the set k is the point set of a non singular parabolic quadric 20 proof let l be any line of pg 2 n q and suppose that l k x with x 3 suppose there would be no hyperplane of type h 1 containing l then if n 2 would be the number of hyperplanes of type h 2 containing l we obtain by counting pairs r h r k r l h a hyperplane containing r and l n 2 h 2 x q 2 n 1 1 q 1 n 2 h 3 x q 2 n 1 q 1 x q 2 n 2 1 q 1 this implies that n 2 0 a contradiction hence l is contained in a hyperplane of type h 1 corollary 2 26 implies that x q 1 consequently k is a 0 1 2 q 1 set in pg 2 n q by combining lemma 2 27 and corollary 2 26 we also see that each point of k is contained in a line m such that m k 2 hence k is non singular it follows that k satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 4 as k q 2 n 1 q 1 the theorem follows the main theorem 1 6 is now an immediate consequence of the orems 2 7 2 13 2 20 and 2 28
