the largest angle bisection procedure dan ismailescu joehyun kim kelvin kim and jeewoo lee abstract the largest angle bisection procedure is the operation which partitions a given triangle t into two smaller triangles by constructing the angle bisector of the largest angle of t applying the procedure to each of these two triangles produces a partition of t into four smaller triangles continuing in this manner after n iterations the initial triangle is divided into 2 n small triangles we prove that as n approaches infinity the diameters of all these 2 n triangles tend to 0 the smallest angle of all these triangles is bounded away from 0 and that with the exception of t being an isosceles right triangle the number of dissimilar triangles is unbounded 1 background and motivation for a given triangle locate the midpoint of the longest side and then connect this point to the vertex of the triangle opposite the longest side in other words in any given triangle draw the shortest median this construction is known as the longest edge bisection procedure and was first considered in 1975 by rosenberg and stenger 3 let 01 be a given triangle bisect 01 into two triangles 11 and 12 according to the procedure defined above next bisect each 1 i i 1 2 forming four new triangles 2 i i 1 2 3 4 continue in this fashion for every nonnegative integer n set tn ni 1 i 2 n so tn is the set of 2 n triangles created in the n th iteration please refer to figure 1 for an illustration of this process for n 3 figure 1 the longest edge bisection procedure the first three iterations ar x iv 1 90 8 02 74 9 v 2 m at h m g 2 9 s ep 2 01 9 define mn the mesh of tn to be the length of the longest side among the sides of all triangles in tn similarly let n be the smallest angle among the angles of the triangles in tn motivated by possible applications to the finite element method rosenberg and stenger con sidered the following problem 1 1 a is it true that n is bounded away from 0 as n b is it true that mn approaches 0 as n c does the family n 0 tn contains finitely many triangle types based on figure 1 it is reasonable to expect the answer to the first two questions to be affir mative indeed the first question was answered by rosenberg and stenger themselves theorem 1 2 3 with the notations above we have that n arctan sin 0 2 cos 0 0 2 where 0 is the smallest angle of the initial triangle 01 equality holds when 01 is an equilateral triangle as mentioned earlier the theorem is of interest if the mesh in the finite element approximation of solutions of differential equations is refined in the described manner the convergence criterion of the method is that the angles of the triangles do not tend to zero in 1890 schwarz 7 surprised the mathematical community by providing and explicit example of a situation in which triangles are used to approximate the area of a cylinder in this case the sum of the areas of the triangles may not converge to the area of the cylinder as the size of each triangle approaches zero and the number of triangles approaches infinity if the smallest interior angle of each triangle approaches zero the second question was answered by kearfott 2 a few years later theorem 1 3 2 let mn be the length of the longest side among the sides of all nth generation triangles obtained by applying the longest edge bisection procedure then mn m 0 3 2 bn 2 c and therefore mn 0 as n kearfott shows that m 2 m 0 3 2 and then uses induction this rate of convergence was successively improved by stynes 8 and by adler 1 who proved that mn m 0 3 2 n 2 if n is even and mn m 0 2 2 n 2 if n is odd with equality if the initial triangle is equilateral also both stynes and adler s techniques lead to an answer to the third question the union n 0 tn contains only finitely many triangle shapes up to similarity 2 for a given initial triangle 01 it would be interesting to find a formula for the number of different similarity classes generated by the longest edge bisection procedure applied to 01 and also an expression for the smallest n such that every triangle in n 0 tn is similar to some triangle in n k 0 tk at the time of this writing there are several known bounds but these seem rather weak for details the reader is referred to 5 6 2 the problem and summary of results in this paper we consider a different kind of bisection procedure question what if instead of bisecting the longest edge we bisect the largest angle for any given triangle locate the largest angle and then construct the angle bisector of this angle see figure 2 below figure 2 the first iteration of the largest angle bisection procedure in triangle abc we have for each of the two newly formed triangles construct the angle bisectors of their largest angles and so on as in the longest edge bisection scenario let tn be the set of 2 n triangles obtained after the nth iteration of this operation which we are going to call the largest angle bisection procedure also let mn the mesh of tn to be the length of the longest side among the sides of all triangles in tn and let n be the smallest angle among the angles of the triangles in tn 3 it is then natural to ask the same questions as in problem 1 1 for this new operation under the assumption of the largest angle bisection procedure we prove the following results n min 2 for all n 1 1 mn 0 as n 2 with one exception the set n 0 tn contains infinitely many similarity types 3 notice that results 1 and 2 are similar to the ones in the original problem while result 3 is different the remainder of the paper is dedicated to presenting proofs of these statements showing 1 is very easy and the proof of 3 is not too difficult either however proving 2 is quite challenging in fact throughout the next three sections we build the tools needed for showing that mn 0 let us start with a simple proof of 1 theorem 2 1 let 01 abc be an arbitrary triangle with angles apply the largest angle bisection procedure with abc as the initial triangle then for all n 1 we have that n min 2 proof each of the 2 n triangles obtained after the nth iteration has a largest angle let n denote the smallest such angle it is easy to see that 4 n 1 min n n 2 indeed if n 1 is obtained by bisecting the largest angle of some n th generation triangle then n 1 n 2 otherwise n 1 appears a base angle of some nth generation triangle hence n 1 n next we prove that 5 n 1 2 min n n 2 let mnp be the nth generation triangle one of whose offspring contains n 1 without loss of generality we can assume that n 1 is one of the angles of triangle mqp see figure 3 clearly qmp mqp which implies that n 1 max mqp mpq mqp it follows that n 1 mqp nmq mnq nmp 2 mnq n 2 n min n 2 n combining 4 and 5 we obtain that min n 1 n 1 2 min n n 2 from which we obtain that 6 n min n 1 n 1 2 min n 2 n 2 2 min 0 0 2 min 2 4 figure 3 n 1 max mqp mpq on the other hand it is easy to see that for all n 1 7 n min 2 indeed if min 2 then appears in some nth generation triangle for all n 0 since one never bisects angles which are less than 60 in this case it follows that n min 2 otherwise min 2 2 then 2 appears in some nth generation triangle for all n 1 for exactly the same reason as above again we obtain that n 2 min 2 this proves inequality 7 from 6 and 7 the statement of theorem 2 1 follows 3 showing that mn 0 initial considerations recall that in the longest edge bisection procedure it is relatively easy to prove that m 2 m 0 3 2 and in general that mn 2 mn 3 2 this eventually implies that mn m 0 3 2 bn 2 c thus mn 0 exponentially and the base is an absolute constant see figure 4 a note that such a result is not possible in the largest angle bisector procedure scenario indeed let abc be a very thin isosceles triangle then the decay of mn could be quite slow depending on the choice of abc see figure 4 b on the other hand define the shortest altitude bisection procedure to be analogous to the longest edge bisection and the largest angle bisection operation the only difference being that at each step we draw the altitude corresponding to the largest edge of the triangle rather than the the median or the angle bisector see figure 4 c it it easy to see that in this case we have at most two similarity classes moreover mn 0 exponentially indeed let abc be a triangle and let ad be the altitude corresponding to its longest edge focus of triangle acd first denote ad x cd y and ac z then 5 figure 4 mesh decay in three situations a the longest edge bisection b the largest angle bisection c the shortest altitude bisection construct de ac each of the two new triangles ade and cde is similar to acd and the corresponding similarity ratios are x z and y z respectively it follows that if one continues applying the shortest altitude bisection procedure to the subtriangles of acd the largest segment among all nth generation triangles cannot exceed z max x z y z n a similar reasoning applies to triangle abd this shows that mn approaches 0 exponentially but the base of this exponential depends on the initial triangle abc it is therefore reasonable to expect that in the largest angle bisection situation the mesh mn is going to behave in a similar fashion one only needs to select an appropriate quantity k abc 1 that depends on abc and which will eventually allow us to prove that mn m 0 kn denote bc a ac b and ab c the lengths of the sides of triangle abc further assume that a b c one natural choice for k would be the ratio a b c we are going to call this the aspect ratio of triangle abc and we will denote it by r abc by triangle inequality r abc 1 so everything is fine the problem however is that the aspect ratio of one of the triangles obtained by largest angle bisecting abc could be greater than the aspect ratio of abc this is going to create difficulties 6 when attempting to use induction so we may have to adjust our selection of k abc as follows k abc max r abc r abd r acd but even this is not sufficient as it may happen that there is a triangle in the second generation whose aspect ratio exceeds the aspect ratios of all its ancestors this is the case when abc is equilateral r abc 1 2 r abd r acd 3 1 0 732 while the 30 45 105 triangles obtained after the second iteration have aspect ratio sin 52 5 sec 7 5 0 8001 fortunately this is as far as we will have to go at the heart of the entire proof of mn 0 lies the following idea given a triangle abc let abd and acd be the children of abc obtained via the largest angle bisection procedure consider the quantity 0 max r abc r abd r acd 3 2 then all triangles obtained in the subsequent iterations have aspect ratio no greater than 0 the next two sections contain the technical details 4 one simple lemma definition 4 1 given a triangle abc with sides a b c and angles define the aspect ratio of abc as 8 r abc a b c hence the aspect ratio of a triangle is obtained by dividing the length of the longest side by the sum of the lengths of the other two sides obviously an easy consequence of triangle inequality is that for any triangle we have that r 1 on the other hand r 1 2 with equality if and only if the triangle is equilateral note that r abc can be expressed in terms of the angles of the triangle 9 r abc a b c sin sin sin 2 sin 2 cos 2 2 sin 2 cos 2 sin 2 sec 2 thus the aspect ratio of a triangle is the product between the sine function applied to half the largest angle and the secant function applied to half the difference of the other two angles due to the nature of the problem we are going to use 9 much more often than 8 7 lemma 4 2 let abc be a triangle with sides bc a ac b ab c with a b c denote the corresponding angles by and respectively obviously let ad be the angle bisector of angle bac then the following inequalities hold true ad bc 3 2 10 r abd r acd 11 proof it is easy to express the length of the angle bisector ad in terms of the side lengths a b and c we have ad 2 bc 2 bc b c 2 b c 2 a 2 a 2 bc b c 2 a a 2 a 2 a 2 1 4 3 3 4 this proves the first part since adc is the largest angle of triangle acd it follows that r acd sin 2 4 sec 2 4 for triangle bcd we have r bcd sin 2 4 sec 2 4 if 2 sin 2 sec 2 if 2 in the first case inequality 11 is equivalent to r acd r abd sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 2 4 cos 2 4 sin 2 4 cos 2 4 sin 2 sin sin 2 sin sin sin the last step being true since 90 in the second case inequality 11 can be written equivalently as r acd r abd sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 2 sec 2 sin 2 4 cos 2 4 sin 2 4 cos 2 4 sin 2 2 4 sin 2 2 4 sin 2 2 4 sin 2 2 4 sin 2 2 4 sin 2 2 4 0 2 sin 4 cos 2 0 which is obviously true since 180 this completes the proof 8 observation 4 3 the results proved in lemma 4 2 are going to be used frequently throughout the rest of the paper so it is useful to restate them as follows inequality 10 says that the angle bisector of the largest angle of a triangle cannot exceed 3 2 of the length of the largest side of the triangle inequality 11 states that of the two triangles created after applying the largest angle bisection procedure the one containing the smallest angle has the larger aspect ratio 5 the aspect ratio lemma we next introduce an important quantity for every n 0 let 12 rn max 1 i 2 n r ni that is rn is the maximum aspect ratio over all triangles obtained after the nth iteration of the largest angle bisection procedure with this notation we have under the premises of lemma 4 2 that r 0 r abc and by 11 r 1 r acd since these two quantities are going to be very frequently used in the sequel we list them below for easy future reference 13 r 0 r abc sin 2 sec 2 and r 1 r acd sin 2 4 sec 2 4 lemma 5 1 given a triangle 01 abc with angles let ad be the angle bisector of angle construct the angle bisectors of the largest angles in each of the triangles 11 abd and 12 acd let r 2 max r 21 r 22 r 23 r 24 be the largest of the aspect ratios of the four smaller triangles created after the second iteration of the largest angle bisection procedure then 14 r 2 max r 0 r 1 3 2 proof it is easy to see that adc is the largest angle of triangle acd see figure 2 hence in the second step one has to construct de the angle bisector of adc in triangle abd however it may be that either abd or adb is the largest angle we will therefore study two cases depending on whether 2 or 2 case 1 2 please refer to figure 5 we have that 2 2 from which 2 on the other hand 2 which implies 2 hence in this case 15 2 2 since baf 2 and bdf 2 it follows from 11 that r baf r bdf similarly since dae 2 and dce we have that dae dce and by using 11 again r cde r ade 9 this eliminates from further considerations two of the four triangles obtained in the second iteration in order to complete the proof of this case it would suffice to show that r abf r 1 and r cde r 1 recall that r 1 r acd figure 5 2 to prove the first inequality notice the following equivalences r abf r acd sin 2 4 sec 4 sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 2 4 cos 2 4 sin 2 4 cos 4 sin 4 sin 4 4 sin 4 sin 3 4 sin 3 4 sin 4 4 0 sin 2 4 cos 2 0 which is certainly true since 2 and 180 a similar approach proves the second inequality r cde r acd sin 3 2 8 sec 2 4 8 sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 3 2 8 cos 2 4 8 sin 2 4 8 cos 2 4 8 sin 5 2 4 8 sin 2 4 8 sin 3 6 4 8 sin 2 4 8 sin 3 6 4 8 sin 5 2 4 8 0 sin 2 8 cos 2 0 and that is true since 2 and 180 this proves 14 when 2 10 case 2 2 since 2 in order to divide triangle abd we have to consider the angle bisector from d see figure 6 this case is more difficult we need to further split the analysis into three subcases depending on whether 2 2 2 or 2 figure 6 2 subcase 2 1 2 using the fact that 2 and 11 we obtain that r bdf r adf and r cde r ade this removes triangles ade and adf from our analysis to prove 14 it would suffice to show that r cde r 0 and r bdf r 0 recall that r 0 r abc sin 2 sec 2 the first inequality is equivalent to r ced r abc sin 3 2 8 sec 2 4 8 sin 2 sec 2 sin 3 2 8 cos 4 4 8 sin 4 8 cos 2 4 8 sin 3 6 4 8 sin 3 2 4 8 sin 5 2 4 8 sin 3 2 4 8 sin 5 2 4 8 sin 3 6 4 8 0 sin 2 2 cos 2 0 and this is true since 2 and 180 for the second inequality we use the following equivalences r bdf r abc sin 3 2 8 sec 4 2 8 sin 2 sec 2 11 sin 3 2 8 cos 4 4 8 sin 4 8 cos 4 2 8 sin 3 4 2 8 sin 3 4 6 8 sin 5 4 2 8 sin 3 4 2 8 sin 5 4 2 8 sin 3 4 6 8 0 sin 2 8 cos 2 0 which is true since 2 2 and 180 this completes subcase 2 1 subcase 2 2 2 2 using the fact that 2 and 11 we obtain that r bdf r adf similarly using 2 and 11 we have that r cde r ade thus we can safely ignore triangles ade and bdf in this case to prove 14 it would suffice to show that r cde r 1 and r adf r 1 recall that r 1 r acd sin 2 4 sec 2 4 the first inequality is equivalent to r cde r acd sin 3 2 8 sec 2 4 8 sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 3 2 8 cos 2 4 8 sin 2 4 8 cos 2 4 8 sin 5 2 4 8 sin 2 4 8 sin 3 6 4 8 sin 2 4 8 sin 3 6 4 8 sin 5 2 4 8 0 sin 2 8 cos 2 0 which is true since 2 and 180 the second inequality is proved in a similar fashion r adf r acd sin 4 2 8 sec 2 8 sin 2 4 sec 2 4 sin 4 2 8 cos 2 4 8 sin 2 4 8 cos 2 8 sin 3 4 2 8 sin 4 6 8 sin 3 4 2 8 sin 4 2 8 sin 4 2 8 sin 4 6 8 0 sin 2 8 cos 2 0 and this is certainly valid since 2 2 and 180 180 this completes the proof of subcase 2 2 subcase 2 3 2 this is the trickiest subcase since 2 it follows from 11 that r bdf r adf and r cde r ade this removes triangles bdf and cde from further considerations to prove 14 it would suffice to show that r ade r adf 3 2 12 the first inequality is similar to the previous ones r adf r ade sin 4 2 8 sec 2 8 sin 2 4 8 cos 2 8 sin 4 2 8 cos 2 8 sin 2 4 8 cos 2 8 sin 2 2 2 8 sin 6 2 8 sin 2 2 2 8 sin 2 6 8 sin 3 4 sin 3 4 0 2 sin 4 cos 2 0 and this inequality is obvious since and 180 it remains to show that r adf 3 2 this proof is slightly different recall that 2 denote x and x y where both x y 0 since 2 it follows that x y hence denote x y z where z 0 to this end we have the following x y z 2 x y z and 2 x 2 y z where x 0 y 0 z 0 one can express r adf in terms of the new variables x y and z as follows 16 r adf sin 4 2 8 sec 2 8 sin 12 x 8 y 7 z 8 sec z 8 since 180 it follows that 5 x 4 y 3 z 180 which after multiplying both sides by 2 4 gives 12 x 9 6 y 7 2 z 432 from here we obtain that 12 x 8 y 7 z 8 12 x 9 6 y 7 2 z 8 54 on the other hand from 5 x 4 y 3 z 180 we readily obtain z 8 7 5 using the last two inequalities in 16 it follows that r adf sin 12 x 8 y 7 z 8 sec z 8 sin 54 sec 7 5 0 8159 3 2 as desired the proof of the last subcase is complete the main lemma is proved we are now in position to prove a useful corollary but let us first introduce a new quantity definition 5 2 with the notations above let 17 n max rn rn 1 3 2 corollary 5 3 the sequence n n 0 is decreasing that is 0 1 n n 1 proof notice that 0 1 is equivalent to max r 0 r 1 3 2 max r 1 r 2 3 2 and this is exactly what we proved in lemma 5 1 let us show that n 1 n obviously this is equivalent to proving that rn 2 max rn rn 1 3 2 13 let t be the triangle of maximum aspect ratio obtained after the n 2 nd iteration in other words r t rn 2 triangle t has a parent triangle t 1 that was obtained after the n 1 st iteration on its turn t 1 has a parent triangle t that was created after the n th iteration let us denote by t 2 be the other triangle created by applying the largest angle bisection procedure to triangle t one can think of t 1 and t 2 as siblings both offsprings of t also t 1 is the parent of t while t 2 is the uncle of t note that the position of t within t is irrelevant now by lemma 5 1 it follows that r t max r t r t 1 r t 2 3 2 but clearly r t rn r t 1 rn 1 and r t 2 rn 1 as t is an n th generation triangle while both t 1 and t 2 were obtained after the n 1 st iteration it follows that rn 2 r t max r t r t 1 r t 2 3 2 max rn rn 1 3 2 which is exactly what we wanted to prove 6 the mesh size lemma in this section we prove one intermediate result involving mn the length of the longest side of all triangles obtained after applying the largest angle bisection procedure n times lemma 6 1 with the notations above for every n 0 we have that 18 mn 2 mn n proof consider first the case n 0 we want to show that m 2 m 0 max r 0 r 1 3 2 consider the triangle abc with sides a b c and angles thus m 0 a let ad be the angle bisector of angle as noticed earlier in 11 r 1 r acd we have two cases depending on whether 2 or 2 see figure 7 in triangle ade we have that ad opposes the largest angle of 4 2 see also figures 5 or 6 for a better view hence ad de and ad ae and since by 10 we have that ad bc 3 2 we can safely ignore segments de ae and ad from future considerations in triangle cde we have that cd ce since the angle opposite to cd is larger using the angle bisector theorem in triangle abc we have that cd m 0 cd bc ac ab ac bc ab ac a b c r 0 and thus all the sides of triangles ade and cde satisfy the required inequality let us next look at the children of triangle abd notice first that from the angle bisector theorem in abc we have that bd cd ab ac 1 hence bd cd 14 figure 7 a 2 2 in the case when 2 it is not hard to show that af ae and bf ce for the first inequality we use the law of sines in triangles adf and ade we have af sin afd ad sin adf af sin 2 4 ad sin 4 2 4 ae sin aed ad sin ade ae sin 2 4 ad sin 2 4 4 combining the above equalities the desired inequality is equivalent to af ae sin 2 4 sin 2 4 4 sin 2 4 sin 4 2 4 cos 2 cos 3 2 cos 2 cos 3 2 sin sin which is true since 90 the inequality bf ce is much easier to prove using the angle bisector theorem again in both triangles abd and acd we obtain 19 bf ce af ae bd cd 1 1 1 since we proved earlier that ce cd m 0 r 0 the proof of the first case is complete it remains to see what happens if 2 recall that we already dealt with the subtriangles of acd of the five segments appearing among the sides of triangles abf and bdf af and bf are clearly shorter than ad and we already know that ad m 0 3 2 segment bf is the angle bisector corresponding to the largest side of triangle abd hence by using 10 again we have that bf ad 3 2 m 0 3 4 done we showed earlier that bd cd m 0 r 0 finally ab ad since abd is the largest one in triangle abd it follows that m 2 m 0 max r 0 r 1 3 2 as desired 15 the proof of the general inequality mn 2 mn n follows the same steps as the proof of corollary 5 3 let t be the triangle of maximum edge length obtained after the n 2 nd iteration in other words m t mn 2 triangle t has a parent triangle t 1 that was obtained after the n 1 st iteration on its turn t 1 has a parent triangle t that was created after the n th iteration let us denote by t 2 be the other triangle created by applying the largest angle bisection procedure to triangle t one can think of t 1 and t 2 as siblings both offsprings of t also t 1 is the parent of t while t 2 is the uncle of t the first part of the proof implies that m t m t max r t r t 1 r t 2 3 2 but clearly r t rn r t 1 rn 1 and r t 2 rn 1 as t is an n th generation triangle while both t 1 and t 2 were obtained after the n 1 st iteration also we obviously have m t mn it follows that mn 2 m t m t max r t r t 1 r t 2 3 2 mn max rn rn 1 3 2 mn n which is exactly what we wanted to prove 7 proofs of the last two theorems we are finally in position to prove that mn 0 as n theorem 7 1 let abc be any triangle use the largest angle bisection procedure n times with abc as the starting triangle let mn and rn be the longest side and respectively the largest aspect ratio over all n th generation triangles then mn m 0 max r 0 r 1 3 2 b n 2 c proof recall that we introduced the notation max r 0 r 1 3 2 0 using lemma 6 1 and corollary 5 3 repeatedly we have m 2 n m 2 n 2 2 n 2 m 2 n 2 0 m 2 n 2 m 2 n 4 2 n 4 m 2 n 4 0 m 2 m 0 0 multiplying term by term and simplifying we obtain that m 2 n m 0 n 0 since m 2 n 1 m 2 n we also have m 2 n 1 m 0 n 0 this proves the theorem finally we prove that with one exception the number of similarity types obtained via re peated application of the largest angle bisection procedure is unbounded as before let tn be the set of 2 n triangles in the n th generation denote by 20 an x x is an angle of some triangle in tn 16 we intend to prove that unless the initial triangle is an isosceles right triangle the set n 0 an is infinite let abc be a triangle with angles apply the largest angle bisection procedure with abc as the starting triangle as noticed in the proof of theorem 2 1 angle is never bisected so it survives through the entire process unscathed let n be the n th generation triangle that contains the angle it turns out one can find an explicit expression for the angles of n for every n 0 let us introduce the jacobsthal sequence jn n 0 0 1 1 3 5 11 21 43 defined by the recurrence relation jn 1 jn 2 jn 1 j 0 0 j 1 1 the following equalities are easy to derive 21 jn 2 n 1 n 3 jn jn 1 2 n let us prove the following lemma 7 2 let n be the triangle in tn that contains as one of its angles then for every n 1 the other two angles of n are 22 n jn 1 2 n jn 2 n 1 and n jn 2 n jn 1 2 n 1 moreover n n and n proof notice first that since jn n 0 is a nondecreasing sequence the inequality n n is immediate also n jn 1 2 n jn 2 n 1 jn 1 2 n jn 2 n 1 jn 1 2 jn 2 n 2 n jn 2 n we use induction on n if n 1 then 1 acd 1 2 and 1 2 see figure 2 suppose triangle n has angles n n and since n is the largest angle of n we bisect this angle to obtain n 1 and one other triangle but we can ignore that one then it is easy to see that the angles of n 1 are n 2 n n 2 and as shown in the figure below figure 8 bisecting n 17 it is now just a matter of simple algebra to verify that n 2 n jn 1 2 jn 2 n 1 jn 2 jn 1 2 n jn 2 2 n 1 jn 1 2 n n 1 and n 2 n 1 this completes the proof we need one more result lemma 7 3 let and be two real positive numbers such that 6 2 for n 1 define 23 n jn 1 2 n jn 2 n 1 then for all p 6 q we have p 6 q proof notice the extra condition 6 2 suppose that p 6 q but p q then we obtain 24 p q jp 1 2 p jp 2 p 1 jq 1 2 q jq 2 q 1 jp 1 2 p jq 1 2 q jq 2 q 1 jp 2 p 1 on the other hand we have that 25 2 jp jp 1 2 p 1 jq jq 1 2 q 1 jp 1 2 p jq 1 2 q 1 2 jq 2 q 1 jp 2 p 1 since p 6 q we can divide equations 24 and 25 term by term to obtain that 2 but this contradicts the hypothesis the proof is complete we can now show that the set n 0 an defined in 20 is with one exception infinite if 6 2 then by combining lemma 7 2 and lemma 7 3 we have that the largest angles of triangles n are all different and thus we are done if 2 then the initial triangle abc is bisected into two triangles abd and acd triangle acd has angles 2 and it is similar to abc triangle abd has angles 180 2 if the largest angle of this triangle is different from twice the middle angle then we apply the reasoning above to abd and we are done the only cases left to consider are those when either 2 180 2 or 180 2 2 the first case implies 72 and therefore 144 which is clearly impossible since 180 the second case gives 45 and consequently 90 45 in this case it is obvious that the largest angle bisection procedure keeps producing isosceles right triangles so we have only one type of triangle up to similarity we thus proved the following theorem 7 4 let abc be an arbitrary triangle if abc is an isosceles right triangle then all triangles obtained via the largest angle bisection procedure are similar to abc otherwise the number of different similarity types is at least as large as the number of iterations references 1 a adler on the bisection method for triangles
