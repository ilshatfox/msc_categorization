embedding cycles in finite planes felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega abstract we define and study embeddings of cycles in finite affine and pro jective planes we show that for all k 3 k q 2 a k cycle can be embedded in any affine plane of order q we also prove a similar result for finite projec tive planes for all k 3 k q 2 q 1 a k cycle can be embedded in any projective plane of order q 1 introduction our work concerns substructures in finite affine and projective planes in order to explain the questions we consider we will need the following definitions and notations any graph theoretic notion not defined here may be found in bolloba s 1 all of our graphs are finite simple and undirected if g v e v g e g is a graph then the order of g is v g v the number of vertices of g and the size of g is e g e the number of edges in g each edge of g is thought as a 2 subset of v an edge x y will be denoted by xy or yx a vertex v is incident with an edge e if v e we say that a graph g v e is a subgraph of g and denote it by g g if v v and e e if g g we will also say that g contains g for a vertex v v n v ng v u v uv e denotes the neighborhood of v and deg v degg v n v the degree of v if the degrees of all vertices of g are equal to d then g is called d regular for a graph f we say that g is f free if g contains no subgraph isomorphic to f for k 2 any graph isomorphic to the graph with a vertex set x 1 xk and an edge set x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 xk 1 xk is called an x 1 xk path or a k path and we denote it by pk the length of a path is its number of edges for k 3 the graph with a vertex set x 1 xk and edge set x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 xk 1 xk xkx 1 is called a k cycle and it is often denoted by c or ck any subgraph of g isomorphic to a k cycle is called a k cycle in g the girth of a graph g containing cycles denoted by g g g is the length of a shortest cycle in g let v g a b be a partition of v g and let every edge of g have one endpoint in a and another in b then g is called bipartite and we denote it by g a b e if a m and b n then we refer to g as an m n bipartite graph all notions of incidence geometry not defined here may be found in 2 a partial plane p l i is an incidence structure with a set of points p a set of lines l and a symmetric binary relation of incidence i p l l p such that any two distinct points are on at most one line and every line contains at least two points note that we have used p for two different object as of now to denote a path 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 05 51 secondary 20 key words and phrases graph

denote the points on a partial plane the usage of this symbol should be clear from the context the definition implies that any two lines share at most one point we will often identify lines with the sets of points on them we say that a partial plane p l i is a subplane of denoted if p p l l and i i if there is a line containing two distinct points x and y we denote it by xy or y x for k 3 we define a k gon as a partial plane with k distinct points p 1 p 2 pk with k distinct lines p 1 p 2 p 2 p 3 pk 1 pk pkp 1 and with point and line being incident if and only if the point is on the line a subplane of isomorphic to a k gon is called a k gon in the levi graph of a partial plane is its point line bipartite incidence graph levi levi p l e where pl e if and only if point p is on line l the levi graph of any partial plane is 4 cycle free clearly there exists a bijection between the set of all k gons in and the set of 2 k cycles in levi a projective plane of order q 2 denoted q is a partial plane with every point on exactly q 1 lines every line containing exactly q 1 points and having four points such that no three of them are collinear it is easy to argue that q contains q 2 q 1 points and q 2 q 1 lines let nq q 2 q 1 it is easy to show that a partial plane is a projective plane of order q if and only if its levi graph is a q 1 regular graph of girth 6 and diameter 3 projective planes q are known to exist only when the order q is a prime power if q 9 is a prime power but not a prime there are always non isomorphic planes of order q and their number grows fast with q let pg 2 q denote the classical projective plane of prime power order q which can be modeled as follows points of pg 2 q are 1 dimensional subspaces in the 3 dimensional vector space over the finite field of q elements lines of pg 2 q are 2 dimensional subspaces of the vector space and a point is incident to a line if it is a subspace of it removing a line from a projective plane and removing its points from all other lines yields a partial plane known as an affine plane the line removed is often referred to as the line at infinity and it is denoted by l conversely a projective plane of order q can be obtained from an affine plane of order q i e having q 1 lines through each point by adding a line at infinity to it which can be thought of as a set of q 1 new points called points at infinity which is in bijective correspondence with the set of parallel classes also called the set of all slopes of lines in the affine plane we will use q to denote a projective plane of order q and q for affine planes of order q the following problem stated in terms of set systems appears in erdo s 5 problem 1 is every finite partial linear space embedded in a finite projective plane it is possible that the question was asked before as it was well known that every partial linear space embeds in some infinite projective plane by a process of free closure due to hall 10 for recent results related to the question see moorhouse and williford 16 rephrased in terms of graphs problem 1 is the following problem 1 is every finite bipartite graph without 4 cycles a subgraph of the levi graph of a finite projective plane thinking about cycles in levi graphs of projective planes we introduced the following notion of embedding of a graph into a partial plane and found it useful embedding cycles in finite planes 3 let g be a graph and let p l i be a partial plane let f v g e g p l be an injective map such that f v g p f e g l and for every vertex x and edge e of g their incidence in g implies the incidence of point f x and line f e in we call such a map f an embedding of g in and if it exists we say that g embeds in and write g if g then adjacent vertices of g are mapped to collinear points of note that if g q then v g nq e g nq and degg x q 1 for all x v g a cycle containing all vertices of a graph is called a hamiltonian cycle of the graph and if such exists the graph is called a hamiltonian graph similarly if q contains an nq gon we call it hamiltonian a graph g containing k cycles of all possible lengths 3 k v g is called pancyclic similarly we say that q is pangonal if it contains k gons for all 3 k nq the latter is equivalent to levi q containing all 2 k cycles for 3 k nq clearly if g q a k cycle in g corresponds to a k gon in q which in turn corresponds to a 2 k cycle in levi q from now on we choose to be less pedantic and will feel free to use graph theoretic and geometric terms interchangeably for example we will say point for a vertex of a graph vertex for a point of a partial plane and we will speak about path and cycle in a plane etc determining whether a graph is hamiltonian or more generally understanding what cycles it contains is one of the central problems in graph theory and it has been a subject of active research for many years the existence of hamiltonian cycles in q or levi q or its pancyclicity was addressed by several researchers the presence of k gons of some small lengths in q is easy to establish in 14 the authors presented explicit formuli for the numbers of distinct k gons in every projective plane of order q for k 3 4 5 6 very recently and in a very impressive way voropaev 21 extended this list to k 7 8 9 10 the existence of very special hamiltonian cycles in pg 2 q is a celebrated result of singer 19 these cycles are often referred to as the singer cycles in pg 2 q for q p prime schme ichel 18 showed by explicit constructions that pg 2 p is pancyclic and that the hamiltonian cycles he constructed were different from singer cycles demarco and lazebnik 4 constructed a hamiltonian cycle in a hall plane of order p 2 most of the known sufficient conditions for the existence of hamiltonian cycles in graphs are effective for rather dense graphs graphs of order n and size greater that cn 2 for some positive constant c see a survey by gould 9 levi graphs of projective planes are much sparser being q 1 regular their size is 1 2 2 o 1 n 3 2 for n and that is why most techniques of proving hamiltonicity of graphs do not apply to them for the same reason upper bounds on the tura n number of a 2 k cycle see e g pikhurko 17 and and references therein are not effective for proving the existence of 2 k cycles in levi graphs of projective planes for most values of k as k may depend on q a new approach for establishing hamiltonicity and the existence of shorter cycles came from probabilistic techniques and studies of cycles in random and pseudo random graphs we omit the definition see e g thomasson 20 chung graham and wilson 3 frieze 7 and frieze and krivelevich 8 in 12 krivelevich and sudakov explored relations between pseudo randomness and hamiltonicity in regular non bipartite graphs some other results related to 4 felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega hamiltonicity and pancyclicity appeared in recent publications by keevash and sudakov 11 krivelevich lee and sudakov 13 and lee and sudakov 15 it is likely that proofs in these papers can be modified to give results for bipar tite levi graphs of projective planes but the requirement on the order of the graph to be sufficiently large as is the case in the aforementioned papers will remain in this paper we establish the pancyclicity of q and q for all q and our proof is constructive our main results follow theorem 1 let q be an affine plane of order q 2 then ck q for all k 3 k q 2 theorem 2 let q be a projective plane of order q 2 and nq q 2 q 1 then ck q for all k 3 k nq we now proceed to give a construction for paths and cycles in any finite affine or projective plane we start with a remark that will be very useful later on remark 1 let p 1 p 2 pk and q 1 q 2 qn be two disjoint in terms of points and lines paths embedded in q or q then if the line pkqn has not been used in these embeddings we can create the following embedding for a path on n k vertices p 1 p 2 pk qn qn 1 q 2 q 1 here the symbol pk qn indicates that the line joins the points pk and qn moreover if the line m q 1 p 1 is still available then we get a cycle of length k n embedded in q or q our main technique in the next two sections will be to construct paths that can be combined using remark 1 to create cycles of any length 2 cycles in affine planes let q be an affine plane of order q and let o be any point of the plane we label the q 1 lines through o by l 0 l 1 lq for any given point q q we use li q to denote the line parallel to li that passes through q let a mod q 1 denote the remainder of the division of a by q 1 pick any point p 0 on l 0 different from o let p 1 be the point of intersection of l 2 p 0 and l 1 let p 2 be the point of intersection of l 3 p 1 and l 2 etc in general let pi be the point of intersection of li 1 mod q 1 pi 1 and li for all i 1 2 q since o 6 pi li for all i 1 2 q then all these points are distinct similarly the lines pi 1 pi are in different parallel classes for all i 1 2 q it follows that by joining the points pi 1 and pi for all i 1 2 q we obtain a path on q 1 vertices denote this path by pp 0 embedding cycles in finite planes 5 o q 0 q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 l 0 l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 pp 0 pq 0 figure 1 two vertex edge disjoint paths pp 0 and pq 0 for q 4 lemma 1 let p 0 6 q 0 l 0 then the paths pp 0 and pq 0 share neither points nor lines proof let pp 0 p 0 p 1 pq pq 0 q 0 q 1 qq clearly pi 6 qj for i 6 j we also know that p 0 6 q 0 so assume that pi qi for some i 1 q so that pj 6 qj for all 0 j i it follows that li 1 mod q 1 pi 1 li pi qi li 1 mod q 1 qi 1 li which forces li 1 mod q 1 pi 1 li 1 mod q 1 qi 1 and thus pi 1 qi 1 a contradiction finally it is easy to see that if pp 0 and pq 0 shared a line then they would also share a point lemma 2 we can partition the points of q o into s cycles c 1 cs where the length of ci is ti q 1 for some integer ti 1 i s q 1 1 t 1 ts and t 1 ts q 1 proof if we label the points on l 0 o by x 1 x 2 xq 1 by lemma 1 px 1 px 2 pxq 1 yields a partition of the points of q o into q 1 disjoint paths each having q 1 vertices if q 3 then we have at least two such paths and we may want to connect them to create longer paths and or cycles note that in the paths pxi no line parallel to l 1 has been used now if we consider a path pp 0 then the line l 1 pq intersects l 0 at a point q which can never be equal to o otherwise l 1 pq l 1 and thus pq l 1 lq o a contradiction this point q is uniquely determined by p 0 and the way we do this construction of course if q p 0 then we get a q 1 cycle if q 6 p 0 then we re label q q 0 and consider the path pq 0 this will give us a path with 2 q 1 vertices namely p 0 p 1 pq q 0 q 1 qq we then proceed to find r 0 l 1 qq l 0 if r 0 p 0 we get a cycle of length 2 q 1 if r 0 q 0 then we get that q 0 is on two lines that are parallel to l 1 namely l 1 qq and l 1 pq this forces pq and qq to coincide but this is impossible because of lemma 1 it follows that we either get a cycle of length 2 q 1 or we can keep extending this path using pr 0 since l 0 contains finitely many points this process must end moreover it is impossible to close this cycle at any point that 6 felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega is not p 0 as this would yield the same contradiction we obtained above when we assumed r 0 q 0 hence by combining paths we can construct cycles of length t q 1 for some positive integer t these are the cycles ci we wanted to find in order to prove theorem 1 we will need to construct paths out of the cycles c 1 c 2 cs firstly we define terms and set notation that will be necessary for the rest of this article definition 1 for every i 1 s let pi i 1 be an arbitrary point on li 1 ci note that there are ti such points and let pi i be its neighbor on li we construct two different types of paths in ci all of them start at pi i 1 and 1 the next vertex is pi i the other vertices in the path are easily determined from these first two or 2 the next vertex is the neighbor of pi i 1 in ci that is on the line li 2 mod q 1 the other vertices in the path are easily determined from these first two we will say that the first path is a positive path and that the second is a negative path lemma 3 k cycles can be embedded in q for all 3 k t 1 q 1 proof if q 2 3 the result is immediate we assume q 4 for the rest of this proof the cycle c 1 is of length t 1 q 1 and so we only need to construct k cycles with 3 k t 1 q 1 if k 1 mod q 1 then since k 3 we consider a positive k path in c 1 starting at p 1 0 as k 1 mod q 1 this path ends at some q 0 l 0 and q 0 6 p 0 connect p 0 to q 0 using l 0 to get a k cycle if k 2 mod q 1 and 2 k t 1 q 1 then t 1 1 consider a positive k 2 path p in c 1 starting at p 1 0 this path ends at a point pq lq since k t 1 q 1 then there is a 2 path in c 1 disjoint from p of the form qq 1 qq with qi li for i q 1 q consider the following k cycle o l 0 p 0 pq 1 in p lq 1 qq 1 qq lq o where pq 1 lq 1 was the neighbor of pq in p if k 6 1 2 mod q 1 then since 3 k t 1 q 1 take a positive k 1 path in c 1 starting at p 1 0 this path will end on a point pk 2 lk 2 connect p 0 and pk 2 to o using l 0 and lk 2 respectively to get a k cycle we now focus on the construction of k cycles for k t 1 q 1 in order to do that we will use the following construction construction 1 let m t 1 t 2 tm we will construct a m q 1 path pm out of the cycles c 1 c 2 cm where 2 m s recall that s q 1 for each i 1 m 1 we connect ci with ci 1 by joining pi i with pi 1 i using li then for all i 1 m we take the pi i 1 pi i path in ci having ti q 1 vertices and construct the following path p 1 0 p 1 1 in c 1 l 1 p 2 1 p 2 2 in c 2 l 2 lm 1 pm m 1 pm m in cm embedding cycles in finite planes 7 since no vertices were eliminated or added and all new lines are distinct and through o none used in the construction of the ci s this construction yields a p 1 0 pm m path with m q 1 vertices cm c 3 c 2 c 1 p 1 1 p 1 0 p 3 3 l 3 pm m lm 1 pm m 1 p 2 1 p 3 2 l 1 p 2 2 l 2 p 1 q figure 2 construction of pm note that o has not been used in the construction of pm and that neither have the lines lm lq and l 0 finally we will denote the neighbor of p 1 0 in pm which is a point on lq by p 1 q we now prove theorem 1 proof of theorem 1 in this proof we follow the notation introduced in construc tion 1 if q 2 the existence of 3 and 4 cycles is obvious if q 3 pancyclicity can be easily verified in what follows we assume q 4 though most arguments hold for q 3 we want to embed all possible k cycles in q that have not been already discussed in lemma 3 for any given k we write it as either k s q 1 k s q 1 1 q 2 or k m q 1 r for some m 1 s 1 and 0 r tm 1 q 1 note that the case m 0 was taken care of in lemma 3 firstly we can join p 1 0 and ps s with o using the lines l 0 and ls respectively to obtain a cycle of length s q 1 1 note that this grants hamiltonicity moreover if we cut ps short one vertex and thus we ask it to end at p 1 q then joining the endpoints of this new path to o yields a s q 1 cycle from now on let k m q 1 r for some m 1 s 1 and some 0 r tm 1 q 1 our strategy for constructing a k cycle in q will be to connect a path on cm 1 note that m s to o and pm the paths on cm 1 we will consider always starts at pm 1 m which will be connected to pm m pm by using lm we consider several cases a if r 3 mod q 1 we first get a positive path on r 1 vertices on cm 1 that 8 felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega cm 1 pm p 1 0 pm 1 m p 1 q lm pm m figure 3 connecting pm and cm 1 ends on a point qm 1 lm 1 we then join p 1 0 with o using l 0 qm 1 with o using lm 1 the result is a cycle of the desired length b if r 1 mod q 1 we consider a negative r 2 path on cm 1 that ends on a point qm 1 lm 1 we finish the construction as in case a c if r 2 mod q 1 or r 0 mod q 1 then we cut pm short one vertex so it ends at p 1 q we get the path in cm 1 as in part a for r 2 mod q 1 or b for r 0 mod q 1 we close the cycle by joining p 1 q with o using lq qm 1 with o using lm 1 d if r i mod q 1 where 4 i q we want to get a positive r 2 path on cm 1 starting at pm 1 m this path would end at a point on lm i 2 mod q 1 i if i q 2 m then m i 2 q and thus this path on r 1 vertices ends at a point qm i 2 lm i 2 we then get a cycle of the desired length by joining p 1 0 with o using l 0 qm i 2 with o using lm i 2 ii if i q 3 m then m i 2 q 1 and thus this path on r 1 vertices ends at a point qt 2 lt 2 where 0 t 2 m 3 we next shift this path to make it start at pm 1 m 1 instead of pm 1 m and add a vertex to make it a path on r vertices now this path ends at qt lt where 2 t m 1 since the line lt is needed to construct pm we will need to modify the construction of pm by connecting the cycles c 1 c 2 cm 1 in the following way c 1 l 1 c 2 l 2 lt 2 ct 1 lt 1 ct lt 1 ct 1 lt 2 lm 1 cm 1 note that this can be done for all 2 t m 1 and that doing this means that pt t is a loose vertex not used in pm anymore now we connect this path to the path on cm 1 that ends on qt the line lt is now free and thus it can be used to close the cycle at o we get the cycle o l 0 c 1 l 1 lm cm lm 1 pm 1 m 1 qt lt o this cycle has length m q 1 1 r 1 m q 1 r k the minus one is because of the loose vertex the plus one is because of o 3 cycles in projective planes in this section we will study embeddings of cycles in finite projective planes let q denote a projective plane of order q we think about q as obtained from an embedding cycles in finite planes 9 affine plane q by adding a line denoted consisting of points i for i 0 q using the notations from the previous section each of these points i is incident with only the following lines line li of q and the q 1 lines of q parallel to li the next statement follows immediately from our work in section 2 corollary 1 let q be a projective plane of order q then a k cycle can be embedded in q for all k 3 q 2 therefore in order to prove the pancyclicity of q we need to show that k cycles can be embedded into q for all k q 2 1 k q 2 q 1 at this point one would expect to use heavily the pancyclicity of q for the construction of long cycles in q but we could not make use of this idea instead we base our construction methods on using the cycles ci in similar ways to that in the proof of theorem 1 let w 1 be any of the vertices of c 1 that are on lq and let v 1 l 1 w 1 l 0 it follows that v 1 is a vertex of c 1 and that l 1 w 1 is an edge of c 1 similarly for 2 i s let wi li 2 be a vertex of ci and vi li wi li 1 hence vi is a vertex of ci and li wi is an edge of ci for each i 1 s let vi wi denote the viwi path in ci different from the edge viwi next we define ui to be the vertex of ci that is on lq and that is the closest to vi when we move from vi towards wi along ci by viui we denote the subpath of vi wi having q i 2 vertices and endpoints vi and ui q 0 o vi wi wi vi ui viui i 2 i 1 figure 4 paths vi wi and viui 2 0 1 v 1 w 1 w 2 v 2 o v 3 w 3 q 2 q 1 q 3 figure 5 paths v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 and v 3 w 3 10 felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega recall that i li we now construct a path p for s 2 by connecting wi with i using li wi which is not an edge of vi wi and connecting i with vi 1 using li thus p is the path v 1 w 1 l 1 w 1 1 l 1 v 2 w 2 l 2 w 2 2 s 1 ls 1 vs ws for s 1 p is obtained from the cycle c 1 by removing the edge v 1 w 1 note that for all s p has q 2 1 s 1 q 2 s 2 vertices the lines ls lq l 0 ls ws and have not been used in the construction of p and neither have the points s q 0 and o 2 0 1 v 1 w 1 w 2 v 2 o v 3 w 3 p q 2 q 1 q 3 figure 6 paths v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 v 3 w 3 joined into a path p its endpoints are v 1 and w 3 0 o ws p ws 1 vs v 1 s 3 s 2 s 1 q q 1 s figure 7 a simple diagram of the path p now we begin our construction of k cycles in q of lengths from q 2 1 to q 2 q 1 by using the path p and or modifications of it recall that s denotes the number of all cycles ci or of all paths vi wi and that 1 s q 1 we will first construct cycles of length between q 2 1 to q 2 s 2 and then the ones that are longer than q 2 s 2 lemma 4 cycles of length ranging from q 2 1 to q 2 s 2 can be embedded in q proof using the path p we can construct embedding cycles in finite planes 11 1 a cycle of length q 2 s 2 v 1 ws in p ls ws s ls o lq q 0 l 0 v 1 2 a cycle of length q 2 s 1 v 1 ws in p ls ws s q lq o l 0 v 1 and 3 a cycle of length q 2 s v 1 ws in p ls ws s 0 l 0 v 1 note that the lines ls lq have not been used in the construction of this last cycle and neither have the points s 1 q and o we will denote this cycle by c if q 1 2 s then for every q s 1 i s let us modify c in the following way delete q i 1 vertices of the path viui all except ui connect i 1 with o recall that i 1 was connected to vi in c via li 1 connect o with ui using lq this yields the cycle ui i 1 in c li 1 o lq ui which has length q 2 s q i 1 1 q 2 q s i since q s 1 i s the length of this cycle ranges between q 2 1 and q 2 s q s note that if q 1 2 s then q 2 s q s q 2 1 so for all relevant values of s we have been able to construct cycles with lengths ranging from q 2 1 to q 2 s q s next we want to construct k cycles for q 2 s q s k q 2 s in order to do that we need to set more notation let us relabel the vertices in the path vsus by vs ps 1 ps pq 1 pq where pi li for all i s q note that pq us for s 1 i q let pipj denote the subpath of vsus joining pi and pj note that a cycle of length q 2 s q s vertices may be obtained using i s in the previous construction we want to use a similar construction to get a cycle of length q 2 s q s 1 we modify c by replacing its subpath ps 1 pq 1 by a path s 1 ls 1 o lq 1 pq 1 pq leading to the following cycle of length q 2 s q s 1 us s 1 in c ls 1 o lq 1 pq 1 pq note that we are using here that s q 1 now to create cycles of length larger than q 2 s q s 1 we use the following strategy 12 felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega for every i s q 1 we modify c by connecting pi with o and o with pq to get the cycle pq pi in c li o lq pq which has length q 2 s q i 1 1 q 2 s q i 2 since i s q 1 then the length of this cycle ranges from q 2 s q s 2 to q 2 s 1 corollary 2 with the same notation used in lemma 4 if s q 1 then q is pancyclic now we want to construct cycles longer than q 2 s 2 for when 1 s q 1 lemma 5 for every 1 s q 1 cycles of length ranging from q 2 s 3 to q 2 q 1 can be embedded in q proof just as we did in the proof of lemma 4 the idea is to modify the path p to get the desired cycles hence we will use the same notation introduced earlier in this section including that used in the proof of lemma 4 we first eliminate the edge ls 1 vs from p and connect ws with vs using ls ws this gives us a path p that has the same length of p q 2 s 2 vertices with endpoints v 1 and ps q 1 0 q s o ws p ws 1 vs v 1 ps s 3 s 2 s 1 figure 8 the path p note that the lines ls lq l 0 ls 1 vs and have not been used neither have the points s q 0 and o if we now eliminate the edge ls 2 ps and instead connect ps with ps 1 using ps ls 1 vs s 1 ls 1 ps 1 we get a path g 1 in q 2 s 2 1 vertices one more than p we may close this path into a cycle by v 1 l 0 0 s ls ps ls 1 vs s 1 ls 1 ps 1 v 1 in p which has length q 2 s 1 2 q 2 s 1 embedding cycles in finite planes 13 now we eliminate the edge ls 3 mod q 1 ps 1 from g 1 and instead connect ps 1 with ps 2 using ps 1 ls 2 ps s 2 ls 2 ps 2 this yields a path g 2 in q 2 s 2 2 vertices two more than p we may close this path into a cycle by using p as above v 1 l 0 0 s ls ps ls 1 vs s 1 ls 1 ps 1 ls 2 ps s 2 ls 2 ps 2 v 1 in p which has length q 2 s 2 q 2 s 2 in general for 1 i q s and thus s i 1 q 1 given a path gi of length q 2 s 2 i constructed as above we can eliminate the edge ls i 2 mod q 1 ps i from gi and instead connect ps i with ps i 1 using ps i ls i 1 ps i 1 s i 1 ls i 1 ps i 1 this yields a path gi 1 in q 2 s 2 i 1 vertices i 1 more than p we may close this path into a cycle as we did above v 1 l 0 0 s ls ps ls 1 vs s 1 ls 1 ps 1 ls 2 ps s 2 ps i ls i 1 ps i 1 s i 1 ls i 1 ps i 1 v 1 in p which has length q 2 s i 1 this will yield cycles of length up to q 2 q the line not used in the q 2 q cycle q is l 0 pq 1 and the point not used is o figure 9 gives an idea of what q looks like ws o s q v 1 vs ws 1 s 2 0 pq 1 pq s 3 q 1 q s 1 figure 9 cycle q in order to construct a q 2 q 1 cycle we use q and modified it as follows eliminate which connected l 0 and ls eliminate lq 1 which connected q 1 and pq 1 eliminate lq which connected q and pq connect s and q using 14 felix lazebnik keith e mellinger and oscar vega connect q 1 and o using lq 1 connect pq and o using lq connect q 1 and 0 using l 0 pq 1 we get the following hamiltonian cycle o ws ws 1 vs v 1 pq 1 pq s 2 s 1 s q 1 s 3 0 q figure 10 a hamiltonian cycle proof of theorem 2 it follows from lemmas 4 and 5 we wish to conclude this paper with a conjecture let s 1 and n 2 a finite partial plane g p l i is called a generalized n gon of order s if its levi graph is s 1 regular has diameter n and has girth 2 n it is known that a generalized n gons of order s exists only for n 2 3 4 6 see feit and higman 6 it is easy to argue that the number of points and the number of lines in the generalized n gon is p n s s n 1 sn 2 s 1 note that a projective plane of order q is a generalized 3 gon generalized triangle of order q and so p 3 q q 2 q 1 nq the notation used in this paper earlier conjecture 1 let s 2 and n 3 then ck g for all k n k p n s acknowledgement the authors
