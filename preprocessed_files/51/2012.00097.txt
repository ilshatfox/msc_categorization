equivariant coarse embedding into p i e there is no proper affine isometric action of lp viewed as a group under addition with the standard metric p on p this is done by showing that representations of lp into isom p has to be trivial which allows us to reduce the question to bi lipschitz setting 1 introduction both p and lp spaces are some of the oldest examples of banach spaces so the question of their embeddability in different categories was raised as soon as people started to study banach spaces in those settings let us look at a brief history of embeddability of lp into p let s first look at the linear theory the fact that there is no bounded linear embedding from the classical fact that 2 is linearly isometric to a subspace of lp for any 1 p 6 2 but does not bi lipschitzly embed into p more can be said about the linear theory from a more general theorem of kadets and pe czy ski kp which establishes a dichotomy for a closed subspace x of lp when 2 p namely x is either isomorphic to the hilbert 2 space or x contains a subspace that is isomorphic to p and complemented in lp a big step in the study of banach spaces was when people started to look at them from a purely metric point of view and forgot the underlying linear 1 http arxiv org abs 2012 00097 v 1 structure a fundamental result in this setting is a theorem by mazur and ulam see mu that studies isometries f x y between real normed spaces x y that maps 0 to 0 by looking at midpoints of line segments they prove that f is in fact a bounded linear operator thus the problem of metric embedding of lp into p can be reduced to the linear setting which gives us a negative answer the standard proof of nonexistence of bi lipschitz embedding from lp into p follows heinrich and mankiewicz who in hm proved more generally that if x y is a bi lipschitz embedding of separable banach space x into a space y with the radon nikodym property then there exists a point of g teaux differentiability of f and the derivative at that point is a linear embedding with distortion bounded by distortion of f their proof is relying on the rademacher s differentiability theorem which says that every lipschitz map f x y from a separable banach space x into a banach space y with the radon nikodym property is differentiable haar almost everywhere more general type of maps that one may consider is quasi isometric or coarse lipschitz embeddings where linear bounds of the distance be tween any two points in replaced by an affine bound in this setting it was kalton and randrianarivony who proved in kr that lp does not admit a quasi isometric embedding into p by studying graphs gk m n n 1 nk ni m n 1 n 2 nk with a metric d n m i ni 6 mi for any subset m of the natural numbers more precisely they estimate the minimal distortion of any lipschitz embedding of gk m into p like banach spaces using ramsey s theorem the most general metric embedding we re going to consider is a coarse category where distance bounds we consider are arbitrary nondecreasing functions in this setting question about embeddability of lp into p has only partial answers namely for 1 p 2 it follows by work of by mendel and naor in mn that lp does embed into p this is done by factoring the embedding through hilbert space based on the argument by nowak who proved in n that 2 coarsely embeds into p for 1 p changing the setting from metric to more general it is worth noting that johnson lindenstrauss and schechtman proved in jls that if banach space x is uniformly homeomorphic to p for 1 p then x is linearly isomorphic to p more recently mendel and naor in mn 2 theorem 1 10 showed that uniform homeomorphism from lp into q exists if and only if p q or q p 2 this was done by developing a theory of metric cotype 2 which is an extension of the rademacher s cotype to a purely metric setting in this paper we focus on the category of equivariant coarse embeddings which are coarse embeddings that satisfy a certain compatibility condition with a predetermine representation into isometry group of the target space we find that the existence of such an embedding of a normed vector space into p forces it to be linearly isomorphic to p it is important to note re sult by cornulier tessera valette ctv that if locally compact compactly generated amenable group g coarsely embeds into the hilbert space then it also embeds in the coarsely equivariant way since we view lp as a topo logical group under addition one can hope it might be possible to generalize this fact in order to use our result to attack the general question of coarse embeddability of lp into p 2 preliminaries in this section we recall some basic definitions starting with some group theoretic vocabulary definition 1 for a set x we denote by sym x group of all bijections of x definition 2 we say that that a group element g is a n th root of a group element h if gn h note that if a group g acts on x and g g fixes x x then gn also fixes x for any natural number n hence we established the following claim claim 3 if h is a n th root of a group element g acting on x supp g supp h we now recall definitions of banach spaces that we will study definition 4 for 1 p we define p as space of all bi infinite se quences xi 1 such that i z xi p equipped with the norm xi 1 p n xn p definition 5 for 1 p we define lp to be a space of all measurable functions f r r such that f p s f p d 1 p further more we denote by lp the quotient space with respect to the kernel of p which defines a complete note on the said quotient 3 now we introduce different types of embeddings that we ll consider definition 6 a map f x dx y dy is an isometry if it preserves dis tance i e for any x 1 x 2 x the following equality holds ddy f x 1 f x 2 dx x 1 x 2 a set of all bijective isometries of a fixed metric space x dx forms a group under composition that we are denoting by isom x a classical result by banach see ban states that the only isometries of the space p are permutations of the support of the sequence which is corresponding to sym z isom p and changes of signs of its elements every change of sign is corresponding to a different copy of z 2 and since there are z many of them we conclude that zz 2 isom p since a permutation of the support does not commute with a change of sign we conclude that the group structure of isom p is a semi direct product of sym z with z z 2 where sym z is acting by change of support of zz 2 by a standard fact in group theory this is equivalent to the existence of the following short exact sequence 1 zz 2 i isom p p sym z 1 now we introduce different generalizations of isometric maps definition 7 a map f x dx y dy is a a bi lipschitz embedding if there exist constants d d such that for any x 1 x 2 x the following inequality holds ddy f x 1 f x 2 dx x 1 x 2 ddx x 1 x 2 constant d is called distortion of f and is denoted dist f definition 8 a map f x dx y dy is a a coarse embedding if there exist nondecreasing functions 0 0 such that lim t t and for any x 1 x 2 x the following inequality holds dy f x 1 f x 2 dx x 1 x 2 dy f x 1 f x 2 definition 9 let v be a normed vector space a linear bijection u v v is called a linear isometry if it preserves the norm i e for every v v we have u v v v v note that if g is a group then having it act in an isometric way on v is the same as defining an isometric representation i e a homomorphism g isom v into the group of all linear isometries of v 4 definition 10 an affine isometry of a normed vector space v is a map a v v such that for every v v a v u v b where u is a linear isometry and b is a fixed vector in v we say that group g acts on v by an affine isometries if for every g g there exists an affine isometry ag v v such that agh agah by our previous remark ag v gv bg where g isom v and b g v if we rewrite agh agah in this form we reach identity known as the cocycle condition bgh gbh bg 1 we say that affine action of g on v is proper if lim g bg v it is important to remark here that in the proof of our result we will be suing the standard p norm as a length function on lp elementary calculation see ny for a proof yields proposition 11 let g be a finitely generated group which admits a proper affine isometric action on a normed vector space v with a cocycle b then b is a coarse embedding because of the above admitting a proper affine isometric action on v is viewed as a stronger version of a coarse embedding and is also called an equivariant coarse embedding 3 proof of the main result lemma 12 let sym z denote the group of bijections of integers if sym z has a n th root i e n then there exists a unique n th root n s t supp n supp proof let k l supp s t k l and m supp supp assume that k m notice that and commute since belongs to a cyclic subgroup generated by thus k m m and k l should be equal but is an isomorphism sending k to m so it can not send l to m as well contradiction we just showed that for any k supp k also belongs to supp it mean that all cycles in a cycle decomposition of contain either only elements of supp or only those from supp supp after removing later cycles from we obtain supp n 5 lemma 13 let v be a vector space viewed as an abelian group under addition then every homomorphism v sym z is trivial proof for any v v and natural number n we have v n n v hence by lemma 12 n v always exist we will show that v e consider two cases first assume that all elements of supp v have a finite orbit let k supp v and its orbit consist of n integers then there exists n v which sends this n tuple of integers to itself order of all elements of sn is divides n so n v n v acts on that n tuple trivially thus k supp v contradiction now let k supp v have an unbounded orbit by lemma 12 v sends k to some l 6 k which belongs to the orbit of k under v it fol lows that v l v k we claim that v v i l v i 1 k for any integer i case i 0 is our basis of induction assume i 0 and v v i l v i 1 k then v v v i l v v i 1 k v i 2 k is equal to v v v i l v v i 1 l proving inductive step similarly if i 0 and v v i l v i 1 k then v v v i 1 l is equal to v v v i 1 l v v i l finishing the proof of the claim since k v i l for some i 6 0 we have v k v v i l v i k which gives us that i is an integer such that 2 i 1 contradiction with the assumption that v k l thus v can not be of this form theorem 14 all representations v isom p are trivial for p 6 2 proof recall that in section 2 we have established the existence of the fol lowing short exact sequence 1 zz 2 i isom p p sym z 1 by lemma 13 homomorphisms p v sym z is trivial so v ker p im i zz 2 but every homomorphism v zz 2 must be trivial since zz 2 is a torsion group thus also needs to be trivial theorem 15 every normed vector space v admitting a proper affine isometric action on p is isomorphically embeddable into p 6 proof by theorem 14 linear representation of v is trivial the cocycle condition 1 gives us then the existence of an additive coarse embedding a v lp i e v v a v lp v v now let r be such that 0 there exists n n such that 2 n v 2 n 1 then a v 2 n a v 2 n 2 n 2 v similarly a v 2 n a v 2 n 2 n 2 2 v
