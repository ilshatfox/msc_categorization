the average projected area theorem generalization to higher dimensions zachary slepian november 13 2012 1 abstract in 3 d the average projected area of a convex solid is 1 4 the surface area as cauchy showed in the 19 th century in general the ratio in n dimensions may be obtained from cauchy s surface area formula which is in turn a special case of kubota s theorem however while these latter results are well known to those working in integral geometry or the theory of convex bodies the results are largely unknown to the physics community so much so that even the 3 d result is sometimes said to have first been proven by an astronomer in the early 20 th century this is likely because the standard proofs in the mathematical literature are by and large couched in terms of concepts that are may not be familiar to many physicists therefore in this work we present a simple geometrical method of calculating the ratio of average projected area to surface area for convex bodies in arbitrary dimensions we focus on a pedagogical physically intuitive treatment that it is hoped will be useful to those in the physics community we do discuss the mathematical background of the theorem as well pointing those who may be interested to sources that offer the proofs that are standard in the fields of integral geometry and the theory of convex bodies we also provide discussion of the applications of the theorem especially noting that higher dimensional ratios may be of use for constructing observational tests of string theory finally we examine the limiting behavior of the ratio with the goal of offering intuition on its behavior by pointing out a suggestive connection with a well known fact in statistics 2 introduction it is well known that for an arbitrary convex solid in three dimensions the average projected area is one fourth the surface area perhaps less well known is the story of how this theorem came to be known in the physics community karl schwarzschild a german astronomer primarily famous for his black hole solution to einstein s general relativity proved the theorem near the turn of the twentieth century perhaps due to his untimely death at forty two in 1916 however the 1 ar x iv 1 10 9 05 95 v 4 m at h d g 1 1 n ov 2 01 2 theorem was not well known so it remained for his son astronomer martin schwarzschild to prove the theorem after the second world war unaware of his father s work knapp personal communication 1 one can only imagine his surprise to learn from a colleague that his father had already proved it decades earlier meanwhile the result in 2 and 3 dimensions had been well known in the mathematics community since cauchy s proof in works of 1841 and 1850 the result in arbitrary dimension is known as cauchy s surface area formula for this reason although he did not prove it for higher dimensions but this was done by many others in the years following minkowski kubota and bonnesen all offer proofs bonnesen fenchel 1987 see also webster 1994 essentially the result may be seen as a special case of kubota s theorem see klain rota 1997 pp 125 128 also schneider 1993 pp 295 klain rota present a so called mean projection formula separately from cauchy s surface area formula and interpret the former as a form of hadwiger s formula for compact convex sets cf pp 94 91 125 the proofs used involve objects such as grassmannian measures and haar probability measures which may be unfamiliar to many physicists the proofs in bonnesen fenchel 1987 and eggleston 1958 are very similar to each other and take a perhaps more el ementary approach but neither offers much intuition on why the formula holds schneider 1993 simply proves a general mean value formula for projections points out that what he terms kubota s integral recursion kubota s theorem in klain rota is a special case and that a further specialization of the latter offers cauchy s surface area formula schneider s approach involves integrating over the group of rotations as well as so called mixed volumes and quermassinte grals and we expect these may also be unfamiliar to many physicists santalo s 1976 discussion is perhaps the most geometric and physically intuitive of the standard references and that closest to our approach here again though cer tain elements of the proof that may not be obvious are asserted without further detail and not much physical picture is provided to offer intuition as to why the formula holds therefore it is hoped that the present work while not an original result will be of use especially to those in the physics community who may have little background in integral geometry or the theory of convex bodies with this in mind we spend some words developing a physical picture corresponding to the theorem in 3 d and then generalize this picture to provide an intuitive proof in higher dimensions we also discuss applications of the theorem both in 3 d and in higher dimensions finally we provide a simple formula for calculating the ratio of average projected area to surface area in n dimensions and discuss the limiting behavior of this formula both items unmentioned in the standard references discussed above 1 the younger schwarzschild is known in astronomy for his contributions to understanding stellar evolution especially red giant stars 2 figure 1 one may imagine the average projected area as the average shadow cast by the solid when the observer s position is varied through all possible orientations with respect to the solid the arrowed dashed lines indicate the flashlight observer s changing its position the hatched shape at right is one example of the shadow that would be cast 3 definition of problem there are two equivalent convenient ways to imagine average projected area consider an arbitrary convex solid in n dimensions now hold the solid s po sition fixed and shine a light beam behind it toward an observer in front of it vary the light beam s direction and consequently the observer s location since two points define a line and so the observer must move to see the solid s shadow through all possibilities measure the area of the shadow cast at each and av erage figure 1 alternatively one may hold the light beam and observer s position fixed and rotate the solid through all possible orientations keeping its spatial location fixed measure the shadows and average figure 2 either method yields the same result as one would expect since they correspond to the same process but observed either in the rest frame of the solid or of the observer 3 figure 2 one may also imagine the average projected area as the average shadow cast by the solid when it is rotated through all possible orientations with respect to a fixed observer the arrowed semi circles on the coordinate axes indicate the solid s rotation the hatched shape at right is one example of the shadow that would be cast 4 4 applications of the projected area theorem applications of the theorem are many in astrophysics dust is along the path light takes from distant stars or galaxies to us and so extinguishes some of the light the dust grains are irregularly shaped and oriented so it is necessary to correct for their average extinction of the incoming light this theorem provides the most convenient way to do so the next step is complex numerical simulations see e g draine 2011 the theorem also readily allows one to calculate the temperature of dust grains or asteroids illumined by a star assuming the grains or asteroids are convex the energy received by a dust grain is just proportional to its area as projected onto the light source s clearly the grain cannot receive energy from any part of its surface not visible to the illumining star however the particle can radiate energy away proportionally to its surface area setting energy absorbed per unit time equal to energy radiated per unit time i e the luminosities labs and lrad

the higher a the less energy the grain absorbs clearly the ratio aproj as is required to calculate the temperature of the grain the average projected area theorem also has more terrestrial applications it is a starting point for determining the 3 d shape of micro particles using a 2 d map of their projected areas see vickers brown 2001 brown et al 2005 the theorem has military applications as well saucier 2000 uses it in discussion of simulating debris fragments behind armor and characterizing the penetration potential of projectiles further it is a useful approximation when considering particle transport in 3 d see glassner 1995 the theorem also appears as a step in estimating the sphericity of fruits and of polymer beads in gels see e g houston 1957 and nussinovitch 2010 finally the theorem has applications in ray tracing for computer graphics hanrahan 2000 more speculatively it is possible that measurements of the ratio of average projected area to surface area might offer insight on the number of dimensions in which we live string theory suggests there may be 9 supersymmetric theories 10 m theory or 25 spatial dimensions bosonic string theory for reviews see kiritsis 1998 polchinski 1998 or schwarz 2000 however in string theory these extra dimensions are often constrained to be on very small scales for instance in kaluza klein theory the extra dimension must be smaller than 10 16 cm yagi et al 2011 and in randall sundrum models 4 spatial dimensions see randall sundrum 1999 i and ii constraints are on the order of micro 10 6 meters kapner et al 2007 constraining extra spatial dimensions using this theorem might also be challenging because in string theory electromagnetic 5 waves propagate through the usual 3 dimensions it is only gravitational effects that are hypothesized to propagate in extra dimensions as this would resolve the so called hierarchy problem by explaining why gravity is very much weaker than electromagnetism thus it would be necessary to find applications in which the gravitational wave emission or absorption of an object depended on its average projected area 5 plan of what follows the main purpose of this paper is to give an intuitive geometric proof of the generalization of this theorem to higher dimensional convex solids and obtain an expression for aproj as in arbitrary dimensions a second goal will be to consider and offer intuition for the limiting behavior of this ratio as a function of dimension the plan of what follows is thus i begin by proving the theorem in 3 d for completeness though this result may be found be found elsewhere e g in hildebrand 1942 we then present a geometric method for computing the ratio of average projected area to surface area as a function of the dimension of the space 7 provide a table of values and examine the limit of the ratio as the dimension becomes infinite 8 we conclude by presenting a simple recursion relation for the ratio between two consecutive dimensions and supplying an explicit formula for the ratio in terms of elementary operations 6 proof in 3 d consider on an arbitrary convex solid an infinitesimal unit of surface area da define da as the unit vector normal to the surface now consider a sphere of unit radius centered on the solid consider an observer at a point on this sphere s surface and let the observer s location define a hemisphere with its apex at their location if the vector da points such that it intersects this hemisphere then the observer will see it since this hemisphere s position is uncorrelated with the direction of da for an arbitrary unit of surface area da on average da will point into the observer s hemisphere half the time now restrict attention to the case where da points into the observer s hemi sphere consider the projection of da along the line of sight from the surface to the observer denote the angle between da and the line of sight by and note that because we have restricted ourselves to a hemisphere runs from zero to 2 we wish to integrate cos to find its average value as cos gives the pro jection of da onto the line of sight da z 2 0 cos sin d 1 2 2 notice that this integral is simply the differential projection of the solid s 6 face onto the hemisphere at whose apex the observer sits normalized by the hemisphere s surface area here the intuitive picture is that the orientation of the solid s face is chang ing while the observer s position is held fixed in this picture we are in the observer s rest frame as noted 5 it is equivalent to consider the solid s face fixed and vary the observer s position with respect to it i e to work in the solid s rest frame the only quantity of physical significance is the relative angle between the line of sight and the oriented unit area vector da recalling the additional factor of 1 2 because da only points into the ob server s hemisphere half the time and integrating over the solid s surface we find aproj 3 d s da z ds 1 4 as 3 with s denoting an integral over the solid s surface and as the solid s surface area note that consonant with our comments above though we derived equation 2 in the rest frame of the observer working in the rest frame of the solid will prove more fruitful for generalizing the theorem to higher dimensions for notice that in this picture as the observer s position varies at fixed distance from the origin it traces out a hemisphere hence we simply require the normalized projection of the solid s face onto this hemisphere but since the projection operator is commutative this is just the projection of the hemisphere onto the solid s face this latter is simply a disc bounded by the circle produced where the hemisphere intersects the solids face 7 proof of method for higher dimensions as noted in 6 considering the rest frame of the solid s face and projecting onto the hemisphere defined by the different possible orientations of an observer at fixed distance from the origin is a fruitful way to calculate the average projected area as also noted this projection is easily evaluated by finding the normalized projection of the hemisphere onto the solid s face both points also hold in arbitrary higher dimensions in higher dimensions one simply considers the hyperhemisphere generated by varying the observer s orientation at fixed distance from the origin with re spect to the face of the solid under consideration and calculates the normalized projection of the solid s hypersurface onto it this is equal to the normalized projection of the hyperhemisphere onto the hypersurface bounding it now the projection of a hyperhemisphere of dimension d onto the bounding hypersurface in d dimensions is simply the hypersphere of dimension d 1 hence daproj d vd 1 2 sh d 4 7 with vd 1 the volume of the unit hypersphere of dimension d 1 and sh d its surface area the factor of 1 2 comes from the fact that da only points into the observer s hemisphere half the time 8 calculation in higher dimensions here we use the observation of the previous section to derive the analog of equation 3 for dimensions other than 3 as equation 4 shows the differential average projected area of a d dimensional convex solid is just the volume of the unit d 1 sphere normalized by double the surface area of the unit d hemisphere hence we seek the factor k d relating aproj d to as the surface area of the convex solid as we will see below it is just vd 1 sd where vd 1 is the volume of the unit d 1 sphere and sd is the surface area of the unit d sphere we have aproj d s daproj d ds vd 1 sd as k d as 5 where the second equality is from using equation 4 for daproj d and replacing 2 sh d with sd the result is easily verified for 3 d with d 3 vd 1 v 2 and sd 4 now for a sphere vd 1 sd 1 d 1 6 and sd 1 2 d 2 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 1 md sd 7 hypersphere wolfram where we have defined md 1 2 d 1 1 2 d 8 we can thus see that k d 1 d 1 md 9 equation 9 is easily evaluated we provide a table of the first thirty two values as well as a plot illustrating the monotonic decrease in k d for large d k 1 d as we show by a series expansion equation 10 this is a suggestive result as it recalls the theorem in statistics that the standard deviation of a set of measurements falls as 1 n for n measurements one may make this connection explicit by considering n identical free particles moving in 3 spatial dimensions and examining the point set defined by the tip of each particle s velocity vector connecting this point set results in a 3 dimensional convex solid one may now consider the area of a face of this solid from dimensional 8 analysis it must be proportional to the square of the separation between the vectors corresponding to the particles whose coordinates define the face this separation is simply with the standard deviation of the velocity distribution from which the particles were drawn thus the area of a face is proportional to 2 now there will be of order n faces of the solid so by equipartition arguments on average the area of one face will be a fraction 1 n of the surface area therefore we see that 1 n this gives some intuition for the connection between the fact in statistics that 1 n and the fact that in many dimensions d which one may interpret as describing a many n particle system with d n the ratio of average projected area to surface area also falls with 1 d table 1 ratio of average projected area to surface area k d as a function of dimension d d k d d k d 2 318 18 095 3 250 19 093 4 212 20 090 5 1875 21 088 6 170

limiting behavior of k d as d tends to infinity as might be intuited from the plot k d 0 as d this follows immediately from the series for k d about d with x 1 d k d 1 2 x 1 2 x 3 2 4 x 5 2 32 5 x 7 2

recursion relation and explicit formula for k d there exists a simple recursion relation for k d 1 in terms of k d observe that mdmd 1 y y 1 11 where y 1 2 d 1 and md is defined by equation 8 using the identity that 1 y y y we have mdmd 1 2 d 1 12 using equation 9 in the above to relate k d and k d 1 to respectively m d and m d 1 we find k d 1 1 2 dk d 13 it is easily verified that beginning with k 3 1 4 this formula reproduces the results of equation 9 as given in table 1 using the recursion equation 13 and anchoring it at k 2 1 allows derivation of an explicit formula for k d d 2 k d 1
