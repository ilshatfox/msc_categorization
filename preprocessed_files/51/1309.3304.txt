department of mathematics ghent university ghent belgium hvm cage ugent be abstract we introduce an axiom on strong parapolar spaces of diameter 2 which arises naturally in the framework of hjelmslev geometries this way we characterize the hjelmslev moufang plane and its relatives line grassmannians certain half spin geometries and segre geome tries at the same time we provide a more general framework for a lemma of cohen which is widely used to study parapolar spaces as an application if the geometries are embedded in projective space we provide a common characterization of projections of segre varieties line grassmann varieties half spin varieties of low rank and the exceptional variety e 6 1 by means of a local condition on tangent spaces 1 introduction springer and veldkamp 11 introduced the hjelmslev moufang planes as geometries resembling hjelmslev planes because lines can meet in more than one point and moufang planes because the coordinating structure is also an octonion algebra though split whereas the usual moufang projective planes are defined over non split ones in the present paper we push the analogy a little bit further using the more modern notion of parapolar spaces indeed although the hjelmslev moufang planes are not hjelmslev planes themselves we show that they satisfy a far more intuitive property of realistic geometry as hjelmslev 5 himself was aiming at and that property follows from the definition of hjelmslev planes but it does not characterize hjelmslev planes the basic observation made by hjelmslev was that if one draws lines close to each other meaning that the sharp angle they define is very small then it is hard to identify the intersection point and it looks as if the lines have a little segment in common dually if two points are very close to each other then the joining line is hard to identify hjelmslev and later klingenberg 6 included these observations in their geometries by introducing a research supported by marie curie ief grant gelati ec grant nr 328178 1 http arxiv org abs 1309 3304 v 1 neighbor relation which precisely indicates when two points and two lines are close to one another however in the approach of hjelmslev and klingenberg the neighbor relation is an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes define a ordinary projective or affine plane the underlying plane a consequence of this is the following intuitive property imb let x be a point not neighboring two neighboring points y 1 y 2 then there are unique lines li joining x and yi i 1 2 and l 1 is a neighbor of l 2 the proof is very simple in the underlying plane y 1 and y 2 define the same point distinct from the point defined by x hence the lines l 1 and l 2 must define the same lines and are consequently contained in the same equivalence class we propose to take imb as an axiom and combine this with the theory of parapolar spaces where we want to view the symplecta as the lines of our geometry in the approach of hjelmslev any two points are joined by at least one line hence we consider strong parapolar spaces of diameter 2 next one must define the notion of neighboring to do this we refer back to the observation of hjelmslev if two points define a unique line then these points are far enough from one another translated to the framework of parapolar spaces two points at distance 2 define a unique symplecton consequently it is natural to define that two points are neighboring if they are collinear in the parapolar space for the dual we take into account the residual nature of parapolar spaces associated to building geometries more precisely in the situations we are interested in the residue in a point is again a parapolar space and with the definition of neighboring points above the neighbor relation on points is preserved under taking residues i e if y 1 y 2 are two non neighboring points collinear to a point x then in the residue at x the points defined by y 1 and y 2 are non neighboring so we also want the neighboring relation between symplecta to be preserved under taking residues the only sensible way to define two symplecta to be neighbors then is when they intersect in a maximal singular subspace this also implies that we should consider parapolar spaces of constant symplectic rank as a side remark we mention that in fact the situation just described resembles in a certain sense better the reality than was the case with the hjelmslev and klingenberg planes indeed in our case the neighbor relation is certainly not transitive and this is more realistic if one draws a number of points consecutively close to each other then the first point may well be far from the last one now we translate the property imb to the framework of parapolar spaces with the neighboring relation as just derived so let x be a point of a parapolar space of diameter 2 then y 1 y 2 are two collinear points collinearity in the parapolar space both at distance 2 from x if there was a point on the line y 1 y 2 collinear to x then the symplecta through x y 1 and x y 2 which we denote by x y 1 and x y 2 respectively would coincide and hence be neighboring trivially so we may assume that every point of the line y 1 y 2 is at distance 2 from x then the symplecta x y 1 and x y 2 intersect in a maximal singular subspace of both of them 2 in conclusion in this paper we will study strong parapolar spaces with diameter 2 satisfying the following additional property which we again refer to as imb as an abbreviation of imbrex imb let x be a point not collinear with any point of the line l let y 1 y 2 be distinct points on l then the symplecta x y 1 and x y 2 intersect in a singular subspace which is maximal for both of them we shall also need the more technical assumption that every set of mutually collinear points is contained in a maximal singular subspace to ensure this we add the axiom that every sequence of nested singular subspaces is finite it is the close analogue of the axiom for polar spaces ensuring finite rank and all main examples satisfy it and we call these parapolar spaces imbrex geometries in fact if the symplectic rank is at least 3 then one can classify imbrex geometries using a rather powerful theorem of cohen cooperstein 3 4 as updated by shult 9 the merit of property imb however lies in the fact that it allows to study the symplectic rank 2 case in a more general and conceptual way than was done before moreover it is ready made to generalize the characterization of segre varieties in 14 to the other varieties in the second row of the split version of the extended freudenthal tits magic square ftms i e line grassmannians of projective spaces and the variety associated to buildings of type e 6 i e the variety associated to springer and veldkamp hjlemslev moufang planes in contrast the restricted ftms just contains the segre variety of two projective planes and the line grassmannian of projective 5 space the paper is organized as follows after introducing the preliminaries in section 2 we investigate in section 3 imbrex geometries of symplectic rank 2 we show that if the symplecta are thick generalized quadrangles then the maximal singular subspaces contain a lot of non closing o nan configurations this immediately implies a fundamental lemma of cohen 3 which was originally proved only for the case of classical generalized quadrangles and later generalized by shult and k thas 10 for all moufang quadrangles in fact their proof shows that only the strong transitivity property of moufang quadrangles is needed in our setting there is no restriction on the generalized quadrangles and we also provide examples of imbrex geometries of symplectic rank 2 with thick symplecta whose maximal singular subspaces are not isomorphic to projective spaces in this way cohen s lemma for thick symplecta is turned into a positive result rather than merely showing nonexistence also our result reveals the true geometric reason why the thick case in cohen s setting cannot exist it is not because the quadrangle has remarkable transitivity properties or enjoys the structure of pseudo quadratic forms but it is because in projective spaces all o nan configurations close projective spaces are in fact characterized by that property in section 4 we classify all imbrex geometries of symplectic rank at least 3 this will be an application of impressive work of cohen and cooperstein 3 4 in section 5 we apply our results to the theory of mazzocca melone sets roughly a mazzocca melone set is a set of points in a projective space satisfying a far reaching generalization of the 3 conditions stated by mazzocca melone 7 that originally characterized finite quadric verone sean varieties in 8 we provided a characterization of the severi varieties over an arbitrary field these precisely correspond to the varieties of the second row of the split version of the restricted ftms using mazzocca melone sets we here propose to alter one of the axioms from a global condition to a local one inspired by the characterization of all segre varieties sm n k see 14 the thus defined local mazzocca melone sets will be classified in section 5 and will entail a characterization of the varieties in the second row of the split version of the extended ftms 2 preliminaries in this section we briefly introduce polar and parapolar spaces thus fixing notation more information about parapolar spaces can be found in 9 2 1 polar spaces polar spaces are essentially the geometries associated with pseudo quadratic forms except that in the rank 2 case no classification is feasible since there exist free constructions polar spaces have been introduced by veldkamp 17 later on included in the theory of buildings by tits 15 and around the same time the axioms have been simplified by buekenhout shult 2 it is the latter point of view we take here let p l be a point line geometry p is the set of points l the set of lines and a symmetric incidence relation we will not consider geometries with repeated lines so from now on we view l as a subset of the power set of p and is inclusion made symmetric the incidence graph is the bipartite graph on p l with as adjacency relation the dual of is the point line geometry l p a subspace of is a subset s of the point set such that if two points a b belong to s then all lines containing both a and b are contained in s points contained in a common line will be called collinear dually lines sharing at least one point are called concurrent a singular subspace is a subspace every two points of which are collinear note that the empty set and a single point are legible singular subspaces now is called a polar space of rank r if the following conditions hold ps 1 every line contains at least 3 points ps 2 no point is collinear with all other points ps 3 every nested sequence of singular subspaces has at most length r 1 and there exists such sequence of length r 1 ps 4 for any point x and any line l either one or all points on l are collinear with x 4 a generalized quadrangle is a polar space of rank 2 the dual of a polar space of rank 2 or the point line geometry defined by a 2 n grid with n any cardinal number at least 2 or the dual of the latter a generalized quadrangle is thick if it is both a polar space and a dual polar space equivalently if every element is incident with at least 3 other elements if t l then we denote by t the set of lines concurrent with every member of t a pair of non concurrent lines l m of a generalized quadrangle is called regular if l m l m for some distinct l m l m if for a line l every pair l m with m non concurrent with l is regular then the line l is called regular a subquadrangle of the generalized quadrangle p l is a subset of p together with a subset of l on which induces a generalized quadrangle a subquadrangle is ideal if for every point x in every line of incident with x also belongs to we note that polar spaces are partial linear spaces i e two collinear points x y determine exactly one line which we sometimes denote by xy 2 2 parapolar spaces parapolar spaces were introduced to capture the spherical buildings of exceptional type spherical buildings comprise projective spaces polar spaces and the ones of exceptional type since we only need strong parapolar spaces of diameter 2 we only introduce these let again p l be a point line geometry a subspace s is called convex if for any pair of points x y s every point contained in or incident with a line of any shortest path between x and y in the incidence graph is contained in s also is called connected if its incidence graph is connected now is called a strong parapolar space of diameter 2 if the following two assertions hold pps 1 p l is a connected space such that for every point x and every line l either 0 or exactly one or all points of l are collinear with x and all possibilities occur pps 2 for every pair of distinct non collinear points x and y in p the smallest convex subspace containing x and y is a polar space of rank at least 2 the convex subspaces of pps 2 are called the symplecta or briefly the symps of by axiom pps 2 any two non collinear points x y p are contained in a unique symp and we denote it by x y usually the third axiom of a parapolar space reads pps 3 every line is contained in at least one symplecton but this axiom is automatically satisfied in our case we restricted to strong and diameter 2 see 8 5 it follows from corollary 13 3 3 of 9 that any symplecton is uniquely determined by any pair of noncollinear points contained in it we will use this without further notice from pps 2 we immediately obtain the following two lemmas lemma 2 1 the quadrangle lemma let l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 be four not necessarily pairwise distinct singular lines such that li and li 1 where l 5 l 1 share a not necessarily unique point pi i 1 2 3 4 and suppose that p 1 and p 3 are not collinear then l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 are contained in a unique common symp lemma 2 2 let p x and let h be a symp not containing p then the set of points of h collinear with p constitutes a singular subspace of h moreover we will use the following lemma 2 3 let x y x be collinear then there is a symp containing x and not containing y proof since contains at least two symps by pps 1 it is easy to see using the previous lemmas that there are at least two different symps h h containing x suppose both contain y select a point p h h collinear to x but not collinear to y and a point p h h collinear to x but not collinear to p these points exist by lemma 2 2 and since h h is a singular subspace by convexity p p contains x but it does not contain y because the intersection h h would otherwise not be a singular subspace as it would contain the non collinear points p and y 2 3 imbrex geometries we will require an additional axiom which basically says that maximal singular subspaces exist pps 4 every nested sequence of singular subspaces has finite length we call a strong parapolar space of rank 2 an imbrex geometry if it additionally satisfies pps 4 and the axiom imb stated in the introduction we now show that all symps have the same rank this common rank will then be called the symplectic rank of the imbrex geometry lemma 2 4 in an imbrex geometry all symps have the same rank proof let h h be two symps we first note that pps 2 implies that the graph of all symps adjacent when they meet in a nonempty subspace is connected hence we may assume that h h contains some point x let y h and y h be two points both not collinear to x and hence y h y h if y and y are collinear then suppose that the line yy contains a point 6 z collinear to x it follows that the symp x y h contains z and hence y a contradiction hence by imb the symps x y h and x y h have the same rank so we may assume that y and y are not collinear the symp y y shares a singular subspace s with h and a singular subspace s with h we distinguish two possibilities 1 suppose the rank of y y is at least 3 or y y is a thick generalized quadrangle then it is easy to see that we can find a point z not in s s and so not in h h but collinear to both y y as before the lines yz and y z do not contain any point collinear to x hence the symps x y h and x z have the same rank as well as x y h and x z 2 suppose y y is a non thick generalized quadrangle i e a grid if we cannot find a point z as in the previous case then the only possibility is that s and s are disjoint lines of y y since both s and s contain at least three points we can find collinear points u s and u s such that x is not collinear to either u or u by imb the symps x u h and x u h intersect in a maximal singular subspace of both implying h and h have the same rank 3 imbrex geometries of symplectic rank 2 throughout this section we let p l be an imbrex geometry of symplectic rank 2 our main aim is to show that every maximal singular subspace of contains at least one non closed o nan configuration i e four distinct lines pairwise intersecting in a point except for one pair which is disjoint lemma 3 1 let x q 1 q 2 p with q 1 collinear to q 2 suppose no point of the line q 1 q 2 is collinear to x then some point of the line l x q 1 x q 1 is collinear with all points on q 1 q 2 proof note that l is indeed a line by imb now in the generalized quadrangle x yi there is a unique point zi on l collinear to yi i 1 2 if z 1 6 z 2 then lemma 2 1 yields x q 1 x q 2 implying that x is collinear with a point of l a contradiction hence z 1 z 2 l is collinear to both y 1 and y 2 axiom pps 1 completes the proof we define a new point line geometry p b where we call the elements of b blocks to avoid confusion with the lines of where b is the family of maximal singular subspaces of and where is containment made symmetric we will need the following auxiliary results lemma 3 2 if contains at least two distinct symps then it enjoys the following two properties 7 i for each point r there exists a line lr no point of which is collinear to r ii for each line m there exist a point ym not collinear with any point of m proof for i consider a symph through r a point y not inh and a point z inh not collinear with either r or y it is easy to check that this is always possible consider two different lines l 1 l 2 in y z through y if r is collinear with points p 1 p 2 on l 1 l 2 respectively then r p 1 p 2 y z implying h r z y z contains y a contradiction hence at least one of l 1 or l 2 will do for ii we argue by contradiction consider a point p on m consider a symp h through p and a point x h not collinear to p by assumption there exists a point on m collinear with x hence m x p h as h was arbitrary this contradicts lemma 2 3 lemma 3 1 and lemma 3 2 ii imply the following result corollary 3 3 every line of is properly contained in a block of proof let m l and let pm be a point not collinear to any point of m cf lemma 3 2 ii then lemma 3 1 implies that there is a point z collinear to all points of m let s 0 m z define inductively si 1 as si union all the lines containing at least two point of si let s be the infinite union of all si i n 0 we claim that s is a singular subspace indeed by construction it is a subspace clearly the claim follows if we show that all points of each si i n 0 are collinear to one another since this is clearly the case for s 0 we may argue by induction and assume that all points of si 1 are collinear i n let x y si we may assume y si 1 if x si 1 then let z 1 z 2 si 1 with y z 1 z 2 since x is collinear with both z 1 and z 2 axiom pps 1 implies that x is collinear to y if x si 1 then let u 1 u 2 si 1 be such that x u 1 u 2 by the previous argument both u 1 and u 2 are collinear to y hence again by pps 1 the assertion follows so s is a singular subspace properly containing m more generally the above proof can be used to show that every set of mutually collinear points is contained in a smallest singular subspace now let f be the family of singular subspaces of containing s we claim that every pair of elements of f has a least upper bound join in the poset defined by f indeed let s 1 s 2 f and suppose that some point y 1 of s 1 is not collinear to some point y 2 of s 2 we pick two points x 1 x 2 s then lemma 2 1 yields a symp containing x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 contradicting the fact that the symplectic rank is 2 now let s be the last member of a maximal nested sequence contained in f which is finite and exists by pps 4 then every member of f is contained in s by the previous paragraph and the maximality of the sequence the corollary is proved lemma 3 4 i two blocks intersect at most in one point ii a point p not contained in a block b is collinear with at least one point r b 8 proof suppose two blocks b 1 b 2 share at least two points x 1 x 2 let y 1 b 1 b 2 and y 2 b 2 b 1 with y 1 not collinear to y 2 this is possible since both b 1 and b 2 are maximal singular subspaces lemma 2 1 yields a symp containing x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 contradicting the fact that the symplectic rank is 2 this shows i for ii consider a line l b if p is collinear with a point of l we are done otherwise by lemma 3 1 and the proof of corollary 3 3 there is a block b containing l such that p is collinear with a point of b but by i b b establishing the proof lemma 3 5 i the point line geometry is a generalized quadrangle where each line con tains at least three points ii every symp is an ideal subquadrangle of in particular the symplecta are either all thick or all non thick proof for i we check the axioms of a polar space of rank 2 corollary 3 3 implies that every point is contained in at least two blocks and clearly every block contains at least three points whence ps 1 since by corollary 3 3 collinearity in coincides with collinearity in ps 2 follows maximality of the blocks implies ps 3 with rank equal to 2 as for ps 4 consider a point x not contained in a block b consider a line l b and suppose x is not collinear with any point on b then by lemma 3 1 there exists a block b containing l and such that there is a point y b collinear with x but as before b b and so there is at least one point y of b collinear to x if x were collinear to at least two points of b then we would find a maximal subspace intersecting b in at least two points a contradiction as before for ii consider a point x and a symp h through x we need to show that each block b containing x intersects h in a line consider y h not collinear with x by lemma 3 4 ii y is collinear with a point z b and hence it follows that z x y h establishing the proof let b be a block of and let h 6 b be a symp of viewed as ideal subquadrangle of since h is ideal b does not contain any point of h let u h be arbitrary then there is a unique block bu through u intersecting b in a point the block bu intersects h in a line lu for v h we easily have lu lv or lu lv hence we obtain a partition of h into lines which is usually called a spread of h here the spread is said to be induced by b these induced spreads have an interesting property lemma 3 6 i every pair of non concurrent lines of any symp of is regular ii if l m are two distinct lines of some induced spread s in some symp h then every member of l m belongs to the spread moreover if the spread is induced by the block b then the point line geometry induced on b by the lines of contained in s contains a subspace which is isomorphic to the point line geometry induced on s by the double perps i e the point line geometry with point set s and lines the sets l m with l m s 9 proof consider a symp h and and let l 1 l 2 be two non concurrent lines of h let b 1 b 2 be the blocks containing l 1 l 2 respectively let x 1 b 1 l 1 then there is a unique point x 2 b 2 collinear with x 1 since h is a subquadrangle of the point x 2 does not belong to l 2 we note that the block b containing x 1 and x 2 does not contain a point of h because if u b h then the unique point on b 1 collinear with u would be contained in l 1 since h is a subquadrangle but that point is x 1 a contradiction let m 1 m 2 l 1 l 2 be distinct put yi j li mj the symp x 1 y 2 j j 1 2 contains the lines x 1 x 2 and mj hence for any point x x 1 x 2 there is a unique point yj mj collinear to x if y 1 were not collinear to y 2 then h y 1 y 2 would contain x a contradiction hence y 1 and y 2 are collinear varying m 2 over l 1 l 2 m 1 we see that the line y 1 y 2 belongs to l 1 l 2 this shows l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 and hence the pair l 1 l 2 is regular but as is obvious from the previous paragraph all elements of m 1 m 2 belong to the spread induced by b and the corresponding blocks intersect b precisely in all points of the line x 1 x 2 hence the mapping y 1 y 2 7 x defines an injective morphism from to this completes the proof of the lemma we now arrive at the crux of this section theorem 3 7 if the symplecta of are thick generalized quadrangles then every maximal sin gular subspace contains a non closing o nan configuration in particular no maximal singular subspace is a projective space proof let h be any symp and let s be a spread induced by some block of outside h by the previous lemma it suffices to show that the geometry with point set s and lines the double perps contains non closing o nan configurations consider lines x l 1 l 2 m 1 s such that x l 1 l 2 r m 1 r see figure consider a line n r and the points p 1 n l 1 and p 2 n l 2 let q 1 be the unique point of m 1 collinear to p 1 consider the unique line k incident with q 1 and concurrent with x let q 2 be the unique point of k collinear to p 2 let m 2 x m 1 be such that q 2 m 2 suppose first there exists y l 1 m 1 l 2 m 2 l then y s by lemma 3 6 ii as piqi li mi i 1 2 the line y meets both p 1 q 1 and p 2 q 2 hence y n k p 1 q 1 p 2 q 2 since x intersects both n and k we have x p 1 q 1 p 2 q 2 by regularity y is concurrent with x a contradiction to x y s hence l 1 m 1 l 2 m 2 and the four double perps l 1 l 2 l 1 m 1 m 1 m 2 and l 2 m 2 form a non closing o nan configuration theorem 3 7 has been shown by cohen in 3 proposition 4 2 for classical generalized quad rangles i e for generalized quadrangles occurring as point residues in polar spaces of rank 3 with an extensive and explicit calculation more recently shult k thas 10 have found a more elegant proof only using the moufang property of such quadrangles and in fact they only use the strong transitivity i e the transitivity of the automorphism group on the set of pairs of 10 incident point line pairs p l q m such that p q are not collinear and l m not concurrent finally our proof above only uses the fact that for some line l of the spread there exists at least one line m not in the spread such that l m is a regular pair note that in the finite case one does not need any of the just mentioned additional conditions as noted by both cohen and shult k thas in the above references we now present a class of examples of imbrex geometries of symplecic rank 2 among which many with thick symps in this case the maximal singular subspaces can be seen as higher dimensional unitals let be any generalized quadrangle whose dual is embedded in some finite dimensional projective space pn l over the skew field l which is finite dimensional over its center i e the blocks of are points of pn l and the points of are lines of pn l with natural incidence all such are classified see 12 13 every classical generalized quadrangle in the above sense qualifies except that for some the dimension of the projective space is infinite now let p l be the point line geometry with same point set as and where the lines correspond to planes of pn l containing at least two lines of with natural incidence axiom pps 1 is easy to check for axiom pps 2 let l m be the lines of pn l corresponding to two non collinear points of then l m is 3 dimensional now l m induces a subquadrangle h of and h is generated by l m hence pps 2 holds with the symplecta being the subquadrangles of corresponding to 3 spaces of pn l containing two non intersecting lines of if we assume that these quadrangles are thick this is needed for ps 1 finally axiom pps 4 follows from the finite dimensonality of pn l and of l over its center we now check the axiom imb translated to we have to show that for given lines l m 1 m 2 of such that m 1 and m 2 intersect and l does not intersect the plane m 1 m 2 the 3 spaces l m 1 and l m 2 intersect in a plane containing at least two lines of clearly l m 1 m 2 and this contains besides l also the line through m 1 m 2 intersecting l in the finite case there is just one class of examples namely where is the hermitian quadrangle denoted by q 4 q 2 the maximal singular subspaces of are in this case classical unitals in the infinite case all quadrangles arising from a quadratic form with nontrivial qualify similarly other classes of examples are the exceptional moufang quadrangles of types f 4 e 6 e 7 and e 8 using the terminology of appendix c of 16 if we let points correspond to the isotropic orbit in the tits diagram which correspond to the multiple root in the root system of type bc 2 then the symplecta are the ideal subquadrangles belonging to a root system of type c 2 again all axioms of an imbrex geometry hold 4 imbrex geometries of symplectic rank at least 3 in this section p l is an imbrex geometry of symplectic rank r at least 3 11 lemma 4 1 let x h be a non incident point symplecton pair in if x is collinear with all points of a line l h then x is collinear with all points of a maximal singular subspace of h proof let p h be a point which is not collinear to all points of l and leth p x then by convexity h contains the unique point p on l collinear to p in h select x l different from p then we claim that no point on the line xx is collinear to p indeed suppose some point y xx is collinear to p then y h and hence also x h contradicting h p x our claim is proved now axiom imb implies that h and h intersect in a maximal singular subspace u in h the point x is collinear with an r 1 subspace u of u which does not contain x as x h hence x is collinear with all points of u and with x and these must then generate a maximal singular subspace now we can apply theorem 15 4 5 of 9 the latter theorem is an updated summary of the work done by cohen 3 and cohen cooperstein 4 since we assume diameter 2 our conclusion will only contain a restricted list of geometries without going into too much detail we define the lie incidence geometry xn i k where x a d e as the i grassmannian point line geometry related to the building of type xn over the skew field k which is automatically a field for the cases d and e and we use bourbaki labeling 1 for the nodes of the corresponding diagram and hence for the subscripts for instance the lie incidence geometry an i is the ordinary grassmannian geometry of all i spaces of the n 1 dimensional vector space over k corollary 4 2 an imbrex geometry of rank r at least 3 is exactly one of the following r 3 the lie incidence geometry an 2 l for l any skew field n 4 r 4 the lie incidence geometry d 5 5 k for any field k r 5 the lie incidence geometry e 6 1 k for any field k proof if is an imbrex geometry of rank at least 3 then the assertion follows from theorem 15 4 5 of 9 conversely if is one of the mentioned geometries then we will prove in the next section that their universal embedding is a local mazzocca melone set for definitions see the next section and this will immediately imply that they satisfy imb hence we postpone the details to the next section 5 local mazzocca melone sets we now apply the classification of the previous section to the theory of mazzocca melone sets initiated in 8 we introduce pre mazzocca melone sets and local mazzocca melone sets in the next subsection 12 5 1 definition of local mazzocca melone sets let n d r be natural numbers let x be a spanning point set of pn k with k any skew field and let be a collection of d 1 spaces of pn k d 2 such that for any the intersection x x is a polar space of rank r r 2 in and then for x x we denote the tangent space at x to x by tx x or sometimes simply by tx also we say that two points of x are x collinear if all points of the line they span in pn k are contained in x we call x a pre mazzocca melone set of type d r if mm 1 and mm 2 are satisfied and a local mazzocca melone set if on top lmm 3 holds mm 1 any pair of points x and y of x which are not x collinear lies in at least one element of mm 2 if 1 2 with 1 6 2 then 1 2 x it follows from mm 1 and mm 2 that any pair of points x and y of x which are not x collinear lies in exactly one member of and we denote that member by x y the pre mazzocca melone set x is called proper if 2 it follows from these axioms that proper pre mazzocca melone sets define parapolar spaces where the symps are the polar spaces x see 8 lmm 3 if x x and l x is a line of pn k such that no point of l is x collinear with x then all d spaces tx x y y l generate a subspace tx l of p n k of dimension at most 2 d r 1 a local mazzocca melone set is proper if it is a proper pre mazzocca melone set non proper pre mazzocca melone sets are just embedded polar spaces in this section we shall classify all proper local mazzocca melone sets of type d r for all d r 2 5 2 examples of proper local mazzocca melone sets in 14 it is proved that the segre variety sp q k p 1 and q 1 satisfies the axioms of a local mazzocca melone set although it was not called as such in 14 now the lie incidence geometries an 2 l for l any skew field n 4 d 5 5 k for any field k and e 6 1 k for any field k all admit the so called universal embedding which is a pre mazzocca melone set as proved in 8 we denote these pre mazzocca melone sets by ap 2 l p 4 d 5 5 k and e 6 1 k respectively we now show that these are local mazzocca melone sets by inclusion of the appropriate sets it suffices to show lmm 3 for the minimal cases namely a 4 2 l d 5 5 k and e 6 1 k note that in this list a preceding one is the residue of the next one i e if x is a point in one of these sets x then the lines of x through x form together with the tangent spaces to the symps at 13 x a pre mazzocca melone set in a subspace of the quotient projective space with respect to x isomorphic to the previous mazzocca melone set in the list hence the assertion will be proved if we show that the validity of lmm 3 for a given set follows from the validity of that axiom in any residue adding s 1 2 k in front of that list so suppose lmm 3 is valid in the residue xp p of x at p x for all p x with x one of the pre mazzocca melone sets a 4 2 l d 5 k or e 6 1 k let r 1 be the dimension of the maximal singular subspaces of the symps having rank r of x which are then hyperbolic quadrics in 2 r 1 dimensional spaces and d 2 r 2 let x x and let l be a line contained in x no point of which is x collinear with x let h and h be two distinct symps containing x and a different point of l say y y respectively we first claim that h h has dimension r 1 hence that imb holds since y is collinear with the point y of h it is collinear with an r 1 space u of h this can be checked in all instances directly from the definitions of the corresponding lie incidence geometries there is a unique r 2 space w u all of whose points are collinear with x by the quadrangle lemma the singular r 1 space x w is contained in h showing our claim moreover since both y and y are collinear with all points of w all points of l are collinear with all points of w and l w is a singular r space the quadrangle lemma implies that any symp h through x and a point of l contains w since r 3 we can select two distinct points q q of w clearly h is generated by tq h and tq h hence tx l l is generated by all tq h and tq h for h running through all symps through x and a point of l by induction the dimension of the span of all tq h for h as above is equal to 2 2 r 4 r 1 1 2 1 3 r 3 in the residue at q the point q x is not xq collinear to any point of q l similarly for the span of all tq h the intersection of those two spaces is by double induction 2 2 r 6 r 2 1 2 2 3 r 5 look in the residue of the line q q for r 2 there is no double induction but then this can be seen directly in s 1 2 k hence the dimension of tx l l is equal to 3 r 1 hence since l does not meet tx h we see that dim tx l 3 r 3 2 2 r 2 r 1 exactly what we had to prove 5 3 classification of local mazzocca melone sets using the results on imbrex geometries we now classify all local mazzocca melone sets up to projection from a suitable subspace i e a subspace containing no point in the span of two symplecta theorem 5 1 a proper local mazzocca melone set of type d r d r 2 is projectively equiv alent to a projection from a suitable subspace in the above sense of one of the following pre mazzocca melone sets d 2 the segre variety sp q k p 1 and q 1 14 d 4 ap 2 k p 4 d 6 d 5 5 k d 8 e 6 1 k proof clearly a local mazzocca melone set is an imbrex geometry so we can apply the results of section 3 suppose first that r 2 then the symplectic rank as a parapolar space is 2 and as the geometry is embedded all singular subspaces are projective spaces and hence do not contain non closed o nan configurations by theorem 3 7 we are done if r 3 we use corollary 4 2 and the fact that all embeddings arise from the universal embedding by suitable projection 5 4 weakening the imb axiom if we would not care about the residual property of imb then an interesting option would be to weaken it to the following condition imb let x be a point not collinear with any point of the line l let y 1 y 2 be distinct points on l then the symplecta x y 1 and x y 2 intersect in a singular subspace of dimension at least 1 this does not guarantee constant symplectic rank from the beginning and we were not able to classify strong parapolar spaces of rank 2 and symplectic rank at least 3 under condition imb however it would be interesting to do so since from the point of view of hjelmslev this is the weakest condition one can ask we pose it here as an open problem acknowledgement the
