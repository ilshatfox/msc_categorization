mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions lisa nilsson mikael passare abstract this paper deals with mellin transforms of rational functions g f in several variables we prove that the polar set of such a mellin transform consists of finitely many families of parallel hyperplanes with all planes in each such family being integral translates of a specific facial hyperplane of the newton polytope of the denominator f the mellin transform is naturally related to the so called coamoeba a f arg zf where zf is the zero locus of f and arg denotes the mapping that takes each coordinate to its argument in fact each connected component of the complement of the coamoeba a f gives rise to a different mellin transform the dependence of the mellin transform on the coefficients of f and the relation to the theory of a hypergeometric functions is also discussed in the paper 1 introduction the mellin transform mh of a locally integrable function h on the positive real axis is defined by the formula 1 mh s 0 h z zs dz z provided the integral converges here s is a complex variable s it the mellin transform is closely related to the fourier laplace transform via an exponential change of variables more precisely the value of mh s is equal to the fourier laplace transform of the function x 7 h e x evaluated at the point is in this paper we consider mellin transforms of rational functions h g f where g and f are polynomials since the general case is easily settled once we have fully investigated the special case where g 1 and since this will simplify our notation and therefore clarify our argument we shall focus mainly on the case h 1 f let us start by considering the one variable situation given a polynomial f z a 0 a 1 z amz m we assume for the moment that its coefficients a 0 am are positive numbers then the integral 1 with h 1 f converges and defines an analytic function in the vertical strip 0 m one can in fact make a meromorphic continuation of this mellin transform and write it as 2 m 1 f s s s m s 1 ar x iv 1 01 0 50 60 v 1 m at h c v 2 5 o ct 2 01 0 2 lisa nilsson mikael passare where is an entire function to see this let us first look at the case of a simple fraction 1 a bx in this case one has the explicit formula m 1 f s a s 1 b s s 1 s which can be easily established for instance by means of a residue computation now considering a general product f z m j 1 j z one can decompose 1 f into a sum of simple fractions and hence immediately deduce that its mellin transform will be of the form s s 1 s for some entire function in fact a straightforward residue calculation shows that s e is res zs 1 f z and by the theorem on the total sum of residues it then follows that 1 2 m 1 0 this means that we obtain formula 2 with s s 1 s m 1 s we have thus found that all the poles of the meromorphic continuation are located at the two integer sequences 0 1 2 and m 1 m 2 emanating from the end points of the interval 0 m notice that this interval is the newton polytope of our one variable polynomial f as a matter of fact in the above discussion we did not actually need to assume that the coefficients a 0 a 1 am be positive a necessary and sufficient condition for the argument to work and in particular for the integral to converge is that f z 6 0 for all real positive values of z another way of formulating this latter condition is that f should have no roots with argument zero we now turn to the multidimensional case and we begin looking at a simple example with the denominator f being an affine linear polynomial example 1 consider the polynomial f z 1 z 1 z 2 the mellin transform of the corresponding rational function 1 f is then given by the integral 0 0 zs 11 z s 2 2 1 z 1 z 2 dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 0 0 0 zs 1 11 z s 2 1 2 e v 1 z 1 z 2 dz 1 dz 2 dv which after the coordinate change t vz 1 u vz 2 becomes 0 ts 1 1 e tdt 0 us 2 1 e udu 0 v s 1 s 2 e vdv s 1 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 we shall see in this paper that the fact that the poles of the mellin transform are determined by a product of functions is not unique for the special cases we have considered so far in fact the mellin transform of a rational function in any number of variables will turn out to be always a product of functions in linear arguments multiplied by some entire function so that the only poles of the mellin transform are the poles of the functions moreover the configuration of polar hyperplanes is governed by the newton polytope of the denominator polynomial mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 3 with one family of parallel hyperplanes emanating from each facet of the newton polytope many of the results have been announced previously in 13 let us note in passing that a similar phenomenon can be observed also for mellin transforms of more general meromorphic functions with transcendental denominators as an illustration of this we recall the classical formulas m 1 ez s and m 1 ez 1 s s s 1 s s 1 where denotes the riemann zeta function 2 newton polytopes and co amoebas throughout this paper f will denote a complex laurent polynomial 3 f z a a z a c where a zn is a finite subset and c denotes the punctured complex plane c 0 here we use the standard notation z z 11 z n n for z z 1 zn cn the newton polytope f of the polynomial f is defined to be the convex hull of a in rn we shall primarily be interested in the case where f has a nonempty interior like any other polytope the newton polytope f may be alternatively viewed as the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces 4 f n k 1 rn k k where the k zn are primitive integer vectors in the inward normal direction of the facets of f and the k z are integers in general we will let denote a face of the newton polytope of arbitrary dimension 0 dim dim f and we define the relative interior relint of such a face to be the interior of viewed as a subset of the lowest dimensional hyperplane containing it for each face we also introduce the corresponding truncated polynomial f a z consisting of those monomials from the original polynomial f whose exponents are contained in the face of the newton polytope f the amoeba af and the coamoeba a f of a polynomial f are defined to be the images of the zero set zf z cn f z 0 under the real and imaginary parts log and arg respectively of the coordinatewise complex logarithm mapping more precisely one has af log zf and a f arg zf where log z log z 1 log zn and arg z arg z 1 arg zn writing w x i cn and z exp w exp w 1 exp wn one obtains the identities x log z re w and arg z im w as illustrated in the following picture 4 lisa nilsson mikael passare cn log arg a aa aa aa a rn cn exp oo re oo im rn r 2 z n figure 1 real and imaginary parts of the complex logarithm mapping the amoeba af is a subset in rn whereas the coamoeba a f can be viewed as being located either in the n dimensional torus r 2 z n or as a multiply periodic subset of rn this reflects the multivaluedness of the argument mapping for brevity of notation we denote the amoeba and the coamoeba of a truncated polynomial f by a and a 3 mellin transforms of rational functions the natural generalization to several variables of the standard mellin transform of a rational function 1 f is given by the integral 5 m 1 f s rn zs f z dz 1 dzn z 1 zn rn e s x f ex dx 1 xn where rn 0 n denotes the positive orthant in rn in order for such an integral to converge one has to make some assumptions about the exponent vector s and also about the denominator f it turns out that it is not enough to demand only that f be non vanishing on rn definition 1 a polynomial f is said to be completely non vanishing on a set x if for all faces of the newton polytope f the truncated polynomial f has no zeros on x in particular the polynomial f itself does not vanish on x remark this concept of completely non vanishing polynomials is closely related to the notion of quasielliptic polynomials discussed in 5 theorem 1 if the polynomial f is completely non vanishing on the positive orthant rn then the integral 5 converges and defines an analytic function in the tube domain s cn re s int f proof it will suffice to prove that for any given s with int f there are positive constants c k 0 such that 6 f ex e s x f ex e x c ek x x rn the proof is by induction on the dimension n the case n 1 is easy let and with be the two endpoints of f then for sufficiently large negative x one has f ex e x 1 2 a e x mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 5 and for sufficiently large positive x f ex e x 1 2 a e x now make the induction hypothesis that the inequality 6 holds for dimensions n 1 and consider a polynomial f of n variables for each face of f with 0 dim n 1 the given point can be expressed as a convex combination 1 where relint and relint conv a fix a choice of such a point in each face and consider for each the new convex polytope conv a notice that when dim 0 that is when is a vertex of f one has f notice also that the original point belongs to each let c be the outer normal cone to with vertex at 7 c x rn x 0 all these cones c are of full dimension n and together they almost cover the entire space rn more precisely the complement rn c is a bounded subset of rn then one can let c be a slightly smaller closed convex cone still with vertex at such that c is contained in the interior of c and such that the complement of the union c is still a bounded set notice that for x c the inequality in 7 will be strict and we may in fact assume this to be true uniformly we now observe that it is enough to prove the estimate 6 for x c actually it suffices to do it for x c br 0 for some large ball br 0 from the induction hypothesis we conclude that there are constants c such that f ex e x c 0 x rn indeed f e x is a function depending on fewer variables than n since it is homo geneous in directions orthogonal to and relint f for each face let g z be the function containing all the monomials not on so that f g f now we use the decomposition f f g so that one obtains 8 f ex e x e x f e x e x g e x e x take x c and write x y recall that f the first factor e x can be estimated from below by c 0 e k y with the positive constants c 0 and k given by c 0 exp and k min y y 1 y c 0 assuming which we may that x and hence that x x y we find e x c 1 ek x where c 1 c 0 e k 6 lisa nilsson mikael passare to finish the proof of the inequality we now only need to bound the expression in brackets in 8 from below by a positive constant from the induction hypothesis we have that f e x c 0 and it is therefore enough to show that the remainder term g e x e x stays small say c 2 we have the identity g e x a a e x a a e y since we have a strictly positive constant k min y y 1 y c and hence a e x a e y a e k y this means that for some large enough r 0 one has g ex e x c 2 whenever x r 0 x c hence there is an inequality f ex exp x c 2 and we can conclude that for all x in c br 0 for some large ball br 0 one has the desired estimate f ex e x c ek x x rn with c c 1 c 2 having thus established the convergence of the integral 5 defining the mellin transform we now turn to the question of finding its analytic continuation as a meromorphic function of s in the whole complex space cn the polar locus of the meromorphic continuation turns out to be a finite union of families of parallel hyperplanes the normal directions of these hyperplanes are precisely the vectors k from the representation 4 of the newton polytope f theorem 2 if the polynomial f is completely non vanishing on the positive orthant rn and its newton polytope f is of full dimension then the mellin transform m 1 f admits a meromorphic continuation of the form 9 m 1 f s s n k 1 k s k where is an entire function and where k k are the same as in equation 4 before giving the proof of this theorem let us illustrate the idea of the argument by means of a specific example example 2 consider the polynomial f z 1 z 2 z 2 1 z 1 z 2 2 it is easy to check that the representation 4 of its newton polytope is given by 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 4 2 0 so in this case the newton polygon f has four inward normal vectors given by 1 1 0 2 1 1 3 2 1 and 4 0 1 we know from theorem 1 that the mellin transform m 1 f is holomorphic for all s s 1 s 2 whose real part 1 2 lies inside the newton polygon f in mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 7 order to achieve a meromorphic continuation of m 1 f across the left vertical edge of f it suffices to perform an integration by parts with respect to z 1 indeed this gives us the identity 10 m 1 f s 1 s 1 0 0 2 z 21 z 1 z 2 2 z s 1 1 z s 2 2 1 z 2 z 2 1 z 1 z 2 2 2 dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 and we claim that this integral that is the mellin transform multiplied by s 1 converges for all s with real part in the dark triangle on the left in figure 2 this means that m 1 f has been continued meromorphically over the hyperplane s 1 0 as desired to verify the claim we decompose the integral in 10 into two mellin type integrals containing the integrands 2 z 2 s 11 z s 2 2 f 2 and z 1 s 11 z 2 s 2 2 f 2 respectively since the newton polygon of the denominator f 2 is equal to the original f dilated by a factor 2 we see that the convergence domains for these two integrals are given by the translated polygons 2 0 2 f and 1 2 2 f respectively the sum of the integrals therefore converges on the intersection of the translated polygons and this is precisely the dark triangle on the left in figure 2 figure 2 the convergence domains dark of the integrals after the two cases of integration by parts given as the intersection of two translated copies of f 2 2 f the dashed polygon is f we have thus seen how a meromorphic continuation can be carried out in the horizontal direction that is in the direction given by 1 suppose next that we wish to obtain a similar mermorphic extension across the upper left edge of f the one with normal vector 2 1 1 the way to acheive such a directional integration by parts is to suitably introduce a parameter and then to differentate with respect to more precisely we make the coordinate change z 1 7 z 1 z 2 7 1 z 2 and obtain m 1 f s 1 s 1 s 2 0 0 zs 11 z s 2 2 z 2 3 z 2 1 z 1 z 2 2 dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 here the left hand side is obviously independent of hence so is the right hand side and after differentiating and plugging in 1 we find that 0 1 s 1 s 2 0 0 zs 11 z s 2 2 f z dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 0 0 1 3 z 21 z s 1 1 z s 2 2 f z 2 dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 8 lisa nilsson mikael passare this relation can be re written as m 1 f s 1 1 s 1 s 2 0 0 1 3 z 21 z s 1 1 z s 2 2 f z 2 dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 and reasoning as above we find that this latter integral converges for all s with real part in the dark polygon on the right in figure 2 thereby yielding a meromorphic continuation across the hyperplane s 1 s 2 1 this method of repeatedly performing integration by parts in all the directions k by using the corresponding coordinate changes zj 7 kjzj is the basis for our proof of theorem 2 and it gives a global meromorphic continuation of the original mellin integral for our special example the picture below indicates the full set of polar hyperplanes going out in all directions from the newton polytope f figure 3 polar hyperplanes of the mellin transform m 1 f remark for the mellin transform of a general rational function g f each mono mial in the numerator g produces an integral similar to the one in the theorem except that we get a shift in the variable s by an integer vector this corresponds to a translation of the newton polytope of f and hence also of the domain of convergence of that particular integral if g has several monomials it can very well happen that the intersection of all the corresponding shifted polytopes is empty in that case the integral defining the mellin tranform may not actually converge for any values of s nevertheless performing the meromorphic continuation of each of the integrals associated with the monomials from g and then summing these mero morphic functions we still obtain a natural interpretation of the mellin transform mg f as a meromorphic fucntion in the entire s space proof we prove that the integral 5 can be re written in such a way as to make it have a larger convergence domain at the expense of having to multiply the integral with reciprocals of linear terms corresponding to the poles of the gamma functions in order to achieve this we shall repeatedly integrate by parts in each of the directions given by the vectors k each such step consists in first making mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 9 the corresponding dilation z 1 zn 7 k 1 z 1 knzn of the coordinates then differentiating with respect to the dilation parameter and finally setting equal to 1 note that if is the facet of f with inward normal vector k the truncated polynomial f has the homogeneity f kz kf z hence the scaled poly nomial kf kz has the property that all its monomials with exponents from have coefficients that are independent of the parameter this means that in the differentiated polynomial gek z d d kf kz 1 there are no monomials with exponents from the facet its newton polytope is therefore strictly smaller than f with the integer k from the original inequality k k being replaced by k 1 or possibly by an even larger integer starting from the original integral expression 5 for the mellin transform m 1 f introducing the parameter and keeping in mind that m 1 f itself is of course independent of we obtain 0 d d rn kz s f kz dz z d d k s k rn zs kf kz dz z which upon performing the differentation and setting 1 yields the identity 11 k s k m 1 f s rn zsgek z f z 2 dz z as we shall iterate this procedure it will be important to keep track of polytopes of different sizes and to this end we introduce for any vector zn the notation n k 1 rn k k in particular we have f now let m nn be a given vector and perform the integration by parts mj times in the direction of j for each j 1 n the total number of such integrations will thus be m m 1 mn we claim that this iterative process leads to an expression for the mellin transform that is of the form 12 m 1 f s 1 n j 1 uj s rn zs gm z f z 1 m dz z where gm is a polynomial whose newton polytope satisfies gm m m and uj s mj 1 0 j s j with the convention uj 1 if mj 0 the proof of the claim is by induction first we check that it holds true in the case m 1 that is when m is a standard unit vector ek with 1 in the k th entry and zeros elsewhere indeed this is precisely the content of formula 11 where we recall that the newton polytope of gek is contained in ek 10 lisa nilsson mikael passare assume now the claim to be true for some given vector m and let us show that it then holds also for m m ek where ek is a unit vector as before introducing again the dilated coordinates kz we can re write the integral in equation 12 as k s k mk rn zs m k mkgm kz 1 m kf kz 1 m dz z we should then differentiate this expression with respect to and put 1 when the derivative falls on the monomial in front of the integral we get a factor k s k mk which is precisely what needs to be incorporated into the function uk and when we differentiate under the sign of integration we arrive at an expression of the form rn zs gm z f z 2 m dz z the new polynomial in the numerator is gm z 1 m gek z gm z f z g m z where g m z d d m k mkgm kz 1 to finish the proof of the claim we must show that gm m m we shall use the fact that the newton polytope of a product of two polynomials is equal to the minkowski sum of their newton polytopes and also the obvious general inclusion recalling the induction hypothesis we first see that the newton polytope of the product gekgm is contained in the polytope ek m m 1 m m ek m m then since the polynomial g m has no monomials with exponents on the plane k m k mk we similarly get that the newton polytope of the other term fg m is contained in m m ek m m from this the claim follows that is the mellin transform is given by 12 with gm satisfying gm m m our next step is to prove that the integral in 12 converges and defines an analytic function for all s with real parts in the enlarged polytope m by considering separately each term of gm we can infer from theorem 1 that the domain of convergence will contain the interior of the intersection 13 gm 1 m f of translates of dilated copies of f let us check that m is indeed a subset of 13 take an arbitrary 0 m by definition it satisfies the inequalities 14 k 0 k mk k 1 n in order to see that 0 also belongs to the intersection 13 take any gm and observe that the polytope 1 m f is given by the inequalities 15 k 1 m k k 1 n what we have to show is that 0 satisfies these inequalities in view of the inclusion gm m m we have k m k mk for all k together with 14 mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 11 this gives k 0 k 0 k k mk m k mk 1 m k so 0 does indeed satisfy 15 and since was arbitrary it follows that 0 lies in the intersection 13 in the interior of the domain m irn the only poles of m 1 f are given by uj s 0 j 1 n all these poles are simple this is the same polar locus as for the product k k s k by the theorem on removable singularities it follows that the quotient m 1 f k k s k is holomorphic for inside the polytope m but here m nn is arbitrary and since the union of all the m is the entire space rn we conclude that is in fact an entire function as claimed in the theorem 4 two special cases in certain situations we are able to make our description of the mellin transform even more precise and explicitly compute the entire function that occurs in front of the gamma factors in theorem 2 we have already encountered such a case in example 1 of the introduction where we considered the transform of the simple fraction 1 1 z 1 z 2 elaborating this example just a little further and considering a more general linear fraction 1 c 0 c 1 z 1 cnzn with each coefficient ck being a positive real number one easily deduces the formula 16 m 1 f s c s 1 sn 1 0 c s 1 1 c sn n s 1 sn 1 s 1 sn so in this case the entire function is equal to the elementary exponential function s 7 cs 1 sn 10 c s 1 1 c sn n and in particular different from zero everywhere we shall now consider two families of examples that both generalize the case of a linear fraction namely products of linear fractions and rational functions that are obtained from linear fractions by means of a monomial change of variables proposition 1 assume that the polynomial f z m k 0 1 ak z is a product of affine linear factors with each ak rn then the mellin transform of the rational function 1 f is equal to 17 m 1 f s s s 1 sn m 1 s 1 sn with the entire function given by s m d 1 d m 1 s 1 n sn here m denotes the standard m simplex rm k 1 and the k are affine linear forms defined by 1 n 1 k a 0 1 a 1 mam proof we begin by first computing the mellin transform of a power of the type 1 1 c z m 1 by performing repeated integrations under the sign of integration we get m 1 1 c z m 1 1 m m dm d m m 1 c z 1 12 lisa nilsson mikael passare then recalling the formula 16 and using the simple identity 1 m m dm d m s 1 sn 1 1 1 m m 1 s 1 sn 1 s 1 sn we find that m 1 1 c z m 1 1 m c s 11 c sn n s 1 sn m 1 s 1 sn next we make use of the generalized partial fractions decomposition 1 m k 0 1 ak z m m d 1 d m 1 z m 1 which occurs in the theory of analytic functionals and fantappie transforms see for instance 1 or 11 from this formula we immediately obtain m 1 m k 0 1 ak z m m m 1 1 z m 1 d 1 d m which yields 17 in particular when m n 1 and f z 1 a 0 z 1 a 1 z we obtain the entire function s 1 0 d 1 a 0 a 1 s 1 1 s a 1 s 1 a 1 s 0 a 1 a 0 1 1 s res zs 1 f z in accordance with the formulas mentioned in the introduction above similarly when n 2 and f z 1 z 2 1 a 01 z 1 a 02 z 2 1 a 11 z 1 a 12 z 2 the entire function becomes s 1 s 2 1 0 d 1 a 01 a 11 s 1 1 a 02 a 12 s 2 here one may remark a close connection to the classical euler beta function b namely if we let the coefficients a 02 and a 11 become zero we are left with s 1 s 2 a s 1 01 a s 2 12 1 0 1 s 1 s 2 d a s 101 a s 2 12 b 1 s 1 1 s 2 since b 1 s 1 1 s 2 1 s 1 1 s 2 2 s 1 s 2 we see that the function is no longer entire this is to be expected however because the new polynomial f z 1 z 2 1 a 01 z 1 1 a 12 z 2 has a different newton polygon and the new should contribute to the change of factors in the mellin transform in fact when a 02 a 11 0 we have the formula m 1 f s s s 1 s 2 2 s 1 s 2 a s 1 01 a s 2 12 s 1 s 2 1 s 1 1 s 2 it is not always the case that all the polar hyperplanes of the gamma functions in the representation 9 are actual singularities for the mellin transform m 1 f it may happen that the entire function has zeros that cancel out some of the poles a very simple example of this phenomenon is provided by the function f z 1 zm with m 2 in this case the substitution zm w leads to the formula m 1 f s 1 m 0 ws m 1 w dw w 1 m s m 1 s m mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 13 so the polar locus is just mz in fact the entire function from 9 is given by s 1 m s m s 1 s m m s and it has plenty of integer zeros a slight generalization of this example is provided by the following result proposition 2 let f z 1 z 1 z n for some linearly independent vectors 1 n zn and denote by the non zero determinant det jk the mellin transform of the rational function 1 f is then given by m 1 f s 1 1 s n s 1 1 s n s where the k denote the column vectors of the inverse matrix jk 1 proof we make the monomial change of variables z j 1 1 z jn n wj so that zj w j 1 1 w jn n and dz z 1 dw w the mellin transform can then be written m 1 f s rn zs 1 z 1 z n dz z 1 rn w 1 s 1 w n s n 1 w 1 wn dw w and the latter integral is of a similar form as the one in example 1 we point out that the newton polytope f of the polynomial in proposition 2 is a simplex with one vertex at the origin and that its normal vectors 1 n 1 are integer multiples of the rational vectors 1 n and 1 n moreover one has 1 n 0 and n 1 1 in this case the entire function occurring in 9 is therefore of the form s 1 1 s 1 s n s n s 1 1 s n s 1 n 1 s 5 mellin transforms and coamoebas let us return for a moment to the one variable mellin transform m 1 f s 0 zs f z dz z esx f ex dx where we assume as before that the polynomial f does not vanish on the positive real axis and that the real part of s lies in the interior of the newton interval f our first claim is now that the value of the above integral remains unchanged if the set of integration is rotated slightly in other words for small enough one has the identity 0 zs f z dz z arg 1 zs f z dz z es x i f ex i dx to verify this we perform an integration along a closed path starting at the origin then running along the positive real axis to the point r continuing along the circle z r to the point rei and then going straight back to the origin see figure 4 below since is close to zero the denominator f has no zeros in the closed sector 14 lisa nilsson mikael passare with arguments between 0 and by the residue theorem the integral over the closed contour is therefore equal to zero and since the integrand decreases fast when z the integral over the circular arc cr can be made arbitrarily small by choosing r large enough the integrals along the two infinite rays are thus equal as claimed cr r figure 4 the contour of integration in the residue computation from the above argument we see that the directional mellin transform coincides with the standard one as long as the two directions and 0 belong to the same connected component of the coamoeba complement r a f furthermore it is clear that the mellin integral over arg 1 converges for every choice of outside the coamoeba a f a similar residue computation as above then again shows that the directional mellin transform only depends on which connected component of r a f it is that contains turning to the general case n 1 there are two important differences to be observed on the one hand we recall the condition in theorem 1 that the polynomial f should be completely non vanishing on rn arg 1 0 in order for the integral to converge and on the other hand we note that the coamoeba a f is in general not a closed set the following result connects these two facts and it allows us to define the directional mellin transform 18 arg 1 zs f z dz z rn e s x i f ex i dx for each argument that does not belong to the closure a f theorem 3 for any rn a f the polynomial f is completely non vanishing on the set arg 1 proof for any given argument vector we can consider the new polynomial f z f ei 1 z 1 e i nzn observe that a f a f so that 0 a f if and only if a f and also that f is completely non vanishing on arg 1 0 if and only if f is completely non vanishing on arg 1 this means that it actually suffices to prove the theorem for the special case 0 mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 15 assume then that f is not completely non vanishing on the set arg 1 0 so that for some face one has 0 a in other words there is an x 0 r n such that f e x 0 0 we must show that 0 belongs to the closure a f this is obvious if f so we can assume that dim n 1 choose a vector zn and an integer z such that for and for f writing g f f we then have f e x 0 t a e x 0 t e t a e x 0 0 and g e x 0 t f a e x 0 t e t f b e tc where b a e x 0 and c 0 now let 0 be given choose a disk d of radius centered at x 0 and contained in a complex line on which the function w 7 f ew does not vanish identically then translate this disk along the real space so that d t is a disk centered at the point x 0 t for some large positive number t since f e w is non zero on the boundary of d we have f ew 0 for w d this means that f ew e t on the translated circle d t taking t large enough we also have g ew f ew 1 on d t that is g ew f ew rouche s theorem then tells us that f ew f ew g ew has a zero w in the disk d t so z ew belongs to the hypersurface f z 0 but we also know that arg z imw and since was chosen arbitrary we conclude that 0 a f remark in the above proof we showed that all the facial coamoebas a are contained in the closure a f of the main coamoeba it is a fact proved by johansson 12 and independently by nisse and sottile 14 that one actually has an equality f a a f using theorems 1 and 3 we can now define a directional mellin transform 18 for any in the complement rn a f just as in the one variable case discussed earlier in the section the various mellin transforms will in fact be equal for all that belong to the same connected component of rn a f this can be seen by connecting two different values of through a polygonal path such that along each edge of the path only one component k is being changed the invariance of the mellin transform under such a move is then a consequence of the one variable argument ln order to put our next theorem in a proper perspective it seems appropriate at this juncture to recall some known facts about amoebas and laurents series of rational functions a reference for these results is 6 associated with each connected component e of the amoeba complement rn af is a laurent series representation 1 f z zn ce z of the rational function 1 f the coefficients of the series are given by the integrals 16 lisa nilsson mikael passare ce 1 2 i n log 1 x z f z dz z n e x i f ex i d where x is any point in the connected component e each such laurent series will converge in the corresponding reinhardt domain log 1 e we stress the fact that the amoeba af is always a closed set so in contrast to the case of coamoebas there is no need to take the closure of the amoeba the following result about coamoebas and mellin transforms provides a prac tically perfect analogy to the above picture for amoebas and laurent coefficients theorem 4 for any connected component e of the coamoeba complement rn a f there is an integral representation 19 1 f z irn me 1 f s z sds which converges for all z in the domain arg 1 e here is an arbitrary point in int f and 20 me 1 f s 1 2 i n arg 1 zs f z dz z 1 2 i n rn e s x i f ex i dx with being an arbitrary point in the component e proof from theorem 3 and an obvious generalization of theorem 1 we see that the integral 20 converges and from the discussion preceding theorem 3 we also know that the value of 20 is independent of the particular choice of point e in order to prove the identity 19 it suffices to verify that for all s it such that int f the function x e s x i f ex i is in the schwartz space s rn of rapidly decreasing functions then the result follows from well known facts about inversion of fourier transforms see thm 7 1 5 in 10 for simplicity and without loss of generality we assume that 0 we have e s x f ex e x f ex and from the inequality 6 which we established in the proof of theorem 1 we see that e s x f ex is an exponentially dercreasing function it remains to verify that all its partial derivatives have the same property computing a typical derivative we get 21 xk e x f ex k e x f ex e ek x f k e x f ex 2 where f k denotes the derivative of the polynomial f with respect to zk here the first term one the right hand side is just a constant times the original function and the second term is of the form a ka e x f ex 2 the newton polytope of the denominator is f 2 2 f so int f 2 for every a and hence each term in the sum satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 this means that the derivative 21 is a finite sum of functions to which we can apply theorem 1 and the inequality 6 by induction this implies that all derivatives of e s x f ex decrease exponentially mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 17 remark it is clear that if e is a connected component of rn a f that is obtained by just translating another component e by 2 ek then the corresponding two mellin transforms are related by the simple formula me 1 f s e 2 iskme 1 f s in general however the relations between the various mellin transforms associated with different connected components are rather complicated furthermore it is worth mentioning that all the connected components of rn a f are convex sets this fact follows for instance from the bochner tube theorem see 4 finally we point out that theorem 4 can also be proved by using results from antipova 2 6 hypergeometry in this final section we shall consider the dependence of the mellin transform and in particular of the entire function on the coefficients a a of the polynomial f in order to emphasize this dependence we are here going to write a s rather than just s the crucial observation will be that with respect to the variables a the function is an a hypergeometric function in the sense of gelfand kapranov and zelevinsky more precisely a 7 a s satisfies the a hypergeometric system of partial differential equations with homogeneity parameter 1 s 1 s 2 sn let us recall the structure of the a hypergeometric system our starting point is the subset a zn of exponent vectors occurring in the expression 3 for the polynomial f we introduce a numbering 1 n of the elements of a with each k 1 k nk zn abusing the notation slightly we write a also for the 1 n n matrix whose column vectors are 1 k for any vector v zn we denote by v and v the vectors obtained from v by replacing each component vk by max vk 0 and max vk 0 respectively so that v v v definition 2 let a denote a subset 1 n zn and the associated 1 n n matrix as above the a hypergeometric system of differential equations with homogeneity parameter cn is then given by bf a 0 b zn ab 0 and e j f a 0 j 0 1 n where the differential operators b and e j are given by b a b a b and e j n k 1 jk ak ak j an analytic function f that solves the system is called a hypergeometric with ho mogeneity parameter remark we are assuming n 1 n and as soon as this inequality is strict there are of course infinitely many vectors b satisfying ab 0 but it is a known fact see 15 that the system is in fact determined by a finite number of operators b let us now for a given choice of coefficients a consider an entire function s 7 a s as described in theorems 2 and 4 we want to study what happens when we start varying a recall from 7 and 8 the notion of the principal a determinant ea also known as the full a discriminant it is a polynomial in the 18 lisa nilsson mikael passare variables a with the property that its zero set a cn contains the singular locus of all a hypergeometric functions theorem 5 take a cn a and let e be a connected component of rn a f with f being the polynomial f z a 1 z 1 anz n also take s cn with re s int f then the analytic germ a s 1 k k s k arg 1 zs k akz k dz z e has a multivalued analytic continuation to cn a cn which is everywhere a hypergeometric in a with varying homogeneity parameter 1 s 1 sn proof first of all it is clear that will be disjoint from a f also for poly nomials f with coefficients ak near the original ones say in a small ball b a so that the integral does indeed define an analytic germ a s from a straightforward generalization of our theorem 2 we also know that is extendable as an entire function with respect to the variables s in other words we already have an analytic extension of to the infinite cylinder b a cn let us next verify that is an a hypergeometric function with the correct homogeneity parameter when doing this we first fix s at an arbitrary value with re s int f hence in particular away from the polar hyperplanes of the gamma functions then the function in front of the integral is just a non zero constant and we can deal directly with the integral by differentiation under the integral sign notice that the condition that ab 0 amounts to the two identities b b and b b were we have used the shorthand notation b b k and b b k k computing iterated derivatives of the integrand 1 f in the mellin integral we get a b 1 ak z k 1 b b z b ak z k 1 b and since here the right hand side is independent of the choice of sign in b so is the left hand side this means that b 1 f 0 and hence we also have b 0 it is obvious that is homogeneous of degree 1 with respect to the variables ak to check the other homogeneities one can integrate by parts in the integral as in our proof of theorem 2 this can be efficiently done by dilating the variables by means of a parameter for example making the dilation zj 7 zj we get arg 1 zs k akz k dz z sj arg 1 zs k jkakz k dz z differentiating both sides of this identity with respect to and then putting 1 we find that 0 sj n k 1 jk ak ak and hence e j a s 0 with j sj as claimed we have thus established that is an a hypergeometric analytic function in the product domain b a int f irn and by uniqueness of analytic continuation mellin transforms of multivariate rational functions 19 its extension to the cylinder b a cn will remain a hypergeometric next by the general theory of a hypergeometric functions one has for each fixed s a typically multivalued analytic continuation of a 7 a s from b a to all of cn a well known results on analytic functions of several variables then tell us that these continuations will still depend analytically on s so we have achieved the desired analytic continuation to the full product domain cn a cn the uniqueness of analytic continuation again guarantees that will everywhere satisfy the a hypergeometric system with the homogeneity parameter 1 s 1 sn related integral representations of a hypergeometric functions have been con sidered by several authors see for instance 9 and 3 it is probably instructive to examine a concrete special instance of the above theorem and we choose to present the case of the classical gauss hypergeometric function example 3 take a 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 to consist of the four corners of the unit square in the first quadrant it is easy to check that in this case a is given by the equation ea a a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 1 a 4 a 2 a 3 0 then consider the polynomial f z a 1 a 2 z 1 a 2 z 2 a 4 z 1 z 2 together with its associated mellin transform 22 m 1 f a s 0 0 zs 11 z s 2 2 a 1 a 2 z 1 a 3 z 2 a 4 z 1 z 2 dz 1 dz 2 z 1 z 2 let us compute this transform for simplicity first in the case a 1 a 2 a 3 1 writing f as 1 z 2 1 a 4 z 2 z 1 we can use formula 16 and first perform the integration with respect to z 1 this yields the expression s 1 1 s 1 0 1 z 2 s 1 1 1 a 4 z 2 s 1 zs 2 12 dz 2 for the mellin transform 22 re writing the integrand and expanding in a power series we find that the above integral equals 0 1 a 4 1 z 2 1 z 2 s 1 zs 2 12 dz 2 1 z 2 k 0 1 s 1 1 s 1 k k a 4 1 k 0 zs 2 k 12 dz 2 1 z 2 1 k so using the formula 0 wt 1 w 1 k dw w 1 k t 1 k t we find that 22 can be expressed as s 1 1 s 1 s 2 1 s 2 times k 0 1 s 1 s 2 k 1 s 1 k s 2 k 2 a 4 1 k k 0 s 1 k s 2 k s 1 s 2 k 2 1 a 4 k in other words we have shown that 1 1 1 a 4 s 1 s 2 2 f 1 s 1 s 2 1 1 a 4 using the homogeneities if corresponding to the row vectors of the matrix a 1 1 1 10 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 20 lisa nilsson mikael passare and the homogeneity parameter 1 s 1 s 2 we then easily recover the more general formula 23 a s as 1 s 2 11 a s 1 2 a s 2 3 2 f 1 s 1 s 2 1 1 a 1 a 4 a 2 a 3 notice that the three singular points 0 1 and for the gauss function correspond to the factors a 1 a 4 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 4 and a 2 a 3 of the principal a determinant ea the a hypergeometric system consists in this case of the single binomial equation 2 a 1 a 4 2 a 2 a 3 a s 0 together with the three homogeneity equations a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 a 3 a 4 a 4 1 a s 0 a 2 a 2 a 4 a 4 s 1 a s 0 a 3 a 3 a 4 a 4 s 2 a s 0 let us end by considering what happens as one of the variables ak vanishes from the gauss hypergeometric theorem one knows that for 1 2 1 there is an identity 2 f 1 s 1 s 2 1 1 1 s 1 s 2 1 s 1 1 s 2 so setting a 4 0 in the above formula 23 we get a 1 a 2 a 3 0 s 1 s 2 a s 1 s 2 1 1 a s 1 2 a s 2 3 1 s 1 s 2 1 s 1 1 s 2 this of course fits beautifully with the fact that the mellin transform m 1 f for the polynomial f z 1 z 2 a 1 a 2 z 1 a 3 z 2 is equal to as 1 s 2 11 a s 1 2 a s 2 3 s 1 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 compare with formula 16 above to treat the case a 1 0 we can use euler s hypergeometric transformation 2 f 1 a b 1 z 1 z 1 a b 2 f 1 1 a 1 b 1 z and re write formula 23 as a s as 2 12 a s 1 1 3 a 1 s 1 s 2 4 2 f 1 1 s 1 1 s 2 1 1 a 1 a 4 a 2 a 3 again using the hypergeometric theorem of gauss now for 1 1 1 2 1 or equivalently 1 2 1 we find that 0 a 2 a 3 a 4 s 1 s 2 a s 2 1 2 a s 1 1 3 a 1 s 1 s 2 4 s 1 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 which can be seen to concord with the formula for the mellin transform m 1 f with f z 1 z 2 a 2 z 1 a 3 z 2 a 4 z 1 z 2 finally the other two euler transformations 2 f 1 a b 1 z 1 z a 2 f 1 a 1 b 1 z z 1 1 z b 2 f 1 1 a b 1 z z 1 similarly lead to the formulas a 1 0 a 3 a 4 s 1 s 2 a s 2 1 1 a s 1 s 2 3 a s 1 4 s 2 s 1 1 s 1 s 2 and a 1 a 2 0 a 4 s 1 s 2 a s 1 1 1 a s 2 s 1 2 a s 2 4 s 1 s 2 s 1 1
