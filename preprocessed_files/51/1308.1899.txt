com jacques verstraete department of mathematics university of california at san diego california u s a jverstraete math ucsd edu abstract a maximal partial ovoid of a generalized quadrangle is a maximal set of points no two of which are collinear the problem of determining the smallest size of a maximal partial ovoid in quadrangles has been extensively studied in the literature in general theoretical lower bounds on the size of a maximal partial ovoid in a quadrangle of order s t are linear in s in this paper in a wide class of quadrangles of order s t we give a construction of a maximal partial ovoid of size at most s polylog s which is within a polylogarithmic factor of theoretical lower bounds the construction substantially improves previous quadratic upper bounds in quadrangles of order s s 2 in particular in the well studied case of the elliptic quadrics q 5 s 1 introduction generalized polygons were introduced in tits seminal paper on triality 23 and encompass as special cases projective planes and generalized quadrangles only a small set of examples of generalized quadrangles is known finite thick generalized quadrangles of order s t are known to exist only when s t t s q q 2 q 2 q 3 q q q 1 q 1 and q is a prime power the existence of further generalized quadrangles is one of the main open problems in projective geometry a standard reference on generalized quadrangles is payne and thas 19 and for generalized polygons see van maldeghem 27 research supported by marie curie ief grant gelati ec grant nr 328178 research supported by nsf grant dms 1101489 1 http arxiv org abs 1308 1899 v 1 a partial ovoid of a generalized quadrangle is a set of points no two of which are collinear the problem of determining the smallest size of a maximal partial ovoid in generalized quadrangles has been very extensively studied in the literature see de beule klein metsch and storme 8 and the references therein ovoids have a long history going back to the seminal work of tits and their construction and classification is the subject of many research articles over the last fifty years particular attention has been given to maximal partial ovoids in q 5 q ebert and hirschfeld 11 showed that any maximal partial ovoid in q 5 q has size at least 2 q 1 if q 2 and size at least 2 q 2 if q 5 maximal partial ovoids of size q 2 1 in q 5 q are easily constructed namely elliptic quadrics q 3 q q 5 q consisting of points collinear with a given point of q 5 q and further examples of the same size are given by aguglia cossidente and ebert 2 the best upper bound so far for q 5 q was given by metsch and storme see theorem 3 7 of 18 in the case q 22 h 1 h 1 and in this case a maximal partial ovoid of size roughly 1 2 q 2 was constructed this construction is geometric and the restriction on q comes from the fact that suzuki tits 24 ovoids are used 1 1 main theorem in a generalized quadrangle of order s t a simple counting argument shows that a maximal partial ovoid always has size at least 1 s st s 2 t 1 s st a quadrangle of order s t is called locally sparse if for any set of three points the number of points collinear with all three points is at most s 1 it is well known that every s s 2 quadrangle is locally sparse due to a result by bose and shrikhande 4 and in particular q 5 q is locally sparse however it is known that in some cases there may be sets of three points collinear with up to t 1 other points for instance in h 4 q 2 which is a quadrangle of order s t q 2 q 3 there are triples of points all collinear with the same q 3 1 other points 19 in this paper we show that locally sparse s t quadrangles with t s log s 2 have maximal partial ovoids which are within a polylogarithmic factor of the simple counting bound given above theorem 1 for any 4 there exists so such that if s so and t s log s 2 then any locally sparse generalized quadrangle of order s t has a maximal partial ovoid of size at most s log s since q 5 q is locally sparse this theorem improves the upper bound of roughly 1 2 q 2 for q 5 q to q log q for large q whilst the simple counting bound as well as the bounds in 11 are linear in q in fact as we do not require the quadrangle to be classical we also provide the first non trivial upper bounds in other quadrangles of order s s 2 in particular for kantor s quadrangles 15 and the t 3 o of tits 24 2 due to the point line duality for quadrangles in which the words point and line are interchanged theorem 1 shows that a quadrangle of order s t with the property that for any three lines at most t 1 lines intersect all three of those lines and s t log t 2 has a maximal partial spread of size at most t log t for instance the quadrangle h 3 q 2 dual to q 5 q has a maximal partial spread of size at most q log q the proof of theorem 1 gives an efficient two step randomized algorithm for finding a maxi mal partial ovoid of size at most s log s asymptotically almost surely probabilistic methods have been used in projective geometry by ga cs and szo nyi 12 for constructing small maximal partial spreads in projective spaces and by kim and vu 17 for constructing small complete arcs in projective planes by developing concentration inequalities for certain non lipschitz functions the probabilistic approach used here is slightly less technical than in 17 due to the careful application of a martingale inequality for non lipschitz functions of independent random variables this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we state the geometric and probabilistic preliminaries required to prove theorem 1 essentially concentration of measure inequalities and in section 3 we prove theorem 1 1 2 notation throughout the paper q will denote a thick quadrangle of order s t namely with s t 2 the set of lines of q is denoted l and the set of points is denoted p for a set r p let r denote the set of points collinear with all points in r and let r r r moreover r will denote the set of points collinear with at least one point in r and let r r r if r u then we write u instead of u and u instead of u so that r x r x and r x r x for the material to follow if x is a real number let fk x x x 1 x 2 x k 1 denote the k th falling factorial where f 0 x 1 for all x let n 0 1 2 for functions f g n r we write f g if limn f n g n 1 and f g if lim supn f n g n 1 if x r is a random variable and d r then x d denotes the event x d for an infinite sequence of events an n i we say that an occurs asymptotically almost surely a a s if p an 1 as n where the limit is taken over n i when we use expressions such as xu g s a a s we mean that for all 0 xu 1 g s a a s 3 2 preliminaries 2 1 generalized quadrangles let s t be positive integers a generalized quadrangle of order s t is an incidence structure q p l i in which p and l are disjoint non empty sets of objects called points and lines respectively and for which i is a symmetric point line incidence relation satisfying the following axioms first each point is incident with t 1 lines and two distinct points are incident with at most one common line second each line is incident with s 1 points and two distinct lines are incident with at most one common point third if x p l and x 6 then there is a unique x p l such that xi ix i from the axioms a quadrangle of order s t contains s 1 st 1 points and can only exist if s t s 2 by a result of d higman 13 14 with a simple combinatorial proof given later by cameron 5 recall that for a set r of points r denotes the set of points that are not in r and are collinear with all points in r in the case of a thick and locally sparse quadrangle q of order s t the following statements can be derived from the axioms see payne and thas 19 if r is a set of pairwise non collinear points of q then if r 1 r s t 1 1 if r 2 r t 1 2 if r 3 r s 1 3 the third statement is directly from the definition of a locally sparse quadrangle these properties will be used extensively to prove theorem 1 2 2 elementary inequalities we collect here some elementary inequalities that will be used throughout the proof from x x 2 log 1 x x for x 0 1 2 we obtain for reals xi 0 1 summing to n and with sum of squares equal to m e n m n i 1 1 xi e n 4 furthermore in the special cases x 1 x 2 xn x and xi i x we obtain the following pair of asymptotic formulas 1 x n e nx if nx 2 0 as n 5 fn x xn if n 2 x 0 as n 6 4 2 3 concentration inequalities we use three concentration inequalities in the proof of theorem 1 the first is an easy consequence of markov s inequality for concentration in the upper tail of fk x when x is a non negative integer valued random variable proposition 1 let k n r with k and x n be a random variable then p x e fk x fk proof since x is non negative integer valued the event x is contained in the event fk x fk therefore p x p fk x fk e fk x fk by markov s inequality a sum of independent random variables is concentrated according to the so called chernoff bound 7 we shall use the chernoff bound in the following form we write x bin n p to denote a binomial random variable with probability p over n trials proposition 2 let x bin n p then for 0 1 p x pn pn 2 e 2 pn 2 the final concentration inequality is an extension of the hoeffding azuma inequality 1 on martingales with bounded differences proposition 3 let zi m i 0 be a martingale such that i zi 1 zi b and let c c 1 c 2 cm rm and c 2 m i 1 c 2 i then for r p zm z 0 e 2 8 c 2 1 2 b m 1 i 1 p i ci a simpler but less general form of this inequality was given by shamir and spencer 20 and an essentially equivalent version was proved using stopping times by kim 16 a simple proof is given in chalker godbole hitczenko radcliff and ruehr see lemma 1 6 5 3 proof of theorem 1 3 1 a randomized algorithm we start by describing the two round randomized algorithm that will produce a maximal partial ovoid in a locally sparse quadrangle let q be a locally sparse quadrangle of order s t where t s 2 and t s log s 2 let p and l denote the point set and line set of q all limits and asymptotic notation in what follows is taken with respect to s first round fix a point x p and for each line through x independently flip a coin with heads probability ps s log t s log log s t 7 where 4 note ps 0 1 since t s log s 2 s log t if s is large enough on each line where the coin turned up heads select uniformly a point of x let s be the set of selected points and let u p s x the points in s are called covered by s and the points not in s are uncovered then u consists of the uncovered points which are not collinear with x note also that for any point y x p y s p the points not in s will be covered by a set t of points so that s t is a maximal partial ovoid the set t is described as follows second round let x x s on each line l through x with u 6 uniformly and randomly select a point of u these points together with a point on the line through x and x distinct from x and x form a partial ovoid t and s t is also clearly a partial ovoid for theorem 1 we must show that if s is large enough then there exists a choice of s and t such that s t is a maximal partial ovoid and also s t s log s 3 2 random variables we first show that in selecting s properties i iii described below occur simultaneously a a s as s property i for all lines l disjoint from x u log s property ii for all u x s u u s log s property iii for v w 6 s x with v w non collinear v w u log s 6 for u x let u u denote the set of points in p x which are not covered by s u and define the random variable xu u u u in the case u x s note that u u u so then xu u u for v w p x non collinear let u v w denote the set of points in p x which are not covered by s v w and define the random variable xvw v w u v w in the case v w 6 s x u v w u and so xvw v w u therefore to prove properties ii and iii it is sufficient to show that a a s xu s log s for all u x and xvw log s for all pairs of non collinear points v w p x assuming this is done theorem 1 is derived as follows 3 3 proof of theorem 1 from properties i iii first we show s s log t using the chernoff bound proposition 2 there are t 1 lines through x and we independently selected each line with probability ps and then one point on each selected line so s bin t 1 ps and e s ps t 1 s log t by proposition 2 for any 0 p s 1 s log t 2 exp 1 2 2 s log t 0 therefore a a s s s log t assuming that a a s s satisfies properties i iii we fix an instance of such a partial ovoid s with s s log t we now randomly select an additional set t of points as follows let x x s for each line through x such that u 6 randomly and uniformly choose a point of u let t be the set of those chosen points together with one point x distinct from x and x on the line through x and x note that the line through x and x has at least one other point since s 2 then no point in t is collinear with any point in s and no two points in t are collinear in particular x is not collinear with any point on a line through x since q is a quadrangle we estimate s t using property ii by property ii t xx 1 s log s therefore s t s xx 1 s log t s log s s log s as required for theorem 1 finally we show that a a s s t is a maximal partial ovoid using properties i and iii clearly all points on the line through x and x are covered by x and by construction of t all other points collinear with x are covered for v x s u not collinear with x a a s xvx 12 log s by property iii when s is large enough here x plays for instance the 7 role of w in the statement of property iii by property i for large enough s the probability that v is not collinear with any point in t is at most log s 1 log s xvx 1 1 log s 1 2 log s e 1 2 log s 3 1 s 5 since 4 since p s 1 st 1 s 4 since t s 2 the expected number of points in x s u not collinear with any point in t is at most s 5 p 1 s it follows that a a s x s u t which means that t covers all the points that were not covered by s this shows s t is a maximal partial ovoid and proves theorem 1 3 4 expected values the first step in proving properties i iii is to compute e xu and e xvw we show now that e xu s log s and e xvw log s lemma 1 let u x and let v w p x be a pair of non collinear points then e xu s log s and e xvw log s in addition if j n and jtp 2 0 as s then e xu j sj log s j proof fix u x and recall u u is the set of points in p x which are not covered by s u for y u x we have y x u t by 2 therefore p y u u 1 p t 8 in addition s points other than u are collinear with both u and x namely the points on the unique line through u and x by 1 u x s t 1 s st therefore for u x by 8 e xu y u x p y u u st 1 p t since sp 0 and tp 2 0 by definition of p we have from 5 that e xu st exp pt s log s 8 furthermore by the same argument and since jtp 2 0 we have from 5 that e xu j sj log s j to estimate e xvw for v w p x not collinear let y v w x recall u v w is the set of points in p x which are not covered by s v w by 3 t s y t 1 observe for y y we have y x v w t 1 v w x therefore for y y p y u v w 1 p t 1 v w x 1 p t 1 9 by 9 and the definition of xvw e xvw y y p y u v w y 1 p t t log s t log s this completes the proof that e xvw log s 3 5 proof of property i fix a line l disjoint from x and let y be the number of sequences of a log s distinct points in u x then since q is a quadrangle every point not on is collinear with at most one point on let r x be a set of a distinct points by 2 x y t 1 for all y x therefore y r x y at 1 10 since there is a unique point in x collinear with all points in r by 10 e y s s 1 s 2 s a 1 1 p at 1 since atp 2 0 and a 2 s 0 we may apply 5 and 6 to obtain e y sa log s a ta let as l x 6 y 1 since l t 1 st 1 st 2 is the total number of lines p as l x 6 p y 1 st 2 e y sa 1 log s a ta 2 since t s log s 2 and a log s p as 0 as s as required for property i 9 3 6 proof of property ii by lemma 1 e xu s log s for all u x let j log s 2 to show xu a a s we will apply proposition 1 together with the following claim claim for any u x e fj xu j proof of claim fix a sequence r of j distinct points in u x that is collinear with u but not on the line through u and x and let r u r u let d x u 6 r u then for a given line through x but not through u p s r u 1 p r u since lines through x are selected independently p r u u x u 6 1 p r u now we apply inequality 4 to obtain p r u u e pd by 2 x y u t for y r and by 3 x y z s 1 for y z r it follows by inclusion exclusion that d jt j 2 s 1 this shows p r u e pd e pjt pj 2 s 1 since u x st by 1 there are at most fj st choices for the sequence r by definition of xu e fj xu r u x r j p r u fj st e pjt pj 2 s 1 by definition of p and since t s log s pj 2 s 1 0 since pjt j log t j log log s e fj xu s j log s j by lemma 1 since jtp 2 0 we have j sj log s j as required for the claim 10 to prove property ii we combine the claim with proposition 1 where 1 and 0 1 is a fixed positive constant independent of s by proposition 1 p xu e fj xu fj 1 j e j by 4 since j log s 2 the above quantity is at most s log s provided s is large enough so the expected number of u such that the event xu occurs is at most asymptotic to s log s u s log s st 0 since t s 2 by markov s inequality p u x xu 1 0 as s since was arbitrary we find that a a s xu s log s for all u x 0 3 7 proof of property iii by lemma 1 e xvw log s for all pairs of non collinear points v w p x we show that a a s xvw using proposition 3 on a carefully chosen martingale fix a pair of non collinear points v w p x and recall u v w is the set of points in p x which are not covered by s v w let l be the set of lines through x which contain neither v nor w so t 1 l t 1 by 2 notation let satisfy 1 3 r l log s and let m log s we assume log s is an integer this does not affect the asymptotic computations below let l 1 l 2 lm be a partition of l into sets of r lines and mi l 1 l 2 li let li li and mi mi for i m for z x let z 1 if z s and z 0 otherwise definition of a martingale let z xvw and let zi e z fi where for 0 i m fi is the field generated by the random variables z z mi with m 0 then zi mi 0 is a doob martingale with difference sequence i zi 1 zi for 0 i m and z 0 e z let i v w x for y i let y 1 if y u v w and y 0 otherwise and define i y e y fi 1 e y fi then by definition of z i y i i y 11 distribution of differences for y i we note x y li li r for all i m therefore for y i i y z y mi 1 1 z 1 p l mi 1 z y mi 1 z 1 p l mi z y mi 1 z 1 p l mi z y li 1 1 z 1 p r 1 since mi ir we may use the above explicit formula for i y to determine the distribution of i y according to the following table the first column is the value of i y and the second column is the probability that i y equals the value in the first column for y i i y 1 p l ir 1 p ir 1 p i 1 r 1 p r 1 1 p l ir 1 p i 1 r 0 1 1 p ir we note that l t 1 t t 1 the random variable i y is not as easy to deal with as i y min i y 0 for y i the distribution of the latter is i y 1 p l ir 1 p ir 1 p i 1 r 0 1 1 p ir 1 p i 1 r let i y i i y note that e i y 0 expected values by definition of i y and the choice of r e i y 1 p l ir 1 p ir 1 1 p r 1 p l 1 1 p r 1 p l pr by 5 and l t 1 t t 1 1 p l log s t and so 1 p l pr log s t log t log s log s log t t then since i v w x t by 2 and 3 i e i y i e i y log s log t concentration this is the main part of the proof of property iii we use proposition 1 to show that i is highly unlikely to drop substantially below its expectation i note throughout that i 0 let k log s log t and log s log t note 0 as s since 1 and t s 2 we prove the following claim 12 claim for all i m p i 1 i t log t 2 proof of claim let y be the number of y i such that z 1 for some z y li 1 and z 0 for all z y mi note that since i t by 2 and 3 e y y i 1 p ir 1 1 p r t 1 p ir 1 1 p r t 1 p ir pr 11 also note that i y 1 p l ir by definition of i y for y i it follows that i 1 i y 1 e y let 1 e y let si 1 be the set of selected points in li 1 and w si 1 let r 1 if r s i 1 i and r 0 otherwise and let r 1 if for every y r y mi s and r 0 otherwise we apply proposition 1 p y e fk y fk by definition of fk y fk y r i r r where the sum is over all sequences r of k points in i note that the contribution to the sum of sequences r which are not subsets of s i 1 i is zero by definition of r and r for any sequence r of k points in i each y r is collinear with exactly one point on each line in mi so in total y is collinear with ir points in mi and r points in li 1 by inclusion exclusion y r y mi k ir k 2 s 1 since any two points in i are collinear with at most s 1 points in mi by 3 therefore p r 1 1 p k ir k 2 s 1 1 p kirepk 2 s 1 since pk 2 s 1 log t k 2 s 1 t and t s log s 2 we find p r 1 1 p kir now since r and r are independent random variables e fk y r i p r 1 p r 1 1 p kir r i p r 1 now r i r counts the number of sequences of k distinct points in i each collinear with at least one point in si 1 if r comprises points y 1 y 2 yk i then there exists a smallest 13 positive integer k such that si 1 contains distinct points z 1 z 2 z with zi y i for all i and y 1 y 2 yk are each collinear with at least one of z 1 z 2 z there are at most t 1 choices for y 1 y 2 y i since y i x li 1 r for all i there are at most r choices for zi for 1 i finally since each yi i is collinear with at least one of z 1 z 2 z there are at most k v w zi k k s 1 k choices for y 1 y 2 yk by 3 each such configuration has probability at most p therefore r i p r 1 k 1 pr t 1 k s 1 k pr k t 1 k k 0 pr k t 1 k 1 k 1 1 where k s 1 pr t 1 since t s log s 2 and r l log s and k log s log t we deduce ks r log t log s s t 0 as s and therefore r i p r 1 prt k as t 1 k tk by the choice of k it follows from 11 that e fk y 1 p kir prt k e y k since fk 1 ke y k by 6 proposition 1 gives p y 1 k for large enough s 1 and so log 1 2 2 therefore for large enough s log 1 k k 1 2 2 k 1 2 log t 2 it follows that p i 1 i p y 1 k t log t 2 this proves the claim 14 proof of property iii since i majorizes i and i 0 we conclude from the claim that p i 1 i p i 1 i t log t 2 now we apply proposition 3 let ci 1 i 1 log s log t for 0 i m then m 1 i 0 c 2 i log s 1 2 log s 2 2 log t 2 log s 2 log t 2 let b t 1 then i b for 0 i m so for any 0 1 independent of s p xvw 1 exp 2 2 8 c 2 1 2 b m 1 i 0 p i ci since log s the exponent in the first term is asymptotic to 2 8 log s 2 log s 2 log t 2 10 log s since 3 and t s 2 since m log s the second term is 1 2 b m 1 i 0 p i ci 1 2 b mt log t 2 s 10 using the claim so for any 0 1 and a fixed pair v w p x of non collinear points p xvw 1 2 s 10 therefore the expected number of pairs v w p x of non collinear points such that xvw 1 is at most p 2 s 10 s 4 t 2 s 10 s 2 since t s 2 by markov s inequality a a s every pair v w p x of non collinear points has xvw 1 since this is valid for arbitrary 0 and log s property iii is proved 4 concluding remarks in this paper we showed that any locally sparse quadrangle of order s t with t s log s 2 and s large enough has a maximal partial ovoid of size at most s log s when 4 the main obstruction to carrying out the same proof as theorem 1 for general quadrangles with t large enough relative to s is the locally sparse condition in particular in a quadrangle of order s t even with t large relative to s there may be sets of three points all collinear 15 with up to t 1 other points for instance in h 4 q 2 which is a quadrangle of order s t q 2 q 3 this situation arises 19 nevertheless we pose the following problem for all quadrangles problem 1 does every generalized quadrangle of order s t have a maximal partial ovoid of size at most s polylog s as s this should be compared with the easy linear lower bound s 1 st 1 s t 1 s which has been slightly improved to a larger constant times s in a number of special cases see de beule klein metsch and storme 8 and the references therein in some cases superlinear lower bounds on the size of a maximal partial ovoid in a quadran gle of order s t may be provable using explicit algebraic representations over finite fields this typically involves using known character sum inequalities for instance as in ga cs and szo nyi 12 we leave the open problem of determining whether a superlinear lower bound can be achieved in q 5 q problem 2 is there a function n r such that q as q and every maximal partial ovoid in q 5 q has size at least q q the randomized algorithm in this paper is very simple to implement and we believe it is effective in finding maximal partial ovoids even in s t quadrangles where s is not too large in addition it can be deduced from the proof that the probability that the algorithm does not return a maximal partial ovoid of size at most s log s 4 is at most s log s if s is large enough 5 acknowledgement we would like to thank j a thas for
