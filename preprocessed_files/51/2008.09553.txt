the moduli space of marked generalized cusps in real projective manifolds samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner abstract ln this paper a generalized cusp is a properly convex manifold with strictly convex boundary that is diffeomorphic to m 0 where m is a closed euclidean manifold these are classified in 2 the marked moduli space is homeomorphic to a subspace of the space of conjugacy classes of representations of 1 m it has one description as a generalization of a trace variety and another description involving weight data that is similar to that used to describe semi simple lie groups it is also a bundle over the space of euclidean similarity conformally flat structures on m and the fiber is a closed cone in the space of cubic differentials for 3 dimensional orientable generalized cusps the fiber is homeomorphic to a cone on a solid torus a generalized cusp is a properly convex real projective manifold c such that c is diffeomorphic to 0 1 c and 1 c is virtually nilpotent and c contains no line segment from now on in this paper we use the term generalized cusp in the narrow sense that c is also compact it was shown in 2 0 7 this implies that 1 c is virtually abelian and that c has a natural affine structure that is a stiffening of the projective structure let an denote affine space and aff n the affine group then c 1 c where an is a non compact convex closed set bounded by a strictly convex hypersurface that covers c and 1 c aff n is the holonomy the moduli space of marked generalized cusps turns out to be a beautiful object with in teresting structure that admits several different descriptions we concentrate on the case that c rn 1 zn 1 then the holonomy extends over v rn 1 in this case the moduli space tn consists of all conjugacy classes of monomorphisms of rn 1 into aff n such that the orbit of a generic point is a properly embedded strictly convex hypersurface then tn p f where p is the space of unimodular positive definite quadratic forms on v and f is the space consisting of all unordered n tuples of pairwise orthogonal vectors allowing 0 in v r that all have the same non negative r coordinate it follows that one may view a generalized cusp as a euclidean manifold with extra structure obtained by a deformation of a standard cusp i e equivalent to one in a hyperbolic manifold the bundle structure on the moduli space admits several descriptions a generalized cusp is determined up to equivalence by the complete invariant comprising the character v r of together with the projective class of a positive definite quadratic form on v a generalized cusp is also determined by together with the lie algebra weights i v r of that are arbitrary subject to a simple geometric constraint 1 the weights may be regarded as harmonic 1 forms representing elements of h 1 c these 1 forms determine transversally measured foliations on c which together with the similarity structure determine c for non diagonalizable holonomy the cohomology classes are arbitrary subject to being pairwise orthogonal with respect to the dual of the next description is differential geometric as the projective class of the sum of a quadratic and a cubic differential both defined on c this exhibits tn as the product of the space of flat conformal structures on c times a cone in the space of cubic polynomials on v the second factor is a closed cone in s 3 v that is not a manifold points in the interior of this cone correspond to date august 24 2020 1 ar x iv 2 00 8 09 55 3 v 1 m at h g t 2 1 a ug 2 02 0 2 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner diagonalizable holonomy the cone point corresponds to a standard cusp the cubic is a weighted sum of the cubes of the weights and it is harmonic if and only if is an affine sphere for three manifolds this data is encoded by w r h c 3 subject to imw 0 and r 3 h here w determines the conformal structure on c and r h are respectively the radial and harmonic components of the cubic polynomial the generalized cusp is standard with cusp shape w if and only if r h 0 1 summary of results given hom rn r with e 1 e 2 en 0 a generalized cusp lie group g aff n was defined in 2 and generalized cusps correspond to lattices in g two generalized cusps are equivalent if they deformation retract to affinely isomorphic cusps every generalized cusp is equivalent to a homogeneous one for which g acts transitively on for these there is a natural underlying euclidean metric on c this metric is covered by one on c an that is conformally equivalent to the second fundamental form and is scaled so that volume c 1 it follows from the bieberbach theorems that c has a finite cover by a generalized cusp with boundary a torus tn 1 rn 1 zn 1 these are called torus cusps and we concentrate on them the general case reduces to this by 1 6 set v rn 1 it is shown in 10 that g contains a unique subgroup tr v called the translation subgroup that acts simply transitively on moreover the image of the holonomy zn 1 tr is a lattice thus extends to an isomorphism v tr called the extended holonomy the moduli space of equivalence classes of marked generalized cusps diffeomorphic to c is denoted t c and tn t tn 1 0 it consists of equivalence classes of developing maps the map that sends a point in t c to the conjugacy class of the extended holonomy identifies t c with the subspace rep c of the quotient space hom v aff n aff n consisting of conjugacy classes of isomorphisms onto translation subgroups see 4 4 fenchel nielsen coordinates provide a lift of teichmuller space into the representation variety however we do not know if it is possible to lift t c into hom 1 c aff n let an be the closed weyl chamber of sl n 1 r there is a family of representations param eterized by an slv theorem 4 5 says the holonomy map identifies tn with the quotient of an slv where a is identified to a whenever a 1 a lies in a certain orthogonal group that depends on the euclidean structure on c pulls back to give a unimodular positive definite quadratic form on v the character v r is given by v trace v the complete invariant of is it plays the role in our theory that the character plays in the theory of semi simple representations namely two representations have the same complete invariant if and only if they are conjugate the trace variety v is the set of all characters let xn be the set of all topologized as a subspace of v ps 2 v theorem 1 1 the complete invariant tn xn is a homeomorphism in 11 dold studies the symmetric product spnx n 1 x sn of a topological space x where the symmetric group sn permutes factors when x v and n 1 this is distinct from the vector space sn v of symmetric tensors of degree n the linear part of the holonomy has n weights exp i counted with multiplicity where i v and these give a point 1 n spn v the following description of the moduli space is reminiscent of the classification of semi simple lie groups via roots let p s 2 v be the space of unimodular positive definite quadratic forms on v define rn to be the subspace of all 1 n in spn v p satisfying the weights equation 0 i 6 j i j 1 where is the inner product on v dual to a geometrical interpretation of this condition is given in 20 generalized cusps 3 theorem 1 2 the weight data is tn rn given by and is a homeomorphism and rn is a semi algebraic set moreover generalized cusps with non diagonalizable holonomy form the subspace of rn where 0 let fn v 1 vn spn v 0 i 6 j vi vi and un slv be the group of upper triangular unipotent matrices there is a bundle isomorphism un fn rn given by a v 1 vn 1 n ata where i v vi av the type of is the number of non trivial distinct weights of and can be any integer 0 t n it equals the number of non zero coordinates of and also of there is an affine projection 0 t each fiber has the geometry of horoball in hn t the geometry transverse to the fibers is hex geometry the projective geometry of an open simplex see 2 section 1 5 the similarity structure is part of a certain kind of geometric structure on c called a cusp geometry that uniquely determines the cusp up to equivalence the extra structure consists of t transversally measured codimension 1 foliations with flat leaves the foliations are the preimages of foliations of 0 t by coordinate hyperplanes when t n then these foliations are arbitrary subject to being pairwise orthogonal the transverse measures are harmonic 1 forms representing the cohomology classes i given by the weights the cusp geometry is also encoded by a polynomial j called the shape invariant defined up to scaling that is the sum of the quadratic and a cubic this gives an embedding of the marked moduli space into the vector space of such polynomials projection onto the quadratic term exhibits the moduli space as a bundle over p the fiber is a cone in the space of cubic differentials the cubic is a linear combination of the cubes of the weights 37 this is reminiscent of the result of hitchin 15 labourie 17 and loftin 19 that the moduli space of properly convex structures on a closed surface is a vector bundle over the space of conformal structures with fiber the space of holomorphic cubic differentials however in general the cubic differentials for generalized cusps are not holomorphic the polynomial j is defined as follows choose a basepoint b rn and an affine map rn r so that b 0 and int 0 the hyperplane h 1 0 is then tangent to at b the hypersurface is parameterized by the function v given by the orbit v v b of b the function h can be thought of as the height of points in above h however is not the graph of h see 6 16 then j v r is the 3 jet of h normalized so the quadratic term is unimodular the cubic is zero if and only if c is equivalent to a cusp in a hyperbolic manifold this is similar to 20 thm 4 5 that an affine hypersurface is quadratic if and only if a certain cubic differential form vanishes identically there is a subspace jn p s 2 v s 3 v defined in 6 3 and theorem 1 3 if n 3 then the shape invariant j tn jn is a homeomorphism moreover the projection jn p is a trivial bundle with fiber homeomorphic to a closed cone in s 3 v the cubic is harmonic if and only if is an affine sphere the moduli space tn is stratified by type the stratum for each type is a manifold whose dimension increases with type see proposition 4 7 the frontier of the stratum of type t consists of the union of strata of smaller type the largest type corresponds to diagonalizable holonomy in particular corollary 1 4 every generalized cusp is a geometric limit of diagonalizable cusps it seems hard to show this directly another consequence is theorem 1 5 tn is contractible of dimension k n 2 n and is manifold if and only if n 2 suppose m en g is a closed euclidean manifold with holonomy 1 m isom en using the decomposition isom en o n n rn gives a surjection r isom en o n called the rotational part by the bieberbach theorems 3 6 m has a finite cover by a torus tn en h where h is a lattice in rn thus r 1 m is a finite subgroup f o n and we may choose 4 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner h kerr applying this to the generalized cusp c m 0 shows that there is a finite cover p c c corresponding to h and c tn 0 this cover induces a map p t c t c that sends an affine structure on c to the structure on c that covers it this structure on c is preserved by the action of f by covering transformations using the identification of a structure with its holonomy gives an algebraic formulation since h is an abelian normal subgroup of g the action of g on h by conjugation determines a homomorphism f aut h define rep c rep c f f f where denotes conjugate representations theorem 1 6 the map hol p t c rep c is a homeomorphism a generalized cusp c in a 3 manifold is determined by three complex numbers w h r subject to imw 0 and c 3 h the conformal structure on c is c z zw the parameter w was used by thurston to describe cusps in hyperbolic 3 manifolds there is a unique upper triangular matrix a aw sl 2 r with positive eigenvalues such that the mobius transformation corresponding to a satisfies w i then the quadratic term in j is qw a ta s 2 r 2 after identifying r 2 c a cubic p s 3 r 2 is uniquely expressible as p re hz 3 re rz z 2 for some h r c the first term is harmonic and the second is called radial theorem 1 7 there is a homeomorphism t 3 w h r c 3 im w 0 r 3 h if x w h r then j x qw c with qw aw as above and c re hz 3 rz z 2 aw this result determines exactly which cubic differentials appear one may regard the generalized cusp for w h r as a deformation of the hyperbolic cusp corresponding to w 0 0 the generalized cusps with a fixed conformal structure w on the boundary are parameterized by a point in h r c 2 r 3 h this is a cone on a solid torus the cubic is harmonic if and only if r 0 in which case either the cusp holonomy is conjugate in gl 4 r into a unipotent subgroup of o 3 1 or else into the diagonal subgroup of aff r 3 where the determinant is one we assume the reader is familiar with the main results and definitions up to the end of section 1 from 2 each facet of the closed weyl chamber an rn parameterizes those translation groups tr of a fixed type the main new ingredient 3 4 is a connected set a n of representations that give conjugates of generalized cusps of all types the set a n is obtained by a kind of iterated blowup of an in the sense of algebraic geometry and each fiber of each blowup consists of pairwise conjugate representations there seems to be no obvious way to replace a n by a continuous family containing only one representative of each conjugacy class the subspace of a n consisting of guys of type t is the interior of a compact manifold m with boundary the direction that a sequence n int m a n converges to a point p m determines a point in a n that is some conjugate of some representation corresponding to p the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we review the translation groups tr and show that a marked translation group is uniquely determined by the complete invariant in section 3 we introduce a connected space a n that continuously parameterizes translation groups of all types in section 4 we prove the complete invariant provides an embedding of the marked moduli space tn in section 5 we obtain the characterization 1 of the weights of marked translation groups in section 6 we show that a marked translation group is determined by the sum of a quadratic and a cubic differential in section 7 we compute t 3 the marked moduli space for 3 manifolds various routine computational proofs were moved into an appendix to avoid disrupting the flow of ideas the proof that the shape invariant determines a marked translation group that is unique up to conjugacy is a rather long and technical computation in lemma 6 9 that is an ad hoc algebraic argument perhaps there is a better way to establish this with some differential geometry the generalized cusps 5 various descriptions of the moduli space only gradually emerged as we stumbled upon various clues in particular the new parameters in section 2 were discovered by a very circuitous route we thank kent vashaw for assistance with some representation theory and daniel fox for providing references

denote the extended domain of the holonomy of a marked generalized cusp and e 1 ek is the standard basis of rk and e 1 e k is the dual basis of the dual vector space if x rn then gl x gl n r is the subgroup that preserves x affine space is an rn 1 rn 1 and the affine group is aff n gl an gl n 1 r if x an then aff x aff n is the subgroup that preserves x what follows up to theorem 2 5 is from 2 definition 2 1 suppose an is a closed convex subset bounded by a non compact properly embedded strictly convex hypersurface also suppose aff contains a subgroup t t v that acts simply transitively on then t is called a translation group and the group g aff that preserves each t orbit is called a cusp lie group the subgroup t is unique the t orbit of a point in is called a horosphere horospheres are smooth strictly convex hypersurfaces that foliate in particular is a horosphere moreover g aff unless hn in which case g is conjugate into a subgroup po n 1 a generalized cusp is an affine manifold where g is a torsion free lattice choose a basepoint b the subgroup o b g that fixes b is called a cusp orthogonal group and is compact and g o b n t different notation was used for this in 2 definition 1 45 we focus on torus cusps then the holonomy is an isomorphism zn 1 t the extended holonomy is the extension of this homomorphism to an isomorphism v t definition 2 2 a marked translation group is an isomorphism v t where t aff n is a translation group given a marked translation group there is a direct sum decomposition 2 v d u where u is the subgroup of unipotent elements and d is the subgroup of elements for which the largest jordan block has size 2 thus d contains the diagonalizable subgroup in the notation of 2 1 41 u p and d t 2 definition 2 3 the type t rn z the unipotent rank u rn z and the rank r rn z are defined for x x 1 xn by t x i xi 6 0 r x min t x n 1 u x r x n 1 these functions are used in the context of two families of marked translation groups that involve a parameter x rn and for these r x dimd and u x dimu and t x is the number of non constant weights of if rn r is a homomorphism we will often identify with 1 n rn where i ei definition 2 4 the group tr v is defined as follows an 1 n 1 2 n 0 aun 1 n i i 0 t i 0 i t unordered if aun set t t and u u and r r if t 0 set e and 0 otherwise define v and e by v 1 vn 1 v 1 vn 1 0 e t diag v 1 vr 6 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner define v aff n by v exp f v where f v t n 1 t n 1 t n e 0 0 0 vr 1 vr u v 0 0 vr 1 0 0 vr u 0 0 0 e 0 00 0 v 0 0 0 e 0 00 v 0 0 0 0 observe that r u n 1 since all the eigenvalues are positive v tr is an isomorphism so tr rn 1 it follows from 2 theorem 0 2 and we show below that is conjugate to if and only if however tr and tr are conjugate subgroups if and only if s for some s 0 theorem 2 5 a tr is a translation group b if s 0 then s s ir iu suppose v aff n is a marked translation group then c an and b sl v such that is conjugate to b d aun and b sl v such that is conjugate to b proof b the definition shows fs v 1 vn 1 f sv 1 svr vr 1 vr u a given a marked translation group v aff n then by 2 theorem 0 1 there is an such that v is conjugate into the group t defined in 2 definition 1 32 moreover if 6 0 we may choose t 1 and then t tr as in 2 4 this proves a it follows that a for some a gl v if r 0 then there is s 0 so that a s ir iu b with b sl v then s b by b if r 0 then 0 and 0 s i is conjugate to 0 thus in this case we may also choose b sl v to show is unique by 2 theorem 0 2 is unique up to multiplication by some s 0 suppose b is conjugate to s b then is conjugate to s b b 1 and thus to s ir iu b b 1 by 2 theorem 0 2 s ir iu b b 1 o en 1 by 2 1 44 this is a subgroup of the orthogonal group thus s 1 this proves c for d when n 2 the result is easy so assume n 3 and detb 1 there are two coordinates i i 1 of that are either both zero or both non zero swapping columns i and i 1 of b gives b sl v and swapping i and i 1 gives aun then b is conjugate to b by swapping the i and i 1 coordinates in rn 1 we regard the second symmetric power s 2 v as the vector space of homogeneous polynomials v r of degree two the subspace p v s 2 v consists of positive definite forms and p v p v is the subspace of unimodular forms let p p v p v be the projection p det 1 n 1 the notation means there is 0 with given a marked translation group v aff n the orbit map b v is the homeomorphism defined by 3 b v v b where b is some choice of basepoint since is smooth and strictly convex there is a unique affine hyperplane hb an with hb b there is an affine map an r with hb 0 and int 0 the height function 4 h b v r is only defined up to multiplication by a positive real we remind the reader that is not the graph of h see 6 16 note that if b is a different choice of basepoint then there is unique element generalized cusps 7 a t such that ab b in this case a 1 is an affine map such that hb 0 and int 0 furthermore b a b and so b b it follows that the height function is independent of the choice of basepoint since is strictly convex one obtains positive definite quadratic forms 5 d 2 h p p v after rescaling the orbit map is an isometry from v to with the horosphere metric 2 2 14 the form is only defined up to scaling to emphasize this we usually work with pp however it is sometimes convenient to use the natural identification p pp then one must remember that preserving only means is preserved up to rescaling writing v n 1 i 1 viei and ui b vi v 0 r n then u 1 un 1 is a basis of the tangent space tb hb we may use x det u 1 un 1 x and a height function is then given by 6 h v det u 1 un 1 b v b where the sign is chosen so that 0 the space hom v aff n is given the weak topology this coincides with the euclidean topology when it is realized as an algebraic subset of euclidean space the space hom v aff n aff n is the quotient space under the action of conjugacy it is not hausdorff in section 4 we define t v as equivalence classes of developing maps and show it is homeomorphic to rep v various functions defined on rep v in this section can then be re interpreted as functions on t v definition 2 6 r ep v hom v aff n is the subspace of marked translation groups and rep v r ep v aff n is the space of conjugacy classes with the quotient topology lemma 2 7 r ep v p v is smooth and covers a continuous map rep v p v proof by the discussion above does not depend on the choice of basepoint b or height function used above given a marked translation group every choice of basepoint b has orbit a convex hypersurface unless b lies is a projective subspace preserved by thus in a neighborhood of in r ep v a fixed choice of basepoint b can be used for the orbit map 2 1 52 then the function r ep v v r given by v b v is smooth near v equations 3 and 6 then imply h is smooth near so is smooth it is clear that is invariant under conjugation of therefore covers a map rep v p v which is continuous by properties of the quotient topology the character of a homomorphism v gl n 1 r is v r given by trace the trace variety v is the set of characters of all such homomorphisms hom v affn is a real algebraic variety and v is its image under a polynomial map thus v is a semi algebraic set and in particular is homeomorphic to a subset of euclidean space by 2 5 a marked translation group is conjugate to an upper triangular group the character is not changed by conjugation the character of an upper triangular representation is a function on v that is the sum of n 1 functions each of which is the exponential of an element of v thus the subspace of v consisting of characters of marked translation groups is homeomorphic to a subspace of spn 1 v definition 2 8 given a marked translation group v aff n then the horosphere metric is the unimodular quadratic form p v the complete invariant is also o gl v is the subgroup that preserves both and lemma 2 13 implies o is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of unless t 0 in which case it is the group of euclidean similarites fixing 0 proposition 2 9 the complete invariant rep v v p s 2 v is continuous 8 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner proof it is well known that is continuous and is continuous by 2 7 a dual vector v is a lie algebra weight of v gl n 1 r and exp is a weight if the weight space v v v ker v exp v 6 0 let be the inner product on v given by let s 2 v denote the dual quadratic form defined by v if x v x let be inner product on v given by the proof of the following is routine and in the appendix proposition 2 10 given aun the decomposition v d u for is orthogonal with respect to set u u and t t then where for v v t n t n v t i 1 iv 2 i 1 t n 1 i t 1 v 2 i v n 1 i 1 iv 2 i 1 n n 1 i 1 ivi 2 v 2 u t i 1 exp tvi v 1 n 1 i 1 exp nvi exp n 1 i 1 ivi moreover when t n then det 1 t 1 t 2 nt and the non zero lie algebra weights of are i te i 1 i t and their duals are an orthogonal basis of d and i 2 t det 1 n 1 1 i also when t n then det 1 n 1 1 n n i 1 i theorem 2 15 shows that the complete invariant determines a marked translation group up to conjugacy theorem 6 14 shows the same for the shape invariant the strategy is the same in both cases one argument shows the invariant determines the translation group up to conjugacy the second part is to show that the invariant determines the stabilizer of a point o b g corollary 2 11 suppose n 3 and v aff n is a marked translation group then is conjugate to b for some 1 n an and b sl v and the complete invariant uniquely determines proof by 2 5 b is conjugate to some b with b sl v and is uniquely determined by the conjugacy class of if t n then is diagonal so determines up to conjugacy and hence determines by 2 5 b so suppose t n it follows immediately from the definitions that b b and i b i b hence i b i by 2 10 it follows that determines 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 nt 1 n 1 11 1 t up to permutations let xi log i and yi log i and x x 1 xt and y y 1 yt define v rt r by v x log 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 nt 1 n 1 n 1 1 x 1 xt 1 t 4 3 n xt let e 1 1 then y x v x e i g x where g e v then determines y and recovering the i amounts to finding x that solves the linear equation y i g x we claim that i g is invertible for the sake of contradiction assume that 0 6 w ker i g then w v w e 0 this implies that w e for some 6 0 since all non zero multiples of w are also in the kernel there is no loss of generality in assuming that 1 this implies that e v e e 0 and so v e 1 from the definition of v the equation v e 1 becomes n 1 1 2 t 3 3 n 1 or equivalently that t 2 n 2 however since n 3 this implies that t n which is a contradiction it follows that the xi can be recovered from the yi and by exponentiating we recover the i the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix a is c a det x i a an affine auto morphism of rn is given by f x ax b with linear part a gl n r and also given by b aff n gl n 1 r then c b x 1 c a this means that a translation group has generalized cusps 9 one more zero lie algebra weight than the linear part the character of a marked translation group determines the weights lemma 2 12 suppose v aff n is a marked translation group let 1 n spn v be the lie algebra weights of the linear part of then the characteristic polynomial c v r x given by c det xi x 1 n i 1 x exp i is uniquely determined by moreover there is f xn rn with f where tn rn is the weight data proof suppose a v then kv ak so kv traceak if a has eigenvalues 0 n counted with multiplicity then pk trace a k ki is a symmetric polynomial function of the eigenvalues every symmetric polynomial is a polynomial in the pk and in particular the coefficients of c a have this property hence determines the characteristic polynomial of v for every v v thus determines the function c c v r x which sends v v to the characteristic polynomial of v since all the eigenvalues of v are positive there are i v with c n i 0 x exp i hence determines the lie algebra weights i the factorization of a polynomial into linear factors is unique up to order and scaling it follows that is also uniquely determined and thus f exists given a translation group t together with a basepoint b then o b g is the subgroup that fixes b and acts on rn preserving the orbit map b identities v rn 1 with therefore o b also acts on v under this identification o b aff rn is conjugate to o gl v when t 0 the group sim glv is the group of similarities that preserve lemma 2 13 suppose is a marked translation group if t 0 then there is an isomorphism f o b o given by f a 1 a where b v is the orbit map if t 0 then o sim proof let and t t by definition o is the subgroup of sim that preserves if t 0 then is unipotent so is constant and the result follows now assume t 0 thus is not constant we claim that o is a subgroup of o the character v r is preserved by the action of o now o sim so if the claim is false there is a o that moves all points in v closer to 0 it follows that v limn a nv 0 so is constant which is a contradiction we claim that f maps into o the orbit map b defined in 3 is given by v v b recall that is the orbit of b under im given a o b and v v then a v u for some u v and fa v u since a fixes b it follows that u b u a v a v b a v a 1 ab a v a 1 b now a v a 1 t and the action of v on is free thus u a v a 1 so fa v u 1 a v a 1 now and conjugation by a are both group isomorphisms thus fa is a group automorphism of v and it is continuous thus fa glv now trace fa v trace u tracea v a 1 trace v thus fa it is clear that fa preserves hence fa o which proves the claim the lemma is true for if and only if it is true for a conjugate of b for some b gl v by theorem 2 5 it suffices to prove the result when set t t first consider the case 0 t n and define b diag 1 2 1 1 2 t 1 2 t 1 2 t gl v 10 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner it suffices to assume b by 2 10 v v v v 2 u t i 1 exp 1 2 i tvi where is the standard inner product on rn 1 by 2 12 determines and is determined by the lie algebra weights of thus o is the subgroup of o that preserves the lie algebra weights hence it is the subgroup that preserves the set consisting of the duals vi 1 i n v with respect to of these weights by 24 the non zero duals are vi i 1 tei 1 i t the action of o permutes this set but preserves the lengths of vectors thus o is the subgroup of o that permutes ei 1 i t and preserves the vector 1 t 1 1 1 r 0 0 v where the last u coordinates are 0 clearly this is the same as preserving 1 r 0 0 v let s be the group of coordinate permutations of rr that preserve 1 r then o s o u when t n it follows from 2 proposition 1 44 that f o b s o u which gives the result the remaining case is that t n and then has n non zero lie algebra weights i v and i i 0 observe that is determined up to scaling by this equation if b o then it preserves and therefore by 2 12 permutes these weights so that i b i for some permutation of 1 n however i i 0 so i i thus b 1 a aff n permutes the coordinate axes of rn and preserves again by 2 proposition 1 44 a o b it follows that o 1 o b it is clear that o 1 o b suppose v aff n is a marked translation group if we consider a generalized cusp as a projective manifold instead of as an affine one then the holonomy might be given as v sl n 1 r where 7 v v v and v det v 1 n 1 it was shown in 2 prop 1 29 that if two marked translation groups are conjugate in gl n 1 r then they are conjugate in aff n and therefore have the same complete invariant in 2 14 below we show if v sl n 1 r is the corresponding projective translation group then determines however computations are simpler using we now explain how to recover from the idea is that to recover the affine action amounts to determining the weight of that corresponds to the hyperplane at infinity for affine space suppose v gl n 1 r and every weight is real and positive letw 0 1 n be the lie algebra weights of counted with multiplicity the lie algebra weight i is called a middle weight if v v i v max j v j 6 i applied to diagonalizable representations this is the middle eigenvalue condition of choi 8 it follows that a lie algebra weight with multiplicity larger than 1 is a middle weight if v aff n then i is a middle weight of if and only if i 0 from 7 it follows that if w 0 1 n then w 0 n where n 1 1 i the characterization above implies that is a middle weight for if and only if is a middle weight for since the middle weight of only depends on this shows determines proposition 2 14 let v aff n be a marked translation group and v sl n 1 r as above then determines and vice versa proof the characteristic polynomial c is determined by using 2 12 the constant term of c determines det v r and therefore det 1 n 1 is determined conversely given the characteristic polynomial c is determined by 2 12 and so the lie algebra weights generalized cusps 11 i 1 i n of are determined thus the middle weight of is determined by and exp has middle weight 0 theorem 2 15 if v aff n are marked translation groups then if and only if and are conjugate in aff n proof it is clear that the complete invariant is a conjugacy invariant we show that if then and are conjugate by 2 12 determines the characteristic polynomial and weights of counted with multiplicity the type of is the maximum over v v of the number of eigenvalues of v that are not equal to 1 this is determined by v so determines t in particular t t the first case is that t n so is diagonalizable since t n then is also diago nalizable and therefore semi simple the character of a semisimple representation determines the representation up to conjugacy see for example 18 pp 650 hence and are conjugate in gl n 1 r this implies they are conjugate in aff n if t 0 then the generalized cusps are equivalent to cusps in hyperbolic manifolds it is well known that these are determined by the euclidean similarity structure on the boundary and hence by now assume 0 t n by 2 15 every marked translation group is conjugate in aff n to some b where b sl v and an after conjugacies in aff n we may assume b and b are both of this form observe that and are conjugate if and only if b 1 and b 1 are conjugate thus it suffices to assume that and b by 2 11 is determined by the complete invariant hence so b thus b we are given that so it follows that b o then by lemma 2 13 b 1 bp b for some p o b claim p p 1 since 1 bp b given v v and recalling b is the basepoint and using b v v b gives v u where u 1 b p v b v now p o b fixes the basepoint b so p v b p v p 1 b p v p 1 b thus u b b u p v b p v p 1 b now u and p v p 1 are both in t which acts freely on thus v u p v p 1 so p p 1 as claimed there is an interpretation of the complete invariant as a geometric structure on the boundary of a generalized cusp definition 2 16 a cusp geometry on a torus t rn 1 zn 1 is c where is a euclidean metric on t with volume 1 and c h 1 t r 0 the type of the geometry is t c if v aff n is a marked translation group then there is a properly convex set rn that is preserved by v and c zn 1 is a generalized cusp given b the orbit map b v is a homeomorphism let c be projection then c b v c can be regarded as the universal cover of c a cusp geometry 1 t of type t t on c is defined as follows the metric on c is as defined above the character determines lie algebra weights of the representation i v r for 1 i t and i i h 1 c r is determined by i i thus i is the harmonic representative of the de rham class i generalized cusps with type t n correspond to choices of non zero cohomology classes that are orthogonal with respect to the dual of and all such cusp geometries are realized by generalized cusps those of type t n are determined by 1 observe that one can recover the complete invariant from the cusp geometry 12 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner proposition 2 17 suppose 1 2 v aff n are marked translation groups and ci i i v are corresponding generalized cusps then 1 and 2 are conjugate if and only if there is a map f c 1 c 2 that preserves the cusp geometries defined above and f is in the correct homotopy class proof the existence of f implies the two generalized cusps have the same complete invariant then 1 and 2 are conjugate by 2 15 conversely if 1 and 2 are conjugate then c 1 and c 2 are equivalent cusps and so have the same cusp geometry 3 new parameters in this section we define another family of translation groups in 3 4 first we motivate the definition in dimension n 4 the reader may choose to replace 4 by n in what follows and introduce in the formulae the goal is to construct a connected algebraic family of lie groups that give conjugates of all the translation groups tr and such that the diagonalizable ones are dense recall that t n is diagonalizable and t n is non diagonalizable refer to 2 10 for the following discussion if we reparameterize in the diagonal case using ti ivi then t t 2 2 where 1 2 n n 1 i 1 iti when n maxi i then n t so varies in a compact subset of p s 2 v hence if the character remains bounded along a sequence in this subspace there is a subsequence for which the complete invariants converge then after a suitable conjugacy the limit should be a marked generalized cusp of smaller type to obtain an algebraic family set i 1 2 i then vi iti the diagonal group tr consists of the matrices exp m for those m shown below satisfying 9 8 m 1 t 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 t 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 t 3 0 0 0 0 0 4 t 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 p 1 12 1 3 1 4 2 1 0 1 0 0 12 0 0 1 0 13 0 0 0 1 14 0 0 0 0 1 9 0 ivi 1 2 i iti 1 i ti the orbits flatten

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 since i decreases with i it follows that i increases with i we want this new family to contain only polynomials rather than rational functions in the parameters so that they are defined whenever 11 0 1 2 3 4 to do this we introduce extra parameters i for 2 i 4 and require 12 i i 1 then r 0 t 2 t 3 t 4 0 0 2 t 2 0 0 t 2 0 0 3 t 3 0 t 3 0 0 0 4 t 4 t 4 0 0 0 0 0 t 1 1 2 3 4

parameterized by those satisfying 11 and 12 when 1 0 then i 1 i 0 1 so determines 0 1 3 we will see that the conjugacy class of the image group only depends on thus the same collection of conjugacy classes of groups is obtained by restricting to i 0 1 restricting to a compact set helps later with the point set topology when we quotient out by this compact set finally since t 1 is expressed in terms of the other ti the terms for i 1 are different to the other terms thus we replace the index set 1 i 4 by 0 i 3 to emphasize the special role of 0 this leads to the following definitions given hom rn r define i 1 ei the subspace 13 an 0 n 1 0 0 1 2 n 1 rn is called the closed weyl chamber it is a fundamental domain for the action by signed coordinate permutations on rn observe that i 0 if only if t n and i u the blown up weyl chamber is 14 a n an 0 1 n 1 0 i i the projections p 1 a n an and p 2 a n 0 1 n 1 are defined by p 1 and p 2 since i 0 it follows that p 1 is surjective when i 6 0 then i 0 i is determined by i however when i 0 then 0 0 also thus i 0 1 is arbitrary one may regard a n as obtained from an by a kind of blowup of the subset of an where 0 0 and the coordinates record certain tangent directions when some of the coordinates of are zero we make frequent use of the following inverse function theorem lemma 3 1 13 corollary 10 1 6 let f x y be a continuous bijection between locally compact spaces if y is hausdorff and f is a proper map then f is a homeomorphism let dn 0 n 0 1 n 1 0 i i a point in dn determines a diagonalizable marked translation group via 3 4 however the coordinates of are in arbitrary order subject only to 0 min i rather than non increasing lemma 3 2 given a n set t t and u u if t n then p 2 p 11 if t n then p 2 p 1 1 0 1 u 0 where 0 0 0 0 1 n 1 u moreover a a n cldn b p 1 has compact fibers c p 1 a n an is a quotient map proof if t n then all i 0 and determines otherwise t n and i 0 if and only if i u for i 1 then i is the set of solutions in 0 1 of 0 0 i i for 1 i u then i 0 and i 0 1 is arbitrary for u i n 1 then i 0 so i 0 this gives the formula for p 2 p 1 1 and b is an immediate consequence for a we prove there is a sequence m m dn that converges to a n if t n then dn so a constant sequence suffices otherwise 0 0 since 0 1 n 1 there is a sequence m 0 1 n 1 that converges to now define 0 m m 1 and j m by 0 m j m j m for j 0 then m m dn and converges to when i 0 for i u then the coordinates of need not be monotonic this is where we exploit that there is no ordering requirement for the coordinates in dn for c let b a n be the space of fibers of p 1 equipped with quotient topology the map f b an induced by p 1 is a proper continuous bijection moreover an is compact and 14 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner hausdorff also b is locally compact because p 11 k is compact whenever k is compact hence f is a homeomorphism by lemma 3 1 remark 3 3 c is where 0 1 n 1 is compact is needed the reader might like to consider what b becomes if 0 1 n is replaced by 0 n in the definition of a n we now define another family of lie groups t that varies continuously with a n theorem 3 10 show that the families of lie groups t and tr are conjugate definition 3 4 for each a n dn define exp v aff n where v aff n is given by v 0 v 1 v 2 vn 1 0 0 1 v 1 0 0 v 1 n 1 vn 1 vn 1 0 0 v 0 1 n 1 0 0 0 0 0 and v v 1 vn 1 v and 0 n 1 and 1 n 1 also t im and t im if dn then is diagonalizable it follows if a n then is the limit of these diagonalizable representations by 3 2 a this fact is exploited to prove that t is a translation group the proof of the following is routine and in the appendix proposition 3 5 a given dn let i 2 i for 1 i n 1 and n 2 0 then there is q sl n 1 r and f gl v given by f v 1 vn 1 20 1 v 1 n 1 vn 1 such that q q 1 f and qt q 1 tr b t is a translation group that preserves a convex set rn and t 0 also where i 1 21 1 2 1 u 2 1 1 2 2 2 u u 1 u 2 1 2 u 0 0 ir v 1 vn 1 1 exp 0 v n 1 i 1 exp ivi define 1 2 1 n 1 then det n 1 and 1 is unimodular definition 3 6 if q i m gl k r and m 2 m then the preferred square root of q is s q i 1 1 1 m this is a square root since i xm 2 i 2 x x 2 m q when 2 x x 2 1 if v rk then m v v has rank 1 and the condition holds with v 2 moreover if q is symmetric and positive definite then so is s lemma 3 7 if s s i then s 1 v 0 v is an isometry where is defined in 3 5 moreover s 1 varies continuously with this gives a re parameterization of that make the horosphere metric standard definition 3 8 v aff n is given by s 1 where s s i gl v if t n then i 0 whenever i 6 0 so this re parameterization does not change the character however if t n the character of is more complicated fortunately we will not need an explicit formula for it in this case it follows from 3 7 that generalized cusps 15 corollary 3 9 the map a n hom v affn given by 7 is continuous the complete invariant of is given by v v v and if t n then v 1 vn 1 2 u n 1 i u 1 exp ivi the next result shows that the conjugacy classes of the family of groups tr coincides with the conjugacy classes of the groups t and that the conjugacy class of t only depends on changing but keeping fixed changes the conjugacy class of as detected by the horosphere metric without changing the conjugacy class of t theorem 3 10 given a n then t is conjugate to tr in aff n where is defined as follows set u u and t t when t 0 then 0 and define 0 when t n define as in 3 5 when 0 t n then t u n 1 and given 0 n 1 0 0 u 1 u t rn define 1 n 2 u 1 2 u t 0 0 r n proof when t n this follows 3 5 when t 0 then 0 0 0 and the result follows this leaves the case 1 t n define f c gl v by f v 1 vn 1 vu 1 vu t v 1 vu and c f diag c 1 cn 1 where the ci are determined below from 3 9 c v n 1 i 1 c 2 i v 2 i c v 2 u t i 1 exp u icivi 15 by 2 10 v t i 1 iv 2 i 1 t n 1 i t 1 v 2 i v 2 u t i 1 exp tvi we will now show how to choose c so that and c have the same complete invariant then they are conjugate by 2 15 the characters are equal if u ici t for i t now i 2 u i when i t thus ci t u i for i t hence c 2 i 2 t i then from 15 c v 2 t t i 1 iv 2 i n 1 i t 1 c 2 i v 2 i for i t define ci t then c v 2 t t i 1 iv 2 i n 1 i t 1 tv 2 i t i 1 iv 2 i 1 t n 1 i t 1 v 2 i v it is messy to directly construct a conjugating matrix since it varies continuously only when the type does not change in general the representations and are not conjugate if 6 because they have different complete invariants however corollary 3 11 if v aff n is a marked translation group then there are b c sl v and a n such that is equivalent to b and to c proof the first claim follows from 2 5 b and 3 10 and the second claim from this and 3 8 corollary 3 12 if s 0 and s a n then t t s are conjugate subgroups of aff n in particular if t n then t is conjugate to t 0 16 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner proof by 3 10 t and t are conjugate let f v v be f v sv by 3 4 s f and s now f s 2 thus s and f are marked translation groups with the same complete invariant thus they are conjugate by 2 15 the second statement follows because if t n then 0 0 so 0 a n it is interesting that in the non diagonalizable case we may choose 0 and then 0 has a simple form as given in 3 4 however the diagonalizable ones are more complicated 4 topology of the moduli space recall that repn is the space of conjugacy classes of holonomy representations of marked gen eralized torus cusps first we establish that repn is a quotient of a n sl v and that the complete invariant provides an embedding of repn we use this to prove that the holonomy map is a homeomorphism hol tn repn finally we compute the stratification of tn and prove 1 5 it follows from 2 5 and 3 10 that every marked translation group is conjugate to a for some a n and a sl v moreover if t n then it suffices to use 0 so 0 0 lemma 4 1 the map a n sl v repn given by b b is continuous and covers a continuous surjection an sl v repn proof continuity of follows from 3 9 to prove is well defined we must show that b is conjugate to b to do this it suffices to show they have the same complete invariant clearly it suffices to do this when b i this now follows from 3 9 recall p 1 a n an and we have p 1 if u repn is open then since is continuous 1 u p 11 1 u is open since p 1 is a quotient map by 3 2 c it follows that 1 u is open so is continuous in what follows use p in place of pp recall the compete invariant repn v p and the codomain is homeomorphic to a subspace of euclidean space in particular a closed subset of the codomain is locally compact lemma 4 2 an sl v v p is proper and continuous and xn repn is a closed subset of v p and is homeomorphic to a closed subset of euclidean space proof continuity of follows from 2 9 and 4 1 suppose aj j bj a n sl v and j j aj bj aj j bj is a bounded sequence in v p then j btjbj is bounded the map sl v slv given by b btb is proper thus bj is bounded after passing to a subsequence we may assume limbj b sl v by 3 8 aj j aj j s 1 j where j 0 1 n 1 so s j s i j j is bounded since the map that sends an element of sl v to its inverse is proper b 1 j is bounded thus b 1 j s j is bounded also j is bounded so j b 1 j s j trace aj j s 1 j bj b 1 j s j trace aj j is bounded let j be the last component of aj then j is the largest component of aj referring to 3 4 we see that aj j en 1 has an eigenvalue of exp j in the n n entry and all other eigenvalues equal to 1 since trace aj j is bounded and j 0 it follows that j is bounded thus aj is bounded hence is proper after taking a subsequence lim aj a and a an because an is a closed subset of rn thus lim aj bj a b an sl v and lim aj bj a b im thus im is closed in v p by 4 1 im repn thus im repn is closed generalized cusps 17 by 2 15 if b b sl v then b and b represent the same point in repn if and only if they have the same complete invariant by definition 2 8 this is equivalent to b b o let an sl v an sl v be projection where b b if and only if and b b o for some with a n it follows there is an injective function an sl v repn such that equip the domain with the quotient topology then is continuous by 4 1 surjectivity of follows from 2 5 and 3 10 theorem 1 1 follows from 4 4 and theorem 4 3 is a homeomorphism and repn xn is a homeomorphism and repn is homeomorphic to a closed subset of euclidean space proof by 4 2 an sl v xn is proper and continuous since xn is home omorphic to a closed subspace of euclidean space it is hausdorff and locally compact given x a an sl v there are compact neighborhoods l an of and k sl v of a then u l o n 1 k an sl v is compact because o n 1 is compact since o o n 1 it follows that u is a compact neighborhood of x thus an sl v is locally compact hence is an embedding by 3 1 it follows that is an embedding and is a homeomorphism the second conclusion follows from 4 2 in 2 5 generalized cusps were classified and shown to be equivalent to ones with holonomy in tr for some an recall that i 1 2 i when i 0 in 2 theorem 0 2 v gives a bijection that is essentially the same as but the topology on the domain is different it follows from the above that if the reciprocals of the coordinates of converge suitably then the conjugacy class of tr has a limit that is another translation group informally two generalized cusps are close if after shrinking them they are nearly affine isomor phic it turns out this is equivalent to their holonomies being close up to conjugacy our definition of marked moduli space is based on the notion of developing maps as is done in 9 sec 1 recall c v zn 1 0 so c v 0 is the universal cover let t n be the space of developing maps dev c an for marked generalized cusps with underlying space c we endow t n with the compact open topology there is an equivalence relation on t n that is generated by restricting to a smaller cusp homotopy and composition with an affine isomorphism the quotient space is tn when n 3 homotopy implies isotopy for homeomorphisms of tn however when n 5 there are infinitely many isotopy classes homotopic to the identity see 14 theorem 4 1 we have used homotopy rather than isotopy in the definition of tn in order to obtain the following theorem 4 4 the holonomy hol tn repn is a homeomorphism proof first we define hol suppose dev c an is the developing map of a generalized cusp then g zn 1 1 c acts on c v 0 by g v t v g t so the extended holonomy can be recovered from dev using that for x im dev g x dev g 0 dev 1 x it follows that there is a map h ol t n hom v aff n moreover this formula shows is determined by the restriction of dev to a compact set since t n has the compact open topology it follows that h ol is continuous it is clear that is the holonomy and is therefore well defined on the equivalence class dev tn thus h ol covers a continuous map hol tn repn next we construct an inverse to hol by 4 3 is a homeomorphism so we may replace repn by an sl v given b a n sl v define f f b v 0 rn 1 an by f v z bv z 0 0 1 a n 18 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner observe that f v 0 is the orbit of the origin so im f defined in 3 5 it follows that f is the developing map for a generalized cusp with holonomy b thus f t n define f a n sl v t n by f b f b clearly f is continuous by properties of the quotient topology f covers a continuous map f an sl v tn since hol has a continuous inverse f 1 it follows hol is a homeomorphism proof of 1 6 if c is a torus then c c and the result follows from 4 4 it only remains to prove that the holonomy of c uniquely determines the holonomy of c now c determines the extended holonomy v affn we claim determines the rotational part r 1 c o n and therefore determines 1 c an this follows from the observation that r is uniquely determined by the action of 1 c on v by conjugacy this in turn is determined by the action by conjugacy of 1 c on 1 c in the sequel we will use hol to identify these two spaces if dev is the developing map for a generalized cusp with holonomy then we identify dev tn with hol dev repn it follows from the above that theorem 4 5 hol 1 an sl v tn is a homeomorphism definition 4 6 given 0 t n the stratum of type t of tn is the subspace tn t tn that consists of all marked cusps with holonomy conjugate into some tr with t t the holonomy of a generalized cusp is conjugate to a where a an sl v the coordinates of are ordered below we show each stratum is a manifold by showing it is the quotient of a smooth manifold by a compact group that acts freely to do this involves enlarging the set of pairs a by relaxing the ordering and using aun the equivalence relation on aun sl v is then given by a free action of the t o u this technique can only be employed with individual strata but not all of tn since the dimension of o u changes with type we will see that tn is not a manifold with boundary when n 3 the proof of the next result actually determines the topology of each stratum proposition 4 7 for each 0 t n the stratum tn t tn is a connected smooth manifold without boundary and dim tn t dim tn t 1 moreover cl tn t i t tn i if n 3 then the fundamental group 1 tn n is not trivial proof let wt 0 t sl v by 2 5 there is a surjective map t wt tn t given by t a a where 1 t and 1 t 0 0 an the first case is t n so t u n 1 recall v d u from 2 where d rt 0 and u 0 ru let t o t be the subgroup that permutes the coordinates axes of rt and gt t o u sl v there is an action of gt on a wt given by a a where 0 0 b here we regard d and is the dual action the marked translation groups given by a and a are conjugate because they have the same complete invariant thus a a we claim that 1 a gt a suppose a a there is t so that the coordinates of are non increasing thus we may assume and both have this property by the classification 2 1 44 0 2 v it then follows that and a o u a the claim follows hence tn t is homeomorphic to wt gt moreover the subgroup o u acts trivially on the first factor of wt and by left multiplication on the second factor so tn t 0 t o u sl v t now o u sl v is a symmetric space since t is finite and acts freely it follows that tn t is a manifold generalized cusps 19 this leaves the case t n in which case u 0 let mono v aff n hom v aff n be the subspace of injective maps define f wn mono v aff n by f a a then f is injective and we use it to identify wn with z f wn let n aff n be the subgroup that permutes the standard basis of rn then n acts freely by conjugacy on mono v aff n claim this action preserves z we identify n with the group of permutations of 1 n suppose if n n then the action of on wn is as above in particular the subgroup n 1 n that fixes n preserves z let be the transposition n 1 n since n 1 and generate n it suffices to show that preserves z given 1 n 0 n then 1 b where b 1 1 1 1 n 2 n n 1 n n n 1 1 n 2 n n 1 let detb 1 n 1 then 1 b sl v and v v by 2 5 a thus b f 1 b z this proves the claim if two elements of z are conjugate then they are conjugate by an element of n this is because both representations are diagonal so a conjugacy must preserve the coordinate axes thus the conjugacy is by a signed permutation matrix however a signed permutation matrix is the product of a permutation matrix and a diagonal matrix with 1 on the diagonal but diagonal matrices centralize these representations so they are conjugate via a coordinate permutation hence tn n z n now wn has two components and these are swapped by every odd element of n thus tn n 0 n slv alt where alt n is the alternating subgroup in particular 1 tn n surjects to alt and alt is non trivial if n 3 the last claim in the theorem follows moreover cl tn t i t tn i follows from the corresponding fact for the weyl chamber an finally dim tt dimwt dimgt t dim slv dim o u and dimv n 1 proof of 1 5 there is a deformation retraction tn tn 0 given by scaling and t 0 p is homeomorphic to euclidean space of dimension n n 1 2 thus tn is contractible in 2 prop 6 2 t 2 was parameterized as x y r 2 0 x y and is thus a manifold with boundary suppose tn is a manifold m with boundary and n 3 let n tn be the subspace of non diagonalizable generalized cusps we claim that m n since y tn n is the stratum of diagonalizable generalized cusps it follow from 4 7 that y is a manifold without boundary and dimy dim tn so m y thus m n if an and t n 1 then has exactly one zero coordinate let z n be the subset of with a with t n 1 and all the coordinates of are distinct then no element of n 1 fixes because if n 1 and then i it follows a neighborhood of in m is homeomorphic to a neighborhood u of a point in an sl v that projects to u but is in the boundary of an sl v so is in the boundary of the quotient thus z m but z is dense in n and m is closed in m so n m this proves the claim since m is contractible 1 m 0 also 1 m 1 y because a manifold and its interior have the same fundamental group by 4 7 1 y 6 1 when n 3 this contradicts that tn is a manifold 5 the weights data in this section we prove 1 2 there is an action of a glv on repn given by a a 1 if 1 n then 16 a 1 1 a 1 n a 1 a 1 20 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner this restricts to an action on im that covers a transitive action on p lemma 5 1 if a with a sl v then 0 n 1 where i j 2 i ij i j ij and 1 2 1 n 1 and 20 2 n proof let and is the inner product on v corresponding to s 2 v and the associated norm let be the standard norm on v for which the standard basis is orthonormal and the associated inner product we may assume then the matrix of in the standard basis is given q 1 i the matrix of the dual form on v with respect to the dual basis is then q 1 from 3 4 the lie algebra weights for are 0 n 1 v where 17 0 v 0 v i ie i for 1 i n 1 for the following refer to the discussion after 3 6 now q 1 i m where m then m 2 2 m so q 1 i m 1 i 1 2 1 m if 1 i j n 1 then 18 i j ie i je j i j ij 1 2 1 i j i j ij now i i 0 so 20 1 2 1 20 1 n we claim 18 holds in all cases 0 i j n 1 if 0 0 then 0 0 and 18 holds in all cases otherwise 0 0 and using i i 0 then 17 implies 19 0 20 n 1 i 1 2 i i so n 1 i 0 2 i i 0 to compute 0 j replace 0 by the above and then use 18 in the case i j 1 already established some algebra then shows 18 holds in all cases the lemma implies the inner product of distinct weights is always this has a geometric interpretation consider a set of n vectors v 1 vn in v rn 1 equipped with the standard inner product such that for some 0 the vectors satisfy the equation 20 i 6 j vi vj if 0 this just says the vectors are pairwise orthogonal and for dimension reasons at least one is zero if 0 then set rn v ren with the standard inner product the equations 20 are equivalent to the pairwise orthogonality of the vectors ui vi en in rn in this case the ui are an orthogonal basis of rn that represent points in the hyperplane xn and the vi are the images of these vectors under orthogonal projection into v proof of theorem 1 2 we will abuse notation by identifying tn repn and write instead of for a point in repn suppose 0 n 1 then v r is given by v n i 1 exp iv thus the complete invariant is a continuous function of by 2 15 is injective hence is injective recall rn spn v p is the subset of all 0 n 1 such that 21 0 i 6 j i j we must show that im rn by 5 1 im rn it remains show that rn im in what follows we will always choose an ordering for x 0 n 1 rn so that i is a non decreasing function of i define k by i 6 0 if and only if i k and define 0 1 case 1 0 then 21 is equivalent to requiring the i are pairwise orthogonal with respect to since dimv n 1 it follows that 0 0 define 22 i i 0 0 generalized cusps 21 then 0 0 observe these values are consistent with 5 1 from 3 4 the weight data is 23 0 0 0 ke k n 1 e n 1 0 0 x x 2 now 0 ie i 2 i i then ie i are obviously pairwise 0 orthogonal and i are pairwise orthogonal since 0 thus there is an isometry a v v 0 with ie i a 1 a ie i i 0 a 1 then x im because applying 16 to 23 gives 0 a 1 0 n 1 x case 2 0 identify v with the subspace of rn where xn 0 and extend to rn so that en 1 and en is orthogonal to v let l v v be the natural isometry given by l v w v w and let ri l 1 i be the vectors dual to the weights then 21 is equivalent to the pairwise orthogonality of the vectors ui ri en 0 i n 1 rn since ui 0 this is a basis of rn moreover en ui writing en in terms of this orthogonal basis en n 1 i 0 iui with i ui 2 0 thus iri 0 and i l ri so i i 0 set i 2 i and i 0 i then 2 i i 0 define 0 n 1 then 2 i i 0 by 19 and by 18 i j 2 i ij now i ie i for i 0 so in particular i 1 i n 1 is a basis of v there is a unique a glv such that a i i for i 1 since 0 20 n 1 i 1 2 i i and 0 2 0 n 1 i 1 2 i i it follows that a 0 0 now i j 2 i ij i j and it follows that a is an isometry between the metrics and on v thus is surjective we have shown that is a bijection let 1 rn xn by 4 3 is a homeomorphism so is a bijection above we showed that is a continuous function of and it follows that is continuous we claim is proper suppose m xm m is unbounded and suppose for contradiction that m m m m is bounded then there is a component m i v of xm m 0 m n 1 spn v that is unbounded thus m i exp m i is unbounded a contradiction this proves the claim by 4 2 xn is locally compact and rn is a closed subset of euclidean space and thus locally compact by 3 1 is a homeomorphism since is a homeorphism it follows that 1 is a homeomorphism 6 cubic differentials in this section we will show that when n 3 a generalized cusp c tn 1 0 is uniquely determined up to equivalence by the projective class j called the shape invariant of a certain polynomial j q c where q c rn 1 r are homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 and 3 respectively one may regard q as a similarity structure euclidean structure up to scaling on tn 1 and c as a cubic differential on tn 1 when n 2 then the shape invariant does not determine the cusp but the moduli space is described in 2 section 6 definition 6 1 a calibrated vector space is a pair v where v is a vector space and v r is a function called the calibration a linear isomorphism f v v is an isometry between the calibrated vector spaces v and v if f the group of self isometries of v is written o two calibrations are similar if there is 0 with and this is written 22 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner a calibration can be viewed as an interesting generalization of a norm for example there is a calibrated vector space r 248 with an octic polynomial such that the compact form of the exceptional lie group e 8 is the identity component of o see 12 where they use the term stabilize instead of isometry we follow 1 in using the term isometry definition 6 2 a cusp space is a calibrated vector space v that is similar to some rn 1 where rn 1 r is given by v 1 vn 1 v v v 2 1 3 0 v 3 n 1 i 1 iv 3 i and a n and is the standard inner product on rn 1 in the non diagonalizable case when 0 this simplifies to 0 v v 13 n 1 i 1 iv 3 i definition 6 3 the space of cusp space structures on the vector space v is j v v is a cusp space p s 2 v s 3 v equipped with the subspace topology and jn j rn 1 if f rn r is a smooth function the k jet is the polynomial given by the truncated taylor expansion of f around 0 consisting of all terms of total degree at most k definition 6 4 suppose t is a translation group and w is a real vector space and w t is an isomorphism the shape invariant for is j where h is a height function for t and j j is the 3 jet of h at 0 and j p s 2 w s 3 w the height function h is unique up to multiplication by a positive real thus the projective class j of j is well defined moreover the terms of degree 0 and 1 in j vanish so j q c with q s 2 w and c s 3 w when w v then det q is defined using the standard basis of v and q is unimodular where det q 1 dimv we use the map f j v p s 3 v given by f q c q c to identify j v with a subspace of p s 3 v it is easy to check that if b aff n then j b b 1 j and that if a glv then j a j a consider the diagonal translation subgroup g tr where n i 1 ie i with all i 0 as in 2 4 let d n gl n 1 r be the subgroup of positive diagonal matrices with 1 in the bottom right corner then g is a codimension 1 subgroup of d n to compute the calibration for we avoid choosing a basis of the lie algebra g of g but instead work with the natural basis of d n let a rn be the r algebra with addition and multiplication defined componentwise so a 1 an b 1 bn a 1 b 1 anbn this multiplication is called the hadamard product observe that p 1 1 is the multiplicative identity in a and for n 0 then an a is the element obtained by raising each component of a to power n let a a be the subset with all coordinates strictly positive made into a group using hadamard multiplication the map a gl n 1 r given by x 1 xn 7 diag x 1 xn 0 is used to identify the lie algebra a with zero lie bracket to the lie algebra of d n and the group homomorphism a gl n 1 r given by x 1 xn diag x 1 xn 1 identifies a with hadamard multiplication to d n regarding a as the lie algebra of a then exp a a is coordinate wise exponentiation define an inner product on a by x y xy n i 1 ixiyi then xy z x yz so x y p xy and g ker p x a p x 0 may be regarded as the lie algebra of tr generalized cusps 23 lemma 6 5 if t n then exp g tr is a marked translation group and the shape invariant is j exp j where j x 1 2 p x 2 1 6 p x 3 proof since g ker exp g diag exp x 1 exp xn 1 ixi 0 tr let rn be the orbit of p under tr then the tangent space to at p is p we use the height function h h exp g rn where h y y p then h x p exp x p i 0 1 n p xn the terms of degree 0 and 1 vanish because p x 0 p and p x 0 since x p the proof of the following is in the appendix proposition 6 6 if an then j j v moreover in the diagonalizable case 0 0 and v j is similar to g j where is determined in the proof the following lemma shows how determines the calibration the cubic term c in the 3 jet j q c is a weighted sum of the cubes of the weights i see 37 below later we will see that one can recover these weights from j see 22 and theorem 1 4 in 23 for a uniqueness statement concerning the expression of a cubic as a sum of cubes the proof of the following is in the appendix lemma 6 7 if n 3 then there is a map k rn p s 3 v such that k j and k is continuous and proper if is a marked translation group and x 0 n 1 rn then k x c with c 1 3 n 1 i 0 3 i i i 1 1 2 corollary 6 8 j tn p s 3 v is continuous and proper proof by 4 4 hol 1 repn tn is a homeomorphism and by 6 7 k rn p s 3 v is continuous and proper and repn rn is homeomorphism by 1 2 thus j k hol 1 is continuous and proper it remains to show that the shape invariant j q c determines a unique generalized cusp the method used is to show that the local maxima of the cubic c restricted to the unit sphere of the quadratic q enable one to determine this follows from lemmas 6 9 for the diagonalizable case and 6 10 in the non diagonalizable case the proofs are in the appendix lemma 6 9 diagonalizable case assume n 3 given an let rn j q c be the calibrated vector space with j x 1 2 p x 2 1 6 p x 3 let g x rn p x 0 and s v g v v 1 and s i for 1 i n define vi sei ip sei ip then k x s c s has a local maximum at x vi 1 i n moreover i 6 j ij vi vj 0 if 1 i j k n and i j k are pairwise distinct then i s ij ik ij ik jk 6 c vi 1 i 1 2 i s 1 i s also k n 1 where k v k c v 0 for the corresponding result in the non diagonalizable case it is more convenient to work with 0 instead of since the calibration is j v 2 1 3 iv 3 i 24 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner lemma 6 10 non diagonalizable case given 0 1 n 1 an let j v v 2 c v where c 1 3 iv 3 i and s v v v 2 i 1 then j 0 0 j v and k v s c s has a local max at v and c v 0 ei i 0 moreover c ei i 3 for ei k and if a 6 b k then a b 0 and k t 1 n 1 the subgroup o b g that stabilizes b is conjugate to the subgroup o glv that preserves v by 2 13 the following shows that the latter is the same as the subgroup that preserves j these results are keys steps in showing and j are powerful invariants lemma 6 11 if v t is a marked translation group then o j o proof this is easy when t 0 since the generalized cusp is standard and the cubic term in j is 0 thus we may assume t 0 and then by 2 13 o glv is conjugate to the stabilizer of the basepoint in pgl since j is preserved by the latter o o j to show the reverse inclusion by 2 5 every marked translation group is given by b a b 1 for some a sl v and b aff n now o j and o are both unchanged under conjugation by b moreover j a j a and a a thus is suffices to prove the result for suppose j q c where q is the horosphere metric on v given by and o q gl v is the subgroup that preserves q set t t let w i v 1 i t be the set of non zero lie algebra weights for then o is the subgroup of o q that preserves the character and o j is the subgroup of sim q that preserves the cubic c arguing as in 2 13 o j o q since t 0 the result will follow by showing that preserving is equivalent to preserving w is equivalent to preserving c by 2 12 preserving is equivalent to preserving the characteristic polynomial g c let w w be the multiset of all lie algebra weights of the linear part of then w n and w contains the zero weight with multiplicity n t the coefficients of g are the elementary symmetric functions of the elements of w thus preserving g is equivalent to preserving w by 37 c 1 3 2 i 3 i thus if w is preserved then c is preserved for the converse suppose c is preserved when t n then by 6 10 o j preserves k ei i 0 and since c ei i 3 it follows that o j preserves s iei 1 i n it follows that w is preserved in this case this leaves the case t n by 6 9 o j preserves k and therefore permutes the coordinates of moreover the formula for c vi in 6 9 shows that c vi c vj if and only if i j comparing this to 3 5 one sees that the weights are preserved thus o j preserves w we now have the ingredients to show that j determines lemma 6 12 if n 3 and a a sl v and j a j a then proof in what follows we scale j q c so that q is unimodular and talk about this calibration instead of its projective class let s v v q v 1 and k s the set of points at which c s has a local maximum and let k k be the subset where c 0 observe that k is an invariant of the similarity class of a cusp space let q be the inner product on v determined by q then the set a b q a b k is also an invariant of the similarity class by 6 6 the calibration on a marked translation group is similar to some and in the diagonalizable case also to some j first suppose k 2 and choose two distinct elements a b k case 1 a b q 0 then 6 9 implies that t n and 6 10 implies the coordinates of are given by c v as v ranges over k moroever i 1 2 i so is determined by j in this case case 2 a b q 6 0 then 6 10 implies t n so v j a is similar to g j it follows from 6 9 that j determines determines up to multiplication by a positive scalar thus we may assume s with s 0 by 2 5 a s s ir iu if j a j a it follows that j j b where b s ir iu a a 1 thus b o j generalized cusps 25 so detb 1 since deta deta 1 it follows that det s ir iu sr 1 thus s 1 so case 3 k 1 if t n then k n 1 by 6 9 since n 3 it follows that t n which contradicts t n the result now follows from 6 10 as before lemma 6 13 suppose v aff n are marked translation groups and n 3 if j j then and are conjugate proof we may assume f and f with f f sl v it follows from 6 12 that then j j implies f 1 f o j thus f 1 f o by 6 11 hence and have the same complete invariant and so are conjugate by 2 15 theorem 6 14 suppose n 3 let tn be the space of marked generalized cusps homeomorphic to tn 1 0 the map j tn jn is a homeomorphism moreover k rn jn is a homeomorphism proof by 6 13 j is injective by 6 8 j is continuous and proper the image of j is contained in jn by 6 6 and surjectivity follows from the proof of 6 6 moreover jn is a subspace of euclidian space and is therefore locally compact and hausdorff also tn is locally compact by 4 3 so j is a homeomorphism by 3 1 now j k and is a homeomorphism by 1 2 thus k is a homeomorphism 6 1 the affine normal a reference for this is chapter 1 of 20 see also 19 and 16 lemma 4 1 suppose s rn is a smooth strictly convex hypersurface and p is a point in s then the tangent hyperplane to s at p intersects s only at p and s lies on one side of p an affine normal to s at p is vector 0 6 p rn with the following property given 0 let p be the hyperplane parallel to p on the side of p that contains s and distance from p let x be the center of mass of s p then x p converges to a non zero multiple of we also require that points to the convex side of s then is defined up to positive scalar multiples it follows from this that affine normals are preserved by affine maps if a is an affine map of rn then a p is an affine normal to a s since affine maps are not conformal the affine normal is not in general orthogonal to s at p a convex hypersurface in rn is an affine sphere if there is a point b rpn such that every affine normal passes through b there is a decomposition s 3 rn hn rn into the harmonic cubics hn and the radial cubics rn given by hn p s 3 rn p 0 rn x 2 v x v rn the group o n acts on s 3 rn preserving this decomposition and by 24 theorem 0 3 the action on each summand is irreducible the material from here to 6 17 is not used in this paper so we have omitted the proofs it is included to avert a possible misperception the map s 3 rn rn given by p 2 n 4 1 p is projection onto rn followed by the map x 2 v x 7 v more generally if is a positive definite quadratic form on rn then there is an isometry l gl n r from 2 to hence l hn and l rn are preserved by o and l l 1 s 3 rn rn the following says that the affine normal is the radial part of the cubic term in a taylor expansion proposition 6 15 suppose u rn is a neighborhood of 0 and f u r is c 3 let s rn 1 be the graph of f and suppose f x x c x o x 3 and s 2 rn is positive definite and c s 3 rn then an affine normal to s at 0 is en 1 2 n 1 c this can be deduced from formula 3 4 on page 48 of 20 this formula goes back at least to 1923 see blaschke 4 recall that the radial flow r affn for a generalized cusp lie group g centralizes it and t whenever t 0 see 2 1 11 if the radial flow is t x x te 1 if t n and otherwise t n and t x e t x c c where c rn is the center of refer to 4 26 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner for the definition of and hb in the following now we may assume that in 3 5 and b 0 and hb is x 1 0 then x 1 xn x 1 for some 0 it is more convenient in the following to redefine the radial flow when t n to be 1 affn given by t x t 1 1 x c c then 0 is always the identity and i r or 1 is the domain of as appropriate then f v i rn are coordinates on a subset of rn that contains in these coordinates the height function h describes an open subset of hb as a graph over rather than vice versa as one might na ively imagine lemma 6 16 scale so that if t n then x 1 xn x 1 and if t n then c 1 then f v 0 and f v t t h v hb if j c then 6 15 implies that and the radial cubic part of c determines the affine normal to f 1 hb proposition 6 17 let be the standard inner product on v and let v t be a marked translation group and s a horosphere for t and with radial flow and j c with unimodular the following are equivalent a flow lines of are affine normals to s b s is an affine sphere c c is harmonic with respect to i e c 0 d t is conjugate to tr s s with s 0 proof flow lines of limit on the center of the radial flow so a b for the converse assume s is an affine sphere with center w rpn then t fixes w if the affine normals to s are parallel then s is an elliptic paraboloid 5 21 in this case t is conjugate to tr 0 0 and w is the center of otherwise w rn thus t is diagonalizable we may assume t tr with all the coordinates of 0 and w 0 again w is the center of thus b a in this case we claim s s this is because s is an affine sphere asymptotic to the sides of a simplex and by 7 it follows that s is unique up to affine maps preserving the simplex thus b d for d b when s 0 then s is an elliptic paraboloid and when s 0 then s is defined by xi 1 these are well known affine spheres it remains to show c d using 6 2 we may assume j c v v 2 v 2 3 c v 0 v 3 n 1 i 1 iv 3 i if 0 0 we may choose 0 then c is harmonic with respect to v v 2 if and only if 0 showing c d in this case otherwise 0 0 first we perform a linear change of coordinates on v so that v v 2 let t gl v be defined by t v v v where 2 1 1 2 1 2 then tv v 2 now we compute the cubic c t using the hadamard product on v and i i 0 3 10 c t v tv 3 1 tv 3 v 3 3 v v 2 1 v 3 where 1 2 3 3 2 3 2 2 2 2 1 2 4 1 2 set m dimv then 3 10 2 c t 6 2 3 2 m 4 v 6 1 v 6 u v where u m 2 2 m 2 1 2 1 generalized cusps 27 then c t is harmonic with respect to 2 if and only if u 0 since u is a linear combination of and 1 it follows that s 1 1 for some s 0 1 then 2 ms 2 and u 0 implies s 2 m s 2 1 ms 2 1 ms 2 s s 1 this implies s 2 1 0 hence s 1 and c d when 0 0 7 three dimensions in dimension 3 every generalized cusp is equivalent to for some lattice in t and is the orbit of 0 under t from the proof of 3 5 one sees that in dimension 3 that is the graph graph y f x 1 x 2 in r 3 shown below where for t 3 we have chosen

subspace 0 0 and is also continuous when 1 2 0 are constant as 0 0 but is not continuous in general this family of surfaces only varies continuously with subject to these constraints using the horosphere metric we may identify a lie algebra weight in v with a vector in v then a generalized cusp in a 3 manifold is specified by a parallelogram of area one in v r 2 together with three vectors a b c in v satisfying a b b c c a 0 the lie algebra weights of the holonomy are given by x v x where v a b c two such collection of data define equivalent cusps if and only if there is an isometry of r 2 taking one parallelogram to the other and that permutes the set of vectors a b c the type of the generalized cusp is the number of these vectors that are non zero figure 1 generalized cusps in dimension 3 there is a decomposition of s 3 r 2 h 2 r 2 is given by h 2 x x 2 3 y 2 y y 2 3 x 2 r 2 x x 2 y 2 y x 2 y 2 with coordinate projections h and r by 6 17 the cubic is harmonic with respect to if and only if the holonomy is conjugate into tr s s s for some s 0 28 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner regarding v r 2 c via z x iy and recalling that the real part of a holomorphic function is harmonic it follows that h 2 re hz 3 h c r 2 re rz z 2 r c this gives an isomorphism of real vector spaces c 2 s 3 r 2 given by h r re hz 3 rz z 2 the action of so 2 u 1 c 1 on s 3 r 2 is then h r 3 h r the standard euclidean structure on c 2 gives an inner product on s 3 r 2 given by h r 2 h 2 r 2 and so 2 acts by isometries let 0 be the quadratic form x 2 y 2 on r 2

the diagonalizable case by 3 5 is conjugate to f where n 20 and i 2 i for 1 i n 1 this defines a linear map a r and we have g ker since j is an invariant of conjugacy classes we may replace by f in

formula holds for a every marked translation group is conjugate to such and both sides are conjugacy invariants so the formula holds in general the formula shows k is continuous it only remains to show k is proper suppose j m is a bounded sequence then we must show m 1 m n m m is bounded now m and c m are both bounded so it only remains to prove the weights i m are bounded suppose for a contradiction that some i m is unbounded we show that this implies c m is not bounded which gives a contradiction we may assume m m m bm with bm sl v the matrix of m in the standard basis of v is btmbm since this is bounded bm is bounded and we may subsequence so bm converges to b sl v it follows that the weights of m m are unbounded hence m m 0 m n 1 is unbounded and therefore m n 1 the
