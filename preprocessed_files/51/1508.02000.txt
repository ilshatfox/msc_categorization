transitive and the pair consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is a matroid 2 line spaces the concept of a line space is defined by some of the axioms in 7 1 it is proved that from each line space there is an isomoprhism onto a set represented line space that leaves all points fixed let x be a left vector space over a division ring s for example s r and x rn for an n z 1 let y be the set of translated 1 dimensional subspaces of x and set membership a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 3 i e the relation between x and y defined by a y a y the pair y satisfies the following conditions for a b x if a 6 b then there is exactly one y y such that a y b y this y is denoted by ab for y y there are two different a b x such that a y b y a line structure on a set x is a pair y such that y is a set is a binary relation between x and y i e a subset of x y and these conditions are satisfied a line space is a triple x y such that x is a set and y is a line structure on x the elements of x are referred to as points the elements of y are referred to as lines a point x is said to be on a line y iff x y let x be a left vector space the line structure on x defined above is called the affine line structure on x the line space consisting of x and the affine line structure on x is called the affine line space on x in 6 chapter 1 section 3 a line space is called a linear space here the term line space is used because the term linear space is sometimes still in use as a synonym for the term vector space let x y be a line space for a b c d x if a 6 b c 6 d and c d ab then cd ab a line structure y on a set x and the line space x y are called set represented iff y is a set of subsets of x and is set membership thus a set represented line structure on x is a pair y such that y p x the power set of x is set membership as usual and the following conditions are satisfied for a b x if a 6 b then there is exactly one y y such that a b y for y y there are two different a b y the affine line space on a left vector space is set represented a strong homomorphism between structures x 1 y 1 1 x 2 y 2 2 each consisting of two sets and a binary relation between them is a pair f g of maps f x 1 x 2 g y 1 y 2 such that for all a x 1 y y 1 f a 2 g y iff a 1 y f g is called an isomorphism iff f and g are bijections two such structures are called iso morphic iff there is an isomorphism between them in this case if one of them is a line space then so is the other one the following proposition shows that each line space is isomorphic to a set represented line space with the same set of points proposition 2 1 set representation of line spaces let x y be a line space and l y p x the map defined by l y a x a y 4 wolfram retter i e for a line y l y is the set of points on y then 1 x l is an isomorphism from x y onto x l y where denotes set membership as usual and x l y is a set represented line space proof from the assumption that x y is a line space it follows that it suffices to prove that 1 x l is an isomorphism from x y onto x l y the map l is defined in such a way that 1 x l is a stong homomorphism from x y into x p x i e for a x y y 1 x a l y iff a y furthermore 1 x is a bijection from x onto x and l is a map from x onto l x thus to prove that 1 x l is an isomorphism it suffices to prove that l is injective for y z y it is to be proved that l y l z implies y z there are a b x such that a 6 b a y and b y i e a b l y with the assumption l y l z it follows that a b l z i e a z and b z with a 6 b a y and b y it follows that z y in view of 2 1 set representation of line spaces the abstract theory of line spaces can be restricted to set represented line spaces the more general concept is in use for several reasons some line spaces are in their most convenient defintion not set represented for example the the projective line space over a left vector space as defined below is not set represented also the concept of a line space is a particular case of a concept from general incidence geometry as in 6 chapter 1 section 3 3 join spaces the concept of a projective join space is built incrementally via the concept of an equivalence relational join space then all axioms defining this concept are listed with their numbering in 2 1 and in 10 chapter ii sect 4 where a translation of the axioms into english has been given finally a one to one correspondence between line spaces and equivalence relational join spaces is presented projective line spaces correspond to projective join spaces let x be a left vector space over a division ring s for example s r and x rn for an n z 1 let be the ternary relation on x defined by x y z there is a s such that y x z x x together with this ternary relation satisfies the following conditions for a x the binary relation a is reflexive on x for b x the binary relation b is symmetric for x y x x y x implies y x a join relation on a set x is a ternary relation on x such that these conditions are satisfied a join space is a pair consisting of a set x and a join relation on x let x be a left vector space the join relation on x defined above is called the affine join relation on x the join space consisting of x and the affine join relation on x is called the affine join space on x let x be join space the ternary relation is determined by the family of sets ac a c x defined by ac a c x x a x c a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 5 the set ac is called the join of a and c the above set of conditons defining the concepts of a join relation and a join space is equivalent to the following set of conditions for a c x if a 6 c then a ac for a c x if a 6 c then ac ca for a x aa a a join space x is also simply denoted by x when it is clear from the context whether the join space or only the set is meant in 8 chapter i 7 6 the term join space is used only for a particular case here the terms join and join space replace the terms interval and interval space in 9 chapter i 2 2 4 and 5 because the terms interval and interval space suggest a a narrower class of join spaces for which the following example is typical let x be a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring s for example s r and x rn for an n z 1 the ternary relation on x defined by x y z there is a s such that 0 1 and y x z x is a join relation on x it is called the line segment join relation on x the join space consisting of x and the line segment join relation on x is called the line segment join space on x in 8 chapter i 4 1 the term interval space has been used even in a wider sense than in 9 chapter i 2 2 4 and 5 let x be a join space for a b c x a b c a 6 b a 6 c for a b c x a b c there are a a b b c c such that a b c in this notation when a b or c is a singleton x it may be replaced by x for a c x the join of a and c is the set ac x x a x c in this notation when a or c is a singleton x it may be replaced by x part 1 of the following proposition is cited from 3 theorem 2 3 parts 3 and 4 are cited from 3 theorem 2 1 proposition 3 1 set join operator let x be a join space 1 for a b x ab ba 2 for a b x if b 6 then a ab 3 for a b c x a b ac b c 4 for a b c x a b c a c b 5 for a b c d x a b and c d ac bd proof 1 3 theorem 2 3 6 wolfram retter 2 the assumption b 6 says that there is a b b for each a a a ab substituting b b a ab 3 3 theorem 2 1 4 3 theorem 2 1 5 follows from 4 and 5 let x be a join space and a x the binary relation a is reflexive on x the following definitions of transitivity and symmetry with respect to a can be summarized as follows for a property p of a binary relation x is said to have property p with respect to a iff the binary relation a restricted to x a has property p x and are called transitive with respect to a or a transitive iff the following equivalent conditions are satisfied the binary relation a is transitive on x a for all b c x if a b c and b c a then ab ac for all b c x if a b c and b a then ab ac for all b c x if a b c then ab ac the binary relation a is transitive on x the affine join space on a left vector space is transitive with respect to each subset the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is transitive with respect to each subset x and are called symmetric with respect to a or a symmetric iff the follow ing equivalent conditions are satisfied the binary relation a is symmetric on x a for all b c x c ab and c a implies b ac the affine join space on a left vector space is symmetric with respect to each subset the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is in general not symmetric with respect to a subset when x is a symmetric in general the binary relation a won t be symmetric on all of x this situation is different from the case that x is a transitive where the binary relation a is transitive on all of x x and are called equivalence relational with respect to a or a equivalence relational iff the following equivalent conditions are satisfiesd the restriciton of the binary relation a to x a is an equivalence relation x is a transitive and a symmetric the affine join space on a left vector space is equivalence relational with respect to each subset the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is in general not equivalence relational with respect to a subset in the definitions of transitivity symmetry and euqivalence relationality with respect to a when a is a singleton a it may be replaced by a thus x is a transitive a symmetric a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 7 a equivalence relational iff it is a transitive a symmetric a equivalence relational re

x y x x ay and y ab x ab for all x y a a x y and a y b a x b x is a transitive let x be a join space a triple a b c of subsets of x is called dependent iff a b 6 or ab c 6 in this definition when a b or c is a singleton x it may be replaced by x for example a triple a b c of elements of x is dependent iff b a or c ab a quadruple a b c d of subsets of x is called dependent iff the following equivalent conditions are satisfied a b c is dependent or ab c d 6 a b 6 or ab c 6 or ab c d 6 in this definition when a b c or d is a singleton x it may be replaced by x for example a quadruple a b c d of elements of x is dependent iff b a or c ab or d ab c each of the following two figures illustrates the case d ab c a b d c a b c d for the next proposition each of the following two figures illustrates condition 1 a b d c a b c d proposition 3 3 rejoinability criterion let x be a join space for a b c d x if x is a equivalence relational and b symmetric then the following conditions are equivalent 1 if d a bc then d ab c 8 wolfram retter 2 if c b a d is dependent then a b c d is dependent proof the assumption that x is a equivalence relational entails that x is a transitive and a symmetric step 1 1 2 2 says if b c or a bc or d a bc then b a or c ab or d ab c from 1 it follows that it suffices to prove that b c or a bc implies b a or c ab case 1 1 b c substituting into b ab c ab case 1 2 a bc i e b a c it is to be proved that b 6 a implies c ab i e b c a this claim follows from the assumptions that b a c b 6 a and x is b symmetric step 2 2 1 2 says if b c or a bc or d a bc then b a or c ab or d ab c with the assumption d a bc it follows that b a or c ab or d ab c case 2 1 b a it follows from this assumption from the assumption that x is a transitive by 3 2 transitivity relative to a set and from a ab by 3 1 3 set join operator a bc a ac ac ab c with the assumption that d a bc it follows that d ab c case 2 2 c ab i e b c a from this assumption and the assumption that x is b transitive it follows that bc ba it follows by 3 1 4 set join operator with the assumption that x is a transitive by 3 2 transitivity relative to a set and by 3 1 2 set join operator a bc a ba a ab ab ab c with the assumption that d a bc it follows that d ab c case 2 3 d ab c for this case nothing is to be proved proposition 3 4 join spaces symmetric with respect to a base set let x be a join space for a b c x if x is a symmetric c 6 and a b c is dependent then a c b is dependent proof the assumption that a b c is dependent says that a b 6 or ab c 6 it is to be proved that a c 6 or ac b 6 case 1 a b 6 from the assumption that c 6 it follows by 3 1 2 set join operator that a ac therefore a b ac b with the assumption that a b 6 it follows that ac b 6 case 2 ab c 6 i e there are b b c

2 c a with the assumption c c c a c consequently a c 6 a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 9 for the next proposition each of the following two figures illustrates the case d ab c of condition 1 the case ab cd 6 of condition 2 a b d c a b c d proposition 3 5 quadruple dependence criterion let x be a join space for a b c d x if x is c symmetric then the following conditions are equivalent 1 a b c d is dependent 2 a b or c d or ab cd 6 proof from the assumption that x is c symmetric it follows by 3 4 join spaces symmetric with respect to a base set that the following conditions are equivalent a b c d is dependent a b or c ab or d ab c a b or c ab 6 or d ab c a b or c ab d is dependent a b or c d ab is dependent a b or c d or ab cd 6 proposition 3 6 base point equivalence relationality criterion let x be a join space for a x the following conditions are equivalent 1 x is a equivalence relational 2 for all b c x a b c and a 6 b imply ab ac and a c b 3 for all b c x a b c and a 6 b imply ab ac proof step 1 1 2 1 says that x is a transitive and a symmetric this condition is equivalent to 2 step 2 2 3 it remains to be proved that a b c and a 6 b imply ac ab from the assumptions a b c a 6 b and 2 it follows that a c b and a 6 c with 2 again ac ab step 3 3 2 it remains to be proved that a b c and a 6 b imply a c b with 3 ab ac substituting into c ac c ab i e a c b let x be a join space for a x the binary relation a is reflexive on x the following definitions of transi tivity and symmetry can be summarized as follows for a property p of a binary relation x is 10 wolfram retter said to have property p iff for all a x the binary relation a restricted to x a has property p x and are called transitive iff the following equivalent conditions are satis fied where the last condition is equivalent to the others by 3 2 transitivity relative to a set for each a x x is a transitive for all b c x if a b c a 6 b and a 6 c then ab ac for all a b c x if a b c and a 6 b then ab ac for all a b c x if a b c then ab ac for each a x the binary relation a is transitive on x for all a b x a ab ab the affine join space on a left vector space is transitive the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is transitive x and are called symmetric iff the following equivalent conditions are sat isfied for each a x x is a symmetric for all a b c x a b c and a 6 b implies a c b for each a x x is a symmetric the affine join space on a left vector space is symmetric the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is in general not symmetric when x is symmetric in general the binary relations a won t be symmetric on all of x this situation is different from the case that x is transitive where the binary relations a are transitive on all of x on the other hand when x is transitive in general it won t be a transitive for all a x this situation is different from the case that x is symmetric where x is a symmetric for all a x x and are called equivalence relational iff the following equivalent condi tions are satisfied for each a x x is a equivalence relational x is transitive and symmetric the affine join space on a left vector space is equivalence relational the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is in general not equivalence relational proposition 3 7 join space associated with a line space let x y be a line space then the ternary relation on x defined by a b c a 6 c and b ac or a c and b a is an equivalence relational join relation on x proof step 1 proof that is a join relation on x step 1 1 for a c x if a 6 c then c ac i e a c c and ac ca therefore for b x a b c implies c b a and for a b x if a b a then b a i e b a consequently is a join relation on x step 2 proof that is equivalence relational i e for a x is a equivalence relational a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 11 step 2 1 proof that is a symmetric i e for y z x a a y z implies a z y i e for y z x from y 6 a z 6 a and y az it follows that z ay from a az and the assumptions y az and a 6 y it follows that ay az substituting into z az z ay step 2 2 proof that is a transitive i e for x y z x a a x y and a y z implies a x z i e from x 6 a y 6 a z 6 a x ay and y az it follows that x az from a az and the assumptions y az and y 6 a it follows that ay az substituting into the assumption x ay x az for a line structure y on a set x the equivalence relational join relation on x as defined in 3 7 join space associated with a line space is called the join relation associated with y for a line space x y the equivalence relational join space x is called the join space associated with x y join space concepts and join space notations when applied to a line structure on a set refer to its associated join relation when applied to a line space refer to its associated join space in particular for a c x ac ac if a 6 c a if a c proposition 3 8 equivalence relationality criterion let x be a join space the following conditions are equivalent 1 x is equivalence relational 2 for all a b c x a b c and a 6 b imply ab ac 3 for all a b c d x c d ab and c 6 d imply ab cd proof step 1 1 2 1 says that for all a x x is a equivalend relational by 3 6 base point equivalence relationality criterion this condition is equivalent to 2 step 2 2 3 case 2 1 a 6 c the assumption c ab says a c b with the assumption a 6 c and 2 it follows that ac ab therefore it suffices to prove that cd ac substituting ac ab into the assumption d ab d ac i e a d c thus c d a with the assumption c 6 d and 2 it follows that cd ca consequently cd ac case 2 2 a c substituting into the claim for a b d x it is to be proved that a d ab and a 6 d imply ab ad i e a d b and a 6 d imply ad ab this claim is condition 2 with the substitutions b d c b step 3 3 2 substituting d a in 3 for a b c x c a ab and c 6 a imply ab ca i e a c b and a 6 c imply ac ab interchanging b and c 2 follows let x be a join space x and are called preprojective iff the following conditions are satisfied x is equivalence relational for all a b c d x if b c or a d or bc ad 6 then a b or c d or ab cd 6 12 wolfram retter each of the following two figures illustrates the case bc ad 6 ab cd 6 a b d c a b c d x and are called dense iff it satisfies the following condition for all a b x if a 6 b then ab a b 6 the affine join space on a left vector space is dense iff s 3 the line segment join space on a left vector space over a totally ordered division ring is dense x and are called projective iff it is preprojective and dense thus a projec tive join space is a pair consisting of a set x and a ternary relation on x such that the conditions below are satisfied with the notation ac a c x x a x c for a c x and the numbering from 2 1 and from 10 chapter ii sect 4 where a translation of the conditions into english has been given postulato vii for a c x if a 6 c then a ac postulato vi for a c x if a 6 c then ac ca for a x aa a postulato x transitivity for all b c x if a b c a 6 b and a 6 c then ab ac postulato ix symmetry for all a b c x a b c and a 6 b implies a c b postulato xii preprojectivity for all a b c d x if b c or a d or bc ad 6 then a b or c d or ab cd 6 postulato viii density for all a b x if a 6 b then ab a b 6 in 2 1 ac is considered only for a 6 c the third condition which is therefore not contained in 2 1 provides a conventient convervative extension of the axiom system preprojectivity does not exactly coincide with the preprojectivity condition but is under the other conditions equivalent to it postulati i v and xi from 2 1 are not included postulato i says that x is a set postulati iv v say that for a c x if a 6 c then ac as a subset of x postulati ii iii xi say that the dimension of x is at least 2 here as in the assumptions for a general projective space in 7 1 this condition is not included in the defintion of projectivity the dimension of a projective join space is defined as the rank of the associated matroid minus 1 which equals the rank if the rank is infinite as noted after 3 7 join space associated with a line space join space concepts and join space notations when applied to a line structure on a set or line space refer to its associated join relation on the set or join space respectively in this sense it is well defined when a line space a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 13 and its line structure are called preprojective dense projective a projective line space is also called a projective space thus a projective space is a triple x y such that x y are sets and is a binary relation between x and y i e a subset of x y such that the conditions below are satisfied with the notation ac the unique y y such that a y c y if a 6 c a if a c for a c x and the numbering from 7 1 assumptions a 1 a 2 for a b x if a 6 b then there is exactly one y y such that a y b y assumption a 3 for all a b c d x if b c or a d or bc ad 6 then a b or c d or ab cd 6 assumption e for all a b x if a 6 b then ab a b 6 let v be a left vector space let x be the set of 1 dimensional subspaces of v y the set of 2 dimensional subspaces of v and the relation between x and y defined by a y a y the pair y is a projective line structure on x it is not

asscociated with the projective line structure over v is called the projective join relation over v the projective join space associated with the projective line space over v is called the projective join space over v 4 the correspondence between set represented line spaces and equivalence relational join spaces the following theorem establishes a natural one to one correspondence between the set represented line structures and the equivalence relational join relations on a set theorem 4 1 correspondence between set represented line spaces and equivalence relational join spaces let x be a set

following conditions are equivalent 1 x is join equivalence relational 2 x is join transitive 3 for all a b c x a bc ab c 4 for all a b c d x if c b a d is dependent then a b c d is dependent 5 x is preprojective proof step 1 1 2 the assumption that x is equivalence relational entails that x is symmetric consequently 1 which says that x is symmetric and join transitive is equivalent to 2 step 2 2 3 is a particular case of 5 1 join transitivity criterion step 3 3 4 it is to be proved for all a b c d x d a bc d ab c iff for all a b c d x c b a d dependent implies a b c d dependent the assumption that x is equivalence relational entails that x is a equivalence relational and b symmetric the claim follows by 3 3 rejoinability criterion step 4 5 4 it is to be proved for all a b c d x c b a d dependent implies a b c d dependent iff for all a b c d x if b c or a d or bc ad 6 then a b or c d or ab cd 6 the assumption that x is equivalence relational entails that x is c symmetric the claim follows by 3 5 quadruple dependence criterion corollary 5 3 projectivity criterion a join space is projective iff it is dense and join equivalence relational a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 17 6 matroid criteria it is shown how the concepts of a preprojective join space and of a projective join space can be derived from the concept of a matroid let x be a set a closure system or moore family on x is a set c of subsets of x such that x c and for each non empty d c d c a closure space is a pair consisting of a set x and a closure system c on x a set a x is called closed iff a c when x o is a topological space then the pair consisting of x and the set of closed sets in x o is a closure space when x is a join space then the pair consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is a closure space when x is a group then the pair consisting of x and the set of subgroups is a closure space the concept of a closure space as defined here is slighly more general than in 8 chapter i 1 2 where it is required that c and a closure system is called a protopology a group with its set of subgroups wouldn t be a closure space under this narrower defintion a closure space x c is also simply denoted by x when it is clear from the context whether the closure space or only the set is meant let x c be a closure space for a x the closure of a is the set cl a b x b a and b c it is the smallest closed superset of a when x is a join space and c is the system of join closed sets in x then for a x the closure of a is the join closure of a for a x the entailment relation relative to a or a entailment relation is the binary relation a on x defined by x a y y cl a x x c is called an exchange space iff for each closed set a x one and therefore all of the following conditions hold which are equivalent by 4 proposition 3 1 1 3 the relation a is symmetric on x a the restriction a x a is an equivalence relation on x a x c is called algebraic or combinatorial iff for each chain d c d c 8 chapter i 1 3 states the equivalence of this definition with other well known definitions when x is a join space and c is the system of join closed sets in x then x c is a combinatorial closure space a matroid is a combinatorial exchange space when x is a vector space over a division ring then the pair consisting of x and the set of subspaces is a matroid the concept of a matroid as defined here is slighly more general than in 8 chapter i 1 2 where it is via the definition of a closure space required that c a vector space with its set of subspaces wouldn t be a matroid under this narrower defintion the following proposition is proposition 3 3 from 5 proposition 6 1 join transitive join spaces let x be a join transitive join space and a a join closed set then the relative entailment relation a is the reverse relation of the binary relation a 18 wolfram retter proof 5 proposition 3 3 the following proposition is proposition 3 4 from 5 it is a particular case of a more general principle for relational structures proposition 6 2 join spaces are combinatorial closure spaces let x be a join space then the closure space consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is combinatorial theorem 6 3 matroid criterion for join transitive join spaces let x be a join transitive join space the following conditions are equivalent 1 x is symmetric 2 x is join equivalence relational 3 the pair consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is an exchange space 4 the pair consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is a matroid proof step 1 1 2 2 says x is symmetric and join transitive with the assumption that x is join transitive this condition is equivalent to 1 step 2 1 3 it suffices to prove for each join closed set a that the binary relation a is symmetric on x a iff the relative entailment relation a is symmetric on x a symmetry being preserved under passing to the reverse relation it suffices to prove that for each join closed set a the relation a is the reverse relation of the relation a this claim follows by 6 1 join transitve join spaces from the assumption that x is join transitive step 3 3 4 follows by 6 2 join spaces are combinatorial closure spaces corollary 6 4 matroid preprojectivity criterion let x be a join space x is preprojective iff it is join transitive and the pair consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is a matroid proof by 5 3 projectivity criterion and 6 3 matroid criterion for join transitive join spaces the following conditions are equivalent x is preprojective x is join equivalence relational x is join transitive and symmetric x is join transitive and the pair consisting of x and the join closed sets is a matroid corollary 6 5 matroid projectivity criterion let x be a join space x is projective iff it is dense and join transitive and the pair consisting of x and the set of join closed sets is a matroid 7 conclusion in 4 1 4 correspondence between set represented line spaces and equivalence relational join spaces provides a natural one to one correspondence between projective spaces defined by ax ioms a 1 a 2 a 3 e in 2 1 and projective join spaces defined by postulati vi vii viii ix x xii in 2 1 5 2 join equivalence relationality criterion and 5 3 projectivity criterion amount to replacing the projective geometry axiom postulato xii in 2 1 by assioma xiii in 1 10 where it is part of an axiom system for order geometry thus projective geometry and a common axiomatic basis for projective geometry and order geometry 19 order geometry have a broad common axiomatic basis as a corollaries 6 4 matroid preprojec tivity criterion and 6 5 matroid projectivity criterion show how the concepts of a preprojective join space and of a projective join space can be derived from the concept of a matroid the defin ing properties of an equivalence relation have been used as a conceptual red thread in analogy to 4 chapter 3 and 5 where the defining properties of a partial order have been used as a conceptual red thread references 1 g peano i principii di geometria logacimente exposti fratelli bocca editori turin italy 1889 2 m pieri i principii della geometria
