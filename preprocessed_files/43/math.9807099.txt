quoc tho abstract in this paper we compute the k theory algebraic and topo logical and entire periodic cyclic homology for compact quantum groups define chern characters between them and show that the chern characters in both topological and algebraic cases are isomorphisms modulo torsion introduction non commutative differential geometry appeared as some quantization of classical differential geometry in particular different cyclic co homologies are non commutative versions of the classical de rham co homology of dif ferential forms or currents quantum groups were introduced at first as hopf bialgebra envelop of lie groups and later as special cases of quasi triangular drinfeld algebras or monoidal categories the theory is a subject of intensive current research many results have been obtained for quantum groups as analogues of the corresponding classical results for lie groups especially the theory of high est weight representations for compact quantum groups the representation theory is characterized by the highest weight representations just as in the case of representation theory of compact lie groups for the compact lie groups the k groups de rham cohomology groups and the chern characters between them have been well studied see 13 19 20 more recently the chern characters from k theory to entire cyclic homology of such groups have also been studied see 9 however such studies have not yet been done for quantum groups the aim of this paper is to compute the non commutative chern characters for compact quantum groups in a c algebra setting algebraic and topological k theories of banach algebras have been well studied and known to have such nice properties as homotopy invariance morita date july 17 1998 1991 mathematics subject

do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc tho invariance excision etc at the same time the entire cyclic cohomology he a defined by a connes with the non commutative chern characters chc given by the pairing k a he a c has been rather difficult to compute for various concrete algebras and indeed the authors are not aware of any computations involving algebras other then a c in this paper we define an entire cyclic homology he a by considering a direct system of ideals of a with ad invariant trace and using the pairing of the entire cochains of a connes at the level of ideals with elements of k a we now the structure of the paper in section 1 we at first recall definitions and main properties of compact quantum groups and their representations more precisely if g is a complex algebraic group with compact real form g its lie algebra a positive real number we define a c algebraic compact quan tum group c g as the c completion of the algebra f g with respect to the c norm where f g is the quantized hopf algebra of functions which is the hopf subalgebra of the hopf algebra dual to the quantized universal enveloping algebra u g generated by matrix elements of the u g modules of type 1 see 6 we proved that c g c t e 6 w w t k hw t dt where k hw t is the elementary algebra of compact operators in separable infinite dimensional hilbert space hw t and w is the weyl group of g with respect to a maximal torus t in section 2 we provide the definition and main properties of entire periodic cyclic homology of non commutative involutive banach algebras we prove in particular that when the c algebra a can be presented as direct limit lim i where i are ideals of a admitting an ad invariant trace then he a lim he i section 3 is devoted to chern characters we first compute the k groups of c g the he c g therefore we define the chern characters from k c g to he c g for any involutive banach algebra a endowed with a family of ideals with ad invariant trace when a c g we prove that he c g he c nt h dr nt and k c g k c nt k nt non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 3 finally we show that there is a commutative diagram k c g chc he c g y y k c nt chcq he c nt y y k nt ch h dr nt we deduce that chc is an isomorphism modulo torsion in section 4 we at first identify our definition of hp c g with cuntz quillen definition and then compute kalg c g hp c g and prove that the chern character chalg from kalg c g to hp c g is an isomorphism modulo torsion notes on notation for any compact space x we write k x for the z 2 graded topological k theory of x we use swan s theorem to identify k x with z 2 graded k c x for any involutive banach algebra a k a he a hp a are z 2 graded algebraic or topological k group of a entire cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology of a respectively if t is a maximal torus of a compact group g with the corresponding weyl group w write c t for the algebra of complex valued functions on t we use the standard notations from the root theory such as p p for the positive highest weights etc we denote by nt the normalizer of t in g by n the set of natural numbers r the field of real numbers and c the field of complex numbers 2 a n the standard 2 space of square integrable sequences of elements from a and finally by c g we denote the compact quantum group 1 compact quantum groups and their representations in this section we present a summary of some notions and results concerning compact quantum groups and their representations for later use the main reference is the book 6 let g be a complex algebraic group with lie algebra g lie g there is a one to one correspondence between 1 real forms of g 2 hopf structures on the universal enveloping algebra u g and 3 hopf structures on the dual f g u g the compact real form k can be characterized as the set of fixed points of conjugate linear involution of the algebra f g of representative functions of g 4 do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc tho in the hopf algebra dual u g one considers the hopf sub algebra f g generated by the matrix elements of finite dimensional u g module of type 1 see definition 13 1 1 from 6 if is real and 6 1 there exists a unique haar functional on f g which can be used to prove results similar to those for classical lie groups e g the schur orthogonality relations from this one can effectively study the unitary representations of compact quantum groups see 6 ch 13 in the classical theory there is a one dimensional unitary representation of the algebra f g associated to every point of the real form gr the cor responding involution since in the quantum case there are no points the study of unitary representations replaces the study of the space itself for compact quantum groups the unitary representations of f g are parameter ized by pairs w t where w is an element of the weyl group w of g and t is an element of of a fixed maximal torus of the compact real form of g let p v be the irreducible u g module of type 1 with the highest weight then v admits of a positive definite hermitian form such that xv 1 v 2 v 1 x v 2 for all v 1 v 2 v x u g let v be an orthogonal basis for weight space v p then v is an orthogonal basis for v let c s r x xvr vs be the associated matrix element of v then the matrix elements c s r where runs through p while r and s runs independently through the index set of a basis of v form a basis of f g see 6 now every irreducible representations of f sl 2 c is equivalent to a representation belonging to one of the following two families each of which is parameterized by s 1 t c t 1 i the family of one dimensional representations t ii the family t of representations in 2 n see 6 page 437 proposition 13 1 8 moreover there exists a surjective homomorphism f g f sl 2 c induced by the natural inclusion sl 2 c g and by composing the represen tation 1 of f sl 2 c with this homomorphism we obtain a representation of f g in 2 n denoted by si where si appears in the reduced decomposi tion w si 1 si 2 sik more precisely si f g l 2 n is of class ccr see 8 i e its image is dense in the ideal of compact operators in l 2 n the representation t is one dimensional and is of the form t c s r r s exp 2 1 x if t exp 2 1 x t for x t lie t see 13 1 d from 6 the unitary representations of compact quantum groups are classified as follows non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 5 every irreducible unitary representation of f g on a hilbert space is a completion of a unitarizable highest weight representation moreover two such representations are equivalent if and only if they have the same weight 6 theorem 13 1 7 the highest weight representations can be described as follows let w si 1 si 2 sik be a reduced decomposition of an element w of the weyl group w then i the hilbert space tensor product w t si 1 sik t is an irreducible representation of f g which is associated to the schubert cell sw ii up to equivalence the representation w t does not depend on the choice of the reduced decomposition of w iii every ir reducible representation of f g is equivalent to some w t see 6 theorem 13 1 9 moreover one can show that w t w t ker w t e i e the representation w w t w tdt is a faithful representation and dim w t 1 if w e if w 6 e see remarks 1 after theorem 13 1 9 from 6 we recall now the definition of c algebraic compact quantum group let g be a complex algebraic group with compact real form definition 1 1 6 definition 13 3 1 the c algebraic compact quantum group c g is the c completion of the algebra f g with respect to the c norm f sup f f f g where runs through the representations of f g and the norm on the right hand side is the operator norm we have the following result about the structure of compact quantum groups theorem 1 2 c g c t e 6 w w t k hw t dt where c t is the algebra of continuous function on t and k h is the ideal of compact operators in a separable hilbert space h 6 do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc tho proof let w si 1 si 2 sik be a reduced decomposition of the element w w into a product of reflections by construction the representations w t si 1 sik t where si is the composition of the homomorphism of f g onto f sl 2 c and the representation 1 of f sl 2 c in the hilbert space 2 n thus we have si c g c sl 2 c 1 l 2 n the last one is ccr see dixmier 8 and we have si c g k hsi t c g c w t c g k hs 1 k hsk c k hw t where hw t hs 1 hsk c here the tensor product of banach algebras always means the tensor with the minimal norm 2 stability of entire homology of non commutative de rham currents we briefly recall in this subsection a definition of operator k functors fol lowing g g kasparov a fredholm representation of a c algebra a is a triple 1 2 f consisting of representations 1 2 a l hb and a fredholm operator f f hb admitting an adjoint operator on the hilbert c module hb 2 b over c algebra b satisfying the relations 1 a f f 2 a kb where kb is the ideal of compact adjoint able c module endomorphisms of hb the classes of homotopy invariance and unitary equivalence of fredholm modules form the so called kasparov operator k group kk a b herewith put a c g b c where g is a compact lie group in this case we have k c g kk c g c where k a is algebraic k group of a from now on we shall use k a to denote either topological or algebraic k theory of the banach algebra a note that kk 0 a c k 0 a kk 1 a c k 1 a let us recall now the definition and properties of entire homology of banach algebras we refer the reader to 10 for a more detailed exposition let a be an involutive banach algebra recall that a connes defined entire cyclic cohomology he a and a pairing k a he a c non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 7 also m khalkhali 14 proved morita and homotopy invariance of he a we now define the entire homology he a as follows given a collection i of ideals in a equipped with a so called ada invariant trace i c satisfying the properties 1 is a continuous linear functional normalized as 1 2 is positive in the sense that a a 0 where the map a 7 a is the involution defining the involutive banach algebra structure i e an anti hermitian endomorphism such that a a 3 is strictly positive in the sense that a a 0 iff a 0 for every 4 is ada invariant in the sense that xa ax x a a i then we have for every a scalar product a b a b and also an inverse system i let i be the completion of i with respect to the scalar product defined above and i denote i with formally adjoined unity element define cn i as the set of n 1 linear maps i n 1 c there exists a hilbert structure on i n 1 and we can identify cn i hom c n i c with c n i via an anti isomorphism for i i we have a well defined map d c n i cn i which makes cn i into a direct system write q lim c n i and ob serve that it admits a hilbert space structure see 10 11 let cn a hom lim c n i c hom lim cn i c which is anti isomorphic to lim c n i so we have finally cn a lim cn i let b b cn i cn 1 i n cn i cn i cn i cn i s cn 1 i cn i 8 do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc tho be defined as in a connes 3 we adopt the notations in 14 denote by b b n s the corresponding adjoint operators note also that for each i we have the same formulae for adjoint operators for homology as connes obtained for cohomology we now have a bi complex c a b y b y b y 1 lim c 1 i n lim c 1 i 1 lim c 1 i n b y b y b y 1 lim c 0 i n lim c 0 i 1 lim c 0 i n with dv b in the even columns and dv b in the odd columns dh 1 from odd to even columns and dh n from even to odd columns where means the corresponding adjoint operator now we have tot c a even tot c a odd n 0 cn a which is periodic with period two hence we have n 0 cn a n 0 cn a where dv dh is the total differential definition 2 1 let hp a be the homology of the total complex totc a it is called the periodic cyclic homology of a note that this hp a is in general different from the hp a of cuntz quillen because we used the direct limit of periodic cyclic homology of ideals but in special cases when the whole algebra a is one of these ideals with ada invariant trace e g the commutative algebras of complex valued functions on compact spaces we return to the cuntz quillen hp which we shall use later definition 2 2 an even or odd chain fn n 0 in c a is called entire if the radius of convergence of the power series n n n 2 fn zn z c is infinite let ce a be the sub complex of c a consisting of entire chains then we have a periodic complex non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 9 theorem 2 3 let tot ce a even tot ce a odd n 0 cen a where cen a is the entire n chain then we have a complex of entire chains with the total differential dv dh n 0 c e n a n 0 c e n a definition 2 4 the homology of this complex is called also the entire ho mology and denoted by he a note that this entire homology is defined through the inductive limits of ideals with ad invariance trace in 10 11 the main properties of this theory namely homotopy invariance morita invariance and excision were proved and hence that he is a generalized homology theory lemma 2 5 if the banach algebra a can be presented as a direct limit lim i of a system of ideals i with ad invariant trace then k a lim k i he a lim he i proof let us consider k a k 0 a k 1 a by definition k 0 a e e e 2 mat a where mat a lim nmatn a lim nmatn lim i lim n lim matn i lim lim nmatn i lim mat i this means that k 0 a lim i by the same argument we can prove for the k 1 groups k 1 a gl a gl a gl a gl lim i gl lim i gl lim i lim gl i gl i gl i lim k i 10 do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc tho we consider now the c i bi complex c i b y b y b y 1 c 1 i n c 1 i 1 c 1 i n b y b y b y 1 c 0 i n c 0 i 1 c 0 i n the connecting maps of the direct system i i i for induces the same connecting maps for complexes c i c i c i for and finally we have for the corresponding total complexes lim totc i totc i it is easy to check the following claims c i c i totc i totc i and finally totc lim i lim totc i from the last claim it is easy to see that a cycle of the complex totc lim i can be presented as a sequence of cycles as an element from lim totc i the lemma is therefore proved the following result from k theory is well known theorem 2 6 the entire homology of non commutative de rham currents admits the following stability property k k h k c k a k h k a where h is a separable hilbert space and a is an arbitrary banach space the similar result is true for entire homology he non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 11 theorem 2 7 the entire homology of non commutative de rham currents admits the following stability property he k h he c he a k h he a where h is a separable hilbert space and a is an arbitrary banach space proof it is easy to see that k h is a direct limit of matrix algebras matn c as k h lim nmatn c and thus a k h a lim nmatn c lim na matn c the theorem is therefore deduced from the previous lemma 3 non commutative chern characters let a be a involutive banach algebra we construct a non commutative character chc k a he a and later show that when a c g this chern character reduces up to iso morphism to classical chern character on the normalizers of maximal compact tori let a be an involutive banach algebra with unity theorem 3 1 there exists a chern character chc k a he a proof we first recall that there exists a pairing kn a cn i c due to a connes see 4 hence there exists a mapkn a cn hom cn a c so by 1 1 we have for each a map kn a c n hom cn i c and hence a map kn a cn hom lim c n i c we now show that cn induces the chern map ch kn a hen a now let e be an idempotent in mk a for some k n it suffices to show that for n even if where cn i and cn 1 i then e n 1 1 n n e e e 0 however this follows from connes results in 4 lemma 7 the proof of the case for n odd would also follow from 4 12 do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc tho our next result computes the chern characters for a c g by reducing it to the classical case theorem 3 2 let t be a fixed maximal torus of g with weyl group w nt t then the chern character chc k c g he c g is an isomorphism modulo torsion i e chc k c g c he c g which can be identified with the classical chern character ch k c nt he c

last one is isomorphic with the topological k theory k nt next we have lemma 3 4 he c g he c nt h dr nt non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 13 proof the proof is analogous to that of 3 3 so we have he c g he c t e 6 w w t k hw t dt he c t he e 6 w w t k hw t dt he c t he e 6 w w t lim nmatn c dt he c t he lim n e 6 w w t matn c dt he c t lim nhe c w e t matn c he c t he c w e t he c t c w e t he c w t he c nt t t he c nt by using morita invariance property of he now since c nt is a com mutative c algebra then by cuntz quillen s result 7 we have a canonical isomorphism hp c nt h dr nt since c nt is smooth moreover by a result of khalkhali 14 15 hp c nt he c nt hence the re sult proof of theorem 3 2 now consider the commutative diagram i k c g chc he c g y y k c nt chcq he c nt y y k nt ch h dr nt now k c g k c nt by lemma 3 3 also he c g he c nt by lemma 3 4 by a result of khalkhali 14 15 we have he c nt hp c nt moreover hp c nt h dr nt since the algebra c nt is smooth in the sense of cuntz quillen see 7 hence he c nt h dr nt furthermore k c nt k nt by the well known swan the orem so all the vertical maps are isomorphisms it is well known that the bottom map ch is also an isomorphism modulo torsion i e ch k nt c h dr nt hence chcq and chc are isomorphisms modulo torsion the theorem is there fore proved 14 do ngoc diep aderemi o kuku and nguyen quoc

quillen 7 j cuntz and d quillen 7 defined the so called x complexes of c algebras and then used some ideas of fedosov product to define algebraic chern char acters we now briefly recall their definitions for a non commutative as sociate c algebra a consider the space of even non commutative differential forms a ra equipped with the fedosov product 1 2 1 2 1 1 d 1 d 2 see 7 consider also the ideal ia k 1 2 k a it is easy to see that ra ia a and that ra admits the universal property that any based linear map a m can be uniquely extended to a derivation d ra m the derivations d ra m bijectively correspond to lifting homomorphisms from ra to the semi direct product ra m which also bijectively correspond to linear map a a c m given by a a 7 d a from the universal property of 1 ra we obtain a bi module isomorphism ra a ra 1 ra as in 7 let a k 0 2 k 1 a then we have a ra a 1 ra 1 ra 1 ra ra j cuntz and d quillen proved theorem 4 1 7 theorem 1 there exists an isomorphism of z 2

the product in ra is just the fedosov product on even differential forms and the differentials on the x complex x ra ra a 1 ra a ra non commutative chern characters of compact quantum groups 15 become

nguyen quoc tho we now apply this machinery to our case first we have the following algebraic analogy of the lemma for hp lemma 4 2 hp c g hp c nt h dr nt proof by analogy with the proof of the previous proposition we also have hp c g hp c t e 6 w w t k hw t dt hp c t hp e 6 w w t k hw t dt hp c t hp e 6 w w t lim nmatn c dt hp c t hp lim n e 6 w w t matn c dt hp c t lim nhp c w e t matn c hp c t hp c w e t hp c t c w e t hp c w t hp c nt t t hp c nt by using morita invariance property of hp the last one is following cuntz quillen for the commutative c algebra a we have a canonical isomorphism from periodic cyclic homology to the z 2 graded de rham homology when a is smooth now for each idempotent e mn a there is an unique element x mn r a then the element e x x 1 2 n 1 2 n 2 n

furthermore by a result of cuntz quillen for the commutative c algebra a we have a canonical isomorphism from periodic cyclic homology to the z 2 graded de rham cohomology when a is smooth hence k c
