work was partially supported by the international centre for theoretical physics trieste italy partially by the alexander von humboldt foundation of germany and partially by the national fundamental science foundation of vietnam abstract this book is intended to provide a quick introduction to the subject the exposition is scheduled in the sequence as possible for more understanding for beginners the author exposed a k theoretic approach to study group c algebras started in the elementary part with one example of description of the structure of c algebra of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line continued then for some special classes of solvable and nilpotent lie groups in the second advanced part he introduced the main tools of the theory in particular the conception of multidimensional geometric quantization and the index of group c algebras were created and developed 3 preface the main idea to create this book is to provide a quick introduction to the subject from the lowest level of beginners up to the actual research work level of working researchers certainly we can not collect all together so that we must do some choice our main choice is based on experiences with our research group on k theory harmonic analysis and mathematical physics from the teaching experience with postgraduate students in our group we decide to expose the material in such a sequence that any time the reader can stop over to take out the corresponding research problem this means also that in the introduction which is reserved to the experts we introduce the main ideas perhaps these readers need not to read in detail the rest of the book other readers are the beginners they need to start from some very concrete examples to illustrate the main ideas so they should read from the part one they could stop at the end of this part to do by themselves some research for other classes of examples the third possibility is reserved to the readers who need to known only the results what are new in the general theory they could read the introduction chapter and then go directly to the part ii of the advanced theory and finally for the fourth class of readers who want known all in the subject they should read the chapters in the same sequence as scheduled in the book we hope that many of readers could take contribution in perfecting the theory to solve the problem which is very important from the point of view of theory and of applications in physics and in mathematics the author is very much indebted to his teacher prof dr a a kirillov for introducing him to the subject prof dr g g kasparov discussed with him many times on the subject during 1977 after returned from moscow university in 1977 he was happy to meet prof dr p cartier who has totally supported him to develop research in this domain and arranged for him a one year visit 1983 at ihes bures s yvette france where he could work with prof dr a connes discussions with prof dr a connes were not so much but by which the author has believed some close relation of the subject with non commutative geometry prof dr a bak and prof dr j cuntz provided him a possibility to work in germany as a humboldt fellow 1991 1993 by the way he could work in the nice conditions of alexander von humboldt foundation and german universities bielefeld and heidelberg prof dr k h hofmann arranged for him some visits to technische hochschule darmstadt as visiting c 3 professor and completely supported him in research during this time and especially during the time when the author prepared 3 invited lectures 4 for annual session summer 1993 of the seminar sophus lie the idea about a book on the subject was appeared the international centre for theoretical physics has agreed to provide him a scientific stay august october 1996 to support his project to complete writing this book it is a great pleasure for the author to express the deep and sincere thanks to them and the institutions for

the main problem we are interested in is how to characterize groups and their group algebras this problem is well solvable with the complex representation theory of finite or compact groups it seems to be quite difficult for locally compact groups we focus our attention in this survey only on the topological method of characterizing the group c algebras 1 the scope and an example 1 1 the problem let us first of all consider a finite group g g it is easy to see that the group g can be included in some co algebras more precisely some hopf bialgebra for example in its complex group hopf bi algebra g c g g g 7 g g g g g c g which consists of the formal linear combinations of form g g cgg and where g is the kronecker symbol corresponding to g it is well known that the group representation theory of g is equivalent to the algebra represen tation theory of c g the last one is practically more flexible to describe with each representation of this group one considers the fourier gel fand transforms of the algebra c g to the matrix algebra corresponding to rep resentation g g cgg 7 g g cg g let us denote g the dual of g i e the set of equivalence classes of ir reducible representations of g we normally identify it with some set of representatives of equivalence classes it is well known that a the set g is finite i e there is only finite number of nonequivalent irreducible representations say 1 n b each irreducible representation is finite dimensional say of dimension ni i 1 2 n 7 8 1 introduction c this algebra c g by using the fourier gel fand transformation is isomorphic to the finite cartesian product of matrix algebras c g n i 1 matni c this means that the structure of the group algebra c g and therefore of the group g is well defined if we could for g do 1 a good construction of all the irreducible representations i i 1 n of g and 2 the fourier gel fand transformation realizing the above cited isomor phism the problem is to extend this machinery to infinite say locally compact topological groups let us from now on consider a locally compact group g and consider some appropriate group algebras the group algebras c g for g as an abstract group is not enough to define the structure of g we must find a more effective group algebra it is well known that for any locally compact group g one must in place of the general linear representations consider the unitary ones it is related with the fact that in general case one must consider also the infinite dimen sional representations which are not every time completely reducible the unitary representations however are completely irreducible in case of a lo cally compact group g there is a natural left right invariant haar measure dg the space l 2 g l 2 g dg of the square integrable functions plays an important role in harmonic analysis if the group is of type i l 2 g admits a spectral decomposition with respect to the left and right regular representations into a sum of the direct sum the so called discrete series and or the direct integral the continuous series of irreducible unitary rep resentations the space l 1 g l 1 g dg of the functions with integrable module plays a crucial role with the well defined convolution product l 1 g 7 l 1 g x g y y 1 x dy it becomes a banach algebra there is also a well defined fourier gel fand transformation on l 1 g l 1 g g 7 g x x dx 1 the scope and an example 9 there is a one to one correspondence between the irreducible unitary rep resentations of g and the non degenerate irreducible representations of the involutive banach algebra l 1 g the general theorems of the spec tral theory of the representations of g are then proved with the help of an appropriate translation in to the corresponding theory of l 1 g for which one can use more tools from functional analysis and topology one can also define on l 1 g an involution 7 g g 1 however the norm of the involutive banach algebra l 1 g is not regular i e in general a a l 1 g 6 a 2 l 1 g it is therefore more useful to consider the corresponding regular norm c g c g sup g and its completion c g the spectral theory of unitary representations of g is equivalent to the spectral theory of non degenerate representations of the c algebra c g the general theorems of harmonic analysis say that the structure of g can be completely definite by the structure of c g one poses therefore the problem of description of the structure of the c algebras of locally compact groups this means that we must answer to the questions 1 how to realize the irreducible unitary representations of the locally compact group g 2 how to describe the images of the fourier gel fand transformation and in particular of the inclusion of c g into some continuous product of the algebras l h g of bounded operators in the separable hilbert space h of representation to see that this is a good setting the problem for finite group to the lo cally compact groups let us consider these questions for the compact group case consider for the moment a compact group g for compact group all representations are unitarizable i e are equivalent to some unitary ones it is well known also that a the family of irreducible representations is not more than countable b each irreducible representation is finite dimensional say ni i 1 and there is some good realizations of these representations say in tensor spaces or last time in cohomologies 10 1 introduction c the fourier gel fand transformation gives us an isomorphism c g i 1 matni c where the prime in the product means the subset of continuous van ishing at infinity elements this means that in compact group case the group c algebra plays the same role as the group algebra of finite groups let us now return to the general case of locally compact group the main problem is how to describe the group algebra in general and in particular the c algebra c g in general the problem of describing the structure of c algebras of non compact groups rests open up date this review outlines only the well known cases where is a nice interaction of the methods from noncommu tative geometry say orbit method category o kk theory deformation quantization cyclic theories we restrict mainly onto the case of lie groups 1 1 1 analytic method the first nontrivial example is the group sl 2 c its c algebra was studied by j m g fell in 1961 in fe 1 he described exactly the fourier gel fand transforms of c g as some c algebra of sections of a continuous field of operator algebras over the dual many other mathematicians attempted to generalize his beautiful but compli cate analytic result to other groups nevertheless until the moment the only groups the structure of whose c algebras were explicitly described are the abelian or compact groups and a few semi simple lie groups say sl 2 r and its universal covering s l 2 r the de sitter group spin 4 1 and recently a family g p q of two step solvable lie groups see de f m km bm and wan 1 a fair amount is known about the c algebras of nilpotent lie groups see p including the heisenberg groups the c algebra of the euclidean motion group were studied by evans ev also p green gr proposed some another analytic method for studying the c algebras of several solvable lie groups the result are given very slowly and spectacularly one need therefore to develop another method say to obtain some topo logical invariants which will be described in the rest of this paper 1 1 2 k theory approach the very useful k functor for our approach is the operator kk functor of g g kasparov kas 1 generalizing the bdf k functor bdf 1 which characterizes the isomorphic classes of short exact sequences of c algebras we are trying to decompose our c algebras into some towers of ideals and step by step define the associated extensions by kk functors or their 1 the scope and an example 11 generalizations the resulting invariants form just our index this idea was proposed in d 1 and developed in d 2 for a large class of type i c algebras hence there are two general problems 1 find out the c algebras which can be characterized by the well known k functors say by the operator k functors 2 generalize the theory of k functors in such a way that they are ap plicable for a large class of c algebras concerning the first problem we propose d 8 a general construction and some reduction procedure of the k theory invariant ind c g of group c algebras using the orbit method ki d 4 d 7 we reduces index c g to a family of connes foliation c algebras indices index c v 2 ni f 2 ni see c 1 c 2 by a family of kk theory invariants using some generalization of the kasparov type condition treated by g g kasparov in the nilpotent lie group case kas 2 we reduces every indexc v 2 ni f 2 ni to a family of kk theory invariants of the same type valuated in kk x y type groups the last ones are in some sense com putable by using the cup cap product realizing the fredholm operator in dices to demonstrate the idea we consider the c algebra of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line but first of all we need some new k functor tool it is described in the next two subsections 1 2 bdf k homology functor let us recall in this subsection the well known bdf k functor ext the main reference is bdf 1 denote by c x the c algebra of continuous complex valued functions over a fixed metrizable compact x h a fixed separable hilbert space over complex numbers l h and k h the c algebras of bounded and respectively compact linear operators in h an extension of c algebras means a short exact sequence of c algebras and homomorphisms of special type 0 k h e c x 0 two extensions are by definition equivalent iff there exists an isomorphism e e and its restriction k h 1 k h 1 k h 2 such that the following diagram is commutative 0 k h 1 e 1 c x 0 y y 0 k h 2 e 2 c x 0 there is a canonical universal extension of c algebras 0 k h l h a h 0 12 1 introduction the quotient algebra a h l h k h is well known as the calkin al gebra by the construction of fiber product there is one to one correspon dence between the extensions of type 0 k h e c x 0 and the unital monomorphisms of type c x a h thus we can identify the extensions with the inclusions of c x into a h because ki all separable hilbert spaces are isomorphic and the automor phisms of k h are inner and autk h pu h the projective unitary group where u h denotes the unitary operator group we can identify the equivalences classes of extensions with the unitary conjugacy classes of unital inclusions of c x into the calkin algebra two extensions 1 and 2 are equivalent iff there exists a unitary operator u h 1 h 2 such that 2 u 1 where by definition u a h 1 a h 2 is the isomorphism obtained from the inner isomorphism u u 1 l h 1 l h 2 extension c x a h is called trivial iff there exists a unital in clusion c x l h such that where l h a h l h k h is the canonical quotient map this inclusion cor responds to the split short exact sequence the sum of two extensions i c x ai i 1 2 is defined as the extension 1 2 c x a h 1 a h 2 a h 1 h 2 this definition is compatible also with the equivalence classes of extensions in bdf 1 the authors proved that 1 the equivalence class of trivial extension is the identity element with respect to this sum 2 for every metrizable compact x the set ext 1 x of the equivalence classes of extensions is an abelian group one defines the higher groups by ext 1 n x ext 1 sn x n 0 1 2 3 ext is a generalized k homology in particular the group ext 1 x is dependent only of the homotopy type of x and there is a homo morphism y ext 1 x homz k 1 x z which will be an isomorphism if x r 3 1 the scope and an example 13 this k homology is well developed and fruitfully applicable it has many application in operator theory and in our problem of characterizing the group c algebras let us demonstrate this in the first example of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line 1 3 topological invariant index let us in this subsection denote by g the group of all affine transformations of the real straight line theorem 1 1 every irreducible unitary representation of group g is unitarilly equivalent to one of the following mutually nonequivalent repre sentations a the representation s realized in the space l 2 r dx x where r r 0 and acting in according with the formula sgf x e 1 bxf ax where g b 0 1 b the representation u realized in c 1 and given by the formula u g 1 sgn where r 0 1 proof see gn this list of all the irreducible unitary representations gives the corre sponding list of all the irreducible non degenerate unitary representations of the group c algebra c g in d 1 it was proved that theorem 1 2 the group c algebra with formally adjoined unity c g can be included in a short exact sequence of c algebras and homomorphisms 0 k c g c s 1 s 1 0 i e the c algebra c g following the bdf theory is defined by an ele ment called the index and denoted by indexc g of the groups ext s 1 s 1 z z proof see d 1 the infinite dimensional representation s realizes the inclusion said above since ext s 1 s 1 homz 1 s 1 s 1 z it realized by a homomorphism from 1 s 1 s 1 to c since the isomor phism y ext s 1 s 1 homz 1 s 1 s 1 z is obtained by means of computing the indices and because the general type of elements of 1 s 1 s 1 is gk l g 0 1 k g 1 0 l k l z we have ind gk l k ind t g 1 0 l ind t g 0 1 14 1 introduction where t is the the isomorphism corresponding to s it is enough therefore to compute the pair of two indices ind t g 1 0 and ind t g 0 1 the last ones are directly computed by the indices of the corresponding fredholm operators theorem 1 3 indexc g 1 1 ext s 1 s 1 z z proof see d 1 let us now go to the general situation to do this we must introduce also some preparation about first of all the construction of irreducible unitary representations we mean the orbit method then a method of decomposing the c algebra into a tower of extensions and lastly compute the index with the help of the general kk theory 2 multidimensional orbit methods let us in this section consider the problem of realization of irreducible unitary representations of lie groups there are two versions of the orbit method one is the multidimensional quantization the other is the infini tesimal orbit method related with the so called category o 2 1 multidimensional quantization the orbit method can be con structed from the point of view of the theory of holomorphly induced repre sentations and also from the point of view of the ideas of quantization from physics 2 1 1 construction of partially invariant holomorphically induced rep resentations let us consider now a connected and simply connected lie group g with lie algebra g lie g denote by gc the complexification of g the complex conjugation in the lie algebra will be also denoted by an over line sign consider the dual space g to the lie algebra g the group g acts on itself by the inner automorphisms a g g g 1 g g for each g g conserving the identity element e as some fixed point it follows therefore that the associated adjoint action a g maps g teg into itself and the co adjoint action k g a g 1 maps the dual space g into itself the orbit space o g g g is in general a bad topological space namely non hausdorff consider one orbit o g and an element f g in it the stabilizer is denote by gf its connected component by 2 multidimensional orbit methods 15 gf 0 and its lie algebra by gf lie gf it is well known that gf g y f is a principal bundle with the structural group gf let us fix some con nection in this principal bundle i e some trivialization of this bundle see suw we want to construct representations in some cohomology spaces with coefficients in the sheaf of sections of some vector bundle associated with this principal bundle it is well know suw that every vector bun dle is an induced one with respect to some representation of the structural group in the typical fiber it is natural to fix some unitary representation of gf such that its kernel contains gf 0 the character f of the connected component of stabilizer f expx exp 2 1 f x and therefore the differential d f is some representation of the lie algebra gf we suppose that the representation d f was extended to the complexification gf c the whole space of all sections seems to be so large for the construction of irreducible unitary representations one consider the invariant subspaces with the help of some so called polarizations definition 2 1 we say that a triple p 0 is some f polarization iff a p is some subalgebra of the complex lie algebra g c containing gf b the subalgebra p is invariant under the action of all the operators of type adgcx x gf c the vector space p p is the complexification of some real subalgebra m p p g d all the subgroups m 0 h 0 m h are closed where by definition m 0 resp h 0 is the connected subgroup of g with the lie algebra m resp h p g and m gf m 0 h gf h 0 e 0 is an irreducible representation of h 0 in some hilbert space v such that 1 the restriction gf h 0 is some multiple of the restriction f gf h 0 where by definition f expx exp 2 1 f x 2 under the action of gf on the dual h 0 the point 0 is fixed f is some representation of the complex lie algebra p in v which satisfies the e nelson conditions for h 0 and h d 0 let us recall that r blattner introduced the notion of mixed manifold of type k l see for example ki we consider the fiber bundle the base of which is some type k l mixed manifold and the fibers of which are 16 1 introduction smooth m dimensional manifold we say that this fiber bundle is some mixed manifold of type k l m theorem 2 1 let us keep all the introduced above notation of f gf etc and let us denote f the character of the group gf such that d f 2 1 f gf then 1 on the k orbit f there exists a structure of some mixed manifold of type k l m where k dimg dimm l 1 2 dimm dimh m dimh dimgf 2 there exists some irreducible unitary representation of the group h such that its restriction gf is some multiple of the representation f and h d 3 on the g fiber bundle e gf g gf v associated with the representa tion gf there exists a structure of a partially invariant and partially holomorphic hilbert vector g bundle e such that the natural repre sentation of g on the space of partially invariant and partially holo morphic sections is equivalent to the representation by right transla tions of g in the space c g p f 0 of v valued c functions on g satisfying the equations f hx h f x h h x g lxf x f 0 x p where lx denotes the lie derivative along the vector field x on g corresponding to x proof the first assertion is clear the second one can be deduced from the remark that the formula x h 7 iv f x 0 h defines an irreducible representation of the direct product gf h 0 which is trivial on the kernel of the surjection gf h 0 gf h 0 this point is essential in the sense that with the assumption about fixed point property of 0 we can ignore the mackey obstacle appeared when we take the representations which are multiple of some representations f at the restriction to some normal subgroup m duflo du 1 considered two fold covering to avoid this obstacle see d 5 2 multidimensional orbit methods 17 one can than apply the construction of unitarization e to obtain the corresponding unitary representation which is noted by ind g p f 0 one can define also the representations in cohomologies with coefficients in this sheaf of partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections which will be noted by l 2 coh ind g p f 0 remark 2 1 one introduces some order in the set of all f polar izations p 0 p 0 p p 0 h 0 0 p to have some irreducible representation one must take the maximal polar izations in this construction it is interesting that this representations are coincided with the representations appeared from the geometric quantiza tion 2 1 2 multidimensional geometric quantization let us now consider the general conception of multidimensional geometric quantization con sider a symplectic manifold m i e a smooth manifold equipped with a non degenerate closed skew symmetric differential 2 form the vector space c m with respect to the poisson brackets f 1 f 2 c 7 f 1 f 2 c m become an infinite dimensional lie algebra definition 2 2 a procedure of quantization is a correspondence asso ciating to each classical quantity f c m a quantum quantity q f l h i e a continuous perhaps unbounded normal operator which is auto adjoint if f is a real valued function in some hilbert space h such that q f 1 f 2 i q f 1 q f 2 q 1 idh where h 2 is the normalized planck constant and h is the unnormal ized planck s constant let us denote by e a fiber bundle into hilbert spaces a fixed con nection conserving the hilbert structure on the fibers in other words if is a curve connecting two points x and x the parallel transport along the way provides an scalar preserving isomorphism from the fiber ex onto the fiber ex in this case we can define the corresponding covariant deriv ative v ect m der c m in the space of smooth sections one considers the invariant hilbert space l 2 e which is the completion of the space e of square integrable partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections 18 1 introduction suppose from now on that m is a homogeneous g space choose a trivialization of the principal bundle gx g m where gx is the stabilizer of the fixed point x on m let us denote by l the lie derivation corresponding to the vector field v ect m let us denote by 1 m the form of affine connection on e corresponding to the connection on the principal bundle it is more comfortable to consider the normalized connection form 1 the values of which are anti auto adjoint operators on fibers one has therefore l 1 see for example suw for the finite dimensional case for each function f c m one denotes f the corresponding hamil tonian vector field i e i f df 0 definition 2 3 we define the geometrically quantized operator q f as q f f 1 f f 1 l f f theorem 2 2 the following three conditions are equivalent 1 1 id 2 the curvature of the affine connection is equal to 1 id i e 1 id 3 the correspondence f 7 q f is a quantization procedure proof see d 6 suppose that the lie group g act on m by the symplectomorphisms then each element x of the lie algebra g corresponds to one parameter subgroup exp tx in g which acts on m let us denote by x the corre sponding strictly hamiltonian vector field let us denote also lx the lie derivation along this vector field we have lx ly l x y and lxf fx f 2 multidimensional orbit methods 19 suppose that fx depends linearly on x one has then a 2 cocycle of the action c x y fx fy f x y definition 2 4 we say that the action of g on m is flat iff this 2 cocycle is trivial in this case we obtain from the quantization procedure a representation of the lie algebra g by the anti auto adjoint operators x 7 1 q fx and also a representation of g by the functions x 7 fx if the e nelson conditions are satisfied we have a unitary representation of the universal covering of the group g theorem 2 3 the lie derivative of the partially invariant and holo morphically induced representation ind g p f 0 of a connected lie group g is just the representation obtained from the procedure of multidimensional geometric quantization corresponding to a fixed connection of the par tially invariant partially holomorphic induced unitarized bundle e i e liex ind g p f 0 1 q fx proof see d 4 remark 2 2 the multidimensional version of the orbit method was developed independently by the author in language of multidimensional quantization d 4 d 7 and by m duflo du 1 see also ki in the lan guage of mackey method of small subgroups the result show that for the most connected lie groups the construction gives us at least a quantity of irreducible unitary representations enough to decompose the regular rep resentations of g in l 2 g i e enough to prove the planchere l formula du 1 remark 2 3 there are some reductions of this multidimensional quan tization procedure to the radical or nil radical of stabilizer of type gf see dv and lifting them to u 1 coverings vui 1 vui 3 do 1 do 2 remark 2 4 in d 10 the author proposed some method for common quantization for foliations the fibers of which are the k orbits and its relation with the integral fourier operators 20 1 introduction 2 2 category o and globalization of harish chandra modules the construction of irreducible unitary representations l 2 coh ind g p f 0 in the hilbert space l 2 e l 2 g p f 0 can be in restricted case considered as some globalization of some so called g k module i e l 2 e 0 k itself is some g k module where k is some maximal compact subgroup of g it is therefore interesting to consider these g k module as some infinitesimal version of the orbit method let us see this in this subsection 2 2 1 admissible representations let us in this sub subsection recall some result about the borell weil bott kostant theorem and the construc tion of admissible representations of finite dimensional semi simple lie groups as g k modules wo mi 2 if g is a compact connected lie group and f g is a well regular integral functional on its lie algebra then the stabilizer is a maximal torus t if the harish chandra criterion for existence of discrete series holds it is a compact cartan subgroup and a choice of positive root system g t defines a g invariant complex manifold structure on g t in such a way that g represents the holomorphic tangent space the character 1 f can be extended to a character of the sta bilizer gf t if the orbit is as usually supposed to be integral let us denote in this case the induced bundle e simply by e as in wo it is the associated homogeneous holomorphic hermitian line bundle one writes o e g t for the sheaf of germs of holomorphic sections of e g t the group g acts every where including the cohomologies hq g t o e one denotes by 12 the half sum of positive roots we cite from wo the borel weil bott kostant theorem theorem 2 4 if is singular then every hq g t o e is trivial if is regular let w denote the unique element such that w 0 and let w denote its length as a word in the simple root reflections then i hq g t o e 0 for all q 6 w and ii the action of g in hq g t o e is the representation with highest weight w this result was then extended for realizing the discrete series repre sentations of general semi simple lie groups it is well known that one can induce from these discrete series representations of reductive part of parabolic subgroups to obtain the tempered admissible representations of g it was then remarked that the representation of g in l 2 e can be considered as the globalization of some g k module namely l 2 e k 3 kk theory invariant indexc g 21 lastly the tempered admissible representations are described in the co homologies corresponding to d modules mi 2 2 2 2 discrete series for loop groups let us now consider the loop groups associated with compact lie groups with the help of the zuck ermann s derived functor we can construct the infinitesimal version of the discrete series for loop groups d 9 the algebraic realization of these representations are described in d 9 as a version of the borel weil bott kostant theorem it is very interesting to develop a theory of tempered representations for loop groups 3 kk theory invariant indexc g 3 1 about kk functors we now recall some essential points of the kasparov s setting of the kk theory it is an analogy of the brown douglas fillmore theory but settled for the general case 3 1 1 definitions the main reference for this sub subsection is jt let a b e to be the c algebras k the ideal of compact operators in some fixed separable hilbert space let us consider the extensions of type 0 b k e a 0 two extensions are said to be equivalent iff there is some isomorphism e e such that it induces the identity isomorphisms on the ideal b k and on the quotient a i e the following diagram is commutative 0 b k e a 0 y 0 b k e a 0 the extension is called trivial if the the exact sequence can be lifted also due to well known result of r c busby we can identify each extension with some homomorphism from a to the algebra of exterior multiplicators of b k a o b k the sum of two extensions i a o b k can be therefore defined as the extension 1 2 a o b k o b k o b k m 2 o b k where m 2 is the full algebra of 2 2 matrices over the complexes numbers two extensions i i 1 2 are stably equivalent if there exist two trivial extensions 1 and 2 such that the sums i i i 1 2 are equivalent kasparov kas 1 proved that i when a is a nuclear separable and b has at list an approximative unity the set ext a b of the stably equivalent classes of extensions is an abelian group 22 1 introduction

subsection 3 1 2 relation with k groups of c algebras the most important for us is the relation of the theory with k groups of c algebras let a be an algebra with unity by definition k 0 a is the grothendieck group of the semi group of the stably equivalent classes of projective a modules of finite type when a has no unity element one considers the algebra a with the formally adjoint unity and defines the k group as k a ker k a k c z this definition is compatible with the above defined k groups also for al gebras with unity element for a c x there is a natural isomorphism between these k groups with the corresponding topological groups k x see for example kar 1 one defines the higher groups kn a as kn a k 0 a c 0 rn n 0 the bott theorem says that k 0 a k 2 a the connes kasparov theo rem says that for any connected and simply connected solvable lie group g k 0 c g z if dim g is even 0 if others k 1 c g 0 if dim g is even z if otheres for each extension 0 j e a 0 there is a six term exact sequence of k groups k 0 e k 0 a k 0 j k 1 j k 1 a k 0 e 3 kk theory invariant indexc g 23 let us consider the case j b k there is an isomorphism between k j and k b the group k a consists of the formal differences of equivalence classes of projectors in a k one obtain therefore the well known exact sequence k 0 e k 0 a 0 k 0 b k 1 b 1 k 1 a k 1 e it is therefore clear that each element of ext a b induces a pair of homo morphisms 0 1 of k groups and one has a homomorphism exti a b j z 2 homz ki j a ki j 1 b associating to each extension a pair of connecting homomorphisms 0 1 j

index c g we review in this section a construction for obtaining the short exact sequence of c algebras 3 2 1 measurable foliations in this section we propose a canonical method for constructing the measurable c 1 foliations consisting of the adjoint or bits of fixed dimension and therefore their c algebras the last ones are included in group c algebras or their quotients let us denote by g a connected and simply connected lie group g lie g its lie algebra g homr g r the dual vector space o o g the space of all the co adjoint orbits of g in g this space is a disjoint union of subspaces of co adjoint orbits of fixed dimension i e o 0 2 n dimgo 2 n o 2 n o dim 2 n we define v 2 n dim 2 n then it is easy to see that v 2 n is the set of points of a fixed rank of the poisson structure bilinear function x y f f x y 24 1 introduction suppose it is a foliation at least for v 2 n with 2 n max first we shall show that the foliation v 2 n can be obtained by the asso ciated action of r 2 n on v 2 n via 2 n times repeated action of r indeed fixing any basis x 1 x 2 x 2 n of the tangent space g gf of at the point f we can define an action r 2 n y v 2 n as r y r y r y v 2 n by t 1 t 2 t 2 n 7 exp t 1 x 1 exp t 2 nx 2 n f thus we have the hamiltonian vector fields k d dt t 0 exp tkxk f k 1 2 2 n and the linear span f 2 n 1 2 2 n provides a tangent distribution theorem 3 1 v 2 n f 2 n is a measurable foliation proof see d 8 corollary 3 1 the connes c algebra c v 2 n f 2 n o 2 n dimg are well defined 3 2 2 reduction of indexc g to indexc v 2 n f 2 n now we assume that the orbit method see ki d 4 d 6 gives us a complete list of irre ducible representations of g f ind g f p xg f the finite set of duflo s data suppose that o ki 1 o 2 ni is the decomposition of the orbit space on a stratification of orbits of di mensions 2 ni where n 1 n 2 nk 0 we include c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 into c g it is well known that the connes c algebra of foliation can be included in the algebra of pseudo differential operators of degree 0 as an ideal this algebra of pseudo differential oper ators of degree 0 is included in c g we define j 1 f o g o 2 n 1 ker f 3 kk theory invariant indexc g 25 and a 1 c g j 1 then c g c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 a 1 and we have 0 j 1 c g a 1 0 id 0 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 c g c g c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 0 hence j 1 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 and we have o c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 c g a 1 0 repeating the procedure in replacing c g c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 a 1 j 1 by a 1 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 a 2 j 2 we have 0 c v 2 n 2 f 2 n 2 a 1 a 2 0 etc so we obtain the following result theorem 3 2 the group c algebra c g can be included in a finite sequence of extensions 1 0 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 c g a 1 0 2 0 c v 2 n 2 f 2 n 2 a 1 a 2 0 k 0 c v 2 nk f 2 nk ak 1 ak 0 where a k char g corollary 3 2 indexc g is reduced to the system indexc v 2 ni f 2 ni i 1 2 k by the invariants i kk ai c v 2 ni f 2 ni i 1 2 k remark 3 1 ideally all these invariants i could be computed step by step from k to 1 26 1 introduction 3 2 3 reduction of indexc v 2 ni f 2 ni to the computable extension in dices valuated in topological kk groups of pairs of spaces let us consider c v 2 ni f 2 ni for a fixed i we introduce the following assumptions which were considered by kasparov in nilpotent cases k 2 a 1 there exists k z 0 k 2 ni such that the foliation vgen v 2 ni lie has its c algebra c vgen f vgen c o gen k h where rk r 2 ni g lie rk g gfi lie g v 2 ni example 3 1 if vgen is a principal bundle or the space ogen vgen g is a hausdorff space then c vgen f vgen c o gen k h it is easy to see that if the condition a 1 holds c v 2 ni f 2 ni is an ex tension of c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni by c o gen k h whereo gen f f ogen xg f described by the multidimensional orbit method from the previous section if k 2 ni r 2 ni o v 2 ni vgen we have c v 2 ni f 2 ni c o 2 ni k h if k k 1 2 ni then r 2 ni k 1 acts on v 2 ni vgen and we suppose that a similar assumption a 2 holds a 2 there exists k 2 0 k 2 2 ni k 1 such that v 2 ni vgen gen v 2 ni vgen rk 2 has its c algebra c v 2 ni vgen gen f 2 ni c o 2 ni ogen gen k h as above if k 2 2 ni k 1 c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni c o 2 ni ogen gen k h in other case we repeat the procedure and go to assumption a 3 etc the procedure must be finished after a finite number of steps say in m th step c v 2 ni vgen v 2 ni vgen gen f 2 ni c o 2 ni ogen k h thus we have the following result theorem 3 3 if all the arising assumptions a 1 a 2 hold the c algebra c v 2 ni f 2 ni can be included in a finite sequence of extensions 0 c o gen k h c v 2 ni f 2 ni c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni 0 4 deformation quantization and cyclic theories 27 0 c o 2 ni ogen gen k h c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni c 0 0 c o 2 ni ogen o 2 ni ogen gen k h c c k h 0 3 2 4 general remarks concerning computation of index c g we see that the general computation procedure of index c g is reduced to the case of short exact sequences of type 0 c y k h e c x k h 0 and the index is indexe kk x y the group kki x y can be mapped onto j z 2 homz ki j x ki j 1 y with kernel j z 2 ext 1 z ki j x ki j 1 y by the well known cap product see k 2 so 0 1 0 homz k 0 x k 1 y ext 0 x k 1 y 1 homz k 1 x k 0 y ext 1 x k 0 y suppose e 1 e 2 en 1 x to be generators and 1 2 n e the corresponding fredholm operators t 1 t 2 tn the fredholm operators representing the generators of k 1 y index y fred we have therefore 0 j cij indextj where 0 cij matrankk 0 x rankk 1 y z in the same way 1 can be computed 4 deformation quantization and cyclic theories let us finish this survey with some indication about some relations of the problem with some new developments recall that the group algebra of finite or compact groups are in fact some hopf bi algebras one deforms this hopf bialgebra structure to obtain the corresponding quantum groups our problem is therefore closely related with the interesting problem to describe these quantum groups one of the method is deformation quantization which is closely related with orbit method the others which are closely related with kk theory are the periodic cyclic co homologies we finish this survey by indication the subjects the author is working with 28 1 introduction 4 1 star products and star representations see gu and the references there 4 2 periodic cyclic homology see cu cq 1 cq 3 4 3 chern characters see for example cu pus 5 bibliographical remarks the material exposed in this introduction was the subject of the author for the talks at seminar on representation theory and gelfand s seminar on functional analysis in moscow university 1975 centre international des rencontres mathe matiques in luminy marseille 1983 seminar on group representation a l universite de paris vi et paris vii 1983 l universite de lyon 1983 international banach center 1988 seminar on c algebras at the iniversita t heidelberg the humboldt universita t zu berlin seminar sophus lie at the technische hochschule darmstadt 1993 and many conference talks the idea to create this book appeared during preparation of lectures at seminar sophus lie part 1 elementary theory an overview based on examples there are already fifteen years ago from the first moment of attacking the c algebra structure problem by using the k functors a general method is not yet constructed but there is a lot of accommulated results confirming the usefulness of the topological k theory invariant index c g we think therefore reasonable to propose an overview based on experimented exam ples of theses research works in this survey we intend to give a concrete reflection of the current research it is an introduction to a writing book on the subject 1 group c algebra structure let g be a locally compact group there exists a naturally normalized left invariant haar measure dg the space l 2 g dg of the square integrable module functions plays an impor tant role say in harmonic analysis studies first of all the spectral de composition of the regular representation of g in l 2 g dg into a direct integral or a sum of irreducible unitary g module the space l 1 g dg of functions with integrable module plays a crucial role following the non commutative fourier gel fand transformation l 1 g dg 7 g x x dx we have a one to one correspondence between the irreducible unitary g modules and the irreducible non degenerate modules over l 1 g so the general theorems of the spectral theory for g modules can be translated and proved in the corresponding theory for l 1 g which is more analytical then for which are applicable the strong results of functional analysis say the hahn banach theorem the banach principles of linear functional analysis however as involutive algebra l 1 g has its non regular norm i e in general a a l 1 g 6 a 2 l 1 g it is more useful to consider the corresponding regular norm c g c g sup g and take its completion c g ideally the spectral theory for unitary g modules is equivalent to the same one for the c g modules the last theory is closely related with subjects of functional analysis and its appli cations in the physical field theories and statistical mechanics so what is the structure of c g for a given g in general the problem rests open up to date this review outlines only that for the concrete examples the problem requires the tools of various nature from topology and analysis namely the k functors it is useful to add to c g the formal jointed unit element if there is no such one 31 2 the analytic method the first nontrivial example c sl 2 c was done by j m g fell in 1961 but until the moment the only groups the structure of whose c algebra was explicitly described are the abelian or compact groups and a few semi simple lie groups sl 2 r s l 2 r i e the universal covering group spin 4 1 and recently a family g p q of two step solvable lie groups see de fe 1 mi 1 km bm and wan 1 a fair amount is known about the c algebras of nilpotent lie groups see per including the heisenberg groups the c algebra of the euclidean motion group were studied by evans ev p green also proposed another analytic method for studying the c algebras of several solvable lie groups see gr so it is very interesting to characterize the group c algebras by topological invariants by another nature tools say by k functors such an idea was suggested by the author in d 1 d 2 3 k theory invariant index c g the very useful k functor for our approach is the operator kk functor of g g kasparov kas 1 gen eralizing the bdf k functor bdf 1 which characterizes the isomorphic classes of short exact sequences of c algebras we are trying to decompose our c algebras into some towers of ideals and step by step define the associated extensions by kk functors or their generalizations the resulting invariants form just our index this idea was proposed in d 1 and develop ed in d 2 for a large class of type i c algebras hence there are two general problems find out the c algebras which can be characterized by the well known k functors say by the operator k theory functors generalize the theory of k functors in such a way that they are ap plicable for a large class of c algebras 4 construction and reduction of index c g concerning the first problem we propose d 8 a general construction and some reduction procedure of the k theory invariant index c g of group c algebras using the orbit method ki d 4 d 7 we reduces index c g to a family of connes foliation c algebras indices index c v 2 ni f 2 ni see c 1 c 2 by a family of kk theory invariants using some generalization of the kasparov type condition treated by g g kasparov in the nilpotent lie group case kas 2 we reduces every index c v 2 ni f 2 ni to a family of kk theory invariants of the same type valuated in kk x y type groups the last ones are in some sense computable by using the cup cap product realizing the fredholm operator indices following this procedure we now describe the obtained experimental results concerning the structure of the c algebras of concrete groups 5 case by case examples we divide the examples into three classes following the complexity of computing indices a absorbing extensions the 32 first promising example was the group aff r of the affine transformations of the real straight line its group c algebra can be included in the short exact sequence 0 k h c aff r c s 1 s 1 0 where k h denotes the ideal of compact operators in a separable hilbert space because the extension is absorbing the structure of c aff r is just defined by the element index c aff r 1 1 z z ext s 1 s 1 kk s 1 s 1 pt here we need only the bdf k functor which is the source and the inspiring particular case of the kk functors see d 1 for the connected and simply connected group aff 0 r of affine transfor mations of the straight line the analogous results hold its c algebra can be included in the sort exact sequence 0 k h k h c aff 0 r c s 1 0 this absorbing extension and hence the isomorphic class of c aff 0 r can be characterized by the topological invariant index c aff 0 r 1 1 kk s 1 pt pt the c algebra of the group aff c of the affine transformations of the complex straight line is included in the short exact sequence 0 k h c aff c c x where x is the one point compactification of the so called hawaiian neck lace z c z 2 n 2 n n 1 2 hence the isomorphism class of c aff c is characterized by the topolog ical invariant index c aff c 1 1 kk x pt z z see ros 1 our method is applied also to the group aff k of affine transformations of any non discrete totally disconnected locally compact field k its c algebra can be included in the short exact sequence 0 k h c aff k c x 0 now x is the one point compactification of s 1 h where h is the multi plicative group of the elements of k with absolute values 1 h is its dual iso morphic to a countably infinite and discrete set the c algebra c affk is characterized by the topological invariant index c affk 1 1 kk x pt ext x zh 33 see ros 1 in all these examples the index index c g take values in the bdf k groups ext x which are isomorphic to homz 1 x z given by the fredholm index map where 1 x x s 1 is the cohomotopy group the group homz 1 x z is product of count ably many copies of z one for each generator of 1 x the index is then given by a sequence of integers namely the fredholm indices of the im age under the infinite dimensional representations of a sequence of elements from c g mapping into the generators of 1 x these sequences of el ements from the group c algebra c g and their fredholm indices are defined and calculated firstly by the author for aff r in d 1 then by j rosenberg for aff c and affk in ros 1 the c algebra of the universal covering a ff c c c of the group aff c c 0 c can be included in the short exact sequence 0 c s 1 k h c a ff c c s 2 0 and the structure of c a ff c is uniquely defined by the index indexc a ff c 1 kk s 2 s 1 ext c s 2 c s 1 z b non absorbing extensions the first example which requires essentially the kk theory but not enough the ext functor bdf k theory arisen as a class of two step solv able lie groups r 0 r m considered by j rosenberg ros 1 and then g p q r rp q considered by x wang wan 1 including the heisen berg group h 2 n 1 considered before by g g kasparov kas 1 kas 2 but in these examples we obtain the non absorbing exact sequences and then the topological invariant indexc g does not define the isomorphic classes of c algebras let us describe the results in more detailed form the c algebras of the say elliptic semi simple product r rm m is any positive integer where the action of r on rm have roots with the real part of the same sign are isomorphic each to another and can be included in the short exact sequences of type 0 c sm 1 k h c r rm c s 1 0 hence we have but not describe by the topological invariant index c r rm kk sm 1 s 1 of the group c algebras 34 the c algebra of heisenberg group h 2 n 1 can be included in the short but not absorbing exact sequence 0 c s 1 s 1 k h c h 2 n 1 c s 2 n 0 hence the index index c h 2 n 1 1 1 n kk s 2 n s 1 s 1 z z this result has been generalized to the general case of connected and simply connected lie groups the group c algebras in these cases can be included in the exact sequences of type 0 c x k h c g c g r 0 if the union of the co adjoint g orbits of maximal dimension is the com plement to the annihilator of lie in g r where the set of all the co adjoint orbits of maximal dimension is denoted by x see kas 2 so the c algebra c g admits the topological invariant index c g 1 1 n 2 where n is the half dimension of the co adjoint orbits of maxi mal dimension c non absorbing extension associated with towers of c ideals there are only a finite number of non isomorphic c algebras between the group c algebras of the 3 dimensional real solvable lie groups these c algebras are easily characterized all but the subclass g 3 2 0 the c algebras of which are isomorphic one to other and are included into the short exact but non absorbing sequences 1 0 c s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 k h c g 3 2 a 1 0 0 c 4 k h a 1 c s 1 0 hence index c g 3 2 1 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 kk a 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 homz z 3 z 4 and 2 1 1 1 1 kk s 1 4 pt z 4 it is very interesting to consider the following class md resp md of connected and simply connected solvable lie groups all the co adjoint orbit of which have maximal dimension or zero resp equal to the dimension of the groups or zero it is easy to see sov that the only non commutative groups in the class md are the groups of affine transformations of the real or complex straight line 35 all the c algebras of the groups in class md are characterized up to isomorphism by the topological invariant index c g index c aff 0 r 1 1 kk s 1 2 pt z z index c a ff c 1 kk s 2 s 1 z the md groups are not yet classified but the subclass md 4 of four dimensional solvable md groups is completely listed including the real diamond group r h 3 see vi 1 vi 2 there are 13 concrete connected and simply connected md 4 groups or series of such ones with exact descrip tion of commutator relations all the c algebras of these md 4 groups can be described by the direct analytic method but only three cases of groups g the lie algebra of which is lie g t x y z x y z and adt cos sin 0 sin cos 0 0 0 the euclidean motion group g adt 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 the harmonic oscillator r j h 3 adt 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 the real diamond group r h 3 the c algebra c g can be included in the short exact sequences 1 0 c v f c g c s 1 0 2 0 c s 2 s 2 k h c v f c s 1 k h 0 and is characterized by the index index c g 1 2 1 kk c

index index c r j h 3 1 2 1 kk c s 1 c vr jh 3 f 2 1 1 kk s 1 s 2 z z 36 the c algebra of the real diamond group r h 3 can be included in three exact sequences 1 0 c s 2 s 2 k h c r h 3 a 1 0 2 0 c s

kk c s 1 c 4 homz z z 4 so the description of md 4 group c algebras is achieved one can hope to describe the c algebras of the whole class md by the same method the question rests open update finally the c algebras of the hyperbolic semi direct product r rp q g p q with p negative roots 1 p and q positive roots p 1 p q can be included in two short exact sequences 0 c u f c g p q c s 1 0 where u is the one point compactification of rp q 0 and 0 c u 1 f c u f c sp sq r 0 where u 1 r p q rp rq so the c algebra c g p q admits the topological invariant index c g p q valuated in the kasparov groups kk c s 1 c u f and kk c sp sq r in all these examples the invariant index c g is a sequence of type 0 1 homomorphisms in the six term exact sequences of k groups they are in general expressed by using intersection cup cap products only for the examples in subsection a one can use analytic method of calculating the fredholm index so it is easy to see that we must develop the theory of k functors admitting some intersection products in the next four chapters we shall expose these cases in detail we hope that after reading this part the beginner can already work in these problems more or less productively chapter 2 classification of md groups 1 definitions first of all we recall the notion of k action let us denote by g a connected and simply connected lie group g teg its lie algebra as the tangent space at the neutral element e it is easy to see that to each element g g one can associate a map a g g g by the conjugacy in fixing the identity element e g therefore the corresponding tangent map a g g g x g 7 d dt t 0 g exp tx g 1 g it is easy to see that this really defines an action denoted as usually by ad of group g in its lie algebra g one defines therefore an so called co adjoint action of group g in the dual vector space g by the formula k g f x f ad g 1 x for all f g x g and g g it is easy to check that this defines a real action of g on g definition 1 1 the orbits of this action are called the co adjoint or bits or k orbit as an easy consequence one deduce that the dual space g is decomposed into a disconnected sum of the k orbit definition 1 2 we say that a real lie algebra g is in the class md if every k orbit is of dimension equal 0 or dim g this means that the structure of the orbit space of such a lie algebra must be rather simple there is only two strata of orbits and the union of the maximal dimension is dense in the whole space g the other evident consequence is the fact that the dimension dim g dimg must be an even number 37 38 2 classification of md groups recall that in each k orbit there is a natural differential form associated with the bilinear form bf x y f x y x y g it is not hard to verify the following assertion claim 1 1 the kernel of this bilinear form is just the lie algebra gf liegf of the stabilizer gf of the point f g under the co adjoint action proof for a connected lie group every element can be obtained as some product of elements from the image of the exponential map exp g g we can therefore restrict to the case of element of type exp x x g for the elements of this kind it is enough to remember a formula from the lie theory ad expx exp adx this means that the form bf is invariant under the action of the stabilizer group gf of the k orbit passing through f one can therefore translate this form to other points in order to have a differential form on the k orbit f g gf passing through f definition 1 3 the corresponding symplectic form is called kirillov form on k orbits 2 md criteria let us denote by g 1 g g the commutator of the lie algebra proposition 2 1 if f g g 1 i e if f is a functional on g which is non vanishing on g 1 then the k orbit f passing through f is of maximal dimension dim f dimg moreover g 1 is commutative proof we prove this proposition by contradiction argument assume that f is some functional on g which is non vanishing on the commutator g 1 g g but dim f 6 dim g i e dim f 0 this means that dimgf dimg dim f dim g hence gf g i e kerbf g this contradicts the assumptions hence dim f dim g dimg now we prove that g 1 is commutative denote by g 2 the second derived ideal g 2 g 1 g 1 because g is solvable dim g 2 dim g 1 hence there exists a nonzero functional f g 1 vanishing on g 2 this means that g 2 gf 0 what mean that g 1 is commutative 3 classification theorem 39 proposition 2 2 md criterion lie algebra g is of class md if and only if adx g x g g 1 0 6 x g proof consider g of class md following the previous proposition for every element f g g 1 we have dim f dim g and gf kerbf 0 suppose that there exists some element x g x 6 0 and x g 6 g 1 there exists hence an element f g vanishes in g 1 and doesn t vanish on x g this means that 0 6 x kerbf 0 this contradiction proves that x g g 1 conversely suppose that for every x 6 0 x g g 1 if f g vanishes on g 1 we have kerbf g in this case gf g dimgf dim g dim f 0 if f g doesn t vanish on g 1 we have x g g 1 x 6 0 kerbf 0 and hence dim f dim g 3 classification theorem let us denote ad 1 y ady g 1 lemma 3 1 if g is of class md the operators of type ad 1 y y g are pairwise commuting proof we have the well known jacobi identity x y z y z x z x y 0 x y z g in particular if z is in the commutative derived ideal g 1 then z x y 0 and we have adx ady ady adx z 0 x y g z g 1 recall that the lie algebra of affine transformations of the real straight line is described as follows the lie group aff r of affine transformations of the real straight line is the group of affine transformations of type x r 7 ax b for some parameters a b r and a 6 0 for this reason some time one refers this group by ax b group it is easy to prove that aff r a b 1 0 a b r a 6 0 40 2 classification of md groups it is easy to see that its lie algebra aff r lieaff r is aff r 0 0 r by an easy direct calculation it is easy also to see that the lie algebra aff r is generated by two generators with the only nontrivial lie brackets x y y i e aff r ax by x y y a b r now let us consider the group aff c of complex affine transformations of the complex straight line the most easy method is to consider x y as complex generators x x 1 ix 2 and y y 1 iy 2 then from the relation x y y we get x 1 ix 2 y 1 iy 2 y 1 iy 2 this means that x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 i x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 y 1 iy 2 this means that the lie algebra aff c of affine transformations of the com plex straight line is a real 4 dimensional lie algebra having 4 generators with the only nonzero lie brackets x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 y 1 x 2 y 1 x 1 y 2 y 2 later in the proof of the theorem of classification what follows we shall choose another basis noted also by the same letters to have more clear lie brackets of this lie algebra x 1 y 1 y 1 x 1 y 2 y 2 x 2 y 1 y 2 x 2 y 2 y 1 theorem 3 1 up to isomorphism every algebra of class md is one of the following commutative lie algebra lie algebra aff r of affine transformations of the real straight line lie algebra aff c of affine transformations of the complex straight line proof step 1 claim 3 1 there are only two possibilities dim g 1 either 1 or 2 consider the representation ad 1 of lie algebra g in g 1 the criterion md is just the irreducibility of this representation in other hand the operators ad 1 y commute one with others there is therefore an invariant complex line d in the complexification g 1 c g 1 r c for all operators ad 1 y y g there are two cases 3 classification theorem 41 d coincide with its complex conjugation d in this case d r c where g 1 is a real line invariant under all the operators ad 1 y y g d 6 d in this case we have d d r c where is some real 2 dimensional plane invariant under all the operators ad 1 y y g in both the cases we have g 1 in virtue of the irreducibility of the representation ad 1 we do some remarks remark 3 1 in the first case the existence of one dimensional real line invariant under all the operators ad 1 y y g deduces that dim g 1 1 remark 3 2 if z 1 g 1 z 2 g 1 0 for some z 1 z 2 g then z 1 z 2 0 really following jacobi identities we have z 1 z 2 g z 2 g z 1 g z 1 z 2 0 the last two summands are 0 then z 1 z 2 g 0 following the md criterion we have z 1 z 2 0 step 2 case 1 dim g 1 1 choose some y 6 0 in g 1 following the md criterion ady g g 1 is an surjection then there exists some x g such that ady x y i e x y y we show that ker ady g 1 following the remark 3 2 ker ady is commutative if ker ady 6 g 1 then there exists x 1 ker ady but x 1 is not in g 1 because x 1 x g 1 we have x 1 x y for some r then x 1 y g 0 from the md criterion we deduces that x 1 y 0 what contradicts to the assumption that ker ady 6 0 thus the lie algebra has two generatorsx y with the only nonzero relation x y y i e g aff r case 2 dim g 1 2 suppose that g g 1 l for some l with diml 2 consider the operator adx l g 1 x g 1 because diml dim g 1 there exists y l y 6 0 such that adx y 0 we shall prove that y g 1 0 indeed if y g 1 6 0 x must be the unique 0 vector of the operator ad 1 y because the operators ad 1 y commute one with another rx become an invariant space for all ad 1 t t g 1 following remark 3 1 dim g 1 1 this contradiction prove that y g 1 0 if the co dimension of ry in l stills 42 2 classification of md groups bigger than 2 there exists a vector z in its the complement such that z g 1 0 we continue this procedure until the case where diml 2 in this case l l 1 l 2 such that diml 1 2 and l 2 g 1 0 following remark 3 2 l 2 must be commutative if l 2 6 0 then diml 2 2 because the k orbit have even dimension consider the surjective map ady g g 1 l 2 l 1 g 1 if y g 1 l 2 we have y g 1 l 2 0 therefore the operator ady l 1 g 1 is a surjection for all y g 1 l 2 0 because diml 1 dim g 1 2 the operator ady is an isomorphism we have a linear map g 1 l 2 0 iso l 1 g 1 moreover following md criterion this is an injective map this is a con tradiction thus l 2 0 g g 1 l where dim g 1 diml 2 suppose that y 1 y 2 provide a basis of g 1 because adyi l g 1 is surjective there exists some x 1 l such that x 1 y 1 y 1 i e ad 1 x 1 y 1 y 1 following remark 3 1 y 1 can not be the unique eigen vector up to a scalar multiple with eigenvalue 1 of the operator ad 1 x 1 thus ad 1 x 1 id consider epimorphism adx 1 g g 1 we have dimker adx 1 2 thus there exists x 2 such that x 1 x 2 0 and x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 form a basis of g because ad 1 x 1 id ad 1 x 2 can not have an eigenvector following md criterion change basis in fraktg 1 we have ad 1 x 2 a b b a for some a b r b 6 0 choose x 2 1 b x 2 ax 1 we have ad 1 x 2 0 1 1 0 thus lie algebra g is isomorphic to to an algebra generated by a basis x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 with the following only nonzero brackets x 1 y 1 y 1 x 1 y 2 y 2 x 2 y 1 y 2 x 2 y 2 y 1 this means that lie algebra g is isomorphic to aff c 4 bibliographical remarks 43 remark 3 3 this theorem let us to restrict our consideration for the class md practically to lie algebras of affine transformations of the real or complex straight lines and the corresponding lie groups the lie group aff r of all the transformations of the real straight line the universal covering a ff r which is just isomorphic to the connected component aff 0 r of the identity element the lie group of complex affine transformations of the complex straight line and its universal covering a ff c which is isomorphic to the connected component of identity aff 0 r 4 bibliographical remarks the main idea to classify of this class of lie algebra md belongs to the author of this book he posed this problem for his postgraduate student h h viet and a young colleague v m son and solved together with them the solution of this question was published in j operator theory sov professor p cartier during his scientific trip in hanoi helped them to shortcut the long proof 44 2 classification of md groups chapter 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups 1 the c algebra of aff r 1 1 statement of theorems let us denote by g the group of affine transformations of the real straight line we want to study the structure of this group and its c algebra c aff r to do this we need first known its dual object i e all its unitary representations up to unitary equivalence theorem 1 1 see gn each irreducible unitary representation of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line up to unitary equiv alence belongs to the following list of nonequivalent irreducible unitary rep resentations a the representation s realized in th space l 2 r dx x where r r 0 and the action is given by the formula sgf x e 1 bxf ax where g b 0 1 b the representations u realized in c 1 and is given by the formula u g 1 sgn where r 0 1 proof see gn and section 1 2 below this list of irreducible unitary representations give us also the corre sponding list of irreducible non degenerate representations of the corre sponding group c algebra c g the next deal is to study the structure of this group c algebra in d 1 the author proved that this group c algebra c g can be considered as some extension of the c algebra of continuous functions on a compact by the elementary c algebra of com pact operators in a separable hilbert space theorem 1 2 the c algebra with a formally jointed unity element c g can be included in a short exact sequence of c algebras and homomorphisms 0 k c g c s 1 s 1 0 45 46 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups this means that the c algebra c g following bdf theory is uniquely determined up to isomorphisms class by an element said to be its the index and is denoted by indexc g proof d 1 and section 1 3 below the infinite irreducible unitary representation s realizes the indicated inclusion because ext s 1 s 1 homz 1 s 1 s 1 it provides a homomorphism from 1 s 1 s 1 to c in virtue of the fact that the homomorphism y ext s 1 s 1 homz 1 s 1 s 1 z 1 is obtained by computing of indices fredholm operators and the general type of elements of 1 s 1 s 1 is gk l g 0 1 k g 1 0 l k l z we have ind gk l k ind t g 1 0 l ind t g 0 1 where t is a isomorphism corresponding to s hence we need only to compute a pair of indices ind t g 1 0 and ind t g 0 1 these indices can be computed directly by the methods of computing the indices of fredholm operators we obtained the following exact computed results theorem 1 3 indexc g 1 1 ext s 1 s 1 z z proof d 1 and section 1 4 below these results give us an interesting improvement for a question of a a kirillov raised in the i m gelfand s seminar at the moscow uni versity in 1974 the the extension of the c algebra c g of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line is split this example does also spirit to apply the k functors to some more general group c algebras this was also a reason conducting g g kasparov to create his beautiful general kk functors returning to the general question we need first of all some prepara tion on construction of all the irreducible unitary representations of groups in the advanced theory we shall do this by the construction of the mul tidimensional orbit method secondly we shall propose some methods to decompose the group c algebras into some repeated short exact sequences of c algebras and finally we shall propose some methods to reduces the indices to some computable cases by using the general atiyah hirzebruch singer index formula for elliptic operators on topological spaces this pro gram shall be done in the second part of this book 1 the c algebra of aff r 47 1 2 proof of theorem 1 1 theorem 1 1 was well known as the first result about infinite dimensional unitary representations after what the fruitful theory was well developed in this first pioneer work i m gel fand and m a naimark have proved the theorem using only the classical analysis and functional analysis now the day we have enough strong tools to prove it shorter and more clear for example the method of small subgroups of g w mackey mac or the orbit method said in this book it is easy to see that aff r r r is the well known semi direct product of r r 0 and r we use therefore the mackey method of small subgroups for the commutative normal subgroup n r the dual object n r of n r consists of characters r defined by the formula n exp i n n n for each fixed the group aff r acts on the dual object n r following the formula g n gng 1 an n where g a b aff r we have therefore g a hence in n r there are only two orbits 0 and r 0 following the mackey theory of induction from small subgroups the orbit 0 has the stabilizer subgroup coincided with the whole group aff r the characters of this stabilizer are in a 1 1 correspondence with elements of the dual object r r 0 i e the unitary representations u 0 1 r on the orbit r 0 choose a fixed point 1 i e with 1 the stabilizer of the fixed point 1 is g 1 n r hence following the mackey theory the orbit r 0 corresponds to a unique representation indgn 1 following the induction rule indgn a b f x exp ibx f xa realized in the space l 2 x d x x with x n g r 0 and d x dx x as the quasi invariant measure on the corresponding orbit it is easy to see that this representation is exactly the representation s in the statement of the theorem following the mackey theory this list is the complete list of all irreducible unitary representations of the group the theorem is therefore proved 48 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups 1 3 proof of theorem 1 2 as usually we add to the group c algebras the formally jointed unity element it is easy to see that the representation s is an exact representation i e kers 0 because our group is a type i group i e the group c algebra is gcr in c g there is an ideal isomorphic to the ideal k h of compact operators where h l 2 r dx x lemma 1 1 consider l 1 aff r dadb a the conditions what follow are equivalent 1 keru 2 a b db 0 a e w r t the measure da a proof suppose a a b db the function shall be de composed into the sum of the even part 1 and the odd part 2 we have keru 0 a b a i sgn a a da a 0 0 a a i sgn a a da a 0 because 1 is even and 2 is odd the above assertion is equivalent to the two condition what follow 0 a a i 2 a da a 0 r

an equivalent condition a 0 a e w r t da a 1 the c algebra of aff r 49 lemma 1 2 assume l 1 aff r dadb a satisfies the condition a b db 0 a e on r 0 w r t da a then s is a compact operator where s in th single irreducible unitary representation of the group aff r proof in gn was proved separately but we can deduce this lemma also from our compactness criteria in the advanced part to avoid some repetition we omit this proof here lemma 1 3 the infinite dimensional representation s provides n iso morphism of c algebras keru k h proof 1 first of all we must show that the representation s is an exact representation i e in c g kers 0 indeed following the results of j m fell 47 every representation u is weakly contained in the representation s in the topology of the dual object a ff r this means that if s 0 then u 0 0 1 r hence sup g 0 i e c g 0 we have from here 0 2 following the previous lemmas we have an inclusion s keru v k h because k h is an elementary c algebra see j dixmier 37 one rests to show that s keru is a two sided closed ideal in k h assume thatk s keru and a k h is an arbitrary element because the group is of type i following the dixmier glimme sakai theorem the image s c g contain at least one compact operator there exists therefore an element c g such that a s following the assumption there exists k s 1 where 1 keru 50 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups we have in this case a k s s 1 s 1 k a s 1 s s 1 because u 1 u u 1 0 0 1 r we have 1 keru hence a k s 1 s keru y analogy we also have k a s keru thus s keru k h 1 3 1 end of proof of theorem 1 2 because the representation s is exact then we can identify th ideal keru with its image s keru k h we show that the quotient c algebra c g k h is commutative indeed because the representations u are all of dimension 1 then u u u u u 0 0 1 r one deduce that keru i e the quotient c algebra c g k h is a commutative c algebra one shows that the maximal ideals of the quotient c algebra are just the ideals obtained from one deduce that keru i e the quotient c algebra c g k h is a commutative c algebra one shows that the maximal ideals of the quotient c algebra are just the 1 the c algebra of aff r 51 ideals obtained from the corresponding ideals which contain the ideal k h it is easy to see from here that c aff r k h c s 1 s 1 in other words we have the exact sequence in the theorem 1 2 0 k h c aff r c s 1 s 1 0 1 4 proof of theorem 1 3 it is well known that ext s 1 s 1 homz k 1 s 1 s 1 z because of k 1 s 1 s 1 z z we have homz k 1 s 1 z 1 z z z and so ext s 1 s 1 z z we must prove that the c algebra of the group of affine transformations of the real straight line corresponds to the pair 1 1 in z z the proof is rather long and we must divide it in a sequence of steps first of all we must find out the generators of the group ext s 1 s 1 z z remark that we added to the c algebra the formal unity element is equivalent to consideration the one point compactification of its dual object certainly that the one point compactification of a pair of parallel real straight lines is just s 1 s 1 this means that we can enumerate the points of s 1 s 1 by the pairs of numbers 0 1 r i e x s 1 s 1 r 0 1 from definition 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 c z z where c c 0 and denote the homotopy class of maps more precisely with each pair of integers k l z z we can choose a map gk l as follows gk l exp k i 2 arcctg 2 if 0 r exp k i 2 arcctg 2 if 1 r 1 if then the homotopy classes gk l provide a group which is equivalent with z z with two generators g 0 1 and g 1 0 gk l g 0 1 k g 1 0 l 52 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups recall that for an arbitrary compact x we have an exact sequence 0 extz k 0 x z ext x y hom k 1 x z 0 moreover if x c and dimx 1 then the homomorphism y is an iso morphism see l g brown r g douglas and p a fillmore 7 because x c k 1 x x gl 1 c x c 1 x assume to be an arbitrary extension i e is an inclusion c x a h the the invertible elements g c x must be mapped into invertible elements g in calkin algebra a h hence g is defined by an unique fredholm operator up to compact operator perturbations moreover the index ind g depends only on the homotopy class of map g c x then to our extension corresponds a homomorphism ind in homz 1 x z with x s 1 s 1 we have ind gk l k ind g 0 1 l ind g 1 0 the irreducible infinite dimensional unitary representation s of the group aff r gives us an extension of type 0 k h c aff r u c s 1 s 1 0 following bdf theory to him corresponds an unique homomorphism of type c s 1 s 1 a h remark that if c aff

satisfying all the necessary conditions following the program of computing indices one rests to compute the indices of fredholm operators inds i i 1 2 1 the c algebra of aff r 55 firstly we write out the explicit action formula of the operators s i i 1 2 from definition we have s i f x 2 exp ibx b 2 2 db 0 a 1 f xa a 2 sgn a i 1 da a 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa a sgn a i 1 da hence we deduce the exact action formulas s i f x f x exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa a sgn a i 1 da thus in order to compute the indices of these fredholm operators we consider the differential equations f x exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa a da 0 1 f x exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa ada 0 2 lemma 1 8 each solution of the equation 1 must be an even func tion and each solution of the equation 2 must be an odd function on the symmetric domain r 0 if exist proof suppose f to be a solution of the equation 1 because the domain is symmetric we can decompose it into the sum f f 1 f 2 of its even part f 1 f f 2 and its odd part f 2 f f 2 where f x f x x r then for a fixed x 1 1 f 2 xa a da 0 then following the equation 1 f x exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa a da exp x 2 2 1 1 f 1 xa a da exp x 2 2 1 1 f 1 xa a da f x 56 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups the second part is proved by the same way from this lemma we can reduce our study of solutions of equations 1 and 2 on the domain 0 x the if necessary extend them following symmetry on the whole domain r r 0 lemma 1 9 in the hilbert space l 2 r dx x we have dimkers i 1 i 1 2 proof this lemma is proved by reducing to some differential equation and then estimate the asymptotic behavior of solutions for positive values of x the equations 1 and 2 have the same form f x exp x 2 2 1 0 f xa ada 0 it is the same as 3 f x 4 exp x 2 2 x 2 x 0 f d put f x x 0 f d we have an differential equation for f x 4 f x 4 exp x 2 2 x f x 0 certainly here we consider the generalized sobolev derivatives for some fixed value x 0 in the domain 0 x 0 we define a unique solution f x of the cauchy problem and the function f can be computed as f x f x x the rest id to decide whether the function f belongs to the hilbert space l 2 r dx x to do this we study its asymptotic behavior when x 0 and when x so assume f x to be a solution of the differential equation 4 and f x f x x then x 2 f x 4 exp x 2 2 x 0 f d 0 1 the c algebra of aff r 57 or the same x 2 exp x 2 2 f x 4 x 0 f d x 2 exp x 2 2 f x 4 f x x x 2 exp x 2 2 f

follows x 2 exp x 2 2 f x ec 1 if x x 4 ec 2 if x 0 f x x 2 exp x 2 2 if x x 2 if x 0 we conclude that the solutions are square integrable with respect to the measure dx x on r r 0 lemma 1 10 the image of l 2 r dx x under the maps s i are dense in itself i e dimcoker s i 0 i 1 2 proof 1 assume g x is an even function then the solutions of the equation s 1 f x f x 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa a da g x are also even functions indeed we decompose the function f into the sum of its even part f 1 and odd part f 2 we have 1 1 f 2 xa a da 0 and by this reason f x 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 f 1 xa a da g x 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 f 1 xa a da g x f x 2 an analogous assertion is valid for 2 58 3 the structure of c algebras of md groups assume g x to be an odd function then the solutions of the equation s 2 f x f x 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 f 1 xa ada g x are also odd functions 3 assume g x is an arbitrary function with compact support on r r 0 in other words there exists some number n big enough such that g x 0 x x 1 n or x n we shall show that the equations 1 s 1 f x g x and 2 s 2 f x g x always have solutions in l 2 r dx x assume g g 1 g 2 is the decomposition of g into the sum of its even and odd parts then because g 2 is odd 1 1 g 2 xa a da 0 hence g 2 x 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 g 2 xa a da g 2 x we try to find the solutions of 1 in form f f g 2 where f x 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 f xa a da g 1 x following 1 f must be an odd function we have f x 4 exp x 2 2 1 0 f xa ada g 1 x 0 if x 1 n or x n thus outside the interval 1 n n f x must be an even solution of the equation 1 and have the following asymptotic behavior f x 1 x 2 exp x 2 2 when x x 2 when x 0 2 the structure of c a ff c 59 because g has compact support g has also compact support and there fore the even and odd parts g 1 g g 2 and g 2 g g 2 have also the compact supports hence f x f g 2 l 2 r dx x by analogy we can always solve the equations s 2 f x g x where g x has compact support the proof of the theorem 1 3 is therefore also accomplished 2 the structure of c a ff

the dual vector space g of its lie algebra g k g f x f ad g 1 for all x g and f g where is the pairing between g and g it is easy to see that the stabilizer gf of a fixed point f f g f is a closed subgroup and the tangent space to the orbit at this point can be identified with the quotient space g gf where gf liegf is the lie algebra of the stabilizer gf the kirillov form f x y define a non degenerate bilinear form bf on the tangent space tf the right translations define an action of g on the orbit f and transpose the kirillov bilinear form bf providing a right invariant differential form f on the orbit f passing through f and finally each k orbit is of even dimension 71 72 4 classification of md 4 groups definition 1 1 we say that a solvable lie group g belongs to the class md

change the basis x y z t to the basis x y z t x x az y y bz z z t t then we also have the same commutation relation of the heisenberg algebra h 3 x y z x z y z 0 and in the basis x y z of g 1 adt a 11

and the action of t on h 3 is defined by the matrix adt 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 this means that g g 4 4 2 if a 11 then we use the following basis change x a 12 x 2 a 11 y y 2 a 11 a 21 y z 4 a 211 z t 1 t we have the same result as in the previous case thus g g 4 4 2 remark 2 1 following part i of proposition 2 1 and theorem 2 1 if g is an md 4 algebra then it should be r 4 or decomposed as g rn g for

cases this should give us adequate informations about th structure of group c algebras we recall first of all the background from connes theory of measurable foliations we show later that the generic co adjoint orbits provide connes measurable foliations and finally we consider topological classification of these foliations 4 1 measurable foliations after a connes let us recall that a integrable tangent distribution is by definition a smooth sub fibration f of the tangent bundle tv of a smooth manifold v such that each point x v can be included in a smooth sub manifold w v which recognizes f tw as its tangent bundle i e the fiber fx at x is coincided with the tangent space txw for all x w the manifold w in this case is called the integral manifold of f recall also the frobenius criteria of integrability proposition 4 1 a connes c 1 the following conditions are equiv alent i the tangent distribution f is integrable on v ii for all x v there exists an open sub manifold u in v containing x and a submersion p u rq q codimf dimv dimf such that fy ker p y y w iii c f s c tv sx fx x v is a lie subalgebra of smooth vector fields iv the ideal i f of differential forms vanishing on f is stable under the operation of exterior differentiation d this deduces in particular that all the 1 dimensional tangent distribu tions are integrable a manifold v equipped with an integrable tangent distribution f is called a foliation or a foliated manifold denoted by v f each maximal connected integral sub manifold l of f is called a leaf of the foliation v f it is reasonable to recall see for example a connes c 1 that i the family of all leaves of a foliation f on v form a partition of v ii for each point x v there exists a coordinate neighborhood u x 1 xn n dim v such that if a fiber l intersects with this neighborhood l u 6 each connected component of l u which is called a plaque is given by the following equations xk 1 c 1 xn cn k n dimf where c 1 cn k are some constants depending on the plaque 94 4 classification of md 4 groups the atlas of this kind coordinate charts is called an atlas of foliated manifold conversely one can use these last two properties to defines a larger class of foliations see i tamura tam ch 4 pp 121 126 one consider a family c of sub manifolds satisfying two conditions and for each fiber l c there exists a single integrable distribution f such that l is its maximal connected integral sub manifold of f then we have also a foliations remark that locally all foliations of a fixed dimension have the same local structure but globally they are quite different e g compactness of leaves existence of dense leaves the space of leaves v f definition 4 1 two foliations v 1 1 and v 2 f 2 are called topolog ically equivalent if there exists a leaf wise homeomorphism h v 1 f 1 v 2 f 2 recall that a sub manifold n of the foliated manifold v f is called transversal if at each point p v we can split tpv as the direct sum tpv fp tpn for all p n certainly that in this case dimn codimf in a small neighborhood u x 1 xn there is a 1 1 correspondence between the plaques and the point of u n if for a borel set b the set u b is countable the transversal set b is called borel transversal it was proved in c 1 that there exists an injection b n where n is a transversal sub manifold such that x lx the leaf containing x definition 4 2 a additive measure b 7 b from the set of borel transversals to the set 0 is called a transversal measure if 1 borel equivalence the measure is invariant w r t borel bijec tions b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 2 k if k is a compact subset of a transversal sub manifold a foliation v f equipped with a transversal measure is called a measur able foliation let us recall finally some relation between the transversal measure and the ordinary measure for oriented foliations we can deduce a more clear relationship between the transversal measures and the ordinary measure on foliated manifolds choose an orientation of f then the fiber bundle kf k dimf is decomposed into two parts kf and kf by the zero section fix a k vector field x c kf and a measure on the foliated manifold v f if u is some local coordinate cart of the foliation then u can be identified with the direct product n of some transversal sub manifold n and a typical fiber thus the restriction u is separated into the product of measures n on n and on denote x the measure along leaves defined by the volume element x the measure is x invariant iff x and are proportional for all coordinate cart of foliation two pairs x 4 measurable md 4 foliation 95 and y are said to be equivalent iff there exists a function c v such that y x and proposition 4 2 a connes c 1 if v f is an oriented foliated manifold there is a bijective correspondence between equivalent classes of pairs x and the transversal measures the transversal measure corresponding to the pair x is just given by the formula b n card b n d n for all transversal borel set b in u and is continued to other borel set by additivity we conclude that in order to describe some foliation as a measurable foliation we need to pick out a suitable pair x 4 2 measurable md 4 foliations

foliations v f and v f are of one topological type then the corresponding c algebras are isomor phic c v f c v f let us recall that cross product a g of a group g with a c algebra a is just the c hull of the involutive algebra of functions with compact support on g with values in a endowed with the convolution product a b g g a g 1 g 1 b gg 1 1 dg 1 a b l 1 g a g g and the involution a g g a g 1 a l 1 g a where dg is the right invariant haar measure on g and g auta is a representation of g i e the map g a a g x 7 g x is continuous in norm it is easy to see that if f a a is a g equivariant c

2 if v is a satured open sub manifold of the foliated manifold v f and f f v then c v f is an ideal in c v f remark that in this case the groupoid h h is closed in h but in general it is different from the groupoid of the foliation v v f v v nevertheless we can also define the representation x x v v of the algebra c c h h 1 2 in l 2 hx h x 1 2 the c hull of it is a c algebra denoted by c v v f v v the inclusion h h h gives us a homomorphism c c h 1 2 c c h h 1 2 which can be extended to a epimorphism c v f c v v f v v 0 we have thus a short sequence 0 c v f c v f c v v f v v 0 which is exact at all terms but perhaps is not in the middle term c v f proposition 1 8 tor lemma 2 2 1 if the foliation v f is given by an action of an amenable lie group g such that h h v v g then the

this should be very useful in computing connecting homomorphisms in many cases it is easy to see that if the foliation v f is given by an action of some commutative lie group rn in such a way that its

m v and the orbits of g therein two points m v and m v are on the same g orbit if and only if there exists an element g g such that m mg 1 v gv the space of all orbits of g in m v is the space m g v defined above 2 if the quotient mapm m g is a fibration moreover a principal bundle then v ev m g is the so called vector bundle associated with the g action on v it is easy to see that there exists a bijection between the sections of this bundle and the v valued functions on m satisfying the following equations f mg g 1 f m 121 122 6 multidimensional quantization for all m m and g g 3 we shall often apply the construction of product over g to the left spaces for this it is enough to remark that if m is a left g space then it is also a right g space by the action g 1 m g g in this case ev m v and by definition m v m v iff m gm v gv the sections s ev of the associate bundle v ev g m can be identified with the v valued functions on m satisfying the equations fs gm gfs m g g m m 4 we shall use the construction to the case of induced representations definition 1 2 let g be a locally compact group h a closed sub group and v a unitary representation of h the left g action on the space ev of sections of the associate g bundle v ev h g will be called the representation of g induced from the unitary representa tion v of h it is denoted by indgh v remark 1 2 1 it is easy to see that g is a left h space and that h g h g is a fibration we shall always suppose that there is a borel section s h g g x 7 sx such that the decomposition g h sx is unique it is easy to see that for every x x h g and every g g there exists a unique h h g x such that sx g h g x sxg and h g 1 x h g 2 xg 1 h g 1 g 2 x for all x x and g 1 g 2 g we have therefore a h valued 1 cocycle h 2 the 1 cocycle h acts on the fiber v and g acts on h g by the right translations together we have therefore a left g action on the sections of the associate bundle ev g s x h g x s xg g g x x 3 we always suppose that h g h g is a locally trivial principal h bundle and fix a trivialization on it it is easy to see that on the associated bundle ev there is a natural associated affine connection 4 it is also easy to see that on the right g space x h g there exists a unique up to scalar factor quasi invariant measure d d s depending on the borel section s let b be the 1 cocycle defined by b g x d xg d x 1 2 h g x 1 induced representations mackey method of small subgroups 123 then the corresponding induced representation indgh b is unitary iff b is a unitary operator valued 1 cocycle 5 let ti i 1 2 be the induced representations corresponding to the 1 cocycles bi i 1 2 respectively then t 1 and t 2 are unitary equivalent if and only if b 1 and b 2 are cohomologuous i e b 2 g x c x 1 b 1 g x c xg for some operator valued function c on x definition 1 3 let t be a unitary representation of g on a hilbert space h x h g and c 0 x the algebra of continuous functions on x vanishing at infinity and p a representation of c 0 x on the same hilbert space h the pair t p will be called a unitary representation of the right g space x iff t and p satisfy the so called quasi invariance condition t g p f t g 1 p r g f g g f c 0 x where r g f x f xg is the right regular representation of g in this case we say that t can be extended to a unitary representation t p of the right g space x theorem 1 1 criterion of inductibility let t be a unitary rep resentation of g then there exist a closed subgroup h and a unitary rep resentation v of h such that t indgh v if and only if t can be extended to a unitary representation t p of the right g space x h g remark 1 3 1 the criterion of inductibility is equivalent to the fol lowing condition on the existence of systems of imprimitivity on x there is a one to one correspondence between the unitary representations t p of the right g space x and the projection measures on x recall that a projection measure on x is by definition a map from the algebra b x of the borel sets e in x to the projections in a hilbert space satisfying the following conditions a e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 for all borel sets e 1 and e 2 b i 1 ek i 1 ek for all borel sets e 1 e 2 such that ei ej i 6 j v c p f x f x dx f c 0 x and d t g e t g 1 eg g g e b x the assertion above is clear in view of the following facts from functional analysis the representation p of the algebra c 0 x is just the quasi invariant condition in def 1 5 integral corresponding to the quasi 124 6 multidimensional quantization invariant condition d projection condition a b measure following the condition c 2 consider the convolution algebra a c 0 g x c 0 x g consisting of all continuous functions with compact support of type x g and with the following convolution product and involution 1 2 x g g 1 x g 1 1 2 xg 1 1 g 1 g d r g 1 x x g g x g xg g 1 g g 1 1 where g is the modular function of the right invariant measure d r on g a representation of the convolution algebra a will be called con sistent of type t iff t g 1 f t g 2 f where f x g f xg 1 g 1 1 gg 1 2 g g 1 1 there is a one to one correspondence between the unitary representations of type t p of c 0 x and the consistent representation of the algebra a c 0 x g of type t this remark is also clear from the point of view of the representation the ory the algebra c 0 x g seems to be the group algebra for the homo geneous space x thus the one to one correspondence between the quasi invariant projection measures on x and the consistent representations of c 0 x g is well known proof of the criterion of inductibility necessity suppose that t indgh v realizing on the space l 2 s x v of square integrable sections of the induced bundle ev for each element f c 0 x define p f as the operator of multiplication by f in the space of sections l 2 s x v of the representation t it is easy to see that p f is a quasi invariant in the sense of 1 5 sufficiency suppose that our representation t extends to a unitary representation t p of the homogeneous space x h g following our remarks 1 7 there exist a consistent representation of algebra a c 0 x g such that g p g t g d r g by restriction to components we can suppose that is a cyclic representa tion acting on l 2 s x v with source or cyclic vector 1 induced representations mackey method of small subgroups 125 for every element c 0 g g we can produce an element c 0 x g such that x g 2 hg 1 g 2 h hg 1 g 2 d r h choose a positive function 0 on g such that h hg d r h 1 we have g g 1 g 1 v g 1 d r g 1 g g hg 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 1 v g 1 d r g 1 d r g 2 h g g hg 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 1 v d rd r g 1 d r g 2 changing the variable g 1 h 1 g 1 we have g g g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 1 v d r g 1 d r g 2 taking g 1 g 2 1 g 1 g 2 2 g 1 g g 1 with i c 0 g we have 1 2 v where by definition g g g d r g and because is the cyclic vector the set c 0 g is everywhere dense in v in c 0 g we define 1 2 and a unitary representation of h by h g h h 1 2 h 1 2 h 1 g consider the induced representation indgh v on the space h of func tions f g c 0 g such that f hg 1 g 2 1 g h f g 1 h 1 g 2 with the scalar product defined by f 1 f 2 f 1 g f 2 g c 0 g d r g the dense subspace l 0 c 0 x g in l 2 s x v can be isometrically mapped into h by l 0 7 f h f g 1 g 2 hg 1 g 1 1 g 2 g g 1 1 126 6 multidimensional quantization the map commutes with the action of g and really is an isometric linear operator with unitary closure thus we have t indgh v where v c 0 g with the scalar product as above the theorem is proved 1 2 the mackey method of small subgroups the main applica tion of the theory of induced representation is probably the mackey the ory which completely describes the set of all irreducible representations of locally compact groups having proper closed normal subgroups via the induction process theorem 1 2 mackey method of small subgroups let g be a locally compact group n a closed normal subgroup n the dual object of n i e the set of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representa tions on which g acts in the natural way n g g g n gng 1 n n suppose that g orbit space n g is of class t 0 let g be the stabilizer of n which contains n let be a representation such that g and the restriction n is equivalent to a multiple of we can therefore consider the induced representation indgg under these assumptions there is a one to one correspondence be tween the dual object g of g and the set of all these classes of induced representations of type indgg proof it is well known that n is a type i group let t be an arbitrary unitary irreducible representation of g in some hilbert space l the the restriction t n can be unitarily and uniquely decomposed into a direct integral of representations t n n w d l n l d where w u s l v cn u n and s is some trivial representation of dimension n 1 2 3 for every measurable bounded function f on n we define p f as the diagonal operator of multiplication by f n it is easy to see that 1 t p is a unitary representation of n 2 the measure is quasi invariant with respect to the g action and 3 if t is irreducible is an ergodic measure therefore must be concentrated on a g orbit in n say in x then x is a homogeneous g space we take a point x following the criterion of inductibility there exists some g such that n mult and finally t indgg 1 induced representations mackey method of small subgroups 127 1 3 projective representations and mackey obstructions definition 1 4 let us denote by h a hilbert space u h the group of unitary operators and s 1 id centu h we define a projective unitary representation t to be a homomorphism t g u h c such that the map g h h is continuous remark 1 4 it is easy to see that a projective unitary representation t can be always lifted just to a continuous map but not necessarily a homomorphism t g u h such that t g 1 t g 2 c g 1 g 2 t g 1 g 2 for some s 1 valued function c t g 1 t g 2 t g 1 g 2 1 from the properties of the homomorphism it is easy to deduce that c g 1 g 2 c g 1 g 2 g 3 c g 1 g 2 g 3 c g 2 g 3 thus c is a 2 cocycle in h 2 g t this cocycle will be a co boundary if there is some function b g t such that c g 1 g 2 b g 1 b g 2 b g 1 g 2 in this case we have b g 1 t g 1 b g 2 t g 2 b g 1 g 2 t g 1 g 2 and therefore b t will be a unitary representation of g in general case the cohomology class c h 2 g t is called the obstruction to lifting a projective representation to a unitary linear representation now we consider the situation of locally compact groups having proper closed normal subgroups say n theorem 1 3 suppose that for every h h the representation h h n hnh 1 n n is equivalent to then there exists a one to one correspondence between the classes h such that n mult and the set h n proj of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible projective rep resentations of h n remark 1 5 if one is using the mackey method of small subgroups h g the cocycles corresponding to the projective representations from h n proj are called the mackey obstructions if the mackey obstructions vanish then we can obtain the dual object g from the dual objects g n in killing the mackey obstructions and so we can use the induction process on group dimension in the orbit method this will be done by taking either 128 6 multidimensional quantization the so called z 2 z covering see the next sections 6 8 or the so called u 1 covering see appendices a 2 a 3 proof of the theorem for every k k h n choose a representation k h for ex ample by a borel section such that every element h h has a unique decomposition h k n k k n n every h such that n mult by definition is of the form n iv 1 n acting on v 1 v 2 because h h h there exists a family of projective unitary operators w k k k such that k n k 1 w k n w k 1 the operator k iv 1 w k 1 commutes with all the operators n and because is irreducible k iv 1 w k 1 s k iv 2 thus for h k n we have h s k w k n now we verify that s k u v 1 t is a projective representation we see on one hand that k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 mod n therefore k 1 k 2 s k 1 k 2 w k 1 k 2 n for some n n on the other hand we have k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 s k 1 s k 2 w k 1 w k 2 remark that a b a b if and only if there exists some constant c such that a a b 1 b thus from s k 1 k 2 w k 1 k 2 n s k 1 s k 2 w k 1 w k 2 and from the fact that w is a projective family we can conclude that w k 1 w k 2 k 1 k 2 1 w k 1 k 2 n and s k 1 s k 2 k 1 k 2 s k 1 k 2 the last equation proves that s is a unitary projective representation of k h n the irreducibility and the inverse direction is easy remark 1 6 the generalized orbit method proposes a multidimen sional generalization of the idea of the mackey method to the general situ ation the rest of this work is devoted to explain this idea 2 symplectic manifolds with flat action of lie groups 129 2 symplectic manifolds with flat action of lie groups in this section we recall the definition of symplectic manifolds and then show that locally every symplectic manifold with a flat action of a lie group can be considered as some co adjoint orbit 2 1 flat action definition 2 1 a symplectic manifold m is a real smooth mani fold m jointed with a symplectic structure i e a closed non degenerate differential 2 form it is easy to deduce from this definition the following corollary 2 1 every symplectic manifold has even dimension example 2 1 every cotangent bundle can be transformed into a sym plectic manifold to show this it is enough to construct a closed non degenerate differential 2 form we shall construct the so called liouville form its differential b d will be the desired symplectic structure let us consider an arbitrary differentiable manifold n and its cotangent bundle t n if u n is an arbitrary local coordinate chart with the coordinate functions q 1 q 2 qk the cotangent space t mn m n has the linear coordinates p 1 p 2 pk dual to the basis q 1 qk of tmn let us denote by p t n n the natural projection then p 1 u u u rk t n is a local coordinate chart of t n with coordinates q 1 q 2 qk p 1 p 2 pk we define the restriction u of form by u k i 1 pidq i let v be another coordinate chart in n and v p 1 v the correspond ing coordinate chart in t n with the coordinate functions q 1 q 2 q k p 1 p k then in the intersection u v we have the relations q i q i q 1 qk i 1 k p i p i q 1 qk p 1 pk i 1 k and p i i 1 k are linear functions of p 1 p 2 pk of form p i k j 1 qj q i pj 130 6 multidimensional quantization therefore we have v u k i 1 p idq i i j qj q i pj l q i ql dql j l i qj q i q i ql pjdq l j l jlpjdq l j pjdq j u v therefore u k i 1 pidq i defines a 1 form 1 t n this form is the so called liouville form its differential b d has the following local coordinate form b u d u k i 1 dpi dqi therefore it is a non degenerate differential 2 form b 2 t n this example is in the foundation of the standard hamiltonism of classical me chanical systems definition 2 2 a vector field vect m is called hamiltonian and denoted vect m iff holds one of the following equivalent conditions i the lie derivative of along the field vanishes l lie 0 ii is a closed 1 form a vector field vect m is called strictly hamiltonian and denoted vect 0 m if the 1 form is exact i e there exists the so called generating function f f such that df 0 in this case one says that f is the strictly hamiltonian vector field corresponding to the function f or the symplectic gradient of f remark 2 1 on the symplectic manifold m there is a one to one correspondence between the vector fields vect m and the 1 forms 1 m therefore we have the following diagram of two exact 2 symplectic manifolds with flat action of lie groups 131 sequence of vector spaces 0 0 r v ect 0 m vect m h 1 dr m 0 c m r r 0 proposition 2 1 the vertical and the horizontal sequences are in fact the exact sequence of lie algebras proof first we prove that vect m vect m vect 0 m really let vect m consider the function defined by f f from differential geometry we know that l l and l d d then l l l d d d df thus the quotient lie algebra vect m v etc 0 m is commutative and is isomorphic to the commutative lie algebra h 1 dr m r recall that for two functions f g c m r their poisson brackets is defined as f g fg gf f g f thus d f g df f g and the vertical sequence is also an exact sequence of lie algebras the proposition is proved 132 6 multidimensional quantization let us consider now the smooth group action of a lie group g on m the lie algebra g lieg acts on m by the infinitesimal action more precisely for every x m and x g the one parameter group exp tx provides a smooth curve passing through the point x m let thus denote this curve by exp tx x and its tangent vector at x by x x x x d dt t 0 exp tx x suppose that x vect 0 m x g with generating function fx the quantity c x y fx fy f x y can be considered as the curvature of the group action of g on m definition 2 3 the action of g on m is said to be flat iff the curva ture c of the g action vanishes i e fx fy f x y 0 x y g remark 2 2 if the action of g on m is flat the homomorphism g vect m can be lifted to a homomorphism g c m r following the commutative diagram 0 0 v ect 0 m vect m h 1 dr m r 0 c m r g r 0 example 2 2 every co adjoint orbit or following a a kirillov k orbit is a simplectic manifold with a flat action let us consider a connected and simply connected lie group g with lie algebra g lieg and the dual vector space g homr g r with every element g g we can associate a map a g g g a g x gxg 1 fixing the identity element e g a g e geg 1 e 2 symplectic manifolds with flat action of lie groups 133 the differential of this map ad g a g g teg g teg is called the adjoint representation of g in g ad g aut g the corresponding contragradient representation of g in g is called the co adjoint representation of g k coad g aut g k g ad g 1 g g under this co adjoint action of g on g the space g is divided on to the so called co adjoint or following a a kirillov the k orbits g g o g remark that the adjoint action of lie algebra g on itself adx y x y is the differential of the adjoint action of g on g ad expx eadx let us now consider a fixed k orbit o g we fix a point f and consider the stabilizer gf at this point and the bilinear form f on g it is easy to see that the kernel of this form is coincided with the lie algebra gf liegf of the stabilizer gf symbolically ker f gf therefore f induces a non degenerate bilinear form f on the tangent at f space tf g gf we write the action of g on f on the right so it is natural to identify with the coset space gf g and the tangent space tf at f with the quotient space gf g g gf the orbit is a homogeneous right g space and f is a non degenerate skew form on the tangent space tf g gf remark that the form f tf tf r is adgf invariant i e x x gf y y gf and g gf k g f x y f adg 1 x adg 1 y adg f x y i e f x y f x y therefore f can be extended to a g invariant 2 form on we prove now that this form f is closed really d f x y z f x y z f x z y f y z x f x y z y z x z x y 0 134 6 multidimensional quantization following the jacobi identity for lie algebras thus f is a g invariant symplectic structure on orbit f finally we show that the g action is flat really every x g can be considered as a linear function fx x on g and therefore a function on hence dfx f f x x f and f x y x y lx y lxfy fx fy thus every k orbit is a g homogeneous symplectic manifold with the flat co adjoint action of g the space g is decomposed into a disjoint union of the homogeneous symplectic g manifolds with the flat co adjoint g action together they can be considered as the symplectic leaves of a g homogeneous poisson structure on g this idea goes back to the classical one from sophus lie 2 2 classification theorem 2 1 classification every homogeneous symplectic man ifold m with flat action of a lie group g is locally isomorphic to an k orbit of g or a central extension of g by r proof consider the map m g defined by m x fx m where fx x g are the generating functions of x x g to verify that this map is g equivalent in virtue of connectedness of g it suffices to verify that commutes with the action of elements of type expy y g on m and on g from the flatness of the g action fx fy f x y one deduces that maps y on m to y on g this suffices for the local equivariance and hence also for global equivariance as remarked before from this g equivariance m is an k orbit in g it is easy to see that if x 1 x 2 x 2 k g and the corresponding hamiltonian fields x 1 x 2 k are linear independent then so are also the differentials of their generating functions dfx 1 dfx 2 k therefore m m g is a local homeomorphism this means that m is a covering of a k orbit g if this k orbit is simply connected the covering is unique and m is homeomorphic to in other case 1 6 1 m is a connected covering of which is in one to one correspondence with subgroups of 1 and m is homeomorphic to where is the universal covering of 3 prequantization 135 let g and m are the corresponding universal coverings of g and m respectively consider the lie algebra g 1 generated by the generating func tions fx x g it is naturally an extension of g by r 0 r g 1 g 0 we have a commutative diagram of lie algebras and homomorphisms 0 0 v ect 0 m v ect m h 1 dr m r 0 c m r g 1 r 0 thus m is a homogeneous symplectic manifold with flat action of the simply connected lie group g 1 corresponding to lie algebra g 1 the theorem is proved remark 2 3 the classification theorem means that every hamiltonian system with flat action of a connected lie group g is locally isomorphic to a co adjoint orbit of g or its central extension by r roughly speaking locally every flat homogeneous hamiltonian system is a co adjoint orbit 3 prequantization in this section we define the so called procedure of quantization the rule of geometric quantization and show its application to the representation the ory our main intention is to do all in the multidimensional context in this situation there arise s some noncommutative summand in the expression of the corresponding curvature 3 1 quantization procedure let us consider a fixed co adjoint or bit o g a fixed point f the stabilizer gf at the point f and its connected component of identity gf 0 recall that gf g is a right homogeneous g space remark 3 1 f exp exp i f gf 0 t s 1 c defines a unitary character i e a 1 dimensional representation of gf 0 where h 2 is the so called normed planck constant and h is the un normed planck constant for the mathematical theory exposed here the 136 6 multidimensional quantization concrete value of does not play any role the only importance is that its value is nonzero we use it in the correspondence with the corresponding physics theories normally we can suppose that 1 really we have gf liegf ker f then the linear functional i f is also a character i e 1 dimensional representation of gf i e i f gf gf 0 definition 3 1 the orbit is said to be admissible resp integral iff there exists a unitary representation of the whole gf such that its restriction on gf 0 is a multiple of f gf 0 mult f resp iff f can be extended to a unitary character r of gf remark 3 2 in virtue of the fact that gf 0 is a normal closed sub group of gf the set of such is in one to one correspondence with the projective representations of the quotient group gf gf 0 g f gf 0 mult f 1 1 gf gf 0 proj remark 3 3 it is easy to see that gf can be included in the symplectic group of the tangent space g gf of the orbit f gf sp g gf the last group has the well known metaplectic two fold covering 1 z 2 z mp g gf sp g gf 1 using the 5 homomorphism lemma we can construct the unique two fold covering of the stabilizer gf such that the following diagram is commutative 1 z 2 z ggf gf 1 1 z 2 z mp g gf sp g gf 1 on one hand on the other hand the symplectic group has also the well known u 1 covering 1 u 1 mpc g gf sp g gf 1 also using the 5 homomorphism lemma we can construct 3 prequantization 137 the unique u 1 covering of the stabilizer gf such that the following diagram is commutative 1 u 1 gu 1 f gf 1 1 u 1 mpc g gf sp g gf 1 therefore there are two subsets g z 2 z f and g u 1 f of unitary representa tions in the projective dual object gf gf 0 proj in the future avoiding the mackey obstructions of the construction we shall use the two fold covering in the duflo s construction sections 6 8 and the u 1 covering in the later development appendices a 1 a 3 proposition 3 1 the orbit is integral if and only if the cohomology class of the kirillov s form is integral i e h 2 z proof recall that we suppose always g to be a connected and simply connected lie group and gf the closed subgroup therefore gf g and we have the long exact sequence of cohomology groups 0 h 0 r h 0 g r h 0 gf r h 1 r h 1 g r h 1 gf r h 2 r h 2 g r h 2 gf r we have h 0 g r 0 h 1 g r 0 then h 2 r h 1 gf r and 1 0 gf g gf 0 let us denote by p g gf g the natural projection then p id d for some h 1 g z this form is unique up to a differential say df f c g r and 0 gf 0 is closed really 0 i f now suppose that the orbit is admissible therefore there exists v g f such that gf 0 mult f 138 6 multidimensional quantization let us consider the action indggf sigma v on the sections of th associated bundle ev g gf v definition 3 2 under a procedure of quantization or some time a rule of quantization we mean a correspondence associating to each function f c c an hermitian operator f which become anti auto adjoint for real functions f in a hilbert space h satisfying the so called commutation relations what follow f g i f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 c c 1 id in this case the operators f f c c will be called the quantized operators recall that for the associated induced bundle ev we have to suppose that the principal bundle gf g gf g is locally trivial and that we fix a connection i e a trivialization then with every representation v of gf we can associate an affine connection on the induced bundle with the connection form definition 3 3 for every f c denote its hamiltonian vec tor field by f f df 0 the operators f f i f f i l f vert f are called the geometric quantization operators corresponding to f c c where f on the right hand side is the operator of multiplica tion by f and vert f is the vertical componenent of the vector field f following the fixed connection on the principal bundle theorem 3 1 the following three conditions are equivalent 1 i id vect 2 curv i i id 3 f 1 f 2 i f 1 f 2 1 id 3 prequantization 139 i e f 7 f is a quantization procedure 1 2 is just from differential geometry of connections from our definition 3 7 we have l i vert for simplicity we denote vert as therefore we write l i l i l i l i l l i l i l i 2 l i l l l i l l i in virtue of lie derivation the first summand vanishes it rests only to prove the following lemma 3 1 l really applying the left hand side to a section s we have l s l s l s l s l s l s s 2 3 can be proved by a direct verification i f 1 f 2 i f 1 i f 1 f 2 i f 2 i i f 1 f 2 i f 1 f 2 i 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 i f 1 f 2 i f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 i f 1 f 2 from differential geometry we know that f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 we have therefore only to prove the following lemma 3 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 really because f 1 f 2 are the scalar functions and f 1 f 2 are the operator valued functions i the connection form we have then f 1 f 2 0 f 1 f 2 f 1 l f 2 140 6 multidimensional quantization applying this to a section s we have f 1 f 2 s f 1 l f 2 l f 2 f 1 s l f 2 f 1 s f 1 f 2 s the theorem is proved 3 2 application let x g lieg be an arbitrary element and exp tx t r g the corresponding one parameter subgroup in g and x the corresponding strictly hamiltonian vector field with the generating function fx f x and the corresponding lie derivation lx l x it is easy to see that lx ly l x y lxf fx f and c x y fx fy f x y 0 in virtue of flatness of the g action applying the procedure of pre quantization we define x i f x i fx x it is easy to show that x y x y c x y x y following the flatness of the g action conclusion the procedure of geometric quantization provides a lie algebra representation on the space of sections of the induced bundle ev remark 3 4 there are some conditions providing the corresponding lie group representations namely the e nelson conditions if all the oper ators x x g and the casimir operators c c z g centu g have operator closures then exp x x g provide a unitaty representation of the universal covering group g of the lie group g 4 polarization 141 4 polarization in the previous section we have discussed how to construct the so called quantum correspondence f 7 f f c c but we didn t discuss about the arizing here hilbert space h on which the quantized operators f f c c act so we had the so called prequantization in general from a symplectic manifold one constructs the l 2 space on coordinates but not on impulsion the procedure of deleting from the coordinates of the symplectic manifold the half number of impulsion coordinates is roughly speaking polarization 4 1 some ideas from physics let us consider a general symplectic manifold m with the symplectic form x 2 k i j 1 i j ai j x dx i dxj in local coordinates x x 1 x 2 x 2 k the so called darboux coordinates are the local coordinates x 1 x 2 x 2 k q 1 q 2 qk p 1 pk such that in these local coordinates the symplectic form has the canonical form p q k i 1 dpi dqi it is well known in differential geometry that such a system of coordinates always exists in these p q coordinates the poisson brackets are just the classical canonical commutation relations pi qj i j pi pj 0 qi qj 0 thus the so called classical polarization means a choice of a maximal com mutative subalgebra p u c u in a fixed darboux coordinate neigh borhood u m there is a physical principle asserting that the local transformations i e symmetry do not interchange positions i e q coordinates with impulsions i e p coordinates this means that the stabilizer gx at every point x m normalizes the commutative subalgebra p u this means also that the semi direct product h p u gx is some subalgebra of g lieg where gx liegx 142 6 multidimensional quantization in quantum mechanics one considers the following model one fixes a separable hilbert space h l 2 rk consisting of the complex valued functions with square integrable module and with the usual scalar product of functions f 1 f 2 rk f 1 q 1 qk f 2 q 1 qk dq 1 dqk in this model the quantum states f are represented by the normed vectors f l 2 rk f 1 where by definition f 2 f f some time the physicists note f for this normed vector f the quantum quantities are represented by the normal i e a a 0 perhaps un bounded but having the operator closure operators roughly speaking a quantum mechanical system is a pair h a consisting of a hilbert space and a algebra of normal operators their measurable values are just their eigenvalues therefore the commutator a b of two operators a and b has its eigenvalues as the difference of two measuring order of physical quan tities ab and ba therefore every physical quantity a and its adjoint quantity a are always exactly commensurable i e can be together at any state without errors measurable quantization means a process associating pi 7 p i i 1 k qi 7 q i i 1 k and more generally to every classical quantity i e a smooth function f c rk a quantum quantity f a f 7 f in such a way that 1 p i q j pi qj ijid where h 2 h is the planck constant this means that f 7 1 f is a homomorphism from the lie algebra of classical quantities with poisson brackets to the lie algebra with operator brackets associated with the associate algebra of quantum quantities in particular the classical commutation relations must be mapped into the corresponding quantum commutatiom relations the well known stone von neumann theorem asserts that there exists a unique up to unitary equivalence solution of the quatum correspondence pi 7 p i qi 7 q i satisfying the precedent commutation relations 4 polarization 143 q i qi multiplication by coordinate function qi p i 1 qi derivation by coordinate variable pi these operators act on the dense subspace s rk l 2 rk consisting of the schwartz class functions and have normal operator closure on the sobolev spaces hs rk which are also hilbert spaces this unique solution of the quantum correspondence pi 7 p i 1 qi qi 7 q j qj satisfying the quantum commutation relations p i q i 1 ijid can be also obtained from our geometric quantization procedure f 7 f f 1 f this explains the physical meaning of our procedure of geometric quantiza tion the central problem of constructing the hilbert space h l 2 rk of quantum states is therefore reduced to the problem of delating the q p coordinates which means delating a maximal commutative gx invariant subalgebra h od g subordinating the functional f g i e gx liegx h g h is a maximal subalgebra of g such that f h h 0 what means the so called polarization following the terminology of physicists we are going now to some exact mathematical models of these physical ideas 4 2 f polarizations and polarizations let us now consider a co adjoint orbit gf g and h 0 the connected closed subgroup cor responding to h the last condition of polarization means that i f is a 1 dimensional representation of h and therefore can be considered as the diferential of the character f gf 0 h 0 exp i f suppose that the orbit is admissible i e there exists a representation denoted f g f such that its restriction to the connected component gf 0 is a multiple of the character f symbolically f gf 0 mult f we have therefore a pair gf f consisting of a group gf and a represen tation f from the lie algebra point of view this representation can be 144 6 multidimensional quantization extended to representation of lie subalgebra h g thus polarization pro poses some extension of the pair gf f to some pair h consisting of h gf h 0 and some representation such that gf mult f remark 4 1 we consider the representations of the restrictions of which to gf 0 h 0 are the multiples of f following the theory of pro jective representations see 1 they are in a one to one correspondence with the projective representations of h gf 0 h 0 gf 0 gf there fore we can consider them as linear representations passing to the two fold coverings of type g z 2 z f g g f or u 1 coverings of type g u 1 f definition 4 1 a real f polarization h is a maximal with respect to inclusion pair of group and irreducible representation such that 1 gf h g where h is a closed subgroup in g 2 the restriction of to gf is a multiple of f gf mult f 3 lieh h is adgf invariant and h 0 mult 0 0 h 0 is gf fixed proposition 4 1 if h is a f polarization then codimgh 1 2 dim f proof because gf 0 h 0 h 0 0 h 0 and gf h 0 mult f there is a one to one correspondence between these 0 h 0 such that h 0 mult 0 and the projective representations of gf 0 h 0 h 0 or the linear representations of the coverings z 2 z coverings or u 1 coverings because gf 0 h 0 mult f we have 0 gf 0 h 0 mult f h 0 mult f thus f h h 0 as a linear space h is a maximal isotropic subspace of the kirillov s form f f 4 polarization 145 thus codimg h 1 2 rank f 1 2 dimg dimker f 1 2 dimg dimgf 1 2 dim f definition 4 2 a polarization of orbit f at point f is a maximal with respect to inclusion pair h consisting of a lie subalgebra h and a representation such that 1 gf h g denote the connected analytic subgroup correspond ing to h 2 subgroup h gf h 0 is closed in g 3 the subalgebra h is adgf invariant 4 gf 0 mult f 5 h 0 mult 0 0 h 0 and 0 is gf fixed remark 4 2 it is easy to see that from a f polarization h one can construct a polarization h and vice versa in oder to obtain some irreducible representations by the construction one consider a restricted condition l pukanszky condition 4 6 let us denote p g h the dual map to the inclusion h i g the affine subspace p 1 pf f h is contained in the orbit f definition 4 3 if the pukanszky is satisfied we say that f is well admissible and h is an admissible polarization at f remark 4 3 if h is an admissible polarization at f then by transla tions adg h is an admissible polarization at k g f f therefore we say that is an admissible orbit some more general notion of f polarization and polarization can be obtained in passing to the complex domain 4 3 complex polarizations definition 4 4 a complex f polarization p h is a maximal quadruple satisfying the folowing conditions a p is a complex subalgebra of the complexified gc such that gf c p gc b p is adgf invariant c h p p g and m p p g are real subalgebras 146 6 multidimensional quantization d there exists the closed subgroups h and m such that h m g where lieh h liem m e is an irreducible representation h such that gf mult f is a complex representation of p such that h d the differential of definition 4 5 a complex polarization of at f is a triple p 0 satisfying the following conditions a p is a complex lie subalgebra of gc such that gf c p gc b p is adgf invariant c there exist the real lie subalgebras m and h of g such that p p mc m p p g p p hc h p p g p g d the subgroups m 0 h 0 m h are closed where m 0 and h 0 are the analytic subgroups corresponding to the lie algebras m and h respectively and m gf m 0 h gf h 0 e 0 h 0 and the point 0 in the dual object h 0 is fixed under the action of gf and 0 gf h 0 mult f gf h 0 f is a complex representation of p such that h d the differential of theorem 4 1 there is a one to one correspondence between the complex f polarizations p h and the complex polarizations p 0 proof it is clear that from a f polarization p h one can construct easily a polarization p 0 conversely considering the surjec tion gf h 0 h gf h 0 with kernel gf h 0 from our assumptions we have f gf h 0 0 gf h 0 because 0 is gf fixed we can construct a representation of h gf h 0 such th at gf f h 0 0 it is easy now to see from the definition that p h is a f polarization the theorem is proved 4 polarization 147 4 4 weak lagrangian distributions remark 4 4 we say that an integrable gf invariant tangent distribu tion l on gf g is weak lagrangian iff the semidirect product of lie algebras p gf c g l where by g l we denote the space of all the g invariant sections of the tangent distribution l is a complex lie algebra and the representation f of gf can be extended to a representa tion of h gf h 0 and to a complex representation of p satisfying the conditions in the definition 4 10 above definition 4 6 we say that this distribution is closed iff the groups m 0 h 0 m h are closed where by definition m 0 and h 0 are the analytic subgroups corresponding to the lie algebras m p p g and h p p g p g respectively and m gf m 0 h gf h 0 thus there is a bijection between the f polarizations and the closed weak lagrangian g invariant integrable tangent distributions 4 5 duflo data in general the quotient group gf h 0 h 0 is noncommutative we considered in our definition of polarizations 0 h 0 which is fixed under the adjoint action of gf and the condition 0 h 0 gf mult f h 0 gf the representations of this type are in a one to one correspondence with the projective representations of group h 0 gf h 0 in the particular case where we are taking not multi but one dimemsional representations 0 we obtain the single corresponding projective representation as a projective represntation of lie group it can be lifted to a linear representation in considering the coverings following m duflo we consider now the two fold covering h z 2 z 0 h g 0 of h 0 1 z 2 z hg 0 h 0 1 we denote the generator of the cyclic group z 2 z by and define the lifted character g f of h g 0 by the condition g f 1 then we consider the so called odd representations 0 h g 0 such that 0 gg f hg 0 mult g f 148 6 multidimensional quantization we have therefore f h h 0 thus passing to the two fold coverings g g f gf g 0 h g 0 h g ofgf gf 0 h 0 h respectively we can in this particular situation consider the real polarization h simply as a maxim al possible with respect to inclusion lie subalgebra h satisfying the following conditions a gf h g h is a lie subalgebra let h 0 be the corresponding analytic subgroup b h is adgf invariant c h 0 and h gf h 0 are closed subgroups in g d f h h 0 one can easily generalize this notion of polarization passing into the complex domain definition 4 7 a complex polarization is a complex maximal with respect to inclusion lie subalgebra p of gc satisfying the following conditions a gf c p gc b p is adgf invariant c h p p g p g and m p p g are real lie subalgebras of g d h 0 m 0 h m are closed subgroups in g where h 0 and m 0 are the analytic subgroups corresponding to the real lie subalgebras h m said above h gf h 0 m gf m 0 then one considers a fixed representation such that its restriction to gf 0 is a multiple of the character f and lift it to the odd character gf f of the two fold covering g gf f definition 4 8 the pair f is called a duflo s datum and the complex lie subalgebra p is called a polariszation in the duflo s theory now consider any representation satisfying the conditions e h g gf g 0 mult g f f there is a complex contination of the representation d of the real lie algebra h to a complex representation of the complex lie algebra p such that the e nelson s conditions are satisfied we return then to our theory exposed above remark 4 5 this particular case dim 1 correspondence to the case of lagrangian gf invariant integrable tangent distributions we finish this section by recalling a theorem of m vergne on existence of polarizations the reader could find more detail in the original works of m vergne 5 bibliographical remarks 149 1 let v be a symplectic vector space and suppose that 0 v 0 v 1 v 2 vn v s is a chain of vector subspaces such that dimvk k

condition f h f 5 bibliographical remarks the first idea about a general construction of multi dimensional quan tization procedure was appeared in 1979 1980 in d 5 and d 12 later it was largely developed in many works d 4 d 6 d 11 du 1 du 3 150 6 multidimensional quantization chapter 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations 1 holomorphly induced representations lie derivative from a f polarization p h we can produce some representa tion of g on the space of partially invariant partially holomorphic sections of some induced bundle after that we shall show that the lie derivative of this representation is just the representation of lie algebra g arising from the procedure of geometric multidimensional quantization 1 1 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations definition 1 1 let d be a closed not necessarily connected sub group of g with lie algebra d lied let be a fixed unitary not nec essarily irreducible of d in a hilbert space v then a d polarization p h will be any maximal with respect to inclusion quadruple satis fying the following conditions a p is a complex subalgebra such that dc p gc b p is add invariant c h is a closed subgroup of g such that its lie algebra is just lieh h p g d there exists a closed subgroup m of g with lie algebra liem m p p g e is an irreducible representation of h h such that d mult f is a complex representation of p such that all the conditions of e nelson are satisfied and that the corresponding to lie algebra represen tation d h d example 1 1 let us consider d gf f rep gf and a f polarization p h of it is easy to check that we have p h as a d f polarization 151 152 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations consider the principal bundle d g x d g it is a locally trivial principal bundle fix a connection on it i e a trivialization let us consider a d polarization p h and a fixed connection on the principal bundle h g h g consider the associated with respect to the projection map d g p h g principal bundle d g d g there is the so called associated connection on it such that the following diagram is commutative d g h g d g p h g we have a representation of h and d mult of d therefore we have also the corresponding affine connections and on the vector bundles ev h g and p ev d g respectively such that the following diagram is commutative v ev v p ev h g p d g therefore the corresponding spaces of sections could be included as follows ev h g ev d g the image of this inclusion is just the space s ev s is left h invariant we consider also the next projection g d g 1 holomorphly induced representations lie derivative 153 and we have by analogy the diagram of triple vector bundles with connection p 1 p 2 ev p 2 ev ev g p 1 d g p 2 h g remark that the last bundle v p 1 p 2 ev g is trivial and we can identify the sections of this bundle with v valued functions on g it is easy to see that ev f c g v f hx h f x h h x g p 2 ev f c g v f hx d h f x h d x g definition 1 2 section s ev is called partially invariant and par tially holomorphic iff its covariant derivatives p along the directions of p vanish theorem 1 1 the space ev h g of partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections of the induced bundle ev h g is invariant subspace in ev and is isomorphic to the space c g p h of the v valued functions f on g satisfying the following equations f hx h f x x g h h lx x f 0 x p where by definition lx l x is the lie derivation along the vector field x x g proof recall the action lx lxf x d dt f exp tx x t 0 and f hx h f x are the left action therefore c g p h is a g invariant subspace with respect to the right translations by analogy we have an inclusion ev ev and it is a g invariant subspace looking at the diagram v g v p ev v ev g p h g 154 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations we have the natural isomorphism ev h g c g p h the proof of the theorem is here achieved remark 1 1 it is easy to see that the partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections of the induced bundle ev h g form a structural sheaf of the partially invariant holomorphly induced bundle noted ev definition 1 3 the natural action ofg on ev isomorphic to the right translations on c g p h is called the partially invariant and holomorphly induced representation of g and denoted by ind g p h remark 1 2 our partially invariant and partially holomorphic sec tions are just the image of the partially holomorphic in the sense of r b blattner sections with respect to the inclusion ev h g ev d d d g 1 2 unitarization let us denote by h and g the modular func tions for the haar measures of h and g respectively then h g is a non unitary character of h we have the so called 1 2 density bundle m 12 g d c on d g the bundle e v h g ev h g m 1 2 is a g bundle oner x d g because is unitary for every section s ev s 2 v m where by definitionm m 12 m 12 is the so called density bundle we define the scalar product on the vector space e v by the formula s 1 s 2 h g s 1 x s 2 x v dx let us denote the completion of e v h g by l 2 e v it is a hilbert space which can be identified with the hilbert space l 2 g p h consisting of v valued functions f g v satisfying the equations f hx h h h g h f x x g h h lx x 1 2 trgc h adx f 0 x p 1 holomorphly induced representations lie derivative 155 with the scalar product norm h g f x 2 v dx from now on we mean ind g p h this unitarized representation of g on l 2 g p h l 2 e v 1 3 lie derivation remember that lie is a functor which can be applied to functions sections differential forms vector fields and also to representations and gives some infinitesimal ones we apply here this functor lie to our induced representation to have an infinitesimal repre sentation of our lie algebra g lieg theorem 1 2 for every x in g liex ind g p h i f x remark 1 3 the quantization procedure gives us some lie algebra representation of type x 7 i f x this is local version of the theory the construction of partially invariant holomorphly induced representations gives us a global theory of group representations the theorem asserts the relationship between the local and global constructions proof of the theorem first of all recall the construction of the hilbert bundle e v by definition we have e v g gf v g v where by definition g v g v g hg v h h v for some h gf the representation gf u v c is unitary projective gf u v c the image of this representation is a finite dimensional topological subgroup and then by the positive solution of the well known hilbert problem is a lie subgroup of u v c therefore in virtue of the stone theorem every one parameter subgroup of u v c has a skew selfadjoint generator say a a and the 1 parameter subgroup self is therefore of form ut exp i ta t r we can thus define the derivative of 1 parameter subgroups 156 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations recall now the definition of lie derivative of bundle homomorphisms following y koschmann schwarzbach let us consider two g bundles e e over d g of type ev then g acts also on the homomorphism bundle end v hom e e d g m consider u um hom e e e u e m um m then g action on hom e e is just g u um g u g 1 g um g 1 let x g and gt exp tx g be the corresponding 1 parameter sub group we can define x u d dt gt u t 0 which exists following the stone theorem remark 1 4 1 x u is a differential operator of degree 1 e u me e m um m x u x u u x where x is a differential operator in e and x is a differential operator in e 2 consider the particular case where um id then x u hom e e e e is the lie derivative of g action on e e 3 consider the case where e m then u is some section and then x u xu is just the covariant derivative of u along the vector field x return now to our situation of quantization we have a f polarization p h and we can consider the inclusion e v 1 2 tr ad e v 1 2 tr ad p gf g h g let us consider p 2 the irreducible representations of nilpotent lie groups 157 we have x l x i 1 x where 1 x x 1 2 trgc h adx is the differential of the representation gf consider the differential form on m gf g defined by the formula y y f y m the expression x can be considered also as the generating function of vector field x x y y x f y x fx y thus we have x l x i 1 x l x i fx i 1 x x i f x the theorem is proved example 1 2 the degenerate principal series representations of semi simple lie groups can be obtained from our construction as indgp m disc p mau where g kp is the well known gauss decomposition 2 the irreducible representations of nilpotent lie groups in this section we shall show the duflo s construction of irreducible rep resentations as a particular case of our construction of partially invariant and holomorphly induced representations this duflo s construction pro poses to pass to the two fold covering of stabilizers it is natural to consider the so called shale weil construction in the particular case of nilpotent lie groups where the stabilizers are connected the results give us the original kirillov orbit method 2 1 duflo construction recall that our multidimensional quanti zation procedure starts with a f polarization p h 0 satisfying the conditions a f of the definition 4 10 this is equivalent to giving a gf f polarization p h of the definition 5 1 in general case 0 is an arbitrary irreducible unitary representation of h 0 such that its re striction to gf h 0 is equivalent to the restriction of f to gf h 0 symbolically 0 gf h 0 f gf h 0 158 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations for example the degenerate principal series representations of semi simple lie groups can be obtained in this way for the particular case where 0 f one can consider the two fold coverings of type 1 z 2 z 1 ggf gf 1 and 1 z 2 z hg 0 h 0 1 which is obtained by restriction from 1 z 2 z hg h gf h 0 1 and some unitary representation h g 0 such that 0 gg f hg 0 g f ggf hgf 0 where the odd character gf f is the lifted character of the two fold covering hg from the character f of h such that g f 1 as it was remarked considering only the particular case with the lifted in place of un lifted we can restrict our consideration to the duflo s data and polarization interesting to remark that the resulting representation is in fact independent from a particular polarization it depends therefore only on the duflo s data definition 2 1 a duflo datum is a pair f consisting of admis sible and well polarizable functional f g and a some irreducible repre sentation g f of the stabilizer gf recall that admissibility of f means existence such an irreducible representation and the good polarizability of f means that there exists a maximal possible therefore of half dimension of the orbit complex solvable following m duflo subalgebra p in gc such that the following conditions are satisfied a gc p gc b p is adgf invariant c h p g and m p p g are real lie sub algebras let us denote by h 0 and m 0 the analytic subgroups of g corresponding to h and m respectively h gf h 0 and m gf m 0 then h 0 m 0 h m are closed d there exists h g such that gf g 0 mult g f e f p p 0 2 the irreducible representations of nilpotent lie groups 159 f there exists a complex representation of the complex lie subal gebra p such that its restriction to the real part h is coincided with the character i f and the e nelson conditions are satisfied remark 2 1 the condition 6 1 e is often referred as the subordinate ness condition in the construction of irreducible unitary representations one assumes always the pukanszky condition see theorem 4 17 remark 2 2 as it was remarked the duflo s data are defined as the pairs of admissible well polarizable functional f and some irreducible rep resentation of gf the restriction of which to the connected component gf 0 are multiples of the character f this character and representation can be lifted to the two fold coverings 1 z 2 z 1 ggf gf 1 and 1 z 2 z 1 hg h 1 therefore we can have also an equivalent version of duflo s data definition 2 2 a lifted duflo datum is a pair f of an admis sible and well polarizable functional f g and an odd irreducible unitary representation g gf such that gf gf 0 mult g f 2 2 metaplectic shale weil representation let us consider a sym plectic vector space v to this vector space corresponds the heisenberg lie algebra h 2 n v which is v r as a real vector space and with the commutation relations v t v t v v let h 2 n v exp h 2 n v be the corresponding simply connected lie group it is called the heisenberg group corresponding to the symplectic space v let p 1 p 2 pn q 1 qn be a symplectic orthonormal basis of v with respect to the symplectic form i e pi q j ij i j 1 2 n it is easy to see that cent h 2 n v r and centh 2 n v r following the well known stone von neumann theorem there exists a unique up 160 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations to unitary equivalence unitary representation t of h 2 n v in the hilbert space l 2 rn such that it restriction to the center of h 2 n v is a multiple of the character define d by exp t exp i t id its differential is the representation dt of the heisenberg algebra h 2 n v defined by pi 7 p i i qi the ith partial derivation qi 7 q i qi multiplication with the coordinate function qi t 7 t 1 t these differential operators are defined on the dense subspace s rn consisting of the schwartz class functions in the representation space h l 2 rn from the point of view of the orbit method this representation t corre sponds to the parameter t 1 h 2 n v where p 1 p n q 1 q 1 1 is the dual basis of h 2 n v and the real p polarization h 1 generated by the p coordinates p 1 pn the symplectic group sp v acts on v and we can consider the semi direct product sp v h 2 n v we want to extend the representation t of the normal closed subgroup h 2 n v to some representation of sp v h 2 n v and also its subgroups this question is solved by the shale weil theorem what follows recall that the fundamental group 1 sp v z then to the quotient group z 2 z 1 there exists a two fold covering mp v of sp v called the metaplectic group i e there is an exact sequence 1 z 2 z 1 mp v sp v 1 theorem 2 1 shale weil theorem there exists a unique repre sentation s of mp v in h l 2 rn such that for every x mp v with image x sp v and for each n h 2 n v s x t n s x 1 t x n s id remark 2 3 the two fold covering mp v of sp v is called themeta plectic group and the representation s of mp v extending the representa tion t of h 2 n v is called the metaplectic representation or the shale weil representation 2 the irreducible representations of nilpotent lie groups 161 corollary 2 1 every representation s p v realized in the hilbert space h can be considered as a representation of the semi direct product sp v h 2 n v which is trivial on the normal subgroup h 2 n v or as a representation of mp v h 2 n v which is trivial on the normal s subgroup z 2 z h 2 n v z 2 z h 2 n v therefore s t is a representation of mp v h 2 n v such that its restriction to h 2 n v i s a multiple of t s t h 2 n v mult t conversely every representation of sp v h 2 n v which is a multiple of t on h 2 n v can be considered as a projective representation of sp v this projective representation can be transformed into a linear unitary representation if the mackey obstruction cocycle is trivial often one can do this for lie groups by going to the two fold coverings of type 1 z 2 z mp v sp v 1 or to the u 1 coverings u 1 t s 1 of type 1 u 1 mpc v sp v 1 the first version will be done in the duflo s construction the second ver sion will be done in more advanced studies this mechanism of extension of representations is now applied to our orbit method 2 3 irreducible unitary representations of nilpotent lie groups let g be a connected and simply connected nilpotent lie group g lieg its lie algebra g the dual vector space and f g a fixed functional in this situation gf gf 0 and every functional f is integral following theorem 4 2 there exists real polarizations h g which is adgf invariant maximal isotropic with respect to the kirillov form f f sat isfying the pukanszky conditions and which is positive in the following sense for every not necessarily real polarization p f g gf induces some hermitian form i f v v v l p g c the last induces a unique her mitian mapping on l the positivity condition asserts that the negative inner index of f vanishes q p strictly negative eigenvalues 0 with this hermitian form f we can consider f as an 1 dimensional unitary representation of h h 0 in this case and we can induce it to obtain ind g h f 162 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations theorem 2 2 a kirillov b kostant l auslander etc 1 the representations ind g h f for real polarizations and the representations ind g p f for complex polarizations satisfying the pukanszky condi tion are irreducible 2 these representations are independent from polarizations h from the fixed point f but only from the orbit f we denote them therefore by t 3 the correspondence o g 7 t g is a homeomorphism g g o g g remark 2 4 we omit a detailed proof of this theorem remarking only that to prove 1 one reduces the representations to the tensor products of two extended representations of some heisenberg groups corresponding to the polarizations to prove 2 one remarks that by changing the point f the polarizations are changed by conjugations what does not change the equivalent classes of representations to prove 3 one considers in more detail the topology of the orbit space g g and the well known continuity of the induced representation functor indgh 2 4 irreducible representations of extensions of nilpotent lie groups using the shale weil representations we extend now the repre sentations of nilpotent lie groups to more general situations suppose that g is a connected and simply connected group d a sub group of automorphisms of g preserving gf i e d is a subgroup of diffeo morphisms of the orbit f conserving the symplectic structure d i sp p gf c following the well known five homomorphisms diagram lemma the follow ing diagram 1 z 2 z d 1 i 1 z 2 z mp p gf c p sp p gf c 1 can be completed to a commutative diagram follows 1 z 2 z dg d 1 i 1 z 2 z mp p gf c p sp p g c 1 the group dg is just the fibered product of p and i dg d x d mp p g c i d p x denoted x or dp g c 3 representations of connected reductive groups 163 consider a fixed element d d then following auslander and kostant there exists a positive polarization p such that p p is normalized by d the operator s p d f x det dg p 1 2 f d x does not depend on p then if u is a intertwining operator between the representations ind g p f and ind g p f then s p d u 1 s p u and s p d ind g p f x s p d 1 ind g p f d x thus d d 7 s p d unitary equivalence s d is a projective representation of d the character det 1 2 is well defined on sp p g c because the po larization is positive and is a character it can be lifted easily to a character g of the two fold covering such that lg 1 theorem 2 3 m duflo for every d dg the operators s d g s d d d are unitary and s is a unitary representation of dg such that s id i e a so called odd representation corollary 2 2 for every so called odd representation u of dg i e u id the tensor product u st is a representation of d g u st d x u d s d t x remark 2 5 we can not go to the two fold covering mp p g c of sp p g c but to the u 1 covering mp c p g c to obtain another version of the theory 3 representations of connected reductive groups this section is devoted to expose the so called duflo s construction it seems to be an analytic version of the quantization procedure in cases where 0 f we start with some duflo datum f then reduce to the case of connected reductive groups where we shall start our exposition first of all we recall that in the nilpotent case the k orbits are affine planes in g therefore the pukanszky condition f h f is automat ically satisfied the situation is not so in the reductive case 164 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations lemma 3 1 1 for a reductive lie algebra g f g admit a good polarization i e satisfied the pukanszky condition if and only if the lie algebra gf is a cartan subalgebra 2 let a be an ideal of g which is contained in gf g g a f g is the induced from f form on g then f has a good polarization if and only if such one has also f 3 suppose n to be an nilpotent ideal of g f f n g 1 gf g f 1 f g 1 then f has a good polarization if and only if f 1 g 1 has a good polarization the proof of this lemma is not difficult we refer the reader to m duflo s works remark 3 1 the last assertion reduces the question about existence of good polarizations to the reductive case by induction let us denote x g f the set of all the unitary representations of the two fold covering g g f of gf which are odd in the sense that id and the restrictions of which to gf g 0 are multiples of the odd character g f f f this set is in a one to one correspondence with the set xg f of all representations of the stabilizer gf such that their restrictions to the connected component gf 0 are multiples of the character f denote its subset of the irreducible representations by x irrg f x irrg f g g f id gf 0 mult g f and the corresponding subset of xg f consisting of the irreducible ones by x irrg f recall that f g is said to be admissible iff xg f 6 recall also that g f is an odd character of g g f such that 1 and its differential d f 1 g f f expx sh adx 2 adx 2 the multiplication by the odd character f realizes the bijections between the sets xg f and x g f and also x irr g f and x irr g f remark 3 2 suppose that there exists a positive with respect to the hermitian form i f v v adgf invariant lagrangian subspace l in the symplectic vector space g gf c tf c then such the odd character can be easily constructed it is realized in the single non trivial cohomology group of the complex associated with the adjoint action of group on metric tangent bundle of the orbit f see the works of m duflo for more details this is the case for example for the solvable or semi simple lie groups 3 representations of connected reductive groups 165 definition 3 1 denote by ap g the set of all admissible and well polarizable functionals f in g for such a functional a duflo s datum is a pair f with xg f we define x g f ap g xg f this definition is a particular case of definition 4 15 we recall here for the concrete usage for reductive groups case let us consider a connected reductive group g and an admissible well polarizable functional f ap g this means that xg f 6 and gf is a cartan subalgebra denoted h let h be the centralizer of h in g and gc hc be the associated root system for every root denote the corresponding root space by g 6 0 it is easy to see that the cartan subalgebra h can be decomposed into the sum h t a z of the center z of g the split torus a and the compact torus t therefore 1 t a will be the real linear span of co roots let us denote by m the centralizer zg a of the split torus a and m liem then mc hc is contained in gc hc as the subset of purely imaginary roots if is a subset of we denote 1 2 the half sum of roots in with each one can associate a character exp of h g the stabilizer of the point h g the last inclusion is possible in virtue of the root decomposition g h g it is reasonable to recall that h g 0 as eigenspace recall that h c is said to be g regular iff h 6 0 where h is the co root corresponding to this notion can be applied also to m and we can say for example about m regular elements for every consider s c g g ch for each m mc hc s c s c g and therefore m is said to be compact resp noncompact root iff s s c g su 2 166 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations resp sl 2 r denote m c resp m n the set of all compact resp noncompact roots consider now a functional h c such that is m regular and t 1 t denote m m h 0 m n m m n m c m m c and finally m n m c let us recall some notations from vogan by r h denote the set of all the so called m regular unitary pseudo characters consisting of a m regular functional 1 h and a unitary representation of h with differential d d id remark that the last condition d d id is equivalent to the assertion that h 0 mult what figures in the orbit method denote by rirr h the subset of r h consisting of the irreducible pseudo characters for a fixed 1 h denote r h r h d id and rirr h r h rirr h the weyl group w g h ng h zg h ng h h acts on both r h and rirr h 3 1 harish chandra construction of recall that exp for each let us denote f x h x centralizers m and 1 then h fh 0 f h 0 h m 0 h 0 3 representations of connected reductive groups 167 and fm 0 f m 0 denote km hc m c g g and km 0 the corresponding analytic subgroup let us denote m 0 the irreducible unitary representation ofm 0 which is square integrable modulo the center of m 0 and which is associated with this representation following harish chandra is characterized by the following condition the restriction m 0 km 0 contains the finite dimensional irreducible unitary representation of km 0 with the dominant weight d with respect to m c as a minimal km 0 type now a representation fm 0 of fm 0 f m 0 can be constructed as follows fm 0 y x y m 0 x x m 0 y f let p mn be a parabolic subgroup of g with the levi component m and the unipotent radical n m fm 0 fm 0 p mn fm 0 n define now indgfm 0 n fm 0 idn recall that if is is irreducible and is g regular the representation is irreducible theorem 3 1 the representation of type can be also obtained from the procedure of multidimensional quantization proof let us consider f g which is admissible i e xg f 6 and well polarizable i e gf h is a cartan subalgebra of g therefore the stabilizer gf h is the corresponding cartan subgroup because g is connected by the assumption 1 f h is a g regular functional from h there is a positive gf invariant lagrangian subspace l g gf c l m n g m c g nc where n lien in general l is not a subalgebra but in any case there is a character f of two fold covering g g f h g with the differential d f now we have rirr h x irrg f 1 1 x irr f 168 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations this means that there exists a unique h g f such that h 0 mult f f and f f ind g l f the theorem is proved 3 2 possibly non connected reductive groups let us now consider the case where g is non connected reductive with lie algebra g lieg consider an admissible well polarizable f ap g i e xg f 6 gf h is a cartan subalgebra h zg h in this case we have h 0 h g 0 h gf let 1 f h h 0 or h 0 h 0 n g then b hc n is a gf invariant polarization at f and e b b g is a parabolic subalgebra with the reductive part zg where f a a is the split component can be considered as a linear form on g which is null on t z h g and on the nilpotent part 0 g g consider now any polarization b at f which is gf stable let e b b g be the parabolic subalgebra of g with unipotent radical u and with reductive part r i e r u e let r 0 be the analytic subgroup with lie algebra r and u its unipotent radical u lieu define r gf r 0 and e gf r 0 u r f r it is easy to see that the stabilizers gf at f in g and rr at r in r are the same rr gf therefore r has a good polarization consider the two fold coverings 1 z 2 z ggf gf 1 1 z 2 z rrr rr 1 therefore we can define x ggf and x rrr for every x gf rr and f and r as in the connected case which are not necessarily to be a character but a odd one by the condition of admissibility there exists the well known bijection x irrg f 1 1 x irrr r 3 representations of connected reductive groups 169 and it holds f x x r x x the subspace c b rc is a lagrangian subspace of r rr c which is totally complex i e c c 0 therefore h is also a fundamental cartan subalgebra of r and r 0 h h 0 x x irrr 0 r r char h 0 with differential d which has only a unique element as in the connected case we have a representation 0 of r 0 0 r ind r 0 b in the space h recall that c b rc with the unipotent radical v radu c is a lagrangian subspace of r rr c c c 0 i e is totally complex recall the notation of root spaces v v v n n h h nv 0 h h corresponding to the root h c let qr c be the number of the negative eigenvalues of c c and let us denote c where is the set of roots of hc in v radu c the space h of smooth vectors in h can be considered as some hc module and following vogan dimhj v h c 0 if j 6 qr c 1 if j qr c m duflo proved that there exists a unique representation s of the two fold covering rrr ggf in the space h denote c where is the set of roots of hc in v radu c the space h of smooth vectors in h can be considered as some hc module and following vogan dimhj v h c 0 if j 6 qr c 1 otherwise of 0 such that s x 0 y s x 1 0 xyx 1 y r 0 x gf x rrr because rrr ggf s can be considered as a representation of g g f in posing s x s x therefore for every odd representation xr r of rrr the formula xy x s x 0 y x rrr y r 0 170 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations provides a representation of semi direct product r rr r 0 gf r 0 this representation can be considered as the representation s 0 idu of e then indge s 0 idu is a representation of g which is also denoted by tf b tf b corollary 3 1 the representations tf b ind s 0 idu are obtained from the multidimensional quantization procedure it is reasonable to remark that various concrete polarizations give us equivalent representations thus the representation tf b is independent from the polarizations we denote it from now on simply as tgf the upper index g indicates the group we are interesting on 3 3 the induction procedure for general separable lie groups let us now consider the case of general separable lie groups consider a duflo s datum f i e f ap g is an admissible and well polarizable functional on g lieg and x irrg f let j be a subgroup of gf acting trivially on g gf following the extension 1 z 2 z 1 ggf gf 1 we can for each x gf choose a preimage x rf x by a map rf j ggf such that f rf x 1 the map rf can be chosen to be a homomorphism assumption for each subgroup c in the center centg of g if x irrg f is such that rf x x id x c for some character c then so is the representation tf tf x x id x c consider the case dim g 0 then g is a discrete group f 0 and tf x r f x x g the assumption is satisfied suppose now that dim g 0 and that tg 1 f 1 1 are defined for every g 1 with dim g 1 dim g and f 1 1 with f 1 ap g and 1 xg 1 f 1 satisfying the assumption consider the duflo datum f x g f ap g xg f let us denote by n the nilpotent radical of g and n the corresponding analytic subgroup which is the nilpotent radical of g i e a closed normal analytic nilpotent subgroup 3 representations of connected reductive groups 171 denote f f n q kerf nf gf g 1 gf q 1 st case dim g 1 dim g then g is reductive and the representations tgf are defined as in 7 3 2 nd case dim g 1 dim g let us denote h gf h f h and h gnf because n is nilpotent the stabilizers of k orbits are connected and therefore the two fold coverings are trivial nnf z 2 z nf 0 1 nf because f is admissible so is also f f n i e there exists a character of nnf such that 1 d i f nf denote q ker 0 the connected component of identity it is a normal subgroup in h gnf with lie algebra q lieq kerd nf gf define g 1 g n f q and p h g n f g 1 the canonical projection it is easy to see that gnf h hhh really we have h h h g n f h nnf h for some element x gf we denote x a representative of the preimages of x in g g f x a representative of the preimages of of x in gnf x a representative of the preimages of x in gnf h then there exists x irrgn f acting on the space h such that x h x f x x f x because nnf acts trivially on h nf there exists a section rh nnf nnf h such that h rh x 1 therefore there exists xh h such that y is defined above for all y gnf h and rh y y id y nnf it is easy to see that gf f 1 h h h r h q and there exists 1 xg 1 f 1 such that 1 p by induction tg 1 f 1 1 is well defined 172 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations consider now u tg 1 f 1 1 p and c n n f q then by the assumption u y y id y nnf let us denote by n the universal covering of n then we have gf n gf n the representation u sftnf is trivial on the kernel of this surjection i e the preimage of the identity element therefore it defines a representation denoted tg 1 f 1 1 sft n f of gf n finally for f x g we define tgf ind g gf n tg 1 f 1 1 sft n f remark 3 3 in the case where g is reductive and dim g 1 dim g we have therefore two construction of tgf but it is easy to see that they are equivalent we finish this section by stating the functorial properties of the con struction of representation referring the reader to the works of m duflo for a more detailed exposition theorem 3 2 m duflo 1 for every f x g the commut ing ring c tgf of intertwining operators of the representation tgf is iso morphic with the same one c of the representation in particular if is irreducible so is also the induced representation tgf 2 for every automorphism a autg tga f atgf in particular the g equivalent pairs f g f give the equivalent representations tgf tgf therefore the representation tgf depends only on the quasi orbit g f x g 3 if f is not in the k orbit of f then the representations tgf and tgf are disjoint 4 there is an isomorphism of the spaces of intertwining operators c tgf tgf c 5 if c is a subgroup of the center centg of g and rf x x id x c for some character c then tgf x x id x c i e the assumption is always satisfied 4 representations of of almost algebraic lie groups 173 6 if n is any ideal of g and n the corresponding analytic subgroup in g f x g f f n etc as in the beginning of 7 4 then tgf ind g gf n tg 1 f 1 1 sft n f 7 the representations tgf are normal i e of type gcr if and only if in this construction dim and the k orbit f g f of f in g is locally closed i e an intersection of closed and open subsets 4 representations of of almost algebraic lie groups this section is devoted to the so called almost algebraic lie groups for this class of lie groups the construction of irreducible representations can be reduced to the case of reductive groups the set of irreducible unitary representations is so big enough to write out the planchere l formula one of the most important part of the harmonic l 2 analysis 4 1 co isotropic subalgebra s definition 4 1 the real separable lie group g is called almost alge braic if and only if there exists a discrete subgroup of its center z g and there exists an algebraic linear group g over r such that the quotient g can be included as an open subgroup in the group g r of real points of g definition 4 2 let f g g lieg subalgebra p g is called co isotropic iff pf p where by by definition p f x p f x p 0 let us define p f p then it is easy to see that pp pf let pp 0 be the analytic subgroup of g corresponding to pp p f then the subset pp 0 f is open in f p recall that p satisfies the pukanszky condition iff pp 0 f f p for a fixed f let us denote cos f the set of all co isotropic subalgebra s satisfying the pukanszky condition example 4 1 1 for every f g g cos f i e cos f 6 2 if p is a real polarization of f satisfying the pukanszky condition then p cos f 3 if b is a complex polarization so that b b is a complexification of p b b g then p is a co isotropic subalgebra and pp b g conversely if p b b g cos f then b is a complex polarization satisfying the pukanszky condition 4 for a semi simple lie algebra g p g is a co isotropic subalgebra iff p is a parabolic subalgebra 174 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations proposition 4 1 let p cos f then f has a good polarization if and only if a such one has p f p proof i sufficiency suppose that p f p has a good polarization b pc then b is also a good polarization at f in gc ii necessity suppose that b is a good polarization at f in gc we prove that there exists a good polarization at p in pc this will be done by induction on dimension if dim g 0 it is obvious suppose that the assertion could be proved for the lie algebras of strictly less dimension there are several cases a e case a there exists a non trivial unipotent ideal a g contained in kerf in this case the assertion is trivially proved by considering the quotient algebra g a which has the dimension strictly less than dim g let us denote z the unipotent part of the center centg due to the case a we can restrict our consideration to the case where dim z 1 and and f z 6 0 if z 6 0 let us denote u radu g the unipotent radical of g case b u z in this case g r z where r is the reductive part and gf is a cartan subalgebra of g therefore gf p will be a parabolic subalgebra and pc contains a borel subalgebra b gc which is a good polarization at p f p case c lie algebra g contains a characteristic commutative ideal a such that z a u and g 6 p a in this case let us denote a f a h ga 6 g p p h a h f h then p cos h if b is a good polarization at f then b b hc ac will be a good polarization at h by induction p c contains a good polarization say b at h and b pc ac g c let f f g then b is a good polarization at f in g g there fore by the induction hypothesis there exists a good polarization which is contained in p case d u is a heisenberg algebra with center z 6 u let us define u f u u gu r f r let p p u k p r p r u then k cos r and p cos f let b be a good polarization at f in gc then there exists a good polarization b at f in gc such that b uc is a good polarization at u in uc and b uc is a good polarization at r in rc suppose p 6 g apply the induction process hypothesis to p to find a good polarization at p in pc 4 representations of of almost algebraic lie groups 175 otherwise g p p u if p g it s trivial if g 6 p let us denote the unipotent radical of p by v up p u then t u v u u z p therefore v is an ideal in g p u let us denotew zu v the centralizer of v in u then v w is a commutative proper ideal in z this is the case because in the opposite case v w z and as p modules there exists a p invariant subspace m in w such that m z w let f g be such a functional that f p p f m 0 by the pukanszky condition p cos f and m p f what is a contradiction so we can apply the case c to the proper ideal v w 6 z case e g p it is so clear now let us show that if dim g 0 one of the cases a e must be satisfied non a dim z 1 f z 6 0 u ug the unipotent radical non b u 6 z non c there is no characteristic ideal a g i e there is no such an ideal a that z a u g p a non d u is not a heisenberg algebra non e g 6 p we show that it must be therefore some contradiction really if u isn t a heisenberg algebra there exists some commutative ideal chosen of minimal dimension a g such that z a u we have u a z by minimality of dim a and p a z let up then v is contained in u because p u g and any ideal of p contained in v is an ideal in g therefore by non c there is no commutative ideal in v which is different from z so v is a heisenberg algebra with center z or it is z itself consider a cent u which is a commutative ideal in g and a v z a v u replacing a by a we assume that a a 0 suppose m be a subspace of a such that a m z g m m let f g be such a functional that f p p f m 0 by the pukanszky condition p cos f this is a contradiction to the fact that m is a non zero subspace in pf the proposition is then proved 4 2 irreducible representations returning to the almost algebraic lie group g g let us now consider a gf stable element p cos f and p the corresponding irreducible subgroup of g with lie algebra p and p 0 the analytic subgroup of g with the same lie algebra p p gf p 0 p the algebraic closure of p in g therefore p r is closed in g r and 176 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations the group p is open in the inverse image of p r in g and so it is a closed subgroup of g finally the triple p p is an almost algebraic group let us denote v upp the unipotent radical of pp v r the correspond ing simply connected subgroup of g r and therefore the corresponding analytic subgroup v of g is closed and simply connected from the pukan szky condition one deduces that pp gf v and that v v gf is simply connected theorem 4 1 i f is admissible if and only if p f p is admissible ii for every xg f there exists a unique xg p such that f x p x x gf iii the correspondence 7 in ii provides bijections xg f 1 1 xp p x irrg f 1 1 x irrp p proof some parts of this lemma were checked before the other ones are also not difficult to be checked theorem 4 2 the main result suppose that is finite let f x g p cos f is gf stable p f p and corresponds to in the bijection xg f 1 1 xp p then p x p and tgf ind g p t p p remark 4 1 the unipotent radical n ug of g is g invariant let f f n and p gf n p gf n p hf p 0 where p 0 is the analytic subgroup corresponding to p it is easy to see that p cos f p pp t p p ind p p t p p t pp t g 1 f 1 1 sftnf and tgf ind g p indp p t p p ind g p t p p remark 4 2 if p g cos f then tgf indggfg 0 t gfg 0 f 4 representations of of almost algebraic lie groups 177 proof of the theorem it is the same as in the proof of proposition 8 4 the induction on dimension of g can be deduced from the cases a e the assertions of the theorem are trivial in the start of induction where dim g 0 the case where dim g 0 is covered by the cases a e for theses cases the induction assumptions suppose that the theorem is proved for every lie algebra p 1 of dimension dim g 1 dim g case a this case is a particular case of a previous remark therefore tgf ind g gfa 0 t gfa 0 p case b we have z u cent g u ug in this case as in the proof of proposition b gf is a cartan subalgebra and p cos f is a parabolic subalgebra therefore pc contains a borel subalgebra b which is a good polarization at p f p and tgf ind g gf p 0 t gf p 0 p a more detailed proof of this case is contained in bouaziz work bo 1 about non connected reductive groups case c let us denote a h p g as in proposition 8 4 denote h gf h 0 p gf p 0 g gfg 0 therefore with xg f we can associate the representations th t p tg t p tg of h p g p g respectively we do not here precise the lower indices of these representations they are clear from the context from the induction assumption we have tg indg p t p indg p t p th indhp t p tg indgh t h indgh ind h p t p indgp t p case d let us introduce p p as in proposition 8 4 d define p gf p 0 p gf p 0 let t p t p t p tg be the corresponding representations in giving xg f consider the sub case p 6 g then by induction assumption we have t p indp p t p indp p t p therefore it s enough to prove that tg indgp t p let us denote r ug the unipotent radical r guu k p r k f k r f r k rr 0 k 0 r therefore by lemma 8 5 ii there exist r xr r to provide tr and k xk k to provide tk and tg indggu u tr su t u u by the induction hypothesis we have t r indrk t k 178 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations consider p u it is easy to see that p u u k and p p u u t p tk su t u u therefore tg indggu u ind r k t k sutuu indggu u ind r p t k sutuu indgp t p for the sub case p g 6 p it is enough to apply the case c case e g p is trivial the theorem is therefore proved 5 the trace formula and the plancher el formula this section is devoted to the two central theorems of harmonic analysis in the class of square integrable functions with integrable module trace formula and the planchere l formula we propose here only a quick review of the theory without technical proofs it seems to be more clear for our introduction to the theory 5 1 9 1 trace formula recall first of all a result of m duflo about his construction the representation tgf is of class gcr if and only if dim and f is locally closed recall that the representation tgf is traceable if for every smooth func tion on g with compact support c 0 g the operator tgf g tgf x x d r x is traceable and there exists a distribution noted trtf d g c 0 g such that trtgf g tr tgf x x d r x tr t g f for each x g we introduce j x 1 2 det sh adx 2 adx 2 1 2 1 d d 1 with d 12 dim and is the kirillov symplectic form on f therefore is a positive borelian measure on g concentrated on f g theorem 5 1 the character formula suppose that tf is a nor mal representation and that gf is nilpotent then tf is traceable if and 5 the trace formula and the plancher el formula 179 only if the measure is tempered in this case there exists a neighborhood of 0 in g in which the following formula holds j x 1 2 tr tf expx dim g exp 1 f x d f in sense of distributions i e for every c 0 g with compact support in the indicate neighborhood of 0 in g j 1 2 trtf exp dim g g exp 1 f x x d f dx dim g f d f where f g x exp 1 f x dx is the fourier transform of this theorem is the so called universal character formula proposed firstly by a a kirillov in the more simple case where dim 1 suppose now for simplicity g to be connected let us denote u gc the universal enveloping algebra z gc centu gc s gc the symmetric algebra on which g acts and i gc s gc g the set of g invariants it is well known that there exists an isomorphism a z gc i gc theorem 5 2 the infinitesimal character formula for every u z gc the operators tf u acting on c vectors is scalar tf u a u 1 f id remark 5 1 if the trace formula holds for all the orbits of maximal di mension then the laplace operators are just the operators of multiplication by the g invariants a u u z g it is true also the inverse assertion if the laplace operators tf u u z g are the operators of multiplication by invariants a u on the union of all the orbit of maximal dimension then for the orbit of this type the both sides of the trace formula are the distributions satisfying the same system of elliptic differential equations therefore they are coincided this is the relation between the universal character formula and the infinitesimal character formula 5 2 planchere l formula for unimodular groups let us consider an almost algebraic lie group g g with lie algebra g lieg de note u ug the unipotent radical j a subalgebra such that j cent g u j the analytic subgroup which is closed and central then j is also closed and central because its image in g is closed and central j 1 180 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations let us consider char j such that its differential d 1 1 j consider g ker 0 if necessary we can suppose that is injective dim j 1 and that if dim j 1 6 0 let us denote g t g t j mult and g f g f j we introduce the set of all the so called admissible functionals xg f xg f rf x x id and its subset x irrg f of the irreducible ones it is easy to see that the representation tf g if and only if x irrg f consider the set of smooth functions with compact support modulo j c 0 j g c 0 g yx y x y j x g let us denote dx the lebesgue measure on j g and dx the right invariant measure on g l 2 j g the completion of c 0 j g on which there is a natural right regular representation of g from now on suppose that g is unimodular let us recall that if is a unitary representation of g and l 2 j g then j g x x dx which is well defined with the assumption about uni modularity of g there exists a unique so called planchere l measure on g g j mult such that for every l 2 j g the so called it planchere l formula 1 g tr d holds remark 5 2 if the index gf gf 0 is finite the set x irr g f is also finite and the planchere l formula for l 2 gf 0 g ggf is 1 1 gf 0 gf xirr g f dim tr for c 0 gf 0 g g g f 6 bibliographical remarks 181 let us consider a regular f g i e gf is commutative and dim gf is minimal if its reductive factor sf in gf is of maximal possible dimension we say that f is strongly regular and note f g st it is not hard to prove that g st is an zariski open set in g and there exists a finite subset s 1 2 sn sf f g st of representatives of conjugacy classes consider now u g st g and a g invariant closed subset p u p strongly regular admissible f g it is not hard to see that if f p then f has a good polarization denote y yg f x irrg f f p x g the duflo s construction of representations gives us a map y g g f 7 tgf and a natural projection y g p g f 7 f theorem 5 3 planchere l formula if g is a unimodular almost algebraic lie group there exists a g invariant function on y with values in 0 such that for every c 0 j g xirr g f dim f gf 0 gf tr tf is a g invariant p f df measurable function on p and 1 p g f dm f where dm f is the corresponding to p f df quotient measure on p g and p f some function on p this theorem is the highest point of the duflo theory 6 bibliographical remarks the main idea about partially invariant holomorphly induced repre sentations are due to the author d 4 d 5 the analytic version of this construction of representations were due to m duflo du 1 du 2 182 7 partially invariant holomorphly induced representations chapter 8 reduction modification and superversion 1 reduction to the semi simple or reductive cases the aim of this appendix is to suggest a reduction of the procedure of multidimensional quantization to the indicate cases the geometric con struction is based on some ideas of m duflo about reduction by using a new comprehension of polarizations we can construct the representations of g starting from the solvable or unipotent co isotropic tangent distri butions we shall modify also the construction of partially invariant and holomorphly induced representations ind g l b 0 1 1 co isotropic tangent distributions as usually let us denote by g the lie algebra of g and by g its dual vector space the group g acts on g by the co adjoint representation some time k representation let f be an arbitrary point in an k orbit say f and gf the stabilizer at this point denote as usually gf its lie algebra rf the radical of gf and rf the corresponding analytic subgroup in g let sf be the semi simple component of gf in its cartan levi mal tsev s decomposition gf sf rf recall that we have had suppose that on the principle bundle gf g gf g a connection or the same a trivialization was fixed we have therefore an induced connection on the principal bundle sf rf g gf g this means in particular that we obtain a fixed decomposition of the tangent bundle into the corresponding horizontal and vertical parts t rf g t h rf g t v rf g in particular the kirillov s symplectic form of the k orbit f induces a non degenerate closed g invariant 2 form on t h rf g defined by the formula x y k x k y 183 184 8 reduction modification and superversion where k rf g gf g is the natural projection of the principal bundle sf rf g k gf g and k x k y are the lifted following the connection vector fields which are just sections of the tangent distribution t h rf g definition 1 1 a smooth tangent distribution l t rf g is called a solvable co isotropic distribution iff i l is integrable and g invariant ii l is adgf invariant iii l is horizontal i e l t h rf g iv l is co isotropic at f rf g such that k f f with respect to the form i e l f f l f where l f f is the set of all elements x t h rf g such that f x y 0 y l f it follows from the definition that if l is co isotropic at one point f rf g then so is it at all the other points of rf g theorem 1 1 there is a one to one correspondence between solvable co isotropic distributions and adgf invariant co isotropic lie sub algebras of g proof let l t rf g be a solvable co isotropic distribution ac cording to the frobenius theorem l is a sub algebra of the tangent subspace t hf rf g and then lf k l f is a sub algebra of tf g gf thus the inverse image b of the sub algebra l lf under the natural projection p g g gf tf is an adgf invariant sub algebra of g denote by bf the orthogonal complement of b in g with respect to the kirillov form f now we verify the co isotropic property of b indeed let x bf we have therefore f x y 0 y b p 1 l then f x y 0 y l lf x tf this means that f k x k y 0 y l f x t hf rf g 1 reduction to the semi simple or reductive cases 185 therefore x l f f l f since l is co isotropic it follows that x k x lf l thus x b p 1 l and bf b i e b is a co isotropic sub algebra suppose now that b g is an adgf invariant co isotropic sub algebra we define a smooth distribution l t by the formula lf p b lf k g lf f k g f by definition l is integrable g invariant and adgf invariant let us de note by l the horizontal lift of l into the tangent bundle t rf g i e l t h rf g and k l l then l is g invariant integrable hori zontal and adgf invariant now verify that l is co isotropic indeed for every x l f f we have f x y 0 y l f by definition this means that f k x k y 0 k y lf or f x y 0 y b y k y hence x bf b since b is co isotropic thus x lf k l f the last means that x k 1 lf t hf rf g l f then we have l f f l f the theorem is therefore proved we can do the same for the unipotent radical in place of the solvable radical for this aim suppose that g is an algebraic lie group let f g denote by uf the unipotent radical of gf and by uf its lie algebra let qf be the reductive component of gf in the cartan levi s decomposition gf qf uf using the qf principal bundle qf uf g gf g we can construct a non degenerate closed g invariant 2 form u on the horizontal component t h uf g of t uf g t h uf g t h uf g t v uf g definition 1 2 a smooth distribution l t uf g is called a unipotent co isotropic distribution if it is integrable g invariant adgf invariant horizontal and co isotropic at f with respect to u the following theorem can be proved by the similar arguments 186 8 reduction modification and superversion theorem 1 2 there is a one to one correspondence between the unipo tent co isotropic distributions and the adgf invariant co isotropic lie sub algebras of the lie algebra g 1 2 f polarizations definition 1 3 a point f of g is said to be r admissible the pre fix r is for solvable radical iff there exists a character i e a one dimensional representation f of rf such that its differential d f is the restriction 1 f rf denote by rx irrg f the set of all equivalent classes of irreducible unitary representations of gf such that the restriction of each of them to rf is a multiple of the character f then there is one to one correspondence between rx irrg f and the set of all equivalent classes of irreducible projective representations of the semi simple lie group rf gf we can do the same for the unipotent radical uf of gf definition 1 4 let g be an algebraic lie group we say that a func tional f g is u admissible iff there exists a character the differential of which is equal to the restriction of 1 f to the unipotent radical uf note that the lie algebra uf of the unipotent radical uf is unipotent so from the fact that in this case the exponential map is a diffeomorphism it follows that there exists such a character say f of uf with the differential equal to the restriction 1 f uf hence we can say that every point f g is u admissible denote by ux irrg f the set of all equivalent classes of irreducible uni tary representation of gf such that the restriction of each of them to uf is a multiple of the character f following the general theory of projective representations there exists a one to one correspondence between ux irrg f and the set of equivalent classes or irreducible projective unitary represen tations of the reductive group uf gf since the reductive component qf of gf has only a trivial covering we can identify ux irrg f with the subset of the set of all equivalent classes of irreducible unitary representations of qf with the aim to find out the irreducible unitary representations as usually we consider an important generalization of the notion of co isotropic distribution by going over to the complex domain this means that we define the co isotropic distribution l in such a way that l f is a complex subspace of the complexified horizontal part of the tangent bundle t hf rf g c then the theorems 1 1 1 2 rest true also for these complexes versions let l t hf rf g c be a co isotropic distribution such that l l and l l are the complexifications of some real distributions in this case 1 reduction to the semi simple or reductive cases 187 the corresponding following theorem a 1 2 complex sub algebra p gc satisfies the condition pf pf and pf pf are the complexifications of the real lie algebras hf pf g and mf pf pf g denote by hf and mf the corresponding analytic subgroups in g similarly we can construct also the unipotent co isotropic distribution l t h uf g c now suppose that the sub algebra h p g is algebraic co isotropic definition 1 5 a solvable resp unipotent co isotropic distribution l is called closed iff all the subgroups hf mf and the semi direct products h gf h f m gf m f are closed in g definition 1 6 let be some fixed irreducible unitary representation of gf in some hilbert space v such that its restriction to the radical rf resp unipotent radical uf is a multiple of the character f the triple l 0 is called a f solvable resp f unipotent polarization and l is called weakly lagrangian distribution iff 1 0 is an irreducible representation of the group h f in a hilbert space v such that a the restrictions are equal 0 gf hf l gf hf b the point 0 in the dual h f is fixed under the natural action of gf 2 is a representation of the complex lie sub algebra pf in v which satisfies e nelson s conditions and hf d 0 the differential of 0 proposition 1 1 suppose that f g is r admissible l is closed and l 0 is either a f solvable or l f unipotent polarization then 1 there exists a structure of mixed manifold of type k l on the space hf g where k dimg dimm l 1 2 dimm dimhf 2 there exists a unique irreducible representation of the subgroup h gf h f such that gf hf 0 and pf d 0 proof 1 the assertion follows from theorem 1 in kirillov s book 2 note that pf is invariant under the action ad of gf and gf acts naturally on the dual h f of the group hf from the assumptions 0 is fixed under this action of gf the formula x b 7 x 0 b x gf b hf define a representation of the product gf hf in the space v v v 188 8 reduction modification and superversion indeed since 0 is fixed under the natural action of gf in h f we have on one hand that x b x b x 0 b x 0 b xx x 1 0 b x 0 b xx 0 b 0 b xx 0 bb on the other hand by definition we have x b x b xx bb xx 0 bb it is clear that the representation is trivial on the kernel which is by definition the inverse image of the identity element of the surjection gf hf h gf hf x b 7 x b thus there exists a unique representation of the semi direct product h gf h f we denote this representation by obviously is an irreducible representation and gf hf 0 the proposition is proved 1 3 induced representations obtained from the solvable or unipo tent polarizations suppose that is the representation obtained from proposition 1 1 denote by ev g h v the smooth g bundle associ ated with the representation of h gf h f similarly let us consider the g bundles ev g gf gf v and e v g rf rf v for solvable radical or e v g uf uf for unipotent radical recall that to obtain the unitary representations we apply as usually the construction of unitarization considering the non unitary character h g of h the half density bundlem 1 2 g rf rf c and finally the tensor product e v e v m 1 2 the last is called the unitarized induced bundle according to the construction the unitarized induced g bundle e v can be identified with the set of pairs g v g v factorized by the following equivalence relation g v g v iff there exists an element h rf such that g hg and v h h v then we have a natural isomorphism of vector spaces e v c g rf s 7 fs where c g rf is the space of the v valued smooth functions on g satisfying the following equations f hg h h f g h rf g g 1 reduction to the semi simple or reductive cases 189 similarly we can obtain the unitarized induced g bundles ev and ev recall that a section s e v is said to be sf equivariant iff the corresponding v valued function fs satisfies the following equations fs hg h h fs g h rf g g denote by sf e v and sf hf e v the vector spaces of v valued sf equivariant or sf h f equivariant sections on the unitarized induced g bundle e v respectively proposition 1 2 there exist isomorphisms of vector spaces sf e v ev and sf hf e v ev these assertions follow directly from the definition of sf equivariant section and the construction of unitarized induced g bundles e v and ev fixing a connection on the principal bundle b g b g we obtain the corresponding connection on the unitarized induced g bundle e v using the natural projection gf g h g and the projection k rf g gf g we obtain the affine connection on the unitarized induced g bundle e v we have the following diagram ev ev e v g v d b g gf g k rf g g definition 1 7 a section s sf hf e v is called partially invari ant and partially holomorphic iff the corresponding function fs satisfies the following equations lx x d x f 0 x pf denote by h l 2 e v l 2 v g l h gf hf 0 the com pletion of the space of all the partially invariant and partially holomorphic square integrable sections of the unitarized induced g bundle e v the natural unitary g action on h is called the partially invariant and holo morphly induced representation of g and denote by ind g l h 0 190 8 reduction modification and superversion remark 1 1 suppose that the lie group g is algebraic and is the unitary representation obtained in proposition a 1 9 corresponding to a f unipotent polarization l we can then construct also the unitarized induced g bundles ev g h v ev g gf gf v and e v g uf uf v we also denote the resulted representation by ind g l 0 theorem 1 3 the representation ind g l 0 of the lie group g in the space h is equivalent to the representation of this group by the right translations in the space l 2 g l h 0 of the v valued square integrable functions on g satisfying the following equation in the sense of distributions 1 f hg h h f g h h gf hf g g 2 lx x d x f 0 x pf where lx is the lie derivation along the vector field x on g corresponding to x proof according to the definition the partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections s are identified with the v valued functions fs on g satisfying the equations 1 and 2 then the action of g g on a section s is identified with the action by right translation of the function fs 1 4 unitary representations arising in the reduction of the multidimensional quantization procedure as the model of the quan tum mechanical system we choose the space h l 2 e v l 2 g l h gf h f 0 the reduction of the multidimensional quantization procedure proposes the same quantization correspondence c l h f 7 f f 1 f where f is the covariant derivation associated with the connection on the g bundle e v we recall that it is defined by the following formula f l f 1 f where 1 is the connection form of l f is the lie derivation along f which is the horizontal lift of the strictly hamiltonian field f and f is the vertical component of f we have also the following result theorem 1 4 the following three conditions are equivalent 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 191 i the application f 7 f is a procedure of quantization ii curv 1 id iii d id where are the horizontal lifts of the strictly hamiltonian fields and is the lifted on 2 form we obtain therefore a representation of the lie algebra g by the per haps unbounded normal i e self commutative and admitting operator closure operators g l h x 7 x i f x where x g and fx c is the generating function of the hamiltonian field x corresponding to x if g is connected and simply connected we obtain a unitary represen tation t of g defined by the following formula t expx exp x x g we say that it is the representation arising from the reduction of the proce dure of multidimensional quantization 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering as it was remarked before to avoid the mackey s obstructions m duflo lifted every things to the z 2 z covering by using the metaplectic group mp g gf by using the technique of p l robinson and j h rawnsley ror we shall lift all things to the u 1 covering via the mpc structure i e the group extensions of type 1 u 1 mpc g gf sp g gf 1 in place of the metaplectic structure mp our purpose is to eliminate the mackey s obstructions of the arising projective representations to obtain linear ones for our induction procedure as in the z 2 z case for the bargman segal model we lift the character f of the connected compo nent of stabilizer gf to an fundamental character u 1 f of g u 1 f modify the notion of positive polarization and then construct the induced repre sentation a reduction of this construction is just proposed to construct representations starting from the so called semi simple or unipotent this appendix is a revised exposition of the works vui 1 vui 2 192 8 reduction modification and superversion 2 1 positive polarizations as usually let g be a connected and simply connected lie group g lieg its lie algebra and g the dual vector

lie algebra of this stabilizer f x y f x y which has its kernel ker f gf f the corresponding symplectic form on the quotient space g gf and also on its complexification g gf c and finally the kirillov

positive if the inequality is strict for each nonzero element x l let us recall the standard notations h p g p p g m p p g h gf h 0 andm gf m 0 where h 0 andm 0 are the analytic subgroups corresponding to the lie sub algebras h and m respectively suppose that our orbit is admissible i e there exists a perhaps projective representation u which is a multiple of the character f in restricting to the connected component of the stabilizer i e u expx f expx id exp i f x id for all x gf we shall now following r l robinson and j h rawnsley con struct the vector space of vacuum states on which the subgroup h acts for this reason let us consider a positive polarization l p gf c in the complexified symplectic space g gf c f denote by d h gf we have l l dc d m gf p p g gf where by definition d x g gf x y 0 y d 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 193 it is therefore true that d d i e d is an co isotropic subspace of the symplectic space g gf f by using the co isotropic reduction then f descends to a symplectic structure on the space d d denoted by f d we have d d m gf h gf m h thus there exists the symplectic structure on the space m h with the strictly positive polarization d of d d f d in the sense of p l robinson and j h rawnsley see ror 3 as follows consider the canonical projection d d c d d c d d l l dc p gf c hc gf c p hc proposition 2 1 the subgroup h acts on the bargman space h m h and preserves the one dimensional subspace of the so called vacuum states ev m h p hc proof since m h is a symplectic space we have a rigged hilbert space in the sense of i m gel fand as follows e mc hc h mc hc e mc hc in this case we have the fixed point set e mc hc p hc f e mc hc w v f 0 v p hc where w mc hc e mc hc defined by w v 1 1 v 2 f z dfz v 1 jv

see ror 4 the action of h on e mc hc p hc given by u h fd v u h fd v v mc hc in the neighborhood of the identity of subgroup h we have f expx fd exp i f x fd we may therefore regard the action of h on h mc hc given by the formula expx 7 exp i f x fdid therefore h conserves the one dimensional space e m h p hc the propo sition is proved 194 8 reduction modification and superversion proposition 2 2 f

detail 2 2 lifted characters recall that if gf 6 g the symplectic group sp g gf is non trivial and has the well known u 1 covering by the so called the mpc structure group mpc g gf which is an extension 1 u 1 mpc g gf sp g gf 1 see ror 2 for more detail each element u of this group mpc g gf can be presented by two parameters of type u g such that g sp g gf c 2 detcg 1 cg 12 g 1 g 1 in this 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 195 parameterization the surjection of the extension can be precised as the projection on the second factor mpc g gf sp g gf g g with kernel ker u 1 it is clear from the definition of the stabilizer gf of the point f in the k orbit f under the co adjoint action that the following assertion is true proposition 2 3 there exists a natural homomorphism j gf sp g g f proposition 2 4 there exists an extension g u 1 f of gf with help of u 1 such that the following diagram is commutative 1 u 1 gu 1 f j gf 1 id k j 1 u 1 mpc g gf sp g gf 1 proof we have the following diagram 1 u 1 gf 1 id j 1 u 1 mpc g gf s g gf 1 then from the well known five homomorphism lemma we can construct g u 1 f u g u j g a d g 1 where by definition u f mpc g gf with f sp g gf c 2 det 1 2 f 1 f 1 1 such that the desired diagram is commutative so we have u f f j g a d g 1 and the general form of the elements of the u 1 covering g u 1 f is a d g 1 g now we consider an k orbit f passing through f g we do not assume that the orbit is integral from the exact sequence of lie group 1 u 1 gu 1 f gf 1 we have the corresponding split exact sequence of lie algebras 0 u 1 gf liegf gf 0 therefore g u 1 f gf u 1 196 8 reduction modification and superversion definition 2 2 the k orbit f is called u 1 admissible iff there exists a unitary character u 1 f k g u 1 f s 1 t 1 c such that its differential is d u 1 f k x 1 f x k x gu 1 f gf u 1 for some foxed k z the character u 1 f u 1 f 1 is called fundamental it is clear that if k 0 the k orbit is integral some k orbit could not be integral but u 1 admissible proposition 2 5 in a neighborhood of identity of g u 1 f we have u 1 f a d g 1 g exp 1 f x where r 0 2 such that 2 det a d g 1 1 a d g 1 1 exp 1 as an operator

d dt t 0 to the expression u 1 f adexp tx exp tx in combin ing with the previous proposition we have these formulae it is easily now to construct the u 1 covering hu 1 g u 1 f h 0 for the polarization group h gf h 0 starting from the homomorphism pr 1 h gf h 0 gf and the u 1 covering 1 u 1 gu 1 f j gf 1 such that the following diagram is commutative 1 u 1 gu 1 f h 0 gf h 0 1 id pr 1 pr 1 1 u 1 g u

definition 2 3 a unitary representation ofgf in a separable hilbert space v such that its restriction to the connected component gf u 1 0 is a multiple of the character u 1 f is said to be fundamental fix one of this type representation the triple p 0 is called a positive u 1 f polarization iff 1 gf c p gc 2 p is adgf invariant 3 h p p g p g and m p p g are real lie sub algebras of g 4 h 0 m 0 h m

u 1 admissible the set x g f of fundamental representations is then non empty let be an irreducible fun damental representation and let p 0 is a u 1 f polarization then there exists a unique unitary irreducible representation of the u 1 covering such that g u 1 f j u 1 f and d h u 1 2 3 induced representations we introduce the following conven tion for the trivial functional f 0 0 g the

products g h hu 1 g gf g u 1 f gu 1 in the category of principal bundles proof by fixing a connection on the principal bundle h g h g we have the projection map pr g h therefore by fixing a trivialization we can construct the commutative diagram 1 u 1 gu 1 j g 1 id p r pr 1 u 1 hu 1 h 1 the rest of the proposition is trivial remark 2 2 from two previous isomorphisms we have a principal hu 1 bundle over h g and a principal gu 1 f bundle over gf g and a projection between two bases hu 1 gu 1 gu 1 f gu 1 h g gf g where is the natural projection from gf g onto h g it is therefore natural to consider the bundle ev gu 1 hu 1 v over h g associated with the representation of hu 1 from proposition a 2 10 the inverse image of this bundle ev is a vector bundle over the orbit f gf g it is easy to see that in the category of vector bundles ev and gu 1 gu 1 f g u 1 f v are equivalent denote by ev rho the space of smooth sections of the bundle ev the connection on the principal hu 1 bundle hu 1 gu 1 h g induces a connection on the principal g u 1 f bundle g u 1 f g u 1 gf g we then obtain an affine connection on the associated bundle ev gu 1 g u 1 f g u 1 f v recall that there is a one to one correspondence between the u 1 f polarizations of type p 0 and the integrable adgf invariant closed weakly lagrangian tangent distributions l we put by definition l ev s ev s 0 l the naturalg action on this subspace of sections is denoted by ind g p 0 and will be called also as the partially invariant and holomorphly induced representation 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 199 remark 2 3 now we show that with the technique developed in ror one can obtain also these induced representations first we construct a canonical representation of the metaplectic group mpc g gf for every v g gf consider the unitary operator w v defined by w v f z exp 1 4 2 z w f z v f h gc gf c z gc gf c the map w g gf auth gc gf c is an irreducible projective unitary representation of the vector group g gf with multiplier exp 1 1 f this is therefore the canonical projective rep resentation of the symplectic group sp g gf and gives the corresponding unitary representation of the u 1 covering group mpc g gf called the complex metaplectic representation using the rigged structure e gc gf c h gc gf c e gc gf c we can compute the corresponding representation w of g gf c on the space e gc gf c as follows w v 1 1 v 2 f z dfz v 1 jv 2 1 2 z v 1 jv 2 f z z v 1 v 2 g gf where f e gc gf c for convenience in what follows we write p for the principal g u 1 f bundle g u 1 f g u 1 gf g by using the homomorphism k gu 1 f mpc g gf and the metaplectic representation mpc g gf aut e gc g c we have the associated with the representation k vector bundle with the typical fiber e gc gf c for a fundamental representation v of g u 1 f the tensor product k defines a representation of g u 1 f in the space v e gc gf c denote by e v p the vector bundle associated with the representation k of the typical fiber gu 1 f of the principal bundle p proposition 2 8 for each f f there exists a canonical linear map w f tf c end e v p f such that w f x w f y 1 f x y x y tf c 200 8 reduction modification and superversion proof it enough to prove the commutation relation at one point f because at the other points it is transported in changing by conjugations what do not change the first because the representation is fundamental its restriction to gf u 1 0 is just a multiple of the fundamental character u 1 f the commutation relation at f is therefore deduced from a direct computation remark 2 4 we assume that our k orbit is of dimension dim f 2 m recall see ror that the line bundle kl m l is a complex line sub bundle of the bundle m t c with the basis vector section kl put e v p l f f e v p f w f x f 0 x l f then e v p l is a tensor product of the complex line bundle e p l with the bundle ev p associated with the fundamental representation of the fiber g u 1 f of p it is not hard to prove the following result proposition 2 9 there is a canonical isomorphism of the complex bundles e v p l e p l kl ev p remark 2 5 in our multidimensional situation by putting q p l e v p l kl we have then q p l ev p e p l kl hence q p l 2 ev p ev p e p l e p l kl kl taking proposition a 2 16 into account we get q p l 2 ev p e v p l e v p l kl kl ev p 2 kl as in the above section on ev p there is a connection and i i lie provides a connection on ev p 2 and therefore defines uniquely a connection l in q p l denote by l q p l the space of all the sections of q p l the covariant derivatives of which vanish along the directions of l l s 0 l we consider its subspace of sections say s with compact support square module s s l then in this subspace we can consider the scalar product 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 201 of type s t l the completion of this subspace with respect to this scalar product is a hilbert space denoted hl we summarize the obtained result as follows theorem 2 1 with any u 1 f polarization p 0 there exists a natural unitary representation of g in hl denoted by ind g p 0 2 4 multidimensional quantization as a model of the quantum system we choose the hilbert space hl as in the previous subsection we shall use the bundle q p l ev p e p l kl to construct the procedure of quantization v e gc gf c l kl ev p e p l kl l gf g we define the quantization procedure on this u 1 covered situation as fol lows c l hl f f f 1 l f where l hl is the space of perhaps unbounded hermitian operators admitting operator closure on hl and l f is the covariant derivation associated with the connection l on the bundle q p l recall that l f l f 1 f the first summand is the well known lie derivation and the second sum mand is the connection form by a similar argument as in previous section we have the following result proposition 2 10 the following three conditions are equivalent i d l 1 id ii curv l 1 id iii the correspondence f 7 f is a procedure of quantization remark 2 6 having this procedure of quantization we obtain also the corresponding representation of the lie algebra g g l hl x 7 x 1 f x where x g and fx c is the generating function of the correspond ing hamiltonian field x corresponding to x if g is connected and simply 202 8 reduction modification and superversion connected we obtain the corresponding representation t of g t expx exp x x g it can be also prove that liex ind g p x x g 2 5 u 1 covering of the radicals and the semi simple or re ductive data we shall now reduce the procedure of multidimensional quantization on u 1 coverings of the stabilizers to the one with the semi simple or reductive data following an idea of m duflo and another one of p l robinson and j h rawnsley as usually let us denote rf the solvable radical and uf the unipo tent radical of the lie algebra gf of stabilizer gf respectively denote by apu 1 g the set of all f in g which are u 1 admissible and positive well polarizable x u 1 irr f the set of all equivalent classes of fundamental irreducible unitary representations of g u 1 f such that the restriction of each of them to gf u 1 0 is a multiple of the fundamental character u 1 f then the elements xu 1 irr f are in a one to one correspondence with the projective representations of the discrete group gf 0 gf recall that the set of the u 1 data is defined as x u 1 g f f apu 1 g xu 1 irr f for every u 1 data f x u 1 g we can choose a u 1 f polarization p then we can construct the corresponding represen tation of the u 1 covering hu 1 g u 1 f h 0 and finally induce to obtain a unitary representation of g we reduce here the consideration to the case of semi simple or reductive groups for this aim let us denote sf the semi simple component of gf in its cartan levi mal tsev s decom position gf sf rf due to the fact that the principal sf bundle sf rf g k gf g is locally trivial there exists a connection i e a trivialization on it therefore the tangent vector fields on the base gf g can be uniquely lifted to the corresponding horizontal vector fields on rf g then the kirillov 2 form of our orbit gf g can be lifted a non degenerate closed g invariant 2 form on the horizontal component t h rf g defined by the formula f x y f k x k y for all the horizontally lifted vector fields x y where f rf g f k f 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 203 the symplectic group sp t hf rf g f has also a u 1 covering mpc t hf rf g f 1 u 1 mpc t hf rf g k sp t hf rf g 1 proposition 2 11 there is a natural group homomorphism j from the solvable radical rf and a natural group homomorphism from the unipotent radical uf of gf to sp t h f rf g and therefore a metaplectic represen tation of rf and one of uf proof to prove it is enough to remark that due to lifting we have k t h f rf g tk f g gf and every element g rf gf acts on the tangent space tk f g gf by the adjoint action k g a d g 1 the same argument is true for the unipotent radical uf corollary 2 1 there are natural u 1 coverings r u 1 f and u u 1 f of rf and uf respectively proof it s enough to use the well known five homomorphisms lemma from homological algebra r u 1 f g j g k 1 a d g 1 k where sp t hf rf g c 2 det 1 2 1 1 1 therefore every element of r u 1 f is of type a d g 1 g return now to the situation of the k orbit we have a short exact sequence of lie groups 1 u 1 ru 1 f rf 1 and therefore a short exact sequence of lie algebras 0 u 1 ru 1 f lier u 1 f rf 0 thus as vector space r u 1 f rf u 1 moreover in ror 5 it was shown that it is the direct sum of lie algebras definition 2 4 a point f g is called r u 1 for solvable radical case or u u 1 for unipotent radical case admissible iff there exists a unitary character u 1 f k r u 1 f s 1 t 1 c 204 8 reduction modification and superversion with the differential d u 1 f k x 1 f x k where x ru 1 f k z is some fixed integral number if k 0 r u 1 admissibility is coincided with the previously defined r admissibility and u u 1 admissibility is coincided with u admissibility if k 1 we say that the lifted character u 1 f u 1 f 1 is fundamental denote by rx u 1 irr f resp ux u 1 irr f the set of all equivalent classes of the so called fundamental irreducible unitary representations of g u 1 f such that the restriction of each of them to r u 1 f resp u u 1 f is a multiple of the fundamental character u 1 f definition 2 5 a smooth complex tangent distribution l t rf g c is called a positive solvable tangent distribution iff i l is an integrable and g invariant sub bundle of t h rf g c ii l is invariant under the action ad of gf iii for each f rf g the fiber l f is a positive polarization of the symplectic vector space t h rf g c f i e dim l f 1 2 dimt hf rf g f x y 0 x y t hf rf g c 1 f x x 0 x t hf rf g c we say that the distribution l is strictly positive iff the inequality is strict for every non zero x l f it is easily to see that if l is a positive solvable distribution then the inverse image p p 1 lf where lf k l f for f k f under the natural projection p gc gc gf c is a positive solvable polarization in gc at f suppose that l t h rf g c is a positive solvable distribution such that l l and l l are the complexifications of some real distributions in this case the corresponding complex sub algebra p p 1 k l f satisfies the following conditions p p and p p are the complexifications of the real lie sub algebras h p g and m p p g denote by h 0 and m 0 the corresponding analytic subgroups 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 205 definition 2 6 a positive solvable distribution l is called closed iff the subgroups h 0 m 0 and the semi direct product h rf h 0 and m rf m 0 are closed in g in what follows we assume that l is closed it is also easy to prove the following proposition 2 12 in a neighborhood of identity of r u 1 f we have u 1 f a d g 1 g exp 1 f x where r 0 2 such that 2 det a d g 1 1 a d g 1 1 exp 1 as an operator acting on the hilbert space hv mc hc it has the following integral l 2 kernel u z w exp 1 f x 1 2 z w 1 4 w w z w mc hc according to the definitions h 0 is a normal subgroup in h and there is the adjoint action of rf on h 0 moreover we have the projection epimor phism j r u 1 f rf thus r u 1 f acts on h 0 hence we can define the semi direct product r u 1 f h 0 and the following commutative diagram 1 u 1 ru 1 f h 0 rf h 0 1 id pr 1 pr 1 1 u 1 ru 1 f rf 1 where by pr 1 be denote the projection map on the first factor thenh u 1 r u 1 f h 0 is the u 1 covering of h rf h 0 it has h u 1 the corresponding lie algebra denote as usually by h u 1 0 the inverse image of h 0 in h u 1 under the u 1 covering projection map let us say that a fixed irreducible unitary representation of g u 1 f in a separable hilbert space v is fundamental iff its restriction to r u 1 f is a multiple of the fundamental character u 1 f definition 2 7 the triple l 0 is said to be a solvable u 1 f polarization and l is a weakly lagrangian distribution iff 206 8 reduction modification and superversion i 0 is an irreducible representation of the subgroup h u 1 0 in a hilbert space v v v such that 0 ru 1 f hu 1 0 ii is a representation of the complex lie algebra p u 1 in v such that h u 1 d 0 the corresponding infinitesimal representation of the lie algebra it is easy to prove also an analogue of the proposition a 2 10 as follows proposition 2 13 if f is r u 1 admissible l 0 is a u 1 f solvable polarization then there exists a unique irreducible unitary represen tation of hu 1 in v such that r u 1 f and d h u 1 it is reasonable to remark that the same can be done for the unipotent radical in place of the solvable radical we have an analogous reduction of the procedure of quantization on the u 1 coverings 2 6 induction from semi simple data let f is a semi simple u 1 data i e f is a r u 1 admissible therefore there exists the fun damental character u 1 f of the u 1 covering r u 1 f of rf and is a fun damental representation of g u 1 f in the sense that its restriction to the u 1 covering r u 1 f of the radical rf of gf is a multiple of the fundamen tal character u 1 f recall that for the element f 0 0 g the stabilizer is the whole group gf g it is reasonable to put mp c g gf 0 f 0 u 1 and g u 1 g u 1 fixing a connection on h g h g we have the corresponding ones on gf g gf g and rf g rf g respectively passing to the u 1 covering of the leaves i e the structural group are lifted to the corresponding u 1 covering we have the following isomorphisms between the total spaces of principal bundles gu 1 gu 1 g u 1 gu 1 we have a principal hu 1 bundle on h g a principal gu 1 f bundle on the orbit a principal r u 1 f bundle on on rf g and two homomorphisms 2 multidimensional quantization and u 1 covering 207 between them as follows hu 1 gu 1 g u 1 f g u 1 r u 1 f g u 1 b g gf g k rf g where and k are the natural projections with the fundamental representation of hu 1 we can construct the induced bundles ev ev g u 1 f e v r u 1 f over the bases h g gf g rf g respectively in the category of smooth vector bundles k ev k ev g u 1 f and e v r u 1 f are equivalent the fixed connection induces a connection on the principal bundle g u 1 f gu 1 gf g and a affine connection on the associated bundle ev g u 1 f by analogy we obtain also an affine connection on e v r u 1 f we put sl sf e v ru 1 f s ssf e v r u 1 f s 0 l where ssf e v r u 1 f is the vector space of sf equivariant sections of the bundle e v r u 1 f the natural action of g on this space of sections is denoted by ind g l 0 and is called the reduction of the partially invariant and holomorphly induced representation it is easily to unitarize and do this representation to the unitary one on the completion hl of ssf e v r u 1 f as above for our convenience in what follows we write p for the princi pal bundle r u 1 f g u 1 rf g by using the well defined homomor phism l r u 1 f mpc t hf rf g and the complex metaplectic representation mpc t hf rf g end e t hf rf g we have the bundle associated with the principal bundle p via the homo morphism l consider now the tensor product representation u 1 f of the fiber r u 1 f denote by e v r u 1 f p the corresponding associated bundle theorem 2 2 with every solvable f polarization l 0 there exists a natural unitary representation of g in the hilbert space hl 208 8 reduction modification and superversion proof according to proposition a 2 14 and since k is the linear lifting isomorphism there exists for each f rf g a canonical linear map wf t h f rf g c end e v r u 1 f p f such that wf x wf y 1 f x y x y t hf rf g c we assume that dimr t h f rf g 2 m the top exterior power kl is a complex line bundle in mt hf ff g with the basis vector kl putting e v r u 1 f p l f e v r u 1 f p f wf x 0 x l f then e v r u 1 f p l f e v r u 1 f p l f is the tensor product of the complex line bundle e p l with the associ ated bundle ev r u 1 f p as in proposition a 2 16 there is a canonical isomorphism of complex bundles e v r u 1 f p l e p l kl ev r u 1 f p putting q p l e v r u 1 f p l kl we have as in the previous subsection q p l 2 ev r u 1 f p 2 kl we have also the affine connection on the associated bundle ev r u 1 f p the affine connection l on the associated bundle q p l denote by sl sf q p l the space of the sf equivariant sections of q p l such that l s 0 l define hl s sl sf q p l s s l c 0 gf g and denote also by hl the completion with respect to this norm the natural unitary representation of g in the hilbert space is the required representation 3 globalization over u 1 coverings 209 2 7 a reduction of the multidimensional quantization proce dure on u 1 covering we use the associated bundle q p l ev r u 1 f p e p l kl to realize our reduction of the quantization procedure on u 1 covering define c l hl f 7 f f 1 l f where l hl is the space of all perhaps unbounded hermitian operators admitting operator closure on the space hl and l f is the covariant deriva tion associated with the connection l on the g bundle q p l recall that by definition l f l f 1 f where 1 is the form of connection and l f is the lie derivation along f which is the horizontal lift of the strictly hamiltonian vector field f corresponding to f it is easy also to check the following results proposition 2 14 the following three conditions are equivalent i d l id ii curv l 1 id v iii the application f 7 f is a procedure of multidimensional quantization theorem 2 3 if one of the previous condition holds with every solv able u 1 f polarization l 0 there is a natural representation de noted ind g l 0 of g in the hilbert space of quantum states hl which is the completion of the space of of partially invariant partially holomorphic sf invariant sections of the induced bundle e v r u 1 f p with respect to the indicated scalar product l of sections the lie derivation of this representation is just the representation of lie algebra g associated with the reduction of the reduction of quantization procedure on u 1 covering liex ind g l 0 x 1 f x x g 3 globalization over u 1 coverings in the previous sections we have realized representations in section spaces of the induced bundles it is well known that this is not enough in some situations say the discrete series representations of semi simple 210 8 reduction modification and superversion lie groups is better to be realized in l 2 cohomologies w schmid and j a wolf scw proposed an algebraic model of the geometric multidimensional quantization to realize the discrete series representations of semi simple lie groups using the z 2 z covering of the stabilizers of k orbits using the u 1 covering we can also give an algebraic version of the multidimensional quantization procedure in this section we expose a revised version of the work do 1 do 2 3 1 classical constructions and three geometric complexes let g be a connected linear semi simple lie group g lieg its lie algebra and g its dual space recall that g acts on g via the adjoint representation ad and on g by the co adjoint i e contragradient representation let f g and gf be the stabilizer of this point suppose that h gf is a cartan sub algebra this is the case for example for the discrete series representations in this case the functional f g is admissible and well polarizable then the stabilizer group h gf at this point f is a cartan subgroup of g it is reasonable to suppose that it is u 1 admissible i e there exists a unitary character said to be fundamental u 1 f such that d u 1 f 1 f x x h u 1 c let b be a closed positive polarization in gc it is well known that b is therefore a borel sub algebra of gc containing the cartan sub algebra h let be some fixed fundamental irreducible unitary representation of hu 1 g u 1 f such that its restriction to h u 1 0 is a multiple of the funda mental character u 1 f we can then consider the associated bundle ev g u 1 hu 1 v h g f suppose that dimc f m recall that in the orbit f there is a nat ural complex structure related with the polarization b let cq ev denote the sheaf of differential forms of type o q on f h g with coefficients in the induced bundle ev each differential form of this type is a section of the bundle ev qn over the base h g where by definition n h g is the homogeneous vector bundle with the fiber n b h and n is its dual denote by o ev the sheaf of germs of partially holomorphic c sections of ev that are annihilated by the action of n u 1 c then we have a sequence of sheaves 0 on ev i c 0 ev e v e v cm ev 0 where the map i is induced by the inclusion of the space of partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections of ev into the space of smooth sections 3 globalization over u 1 coverings 211 and the maps e v are induced by the usual differential operator mapping a 0 q form into a 0 q 1 form therefore we have the corresponding sequence of global section spaces 0 c h g on ev c h g c 0 ev c h g cm ev 0 and this sequence of abelian groups form a cochain complex denoted by c h g ev n ev for the cohomology groups of this cochain complex it is easy to prove the following analogue of the well known dol bault s theorem proposition 3 1 there are canonical isomorphisms of between this type cohomology groups hp c h g ev n hp h g on ev p 0 where the right handside is the sheaf cohomology group of the space h g of degree p with coefficients in on ev we refer to this complex as the first let us now consider the second complex it is easy to see that the dif ferential e v can be extended to the hyperfunctions section of the sheaves so we have the second complex c h g ev n ev let us denote by x the flag variety of the borel sub algebras of gc it is a well defined complex manifold the g orbit g b of b is a g invariant analytic submanifold of the complex manifold x therefore s has also the structure of cr manifold i e cauchy riemann structure since the subgroup h gf normalizes b we have a natural g invariant fibration h g s g b b g x recall that there is a unique fundamental irreducible representation v of the u 1 covering bu 1 hu 1 b 0 of b h b 0 such that hu 1 then the bundle ev h g can be considered as the push up of the bundle ev s b g or equivalently the first one push down to the section one we obtain as in suw the cauchy riemann complex c s ev ns s where ns t 0 1 s the second com ponent of the decomposition of the tangent bundle into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts with respect to the complex structure defined by n n n denote by xu 1 the flag variety of u 1 invariant borel sub algebras of g u 1 c we obtain the natural projection x x u 1 x 212 8 reduction modification and superversion by using the gauss decomposition g k b for some maximal compact subgroup of g we have b g bu 1 k bu 1 note also that k bu 1 acts on the flag variety xu 1 let us denote su 1 k bu 1 b u 1 c bu 1 k bu 1 the orbit passing through b u 1 c in xu 1 then there exists a diffeo morphism of su 1 onto s by projection x x u 1 x we can make the homogeneous induced bundle xev su 1 and we have the complex c su 1 xev n su 1 su 1 where by definition nsu 1 xns and su 1 is induced from the cr operator s the bundle xev pn su 1 s u 1 b g pull back to the trivial bundle on g so we have an isomorphism of the complexes c su 1 xev n du 1 su 1 c g v n n n n n n bu 1 n n n for relative bu 1 equivariant cohomology of the pair n n n with the hyperfunctions coefficients a section s c su 1 xev pnsu 1 is said to behu 1 invariant iff s hx h s x h hu 1 x su 1 b g let us denote by c hu 1 su 1 xev pnsu 1 the space ofhu 1 invariant partially holomorphic c sections of c su 1 xev pnsu 1 we have a canonical isomorphism between the vector spaces c hu 1 su 1 xev pnsu 1 c s ev pn s we see that the fibration h g su 1 has euclidean space fibers by applying the well known poincare lemma to those fibers we see that the inclusion of the complex c g v n n n n n bu 1 n n n into the complex c h g ev n ev induces an isomorphism of the corresponding cohomology theories the following result is therefore proved proposition 3 2 there are canonical isomorphisms between the coho mology theories hp c h g ev n hp c hu 1 s u 1 ev n su 1 hp c g n n n n n bu 1 3 globalization over u 1 coverings 213 now we consider the third complex let us denote by s the germ of s in x then the bundle ev s has a unique holomorphic g equivalent extension e v s x and we obtain an analogue of the dolbeault complex c s e v t 0 1 x with coefficients that are hyperfunctions on s with support in s similarly we have also the vector bundle x e v s u 1 xu 1 over the u 1 covering and then obtain the complex c s u 1 x e v t 0 1 xu 1 u 1 by using the canonical isomorphism c hu 1 s u 1 x e v t 0 1 xu 1 c s e v t 0 1 x we havec also the following result about cohomology of the third complex proposition 3 3 there is a natural isomorphism of cohomology groups hp c hu 1 s u 1 x e v t 0 1 xu 1 hps s o e v where the right hand side is the well known local cohomology along s 3 2 isomorphisms of cohomologies we fix a basic datum h b as in the previous subsection denote by y the variety of ordered cartan sub algebras as homogeneous gc space we have y hc gc where gc is the adjoint group of gc and hc is the connected subgroup corresponding to the lie algebra hc since hc normalizes b there is a natural projection p y x with fiber p 1 b exp n let sy g h y be the g orbit of the base point in y we have p sy s with fibers of type exp n g exp n n g remark that by definition n b h g for some fixed inclusion related with the connection on the principal bundle then sy is a real form of the complex manifold y and u codimr s is the dimension of fibers of the projection p sy s pushing up to the u 1 covering of the map p y x we have the following commutative diagram y u 1 pu 1 xu 1 x x y p x where x and y are the natural projections let us denote by ty x the complexified relative tangent bundle of the fibration p y x and ty x t 0 1 y x t 0 1 y x its decomposition into the subbundles of holomorphic and antiholomorphic directions we have also angc invariant isomorphisms p tx ty x ty 214 8 reduction modification and superversion which is compatible with the comple structure and the lie bracket we obtain also the complex c sy p e v t 1 0 y x let s u 1 y k b u 1 h u 1 c y u 1 be the orbit passing through h u 1 c we see that su 1 y sy by using the previous diagram we have the complex c s u 1 y p u 1 x e v t 1 0 y x u 1 u 1 where by definition t 1 0 y x u 1 x t 1 0 y x and u 1 x we see that ty x is a bundle with typical fiber n b u 1 c h u 1 c and x e v is also a bundle with hu 1 module v as the typical fiber it is not hard to see that the complex c hu 1 su 1 pu 1 x e v t 1 0 y x u 1 u 1 coincides with the complex c h g ev ev we obtain therefore proposition 3 4 there are canonical isomorphisms between algebraic g modules hp c h g ev n hp c hu 1 s u 1 v ev n su 1 hp us s o e v we fix a cartan involution of g such that k k then the cartan subgroup h gf can be decomposed into the direct product h t a such that the corresponding lie algebra decomposition h t a is the root decomposition of h into the 1 eigenspaces of the corresponding endomor phism h put a exp a g consider the orbit s g b x where b is as usually a fixed borel sub algebra containing h we can suppose for instance that b bmax is maximally real this condition will be removed by the so called change of polarizations we have then smax g bmax h bmax consider a parabolic subgroup p ma nh m a nh where m m i e m is a maximal compact semi simple subgroup of p and b bmax p liep the fibrations s smax and smax p g induce a fibration s p g since su 1 s we obtain therefore a fiberation su 1 p g let c p g s u 1 be the sheaf of germs of hyper functions on su 1 that are c along the fibers of su 1 p g then c p g s u 1 defines a complex of sheaves c p g s u 1 xev pn su 1 of germs ofhu 1 equivariant sections of the bundle xev pn su 1 s u 1 3 globalization over u 1 coverings 215 with coefficients in c p g s u 1 taking global sections we have a sub complex c p g s u 1 xev n su 1 su 1 of c hu 1 su 1 xev n su 1 su 1 proposition 3 5 the inclusion c p g s u 1 xev n su 1 su 1 c hu 1 su 1 xev n su 1 su 1 induces isomorphisms of cohomology groups proof applying the usual dolbeault lemma and the standard ar gument on hyperfunctions we see that the sheaves c p g s u 1 xev n su 1 and c hu 1 su 1 xev n su 1 are soft and the inclusion of c p g s u 1 xev n su 1 into c hu 1 su 1 xev n su 1 induces isomorphisms of cohomology sheaves on the other hand it follows easily that the inclusion of sheaves induces an isomorphism of hyperfunction coefficient cohomology since both com plexes consist of soft sheaves the hyperfunction coefficient cohomology is just the cohomology of the associated complexes of global sections the proposition is therefore proved remark that the theory of hyperfunctions with values in a reflexive banach space is developed exactly in the same way as the one for complex valued hyperfunctions by a similar argument as scw 7 we obtain the following result proposition 3 6 the vector spaces c p g s u 1 xev pnsu 1 have natural fre chet topologies on those topologies su 1 is continuous and the natural actions of g are fre chet representations 3 3 maximal real polarizations and change of polarizations recall now some notions from ror definition 3 1 an admissible fre chet g module is said to have prop erty mg iff it is the maximal globalization of its underlying harish chandra module a complex of fre chet g modules has property mg iff its differential d has closed range and each cohomology group hp c db is admissible of finite length as g module and has property mg given a basic datum h b we say that the corresponding homo geneous vector bundle ev su 1 has the property mg iff the asso ciated partially smooth cauchy riemann complex c p g s u 1 xev nsu 1 su 1 has property mg let us denote hp su 1 ev hp c hu 1 s u 1 xev n su 1 proposition a 3 5 shows that hp su 1 ev is calculated by a fre chet com plex then we can consider the fre chet subcomplex hp su 1 ev k of 216 8 reduction modification and superversion k finite forms in this fre chet complex in particular we can define mor phisms hp su 1 ev k ap g h b where ap g h b hp cfor h g ev n su 1 k are the well known harish chandra modules for g then hp su 1 ev will be the globalization of ap g h b if the homomorphism hp su 1 ev k ap g h b are really isomorphisms recall another notion from ror definition 3 2 the bundle ev su 1 is said to have property z if the homomorphisms hp su 1 ev k ap g h b are isomorphisms i e we have a globalization note that the functional f h can be identified with the functional f h u 1 c such that f u 1 c 0 i e we have an inclusion h h u 1 c condition a 3 9 there exists a positive root system and a number c 0 such that if the bundle ev su 1 is irreducible d u 1 f h h r hr the restriction of to the real form hc on which roots take real values and r c for all then the bundle ev su 1 has both properties mg and z proposition 3 7 fix a pair h b if the condition a 3 9 holds then for every datum h b the associated bundle ev su 1 has both prop erties mg and z proof we can always reduce the argumentation to the case where the fiber bundle is irreducible because if the assertion of the property is not true it s must be for some irreducible component choose r 0 as in ror we see that satisfies the condition a 3 9 suppose 0 h r 0 0 thus the bundle ev su 1 has both properties mg and z fix such a 0 and put s 1 sup r 0 r 0 r implies mg and z for ev su 1 we see that s 1 r 0 this number s 1 must be infinite because in other case we could choose s 2 s 1 with the same properties see ror for more detail recall the notation s g b x and u codimr s 3 globalization over u 1 coverings 217 proposition 3 8 the properties mg and z satisfy for every max imally real polarization b proof property z recal that b p for some cuspidal parabolic subgroup p m a nh m k h t a with t h k a exp a g then s u 1 h nh g and su 1 is a fibration over p g with holomorphic fibers t m let us suppose what we can always do that the fiber bundle ev su 1 is irreducible d u 1 f h h and u 1 t u 1 f tu 1 where tu 1 is the u 1 covering i e the inverse image of t in hu 1 we see that d u 1 t t r t suppose that the scalar curvature of the bundle ev t m is sufficiently negative i e less than some negative number then it is not hard to check the isomorphism hp t m ev t m k m ap m t b m u 1 t these m k m modules are non zero just for p dimc t k m let zp and bp denote the corresponding spaces of closed and exact respectively k m finite ev valued 0 p forms om t m and zp and bp denote the corresponding spaces with smooth replaced by formal power series for the coefficients it is also not hard to check by using the taylor series decomposition that as m k m modules bp zp bp zp applying the poincare lemma to the fibers of the fibration nh h g h nh g su 1 we see that ap g h b u 1 f can be com puted from the complex of left k finite righk m invariant functions from k to the zuckerman complex for t m i e it is induced from ap m t b m u 1 t thus applying the functor ind to both the sides of hp t m ev t m k m ap m t b m u 1 t we have isomorphism hp su 1 ev k ap g h b u 1 f property mg we can also here suppose that the fiber bundle ev su 1 is irreducible d u 1 f h h let 1 1 t g is in the interior of the negative weyl chamber of the root system m t we see that hp su 1 ev hp c p g s u 1 xev nsu 1 218 8 reduction modification and superversion vanishe except in degree p 0 dimc t k m and in this dimension indgmanh e 1 hp 0 su 1 ev the induced module hp 0 su 1 ev has finite length because is irre ducible and its restriction to a is a multiple of u 1 as in ror lemma 9 8 we see that this induced module hp 0 su 1 ev satisfies the property mg and the operator su 1 has closed range in particular it inherits a fre chet topology from the space c p g s u 1 ev p 0 n su 1 this com pletes the proof of the proposition it is therefore proved for every maximally real polarization the following result theorem 3 1 for any maximally real polarization b and any basic da tum h b u 1 f there are topological isomorphisms between fre chet g modules hp c h g ev n hp c hu 1 s u 1 xev n su 1 hp u s o e v which are canonically and topologically isomorphic to the action of g on the maximal globalization of ap g h b u 1 f now we consider arbitrary polarization not only the maximally real the final result is theorem 3 2 fix the cartan sub algebra h and consider an arbitrary not necessarily maximally real polarization b then for a basic datum h b u 1 f the associated bundle ev su 1 has both the properties mg and z in other words the theorem a 3 12 holds for arbitrary basic data h b u 1 f proof suppose that h gf is fixed b gc is a polarization such that h b and that b isn t maximally real it is easy to see that there exists a complex simple root such that 6 denote 0 s b 0 s b and s 0 g b 0 given gc h we can view as an element of h u 1 c since h is the cartan sub algebra of gc we obtain a representation e hu 1 c then we have a vector bundle lu 1 su 1 0 and a vector bundle lu 1 su 1 applying lemma 10 6 from ror we can obtain g equivariant morphisms of complexes c hu 1 s u 1 0 xev pn su 1 0 c hu 1 su 1 xev l u 1 p 1 n su 1 3 globalization over u 1 coverings 219 and this morphism restricts to a morphism of

vanish on 0 1 vectors tangent to the fibers of s u 1 s u 1 0 applying the dolbeault lemma we see that the inclusion c s u 1 0 su 1 xev l u 1 n su 1 c su 1 xev l u 1 n su 1 induces isomorphisms on cohomology on the other hand we have a morphism of complexes c s u 1 0 xev pn su 1 c s u 1 0 su 1 xev l u 1 p 1 n su 1 let b b g b 0 g denote by x the flag manifold of parabolic sub algebras of gc

completes the proof of the theorem 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry graded lie algebras have recently become a topic of interest in physics in the context of supersymmetry relating particles of different statistics as it is pointed out in the survey cns in the physical systems where the bose einstein particles and fermi dirac particles interact together sym metry must be replaced by supersymmetry lie superalgebras and lie su pergroups are therefore important mathematical tools of physics and they must be studied seriously b kostant has developed in his work kos 2 the representation theory of lie supergroups along the line of the kirillov kostant orbit method for the ordinary lie groups his theory is founded in differential geometry and uses symplectic structures hamiltonian formalism integrality condition line bundles with connection and prequantization for the supergroup case but polarizations and unitarity are lacking by himself in general perhaps the main difficulty is the fact that the lie s theorem is not true in in the general case of solvable lie superalgebras they have also irreducible finite dimensional representations rather than the one dimensional characters this means that we must work with multidimensional induced bundles in place of line bundles using the new notion of polarization exposed in the previous chapters one can develop also a theory of quantization for lie supergroups see d 22 4 1 hilbert superbundles with connection 222 8 reduction modification and superversion definition 4 1 as usual let us denote by c the ground field of com plex numbers by z 2 z the residue field consisting of two elements 0 and 1 recalll that a complex vector superspace v is by definition a z 2 z graded vector space v v 0 v 1 the elements of v 0 are called even i e their graded degree is 0 x 0 those of v 1 are called odd i e their graded degree is 1 x 1 throughout what follows if for some x expression x occurs then it is assumed that x is homogeneous and that the expression extends to other elements by linearity suppose that the vector superspace v v 0 v 1 admits a complex sesquilinear form b v v c a so called scalar product which is linear relative to the first variable and superhermitian i e for all homogeneous x y in v b x y 1 x y b y x consistent i e for all x and y of different graded degrees b x y 0 and nondegenerate i e if b x y 0 y v then x 0 it is easy to deduce the following corollary 4 1 let v b be a vector superspace with scalar product 1 i the restriction of b on v 0 is a scalar product and the restriction of b to v 1 is a nondegenerate skew symmetric form 2 ii the correspondence z 7 b z establishes a monomorphism v v remark 4 1 in the category of superspaces there is a special functor of changing the graduation degrees v 0 v 1 v 1 v 0 suppose that there is also a scalar product b on v and that v b and v b are the hilbert spaces in this case we say that v b b is a hilbert superspace it must be remarked that in work d 22 it was not true that the hilbert superspace structure can be deduced from a single scalar product b indeed it must be defined by a pair consisting of two scalar product b and b with respect to which the space v is complete 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 223 definition 4 2 for an operator u aut v b b we define u u aut b b we have therefore a commutative diagram v u v v u v corollary 4 2 u is symplectic in v 1 if and only if u is unitary on the hilbert space w v 1 let us consider a hilbert superspace v b b denote by q and q the corresponding quadratic forms on v and v respectively corollary 4 3 i q is nondegenerate on v 0 but identically 0 on v 1 ii q is nondegenerate on v 1 but identically 0 on v 0 definition 4 3 we now define the norm of supervectors on v by the formula v q x q x forall x v v as complex vector spaces and as usually the associated norm of operators a sup x 1 ax now it is easy to see that the vector superspace v v 0 v 1 with scalar product b on v and b on v v 0 v 1 v 1 v 0 v as complex vector spaces becomes a hilbert superspace iff it is complete with respect to this norm of supervectors by an even unitary symplectic operator u usp v we mean an even automorphism u aut v b b 0 i e uvi vi i 0 1 corollary 4 4 the set of all unitary symplectic operators forms a group denoted also usp v on this group the strong topology is equivalent to the weak topology the proof is the same as in the classical case by using the well known cauchy bounjakowski schwarz inequality for scalar product lemma 4 1 the topological group usp v is isomorphic to the direct product of the unitary groups of v 0 and v 1 proof by definition we have b ux uy b x y and b ux uy b x y i e u u v 0 0 0 u v 1 u v 0 0 0 u v 0 224 8 reduction modification and superversion we have therefore aut v b b 0 aut v 0 b aut v 1 b aut v 0 b aut v 1 b definition 4 4 a linear superoperator a v v is said to be anti supersymmetric iff for every homogeneous element x y v b ax y 1 a x b x ay b ax y 1 a x b x ay lemma 4 2 antisupersymmetric superoperators form a lie superalge bra the even part of which is a lie algebra consisting of all pairs of an tisymmmetric unbounded operator on the direct product of hilbert spaces v 0 v 1 proof it is enough to verify that the vector superspace of antisuper symmetric superoperators is stable under the brackets a b ab 1 a b ba but this is clear from the definition see also ka 5 3 4 b from the well known stone theorem for hilbert superspaces it is easy to deduce the corresponding superversion theorem 4 1 stone theorem every one real parameter con tinuous subgroup u t t r of even unitary symplectic superoperators on a hilbert superspace v admits a generator 1 a which is antisymmetric continuous perhaps unbounded superoperator definition 4 5 let g a be a lie supergroup and let g lie g a be the lie superalgebra u g the enveloping superalgebra of g r g the function algebra on g and a g e g g r g su g the lie hopf coalgebra where by s we denote the so called smash product see also kos 2 let v b b be a hilbert superspace and let endv be the super algebra of continuous superoperators on v by a smooth unitary represen tation of g a on v we mean a homomorphism of superalgebras r a g endv such that 1 the restriction r g is a continuous representation of the lie group g in the group of even unitary symplectic automorphisms r g g usp v 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 225 2 each vector v v is smooth i e the map g v g 7 r g v is of class c 3 r x v d dt r exp tx v t 0 v v x g 0 the rest of this section is in large similar to the same of kos 2 4 where the theory is developed purely for line superbundles our need is essentially in the multidimensional case so we are trying to modify these results and notions for the multidimensional situation notation let x a be a supermanifold and let u x be an open set dera u the lie superalgebra of all superderivations in a u which is also a a u module t u the tensor algebra of dera u over a u t u b 0 t b u b 0 dera u a u a u dera u b times which is z z 2 z bi graded now let j u be the two side z z 2 z graded ideal in t u generated by the elements in t 2 u of the form 1 where dera u are homogeneous denote also j b u t b u j u let us denote by e a projective locally free a module sheaf on x a then for every b n homa u t b u e u can be considered as the set of all bilinear maps on dera u with values in e u which satisfy the conditions 1 f l b 1 f l i 1 i f 1 b now let b

hom e e f is an important case remark that if v u is an open subset one has a restriction map u v u e v e such that if i dera u b u e then u v b v e is charac terized by u v 1 u v b u v u v 1 b it is clear that the correspondence u 7 u e defines the sheaf of differ ential superforms with values in a projective locally free a module sheaf e assume that dim x a m n an open set u is calleda parallelizable if there exist l dera u l 1 m n such that l dera u 0 if l m and i dera u 1 if l m and such that every dera u can be uniquely decomposed as m n l 1 fl l where fl a u remark that every a coordinate neighborhood is parallelizable now if the open u is a parallelizable one defines l 1 u e by the condition that l fl if m n l 1 fl l dera u thus k l kl idu put l l l m 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 227 and l l m 1 l n then l 1 u a 0 and l 1 u a 1 and l i i l i j j i we introduce the usual multiindex notation see also kos 2 4 2 1 k 1 1 n n we see that in the a parallelizable open set u u e is a free a u module such that every differential superform can be written in form f f e u now assume that u is an a splitting coordinate neighborhood with an coordinate system ri sj i 1 m j 1 n then dera u is a free a u module with the corresponding basis ri sj we can choose just i j dri dsj so we have dr ds k u a k u e and every u e can be written as dr ds f where f e u recall that as in the line super bundle case we can also construct the map y e x e which is associated to the super bundle sheaf morphism e e finally by a super bundle we means a projective locally free a module sheaf e such that there exists a covering by opens which are prin cipal for e in the sense that e u is a free a u module with a basal system of even generators ti e u 0 i 1 ranka u e u definition 4 7 let e be a vector super bundle over the super manifold x a by a connection on e we mean a covariant super derivation such that for any open set u x and any vector super field dera u one has a linear map e u e u where which is compatible with the restriction maps to smaller open sets and is such that 228 8 reduction modification and superversion 1 ft f t 1 f f t for f a u and t e u and 2 the map dera u ende u 7 is a u linear the complexification of dera u may be taken to be the complex lie super algebra derac u of super fields of vectors by linearity we may take and f in derac u and ac u respectively and c u e will denote the complexification of u e now assume that e is a complexified vector super bundle with connection u x is principal for e and ti i 1 rkae then for every derac u there exists g g endec u such that t g t the correspondence 7 g defines an ac u linear map derac u ende u therefore there exists a unique element t 1 c u ende such that t 1 t t for all derac u and t 0 i e t now if si e u 0 then clearly si i 1 ranka u e u is a basal system of generators iff s tf for some f aute u in this case we have lemma 4 3 s f t t 1 1 df f 1 proof because s ft we have by definition s 1 s s 1 ft ft ft f t 1 f f t 1 1 df t 1 f f 1 t t 1 1 df f 1 ft 1 f t f 1 f t from this the lemma is deduced notation the classical formulas for the differential of a vector valued function holds also in the super context however we must be careful to use the right or the left a u module structure in 1 u e for example if f e u is arbitrary one has df m i 1 dri f ri n j 1 dsj f sj so we have in an arbitrary open set u x the map d 0 u e 1 u e 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 229 has zero z 2 z graded degree remark that u e is z z 2 z graded and end u e is also z z 2 z graded thus an element u end u e is of bidegree c j iff u b u e i b c u e i j for any b i z z 2 z we will say about u as a derivation of bidegree c j iff for each b u e i and b u e j and if e and e are paired with values in f we have u u 1 bc ij u remark that if a derivation is defined it has also functorial property let us now denote by the affine connection of our super bundle e and by its connection form let b u e then we define the differential d and the inner product and lie derivative for any vector super field dera u e by the following formulae b 1 d b 1 i 1 1 i 1 ji 1 i i 1 i b 1 k l 1 dk l k l 1 k l b 1 where ji i k 1 k dk l k jk 1 l jl 1 k l k l 1 b 1 1 b i 1 i 1 b 1 and finally we define d d it is easy to see that d and are the derivations of degrees 1 0 1 0 respectively as in the ordinary case we have the superb racket relations 1 1 0 2 1 3 1 and the relationship between contraction and lie derivation 1 b b i 1 1 i 1 k 1 k 1 i b 1 b k 1 k 1 b so we have a de rham complex of global sections of e x e b x e d b 1 x e 230 8 reduction modification and superversion if the connection is flat i e for all dera u curv 0 let p u x tp x a the tangent super space at p be p be the linear super space of all e u valued b linear forms z on tp x a tp x tp x a 1 such that v 1 vj vj 1 vb z 1 1 vj vj 1 v 1 vj 1 vj vb z note that be p is z 2 z graded such that if z is

we observe that the map a u c u f 7 f extends to a homomor phism u e e u 7 1 b 1 b now let e x e 0 x hom tp x e u 0 be the restriction map from the complex e x to the ordinary e u 0 valued de rham com

complex homomorphisms x e d k e 0 x d e x d 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 231 lemma 4 4 poincare lemma suppose that f e u 0 u e then d f 0 in the connected open set u iff f 1

our connection is flat then locally we can consider its trivial form of connection so d d df m i 1 dri f ri n j 1 dsj f sj and because f f s for every scalar super function the first assertion is trivial locally the map u e d k e 0 x d is an complex isomorphism so for a contractible open u the acyclicity of the usual de rham complex deduces the acyclicity of our graded de rham complex the

structed a flasque resolution of the constant sheaf our complex is its tensor product with ende pt thus we have a flasque resolution by our complex for the constant sheaf definition 4 8 let e be a vector super bundle with connection form 1 1 on super manifold x a then there exists a unique differential 2 super form 2 x ende such that d i e 1 1 this 2 super form is called the curvature form of the connection as in the classical case it is easy to deduce the following result 232 8 reduction modification and superversion proposition 4 1 curv e 1 definition 4 9 let e be a super bundle with connection over x a and ui tij i i j 1 rankae is a local system for e we denote ti ti 1 ti ranka e and cij ende u the transition functions defined by tjcij tj and we will then refer to the set cij i j cij ic 1 ij 1 dcij c 1 ij as local datum for e if cij i is an another local data of some vector super bundle e then e is equivalent to e if and only if there exist i iso e e such that icij 1 j c ij and i i i 1 i 1 d i 1 i since every vector super bundle with connection admits at least one lo cal datum with respect to a contractible covering it follows that the no tion of curvature is an equivalence invariant and hence curv e curv e is well defined note that the set lc x a of all equiva lent classes of vector super bundles with connection has the structure of an abelian group e e e iff cij c ijc ij i i i and curv e curv e curv e now for any closed 2 super form 2 c x ende u 0 let l x a be the set of all classes e lc x a such that curv e lc x a l x a is a disjoint union over the set of all closed 2 super forms 2 x ende u 0 now given a closed 2 super form 2 x ende u the question is to decide whether l x a is nonempty observe that one has the same answer as in the ungraded case if aute pt is the automorphism group of fiber transformations then the cohomology group h 1 x aute x 0 operates on lc x a 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 233 let ui i i be the contractible covering of x and assume that e is a vector super bundle with connection over x a let cij i be the corresponding local datum for e let zij be the cocycle for the constant sheaf aute pt 0 lemma 4 5 the cohomology group h 1 x aute x 0 operates as fol lows zij e e where e has the local datum cij zij i with respect to the covering ui i i i zij iz 1 ij proof it is easy to see that cijzij zij iz 1 ij is a local datum of some super bundle with connection e we must prove that curv e we see that zij 0 is also a local datum then there exists a flat super bundle with connection ez 0 such that zij 0 is its local datum by the abelian group structure on lc x a we have curv e curv e curv ez 0 0 corollary 4 6 l x a h 1 x aute x 0 remark 4 2 let us denote by exp the exponential map f ende u 0 7 exp 1 f aute u where as usually exp 1 f n 0 1 f n n the exponential series converges absolutely on the operator norm topology as usually remark that elements of the form i ende 1 u 0 the

0 ende 0 exp aute 0 1 so by the long exact cohomology sequence we have 234 8 reduction modification and superversion corollary 4 7 for a fixed super manifold x a there is a natural isomorphism lc x a h 2 x remark 4 3 by the well known kuiper theorem aute u is homo topically trivial in the infinite dimensional case we are interesting in the multidimensional quantization theory to the classification of all infinite dimensional hilbert super bundles associated with principal super bundles with finite dimensional lie super groups as structural groups lemma 4 6 let x a be a super manifold and let 2 bbbc x ende 0 be a closed 2 form then l x a is nonempty if and only if the cohomol ogy class belong to the cohomology grouph 2 x h 2 x aute x 0 proof assume that the class is valued let ui i i is a

intersection ui uj uk d fij fjk fik 0 so there is some zijk aute x 0 such that fij fjk fik zijkidui uj uk because is valued we can choose zijk so cij exp fij aute u 0 it is easy to see that cij i is a local datum of some super bundle with con nection say e clearly curv e this means that l x a is nonempty the inverse assertion is proved in the same way as in the classical case 4 2 quantization super operators notation let m a be a symplectic super manifold of dimension m n recall from 4 4 the map k x e d e 0 x d then x k is a symplectic mani fold and the dimension m must be even m 2 m 0 and there is at every point a darboux coordinate system pi qi in coordinate neighborhood u in other hand because the restriction of to the odd part of the tangent super spaces is a non degenerate symmetric form there exists see also kos 2 5 3 a morse canonical system of coordinates sj j 1 n to gether there exists at every point a so called local a darboux coordinate sys tem pi qi i 1 m 0 sj j 1 n where pi qi a u 0 and sj a u 1 and in which m 0 i 1 dpi dqi n i 1 j 2 dsj 2 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 235 where j 1 it is easy to see that in this a darboux coordinate system the hamil tonian vector super field f corresponding to a super function f f df now becomes f m 0 i 1 f qi pi f pi qi n j 1 j f sj sj in particular we have pk qk qk pk sj j sj in such a a darboux coordinate system the poisson brackets have the form f g a u 7 f g f g 1 f g g f f g m 0 i 1 f qi g pi f pi g qi n j 1 1 f j f sj g sj in particular we have the poisson brackets between the generators as the canonical super commutator relations pi pk qi ql sj pk sj ql 0 qk pl kliu si sj j ijiu now we consider the quantization problem as in the classical case by definition a quantization procedure is a correspondence associating to each super function f a super symmetric super operator f which is anti auto adjoint super operator if f is a real super function in some fixed hilbert super space such that f 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 1 id where as usually h 2 is the normed planck s constant definition 4 10 let us denote by e a vector super bundle with connection and hilbert super space fibers such that the connection con serves the hilbert structure this means that the corresponding parallel transpose conserves the scalar product let us denote also by 1 the connection super form of then the values of the super form are the anti super symmetric super operators for any complex vector super fields and are anti auto adjoint for real super fields 236 8 reduction modification and superversion we define now for each super function f a m the corresponding quantized super operator f f f 1 f f 1 f f the same as in the classical case we have also the following quantization condition theorem 4 3 the following three conditions are equivalent 1 the super operator valued differential 2 super form is the differ ential of with respect to d i e d 1 1 id dera m 2 the curvature of is symplectic more precisely curv e 1 3 the correspondence f 7 f is a quantization correspondence proof 1 2 as in the classical case we have 1 and therefore 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 in virtue of the relation the rest of the proof of this part is lemma 4 7 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 237 proof for any super section f e u we have f f 1 f 1 f f 2 3 we have directly from the definition 1 f 1 f 2 1 f 1 1 f 1 f 2 1 f 2 1 1 f 1 f 2 1 xif 1 f 2 1 2 xif 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 it is easy to see that f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 so the proof of the theorem shall be completed by proving the following lemma 4 8 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 proof the multiplication by a super function is super commuting with the multiplication by any super operator valued super function so we have f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 for every section s e u one has f 1 f 2 s f 1 f 2 s 1 f 1 f 2 f 2 f 1 s f 1 f 2 s 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 s 1 2 f 2 f 1 f 1 f 2 s 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 s f 1 f 2 s by analogy we have also f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 f 1 f 2 remark 4 4 here we talk about a prequantization procedure because as usually the covariant derivation dera u operates as a ele ment of ende u for every open u only with the help of some super polarization we can construct the corresponding hilbert super space of the quantum states of the system under consideration we shall do this as super polarization in what follows 238 8 reduction modification and superversion remark 4 5 remember that the expression d d 2 1 is non linear with respect to thus in the condition 1 of the theorem we have a nonlinear differential equation d id and in the condition 2 of the theorem we have an equivalent nonlinear differential equation curv e 1 id in the temporary physics there are some sorts of this equation related with the curvature of some connections an interesting example of this type is the well known yang mills equation curv e curv e where the star sign is the hodge star by radon penrose transform this equation becomes the cauchy riemann condition for the corresponding bundle in the space of light rays of the compactified minkowski space in the work d 22 it was posed the following conjecture our quantization conditions could be also transformed by the radon penrose transformation to some algebraic condition of the corresponding super bundle we discuss now about application of this pre quantization procedure to the representation theory of lie super groups notations recall that if g is any group and k is a fixed ground field r or c the group algebra k g is a commutative hopf algebra with antipode over k k g k g k g so that g g g s g g 1 1 e g 1 g g now assume that g is a lie super algebra and one has a representation g aut g then extends uniquely to a representation of g by automorphisms of the universal enveloping super algebra u g now the smash productk g su g 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 239 with respect to or simply smash product if

algebras with the relations gug 1 g u g g u u g 3 with respect to the diagonal map the elements of g are group like and the elements of g are primitive and finally 4 one has s g g 1 s x x and 1 e g 1 1 e x 0 g g x g conversely let e be any commutative hopf super algebra with antipode over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero g the group of all group like elements in e and g be the lie super algebra of all primitive elements in e then there is a representation say g aut g such that gxg 1 g x g g x u g and e is isomorphic to the smash product of these parts with respect to the representation e k g su g notations now assume that g is a group g is a lie super algebra over the ground field k and e is the hopf super algebra with respect to some representation g aut g following b kostant kos 2 3 4 we will say that e has the structure of a lie hopf super algebra iff 1 g has a structure of not necessarily connected lie group 2 g g 0 g 1 is a finite dimensional lie

super algebra denote e g g 0 the lie hopf algebra obtained by replacing g by its even part g 0 as hopf algebras one knows that e g g 0 c g where c g is the set of distributions with finite support the lie hopf algebras form a category in which a morphism e g g e h h is a morphism of hopf super algebras such that the restriction to the even parts is a hopf algebra morphism e g g 0 e h h 0 induced by a lie group morphism g h notations let us consider a super manifold y b with the sheaf b y of super functions on y b consider the full dual b y of b y one 240 8 reduction modification and superversion has certainly an injection 0 b y b y b y b y one has also the diagonal map b y b y b y defined by the relation v f g v fg f g b y and v b y we consider the subspace b y defined as the super subspace of b y consisting of all v b y which vanishes on some ideal of finite co dimension of b y one knows that if v b y v b y b y iff v b y so there is a natural morphism b y b y b y which induces on b y a co commutative super algebra structure recall that if c c c is a super algebra co multiplication an element c is called group like iff it is non zero even element and an element v is called primitive with respect to a group like element iff v v v remark that b y is just the set of all distributions with finite support on y b recall also that a morphism b y c z of super co algebras is said to be smooth iff it is an induced morphism for some morphism of super manifolds y b z c now let g a be a super manifold of dimension m n a g a g a g be the diagonal map with respect to which a g is cocommmutative super algebra the co unit is given by the identity element 1 g a g 1 g v v 1 g v a g recall that g a has the structure of a lie super group if a g has also the structure of an algebra such that 1 a g 1 g is a hopf super algebra with antipode s 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 241 2 the map a g a g a g given by the multiplication and the map s a g a g given by the antipode are smooth it is well known see kos 2 3 5 that if g a is a lie group then g is a lie group with respect to the underlying manifold structure with lie algebra lieg g 0 the even part of the lie super algebra of primitive elements of a g and a g e g g with respect to the representation g aut g g x def gxg 1 x g g g and g 0 adg the restriction to the connected component of identity definition 4 11 let g a be a lie super group and let y b be a super manifold we will say that g a acts on y b or y b is a g a space iff the following map is smooth a g b y b y vw i j 1 w j u i u iw j u iw j if u i u i u i and w j w j w j for each u a g and w b y in this case b y becomes an a g module by duality the commu tative lie super algebra b y becomes also some a g module w u f 1 u w s u w f observe that if f g b y and u i u i u i then u fg i 1 f u i u i f u i g 242 8 reduction modification and superversion recall that a lie super subgroup h b in g a will be called closed if h is a closed subgroup in g let g h g g 7 hg be the coset projection map put v 1 u if u is some open subset in h g then v a v is some h b super space and the restriction map a g a v is some h b module map now put b a u f a v rvw f 1 w f fs w w 1 h f it is easy to see that b a u is a commutative super algebra containing in a v and the correspondence u 7 b a u form a sheaf of commutative super algebras as it is pointed out in kos 2 3 9 the sheaf b a on h g together with the homomorphism b a u c u defines a super manifold structure h g b a of dimension m m n n if dim g a m n and dim h b m n furthermore we have also the local triviality of the projection map for the sufficiently small open sets u one has an isomorphism u h b a b g a in other words we have also a principal super bundle associated with each closed lie super subgroup it is not hard to show see also kos 2 3 10 3 that if h b is a closed lie super subgroup of a lie super group g a then with respect to the action of g a on h g b a h g b a is a homogeneous g a super space conversely if x a is a homogeneous g a super space then x a h g b a where h b is the stabilizer of a point say p x definition 4 12 suppose that our lie super group g a acts on a symplectic super manifold m b by a representation a g endb m such that its restriction to the lie super algebra g is a representation of the lie super algebra g by the canonical transformations x g 7 x hamb m derb m 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 243 denote by lx the lie derivation along the vector super field x i e lx x we have also a natural exact sequence of lie super algebras 0 r 1 m b m hamb m 0 hence for eachx g there exists a super function the so called generating function fx b m x dfx 0 by the calculus on super manifolds we have also lx ly l x y and lxf fx f now suppose that fx depends linearly on x we have then a 2 cocycle of lie super algebra c x y fx fy f x y by the quantization conditions we have x y x y c x y where x 1 f x 1 fx x definition 4 13 we will say that the action of g a by the canonical transformations on the symplectic super manifold m b is flat iff the 2 cocycle c is zero remark that if the g a action on m b is flat the lie super algebra homomorphism g hamloc m b x 7 x can be lifted to a super algebra homomorphism g b y so we return to the kirillov s notion of strictly hamiltonian action in the lie group situation in this case we have a lie super algebra representation g endb y x 7 fx which is an integrable poisson representation in the kostant s sense kos 2 5 4 in the lie super group flat action case we have a representation of our lie super algebra g by super functions the so called classical physical quantities and some representation of our lie super algebra by the 244 8 reduction modification and superversion quantum quantities f x the antisymmetric super operators if the e nelson conditions are satisfied we will have a lie super group representation expx g 7 exp 1 f x of the universal covering group g a of g a definition 4 14 by a mechanical system with super symmetry we mean a symplectic super manifold together with a flat homogeneous action of some lie super group say also of symmetry so starting from a mechanical system with super symmetry we can ob tain some representations i e the corresponding quantum systems by using the quantization procedure also as in ungraded cases 4 3 super polarizations and induced representations we see that to construct the quantum system we must take in account a prequan tization procedure and a hilbert super bundle with connection e l m b for the quantum model the sections of which are the quantum states with internal super symmetry the question is whether this set is nonempty as usually the integral condition guarantees a positive solution of this question definition 4 15 let g be a finite dimensional real lie super algebra g a the corresponding simply connected lie super group m b an arbi trary homogeneous g a super space with a flat action of g a m m a fixed point and gm am the isotropy subgroup at this point and finally gm lie gm am g the corresponding lie super algebra the point m can be considered as a super functional m a g on g therefore we can define m x d m 1 fx 1 fx m in the flat action case there is some character m of the connected compo nent of identity gm 0 am then as usually the point m is said to be admissible resp integral iff there is an extension of this super character m from the connected component of identity gm 0 am to an irreducible representation resp to the same character of the whole stabilizer group gm am it is not hard to check an super analogous result proposition 4 2 if m b is a homogeneous flat action g a super space then the following conditions are equivalent 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 245 1 some point m m is admissible resp integral 2 every point of m is admissible resp integral 3 the set l m b is nonempty suppose now m b is admissible i e there exists a representation of gm am in some hilbert super space v taking a fixed connection on the principal super bundle gm am g a m b we obtain some affine connection on the associated super bundle as in the classical cases the set of these possible quantum associated bundles can be parameterized by the first cohomology group h 1 m aut v 0 therefore we have also in the super case a result analogous to the same one in the classical ungraded case let us now consider a symplectic flat action g a manifold c o m b m b g a some g a orbit it can be also proved an analogue of the classification theorem of homogeneous flat symplectic man ifolds so that locally we can consider our symplectic super manifold as some kirillov s co adjoint orbit let us fix a point x in its stabilizer gx ax the connected component of identity gx 0 ax a fixed repre sentation v of gx ax etc let t c be the complexified tangent super bundle of the orbit c consider some complex tangent distribution l t c which is g a invariant and integrable i e there is some sub super bundle the tangent bundle of which is just l it is not hard also to prove an super version of the frobenius theorem the tangent distribution l is integrable iff the set of all global sections form a lie super algebra with respect to the superb rackets of super sections it is also easy to check that the lie super algebra of in variant global sections of an integrable invariant distribution is isomorphic to the quotient of some complex lie super subalgebra by the complexified lie super algebra of the stabilizer it is therefore easy to construct the complex super subalgebra p gc such that lx p gx c and lx lx p p gx c it is clear that the invariance guarantees the inclusion gx lx lx definition 4 16 we will say that the distribution l is closed iff the connected super subgroup h 0 f h 0 i corresponding to the lie super subalgebra h p g andm p p g and the super subgroup h f gx ax h 0 f m i gx ax m 0 i are closed definition 4 17 fix a representation v of the stabilizer gx ax which is a multiple of x in restricting to the connected component gx 0 ax 246 8 reduction modification and superversion of the admissible orbit c we say that l 0 is a x polarization and l is weakly lagrangian iff a 0 is an irreducible unitary representation of the super group h 0 f in some hilbert super space v such that 1 the restriction 0 gx ax h 0 f mult gx ax h 0 f 2 the point 0 is fixed under the contragradient action of the lie super group gx ax in the dual h 0 f b is a representation of the complex lie super algebra p in the hilbert super space v such that its restriction to the real part h is the lie derivative of the representation 0 and the e nelson conditions are supposed to be satisfied the notion of polarization can be also formulated in terms of lie super subalgebra that is the so called x polarization definition 4 18 we say that p 0 is a x polarization iff a p is some complex lie super subalgebra of gc containing gx b the super subalgebra p is adgc gx invariant c the vector super space p p is the complexification of some real super algebra m p p g d the super subgroups m 0 i h 0 f m i h f are closed where m 0 i resp h 0 f is the connected super subgroup of g a with the lie super subalgebra m resp h p g and m i gx ax m 0 i h f gx ax h 0 f e 0 is an irreducible unitary representation of the super group h 0 f such that 1 the restriction 0 gx ax h 0 f is a multiple of the restriction gx ax h 0 f where by definition x expx exp 1 x x and by the definition gx 0 ax mult x and 2 the point 0 is fixed under gx ax action on the dual h 0 f f is some representation of the complex lie super algebra p in hilbert super space v such that its restriction to the real part h p g is equivalent to the derivative d 0 of the representation 0 4 quantization of mechanical systems with supersymetry 247 theorem 4 4 l 0 is a x polarization iff p h 0 is a x polarization proof if l 0 is a x polarization l is weakly lagrangian invariant integrable tangent super distribution of the tangent super bundle t ax a in the notations before we have remarked that we could reconstruct the lie super subalgebra p form the distribution l p gx c lx it is easy to verify that we have in this case a x polarization conversely it is easy to reconstruct a x polarization l 0 from some x polarization p h 0 with the same reason as in the ordinary lie group case we can easily prove corollary 4 8 suppose that c is an admissible oder inte gral orbit of a mechanical system with super symmetry m b g a l 0 a x polarization where as above is a representation of gx ax the restriction of which to the connected component gx 0 ax is a multiple of the character x then 1 the homogeneous super space admits the structure of a mixed manifold of type k l m in the sense of d 4 d 13 2 there exists a unique irreducible unitary representation of the super group h f such that its restriction to the stable super subgroup gx ax is a multiple of the representation and its derivative is the re striction of the representation to the real part h p g construction see also kos 2 6 1 for the line super bundle case assume that l 0 is a x polarization of our orbit from the preceding theorem we can obtain some representation of the polarization closed super subgroup h f in some hilbert super space v let us denote by g the natural projection g a h g f a let u h g be an open set and let v 1 g u g one has therefore a v b h a v denote by a v the super space of all v valued super space f ev u such that wv f w v f v a v w b h it is easy to see that f a u can be embedded into a v as a sub super space of super functions such that wv g w 1 h v g v a v w b h so the correspondence u h g 7 ev u ev 1 g u 248 8 reduction modification and superversion is a sheaf on h g let be the element of ev 1 g u such that for any w b h w w t 0 and for a fixed t 0 in ev 1 g u because the representation is irreducible we see that the open u is principal for the sheaf ev thus we have some sheaf it is easy to see also that ev g a is a closed sub super space of v valued super functions on g a and it is stable under the action of our super group g a on the right in particular the elements of the lie super algebra g acts via the hamiltonian super fields on the right hence for each open set u in h g the super subspace ev 1 g u consisting of the sections the covariant derivative of which vanishes along the vector super fields from p for the polarization p form a sub sheaf which gives us also an invariant closed super subspace of global sections of our quantum super bundle ev we refer to this invariant super subspace of global sections as the induced representation ind g a p h 0 corollary 4 9 the natural representation called partially invariant holomorphly induced representation and denoted by ind g a l x 0 of the lie super group g a in the super space of so called partially invariant and partially holomorphic sections of the induced super bundle ev 0 is equivalent to the natural right regular representation by right translations on the super space a g a l x 0 of smooth super functions on g with values in v such that wv f w v f w b h v a v xf 0 x p where by definition x x x finally by the same computation as in the ordinary lie group case we can compute the lie derivative of the introduced partially invariant and holomorphly induced representation theorem 4 5 the lie derivative of the partially invariant and holo morphly induced representation ind g a p h f 0 is equivalent to the lie super algebra representation x g 7 1 f x of the lie super algebra g lie g a via the multidimensional quantization procedure 5 bibliographical remarks 249 5 bibliographical remarks the main ideas of

index of type i c algebras as said in the introduction the problem of description of irreducible unitary representations of groups is a preliminary step for using the general gel fand transform to study the structure of l 1 g and c g in this chapter we introduce a general construction of indices of type i c algebras we shall prove that if is an irreducible representation of a c algebra a of type i then an element a a is transformed under into a compact operator if and only if it belongs into the intersection of kernels of the irreducible unitary representations 6 of a which belong to the closure of the single point set this result give us a possibility to construct canonical composition series with ccr quotients by which we shall find out a complete system of invariants of c algebras of type i at the last section we shall show some concrete applications to group c algebras 1 compact type ideals in type i c algebras let a to be a c algebra of type i with identity element we shall add it formally if the algebra has no one a its dual object with the usual jacobson dixmier glimme sakai topology see a kirillov ki j dixmier di for simplicity we shall identify the equivalence classes of irreducible representations with their representatives a c algebra a is of type i if and only if the image of a under any non degenerate irreducible representations contains the ideal k h of compact operators in the separable hilbert space h h in which the representa tion is realized definition 1 1 the preimage k 1 kh of the ideal k h in a is called an ideal of compact type associated with the representation from this definition we can deduce directly that the compact type ideals are always closed and two sided in a see j dixmier di 251 252 9 index of type i c algebras if the representation is not of ccr following the definition the ideal k can not coincided with the whole c algebra a in other side the c algebra a is of type i iff k 6 0 hence we have an proper ideal one pose a natural question is how to describe these ideals in the general case we recall a well known result theorem 1 1 rosenberg ros j m g fell fe 1 irreducible representation of c algebra of type i a is ccr if and only if the one point set is closed in the topology of the dual object a cur a a for a subset x in the dual object a of a c algebra a we denote by x the closure of x theorem 1 2 let a to be an element of a an irreducible non degenerate representation of a then the operator a id a compact operator if and only if a 0 for all and 6 proof as remarked above k is a two sided ideal of a type i or in other words gcr c algebra a the restriction of onk is a nontrivial representation because k k h following j dixmier di 3 2 1 k k is an irreducible ccr representation of k following the theorem of a rosenberg j m g fell the one point set is closed in the topology of k which is a closed set in a assume that 6 belongs to the closure of the one point set in the topology of a following j dixmier di prop 3 2 1 if k 6 0 then k and is a weak limit of this is impossible as said above thus we have k 0 in other words if a is a compact operator i e a k then a 0 for all conversely suppose that a 0 for all we must prove that a is a compact operator suppose that b 6 ker then b is an two sided closed ideal in a thus the dual object b of b is included in the dual object a of a as an open subset more exactly b a really means that ker ker 2 canonical composition series 253 hence b 0 in other words we have b ker following j dixmier di 3 2 2 we have b a if b 0 then nothing is need to check if b 6 0 we have b as above because b is dense in a and following the definition of b we conclude that is closed in b this means that is a ccr representation of a in other words if pi a 0 with every we have a k h corollary 1 1 the compact type ideal k can be described as k a a a 0 remark 1 1 we have therefore a solution of our problem of description of compact type ideal we also remark that the set is closed if and only if is an empty set therefore our theorem contain the theorem of a rosenberg j m g fell as a particular case 2 canonical composition series we construct now canonical composition series for each good c algebra which satisfy the following definition definition 2 1 we say that element a is a boundary point of degree 0 if it belongs to the closure of no other point of a we denote by x 0 the set of all boundary points of degree 0 the point a x 0 is said to have boundary degree 1 if it belongs to the closure of no other point of a x 0 with the induced topology we denote by x 1 the set of all points of boundary degree 1 the point a is said to have boundary degree 2 if it belongs to the closure of no other point of a x 0 x 1 with induced topology etc we continue this procedure until infinity if a x 0 x 1 is not empty suppose that is the first transfinite cardinal number and we suppose that for all preceded cardinal the sets x were already constructed we posex and consider the set a x with the induced topology 254 9 index of type i c algebras if this set is nonempty we continue this procedure we obtain thus a sequence of sets x 0 x 1 x 2 x where is a fixed cardinal number a x we say that a c algebra has boundary property iff x is a nonempty open set in a x in every case when is a non limit cardinal 0 and a x 6 we see that the set of gcr c algebras with boundary property is rather wide the most of c algebras c g of locally compact groups in our works and in other works of j rosenberg have this property we pose e a ker where a a x with 0 and a 0 a theorem 2 1 suppose that a is a gcr c algebra with boundary property then a all e 0 e 1 e are two sided closed ideals b for each cardinal 0 e x c we have a tower of ideals 0 e 0 e 1 e a d for each cardinal 0 the quotient c algebra e 1 e is ccr hence for each c algebra a with boundary property we have a canonical composition series before to prove the theorem we prove the following preliminary lemma lemma 2 1 let t be a topological space u an open subset of t f t u o is an open set in the induced topology of f then u o is an open set in t 2 canonical composition series 255 proof really let x to be an arbitrary point in u o then either x u or x o in the first case there exists a neighborhood u 1 of x in the topology of t such that u 1 u u o in the second case there exists a neighborhood u 1 of x in the induced topology of f such that o 1 o u o following definition of induced topology there exists an open v in t such that v f o 1 then v v t v u v f v u o 1 u o thus in any case we can always choose an open neighborhood of x in u o this means that u o is open in t corollary 2 1 let a to be a gcr c algebra with boundary property then each set a a x is closed proof really because a is a gcr c algebra with boundary prop erty the sets x 0 are nonempty open sets if is not a limit cardinal number thus a 1 a x 0 is closed because x 1 is open in a 1 following the above lemma x 0 x 1 is open in a and a 2 a x 0 x 1 is closed etc for each finite number n n the set x 0 xn is open in a for the first limit cardinals x x 0 xn is open in a then a a x is closed continue the procedure infinitely time we see that all the sets a are closed in a finally we return to proof of the theorem a because a is a gcr c algebra with boundary property then each set x is open in the closed set a x following the corollary all the set a are closed thus following definition all the set e a ker are closed two sided ideals and e 0 0 e a b because x is open in a we have naturally e x 256 9 index of type i c algebras c because a 0 a a a x we have a tower of inclusions a 0 a a 1 a d following definition we have e 1 e e 1 e x finally we need only to show that each irreducible representation e 1 e is ccr indeed e 1 e x a x a 1 and moreover a 1 because e 1 a 1 ker is closed in the induced topology of x following the theorem of compact type ideals the representation is ccr 3 index of type i c algebras we construct now the canonical composition representation for gcr c algebras with boundary property let to be a fixed cardinal number c 1 c 2 c a system of c algebras such that c 0 if is a limit cardinal number we denote e xt 0 c 1 c 2 c the set of all increasing towers of c algebras of type i 0 e e 1 e a such that a all the c algebras e are closed two sided ideals in a b if is a limit cardinal e coincided with the closure of the ideal e in a c for each non limit cardinal number e 1 e c 1 0 in the set e xt 0 c 1 c 2 c we define an equivalence relation definition 3 1 two towers of ideals a 0 e 0 e 1 e a 3 index of type i c algebras 257 and b 0 f 0 f 1 f b are called equivalent if there exists an isomorphism a b inducing isomorphisms between the corresponding ideals i ei ei fi we denote by ext 0 c 1 c 2 c the set of all equivalent classes of tow ers of ideals in c algebras of type i the main problem is how to find out the invariants characterizing the equivalence classes from ext 0 c 1 c 2 c first we recall a little bits about r c busby invariant bu let d to be an arbitrary c algebra the pair t t of two maps t t d d satisfying the properties xt y t x y x y d is called a double multiplier we denote by m d the set of all double mul tipliers of d equip tom d natural operations and the norm of operators m d become a c algebra called the multiplier c algebra remark that m d contains d as an ideal and m d is the smallest c algebra which contains d as a proper closed ideal we denote o d m d d the quo tient c algebra and denote hom 0 c o d the set of all homomorphism from a c algebra c to o d in the set hom 0 c o d we introduce an equivalence relation two elements 1 2 of hom c o d are called equivalent if there exists isomorphisms d d and c c such that 2 1 1 where following definition o d o d is isomorphism associated with we denote by hom c o d the set of all these equivalence classes assume hom 0 c o d is a fixed homomorphism we consider the fibered product e m c m d c m c where is the canonical projection fromm d onto the quotient c algebra o d m d d following r c busby bu e is a c algebra as sume d m d is the natural inclusion we denote e 0 the univer sal extension e 0 0 d m d o d 0 258 9 index of type i c algebras we can complete the commutative diagram c y 0 d m d o d 0 by the homomorphisms f d e following the formula f d d 0 d d and g e c following the formula g m c c d d m m d in order to have the following commutative diagram 0 d f e g c 0 yid ypr 1 y 0 d m d o d 0 the obtained extension of c algebras 0 d e c 0 is denoted by e 0 and its equivalence class by e 0 r c busby bu has had proved the following result theorem 3 1 r c busby the map hom c o d 7 e 0 ext d c is a bijection we remark that r c busby denoted our set ext d c as ext c d we consider now the set ext c 1 c 2 c of equivalence classes of towers of ideals of c algebras of type a 0 e 0 e 1 e a we have naturally the extensions 0 e 1 c 1 e 2 e 2 e 1 c 2 0 there exists an element 1 hom c 2 o c 1 defining the equivalence class of this extension i e the equivalence class of the tower 0 e 0 e 1 c 1 e 2 thus up to equivalence we can replace e 2 by e 0 1 then following the extension 0 e 0 1 e 2 e 3 e 3 e 2 c 3 0 as above there exists an element 2 hom c 3 o e 0 1 defining the equivalence class of the extension and is defined uniquely the equivalence class of the tower 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 e 3 3 index of type i c algebras 259 etc if is a limit cardinal then following the conditions of the definition of boundary property e e and e is uniquely defined by the system of invariants then the equivalence class of the tower of ideals 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 e e 1 is uniquely defined by the invariant hom c 1 o e 0 we have proved that with each increasing tower of ideals of c algebras of type a 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 e a in the set ext 0 c 1 c 2 c there exists an unique system of invariants uniquely defining the equivalence class of the tower a 1 hom c 2 o c 1 2 hom c 3 o e 0 1 hom c 1 o e 0 definition 3 2 assume that the c algebra a can be decomposed into an increasing tower of ideals with length a 0 e 0 e 1 e 2 e a then the system of invariants is called the index of c algebra a and is denoted by ind a we have therefore proved the following results theorem 3 2 the system of invariants ind a 0 uniquely defines up to equivalence the structure of gcr c algebra a if it admits a composition series of ideals of type a 260 9 index of type i c algebras 4 compactness criteria for group c algebras applying the k homology to studying the structure of c algebras we introduced the method of topological invariants in the previous chapter this method was constructed in most general for the class of c algebras of type i with boundary property including the c algebras of groups in this theory the ideals of compact type plays a central role we described theses ideals in the language of the topology of dual objects this topology is just the zariski topology for primitive ideals and in general is complicate to describe in this last section of this chapter we shall describe these ideals in a more geometrical language for the representations induced from irreducible unitary representations of closed normal subgroups we describe the compactness by sing the partial fourier gel fand transforms 4 1 compactness criteria let g be a countable at infinity locally compact group g

integrable functions with values in the space of the representation following the formula t b a f x g 1 g 1 2 h h f xa where h x b a x and g 1 and g are the modular functions of haar measures on g 1 and g respectively we denote by s the closure of the set s in the topology of the dual g of group g we shall use the same letters to denote representations and their corresponding equivalence classes of c algebras for example we use notation t x g 1 t b a b a dbda for every l 1 g we define the partial fourier gel fand transform in variable b of func tions b a from l 1 g dbda by the formula x a g 1 g 1 g 1 2 x b b a db when x runs over the set x the representations x run over an orbit o x in the dual object g 1 of g 1 where x b x b it is easy to see that the functions a and a g 1 g 1 2 a r a da where r is the regular representation of the group x are lower semi continuous when the quasi orbit o is separable at infinity and they vanish at this infinity of the quasi orbit o when x tend to the

criteria are independent from the functions and proof of the theorem 1 2 was proved in the previous chapter 2 3 can b proved directly by using the mackey theory of rep resentations induced from small subgroups and the results of j m g fell 46 on continuity of the induction functor we denote th property weak containment by if o is weak contained in and thus indgg 1 is weak contained in ind g g 1 because g 1 mult we have weak contain in ind g g 1 and t indgg ind g g ind g g 1 indgg 1 from this we have t indgg 1 ind g g 1 t 3 4 this assertion is clear because indg g 1 g 1 mult hence ind g g 1 d

4 compactness criteria for group c algebras 263 4 5 is proved from the well known properties of regular repre sentations in particular there exists an approximative unity fn n 0 where fn is a sequence of dirac like functions 5 6 is clear 6 7 is proved easily that for positive operators the trace is vanishing iff nd only the operator is zero 6 1 can be proved with the help of two lemmas what follow lemma 4 1 particular case assume b a b a where l 1 g 1 o 0 x g 1 g 1 g 1 2 x b b db l 1 x and l 1 6 0 then t is a compact operator proof because x is countable at infinity we can choose a sequence of included one in another compact kn kn 1 o such that nkn o and continuous functions thetan such that 0 n x 1 and n x 1 if x kn 0 if x 6 kn 1 because x is continuous in x and in virtue of hypothesis o 0 the operator t can be approximate by a sequence of operators an anf x n x x x f xa g 1 g 1 2 x a a da which are compact indeed we have a t an 1 n x r a g 1 g 1 2 x a a da 1 n x r a g 1 g 1 2 a a da where 1 n is the operator of multiplication by a function because o 0 and 1 n o 0 we can choose n big enough that 1 n x r a g 1 g 1 2 a a da is small enough 264 9 index of type i c algebras b operator

converges absolutely following fubini theorem the operators an are all compact ones the lemma is therefore proved lemma 4 2 general case let be an element of l 1 g such that a o 0 then the operator t

the operators anm are compact operators thus the operator t is a compact operator and the proof of the theorem is achieved 5 application to lie group representations we apply now the compactness criteria to description of compact type ideals associated with the representations obtained from the multidimen sional orbit method 5 1 the case of solvable lie groups for type i connected and simply connected solvable lie groups all the irreducible unitary represen tations can be obtained from the orbit method see l auslander b kostant ak theorem 5 1 every irreducible unitary representation of a type i con nected and simply connected solvable or nilpotent lie group can be obtained as a representation induced from an irreducible unitary representation of a closed normal subgroup and hence the compactness criteria are applicable proof indeed for type i connected and simply connected solvable or nilpotent lie groups every irreducible unitary representation can be obtained from the orbit method i e can be expressed in the form t t f f with some f in g t t f f ind g p h following the analysis of the structure of induced representations in the previous chapter t ind g p h indga where 1

nilpotent lie groups n m thus 1 2 is a ccr representation of the closed normal subgroup a m n 5 2 generic representations of reductive lie groups we re call now the detailedr l lipsmananalysis for irreducible representations of semi simple and reductive lie groups we shall show that all the generic irreducible presentations can be obtained as representations repeatedly induced from irreducible representation of some appropriate normal sub groups and therefore the compactness criteria can be repeated applicable on each induction steps see d 7 let b be a duflo data i e g is admissible in the sense of duflo integral and well polarizable and an irreducible unitary repre sentation of two fold covering of g such that its restriction to g is a multiple of we denote the corresponding representation obtained by using the orbit method by let n be the unipotent radical of g n lien is its lie algebra n is the restriction of onto n we denote g 1 g n g 1 lieg 1 and 1 g 1 it is easy to see that 1 ap g 1 and there exists a representation 1 x i g 1 1 uniquely defined by such that indgg 1 g 1 1 1 repeat the procedure with 1 1 b g 1 suppose that n 1 is the unipotent radical of g 1 we have a finite sequence say r steps gr gr r n r r r b gr following the rule of step induction we have indgg 1 ind g 1 g 2 ind gr 1 gr gr r r indggr gr r r suppose that gr r is the representation of nilpotent lie group defined bya kirillov we choose the reductive factors following the levi decomposition of gr in gr r we have a semi direct product g r s n r because the action of s fix r then can be canonically extended into a projective representation of s in the space of the representation it is well known that there exists an irreducible unitary representation can be projective uniquely defined by of s such that gr r r passing to the two fold covering we cain always consider as a unitary representation of s if s lies then there exists a xs uniquely defined by such that s 6 bibliographical remarks 267 theorem 5 2 every generic irreducible unitary representation of a re ductive or semi simple lie group can be obtained as a representation re peatedly induced from irreducible representations of closed normal subgroups and hence in each induction step we can apply the compactness criteria proof from the construction as analyzed above it is easy to see that gi are closed normal subgroup in gi 1 r l lipsman li 2 has had seen that one can restrict to consider only the square integrable s in this case gr r r is ccr then following the gel fand piateskij schapiro theorem on ccr property on each induction step we can apply the compactness criteria 6 bibliographical remarks the main idea of this chapter appeared in d 1 and d 2 the author started from a concrete example of the affine transformation group and then generalized into the main situation of c algebras of type i which admit some boundary properties guaranting existence of a canonical composition series for the group c algebras the author funded out some geometric criteria this results were published in d 7 268 9 index of type i c algebras chapter 10 invariant index of group c algebras this chapter is devoted to studying harmonic l 1 analysis on lie groups it is more complicate than the problem of studying harmonic l 2 analysis exposed in the previous section we must consider the so called the fourier gel fand transformation for functions in place of the well defined fourier transformation we shall see that there are some analytical difficulties which require introducing k theory in order to find topological invariants for func tion algebras below we introduce the problem define the construction of indices of group c algebras and illustrate the construction with examples 1 the structure of group c algebras let g be a locally compact group and dg the right left invariant haar measure in the previous section it was shown that the constructed ir reducible representations are enough to decompose the right regular rep resentation of g in l 2 g dg into a sum of the so called discrete series part and the continuous series part l 2 g dg d it is more complicate to study the class l 1 function algebra l 1 g dg with the well known convolution product x g y y 1 x dy and with involution 7 x x 1 remember that with the l 1 norm l 1 l 1 g x dx l 1 g dg is a banach involutive algebra but its norm l 1 is not regular in general a a l 1 a 2 l 1 we try to introduce therefore some regular norm recall the well known fourier gel fand transformation l 1 7 g x x dx g 269 270 10 invariant index of group c algebras we define the new c norm c g by c g sup g this norm is regular i e c g 2 c g the group c algebra c g is defined as the completion of l 1 g dg with respect to this regular norm c g if g is commutative it returns to the fourier gel fand transform and c g c g with the planchere l theorem is related the well known pontrijagin duality if g is compact but possibly non commutative c g i 1 matni c in particular c s 1 c 0 z what is just the fourier analysis theory of class l 1 functions the planchere l type theorem on this class is the so called tanaka krein duality the situation is rather complicate in cases where g is non compact and noncommutative some spectacular results were obtained in 1962 by j m g fell for c sl 2 c and some times later by others for c sl 2 r c s l 2 r by the same method of analytic description of the non commutative fourier gel fand transforms the question about the structure of the group c algebra c g was open for example for the simplest non trivial solvable lie group of affine transformations of the real straight line r aff r g a b r r x 7 ax b x r a 6 0 a b r for g aff r it was well known a detailed description of the dual object g already in 1945 by i m gel fand and m a naimark g consists of one infinite dimensional representation t which is itself dense in the whole g all the other representations are the one dimensional representations more precisely the characters u 0 1 r u a b sgn a a 1 the irreducible unitary representation t can be realized in the space l 2 r dx x where r r 0 by the formula t a b f x exp 1 bx f ax now if we consider the connected component of identity g 0 aff r 0 a b aff r a 0 2 construction of indexc g 271 there are two infinite dimensional representations the closure of them con tains one parameter family u r of one dimensional representations more precisely the characters u a b a 1 these representations t u r exhaust the dual object g 0 and are in a one to one correspondence with the co adjoint orbits g g b r however the structure of the group c algebra c aff r and c aff r 0 was unknown until 1975 when the bdf k functor ext was used to calcu late the topological invariant indexc g for these groups this topological invariant indexc g defines the topological equivalence class of c g up to some isomorphisms so it was computed that indexc aff r 1 1 ext s 1 s 1 z z indexc aff r 0 1 1 ext c s 1 k k z z 2 construction of indexc g let us denote by g a connected and simply connected lie group g lieg its lie algebra g homr g r the dual vector space o o g the space of all the co adjoint orbits of g in g this space is a disjoint union of subspaces of co adjoint orbits of fixed dimension i e o 0 2 n dimgo 2 n o 2 n o dim 2 n we define v 2 n dim 2 n then it is easy to see that v 2 n is the set of points of a fixed rank of the poisson structure bilinear function x y f f x y hence it is a foliation at least for v 2 n 2 n max proposition 2 1 the foliation v 2 n can be obtained by the associated action of r 2 n on v 2 n via 2 n times repeated action of r proof indeed fixing any basis x 1 x 2 x 2 n of the tangent space g gf of at the point f we can define an action r 2 n y v 2 n as r y r y r y v 2 n by t 1 t 2 t 2 n 7 exp t 1 x 1 exp t 2 nx 2 n f 272 10 invariant index of group c algebras thus we have the hamiltonian vector fields k d dt t 0 exp tkxk f k 1 2 2 n and the linear span f 2 n 1 2 2 n provides a tangent distribution the proposition is proved theorem 2 1 v 2 n f 2 n is a measurable foliation in the sense of a connes proof let us denote by fk the generating function of the hamiltonian vector field k i e dfk k f 0 where f is the symplectic structure on co adjoint orbit f it is well known that in every symplectic manifold fk is uniquely up to an additive constant defined by its hamiltonian vector field k we have df 1 df 2 df 2 n 1 2 n 1 f 2 n f pfaff f 2 v olume element 6 0 the theorem is proved corollary 2 1 the connes c algebra c v 2 n f 2 n 0 2 n dimg are well defined now we assume that the orbit method gives us a complete list of irre ducible representations of g f ind g f p xg f the finite set of duflo s data suppose that o ki 1 o 2 ni is the decomposition of the orbit space on a stratification of orbits of di mensions 2 ni where n 1 n 2 nk 0 we include c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 into c g it is well known that the connes c algebra of foliation can be included in the algebra of pseudo differential operators of degree 0 as an ideal this algebra of pseudo differential oper ators of degree 0 is included in c g we define j 1 f o g o 2 n 1 ker f and a 1 c g j 1 2 construction of indexc g 273 then c g c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 a 1 and we have 0 j 1 c g a 1 0 id 0 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 c g c g c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 0 hence j 1 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 and we have o c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 c g a 1 0 repeating the procedure in replacing c g c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 a 1 j 1 by a 1 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 a 2 j 2 we have 0 c v 2 n 2 f 2 n 2 a 1 a 2 0 etc so it is proved the following result theorem 2 2 the group c algebra c g can be included in a finite sequence of extensions 1 0 c v 2 n 1 f 2 n 1 c g a 1 0 2 0 c v 2 n 2 f 2 n 2 a 1 a 2 0 k 0 c v 2 nk f 2 nk ak 1 ak 0 where a k char g corollary 2 2 indexc g is reduced to the system indexc v 2 ni f 2 ni i 1 2 k by the invariants i kk ai c v 2 ni f 2 ni i 1 2 k ideally all these invariants i could be computed step by step from k to 1 274 10 invariant index of group c algebras 3 reduction of the indices let us consider c v 2 ni f 2 ni for a fixed i we introduce the following assumptions which were considered by kasparov in nilpotent cases assumption a 1 there exists k z 0 k 2 ni such that vgen v 2 ni lie has its c algebra c vgen f vgen c o gen k h where rk r 2 ni g lie rk g gfi lie g v 2 ni example 3 1 if vgen is a principal bundle or the space ogen vgen g is a hausdorff space then c vgen f vgen c o gen k h it is easy to see that if the condition a 1 holds c v 2 ni f 2 ni is an ex tension of c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni by c o gen k h whereo gen f f ogen xg f if k 2 ni r 2 ni o v 2 ni vgen we have c v 2 ni f 2 ni c o 2 ni k h if k k 1 2 ni then r 2 ni k 1 acts on v 2 ni vgen and we suppose that a similar assumption a 2 holds a 2 there exists k 2 0 k 2 2 ni k 1 such that v 2 ni vgen gen v 2 ni vgen rk 2 has its c algebra c v 2 ni vgen gen f 2 ni c o 2 ni ogen gen k h as above if k 2 2 ni k 1 c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni c o 2 ni ogen gen k h in other case we repeat the procedure and go to assumption a 3 etc the procedure must be finished after a finite number of steps say in m th step c v 2 ni vgen v 2 ni vgen gen f 2 ni c o 2 ni ogen k h thus we have the following result theorem 3 1 if all the arising assumptions a 1 a 2 hold the c algebra c v 2 ni f 2 ni can be included in a finite sequence of extensions 0 c o gen k h c v 2 ni f 2 ni c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni 0 0 c o 2 ni ogen k h c v 2 ni vgen f 2 ni c 0 0 c o 2 ni ogen o 2 ni ogen gen k h c c k h 0 5
