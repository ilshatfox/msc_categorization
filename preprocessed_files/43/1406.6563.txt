and schneider 1 introduction in classical or topological t duality one starts with a circle bundle p e b over a locally compact base space b together with a class h 3 e z often called h flux then t duality provides an involution e 7 e of circle bundles over b with h flux satisfying a number of interesting properties we refer to rosenberg s cbms memoir ro 09 for a detailed axiomatic definition of this classical notion of t duality see ro 09 axiomatics 6 1 2 and an explanation of how this relates to string theory there is a completely topological construction of t duality due to bunke and schick bs 05 another approach due to raeburn and rosenberg in rr 88 see also ro 09 chapter 7 is completely c algebraic in nature given the data e as above there is a unique stable continuous trace algebra ct e i e an algebra of continuous c 0 sections of a locally trivial field of compact operators over e with dixmier douady invariant h 3 e z and the results in rr 88 show that there is an essentially unique r action on ct e which covers the action of r on e given by inflating the given circle action moreover they show that there is a unique circle bundle e over b together with a class h 3 e z such that ct e o r ct e note that this c algebraic description of t duality has the advantage that it gives a direct connection of the twisted k theories of e and e by the connes thom isomorphism there is a natural isomorphism k e k ct e k 1 ct e o r k 1 e note that takai duality provides an isomorphism ct e o r ct e o r o r ct e k l 2 r ct e which shows that this construction really provides an involution on the category of circle bundles over b with h flux unfortunately for higher dimensional torus bundles the theory becomes much more involved since in general there does not exist a classical dual pair e for a given pair e for a principal tn bundle p e b if n 2 however in mr 05 mathai and rosenberg show that in case n 2 there always exist non unique non commutative t duals which are section algebras of bundles of stable non commutative tori moreover the possible duality pairs can be classified with the help of a certain mackey obstruction map the construction extends the ideas explained above recall that the non commutative 2 tori are just the twisted group algebras c z 2 for h 2 z 2 u 1 and similarly for higher dimensional tori now given a pair e as above in which p e b is a principal t 2 bundle there exists in general a non unique action of r 2 on ct e which covers the given t 2 action on e and then the t dual is constructed as the crossed product ct e or 2 indeed writing e locally as ui t 2 the action of r 2 on the invariant ideal ct ui t 2 ct e is induced from an action of the lattice z 2 r 2 on ct ui ui hence the ideal ct ui t 2 or 2 is stably isomorphic to ct ui ui oz 2 which is a section algebra of a continuous c bundle with fibres k o x z 2 k c z 2 x at x ui where x h 2 z 2 u 1 is the mackey obstruction for implementing the action x on the fibre k at x as the adjoint action non commutative t duality 3 of a homomorphism u z 2 u h if k k h later in mr 06 the authors extended these results to higher dimensional tori where the obstruction for the existence of a possibly non commutative t dual is given by the requirement that the class h 3 e z vanishes on the fibres of p e b which is automatic if n 2 again the connes thom isomorphism always provides an isomorphism up to dimension shift by n of the relevant k theories it is obvious that the resulting duality theory lacks symmetry while on one side we have a classical pair e there is often a non commutative torus bundle on the dual side in this paper we start to investigate a symmetric version of non commutative t duality in which we allow non commutative torus bundles on both sides of the duality the framework we develop in this article is general enough to work for general locally compact abelian groups g with discrete and co compact subgroups n g and is not necessarily coupled to the motivating example g rn n zn let us summarise some of its main content we introduce some notation and review some basic knowledge about c dynamical systems in section 2 then section 3 starts with a recapitulation of mathai s and rosenberg s t duality over the one point space it serves as a motivation for our framework for general non commutative t duality over the one point space as it is given in 3 2 this means to identify a sub category nct n g t of the category of all c dynamical systems whose objects are stable twisted transformation group algebras of n equipped with transverse g actions definition 3 9 this subcategory is dual to nct n g t by the du ality functor og theorem 3 12 in particular for g rn n zn we obtain a self duality of the category of stable non commutative tori nct zn rn t with transverse rn actions in section 3 3 we construct a cohomological invariant nct n g t h 2 n u 1 on the set of isomorphism classes of these objects this allows us to re obtain the classical i e commutative subtheory inside our theory it is the kernel of this map theorem 3 20 section 3 4 describes the complete picture of non commutative t duality in two and three dimensions i e for g rn n zn n 2 3 over the one point space in section 4 we turn to the global situation of non commutative t duality the objects which we consider therein are bundles of c algebras whose fibres are stable twisted group algebras which satisfy a certain local triviality property which we call triviality definition 4 2 for g rn n zn the theory over the one point space directly generalises to the bundle case in particular we establish a duality for these bundles and we re obtain the classical t duality as a subcategory characterised point wise by a trivial cohomological invariant for more general groups some technical assumptions have to be made section 5 presents in detail some examples of non commutative t duality over the circle in particular we give an example of a locally trivial bundle which does not arise as a dual of a commutative bundle thereby showing that in our framework the class of objects is bigger than in the approaches made so far 4 echterhoff and schneider 2 notation and preliminaries 2 1 abelian groups throughout this paper g will always denote an abelian hausdorff second countable locally compact group its dual group the goup of characters g hom g u 1 is equipped with the compact open topology it is again an abelian hausdorff second countable and locally compact group ru 90 the bidual g is canonically isomorphic to g and we use both of the notations g and g to denote g u 1 for g g g we assume that we have given a discrete and co compact subgroup n g then its annihilator n g n 1 is discrete and co compact in g and there are cannonical identifications n g n and n g n the most prominent and guiding example of groups that fit into this situation is for n n the self dual example zn rn tn where tn is the n fold torus rn zn another self dual example for n n is qn an sn where the discrete rational numbers q sit inside the adeles a and the quotient is the solenoid s the dual group of the rationals see hr 2 2 c dynamical systems by the term c algebra we will typically mean a separable c algebra the c automorphism group aut a of a c algebra a is equipped with the topology of point wise convergence an action g aut a is just a continuous group homomorphism usually called strongly continuous and such a triple a g is called a c dynamical system if a g is a c dynamical system with g abelian then its dual is the system ao g g where the crossed product ao g is the enveloping c algebra of the banach algebra l 1 g which is l 1 g a equipped with the product f f g g f h h f g h dh and with involution f g g f g for f f l 1 g a the dual action is given on the dense subspace l 1 g a just by point wise multiplication f f for g f l 1 g a recall the famous takai duality theorem e g see w 07 theorem 7 1 theorem 2 1 there is a g equivariant isomorphism ao g o g g a k l 2 g g ad where k l 2 g is the algebra of compact operators on l 2 g is the right regular representation of g on l 2 g and ad denotes the conjugation action of the unitary operators on the compacts 2 3 morita equivalent actions assume that a g and b g are two c dynamical systems recall that a morita equivalence e between a g and b g consists of an a b equivalence bimodule e together with an action non commutative t duality 5 g aut e which is compatible with the given actions and in the sense that g a g g a g b g g b holds for all e and g g if e is such a morita equivalence then cc g e becomes a cc g a cc g b bimodule by defining the left and right actions and the inner products by the convolution formulas f g g f h g g h dh f g g h h f g h dh cc g a g g a h g g h dh cc g b g g g h g h b dh for all cc g e f cc g a and f cc g b with these operations cc g e completes to a a o g b o g equivalence bimodule e o g which equipped with the dual action g aut e o g given by point wise multipli cation g g g for all g cc g e gives an equivariant morita equivalence e o g for the dual systems a o g g and b o g g see c 84 e 94 for further details example 2 2 if there is an equivariant isomorphism a b we consider a as an a b bimodule with inner products given by a a b ab and a b b a b then a gives a morita equivalence between a g and b g moreover for any system a g the system a k l 2 g g ad is morita equivalent to a g with bimodule a l 2 g and action g aut a l 2 g thus it follows from takai s duality theorem that a g is morita equivalent to the double dual system ao g o g g the morita equivalence between and is a primal case of an important morita equivalence which will play a fundamental ro le in this paper let us review some other special cases of morita equivalences which will appear in this work for reference see pe 79 section 8 11 example 2 3 1 exterior equivalence if and are actions on the same c algebra a then they are called exterior equivalent if there exists a strictly continuous map to the unitary group of the multiplier algebra of a v g um a g 7 vg such that g a vg g a v g vg h vg g vh for all g h g a a let e a be the canonical a a equivalence and define g aut e by g a vg g a for g g and a e then it is easily checked that this implements a 6 echterhoff and schneider morita equivalence between a g and a g we say that v implements the exterior equivalence between and in this case there is a canonical isomorphism v ao g ao g v f g f g v g f cc g a which is equivariant hence induces an isomorphism for the dual actions 2 outer conjugacy two systems a g and b g are outer conjugate if there exists an isomorphism a b such that is exterior equivalent to the action 1 3 stable outer conjugacy this is rather the most general form of morita equiv alence in fact it is an equivalent notion for c algebras which have a countable ap proximate identity or equivalently which contain strictly positive elements c 84 two systems a g and b g are stably outer conjugate if the two systems a k g id and b k g id are outer conjugate where k is the algebra of compact operators on some separable hilbert space if g aut a is an action we can restrict it to the subgroup n g and then cc g a completes to give an ao n hilbert module egn a if the right action of ao n and the ao n valued inner products are defined on the level of cc n a as aon n g h h m h dh f g n g n g n f n dn for cc g a f cc n a there is a canonical left action of the dual system a o g n on egn a which is given by the covariant representation u in which f f for f cc g a and u point wise multiplication the integrated form u ao go n l egn a defines a left action of ao go n on egn a which by e 94 proposition 2 1 implements an isomorphism onto k egn a l and k denote the adjointable and compact operators of a module respectively of course this is just a reformulation of green s famous imprimitivity theorem g 78 theorem 17 in e 94 proposition 3 4 and lemma 3 6 it is shown that the resulting morita equivalence between a o g o n and a o n is equivariant with respect to certain actions by g and g for notation given an action g aut a for the abelian group g and n g is a closed subgroup of g we let dec g aut ao n denote the action given by dech f g h f g g h g f cc g a and if g n aut b is an action of the quotient group we denote by inf g aut b the inflation of to g combining the results of e 94 proposition 3 4 and lemma 3 6 we then get proposition 2 4 in the above situation egn a becomes an a o g o n ao n imprimitivity bimdule moreover if we define actions and of g and g on egn a by g h g h and g g g non commutative t duality 7 for cc g a then egn a is a morita equivalence between ao go n g inf n and ao n g dec and egn a is a morita equivalence between ao go n g dec and ao n g inf n 2 4 actions on k twisted group algebras and 2 cocycles consider the short exact sequence 1 u 1 u h ad pu h 1 where u h is the unitary group of some separable hilbert space h and pu h is the projective unitary group the quotient of the unitaries by its center it induces a not very long exact sequence in borel cohomology h 1 g u h h 1 g pu h ma h 2 g u 1 1 which terminates at h 2 g u 1 due to the non commutativity of the involved coefficient groups the negative of the usual connecting homomorphism 1 ma is called mackey obstruction now because u h um k the unitary group of the multiplier algebra of the compacts k k h and because all automorphisms of k are inner conjugation defines a canonical isomorphism pu h aut k so if g aut k is an action on the compacts i e h 1 g pu h it defines a class ma h 2 g u 1 the mackey obstruction of the action is said to be unitary if its mackey obstruction vanishes note that any class h 2 g u 1 arises as a mackey obstruction of some action g aut k just put g ad l g where l g u l 2 g is the left regular representation of g i e l g h g h g h g l 2 g g h g 2 then ma 1 the following statement shows that actions on k are classified up to morita or exterior equivalence by the borel cohomology group h 2 g u 1 we refer to ckrw 93 section 6 3 for a more general result proposition 2 5 suppose g aut k are two actions of g on k then the following are equivalent 1 and are exterior equivalent 2 and are morita equivalent 3 ma ma h 2 g u 1 if ma then the crossed product ko g is isomorphic to 2 k co g where co g denotes the twisted group c algebra of g with respect to the cocycle 1 we choose the convention ma v for a borel lift v g u h of g pu h 2 here we see that our sign convention of ma is the right one for otherwise we would obtain k c o 1 g k o g 8 echterhoff and schneider this is the enveloping c algebra of the banach algebra l 1 g given by the banach space l 1 g with convolution and involution given by f f g g f h f g h h g h dh and 3 f g g g f g the isomorphism k co g ko g is given on the level of l 1 functions by k f g f g kv g k k f l 1 g 4 where v g u h is a borel lift of i e 1 cochain such that its boundary is 1 see e 96 theorem 1 4 15 note that this isomorphism is equivariant with respect to the canonical dual actions of g on ko g and on k co g given by point wise multiplication with characters it is an immediate consequence of proposition 2 5 and of takai duality that up to equivariant morita equivalence the twisted group algebra equipped with the dual g action is also classified by the cohomology class h 2 g u 1 one should regard the twisted group algebra co g as a deformation of c 0 g c o 1 g where 1 denotes the trivial cocycle on g in particular the twisted group algebras co zn are deformations of c tn and they are called non commutative n tori in this picture the dual action of tn on c o zn is the analogue of the translation action of tn on c tn in the commutative case we have a natural isomorphism between the additive group mu n r of strictly upper triangular real matrices and h 2 rn u 1 which is given by sending a matrix a to the class of the cocycle a given by a x y exp 2 i ax ty under this identification the restriction map h 2 rn u 1 h 2 zn u 1 7 zn zn which is surjective has kernel given by the collection of all classes corresponding to the set mu n z of strictly upper triangular matrices with integer coefficients so the non commutative n tori are classified up to tn equivariant morita equivalence by h 2 zn u 1 mu n r mu n z tn n 1 2 we refer to bk 73 for further details moreover for every action of zn on k we can find an action of rn on k such that the restriction zn is morita equivalent to choose an action corresponding to any class h 2 rn u 1 which restricts to ma if h 2 g u 1 for the abelian group g then determines a continuous homomorphism h g g given by 5 h g h g h h g 1 for all g h g h only depends on the class h 2 g u 1 and h 0 if and only if 0 the kernel s g of h is called the symmetry group of a cocycle is said to be totally skew if s 0 and is said to be type i if the image h g is closed in g recall that for any c algebra a prim a denotes the space of primitive ideals non commutative t duality 9 of a equipped with the jacobson topology with these notations the following results have been shown by baggett and kleppner in bk 73 section 3 theorem 2 6 for z 2 g u 1 the following are true 1 there is a canonical bijection between s and prim co g given by induc tion of representations in particular c o g is simple if and only if is totally skew 2 the image h g is always a dense subgroup of s g thus is type i if and only if h g s 3 the c algebra c o g is type i if and only if is type i moreover the map h h 2 g u 1 hom g g 7 h 6 is injective combining 1 and 3 of the above theorem we see that c o g is simple and type i if and only if is type i and totally skew i e h g g is an isomorphism since every separable simple type i c algebra is isomorphic to an algebra of compact operators on some separable hilbert space we see that c o g k h for some separable hilbert space h if and only if is totally skew and type i then the dual action g aut co g aut k h is again classified by a class h 2 g u 1 this class has been computed by one of the authors in e 96 lemma 3 3 5 proposition 2 7 suppose that z 2 g u 1 is a type i and totally skew 2 cocycle then the mackey obstruction for the dual action g aut c o g is given by the class of the cocycle h 1 z 2 g u 1 where the push forward is pullback along the inverse h 1 i e h 1 h 1 h 1 1 g we call h 1 the dual cocycle of and we leave the following lemma as an exercise for the reader lemma 2 8 suppose that z 2 g u 1 is type i and totally skew then h h 1 h 1 which implies that the dual cocycle h 1 is also totally skew and type i this also implies that the double dual cocycle agrees with the original one h h 1 h 1 1 example 2 9 let g rn and let us identify r n with rn via the canonical isomorphism x 7 x with x y exp 2 i xty let a x y exp 2 i ax ty for some strictly upper diagonal matrix a m n r then h a x y exp 2 i ax ty ay tx exp 2 i ax ty ax y with a a at the skew symmetric matrix corresponding to a thus we see that up to the identification r n rn the homomorphism h a is given by the linear map x 7 ax it follows that a is always type i and a is totally skew if and only if a is invertible the dual cocycle is then given by b with b 1 a a 1 a 10 echterhoff and schneider 3 stable nc tori nc t duality over the one point space 3 1 introduction we start our discussion of t duality with bundles over a point the trivial principal tn bundle over the point is just the n torus tn equipped with the translation action of tn on itself suppose that h 3 tn z allows an action of rn on the corresponding stable continuous trace c algebra ct tn which covers the inflated action of rn on tn prim ct tn since tn rn zn it follows from e 90 theorem that ct tn is equivariantly isomorphic to the induced algebra indr n zn k where denotes the action of the stabiliser z n on the fibre k ct tn z of ct tn over some chosen point z tn recall that for any action n aut b on a c algebra b the induced system indgn b g ind is given by indgn b f cb g b f g n n f g for all g g n n and gn 7 f g c 0 g n equipped with the point wise operations and with g action ind which is just given by left sign translation by the discussion in the previous section we may assume up to equivariant morita equivalence that zn for some action rn aut k but then we obtain an isomorphism indr n zn k c t n k k c tn f g g f g which transforms the induced action ind to the diagonal action 3 inf thus we learn the following facts which have been observed before by mathai and rosenberg in mr 05 mr 06 firstly the class is trivial i e ct tn k c tn secondly up to equivariant morita equivalence the action is given by a diagonal action inf recall from mr 05 mr 06 that in the above setting the possibly non commu tative dual torus is given again up to equivariant morita equivalence by the crossed product k c tn o inf rn equipped with the dual action of r n rn by the equivariant version of green s imprimitivity theorem this is a special case of ekqr 06 theorem 4 11 this system is morita equivalent to ko zn equipped with the action of rn which is inflated from the dual action of tn on ko zn by the discussion in the previous section we know that ko zn is equivariantly isomorphic to k c o zn equipped with the inflated action id inf if ma to summarise the point wise duality picture of mathai and rosenberg there are stabilised commutative tori k c tn with a diagonal action inf of rn on one side and there are stabilised non commutative tori k co zn with action id inf on the other side this motivates the content of this section which is the investigation of c dynamical systems k c o n g inf 7 where we will typically assume that the 2 cocycle on n has an extension to g and g aut k is an action which is not necessarily trivial by takai duality 3 to keep notation down whenever there is a canonical action of a quotient g n or g n we will simply denote by inf rather than by inf the inflated action of g or g non commutative t duality 11 the study of 7 is equivalent to the study of its dual system k c o n o inf g g inf 8 and we need to understand under which circumstances there is a morita equivalence 8 k c o n g inf 3 2 iterated crossed products and transversality for an action g aut k let us analyse the iterated crossed product k c o n o inf g 9 where we assume that the 2 cocycle has an extension to g which we again denote by we need definition 3 1 suppose that g is a locally compact abelian group 1 by the heisenberg cocycle on g g we understand the 2 cocycle given by h g g 2 the heisenberg cocycle on g g is denoted by i e h g h 3 for z 2 g u 1 and z 2 g u 1 we denote by the product in which we regard and as cocycles on g g by pullback along the projections to g and g respectively similarly we define z 2 g g u 1 lemma 3 2 if is the mackey obstruction of then 9 is g equivariantly isomorphic to k c o n g 10 where g acts dually on the second factor of n g proof the product and the involution of the crossed product 9 on the basis of the inflation action are given in terms of the pairing n g u 1 which on the level of l 1 functions can be expressed in terms of the cocycle in fact similar to 4 we can define an isomorphism k l 1 n g l 1 n g k l 1 g k l 1 n k co n g l 1 g k c o n k c o n o inf g by k f n f n kv where v g u h is a borel map with ad v and such that 1 v it is straightforward to check that this isomorphism is g equivariant with respect to the dual actions 12 echterhoff and schneider applying proposition 2 4 to 10 for the subgroup n g g g we obtain the morita equivalent system k c o g g odual n 0 11 whereon g acts by the dual action on the second group factor of the inner crossed product we want to apply proposition 2 7 to this inner crossed product so we are interested in the properties of h g g g g defined in 5 lemma 3 3 the homomorphism h g g g g is given by h h idg idg h g 7 h g h g proof we have h g h g h h g 1 h g h h h g 1 h g h h g the canonical identification g g yields the result lemma 3 4 the following three conditions are equivalent 1 idg h h g g is an isomorphism 2 id g h h g g is an isomorphism 3 h is an isomorphism proof the equivalence of the first two statements follows from the observation that is the dual of alternatively if 1 exists then a one line calculation shows that id g h 1 h is an inverse for now if h is an isomorphism then h flip h flip h idg id g h is an isomorphism where flip g g g g is transposition then the composed ismorphism is h h id g h h 0 0 idg h h 0 0 conversely if are isomorphisms then h 1 h 1 0 0 1 exists and is obviously a right inverse the property of being a left inverse requires a small calculation first we have h 1 h h 1 h 1 h 1 1 h 1 h h 1 1 h 1 h non commutative t duality 13 inserting now 1 id g h 1 h into this we derive at h 1 h idg 0 0 id g let s assume one of the equivalent conditions of lemma 3 4 then the inner crossed product in 11 is isomorphic to the compacts having determined h 1 we can compute the dual cocycle h 1 according to proposition 2 7 the result helps us to understand the remaining outer crossed product with n in 11 and also the remaining g action on it to state the result some more notation is useful definition 3 5 for a 2 cocycle on g and a 2 cocycle on g we define new cocycles on g and g by o h 1 o h 1 moreover if idg h h is an isomorphism we define o o o o lemma 3 6 in h 2 g g u 1 the following equality holds 4 h 1 o o idg 12 where the classes on g and g are understood as classes on g g by pullback along the projections proof before we start with the actual computation we need to be aware of some general cocycle properties let be a 2 cocycle on any abelian group twofold application of the cocycle identity gives x y x y y x y x x 1 x y 1 0 x x y 1 y y x x 1 x y 1 which means that c x x x 0 0 is a cochain that implements x y y x 1 furthermore a fourfold application of the cocycle identity gives a x b y a b x y x b b x 1 a x 1 b y 1 a b x y or if we define a 2 cocycle on the product of the group with itself by a x b y a x b y 1 then a x b y a b 1 x y 1 h x b 1 d a x b y a b 1 x y 1 x h b where d is the boundary operator on the product of the group with itself 4 we denote the group operation on u 1 valued 2 cocycles multiplicatively whereas we denote the group operation on any cohomology group additively 14 echterhoff and schneider let us now turn to the actual computation by definition we have to compute h 1 1 for h 1 h idg id g h 1 0 0 1 let us use the shorthands 1 and g 1 g then we have h 1 g h h g h h 1 13 h g h h 1 14 h g h h 1 15 the middle term 14 decomposes to 14 h h g h 1 1 g h h g 1 h h g h 1 g h h g 1 but as g h 7 h is cohomologous to g h 7 g 1 just by the cochain g 7 g this can be transformed to 14 g 1 h g h 1 1 g h h g 1 to transform 13 and 15 we apply the above identity for we find 15 1 h g h h 1 h g h and 13 h h 1 g h 1 g h h h h 1 h g g h h multiplying these partial results we get 13 14 15 g h h 1 16 g h h g h 1 h 1 which is the claimed formula up to the minus sign inside the argument of how ever the injectivity of the map 7 h hom g g implies that so the lemma is proven remark 3 7 it is very important for later purposes theorem 4 8 to observe at this point that the computation done in the proof of lemma 3 6 is based on explicit cochains given in terms of or up to and including 16 only the very last step required an abstract argument if is cohomologous to a bicharacter then this last relation can also be made explicit let dc for some bicharacter then dc dc dc dc 1 dc dc non commutative t duality 15 for c c c 1 these explicit cohomology relations are abstract cocycle identities and do not depend on u 1 as a module in fact lemma 3 6 remains valid if 1 the involved cocycles are not just u 1 valued but c b u 1 valued trivial module structure for some space b if 2 they are cohomologous to bihomomor phisms rather than bicharacters and if 3 we have control over the continuity properties of the quantities h h which then should be regarded as bundle maps b g h b g h b g b b b this will ensure that if a cocycle with values in c b u 1 is point wise pulled back by h h or pushed foreward by which involves inversion in aut g then the resulting point wise defined object is again mapping to c b u 1 equality 12 then holds in h 2 g g c b u 1 the structure of h 1 given by its three summands now immedi ately yields the following corollary corollary 3 8 if is an isomorphism the crossed product 11 is g equivariantly isomorphic to k k c o o n 17 where g acts by id in for an action with mackey obstruction ma o in h 2 g u 1 and in g f n g 1 n 1 f n so except from the part of the action given by in we have found a structure rather similar to the one with which we have started to manipulate it a little further we need an extra assumption definition 3 9 1 a homomorphism g g is said to be an automorphism of n g if it is an automorphism of g and if it maps n bijectively to itself we denote by aut n g the set of all of those 2 a pair of cocycles g g u 1 g g u 1 or their cohomology classes is called transverse if idg h h aut n g equivalently one might require that id g h h is an automorphism of n g 3 the binary relation defined by transversality is denoted by t h 2 g u 1 h 2 g u 1 i e t if and only if and are transverse 4 let inf be a g action on k c o n the actions or inf or the dynamical system k co n g inf are called transverse if the cocycle n n u 1 has an extension to g such that t ma corollary 3 10 if the dynamical system k co n g inf is transverse then its dual system k co n o inf g g inf k k co o n g id in 16 echterhoff and schneider is g equivariantly isomorphic to k c o o n where g acts by inf with mackey obstruction ma o o proof using k k k and corollary 3 8 it suffices to show that k c o o n g in k c o o n g inf by transversality induces an isomorphism of n so it induces an isomorphism c o o n c o o n 18 given by pullback f 7 f similarly the inversion on the group n n induces an automorphism by pullback c o o n c o o n 19 note that in g f n g n 1 f n g n f n so the composition turns in into the ordinary inflation action however pullback of a 2 cocycle along the inversion gives a cocycle that is similar to the original one i e they have the same cohomology class see remark 3 7 then their twisted group algebras are equivariantly isomorphic by takai duality we know that the dual of the constructed system k c o o n inf i e the bidual of the original system is morita equivalent to the original trans verse system the following lemma shows that the dual system of a transverse system is transverse again lemma 3 11 the assignment 7 o o defines a bijection t t such that t t aut n g id aut n g commutes where the vertical arrows are given by the tautological map proof firstly id h o h o is an isomorphism of n g a one line computation gives hh 1 h h h g g and so h o h h 1 h h h h h wherein as before id h h the same algebra gives h o h o 1 h o 1 1 h therefore id h o h o id h 1 h which is an automorphism of n g by assumption this also shows that the diagram of the lemma commutes secondly another straight forward calculation shows that the inverse of 7 o o is given by 7 o o non commutative t duality 17 corollary 3 10 tells that transversality gives a sufficient condition to answer the question raised in 8 combining it together with lemma 3 11 we have found a class of c dynamical systems which is closed under taking crossed products let us de note by nct n g the 2 category of systems k co n g inf which has g equivariant morita equivalences as 1 morphisms and equivariant isomorphisms between them as 2 morphisms there is a proper subcategory nct n g t nct n g which consists of systems which are 2 isomorphic i e morita equiva lent to a transverse representative this whole section is summarised in theorem 3 12 the duality functor og defined on all c dynamical systems with group g restricts to a duality of transverse dynamical systems c dynamical systems with group g c dynamical systems with group g nct n g nct n g nct n g t nct n g t 3 3 classification remarks recall from section 2 4 that the c dynamical sys tems ko n or c o n equipped with their canonical n actions are classified up to equivariant morita equivalence by second borel cohomology ma h 2 n u 1 we start with an example that illustrates that the objects with which we are dealing are more involved example 3 13 let g r 2 and n z 2 and choose 1 3 2 3 r z t h 2 n u 1 denote by 3 an action of g r 2 on k with mackey obstruction 3 r h 2 r 2 u 1 then there is a g equivariant morita equivalence k c o 2 3 n 3 inf k c o 1 3 n id inf proof a lengthy but direct proof is given in appendix a using our theory of transversality one can significantly shorten the proof this is done in section 3 4 below to understand why this example could possibly be true let us try to understand what can be said in general about an equality of classes 1 2 h 2 n u 1 if there is a g equivariant morita equivalence 20 k c o 1 n k c o 2 n where g acts on both sides diagonally by actions on the compacts i g aut k i 1 2 tensor the inflated actions infi g aut c o i n i 1 2 on the respective twisted group c algebras denote by s n the symmetry group of 2 that is the kernel of the map h 2 n n the dual group s of s is homeomorphic to the primitive spectrum of k co 2 n and by the daums hofmann theorem 18 echterhoff and schneider see w 07 the u 1 valued functions thereon are isomorphic to the center of the unitary group of its multiplier algebra i e there is a short exact sequence 1 c s u 1 um k c o 2 n ad inn k c o 2 n 1 and this sequence is n equivariant for the actions that are induced by the dual action on k c o 2 n on c s u 1 this action is just translation in the argument after restriction n s using the polish topology on inn a induced from the polish strict topology of um a together with rr 88 corollary 0 2 this short exact sequence induces a not very long exact sequence in borel cohomology h 1 n c s u 1 h 1 n um k c o 2 n h 1 n inn k c o 2 n h 2 n c s u 1 which terminates at h 2 n c s u 1 due to the non commutativity of the in volved coefficient groups now let us tensor both sides of 20 with another copy of the compacts which we then equip with an action op 1 which has the inverse mackey obstruction of 1 ma op 1 ma 1 as op 1 1 is morita equivalent to the trivial action we have to deal with the morita equivalent actions id id inf 1 and op 1 2 inf 2 because being morita equivalent is the same as being stably outer conjugate we conclude that the action on the left hand side id id inf 1 is conjugate to ad u op 1 2 inf 2 ad u op 1 2 id id id inf 2 for some continuous 1 cocycle u g um k k c o 2 n it follows right from the definition of that it vanishes on n indeed we have the following lemma 3 14 the above defined map factors over the quotient map g inn k k c o 2 n n 66 and satisfies the cocycle relation n m n n m n m n where is precisely the action of n on the inner automorphisms that occurred in the short exact sequence above proof let s denote the isomorphism which implements the stable outer conjugacy between the two actions by i e id id inf 1 1 id id inf 2 non commutative t duality 19 and let i id id infi we just compute 1 1 12 1 1 1 1 12 1 1 12 2 1 1 12 12 2 1 2 the multiplication action on the unitary group of the multiplier algebra turns into conjugation when passsing to the inner automorphisms by ad so we obtain the cocycle identity n for in particular it follows that n n for n n i e is constant on the cosets the cocycle determines a cohomology class which by abuse of notation we again denote by h 1 n inn k k c o 2 n by the not very long exact sequence it defines an obstruction class h 2 n c s u 1 if this obstruction class vanishes has a unitary lift and this lift then implements a morita equivalence between the two actions infi i 1 2 the next lemma shows that in this case the classes 1 2 h 2 n u 1 agree if we assume that these classes extend to g lemma 3 15 let 1 2 h 2 n u 1 be two classes in the image of the restriction map h 2 g u 1 h 2 n u 1 if c o 1 n c o 2 n is a g equivariant morita equivalence where g acts on both sides by the inflated actions then 1 2 h 2 n u 1 proof if i is a g action on k with mackey obstruction i then k c g n with i left translation is the pre dual of co i n i 1 2 but these systems are induced systems indgn k i n by e 90 theorem which are classified up to morita equivalence by their actions i n n aut k under certain circumstances one might indeed conclude that the obstruction class vanishes corollary 3 16 assume that n is torsion free and assume 2 or 1 is totally skew if there is a g equivariant morita equivalence k c o 1 n k c o 2 n with diagonal g actions on both algebras as assumed in 20 then 1 2 h 2 n u 1 20 echterhoff and schneider proof a totally skew cocycle has trivial symmetry group s 0 and if n is torsion free then n is connected and so the whole obstruction group vanishes h 2 n c s u 1 h 2 n u 1 hom n n 0 in example 3 13 both of the involved non commutative tori were rational how ever if one of the involved classes is irrational then its symmetry group is trivial so one can apply the above corollary example 3 17 let g r 2 n z 2 and let r r z h 2 z 2 u 1 be an irrational number and let r be a corresponding cocycle if there is a r 2 equivariant morita equivalence k c o z 2 k c o r z 2 where r 2 acts on both algebras diagonally as in 20 then r h 2 z 2 u 1 let us continue with some further analysis of the class constructed above consider the following diagram of induced maps h 2 n c s u 1 q 3 h 2 g c s u 1 i h 2 g u 1 i c oo 3 ma op 1 2 h 2 n c s u 1 ev h 2 n u 1 c oo 3 0 where c u 1 c s u 1 is the obvious inclusion and ev c s u 1 u 1 is the evaluation at 0 s which is n equivariant because n acts trivially on both sides as ev c id c is injective it is easily seen that the mackey obstruction class ma op 1 2 of the action op 1 2 g aut k k is connected to by 5 q c ma op 1 2 but the composition i q is zero so by commutativity of the square and by injectivity of c we see that i ma op 1 2 0 and we have just proven the following statement lemma 3 18 let k c o 1 n k c o 2 n be a g equivariant morita equivalence where g acts on both sides diagonally by actions on the compacts i g aut k i 1 2 tensor the inflated actions infi g aut co in i 1 2 on the respective crossed products then the mackey obstructions of the restricted actions i n agree ma 1 n ma 2 n h 2 n u 1 5 the sign reflects the fact that the mackey obstruction is defined to be the negative of the actual connecting homomorphism in 1 non commutative t duality 21 an instance of lemma 3 18 already appeared in example 3 13 wherein the r 2 action 3 has trivial mackey obstruction when restricted to z 2 in general lemma 3 18 gives an obstruction map ma n g nct n g h 2 n u 1 21 here the brackets denote 2 isomorphism classes i e morita equivalence classes this map will enable us to identify the commutative theory inside our theory as we explain next if inf is a transverse g action on k c o n then the previous section shows that its crossed product k c o n o inf g together with the dual g action is morita equivalent to an algebra k co n equipped with a transverse action inf corollary 3 10 determines the class h 2 n u 1 to a certain extend namely ma n t h 2 n u 1 22 where for h 2 n u 1 we have used the notation t o n n t 23 for in the image of the restriction map r es h 2 g u 1 h 2 n u 1 this set is never empty in fact the trivial cocycle 1 is transverse to any cocycle so for n we have n o 1 n t the element relation 22 restricts the possible classes for building the dual algebra to the set ma n t this set is a morita invariant of both the original system k c o n inf and of its dual system just because of lemma 3 18 which states that the class ma n is a morita invariant of the original system however the element itself is not a specified element in ma n t in fact it varies with the choices of the extension of from n to g and these choices can make a difference see section 3 4 for a detailed example nevertheless the following lemma shows that in a very important case the set ma n t reduces to a singleton lemma 3 19 for h 2 n u 1 the following three statements are equivalent 1 0 2 t 0 3 0 t proof let us compute the image of t under h h 2 n u 1 hom n g n let x o n t in the proof of lemma 3 11 we have already seen that h o h for id h h by transversality g g induces an isomorphism g n g n now the commutativities of the outer square of the bottom triangle 22 echterhoff and schneider and of the two trapezoids in n hx h g n g n g oooo g h o h g oooo imply that the upper triangle commutes i e hx h but as is an isomor phism hx vanishes if and only if h vanishes the lemma is then obvious the important thing about this last lemma is that we have found an invariant that can distinguish the commutative systems i e those which are equivariantly morita equivalent to a system k c g n inf from those who are genuinely non commutative let us denote by ct n g nct n g the corresponding subcategory together with the results of the previous section we have found theorem 3 20 the set of 2 isomorphism classes ct n g is the kernel of the composition nct n g t nct n g t h 2 n u 1 in h 2 n u 1 nct n g ma n g oo nct n g ma n g h 2 n u 1 nct n g t nct n g t oo ct n g ct n g 3 4 example duality for the nc torus in dimension 2 let g r 2 g andn z 2 n recall the isomorphismsh 2 z 2 u 1 t andh 2 r 2 u 1 r let us identify the transversality relation t r r a cocycle corresponding to r is given by x y exp 2 i x 2 y 1 so one obtains h 0 0 r 2 r 2 then for some r we have idr 2 h h 1 idr 2 which is invertible as long as 6 1 moreover it restricts to an isomorphism of z 2 if and only if 0 or 2 therefore t r r consists of the union of the coordinate axis and of the graph of x 7 2 x s figure 1 we can now answer the following question about transverse actions completely q if t what are the transverse actions inf on k c o n non commutative t duality 23 figure 1 t r r a if 0 t then every action inf is transverse if 6 0 t and r is some lift of then every action inf is transverse which has a mackey obstruction ma 0 2 n n z let us compute the dual system of k c o z 2 inf for a transverse action with ma i in the simple case of 0 we can choose 0 as a transverse lift to then we have k c t o inf r 2 k c o z 2 on which r 2 acts by id inf and is the restriction of to z 2 ii in case of 6 0 there are two subcases first if 0 then let be any lift of and we have k c o z 2 o inf r 2 k c t 2 on which r 2 acts by inf with ma second if 6 0 then transversality means that there is a lift of such that 2 we now only need to compute the cocycles occurring in corollary 3 8 h 1 x y exp 2 i x 1 y 2 1 exp 2 i 2 x 1 y 2 exp 2 i 2 x 2 y 1 1 so h 1 and similarly h 1 pushing these classes forward along idr 2 doesn t change the class so if we denote by t the restricted class of and if is an action with mackey obstruction then the dual is given by k c o z 2 inf 24 24 echterhoff and schneider note that we re obtain example 3 13 at this stage in fact for 2 3 and 3 the dual system of k c o z 2 inf is according to 24 k c t 2 2 3 inf then we might take the bidual according to i which is k c o 2 3 z 2 id inf however 1 3 2 3 mod z and this is exactly what we observed in example 3 13 3 5 duality for 3 dimensional nc tori we consider now the standard lattice zn rn recall from bk 73 that for every 2 cocycle on rn there is a unique strictly upper triangular real n n matrix a such that is cohomologous to a rn rn t given by a x y e 2 i ax y moreover every 2 cocycle on zn is cohomologous to the restriction of some a to z n zn rn rn and two such restrictions lie in the same class in h 2 zn t if and only if the difference a a has integer entries if we identify rn with r n via x 7 x with x y e 2 i x y then a straight forward computation shows that h a r n rn is given by matrix multiplication with the skew symmetric matrix a at now given another strictly upper triangular matrix b defining a 2 cocycle b on r n rn then the pair a b is transverse if and only if the matrix in b bt a at lies in gl n z as a consequence given an action inf of r n rn on k c o zn such that ma b then the system k co zn r n inf is transversal if and only if there exists a strictly upper triangular matrix a such that a zn zn and such that in b bt a at gl n z of course this will always be the case if b 0 which results to give mathai rosenberg duality between commutative and noncommutative tori for the case n 2 we completely solved this question in the previous example in particular we saw that every non commutative 2 torus has non commutative duals we shall now show that this is not always the case in higher dimensions for this we have a look at the case n 3 suppose that a 0 a 1 a 20 0 a 3 0 0 0 and b 0 b 1 b 20 0 b 3 0 0 0 then a short computation shows that i 3 b bt a at 1 b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 1 a 3 b 3 a 2 1 b 1 a 1 b 3 a 3 b 1 a 2 b 3 a 1 b 2 a 1 1 b 2 a 2 b 3 a 3 a lengthy but straightforward computation gives 25 det 1 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 2 c 1 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 2 c 3 c 21 c 2 2 c 2 3 with ci aibi i 1 2 3 in order that gl 3 z we need det 1 since all entries of the matrix need to be integers it follows that all mixed terms cicj with i 6 j are integers as well also all sums ci cj with i 6 j need to be non commutative t duality 25 integers using this it easily follows that 2 ci z for all i 1 2 3 e g we get 2 c 1 c 1 c 2 c 1 c 3 c 2 c 3 z but then it follows that c 21 c 22 c 23 z it is an easy exercise to check that the sum of three squares of half integers is an integer if and only if all three numbers are integers themselves thus we get c 1 c 2 c 3 z and we need to search for integer solutions c 1 c 2 c 3 for the equation det 1 using standard forms for quadratic equations one can check that there are precisely the following two sets of solutions c 3 c 1 c 2 or c 3 2 c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 z in which cases the determinant will be 1 moreover the matrix will have integer entries if and only if nij aibj z for all 1 i j 3 if b 0 the conditions will always be fulfilled on the other hand if just one entry bi 6 0 this will force any of the pairs aj ak to be rationally dependent since if both aj ak 6 0 then the equations 0 6 ajbi nji and 0 6 kbi nki implies that aj nji nki ak thus a general non commutative 3 torus which admits a non commutative dual will be attached to a matrix of the form a 0 1 20 0 3 0 0 0 with 0 6 r and 1 2 3 q then b 1 0 1 20 0 3 0 0 0 with 1 2 3 q such that i j z for all 1 i j 3 and 1 1 2 2 3 3 0 2 will match up with a to give a dual pair of non commutative three dimensional tori as an example if all i 1 then 1 2 3 n k n k as well as 1 2 3 n k 2 n k with n k z will give compatible parameters for b 3 6 example tensor products of duality pairs duality pairs are closed under taking tensor products suppose that a b is a duality pair for z n rn and c d is a duality pair for z m rm then a c b d is a duality pair for zn m rn m where a c is the cocycle on rn m given by the product a c x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 a x 1 x 2 c y 1 y 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 rn m and similarly for b d note that a c diag a c if we denote by diag a c the matrix a 0 0 b mn m r since in m diag b d diag b d t diag a c diag a c t diag in b bt a at im d dt c ct it follows that a c b d is a dual pair if and only if a b and c d are both dual pairs 4 non commutative c dynamical t duality in classical commutative c dynamical t duality the objects are principal torus bundles e b equipped with a locally trivial bundle of compact opera tors f e that is trivialisable over the fibres eb b the c algebra of sections 26 echterhoff and schneider vanishing at infinity a 0 e f is a bundle of c algebras whose fibres are sta ble commutative tori k c tn we consider more general bundles whoses fibres are twisted group algebras in this section the word space will always mean a second countable locally compact hausdorff space 4 1 c 0 b algebras and continuous bundles of c algebras recall that a c algebra a is called a c 0 b algebra for a space b if a is equipped with a fixed non degenerate homomorphism c 0 b zm a the center of the multiplier algebra m a of a if a is a c 0 b algebra then for any closed subset x b we let ix denote the closed ideal c 0 b x a of a and the quotient a x a ix is called the restriction of a to x for a single point b x a b is called the fibre of a over b the elements of a can be viewed as sections of a fibre bundle over b with fibres a b by writing a b a ib a b for a a and b b a c 0 b algebra a is called a continuous bundle of c algebras over b if these sections are continuous in the sense that b 7 a b is continuous we refer to w 07 appendix c for a detailed treatment of c 0 b algebras an action g aut a on a c 0 b algebra a is called fibre preserving if it is c 0 b linear i e if g f a f g a for all a a g g and f c 0 b where we write f a for f a if is c 0 b linear it induces actions b on each fibre a b by setting b g a b g a b then is completely determined by the actions on the fibres if a 1 and a 2 are two c 0 b algebras then we say that an a 1 a 2 equivalence bimodule e is c 0 b linear if f f for all f c 0 b e where the left and right actions of c 0 b on e are given via extending the left and right actions of a 1 and a 2 to their multiplier algebras we then say that a 1 and a 2 are c 0 b linearly morita equivalent we will typically deal with a situation in which the morita equivalences are assumed to be both g equivariant and c 0 b linear 4 2 families of twisted group algebras and triviality let b be a lo cally compact space and consider a c 0 b linear action on k c 0 b i e a con tinuous homomorphism g c b pu h where c b pu h is equipped with the compact open topology this is the c 0 b linear automorphism group of k c 0 b with the topology of point wise convergence we can construct such a homomorphism literally by formula 2 from a cocycle z 2 g c b u 1 by the left regular representation i e one just has to apply 2 point wise for b z 2 g u 1 the evaluation of at b b the resulting function indeed is continuous as a map g c b pu h horr 86 proof of prop 3 1 this gives rise to a map b g h 2 g c b u 1 eg b 26 where eg b denotes the morita equivalence classes of systems k c 0 b g it is shown in ckrw 93 that eg b is a group by forming the balanced tensor product over b and the above map is a homomorphism for the one point space b pt proposition 2 5 tells that the above map is an an isomorphism namely the inverse of the mackey obstruction yet for general b this fails non commutative t duality 27 proposition 4 1 ckrw 93 sec 6 3 if the second c ech cohomology h 2 b z is countable then there is an exact sequence 0 h 2 g c b u 1 b g eg b hom g h 2 b z in the remainder of this article we will exclusively deal with actions on k c 0 b which are in the image of b g instead of analysing the crossed product k c 0 b o g we will therefore mostly consider twisted transformation group algebras defined as follows if z 2 g c b u 1 then the banach space l 1 g c 0 b is turned into a banach algebra by the same formulas as in 3 its enveloping c algebra is denoted by c 0 b o g it has a canonical action of the dual group g by point wise multiplication of char acters furthermore it is a c algebra over b and its fibres are c 0 b o g b c o b g where again b denotes the restriction of to b b we refer to ew 02 for a more detailed discussion of twisted transformation group algebras if now g c b pu is a given action in the image of b g then there is a g equivariant and c 0 b linear isomorphism k c 0 b o g k c 0 b o g given literally by formula 4 in other words we can go back and forth between families of twisted group algebras and their corresponding crossed product algebras without losing information we are now coming back to our general situation in which n g is a cocompact discrete subgroup of the abelian group g definition 4 2 let b be a space and let a be a separable and stable c 0 b algebra 1 a is called trivial if there exists z 2 g c b u 1 together with a c 0 b linear morita equivalence a c 0 b o n the pair of such a cocycle together with such a morita equivalence is called an trivialisation 2 a is called locally trivial if there exists an open covering ui i i of b such that for all i i the restricted algebras a ui over the closure u i ui are trivial 3 the open sets together with their trivialisations are called charts and a collection of charts covering all of b is called an atlas we use the term local triviality if we consider the groups n g instead of n g note that although the morita equivalence in this definition only refers to the cocycle on n we require the cocycle to extend to g example 4 3 let g r 2 n z 2 let b 0 1 be the interval and s 1 b 0 1 be the circle 1 let 1 z 2 r 2 c b u 1 be given by the class function 6 t 7 1 t r h 2 r 2 u 1 which is defined by figure 2 6 i e 1 t x y exp 2 i 1 t x 2 y 1 28 echterhoff and schneider figure 2 a function for defining a bundle of algebras let x c b o 1 z 2 which is a globally trivial non stable algebra over b note that 1 0 z 2 z 2 1 1 z 2 z 2 so the fibres x 0 and x 1 over the two endpoints of b are canonically isomorphic they are equal after identifying x t c o t z 2 by the obvious map let us denote by a 1 the algebra which is obtained by gluing along this isomorphism i e the pullback in a 1 x i 0 i 1 x 0 id can x 0 x 1 and denote by a 1 its stabilisation k a 1 if we let z 2 n c s 1 u 1 be the cocycle given point wise by 1 n n then a 1 is canonically iso morphic to k c s 1 o z 2 this is not an trivial algebra any more yet it is still a locally trivial algebra over the circle s 1 2 let us do a slightly more involved construction with the cocycle 2 z 2 r 2 c b u 1 whose class function is given by figure 3 let y c b o 2 z 2 in this case the fibres y 0 y 1 over the two endpoints of b are two non isomorphic but morita equivalent non commutative tori with classes 0 and 1 2 so there is a stable isomorphism k y 0 k y 1 we use this isomorphism to glue the stabilisation k y over the endpoints to itself let a 2 be the pullback in a 2 k y i 0 i 1 k y 0 id k y 0 k y 1 non commutative t duality 29 figure 3 another function for defining a bundle of algebras we claim that a 2 is a locally trivial algebra over the circle s 1 it is clear that y itself gives a chart for say v 1 8 7 8 s 1 the critical issue is to find a local trivialisation around the gluing point for say u 0 1 4 t 3 4 1 0 1 s 1 we have a 2 u f g k y 0 1 4 k y 3 4 1 f 0 g 1 but the isomorphism extends to a fibre wise isomorphism k y 0 1 4 k y 3 4 1 just because all fibres are the same so we obtain a 2 u f g k y 3 4 1 k y 3 4 1 f 1 g 1 c u o 1 2 z 2 and this means that v u give an atlas for a 2 4 3 duality for polarisable pairs recall that for a fibre preserving action g aut a i e a c 0 b linear action the crossed product c algebra ao g is again a c 0 b algebra definition 4 4 let b be a space 1 an action g aut a on a locally trivial c 0 b algebra a is called locally transverse if there exists an atlas ui i i i for a and cocycles i z 2 g c u i u 1 which are point wise transverse to i together with g equivariant and c 0 u i linear morita equivalences ao g ui c 0 u i o i i n g 30 echterhoff and schneider the g equivariance is required for the dual actions on both sides these local data ui i i and the morita equivalences are called transverse charts which altogether constitute a transverse atlas 2 a nc pair a over b is a locally trivial c 0 b algebra a together with a locally transverse action 3 we use the term nc dual pair for a locally trivial algebra with a locally transverse g action remark 4 5 local transversality of an action can be rephrased in terms of the local actions ui on a ui k c 0 u i o i n it is equivalent to require firstly that ui factorises as i inf and secondly that the element in eg u i given by i u i c g pu h is in the image of h 2 g c u i u 1 eg u i such that its pre image in h 2 g c u i u 1 is point wise transverse to i if a is a nc pair then the crossed product ao g is a c 0 b algebra and its fibres can be computed point wise according to section 3 2 which shows that the dual action of g on a o g is transverse in each fibre however the crossed product algebra ao g need not to be locally trivial and even if it is then the point wise computation of section 3 2 determines the dual action only up to morita equivalence in each fibre which is in general not enough to determine a unique action with these properties so we cannot simply conclude that the dual action is locally transverse definition 4 6 let b be a space 1 a local polarisation over u b is just a continuous family of group auto morphims u aut g g where aut g g is equipped with the bracconier topology this is the topology generated by the compact open topology and the pre images of the open sets by inversion in aut g g by the exponetial law b 64 this means that is continuos if and only if u g g u g g u g 7 u u g is a homoeomorphism 2 let a be a nc pair and let ui i i i i be a transverse atlas the atlas is called polarisable if there exist local polarisations i over ui such that i i i h 2 g g c u i u 1 3 a nc pair a is called polarisable if it permits a polarisable atlas polarisability is a slight restriction on the class of objects we consider in fact if an atlas is polarisable then it follows that the involved cocycles i i are coho mologous to bihomomorphisms just because i i i 0 g 0 g i 0 g 0 g 27 and the latter cocycle is a bihomomorphism g g c u i u 1 this means that the bundle theory does not cover all the cases of the point wise theory in the previous sections however for g rn and n zn all cocycles are cohomologous to bicharacters and as we see next polarisability is no restriction at all non commutative t duality 31 proposition 4 7 for g rn n zn every nc pair is polarisable proof let ui i i be a chart the first thing to note is that for r 2 n we always have an isomorphism 7 ew 01 sec 5 h 2 r 2 n c u i u 1 c u i h 2 r 2 n u 1 which is given by point wise evaluation secondly the braconnier topology coin cides with the usual topology on aut rn rn gl 2 n r now if is a type i and totally skew cocycle on r 2 n then h r 2 n r 2 n is an invertible anti symmetric matrix but if as 2 n r denotes the set of all anti symmetric 2 n 2 n matrices then c gl 2 n r gl 2 n r as 2 n r 7 h h 0 1 1 0 is surjective and admits local sections here the dual map coincides with the transpose map t in fact surjectivity is a standard fact about anti symmetric matrices to conclude the existence of local sections it is sufficient to observe that c is a submersion i e we claim that its derivative dc mat 2 n r as 2 n r m 7 m h h m is surjective for all gl 2 n r but this is immediate for any x as 2 n r we can choose a y mat 2 n r such that x y y then my 1 h 1 y satisfies dc my y h 1 h y y 1 y x so after passing to a possibly finer covering again called ui we find lifts in gl 2 n r u i h i i i 55 gl 2 n r as 2 n r and so h i i h i h i i which means that i i i if a is a c dynamical system over b i e a is a c 0 b algebra and is fibre preserving and a is a c dynamical system over b then a morphism f m a a consists of a continous function f b b together with a morita equivalence amf a over b if f m a a and f m a a are two morphisms then the composition is f f m f a f m which is only associative up to isomorphism so define a 2 morphism between two morphisms g l and g l to be an isomorphism l l over b and we have just defined the 2 category of c dynamical systems over spaces apparently nc pairs and polarisable nc pairs form 2 subcategories 7 z 2 g u 1 has the topology of almost everywhere point wise convergence and h 2 g u 1 has the corresponding quotient topology then h 2 rn u 1 rn n 1 2 as topological groups 32 echterhoff and schneider theorem 4 8 the duality functor og defined on all c dynamical systems over spaces with group g restricts to a duality of polarisable nc pairs c dynamical systems over spaces with group g c dynamical systems over spaces with group g nc pairs nc dual pairs polarisable nc pairs polarisable nc dual pairs moreover if a is a polarisable nc pair with polarisable atlas ui i i then ui io i io i defined point wise as in definition 3 5 is a polarisable atlas for the dual proof let a be a polarisable nc pair we have to show first that a o g is locally trivial and that the dual g action on it is locally transverse in the sense of definition 4 4 1 the proof is organised in 8 steps step 0 fix a polarisable atlas ui i i with polarisations i i e i i i step 1 we have an isomorphism c 0 ui o i i g g c 0 ui o g g f 7 ci f 1 i where ci g g c u i u 1 relates i i i note it is not difficult to show that i is measure preserving if it weren t there would occur a positive factor in this isomorphism to rescale the haar measure the dual action of g g is transformed into the dual action pre composed with 1 i step 2 we have to make a version of the takai duality isomorphism explicit t c 0 ui o g g k l 2 g c 0 ui which is given for f l 1 g g c 0 u i by f g f g g dg c 0 u i where f is the integral kernel for tf i e for l 2 g and u u i we have tf u g f u d in fact it is a lengthy but straight forward calculation that t defines a homomor phism which is injective because t is composed by injective transformations such as the fourier transformation the image of l 1 g g c 0 u i is dense in c 0 ui k l 2 g and thus t is an isomorphism non commutative t duality 33 step 3 the dual action of g g on c 0 u i o g g transforms under t into 8 i g t g t 1 ad g r idc 0 ui 28 where r g u l 2 g is the right regular representation i is morita equivalent to the action i idk l 2 g on k l 2 g c 0 u i k l 2 g and this action is exterior equivalent to id k l 2 g i with i g idc 0 ui ad l g where l g u l 2 g is the left regular representation the cocycle which implements the exterior equivalence is given by v g g r idc 0 ui 1 l g 1 the important thing to notice here is that i is in the image of ui g g from 26 it is the image of 1 z 2 g g c u i u 1 which reads explicitly g 1 h h 1 as a consequence a crossed product with the action i or i precomposed with 1 i is morita equivalent to a twisted group algebra with cocycle i 1 step 4 note that for the heisenberg cocycle on g g we have h g h g h which means that h is the map g 7 g and so h g h g g h this relation holds in z 2 g g u 1 but also in z 2 g g c u i u 1 where we consider the above cocycles as constant in the fibres we can use this intermediate step to compute the cocycle of i from above i 1 i h 1 i h i i 1 i h i i 1 h i i 1 h i i i i 1 so apart from an interchange of g and g this is exactly the formula we analysed in lemma 3 6 step 5 by the continuity and openness of i the equality i u h i u h i i u h i u idg id g h i u 8 we denote multiplication operators on l 2 by the same symbol as their defining functions e g g 0 7 g 0 for l 2 g 34 echterhoff and schneider shows that u g 7 u h i u g is continuous and open so i u i aut g u 7 g 7 g h i u h i u g is continuous for the bracconier topology on aut g we already remarked in 27 that the involved cocycles are all bihomomorphisms so as explained in remark 3 7 we have i 1 io i io i i idg 1 this relation holds in z 2 g g c u i u 1 i e this is a local statement rather than just a point wise statement step 6 we can now locally compute the dual ao g ui c 0 u i o i i n g c 0 u i o i i g g odual n 0 c 0 u i o i g g odual n 0 c 0 u i o g g odual 1 i n 0 k l 2 g c 0 u i o i 1 i n 0 c 0 u i o i 1 n 0 c 0 u i o io i n 0 c 0 u i o io i n 0 where the last isomorphism is pullback by i this implies the local triviality of ao g and shows that o i gives an atlas step 7 using these morita equivalences we can similarly compute the dual action of g on ao g ui note that all equivalences are g equivariant ao g ui odual g c 0 u i o i i n g odual g c 0 u i o i i g g odual n g c 0 u i o i 1 n g c 0 u i o io i i idg 1 io i n g c 0 u i o io i 1 io i n g c 0 u i o io i io i n g where the last step is pullback along the inversion in n together with the iso morphism induced by the cochain that relates i o i i o i this again requires the computation of remark 3 7 as i o i and io i are point wise transverse this completes the proof by lemma 3 18 we can associate to a given nc pair a an obstruction function b h 2 n u 1 29 non commutative t duality 35 which at each point of b has the mackey obstruction of the local and restricted n action as its value this function is continuous in fact it is locally continuous as it is given by point wise evaluation 9 z 2 n c u i u 1 c u i z 2 n u 1 c u i h 2 n u 1 similarly to a nc dual pair we associate an obstruction function b h 2 n u 1 30 using these functions we can talk about the commutative subtheory inside polar isable nc pairs definition 4 9 a polarisable nc pair a is called point wise commutative if the obstruction function defined by its dual ao g vanishes if we restrict to the groups g rn n zn the next proposition shows that this notion of commutativity reproduces the familiar objects from classical t duality proposition 4 10 let g rn n zn and let a be a polarisable nc pair then a is point wise commutative if and only if there is a locally trivial principal g n bundle e b and a locally trivial bundle of compact operators f e such that a 0 e f 31 moreover f e is trivialisable over a neighbourhood of all fibres e b b b and there is a g action on f that covers the g n action on e such that the isomorphism in 31 can be chosen to be g equivariant proof it is clear that if an isomorphism 31 exists then 0 conversely if b 0 then by lemma 3 19 b t 0 which determines the class of each fibre to be 0 so we have locally a ui c 0 u i o i n where the cocycle i z 2 g c u i u 1 is such that its restrictions i i n z 2 n c u i u 1 c u i z 2 n u 1 are point wise in the image of the boundary operator d c 1 n u 1 c 2 n u 1 i b b 2 n u 1 the kernel of d is hom n u 1 g n tn which is a lie group so just as in the proof of ro 86 theorem 2 1 we apply the palais cross section theorem pa 61 4 1 which implies that d c 1 n u 1 b 2 n u 1 is a locally trivial g n bundle then after passing to a possibly finer covering of b which we again call ui we have lifts i in c 1 n u 1 d u i i i 99 b 2 n u 1 9 here evaluation is an isomorphism because n is discrete so the topology of almost everywhere point wise convergence on z 2 n u 1 coincides with the compact open topology for which we can apply the exponential law for locally compact hausdorff spaces x y z c x y z c x c y z 36 echterhoff and schneider which implies the existence of local g equivariant isomorphisms a ui k c 0 u i od i n k c 0 u i o 1 n c 0 ui g n k now consider the transition on the overlap uij ui uj of two charts c 0 u j g n k c 0 u i g n k c 0 u ji g n k ij c 0 u ij g n k it is g equivariant and it induces a g equivariant automorphism on the spectrum ji u ij g n u ji g n by equivariance ji is of the form ji u z u gji u z for some gji u ij g n clearly the gji define a c ech cocycle and thus a principal g n bundle e b precomposition of ij with 1 ji yields then a spectrum fixing automorphism of c 0 u ij g n k i e a function ji u ij g n pu such that ij f u z 1 ji u z f u gji u z for f c 0 u ji g n k c 0 u j g n k the ij satisfy the twisted c ech identity kj u gji u z ji u z ki u z and hence define a bundle of compact operators f e it is then clear from the construction that f is trivialisable over a neighbourhood of each fibre e b e and f carries a g action which covers the principal g n action on e for any a a the quotient maps a c 0 u i g n k define a compatible family of functions i e they define a section of f e hence we get a g equivariant map a e f because this map is c 0 b linear one can use a partition of unity on b as an approximate identity on c 0 b to show that this map takes values in the sections vanishing at infinity only and that this assignment is injective and surjective a 0 e f e f 4 4 nc bundles if a is a nc pair we have seen that it is not reasonable to ask for the cohomology classes of the fibres of a rather than to handle this issue with the ambiguity which is measured by the set t as defined in 23 so if we want to deal with bundles without actions the following definition is appropriate definition 4 11 a nc bundle a is a locally trivial algebra together with a continuous function b h 2 n u 1 such that there exists an altas ui i of a which has the property that for all i we have i b n b t for all b ui a nc bundle a is called commutative if 0 the notion of commutative nc dual bundles is defined analogously these are the objects of the category of nc bundles the morphisms a a are pairs f m of a continuous function f b b such that f and non commutative t duality 37 a c 0 b linear morita equivalence amf a here we assume that a is a c 0 b algebra if a is any polarisable nc pair we can use the obstructions function b h 2 n u 1 of its dual a o g to define an assignment on objects a 7 a which extends to a functor polarisable nc pairs nc bundles that gives the underlying nc bundle of a polarisable nc pair similarly there is a functor polarisable nc dual pairs nc dual bundles that gives the underlying nc dual bundle of a polarisable nc dual pair an exten sion of a nc dual bundle a is a polarisable nc dual pair a such that a a and a nc dual bundle is called dualisable if it has an extension now if a is a dualisable nc dual bundle one might ask the question whether it has an extension that is the dual of a commutative polarisable nc pair in other words we ask whether the functor polarisable nc pairs polarisable nc dual pairs nc dual bundles and its restriction com commutative polarisable nc pairs polarisablenc pairs polarisable nc dual pairs nc dual bundles have the same essential image if the answer to this question were yes then the theory we developed wouldn t be significantly richer than the classical commutative and semi comutative theory of mathai and rosenberg because all nc bundles could be understood as crossed products of classical bundles with all their possible g actions however this is not the case proposition 4 12 let g r 2 and n z 2 then the essential images of the functors and com do not coincide proof in section 5 2 below we give an example of a nc bundle that cannot be obtained as the dual of a commutative polarisable nc pair 5 example the heisenberg bundle and its relatives in this section we always let g r 2 and n z 2 and we use the canonical identifications r 2 r 2 and z 2 z 2 we will typically denote elements in t r z or t 2 r 2 z 2 by x y z or by g if g is in r or r 2 by s 1 we denote the unit interval 0 1 with glued end points 0 1 sometimes it is convenient to have have one of the endpoints say 1 thickened to a whole non empty interval 111 1 1 i e we then consider the space s 111 0 1 t 111 where 1 1 and 0 1 which of course is homeomorphic to s 1 for t r 38 echterhoff and schneider we denote by t the 2 cocycle on r 2 given by t g h exp 2 itg 2 h 1 we will use the notation t t r for the actions r 2 aut k which are given by tg ad l t g for the left regular t representation l t g h t g h g h g l 2 r 2 the actions t have mackey obstruction t r h 2 r 2 u 1 5 1 the heisenberg bundle consider the function s 1 s 1 z 2 n u 1 given by s 1 s s n n which is well defined as n n n 1 for n z the heisenberg bundle is the c algebra over s 1 given by a 0 k c s 1 o s 1 n its fibres are the stable non commutative tori a s k co s n nn we equip it with the canonical g action 0 id inf the following proposition is immediate proposition 5 1 a 0 0 is a polarisable nc dual pair the obstruction function 0 s 1 h 2 z 2 u 1 defined by a 0 0 is just the composition of the canonical identifications s 1 t h 2 z 2 u 1 let us construct a commutative nc pair which will turn out to be the dual of the heisenberg bundle consider the trivial principal t 2 bundle e 0 s 1 t 2 s 1 its total space e 0 is a compact orientable three manifold so its 3 rd c ech cohmology is h 3 e 0 z z let f 1 e be a locally trivial k bundle representing the canonical generator of 3 rd cohomology h 3 e 0 z z f 1 7 1 let e 0 f 1 be the section c algebra of f 1 e we construct an action on this algebra which covers the principal t 2 action on e 0 prim e 0 f 1 to do so observe first that one can describe the bundle f 1 slightly different up to isomorphism any k bundle over e 0 can be obtained from a function t 2 aut k which is used to glue the two boundary parts of the trivial k bundle 0 1 t 2 k 0 1 t 2 32 to each other in particular the bundle f 1 is obtained by using a classifying map t 2 bu 1 pu h aut k of the canonical u 1 bundle over t 2 i e a function whose class in 2 nd cohomology h 2 t 2 z z corresponds to 1 let us identify such a function t 2 aut k by the following construction choose k k l 2 r 2 and define a c 0 1 linear action on the sections c 0 1 t 2 k of 32 by g f t x tg f t x g for t 1 the cocycle involved in 1 1 g h 7 exp 2 i 1 g 2 h 1 becomes trivial when restricted to n z 2 to continue we need a lemma lemma 5 2 the canonical isomorphism h 2 r 2 l r 2 z 2 u 1 h 2 z 2 u 1 of m 76 thm 6 makes the diagramm h 2 r 2 u 1 h 2 z 2 u 1 h 2 r 2 l r 2 z 2 u 1 oo non commutative t duality 39 commute where the vertical map is restriction and the diagonal map is induced by the inclusion of coefficients proof see appendix b because of this lemma there is a borel function 10 c r 2 l t 2 u 1 u l 2 t 2 such that 1 dc i e 1 g h c h z g c g h z 1 c g z 33 for almost all z t 2 note at this point that 33 implies that the restriction c z 2 z 2 l t 2 u 1 is a homomorphism i e there is a measure one set s t 2 such that n 7 c n z is in z 2 for all z s the function c determines a function c l r 2 t 2 u 1 u l 2 r 2 t 2 which for each g satisfies 1 g h c h z g c g h z 1 c g z 34 for almost all h z r 2 t 2 by choosing a borel representative of c we consider for z t 2 the unitary multiplication operator c z u l 2 r 2 which sends a funtion l 2 r 2 to h 7 c h z h these operators define a borel function z 7 0 z ad c z pu l 2 r 2 lemma 5 3 1 there exists a continuous function t 2 pu l 2 r 2 which agrees almost everywhere with 0 2 the class of in h 2 t 2 z z is the generator 1 i e is a classifying map for the canonical line bundle over t 2 3 the equality z k 1 g k g z g pu l 2 r 2 holds for all k z g r 2 z t 2 proof 1 consider the countable dense subgroup q 2 r 2 by 34 there is for each g q 2 a set sg t 2 of measure one such that 1 g c z g k c gk z 1 c gk z u l 2 r 2 holds for all z sg choose some z 0 s g q 2 sg then 1 g c z 0 g c g z 0 1 c g z 0 u l 2 r 2 holds for all g q 2 the map g 7 ad c z 0 g ad 1 g c g z 0 ad 1 g l 0 g c z 0 l 0 g is clearly continuous on q 2 as one can see in line three and clearly factors over the quotient q 2 z 2 as one can see in line one then define z 0 t 2 pu l 2 r 2 be its continuous extension which is just given by the formula in line three for all 10 we always consider l x u 1 as a subspace of u l 2 x by associating to an l function the multiplication operator that multiplies l 2 functions point wise with the given l function 40 echterhoff and schneider g r 2 and let z z 0 z 0 g by construction it s clear that satisfies 1 of the lemma 2 the c ech classes of and of z 7 z z 0 agree we compute the c ech class of the latter choose continuous local sections k vk r 2 of the quotient map r 2 t 2 such that the open domains vk t 2 cover t 2 then by line two from above k z 1 k z c k z z 0 u l 2 g are continuous unitary local lifts of z 7 z z 0 so its class in h 1 t 2 u 1 h 2 t 2 z is given by the cocycle kl z k z l z 1 1 k z c k z z 0 c l z z 0 1 1 l z 1 1 k z l z c k z z 0 c k z k z l z z 0 1 1 k z l z 1 k z l z k z c k z l z z 0 1 1 k z l z k z c k z l z z 0 1 u 1 we claim that c k z l z z 0 1 is a coboundary term in fact k z l z is in z 2 and so choose by surjectivity of r 2 z 2 an extension r 2 of the character n 7 c n z 0 which gives k z l z 1 c k z l z z 0 this indeed is a coboundary term and does not effect the class of the expressions z z 1 z 2 7 1 l z k z k z k z 2 l z 2 z 1 are transition functions for the canonical line bundle on t t s 07 sec 2 6 i e they give the class of the canonical line bundle 3 just multiply both sides of 33 by the left regular representation l k g and apply ad u l 2 g pu l 2 g to both sides part 3 of this lemma just says for k 0 that c 1 t 2 k 1 g c 1 t 2 k c 0 t 2 k 0 g c 0 t 2 k commutes where 0 1 are the actions on the fibres over t 0 1 given by the fibre wise action and f 1 z z f 0 z so by construction we have shown the following proposition non commutative t duality 41 proposition 5 4 let a 0 0 be the pullback in the category of c dynamical systems of the diagram a 0 0 c 0 1 t 2 k i 0 i 1 c 1 t 2 k 1 id c 0 t 2 k c 1 t 2 k 0 1 then there is a canonical isomorphism a 0 e 0 f 1 it is clear that a 0 0 is a polarisable nc pair with a trivial obstruction function 0 0 s 1 h 2 z u 1 so its dual is commutative proposition 5 5 a 0 0 and a 0 0 are dual to each other i e a 0 o 0 r 2 with its dual r 2 action is morita equivalent to a 0 0 proof consider the function 0 1 0 1 z 2 z 2 u 1 given by 0 1 t t z 2 z 2 then the heisenberg bundle a 0 with its induced action 0 is the pullback in a 0 0 k c 0 1 o 0 1 z 2 id inf i 0 i 1 c 1 t 2 k inf diag c 0 t 2 k c 1 t 2 k inf inf 35 in the diagram of proposition 5 4 we can take crossed product with r 2 because taking crossed products is a continuous functor this leads to another pullback diagram but this new diagram is stably isomorphic to diagram 35 remark 5 6 the duality stated in proposition 5 5 has already been observed in mr 06 section 4 however they follow a different approach which is less explicit then the one presented here and we can use the intermediate steps of our approach for the construction of the twisted heisenberg bundle which we do next 5 2 the twisted heisenberg bundle let us use the pullback description of the two nc dual pairs from above to construct a chimaera out of the two consider the algebra k c 0 1 o 0 1 z 2 where 0 1 is as in 35 this algebra carries the fibre wise action that is given in each fibre by t 2 1 t inf as t moves from 0 to 1 the mackey obstuction of 2 1 t moves from 2 to 1 for k 1 part 3 of lemma 5 3 implies that z 2 g 1 g z g i e c 1 t 2 k 1 g c 1 t 2 k c 0 t 2 k 0 g c 0 t 2 k 42 echterhoff and schneider commutes for f 1 z z 1 f 0 z so naively what we now could con sider is the pullback in a 1 1 k c 0 1 o 0 1 z 2 i 0 i 1 c 1 t 2 k 1 id c 0 t 2 k c 1 t 2 k 0 1 indeed a 1 is a bundle over s 1 with fibers a 1 s k c o s n however it fails to be trivial around 0 1 s 1 we can get around this by thickening the gluing point to the interval 111 we define the twisted heisenberg bundle a 111 together with its action 111 to be the pullback in a 111 111 k c 0 1 o 0 1 z 2 i 0 i 1 c 111 t 2 k 111 i 1 i 1 c 0 t 2 k c 1 t 2 k 0 1 where the action 111 is just 1 in each fibre proposition 5 7 the twisted heisenberg bundle a 111 111 is a polarisable nc dual pair over s 111 proof let 1 111 be the middle we consider the open cover of s 111 given by the two open sets u 0 1 t 1 1 and v 0 12 t 1 1 then a 111 u f g c 0 1 o 0 1 z 2 c 1 1 t f 1 g 1 c u o u z 2 where we let u s 1 s for s 0 1 and u s 2 for s 1 1 if we let u s 21 s for s 0 1 and u s 1 for s 1 1 then u and u are point wise transverse cp section 3 4 moreover by construction of the action 111 we have a 111 o 111 r 2 u k c u o u u z 2 r 2 we have shown that u is a chart for a 111 111 to show that v is a chart we need one more step in between in fact we use that we can extend the isomorphism fibre wise to an isomorphism c 111 t 2 k c 000 t 2 k 36 where 000 0 0 111 1 is just the intervall 111 shifted by 1 this isomorphims turns the action 111 into 000 which in each fibre s 000 just is 000 s 0 then non commutative t duality 43 we find a 111 v f g k c 0 1 2 o 0 1 z 2 c 111 t k f 0 g 1 f g 7 f g f h k c 0 1 2 o 0 1 z 2 c 000 t k f 0 h 0 k c v o v z 2 wherein v s 1 s for s 0 1 2 and v s 1 for s 111 we have 111 v v z 2 z 2 and we let v s 21 s for s 0 1 2 and v s 2 for s 111 by construction v and v are point wise transverse and by construction of the action 111 we have a 111 o 111 r 2 v k c v o v v z 2 r 2 remark 5 8 1 the possibility of finding the extension 36 is the crucial step in proving the local triviality of a 111 this extension exists on a bundle of commutative tori but could not have been found if we had not thickened 1 to 111 2 the essential point for point wise transversality is that the point wise co cycles 0 1 s z 2 z 2 u 1 have extensions 1 s r 2 r 2 u 1 whose cohomology classes vary in the interval 1 2 which together with 2 1 is the only interval of integer length which is preserved by the map s 7 2 s the relevance of the second interval 2 1 becomes clear below it is the interval from which the pre dual of a 111 111 takes its mackey obstructions let us identify the pre dual of the twisted heisenberg bundle knowing its local structure from the proof of proposition 5 7 and knowing the calculation in section 3 4 it is rather clear how the pre dual looks like let a 111 111 to be the pullback in a 111 111 k c 0 1 o 0 1 z 2 i 0 i 1 c 111 t 2 k 111 i 1 i 1 c 0 t 2 k c 1 t 2 k 0 1 where the action is point wise given by t 1 t inf t 0 1 the action 111 is just 1 in each fibre and the cocycle 0 1 is defined by 0 1 t 2 1 t n n 44 echterhoff and schneider t 0 1 and n z 2 then one can prove that a 111 1 is a polarisable nc pair over s 111 just along the lines of proposition 5 7 moreover the computation of its dual is a point wise repetition of section 3 4 proposition 5 9 the nc pair a 111 1 is dual to a 111 1 let a 111 1 a 111 1 be the underlying nc bundle of the twisted heisenberg bundle as explained in section 4 4 note that 1 s 111 h 2 z 2 u 1 t has winding number 1 and this is the key to proof what we have claimed in proposition 4 12 let us denote by fn e a locally trivial k bundle on e s 111 t 2 such that fn h 3 e z z corresponds to n z then up to isomorphism all commutative nc pairs over s 111 are given by e fn with suitable r 2 actions proposition 5 10 a 111 1 is not in the essential image of com proof the proof makes use of the k theory bundle introduced in eno 09 this is the group bundle over s 111 whose fibres are given by the k theory of the fibres according to eno 09 sec 5 the k 0 bundle of the heisenberg bundle a 0 is the z 2 bundle over s 111 which is given by gluing the trivial z 2 bundle over the interval with the matrix m 1 1 0 1 the heisenberg bundle is a crossed product of e f 1 by a fibre preserving r 2 action so by connes thom isomorphism their fibres have the same k theory and thus the k theory bundles are the same see eno 09 theorem 3 5 and remark 4 4 this implies that induces the above map m in k theory the twisted heisenberg bundle then has a trivial k 0 bundle because it has the additional gluing with rather than with the bundle a 111 which is obtained from the heisenberg bundle with twist has k 0 bundle glued by m 2 therefore if e fn is a crossed product of the twisted heisenberg bundle it also must have a trivial k theory bundle but as fn is obtained by gluing with n the k 0 bundle of e fn is given by gluing the trivial z 2 bundle with mn which is trivial if and only if n 0 now consider e f 0 k c e with any transverse r 2 action by s crossed product k c e o r 2 is equivariantly morita equiv alent to k c s 1 0 o z 2 z 2 with the r 2 action that is inflated from the dual action of t 2 see the discussion in section 3 1 however k c s 111 o z 2 with the dual t 2 action is a ncp torus bundle in the sense of eno 09 which has a trivial k theory bundle then eno 09 theorem 7 2 implies that the mackey obstruction function s 111 h 2 z 2 u 1 t of z 2 aut k c s 111 0 is null homotopic since every null homotopic map s 111 t h 2 z 2 u 1 can be lifted to a continuous map s 111 r h 2 r 2 u 1 this implies that there exists an action r 2 aut k c s 111 0 such that z 2 is morita equivalent to z 2 but this implies see section 3 1 that is morita equivalent to the r 2 action inf on k c s 111 c t 2 this means we have a global chart and so the mackey obstruction function of z 2 coincides with the obstruction function 1 de fined by the polarisable nc pair k c e which has winding number 1 this is a contradiction non commutative t duality 45 appendix a example 3 13 let g r 2 and n z 2 and choose 1 3 2 3 r z t h 2 n u 1 denote by 3 an action of g r 2 on k with mackey obstruction 3 r h 2 r 2 u 1 then there is a g equivariant morita equivalence k c o 2 3 n 3 inf k c o 1 3 n id inf proof step 1 the symmetry groups s n of the two classes 1 3 2 3 agree i e the maps h 1 3 h 2 3 n n have the same kernel s 3 z 2 the annihilator of s in g r 2 is s 1 3 z 2 and the annihilator of s in n is s n 1 3 z z 2 we are in the following situation n s g g s n s s n s n n n s n s the quotient map n z 2 z 3 z 2 n s induces a map in cohomology and let us denote by 1 3 also the pre image of 1 3 in 1 3 1 3 z z inclusion h 2 n s u 1 induced map 1 3 t h 2 n u 1 the action of g on s prim co 1 3 n prim co 2 3 n has stabiliser s which acts via the quotient s s n n s and the dual actions on co 13 n s and co 23 n s on these two algebras let us denote these actions by and respectively then there are g equivariant isomorphisms k c o 2 3 n 3 inf k indg s c o 2 3 n s 3 ind indg s k c o 2 3 n s 3 s ind 3 s and k c o 1 3 n id inf k indg s c o 1 3 n s id ind indg s k c o 1 3 n s id ind id 46 echterhoff and schneider step 2 the product in c o 1 3 n s is given by f f n m n s f m f n m exp 2 i 1 3 m 2 n 1 m 1 it is a straight forward computation to see that the mapping which assigns to a function f n s c the matrix f with entries f a b c 0 1 2 f c b a exp 2 i 1 3 ca a b 0 1 2 defines an isomorphism co 1 3 n s m 3 c k l 2 z 3 z the action trans forms under this isomorphism to a conjugation action s aut k l 2 z 3 z i e s ad v s where the unitary v s u l 2 z 3 z is given by v s a exp 2 i 1 3 c a d 1 a d for s 1 3 c 1 3 d s 1 3 z 2 l 2 z 3 z one can then start calculating v s s v s v s s 1 v s exp 2 i 1 3 dc exp 2 i 2 3 dc 1 so after identifying 1 3 z 2 13 z 2 s we find the mackey obstruction of satisfying h 2 s u 1 1 3 h 2 z 2 u 1 t ma 2 3 step 3 the mackey obstruction of 3 s is given by the cocycle s s exp 2 i 3 s 2 s 1 exp 2 i 1 3 dc for s s 1 s 2 1 3 c 1 3 d s s 1 s 2 1 3 c 1 3 d s so here we find h 2 s u 1 1 3 h 2 z 2 u 1 t ma s 1 3 step 4 a similar isomorphism as found in step 2 can be used to identify co 2 3 n s also with k l 2 z 3 z in fact the product in co 2 3 n s agrees with the product non commutative t duality 47 in c o 2 3 n s up to a sign f f n m n s f m f n m exp 2 i 2 3 m 2 n 1 m 1 m n s f m f n m exp 2 i 1 3 m 2 n 1 m 1 1 following this sign in the construction made in step 2 one finally finds that the mackey obstruction of is exactly the inverse of h 2 s u 1 1 3 h 2 z 2 u 1 t ma 1 3 step 5 summing up all the mackey obstructions we see that the two c dynamical systems k c o 2 3 n s s 3 s and k c o 1 3 n s s id are equivalent this implies that also their induced systems are equivalent which proves the claim appendix b lemma 5 2 the canonical isomorphism h 2 g l g n u 1 h 2 n u 1 of m 76 thm 6 makes the diagram h 2 g u 1 h 2 n u 1 h 2 g l g n u 1 oo 37 commute where the vertical map is restriction and the diagonal map is induced by the inclusion of coefficients proof let us introduce some notation used in m 76 let i x n x for any x it has the structure of an n module by left translation n f f n i n let us denote by a the quotient of i u 1 by the constants u 1 i e we have an n equivariant short exact sequence 1 u 1 i u 1 a 1 38 where u 1 has the trivial n structure and a has the quotient structure we obtain an n equivariant embedding i a i a by ia n n a for a a n n the quotient of i a by i a is denoted by u a i e we have another n equivariant sequence 1 a i a u a 1 by definition cp the axioms of group cohomology as a derived functor m 76 sec 4 we have an exact sequence 1 an i a n u a n h 1 n a 0 48 echterhoff and schneider where the exponent denotes taking invariants let ign y denote the induced g module for any y module i e equivalence classes of functions f g y such that for all n n f g n n f g holds for almost all g g two functions are identified if they agree almost everywhere ign y is a g module by left translation note that ign u 1 l g n u 1 as g modules the functor ign from n modules to g modules is exact m 76 proposition 19 and again by the axioms and m 76 proposition 18 we have an exact sequence 1 ign a g ign i a g ign u a g h 1 g ign a 0 the canonical isomorphism h 2 n u 1 h 2 g ign u 1 is defined by the di agram 1 1 an ign a g i a n ign i a g u a n ign u a g h 2 n u 1 h 1 n a oo h 1 g ign a h 2 g ign u 1 0 0 here the top three isomorphisms are given by sending an invariant element to the constant function g 7 cp m 76 proposition 19 the dotted isomorphism is induced by the one above and the two isomorphisms to the left and right are the connecting morphisms in the long exact sequence induced by 38 let us describe the dotted arrow to do so start with some element x h 1 n a and choose some u a n which maps to x following the isomorphism to the right we get ign u a g ign u a let us denote by i g n i a an element that maps to then the image y of x under the dotted arrow is the class of dg g ign a defined by g 3 g g 1 ign i a i g n a let us now describe the element x in terms of we consider for each n n a co null set sn g such that g n n g holds for all g sn then let s 1 n n sn so g n n g holds for all n n and all g s 1 moreover there is another co null set s 2 g such that g mod a for all g s 2 let s s 1 s 2 then s i a is a lift of u a n and x is represented by the class of dn s n a defined by n 37 n s s 1 s n s 1 i a a non commutative t duality 49 note that that the operation restriction to n and evaluation at s transforms dg into dn s dg n s dn s n let a i u 1 be a borel section of the quotient map then the element n s in h 2 n a corresponding to x dn s is given by n s n m dn s m dn s n m 1 dn s n the element g in h 2 g ign u 1 corrsponding to y dg is given by g g h dg h g dg g h 1 dg g where i g n a i g n i u 1 is just composition with note again that that the operation restriction to n and evaluation at s transforms g into n s g n m s n s n m now let us turn to the commutativity of 37 let h 2 g u 1 and consider its image y also given by in h 2 g ign u 1 we can represent y as above by finding some such that for all g h g h dgc g h g g h holds in ign u 1 for some cochain c g i g n u 1 so there is another co null set s 3 such that n m dc n m s g n m s holds for all n m n and all s s 3 if we choose s 0 s 1 s 2 s 3 then by the above construction we have that the image of along the composition in diagram 37 is given by the cocycle n s 0 n m g n m s 0 n m c m s 0 c n m s 0 1 c n s 0 it follows that n s 0 n n by the cochain n 7 c n s 0 this proves the lemma references a 46 arens r topologies for homeomorphism groups am j of mathematics 68 no 4 1946 593 610 bk 73 baggett l kleppner
