introduction let g be a compact lie group h dr g q the rational de rham cohomology it is classical that the chern character ch k g q h dr g q is an isomorphism see 16 there have also been other chern characters from k theory to such co homologies as hochschild and cyclic co homologies etc and the theories have played important role in geometry index theory etc more recently some of the theories e g cyclic cohomology have been quantized as the so called non commutative geome try since then there has been more need to define non commutative version of chern characters that would play in quantum theories similar roles to the ordinary commutative chern characters in classical theories the aim of this paper is to construct such non commutative chern characters in 2 we review some preliminaries on c g for compact lie groups g and kk functors we also define the periodic cyclic homology hp a and entire cyclic homology he a for a general involutive banach algebra a we define an entire cyclic homology he a of an involutive banach algebra a via a family of ideals with ad invariant trace and via projective and inductive topologies to form non commutative analogues of de rham currents we use the dual to the entire cochain of a connes at the level of ideals with ad invariant trace when a c g where g is a compact lie group our theory coincides with the usual de rham cohomology yielding the calculation in the work of watanabe see 16 17 some of these calculations are briefly reviewed in 3 3 in 3 we define a non commutative chern character ch k a he a see 3 1 and show in 3 2 that when a c g for a compact lie group g ch is an isomorphism which can be identified with the classical chern character kw c t he w c t that is also an isomorphism where t is a maximal torus of g with weyl group w in 4 we indicate at first that the periodic cyclic homology hp a defined in 2 through ideals of a coincides with the periodic cyclic homology of cuntz quillen 6 when a c g for a compact lie group g we then go on to show in 4 5 that the chern character ch k c g hp c g is an isomorphism which can be identified with the classical chern character k c t hp c t which is also an isomorphism notes on notation for any compact lie group g we write k g for the z 2 graded topological k theory of g we use swan s theorem to identify k g with the z 2 graded k c g for any involutive banach algebraa k a he a hp a are z 2 graded algebraic k group of a entire cyclic homology of a and periodic cyclic homology of a respectively if t is a maximal torus of g with the weyl group w write c t for the ring of complex valued functions on t we write kw c t resp he w c t for the z 2 graded w equivariant k group resp entire cyclic homology of c t 3 2 preliminaries 2 1 group c algebras we introduce in this subsection the definition and the main properties of c algebras of compact lie groups we need for later use let us recall that in a compact lie group g there exists a bi invariant haar measure denoted dg consider the involutive banach algebra l 1 g of absolutely integrable complex valued functions on g with the convolution product f g x g f y g y 1 x dy involution f x f x 1 and the l 1 norm f g f x dx this algebra is not regular in the sense that in general 6 let us consider the new regular norm defined by sup g where by definition g is the dual object of g i e the set of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of g the completion of the involutive banach algebra l 1 g with respect to this norm is a regular complete involutive banach algebra with unit element which is called the group c algebra of g the following facts are well known see 13 1 the dual object g is not more than denumerable finite if the group g is finite and of cardinal n if g is compact 2 every irreducible representation of the compact lie groupg is equivalent to a unitary one unitarization and is finite dimensional of dimension ni say 3 every representation of g can be extended to a representation of c g by the fourier gel fand transform f f g x f x dx 4 there is one to one correspondence between the irreducible representations of g and the non degenerate irreducible representation of c g 5 let us fix a bijection between n g and n n then there exists a constant c cf where f is in c g such that f n cf id 0 as n 4 let us denote the restricted cartesian product of matrix algebras matni c by i 1 matni c f f n cf id 0 as n the main property of the group c algebra c g is the fact that c g i 1 matni c this means also that c g lim in and that the right hand side is dense in norm where in n i 1 matni c are two sided closed ideals in c g 2 2 kk groups we recall in this subsection a brief definition of operator k functors following g g kasparov a fredholm representation of a c algebra a is a triple 1 2 f consisting of representations 1 2 a l hb and a fredholm opera tor f f hb admitting an adjoint operator on the hilbert c module hb 2 b over c algebra b satisfying the relations 1 a f f 2 a kb where kb is the ideal of compact adjointable c module endomorphisms of hb the classes of homotopy invariance and unitary equivalence of fredholm modules form the so called kasparov operator k group kk a b herewith put a c g b c where g is a compact lie group in this case we have k c g kk c g c where k a is algebraic k group of a note that kk 0 a c k 0 a kk 1 a c k 1 a 2 3 entire homology of involutive banach algebras let a be an involutive ba nach algebra recall that a connes defines entire cyclic cohomology he a and a pairing k a he a c also m khalkhali 11 proved morita and homotopy invariance of he a we now define the entire homology he a as follows given a collection i of ideals in a equipped with a so called ada invariant trace i c satisfying the properties 1 is a continuous linear functional normalized as 1 5 2 is positive in the sense that a a 0 where the map a 7 a is the involution defining the involutive banach algebra structure i e an anti hermitian endomorphism such that a a 3 is strictly positive in the sense that a a 0 iff a 0 for every 4 is ada invariant in the sense that xa ax x a a i then we have for every a scalar product a b a b and also an inverse system i let i be the completion of i under the scalar product above and i denote i with formally adjoined unity element define the c n i the set of n 1 linear maps i n 1 c for we have a well defined map d c n i c n i which makes cn i into a direct system write q lim cn i remark that it admits a hilbert space structure see 7 8 let cn a hom lim cn i c let b b cn i c n 1 i n cn i c n i cn i c n i s cn 1 i c n i be defined as in a connes 3 we follow the notations in 11 denotes by b b n s the corresponding adjoint operators we now have a bi complex c a b b b 1 n 1 n c 1 a c 1 a c 1 a b b b 1 n 1 n c 0 a c 0 a c 0 a with b in the even columns and b in the odd columns where means the corre sponding adjoint operator now we have tot c a even tot c a odd n 0 cn a 6 which is periodic with period two hence we have n 0 cn a n 0 cn a where dv dh is the total differential let hp a be the homology of the total complex totc a remark that this hp a is in general different from the hp a of cuntz quillen definition 2 1 an even or odd chain fn n 0 in c a is called entire if the radius of convergence of the power series n n n 2 fn z n z c is infinite let ce a be the subcomplex of c a consisting of entire chains then we have a periodic complex theorem 2 2 let tot ce a even tot ce a odd n 0 cen a where cen a is the entire n chain then we have a complex of entire chains with the total differential n 0 cen a n 0 cen a the homology of this complex is called also the entire homology and denoted by he a note that this entire homology is defined through the inductive limits of ideals with ad invariance trace 3 non commutative chern characters for involutive banach algebras let a be an involutive banach algebra in this section we construct a non commutative character chc k a he a and later show that when a c g this chern character reduces up to isomorphism to classical chern character let a be an involutive banach algebra with unity theorem 3 1 there exists a chern character chc k a he a proof we first recall that there exists a pairing kn a c n a c 7 due to a connes see 4 hence there exists a map kn a cn hom cn a c so by 1 1 we have for each c a map kn a c n hom cn i c and hence a map kn a cn hom lim cn i c we now show that cn induces the chern map ch kn a hen a now let e be an idempotent in mk a for some k n it suffices to show that for n even if where cn i and c n 1 i then e n 1 1 n n e e e 0 however this follows from connes results in 4 lemma 7 the proof of the case for n odd would also follow from 4 our next result computes the chern character in 2 1 for a c g by reducing it to the classical case theorem 3 2 let t be a fixed maximal torus of g with weyl group w ng t t then the chern character chc k c g he c g is an isomorphism which can be identified with the classical chern character ch kw c t he w c t that is also an isomorphism proof first observe that we have an isomorphism k c g k i 1 matni c lim k n i 1 matni c k highest weight mod w c k w c t next we have he c g he lim n i 1 matni c lim he n i 1 matni c he highest weight mod w c he w c t where c c are enumerated by the highest weights of the corresponding irreducible representations of g because the irreducible representations of compact lie groups are defined by their characters highest weights the above product is indexed by highest weights modulo the action of the weyl group w furthermore we have from standard results in topology that k w t k w bt 8 now consider the commutative diagram k c g kw c t chc ch he c g hew c t since are isomorphisms and ch is also an isomorphism we have that chc 1 ch is also an isomorphism remark 3 3 for some classical groups e g su n 1 so 2 n 1 su 2 n sp n etc the groups k g k w c t k w t k c g he c g he w c t h w c t h w t h g hp c g are as follows a for any compact lie group g let r g be the representation ring then the z 2 graded algebra k g c 1 2 n where i are the standard irreducible representations and r g k g is the bott map hence from 16 we have k su n 1 c 1 n k so 2 n 1 c 1 n 2 n 1 b it follows from 17 that the z 2 graded complex cohomology groups are exterior algebras over c and in particular h su 2 n c x 3 x 5 x 4 n 1 h sp n c x 3 x 7 x 4 n 1 h su 2 n 1 c x 3 x 5 x 4 n 1 h so 2 n 1 c x 3 x 7 x 4 n 1 c define a function n n n z by n k k i 1 1 i 1 n k i iq 1 it then follows from 16 17 that we have chern character ch k su n 1 h su n 1 given by ch k n i 1 1 i i n 1 k i 1 x 2 i 1 k 1 ch k so 2 n 1 h so 2 n 1 given by the formula ch k n i 1 1 i 12 2 i 1 2 n 1 k 2 i x 4 i 1 k 1 2 n 1 9 ch 2 n 1 n i 1 1 i 1 2 n 1 2 i 1 n k 1 2 n 1 k 2 i x 4 i 1 4 algebraic version of non commutative chern character let g be a compact lie group hp c g the periodic cyclic homology introduced in 2 since c g lim n n i 1 matni c hp c g coincides with the hp c g defined by j cuntz d quillen 6 lemma 4 1 let in n n be the above defined collection of ideals in c g then k c g lim n n k in k w c t where t is the fixed maximal torus of g proof first note that the algebraic k theory of c algebras has the stability property k a mn c k c hence lim k ini k highest weight mod w c k w c t by pontryagin duality where c c are enumerated by the highest weights of the corresponding irreducible representations of g j cuntz and d quillen 6 defined the so called x complexes of c algebras and then used some ideas of fedosov product to define algebraic chern characters we now briefly recall their definitions for a non commutative associatec algebra a consider the space of even non commutative differential forms a ra equipped with the fedosov product 1 2 1 2 1 1 d 1 d 2 see 6 consider also the ideal ia k 1 2 k a it is easy to see that ra ia a and that ra admits the universal property that any based linear map a m can be uniquely extended to a derivationd ra m the derivations d ra m bijectively correspond to lifting homomorphisms from ra to the semi direct product ra m which also bijectively correspond to linear map a a c m given by a a 7 d a from the universal property of 1 ra we obtain a bimodule isomorphism ra a ra 1 ra as in 6 let a k 0 2 k 1 a then we have a ra a 1 ra 1 ra 1 ra ra j cuntz and d quillen proved 10 theorem 4 2 6 theorem 1 there exists an isomorphism of z 2 graded complexes a a a ra 1 ra such that a ra is defined by a 0 da 1 da 2 n a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 n 1 a 2 n and a 1 ra a 0 da 1 da 2 n 1 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 n 1 a 2 n a 2 n 1 with respect to this identification the product in ra is just the fedosov product on even differential forms and the differentials on the x complex x ra ra a 1 ra a ra become the operators b 1 d a a n 2 b b a a where n 2 n 1 j 0 2 j da 1 dan dan da 1 let us denote by ia ra the ideal of even non commutative differential forms of order 2 by the universal property of 1 1 ra ia 1 ra ia 1 ra 1 ra ia dia since 1 ra ra dra dra ra then 1 ra ia ia 1 ra mod ra 1 r 1 ra ia 1 ra ra 1 ra ia dra dia for ia adic tower ra ia n 1 we have the complex x ra ia n 1 ra ian 1 1 ra ra 1 ra ia n 1 dra d ia n 1 define x 2 n 1 ra ia ra ia n 1 1 ra ra 1 ra ia n 1 dra d ia n 1 ra ia n 1 x 2 n ra ia ra ia n 1 ra ian 1 ra ra 1 ra d ia ndra ra ia n 1 ra ian one has b ia ndia ia n ia ia n 1 d ia n 1 n j 0 ia jd ia ia n j ia ndia ra 1 ra 11 and hence x 1 ra ia x ra ia x 0 ra ia ra ia there is a sequence of maps between complexes x ra ia x 2 n 1 ra ia x 2 n ra ia x ra ia we have the inverse limits x ra ia lim x ra ia n 1 lim x n ra ia remark that x q a f q a x ra ia a we quote the second main result of j cuntz and d quillen 6 thm 2 namely hix ra ia hpi a we now apply this machinery to our case first we have the following lemma 4 3 lim hp in hp c t proof by similar arguments as in the previous lemma 4 1 more precisely we have hp ini hp highest weight mod w c hp w c t by pontryagin duality now for each idempotent e mn a there is an unique element x mn r a then the element e x x 1 2 n 1 2 n 2 n 1 n x x 2 n 2 n mn r a is a lifting of e to an idempotent matrix in mn r a then the map e 7 tr e defines the map k 0 a h 0 x r a hp 0 a to an element g gln a one associates an element p gl r a and to the element g 1 an element q gln r a then put x 1 qp and y 1 pq and finally to each class g gln a one associates tr g 1 dg tr 1 x 1 d 1 x d tr log 1 x tr n 0 xndx 1 a then g tr g 1 dg defines the map k 1 a hh 1 a h 1 x r a hp 1 a 12 definition 4 4 let hp ini be the periodic cyclic cohomology defined by cuntz quillen then the pairing kalg c g n hp in c defines an algebraic non commutative chern character chalg k alg c g hp c g which gives us a variant of non commutative chern characters with values in hp groups we close this section with an algebraic analogue of theorem 3 2 theorem 4 5 let g be a compact lie group and t a fixed maximal compact torus of g then in the notations of 4 3 the chern character chalg k c g hp c g is an isomorphism which can be identified with the classical chern character ch kw c t hp w c t which is also an isomorphism proof first note that k c g k lim n i 1 matni c lim k n i 1 matni c k highest weight mod w c k c t next we have hp c g hp lim n i 1 matni c lim hp n i 1 matni c hp highest weight mod w c hp w c t furthermore by a result of cuntz quillen for the commutative c algebra a we have a canonical isomorphism from periodic cyclic homology to the z 2 graded de rham homology which is an isomorphism when a is smooth hence kw c t hp w c t now we have a commutative diagram k c g kw c t chalg ch hp c g hpw c t where ch are isomorphisms hence chalg 1 ch is an isomorphism 13
