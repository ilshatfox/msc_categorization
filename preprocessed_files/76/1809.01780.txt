mathematics mathematical institute university of oxford oxford ox 1 3 lb uk abstract steady and unsteady linearised flow past a submerged source are studied in the small surface tension limit in the absence of gravitational effects the free surface capillary waves generated are exponentially small in the surface tension and are determined using the theory of exponential asymptotics in the steady problem capillary waves are found to extend upstream from the source switching on across curves on the free surface known as stokes lines asymptotic predictions and compared with computational solutions for the position of the free surface in the unsteady problem transient effects cause the solution to display more compli cated asymptotic behaviour such as higher order stokes lines the theory of exponential asymptotics is applied to show how the capillary waves evolve over time and eventually tend to the steady solution 1 introduction 1 1 background free surface waves induced by flow over a submerged obstacle can broadly be divided into waves in which the dominant effect is gravity and waves in which the dominant effect is surface tension known as capillary waves the behaviour of waves on the length scale of large obstacles such as ships or submarines tend to be dominated by gravitational effects however surface tension plays an important role at smaller scales in this study we perform an asymptotic study of capillary waves caused by flow over a submerged source in the small surface tension limit electronic address christopher lustri mq edu au corresponding

demonstration that capillary waves caused by flow past an obstacle have a group velocity faster than the flow speed in two dimensions and therefore any steady wavetrain must be found upstream from the obstacle early studies on the behaviour of capillary waves in the absence of gravity include 20 who derived an exact closed form solution for two dimensional capillary waves on infinitely deep water and 35 who obtained similar solutions for capillary waves on water of finite depth further studies on related two dimensional capillary wave systems include 58 who discovered a new family of nonlinear capillary wave solutions on deep water 28 29 30 studied particle trajectories in capillary wave systems finding a range of symmetric and anti symmetric wave patterns more recently 59 extended the results of 20 and 35 to axisymmetric domains while 22 extended the solutions by 35 in order to consider capillary waves on the surface of multiply connected fluid domains 8 and 21 used complex variable methods to determine the behaviour of capillary waves on a flat and curved fluid sheet respectively and 55 studied the behaviour of capillary waves in systems with varying surface tension 56 provides a broad summary of known results on two dimensional nonlinear capillary wave systems including flows past geometry and around obstacles importantly we note that 17 studied the behaviour of exponentially small capillary waves in two dimensions using asymptotic methods similar to those applied in the present study each of these previous investigations concentrated on capillary waves in two dimensions capil lary waves in three dimensional systems are less well studied there do exist a large number of numerical studies into the behaviour of gravity capillary waves induced by flow past an obstacle or pressure distribution in three dimensions many of these are found in 23 and 57 and the references therein other three dimensional studies have concentrated on exploring capillary wave behaviour caused by rotating obstacles such as whirligig beetles 54 19 in particular we will note that our results are qualitatively similar to figure 2 of 54 which depicts an experi mental image of a whirligig beetle travelling through water in a straight line this experimental fluid regime is consistent with the parameter regime in the present study though of course the beetle is not submerged here we are concerned with three dimensional capillary waves in the small surface tension limit this is a challenging limit to explore as the behaviour of capillary waves past a submerged obstacle in this limit cannot be captured by an asymptotic power series the capillary wave amplitude is typically exponentially small in the surface tension we can motivate this claim by considering a steady train of two dimensional surface waves on deep water from 61 we find that after neglecting gravitational effects the wavelength of two dimensional linearised capillary waves denoted by on a steady flow with velocity u representative length scale l surface tension and density is given by l 2 lu 2 2 1 where lu 2 is the inverse weber number since the velocity potential satisfies laplace s 2 equation solutions which oscillate with the required wavelength are given up to a phase shift by c 1 e y c 2 e y sin x 2 where all distances have been scaled by l and c 1 and c 2 are arbitrary constants thus we might expect the impact of a submerged object on waves on the free surface to decay exponentially with the distance of the object from the free surface relative to consequently asymptotic studies of capillary wave behaviour in the limit 0 require the use of exponential asymptotic techniques these techniques described in 7 6 41 14 5 and elsewhere have been developed for the purpose of calculating such exponentially small behaviour more general introductions to expo nential asymptotic methods are found in 42 10 and 33 while comprehensive discussions are found in 45 and 12 in section 1 3 we will describe the exponential asymptotic methodology used in the present study which is based on the work of 41 14 15 and the theory in 31 as already noted 17 used exponential asymptotic techniques to determine the behaviour of nonlinear capillary waves in two dimensions while the neglect of gravity in the present study limits the range of its applicability it provides a step towards an analysis of a system containing both gravity and capillary waves in two dimensions an exponential asymptotic analysis has been performed on gravity capillary systems with small surface tension and small froude number by 50 51 these studies found an intricate interplay between gravity and capillary waves with a structure considerably more complicated than that of each effect considered in isolation an equivalent three dimensional analysis would be challenging and the present analysis at least provides an answer in the limit that capillarity dominates gravity exponential asymptotic methods have been applied in order to study a range of other wave problems arising in fluid dynamics 18 applied exponential asymptotic methods to resolve the low speed paradox finding the behaviour of exponentially small two dimensional gravity waves over a step in the small froude number limit this was extended in 38 to describe the waves caused by flow past submerged slopes ridges or trenches by 39 to describe gravity waves caused by flow past a submerged line source and by 53 52 in order to describe gravity waves caused by ship hulls in two dimensions these ideas were extended to three dimensions by 36 for the case of steady linearised flow past a source and 37 for the corresponding unsteady problem the present analysis follows a similar methodology to these studies of three dimensional flow shallow gravity capillary waves with small surface tension modelled by the singularly perturbed fifth order korteweg de vries kdv equation have also been the subject of a number of studies using exponential asymptotics including early work in 43 and subsequent studies by 10 9 27 26 49 62 these studies showed that any solitary wave solution to the singularly perturbed fifth order kdv equation must have a wavetrain with exponentially small non decaying amplitude proven rigorously in 4 32 48 other applications of exponential asymptotics in fluid dynamics include 34 and 60 who studied slow flow past a cylinder with small reynolds number using exponential asymptotics to 3 determine the flow asymmetry and drag and 16 who obtained self similar solutions for thin film rupture aside from 36 37 each of the previous exponential asymptotic studies on fluid flow behaviour have been performed in two dimensions we will therefore follow the methodology of 36 37 in which we linearise the problem around the source strength in order to fix the position of the boundary in the linearised regime we will then apply exponential asymptotic techniques directly to the flow equations in order to determine the fluid potential and the free surface position 1 2 fluid regime the combination of inviscid flow and capillary dominated surface waves is an unusual one this implies that we are considering systems in which both viscous effects and gravitational effects are negligible compared to surface tension for the inviscid fluid flow model to be valid we require that the inverse of the reynolds number given by 1 re ul where is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid to be small in this case the bernoulli condition for gravity capillary waves expressed in terms of the surface tension parameter and the froude number f is given by 1 2 2 1 f 2 0 on z 3 where is the complex potential is the free surface position is the surface curvature and the froude number given by f u gl we see that for the surface behaviour to be dominated by surface tension effects we require 1 f 2 consequently the regime under consideration is given by re 1 f 2 1 4 in contrast to the associated analysis on gravity waves performed by 36 37 this set of scalings is not relevant to the study of submerged obstacles such as submarines these scalings are instead associated with ripples caused by small submerged objects such as fish or insects which move rapidly or by thin sheets of fast moving fluid for example using values of the density viscosity and surface tension of water air at 20 c from 3 we require that u 72 m s 1 l 2 7 mm lu 2 0 000073 m 3 s 2 using values l 1 mm and u 0 5 m s 1 gives re 1 0 002008 f 2 0 03922 and 0 2917 studies of capillary waves in liquids other than water such as liquid silicon or liquid gallium whose capillary waves were investigated in 25 and 44 respectively will necessarily produce different parameter regimes in which the current analysis is valid 4 1 3 methodology in order to study the behaviour of capillary waves due to flow past submerged obstacles we will adapt the methodology of 36 for the steady flow case and 37 for the unsteady flow case these studies considered flow past submerged obstacles in the small froude number limit the surface waves were found to be exponentially small in this limit and therefore could not be studied using classical asymptotic power series techniques instead exponential asymptotic techniques were applied to determine the solution and it was found that the gravity waves were switched on as certain curves on the free surface known as stokes curves were crossed we will see that similar behaviour is present in the solution to the capillary wave problem in the small surface tension limit 46 first observed that a function containing multiple exponential terms in the complex plane can contain curves along which the behaviour of the subdominant exponential changes rapidly these curves are known as stokes lines this investigation will apply the exponential asymptotic technique developed by 41 and extended by 14 for investigating the smooth rapid switching of exponentially small asymptotic contributions across stokes lines the first step in this technique is to express the solution as an asymptotic power series such as f x n 0 nfn x as 0 as the capillary wave problem is singularity perturbed in the small surface tension limit the se ries will be divergent however the error of the divergent series approximation can be minimised by truncating the series after some finite number of terms known as the optimal truncation point to find the optimal truncation point we follow the commonly used heuristic described by 11 in which the series is truncated at its smallest term 14 observed that the optimal truncation point tends to become large in the asymptotic limit and hence knowledge of the behaviour of the late order terms of the series that is the form of an in the limit that n is sufficient to truncate the asymptotic series optimally in singular perturbation problems 24 noted that successive terms in the asymptotic series expansion are typically obtained by repeated differentiation of an earlier term in the series consequently singularities present in the early terms of the series expression will persist into later terms furthermore as these singularities are repeatedly differentiated the series terms will diverge as the ratio between a factorial and the increasing power of a function which is zero at the singularity 14 therefore propose that the asymptotic behaviour of the series terms may be expressed as a sum of factorial over power ansatz expressions each associated with a different early order singularity such as fn f n n as n 5 where is the gamma function defined in 1 f and are functions that do not depend on n and 0 at the singularity in the early series terms they conclude that the correct late term 5 behaviour may be represented as the sum of these ansatz expressions each associated with a different singularity of the leading order solution the global behaviour of the functions f and may be found by substituting this ansatz directly into the equations governing the terms of the asymptotic series and then matching to the local behaviour in the neighbourhood of the singularity under consideration the late order term behaviour given in 5 is related to applying a wkb ansatz of the form f e to the equation for f linearised about the truncated expansion the behaviour of or the singulant therefore plays an important role in understanding the stokes line behaviour in fact 24 notes that stokes switching takes place on curves where the switching exponential is maximally subdominant to the leading order behaviour this occurs where the singulant is purely real and positive hence the singulant provides a useful condition to determine the possible location of stokes lines re 0 im 0 6 we also note another interesting class of curves known as anti stokes lines these are curves across which an exponentially small solution contribution switches to instead be exponentially large in the asymptotic limit from the wkb ansatz of the exponential contribution it is apparent that anti stokes lines correspond to curves satisfying re 0 7 once the form of the late order terms is established we may find the smallest term in the series and hence truncate the series optimally this gives f x n 1 n 0 nan x rn where n x is the optimal truncation point and rn is the now exponentially small remainder term the method of 41 now involves substituting the truncated series expression back into the original problem obtaining an equation for the remainder term the switching behaviour of this remainder is found by solving the remainder equation in the neighbourhood of stokes lines in fact the condition 6 for the position of the stokes lines can be found directly through this process this methodology is sufficient to determine the capillary wave behaviour in steady three dimensional flow over a submerged source however this methodology alone is not enough to explain the behaviour seen in the unsteady capillary wave problem the exponential asymptotic methodology of 41 and 14 was developed for investigating ordinary differential equations because the flow surface is two dimensional we require the extension of these techniques to partial differential equations which was developed by 15 initially the method is identical however in some partial differential equations and indeed in higher order differential equations further variants of stokes switching may occur if the 6 remainder itself is expanded as rn e n 0 nr n n as 0 then again applying the method of 41 and 14 we truncate optimally giving rn e m 1 n 0 nr n n sm where sm is the new doubly exponentially subdominant remainder term it is obviously possi ble to formulate problems in which the remainder sm may be expanded as another exponentially subdominant divergent asymptotic series and so on hence we find that a hierarchy of increas ingly exponentially subdominant late order contributions may be present in the asymptotic expression the unsteady capillary wave problem contains two distinct pairs of exponentials in the asymp totic solution related to steady and transient rippling behaviour and the switching interaction between these pairs plays an important role in describing the solution in this case switching also occurs when one exponential component is maximally subdominant to another exponen tial component to find curves along which an exponential component with singulant 1 can switch a subdominant exponential component with singulant 2 the switching condition instead becomes re 2 re 1 im 2 im 1 note that setting 1 0 corresponding to the leading order algebraic contribution to the solution reproduces the condition 6 finally in order to fully describe the solution behaviour for the unsteady capillary wave problem we must also consider a further variant of stokes switching behaviour known as higher order stokes phenomenon higher order stokes switching was first observed by 2 and explained in detail by 31 and 15 these studies found that higher order stokes switching behaviour typically plays a role when there are three or more singulants contributing to the solution including the leading order singulant 0 when an ordinary stokes line is crossed an exponentially small contribution is switched on the size of which is governed by a stokes switching parameter when a higher order stokes line is crossed this switching parameter itself is switched on or off the effect of this higher order switching is that ordinary stokes lines themselves are switched on or off as higher order stokes lines are crossed higher order stokes lines originate at the intersection of multiple stokes lines in the complex plane known as stokes crossing points the practical effect of this switching is that higher order stokes lines can terminate at stokes crossing points rather than continuing indefinitely the study 31 showed that when a problem contains three or more singulant contributions 7 x z y z x y flow direction 0 0 h source figure 1 prescribed fluid configuration for three dimensional flow over a source the shaded region represents the position of the free surface x y and the cross represents the position of the source the flow region lies below the free surface and the mean flow is moving from left to right with flow velocity u in the unscaled problem the waves form upstream from the obstacle which is consistent with the theory of 61 for two dimensional capillary waves associated with 1 2 and 3 higher order stokes lines can follow curves satisfying the criterion im 3 2 3 1 0 unsteady free surface flow such as the unsteady gravity wave problem considered in 37 does contain three interacting contributions exponentially small steady and transient ripples and algebraic effects hence higher order stokes lines must play a role in the solution it is therefore not sufficient to find the ordinary stokes lines in this problem as the stokes structure would be incorrect instead we must also determine the higher order stokes line behaviour and therefore the location at which the ordinary stokes lines are switched on and off this will permit us to determine the full asymptotic free surface wave behaviour 2 steady flow 2 1 formulation we consider the steady state problem of uniform flow past a submerged point source in three dimensions we suppose that the strength of the source is small so that the problem may be linearised 2 1 1 full problem we consider a three dimensional incompressible irrotational inviscid free surface flow of infinite depth with a submerged point source at depth h and upstream flow velocity u we normalise the fluid velocity with u and distance with an typical length l giving nondimensionalised source depth h h l shown schematically in figure 1 denoting the nondimensional position of the free surface by z x y the nondimensional velocity potential satisfies 8 2 0 z x y 8 with kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions x x y y z z x y 9 1 2 2 1 0 z x y 10 where represents the curvature of the free surface positive if the centre of curvature lies in the fluid region and the inverse weber number lu 2 where represents the surface tension parameter and represents the fluid density the curvature is given by s s 1 s 2 11 where s represents the surface gradient of the flow we are concerned with the free surface behaviour in the limit 0 1 in which the surface tension effects become small since the flow is uniform in the far field x 1 there while at the source 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 as x y z 0 0 h 12 we will be concerned with the limit 0 so that the disturbance to the free stream is weak and the equations may be linearised in finally we incorporate a radiation condition which states that the steady surface capillary waves must propagate upstream 2 1 2 linearisation we linearise about uniform flow by setting x to give at leading order in 2 0 z 0 13 z x 0 z 0 14 x xx yy 0 z 0 15 where the boundary conditions are now applied on the fixed surface z 0 the far field conditions imply that 0 as x 2 y 2 z 2 while near the source 1 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 as x y z 0 0 h 16 9 figure 2 surface plot of the modified free surface position 0 where 0 is the leading order free surface profile given in 23 with h 1 and 0 2 with flow in the positive x direction the figure depicts capillary waves extending in the direction of the flow origin in addition to lower order effects above and ahead of the disturbance these visible lower order effects are not exponentially small ripples which are located behind the disturbance the contrast is increased in a circular region in order to make the position of the capillary waves visually distinguishable with the addition of a radiation condition specifying that capillary waves must propagate upstream from the source the system described in 13 16 completely specifies the linearied version of the three dimensional problem shown in figure 1 we can solve the linearised problem numerically using a modified version of the algorithm from 36 37 to obtain free surface profiles such as that illustrated in figure 2 we analytically continue the free surface such that x y c with the free surface still satisfying z 0 this does not change the form of 13 16 but it does mean that the two dimensional physical free surface is now a subset of a four dimensional complexified free surface 2 2 series expression following the approach of 36 we first expand the fluid potential and free surface position as a power series in n 0 n n n 0 n n 17 10 to give for n 0 2 n 0 z 0 18 n z n x 0 z 0 19 n x n 1 xx n 1 yy 0 z 0 20 with the convention that 1 0 the far field behaviour tends to zero at all orders of n and the singularity condition 16 is applied to the leading order expression giving 0 1 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 as x y z 0 0 h 21 the leading order solution is given by 0 1 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 1 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 22 0 xh 2 y 2 h 2 x 2 y 2 h 2 1 2 y 2 h 2 23 where the leading order free surface behaviour is set to be undisturbed far ahead of the source through repeated iteration of 19 20 we find that the position of singularities in subsequent terms of the series 17 remains constant while the power of the singularity increases at each order as we expect for such singular perturbation problems see 18 2 3 late order terms in order to optimally truncate the asymptotic series prescribed in 17 we must determine the form of the late order terms to accomplish this we make a factorial over power ansatz see 14 having the form n x y z n x y z n n x y n x y 0 n as n 24 where is a constant in order that 24 is the power series developed in section 2 2 we require that the singulant satisfies 0 on x 2 y 2 z h 2 0 25 where the sign chosen depends upon which of the two singularities is being considered for complex values of x y and z this defines a four dimensional hypersurface irrespective of which singularity is under consideration this hypersurface intersects the four dimensional complexified free surface on the two dimensional hypersurface satisfying x 2 y 2 h 2 0 it is important to note that the expression for n is restricted to z 0 as it describes the free surface position this does not pose a problem for the subsequent analysis but does ensure 11 that care must be taken at each stage to determine whether we are considering the full flow region or just the free surface 2 3 1 calculating the singulant applying the ansatz expressions in 24 to the governing equation 18 and taking the first two orders as n gives 2 x 2 y 2 z 0 26 2 x x 2 y y 2 z z xx yy zz 27 while the boundary conditions on z 0 become to leading order z x 0 28 x 2 x 2 y 0 29 the system in 28 29 has nonzero solutions when 2 x z 2 x 2 y 30 which gives the result z 2 x 2 x 2 y 31 using 31 we find a relationship between and by rearranging 28 to obtain x 2 x 2 y 32 applying 31 to 26 evaluated on z 0 gives a singulant equation for on the free surface 4 x 2 x 2 y 3 0 33 here though because the singularity lies below the fluid surface we must solve 33 for complex x and y with the boundary condition 0 on x 2 y 2 h 2 0 34 parametrising 34 as x 0 s y 0 i s 2 h 2 0 0 35 and solving 33 using charpit s method see 40 gives 9 x x 2 y 2 s 3 h 2 h 2 9 x 2 6 y 2 s 2 6 x y 2 h 2 s 4 h h 2 y 2 3 2 h 2 3 x 2 36 12 4 2 0 2 4 420 2 4 re x y anti stokes line 4 2 0 2 4 420 2 4 im x y 5 0 1 1 0 0 2

boundary data 34 the remaining singulant expressions are given by s 1 2 as well as s 1 2 where the bar denotes complex conjugation however the contri butions associated with s 2 s 2 as well as s 1 and s 1 will either produce waves directly downstream from the source or contain no stokes switching behaviour at all hence these singulants cannot generate exponentially small wave behaviour conversely surface behaviour associated with s 1 and s 1 will produce exponentially small waves in the upstream far field which are switched on across the stokes line satisfying im 0 note that there is no switching across the curve y 0 x 0 even though im 0 there because re 0 in this region where s is a solution to 9 x 2 y 2 s 4 12 xhs 3 4 h 2 9 x 2 12 y 2 s 2 12 xhs 4 h 2 y 2 0 37 equations 36 37 give eight possible expressions for the singulant corresponding to the choice of sign in 36 and the four solutions to 37 these therefore give eight possible sets of late order behaviour in the problem contour plots illustrating the behaviour of the singulant terms are presented in figure 3 for h 1 to indicate that we are considering the steady behaviour we have labelled the singulants as s 1 and s 2 where the number indicates two different solutions from which all eight singulant expressions may be easily obtained specifically the eight expressions are given by s 1 2 and s 1 2 where the bar denotes complex conjugation we also note that s 2 may be obtained by reflecting s 1 in the y axis 13 we recall from the methodology description that stokes switching of exponentially small con tributions to the solution occurs across curves known as stokes lines which must satisfy the condition on the singulant given in 6 as we have obtained explicit expressions for the sin gulant we are able to determine the location of the stokes lines in the solution illustrated in figure 3 for s 1 and s 2 the stokes lines are illustrated by bold curves in the plots of im on the right hand side of figure 3 while we used the condition 6 to identify the stokes line locations it appears also as a consequence of the matched asymptotic analysis which may be seen in appendix b we may also determine the location of anti stokes lines using 7 which are depicted as bold curves on the plots of re on the left hand side of this figure these curves are important as we know that the corresponding exponential contribution must be inactive in any region containing anti stokes lines as otherwise it would become exponentially large and therefore dominant as the anti stokes lines is crossed from figure 3 we therefore see that any free surface behaviour associated with s 2 or s 2 must be switched on in the downstream region and hence produce capillary waves in the downstream far field which violates the radiation condition furthermore both s 2 or s 2 have re 0 across the stokes line satisfying im 0 and hence no stokes switching can occur this is also true of s 1 and s 1 consequently none of these singulant contributions will produce exponentially small free surface capillary waves however s 1 and s 1 have re 0 across the stokes line as well as in the entire region in which the associated exponentially small wave behaviour is switched on additionally the wave behaviour is upstream from the obstacle from this we conclude that the capillary wave behaviour on the free surface is caused by the late order terms associated with s 1 and s 1 the full stokes structure of the solution is therefore depicted in figure 3 a comparing the stokes structure in figure 3 a with the numerical free surface plot in figure 2 we see that the region upstream of the stokes line in which the exponentially small ripples are present in the solution corresponds to the numerically calculated ripples in the surface plot there are other features in the numerical plot which do not correspond to exponentially small ripples and are present on both sides of the stokes line these features are not waves but rather non wavelike disturbances to the undisturbed flow found at algebraic orders of in the small surface tension limit as s 1 and s 1 are the only contributions that contribute to the steady capillary wave behaviour we will subsequently denote these as s and s respectively 2 3 2 calculating the prefactor in order to obtain a complete expression for the late order terms 24 we require an expression for the prefactors and to find the prefactor equation we consider the next order in 14 19 20 as n expanding the prefactors in the form of a power series in n as n 0 1 n 1 0 1 n 1 38 and applying the late order ansatz to 26 29 now gives z 1 x 1 0 z 0 x x 1 2 x 2 y 1 0 x 2 x 0 x 2 y 0 y xx yy 0 this system only has nontrivial solutions for 1 and 1 when x 0 z 0 x z 0 x 2 x 0 x 2 y 0 y xx yy 0 39 since we are presently interested in the leading order behaviour of the prefactor for ease of notation we now omit the subscripts and denote 0 by and 0 by this therefore gives z x z x x 2 x x 2 y y xx yy 40 now to solve the prefactor equation 27 we use this result as well as 31 to express the original equation entirely in terms of x and y derivatives the resultant expression has the same ray equations as the singulant hence we can express the prefactor equation using the characteristic variable of the singulant s which is given in terms of physical variables in 37 to fully determine the prefactor we must subsequently match the solution of the prefactor equation to the behaviour of the flow in the neighbourhood of the singularity as described in 14 this analysis is performed in appendix a and gives s 2 4 3 2 h 3 2 1 3 h 4 4 s 4 6 s 2 h 2 3 h 4 s x s 3 3 s 2 2 h 2 2 s 4 3 h 4 s 2 24 s 8 34 s 6 h 2 36 s 4 h 4 35 h 6 s 2 14 h 8 2 h 6 3 h 4 6 s 2 h 2 4 s 4 41 where s is the solution of 37 corresponding to the singulant illustrated in figure 3 finally to find we ensure that the strength of the singularity in the late order behaviour n given in 24 is consistent with the leading order behaviour 0 which has strength 1 2 it is clear from the recurrence relation 53 that the strength of the singularity will increase by one between n 1 and n this implies that near the singularity at x 2 y 2 h 2 0 x y x 2 y 2 h 2 1 2 42 where is of order one in the limit from 41 we see that the prefactor is also order one in this limit while the local analysis near the singularity 73 showed that 1 will be a singularity with strength one at x 2 y 2 h 2 0 consequently matching the order of the expressions in 42 gives 1 2 we have therefore completely described the late order terms given in 24 where 32 is used 15 4 3 2 1 5 1 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 1 2 lo g 1 0 x a m p log 1 0 x a m p log 10 numerical asymptotic figure 4 numerical dots verses scaled asymptotic line amplitude of capillary waves in the far field x along y 0 for h 1 to determine the value of in appendix b we use the form of the late order terms ansatz in 24 in order to apply the matched asymptotic expansion methodology of 41 we optimally truncate the asymptotic series and then find an equation for the exponentially small truncation remainder using this expression we determine where the exponentially small remainder varies rapidly which corresponds to the location of stokes lines if we had not applied the condition in 6 this would have been necessary to determine the stokes structure of the solution finally we use matched asymptotic expansions in the neighbourhood of the stokes lines in order to determine the quantity that is switched on as the stokes lines are crossed using this method we find that the exponentially small contributions to the fluid potential denoted exp and free surface position denoted exp are switched on across the stokes line and in regions in which they are active they are given by exp 2 i e s c c exp 2 i e s c c 43 where c c denotes the complex conjugate contribution in particular the expression for exp contains exponentially small oscillations representing the capillary ripples on the free surface 16 2 4 results and comparison evaluating the amplitude of the waves along y 0 gives exp i 2 4 h 3 ix e h ix c c 0 44 in the limit that x becomes large and negative we find that the amplitude of the capillary waves along y 0 is given by amplitude 2 e h 6 x x 0 45 this provides us with the means to check the accuracy of our approximation we can compare the amplitude of the asymptotic results with those of numerically calculated free surface profiles calculated using an adaption of the method described 36 in figure 4 we illustrate the scaled numerical amplitude circles against the asymptotic predic tion from 45 computed for h 1 over a range of values it is apparent that there is strong agreement between the numerical and the asymptotic results for values of smaller than those depicted it become numerically challenging to compute the wave behaviour due to the very small amplitude of the resulting waves 3 unsteady flow 3 1 formulation in this section we consider the same flow configuration described in section 2 however we permit the system to vary in time we prescribe the initial state of the flow and investigate the resultant unsteady behaviour 3 1 1 full problem we again consider three dimensional potential flow with infinite depth and a submerged point source at depth h and upstream flow velocity u we normalise the fluid velocity with u and distance by with an unspecified length l giving nondimensionalised source depth h h l denoting the nondimensional position of the free surface by z x y t the nondimensional velocity potential again satisfied laplace s equation 8 however the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions respectively become x x y y t z z x y t 46 t 1 2 t 2 1 0 z x y t 47 where again denotes the inverse weber number and the curvature of the surface the far 17 field conditions are identical to those in section 2 the source condition is given by 12 as the problem is unsteady we do not require a radiation condition but rather specify that the free surface must be waveless in the far field finally we require an initial condition as in 37 we specify that the initial state is given by the leading order solution to the steady problem given in 22 23 hence the initial behaviour takes the form x y z 0 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 4 x 2 y 2 z h 2 48 x y 0 xh 2 y 2 h 2 x 2 y 2 h 2 2 y 2 h 2 49 the reason for this choice of initial condition is that it enables us to focus on wave generation rather than the bulk flow adjusting to the presence of the source in particular it guarantees that the leading order solution is steady and hence that the leading order behaviour 0 x y z t x y z 0 and 0 x y t x y 0 note that it does not imply that any subsequent order is steady 3 1 2 linearisation we again linearise about uniform flow and find that the governing equation 13 is valid in the unsteady problem however the boundary conditions become z x t 0 z 0 50 x t xx yy 0 z 0 51 where the boundary conditions are again applied on the fixed surface z 0 the far field conditions imply that 0 as x 2 y 2 z 2 while near the source 16 still holds the initial condition is still given by 48 49 we again analytically continue the free surface such that x y c with the free surface still satisfying z 0 we do not however need to analytically continue t in this problem continua tion does not change the form of 13 16 but it does mean that the three physical free surface with two spatial and one time dimensions is now a subset of a five dimensional complexified free surface we can again solve the linearised problem numerically using the method from 37 to obtain numerical free surface profiles such as that illustrated in figure 5 3 1 3 series expression again we expand the fluid potential and free surface position as a power series in the governing equation is given by 18 while the boundary conditions become for n 0 n z n x n t 0 z 0 52 n x n t n 1 xx n 1 yy 0 z 0 53 18 figure 5 surface plot of the modified free surface position 0 where 0 is the leading order free surface profile given in 23 with h 1 and 0 2 the initial condition of the flow is given by 0 and therefore 0 0 this image corresponds to t 40 flow is in the positive x direction we can see capillary waves extending upstream from the obstacle however they have not propagated to the negative edge of the displayed region in order to show the position of the wavefront clearly the contrast has been increased in a circular region of the figure again with the convention that 1 0 the far field behaviour tends to zero at all orders of n and the singularity condition 16 is applied to the leading order expression giving the source condition in 21 the initial condition is obtained using 48 49 as the leading order behaviour is steady we find that 0 0 x y z 0 and 0 0 x y 0 3 2 late order terms in order to optimally truncate the asymptotic series prescribed in 17 we must determine the form of the late order terms to accomplish this we make the new unsteady factorial over power ansatz 14 n x y z t n x y z t n n x y t n x y 0 t n as n 54 which varies now in t as well as the spatial dimensions a nearly identical analysis to section 2 3 1 gives the singulant equation on the free surface as x t 4 2 x 2 y 3 0 55 in considering the unsteady flow problem we will restrict our attention to the singulants ignor ing the prefactor equation and use the singulant behaviour to determine the position of stokes 19 lines and wave regions on the free surface 3 2 1 calculating the singulant to determine the singulant behaviour on the free surface we note that the leading order be haviour does have singularities on the analytically continued free surface located at x 2 y 2 z h 2 0 for all time and that these are identical to those described in 3 2 1 as a consequence wave behaviour associated with 1 and 1 will be present on the free surface the presence of these waves is unsurprising as the steady wave behaviour satisfies 14 15 as well as the governing equation however we do see from figure 3 that these singulants lead to wave behaviour far upstream of the obstacle which violates the prescribed waveless far field condition consequently we infer that there must be another wave contribution which introduces more complicated stokes line behaviour into the unsteady problem specifically we note that a second singularity is present in the unsteady problem introduced in the unsteady second order terms as in 13 and 37 we require that all characteristics pass through the disturbance located at x 2 y 2 z h 2 0 when t 0 as in 37 we observe that this singularity corresponds to the instantaneous initial change introduced into the flow at t 0 hence we apply the boundary conditions x 0 s y 0 i s 2 h 2 0 0 t 0 56 the singulant equation 55 may again be solved using charpit s method however the analysis is simpler if we note that the solution may be expressed in a reduced set of coordinates t x t 2 y 2 57 implying that the solution is radially symmetric about the propagating point x t this is consistent with the boundary data and reduces the singulant equation 55 to 4 6 p 0 58 with the boundary conditions becoming 0 0 0 ih 0 0 59 solving this much simpler equation using charpit s method gives four nonzero solutions which take the form 4 i ih 3 27 2 60 where the signs may be chosen independently we will refer to the solution with the first sign being positive and the second being negative as u and hence the remaining possible singulant expressions are given by u and u we illustrate this singulant behaviour in figure 6 20 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 3210 3 2 1 re t 2 x t y 3 2 1 0 3 2 1 3210 3 2 1 im t 2 x t y 10 0 2 figure 6 singulant behaviour u obtained by solving 58 with boundary data 59 the expression is scaled by t 2 and presented in a frame moving with the flow so that the resultant behaviour is constant in time the remaining singulant expressions associated with unsteady behaviour are given by u as well as u we see that stokes switching is possible for u as re 0 across the stokes line satisfying re 0 there is an anti stokes line inside the stokes line meaning that any surface wave behaviour would become exponentially large as this line is crossed consequently we conclude that the unsteady exponentially small contribution cannot be present inside the stokes line and must instead be switched on outside the same is true of the contribution associated with u however re u and re u are both negative as the stokes line is crossed and hence these singulants cannot produce any stokes switching on the free surface importantly we see from 60 that re u 0 on h 3 im u 0 on 3 h 61 the first of these conditions describes the location of anti stokes lines while the second describes the location of stokes lines these may be seen clearly in figure 6 where the anti stokes and stokes lines are described by concentric circles about x t importantly the anti stokes lines are always contained within the stokes lines meaning that any waves contained within the stokes line circle will produce exponentially large behaviour on the free surface consequently we conclude the free surface can only contain wave behaviour outside the stokes lines furthermore we see that only u and u have re 0 as the stokes line is crossed therefore it is only these contributions that will be switched across the stokes lines hence inside the stokes line there are no exponentially small free surface waves associated with the unsteady contribution but as the stokes line is crossed waves associated with u and u will be switched on 3 3 stokes line interactions we have shown that there are two sets of stokes line behaviours on the free surface associated with s u and their complex conjugate expressions across which the leading order behaviour switched on exponentially small contributions to the free surface behaviour however to fully describe the free surface behaviour we must consider stokes lines caused by the interaction between s and u as well as the interaction between s and u in this section we will restrict 21 x y im s 0 im u 0 im u im s re u re s im u im s re s re u stokes crossing point active stokes crossing point inactive 5 5 5 5 0 0 figure 7 relevant stokes and higher order stokes lines present on the free surface for t 5 and h 1 the wide gray and black curves are the stokes lines associated with the steady and unsteady contributions satisfying im s 0 and im u 0 respectively the solid narrow curve is a stokes line across which the unsteady contribution switches the steady contribution satisfying im s im u and re u re s the dashed narrow curves are stokes lines across which the steady contribution would switch the unsteady contribution however these contributions are inactive the filled circles are stokes crossing points at which stokes lines terminate the empty circles are potential stokes crossing points where at least one of the contributions is inactive and therefore nothing occurs our attention to s and u noting that the same switching behaviour will be demonstrated by the complex conjugate expressions in previous analyses of the stokes structure of partial differential equations 15 31 it was found that stokes switching may also occur when one exponentially subdominant contribution switches on a further subdominant contribution hence we find that stokes switching also occurs on curves satisfying im s im u and re u re s across which the capillary wave wave behaviour associated with u is switched on consequently the complete stokes structure contains three sets of equal phase lines which are illustrated in figure 7 for t 5 and h 1 although the equal phase line following y 0 has been omitted as it was established in section 2 to be inactive we have also illustrated the anti stokes line along which re s re u it is not possible however for all three sets of potential stokes lines to be active throughout the domain we recall from 31 and 15 that stokes lines may become inactive as they cross higher order stokes lines which originate at stokes crossing points scp a stokes crossing point is found when three different stokes lines intersect at a single point and is represented in figure 22 0 2 4 60 2 4 8 0 2 4 6 2 4 6 x y no waves unsteady ripple steady waves and unsteady ripple

behaviour for h 1 and t 3 5 10 and 20 in the white region no contributions are present in the light grey region the expanding ripple centred about x t is present while in the dark grey region both the unsteady ripple and the steady waves are present on the free surface the arrows in a indicate the direction in which the stokes lines move over time the waveless region has constant radius of 3 h and is present downstream from the obstacle the region containing steady waves tends to an expanding circular region with a narrow section removed 7 as a black circle noting that stokes lines can terminate only at stokes crossing points we determine that the region in which the unsteady ripple and steady waves are present are those indicated in figure 8 again for h 1 over a range of times in this figure we see that dashed curve satisfying im s im u does not contribute to the free surface behaviour this is because the steady wave contribution would exponentially dominate and therefore switch the unsteady ripple across this curve however the capillary wave contribution is switched off along the inner curve and therefore is not present in this region and therefore no stokes switching occurs we therefore find that the free surface wave behaviour consists of an unsteady ripple present outside a circular region of growing radius and an expanding region containing steady waves that spreads outwards from x y 0 0 as t the radius of this expanding region will become infinite and the steady wave behaviour will be equivalent to that obtained for the steady problem in section 2 by solving im s im u 62 23 20 15 10 5 0 25 0 5 10 4 5 10 4 x 0 4 022 a t 10 20 15 10 5 0 25 9 011 b t 20 20 15 10 5 0 25 14 001 c t 30 20 15 10 5 0 25 0 5 10 4 5 10 4 x 0 19 000 d t 40 20 15 10 5 0 25 24

is crossed the axes are only shown on the first figure of each row but are identical for each figure we can determine the position of the expanding capillary wavefront this becomes x 4 t x 2 3 h 2 t x 2 27 t 2 63 we recall that on y 0 the singulant is given by s h ix for x 0 if we define a moving frame x t 2 and equate im s with the imaginary part of the corresponding unsteady singulant from 60 we find that 0 2 h 2 2 3 t o t 2 as t 64 matching this expression at o t 1 as t gives the boundary of the expanding capillary wave region on y 0 as one of h or h in this limit we see from figure 7 that the active stokes line is located at the interior of these two points and therefore that the front position tends to h as t or x t 2 h as t 65 3 4 results and comparison in figure 9 we compare these results to numerical computations obtained using the numerical scheme adapted from the algorithm detailed in 37 in this figure we show that the expanding front matches the position obtained by solving im s im u exactly in each case we expect that the waves will switch on as the stokes line is crossed and consequently that the 24 figure 10 modified free surface at t 20 with 0 15 obtained numerically the dashed curve illustrates the stokes curve the black and white solid curves denote the point at which each wave takes half of the maximum wave amplitude for that particular wave trough it can be seen that each of the indicated troughs reduces to half amplitude approximately as the stokes line is crossed there is some visible wave behaviour outside this region due to the fact that stokes switching behaviour is smooth for finite waves have half amplitude at this point and rapidly decay as it is crossed this is consistent with the computed free surface behaviour we see that the position of the stokes line accurately describes the boundary of the capillary wave region and therefore the propagation of these capillary waves finally in figure 10 we show the full computed two dimensional system for t 20 and 0 15 with the position of the stokes line overlaid we see that the capillary waves are clearly switched on in the interior of the predicted stokes line decaying to half of the maximum wave amplitude at the stokes line and rapidly decaying away as the stokes line is crossed into the exterior region 4 discussion and conclusions 4 1 conclusions in this investigation we calculated the behaviour of steady and unsteady capillary waves on the free surface of flow over a point source in three dimensions in the low surface tension limit we considered the source to be weak and therefore linearised the problem about the undisturbed solution in the analysis of the unsteady capillary wave problem the flow was initially set to be waveless 25 we subsequently applied exponential asymptotic techniques in order to determine the behaviour of the resultant capillary waves by analysing the stokes switching behaviour present in the solution to the problem we were able to determine the form of the waves on the free surface examples of this behaviour are illustrated in figure 2 for the steady flow problem and figure 5 for the unsteady flow problem we note that the steady wave behaviour seen in figure 2 with the behaviour illustrated in figure 3 a is qualitatively similar to the flow induced by a whirligig beetle in figure 2 of 54 in the steady case the far field amplitude of these capillary waves was compared to numerical solutions to the linearised equations in figure 4 the numerical results were obtained by for mulating the solution to the linearised system as an integral equation using methods similar to those given in 36 and evaluating the integral numerically the comparison showed agreement between the asymptotic and numerical wave amplitudes we then considered the behaviour of unsteady capillary waves in order to determine how these waves propagate over time we found that there is a transient component of the surface be haviour generated by the initial disturbance this transient surface behaviour switched on capillary waves across a second generation stokes line which moves in space as t increases we also determined the location of higher order stokes phenomenon which determined locations at which stokes curves terminate this was required in order to complete the stokes structure of the unsteady problem illustrated in figure 7 this analysis showed that the steady capillary waves are restricted to a circular region of increasing size with the downstream region removed finally we compared the position of the spreading wavefront predicted by the asymptotics with numerical solutions to the unsteady problem the numerical solutions were obtained by formulating an integral expression for the surface behaviour in a similar fashion to 37 and computing the solution to the integrals the results are seen in figure 9 and 10 and show agreement between the asymptotic and numerical results the natural next step in this investigation is to study the stokes structure that appears in systems in which both gravity and capillary waves play an important role following the work of 50 51 we expect that the behaviour of surface waves in these systems requires determining not only the individual gravity and capillary wave contributions but also the higher order and second generation stokes interactions within the system a brief analysis of the combined gravity capillary wave problem is included in appendix c in which the singulant equation is obtained however solving this singulant equation is a challenging numerical problem that is beyond the scope of this study a finding the prefactor a 1 prefactor equation in order to solve the prefactor equation 27 we will express the equation on the free surface entirely in terms of x and y derivatives this will result in an equation that has the exact same 26 ray structure as the singulant equation 33 and hence the solution may be obtained in terms of the same characteristic variables to accomplish this we must eliminate the z derivatives from all relevant quantities equations 31 and 40 give appropriate expressions for z and z respectively however we must still consider the second derivative terms that will appear in the equation taking derivatives of 31 and rearranging gives xz 2 x xx 2 x 2 y 2 2 x x xx y xy 2 x 2 y 2 66 yz 2 x xy 2 x 2 y 2 2 x x xy y yy 2 x 2 y 2 67 zz 4 2 x 2 y xx 2 y 2 x y xy 2 x yy 2 x 2 y 4 68 using 66 68 as well as 31 32 and 40 we are finally able to write the prefactor equation 27 in terms of x and y derivatives on z 0 as 4 3 x 6 x 2 x 2 y x 6 y 2 x 2 y y g x y 69 where g x y 6 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 x 2 y 2 xx 8 3 x y 2 x 2 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 xy 2 4 x 2 x 5 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 x 2 y 2 yy this equation may be solved using the method of characteristics giving the ray equations with characteristic variable u as dx du 4 3 x 6 x 2 x 2 y 2 dy du 6 y 2 x 2 y 2 d du g x y 70 the first two of these equations govern the ray paths and importantly are identical to the ray equations associated with 33 this allows 70 to be written in terms of the associated charpit variables and solved to give s u s 0 1 6 s 6 u 4 s 4 6 s 2 h 2 3 h 4 h 7 2 s 4 3 h 4 s 2 24 s 8 34 s 6 h 2 36 s 4 h 4 35 h 6 s 2 14 h 8 6 h 6 3 h 4 6 s 2 h 2 4 s 4 71 where the characteristic variable u is given by u h 11 s x 2 s 9 3 s 2 2 72 selecting the corresponding expression for s in terms of x and y from 37 gives the solution in terms of the physical coordinates x and y to find an expression for s 0 the behaviour of the 27 system in the neighbourhood of u 0 must be computed and matched to this outer solution a 2 inner problem to solve the inner problem we first consider the behaviour of l 1 near the singularity at x 2 y 2 z h 2 0 which takes the form l 1 x 2 2 h 3 x 2 y 2 z h 2 73 in the prefactor equation 41 we see that the unknown coefficient is a function of s from 35 it follows that s x near the singularity at t 0 hence we define a system of inner coordinates given by 1 x 2 2 h 3 x 2 y 2 z h 2 2 x 2 2 h 3 x 2 y 2 z h 2 x 74 to leading order in the linearised governing equation 13 becomes omitting the bars 3 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 2 1 0 where terms containing derivatives with respect to both 1 and 2 were disregarded due to the form of the inner expansion 78 similarly the boundary conditions 14 15 become h 1 h 2 1 2 0 on 1 2 75 h 1 h 2 1 1 2 2 0 on 1 2 76 finally by expressing the leading order behaviour 22 in terms of the local variables we find that 0 2 8 h 3 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 8 h 3 2 1 2 1 2 2 77 we now define the series expansion near the singularity on the complexified free surface as n 0 an n 1 2 n 1 2 1 bn n 1 2 n 1 2 2 n 0 2 cn n 1 2 n 1 2 1 78 where the latter expression is only valid on the free surface itself on which 1 2 the factor of two is included for subsequent algebraic convenience and has no effect on the solution to the problem as cn is unknown at this stage from 77 we have a 0 2 8 h 3 2 b 0 2 8 h 3 2 79 we are interested in the behaviour of the terms on the complexified free surface in the neigh bourhood of the singularity at x 2 y 2 h 2 0 consequently we apply the series expression to 75 on the surface defined by 1 2 and match in the limit that 1 and therefore 2 28 tend to zero giving h an bn 2 cn 0 n 0 80 applying the series expansion to 76 and matching in the same limit gives h n 3 2 an bn 2 cn 1 0 n 0 81 we are interested in the behaviour on the complexified free surface however restricting the domain in this fashion means that it is impossible to distinguish between the contributions from the series in 1 and the series in 2 however we see that the two contributions have equal magnitude in 77 as the singular behaviour of the problem is preserved in all higher orders 24 we conclude that this must be true of the contributions at all subsequent orders we therefore specify that an bn in order to maintain consistency with the leading order behaviour this may only be accomplished if we divide the two equations given in 80 81 into four equations such that han cn 0 h n 1 2 an cn 1 0 hbn cn 0 h n 1 2 bn cn 1 0 we will consider only the first two of these equations noting that the remaining equations imply that bn 1 nan eliminating cn from this system gives an 1 n 1 2 an a 0 n 1 2 1 2 hence using the expression for a 0 given in 79 we may match the local series expression given in 78 with the prefactor given in 41 noting that is the local expression for s in the outer solution and that s 0 in the outer coordinates matches with an bn in the inner coordinates we find that s 0 s 2 4 3 2 h 3 2 82 hence we are able to completely describe the late order behaviour of terms in 17 with the complete expression given in 41 b stokes smoothing the asymptotic series given in 17 may be truncated to give n 1 n 0 n n r n n 1 n 0 n n s n where n will be chosen in order to minimise the remainders r n and s n applying this series expression to 13 gives 2 r n 0 83 29 while the boundary conditions 14 15 become on z 0 r n z s n x 0 84 r n x s n xx s n yy n n 1 xx n 1 yy 85 having made use of the relationship in 20 and the fact that 0 x 0 the homogeneous form of 83 85 is satisfied as 0 by r n e s n e where is one of the singulants determined from 36 37 we therefore set the remainder terms for the inhomogeneous problem to take the form r n a x y z e s n b x y e 86 where a and b are stokes switching parameters from 84 we see that a b on z 0 to determine the late order term behaviour we will require the first correction term for the prefactors and we therefore set 0 1 0 1 applying the remainder forms given in 86 to the boundary conditions 84 and 85 gives after some rearrangement a x 1 a z 1 a 0 x ax 0 a 0 z az 0 a x 1 a 2 x 2 y 1 2 a x 0 x 2 a y 0 y 2 ax x

motivated by the homogeneous solution we express the equation in terms of and y and apply 32 to obtain a ne n 3 2 n 3 2 30 the optimal truncation point is given by n in the limit that 0 we write rei with r and real so that n r where is necessary to make n an integer since n depends on r but not we write ie i r using stirling s formula on the resultant expression gives a i 2 r exp r ei 1 i r 1 2 this variation is exponentially small except in the neighbourhood of the stokes line given by 0 where it is algebraically large to investigate the rapid change in a in the vicinity of the stokes line we set 1 2 giving a i 2 r e r 2 2 so that a i 2 r e t 2 2 dt c where c is constant thus as the stokes line is crossed a rapidly increases from 0 to 2 i 1 2 using 86 we find the variation in the fluid potential and we subsequently use 84 to relate b to a and therefore find the variation in the free surface behaviour as the stokes line is crossed the stokes line variation for the potential and free surface position are respectively given by r n 2 i e s s n 2 i e s 88 where we have reintroduced the specific singulant form s hence if we determine the prefactor and singulant behaviour associated with each contribution 88 gives an expression for the behaviour switched on across the appropriate stokes line the combined expression for the exponentially small terms in regions where they are active is therefore given by 43 c gravity capillary waves the natural sequel to this work is to combine capillary and gravity waves in order to determine how the two wave contributions interact it is likely that the stokes structure will be significantly more complicated than the stokes structure for either capillary or gravity waves alone previous work on the two dimensional problem by 50 51 shows that the interaction between stokes lines associated with gravity and capillary waves plays an important role in the behaviour of waves on the free surface including both gravity and capillary effects in the analysis requires scaling both the weber number we lu 2 and the froude number f u gl where as before is the surface tension is the fluid density u is the background fluid velocity l is a representative length 31 scale and g is the acceleration due to gravity as determined by 50 51 we see that the scaling in which both gravity and capillary waves play an important role is given by setting f 2 and we 1 2 as 0 the variables and determine the relationship between the froude and weber number this gives a system that is nearly identical to 8 12 with the dynamic condition 10 now given by 2 2 1 2 on z x y 89 after linearisation this boundary condition becomes x 2 xx yy on z 0 90 applying late order techniques to the linearised system in a similar fashion to section 2 3 yields the singulant equation 2 4 x 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 1 2 0 91 with the boundary condition 0 on x 2 y 2 h 2 0 92 we see that when 0 this system gives the gravity wave singulant from 36 while for 1 the capillary wave singulant 33 is obtained in the limit the stokes surfaces can be obtained by obtaining the full set of solutions to this system and determining the stokes surfaces this is a challenging
