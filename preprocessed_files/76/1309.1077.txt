doi 10 1140 epje i 2012 12111 1 1 introduction the active locomotion of cells and transport of fluids on microscopic scales has been a benchmark problem in ap plied mathematics for the past 60 years since taylor 1 demonstrated that a two dimensional sheet could swim utilising only viscous forces the field had been an active area of research for zoologists for some time 2 3 4 5 though a leap forward in understanding was made when experimentalists and theoreticians began to collaborate it was in this spirit of collaboration fostered by taylor and gray that hancock 6 first developed slender body theory a powerful method based upon modelling slender swimmers by distributions of force singularities which in turn has led to the development of the singularity methods used in the present study microscale fluid propulsion is usually achieved in na ture through the beating of cilia and flagella these are slender hair like organelles that perform a range of func tions from locomotion to sensory reception in reproduc tion flagella propel sperm cells allowing sperm and egg to meet and cilia transfer the fertilised embryo from the ampulla to the uterus then in the early stages of verte brate embryonic development cilia are responsible for the production of a directional fluid flow which breaks left right symmetry in vertebrates 7 this occurs in a fluid filled cavity that appears on the embryo shortly after fer tilisation called the node in eukaryotic cells cilia and flagella induce active bend ing along their length via a remarkable evolutionarily conserved internal structure known as the axoneme which was discovered with the advent of electron microscopy 8 9 10 the axoneme comprises 9 inextensible outer mi crotubule doublets as shown in fig 1 and passive linking elements which stiffen the assembly the combination of relative localised microtubule sliding their inextensibility 1 ar x iv 1 30 9 10 77 v 1 q bi o q m 4 s ep 2 01 3 and the restraining effects of linking structures generates bending this is the sliding filament theory first demon strated by satir 11 for human sperm as with most motile cilia and flagella a central pair of microtubules runs along the length of the axoneme this configuration is referred to as the 9 2 axoneme nodal cilia however lack this central pair these 9 0 cilia were thought to be immotile until the relatively recent work of nonaka et al 7 which showed that they whirled with a near rigid body motion quite distinct from the extensively studied beat patterns of 9 2 cilia in newtonian fluids such as sea water microscopic cilia and flagella must execute a beat pattern that is not time reversible 12 in order to generate a net fluid flow this is due to the lack of time dependence in the governing fluid equations which are discussed in sect 2 for sperm flag ella time reversibility is broken by propagating a bending wave along the length of the flagellum however nodal cilia are incapable of executing sophisticated waveforms and so instead break symmetry by tilting their axis of rotation in a given direction hydrodynamic interaction with the cell wall then leads to an effective recovery stroke asymmetry in this paper we first summarise the fluid mechanics that govern the flow generated by cilia and flagella we discuss the flow solution generated by a singular force and the relationship between this fundamental solution and the physics governing the flow induced by the mo tion of slender bodies we show how the effects of a no slip wall may be incorporated through the inclusion of image systems involving higher order flow singularities such as point stresses and torques these are demon strated graphically via singularity diagrams we then discuss computational techniques that have arisen from modelling the action of cilia and flagella on the fluid by distributions of these flow singularities a combination of these computational techniques is used to model cilia driven flow in the embryonic node in mice fig 2 the node is modelled at various stages of development and the effects of posterior cilium tilt on the generation of directional flow is examined for many biological flow problems for instance the swimming of sperm through cervical mucus the assump tion of newtonian fluid rheology as discussed in sect 2 is invalid in such cases the fluid dynamics is governed by complicated nonlinear equations we apply a finite el ement method developed by montenegro johnson et al 13 to an artificial swimmer described by najafi and golestanian 14 and examine the effects of nonlinear fluid rheology on the swimmer s progression we then apply the same techniques to model a two dimensional analogue outer dynein armouter fiber doublet membrane central fiber radial link head radial

here f is the body force acting on the fluid such as gravity is the fluid density and u is the fluid velocity in a fixed frame of reference the stress tensor incorporates the forces acting over the surface of an arbitrary parcel of fluid such as pressure and internal friction and is dependent on the type of fluid being modelled for newtonian fluids stress is proportional to strain rate so that the fluid viscosity depends only on temper ature which is assumed to be constant throughout this study in such cases pi 2 u 2 for pressure p and strain rate u u u t a non dimensionalisation of the navier stokes equations that re sult from substitution of the stress 2 into the cauchy momentum equation 1 a shows that the relative impor tance of viscous forces to inertial forces is given by the

10 4 m s 1 with typical fluid densities around o 103 kg m 3 and fluid viscosi ties of o 10 3 pa s or greater thus the reynolds number of the flows we will consider is no higher than re 10 2 1 which indicates that viscous forces domi nate over inertial forces thus for newtonian fluids an accurate representation of the fluid mechanics is given by the stokes flow equations 2 u p f 0 u 0 4 2 1 the fundamental singularity insight into biological flows generated by cilia and flag ella may be gained by considering the flows that arise due to concentrated driving forces consider an infinite fluid obeying the stokes flow equations 4 that is driven by a concentrated force per unit volume f f x y of magnitude and direction f where is the dirac delta distribution centered at y the velocity solution corre sponding to this fundamental singularity is given by ui x 1 8 ij r rirj r 3 fj y sij x y fj y 5 where ri xi yi for i 1 2 3 r 2 r 21 r 22 r 23 and sij x y is known as the stokeslet or oseen burgers tensor the einstein summation convention applies throughout the anisotropy of the stokeslet is an important factor affecting the fluid mechanics of cilia and flagella as illus trated in fig 3 the velocity of the flow due to a singular force at a distance r 1 from the force is twice as large at points in line with the force than at those points per pendicular to the force at the same distance as a first approximation the action of a slender cylinder moving through a fluid may be represented by a line distribu tion of singular driving forces as shown in fig 3 since the stokes flow equations 4 are linear the correspond ing velocity field is given by a sum of stokeslet solutions thus the drag on a slender body moving tangentially through the flow is approximately half that on an equiv alent body moving normally this two to one ratio first described in the resistive force theory of gray and hancock 18 is the basis for flagella and ciliary propulsive dynamics however drag anisotropy is not itself essential for very low reynolds number propulsion if the filaments are extensible as recently shown by pak lauga 19 f 1 u 1 r 1 0 0 f 1 4 r 1 u 1 0 r 2 r 3 f 1 8 r 1 r 1 r 1 u

swimmers in stokes flow move in such a way that no net forces 1 or torques 21 act upon them and flows driven by cilia protruding from epithelia can be modelled with image systems as discussed in sect 2 2 in both cases the 3 far fields of the flow are given by higher order singulari ties by taking derivatives of the stokeslet it is possible to derive the flow fields generated by higher order singular ities such as point stresses and point torques these are able to provide valuable insight into the far field behaviour of the fluid surrounding swimming cells and into the hy drodynamic effects arising from the inclusion of no slip boundaries in the flow 22 23 fig 4 shows the schematic representation of some of these singularities with each increase in the order of singularity the decay of the fluid velocity in the far field is increased by o 1 r so that stokeslets decay with o 1 r stokes dipoles decay with o 1 r 2 and stokes quadrupoles with o 1 r 3 an additional important singularity familiar as the source dipole of potential flow theory is given by dij x y 1 4 ij r 3 3 rirj r 5 6 this expression for the i component of a velocity field due to a source dipole oriented in the j direction together with zero pressure field is also a solution of the stokes flow equations and can be combined with the stokeslet to formulate solutions for translating spheres ellipsoids and slender rods the source dipole can alternatively be iden tified as the laplacian of the stokeslet in other words a particular form of the stokes quadrupole singularity models capture many of the essential fea tures of cilia and flagella driven flows fig 5 shows ex perimental data from recent studies by drescher et al 24 25 sperm bacteria and individual algae are too small for gravitational sedimentation to have a dominant effect on the flow field the zero total force condition therefore entails that the far field is given by a stresslet fig 5 a simulation modelling fig 6 predicts that the flow field around a sperm is approximated well by a stokes quadrupole given by drag components at the front and rear of the cell and a propulsive component in the middle sufficiently far from the cell the dominant singularity will however still be the stresslet the flow field closer to the cell is more complex for biflagellate algae the time averaged flow field due to two propulsive flagella and the cell body can be represented by a three stokeslet model 24 fig 5 b larger swimmers such as volvox carteri colonies are subject to a signif icant gravitational force evident as a stokeslet far

after calculation of the force distribution in the tail with slender body theory 4 derstood through the use of singularity diagrams to en force the zero velocity condition on the plane boundary that may for example represent the nodal floor an im age system of singularities is placed the other side of the boundary 22 the explicit form for the velocity field aris ing from a point force located at

and zero if j k the image location is given by r 1 r 1 r 2 r 2 and r 3 h the image systems for the two cases corresponding to a force orientated parallel and perpendicular to the bound ary are shown in fig 7 the far field arising from a stokeslet near a plane boundary is of higher order than the corresponding stokeslet in an infinite fluid being o 1 r 2 in the parallel case and o 1 r 3 for the perpendicular case the boundary therefore has the effect of shielding the fluid in the far field from the effect of the stokeslet it is this shielding effect illustrated in fig 8 that allows nodal cilia to generate directional fluid flow by tilting their axis of rotation in the posterior direction in mice 27 we will investigate the resultant fluid mechanics in more de tail in sect 3 figure 7

nodal cilium protruding from a cell surface dur ing a the effective stroke and b the recovery stroke the far field strength decays more rapidly than the inner and near fields due to the wall influence moreover dur ing the effective stroke the cilium is further from the cell surface than during the recovery stroke resulting in the near field having greater extent and propelling more fluid this effective recovery stroke asymmetry results in net fluid propulsion in the direction of the effective stroke for further detailed review of low reynolds number biofluiddynamics see dillon et al 29 lauga and powers 30 and gaffney et al 31 we now consider two prob lems which can be analysed using singularity approaches for the first newtonian symmetry breaking flow in the node we apply slender body theory and the method of regularised stokeslets to model the cilia and the node ge ometry respectively discussed in sect 3 for the second swimming in non newtonian fluids we use a recently de veloped hybrid of singularity methods with the finite ele ment method 13 which we have dubbed the method of femlets discussed in sect 4 3 nodal cilia embryonic nodal cilia were first discovered in the 1990 s and a series of experimental studies confirmed that cilia motility produced a fluid flow essential for the breaking of left right symmetry resulting in the normal asymmetric placement of the internal organs in vertebrates one of the most remarkable aspects of this work was the resolution of the long standing clinical question of how cilia dysfunc tion and situs inversus reversal of the internal body plan often appear together 32 33 in this section we review recent fluid mechanical models of this process before pre senting new results inspired by recent biological observa tions on the developmental progression of cilia placement and configuration 3 1 geometry of the embryonic mouse node vertebrate development requires the establishment of three body axes in order of appearance they are dorsal ventral anterior posterior and left right following a se ries of experimental studies it is now known that cilia motion converts the already established anterior posterior axis information with an intrinsic chirality 34 i e ro tational direction into left right asymmetric flow cilia perform a whirling clockwise motion viewed tip to base with axis of rotation tilted towards the posterior this model was first advanced by cartwright et al 35 with the fluid mechanics of cell surface interaction being dis cussed by brokaw 36 and analysed in more detail by smith et al 28 27 37 hashimoto et al 38 established that the posterior tilt is generated because the basal body of the cilium migrates towards the posterior side of the convex cell surface this process takes place in the ventral node shown in fig 2 in the most extensively studied species the mouse the node is an approximately triangular depression mea suring 50 100 m in width and 10 20 m in depth 32 forming on the ventral side of the embryo at 7 9 days post fertilisation dpf the node is covered with a membrane 5 and filled with extraembryonic fluid which we model as newtonian motivating an approach based on the stokes flow theory described in sect 2 the dorsal surface of the node is covered with a few hundred nodal pit cells that typically have one or two cilia protruding from them into the node each cilium is approximately 3 5 m in length and 0 3 m in diameter hashimoto et al 38 characterised morphological changes during the developmental process that primarily affect cilia numbers and positions which we summarise briefly at the late bud stage occurring at approximately 7 5 8 dpf for details of developmental stages see downs davies 39 cilia exhibit a distribution of tilt angle but no overall bias at a slightly later stage of develop ment early headfold also occurring in the period approx imately 7 5 8 dpf and subsequently late headfold at ap proximately 8 dpf cells exhibit a significant posterior bias and a significantly greater posterior bias in the peripheral regions relative to the centre in the later developmen tal stages known as 1 somite and 3 somite occurring at approximately 8 dpf posterior tilted cilia are extremely dominant during development cilia migrate towards the poste rior side of the nodal pit cell which results in an increase of tilt angle in the posterior direction these features will be modelled using different sets of cilia positions and pa rameters as observed by hashimoto et al 38 certain mutant embryos with dvl 1 dvl 2 dvl 3 genes knocked out do not exhibit cilia migration and consequently do not produce a directional fluid flow the experimental study of hashimoto et al provides information on in stantaneous slices of the two dimensional flow fields using microscopic particle imaging velocimetry and how this is altered by genetic knockouts a complementary technique to study the flow generation and the influence of cilia tilt is to formulate a mathematical model allowing the prediction of features which are not yet available exper imentally for example three dimensional particle tracks we will describe briefly a computation model of stokes flow generated by tilted rotating cilia published previously 28 and then apply the model to interpret the fluid me chanics of the changing developmental stages described by hashimoto et al 3 2 modelling the stages of development in the em bryonic mouse node we will represent the ciliated surface or nodal floor by the plane x 3 0 with cilia protruding into the region x 3 0 the x 1 axis will correspond to the left right axis with positive x 1 being towards the left and the x 2 axis will be the anterior posterior axis with negative x 2 being towards the posterior in this configuration posterior tilt corresponds to the negative x 2 direction each cilium is tilted towards the already established posterior direction by an angle and performs a conical rotation with semi cone angle and angular frequency the centreline at arclength s and time t is therefore given by 1 s t s sin cos t 8 a 2 s t s sin sin t cos cos sin 8 b 3 s t s sin sin t sin cos cos 8 c with the restriction 90 so that each cilium does not come into contact with the ciliated surface see fig 9 the slenderness ratio is defined as a l where a is the cilium radius and l is the cilium length for nodal cilia is approximately 0 1 the relative slenderness of the cilium indicates that slender body theory can be used to represent both the near and far field flows accurately however it is also necessary to take into account both the no slip condition on the plane boundary representing the ciliated surface and the membrane that encloses the node known as reichert s membrane figure 9

the no slip condition on the plane boundary is sat isfied through the stokeslet and image system given in eq 7 the no slip condition on the cilium is satisfied by a stokeslet and quadratically

formly including towards the cilium ends and for all we combine a centreline distribution of stokeslets with a quadratically weighted distribution of source dipoles 40 the flow due to a single cilium

distribution an image system is not required for the source dipole because the additional terms needed to satisfy the no slip condition decay rapidly an expression for the source dipole image system can also be derived 41 the source dipole dis tribution originally derived by chwang wu 42 in the context of exact solutions to stokes flow and later found asymptotically by johnson 40 takes the form

membrane surface s to obtain a regular flow field throughout domains con taining singularity distributions cortez 43 developed the method of regularised stokeslets a regularised stokeslet is defined

for further details see refer ences 28 43 44 45 46 an advantage of a regularised stokeslet formulation in this context is that the velocity 7 field near to and on the surface s is regular and can be

on each cilium and the surface mesh and using a boundary element constant force discretisation for full details of the numerical implementation see refs 28 46 once the stress and force per unit length distributions are known it is then possible to calculate the fluid velocity from eq 16 knowledge of the velocity field then enables sim ulation of particle transport 3 3 configurations of cilia during development since computational expense grows approximately with the cube of the number of cilia we model the node with a smaller number of cilia than are observed experimentally however the underlying characteristics of the problem such as tilt direction and the geometry of the problem domain will be preserved building on the work of smith et al 28 we will fo cus on the stages of development where the fluid flow ap pears to change from vortical to directional the stages considered are the late bud early headfold late headfold 1 somite and 3 somite for the late bud stage 17 cilia were distributed in the centre of the node with tilt an gles in the range 10 10 a negative tilt angle denotes an anterior tilt and 7 17 cilia were tilted in the anterior direction the early headfold stage is modelled with 21 cilia with tilt angles in the range 10 15 with 3 21 cilia tilted in the anterior direction the late headfold stage is modelled with 25 cilia with tilt angles in the range 5 20 with only 1 25 cilia tilted in the anterior direction the 1 somite stage is modelled with 28 cilia with tilt angles in the range 20 35 and the 3 somite stage is modelled with 28 cilia with tilt angles in the range 35 45 thus we model the increased numbers of cilia and increases in posterior tilt occurring with each advance with developmental stage consistent with the experimental observations of approximately 150 cilia at the late bud stage and approximately 380 cilia at the 3 somite stage 3 4 particle transport results presented in this section will adopt the convention of the left of the node on the right of the figure with the following set of scalings length is normalised with respect to cilium length which is typically 3 5 m for the mouse time is scaled with respect to a beat period 2 where is the angular frequency and velocities are then scaled according to these length and time scalings figs 11 12 and 13 show the results of particle tracking simulations in these simulations one beat cycle takes 60 timesteps and the tracking simulations were run for 20 000 timesteps or approximately 333 beat cycles corresponding to 30 seconds of cilium rotation at 10 hz initial particle positions are shown with an arrow particles released in the late bud and early headfold stages of development are swept around the node in a clockwise vortex when viewed from the ventral side figs 11 12 this is because each cilium has a low tilt angle thereby generating a local vortex these local vortices combine to form a larger global vortex particle paths in the late headfold stage vary with po sition in the node a particle released in the right of the node at initial height x 3 1 1 is advected initially to the right and then to the left by neighbouring cilia fig 11 a particle with initial height x 3 0 5 fig 12 is advected in a vortical flow around the entire node all particles released in the 1 somite and 3 somite stages are advected leftward by a succession of cilia figs 11 12 once the paths reach the edge of the cilia array at the left of the node they return via a rightward path close to the covering membrane a leftward particle path is observed because all cilia are tilted towards the posterior at the 1 somite stage of development the behaviour of particles released above the cilia tips in the left region of the node is shown in fig 13 at all stages of development the particle path shows the expected return flow characteristics of each stage the change from a global vortex to a directional flow effectively breaks the symmetry of the left right axis this is because particles may be moved towards the left by a succession of posteriorly tilted cilia as opposed to being carried in a global vortex around the node by untilted cilia the mechanism for how this flow is converted to asymmetric gene expression is still under active investiga tion 4 swimming in non newtonian fluids for a wide class of problems for instance internal

decreases with fluid shear a swimmer in shear thinning fluid cre ates an envelope of thinned fluid around itself which has a non trivial effect on its locomotion 13 the dynamics of polymer suspensions

strain rate viscosity 0 and an infinite strain rate viscosity the material constant is a measure of the polymer chain relaxation time using the scalings u lu x lx t 2 t f lf and p p where is the angular beat frequency and l is a characteristic length for instance the length of the flagellum the dimensionless momentum equation governing the carreau fluid is 1 0 1 1 2 n 1 2 u p f 0 19 for fixed beat kinematics the trajectory is thus depen dent upon three dimensionless quantities the ratio 0 of the zero to infinite shear rate viscosities the product of the characteristic relaxation time of the fluid with the angular beat frequency known as the deborah number de and the power law index n 4 2 modelling non newtonian swimming with femlets we use the method of femlets described in montenegro johnson et al 13 to model viscous swimming in a generalised newtonian fluid the method of regularised stokeslets and the method of femlets represent the in teraction of the swimmer with the fluid through a set of concentrated blob forces of unknown strength and direc tion while the method of regularised stokeslets reduces the problem to finding the coefficients in a linear superpo sition of velocity solutions of known form the method of femlets proceeds by applying the finite element method to solve simultaneously the fluid velocity field and the strength and direction of the forces the use of the fi nite element method removes the need for the governing equations to be linear henceforth we will continue to use dimensionless variables but doff hats for conciseness let d be a bounded domain in rd where in our case d 2 we partition the domain boundary d ddir dneu into those portions on which dirichlet and neumann type boundary conditions are applied respectively the sur face of the swimmer dswim ddir forms a part of the dirichlet boundary however we will model the interac tion of dswim with the fluid by an immersed body force distribution thus for our case dswim is not a domain boundary but rather a manifold containing points within the domain let h 1 d be the standard sobolev space of weakly differentiable functions 52 defined on d and ve w h 1 d d w ddir udir

for problem 22 was shown by baranger et al 54 for both the power law and carreau models the finite element discretisation used herein is discussed by barrett et al 55 we consider swimmers in truncated channels of the form shown in fig 14 the no slip condition u 0 is applied on the the channel walls ddir and on the bound aries where the domain has been truncated dneu we ap ply the open boundary condition 23 the results we will present were obtained in a channel of height 5 and length 11 with lengths normalised to a characteristic length for the swimmer as the swimmer moves through the fluid the mov ing boundary exerts a force distribution on the fluid that drives the flow we incorporate this interaction through the unknown body force f which is governed by the mo tion of the swimmer we approximate f by a finite num ber of smooth immersed forces of unknown strength and direction femlets f nf k 1 g x xk fk 24 for nf femlets of strength fk located at xk the cut off function g x xk is a regularisation function similar to that used in the method of regularised stokeslets 43 associated with each femlet are k degrees of freedom where k is the dimensionality of the problem domain for example a swimmer in two dimensions would have the lab frame force of each femlet in the x and y directions f 1 f 2 as unknowns resulting in 2 nf additional scalar variables to calculate the 2 nf force unknowns we enforce 2 nf constraints in the form of dirichlet velocity conditions us these are given by the swimmer s velocity in the body frame in which the swimmer neither rotates nor translates and applied at the location of each femlet the relationship between the body frame and the lab frame is shown in fig 15 the body frame velocity ub is related to the lab frame velocity u solved for in problem 22 by ub u u x x 0 25 where u are the translational and angular velocities of the swimmer respectively and x 0 is a fixed point on the swimmer the translational and angular

viscous swim mer was proposed by najafi and golestanian 14 it is highly instructive to compare the physics of this swimmer to more detailed models of cells equipped with cilia and flagella the najafi golestanian swimmer comprises two outer spheres which move relative to a central sphere with a non reciprocal motion the mechanism underlying the original najafi golestanian swimmer is as follows one of the outer spheres will move at any given time by force balance leftward relative motion of an outer sphere results in right ward motion of the remaining spheres through the fluid and vice versa the distance that the remaining spheres move in the fluid depends on the drag of the remaining two spheres relative leftward motion of an outer sphere occurs while the other spheres are far apart relative right ward motion of an outer sphere occurs while the other spheres are close together hydrodynamic interaction re 12 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 relative position ti m e figure 16 the position of the two outer swimming spheres modelled by femlets moving relative to the cen tral sphere for 1 4 over the course of a beat cycle sults in the drag of the other spheres being reduced when they are close together therefore the drag of the remain ing spheres is less during relative rightward motion of the active sphere and so the beat cycle is slightly more ef fective in moving the swimmer to the left than the right our variant of this swimmer follows the suggestion in the original paper of najafi golestanian 14 of making the sphere motion smooth in time we model this swimmer by three collinear femlets the outer femlets move as harmonic oscillators relative to the central femlet and symmetry is broken by enforcing a phase difference between them x 1 d sin t x 2 0 x 3 d sin t 30 where d is a constant displacement the locus of this motion is shown over a beat cycle in fig 16 due to the symmetry of the problem domain and beat pattern in the line y 0 the swimmer will move in the x direction fig 17 shows the progress of this swimmer in stokes flow for 1 4 so that our example swims in the negative x direction here we normalise length scales such that 2 d 1 we will now examine the effects of beat phase as well as the carreau rheological parameters on swimming speed for the set of rheological parameters viscosity ratio 0 2 deborah number 1 and power law index n 1 2 we first examine the effect of changing the phase difference fig 18 shows the progress of the swimmer as a function of revealing a maximum when 1 4 for both carreau and stokes flow this

difference due to the dependence of the fluid stress on its deformation history for this set of fluid parameters the mean benefit to progress is 3 with a standard de viation of 0 5 the zero progress solutions at 0 1 2 correspond to the cases where the swimming spheres are in phase and antiphase respectively since the maximum progress is achieved for 1 4 we fix this variable for the remainder of the study we now wish to examine the effects of decreasing the power law index n for n 1 the carreau equations reduce to the stokes flow equations decreasing n leads to a sharper decrease in the effective viscosity for lower strain rates for 1 and 0 2 progress of the swimmer over a beat cycle as a function of n is displayed in fig 19 showing that as n decreases magnitude of progress per beat increases by fixing 1 and n 1 2 we examine the effects of varying the viscosity ratio 0 fig 20 displays the progress of the swimmer over a beat cycle as a function of this ratio which shows that as the infinite shear rate viscosity decreases magnitude of progress increases finally we consider the effect of altering the deborah number de this is especially important since for a given fluid the power law index and viscosity ratio are fixed physical parameters however de is a function of beat frequency which for artificial swimmers may be con 13 trolled and therefore optimised much like the phase dif ference for 0 2 and n 1 progress over a beat cycle is displayed as a function of de in fig 21 which shows that for this particular model swimmer optimum progress is achieved for 0 8 so that

grows in peak curvature towards the distal portion of the tail 57 to model this waveform we prescribe a body frame tangent angle of the form s t cs cos ks t 31 for s the arclength along the flagellum

s 0 cos ds 33 b this parameterisation of the flagellum is given in the body frame 58 in which the cell body neither rotates nor translates the translational and rotational velocities that arise from this instantaneous configuration are then used to update the position of the swimmer in the lab frame so that the cell swims through the fluid domain the trajectory of the swimmer is calculated by inte grating the swimming velocity u with the adams bashforth multistep method 59 60 which interpolates an nth order polynomial through the current and previous n 1 values of translational and angular velocity to give the position for a two dimensional sperm like swimmer in a channel of newtonian fluid with less than a 0 3 change in the position of the swimmer after a single beat cycle between 25 steps per beat with the second order scheme and 80 steps with the third order scheme as such we use the second order scheme with 25 steps per beat we nor malise length scales to the flagellum length so that one length unit corresponds to 55 m and time scales to the period of the beat thus modelling a tail beating at 10 hz would mean that one time unit corresponds to 1 10 s fig 23 shows the sperm s progress as a function of deborah number for 0 2 and n 1 2 note the qualitative similarity to fig 21 with overall progression initially increasing with de to a maximum value around de 0 8 then decreasing at a slower rate since the najafi golestanian swimmer comprises three forces in bal ance its representation by a stokes quadrupole might shed insight into this link motivated by the observations in fig 6 these results also draw an interesting parallel with the analysis of teran et al 50 who used the immersed boundary method to show that the progression of a wav ing filament may be enhanced in a viscoelastic oldroyd b fluid at deborah numbers close to 1 if the viscosity ratio 0 is less than 1 then the effective viscosity 18 of a carreau fluid increases with shear rate for such a model the relaxation time no longer has a physical interpretation in terms of polymer 15 physics but the carreau law may still be used as a reg ularisation of a shear thickening power law fluid exam ples of shear thickening fluids are custard and a mixture of cornstarch with water known colloquially as oobleck fig 24 shows the progress of the sperm over a sin gle beat cycle as a function of the viscosity ratio 0 stokes flow corresponding to 0 1 is marked in or ange and the thickening and thinning re gimes lie to its left and right respectively we see that whilst shear thinning aids progress shear thickening inhibits it furthermore fig 24 shows an almost perfect linear relationship between progress and the logarithm of 0 for shear thinning fluids there is a gradient of thick to thin fluid from the proximal to distal portions of the flag ellum for shear thickening fluids the gradient runs from thin to thick thus the disadvantage to cell progress in a shear thickening fluid is consistent with the hypothesis of montenegro johnson et al 13 that differential viscosity between the distal and proximal portions of the flagellum is responsible for changes in propulsive efficiency

makes the method of singular solutions possible this approach pro vides significant insight into the basic nature of the physics of propulsion and swimming microscopic swimmers for which gravitational and inertial forces are negligible are subject to zero total force and torque entailing that the far field of a flagellated swimmer is stresslet in nature the flow velocity having inverse square decay however within a distance of a few cell radii or flagella lengths the flow field can be markedly different from a stresslet being closer to a stokes quadrupole for sperm and a stresslet source dipole combination for single celled algae these findings are confirmed both experimentally and through more detailed computational models the action of grav ity on larger swimmers results in a more slowly decaying o 1 r stokeslet flow the lack of explicit time dependence in the stokes flow equations entails that time irreversible motion is essential for successful swimming and pumping cilia and flag ella achieve this through a number of mechanisms the anisotropy of the stokeslet results in the anisotropic drag law for slender bodies a property which underlies the propulsive effect of travelling bending waves finally wall interaction which can be understood by the method of images is essential to the function of cilia image systems convert both forces and torques to higher order singu larities in the far field a mechanism which explains how rotating embryonic nodal cilia create a right to left flow 5 2 cilia in embryonic development the hybrid computational technique combining slender body theory with the regularised stokeslet boundary el ement method allows prediction of both generic features of cilia driven flow in the nodal cavity as shown previ ously 28 our simulations show the effect of develop mental changes in cilia orientation and position using ex perimental data on cilia numbers and orientation 38 in early stages of development late bud early headfold the flow is essentially vortical whereas in later stages when the majority of cilia are tilted posteriorly late headfold 1 somite and 3 somite an asymmetric directional flow is established that breaks the symmetry of the left right axis qualitative agreement with particle imaging velocime try observations 38 suggest that this approach will be useful for analysing this and related systems in more de tail providing further physical insight into the coupling of nodal flow to subsequent morphogenesis 32 61 5 3 swimming in non newtonian fluids the najafi golestanian swimmer is able to progress be cause of hydrodynamic interaction of spheres coupled with time irreversible motion whereas sperm propel through propagating bending waves of a slender flagellum how ever the effect of shear thinning rheology on both cells is qualitatively similar both models swim faster in a shear thinning fluid with an optimal value for deborah number between 0 5 and 1 however sperm enjoy a greater propul sive advantage relative to the newtonian state compared with the three sphere swimmer their increase being up to around 20 compared with around 3 in the region of pa rameter space investigated for sperm shear thickening fluid rheology led to a decrease in cell progress it was found that cell progress had an almost exact logarithmic dependence on the viscosity ratio 0 it should be noted however that the fluid strain rate of a carreau fluid is independent of its recent deformation history and so to fully capture the behaviour of human mucus an ex tended model is desirable 5 4 summary the examples in this paper illustrate aspects of the broad range of very low reynolds number flow the embry onic nodal flow is typically considered newtonian and entails the wall effect converting rotation to directional flow which in turn converts chiral to lateral information the swimming cell problems illustrate the importance of more complex non newtonian effects typical of biological fluids such as blood and mucus and the qualitative in sights that can be gained from conceptual models reproduction and development continue to be inspira tional topics in the biological fluid mechanics of active matter future work will focus on among other topics the nonlinear interaction of multiple ciliated and flagel lated cells with biological fluids and with each other we anticipate that the techniques
