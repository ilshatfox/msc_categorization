online 13 april 2012 abstract fluid mechanics plays a vital role in early vertebrate embryo development an exam ple being the establishment of left right asymmetry following the dorsal ventral and anterior posterior axes the left right axis is the last to be established in several species it has been shown that an important process involved with this is the production of a left right asymmetric flow driven by whirling cilia it has previously been established in experimental and mathematical models of the mouse ventral node that the combina tion of a consistent rotational direction and posterior tilt creates left right asymmetric flow the zebrafish organising structure kupffer s vesicle has a more complex internal arrangement of cilia than the mouse ventral node experimental studies show the flow exhibits an anticlockwise rotational motion when viewing the embryo from the dorsal roof looking in the ventral direction reports of the arrangement and configuration of cilia suggest two possible mechanisms for the generation of this flow from existing axis information 1 posterior tilt combined with increased cilia density on the dorsal roof and 2 dorsal tilt of equatorial cilia we develop a mathematical model of symmetry breaking cilia driven flow in kupffer s vesicle using the regularized stokeslet boundary element method computations of the flow produced by tilted whirling cilia in an en closed domain suggest that a possible mechanism capable of producing the flow field with qualitative and quantitative features closest to those observed experimentally is a combination of posteriorly tilted roof and floor cilia and dorsally tilted equatorial cilia 1 introduction vertebrates from the outside appear bilaterally symmetric however in many species internal body plans are arranged asymmetrically in an organised way for example the heart can usually be found on the left in mice zebrafish iban es belmonte 2009 and humans figures 1 a as with convention the left of the

establishment of left right asymmetry have begun to be understood kartagener 1933 amongst others identified a triad of conditions that included respiratory problems male infertility and situs inversus the lateral transposition of internal organs figure 1 b for a detailed historical review see also berdon willi 2004 and berdon et al 2004 in 1974 afzelius performed electron microscopy on the sperm of four infertile men the flagella which were immotile did not possess the dynein motor protein three of the four men did not have normally functioning lung cilia moreover three of the four men were reported to have situs inversus from this evidence afzelius hypothesised that visceral asymmetry is determined through the movements of cilia of some embryonic epithelial tissues afzelius 1976 twenty years later sulik et al 1994 discovered a node structure on a mouse embryo at 7 9 days post fertilisation that expressed primary cilia cilia are microscopic hair like organelles with an internal arrangement of nine pairs of microtubules arranged in a cylindrical structure motile 9 2 cilia similar to the flagella of sperm possess a central microtubule pair and perform essential biological functions such as mucus clearance in the lung and transport of the ovum in the fallopian tube primary cilia by contrast are generally shorter do not possess a central microtubule pair and prior to the work of sulik et al were generally thought to be immotile however sulik et al reported that the primary cilia in the mouse node were motile and furthermore postulated that their motility may be associated with the establishment of sidedness thereby providing the link between situs inversus and ciliary dysfunction in the node nonaka et al 1998 then confirmed that primary cilia in the mouse node were indeed motile and in normal mice performed a clockwise rotation when viewed from tip to base which propels fluid nonaka et al showed that knockout mice with absent cilia do not break symmetry normally and then do not survive gestation nonaka et al 2002 subsequently showed that a leftward fluid flow was both necessary and sufficient for normal organ situs by placing embryos in artificial flow conditions showing that a rightward flow resulted in situs inversus however at the time of nonaka et al s work it was still unclear as to how a whirling motion could be sufficient to create a directional fluid flow a resolution to this question was first proposed by cartwright et al 2004 repre senting cilia by point torque rotlet singularities in an infinite domain cartwright et al showed how a clockwise rotation can generate a leftward fluid flow if the axis of rotation is tilted towards the already established posterior direction this theoretical prediction was verified soon after in biological observations okada et al 2005 and a mechanical experimental model nonaka et al 2005 moreover cartwright et al s theoretical pre diction that the tilt angle would be approximately 24 was close to the mean value of 26 6 reported by nonaka et al brokaw 2005 used a computational model to show how internal chirality of dynein regulation and internal twist are possible mechanisms that may create the whirling motion of cilia furthermore brokaw gave the first discussion of cilia driven flow in zebrafish 3 the effect of surface drag in the context of tilted rotational cilia motion and its effect in generating a leftward flow smith et al 2007 used a computational approach to slender body theory for stokes flow to address the roles of cilium surface interactions and unsteadiness in the flow field via image systems in a plane boundary blake 1971 evidence of limited chaotic advec tion was found and later verified experimentally supatto et al 2008 supatto vermot 2011 smith et al 2008 also investigated the optimal tilt angle for maximum fluid propulsion by tilted rotational motion and furthermore modelled particle drift under the action of arrays of tilted whirling cilia results were found to lie within the bounds reported from experimental observations okada et al 2005 nonaka et al 2005 and also the mechanical analogue model of nonaka et al 2005 addressing the issue that the developing node has an enclosing upper membrane cartwright et al 2007 com puted flow profiles using a steady flow finite element model it was predicted that there would exist two layers of rightward return flow in the upper region away from the cilia caused by conservation of mass in the volume and also very close to the ciliated surface the latter caused by the return stroke of the cilia to investigate the influence of the enclosed fluid domain in the context of a time dependent model smith et al 2011 used the regularized stokeslet boundary element method combined with slender body theory the time dependent model predicted that the leftward particle drift would occur throughout most of the ciliated layer including very close to the ciliated surface it was also found that the main directional flow only extended as far as the cilia array an important question is how a directional flow is translated into asymmetric devel opment two main models have been proposed one that the flow transports morphogen proteins to the left of the node the other is that there are also immotile cilia in organising structures that are there to sense the flow produced by the motile cilia these theories are reviewed and discussed by hirokawa et al 2009 a detailed understanding of the flow transport of particles and hydrodynamic stresses produced by whirling cilia will be essential to understand this mechanism 2 geometry of organising structures many theoretical cartwright et al 2004 2007 smith et al 2007 2008 2011 and early experimental nonaka et al 1998 2002 2005 okada et al 2005 tanaka et al 2005 studies have been conducted based on the geometry of the mouse node this is because the mouse was one of the first species found to have cilia in its organising structure see also reviews by cartwright et al 2008 2009 hirokawa et al 2009 for full details the mouse node is a triangular depression measuring 50 100 m in width and 10 20 m in depth that forms on the ventral surface of the embryo the mouse node is covered with a membrane which is frequently removed for imaging purposes and is filled with fluid primary cilia measuring 3 5 m are expressed on the surface forming the base of the mouse node and they exhibit tilted clockwise rotations as described in the previous section in recent years experimentalists have turned attention to imaging the organising struc ture of the zebrafish figure 1 d e termed kupffer s vesicle kv kawakami et al 2005 kreiling et al 2007 okabe et al 2008 supatto et al 2008 zebrafish kv is transparent supatto vermot 2011 meaning that internal structures can be imaged without re moving any surfaces another distinct advantage of using kv to investigate development is that it is visible at approximately 12 hours post fertilisation kimmel et al 1995 zebrafish kv is a closed spheroidal structure measuring approximately 70 m 4 a a smith t d johnson et al figure 2 schematic of the zebrafish kupffer s vesicle

zucker et al 2005 expressed on the internal surfaces figure 2 kreiling et al 2007 supatto et al 2008 it is agreed that the cilia in kv are tilted and rotate however there is not a consensus as to the tilt direction kreiling et al 2007 report that the roof and floor cilia are posteriorly tilted supatto et al 2008 report dorsally tilted side wall cilia both kreiling et al and supatto et al describe the same flow field a circulation about the dorsal ventral axis figure 3 supatto vermot 2011 suggest that dorsal tilt is necessary to create the observed flow field moreover supatto vermot 2011 report the directional flow magnitude in the region up to approximately 20 m above the cell surface as being in a range of approximately 6 13 m s this theoretical study is designed to investigate the flow in kv generated by these models 1 all posteriorly tilted cilia 2 all dorsally tilted cilia and 3 a hybrid of posteriorly and dorsally tilted cilia depending on position on the internal surface of kv furthermore we shall investigate the effect of the more densely ciliated anterior dorsal roof as also observed in experiment in the next section we shall describe the mathematical theory behind our model starting with a description of the physics of a cilium beat cycle we then formulate the regularized cilia driven flow in zebrafish 5 stokeslet boundary integral equation because it is highly suited to modelling complex geometric problems we will also describe our method of meshing the interior domain and cilia of kv and then solve the regularized stokeslet boundary integral equation numerically 3 fluid mechanics modelling the basic fluid mechanical mechanisms underlying how tilted cilia performing a whirling motion create a directional flow the nodal flow have been discussed extensively elsewhere smith et al 2007 2008 2011 based on the theory of blake 1971 and blake chwang 1974 we briefly recapitulate these ideas before describing the computational boundary integral model of kv 3 1 stokes flow driven by cilia due to the small length scales and velocities l 3 m l 2 25 3 m s the reynolds number of flow near a whirling cilium is approximately 10 3 an early hypothesis regarding the generation of the nodal flow was based on the speed difference between the leftward and rightward strokes it was known that a cilium moves more rapidly during the leftward upright portion of the stroke than during the rightward part where the cilium moves close to the surface the greater speed of the leftward stroke was hypothesised to produce a greater flow this observation likely originated from intuitions regarding inertia dominated high reynolds number flow however these intuitions are not accurate in the very low reynolds number viscous dominated regime of cilia driven flow very low reynolds number flows essentially respond instantaneously to boundary conditions driving the flow if the driving velocity is changed the flow changes proportionately if there are no other physical effects present the lower velocity associated with the slower rightward movement is balanced by the fact that the rightward movement occurs for a longer period of time the physical effect producing asymmetric flow is wall interaction walls have very significant effects in stokes flow notably converting the o 1 r decay of a concentrated force to an o 1 r 2 decay blake 1971 the cilium moves very close to the cell surface during the rightward recovery stroke but is fairly upright during the leftward effective stroke as a result the amount of flow in the surrounding fluid produced by the rightward stroke is much smaller than that produced by the leftward stroke the effect of the cell surface is to reduce the influence of the moving cilium on the bulk of the fluid this effect is much stronger during the rightward than leftward strokes the image systems associated with forces acting near walls in stokes flow give further insight into the nature of the flow field blake chwang 1974 smith et al 2007 the fundamental solution of stokes flow is the stokeslet defined as the solution of the stokes flow equations driven by a point force for a force per unit volume f located at y the stokes flow equations are p 2 u f x y u 0 3 1 where p is pressure u is velocity and is dynamic viscosity the solution is given by ui fjsij with summation convention where the second rank tensor sij is given by sij x y 1 8 ij r rirj r 3 3 2 where ri xi yi and r 2 r 21 r 22 r 23 see for example pozrikidis 1992 smith et al 2007 2008 2011 used slender body theory to model the cilia

light blue posterior region has the lowest with percentages taken from kreiling et al 2007 the cell structure indicates the boundaries of the voronoi cells around each cilium b experimentally observed distribution of cilia in kupffer s vesicle reconstructed from confocal microscopy kreiling et al 2007 the image is a two dimensional view of a three dimensional rendering of the reconstructed cilia a m p denote the anterior middle and posterior regions in the mouse node which is based on the use of a line distribution of stokeslets and appropriately weighted source dipoles the ciliated surface was modelled using the plane boundary image systems of blake 1971 the upper membrane of the mouse node was taken into account smith et al 2011 using regularized stokeslets combined with the image system of ainley et al 2008 in this study we wish to account for the curvature of the inner surface of kv and the relatively low slenderness ratio of 1 10 of the cilia we shall use the regularized stokeslet boundary element method and shall use a surface mesh of the internal cavity and the cilia themselves cortez 2001 introduced the regularized stokeslet this is defined as the exact solution to the stokes flow equations with smoothed point forces p 2 u f x y u 0 3 3 the symbol x y denotes a cutoff function or blob with regularisation parameter satisfying r 3 x dvx 1 cortez et al 2005 showed that for the blob x y 15 4 8 r 7 the regularized stokeslet velocity tensor is given by s ij x y ij r 2 2 2 rirj r 3 where r 2 r 2 2 3 4 cortez et al 2005 also showed that the resulting regularized stokeslet boundary integral equation for flow bounded by a surface d is uj y d s ij x y fi x ui x t ijk x y nk x dsx o 2 3 5 for a point y in the fluid and where nk x is a unit surface normal pointing into the fluid the single layer density fi x has dimensions of stress so that fi x dsx has dimensions of force in contrast with the localised force per unit volume f of equation 3 1 the symbol t ijk x y is the stress tensor corresponding to the regularized stokeslet since our flow domain will consist almost exclusively of rigid surfaces we neglect the double layer potential arising from t ijk x y the single layer potential arising from s ij x y is continuous as y approaches the surface hence we have the approximation uj y d s ij x y fi x dsx o 2 for y d 3 6 3 2 mesh generation and geometric modelling as depicted in figure 4 a the geometry of kv is approximated as the scalene ellipsoidal surface given by x 21 352 x 22 302 x 23 152 1 3 7 where one length unit corresponds to 1 m we model a vesicle with 70 cilia one per cell which is within the observed range of 73 6 5 9 cilia reported by kreiling et al 2007 for 13 hours post fertilisation we wish to test the effect of the experimentally observed distribution of cilia coupled cilia driven flow in zebrafish 7 figure 5 a section of the dorsal roof showing the delaunay triangulation of the surface the positions of the cilia and the cell boundaries created by linking the circumcentres of triangles which share vertices figure 6 cell and hence cilia density on a dorsal and b ventral surfaces colouring indicates cell surface area based on figure 4 this cell placement was used to generate the results shown in figure 11 with cilium tilt on the production of flow inside kv to achieve this we first generate a cell grid that defines the positions of cilia and the boundaries of each cell by creating a delaunay surface triangulation using distmesh persson strang 2004 and custom matlab r routines a triangulation of a set of points is said to have the delaunay property if the circumcircle of each triangle contains no other points okabe et al 1992 a cilium is located at the vertex of each triangle figure 5 so that a triangulation of approximately uniform size yields an even distribution of cilia whereas a varying triangle size creates a distribution closer to that reported experimentally by kreiling et al 2007 and shown in figure 4 b the distribution used is shown in figure 6 the boundaries of each ciliated cell are given by linking the circumcentres of all trian gles that share a given vertex and projecting onto the curved surface defined by equation 3 7 using the matlab r routine fsolve this is an approximation of the intersection of the voronoi diagram see also okabe et al 1992 of the set of cilium positions with the ellipsoidal surface as shown in figure 4 a the cilium itself comprises a cylindrical section with diameter 0 3 m and length 3 m and a hemispherical cap the cilia move through an approximately conical envelope with a semi cone angle 8 a a smith t d johnson et al figure 7 geometry of the cilium beat a the shape of the cilium centreline about its rota tional axis b the final mesh of each cilium

2 t 0 0 0 1 0 s 0 sin s ds s 0 cos s ds 3 8 where s is the arclength along the centreline and a tanh bs the angle that the tip of the cilium makes with the vertical is given by a 35 and the parameter b 5 places the characteristic bend in the base of the cilium shown in figure 7 a the cilium is attached to the cell smoothly via a fixed base that provides the tilt figure 7 b we consider three separate tilt distributions firstly a purely posterior tilt 45 kramer zucker et al 2005 secondly a purely dorsal tilt of 30 supatto et al 2008 and finally a hybrid model posterior tilt in our model refers specifically to tilt towards the posterior pole of the vesicle likewise dorsal tilt refers to tilt towards the dorsal pole the hybrid model consists of a continuous transition from dorsal tilt close to the equator x 3 0 to posterior tilt on the dorsal roof and ventral floor figure 8 formalised mathematically as the hairy ball theorem attempting to specify a con stant magnitude direction vector over the entire surface of the ellipsoid inevitably results in a point of discontinuity for this reason we prescribe the tilt angle to reduce smoothly to zero at the poles where this occurs therefore we have zero tilt at the posterior pole in the posterior tilt model figure 9 indicated with a red circle and zero tilt at the dorsal pole in the dorsal tilt model 3 3 numerical implementation the mathematical problem to be solved is the determination of the unknown stress fi y for y d from the prescribed surface velocity uj y this is achieved by discretising the stress and applying collocation the stress is discretised as taking piecewise constant values fi 1 fi n on surface elements d 1 d n where d d 1 d n is the surface mesh and n is the number of mesh elements the discrete form of equation cilia driven flow in zebrafish 9 figure 8 the anterior half of the dorsal roof for one of the meshes used in the computational simulations the cilium density pattern is chosen to approximate the experimental observations of kreiling et al 2007 as shown in figures 4 and 6 the point at the top of the figure from which red arrows emanate is the anterior pole arrows therefore point in the posterior direction the point at the bottom of the figure on which blue arrows converge is the dorsal pole arrows therefore point in the dorsal direction this mesh was generated with equatorial cilia shaded blue tilted in the dorsal direction and dorsal roof cilia shaded red tilted in the posterior direction later this configuration will be referred to as mixed tilt results for this mesh are shown later in figures 11 g h and i 3 6 is then given by uj y n n 1 fi n d n s ij x y dsx where y d m 3 9 taking y as the centroid of element d m while allowing m to range over 1 n and j 1 2 3 we then have 3 n equations for 3 n unknown scalar stress variables the numerical solution is carried out as described in the appendix once the discrete approximations fi n are calculated the velocity field at any position in the domain can be found by reapplying equation 3 9 this boundary element implementation of the regularized stokeslet method with the variable fi x being discretised separately from the numerical quadrature used to evaluate the regularized stokeslet integrals was shown by smith 2009 to give significant advantages in efficiency an important requirement for solving problems with complex geometry note that the calculation described above applies to a specific instant in time time dependence was kept implicit in the explanation in order to calculate the time averaged flow over a full beat cycle as in the results reported in section 4 the calculation must be repeated for a sequence of nt timesteps t 0 t nt t nt 1 over the beat period t the flow field for each timestep being stored and then averaged 4 results for comparison with the experimental results of supatto et al 2008 shown in figure 3 we shall examine flow in a centrally located anterior posterior left right ap lr plane 10 a a smith t d johnson et al figure 9 an example hybrid quadratic mesh of kupffer s vesicle showing non uniform distri bution of cilia all tilted towards the posterior corresponding to figure 11 a b and c a section has been cut away for internal viewing and comparison with figure 2 the posterior pole at which we prescribe the tilt angle as zero is indicated with a red circle see text for details x 1 x 2 plane in our model at x 3 0 results will be shown viewed from the dorsal side looking in the ventral direction additionally we will compute flow in transverse x 2 0 sections we are not aware of comparable experimental data for zebrafish kv but the results may serve as experimentally testable predictions and also may be compared to known flow patterns in the different but related system of medakafish kv there are a number of aspects of the flow that could be examined including the oscil latory component of the flow and the advection of particles by the time dependent flow in the present study we shall restrict our reports to the time average of the instantaneous flow computed by the model over 60 discrete intervals of the cilia beat cycle profiles will only be reported in the bulk of the fluid we examine how the flow field differs between models with 1 all cilia tilted towards the posterior pole kramer zucker et al 2005 okabe et al 2008 2 all cilia tilted towards the dorsal pole supatto et al 2008 3 mixed tilt directions as described in section 3 2 in each case we compare flow with i a spatially homogeneous cilia distribution and ii a spatially varying cilia distribution with maximum density at the anterior of the dorsal roof kreiling et al 2007 4 1 all cilia tilted posteriorly for homogeneous cilia density with posterior tilt only there is no evidence of an overall clockwise flow figure 10 a the beat direction is clockwise viewed from tip to base however the cell surfaces of the dorsal roof and ventral floor face in opposite directions hence dorsal roof and ventral floor cilia perform opposite motions because cilia density is equal on both surfaces the overall effect is a nearly zero flow in the ap lr midplane a posterior tilt makes no difference to this flow components in the ap lr midplane are still equal and opposite as in all results shown the largest magnitude flow occurs close to the walls of the vesicle since this is where the cilia are located by comparison inhomogeneous cilia density does produce an overall anticlockwise cilia driven flow in zebrafish 11 flow viewed from dorsal figure 11 a because the opposing rotation directions are no longer equal the flow produced by the dorsal roof cilia rotating clockwise when viewed from dorsal base to tip predominates over that produced by the ventral floor cilia the magnitude of the flow is however generally significantly less than the typical 10 m s reported by supatto vermot 2011 our simulation results for this configuration show that the centre of the whirl in the x 3 0 plane is moved towards the anterior end of kv 4 2 all cilia tilted dorsally the cilia motion in our simulations is always clockwise about its axis of rotation viewed from tip to base however examining the cilia motion about the dv x 3 axis a dorsally tilted cilium located around the equatorial region x 3 0 will spend half of its beat cycle moving with an anticlockwise component relative to the dv axis and half of its beat cycle moving with an clockwise component relative to the dv axis the dorsal tilt results in equatorial cilia consistently performing an effective stroke in the anticlockwise direction relative to the dv axis and a recovery stroke in the clockwise direction relative to the dv axis the anticlockwise flow relative to the dv axis will predominate as evident in the anticlockwise pointing arrows in figure 10 d homogeneous distribution and figure 11 d higher concentration on the dorsal roof comparing figures 10 d and 11 d it is evident that with cilia concentrated on the anterior of the dorsal roof the centre of the whirl is again moved to the anterior moreover the rotational flow velocity is increased relative to the homogeneous case 4 3 cilia tilted dorsally and posteriorly results for a mixture of posterior tilt on the roof and floor and dorsal tilt at the equator are shown in figures 10 g and 11 g for homogeneous cilia distribution the results are very similar to the pure dorsal tilt model however with increased cilia density on the anterior of the dorsal roof the mixed tilt results in increased flow magnitude this anticlockwise global vortex that is strongest from right to anterior to left is similar qualitatively to the experimental observations kreiling et al 2007 supatto et al 2008 the flow is of similar magnitude in the region above the cilia tips and has the largest magnitude of the models considered 4 4 comparison of dorsal only and mixed tilt while the equatorial sections shown in figures 11 d g do not show great differences between dorsal only and mixed posterior and dorsal tilt analysis of flow in a transverse section equidistant from the anterior and posterior poles shows considerable differences the flow field resulting from exclusively dorsally tilted cilia is relatively small and does not show any clear directionality figure 12 a by contrast a mixture of posterior and dorsal tilt figure 12 b results in a leftward flow near the dorsal roof and rightward return flow near the ventral floor of similar magnitude 5 summary and discussion previous experimental studies of cilia driven flow inside kupffer s vesicle kv estab lished that the flow was a circulation about the dorsal ventral axis from anterior to left kreiling et al 2007 supatto et al 2008 however kreiling et al and supatto et al report different mechanisms which may be responsible for creating the flow we have developed a theoretical model of flow in the

figure 6 results for dorsal only tilt are shown in a and for a mixture of dorsal and posterior tilt in b the latter shows a leftward flow near the dorsal roof and rightward counterflow flow near the ventral floor other details are as shown in figure 10 density at the anterior of the dorsal roof analysis of flow in a transverse section suggests that the mixed posterior and dorsal tilt may more closely match experimental observa tions in medakafish kv than dorsal only tilt in particular showing a leftward flow near the dorsal roof and rightward counterflow near the ventral floor however medakafish kv is a different biological entity from zebrafish kv possessing just a single population of cilia on the dorsal roof and no cilia on the ventral floor future experimental observations may provide more information on the flow field and therefore the requirement for the mixture of dorsal and posterior tilt postulated here an interesting finding in terms of interpreting experimental observations is that in the dorsal anterior corner the posterior tilt and a dorsal tilt directions are very similar and may not be easily distinguishable experimentally our computations were restricted to a population of cilia rotating in synchrony with a frequency of 30 hz the latter assumption is not a significant limitation reports see for example okabe et al 2008 suggest that rotational frequency lies within a very narrow range and indeed is close to the estimated value of 30 hz moreover the temporal invariance of the stokes flow equations describing microscale flow entails that fluid velocity is directly proportional to beat frequency for example that fluid velocity for a beat frequency of 25 hz can be calculated directly by multiplying our reported results by 5 6 the assumption of cilia synchronisation is not likely to affect time averaged flow properties due to the relative sparsity of the cilia particle tracking studies however may reveal significant changes to trajectories resulting from non synchronisation for example cilia driven flow in zebrafish 15 even changes to cilia phase difference see for example smith et al 2007 figure 12 can significantly alter the trajectories of particles released near to cilia there are a number of questions that remain unanswered regarding symmetry break ing flow in kv organising structures are growing transient entities and the changes in size ciliation and flow field during its existence remain to be elucidated more ex tensive experimental observations and modelling will provide information on this issue the process of how an asymmetric flow is translated into asymmetric development is still unclear a leftward flow may allow morphogens to be transported to the left allow ing a concentration gradient to be established across the left right axis subject to the morphogens being bound or rendered inactive before they are returned by the counter flow cartwright et al 2004 if such morphogens are enclosed in micron sized or larger lipoprotein vesicles as reported in the mouse tanaka et al 2005 the effect of diffusion may be relatively small compared with advection we may predict the movement of such vesicles through lagrangian particle tracking or simulations which include finite sized rigid or deformable vesicles suspended in the fluid furthermore it will be possible to calculate the trajectories of individual particles from a range of initial positions and test for evidence of chaos in the domain as discussed previously smith et al 2007 supatto et al 2008 by calculating lyapunov exponents for a group of particles initially close together otto et al 2001 a related question is how finite sized particles including vesicles and other particles imaged experimentally affect the flow field the competing hypothesis of mechanical sensing by passive cilia or other mechanotranducers may also be investigated using similar approaches it is not clear how kv cilia know which way to tilt in the mouse node the migration of the cilium basal body towards the posterior combined with the convex cell surface establishes the posterior tilt hashimoto et al 2010 the mechanism responsible for the more complex cilia tilt distribution on the inner surface of kv is unclear modelling may be beneficial in helping to elucidate any possible cooperative hydrodynamic effect through which organised cilia orientation may emerge this study emphasises the tractability of modelling biological flow problems involving relatively complex geometries without the need for simplifying assumptions such as cilium slenderness and precisely planar spherical boundaries examples of other systems which can be modelled in this more refined way include the mouse ventral node surface features that have not previously been considered such as the uneven ciliated surface may be taken into account finally and in keeping with the theme of this special issue we remark that an inverted kupffer s vesicle bears striking similarities to more frequently studied objects of biological fluid mechanics modelling for example paramecia chlamydomonas ishikawa pedley 2007 pedley kessler 1992 and volvox drescher et al 2009 and therefore the theory in this paper may be generalised to the study of their swimming behaviour acknowledgements aas and tdj acknowledge studentships

integration rules numerical tests showed that a 3 3 gauss legendre quadrature abramowitz stegun 1964 for the curved quadrilateral elements and a 3 point fekete rule taylor et al 2001 for the curved triangular elements provided satisfactory accuracy provided the distance between the evaluation point and the element centroid is greater than element length where 21 for the quadrilateral elements 40 for the triangular elements and ele ment length was taken to be the longest side of a triangular element and the greatest distance between opposing corner points of quadrilateral elements the remaining in tegrals were evaluated using an adaptive integration routine briefly integration results were compared for different rules until the difference between successive rules converged to within a specified tolerance of 10 7 these values of were decided upon by calculat ing each integral for one timestep using our adaptive integration routine everywhere and establishing at which distance was a suitable cut off to switch between a low order inte gration rule and using the adaptive integration routine a tolerance of 10 5 was sufficient for computations results were reported for computations performed with a tolerance of 10 7 a regularization of 0 01 m was used meshes contained n 6252 elements resulting in 3 n scalar degrees of freedom for the stress fj m at each timestep
