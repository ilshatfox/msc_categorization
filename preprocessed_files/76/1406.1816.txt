ar x iv 1 40 6 18 16 v 1 m at h ph 6 j un 2 01 4 on hydrodynamic equations at the limit of infinitely many molecules s dostoglou n c jacob and jianfei xue abstract we show that weak convergence of point measures and 2 moment condi tions imply hydrodynamic equations at the limit of infinitely many interacting molecules the conditions are satisfied whenever the solutions of the classical equations for n inter acting molecules obey uniform in n bounds as an example we show that this holds when the initial conditions are bounded and that the molecule interaction a certain n rescaling of potentials that include all r p for 1 p is weak enough at the initial time in this case the hydrodynamic equations coincide with the macroscopic equations of maxwell 1 introduction derivations of macroscopic hydrodynamic equations from microscopic dynamics go back to the introduction of probabilistic methods in the description of molecular motions in max and continue in now classic works b cc ik gr m l to this day see ep and gk for recent reviews and references in the present article we examine macroscopic hydrodynamic equations as limits of the classical equations of motion for a system of n interacting molecules as n becomes infinite in particular we subscribe to the idea that whereas a classical system can be fully described by these equations for a finite but extremely high n a reasonable approximation of an observer s macroscopic perception is the limit at infinite n our motivation has been to substantiate reynolds s tenuous definition of hydrodynamic averages in r and his claim that averages as in max and r can only be space averages for this we use the classical equations of molecular motion and we average in space or time space but we do not use date july 19 2018

gibbs ensembles at the same time we make no assumptions of binary collisions molecular chaos etc and therefore we do not use the boltzmann equation in this sense our work has origins in the first part of morrey m and jepsen ter haar jth our starting point is the article d where weak convergence of empirical position velocity probability measures on r 6 and disintegration of the limit measure m with respect to its marginal the macroscopic density provide a rigorous definition of a macroscopic velocity u as the barycentric projection of the disintegration formulas 3 14 and 5 27 loc cit the tools there are from ags the kinetic energy of u is in general only part of the total kinetic energy of the macroscopic system formulas 5 11 and 5 12 in d this allows for part the remaining total kinetic energy at the limit to include heat and possibly other fluctuations following morrey m it is assumed in d that the total mass energy and moment of inertia stay bounded in n and to deal with the non linear terms that second moments locally converge with these d shows how the limits of equations for n molecules rescaled by a factor n at each n as in m can give at the limit n weak versions of macroscopic equations for the limit molecule density and the mean velocity u for certain interaction potentials only the divergence of the stress tensor appears in weak form in the resulting equations the aim of the present article is to show that the weak convergence of point measures and a uniform bound on their 2 moments imply hydrodynamic equations at the limit of infinitely many interacting molecules and to provide examples satisfying the two assump tions we also deal with two points that were not addressed in d first the existence of subsequences of point measures weakly convergent for all t in some 0 t second the measurability in t and the regularity of the macroscopic velocity u we obtain the macro scopic equations in section 3 first in theorem 3 6 using measures on 0 t r 6 both issues of common in t subsequences and the measurability of u are then overcome the morrey assumptions used in d satisfy the assumptions of theorem 3 6 then in theorem 3 8 we consider t families of measures on r 6 that have common weakly convergent subsequences limits at infinitely many molecules 3 as the assumptions of theorem 3 6 are satisfied whenever the assumptions of theorem 3 8 are the measurability of u is determined via comparison with theorem 3 6 we do not insist here on the form of the interaction part of the stress tensor for the examples that show later in section 4 this term does not appear at the limit our main tools are the gen eral fubini theorem for families of measures disintegration of measures and convergence of measures to substantiate the assumptions of the main theorems we show that the conditions of theorem 3 8 and therefore of theorem 3 6 are satisfied at least when the solutions of the classical equations for n interacting molecules rescaled as in m have accelerations uniformly bounded in n on any finite time interval this occupies the last subsection of section 3 the main tool here is le vy continuity finally to provide explicit examples we show in section 4 that on any fixed time interval 0 t when the initial positions and velocities are bounded and the rescaled interaction is weak enough compared to the initial conditions the accelerations are indeed uniformly bounded in n on 0 t the choice of scale for each n is such that distances between molecules can only increase in time the main argument here is by continuity under the same assumptions picard iteration constructs the solutions on any finite time interval these examples include but are not restricted to certain types of burst configurations i e examples where the velocities are any positive multiple of the positions at the initial moment in time on the other hand the choice of scale in section 4 weakens the interaction and for the ex amples in this section the interaction term vanishes at the limit of infinitely many particles the stress tensor then consists only of velocity fluctuations therefore the hydrodynamic equations we obtain coincide with the macroscopic equations of maxwell in max in par ticular for the examples in this section we show that on any 0 t the momentum equation is precisely in the form established by maxwell in max eq 76 nowadays derived via the 4 s dostoglou n c jacob and jianfei xue boltzmann equation as in gr eq 2 46 for example 1 as maxwell argues this form of the momentum equation can be approximated up to certain order and for quiet flows by the compressible navier stokes equations 2 hamiltonian equations 2 1 equations of motion we start with the motion of n classical molecules each of mass mn without external forces and with pair interaction potential energy between a molecule at x and a molecule at y equal to m 2 n n x y assuming always n of negative derivative for small distances where molecules repulse the force on a molecule at x from a molecule at y is m 2 n x n x y and the acceleration of the i th molecule at time t when its position is xi t satisfies mnu i t m 2 n xi n j 1 j 6 i n xi t

interaction potential is m 2 n n r and for v the molecules relative speed at t see ll 18 for v independent of the n this reads mn n n constant and one way to accommodate this is to set mn n r r n 2 3 1 recall that the validity of the boltzman equation has been established only for a fraction of the collision time limits at infinitely many molecules 5 cf abgs this is what morrey in m adopts and

problem for 2 4 on g r 3 n has for each n unique solution on any time interval 0 t 3 general results 3 1 standard measure theory weak convergence of measures is important in what follows a sequence of measures n converges weakly to a measure or n if f x n dx f x dx n for any f bounded and continuous the following is standard lemma 3 1 for any sequence of positive measures n and f measurable sup n f x p n dx lim r f x p r f x p n dx 0 uniformly in n 3 1 proof r p f x p r f x p n dx f x p r f x p n dx f x p n dx following ags chapter 5 we call f 0 uniformly integrable with respect to n if lim r f r f x n dx 0 uniformly in n 3 2 6 s dostoglou n c jacob and jianfei xue therefore lemma 3 1 provides a sufficient condition for f p to be uniformly integrable the following shows as part of lemma 5 1 7 in ags lemma 3 2 let n weakly converge to and f continuous with f uniformly integrable with respect to n then the n integrals of f converge without passing to subsequence f x n dx f x dx n 3 3 we shall use repeatedly the following general fubini and disintegration theorems for proofs in a context relevant to this article see a 2 6 and afp 2 5 respectively all spaces in these theorems are rk for some k all algebras are borel and a family of measures on x is borel measurable if for any b borel set in x the assignment 7 b is measurable as a map from the s to r to avoid completions of algebras we always extend functions defined off a set of measure 0 by setting them equal to 0 on that set theorem 3 3 general fubini let dx be a probability measure on x e and x dy a measurable family of probability measures on y f then there is unique probability measure m on x y e f such that m b x y b x y x dy dx 3 4 and m has the following properties 1 for f measurable and positive on x y the assignment y f x y x dy defines an x measurable function and x y f x y m dx dy x y f x y x dy dx 0 2 for f on x y such that x y f x y m dx dy is finite then y f x y x dy exists for almost all x and once extended by 0 to the remaining x s it defines an x measurable function which satisfies x y f x y m dx dy x y f x y x dy dx we shall use the notation m dx dy mx dy dx 3 5 limits at infinitely many molecules 7 as a shorthand for the measure m of theorem 3 3 theorem 3 4 disintegration for m probability measure on x y e f and dx pr 1 m dx on x e there exists a almost all uniquely determined borel measurable family of probability measures x dy on y f such that m dx dy x dy dx 3 2 molecule measures for x n i t u n i t solutions of the n system 2 4 on some fixed time interval 0 t with t define

item 3 of theorem 3 3 well defined for almost all t x and once ex tended by 0 to the remaining t x s it defines an t x measurable function which satisfies 0 t r 6 vm dt dx dv 0 t r 3 u t x dt dx lemma 3 5 for each n let n x dy be a borel measurable family of probability mea sures on y and let n x dy converge weakly to x dy for all x x then for a probability measure on x 1 x dy is a borel measurable family and 2 n x dy dx x dy dx proof let m b b y x x b borel measurable for the first assertion it is enough to show m b y by definition m b y so it is enough to show b y m or for c b y closed it is enough to show c m first notice that m is closed under increasing limit and with respect to difference of sets for any increasing sequence in m b 1 b 2 such that bn b x bn x b therefore x b is borel i e b m also if both a and c are in m and a c we have x c a x c x a therefore x c a is borel and c a m limits at infinitely many molecules 9 next we show c m for any b c approximate fn y b y n by fn positive continuous and bounded e g fn y 1 nd y b 1 then x b b x dy lim n fn x dy lim n lim n fn n x dy 3 13 by assertion 2 in theorem 3 3 general fubini fn n x dy is borel therefore so is x b it is clear that c is closed under finite intersections and y c then by the monotone class theorem jp p 36 c m for the second assertion note that for any f x y bounded continuous lim n f x y n x dy dx lim n f x y n x dy dx f x y x dy dx f x y x dy dx 3 14 remark 1 suppose n x dy converges weakly to x dy for a e x x then lemma 3 5 holds for x dy extending trivially 3 3 interaction terms define now for

limits at infinitely many molecules 11 integrating over 0 t and since t x has compact support the left hand sides of these equations integrate to 0 this gives the continuity and momentum equations for

t r 6 v 2 m dt dx dv lim inf n 0 t r 6 v 2 m n dt dx dv 3 31 where in the last step we used the lower semicontinuity of weak convergence valid for all lower semicontinuous and bounded below functions therefore u l 2 0 t r 3 and x t x v u t x v u t x and x t x u t x u t x are separately integrable limits at infinitely many molecules 13 with respect to m we can then write 0 t r 6 x t x vvm dt dx dv

for u t x l 1 0 t r 3 satisfying the continuity equation 3 19 there is weakly continuous in t borel family t dx such that t dx t dx for almost all t see ags lemma 8 1 4 example 3 7 the sequence of measures m n dt dx dv on 0 t r 6 has weakly con vergent subsequence whenever there is finite constant b such that for almost all t 1 n n i 1 x n i t 2 b 1 n n i 1 u n i t 2 b 3 33 by chebyshev s inequality t x v r m n t dx dv dt t 0 r 6 t 2 x 2 v 2 r 2 m n t dx dv dt 1 r 2 2 bt t 3 3 3 34 the claim now follows from prohorov s criterion see gs p 362 conditions 3 33 are satisfied whenever the same inequalities hold at t 0 and the energies are uniformly bounded in n see m theorem 5 2 see also d proposition 3 1 the following shows that pointwise convergence and bounds give the same results as in the previous theorem this version is closer to the main result in d 14 s dostoglou n c jacob and jianfei xue whereas theorem 3 6 is useful for describing the measurability of the u and its assump tions are weaker than those of theorem 3 8 that follows the pointwise convergence of measures m n t dx dv m t dx dv is perhaps of more interest for applications theorem 3 8 let t 0 be any fixed finite time assume that there is subsequence of positive integers and some 0 such that for all n s of that subsequence and for almost all t in 0 t the following hold 1 m n t dx dv m t dx dv n 2 sup n un 2 t x n t dx let t be the first marginal of m t and u t x the corresponding barycentric projection then u 2 t x t dx dt and the continuity equation 3 19 and the momentum equation 3 20 hold for t and u t x proof lemma 3 5 and the first assumption here imply m n t dx dv dt m t dx dv dt m dt dx dv this is the first assumption of theorem 3 6 also the second assumption here implies the second assumption of theorem 3 6 therefore the continuity and momentum equations are satisfied for u and t as defined in theorem 3 6 for m by definition of mt x dv in theorem 3 6 mt x dv is borel measurable in t x there fore for fixed t borel measurable in x thenmt dx dv mt x dv t dx is well defined next we show m t mt for all most t notice that for any b borel in 0 t r 6 by the definitions of mt x dv and t dx bm dt dx dv bmt x dv dt dx bmt x dv t dx dt bmt dx dv dt 3 35 therefore m dt dx dv mt dx dv dt the uniqueness of the disintegration of m with respect to dt gives m t dx dv mt dx dv for almost all t therefore t dx t dx for almost all t now the uniqueness of the disintegration of m t dx dv with respect to limits at infinitely many molecules 15 t dx gives mt x dv m t x dv for dt almost all t and t almost all x this implies that u t x u t x for dt almost all t and t almost all x then the assertions of the theorem follow from their counterparts in theorem 3 6 for u t x and t dx 3 5 subsequences for bounded velocities and bounded accelerations the second assumption of theorem 3 8 clearly holds whenever velocities are uniformly bounded in n for all t in 0 t since n t are probability measures for all n and t we now show that if the solutions of the n hamiltonian systems have velocities and accelerations uniformly bounded in n for all t 0 t then the first assumption of theorem 3 8 also holds the main tool for this is the use of characteristic functions rather than the prohorov s criterion cf m p 291 we then use le vy continuity which holds without passing to subsequences for the convergence of measures proposition 3 9 assume uniformly bounded in n accelerations and therefore velocities and positions x n i t u n i t d dt u n i t bt t 0 t i 1 n n n 3 36 then there is a subsequence ni of n s independent of t such that for all t in 0 t m ni t dx dv mt dx dv 3 37 proof the characteristic of m n t is n t y w ei y x w v m n t dx dv 1 n n j 1 e i y x n j t

n n j 1 e i y x n j t w u n j t u n j t 3 39 are all bounded in particular for each fixed t and k n there is uniformly convergent subsequence of n t y on 0 t bk 0 by arzela ascoli therefore by taking k and diagonalizing there is subsequence ni which converges for all t and y in 0 t r 3 and which still converges uniformly on any 0 t compact the limit is of course continuous in t y and w as the uniform limit of continuous functions apply now the le vy continuity theorem jp p 167 for any fixed t on this subsequence to find that without resorting to any further subsequence m ni t dx dv converges weakly for all t 4 solutions with bounds uniform in n for each fixed n the solutions of the n system stay of course bounded on finite time intervals by continuity given uniform bounds on the energy and the initial conditions the averages 1 n x n i t 2 1 n u n i t 2 stay uniformly bounded in n on finite time intervals cf m theorem 5 2 here we show that there exists a class of examples where the solutions themselves stay bounded uniformly in n on any finite interval this class then satisfies all assumptions of theorem 3 8 limits at infinitely many molecules 17 we are interested then
