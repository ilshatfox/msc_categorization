and accord ingly it is applied to ideal or perfect gases the first attempt to deal with the non ideal gas effect in the framework of kinetic theory goes back to the dates of enskog 1 2 in his celebrated equation the displacement effect in collision events is considered leading to instantaneous transfer of momen tum and energy in a molecular size distance some authors make use of the vlasov enskog equation 3 5 for the study of liquid vapor phase transition in this equation the collision dynamics of the enskog model is retained and long range interactions are dealt with by a collective mean field like in the vlasov or vlasov poisson equation for plasma some recent research trends in the connection to the kinetic theory for both gas and liquid phases can be found e g in 6 the above mentioned approaches are quite reasonable for our primary concern however it contains too much details of the molecular scale informa tion we are not necessarily interested in full details in that scale but rather interested in the dynamics of phase transition and a simple kinetic theory description for it we require to such a theory a capability of describing gas flows far out of equilibrium near the liquid interface and hopefully simplifying the descriptions in the recent literature in this sense our aim falls into the category of the original kinetic theory extension like 4 5 it is in its philoso phy different from many proposals in the framework of the lattice boltzmann method e g 7 8 because they are naturally limited to the continuum regime and thus to weakly nonequilibrium setting in the present paper we introduce the simplest version of our model this is the first step of our approach toward the construction of kinetic model equipped with the above mentioned capability that we want in this version full details of intermolecular collisions for the non ideal gas are not considered the collision term plays a role just as a thermal bath and conserves neither momentum nor energy even globally the expected interactions that induce non ideal gas effects are simply collected into a self consistent force field we stress that even with this simplest version the essential features of phase transition dynamics can be recovered as will be shown both theoretically and numerically in sections 6 2 and 6 3 we here mainly show that i by a natural separation of the mean field self consistent potential the potential for the non ideal gas effect is determined from the equation of state for the van der waals fluid with the aid of the balance equation of momentum ii a functional which monotonically decreases in time is identified from the h theorem and is found to have a close relation to the helmholtz free energy in thermodynamics and iii the cahn hilliard type equation is obtained in the continuum limit of the present kinetic model the last item iii is a natural consequence of the dissipative nature of the collision term some results of numerical simulations based on the obtained cahn hilliard type equation will be presented as well 3 2 thermal bath and self consistent mean field we are going to consider the following kinetic equation for a system composed of innumerable molecules in a periodic spatial domain d f t i f xi fi f i c f 1 a c f a m f a 0 1 b f fd fi xi s l 1 c m 1 2 rt 3 2 exp 2 2 rt 1 d where t is a time x a position a molecular velocity f t x a velocity distribution function vdf mf a force acting on a single molecule with m being its mass and its corresponding potential c f is a so called collision term and plays a role of a thermal bath and drives the system toward the thermal equilibrium at temperature t a is assumed to be a positive function of the local density and r kb m with kb being the boltzmann constant we distinct two types of brackets and in the above the former represents the argument of a function while the latter represents that of a functional or an operator the range of intergration r 3 with respect to and its dimensionless counterpart will be omitted in the present paper following the convention in nonmathematical literature einstein s notation on repeated indexes will be used throughout the present paper some explanation of the splitting of into s and l would be in order the self consistent force potential is split into attractive and repulsive parts the attractive part a is of long range while the repulsive part r is of short range and is a function of the local density by the latter and a part of the former we intend to reproduce a non ideal gas feature under the isothermal approximation which is represented by the potential s exclud ing effect by the repulsive force is usually included in the collision term with detailed collision dynamics like in the enskog equation 1 2 hence the sim plification by combining the mean field repulsive potential and the simplified role of the collision term is the main difference from the existing model 3 4 the attractive mean field is expressed by m a t x r 3 r t x r t x dr r 3 r dr t x m l r 3 r dr t x 2 where m is the attractive intermolecular potential and is assumed to be isotropic here l may be considered as a contribution from the long tail to the total attractive potential the subtracted part r 3 r dr t x will 4 be combined with the repulsive part to form the residue m s in the total self consistent potential m m s m r r 3 r dr t x 3 the functional form of which will be determined later from the van der waals equation of state in section 3 since s is of short range we are motivated to treat this as a local or internal variable the stress tensor this is the key idea behind our phenomenological determination of s from the equation of state see section 3 for details with the potential information thus determined the above system 1 a 1 d is closed when decays fast in the system size as usually expected the variation of is moderate in that scale and the taylor expansion is allowed to yield l t x 1 m r 3 r t x r t x dr 1 m r 3 r ri xi t x 1 2 rirj 2 xi xj t x dr 1 6 m r 3 r r 2 dr 2 x 2 i t x 2 x 2 i t x 4 here 0 since is attractive the reduction from the second to the last line is a consequence of the isotropic assumption on 3 balance equations and short range potential let us use the notation d and define the flow velocity vi by vi if by taking the 1 and j moments of 1 a the balance equations of mass and momentum are obtained t xi vi 0 5 a t vj xi i jf xj a vj 5 b although we do not show it here the balance equation of energy is obtained as well by taking 2 moment of 1 a with the notation ci i vi and the following reduction of the third term of 5 b xj xj s l s xj l xj xj sd l xj 6 5 where s denotes the derivative of s the above balance equations are recast as t xi vi 0 7 a t vj xi vivj cicjf sd ij l xj a vj 7 b here and in what follows unless otherwise stated the integrals with respect to and its dimensionless counterparts and that will appear later are indefinite integrals now let us assume the van der waals fluid then the equation of state is given by 9 p rt 1 b 2 a 8 where a and b are positive constants in the meantime the observation of the balance equation of momentum motivates us to define the stress tensor pij and pressure p as pij cicjf sd ij 9 a p 1 3 c 2 f sd rt sd 9 b where the following usual definition of temperature t has been introduced t 1 3 r c 2 f 9 c with these in mind we can identify the functional form of s under the isothermal approximation t t by the relation rt sd p rt 1 b 2 a rt b 2 rt 1 b 2 a 10 namely sd rt 1 1 b 1 2 a b 2 rt 1 b 2 a 11 6 straightforward calculations lead to the following expressions s b rt 1 b b rt 1 b 2 2 a 12 a s brt 1 b brt 1 b 2 2 a 12 b s rt ln 1 b rt 1 b rt 2 a rt ln 1 b b rt 1 b 2 a 12 c sd rt 1 b ln 1 b b rt b ln 1 b a 2 rt ln 1 b a 2 12 d in the equation for s the integration constant has been chosen so that s vanishes in the low density limit 0 in the meantime a thermodynamically consistent definition of the specific internal energy e is given by e 2 p t p t d 3 2 rt 13 which leads to the following definition within the present isothermal approxi mation e 1 2 c 2 f 2 1 t t sd d 1 2 c 2 f 1 1 t t sd 1 1 t t s d 1 2 c 2 f 1 t t s 1 sd 1 t t s 1 2 c 2 f 1 1 t t sd 3 2 rt a 14 in a similar way a thermodynamically consistent definition of the specific entropy s leads to the following definition of s within the present isothermal 7 approximation 1 s 3 2 r lnt r ln 1 s t d const 3 2 r ln t t r ln 0 1 s t d r ln t t 3 2 r ln 0 1 t e 3 2 rt 1 sd r ln t t 3 2 r ln 0 r ln 1 b 15 where the constant on the first line is determined so that s for the ideal gas vanishes when its density and temperature are respectively 0 and t com bining above two we have a relation that 1 2 c 2 f sd e t t sd e t s r ln t t 3 2 r ln 0 e t s rt ln t t 3 2 ln 0 a rt ln t t 3 2 ln 0 16 where 0 is a reference density and a e t s is identified within the isothermal approximation as the specific helmholtz free energy the above relation is useful to have a physical interpretation of a functional which mono tonically decreases in time in section 4 remark 1 since we have retained the effect of long range interaction as it is the long range part is not necessarily local accordingly we have included only the short range part into the definition of pressure and stress tensor if one assumes l 2 x 2 i from the beginning the long range part ought to be local as well and can be included into the pressure and stress tensor in the case the third term on the right hand side of 26 that appears later namely the interface energy may be interpreted as the effect of additional stress term which is appreciable only in a sharp change region like the interface this type of interpretation corresponds to a phenomenological fluiddynamic ap proach that introduces an additional stress at the interface here we do not take this interpretation since we treat the long range interaction which is not necessarily local 1 to reach this form we have taken into account two thermodynamical relations s 2 p t and s t t 1 e t where the pair of and t are chosen as independent variables within the isothermal approximation the former is integrated in to yield s s 0 t r ln 1 t sd then the second thermodynamic relation determines s 0 as s 0 t 3 2 r lnt const note that the set of the first two terms of s is identical to the specific entropy for monatomic ideal gases 8 4 h theorem and helmholtz free energy the collision operator c plays a role of the thermal bath and has a following property 1 ln f 0 m c f 1 ln 0 ln f m a m f a m 1 f m ln f m 0 17 where the equality holds only when f m the same operation as above on the left hand side of 1 a eventually leads to 1 ln f 0 m f t i f xi fi f i t f ln f c 0 ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 rt a 1 2 v 2 xi if ln f c 0 vi ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 1 rt a 1 2 v 2 vi 1 2 cic 2 f pijvj vi rt l xi 18 where v v and c 0 0 2 rt 3 2 we thus obtain the following in equality from 1 a t f ln f c 0 ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 rt a 1 2 v 2 xi if ln f c 0 vi ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 1 rt a 1 2 v 2 vi 1 2 cic 2 f pijvj vi rt l xi 0 19 where the equality holds only when f m now we integrate 19 with respect to x after some lines of calculations with the aid of the mass balance equation we first note that d vi l xi dx d t ldx 20 and that d t ldx d dt d ldx d t ldx 21 see appendix a hence we have d vi rt l xi dx 1 2 rt d dt d ldx 22 9 with 22 in mind we introduce the following quantities f f ln f c 0 ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 rt a 1 2 v 2 1 2 l 23 a fi if ln f c 0 vi ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 1 rt a 1 2 v 2 vi 1 2 cic 2 f pijvj 23 b by the substitution of the above into 19 integrated over the spatial domain d we have d dt d fdx d fi xi dx d ln f m c f dx 0 24 since the system is periodic the second term on the left hand side vanishes because of the gauss divergence theorem then we are left with d dt m t d dt d fdx d ln f m c f dx 0 25 where m t d fdx which is reduced to see appendix a m t d f ln f 0 m 1 rt sd 2 rt l dx 26 this is the functional to be minimized in time note that the last equality in 25 holds only when f m moreover if f is a local maxwellian with temperature t then f ln fc 0 ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 vanishes up to a constant multiple of and the functional m corresponds to the helmholtz free energy plus the potential energy of the tail part of long range attractive potential see the first line of 66 note that v 0 and t t if f is a local maxwellian with temperature t the present observation is thermodynamically reasonable because the system is in contact with the thermal bath with temperature t and the volume of domain d is fixed in the case l 2 x 2 i the third term of 26 is reduced to d l 2 rt dx 2 rt d 2 x 2 i dx 2 rt d xi 2 dx 27 so that m is expressed as m t d f ln f 0 m 1 rt sd 2 rt xi 2 dx 28 the last term in the above is often regarded as an energy of interface in the literature 10 5 dimensionless formulation let us introduce the following notation t t t xi lxi i 2 rt 1 2 i 0 29 a f 0 2 rt 3 2 f c 0 3 2 f e 3 2 exp 2 fi 2 rt l f i 29 b 2 rt s 2 rt s l 2 rt l 2 rt 0 m l 3 29 c 2 rt l 2 0 a a rt 0 b b 0 a a 0 a 29 d the original equation is then reduced to sh f t i f xi f i f i 2 1 kn c f 30 a c f a e f f f d e 3 2 exp 2 a 0 30 b f i xi s l 30 c where s 1 2 ln 1 b a 1 2 b 1 b 31 a sd 1 2 ln 1 b 1 2 a 2 31 b l x r 3 r x r x dr or with 1 6 r 3 r r 2 dr 2 3 0 r r 4 dr 31 c and sh l t 2 rt 1 2 kn 8 rt 1 2 a 0 l 31 d here and in what follows 2 x 2 i we also introduce the dimensionless quantities for the moments of f i e vi 2 rt 1 2 v i p 0 rt p pij 0 rt p ij e rt e s rs a rt a and t t t then the quantities with tilde are expressed as v i if t 2 3 c 2 f p 2 3 c 2 f 2 sd t 2 sd 32 a p ij 2 c ic j f 2 sd ij e c 2 f a 2 32 b a e s 3 2 ln 2 sd 32 c 11 where c 2 rt 1 2 c here and in what follows d in the mean time the equation of state 8 is recast as p t 1 b a 2 33 the balance laws of mass and momentum are rewritten as sh t xi v i 0 34 a sh t v j xi v iv j 1 2 p ij l xj 2 a kn v j 34 b furthermore by setting f 0 f and reminding c 0 0 2 rt 3 2 we have f f ln f e 2 sd l 35 and dm dt 0 36 where m 0 l 3 m and it is written as m t d f dx d f ln f e 2 sd l dx 37 where d is the dimensionless spatial region the counterpart of the dimensional one d remind that m is non increasing in time t and reaches a stationary state only when f e when l m is further reduced to m t d f ln f e 2 sd xi 2 dx 38 a 2 sd a 2 ln 1 b 38 b because d ldx d dx d xi 2 dx 38 c 6 asymptotic analysis for small kn in the present section we carry out the asymptotic analysis of 30 a for small kn in order to study the behavior in the strong interaction with the thermal bath hereafter we drop tildes from the dimensionless notation note that if we set a 1 the nonlinearity comes solely from the self consistent force field 12 the original dimensionless equation 30 a recasts as sh f t i f xi xi f i a e f 39 a s l f fd e 3 2 exp 2 39 b where 2 kn when kn or is small the right hand side is dominant in 39 a and we are motivated to write f f 0 g where f 0 e we construct g by an iterative procedure under the constraint gd 0 from 39 a g sh f t i f xi xi f i 1 a 40 and the constraint leads to sh t xi igd 0 41 our procedure below yields a successive approximation to igd the first approximation g 1 is obtained by setting f f 0 in 40 i e g 1 sh f 0 t i f 0 xi xi f 0 i 1 a sh t i xi 2 i xi e a 42 because g 1 is an approximation to g within the error of o it is enough that the constraint is satisfied within the same order of error namely g 1 d o hence by substitution of the above expression of g 1 we see that sh t o which implies sh o 1 2 the first approximation is then simply written as g 1 i 1 xi 2 xi e a o 43 which yields ig 1 d i j 1 xj 2 xj e a d o 1 3 2 e a d 1 xi 2 xi o 1 2 a xi ln 2 o 44 2 in the present analysis the magnitude of sh has not been assumed except for that it is at most of o 1 if we set sh o 1 at this stage t is of o 1 which implies that the time scale in our dimensionless formulation is not proper to follow the time evolution for small in this way we find a proper size of sh to be of o 1 13 therefore the first approximation to 41 is given by sh t 2 xi a xi ln 2 o 45 to proceed to the second approximation we set f f 0 g 1 in 40 after some manipulations see appendix a we have g 2 a xi ln 2 ie 2 a xi a xj ln 2 2 a xi xj ln 2 i j 1 2 ij e o 2 46 it is seen that the above form has already satisfied the constraint g 2 d o 2 therefore by substitution the second approximation to 41 is obtained as sh t 2 xi a xi ln 2 o 2 47 it should be noted that the accuracy estimate of 47 is improved by one order from the stage of 45 although the resulting equation looks the same further reduction of 47 is possible by using the concrete form of since s l we have sh t 2 xj 1 a 1 2 s xj 2 a l xj o 2 48 by setting sh and taking the limit 0 we have t xj 1 a 1 2 s xj a l xj 0 49 remind that s 1 2 ln 1 b a 1 2 b 1 b 50 a s a 1 2 b 2 b 1 b 2 50 b l x r 3 r x r x dr or with 1 6 r 3 r r 2 dr 50 c for later convenience let us introduce a rescaled density b and rewrite 49 for the case that l is local then we have t xj a b xj k 2 x 2 i 0 51 a c 1 2 1 1 1 2 ln 1 k b c a b 51 b 14 where 0 1 and is related to s as 1 2 ln 1 2 s b by setting a 1 we have a following cahn hilliard type equation t xj xj k 2 x 2 i 0 52 a c 1 2 1 1 1 2 ln 1 52 b 6 1 linear stability of a uniform state in the present subsection we study the linear stability of the uniform state on the basis of 52 substituting av exp t ikjxj and retaining the terms of o 3 we obtain av av kk 2 k 2 53 a c 1 2 1 1 2 k 2 k 2 i 53 b thus is positive when kk 2 av 0 namely when c 1 2 1 av 1 av 2 the uniform state av is linear unstable the most rapidly growing mode kmr can be found by the condition d dk 0 which leads to 2 av 4 kk 2 mr kmr 0 namely k 2 mr 1 2 k av 1 2 k c 1 2 1 av 1 av 2 54 6 2 free energy at a local equilibrium and stationary states let us recall the functional m for the case l m t d f ln f e 2 sd xi 2 dx 55 a 2 sd a 2 ln 1 b 55 b under the assumption f e m is reduced to m t d ln 2 sd dx 56 note that except for a constant multiple of the sum of the first two terms of the integrand in 56 is identical with a see 32 c it is identical with 2 b d as well except for a constant multiple of we therefore simply call d a local free energy in the sequel a similar result for the nonlocal 3 if we set 0 as the average density then av is identical to b occurring in 51 15 a b fig 1 local free energy and two coexisting states a the local free energy d with c 3 95 and the two points

state is linearly unstable in the region above the neutral curve in b the three points that are determined by the equi area rule are indicated with a pair of closed circles and an open circle the dashed and dot dash lines are respectively the locus of the former and that of the latter in changing the value of c self consistent force field can be found e g in 9 and 10 we rewrite 56 in terms of the rescaled density to have an equivalent functional m t bm t d ln 1 c k ln b dx 57 here ln b in the integrand plays the same role as the lagrangian multiplier under the constraint d dx const and is to be written as below we can find stationary states by the variational method namely by the condition that m 0 which yields d ln 1 c 1 1 1 c 2 k dx 0 58 therefore k 1 2 ln 1 1 2 1 1 c 1 2 1 2 59 16 in one dimensional case the above equation can be interpreted as a motion of point mass in a potential field d 2 x and k are in terpreted as the position time and mass respectively this interpretation and following discussions in the present paragraph are due to van kampen 11 let us denote by a and b the values of at which a local maxi mum of the potential is achieved and thus the identity a b 2 ought to hold this means that there is a common tangential line of d to a and b the slope of which is 2 see figure 1 a in the meantime from a mechanical point of view the potential height there should be the same in order for a spontaneous transition from one to the other to occur therefore a d 2 a b d 2 b or b a d 2 b a this implies that two shaded areas in figure 1 b are the same equi area rule both interpretations namely the common tan gential line and the equi area rule often appear in the literature we now seek the condition that such different states can be found based on the present shape of the function because 1 2 1 1 2 c 1 2 1 h c 60 and h takes its maximum hmax 4 27 at 1 3 and a common minimum hmin 0 at 0 1 hence the condition 0 can be realized only when c 27 8 furthermore c 4 should be satisfied in order for the van der waals equation of state 33 with t 1 to assure the positive pressure p for any value of therefore we shall mainly study the case 27 8 c 4 in the sequel 6 3 numerical simulations of the cahn hilliard type equation we carried out numerical simulations of the cahn hilliard type equation 52 for one dimensional and two dimensional cases for different parameter pairs of c and av the chosen pairs are indicated by symbols in figure 2 a for the parameter pairs indicated by open triangles the results of two dimensional simulations are just preliminary and will not be mentioned in the sequel in all the simulations another parameter k is commonly set as k 4 3976 10 5 and the uniform state with av is initially disturbed by a gaussian random noise with the standard deviation of 0 001 further details of the initial disturbance can be found in appendix b the value of k is chosen so that the most rapidly growing mode kmr is about 6 2 in the case c av 3 5 1 3 we first show a part of the simulation results of one dimensional simula tions in figure 3 in each simulation m was monitored 4 together with the maximum mass flux i e f max max x d f f x k 2 x 2 61 4 here and in what follows the contribution from the last term in 57 is dropped from the monitored value of m because it is constant under the present constraint 17 a c 3 8 av 23 60 0 383 b c 3 5 av 1 3 c c 3 8 av 1 3 fig 3 phase transition towards two coexisting phases for various sets of parameters c av where k is commonly set as 4 3976 10 5 in each case the left panel shows the time evolution of dense light colored and dilute dark colored phases the scale in the legend shows the deviation of from the average av the contour line of av is drawn as well but it is omitted where x 0 05 for the clarity of figure the right panel shows the time evolution of the maximum minimum values of say and from a to e the values of kmr 2 are 10 3 6 00 11 1 1 20 and 10 2 the corresponding number of regions is observed at the initiation of phase transition the case f is in the range of linear stability and thus neither kmr nor phase transition is found figure 4 shows the monitored results in section 6 2 m has been evaluated under the assumption of the local equilibrium state f e the assumption is however broken in the region where the mass flux is appreciable as is clear in the analysis in section 6 in spite of this discrepancy the results show the monotonic decrease of m which is consistent with the prediction in section 6 2 the resulting consistency can be understood if we recompute m 18 d c 3 38 av 1 3 e c 3 8 av 17 60 0 283 f c 3 37 av 1 3 fig 3 continued from the previous page or m with a better approximation of f i e f e 1 i a 1 xi 2 xi o 62 even with the refined f

and the functional m e 1 i a xi ln 2 ln e i a xi ln 2 o e ln o ln o 63 thus m or m remains unchanged up to o therefore the deviation from the local maxwellian f e which mainly occurs at the interface does not affect the minimization dynamics up to o we therefore regard m as a functional to be minimized in time as well in the rest of the present subsection now let us observe the results in figure 4 more closely the above form of f in 61 suggests that the flux is appreciable only at the interface it is however appreciable only in more limited situations namely the initiation of phase transition

time evolution of the maximum minimum of say and and that of the system total free energy m in two dimensional cases a vs t b m vs t two parameters k and c are commonly set as k 4 3976 10 5 and c 3 8

functionalm decreases monotonically mostly with stepwise falls that synchronize the pulsive response of f max in the two dimensional case we observe a different feature of interface dy namics which is absent in the one dimensional case and thus can be attributed to a multi dimension effect see figure 5 that is depending on the average av the formation of interface geometry changes in quality when av is high low the regions of dilute dense phase appear rather separately and occa sionally connected dilute dense regions change their shape toward circular discs when av is intermediate the interface keeps connected and accordingly its geometry remains complicated figure 6 shows the time evolution of the maximum minimum of and m by comparing figures 6 a and b the main decrease or first drop of m looks triggered by the first occurrence of phase transition are almost saturated during the subsequent gradual decrease of m the gradual decrease of m looks attributed to a gradual deformation of the interface 21 as to the details of the present numerical computations the reader is referred to appendix b 7 concluding remark in the present paper we presented a simple kinetic model for the phase transi tion of the van der waals fluid we constructed the model as simple as possible with retaining the essential features for reproducing the phase transition phe nomenon although our model is rather primitive it is reasonable enough to retain a firm connection to fluid dynamical and statistical mechanical concepts available in the literature the simple role of the collision term as a thermal bath makes it easier to find the monotonically decreasing functional in time by the h theorem and its relation to the free energy in thermodynamics the nu merical simulations were conducted as well for the cahn hilliard type equation that was obtained in the continuum limit of the presented model the simula tions demonstrated the actual occurrence of phase transition with this model and provided some details of dynamics in the near equilibrium regime as was briefly mentioned we shall extend the present model to be appli cable to far out of equilibrium gas flows in such flows the isothermal ap proximation is no longer appropriate and the contact with external walls is common the extensions in these directions are not straightforward and are left for future works a derivations of some equations the equalities 20 and 21 are obtained as follows first the integration by part results in 20 d vi l xi dx d xi vi l dx d vi xi ldx d t ldx 64 because at the second equality the first term vanishes by the periodic condition and the second term is transformed into the term on the right hand side by using 7 a next using the definition of l see 2 the right hand side of the above equation is transformed as d t ldx 1 m d dx x t r 3 dr r x r x 1 m d dt d dx r 3 ds x x s s x 1 m d dx r 3 ds x x s t s x 1 m d dt d dx r 3 ds x x s s x 1 m d ds r 3 dx x x s t s 1 m d dx r 3 ds x x s t x 22 1 m d dt d dx r 3 ds x x s s x 1 m d dx r 3 ds s x s t x 1 m d dx r 3 ds x x s t x 1 m d dt d dx r 3 ds x x s s x 1 m d dx x t r 3 ds x s s x d dt d ldx d t ldx 65 here we have suppressed t in the arguments of for brevity in the second term just after the third equality the ranges of integration with respect to x and s have been interchanged by using the periodicity in space the above derivation of 21 relies on the specific form of l however we can show that 21 is valid as well when l we omit its calculation here the reduction of m into the form 26 is carried out as follows m t d f ln f c 0 ln t 3 2 t 3 2 0 rt a 1 2 v 2 1 2 l dx d f ln f c 0 1 rt 1 2 c 2 f 1 2 v 2 sd 2 rt l dx d f ln f c 0 1 rt 1 2 2 f sd 2 rt l dx d f ln f 0 m 1 rt sd 2 rt l dx 66 in the above transformation there are two keys one is the elimination of a from the expression by using 16 and the other is the relation 2 f f ln 0 m c 0 the second approximation to g namely 46 is obtained by setting f f 0 g 1 in 40 the process of transformation is as follows g 2 sh f 0 t i f 0 xi xi f 0 i 1 a sh g 1 t i g 1 xi xi g 1 i 1 a g 1 2 i xi xi i j e a xj ln 2 o 2 sh t i xi ln 2 e a 2

of 18 is the consequence of the following transformation 1 ln f 0 m f t i f xi fi f i t f ln f c 0 xi if ln f c 0 1 2 rt 2 f t i f xi fi f i 23 t f ln f c 0 xi if ln f c 0 1 rt t 1 2 c 2 f 1 2 v 2 sd

numerical computations the original system is first discretized uniformly in each direction of space where the second order central difference is adopted to be more precise the equation 52 is

d for two dimensional 2 d simulations here h is the interval of the uniform grid and t has been suppressed in the argument of functions in the standard grid system the spatial domain is divided into 800 uniform intervals in each direction all the results shown in section 6 3 are those obtained by the computations with the standard grid as is already mentioned in section 6 3 the initial disturbance for each simulation is commonly a gaussian noise with the standard deviation of 0 001 but it is shifted in amplitude so as not to change the total mass in the domain furthermore the gaussian noise was generated on the basis of 100 grid for 1 d and 100 100 grid for 2 d simulations so as not to change the initial 24 a 1 d b 2 d fig 7 grid dependence of the results for the case c 3

size coarse grids in the 2 d simulation the three types of hatched area namely the upward hatched area with wide interval the downward hatched area and the upward hatched area with narrow interval represent the area where 0 003 0 01 0 01 0 03 and 0 03 the scale in the legend shows av disturbance for different grid systems the minimum length of the generated randomness is eight times longer than the interval of the standard grid 800 for 1 d and 800 800 for 2 d in each spatial direction this rather artificial care enables us to check the grid convergence of the numerical solutions with keeping the randomness of the initial disturbance the time integration of the discretized system for 1 d has been carried out by imple menting the double precision version of lsoda code in the odepack developed by the lawrence livermore national laboratory which is available from http www netlib org odepack as of august 22 2017 the code uses the adams predictor corrector method in the non stiff case and the backward differentiation formula bdf method in the stiff case and it is decided adaptively which method to use actually however the adams method was used only at the first time step in all of our simulations the code uses both the variable timestep and the multistep and the size of timestep and the degree of multistep up to four steps are optimized automatically as well for the details of related optimization principle and features of lsoda itself the reader is referred to 12 as well as the summary text odkd sum in the odepack in the meantime the time integration of the discretized system for 2 d has been carried out by the explicit two steps runge kutta method which is of the second order accuracy if we symbolically rewrite 70 as t f the time integration has been carried out by the following set of the prediction and correction steps n 1 n f n tn 1 71 a n 1 n 1 2 f n f n 1 tn 1 71 b where n denotes the value of at t tn t 0 0 and tn 1 tn 1 tn the correction step is taken only once in a single time step namely the so called pec mode is adopted the timestep tn 1 is fixed in contrast to 1 d simulations as 1 10 9 for the standard grid 800 800 2 10 8 for 400 400 grid 2 10 7 for 200 200 grid and 2 10 6 for 100 100 grid we implemented the lsoda code as well for the time integration in 2 d however it turned out to be very time consuming and had to be limited only to four or more times coarse grids for the four or more times coarse grids we had a reasonable agreement between the results of runge kutta and lsoda codes the present scheme for both 1 d and 2 d is not based on a mass preserving method nevertheless we observed that the total mass was perfectly preserved in 1 d simulations in contrast in 2 d simulations a straightforward implementation caused a gradual change of 25 the total mass in the domain in both the runge kutta and lsoda codes which could affect the main feature of the phase transition in the system we therefore renormalize the total mass at the beginning of every time step the adverse side effect of this remedy should be carefully assessed we thus performed the simulations without renormalization for the same grid and those with renormalization for a more refined grid as well the multiplied factor for the renormalization was close to unity the deviation from which was about 1 47 10 11 for the standard grid 800 800 5 50 10 10 for 400 400 grid and 2 15 10 8 for 200 200 grid the size of deviations per unit time was decreasing from 0 10 for 200 200 grid to 0 028 or 0 015 for 400 400 or 800 800 grid showing the improvement of reliability by a grid refinement we did not find any qualitative difference among the above three types of simulations such as the spatial arrangement of different phases the number of the dilute dense regions however due to slight differences of the instance of merging and of the interface position the grid dependence of at a fixed position and time is not necessarily small see figure 7 all the numerical results presented in section 6 3 are those obtained with the standard grid and with the remedy of total mass renormalization acknowledgements the present work was supported in part by
