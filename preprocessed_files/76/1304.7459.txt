aeronautical engineering studies beer sheva israel september 6 2021 abstract axisymmetric accretion disks in vicinity of a central compact body are studied for the simple models such as vertically isothermal disks as well as adiabatic ones the exact solutions to the steady state mhd magneto hydrodynamic system were found under the assumption that the radial components of velocity and magnetic field are negligible on the basis of the exact solution one may conclude that vertically isothermal disks will be totally isothermal the exact solution for the case of adiabatic disk cor roborates the view that thin disk accretion must be highly nonadiabatic an intermediate approach that is between the above listed two for the modeling of thin accretion disks is developed in the case of non magnetic disk this approach enables to prove with ease that all solutions for the midplane circular velocity are unstable provided the disk is non viscous hence this approach enables to demonstrate that the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks is possible it is interesting that a turbulent magnetic disk tends to be keplerian this can easily be shown by assum ing that the turbulent gas tends to flow with minimal losses i e to have the euler number as small as possible 1 introduction we will consider the dynamics of axisymmetric accretion disk around a compact object a successful theory of the process in question is mainly developed see e g 6 8 29 27 28 extensive use is made of simple models such as vertically isothermal disks as well as adiabatic ones to estimate possible errors and limits associated to these models the exact solutions to the steady state mhd system were found see sec 2 and sec 3 under the assumption that the radial components of velocity and magnetic field are negligible we will e mail vyacheslav borisov at gmail com 1 http arxiv org abs 1304 7459 v 5 also consider an intermediate case see sec 4 that is between the above listed two axisymmetric flows such an approach for the modeling of thin accretion disks turns out to be more flexible and efficient in particular the question of pure hydrodynamic turbulence was an open question 4 8 21 24 until recent years the possibility for finite disturbances to develop turbulence in the nonlinear regime was demonstrated by o a kuznetsov in 9 and in doing so he has disproved the well known arguments that pure hydrodynamic turbulence cannot be a self sustaining source of viscosity in accretion disks see e g 8 and references therein the other possible origins of pure hydrodynamic turbulence have been investigated in 21 24 using the approach of sec 4 we will also demonstrate that the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks is possible the input system of mhd equations is the following see e g 10 16 17 18 20 25 28 t v 0 1 t v vv p b 2 8 i 1 4 bb 2 e t v e p b 2 8 1 4 b v b v q q 3 b t v b 4 b 0 5 e 1 c v b 6 where v p b e q and denote the density velocity pressure

internal energy per unit mass for the plasma q denotes the local cooling rate 6 p 142 it is mainly assumed that g m r 2 z 2 g m const 7 the heat conductive flux q may be expressed as q t t 8 where t

i 10 where denotes a conjugate tensor v denotes the dynamic viscosity t and denote the turbulent viscosity and the kinetic energy of turbulence respec tively see e g 1 9 and references therein we will also use the viscosity v t obviously if the flow is laminar then 0 and is the dynamic viscosity in this paper the following three axisymmetric flows in cylindrical coordi nates r z will be considered 1 a vertically isothermal disk where the temperature is a pre assigned value p rt t z 0 r const 11 2 an adiabatic disk i e p k 1 k const 12 3 an intermediate case that is between the above listed two in some mea sure opposite axisymmetric flows such an approach permits us to avoid the solution of energy equation let us note that the number densities of ions and electrons at any point are approximately equal and hence a plasma must always be close to charge neutrality even a small charge imbalance would create huge electric fields which would move the plasma particles so as to restore neutrality very quickly 10 8 the plasma maintains charge neutrality to a high degree of accuracy however local charge imbalances may be produced by thermal fluctuations 10 to estimate their size it can be used the debye length d which is the typical size of a region over which the charge imbalance may occur 6 10 8 d 70 t ne m where ne denotes the number density of electrons t denotes the temperature the length scale s of plasma dynamics should be much larger than d for example inserting the numbers for coronal plasma we find 10 d 0 07 m considering typical length scales of coronal loops 10 s 10000 km we can see that the condition s d is easily satisfied we will mainly consider the flow at the periphery of accretion disk and hence the length scale of plasma dynamics will be much larger than the debye length actually the mean density of gas in the milky way is a million per cubic metre 6 then assuming that the gas temperature is close to 100 k we find that the debye length will be less than 0 7 m if however inside the disk there is a charge density then it gives rise to an electric field outside the disc which is available to pull charges out of the disc 8 hence in the case of at least steady state flow we may write see e g 6 p 188 28 p 275 that e 0 v b 0 13 let us introduce the following characteristic quantities t l v p t and b for respectively time length density velocity pressure 3 temperature viscosity kinetic energy of turbulence and magnetic field the following notation will also be used sh l v t eu p v 2 4 p b 2 fr v 2 l gm re v l ke 2 3 v 2 14 where sh

will consider in general accretion disks hence it is assumed that the values vr v p are even functions of z whereas vz is an odd one in such a case in view of 15 23 there exist two possibilities 1 bz is an even function of z whereas b and br are odd ones 2 the values b and br are even functions of z whereas bz is an odd one we will consider the first possibility if vr vz 0 then there exists the third possibility namely the values b and bz are even functions of z whereas br is an odd one in such a case the magnetic field will be unstable provided b 6 0 actually if vr 6 0 then b will be an odd function of z since we consider the case when bz is an even function of z it is very important to note that the solution such that b 6 0 is an even functions of z can not be obtained as a limiting case namely as vr 0 of the motion under vr 6 0 hence any solution for b 6 0 such that it is not an odd function of z may be seen as unstable as any infinitesimal variation vr 6 0 gives rise to a finite response in the magnetic field in the case of steady state flow we sometimes assume that the flow is charge neutral 13 i e r v bz vzb r r vrb v br z 0 24 2 vertically isothermal disk in this section we construct steady state solutions for the system 15 22 pro vided re ke 0 and br 0 vr 0 t z 0 25 let us note that the equality vr 0 implies vz 0 it could be easily seen from the steady state version of 15 we take p rt and hence we obtain from 11 that p t 26 the temperature in 26 is assumed to be a preassigned function of r in such a case the mhd system is reduced to the following eu b 2 r v 2 r r eup eu b 2 2 fr r 27 5 b bz z 0 28 z eu b 2 z z eup eu b 2 2 fr z 29 v bz z 0 30 bz z 0 31 in view of 31 30 and 28 we obtain bz bz r v v r b b r 32 then we obtain instead of 27 31 eu b 2 r v 2 r r eup eu b 2 z b 2 2 fr r 33 0 z eup fr z 34 let c z 0 z 0 35 by virtue of 26 we find from 34 that c exp tfreu c c r r z 0 36 if 23 is valid then c exp 1 tfreu 1 r 2 z 2 1 r c c r 37 let in general z 6 0 38 eq 33 must be valid under all values of z 0 after differentiation 33 over z in view of 34 we obtain v 2 r teu r tfreu r 39 since in view of 36 r c r c r tfreu exp tfreu 40 6 we find from 39 that v 2 r c teu c r c tfreu r c t 2 freu t r 41 after differentiation 41 with respect to z we obtain c t 2 freu z t r 0 42 since c 6 0 we obtain from 42 in view of 38 that t const 43 and hence c const exp v 2 rteu dr tfreu 44 if 23 is valid then 1 r let the disk be keplerian i e v 1 rfr 45 then c const exp dr r 2 tfreu 1 rtfreu const 46 thus the assumption that the motion is keplerian leads to a constant density at the midplane let us consider a vortex motion i e v c r c const 47 and let for the sake of simplicity c 1 fr then in general we have c r 0 48 the density at the midplane in view of 44 will be the following c const exp 1 rtfreu 1 2 r 2 tfreu 49 substituting 36 43 and 44 into 33 we obtain the following equation in b and bz b 2 r r b 2 z b 2 2 0 50 we can see from 32 that b 6 0 is an even function of z and hence b is unstable see sec 1 thus b 0 is a possibly stable solution and by virtue of 50 we find that bz const 51 7 the semi thickness h of disk is often e g 7 defined as h 1 c 0 dz c z 0 52 notice using the exact solution 37 in 52 we find that h provided that tfreu 6 0 thus even if the value of eu be small but finite the disk cannot be thin in terms of 52 instead of the exact solution 37 it can be used the following approximation cf 22 28 for small values of z c exp z 2 2 tfreur 3 c exp 1 2 z h 2 h r rtfreu 53 let us note that the semi thickness h r tr in 53 analogous formulae can be found in many monographes see e g 7 22 28 and references therein thus in the case of isothermal flow we have h r 1 5 54 till now we did not use the assumption that the flow is electrically neutral let us now assume that 24 is valid then in view of 25 we find r v bz r r 0 55 hence in view of 51 we obtain from 55 that 47 is valid i e we have the vortex flow 3 adiabatic flow in this section we intend to find an exact steady state solution to the mhd system 15 22 provided re ke 0 and vr 0 br 0 56 let us remind that the equality vr 0 implies vz 0 it could be easily seen from the steady state version of 15 we take p k and hence we obtain from 12 that p 1 57 then by analogy with sec 2 we obtain bz bz r v v r b b r 58 eu b 2 r v 2 r r eup eu b 2 z b 2 2 fr r 59 8 0 z eup fr z 60 it is assumed that p r z z h 0 and hence r z z h 0 where 2 h r denotes the height of disk let 1 1 1 p 61 by virtue of 61 we rewrite 60 to read z 1 freu z 0 62 we find from 62 freu c r 63 since r z z h 0 and hence r z z h 0 we obtain from 63 that 1 freu 1 r 2 z 2 1 r 2 h 2 64 hence 1 freu 1 r 2 z 2 1 r 2 h 2 1 1 z h 65 it is clear from 65 that 0 as h 0 by virtue of 59 and 61 we find eu b 2 r v 2 r eu r r eu b 2 z b 2 2 fr r 66 eq 66 must be valid under all values of z 0 since r z z h 0 we obtain from 66 that b 2 r r b 2 z b 2 2 67 by virtue of 61 and 67 we obtain from 66 v 2 reu r 1 freu r r freu 1 freu r 1 r 2 h 2 68 in view of 68 we have v 2 r 1 fr r 1 r 2 h 2 69 9 let for instance the motion is keplerian i e v 1 rfr 70 then by virtue of 69 we obtain that h 2 0 71 hence in view of 65 0 we can see from 58 that b 6 0 is an even function of z and hence b is unstable see sec 1 thus the possibly stable solution is b 0 and by virtue of 67 we find that bz const assuming that the flow is electrically neutral 28 we find from 24 that the flow is the vortex i e v c r 72 let for the sake of simplicity c 2 1 fr 73 then by virtue of 69 we obtain that h r 4 r 2 1 h 2 r 2 74 thus in the case of electrically neutral adiabatic flow we find that h r 2 75 4 perfect gas pre assigned midplane tempera ture as it can be seen from sec 2 the vertically isothermal disk will in fact be totally isothermal under the assumption that the radial components vr and br of velocity and magnetic field respectively are negligible furthermore the disk cannot be thin in terms of e g 7 adiabatic disks see sec 3 in contrast to vertically isothermal ones are more trustworthy however thin disk accretion must be highly nonadiabatic as emphasized in 27 because of this we will consider an intermediate case that is between the above listed two axisymmetric flows in this section we will mainly deal with geometrically thin disks in the case of e g adiabatic flow see sec 3 it will be valid if eu 1 we take p rt and hence we obtain from 11 that p t 76 10 we will consider symmetric disks and hence it is in general assumed that 0 z h here h denotes the disk semi thickness the temperature at the midplane i e t 0 t z 0 t 0 r t 77 is assumed to be a preassigned function of r and t it is also assumed that 0 implies t 0 as well as 0 and t 0 if z h i e there is a vacuum outside the disk 4 1 non magnetic disk it is assumed that br bz b 0 78 let vz vr 0 and let re ke 0 in such a case the steady state version of 15 23 will be the following system of pdes v 2 r eu p r fr r p t eu fr const 79 eu p z fr z 0 z h r 1 r 2 z 2 1 r 1 2 r 3 z 2 80 where h r denotes the free surface of disk the boundary conditions at the free surface are the following z h 0 t z h 0 81 let us note that outside the disk the system 79 80 is fulfilled identically since 0 and t 0 at any point with z h the radial pressure force is usually assumed to be negligible in comparison with gravity as well as with inertia force and hence the circular velocity v will be keplerian with a great precision see e g 6 9 11 29 let us consider this assertion in more detail since eqs 79 80 are written in a non dimensional form the assumption that gravitational and centrifugal forces in 79 dominate is equivalent to the assumption that eu 1 fr and eu 1 the degenerate equation corresponding to 80 i e the equation obtained from 80 by putting eu 0 has the following solution 0 for all z 6 0 and z 0 0 i e z 0 can be equal to an arbitrary non negative real number we have from eq 80 that eu p z z 0 0 eu 0 82 from the above it follows that the function p p z can have a weak disconti nuity at z 0 provided eu 0 hence p z is continuous for all z and hence p z 0 since 0 for all z 6 0 we emphasize that with z 0 0 and 11 p z 0 0 the temperature t z 0 0 let eu 0 in such a case the exact solution to eq 80 is the following 0 t 0 t exp z 0 1 eufrt z dz 0 z h 83 where 0 z 0 t 0 t z 0 because of the symmetry it is assumed in 83 that 0 z h r instead of z h r we obtain from 83 that z 0 as eu 0 provided that z 0 hence h 0 as eu 0 thus the disk will be geometrically thin if eu 1 fr and eu 1 we may also conclude from the above that t z 0 0 as eu 0 even if z 0 0 under eu 0 thus if eu 0 then we obtain an infinitely thin disk with z 0 0 or z 0 can be equal to an arbitrary positive real number if the latter is the case the disk would consist of non interacting particles as an illustration we refer to a cold dust disk consisting of small non interacting grains since the disk is gaseous h 0 as eu 0 and in view of 81 we may assume that 0 z 0 eu 0 0 84 an additional justification of 84 will be done in what follows since the values v and t are even functions of z we will use the following asymptotic expansion in the limit z r 0 0 2 z 2 t t 0 t 2 z 2 v v 0 v 2 z 2 85 where the coefficients 0 2 t 0 t 2 v 0 and v 2 depend on r only let us note that namely z r 1 and hence the power series in 85 must be represented in z r however for simplicity sake the denominators ri i 0 2 are mainly included into the coefficients by virtue of 80 81 we obtain the following equalities t 0 2 t 2 0 0 2 eufrr 3 0 86 t 0 t 2 h 2 0 87 0 2 h 2 0 88 solving the system 86 88 we find that h 2 4 t 0 eufrr 3 89 t t 0 1 4 eufrr 3 z 2 o z 4 t 0 1 4 eufrr z r 2 o z r 4 90 0 1 z 2 h 2 o z 4 0 0 4 t 0 eufrr z r 2 o z r 4 91 12 by virtue of 85 and 79 we find the following differential equation in the function 0 0 r 0 v 2 0 r eu t 0 0 r 0 r 2 fr r r 0 92 where t 0 t 0 r is a preassigned function we will use the following notation t 00 t 0 r 0 the boundary condition is the following 0 0 0 r 0 93 the degenerate equation corresponding to 92 has the following solution 1 0 0 and the midplane circular velocity v 0 v 0 r is an arbitrary function 2 0 0 r is an arbitrary function such that 0 0 and the motion at the midplane is keplerian v 0 1 rfr 94 if the latter is the case i e 0 0 then the disk is infinitely thin consists of non interacting particles and hence it is natural that all particles are in keplerian motion let eu 0 then the solution to 92 93 is the following 0 00 t 0 0 t 0 exp r r 0 1 reut 0 v 2 0 1 rfr dr 95 notice be the disk keplerian we would obtain by virtue of 95 that 0 00 t 0 0 t 0 r 0 0 t 0 0 const 96 thus if 0 r 0 as r then in view of 96 t 0 r as r and vice versa i e if t 0 r 0 then 0 r as r assuming that t 0 t 00 const we obtain that 0 0 0 const too hence the assumption that the motion is keplerian leads to improbable density and temperature distributions at the midplane under r r 0 to avoid such unlikely solutions we have to accept that the motion is not keplerian and hence v 2 0 1 rfr r 97 it is well known see e g 6 27 29 that a gaseous disk formed around a central star is in an almost keplerian rotation with a small inward drift velocity let us investigate this almost keplerian rotation let vr 6 0 then instead of 79 80 we should consider the following system 1 r r vr r vz z 0 98 13 1 r r r v 2 r z vrvz v 2 r r eup fr r 99 1 r r r v vr z v vz v vr r 0 100 1 r r r vzvr z v 2 z z eup fr z 101 for the sake of simplicity we take the characteristic quantity l for length such that r 0 1 102 since vr is an even function of z but vz is an odd one we can write for small values of z vr vr 0 vr 2 z 2 vz vz 1 z vz 3 z 3 103 where the coefficients depend on r only by virtue of 85 103 we obtain from 98 100 that 1 r r 0 vr 0 r 0 vz 1 0 104 1 r r r 0 v 0 vr 0 0 v 0 vz 1 0 v 0 vr 0 r 0 105 by virtue of 104 105 we obtain 0 vr 0 rv 0 r r 0 106 thus we find the following exact solution for the midplane value v 0 of circular velocity v 0 c 0 r c 0 const 107 for the sake of convenience let us represent c 0 as a function of the froude number fr let the point r rm be the only point where the motion is keplerian as well as the vortex 107 then c 0 rm 1 rmfr c 0 rm fr 108 hence v 0 v z 0 rm r fr rm const 109 notice in the case of a non viscous flow with vr 0 6 0 we have the only solution 107 for the midplane circular velocity v 0 if however vr 0 0 then we have infinitely many solutions for v 0 the only limitations are the boundary conditions in particular the function v 0 v 0 r must be such that 0 r 0 as r in 95 thus if vr 0 0 then we have the ill posed problem i e 14 the problem is not well posed in the sense of hadamard 1 it is important to note that any solution excluding the vortex for v 0 can not be obtained as a limiting case namely as vr 0 0 of the motion under vr 0 6 0 hence any solution that does not coincide with the vortex will be unstable as any infinitesimal variation vr 0 6 0 gives rise to a finite response in the gas flow the stability of the solution 109 should be investigated some stability aspects of the vortex flow will be discussed in sec 4 1 1 it is necessary to stress that by virtue of the solution 107 we obtain from 95 the validity of 84 thus in contrast to the widely known assertion that the circular velocity will be keplerian with a great precision see e g 6 9 11 29 the for going proves that in the case of steady state non viscous disk we obtain the vortex velocity distribution 107 even if the radial pressure force is negligible in comparison with gravity and inertia forces the solutions similar to 107 are used to describe a large variety of flow patterns in particular to model cosmic swirling jets that develop near accretion disks 26 let us note that the power law model 29 p 374 v 0 c r c const 110 is assumed to be stable rayleigh stable 8 to pure hydrodynamic perturbations under 0 5 1 since it satisfies the following necessary and sufficient condition for the so called rayleigh stability 2 p 78 f 2 r 1 r 3 r r 2 2 0 111 where denotes the angular velocity f 2 r denotes the rayleigh frequency such an assertion contradicts to the forgoing prove that any solution that does not coincide with the vortex velocity distribution 107 will be unstable it should be stressed that the rayleigh criterion 111 is not strictly applicable to a nebular accretion disk 4 this remark 4 is correct because the rayleigh criterion 111 is justified for subsonic flows 2 whereas we consider highly supersonic flows actually since eu 1 the mach number ms 1 eu 1 let us estimate v 2 in 85 we will use the following asymptotic expansion t 0 r n 0 anr n 112 in the limit r as usually the series in 112 may converge or diverge but its partial sums are good approximations to t 0 r for large enough r assuming that t 0 r 0 as r we find that a 0 0 then assuming the character istic quantity t for temperature such that a 1 1 we represent t 0 r in the following form t 0 r 1 r o r 2 r 113 thus we can use the following approximation t 0 r 1 r r 114 15 one can easily see for instance that the midplane temperature of the adiabatic disks considered in sec 3 can be approximated by 114 by virtue of 114 we find from 89 that h r 115 let vz is a linear function of z i e vz vz 1 z with vz 1 vz 1 r from the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface i e vz z h h r vr z h 116 we find by virtue of 114 and 89 that vz 1 h h r vr 0 vz 1 vr 0 r 117 by virtue of 103 and 85 we obtain from 98 100 that vr 0 v 2 r 2 vz 1 v 2 v 2 vr 0 r 0 118 thus by virtue of 117 we find v 2 const r 3 119 by virtue of 85 89 114 and 119 we find that v z h c 0 r 1 c 2 eufr c 2 const 0 120 since eu 1 it can be assumed that v c 0 r 0 z h 121 it is easy to see from 121 that the rayleigh frequency f 2 r 0 and hence the vortex is rayleigh unstable let us now consider the stability problem of the power law model from an other point of view 4 1 1 instability of non magnetic disk power law model let denote the value of a dependent variable for the case of a steady state solution in view of 110 95 97 and 102 the solution to the system 79 81 can be written in the form vz vr 0 v 0 v z 0 c r c const 0 5 1 122 16 h 2 4 t 0 eufrr 3 0 00 t 0 0 t 0 exp r 1 1 reut 0 v 2 0 1 rfr dr 123 where 00 0 r 1 t 0 0 t 0 r 1 to represent c in 122 as a function of the froude number fr we assume that the point r rm will be the only point where the motion is keplerian as well as the power law model 122 hence c r m 1 rmfr c r 0 5 m fr 124 the non linear system in perturbations for 15 18 will be under re and ke 0 as follows sh 0 0 t 1 r r 0 0 v r 0 r 0 0 v z 1 0 125 sh 0 0 v r 0 t 1 r r r 0 0 v 2 r 0 0 0 v r 0 v z 1 0 0 v 0 v 0 2 r eu r 0 0 t 0 t 0 0 0 r 2

basic parker s assumption 23 as applied to perturbations we may assume that within the disk radial derivatives r are negligible in comparison to vertical ones using the parker s assumption 23 we can reduce 125 128 to an ode ordinary differential equation system for a subsequent stability investigation in this connection we note that the following question remains to be answered what a class of admissible functions i i r t in the expansions i 0 iz i 129 should be taken into account obviously it must be such that at least the main terms of expansions may be dropped under the derivative over the coordinate r assuming 0 r 0 in 125 128 we find that 0 0 since r 0 in order to circumvent this problem we will consider a function as admissible if it 17 will be a singular function 15 that is this function is continous on 1 r and the derivative over the coordinate r exists and is zero almost everywhere it can be also assumed that the function is strictly monotone decreasing e g v r 0 r 0 cantor staircase 15 and lebesgue singular function 13 14 are well known examples of such functions singular functions occur in physics dynamical systems etc see e g the references in 13 we restrict ourself to the case of linear system assuming the non linear terms as well as t 0 and t 2 in 125 128 as negligible we get sh 0 t 1 r r 0 v r 0 r 0 v z 1 0 130 sh 0 v r 0 t 2 0 v 0 v 0 0 v 2 0 r eu r 0 t 0 0 r

32 1 c r 1 139 we will use the following notation x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 0 v r 0 v 0 v z 1 let t sht then the system 135 138 can be rewritten to read dx dt a x 140 18 where a 0 a 12 0 a 14 a 21 0 a 23 0 0 a 32 0 0 0 0 0 0 141 the eigenvalues of a are the following 1 2 0 3 4 a 23 a 32 a 12 a 21 142 inasmuch as the eigenvalue 0 has algebraic multiplicity m 2 and ranka 3 provided 0 5 1 the solution to 140 contains secular terms namely the terms proportional to the time hence the solution 122 123 under 0 5 1 to the system 79 80 is unstable since the secular terms grow without bound as t let us note that we have already proven that any solution that does not coincide with the vortex will be unstable see the text between eqs 109 and 110 on top of that we have just now proven the linear instability of the power law model however this model satisfies 111 under 0 5 1 and hence a rayleigh stable flow may be unstable in the sense of lyapunov stability 19 let us now consider the solution 122 123 to the system 79 80 under 1 in such a case ranka 2 since a 32 0 and hence the solution to 140 does not contain secular terms thus this solution will be unstable 19 if a 12 a 21 0 143 by virtue of 114 and 124 we find that 143 will be valid if r max rm 1 eufr rm 2 eufr 1 144 since the disk is thin i e eu 1 we obtain the following condition of linear instability r rm 1 eufr 145 thus the vortex will be linearly unstable at least on the disk s periphery provided re let us remind that the vortex is unconditionally rayleigh unstable because the rayleigh frequency f 2 r 0 4 2 magnetic accretion disk we will use the following asymptotic expansion in the limit z r 0 then in view of the symmetry we may write b b 1 z bz bz 0 bz 2 z 2 br br 1 z b 3 z 3 0 2 z 2 t t 0 t 2 z 2 v v 0 v 2 z 2 vr vr 0 vr 2 z 2

0 0 6 0 and with a negligible dynamic viscosity i e 0 will be our initial concern the magnetic field will be called as almost poloidal if b 1 0 b o z 3 147 and the magnetic field will be called as almost axial if b 1 0 br 1 0 b o z 3 br o z 3 148 let us prove that the circular velocity at the midplane will be the vortex velocity i e v 0 v z 0 c 0 r c 0 const 149 if and only if the magnetic field will be almost poloidal actually since 0 the steady state version of eqs 15 17 is the following 1 r r vr r vz z 0 150 1 r r r v vr eu b br z v vz eu b bz v vr r eu b br r 0 151 in view of 150 151 and 146 we obtain 1 r r 0 vr 0 r 0 vz 1 0 152 v 0 r r r 0 vr 0 r 0 vr 0 r v 0 r eu b 1 bz 0 0 v 0 vz 1 0 v 0 vr 0 r 0 153 by virtue of 152 we obtain from 153 0 vr 0 v 0 r eu b 1 bz 0 0 v 0 vr 0 r

1 bz 0 0 156 by virtue of 149 we find from 156 b 1 bz 0 0 157 equality 157 proves 147 let us now consider a steady state magnetic disk with vr 0 and hence vz 0 and with a negligible dynamic viscosity i e 0 let us remind that such assumptions for the case of non magnetic disk lead to the ill posed problem in the sense of hadamard see sec 4 1 in particular the solution to the mathematical model sec 4 1 is not unique we intend to find a steady state solution to the mhd system 15 22 provided re ke 0 in such a case the mhd system is reduced to the following 1 r r r eu b 2 r z eu brbz eu b 2 r v 2 r r eup eu b 2 2 fr r 158 1 r r r eu b br z eu b bz eu b br r 0 159 1 r r r eu bzbr z eu b 2 z z eup eu b 2 2 fr z 160 v br r v bz z 0 161 1 r rbr r bz z 0 162 eq 24 is reduced to the following r v bz r r v br z 0 163 let b be an odd function of z and let br o z 5 then we find from 162 that bz 0 bz 0 r bz 2 bz 4 0 164 by virtue of 164 we find from 161 and 159 that v 0 v 0 r v 2 v 4 0 b 1 b 3 0 165 21 taking into account that br o z 5 and using 164 we obtain from eq 160 that 86 is valid for the case of the magnetic disk as well hence using 90 91 and 164 165 we obtain from eq 158 that v 2 0 r eut r eu t r eu b 2 z 0 r fr r o z 4 166 eq 166 must be valid under all values of z assuming z h we obtain in view of 81 the following equation in bz 0 eu b 2 z 0 r o z r 4 0 167 then we find bz 0 const 168 since br o z 5 we obtain from 163 by virtue of 164 165 that r v 0 bz 0 r r 0 169 we find in view of 168 169 that v 0 const r 170 analogously if br 0 and vr 0 then we find from 158 162 that b 0 and bz const thus in view of 163 the vortex velocity distribution v const r 171 will be the only solution for the circular velocity and hence the motion will be rayleigh unstable let us note the density and temperature distributions can be easily found from eqs 158 160 which can be written in view of the foregoing as the following 0 v 2 r r eu 0 t 0 0 r 2 fr 172 z eu t fr z r 2 z 2 3 2 0 173 where the circular velocity v is calculated from eq 171 notice eqs 172 173 coincide with eqs 79 80 and hence we obtain 90 91 and 95 notice we have assumed vr 0 6 0 in the above proven assertion that the midplane circular velocity will be 149 if and only if the magnetic field will be almost poloidal the following counter example demonstrates that the condition vr 0 6 0 is essential we consider the case when vr 0 and bz bz 0 o z 4 with bz 0 const in view of 162 we have br 1 cr 1 r cr 1 const 174 22 then by virtue of 174 we obtain from 163 the power law model v 0 const r 1 cr 1 bz 0 const 175 which is the only solution for the midplane circular velocity in the frame of our assumptions however in view of 159 b 1 0 i e the magnetic field is almost poloidal 4 2 1 viscous disk let us first demonstrate that the midplane circular velocity will be the vortex one 149 if the dynamic viscosity const 6 0 provided that the magnetic field will be almost axial actually if b o z 3 and br o z 3 then in view of 146 we obtain from the steady state version of eq 17 that 0 vr 0 rv 0 r r 1 re r r r v 0 r 2 v 2 re 2 re r v 0 r 176 in view of 22 and 146 we have 1 r rbr 1 r 2 bz 2 0 177 hence bz 2 0 178 by virtue of 146 we find from 20 that vr 0 b 1 v 0 br 1 r 2 vz 1 b 1 v 2 bz 0 v 0 bz 2 0 179 hence in view of 178 we obtain v 2 bz 0 0 v 2 0 180 by virtue of 176 and 180 we find that 0 vr 0 rv 0 r r re r r r v 0 r 2 v 0 r 181 obviously the vortex velocity 149 fulfills eq 181 no matter whether vr 0 6 0 or vr 0 0 hence in contrast to the non viscous disk we obtain the only solution 149 to eq 181 provided that vr 0 0 as indicated above the midplane circular velocity can be the vortex velocity if the dynamic viscosity const let us now consider the case when the midplane circular velocity is not the vortex velocity but the power law model v 0 c r const 6 1 c const 182 23 the power law model 182 can fulfill eq 181 if r the following inequality must be valid to fulfil 97 0 5 183 it is also assumed that the magnetic field will be almost axial i e b o z 3 and br o z 3 to estimate r at z 0 we assume vr 0 0 we obtain from the steady state version of eq 17 that 1 re r r r v 0 r 2 re r v 0 r 0 184 then by virtue of 182 we find from 184 that c r 1 c const 185 assuming the characteristic quantity for viscosity such that c 1 and using 114 we represent the viscosity in the following form t 1 186 the power law e g 5 18 30 for the laminar viscosity l of dilute gases can be written as the following l t 187 where typically 0 76 5 it is also assumed that 8 9 if 90 t 300 k and 0 75 if 250 t 600 k if we assume that the flow in question is laminar then l and hence 1 since we consider the flow at the periphery of the disk i e under a low temperature we find that 0 25 188 the inequality 188 contradicts to 183 and hence in contrast to the non viscous disk under vr 0 0 the power law model 182 can not be assumed as a correct midplane circular velocity in the case of laminar viscous flow provided that t 0 as r namely t r 1 let us now consider a possibility for the power law model 182 to be a correct midplane circular velocity provided the flow is turbulent the euler number characterizes losses in a flow 12 and it is higher in a turbulent flow than that in the laminar regime 3 let us now estimate the value of in 182 by assuming that the turbulent gas tends to flow with minimal losses i e to have the euler number as small as possible using prandtl and kolmogorov suggestion 1 p 230 that the turbulent viscosity is proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy of turbulence we evaluate 0 z 0 as 0 c l 0 0 5 c l const 189 24 let the disk be non magnetic vr 0 0 the kinetic energy of turbulence const and let rt i e ke eu then by virtue of 114 102 and 182 we rewrite 95 to read 0 00 r 1 exp 1 r 2 1 1 c 2 eu 2 1 1 eufr 190 we obtain from 189 that 0 c r 1 exp 1 r 2 1 1 c 00 c l 0 5 const 191 equating 185 and 191 at r 1 we find that c c let us now assume that of 185 and 0 of 191 coincide each other in the vicinity of r 1 i e at r 1 1 with accuracy o 2 in such a case we obtain that eu 1 2 192 as we can see from 192 and 183 eu min if 0 5 thus in the frame of our assumptions we find that the turbulent flow tends to be keplerian 5 concluding remarks on the basis of the exact solution to the mhd system in sec 2 we may conclude that vertically isothermal disks will in fact be totally isothermal under the assumption that the radial components vr and br of velocity and magnetic field respectively are negligible furthermore the disks cannot be considered as thin in terms of e g 7 even if the euler number 0 eu 1 the exact solution to the mhd system in sec 3 corroborates the view 27 that thin disk accretion must be highly nonadiabatic despite of the fact that adiabatic disks see sec 3 are more trustworthy than isothermal ones we find that the non dimensional semi thickness h r 2 instead of the ratio h r 27 the exact solutions to the mhd systems in sec 2 and sec 3 prove that the vortex velocity will be the only solution for the circular velocity provided that the flow is charge neutral let us note that the exact solutions are found under the assumption that vr 0 and br 0 the approach developed in sec 4 for the modeling of thin accretion disks turns out to be efficient in the case of non magnetic disk this approach enables to obtain with ease the solution for the steady state non viscous disk with a good accuracy to find the non dimensional semi thickness h r to prove that all solutions for the midplane circular velocity are unstable provided the disk is non viscous using this approach one can prove under vr 6 0 that the midplane circular velocity will be the vortex velocity if and only if the magnetic field will be almost poloidal the approach of sec 4 enables one to demonstrate that the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks is possible and to demonstrate that the turbulent flow tends to be keplerian 25
