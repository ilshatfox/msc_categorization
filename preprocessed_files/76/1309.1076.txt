the fluid decreases with shear certain microscopic swimmers have been shown to progress more rapidly through shear thinning fluids but is this behavior generic to all microscopic swim mers and what are the physics through which shear thinning rheology affects a swim mer s propulsion we examine swimmers employing prescribed stroke kinematics in two dimensional inertialess carreau fluid shear thinning generalized stokes flow swimmers are modeled using the method of femlets by a set of immersed regularized forces the equations governing the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body fitted mesh and solved with the finite element method we analyze the locomotion of three distinct classes of microswimmer 1 conceptual swimmers comprising sliding spheres employing both one and two dimensional strokes 2 slip velocity envelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as squirmers and 3 monoflagellate push ers such as sperm we find that morphologically identical swimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in shear thinning fluids than in newtonian fluids we explain this kinematic sensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid surrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer and using this insight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate purcell s scallop theorem in shear thinning fluids we also show that an increased flow decay rate arising from shear thinning rheology is associated with a reduction in the swim ming speed of slip velocity squirmers for sperm like swimmers a gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum alters the force it exerts upon the fluid flattening trajectories and increasing instantaneous swimming speed montenegro johnson et al phys fluids 25 081903

swimmers pervade the natural world from bacteria and algae to the sperm cells of animals and the study of their swimming is pertinent to numerous problems in medicine and industry for example in reproductive science and biofuel production microscopic self propulsion has been a rich area of applied mathematics for the past 60 years motivating the development of singularity methods such as slender body theory 1 2 and the method of regularized stokeslets 3 because of the small length scales of microscopic flows viscous forces dominate inertia as such there is no time dependence in the equations that govern microscopic flow and any periodic swimming stroke that generates net displacement must be non reciprocal i e distinguishable from its time reversal thus many swimming strokes that are effective at macroscopic length scales such as the opening and closing of a clam shell do not generate progress at microscopic scales as famously described by taylor 4 and purcell 5 microswimmers may employ a wide variety of kinematic behaviors figure 1 in order to progress for instance sperm swim by propagating a bending wave down a single active flagellum whereas ciliates squirm forward through the coordinated beating of many surface cilia motivated by the question of what would constitute the simplest microswimmer purcell 5 considered three linked hinges undergoing periodic irreversible motion which continues to inspire research see for example tam and hosoi 6 passov and or 7 1 ar x iv 1 30 9 10 76 v 1 ph ys ic s fl u dy n 4 s ep 2 01 3 http dx doi org 10 1063 1

surface cilia in a coordinated fashion this is often modeled mathematically with envelope methods either as a small perturbation to the cell morphology dashed or through a surface slip velocity d sperm an archetypal monoflagellate pusher propagate a bending wave down a single flagellum shown here in a time lapse manner a new avenue was opened for the study of simple conceptual microswimmers by najafi and golesta nian 8 who showed that a swimmer comprising three sliding collinear spheres could progress through viscous fluid such models provide insight into the physics of viscous propulsion for more complicated models 9 10 and may also be instructive in the design of artificial microswimmers 11 and microfluidic pumps many microscopic swimmers must progress through biological fluids for example cervical mucus 12 and bacterial extracellular slime 13 14 that are suspensions of long polymer chains these suspended polymers endow biological fluids with complex non newtonian flow properties that may impact a swim mer s ability to progress through them one such property that has received much recent study both theoretical 15 16 17 18 and experimental 19 is viscoelasticity whereby the fluid retains an elastic memory of its recent flow history in viscoelastic fluids those swimmers exhibiting small amplitude oscillations are hindered 20 21 22 whereas flagellates exhibiting large amplitude waveforms can gain propulsive ad vantages by timing their stroke with the fluid elastic recoil 23 additionally reciprocal swimmers that cannot progress in simple fluids may progress through viscoelastic fluids in violation of purcell s scallop theorem 17 another important rheological property biological fluids is shear thinning 24 whereby the viscosity of the fluid decreases with flow shear this behavior arises from the tendency of the suspended polymers that constitute the fluid to align locally with flow decreasing the apparent viscosity of the fluid however after early progress with modified resistive force theories 25 the effects of shear thinning on microscopic swimming have only recently begun to be reexamined 26 27 28 montenegro johnson et al 28 showed that the progress of two particular swimmers a three sphere swimmer and a sperm like swimmer was enhanced by shear thinning rheology this raises two questions do all swimmers progress more quickly in shear thinning fluids and what are the physical mechanisms through which shear thinning interacts with a swimmer s kinematics furthermore if reciprocal swim mers can progress in viscoelastic fluids might this also be true in shear thinning fluids in this paper we will show that other model swimmers including the much studied treadmilling squirmer may instead be hindered by shear thinning rheology we will also give quantitative and qualitative explanations of the physical mechanisms that underlie the interactions of shear thinning rheology with conceptual sliding sphere swimmers slip velocity squirmers and sperm like swimmers figure 1 finally based upon these mechanisms we suggest reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers that are able to progress through shear thinning fluids we will begin by briefly describing our mathematical and numerical modeling which was introduced by montenegro johnson et al 28 2 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 fluid mechanics of microscopic swimming newtonian fluid modeling has provided important insights into the mechanisms underlying viscous propulsion however the need for detailed study of non newtonian swimming has long been rec ognized 29 30 and experimental observations of sperm in methylcellulose medium suggest 31 that non newtonian effects may be important we will adopt a continuum approach to modeling swimming in biological fluids as used in for instance lauga 20 fu et al 21 teran et al 23 zhu et al 22 whereby the nanoscale structure of suspended polymers has been averaged into bulk flow properties at microscopic length scales viscous forces dominate inertia we will examine microscopic swimmers in inertialess generalized stokes flow 32 the equations governing the dynamics of such flow are 2 eff u p f 0 u 0 1 for u the fluid velocity field eff the effective or apparent viscosity of the flow p the pressure f any body forces and u u ut 2 the strain rate tensor a model of shear thinning polymer suspensions is given by the four parameter carreau constitutive law 33 careff 0 1 2 n 1 2 0 n 1 2 for shear rate 2 ij u ij u 1 2 the effective viscosity eff of the flow decreases monotonically between a zero shear viscosity 0 and an infinite shear viscosity as the time parameter increases lower shear rates are required to thin the fluid for swimmers with prescribed strokes a characteristic velocity is given by u l where is the angular frequency of the swimmer s stroke and l is a characteristic length for instance the length of the flagellum upon substitution of the viscosity 2 into equations 1 and non dimensionalizing we derive the dimensionless equations 2 1 0 1 1 2 n 1 2 u p f 0 3 a u 0 3 b thus for swimmers exhibiting prescribed beat kinematics trajectories are dependent only on three dimensionless quantities the viscosity ratio 0 the power law index n and the shear index sh referred to as de by montenegro johnson et al 28 the parameter sh has the physical interpretation of the ratio of the fluid s time parameter to the swimmer s beat period newtonian flow is recovered if any of 0 1 n 1 or sh 0 this non dimensionalization reduces the number of free parameters from four to three in contrast newtonian flow arising from prescribed boundary motion has no free parameters as such the trajectories of swimmers with prescribed kinematics in newtonian stokes flow exhibit no dependency on the absolute value of the viscosity these values only become important when considering the magnitude of the forces on the swimmer when prescribing the kinematics of a swimming stroke it is convenient to employ the swimmer s intrinsic body frame 34 in which its body neither rotates nor translates the configuration and defor mation of the swimmer are specified by a mathematical function relative to the body frame and these are transformed into the global lab frame coordinates in which we solve the governing equations this transformation entails use of the a priori unknown translational velocity u and angular velocity of the swimmer the swimming velocities u and result from the swimmer s body frame kinematics at any particular time and are constrained by the conditions that zero net force 35 and torque 36 act on the swimmer a schematic showing the relationship between the body and lab frames is shown in figure 2 a along with the computational domain used for this study figure 2 b it is well known that in two dimensional inertialess newtonian flow no solution is possible for the flow arising from translating rigid bodies in unbounded fluid domains this is known as stokes paradox and arises because the flow resulting from a point force in two dimensions diverges as log r far from the force 37 however the swimmers we will model are force free no net forces or torques act upon them furthermore since we model swimmers in channels the far field decays at least as quickly as o 1 r many cells swim close to boundaries so that finite domain modeling can be used to give a faithful representation of their environment it is highly instructive 23 38 39 to consider two dimensional flow models of swimming and thus we will present results for swimmers in finite two

femlets was developed by montenegro johnson et al 28 drawing inspiration from the method of regularized stokeslets 3 and the immersed boundary method 40 41 the method of femlets represents the interaction of the swimmer with the fluid through a set of concentrated blob forces of unknown strength and direction with spatial variation prescribed by a cut off function figure 3 while the method of regularized stokeslets reduces the problem to finding the coefficients in a linear superposition of velocity solutions of known form the method of femlets proceeds by applying the finite element method to solve for the fluid velocity field and strength and direction of the forces simultaneously for a one dimensional filament of length l and centerline parameterization s t the force exerted by the filament on the fluid is given by f x t l 0 x s t f s t ds 4 where f s t is a force per unit length determined by the swimmer s velocity in the method of femlets we discretize equation 4 by a set of regularized forces f x t n k 1 g x y r sk x sk f sk 5 the rotation r sk is chosen such that the axis r sk x sk xlock ylock t is aligned locally to the swimmer s tangent at the location of each femlet and x are anisotropic regularization parameters for this study we choose an elongated gaussian cut off function as in montenegro johnson et al 28 g x y xloc exp xloc 2 2 2 x yloc 2 2 2 y 6 the regularization parameter x is chosen to give a smooth representation along the swimmer of the force figure 3 b while reducing y produces a closer approximation to a line force equation 4 a validation

domain is given by a channel of length 10 l and height 5 l where l is a characteristic length for the swimmer normalized here to l 1 unit to ensure the independence of the results from the truncation length of the channel swimmers were also tested in a channel of length 20 l we will begin by examining the effects of shear thinning rheology on a class of model viscous swimmers comprising sliding collinear spheres that oscillate out of phase the first such swimmer was proposed by najafi and golestanian 8 it is formed of three spheres which move with the four stage beat pattern shown in figure 4 the kinematics of the beat is divided into two effective strokes during which the swimmer travels in the direction of net progress and two recovery strokes during which the swimmer readjusts its configuration to reinitiate an effective stroke whilst performing a recovery stroke the swimmer moves in the opposite direction to the direction of net progress we refer to the swimmer s progress as the distance it travels over an effective stroke regress as the distance it travels over a recovery stroke the swimmer s net progress is the distance travelled over an entire beat cycle the net progress can be seen as the sum of the distances travelled over all effective strokes minus the sum of the distances travelled over all recovery strokes in other words net progress neff i 1 progressi nrec i 1 regressi 7 for neff nrec the number of effective and recovery strokes respectively figure 4 shows that at any instant the swimmer can be thought of as comprising a propulsive element and a drag inducing payload element by force balance leftward relative motion of an outer sphere results in rightward motion of the remaining spheres through the fluid and vice versa the principle underlying the propulsion of collinear sphere swimmers is that the total drag on the two payload spheres is reduced if they are brought closer together thus the swimmer shown in figure 4 will exhibit overall leftward progress montenegro johnson et al 28 found that a version of the najafi golestanian swimmer with smoothed kinematics progressed more rapidly through shear thinning fluid however the

will now consider the simpler original najafi golestanian swimmer for which the outer spheres move at constant speed during each portion of the four stage beat cycle shown in figure 4 the body frame positions of the three spheres i 1 2 3 are given as a function of time t in table 1 where d 0 5 a 0 25 in our model figure 5 shows the effects of shear thinning rheology upon the najafi golestanian swimmer for varying power law index n as n is decreased from the newtonian case n 1 the swimmer s progress over its effective strokes figure 5 a and regress over recovery strokes figure 5 b are both decreased at all moments during its beat cycle the swimmer swims more slowly in shear thinning fluid this effect is slight for n 0 5 the swimmer s speed is approximately 3 lower during the effective strokes and 5 lower during the recovery strokes than for n 1 newtonian fluid however since swimming velocity is reduced more during the recovery strokes the result is in fact an increase in net progress shown in figure 5 c this behavior is demonstrated in figure 6 which shows the position of the swimmer over five complete beat cycles in newtonian and shear thinning fluid the swimmer s progress and regress are reduced by shear thinning but regress is reduced more and hence overall progress is increased but what is responsible for this decrease in instantaneous swimming speed and why is this effect enhanced during the recovery stroke figure 7 shows the effective viscosity of the fluid surrounding the swimmer at time t 0 for rheological parameters 0 2 n 0 5 and sh 1 the effective viscosity of the fluid surrounding the propulsive sphere is significantly lower than that surrounding the payload in the lab frame the propulsive sphere moves more quickly than the payload thereby thinning the surrounding fluid to a greater extent the drag on a sphere moving in inertialess newtonian fluid is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid whilst carreau fluid is non newtonian this observation is key to understanding the effects of shear thinning rheology if fluid is relatively thicker around the payload spheres the resistance coefficient of those spheres will be relatively higher than that of the propulsive sphere thus the instantaneous velocity of the swimmer will be reduced we examine this effect by calculating the average viscosity of the flow at points on a small circle of radius say surrounding each sphere i centered at xi yi i eff u ri 8 for ri coordinates x y such that x xi 2 y yi 2 2 the average for each sphere is calculated from 20 azimuthal coordinates we then split the set of viscosities into the viscosities of the fluid surrounding propulsive prop i and drag inducing payload drag i spheres we then calculate the viscosity differential diff 1 nprop

and payload spheres change according to the portion of the beat cycle as demonstrated in figure 4 the decrease in the najafi golestanian swimmer s instantaneous velocity is shown as a function of the viscosity differential 9 in figure 8 at time t 0 the swimmer initiates an effective stroke the velocity of the swimmer at t 0 relative to the newtonian case is shown as a function of diff in figure 8 a for varying n light gray orange online 0 dark gray blue online and sh medium gray magenta online this figure shows that the result of varying these parameters is approximately equivalent with respect to the viscosity differential furthermore figure 8 a demonstrates that the reduction in velocity arising from shear thinning rheology is approximately proportional to the viscosity

apparent proportionality between the velocity and the viscosity differential and that the viscosity differential is enhanced during the recovery stroke the the drag coefficients of the spheres are approximately proportional to the viscosity of the fluid surrounding them however the coefficient of proportionality between the relative instantaneous velocity and the vis cosity differential is greater during the recovery stroke figure 8 b this increase entails that the velocity is decreased more during the recovery stroke and must arise not from the viscosity at the surface of the spheres but in some way from the rate at which the viscosity field increases away from each sphere these results raise three interesting questions 1 is the viscosity differential always negative reduc ing instantaneous velocity for three sphere swimmers 2 will the coefficient of proportionality between the instantaneous velocity and the viscosity differential always be greater during the recovery stroke and 3 how does the rate at which viscosity increases away from the swimmer affect progress to answer these questions we will first consider a morphologically identical three sphere swimmer with different beat kinematics 3 2 a three sphere paddler drescher et al 42 showed that the far field flow induced by the the biflagellate green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii may be approximated by three stokeslets two outer stokeslets exerted a backwards force representing the flagella balanced by a central stokeslet representing the cell body inspired by this approximation one could consider a paddling three sphere swimmer 9 exhibiting the kinematics shown in figure 9 a the central sphere is stationary in the body frame and represents the swimmer s body or payload the two outer spheres move along closed non intersecting curves in the same plane as the body such that these curves are a mirror image of one another the behavior of this swimmer in newtonian fluid was analyzed by polotzek and friedrich 9 it was shown that the direction the swimmer travels is dependent upon the loci of the outer swimming spheres we will consider a swimmer for which the swimming spheres move along rectangles centered in line with body sphere the effective stroke occurs when the outer spheres are nearer the body so that the swimmer shown in figure 9 a will generate a net displacement downwards since no net motion of the swimmer occurs whilst the swimming arms are moving directly towards or away from one another we may consider only the two parts of the stroke given in table 2 for d 0 5 yrec 0 75 and yeff 0 25 figures 9 b and 9 c show the swimmer s progress and regress over its effective and recovery strokes respectively in contrast to the najafi golestanian swimmer considered above shear thinning increases the instantaneous swimming speed of this paddler progress is increased by around 1 and regress by around 2 the result is a decrease in net progress figure 9 d thus despite swimming more quickly at all times this swimmer is hindered by shear thinning flow this 10 three sphere paddler stroke x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 3 y 3 time t rec d 4 dt yrec 0 0 d 4 dt yrec 0 1 2 eff d 4 d t 1 2 yeff 0 0 d

demonstrated in figure 10 which shows the position of the swimmer over five complete beat cycles in newtonian and shear thinning fluid as with the najafi golestanian swimmer the effect of shear thinning is small for the parameters considered however these effects are sensitive to kinematics the najafi golestanian swimmer and the paddler both comprise three sliding spheres but through their kinematics they are affected by shear thinning in opposite manners to balance the forces induced by the two propulsive spheres the lab frame velocity of the drag inducing sphere is greater than the lab frame velocity of the propulsive spheres thus in shear thinning flow fluid will be relatively thinner around the drag inducing sphere than around the propulsive spheres figure 11 accordingly the viscosity differential for this swimmer is positive in contradistinction to the najafi golestanian swimmer above and thus the swimmer s instantaneous velocity is increased by shear thinning rheology but why is this effect enhanced during the recovery stroke when the spheres are further apart figure 12 shows the velocity of the swimmer relative to the newtonian case as a function of the viscosity differential at a moment during an effective stroke figure 12 a and a recovery stroke figure 12 b during the recovery stroke the velocity relative to the newtonian case is again approximately proportional to the viscosity differential the constant of proportionality is approximately half that for the najafi golestanian swimmer figure 8 which may be because there are twice as many propulsive elements however this proportionality fails during the effective stroke when the spheres are close to one another each sphere thins a significant region of fluid and these regions overlap substantially decreasing the effect of the viscosity differential this decrease is apparent when considering the shear index data in figure 12 a for low values of sh high shear is required to thin the flow thus the viscosity fields generated by the spheres that comprise the swimmer do not interact and the proportionality between the viscosity index and the increase in velocity is equal to that during the recovery stroke figure 12 b for which the spheres are further apart when the value of sh increases past a critical value despite increases in the viscosity differential velocity is in fact decreased after a further critical value the viscosity differential is in fact decreased by increasing sh the envelope of thinned fluid surrounding the swimmer during the effective stroke inhibits its progress increasing the shear index past the optimum increases the size of this envelope further hindering swim ming this result is consistent with the existence of an optimum value of sh for the progress of the najafi golestanian swimmer considered by montenegro johnson et al 28 thus in the limit of large separation between spheres the envelopes of thinned fluid surrounding each sphere do not interact and instantaneous velocity is approximately proportional to the viscosity differential if spheres are close enough to generate an envelope of thinned fluid surrounding the whole swimmer that envelope hinders swimming reducing the constant of proportionality between swimming velocity and the viscosity differential to examine the effects of the envelope of thinned fluid further we will now consider squirming models of ciliates 3 3 slip velocity squirmers much like sphere swimmers cilia utilized for locomotion typically beat with an asymmetric effective recovery stroke pattern 43 they perform an effective stroke when fully extended moving through the fluid perpendicular to their centerline and then recover by moving tangentially to their centerline figure 13 ciliated swimmers generally express a large number of cilia which beat with a phase difference between neighbors 44 examples are the protozoa opalina and paramecium 45 and the alga volvox carteri this type of swimming motivates envelope modeling approaches 46 whereby the array of cilia are represented by either a slip velocity condition on the cell surface or by small squirming deformations of the cell 11 a paddler

velocity squirmers are characterized by the coefficients n of the modes of their swimming the simplest two dimensional squirmer has a single mode i e n 0 for all n 2 this treadmilling squirmer has a radius r l 2 and generates a time independent tangential slip velocity in the body frame of u 1 2 sin on r l 2 12 a treadmilling squirmer is shown alongside an image of volvox carteri in figure 14 since swimmer kinematics and the fluid domain are symmetric about the line y 0 the squirmer swims purely in the positive x direction shear thinning decreases the velocity of this squirmer figure 15 this result draws an interesting parallel with the work of zhu et al 22 who found that spherical squirmers were also hindered by a different non newtonian fluid property viscoelasticity figure 15 c shows a striking apparently linear dependence of the swimming velocity upon the power law index n the decrease in velocity is small for 0 2 n 0 5 and sh 1 the velocity is reduced by a little over 3 the effective viscosity field of the flow has a simple form even relatively near to the swimmer contours of equi viscosity are approximately circular centered on the swimmer figure 16 however very near to the surface the fluid surrounding the propulsive elements of the treadmilling squirmer is relatively thicker than that surrounding the drag inducing portions thus the viscosity differential for this squirmer is positive yet its velocity is decreased by shear thinning demonstrating that slip velocity models differ from no slip multiple sphere swimmers in this respect the reduction in

different values of the power law index n the swimmer surface is given by r 0 5 b for fixed values of r the effective viscosity exhibits a near linear dependence upon the power law index n figure 17 shows the radial variation in the effective viscosity of the fluid surrounding the squirmer as n decreases the viscosity immediately surrounding the swimmer decreases but the rate at which the viscosity approaches the zero shear value increases as a result of this increase the size of the envelope of thinned fluid surrounding the swimmer varies little with changes in rheological parameters figure 17 a for any fixed value of the radial coordinate r with r 0 5 being the squirmer s surface the effective viscosity at that point decreases approximately linearly with n figure 17 b since the decrease in swimming velocity also exhibits a linear dependence upon the power law index n we examine the dependence of swimming velocity on the effective viscosity of the fluid surrounding the squirmer figure 18 a shows the decrease in swimming velocity relative to the newtonian case as a function of the effective viscosity of the fluid envelope at r 0 52 a small distance from the squirmer s surface for varying viscosity ratio shear index and power law index this figure demonstrates a strong linear correlation between the effective viscosity of the fluid a small distance from the swimmer s surface and the swimmer s velocity however whilst the absolute values of viscosity do not affect swimmers with prescribed kinematics the envelope of thinned fluid shields the far field flow from the flow generated by the squirmer as fluid becomes relatively thinner around the squirmer the decay rate of the near field flow increases this draws an interesting parallel with the work of zhu et al 22 who found a similar effect for viscoelastic giesekus fluids in the near field along the line 0 the velocity of the flow is approximately u a r log u loga log r 13 thus the flow decay rate is given by log u log r 14 close to the squirmer s surface the newtonian flow decay rate newt 1 95 figure 18 b shows the swimming velocity of the squirmer as a function of this decay rate at r 0 52 0 a small distance from the squirmer s surface relative to the newtonian case for varying rheological parameters 0 n and sh the decrease in velocity and increase in flow decay exhibit a linear relationship and are the same magnitude the slope of the curve is close to 1 this observation motivates the following argument the squirmer generates an envelope of thinned fluid around itself when swimming through carreau fluid this envelope increases the decay rate of flow away from the squirmer s surface thus prescribed motion on the surface moves relatively less fluid which decreases the swimming velocity however models of squirmers exhibiting surface velocity distribution may neglect effects arising from rheological interactions at the scale of individual cilia these interactions may be captured more effectively by squirming models for which the surface is subject to small deformations for many ciliates such as the protozoa opalina surface deformation provides a better

may be that rheologically enhanced propulsion at the cilium scale is captured by envelope models with surface deformation 3 4 monoflagellate pushers we will now examine the effects of shear thinning rheology on the swimming of a two dimensional model sperm with prescribed waveform since the trajectories of such swimmers are two dimensional we will analyze their shape using variables from computer aided semen analysis casa see for example mortimer 50 our usage will differ slightly in that casa variables are statistical averages over many beat cycles determined from video microscopy of living cells sampled at a given frequency whereas we will generate a smooth time periodic waveform and thus our parameters will be measured over a single beat the variables we will consider are demonstrated for an example trajectory over one beat cycle in figure 19 sperm do not exhibit an effective recovery stroke pattern but rather swim by propagating a travelling wave along the flagellum as such we now refer to a swimmer s progress as the distance between its start and end points over a beat we will also consider its straight line velocity vsl progress t and its curvilinear or instantaneous velocity vcl the velocity of the cell at any given point in time the amplitude of the cell s lateral head displacement alh is given by the difference between the maximum and minimum y values on the trajectory we also consider the path length pl of the trajectory that is the total distance travelled as well as the straightness of the path str progress pl 17 figure 20 a the flagellar waveform generated by

data in figure 22 these morphologies from top to bottom correspond with dark to light plots the swimmer is propelled by a single flagellum that propagates a bending wave along its length generating the forces required to move the cell forward we parameterize the flagellum in terms of its shear angle s t given in the body frame a shear angle of the form s t cs cos 2 ks t 15 represents a bending wave propagating down the flagellum steepening towards the less stiff distal end with a linear envelope this shear angle produces a waveform representative of sperm swimming in high viscosity fluids 31 shown in figure 20 the lab frame position of the flagellum is then given by rotating the centerline in the body frame by the swimmer s orientation and translating by the current head position length scales are normalized to the flagellum length so that one length unit corresponds to 55 m and one time unit corresponds to a single beat of the flagellum thus for a tail beating at 10 hz one time unit corresponds to 0 1 s montenegro johnson et al 28 showed that particular sperm like swimmer progressed further in shear thinning fluids in this study we will show that this behavior arises for other sperm like swimmers and examine the interplay between physical mechanisms and morphological changes in swimming trajectory that cause it we will examine the trajectories of swimmers with waveforms generated by the shear angle 15 for maximum shear angle a 0 45 and wavenumber k 2 5 i e 2 5 waves on the flagellum we have also examined waveforms produced by other parameter values and found that the effects of shear thinning were consistent for all values considered the cell head will be given by an ellipse of fixed eccentricity but different area given in table 3 figure 21 shows the trajectories of an example sperm for three values of the viscosity ratio from this figure it is apparent that shear thinning increases the progress of sperm like swimmers significantly for 0 4 n 0 5 and sh 1 this increase is around 40 over the newtonian case however it is not immediately apparent how much of the increase in progress is associated with increased path straightness str and how much arises from increased instantaneous velocity vcl figure 22 demonstrates the effects of shear thinning on the shape of the swimming trajectory for sperm with the three different head sizes given in table 3 the trajectories that these swimmers with different head sizes follow in stokes flow are shown in figure 22 a showing that increasing head size 18 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 10 3 8 6 4 2 0 2 10 3 x

shown in figure 22 e which is apparent when the trajectories of a single swimmer with ax 0 05 and ay 0 04 for various values of the viscosity ratio are plotted together figure 21 these effects are robust to morphological and kinematic changes varying the eccentricity of the cell head or the wavenumber changes the swimmer s trajectory but the rheological effects that we show are consistent with changes in these parameters to understand the increase in cell progress we will now examine the viscosity field surrounding the swimmer and the force generated by the flagellum the viscosity field surrounding the swimmer is shown for four values of the shear index sh in figure 23 fluid is thickest around the cell head and there is a gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum as well as the slightly less obvious feature of a gradient of thick to thin fluid across the swimmer which alternates in sign at local maxima of the shear angle as sh is increased to an optimum value these gradients are enhanced after which they decrease because the fluid becomes thinned substantially at the head end of the flagellum montenegro johnson et al 28 found an optimal value of sh for a particular sperm like swimmer s progress we now find that this optimal progress is associated with maximal gradients along the flagellum we examine the forces exerted by the flagellum on the fluid at five equally spaced instants over half its beat cycle for varying viscosity ratio at each moment the gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum that arises in shear thinning fluids entails that forces generated in the proximal near to head portion of the flagellum have greater magnitude relative to those in the distal near to tip portion when compared to the newtonian case figure 24 thus shear thinning induces a redistribution of force from the distal to the proximal end of the flagellum this redistribution has the effect of making the force distribution more symmetric about the body axis and thus straightens the trajectory this effect is shown in figure 25 where the magnitude and direction of swimming have been plotted for a sperm aligned with the negative x axis at times t 0 0 1 0 4 for changing values of the viscosity ratio figure 25 also demonstrates the increase in the magnitude of instantaneous velocity resulting from shear thinning rheology the increased instantaneous velocity acts in concert with the straightened path to yield significant increases in progress 4 discussion we have analyzed the effects of shear thinning rheology on three distinct classes of microscopic swimmer with prescribed kinematics in carreau fluid this continuum approach to modeling biological fluids may not be appropriate when the swimmer and the suspended fibers are of a comparable length as with bacteria in mucus 12 but it can still provide insight into important effects whilst our modeling is two dimensional the observed physical effects are likely to be present for three dimensional swimmers sliding spheres exert stresses on the fluid thereby thinning a surround ing envelope the najafi golestanian swimmer payload travels more slowly through the fluid than its propulsive sphere consequently fluid surrounding the propulsive sphere is thinned more than fluid surrounding the payload spheres resulting in a decrease in instantaneous velocity by contrast the paddler payload moves more quickly through the fluid than the propulsive elements fluid around the payload is relatively thinner thereby increasing instantaneous velocity the relatively higher decay rate of three dimensional flow will be associated with an increased decay of the viscosity field around each 19 a 0 025 0 02 0 015 0 01 0 005 0 10 3 8 6 4 2 0 2 10 3 x y area 0 0016 area 0 0020 area 0

speed asymmetric paddler eff rec pusher eff rec puller figure 26 reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers that cannot progress through inertialess newtonian fluid but may progress through inertialess carreau fluid these swimmers are pusher and puller versions of a the najafi golestanian swimmer and b the paddler showing the effective and recovery strokes with an indication of the velocity of the propulsive sphere solid arrow and the magnitude and direction of progress over each stroke dashed arrow sphere this decay will in turn reduce the asymmetry between the effects of shear thinning on the ef fective and recovery strokes so while shear thinning will decrease both the progress and regress of a najafi golestanian swimmer we therefore predict that the increase in net progress will be relatively less than for an equivalent two dimensional swimmer the squirmer in three dimensions will again thin an envelope of surrounding fluid enhancing flow decay rate and thereby decreasing swimming velocity in shear thinning fluids for sperm like swimmers the prescribed waveforms we considered increase in velocity to the distal portion of the flagellum and are therefore likely to generate a gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum as in the two dimensional case however in three dimensions fluid can also pass over the flagellum and so this gradient may be reduced the effects found also give insight into sliding sphere swimmers that may violate purcell s scallop theorem since the instantaneous velocity of the sliding sphere swimmers analyzed is approximately proportional to the viscosity differential an asymmetry between the body frame speed of effective and recovery strokes should allow a reciprocal swimmer to progress through inertialess carreau fluid net progress is made possible because faster motion thins the fluid to a greater extent thereby inducing an asymmetry between the effective and recovery flow viscosity fields in newtonian fluid no such asymmetry arises and due to the time independence in the governing equations such reciprocal motion will not result in net progress two such reciprocal swimmers may be formed from each of the najafi golestanian swimmer and the three sphere paddler as shown in figure 26 we refer to these models as the speed asymmetric collinear swimmer and paddler respectively for each speed asymmetric swimmer a pusher and puller version of the swimmer may be modeled pushers are swimmers whose payload is pushed from behind such as most animal sperm whereas pullers such as algae are pulled from the front the net propulsion due to stroke speed asymmetry is however very slight for the speed asymmetric collinear pusher described in table 4 simulations in a channel of length 20 l were performed to minimize boundary truncation effects and for fixed sh 1 0 2 net progress over a beat was maximized at 0 001 l for n 0 7 which is approximately 0 2 of the body frame beat amplitude this is in contrast to the najafi golestanian swimmer given in table 1 which progresses approximately 10 of its amplitude per beat the difference between pushers and pullers was not discernible to within the resolution of our method instead of a kinematic description sliding sphere swimmers may also be defined in terms of a pre scribed force whilst we will not fully examine this question in this work it is interesting to consider how shear thinning would affect such a swimmer the above reasoning and methodology can be used to provide insight into these effects for example during the effective stroke of a najafi golestanian swim mer the swimming arm exerts a prescribed force on the fluid which is independent of viscosity by force balance this propulsive force is equal to the drag force on the payload however in shear thinning fluid 23 speed asymmetric collinear pusher stroke x 1 x 2 x 3 time t eff d a 8 at 3 0 d a 0 3 4 rec d a 8 a t 3 4 0 d a 3 4 1 table 4 the body frame positions of the three spheres of the speed asymmetric collinear pusher over its effective stroke which lasts for 3 4 of the beat period and the recovery stroke which lasts for 1 4 of the beat period the payload thins an envelope of surrounding fluid which decreases is drag coefficient thereby increasing the swimming speed for a given drag force thus our results suggest that the instantaneous velocity of a prescribed force najafi golestanian swimmer may increase with shear thinning the opposite behavior to that of the prescribed kinematic swimmer more complex regulation of swimmer beating will be an interesting avenue of future research 5 conclusions shear thinning is an important property of many biological fluids in this paper we found that its effects upon microscopic swimmers are highly sensitive to the swimming stroke employed the collinear sliding sphere swimmer experiences decreases in instantaneous velocity during both effective and recovery strokes but increases in net progress the opposite effect occurs for the paddler a slip velocity squirmer was hindered by shear thinning and sperm like swimmers were aided by it the magnitudes of these effects were small of order 3 for sliding sphere swimmers and squirmers but could be larger of order 10 for sperm like swimmers the effects of shear thinning on sliding sphere swimmers can be understood by considering the vis cosity differential provided the spheres are sufficiently separated positive viscosity differential entails thicker fluid around the propulsive spheres relative to the payload increasing instantaneous velocity and vice versa when spheres are closer together the envelope of thinned fluid surrounding the swimmer hinders swimming as with the squirmer this envelope resulted in a smaller increase in velocity during the effective stroke than during the recovery stroke of the paddler reducing net progress the same ef fect induced a greater decrease in velocity during the recovery stroke of the najafi golestanian swimmer increasing net progress the envelope of thinned fluid surrounding the squirmer was shown to reduce the swimmer s instan taneous velocity this reduction was associated with enhanced flow decay within the thinned envelope however the envelope approach of time averaging the coordinated action of many cilia into a surface slip velocity might neglect rheological interactions that occur on the scale of each cilium and thus it may be desirable in the future to consider squirming models exhibiting small surface deformations or models incorporating discrete cilia sperm like swimmers induced a gradient of thick to thin fluid along their flagellum which was as sociated with both a flattening of the swimming trajectory and an increase in instantaneous velocity these effects were complementary leading to significant increases in progress per beat finally we suggested two model reciprocal swimmers comprising sliding spheres which achieve pro gression through carreau fluid by manipulating the viscosity differential this effect results from speed asymmetry between the effective and recovery strokes however the net progress achieved over a beat is slight the net progress of the speed asymmetric collinear pusher considered was approximately 0 2 of the body frame beat amplitude in contrast to 10 for the najafi golestanian swimmer the viscosity differential rheologically enhanced flow decay and surface gradients of viscosity pro vide insight into the effects of shear thinning on microswimmers while idealized our models show that shear thinning has both significant and subtle

boundary in terms of arclength s the outer boundary is discretized by 60 equal length constant force elements 51 which correspond to the edge elements of the finite element mesh each element comprises 210 quadrature points the force per unit length exerted by each element on the fluid is constant and the regularization of the boundary stokeslets 1 0 001 the outer boundary is given the no slip velocity condition udir 0 a single regularized stokeslet with 2 0 1 is placed at the origin where the velocity is specified to be u 1 0 giving a total of 61 degrees of freedom calculating the fluid flow in the domain with the method of regularized stokeslets is a two stage process firstly forces are calculated by specifying velocities for each element and the central stokeslet and inverting a matrix system then these forces are used to calculate the flow at each point in the finite element mesh in contrast the method of femlets calculates the forces and flow simulataneously and thus entails 7042 degrees of freedom for this example here we implement the method of femlets with the same regularized stokeslet cut off function 16 and dirichlet conditions are specified on the outer boundary figure 27 a shows the speed of the flow driven by the immersed force over the whole domain as calculated by the method of femlets while figure 27 b shows the absolute difference between the femlet and regularized stokeslet calculations of the speed as evaluated at the finite element mesh points the difference is o 10 4 which is within acceptable accuracy hence we conclude that the method of femlets satisfactorily calculates the forces required to drive a specified flow we also wish to check that as the regularization of femlets is decreased the femlet solution converges to that of an equivalent moving boundary for the two dimensional treadmilling squirmer of radius r l 2 with slip velocity u a sin on r l 2 in infinite fluid the swimming velocity is given by u a 252 whilst the
