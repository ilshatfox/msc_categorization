03807 cond mat stat mech abstract the quasi diagonal direct interaction approximation qdia closure equations are formulated for inhomogeneous classical and quantum fields interacting through dynamical equations with quadratic nonlinearity and with first or second order time derivatives associated more complex inhomogeneous dia and self energy closure equations are expounded as part of the derivation the qdia employs a bare vertex approximation and is only a few times more computationally intensive than the homogeneous dia examples of applications to turbulent classical geophysical and navier stokes fluids including non gaussian noise to classical and quantum klein gordon equations with 3 g lagrangian interaction and to coupled field auxiliary field equations associated with 4 lagrangian interaction are presented keywords inhomogeneous closures classical fields quantum fields non equilibrium statistical dynamics 1 introduction statistical dynamical closure theories for classical and quantum fields were initially developed somewhat independently very elegant and general formalisms for quantum fields particularly quantum electrodynamics were formulated through the functional equations of tomonaga 1946 and schwinger 1948 a b 1951 a b c 1953 and the equivalent diagrammatic techniques of feynman 1949 see also dyson 1949 in classical statistical fluid dynamics the development of the direct interaction approximation dia for homogeneous turbulence by kraichnan 1959 was a pioneering advance the dia is a bare vertex approximation bva for non equilibrium and time dependent fluids while the quantum field theories included more general interactions but were concerned primarily with scattering and with equilibrium and in out states wyld 1961 and lee 1965 used a diagrammatic approach that led to statistical dynamical equations for classical fluid dynamics and magneto hydrodynamics to fourth and sixth order in perturbation theory respectively and thus included vertex corrections martin siggia 2 and rose 1973 hereafter msr generalized schwinger s functional formalism to time dependent classical fields they recognized that the formalism needed to include the adjoint equation for the classical field in order to represent the response function that in general is not related to the two time covariance through the fluctuation dissipation theorem msr argued that their formalism produced additional vertex functions to those of wyld 1961 however recently berera et al 2013 have found on correcting some minor errors in both the diagrammatic and functional formalisms that they indeed agree to fourth order rose 1974 generalized the msr formalism to include additive random forcing and showed that non gaussian noise and non gaussian initial conditions could be included with additional interactions through so called spurious vertices the feynman path integral formulation feynman and hibbs 1965 was subsequently used to further generalize the msr formalism for classical systems to more complex interactions and additive and multiplicative random forces by phythian 1977 and jensen 1981 see also krommes 2002 in the early days of strong interaction hadron particle physics there was a focus on obtaining closure for the scattering amplitude between in and out states through dispersion relations such as the mandelstam 1958 1959 double spectral representation barut 1967 frederiksen 1975 frederiksen et al 1975 atkinson et al 1976 the analyticity properties of scattering amplitudes were determined through cutkosky 1960 rules and consistency of the mandelstam representation with feynman graphs within 3 g theory was also established directly frederiksen and woolcock 1973 a b frederiksen 1974 a b these approaches are still employed such as in the recent study of light by light hadronic scattering by colangelo et al 2015 in the case of classical high reynolds number strongly turbulent flows the focus has until recently been on homogeneous and generally isotropic turbulence mccomb 2014 which is a somewhat idealized problem but it does highlight some of the essential issues of this complex field kraichnan s 1959 pioneering work on the dia closure theory was followed by related but independently developed non markovian closures by herring 1965 and mccomb 1974 1990 these so called self consistent field theory scft and local energy transfer theory let closures have subsequently been shown to differ from the dia only in how a fluctuation dissipation theorem is invoked frederiksen et al 1994 frederiksen and davies 2000 kiyani and mccomb 2004 the scft and let closures have very similar performance to the dia for homogeneous turbulence at finite reynolds number frederiksen et al 1994 frederiksen and davies 2000 over the last two decades there has been increased interest in time dependent non equilibrium quantum field theories berges 2004 calzetta and hu 2008 berges 2016 with applications to bose einstein condensation far from equilibrium gasenzer 2009 berges and sexty 2012 cosmology and inflation kofman et al 1997 micha and tkachev 2003 kofman 2008 and quark gluon plasma arnold 2007 in these problems it is necessary to allow for the evolution of quantum fluctuations in a background of dynamical spatially inhomogeneous fields the statistical dynamical equations for these problems are typically formulated using the closed time path ctp formalism of schwinger 1961 and keldysh 1965 the relationship between the schwinger keldysh ctp formalism for time dependent quantum fields and the msr formalism for classical fields was established by cooper et al 2001 they noted that the two formalisms gave the same statistical equations in the case of quadratic nonlinearity cubic lagrangian but with extra vertices and different initial conditions in the quantum case berges 3 and ganzer 2007 also examined the relationships between the schwinger keldysh ctp formalism for quantum systems and the msr and lagrangian path integral formalisms for classical systems they compared the evolution of a classical bose gas with the quantum counterpart some studies have used models in one space dimension aarts and berges 2002 cooper et al 2003 boyanovsky et al 2004 or two space dimensions juchem et al 2004 for the spatially homogeneous problem or in the case of the inhomogeneous problem for 4 theory have used the simplified hartree approximation bettencourt et al 2001 many studies have also focused on the classical limit of the quantum theories aarts and smit 1998 blagoev et al 2001 which is restricted to the early stages of evolution berges 2016 blagoev et al 2001 and cooper et al 2003 find that the dia or their term the bva performs better than the two particle irreducible 2 pi 1 n expansion and much better than the hartree approximation some studies berges et al 2003 cooper et al 2005 arrizabalaga et al 2005 have also considered three space dimensions for the spatially homogeneous problem with or without symmetry breaking and mean fields the development of general and elegant formalisms for describing the statistical dynamics of both quantum and classical fields has been an impressive achievement however the numerical solution of the above formulations of statistical dynamical equations for inhomogeneous fields in several dimensions poses severe computational challenges this is the case even in the bare vertex approximation such as for kraichnan s 1964 1972 inhomogeneous dia idia which has not been numerically implemented indeed at the time kraichnan recognized that it was computationally intractable at any reasonable resolution a computationally tractable inhomogeneous non markovian closure theory termed the quasi diagonal direct interaction approximation qdia was formulated by frederiksen 1999 for two dimensional turbulent flow over topography this required a different method of deriving the renormalized statistical dynamical equations from the methods described above in this alternative approach the two point functions are taken as homogeneous diagonal in fourier space to zero order in perturbation theory and the first order off diagonal elements of the covariance and response functions are expressed in terms of the diagonal elements and the mean fields and topography the first and second order statistical qdia equations are then formally renormalized the theory has also been generalized to inhomogeneous rossby wave turbulence frederiksen and o kane 2005 and to general classical field theories with quadratic nonlinearity including quasi geostrophic qg baroclinic and three dimensional inhomogeneous turbulence with general mean fields frederiksen 2012 a b these equations are first order in the tendency or time derivative the qdia statistical closure is only a few times more computationally intensive than the homogeneous dia unlike kraichnan s 1964 1972 inhomogeneous idia and related bare vertex approximation closures for inhomogeneous quantum fields this has been established in statistical dynamical studies by o kane and frederiksen 2004 and frederiksen and o kane 2005 where the qdia was implemented numerically for turbulent flows on an f plane non rotating flows and plane differentially rotating flows respectively in particular frederiksen and o kane 2005 studied rossby wave dispersion due to eastward zonal flows impinging on an isolated topographic feature in a moderate reynolds number turbulent environment they found pattern correlations between the qdia and an ensemble of 1800 direct numerical simulations to be as high as 0 9999 for the mean rossby wave trains 4 in 10 day simulations this level of agreement is remarkable for this is a far from equilibrium process that severely tests the closure performance the qdia closure has been further extensively tested and applied to problems in predictability frederiksen and o kane 2005 o kane and frederiksen 2008 a data assimilation o kane and frederiksen 2008 b and subgrid modeling o kane and frederiksen 2008 c frederiksen and o kane 2008 the performance of the qdia has been enhanced o kane and frederiksen 2004 frederiksen and o kane 2005 through a cumulant update restart procedure rose 1985 that employs non gaussian initial conditions as in earlier studies with homogeneous non markovian closures frederiksen et al 1994 frederiksen and davies 2000 2004 in the case of high reynolds number turbulence a regularized version of the qdia employs a one parameter empirical vertex renormalization as for homogeneous turbulence frederiksen and davies 2004 that ensures the right power law behavior o kane and frederiksen 2004 the aim of this article is to generalize the qdia closure theory to equations that are second order in the tendency or time derivative such as the klein gordon equation and to incorporate non gaussian noise effects and quantum effects the focus is on equations with quadratic nonlinearity in the field equations cubic in the lagrangian although higher order interactions may also be covered such as for 4 lagrangian theories in the auxiliary field formulation blagoev et al 2001 bender et al 1977 the plan of this paper is as follows in section 2 we document the general form of the stochastic differential equations which are first or second order in the tendency that are considered in the article in the case of classical fluid dynamics specific examples are for geophysical turbulent flows described by the quasi geostrophic equations and for three dimensional turbulence described by the navier stokes equations as well the second order tendency klein gordon equations for classical and quantum fields interacting through a 3 g lagrangian term and coupled field auxiliary field equations associated with a 4 lagrangian are considered the general form of the dynamical equations in fourier momentum space is also presented the inhomogeneous idia closure equations that correspond to a bare vertex approximation are formulated in section 3 and the inclusion of non gaussian noise effects is considered in section 4 in section 5 the inhomogeneous self energy se closure equations are derived as modifications of the idia that are second order in the interaction coefficient coupling constant in both the mean field equation as well as in the two point equations for the covariance and response function in section 6 the more computationally efficient qdia closure equations are obtained from the self energy closure by assuming that to lowest order the fields are homogeneous or diagonal in fourier space the off diagonal components of the two point functions are expressed in terms of the diagonal components and the mean field and possibly topography the full qdia closure equations for the particular example of scalar fields interacting through a 3 g lagrangian term are presented in section 7 there the substitutions required for obtaining the qdia closure for the coupled field auxiliary field equations associated with a 4 lagrangian from the general theory in section 6 are also presented in section 8 we summarize the conclusions and discuss applications and restart procedures the functional equations of msr and the path integral approach of jensen 1981 are summarized in appendix a there the inclusion of non gaussian noise and non gaussian initial conditions is also considered in appendix b a derivation relating the first order inhomogeneous elements of the two point functions to the mean field and topography needed for the self energy and qdia closures is presented 5 2 equations for inhomogeneous classical and quantum fields the statistical closure equations formulated in this paper apply to a wide variety of classical and quantum field theories with quadratic nonlinearity we consider stochastic differential equations that are first or second order in the tendency of the form 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 321 1 u uu t n n 2 1 with 2 or 1 n here 1 is a multicomponent field with initial condition 1 0 and 1 1111 tta 1 x is a short hand notation for the time 1 t space or spectral space 1 x and indices 1 a representing for example different fields or fields at different levels first order tendency equations of the form 2 1 were considered by msr and jensen 1981 in the path integral formalism of jensen 1981 the variables 1 1 1 iuiuiu iii consist of a mean deterministic part 1 iu i and a random part 1 iu i we assume without loss of generality that 2 3 1 3 2 1 33 uu as well 1 1 1 000 where again 1 0 is deterministic and 1 0 is random summation over repeated discrete indices and integration over repeated continuous variables is assumed next we present a few examples of interest in fluid dynamics and non equilibrium quantum field theories 2 1 classical fields described by first order tendency equations kraichnan s 1959 1964 1972 homogeneous dia and inhomogeneous idia and related statistical closures and the msr formalism and classical path integral formalisms phythian 1977 jensen 1981 have focused on first order tendency equations for classical fluid dynamics of particular interest have been the equations for navier stokes turbulence in two and three dimensions and the quasi geostrophic equations for geophysical fluid dynamics 2 1 a quasi geostrophic equations for turbulent flow taking suitable length and time scales the non dimensional equation for 2 level baroclinic quasi geostrophic flow over topography on an f plane may be written in the form 00 ababaaa a fqdhqj t q 2 2 a here 2 or 1 a a is the streamfunction and 1 212 l aaa fq is the reduced potential vorticity aa 2 is the relative vorticity 0 12 hhh where h is the scaled topography abd 0 are dissipation operators and af 0 are forcing functions also lf is the layer coupling parameter frederiksen 2012 a which is inversely proportional to the static stability in planar geometry 6 xyyx j 2 2 b where yx x is the position and t is time 2 1 b navier stokes equations for three dimensional turbulent flow the navies stokes equations for three dimensional inhomogeneous turbulent flow may be written in the form mccomb 1990 1 0 2 0 aa a a

functions 2 1 c general form of first order tendency equations the quasi geostrophic equations for geophysical flow and the navier stokes equations are examples of first order tendency classical equations that are quadratic in the field variables and for which the msr and classical path integral formalisms may be applied directly to yield statistical dynamical equations msr write their equations for the field and its adjoint as in eq a 5 or in component form 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 222 32 1221 32 1212 32 1 211 32 122 2 21 2 2 1 1 t 2 4 with adjoint equation 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 111 32 1112 32 1121 32 1 122 32 111 2 12 2 1 1 1 t 2 5 here 1 is the dynamical field and 1 the adjoint these equations are further described in appendix a where the relationships between the and u coefficients are also discussed in particular the vertex 2223 accounts for non gaussian noise or quantum effects as also noted in appendix a for 321 and the first superscript refers to the conjugate spinor field while the later superscripts refer to the correct spinor field this choice within the msr and jensen 1981 formalisms related to the pauli matrices eq a 2 should be noted as it is somewhat counter intuitive examples of the parameters 321 and for three dimensional navier stokes flows and quasi geostrophic turbulence are given in frederiksen 2012 a b 2 2 second order tendency klein gordon equation for classical and quantum fields cooper et al 2001 show that the first order tendency msr and classical path integral formalisms can also be applied to second order tendency or time derivative equations like the klein gordon equation this is done by rewriting the second order tendency equations in terms of the fields 1 and 7 the canonical momentum fields 1 1 1 t they also show that the msr and path integral formalisms can be written directly in a covariant second order tendency form and are related to the schwinger keldysh closed time path ctp formalism for quantum dynamics apart from initial conditions and extra vertices for quantum effects 2 2 a lagrangian with interaction 3 g the msr and path integral formalisms can be applied directly in second order in time covariant form for general 3 g theories as noted by cooper et al 2001 the only difference in the associated statistical equations are the addition of extra vertices for the quantum case based on the ctp formalism in this respect the statistical equations for quantum field theories are analogous to those of classical field theories with non gaussian noise as we explore in more detail cooper et al 2001 eq 38 give the lagrangian for a multi field model of the 3 g theory in second order tendency form their formalism has the time derivative and nonlinear term on the same side of the equation unlike our eq 2 1 for our parallel development of the statistical dynamical equations for first and second order tendency equations it is however more convenient to keep the form 2 1 which changes the sign of the 3 u and 3 vertices from those of cooper et al 2001 and blagoev et al 2001 in terms of the field 1 and the adjoint of the canonical momentum field 1 our dynamical equations are 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 222 32 1221 32 1212 32 1 211 32 122 2 21 2 2 12 1 2 t 2 6 and 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 111 32 1112 32 1121 32 1 122 32 111 2 12 2 1 12 1 2 t 2 7 the formulation of these equations is further documented in appendix a for example in the case of a single quantum field the dynamical equations obtained from the schwinger keldysh ctp formalism schwinger 1961 keldysh 1965 can be written in the form 22 2 2 22 8 12 2 122 2 2 jgm t jggm t h 2 8 here the right hand sides represent sources m is the mass and g is the coupling constant with 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 31 21 1223 121 3 211 3 g 2 9 a also we note that the classical equations are the same as the above quantum equations apart from the term 28 1 hg where h is planck s constant over 2 with 8 3 2 1 31 21 2223 2 4 1 hg 2 9 b the other three point vertices in eqs 2 6 and 2 7 vanish here 21 212121 ttaa xx 2 9 c where denotes the kronecker delta function for discrete indices and the dirac delta function for continuous variables of course the initial conditions for classical and quantum systems will differ cooper et al 2001 the qdia statistical closure equations for this 3 g field theory are detailed in section 7 1 2 2 b coupled field auxiliary field equations associated with 4 lagrangian interaction blagoev et al 2001 consider dynamical equations for coupled quadratic interactions cubic lagrangian between a scalar field and an auxiliary field that can be related to the cubic self interaction of within a 4 lagrangian interaction theory in their auxiliary field formulation the equations for a single field and auxiliary field take the form 22 2 2 22 2 2 22 8 12 2 122 2 2 2 4 122 2 2 jgm t jggm t jggm t jggm t h h 2 10 a again the right hand sides represent sources g is a coupling parameter m and m are mass parameters the classical equations are the same as the above quantum equations apart from the terms proportional to 2 hg as also noted by blagoev et al 2001 after determining statistical closure equations associated with eq 2 10 a the composite limit their eq a 24 with jsjj but with 02 m missing must be taken that is 22 12 tt xx 2 10 b 1 0 12122 jgmm 2 10 c as well the bare retarded propagator or response function for the field is replaced by tt xx here is the mass and is the coupling constant for the 4 theory these equations can also be generalized to multiple fields cooper et al 2003 with 1 tttt na xxxx the field equations again take the form in equations 2 6 and 2 7 the scope of the current study is to focus on equations that are quadratic in the interactions with cubic interactions quartic lagrangian for consideration in future work however we shall use the 9 auxiliary field equations as an example of the more complex structure of the qdia inhomogeneous closure equations when several fields are coupled this is discussed in section 7 2 2 3 dynamical equations in spectral space the dynamical equations summarized in this section and the statistical equations of appendix a can equally be formulated in fourier or other spectral spaces frederiksen 2012 b and references therein here we consider the discrete fourier transform of the equations but the continuum fourier transform kraichnan 1959 carnevale and frederiksen 1983 could equally be employed in spectral space the equation corresponding to eq 2 1 can be obtained through the fourier transforms 1 1 1 1 exp 1 1111 k k xkx itt aa 2 11 a where exp 2 1 2 o ad d a itdt xkxxk 2 11 b and d is the dimension for example the position zyx x and wave number zyx kkk k for the case when the dimension 3 d here we have assumed that suitable length scales are used so that the domain in eq 2 11 b is between 2 and 0 the wave number cut offs in eq 2 11 a are to be specified in simulations and statistical calculations and need to be suitably chosen together with the renormalized parameters like viscosities forcing masses etc as discussed in section 8 we begin by considering a set of general classical dynamical equations in spectral form 0 0 tfhtattk tdt t acbabccbabc aa n n kqpkqpkqpk kk

kraichnan s 1964 1972 inhomogeneous idia statistical equations for classical fields were derived through a formal series reversion approach before being put on a firmer foundation by the msr formalism and the path integral formalism phythian 1977 jensen 1981 they are essentially the equations for the mean flow and a measure of the fluctuations two point function obtained by reynolds averaging mccomb 1990 the idia closes the equations by expressing the three point function in terms of the two point functions a summary of the derivation following jensen 1981 is given in appendix a including the effects of non gaussian noise and non gaussian initial conditions initially we postpone consideration of non gaussian noise effects and related quantum effects until section 4 we also represent the statistical equations in fourier space for comparison with the much more efficient qdia closure equations in section 6 the qdia equations were derived directly frederiksen 1999 2012 a for first order tendency equations but it is probably more enlightening to see how in section 5 the idia equations can be modified to form the self energy closure equations frederiksen 2012 b and from these the qdia emerge through diagonal dominance in spectral space in section 6 the idia self energy and qdia statistical closure equations are realizable with underpinning generalized langevin equations frederiksen 2012 a b and references therein the same applies for second order tendency equations we now consider an ensemble of simulations and express the field component for a given realization by aaa kkk 3 1 where ak is the ensemble mean and a k denotes the deviation from the ensemble mean the spectral equation 2 12 can then be expressed in terms of ak and a k as follows 0 0 tfhta ttcttk tdt t

self energy nonlinear noise nonlinear noise self energy and prescribed random forcing 4 non gaussian noise and spurious vertices next we consider the inclusion of non gaussian noise the msr formalism only allowed for gaussian initial conditions and did not include random terms although gaussian random forcing was added in a somewhat ad hoc way rose 1974 considered additive random noise and random initial conditions and found that the msr formalism could then be extended by replacing the vertices 2 i by 22 ii here i can be any positive integer but for consistency with the dia it runs between 1 and 3 also is a sequence of 1 i values of 1 and is a sequence of 1 i values of 2 rose 1974 called the vertices 2 i spurious vertices jensen 1981 using the path integral formalism included general random terms as noted following eq 2 1 and discussed in more detail in appendix a sections 9 2 and 9 3 as noted there the spurious vertex 2223 results in an addition to the self energy we shall be

just in the single time covariance equation as an extra term 0 lkkk ttf a for now we shall leave the possibility of general gaussian noise and the spurious vertex contributed by quantum effects 5 self energy closure equations there are important structural differences between the idia closure equations and the msr and path integral closure equations and the qdia closure equations as noted by frederiksen 2012 b in the idia and msr and path integral formalisms the mean field equation is formally exact if the single time covariance were known the covariance and response function equations are however only approximate to a certain order in perturbation theory or interaction coefficient coupling constant with this being second order for the idia when the second order idia covariance is inserted in the mean field equation it then becomes third order in the interaction coefficient in contrast in the qdia closure both the mean field equation and the diagonal two point covariance and response function equations are second order in the interaction coefficient or bare vertex function in the qdia the transient eddy eddy interaction is expressed in terms of self energies in covariance and response function equations and importantly as well in the mean field equation this is not the case for the idia mean field equation the qdia closure allows unambiguous identification of the self energy terms that renormalize the prescribed viscosity and forcing terms in the mean field equation as well as in the covariance and response function equations next we summarize the self energy closure equations including contributions from non gaussian noise the self energy has similar complexity of interactions to the idia but the mean field equation as well as the two point equations are second order in the bare vertex as in the qdia closure all the transient eddy eddy interactions are expressed in terms of self energies 5 1 statistical closure equations the self energy closure equations may be obtained from the idia equations by using the first order expression for the covariance in eq b 9 to replace the single time two point cumulant ttc bc qp in the mean field equation 3 2 and the two time cumulant ttc bc qp in the covariance equation 3 10 firstly using eq b 9 in eq 3 2 leads to the expression t t a t t a t t cbabc bcabc oo o stdshsstds skha stcstrdsk ttck 2 2 kkk k

again in the presence of non gaussian noise 3 point function the self energy equations hold with eq 3 12 replaced by eq 4 3 6 inhomogeneous qdia closure equations the qdia closure equations were derived directly through perturbation theory and formal renormalization frederiksen 1999 2012 a for the case of equations that are first order in the tendency 17 however it is probably instructive to make the connection between the qdia and the idia closure and msr and path integral formalisms by obtaining it as a simplification of the self energy closure of section 5 6 1 statistical closure

section 6 then applies for the coupled quadratic interactions between a scalar field and an auxiliary field given in eq 2 10 a the direct statistical dynamical analysis of 4 lagrangian field theories and comparison with the auxiliary field approach where the bare propagator for the field needs to be replaced section 2 2 b prior to renormalization is to be considered in future work 8 discussion and conclusions we have summarized the derivation of the inhomogeneous idia equations for classical field theories including non gaussian additive noise and for quantum field theories that have quadratic nonlinearity cubic lagrangian and are first or second order in the tendency our approach has used results from the msr path integral and schwinger keldysh ctp formulations in these approaches the mean field equations would be exact if the single time covariance were known in the idia the covariance and response function equations are second order in the interaction coefficient or coupling constant with the mean field equation then becoming third order in the interaction coefficient as well the renormalization of some terms in the idia is not as transparent as in the qdia closure here we explore the relationships between the idia and qdia closure by first modifying the idia to form the self energy closure the self energy closure has a similar structure to the qdia in that the nonlinear interactions are expressed in terms of self energy terms and the self energy closure equations are also second order in the interaction coefficient the qdia has then been derived by assuming that to lowest order the covariances and response functions are diagonal in fourier space the inhomogeneous qdia closure equations are much more efficient to compute that the idia in the numerical implementation the resolution or wavenumber momentum space cut off must be specified self consistently with specified parameters for the viscosity and forcing or the masses and sources the general subgrid modelling problem has been formulated for the qdia frederiksen 1999 2012 a and self energy frederiksen 2012 b closures it may also be necessary to regularize the qdia by using an empirically determined vertex renormalization frederiksen and davies 2004 o kane and 23 frederiksen 2004 for quantum field theories cooper et al 2004 also note the need for vertex renormalizations in dimensions greater than 2 space and 1 time 2 1 dimensions in applications to classical fluids considerable work has been devoted to establishing relationships between the resolution or cut off and the required renormalized viscosities and stochastic backscatter frederiksen and davies 1997 frederiksen and kepert 2006 o kane and frederiksen 2008 frederiksen and o kane 2008 zidikheri and frederiksen 2009 2010 a b indeed for geophysical fluids of the atmosphere and ocean described by quasi geostrophic equations universal scaling laws with cut off dependence have been established for the renormalized viscosities and backscatter kitsios et al 2012 2013 2016 frederiksen et al 2017 again for quantum fields the relationships between the cut off and renormalized parameters have been studied in many works e g cooper et al 2004 arrizabalaga et al 2005 berges and wallisch 2017 in the case of the first order tendency qdia closure equations the numerical solutions have been made more efficient by using a restart procedure in which the time history integrals are periodically truncated the three point cumulant is calculated and employed to specify the non gaussian initial conditions in the next integration rose 1985 frederiksen et al 1994 frederiksen and davies 2000 o kane and frederiksen 2004 frederiksen and o kane 2005 in appendix a section 9 3 we have outlined how non gaussian initial conditions may be included in the path integral formalism and in the idia however for the sake of brevity we have not set up a restart procedure here for the second order tendency qdia closure equations interestingly juchem et al 2004 prefer to solve second order tendency statistical equations as a larger system of first order tendency equations in terms of the fields 1 and the canonical momentum fields 1 1 1 t in that case the restart procedure for the qdia follows exactly as in o kane and frederiksen 2004 and frederiksen and o kane 2005 resulting in the more efficient cumulant update versions of the equations the qdia closure offers a computationally tractable means of studying the classical and quantum statistical dynamics of time dependent non equilibrium inhomogeneous

9 appendix a functional formalism the statistical closure equations are formulated using the schwinger dyson approach of msr and the feynman path integral method of jensen 1981 9 1 dynamical and statistical dynamical equations we consider stochastic differential equations of the form in eq 2 1 msr realized that an equation for the adjoint was also needed for generating the corresponding formalism to the schwinger dyson approach to quantum field theory this equation is more naturally obtained from the path integral formalism jensen 1981 it takes the form 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 1 2 3 2

noted in section 2 2 a as discussed there the formalism of cooper et al 2001 has the time derivative and nonlinear term on the same side of the equation unlike our eq 2 1 for our parallel development of the statistical dynamical equations for first and second order tendency equations it is however more convenient to keep the form 2 1 which changes the sign of the 3 u and 3 vertices from those of cooper et al 2001 and blagoev et al 2001 now we define the pauli matrices 10 01 0 0 01 10 321 i i a 2 and also define 01 10 01 10 1 2 2 1 i a 3 then with 2 1 s s a 4 a where the subscript is the

expressions for the off diagonal elements of the covariance and response function matrices in terms of the diagonal elements and the mean field and topography we then use these results to derive the self energy closure equations presented in section 5 as modifications to the idia closure equations of section 3 these expressions for the off diagonal elements are derived through a formal perturbation theory in this the interaction coefficients on the right hand side of equation 3 3 are supposed to be multiplied by a small parameter the off diagonal elements are calculated are formally renormalized and is restored back to unity we suppose that ak in equation 3 3 is expanded in the perturbation series k aaa 1 0 kkk b 1 where 0 tak has a multivariate gaussian distribution from
