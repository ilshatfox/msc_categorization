dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem tian ma and shouhong wang abstract the main objective of this article is to study both dynamic and structural transitions of the taylor couette flow using the dynamic transition theory and geometric theory of incompressible flows developed recently by the authors in particular we show that as the taylor number crosses the critical number the system undergoes either a continuous or a jump dynamic transition dictated by the sign of a computable nondimensional parameter r in addition we show that the new transition states have the taylor vortex type of flow structure which is structurally stable 1 introduction the study of hydrodynamic instability caused by the centrifugal forces originated from the famous experiments conducted by 13 in 1923 in which he observed and studied the stability of an incompressible viscous fluid between two rotating coaxial cylinders in his experiments taylor investigated the case where the gap between the two cylinders is small in comparison with the mean radius and the two cylinders rotate in the same direction he found that when the taylor number t is smaller than a critical value tc 0 called the critical taylor number the basic flow called the couette flow is stable and when the taylor number crosses the critical value the couette flow breaks out into a radially symmetric cellular pattern as in figure 1 1 there have been extensive studies for the taylor problem from both the mathe matical and physical point of view see among many others 16 15 1 2 over the years the taylor problem together with the rayleigh be nard convection problem has become one of the paradigms for studying nonequilibrium phase transitions and pattern formation in nonlinear sciences the main objective of this article is to address the dynamic transition of the taylor couette flow and and study the formation and stability in its structure of the taylor vortices the main technical tools are the dynamical transition theory and the geometric theory for incompressible flows both developed recently by the authors see 6 11 and the references therein the main philosophy of the dynamic transition theory is to search for the full set of transition states giving a complete characterization on stability and transition 1991 mathematics subject classification 35 q 67 key words and

2 01 0 2 ma and wang figure 1 1 couette flow and taylor vortices 1 2 the set of transition states is represented by a local attractor following this phi losophy the dynamic transition theory is developed to identify the transition states and to classify them both dynamically and physically one important ingredient of this theory is the introduction of a dynamic classification scheme of phase tran sitions with this classification scheme phase transitions are classified into three types continuous type i jump type ii and mixed type iii the dynamic transition theory is recently developed by the authors to identify the transition states and to classify them both dynamically and physically see above references for details the theory is motivated by phase transition problems in nonlinear sciences namely the mathematical theory is developed under close links to the physics and in return the theory is applied to the physical problems although more applications are yet to be explored with this theory many long standing phase transition problems are either solved or become more accessible providing new insights to both theoretical and experimental studies for the underlying physical problems for simplicity we focus in this article on the z periodic boundary condition which is an approximate description for the case where the ratio l r 2 r 1 between the height l and the gap r 2 r 1 is sufficiently large we remark that similar results hold true as well for other type of boundary conditions as well as for three dimensional perturbations in the narrow gap case we refer the interested readers to 11 for further details the main results obtained are as follows first we show that the system always undergoes a dynamic transition as the taylor number t crosses the critical taylor number tc the types of the transition can be either continuous type i or jump type ii and are dictated precisely by the sign of a nondimensional parameter r given completely by the first eigenvec tors the ratio of the angular velocity of the outer and inner cylinders and and the ratio of the radii of the inner and outer cylinders second when r 0 the transition is continuous and the critical exponent of the phase transition i e the exponent in the expression of bifurcated solutions is 1 2 moreover there is only one critical taylor number tc such that the secondary flow tends to the basic flow couette flow as t tc dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem 3 also for the narrow gap case the parameter r defined by 3 23 is negative r 0 provided the two coaxial cylinders rotating in the same direction including the case where the outer cylinder does not rotate third when r 0 the transition is a jump transition leading to more drastic changes coexistence of metastable states and potentially more chaotic turbulent behavior in particular there are two critical taylor numbers tc and t with t tc when t t tc the system has two metastable states 0 the trivial couette flow and t a local attractor away from the couette flow when t tc the solution always moves away from the basic couette flow to a more chaotic turbulent regime represented by the local attractor t fourth the theoretic analysis carried out in this article shows that a street of vortices appear in the secondary flow for the narrow gap case with 1 thus the theoretic results are in agreement with the taylor experiments the article is organized as follows the partial differential equation model and the set up are given in section 2 and the main dynamic transition theorems are given in section 3 explicit expressions of the parameter r for determining the types of transitions are further discussed in section 4 the formation and structural stability of the taylor vortices are addressed further in section 5 and the main theorems are proved in section 6 2 the taylor problem 2 1 couette flow and taylor vortices consider an incompressible viscous fluid between two coaxial cylinders let r 1 and r 2 r 2 r 1 be the radii of the two cylinders 1 and 2 the angular velocities of the inner and the outer cylinders respectively and 2 1 2 1 r 1 r 2 the nondimensional taylor number is defined by 2 2 t 4 h 4 21 2 where 0 is the kinematic viscosity and h is the vertical length scale there exists a basic steady state flow called the couette flow in the cylindrical polar coordinate r z the couette flow is defined by 2 3 ur u uz p 0 v r 0 1 r v 2 r dr v r ar b r where ur u uz is the velocity field p is the pressure and a b are constants it follows from the boundary conditions that v r 1 1 r 1 v r 2 2 r 2 and the constants a and b in 2 3 are given by a 1 2 1 2 1 2 b 1 r 21 1 1 2 where and are given by 2 1 4 ma and wang based on the rayleigh criterion when 2 the couette flow is always stable at a distribution of angular velocities r a b r 2 for r 1 r r 2 however when 2 the situation is different as in the taylor experiments consider the case where the gap r 2 r 1 is much smaller than the mean radius r 0 1 2 r 1 r 2 namely r 2 r 1 r 1 r 2 2 and the two cylinders rotate in the same direction if the taylor number t in 2 2 satisfies t tc then the couette flow 2 3 is stable and if tc t tc for some 0 a street of vortices along the z axis called the taylor vortices emerge abruptly from the basic flow as shown in figure 1 1 and the corresponding flow pattern is radically symmetric and structurally stable when the gap r 2 r 2 is not small than r 0 1 2 r 1 r 2 or when the cylin ders rotate in the opposite directions the phenomena one observes are much more complex see 1 for details hence in this section we always assume the condition 2 4 2 0 2 2 governing equations the hydrodynamic equations governing an incom pressible viscous fluid between two coaxial cylinders are the navier stokes equa tions in the cylindrical polar coordinates r z they are given by 2 5 ur t u ur u 2 r ur 2 r 2 u ur r 2 1 p r u t u u uru r u 2 r 2 ur u r 2 1 r p uz t u uz uz 1 p

the couette flow 2 3 is a steady state solution of 2 5 in order to investigate its stability and transitions we need to consider the perturbed state of 2 3 ur u v r uz p 1 r v 2 r dr dynamic

known that for each given period l there is a 0 0 l such that the eigenvalues j j 1 2 of 3 9 with 3 2 near 0 satisfy that 1 m m 1 are real and 3 11 i 0 if 0 0 if 0 for 1 i m re j 0 0 for j m 1 in

1 i m to this end we need to derive the eigenvectors of 3 9 and 3 10 at i 0 0 i 1 2 it is readily to check that the eigenvectors of 3 9 with 3 2 corresponding to i 0 0 i 1 2 are given by 1 z r sin az

3 19 dd a 2 2 h 0 dd a 2 a 2 0 1 r 2 h h dh 0 at r 1 the following lemma shows that the pes is valid for the taylor problem 3 1 3 3 with 0 lemma 3 1 if 0 then the first eigenvalues i 1 i m of 3 9 are real with multiplicity m 2 near 0 tc and the first eigenvectors at 0 are given by 3 14 and 3 15 moreover the eigenvalues j j 1 2 satisfy the conditions 5 4 and 5 5 at 0 i e the pes holds true at the critical taylor number tc proof we only need to prove 3 13 by theorem 2 1 in 9 it suffices to verify that 3 20 b 1 1 h 6 0 b 1 1 h 6 0 we infer from 3 4 3 14 3 15 3 17 and 3 18 that b 1 1 h b 1 1 h 3

see 15 3 14 3 22 h r 0 r 0 h r 0 r 0 r 1 thus 3 20 follows from 3 21 and 3 22 the proof is complete 3 3 phase transition theorems here we always assume that the first eigenvalue of 3 9 with 3 2 is real with multiplicity m 2 i e the first eigenvalue 0 of 3 16 is simple and the pes holds true by lemma 3 1 this assumption is valid for all 0 and 0 1 let 1 and 1 be given by 3 14 and 3 17 we define a number r by 3 23 r 1 1 1 h g 1 1 h g 1 1 h where h 1 is defined by 3 24 a 0 b g 1 1 here the operator a b and g are as in 3 4 the solution of 3 24 exists because g 1 is orthogonal with 1 and 1 in h 10 ma and wang the following results characterize the dynamical properties of phase transitions for the taylor problem with the z periodic boundary condition theorem 3 1 if the number r 0 in 3 23 then the taylor problem 3 1 3 3 has a tyep i continuous transition at the critical taylor number t tc or 0 and the following assertions holds true 1 when the taylor number t tc or 0 the steady state u 0 is locally asymptotically stable 2 the problem bifurcates from u 0 0 or from u t 0 tc to an attractor a homeomorphic to a circle s 1 on 0 which consists of steady states of this problem 3 any u a can be expressed as u 1 r 1 2 v o 1 1 2 v x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 1 where 1 1 are given in 3 14 and 3 17 4 there is an open set u h with 0 u such that a attracts u where is the stable manifold of u 0 with codimension two in h 5 when 1 0 is small for any u 0 u h there exists a time t 0 0 such that for any t t 0 the vector field u t u 0 uz ur is topologically equivalent to one of the patterns shown in

topologically equivalent to the structure as shown in figure 3 2 theorem 3 2 for the case where r 0 the transition of the taylor problem 3 1 3 3 at t tc is of type ii moreover the taylor problem has a singularity separation at t tc 0 more precisely we have the following assertions 1 there exists a number 0 0 such that the problem generate a circle s 1 at consisting of singular points and bifurcates from on to at least two branches of circles 1 and 2 each consisting of steady states satisfying lim 0 1 0 dist 2 0 min u 2 u h 0 at 0 see figure 3 3 2 for each 0 the space h can be decomposed into two

mean radius r 0 r 1 r 2 2 with 0 and with axisymmetric perturbations this case is the situation investigated by 13 in 1923 we take the length scale h r 2 r 1 then the narrow gap condition is given by 4 1 1 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 2 2 dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem 13 under the assumption 4 1 we can neglect the terms containing r n n 1 in 2 7 in addition by 4 1 we have t 2 1 2 1 1

given by 2 2 let 1 0 be the first eigenvalue of 4 6 with 4 4 we call 4 7 tc 2 1 the critical taylor number where is given by 4 2 14 ma and wang as 1 equations 4 6 are reduced to the following symmetric linear equa tions 4 8 uz p z 0 ur p r u u ur uz z ur r 0 let the first eigenvalue 0 0 of 4 8 with 4 4 have multiplicitym 1 the cor responding eigenfunctions be vi i 1 m and the corresponding eigenspace be e 0 span vi 1 i m we remark here that under conditions 2 4 and 4 1 the condition 1 can be equivalently replaced by 4 9 r 1 2 1 for some 0 in this case the parameter in 4 2 is 2 1 2 2 when the conditions 4 1 and 4 9 hold true 1 and r 1 in this case the equations 3 1 are replaced by 4 3 and the linearized equations of 4 3 reduces to the symmetric linear system 4 8 for the approximate problem 4 8 with 3 2 we use r 0 to denote the number r defined by 3 23 and 3 24 r 0 1 1 2 g 1 1 g 1 1 h here 1 is given by 3 14 with h satisfying d 2 a 2 2 h 0 d 2 a 2 0 h h dh 0 0 at r 1 and is defined by 4 10 a 0 b 0 g 1 1 b 0 p 0 r by 3 6 we have g 1 1 h 0 g 1 1 h g 1 1 h hence we infer from 4 10 that r 0 1 1 2 g 1 1 1 1 2 a 0 b 0 we see that a 0 b 0 is symmetric and semi positive definite and g 1 1 ker a 0 b 0 ker a 0 b 0 dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem 15 therefore it follows that r 0 1 1 2 a 0 b 0 1 2 a 0 b 0 1 2 h 0 on the other hand it is known that the number r in 3 23 is continuous on and r r 0 as 1 hence we derive the following conclusion theorem 4 1 for the taylor problem 3 1 3 3 there exist 0 1 and 0 0 1 such that for any 0 1 and 0 1 with 2 the parameter r r defined by 3 23 is negative i e r 0 0 1 0 1 consequently the conclusions in theorem 3 1 hold true 5 formation of the taylor vortices and structural stability assertions 5 and 6 in theorem 3 1 provide an asymptotic structure of the solutions in the physical space when the gap r 2 r 1 is small as observed in the experiments however for general parameters and we can not give the precisely theoretic results and only present some qualitative description here we consider two general cases as follows case 0 following 16 15 for the eigenvector h of 3 16 the function h can be taken as positive and has a unique maximum point in the interval 1 therefore for the eigenvectors defined by 3 14 and 3 15 the vector fields z r and z r are divergence free and have the topological structure as shown in figure 3 2 hence to obtain assertions 5 and 6 in theorem 3 1 for any 0 it suffices to prove that 5 1 h r 6 0 at r r 0 1 where r 0 1 is the maximum point of h we conjecture that the property 5 1 for the eigenvector h of 3 16 is valid for all 0 1 and 0 1 case 0 in this case the situation is different numerical results show that the vector field z r in 3 14 has k 2 vortices in the radial direction called the taylor vortices which has the topological structure as shown in figure 5 1 see 1 this type of structure is structurally unstable however as discussed in 4 under a perturbation either in space h or in h uz ur u h l 0 1 ruzdzdr 0 there are only finite types of stable structures in particular if the vector field z r in 3 14 is d regular i e h r satisfies 5 1 then there is only one class of stable structures regardless of the orientation for example when u 0 h h the asymptotic structure of the solution u t u 0 of 3 1 3 3 is as shown in figure 5 2 and when u 0 h the asymptotic structure of the solution u t u 0 is as shown in figure 5 3 it is clear that the class of structures illustrated by figure 5 2 is different from that illustrated by figure 5 3 the first one has a cross the channel traveling flow in the z direction and the second one does not have such a cross the channel flow 16 ma and wang figure 5 1 z r has k vortices in r direction r z figure 5 2

the following several steps step 1 we claim that the problem 3 1 3 3 bifurcates from u 0 0 to a circle s 1 which consists of stead states it is easy to see that the problem 3 1 with 3 2 is invariant for the transition in the z direction u z r t u z z 0 r t forz 0 r 1 therefore if u 0 is a steady state solution of 3 1 with 3 2 then for any z 0 r 1 the function u 0 z z 0 r is also a steady state solution we can see that the set u 0 z z 0 r z 0 r 1 is homeomorphic to a circle s 1 in h 1 for any u 0 h 1 hence the singular points of 3 1 with 3 2 appear as a circle it is known in 16 15 that there exist singular points bifurcated from u 0 0 thus this claim is proved step 2 reduction to the center manifold we shall use the construction of center manifold functions to derive the reduced equations of 3 5 given by 6 1 dx dt 1 x g u 1 h 1 1 h dy dt 1 y g u 1 h 1 1 h dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem 17 where 1 and 1 are the eigenvectors of 3 9 corresponding to 1 near 0 with 6 2 lim 0 1 1 1 as in 3 14 lim 0 1 1 1 as in 3 15 and 1 and 1 are the dual eigenvectors of 1 and 1 satisfying 6 3 lim 0 1 1 1 as in 3 17 lim 0 1 1 1 as in 3 18 let e 0 e 0 be the center manifold function of 3 5 at 0 where e 0 span 1 1 e 0 u h u 1 h 0 u 1 h 0 let u 0 x 1 y 1 e 0 then it is easy to check that g u 0 e 0 hence by the center manifold approximation formula in 12 11 we find that 6 4 x y o x 2 y 2 o 1 x 2 y 2 l g 1 1 x 2 g 1 1 y 2 g 1 1 g 1 1 xy on the center manifold u u 0 u 0 therefore from 6 1 6 4 we obtain the reduced equations of 3 5 to the center manifold as follows 6 5 dx

asymptotically stable singular point of 3 5 by the attractor bifurcation theorem theorem 6 1 in p 153 in 5 the problem 3 1 3 3 bifurcates from u 0 0 to an attractor a which attracts an open set u and assertions 1 3 and 4 hold true in addition the nonlinear terms in 6 11 satisfy the coercive condition in the s 1 attractor bifurcation theorem theorem 5 10 in 5 and the conclusion in step 1 and assertion 2 follows step 4 attraction in cr norm it is known that for any initial value u 0 h there is a time t 0 0 such that the solution u t u 0 of 3 1 3 3 is analytic for t t 0 and uniformly bounded in c r norm for any r 1 see theorem 1 in 7 hence by assertion 4 for any u 0 u we have 6 13 lim t min v 0 a u t u 0 v 0 cr 0 step 5 structure of solutions in a by assertion 3 for any steady state solution u 0 uz ur u a the vector field u uz ur of u 0 can be expressed as 6 14 uz cos a z z 0 d h r w 1 z r 1 ur a sin a z z 0 h r w 2 z r 1 for some z 0 r 1 where 1 r 1 2 wi o 1 1 2 for i 1 2 as in the proof of theorem 4 1 in 8 we deduce that the vector field 6 14 is d regular for all 0 0 for some 0 moreover the first order vector field in 6 14 6 15 vz vr cos a z z 0 d h r a sin a z z 0 h r has the topological structure as shown in figure 3 2 furthermore it is easy to check that the space h u uz ur u h m ruzdrdz 0 dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem 21 is invariant for the operator l g defined by 3 4 to see this since u is z periodic and u 0 at r 1 we have l 0 1 r u uzdrdz l 0 1 rur uz r drdz l 0 1 rur r uzdrdz l 0 1 r uz z uzdrdz 0 u h l 0 1 r uzdrdz 0 u h thus we see that h is invariant for l g therefore for the vector field 6 13 we have m ruzdrdz 0 by the connection lemma and the orbit breaking method in 6 it implies that the vector field 6 14 is topologically equivalent to its first order field 6 15 for 0 0 step 6 proof of assertions 5 and 6 for any initial value u 0 u h we have 6 16 u 0 k 1 kek w 0 where w 0 h and for any k 1 2 ek e k r 0 0 1 e k r dr 6 0 and e k r satisfies that d de k ke k e k r 1 0 0 1 2 make the decomposition h 1 e h 1 h 1 h 1 h h e h e span e 1 e 2 22 ma and wang then the equation 3 5 can be decomposed into 6 17 de dt l e e e dw dt l w g w w h 1 e 0 w 0 k kek w 0 it is obvious that l ek kek hence for the initial value 6 16 the solution u t u 0 of 6 17 can be expressed as 6 18 u t u 0 k ke ktek w t u 0 1 ek r dr 6 0 by 6 13 we have lim t w t u 0 v 0 cr 0 v 0 a which implies by step 5 that w t u 0 is topologically equivalent to 6 15 for t 0 sufficiently large i e w t u 0 has the topological structure as shown in figure 3 2 by the structural stability theorem theorem 2 2 9 and lemmas 2 3 1 and 2 3 3 connection lemmas in 6 we infer from 6 18 that the vector field in 6 18 is topologically equivalent to either the structure as shown in figure 3 1 a or the structure as shown in 3 1 b dictated by the sign of k 0 in 6 16 with k 0 min k k 6 0 thus assertion 5 is proved assertion 6 can be derived by the invariance of h under the operator l g and the structural stability theorem with perturbation in h in the same fashion as in the proof of theorem 2 2 9 in 6 by using the connection lemma the proof of theorem 3 1 is complete 6 2 proof of theorem 3 2 when r 0 by theorem a 2 in 10 we infer from the reduced equation 6 11 that the transition of 3 1 3 3 is of type ii in the following we shall use the saddle node bifurcation theorem theorem a 7 in 10 to prove this theorem let h uz ur u h uz z r uz z r h 1 h 1 h it is easy to see that the space h is invariant under the action of the operator l g defined by 3 4 6 19 l g h 1 h and the first eigenvalue 1 of l h 1 h at 0 t tc is simple with the first eigenvector 1 given by 3 14 hence the number r in 6 12 is valid for the mapping 6 18 i e g x 1 x 1 rx 3 o x 3 thus it is readily to check that all conditions in theorem a 7 in 10 are fulfilled by the operator 6 19 by step 1 in the proof of theorem 3 1 each singular point dynamic transition and pattern formation in taylor problem 23 of 6 19 generates a singularity circle for l g in h therefore theorem 3 2 follows from theorem a 7 in 10 the proof of theorem 3 2 is complete references 1 s
