integr part of and its decimal parts the closure in h of d the space of infinitely differentiable functions with support in is denoted by h 0 on any portion we introduce the space h 1 2 as follows h 1

the tangential component of u the stress vector is equal to n where is the cauchy stress tensor defined by 2 u p where p is the hydrostatic pressure is the identity tensor and is the kinematic fluid viscosity 1 introduction no slip hypothesis at fluid wall interface leads to good agreement with experimental observations for newtonian fluids which is no longer true for non newtonian fluid 1 for example in the flow of certain high molecular weight linear polymers through circular dies the exit flow rate has been found to be a discontinous function of pressure drop over a certain range of shear rates 2 3 this obervation is consistant with the hypothesis that the velocity at the wall is not zero several studies have been made and showed not only that slip takes place when a threshold is reached 4 but also it s the origin of many defects and instabilities in the polymer injection process 5 6 the first attempt to integrate this boundary condition in a numerical simulation of a flow is due to doltsini et al 7 and fortin 8 since that many papers were published simulating various flows with such boundary conditions see 9 and refrences therin recently based on the penality method error estimates for the stokes problem with tresca boundary conditions with strong regularity assumption on the velocity field are obtained 10 the aim of this work is to contribute to the numerical analysis of stokes problem with tresca boundary conditions our first purose is to carry out the convergence analysis and a priori estimates for the mixed finite element formulation of the above cited problem the second one is to derive an algorithm well adapted to this formulation and easy to implement in order to validate our theoritical estimates the paper is organized as follows first we introduice the equations modelling the stokes problem then we establish the continous mixed variational formulation is section 3 the following section is devoted to a priori error estimates we show an optimal order of h 3 4 with h 2 assupmtion regularity on the velocity in section 5 we propose an algorithm based on augmented lagrangian method to solve the 2 d problem and make some numerical tests 2 setting stokes problem with nonlinear boundary conditions we consider the following stokes problem with nonlinear boundary condition of tresca friction type div u p f in div u 0 in u 0 on 0 un 0 on t g ut 0 on t g k 0 a constant such that ut k t on 1 with rd d 2 or 3 an open set with regular boundary which is the union of two nonoverlapping portions 0 and 0 is subjected to no slip boundary condition while is where le fluid may slip we need this result to derive the variational problem proposition 2 1 12 t g ut 0 t g ut k t k is a non negative constant on t ut g ut 0 on 2 one can derive the variational formulation of 1 find u vdiv such that v vdiv a u v u j v j u l v u 3 with v v h 1 v 0 0 v n 0 vdiv v v div v 0 in a u v u v d l v f v d g a non negative function in l 2 and j v g vt d u v vdiv problem 3 is an elliptic variationnal inequality of the second kind which has a unique solution 13 moreover since the bilinear form a is symmetic 3 is equivalent to the following constrained non differentiable minimization problem 3 find u vdiv such that j u j v v vdiv 4 where j v 1 2 a v v j v l v 3 mixed formulation in order to solve 4 a lagrange multiplier q is needed to enforce the condition div u 0 in which can be identified with the pressure in the other hand fujita proved in 19 that 3 is equivalent to t h 1 2 00 such that t g on t v u t j v j u 0 v v 5 t is seen as a lagrange multiplier and can be identified with the shear stress on the minimization problem 4 is equivalent to the following saddle point formulation find u p h such that l u q l u p l v p v q h 6 l v q 1 2 a v v q div v vt l v v q h v l 20 q where q l 2 d 1 g l 2 d 1 vt g vt 0 v v according to 20 problem 6 has a uniqe solution charcterized by find u p v such that a u v b p v l v v v b q p u 0 q 7 where b p v p divv vt 8 and l 20 q is a closed convex of m l 20 l 2 d 1 lemma 3 1 there exists a constant 0 such that q m sup v v b q v v 1 q 1 2 9 proof to prove this result we are inspired by 20 we have to prove that for all q m there exists u v such that div u q in u 0 on 0 un 0 on ut h 1 on 10 wich satisfies u 1 c q 0 1 2 11 where h 1 is the inverse riesz operator h 1 2 00 h 1 2 00 the proof is diveded into five steps step 1 4 we suppose that is a convex with a regular boudary let q l 20 and 1 be the solution of 1 q on 1 0 in 12 according to 21 problem 12 admits a unique solution 1 verifing 1 h 2 and 1 2 c q 0 13 where c is a constant independent of and q step 2 since 1 h 2 1 n h 1 2 we now consider the following neumann problem 2 0 on 2 n 1 n in 14 according to 21 this problem admits a regular solution 2 h 2 verifing 2 2 c 1 n 1 2 15 step 3 let be the unique solution to the following bilaplacian problem 2 0 in 0 in n in 16 where 1 2 on 0 1 2 h 1 on we can easily show that h 1 2 from 22 it holds h 2 2 c 1 2 17 step 4 setting u 1 2 curl with curl x 2 x 1 18 so that ut h 1 on furthermore we obtain u 1 1 1 2 1 curl 1 1 2 2 2 2 c q 0 1 n 1 2 1 2 19 where c 0 is a generic constant using inequalities 13 15 17 the continuity of normal trace application from h 1 onto h 1 2 and the continuity of h 1 19 becomes u 1 c q 0 1 2 step 5 5 sup v v b q v v 1 b q u u 1 q 2 2 1 2 u 1 1 c q 2 2 1 2 q 1 2 1 2 c q 1 2 20 then take 1 2 c to finish the proof theorem 3 2 20 suppose that a is continuous v elliptic bilinear form on v and 9 holds then there exists a unique u p solution of mixed problem 7 moreover u p is also the unique solution of the saddle point problem 6 4 error estimates the present section is devoted to finite element approximation of the saddle point problem 6 the key point lies in finite element discretization of the closed convex q of the lagrange multipliers which leads to a well posed discrete problem and gives a good convergence rate for the approximate solution we use classical p 1 bubble p 1 finite element to disretize u p and p 1 finite element on for the lagrange multiplier this choice is motivated by brezzi s and sassi s results see 29 30 is supposed to be polygonal let th be a regular partition of with triangles in the sense of 24 we denote by pn the space of polynomials of degree less and equal to n n defined on th we denote by b the space of bubble functions defined on which is a sub space of h 10 then we can define the following discrete spaces b th b vh vh c 0 vh p 1 th vh 0 0 and vh n 0 vh vh b 2 wh vh vh vh lh qh c 0 qh p 1 th qh 0 qh h wh h h g h 0 h wh mh lh wh h lh qh remark qh is an external approximation of q so the discretization is non conforming and would weaken its convergence order disicretizing 7 we obtain find uh ph h vh hsuch that a uh vh b ph h vh l vh vh vh b qh ph h h uh 0 qh h h 21 where h is a closed convex of mh a sufficient condition for the existence and uniqness of the solution to problem 21 is the inf sup condition 29 lemma 4 1 these two propositions are equivalent there exists a constant 0 independent of h such that sup vh vh b qh h vh vh 1 qh 0 h 1 2 qh h mh 22 6 there exists two constants 1 0 and 2 0 independent of h such that sup vh vh qh divvh vh 1 1 qh 0 qh lh and sup vh vh h vth vh 1 2 h 1 2 h wh 23 proof to prove this result it suffices to show that sup vh vh h vth qh div vh sup vh vh h vth sup vh vh qh div vh 24 let us prove the non trivial direction sup vh vh h vth sup vh vh qh div vh sup vh vh h vth qh div vh 25 which is equivalent to h uth qh div wh sup vh vh h vth qh div vh uh wh v 2 h we suppose that 25 is not valid ie h h v 2 h such that sup vh vh h vth qh div vh h h qh div h 26 26 h vth qh div vth h h qh div h vh vh h vth h qh div vh h 0 since we know that h l 2 h d 1 h sup vh vh h vth vh h l 2 h d 1 h vh such that h h h h 0 27 and suppose that h vth h 0 vh vh wich remains valid for vh h h so that h h 0 which contradicts 27 the same reasoning can be applied to qh div vh h 0 since div verifies similar inf sup condition this ends the proof proposition 4 2 there exists a constant 0 independent of h such that sup vh vh b qh h vh vh 1 qh 0 h 1 2 qh h mh 28 proof recall that qh h vh mh vh b qh h vh qh div vh h vth according to lemma 4 1 it suffices to show that 1 0 tel que qh lh sup vh vh qh divvh vh 1 1 qh 0 29 and 2 0 tel que h wh sup vh vh h vth vh 1 2 h 1 2 30 which are both 29 and 30 established in 28 and 35 respctively now we will derive error estimates for primal variable being inspired by 27 7 lemma 4 3 26 let u p and uh ph h be solutions to 7 21 respectively then for any vh qh h vh h it holds a u uh u uh a u uh u vh b p qh h uh u b p ph h u vh b p qh h u b ph h p u 31 proof let vh be an element of vh it follows that a u uh u uh a u uh u vh a u uh vh uh using the first equations of 7 and of 21 this gives a u uh vh uh a u vh uh a uh vh uh l vh uh b p vh uh l vh uh b ph h vh uh b p uh vh b ph h vh uh then we deduce a u uh u uh a u uh u vh b p uh vh b ph h vh uh finally we have a u uh u uh a u uh u vh b p qh h uh u b p ph h u vh b p qh h u b ph h p u b qh h ph h uh but according to 21 b qh h ph h uh 0 for all qh h h this ends the proof of the lemma we now derive an upper bound of the terms involved in 31 lemma 4 4 let u p and uh ph h be solutions to 7 21 respectively suppose that u h 2 and p h 1 then u uh 21 c u p g h h 1 2 h 3 2 32 where c u p g is a positive constant depending only on u 2 p 1 and g l 2 proof using lemma 4 3 we will show that there exists vh qh h vh h satisfying a u uh u vh c u h u uh 1 b p qh h uh u c u p h u uh 1 b ph h p u vh ch u uh 1 c p h c u h b p qh h u c u 2 h 2 b ph h p u c u h h 1 2 c u h 3 2 c g h 3 2 33 before proving these estimates we first have to recall some useful results let ih jh and ih be the lagrange interpolation operators on vh lh and wh respectively from 24 there exists a positive constant c such that v h 2 p lh and h 3 2 v ihv 1 ch v 2 p jhp 0 ch p 1 ih 0 ch 3 2 3 2 34 let h be the projection operator from l 2 d 1 on wh defined by h wh h h 0 h wh 35 it holds 0 1 and 0 1 2 one has h 1 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 h h ch 1 2 36 8 let h be the projection operator from l 2 on lh defined by hq lh hq q sh 0 sh lh 37 finally let us note the trace theorem implies that 1 2 c u 2 38 i the first term is evaluted by using the continuity of a and the property 34 a u uh u vh c u uh 1 u vh 1 vh vh c inf vh vh u vh 1 u uh 1 c u ihu 1 u uh 1 c u h u uh 1 ii using 34 and 38 we have b p qh h uh u p qh div uh u h uht ut c p qh 0 h 1 2 u uh 1 qh h h c inf qh lh p qh 0 inf h qh h 1 2 u uh 1 c u p h u uh 1 39 iii further b p ph h u vh p ph div u vh h ut vht c p ph 0 h 1 2 u vh 1 vh vh c p qh 0 h 1 2 qh ph 0 h h 1 2 u vh 1 40 since ph qh h h mh then it follows from the discrete inf sup condition 28 ph qh 0 h h 1 2 sup vh vh b ph qh h h vh vh 1 sup vh vh b ph p h vh vh 1 b p qh h vh vh 1 sup vh vh a u uh vh vh 1 p qh 0 c h 1 2 hence qh h mh ph qh 0 h h 1 2 c u uh 1 p qh 0 h 1 2 41 then combining the last inequality of 39 and 41 and using property 34 we obtain b p ph h u vh c u uh 1 inf qh lh p qh 0 inf h qh h 1 2 inf vh vh u vh 1 ch u uh 1 c p h c u h 9 iv to estimate this term we invoke the definition of the l 2 projection operator b p qh h u p qh divu h utd h qh h utd for h h h utd h hutd h ut hut d h l 2 ut hut l 2 c u 2 h 2 42 v now we shall estimate the fifth term of 33 using 2 and the definition of qh b ph h p u ph p divu h utd h utd h ut ih ut h ih ut ut g ut h ut ih ut g ih ut ut ut ih ut h ut ih ut g ih ut ut ut ih ut h 1 2 ut ih ut 1 2 g 0 ut ih ut 0 0 ut

estimate u uh 21 c u p h h 1 2 h u uh c u g h 3 2 then using the young inequality we can write for every constant 0 c u p h u uh 1 c u p h 2 1 u uh 21 taking such that c u p 1 then leads to the desired result lemma 4 5 let u p and uh ph h be solutions to 7 21 respectively suppose that u h 2 and p h 1 then p ph 0 h 1 2 c u p h u uh 1 43 where c u p is a positive constant depending only on u 2 and p 1 proof using 40 and 41 we get the disired result theorem 4 6 let u p and uh ph h be solutions to 7 21 respectively suppose that u h 2 and p h 1 then u uh 1 p ph 0 h 1 2 c u p g h 3 4 where c u g is a where c u p g is a positive constant depending only on u 2 p 1 and g l 2 10 proof by assembling 32 and 43 we can write u uh 21 c u p g h h 1 2 h 3 2 c u p g h h u uh 1 c u p g h 3 2 c u p g h 2 c u p g h u uh 1 c u p g h 3 2 then using young s inequality we can easily write u uh 1 c u p g h 3 4 so that 43 becomes p ph 0 h 1 2 c u p g h 3 4 wich leads to the desired result 5 numerical simulations we briefly describe the numerical resolution of the 2 d stokes problem with boundary conditions of tresca friction type for this aim the augmented lagrangian method 31 will be used the minimization problem 4 is replaced by find u such that u v v 44 where v vdiv l 2 such that vt and the lagrangian is defined on by v v 1 2 a v v l v j then the following saddle point problem is derived find u l 2 such that lr u lr u lr v v vdiv l 2 2 45 where lr v v vt r 2 vt 20 46 and we use bloc relaxation uzawa algorithm or alg 2 as mentionned in 31 to solve 45 this leads to the following algorithm 11 1 initialisation 1 0 et r 0 fixed 2 repeat until convergence find uk v such v v a u k v r u k t vt l v r k 1 k vt div uk 0 47 k k rukt g r k rukt k ru k t if k rukt g 0 unless 48 k 1 k k u k t k 49 3 uk k uk 1 k 1 uk k end remarks it s recommanded in 31 32 to choose k r to ensure the convergnece of the above algorithm a second issue is how to choose r numerical tests show that there is an optimal value ropt for which convergence is the fastest unfortunately this result still unprooved 5 1 numerical tests a no slip 2 d stokes solver 33 is used and tresca friction boundary

the threshold is never beeing reached then there is no slip on all parts of the boundary wich is the case if the solution u p is that of the stokes problem with homogeneous dirichlet boundary

size respectively the first remark one can make is the rate convergence of h 1 norm of error on u is equal to 3 4 which is in agreement with 14 theoretical result the second one is that in spite of concidering very small mesh size h 1 1800 we cannot conclude about rate convergence of u and p error l 2 norms 6 conclusion a three field mixed formulation of the stokes problem with tresca boundary
