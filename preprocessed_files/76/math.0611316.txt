is part of a research pro gram to link the dynamics of fluid flows with the structure and its tran sitions in the physical spaces as a prototype of problem and to demon strate the main ideas we study the two dimensional rayleigh be nard convection the analysis is based on two recently developed nonlinear theories geometric theory for incompressible flows 10 and the bifur cation and stability theory for nonlinear dynamical systems both finite and infinite dimensional 9 we have shown in 8 that the rayleigh be nard problem bifurcates from the basic state to an attractor ar when the rayleigh number r crosses the first critical rayleigh number rc for all physically sound boundary conditions regardless of the multiplicity of the eigenvalue rc for the linear problem in this article in addition to a classification of the bifurcated attractor ar the structure and its transitions of the solutions in the physical space is classified leading to the existence and stability of two different flows structures pure rolls and rolls separated by a cross the channel flow it appears that the struc ture with rolls separated by a cross channel flow has not been carefully examined although it has been observed in other physical contexts such as the branstator kushnir waves in the atmospheric dynamics 1 7 1 introduction the rayleigh be nard convection problem was originated in the famous experiments conducted by h be nard in 1900 be nard investigated a fluid with a free surface heated from below in a dish and noticed a rather regu lar cellular pattern of hexagonal convection cells based on the pioneering studies by lord rayleigh 13 the convection would occur only when the non dimensional parameter called the rayleigh number 1 1 r g h 4 exceeds a certain critical value where g is the acceleration due to gravity the coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid dt dz t 0 t 1 h the vertical temperature gradient with t 0 the temperature on the lower 1991

upper surface h the depth of the layer of the fluid the thermal diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity there have been intensive studies for this problem see among others chandrasekhar 2 and drazin and reid 3 for linear theories and kirchga ssner 6 rabinowitz 12 and yudovich 16 17 and the references therein for nonlinear theories recently the authors have developed a bifurcation theory 9 for nonlinear partial differential equations which has been used to develop a nonlinear analysis for the rayleigh be nard convections 8 this bifurcation theory is centered at a new notion of bifurcation called attractor bifurcation for nonlinear evolution equations the main ingredients of the theory include a the attractor bifurcation theory b steady state bifurcation for a class of nonlinear problems with even order non degenerate nonlinearities regardless of the multiplicity of the eigenvalues and c new strategies for the lyapunov schmidt reduction and the center manifold reduction procedures in particular based on this bifurcation theory for the rayleigh be nard convection problem we have shown 8 9 that the problem bifurcates from the trivial solution to an attractor ar when the rayleigh number r crosses the first critical rayleigh number rc for all physically sound boundary con ditions regardless of the multiplicity of the eigenvalue rc for the linear problem the main objectives of this article are 1 to classify the solutions in the bifurcated attractor ar and 2 to study the structure and its transition of the solutions of the be nard problem in the physical space the first ob jective is an important part of the above mentioned new bifurcation and stability theory the second objective is part of a program recently initi ated by the authors to develop a geometric theory of two dimensional in compressible fluid flows in the physical spaces see 10 this program of study consists of research in two directions 1 the study of the structure and its transitions evolutions of divergence free vector fields kinematics and 2 the study of the structure and its transitions of velocity fields for 2 d incompressible fluid flows governed by the navier stokes equations or the euler equations the study in this article is in the second direction linking kinematics to dynamics to demonstrate ideas in this article we only consider the two dimensional be nard convection problem the three dimensional case is technically more involved and shall be reported elsewhere from the physical point of view two dimensional boussinesq equations can be considered as idealized models for many physical phenomena including 1 the walker circulation over the tropics 14 which has the same topological structure as the cells given in figure 4 3 in theorem 4 2 and 2 the branstator kushnir waves in the atmospheric dynamics 1 7 which have similar topological structure as given in figure 4 2 in theorem 4 1 we end this introduction with a few remarks first the main idea of the study is to explicitly reduce the bifurcation problem to the center manifold together with an s 1 attractor bifurcation theorem and structural stability rayleigh be nard convection 3 theorems for 2 d incompressible flows the types of solutions in this s 1 attractor depend on the boundary conditions with the periodic boundary condition 2 7 in the x 1 direction in this article the bifurcated attractor consists of only steady states when the boundary conditions for the velocity field are free slip boundary conditions and 0 l 2 0 1 with 0 l 2 2 3 2 3 2 1 using the same method proved in this article we can prove that the bifurcated attractor is still an s 1 consisting of exactly eight singular steady states with four saddles and four minimal attractors and eight heteroclinic orbits connecting these steady states the bifurcated attractor and its detailed classification provide a global dynamic transitions in both the physical and phase spaces second the method and ideas presented in this article are crucial to obtain these results which can not be obtained using only the classical bifurcation theories for the case studied in this article the classical bifurcation theory with symmetry arguments implies that the bifurcation attractor in the main theorems theorems 4 1 and 4 2 contain a circle of steady states we need however the new bifurcated theory to prove in particular that the bifurcated attractors are exactly an s 1 furthermore for general boundary conditions such as the free slip boundary conditions mentioned above no symmetry can be used and the classical amplitude equation methods fails to derive the dynamics third the newly developed geometric theory for incompressible flows is crucial for the structure and its stability of the solutions in the physical spaces obtained in the main theorems fourth it appears that the structure with rolls separated by a cross chan nel flow has not been carefully examined although it has been observed in other physical contexts such as the branstator kushnir waves in the atmo spheric dynamics 1 7 finally as mentioned before this article is part of a research program initiated in the mid 90 s to make connections between the dynamics and the structure in the physical spaces this article is organized as follows first the functional setting and the attractor bifurcation theorem for the be nard convection problem obtained in 8 are introduced in section 2 section 3 recapitulates 1 the approximation of the center manifold function 2 s 1 attractor bifurcation theorem and 3 structural stability theorems for incompressible flows the main theorems of this article are stated in section 4 and proved in section 5 2 be nard problem 2 1 boussinesq equations the be nard problem can be modeled by the boussinesq equations in this paper we consider the be nard problem in a two dimensional 2 d domain r 1 0 h r 2 h 0 the boussi nesq equations which govern the motion and states of the fluid flow are 4 t ma and s wang as follows see among others rayleigh 13 drazin and reid 3 and chan drasekhar 2 u t u u u 10 p gk 1 t t 0 2 1 t t u t t 0 2 2 div u 0 2 3 where g are constants defined

periodic boundary condition in the x 1 direction 2 7 u t x 1 x 2 t u t x 1 kl x 2 t k z at the top and bottom boundary x 2 0 1 different combinations of top and bottom boundary conditions are normally used in different physical setting such as rigid rigid rigid free free rigid and free free for instance we have dirichlet boundary condition rigid rigid 2 8 t 0 u 0 at x 2 0 1 free free boundary

11 u t u 0 t 0 at t 0 2 2 functional setting for simplicity we proceed in this article with the set of boundary conditions given by 2 7 and 2 8 and similar results hold true as well for other combinations of boundary conditions let h u t l 2 3 divu 0 u 2 x 2 0 1 0 u 1 is periodic in x 1 direction v u t h 10 3 divu 0 u t is periodic in x 1 direction h 1 v h 2 3 let g h 1 h and l a b h 1 h be defined by g p u u u t a p u t b p tk u 2 for any u t h 1 here r and p the leray projection to l 2 fields then the boussinesq equations 2 4 2 8 can be rewritten in the follow ing operator form 2 12 d dt l g u t 2 3 attractor bifurcation of the be nard problem let s t t 0 be an operator semi group generated by the equation 2 12 then the solution of 2 12 can be expressed as t 0 s t 0 t 0 definition 2 1 a set h is called an invariant set of 2 12 if s t for any t 0 an invariant set h of 2 12 is called an attractor if is compact and there exists a neighborhood u h of such that for any 0 u we have lim t disth t 0 0 definition 2 2 1 we say that the equation 2 12 bifurcates from 0 0 to invariant sets if there exists a sequence of 6 t ma and s wang invariant sets n of 2 12 such that 0 n and lim n n 0 lim n max x n x 0 2 if the invariant sets are attractors of 2 12 then the bifurcation is called attractor bifurcation we are now in position to state the attractor bifurcation theorem for the be nard problem 2 4 2 8 the linearized equations of 2 4 2 6 are given by 2 13 u p rtk 0 t ru 2 0 divu 0 where r is the rayleigh number these equations are supplemented with the same boundary conditions 2 7 and 2 8 as the nonlinear boussinesq system this eigenvalue problem for the rayleigh number r is symmetric hence we know that all eigenvalues rk with multiplicities mk of 2 13 with 2 7 and 2 8 are real numbers and 0 r 1 rk rk 1 the first eigenvalue r 1 is a function of the period l the critical rayleigh number rc is given by 2 14 rc min l 0 r 1 l let the multiplicity of rc bem 1 m m even and the first eigenspace be denoted by e 0 then we have the following attractor bifurcation theorem theorem 2 3 8 9 for the be nard problem 2 4 2 8 the following asser tions hold true 1 when r rc the steady state u t 0 is a globally asymptotically stable in h 2 the equations bifurcate from u t r 0 rc to attractors r for r rc with m 1 dim r m and r is an m 1 dimensional homological sphere i e r has the same homology as sm 1 3 for any u t r the velocity field u can be expressed as u m k 1 kek o m k 1 kek where ek are the velocity fields of the first eigenvectors in e 0 4 for any open bounded neighborhood u h of u t 0 the at tractor r attracts u in h where is the stable manifold of u t 0 with co dimension m in h rayleigh be nard convection 7 remark 2 4 results similar to this attractor bifurcation theorem hold true as well for the 3 d be nard problems see 8 9 3 preliminaries 3 1 center manifold functions to study the structure of the bifurcated attractors of 2 4 2 8 it is necessary to consider the reduction of nonlinear evolution equations to center manifolds to this end we introduce in this section a method to derive a first order approximation of the central manifold functions which was introduced and used in 9 let h and h 1 be two hilbert spaces and let h 1 h be a dense and compact inclusion we consider the following nonlinear evolution equation 3 1 du dt l u g u u 0 u 0 where u 0 h is the unknown function r is the system parame ter and l h 1 h are parameterized linear completely continuous fields depending continuously on r 1 which satisfy 3 2 l a b is a sectorial operator a h 1 h a linear homeomorphism b h 1 h parameterized linear compact operators it is easy to see 5 11 that l generates an analytic semi group e tl t 0 then we can define fractional power operators l for any 0 1 with domain h d l such that h 1 h 2 if 1 2 and h 0 h furthermore we assume that the nonlinear term g h h for some 0 1 is a family of parameterized cr bounded operators r 1 continuously depending on the parameter r 1 such that 3 3 g u o u h r 1 in this paper we are interested in the case where l a b are sectorial operators such that there exist an eigenvalue sequence k c 1 and an eigenvector sequence ek hk h 1 of a 3 4 azk kzk zk ek ihk re k k im k are k c for some a c 0 such that ek hk is a basis of h condition 3 4 implies that a is a sectorial operator for the operator b h 1 h we also assume that there is a constant 0 1 such that 3 5 b h h bounded r 1 under conditions 3 4 and 3 5 the operator l a b is a sectorial operator 8 t ma and s wang let h 1 and h be decomposed into 3 6 h 1 e 1 e 2 h e 1 e 2 for near 0 r 1 where e 1 e 2 are invariant subspaces of l such that dime 1 e 1 e 1 e 2 closure of e 2 in h in addition l can be decomposed into l l 1 l 2 such that for any near 0 3 7 l 1 l e 1 e 1 e 1 l 2 l e 2 e 2 e 2 where all eigenvalues of l 2 possess negative real parts and the eigenvalues of l 1 possess nonnegative real parts at 0 thus for near 0 equation 3 1 can be written as 3 8 dx dt l 1 x g 1 x y dy dt l 2 y g 2 x y where u x y h 1 x e 1 y e 2 gi x y pig u and pi h e i are canonical projections furthermore let e 2 closure of e 2 in h with 1 given by 3 3 the following center manifold theorem is classical see 5 15 theorem 3 1 assume 3 3 3 7 hold true then there exists a neigh borhood of 0 given by 0 for some 0 a neighborhood b e 1 of x 0 and a c 1 function b e 2 depending continuously on such that 1 0 0 x 0 0 2 the set m x y h x b y x e 2 called the center manifolds are locally invariant for 3 1 i e for each u 0 m u t u 0 m 0 t t u 0 for some t u 0 0 where u t u 0 is the solution of 3 1 rayleigh be nard convection 9 3 if x t y t is a solution of 3 8 then there is a 0 and k 0 with k depending on x 0 y 0 such that y t x t h k e t also it is classical that to bifurcation problem of 3 1 is reduced to that for the following finite dimensional system 3 9 dx dt l 1 x g 1 x x for x b e 1 now we give a formula to calculate the center manifold functions let the nonlinear operator g be given by 3 10 g u gk u o u k for k 2 where gk u is a k multilinear operator gk h 1 h 1 h gk u gk u u the following theorem was proved in 9 theorem 3 2 under the conditions 3 3 3 7 and 3 10 the center man ifold function x can be expressed as 3 11 x l 2 1 p 2 gk x o re x k o x k where l 2 is given by 3 7 p 2 h e 2 the canonical projection x e 1 and 1 m the eigenvalues of l 1 remark 3 3 consider the case where l h 1 h is symmetric then the eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis of h therefore we have u x y e 1 e 2 x m i 1 xiei e 1 y i m 1 xiei e 2 then near 0 the formula 3 11 can be expressed as follows 3 12 x j m 1 j x ej o re x k o x k where j x 1 j 1 j 1 jk m a j j 1 jk xj 1 xjk a j j 1 jk gk ej 1 ejk ej h 10 t ma and s wang in many applications the coefficients a j j 1 jk can be computed and the first m eigenvalues 1 m satisfy re 0 m j 1 re j 0 2 0 hence 3 12 gives an explicit formula for the first approximation of the center manifold functions 3 2 s 1 attractor bifurcation in this section we study the structure of the bifurcated attractor of 3 9 when m 2 namely we consider a two dimensional system as follows 3 13 dx dt x g x x r 2 here is a continuous function of satisfying 3 14 0 if 0 0 if 0 0 if 0 and 3 15 g x gk x o x k gk is a k multilinear field c 1 x k 1 gk x x for some integer k 2 m 1 3 and some constants 0 c 1 the following theorem was proved in 9 which shows that under condi tions 3 14 and 3 15 the system 3 13 bifurcates to an s 1 attractor rayleigh be nard convection 11 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 p 6 figure 3 1 has 4 n n n 1 and n 2 shown here singular points where p 1 and p 4 are saddles p 3 and p 6 are nodes and p 2 and p 5 are singular points with index zero theorem 3 4 let the condition 3 14 and 3 15 hold true then the system 3 13 bifurcates from x 0 0 to an attractor which is homeomorphic to s 1 for 0 0 for some 0 moreover one and only one of the following is true 1 is a periodic orbit 2 consists of infinite number of singular points or 3 contains at most 2 k 1 4 m 1 singular points consisting of 2 n saddles points 2 n stable node points and n 4 m 1 4 n singular points with index zero as shown in figure 3 1 3 3 structural stability theorems in this subsection we recall some results on structural stability for 2 d divergence free vector fields developed in 10 which are crucial to study the asymptotic structure in the physical space of the bifurcated solutions of the be nard problem let cr r 2 be the space of all cr r 1 vector fields on r 1 0 1 which are periodic in x 1 direction with period l let d r r 2 be the space of all cr divergence free vector fields on r 1 0 1 which are periodic in x 1 direction with period l and with no normal flow condition in x 2 direction dr r 2 v cr r 2 v 2 0 at x 2 0 1 furthermore we let br 0 r 2 v dr r 2 v 0 at x 2 0 1 br 1 r 2 v d r r 2 v 0 at x 2 0 v 2 v 1 x 2 0 at x 2 1 12 t ma and s wang definition 3 5 two vector fields u v cr r 2 are called topologically equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism of which takes the orbits of u to orbits of v and preserves their orientation definition 3 6 let x dr r 2 or x br 0 r 2 a vector field v x is called structurally stable in x if there exists a neighborhood u x of v such that for any u u u and v are topologically equivalent let v dr r 2 we recall next some basic facts and definitions on divergence free vector fields 1 a point p is called a singular point of v if v p 0 a singular point p of v is called non degenerate if the jacobian matrix dv p is invertible v is called regular if all singular points of v are non degenerate 2 an interior non degenerate singular point of v can be either a center or a saddle and a non degenerate boundary singularity must be a saddle 3 saddles of v must be connected to saddles an interior saddle p is called self connected if p is connected only to itself i e p occurs in a graph whose topological form is that of the number 8 let v br 0 r 2 then we know that each point on x 2 0 1 is a singular point of v in the usual sense to study the structure of v we need to classify the boundary points as follows definition 3 7 let u br 0 tm r 2 1 a point p m is called a regular point of u if u p n 6 0 other wise p m is called a singular point of u 2 a singular point p m of u is called non degenerate if 3 16 det 2 u p n 2 u p n 2 2 un p n 2 un p n 2 6 0 a non degenerate singular point of u is also called a saddle point of u 3 u br 0 tm r 2 is called d regular if a u is regular in m and b all singular points of u on m are non degenerate the following theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for structural stability of a divergence free vector field theorem 3 8 10 let u br 0 tm r 2 then u is structurally stable in br 0 tm if and only if 1 u is d regular 2 all interior saddle points of u are self connection and rayleigh be nard convection 13 3 each saddle point of u on m is connected to a saddle point on the same connected component of m moreover the set of all structurally stable vector fields is open and dense in br 0 tm remark 3 9 for vector fields with free rigid boundary conditions the con ditions for structural stability differs slightly more precisely u br 1 tm r 2 is structurally stable in br 1 tm if and only if 1 all singular of u in and on x 2 1 are regular and all singular points on x 2 0 are regular 2 all interior saddle points of u are self connected and 3 each saddle of u on x 2 1 is connected to saddles on x 2 1 and each saddle point of u on x 2 0 is connected to a saddle point on x 2 0 remark 3 10 for vector fields satisfying free free boundary conditions we set br 2 r 2 v dr r 2 v 2 v 1 x 2 0 at x 2 0 1 br 3 r 2 v dr 2 r 2 udx 0 then u br 2 r 2 resp u br 3 r 2 is structurally stable in br 2 r 2 resp in br 2 r 2 if and only if 1 u is regular 2 all interior saddle points of u are self connected and 3 each boundary saddle of u is connected to boundary saddles on the same connected component of resp each boundary saddle of u is connected to boundary saddles not necessarily on the same con nected component the difference between these two cases is due to the zero average condition in the definition in br 3 r 2 which implies that br 3 r 2 does not contain the harmonic field v 0 0 for any constant 6 0 hence an orbit connecting two saddles on different components of the boundary can not be broken with a perturbation in br 3 r 2 into orbits connecting only saddles on the same connected component of the boundary 4 structure of bifurcated solutions for the be nard problem in this section we study the topological structure of the bifurcated at tractor and the asymptotic structure of solutions for the be nard problem it is known that for each type of boundary conditions there is a minimal period lc satisfying 2 14 hereafter we always take lc to be the period of 2 7 the main theorem in this article is as follows 14 t ma and s wang r figure 4 1 all points on the bifurcated attractor r s 1 are steady state solutions theorem 4 1 for the be nard problem 2 4 2 8 the following assertions hold true 1 for r rc the equations bifurcate from the trivial solution u t r 0 rc to an attractor r homeomorphic to s 1 which consists of steady state solutions as shown in figure 4 1 where rc is the critical rayleigh number 2 for any 0 u 0 t 0 h e there exists a time t 0 0 such that for any t t 0 the vector field u t 0 is topologically equivalent to the structure as shown in either figure 4 2 a or figure 4 2 b where u t 0 t t 0 is the solution u t 0 t t 0 of 2 4 2 8 with initial data 0 is the stable manifold of the trivial solution u t 0 with co dimension 2 and e u t h 1 0 u 1 dx 2 0 rayleigh be nard convection 15 b a figure 4 2 here the horizontal axis is the x 1 axis and the vertical axis is the x 2 axis with the dirichlet boundary conditions on x 2 0 1 the flow is not moving on both the top x 2 1 and the bottom x 2 0 boundaries the zonally moving meandering flow shown in figure 4 2 appears often in many physical problems such as the bransdator kushnir waves in atmo spheric circulation 1 7 theorem 4 1 is also valid for the be nard problem 2 4 2 7 with 2 10 however the case with the free free boundary condition is different more precisely for the free free boundary condition it is easy to see that for any constant the harmonic field 0 0 0 is a solution of 2 4 2 6 therefore we have to consider the problem 2 4 2 7 with 2 9 in the following function spaces h u t l 2 3 divu 0 udx 0 h 1 u t h h 2 3 satisfies 2 7 and 2 9 then we have the following theorem theorem 4 2 for the be nard problem 2 4 2 7 with boundary condition 2 9 the following assertions hold true 1 for r rc the equations bifurcate from the trivial solution u t r 0 rc to an attractor r homeomorphic to s 1 which consists of 16 t ma and s wang steady state solutions where rc 27 4 4 is the critical rayleigh number 2 for any 0 u 0 t 0 h there exists a time t 0 0 such that for any t t 0 the vector field u t 0 is topologically equivalent to the structure as shown in figure 4 3 where u t 0 t t 0 is the solution u t 0 t t 0 of 2 4 2 7 with 2 9 is the stable manifold of the trivial solution u t 0 with co dimension 2 in h figure 4 3 here the horizontal axis is the x 1 axis and the vertical axis is the x 2 axis with the free slip boundary con ditions on x 2 0 1 the flow does move on both the top x 2 1 and the bottom x 2 0 boundaries 5 proof of main theorems 5 1 eigenvectors of the linear boussinesq equations we shall only prove theorem 4 1 the proof of theorem 4 2 is essentially the same and we omit the details we proceed by first considering the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linearized equations of 2 4 2 6 5 1 u p rtk r u t ru 2 r t divu 0 supplemented with the boundary conditions 2 7 and 2 8 for u 1 u 2 t h 1 we take the separation of variables as follows sin 2 k x 1 l h x 2 2 k l cos 2 k x 1 l h x 2 cos 2 k x 1 l x 2 cos 2 k x 1 l h x 2 2 k l sin 2 k x 1 l h x 2 sin 2 k x 1 l x 2 then it follows from 5 1 that h satisfies the following differential equa tions 5 2 d 2 dx 22 a 2 k 2 h rak r d 2 dx 22 a 2 k h d 2 dx 22 a 2 k rakh r rayleigh be nard convection 17 supplemented with the following boundary conditions 5 3 0 h h 0 at x 2 0 1 where ak 2 k l and l lc satisfies 2 14 the eigenvalue problem 5 2 with 5 3 is symmetric and has a complete eigenvalue and eigenvector sequences for given k and r 5 4 k 1 r k 2 r lim j kj r hkj h 4 0 1 h 20 0 1 j 1 2 kj h 2 0 1 h 10 0 1 j 1 2 moreover hkj kj j 1 2 constitutes an orthogonal basis of l 2 0 1 l 2 0 1 thus we obtain the following complete set of eigenvectors for 5 1 with boundary conditions 2 7 and 2 8 kj sin 2 k x 1 l h kj x 2 2 k l cos 2 k x 1 l hkj x 2 cos 2 k x 1 l kj x 2 5 5 kj cos 2 k x 1 l h kj x 2 2 k l sin 2 k x 1 l hkj x 2 sin 2 k x 1 l kj x 2 5 6 where 0 k 1 j when k 0 we derive from 5 1 5 5 and 5 6 that 5 7 0 j 0 0 sin j x 2 0 j h 0 j x 2 0 0 5 2 singularity cycle we shall show that the bifurcated attractor r of 2 4 2 8 given in theorem 2 3 contains a cycle of steady state solutions first we note that the equations 2 4 2 8 are invariant under the fol lowing translation x 1 x 2 t x 1 x 2 t r hence if 0 x is a steady state solution then 0 x 1 x 2 are steady state solutions as well it is easy to see that the set s 0 x 1 x 2 r is a cycle s 1 in h 1 therefore each steady state of 2 4 2 8 generates a cycle of steady state solutions let h u t h u 1 x 1 x 2 u 1 x 1 x 2 h 1 h 1 h 18 t ma and s wang it is easy to check that h and h 1 are invariant spaces for the operator l g given by 2 12 in the sense that l g h 1 h where r on the other hand it is clear that the sequence kj k 0 1 j 1 2 defined by 5 5 is a basis of h since the first eigenvalue rc of 2 13 is simple the first eigenvalue 1 rc of l in h 1 is also simple where 1 rc 11 rc 0 and 11 rc is defined by 5 4 hence by the classical krasnoselskii bifur cation theorem we know that the operator l g bifurcates from 0 rc to a singular point in h 1 namely the be nard problem 2 4 2 8 bifurcates from r 0 rc a steady state solution therefore the bifurcated attractor r contains at least a cycle of steady state solutions 5 3 s 1 attractor r s 1 to prove that r s 1 by theorem 3 4 it suffices to verify that the reduced equations of 2 4 2 8 to the center manifold

satisfy 3 15 also we know that 8 9 1 r 0 if r rc 0 if r rc 0 if r rc therefore 3 15 holds true rayleigh be nard convection 23 5 4 asymptotic structure of solutions by 4 we know that for any initial value 0 u 0 t 0 h there is a time 0 such that the solution u t 0 t t 0 is c for t and is uniformly bounded in cr norm for any given r 1 hence by theorem 2 3 we have 5 27 lim t min r t 0 cr 0 we infer then from 5 25 and 5 26 that for any steady state solution e t r of 2 4 2 8 the vector field e e 1 e 2 can be expressed as 5 28 e 1 r cos 2 l x 1 h 11 x 2 v 1 x 11 y 11 1 e 2 2 l r sin 2 l x 1 h 11 x 2 v 2 x 11 y 11 1 for some 0 2 here 5 29 r x 211 y 2 11 1 r o 1 r if r rc vi x 11 y 11 1 o 1 r for i 1 2 on the other hand it is known that the first eigenfunction h 11 x 2 of 5 2 and 5 3 at r rc is given by h 11 x 2 cos 0 x 2 1 2 0 06 cosh 1 x 2 1 2 cos 2 x 2 1 2 5 30 0 1 sinh 1 x 2 1 2 sin 2 x 2 1 2 where 0 3 97 1 5 2 and 2 2 1 this function is schematically given by figure 5 1 see 2 0 11 2 figure 5 1 24 t ma and s wang now we show that the vector field 5 31 e 0 r cos 2 x 1 l h 11 x 2 2 r l sin 2 x 1 l h 11 x 2 is d regular in r 1 0 1 to this end by 5 30 we see that h 11 x 2 6 0 at x 2 0 1 2 1 h 11 1 2 0 h 11 1 2 6 0 hence det de 0 x 1 x 2 6 0 for any x 1 x 2 kl 2 1 2 with k 1 2 and det 2 e 10 x 1 x 2 2 e 10 x 22 2 e 20 x 1 x 2 2 e 20 x 22 2 r l sin 2 2 x 1 l h 11 x 2 6 0 for any x 1 x 2 2 k 1 l 4 0 or x 1 x 2 2 k 1 l 4 1 with k 1 2 therefore the vector field 5 31 is d regular and consequently the vector fields e in 5 28 are d regular for any rc r rc for some 0 small next we show that the following subspace of h e u t h 1 l 0 1 0 u 1 dx 0 is invariant for 2 4 2 8 in fact we can verify that 5 32 l 0 1 0 p u u idx 0 u h 1 where i 0 1 t is the unit vector in the x 1 direction and p the leray projection indeed by the helmholtz decomposition we have u u i p u u i x 1 for some h 1 hence l 0 1 0 p u u idx l 0 1 0 u u 1 dx 0 the invariance of e for 2 4 2 8 implies that for the vector field e given in 5 28 we have 5 33 1 0 v 1 dx 2 0 rayleigh be nard convection 25 hence in the fourier expansion of e in 5 5 and 5 6 the coefficients of 0 j are zero by the connection lemma in 10 it follows from 5 33 that the vector field e e 1 e 2 of 5 28 is topologically equivalent to the vector field e 0 given by 5 31 which has the topological structure as shown in figure 4 3 for any initial value 0 u 0 t 0 h e 0 k k 0 k 0 0 e 0 k sin x 2 0 0 k 2 m 1 m 0 1 by 5 32 we see that for the operator g in 2 12 g 0 k 0 which implies that the solution of 2 4 2 8 with 2 11 has the following form 5 34 t 0 k ke t 0 k 0 k t 0 where e and 0 k 0 near r rc let k min k k 6 0 and k is odd and let t 0 u t 0 t t 0 be the solution of 2 4 2 8 given by 5 34 then by 5 27 the vector field u t 0 is topologically equivalent to the following vector field for any t t 0 with t 0 0 sufficiently large 5 35 u e ke t 0 k sin k x 2 0 where e is as in 5 28 since the vector field e is d regular and topologically equivalent to the vector field as shown in figure 4 3 then using the method for breaking saddle connections in 10 it is easy to show that the vector field u given by 5 35 is topologically equivalent to the structure as shown in figure 4 2 a if k 0 and to the structure as shown in figure 4 2 b if k 0 for any t t 0 sufficiently large thus the proof of theorem 4 1 is
