fields to explore their property is of interest this paper presents detailed pressure based finite volume simulation of argon arc in the modeling the whole cathode region is coupled to electromagnetic calculations to promise the free change of current density at cathode surface in numerical solutions the upwind difference scheme is chosen to promise the transport property of convective terms and the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm is used to solve thermal pressure by simulations of the free burning argon arc the model shows good agreement with experiment we observe an interesting phenomenon that argon arc concentrates intensively in the high frequency alternating longitudinal magnetic field different from existing constricting mechanisms here arc achieves to be pinched through a continuous transition between shrinking and expansion the underlying mechanism is that via collaborating with arc s motion inertia the applied high frequency alternating magnetic field is able to effectively play a plasma trap role which leads the arc plasma to be imprisoned into a narrower space this may provide a new approach to constrict arc keywords arc plasma alternating magnetic field plasma trap finite volume method simple algorithm 1 introduction in the welding field how to improve the welding quality such as reducing the welding width and increasing the welding depth and cut the production cost is much concerned the direct and effective solution is to reduce the welding area and as well as to elevate the energy flux on the surface of the workpiece for example the laser welding is massively used in precision machining due to its extremely high energy flux 10 8 w m 2 and also very fine focusing performance as the traditional welding technique arc welding is widely applied to industrial fields such as machining metallurgy material processing chemical production and even environmental protection due to arc plasmas high temperature high enthalpy chemical activity and also low cost exploring arc s property is thus meaningful and necessary not only for scientific advance but also for practical applications however owing to the poor welding quality such as the broad welding seam and shallow welding depth the application of arc welding is much limited therefore in the arc welding how to constrict arc as soon as possible has been of interest to researchers tig tungsten inert gas arc is one promising welding arc many methods have been proposed to constrict tig arc direct methods are to increase the welding current 1 2 and to conduct the mechanical and fluid cooling compression some researchers obtain constricted arc by amplifying the ambient pressure 3 4 using the laser arc hybrid welding 5 6 and smearing active fluxes on the anode 7 particularly as early as 1980 s cook and eassa 8 had found that using the high frequency pulsed welding current can also make arc mailto wxliang mail ustc edu cn 2 constricted intensively this method was further confirmed by the recent work 9 10 since arc is the partially ionized gas the applied magnetic field thereby provides a new approach to control arc under the specific magnetic field configuration arc plasma can be confined and make changes in its shape plenty of work has been performed on the magnetically controlled arc for instance some researchers utilized the permanent cusp magnetic field to clamp arc 11 13 zhainakov et al 14 and ukita et al 15 investigated the influence of transverse magnetic field yosuke et al 16 experimentally observed the oscillation scale of a large scale arc arc length is about 40 mm under the alternating transverse magnetic field under the constant longitudinal axial magnetic field it is also found that arc gets contracted 17 19 but when the magnetic field is strong arc plasma easily gets dispersed near the anode and presents a hollow bell shape 20 22 and even totally scattered 23 due to the strong rotation of arc plasma arc plasma is a complex system involving mass momentum heat and electricity transport phenomena conventional theoretical analysis based on simple assumptions is quite hard to describe arc accurately the experiment is also difficult to deeply understand mechanisms underlying many practical problems as conducting the measurement of some physical quantities of arc is challenging the numerical experiment provides a unique opportunity to acquire those quantities by simulating the arc plasma system mostly arc plasma can be treated as the electrically conductive fluid described by magnetohydrodynamics mhd equations the finite volume method fvm which is able to strictly promise the conservativeness of governing equations during numerical solutions and has been widely used in computational fluid dynamics cfd is also taken to solve mhd equations in most of simulations of arc systems 1 12 14 21 22 24 30 these simulations are based on home codes or commercial cfd software however the details of numerical discretization and solution using fvm are rarely shown here we will introduce the detailed implementation of the fvm scheme in modeling of argon arc in our modeling the whole cathode region is coupled to the electromagnetic computation 21 22 28 29 which can make the current density distributed on the cathode surface solved automatically this is more realistic compared with giving some specific distribution of current density near the cathode tip 1 24 27 besides we will also explore the constricting mechanism of arc in the applied magnetic field and try to provide a new approach to confine arc plasmas figure 1 2 d illustration of the whole arc plasma region 2 models and methods in this section we present the detailed numerical solution of arc plasma in terms of the steady free burning b c d cathode anode a f e r g z 3 argon arc shown in fig 1 is the whole arc plasma region selected for analysis in the modeling the cylindrical coordinate system is used and the main assumptions made for arc plasma are as follows the arc is in local thermodynamic equilibrium lte 1 the arc is steady and cylindrically symmetric the gas flow in arc is laminar 2 1 governing equations based on assumptions above the governing equations expressed in cylindrical coordinates z r can be written as the following mass conservation equation t u 0 1 momentum conservation equation t u uu p u j b 2 energy conservation equation t cpt cput k t j j 5 2 kb e j t sr 3 current conservation equation j 0 4 where u u v 0 is velocity and u and v represent the velocities in axial and radial directions respectively p is the plasma pressure j jz jr 0 is current density and jz and jr are respectively the axial and radial current density b 0 0 b is magnetic field strength and b is the self induced magnetic field in the toroidal direction t is temperature k and cp are viscosity thermal conductivity and specific heat respectively kb 1 38 10 23 j k is the boltzmann s constant e 1 6 10 19 c is the electron charge and sr is the radiative source term to solve equations 1 4 some supplemental equations are needed and listed in the following equation of state p rgt 5 ohm s law j e 6 where e ez er 0 is electric field strength and is expressed as e 7 ampere s law b 0 r jzr r 0 dr 8 in eqs 5 8 is the electrical potential in the arc and rg and 0 are the gas constant electrical conductivity and the permeability of vacuum respectively electrical potential can be obtained from the following laplace s equation which is derived from equations 4 6 and 7 0 9 2 2 boundary conditions in the modeling two domains i e a b c d e f a and b c d e f g b are chosen the big one including the whole cathode region is used only to calculate electromagnetic fields while another one is used to solve the mass momentum and energy conservation equations 4 the centerline a b c is the axis of the arc system on this boundary the symmetry condition is employed to independent variables u v p t and at the cathode surface b g f and anode surface c d a no slip condition is postulated for flow velocities in simulations boundaries d e and e f can be chosen to be as far as possible from the arc plasma region so that the fully developed assumption the normal gradient at the boundary is zero i e n 0 is the general variable and even the far field condition close to ambient conditions can be used in the whole arc region a f is the critical boundary through which the current will flow to the tip to induce arc at the boundary a f we use the uniform current density j 0 which is determined via dividing the total arc current by the cross sectional area of cathode these boundary conditions are summarized in table 1 note that due to the assumption of lte the temperature of electrons in the whole arc region is obliged to be equal to the heavy particles in calculations lte is farfetched for arc plasma s fringes where the thermodynamic nonequilibrium would occur leading the current continuity at plasma electrode interfaces to be hard to promise while simulations to handle this problem we have adopted the solutions similar to those in 24 28 29 one can visit these literatures for

implemented by means of the first order euler scheme where the diffusion term is treated implicitly and the convection term is treated explicitly in terms of the momentum equation i e eq 2 we denote by un the approximation of u at time tn n t where the super script n is the natural number and t is the time step length thus the euler semi discretized form is nu n t un pn n 1 u n 1 t n 1 un 1 un 1 jn 1 bn 1 10 similarly the euler semi discretized form for energy equation reads ncp nt n t k tn n 1 cp n 1 t n 1 t n 1 cp n 1 u n 1 t n 1 5 2 kb e j n 1 tn 1 j n 1 j n 1 sr n 1 11 5 figure 2 schematic diagram of the structured grid in the cylindrical coordinate system space discretization we chose the structured grid shown in fig 2 to present the basic idea of fvm in fig 2 the grid consisting of dashed lines produces a group of volumes around calculation nodes and these volumes are next to each other we take the component u of eq 10 to show its discretization in space the differential form of the component u of eq 10 in space is expressed as nun t z un z 1 r r r un r pn z n 1 un 1 t z n 1 un 1 un 1 1 r r r n 1 vn 1 un 1 jr n 1 b n 1 12 integrate the eq 12 over the controlled volume r z r represented by the grid node p in fig 2 and we have i j n ui j n t rp z r r un z n r r un z s r r un r e z r un r w z rp r pn n p s n i j n 1 ui j n 1 t rp z r r n 1 un 1 un 1

j n ui j 1 n r where the subscripts s n e and w represent the four boundaries of the controlled volume the quantities distributed on these boundaries have been assumed to be uniform and can be evaluated by the linear interpolation from node values the eq 13 conveys a clear physical meaning that in unit time the total momentum increment within the controlled volume p is provided by the net momentum that flows into and flows out through the interfaces of the volume p and the forces acting upon the volume p including the pressure viscous resistance and lorentz force note that in the derivation from the eq 12 to the eq 13 the correct discretization form of the pressure gradient p z is rp r pn ps in eq 13 instead of r rnpn rsps or some other forms that is the radius r in front of both pn and ps should be since rp r pn ps represents the discretization for the pressure gradient whereas r rnpn rsps is for the pressure divergence if this detail is not noticed the severe numerical error will occur generally in cartesian coordinates this problem won t happen since the radius r doesn t exist there to promise the transport property of convective terms here we chose the first order upwind difference scheme which is defined as follows i j i 1 j i 1 j i j 1 i j 1 p e w n s w e n s z r r z 6 u d dx i ui i i 1 x ui 0 ui i 1 i x ui 0 14 note that the convective terms considered in this article are general they include not only the mass convection through the interfaces of the controlled volume but also the electricity convection appearing in the energy equation the third term of the right hand of eq 3 the discretization of both mass and electricity convection terms is implemented with the upwind difference scheme take the first order upwind difference into the eq 13 and the right hand of eq 13 will become as su n 1 i j n 1 ui j n 1 t rp z r rn r 2 n n 1 un n 1 un n 1 ui 1 j n 1 ui j n 1 rs r 2 s n 1 us n 1 us n 1 ui j n 1 ui 1 j n 1 re z 2 e n 1 ve n 1 ve n 1 ui j 1

to derive the algebraic equation for solving pressure according to the mass and momentum equations and then to determine the density via the equation of state this idea is the famous simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm 31 and is also used here if pseudo velocities are used the final algebraic equations for solving u and v can be written as the following forms ui j n u i j n di j u p n n p s n 19 vi j n v i j n di j v p e n p w n 20 where u i j n and v i j n are pseudo velocities di j u and di j v are coefficients in front of the pressure after integrating

anode surface has been assumed to be at a fixed temperature of 3000 k in reference 1 the temperature enthalpy distribution at the anode surface was provided by the experimental data which are unknown to us this different treatment of the boundary condition of anode surface may cause the difference in the predicted pressure distribution at anode surface besides the whole cathode region is coupled to calculations in our simulation but it was not considered by hsu et al 1 this may cause the different computed values of d when we utilize the same boundary condition for the current density distribution at the cathode surface as hsu et al 1 the calculated voltage drop d is also very closed to 13 3 v furthermore though we have adopted the boundary condition for the temperature distribution at the anode surface that is different from hsu et al 1 the computed value of jz anode 2 9 10 6 a m 2 is still very close to that in 1 3 1 10 6 a m 2 suggesting that our treatment of the temperature distribution at anode surface has little impact on the current density distribution fig 6 presents spatial distributions of the absolute velocity v u 2 v 2 overpressure relative to the

radial direction and only near the arc s axis except the locations in front of electrodes the velocity v is in the high level the overpressure field is observed to exhibit a tower shape and the intensity of overpressure locally concentrates at the cathode tip and the center of anode surface besides the current density has very high values around 1 6 10 8 a m 2 near the cathode tip these high values have induced the initial triggering of arc the self induced magnetic field intensity b has a peak about 0 045 t locating at the cathode surface which is above the tip these observations are

component the overpressure electrical potential electric field strength and the axial current density consistent with the reference 1 the temperature axial velocity and overpressure all rapidly vary in front of both cathode tip and anode surface and the electrical potential electric field strength and the axial current density only sharply increase or decrease in front of the cathode tip the shear stress generated by the sweep of plasma over the anode surface results in a transfer of momentum from the plasma to anode in practical applications the stress will affect the fluid flow in the weld pool and the subsequent structure of the weld and should be known according to the newton s law of inner friction the shear stress can be defined as follows anode dv dz anode 27 figure 8 radial distribution of the shear stress at the anode surface as shown in fig 8 the shear stress distributed on the anode surface has a peak about 70 n m 2 around r 1 mm besides at both the center of anode surface and the location far from arc plasma region the stress reduces to zero specially the shear stress is observed to have a tail r 2 mm which decays as an simple exponential law the following mathematical function is proposed to describe the whole radial distribution of shear stress anode n m 2 r e r c 0 r 2 mm c 1 e r c 2 r 2 mm 28 where 1 2567 1192 73 c 14 11 c 1 1 32 453 05 and c 2 4 78 r is in m this function has been included in the figure and is observed to well fit data 3 2 constricting arc with alternating magnetic field as mentioned before to constrict arc plasma is of interest to the welding field here we report an unexpected observation that the applied high frequency alternating longitudinal magnetic field is able to make argon arc shrink intensively in this case the local hollow region near the anode which tends to appear in the constant axial magnetic field will disappear and the confinement produced on the arc plasma will also become more effective compared with the constant magnetic field fig 9 in our simulations we find that the strongly shrinked arc is not in a still state but in a dynamic state which continuously switches between shrinking and expansion and the applied alternating magnetic field can play a plasma trap role which succeeds to imprison the arc plasma into a much narrower space this indicates that the dynamic confinement on arc

we need to analyze the motion of arc plasma in our simulations the equation describing plasma s motion is dv dt p 2 s j b 27 where v vz vr v is the velocity vector of arc plasma p is the thermal pressure is the velocity s deformation rate tensor j jz jr 0 is the arc current density and is the viscosity b b 0 z 0 b is the magnetic field vector where b is the arc s self magnetic field induced by the arc current density jz and b 0 z is the applied high frequency alternating axial magnetic field see fig 12 eq 27 has assumed that the arc flow is laminar and the weak toroidal current produced by arc s rotation is negligible eq 27 suggests that the forces arc plasma mainly sustains during its motion mainly include the pressure viscous force and lorentz force within the real arc the motion path along which a small cluster of plasma runs from the cathode to anode is generally a complicated curve and there is no force balance in axial or radial directions even for the simplest free burning arc see fig 5 to simplify the analysis and also without the loss of generality we can analyze a simpler arc plasma system that the whole arc plasma region is cylindrical shaped and is infinitely long so that the arc property in each axial plane is similar when this system is under the constant axial magnetic field a small cluster of plasma with a mass of me and volume ve will do the helical motion at constant speeds of v and vz and the radius of r 0 the centripetal force for the circular motion fc mev 2 r 0 is mainly provided by the sum fr of the radial pressure and the lorentz force fbr jzb always in r direction in the circumferential direction the lorentz force fbt jrb 0 z which is produced by the applied magnetic field and induces arc plasma to rotate is balanced with the viscous resistance f t induced by the velocity shear if at one point the applied longitudinal magnetic field is in reverse direction fbt will also be in the opposite direction immediately and become fbt and then work together with the viscous resistance f t to drag this small cluster to slow down its rotation fig 10 a during the slowing down of rotation this cluster will be gradually hauled to the lower orbit by the relatively stronger sucking force the radial force fr this process seems very similar to the well known phenomenon that artificial satellites always fall down under the earth gravity once their speed slows down due to some factors in the process that the cluster rotates inward the lorentz force fbr which drives the cluster to move inward will further increase since jz and b will be strengthened according to the current conservation this additional effect will further drive the cluster to move 5 0 5 x 10 3 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 x 10 3 x m y m 5 0 5 x 10 3 6 4 2 0 2

however after reducing to zero the rotation speed of the cluster will increase gradually in the opposite direction see fig 12 meanwhile the inward radial force fr will decrease slowly and then increase in the outward direction r direction therefore after moving inward a specific distance this minor cluster will rotate outward the rotation speed of plasma in the alternating magnetic field is smaller than in the constant magnetic field on the time weighted average because the alternating magnetic field causes arc s rotation to undergo extra slowing down processes thereby this cluster cannot return to the original orbit that is under the constant magnetic field after several rounds of above repetitive process this small cluster of plasma will finally do the continuous inward and outward rotation motion within a narrower annular space of the inner radius r 2 and the outer radius r 1 the cluster of plasma seems to be imprisoned into an annular trap and cannot escape from it any more figure 10 illustration of the motion of arc plasma in the alternating longitudinal magnetic field the back and forth motion in the radial direction in fig 10 a can be further abstracted to the motion of a spring oscillator in fig 10 b when the cluster is at r 1 its velocity is zero but it sustains the largest inward pulling force so it will then move in the opposite direction until reaching r 2 at r 2 the velocity reduces to zero again but at this time it sustains the largest outward pushing force in this way the cluster repeatedly moves between locations r 1 and r 2 of course within a real arc plasma s motion will be more complicated but the general process is similar we call the role played by the applied high frequency alternating longitudinal magnetic field in arc the plasma trap which can effectively pinch the arc plasma some similar concepts using the proper magnetic field to confine charged particles have already been put forward and applied like the famous paul trap 35 which has been applied to the long distance confinement of charged particle beam in the accelerator note that in the applied alternating axial magnetic field it is basically the arc s inertia nature that is at work and causes the arc to further shrink one can imagine that if all arc parameters e g the rotation speed finish their changes instantly as the applied magnetic field does only the rotation direction of plasmas will become opposite which will hardly make arc to shrink the alternating magnetic field actually provides the proper chance for plasma s motion inertia to play its role this can be proved by the results shown in fig 12 where the deceleration relaxation time about 0 2 ms of arc s rotation speed is much extended relative to the zero time that the magnetic field takes to change its direction fig 11 shows the relaxation process of tig arc in the alternating longitudinal magnetic field initially t 0 arc is in the constant axial magnetic field fig 11 a at this time the alternating magnetic field with a frequency of 1 5 khz is imposed and its direction becomes opposite when t 0 333 ms it can be observed that the first arc shrinking fig 11 b occurs at 0 4 ms evidently after undergoing several shrinking and expansion cycles the arc finally reaches a stable dynamic state and continuously shrinks and expands between the two states o r 2 r 1 r 0 fbt f t fr fbt r f t r o r 2 r 1 r 0 b a motion track 15 shown in figs 11 c d in the meantime the local hollow region which tends to occur near the anode in the constant axial magnetic field is also observed to disappear these results indicate that in the alternating magnetic field the arc achieves to be pinched through the continuous dynamic transition between shrinking and expansion the change in the spatial distribution of the arc current density in the axial plane also shows the more effective confinement of alternating magnetic field on the arc plasma compared with the constant magnetic field

resultant radial force fr toroidal velocity vt and the toroidal force ft at the position of z 2 mm and r 1 mm b 0 z 30 mt and fm 1 5 khz fig 12 plots evolutions of some key arc parameters at one fixed location after the arc reaches its stable state in the applied magnetic field evolutions of these parameters are observed to be generally consistent with previous analysis in addition the stable periodic evolutions of these parameters suggest that the final arc is stably in a rapid radial oscillation state note that under the alternating magnetic field the final arc still shrinks and expands continuously and has no fixed geometric configuration the arc current density given in fig 9 is the time average result within one magnetic field period in our simulations we also observed that for one specific magnetic field intensity there exists one optimal frequency fop that can pinch the arc plasma most effectively fop 1 5 khz when b 0 z 30 mt the reason may be that the arc has its own eigen frequency when the applied magnetic field frequency is close to this value then the arc is more likely to interact with the external magnetic field and get better confined it is also observed that the confinement of high frequency alternating axial magnetic field on arc plasma is effective within the range b 0 z 10 100 mt 4 summary the detailed pressure based finite volume simulation of arc is presented the model is validated with experiment in case of the free burning argon arc under the atmospheric pressure the shear stress on the anode surface is observed to have a peak around r 1 mm and an exponentially decaying tail r 2 mm we observe an interesting phenomenon that arc can be constricted by the applied high frequency alternating longitudinal magnetic field the final arc is in the relaxation dynamics which continuously switches between shrinking and expansion and the confinement produced by the alternating magnetic field is more effective than the constant magnetic field the behind mechanism is that the applied high frequency alternating magnetic field is able to cooperate with plasma s motion inertia to effectively play the plasma trap role which imprisons the arc plasma into a narrower space our result suggests that the dynamic confinement to some extent is better this finding not only helps to get a deeper insight into behaviors of arc but also provides a potential approach to confine arc plasmas references 1 k c hsu k etemadi and e pfender j appl phys 54 1293 1301 1983 2 a gleizes j j gonzalez and p freton j phys d appl phys 38 r 153 r 183 2005 3 y
