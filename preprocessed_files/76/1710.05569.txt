ar x iv 1 71 0 05 56 9 v 4 m at h a p 1 7 a ug 2 01 9 a regularity criterion for the navier stokes equation involving only the middle eigenvalue of the strain tensor evan miller 1 1 the university of toronto department of mathematics ep miller mail utoronto ca august 20 2019 abstract this manuscript derives an evolution equation for the symmetric part of the gradient of the velocity the strain tensor in the incompressible navier stokes equation on r 3 and proves the existence of l 2 mild solutions to this equation we use this equation to obtain a simplified identity for the growth of enstrophy for mild solutions that depends only on the strain tensor not on the nonlocal interaction of the strain tensor with the vorticity the resulting identity allows us to prove a new family of scale critical necessary and sufficient conditions for the blow up of a solution at some finite time tmax which depend only on the history of the positive part of the second eigenvalue of the strain matrix since this matrix is trace free this severely restricts the geometry of any finite time blow up this regularity criterion provides analytic evidence of the numerically observed tendency of the vorticity to align with the eigenvector corresponding to the middle eigenvalue of the strain matrix this regularity criterion also allows us to prove as a corollary a new scale critical one component type regularity criterion for a range of exponents for which there were previously no known critical one component type regularity criteria furthermore our analysis permits us to extend the known time of existence of smooth solutions with fixed initial enstrophy e 0 1 2 u 0 2 l 2 by a factor of 4 920 75 although the previous constant in the literature was not expected to be close to optimal so this improvement is less drastic than it sounds especially compared with numerical results finally we will prove the existence and stability of blow up for a toy model ode for the strain equation

http arxiv org abs 1710 05569 v 4 https doi org 10 1007 s 00205 019 01419 z 1 introduction the navier stokes equations are the fundamental equations of fluid dynamics the incompressible navier stokes equations are given by tu u u u p 0 u 0 1 1 where u r 3 denotes the velocity and p the pressure for incompressible flow with no external force the pressure is completely determined by u by taking the divergence of both sides of the equation which yields p 3 i j 1 ui xj uj xi 1 2 the navier stokes equation which is best viewed as an evolution equation on the space of diver gence free vector fields rather than as a system of equations is nonlocal because of the nonlocal dependence of p on u much about the solutions of the navier stokes equation is unknown in cluding uniqueness and regularity the main barrier is the fact that the energy equality which states that for any smooth solution u of the navier stokes equation 1 2 u t 2 l 2 t 0 u 2 l 2 d 1 2 u 0 2 l 2 1 3 implies l t l 2 x l 2 t h 1 x control on solutions but this control is supercritical in three spatial dimen sions with respect to the scaling u x t u x 2 t that preserves the solution set of 1 1 in this paper we will prove new conditional regularity results based on an analysis of the role of the strain tensor we will begin by defining a few matrices the gradient tensor will be given by u ij uj xi 1 4 the symmetric part s which we will refer to as the strain tensor will be given by sij 1 2 uj xi ui xj 1 5 and the anti symmetric part a will be given by aij 1 2 uj xi ui xj 1 6 it is immediately clear that s is symmetric a is anti symmetric and that u s a we also define the differential operator sym as the map from a vector to the symmetric part of its gradient tensor sym v ij 12 vj xi vi xj we will also note that in three spatial dimensions the anti symmetric matrix a can be represented as a vector which we will call the vorticity the vorticity given by the curl of the flow u plays a very important role in fluid mechanics it is related to a by a 1 2 0 3 2 3 0 1 2 1 0 1 7 2 the equation for the evolution of vorticity is written as follows t u s 0 1 8 the vortex stretching term s is often written u but it is clear from 1 7 that a 0 therefore u s a 1 9 s 1 10 the vorticity equation 1 8 is also a nonlocal equation because u 1 the vortex stretching term s is the quadratic nonlinearity but does not have a very natural structure relative to the space of divergence free vector fields for this reason we will consider the evolution equation for the strain tensor in three spatial dimensions the evolution equation for the strain is given by ts u s s s 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 hess p 0 1 11 as we will show in the next section the strain tensor has already been studied 16 19 39 in terms of its importance for enstrophy production in the vorticity equation 1 8 the evolution equation for the strain tensor while it requires additional terms has a quadratic nonlinearity whose structure is far better from an algebraic point of view this is because while a vector cannot be squared and the square of an anti symmetric matrix the other representation of vorticity is a symmetric matrix the square of a symmetric matrix is again a symmetric matrix it is well known that t 1 2 t 2 l 2 2 h 1 s 1 12 using the sobolev embedding of h 1 r 3 into l 6 r 3 it follows from 1 12 that t t 2 l 2 c t 6 l 2 1 13 which is sufficient to guarantee regularity at least locally in time but cannot prevent blowup because it is a cubic differential inequality enstrophy can be defined equivalently as e t 1 2 u t 2 l 2 1 14 1 2 t 2 l 2 1 15 s t 2 l 2 1 16 we will prove the equivalence of these definitions in section 3 in this paper we will prove an identity for enstrophy growth t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 3 tr s 3 1 17 using the fact that s must be trace free because tr s u 0 this identity can also be expressed in terms of the determinant of s as t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 det s 1 18 3 the nonlinearity in 1 17 is still of the same degree as in 1 12 both nonlinearities are of degree 3 and so cannot be controlled by the dissipation in either case however the identity 1 17 does have several advantages first unlike 1 12 this identity is entirely local the identity 1 12 is nonlocal with a singular integral kernel because s can be determined in terms of with a zeroth order pseudo differential operator s sym 1 the identity 1 17 also reveals very significant information about the eigenvalues of the strain tensor s and their relation to blowup note that throughout this paper h s will refer to the homogeneous sobolev space with the norm f 2 h s f sf 1 19 and we will take the magnitude of a matrix m r 3 3 to be the euclidean norm m 2 3 i j 1 m 2 ij 1 20 finally the identity 1 18 will lead to a new regularity criterion that encodes information about the geometric structure of potential blow up solutions the main result of this paper is theorem 1 1 middle eigenvalue of strain characterizes blowup time let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation and let 1 x 2 x 3 x be the eigenvalues of the strain tensor s x symu x let 2 x max 2 x 0 if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp cq t 0 2 t p lq r 3 dt 1 21 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if tmax where tmax is the maximal existence time for a smooth solution then tmax 0 2 t p lq r 3 dt 1 22 it goes back to the classic work of kato 20 that smooth solutions must exist locally in time for any initial data u 0 lq r 3 u 0 0 when q 3 in particular this implies that a smooth solution of the navier stokes equations developing singularities in finite time requires that the lq norm of u must blow up for all q 3 this was extended to the case q 3 by escauriaza seregin and s vera k 13 the regularity criteria implied by the local existence of smooth solutions for initial data in lq r 3 when q 3 are all subcritical with respect to the scaling that preserves the solution set of the navier stokes equations u x t u x 2 t 1 23 if u is a solution to the navier stokes equations on r 3 then so is u for all 0 although the time interval may have to be adjusted depending on what notion of a solution leray hopf 28 mild strong 15 we are using l 3 r 3 is the scale critical lebesgue space for the navier stokes equations so the escauriaza seregin s vera k condition is scale critical critical regularity criteria for solutions to the navier stokes equations go back to the work of prodi serrin and ladyzhenskaya 26 31 35 who proved that if a smooth solution u of the navier stokes equation blows up in finite time then tmax 0 u p lq dt 1 24 4 where 2 p 3 q 1 and 3 q this result was then extended in the aforementioned escauriaza seregin s vera k paper 13 to the endpoint case p q 3 they proved that if a smooth solution u of the navier stokes equation blows up in finite time then lim sup t tmax u t l 3 r 3 1 25 gallagher koch and planchon 17 also proved the above statement using a different approach based on profile decomposition the other endpoint case of this family of regularity criteria is the beale kato majda criterion 3 which holds for euler as well as for navier stokes and states that if a smooth solution to either the euler or navier stokes equations develops singularities in finite time then tmax 0 t l dt 1 26 this result was also extended to the strain tensor 21 the regularity criterion in theorem 1 1 also offers analytical evidence of the numerically ob served tendency 16 of the vorticity to align with the eigenvector of s corresponding to the inter mediate eigenvalue 2 if it is true that the vorticity tends to align with the intermediate eigenvalue we would heuristically expect that tr s x x x 2 x x 2 1 27 we would then heuristically expect that s r 3 2 x x 2 dx 1 28 and so we would expect that there would be some inequality of the form s c r 3 2 x x 2 dx 1 29 this is all of course entirely heuristic but it is interesting that the regularity criterion we have proven is precisely of the form that would be predicted by the observed tendency of the vorticity to align with the eigenvector associated with the intermediate eigenvalue this suggests that significant information about the geometric structure of incompressible flow is encoded in the regularity criterion in theorem 1 1 the family of regularity criteria in 1 24 has since been generalized to the critical besov spaces 1 10 18 23 24 30 these criteria have also been generalized to criteria controlling the pressure 33 36 38 in addition to strengthening regularity criteria to larger spaces there have also been results not involving all the components of u for instance regularity criteria on the gradient of one component uj 40 involving only the derivative in one direction xiu 25 involving only one component uj 7 8 involving only one component of the gradient tensor uj xi 4 and involving only two components of the vorticity 6 for a more thorough overview of the literature on regularity criteria for solutions to the navier stokes equation see chapter 11 in 27 we will discuss the relationship between these results and our main theorem further in section 5 where we will prove the following critical one direction type regularity criterion for a range of exponents for which no critical one component regularity criteria were previously known first we must define for any unit vector v r 3 v 1 the directional derivative in the v direction which is given by v v and the v th component of u which is given by uv u v 5 theorem 1 2 one direction regularity criterion let vn t n n r 3 with vn t 1 let n t n n r 3 be lebesgue measurable sets such that for all m 6 n m t n t and r 3 n n n t let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp cq t 0 n 1 1 2 vnu t 1 2 uvn t q lq n t p q dt 1 30 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if the maximal existence time for a smooth solution tmax then tmax 0 n 1 vnu t uvn t q lq n t p q dt 1 31 note that if we take vn t 0 0 1 for each n n then 1 31 reduces to tmax 0 3 u t u 3 t plq r 3 dt 1 32 theorem 1 2 is in fact a corollary of the following more general theorem which states that for a solution of the navier stokes equation to blow up the strain must blow up in every direction theorem 1 3 blowup requires the strain to blow up in every direction let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation and let v l r 3 0 tmax r 3 with v x t 1 almost everywhere if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp cq t 0 s t v t p lq r 3 dt 1 33 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if the maximal existence time for a smooth solution tmax then tmax 0 s t v t p lq r 3 dt 1 34 note that like the prodi serrin ladyzhenskaya regularity criterion the regularity criteria we prove on 2 and 3 u u 3 are critical with respect to scaling the reason we require that 2 p 3 q 2 not 2 p 3 q 1 is because 2 is an eigenvalue of s and therefore scales like u not like u in addition both regularity criteria can be generalized to the navier stokes equation with an external force f l 2 tl 2 x which will be discussed in section 5 but is left out of the introduction for the sake of brevity in section 2 we will derive the evolution equation for the strain tensor in section 3 we will consider the relationship between the strain and the vorticity and will prove a hilbert space isometry between them in section 4 we will use the evolution equation for the strain tensor and the hilbert space isometry to prove the simplified growth identity for enstrophy in section 5 6 we will prove theorem 1 1 the regularity criterion in terms of 2 and obtain new one direction regularity criteria as immediate corollaries in section 6 we will prove the existence and stability of blowup for a toy model ode of the strain evolution equation and examine the asymptotics of the spectrum of eigenvalues approaching blowup finally we will note that while we have proven our results on the whole space they apply equally on the torus with more or less identical proofs the only difference will be that some of the constants may have different values as the sharp sobolev constants may be different on the torus remark 1 4 following submission of this paper the author learned of previous work by dongho chae on the role of the eigenvalues of the strain matrix in enstrophy growth in the context of the euler equation 5 in this paper chae proves that sufficiently smooth solutions to the euler equation satisfy the following growth identity for enstrophy t s t 2 l 2 4 det s 1 35 this is analogous to what we have proven for the growth of enstrophy for solutions of the navier stokes equation 1 18 without the dissipation term because the euler equation has no viscosity the methods used are somewhat different than ours in particular the constraint space for the strain tensor and the evolution equation for the strain tensor are not used in 5 while it is possible to establish the identity 1 18 without an analysis of the constraint space we expect the results characterizing the constraint space in this paper particularly proposition 2 3 and proposition 2 4 to be useful in future investigations chae also proves the q case of the regularity criterion in theorem 1 1 but this criterion is new for the rest of the range of parameters we will discuss the relationship between our method of proof and that in 5 in more detail after we have proven the identity 1 18 which is corollary 4 6 in this paper the author would like to thank alexander kiselev for bringing chae s paper to his attention 2 evolution equation for the strain tensor we will begin this section by deriving the navier stokes strain equation 1 11 in three spatial dimensions proposition 2 1 strain reformulation of the dynamics suppose u is a classical solution to the navier stokes equation then s sym u is a classical solution to the navier stokes strain equation ts u s s s 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 hess p 0 2 1 proof we begin by applying the operator sym to the navier stokes equation 1 1 we find im mediately that ts s hess p sym u u 0 2 2 it remains to compute sym u u sym u u ij 1 2 xi 3 k 1 uk uj xk 1 2 xj 3 k 1 uk ui xk 2 3 7 sym u u ij 3 k 1 uk xk 1 2 uj xi ui xj 1 2 3 k 1 uk xi uj xk ui xk uk xj 2 4 we can see from our definitions of s and a that s 2 ij 1 4 3 k 1 uk xi ui xk uj xk uk xj 2 5 1 4 3 k 1 uk xi uj xk ui xk uk xj uk xi uk xj ui xk uj xk 2 6 and a 2 ij 1 4 3 k 1 uk xi ui xk uj xk uk xj 2 7 1 4 3 k 1 uk xi uj xk ui xk uk xj uk xi uk xj ui xk uj xk 2 8 taking the sum of these two equation we find that s 2 a 2 ij 1 2 3 k 1 uk xi uj xk ui xk uk xj 2 9 from this we can conclude that sym u u u s s 2 a 2 2 10 recall that a 1 2 0 3 2 3 0 1 2 1 0 2 11 so we can express a 2 as a 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 2 12 this concludes the proof we also can see that tr s u 0 so in order to maintain the divergence free structure of the flow we require that the strain tensor be trace free for the vorticity the only consistency condition is that the vorticity be divergence free any divergence free vorticity can be inverted back to a unique velocity field assuming suitable decay at infinity with u 1 w this is not true of the strain tensor for which an additional consistency condition is required if we know the strain tensor s this is enough for us to reconstruct the flow we take 2 div s u u 2 13 u 2 14 therefore we find that u 2 div 1 s 2 15 8 this allows us to reconstruct the flow u from the strain tensor s but it doesn t guarantee that if we start with a general trace free symmetric matrix the u we reconstruct will actually have this symmetric matrix as its strain tensor we will need to define a consistency condition guarantee ing that the strain tensor is actually the symmetric part of the gradient of some divergence free vector field this condition for the strain equation will play the same role that the divergence free condition plays in the vorticity equation we will now define the subspace of strain matrices l 2 st l 2 r 3 s 3 3 definition 2 2 strain subspace we will define the subspace of strain matrices to be l 2 st 1 2 u 1 2 u u h 1 r 3 r 3 u 0 2 16 this subspace of l 2 r 3 s 3 3 can in fact be characterized by a partial differential equation although in this case it is significantly more complicated than the equation u 0 that char acterizes the space of divergence free vector fields proposition 2 3 characterization of the strain subspace suppose s l 2 r 3 s 3 3 then s l 2 st if and only if s 2 sym div s 0 2 17 tr s 0 2 18 because by hypothesis we only have s l 2 we will consider s to be a solution to 2 17 if the condition is satisfied pointwise almost everywhere in fourier space that is if 2 s s s 0 2 19 almost everywhere r 3 also note that the matrix pde 2 17 can be written out in components as sij 3 k 1 xi xkskj xj xkski 0 2 20 proof first suppose s l 2 st so there exists a u h 1 u 0 such that s symu 2 21 as we have already shown tr s u 0 next we will take the divergence of 2 21 and find that 2 div s 2 div symu 2 22 u u 2 23 u 2 24 applying sym to 2 24 we find that 2 sym div s sym u 2 25 s 2 26 so the condition 2 17 is also satisfied 9 now suppose tr s 0 and s 2 sym div s 0 define u by u 1 2 div s 2 27 applying sym to this definition we find that symu 1 2 sym div s 2 28 1 s 2 29 s 2 30 clearly u h 1 because s l 2 and 1 2 div is a pseudo differential operator with order 1 it only remains to show that u 0 next we will take the trace of 2 20 and find that div 2 s 3 i j 1 xi xjsij 0 2 31 using this we compute that u 1 2 div 2 s 0 2 32 this completes the proof note that the the consistency condition 2 17 is linear so the set of matrices satisfying it form a subspace of l 2 the navier stokes equation 1 1 and the vorticity equation 1 8 can best be viewed not as systems of equations but as evolution equations on the space of divergence free vector fields similarly we can view the navier stokes strain equation 1 11 as an evolution equation on l 2 st the navier stokes strain equation has already been examined in 12 16 however the consistency condition 2 17 does not play a role in this analysis in 16 the authors focus on the relationship between vorticity and the strain tensor in enstrophy production as the strain tensor and vorticity are related by a linear zero order pseudo differential operator s sym 1 however the consistency condition is actually very useful in dealing with the evolution of the strain tensor because a number of the terms in the evolution equation 1 11 are actually in the orthogonal compliment of l 2 st with respect to the l 2 inner product this will allow us to prove an identity for enstrophy growth involving only the strain where previous identities involved the interaction of the strain and the vorticity we will now make an observation about what matrices in l 2 r 3 s 3 3 are in the orthogonal complement of l 2 st with respect to the l 2 inner product proposition 2 4 orthogonal subspaces for all f h 2 r 3 for all g l 2 r 3 and for all s l 2 st s gi 3 0 2 33 s hess f 0 2 34 proof first we ll consider the case of gi 3 fix s l 2 st and we ll take the inner product gi 3 s r 3 3 i j 1 giijsij r 3 tr s g 0 2 35 10 in order to show that hess f l 2 st we will use the property that for s l 2 st tr s 3 i j 1 xi xjsij 0 2 36 because s l 2 and therefore s l 2 the above condition can be expressed as 3 i j 1 i j s ij 0 2 37 almost everywhere r 3 using the fact that the fourier transform is an isometry on l 2 and hess f s l 2 we compute that hess f s h ess f s 4 2 r 3 f 3 i j 1 i j s ij d 0 2 38 this means that as long as u is sufficiently regular hess p and 1 4 2 i 3 are in the orthogonal compliment of l 2 st this fact will play a key role in the new identity for enstrophy growth that we will prove in section 4 3 the relationship between strain and vorticity we have already established in 2 15 that u 2 div 1 s the antisymmetric part of the gradient tensor then can be reconstructed applying a zeroth order pseudo differential operator to s we find that a 1 s 1 s 3 1 because this is a zeroth order operator related to the riesz transform it is bounded from lp to lp for 1 p but we will only have calderon zygmund type estimates so our control will be very bad we can say something much stronger in the case of l 2 and in fact for every hilbert space h 3 2 3 2 proposition 3 1 hilbert space isometries for all 3 2 3 2 and for all u divergence free in the sense that u 0 almost everywhere s 2 h a 2 h 1 2 2 h 1 2 u 2 h 3 2 proof first fix s 3 2 s 3 2 we will begin relating the hs norms of the anti symmetric part and the vorticity recall that a 1 2 0 3 2 3 0 1 2 1 0 3 3 therefore for all x r 3 s 2 a x 2 1 2 s 2 x 2 3 4 11 because in general we have that f h s s 2 f l 2 it immediately follows that a 2 h s 1 2 2 h s 3 5 because u is divergence free in fourier space 2 i u 3 6 2 u 3 7 u 3 8 from this we can conclude that 2 h s u 2 h s 3 9 finally we will compute s 2 u 2 tr s 2 s s 2 a s 2 s s 2 a 3 10 however we know that the trace of the product of a symmetric matrix and an antisymmetric matrix is always zero so we can immediately see that s 2 u 2 s 2 s 2 s 2 a 2 3 11 from this it follows that u 2 h s s 2 h s a 2 h s 3 12 but we have already established that a 2 h s 1 2 u 2 h s 3 13 so we can conclude that a 2 h s s 2 h s 1 2 u 2 h s 3 14 this concludes the proof we have now established all the necessary basics and will proceed to considering enstrophy growth in terms of the strain and vorticity equations 4 enstrophy and the l 2 growth of the strain tensor before proceeding further however we need to show the existence of solutions in a suitable space leray solutions first developed in the classic paper 28 are not the most well adapted to the navier stokes strain equation so we will work with mild solutions instead 15 we will begin by defining mild solutions in h 1 to the navier stokes equations and then adapt this definition for mild solutions in l 2 to the navier stokes strain equation and the vorticity equation thus far we have only considered the navier stokes equation with no external force therefore it is now necessary to state some definitions involving an external force f for the incompressible navier stokes equations with a force we still require that u 0 but now the evolution equation is given by tu u u u p f 4 1 12 the evolution equation for the vorticity is now given by t u s f 4 2 and the evolution equation for the strain is given by ts u s s s 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 hess p symf 4 3 we will define a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with an external force as follows definition 4 1 mild velocity solutions suppose u c 0 t h 1 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 then u is a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with external force f l 2 0 t l 2 r 3 if u 0 in l 2 and u t et u 0 t 0 e t u u p f d 4 4 where p is defined in terms of u and f by convolution with the poisson kernel p 1 3 i j 1 uj xi ui xj f 4 5 and where et is the heat operator given by convolution with the heat kernel that is to say et u 0 is the solution of the heat equation after time t with initial data u 0 now we can define a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation accordingly definition 4 2 mild strain solutions suppose s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 then we will call s a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation 1 11 with external force f l 2 0 t l 2 r 3 if and only if for all 0 t t s t et s 0 t 0 e t u s s 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 hess p symf d 4 6 where u 2 div 1 s u and p 1 s 2 1 2 2 f it is a classical result that h 1 mild solutions to the navier stokes equation exist locally in time we will state this result precisely and then use the result to establish local in time existence of l 2 mild solutions to the navier stokes strain equation theorem 4 3 mild velocity solutions exist for short times suppose f 0 then there exists a constant c 0 such that for all u 0 h 1 r 3 u 0 0 for all 0 t c u 0 4 h 1 there exists a unique mild solution to the navier stokes equation u c 0 t h 1 r 3 furthermore for all 0 t u c t h r 3 for all 1 and therefore u c 0 t r 3 r 3 in the case where f 6 0 for all u 0 h 1 r 3 u 0 and all f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 there exists 0 t t and u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 such that u is a mild solution to the navier stokes equation note that mild solutions with a nonsmooth force are not smooth in general because the bootstrapping argument for higher regularity will not work in this case 13 this is the classical result 15 of fujita and kato it has since been generalized to weaker spaces 7 22 the result is proven using an iteration scheme using this result we can easily use the properties of the heat semigroup to establish the local existence in time of l 2 mild solutions to the navier stokes strain equation theorem 4 4 mild strain solutions exist for short times suppose f 0 then there exists a constant c 0 such that for all s 0 l 2 st if t c 4 s 0 4 l 2 then there exists a unique mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation 1 11 s c 0 t l 2 st furthermore for all 0 t s c t h for all 0 and therefore s c 0 t r 3 in the case where f 6 0 for all s 0 l 2 st and all f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 there exists 0 tmax t and s c 0 tmax l 2 st l 2 0 tmax h 1 r 3 such that s is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation proof we begin by inverting the strain tensor s 0 to recover the initial velocity u 0 2 div 1 s 0 4 7 we can see from the pseudo differential operator used to obtain u 0 that s 0 l 2 implies u 0 h 1 this means that we can apply the theorem above to show that there exists t 0 such that there is a h 1 mild solution u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 with u 0 u 0 that is for all 0 t t u t et u 0 t 0 e t u u p f d 4 8 next we will compute s symu clearly s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 when taking the derivative of a convolution the derivative can be applied to either of the functions being convolved in this case we will apply the differential operator sym to u 0 and u u p and find that s t et s 0 t 0 e t u s s 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 hess p symf d 4 9 finally the higher order regularity of a mild solution u when f 0 proved by kato and fujita in 15 immediately implies higher order regularity for s symu this completes the proof now that existence of mild solutions in a suitable space is ensured we can use the navier stokes strain equation to simplify the identity for enstrophy growth theorem 4 5 enstrophy growth identity suppose s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation then almost everywhere 0 t t t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 3 r 3 tr s 3 u f 4 10 proof using 1 8 we can compute the rate of change of enstrophy t 1 2 t 2 l 2 u s f 4 11 14 next we can integrate by parts to show that f f u and u 0 using the divergence free condition in the latter case therefore we find that t 1 2 t 2 l 2 2 h 1 s u f 4 12 this is the standard identity for enstrophy growth based on the interaction of the strain matrix and the vorticity see chapter 7 in 27 for more details we can use the isometry in proposition 2 4 to restate 4 12 in terms of strain t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 s u f 4 13 however we can also calculate the l 2 growth of the strain tensor directly from our evolution equation for the strain tensor 1 11 t s t 2 l 2 2 s s 2 u s s 2 s 2 s 1 2 s 2 hess p s 1 2 2 i 3 s 2 symf s 4 14 integrating by parts we know that u s s 0 note that s c 0 t l 2 l 2 0 t h 1 in particular this implies that s t t l 2 l 6 almost everywhere 0 t t this means that s t t l 3 so s and tr s 3 are both well defined this also means that t 2 hess p t l 2 for almost all 0 t t therefore we can apply proposition 2 4 and find that 2 i 3 hess p l 2 st so 1 2 2 i 3 s 0 4 15 hess p s 0 4 16 now we can use the fact that s is symmetric to compute that s 2 s r 3 tr s 3 4 17 and that 2 symf s 2 f s 4 18 f 2 div s 4 19 f u 4 20 putting all of these together we find that t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 1 2 s 2 r 3 tr s 3 u f 4 21 we now will add 1 3 4 13 to 2 3 4 21 to cancel the term s and we find t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 3 r 3 tr s 3 u f 4 22 finally we will note that because the subcritical quantity s t l 2 is controlled uniformly on 0 t the smoothing due to the heat kernel guarantees that s is smooth when f 0 so the identity 4 10 can be understood as a derivative of a smooth quantity in the classical sense in this case when f 6 0 we cannot assume that s c 1 0 t l 2 r 3 which is why we can only say the identity holds almost everywhere in the general case with a nonzero external force 15 now that we have improved the estimate for enstrophy growth from one that involved the interaction of the vorticity and the strain tensor to an estimate that only involves the strain tensor we can still extract more geometric information about the flow however the identity for enstrophy growth in theorem 4 5 can also be expressed in terms of det s corollary 4 6 alternative enstrophy growth identity suppose s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation then for almost all 0 t t t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 r 3 det s u f 4 23 proof because s is symmetric it will be diagonalizable with three real eigenvalues and because s is trace free we have tr s 1 2 3 0 this allows us to relate tr s 3 to det s by tr s 3 31 3 2 3 3 4 24 31 3 2 1 2 3 4 25 3 21 2 3 1 22 4 26 3 1 2 1 2 4 27 3 1 2 3 4 28 3 det s 4 29 therefore we can write our identity for enstrophy growth as t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 r 3 det s u f 4 30 this completes the proof remark 4 7 as mentioned in the introduction dongho chae proved the analogous result t s t 2 l 2 4 r 3 det s 4 31 in the context of smooth solutions to the euler equation with no external force 5 in this paper he shows directly that t 1 2 u t 2 l 2 u u u r 3 tr s 3 1 4 s 4 32 in the context of the euler equation the familiar estimate for enstrophy growth following from the vorticity equation is t 1 2 u t 2 l 2 t 1 2 t 2 l 2 s 4 33 adding 4 3 4 32 and 1 3 4 33 it follows that t s t 2 l 2 t 1 2 u t 2 l 2 4 3 r 3 tr s 3 4 r 3 det s 4 34 16 the identity for enstrophy growth in corollary 4 6 gives us a significantly better understanding of enstrophy production than the classical enstrophy growth identity 4 12 because we now have the growth controlled solely in terms of the strain tensor rather than both the strain tensor and the vorticity this estimate also provides analytical confirmation of the well known result that the vorticity tends to align with the eigenvector corresponding to the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain matrix 16 39 comparing the identities in 4 10 4 12 and 4 23 we see that s 4 r 3 det s 4 3 tr s 3 4 35 when det s tends to be positive it means there are two negative eigenvalues and one positive eigenvalue so s being negative means the vorticity tends to align on average when in tegrating over the whole space with the negative eigenspaces likewise when det s tends to be negative it means there are two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue so s being positive means the vorticity tends to align on average when integrating over the whole space with the positive eigenspaces when det s tends to be zero when integrated over the whole space the vorticity tends clearly to be aligned with the intermediate eigenvalue as well growth in all cases geometrically corresponds to the strain matrix s stretching in two directions while strongly contracting in the third direction finally we will bound the growth rate of enstrophy in terms of the size of the strain matrix and see what this matrix looks like in the sharp case of this bound proposition 4 8 determinant bound let m be a three by three symmetric trace free matrix then 4 det m 2 9 6 m 3 4 36 with equality if and only if 1 2 1 2 3 where 1 2 3 are the eigenvalues of m proof in the case where m 0 it holds trivially in the case where m 6 0 then we have 1 0 3 0 this allows us to define a parameter r 1 3 the two parameters 3 and r completely define the system because 1 r 3 and 2 1 3 r 1 3 we must now say something about the range of values the parameter r can take on 1 2 3 implies that r r 1 1 so therefore 1 2 r 2 now we can observe that 4 det m 4 1 2 3 4 r r 1 33 4 37 and that m 2 21 22 23 r 2 r 1 2 1 23 2 r 2 2 r 2 23 4 38 we can combine the two equations above to find that 4 det m 2 r 2 r r 2 r 1 32 m 3 4 39 next we will observe that 2 r 2 r r 2 r 1 32 r 2 2 2 3 3 2 9 6 4 40 17 this is exactly as we want as r 2 is the case that we want to correspond to equality finally we observe that for all 1 2 r 2 we have that 2 r 2 r r 2 r 1 32 2 9 6 4 41 this completes the proof the structure of the quadratic term in relation to r 1 3 2 the extremal case will be investigated further in section 6 when we consider blow up for a toy model ode for the navier stokes strain equation it is an interesting open question whether or not there is a strain matrix which saturates this inequality globally in space more precisely is there an s l 2 st not identically zero such that 2 x 3 x almost everywhere x r 3 corollary 4 9 suppose s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation with f 0 then for all 0 t t t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 2 9 6 r 3 s 3 4 42 proof this corollary follows immediately from proposition 4 8 and corollary 4 6 this corollary allows us to derive an a priori estimate on the growth of enstrophy which will then give us a lower bound on tmax theorem 4 10 enstrophy growth differential inequality suppose s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation with f 0 then for all 0 t t t s t 22 1 1458 4 s t 62 4 43 s t 22 1 1 s 0 4 l 2 1 729 4 t 1 2 4 44 proof for the first portion 4 43 we begin by applying the interpolation inequality for lp to bound the l 3 norm by the l 2 and l 6 norms r 3 s 3 s 3 2 2 s 3 2 6 4 45 the sharp sobolev inequality 11 37 states that s l 6 1 3 3 4 2 2 3 s h 1 4 46 observing that 2 3 3 2 2 9 6 we can combine the above equations to find that t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 s 3 2 h 1 s 3 2 l 2 4 47 18 we will regroup terms and write this as 2 3 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 s 3 2 h 1 s 3 2 l 2 8 3 3 4 s 3 2 h 1 2 5 2 2 9 4 1 3 3 4 s 3 2 l 2 4 48 we now apply young s inequality using the conjugate exponents 4 3 and 4 to show that 8 3 3 4 s 3 2 h 1 2 5 2 2 9 4 1 3 3 2 s 3 2 l 2 3 4 8 3 3 4 s 3 2 h 1 4 3 1 4 2 1 4 1 3 3 2 s 3 2 l 2 4 4 49 therefore we can conclude that t s t 2 l 2 1 1458 4 s t 6 l 2 4 50 this completes the proof of the first part of the theorem 4 43 the second portion of the theorem follows immediately from integrating this differential inequality this is a significant improvement on the best known estimates for enstrophy growth if we take the enstrophy to be one half of the square of the l 2 norm of the vorticity e t 1 2 t 2 l 2 s t 2 l 2 then this means te t 1 1458 4 e t 3 4 51 the previous best known estimate for enstrophy growth 2 29 32 was te t 27 8 4 e t 3 4 52 this work has recently been extended in 2 which shows numerically that solutions which are sharp for this inequality locally in time actually tend to decay fairly quickly and so are not good candidates for blowup this work also suggested numerically that the constant 27 8 4 is non optimal but we will note that this work was on the torus which may result in a different constant than the whole space as for example the sharp sobolev constant may not be the same nonetheless the fairly drastic improvement in the constant is not too surprising because 27 8 4 was not expected to be sharp previous papers investigating the growth of enstrophy such as in 29 simply apply the sharp gagliardo nirenberg inequality to bound r 3 u u u a finer analysis of the role of the strain matrix using both the vorticity equation and the strain equation allows us to drastically improve this estimate by a factor of 4 920 75 this is a huge quantitative improvement on the estimate for enstrophy growth although the estimate is of course still cubic so an improvement in the constant only increases the minimum time until a solution might blow up it cannot rule out blowup in fact theorem 4 10 provides almost immediately as a corollary an estimate for the quickest possible blowup time in terms of the initial enstrophy first we must define tmax the maximal time of existence for a mild solution corresponding to some initial data s 0 l 2 st definition 4 11 maximal time of existence suppose s 0 l 2 st and f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 then the maximal time of existence for a smooth solution is tmax sup 0 t t s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 s 0 s 0 4 53 where s is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation with initial data s 0 and external force f 19 we will note here that tmax for a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation with initial data s 0 l 2 st is equivalent to tmax for a mild solution to the navier stokes equation corresponding to initial data u 0 2 div 1 s 0 h 1 we will also note that when f 0 tmax corresponds to a global smooth solution whereas tmax corresponds to a solution that develops singularities in finite time whether or not there exist smooth solutions to the navier stokes equation that develop singularities in finite time is one of the biggest open problems in partial differential equations and is one of the millennium problems put forward by the clay mathematics institute 14 definition 4 11 is directly related to this problem the millennium problem could be stated equivalently as show tmax for all s 0 l 2 st when f 0 or provide a counterexample we will now prove a lower bound on tmax based on the growth estimate in theorem 4 10 corollary 4 12 lower bound on time to blowup suppose s 0 l 2 st and f 0 then tmax 729 4 s 0 4 l 2 4 54 that is for all t 729 4 s 0 4 l 2 there exists a mild solution s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 to the navier stokes strain equation with initial data s 0 and this solution is smooth proof fix t 729 4 s 0 4 l 2 in theorem 4 4 we showed that mild solutions must exist locally in time for any initial data s 0 l 2 st from this it follows that unless s t l 2 becomes unbounded as t then a mild solution s c 0 l 2 st can be extended beyond to some it is clear from theorem 4 10 that s t l 2 remains bounded for all t t 729 4 s 0 4 l 2 so this establishes the existence of a mild solution s c 0 t l 2 st in particular this implies that s t l 2 must become unbounded as t tmax if tmax we already showed in theorem 4 4 that mild solutions are smooth when f 0 so this completes the proof note that this is similar to the estimate in the initial theorem establishing the local in time existence of mild solutions the only difference is that we have improved the constant the estimate on local existence in 22 does not actually state the value of the constant c 0 it is shown in 2 that tmax 4 4 27 s 0 4 l 2 4 55 although their statement is in terms of e 0 1 2 0 2 l 2 as their analysis does not focus on the strain the detailed analysis of the evolution of strain itself allows us to significantly sharpen the lower bounds on the minimal blowup time by a factor of 4 920 75 from previous estimates which were derived using standard harmonic analysis methods and did not take full advantage of the structures that incompressible flow imposes on the navier stokes problem for instance that the strain matrix must be trace free now that we have finished outlining the main estimates that can be derived from the navier stokes strain equation we will go on to use these estimates to prove a new regularity criterion in terms of the middle eigenvalue of the strain matrix we will then consider a toy model ode that captures some of the features of the quadratic term and tells us a little bit about the local structure of blow up solutions in particular what the distribution of eigenvalues will tend towards 20 5 regularity criteria for the eigenvalues of the strain in this section we will prove the main result of the paper theorem 1 1 as well as some immediate corollaries that were also stated in the introduction before we can prove that regularity criteria we will need to prove a lemma bounding the growth of enstrophy in terms of 2 lemma 5 1 middle eigenvalue determinant bound suppose s c 0 t l 2 st l 2 0 t h 1 r 3 is a mild solution to the navier stokes strain equation with external force f l 2 0 t l 2 r 3 and s x has eigenvalues 1 x 2 x 3 x define 2 x max 2 x 0 5 1 then det s 1 2 s 2 2 5 2 and for almost all 0 t t t s t 2 l 2 s 2 h 1 2 r 3 2 s 2 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 3 proof we will begin by noting that 1 0 and 3 0 so clearly 1 3 0 this implies that det s 1 3 2 5 4 1 3 2 5 5 next we can apply young s inequality to show that 1 3 1 2 21 2 3 5 6 1 2 21 2 2 2 3 5 7 1 2 s 2 5 8 we can combine these inequalities and conclude that det s 1 2 s 2 2 5 9 next we apply ho lder s inequality proposition 2 4 and young s inequality to conclude that u f u l 2 f l 2 5 10 2 s h 1 f l 2 5 11 s 2 h 1 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 12 recall from corollary 4 6 that t s 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 4 det s u f 5 13 and this completes the proof 21 with this bound we are now ready to prove the main result of the paper this is theorem 1 1 from the introduction which is restated here for the reader s convenience theorem 5 2 middle eigenvalue of strain characterizes the blow up time let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with force f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 t 0 f t 2 l 2 dt exp cq t 0 2 t p lq r 3 dt 5 14 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if the maximal existence time for a mild solution tmax t then tmax 0 2 t p lq r 3 dt 5 15 proof first we will note that u t 2 h 1 must become unbounded as t tmax if the mild solution cannot be extended beyond some time tmax t so it suffices to prove the bound 5 14 applying proposition 3 1 it is equivalent to show that s t 2 l 2 s 0 2 l 2 1 2 t 0 f t 2 l 2 dt exp cq t 0 2 t p lq r 3 dt 5 16 to begin we recall the conclusion in lemma 5 1 t s t 2 l 2 s 2 h 1 2 r 3 2 s 2 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 17 first we will consider the case q applying ho lder s inequality with exponents 1 and we see that t s t 2 l 2 2 2 l s 2 l 2 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 18 now we can apply gronwall s inequality and find that s t 2 l 2 s 0 2 l 2 1 2 t 0 f t 2 l 2 dt exp 2 t 0 2 l dt 5 19 now we will consider the case 3 2 q we will begin by applying ho lder s inequality to 5 3 taking 1 q 1 a 1 t s t 2 l 2 s 2 h 1 2 2 lq s 2 l 2 a 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 20 applying the sobolev inequality we find t s t 2 l 2 c s 2 l 6 2 2 lq s 2 l 2 a 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 21 noting that q 3 2 it follows that a 3 so 2 a 6 take 0 1 such that 1 2 a 1 2 1 1 6 then interpolating between l 2 and l 6 we find that t s t 2 l 2 c s 2 l 6 2 2 lq s 2 l 2 s 2 1 l 6 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 22 22 we know that 3 1 6 1 2 a so 3 2 a 1 2 1 a 1 1 q so 1 3 2 q therefore we conclude that t s t 2 l 2 c s 2 l 6 2 2 lq s 2 3 q l 2 s 3 q l 6 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 23 now take b 2 q 3 that means 1 b define p by 1 p 1 b 1 and apply young s inequality with exponents p and b and we find that t s t 2 l 2 c s 2 l 6 cq 2 lq s 2 3 q l 2 p c s b 3 q l 6 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 24 note that 1 p 1 1 b 1 3 2 q this means that p 2 3 q 2 and that 2 p 3 q 2 and we know by definition that b 3 q 2 so t s t 2 l 2 cq 2 p lq s 2 l 2 1 2 f 2 l 2 5 25 applying gronwall s inequality we find that s t 2 l 2 s 0 2 l 2 1 2 t 0 f 2 l 2 dt exp cq t 0 2 p lq r 3 dt 5 26 this completes the proof we will note here that the case p 1 q corresponds to the beale kato majda criterion so it may be possible to show that in this case the regularity criterion holds for the euler equations as well as the navier stokes equations note in particular that we did not use the dissipation to control the enstrophy so there is a natural path to extend the result to solutions of the euler equation as well there is more work to do however as bounded enstrophy is not sufficient to guarantee regularity for solutions to the euler equations there is also an open question at the other boundary case p q 3 2 this would likely be quite difficult as the methods used in 13 18 to extend the prodi serrin ladyzhenskaya regularity criterion to the boundary case p q 3 were much more technical than the methods in 26 31 35 in particular when p it is no longer adequate to rely on the relevant sobolev embeddings because we cannot apply gronwall s inequality nonetheless it is natural to suspect based on theorem 5 2 that if u is a smooth solution to the navier stokes equation with a maximal time of existence tmax then lim sup t tmax 2 t l 32 5 27 while we cannot prove this result we can prove the following weaker statement theorem 5 3 regularity criterion in the borderline case let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with force f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 if tmax t then lim sup t tmax 2 t l 32 1 c 2 s 5 28 where cs 1 3 2 2 3 is the constant in the sharp sobolev inequality that controls the embedding h 1 r 3 l 6 r 3 23 proof suppose toward contradiction that tmax t and lim sup t tmax 2 t l 32 1 c 2 s 5 29 then there must exist 0 such that for all tmax t tmax c 2 s 2 t l 32 1 5 30 recall from the proof of lemma 5 1 that t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 2 r 3 2 s 2 2 s h 1 f l 2 5 31 2 s 2 h 1 2 2 l 32 s 2 l 6 2 s h 1 f l 2 5 32 2 s 2 h 1 2 c 2 s 2 l 32 s 2 h 1 2 s h 1 f l 2 5 33 where we have applied ho lder s inequality and the sharp sobolev inequality next we recall that by hypothesis for all tmax t tmax c 2 s 2 l 32 1 5 34 using this fact and applying young s inequality we find t s t 2 l 2 2 s 2 h 1 2 s h 1 f l 2 5 35 1 4 f 2 l 2 5 36 integrating this differential inequality we find that lim sup t tmax s t 2 l 2 s tmax 2 l 2 1 4 tmax tmax f t 2 l 2 dt 5 37 which is a contradiction because tmax t implies that lim sup t tmax s t 2 l 2 5 38 this completes the proof note that the boundary case in our paper is q 3 2 not q 3 this is because the regularity criterion in 13 18 is on u whereas our regularity criterion is on an eigenvalue of the strain matrix which scales like u this is directly related to the sobolev embedding w 1 32 r 3 l 3 r 3 theorem 5 2 is one of few regularity criteria for the navier stokes equations involving a signed quantity which is not too surprising given that the navier stokes equation is a vector valued equation even the scalar regularity criteria based on only one component of u do not involve signed quantities 7 the only other regularity criterion for the navier stokes equation involving a signed quantity at least to the knowledge of the author is the regularity criterion proved by seregin and s vera k 33 that for a smooth solution to the navier stokes equation to blowup in finite time p must become unbounded below and p 1 2 u 2 must become unbounded above we will also make a remark about the relationship between this result and the regularity criterion on one component of the gradient tensor uj xi in 4 a natural question to ask in light of this regularity criterion is whether it is possible to prove a regularity criterion on just one entry of the strain tensor sij this paper does not answer this question however we do prove a regularity criterion on just one diagonal entry of the diagonalization of the strain tensor 24 corollary 5 4 any eigenvalue of strain characterizes the blow up time let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with force f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 t 0 f t 2 l 2 dt exp cq t 0 i t plq r 3 dt 5 39 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if tmax t then tmax 0 i t plq r 3 dt 5 40 proof 1 2 3 and 1 2 3 0 implies that 1 3 2 2 therefore t 0 2 t p lq dt t 0 i t plqdt 5 41 applying this inequality to both conclusions in theorem 5 2 this completes the proof we will also note that there is a gap to be closed in the regularity criterion on uj xi because it is not the optimal result with respect to scaling and requires subcritical control on uj xi that is the result only holds for 2 p 3 q q 3 2 q 2 for i 6 j and 2 p 3 q 3 q 6 4 q 2 for i j whereas the regularity criterion on one of the eigenvalues in corollary 5 4 is critical with respect to the scaling it is natural however to ask whether the main theorem in this paper can be extended to the critical besov spaces so in that sense the result may be pushed further corollary 5 4 is only really a new result however for 2 this is because 1 and 3 both control s as we will see from the following proposition the regularity criteria in terms of 1 or 3 follow immediately from the prodi serrin ladyzhenskaya regularity criterion without needing to use strain evolution equation at all so in this case corollary 5 3 is just an unstated corollary of previous results proposition 5 5 lower bounds on the magnitude of the extermal eigenvalues suppose m s 3 3 is a symmetric trace free matrix with eigenvalues 1 2 3 then 3 1 6 s 5 42 with equality if and only if 1 2 1 2 3 and 1 1 6 s 5 43 with equality if and only if 1 2 12 3 furthermore for all s l 2 st and for all 1 q s lq 6 1 lq 5 44 and s lq 6 3 lq 5 45 25 proof we will prove the statement for 3 the proof of the statement for 1 is entirely analogous and is left to the reader first observe that if 1 2 1 2 3 then s 2 21 22 23 6 23 5 46 so we have proven that if 2 3 then 3 1 6 s now suppose 2 3 recall that tr m 1 2 3 0 5 47 so 1 2 3 5 48 therefore we find that s 2 21 22 23 5 49 2 3 2 22 23 5 50 2 22 2 2 3 2 2 3 5 51 3 22 3 3 5 52 6 23 5 53 where we have applied young s inequality and used the fact that 2 3 noting that 3 0 this completes the proof we leave the analogous proof for 1 to the reader the l q bounds follow immediately from integrating these bounds pointwise when one recalls that tr s 0 we will note here that the lq norms may be infinite as by hypothesis we only have s l 2 but by convention the inequality is satisfied if both norms are infinite in particular this implies that regularity criteria involving 1 or 3 follow immediately from regularity criteria involving s so while the regularity criteria on 1 and 3 in corollary 5 4 do not appear in the literature to the knowledge of the author these criteria do not offer a real advance over the prodi serrin ladyzhenskaya criterion 26 31 35 as the critical norm on u can be controlled by the critical norm on s using sobolev embedding which can in turn be bounded by the critical norm on 1 or 3 using proposition 5 that is u lq c s lq 6 c 3 lq 5 54 it is the regularity criterion in terms of 2 that is really significant because it encodes geometric information about the strain beyond just its size we will also note that none of the regularity criteria involving uj 40 xiu 25 or xiuj 4 have been proven for the navier stokes equation with an external force however the regularity criterion in theorem 5 2 is also valid for navier stokes equation with an external force it may only be an exercise to extend the results cited above to the case with an external force but because these papaers do not establish their regularity criteria by applying gro nwall type estimates to the enstrophy it is not immediately clear that this is is the case lemma 5 6 the middle eigenvector is minimal suppose s l 2 st and v l r 3 r 3 with v x 1 almost everywhere x r 3 then 2 x s x v x 5 55 almost everywhere x r 3 26 proof by the spectral theorem we know that there is an orthonormal eigenbasis for rn in particu lar take v 1 x v 2 x v 3 x to be eigenvectors of s x corresponding to eigenvalues 1 x 2 x 3 x such that v 1 x v 2 x v 3 x 1 almost everywhere x r 3 then from the spectral theorem we know that v 1 x v 2 x v 3 x is an orthonormal basis for r 3 almost everywhere x r 3 therefore sv 1 v v 1 v 1 2 v v 2 v 2 3 v v 3 v 3 5 56 therefore we can see that sv 2 21 v v 1 2 22 v v 2 2 23 v v 3 2 5 57 we know that 2 1 3 so sv 2 22 v v 1 2 v v 2 2 v v 3 2 5 58 because v 1 x v 2 x v 3 x is an orthonormal basis for r 3 almost everywhere x r 3 we conclude that v v 1 2 v v 2 2 v v 3 2 v 2 1 5 59 therefore sv 2 22 5 60 this concludes the proof now that we have proven lemma 5 6 we will prove a new regularity criterion for the strain tensor this regularity criterion is theorem 1 3 in the introduction and is restated here for the reader s convenience theorem 5 7 blowup requires the strain to blow up in every direction let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with force f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 and let v l r 3 0 tmax r 3 with v x t 1 almost every where if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 t 0 f t 2 l 2 dt exp cq t 0 s t v t p lq r 3 dt 5 61 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if the maximal existence time for a mild solution tmax t then tmax 0 s t v t p lq r 3 dt 5 62 proof this follows immediately from lemma 5 6 and theorem 5 2 we can use theorem 5 7 to prove a new one direction type regularity criterion involving the sum of the derivative of the whole velocity in one direction and the gradient of the component in the same direction in fact theorem 5 7 allows us to prove a one direction regularity criterion that involves different directions in different regions of r 3 first off for any unit vector v r 3 v 1 we define v v and uv u v we will now prove theorem 1 2 which is restated here for the reader s convenience 27 corollary 5 8 local one direction regularity criterion let vn t n n r 3 with vn t 1 let n t n n r 3 be lebesgue measurable sets such that for all m 6 n m t n t and r 3 n n n t let u c 0 t h 1 r 3 l 2 0 t h 2 r 3 for all t tmax be a mild solution to the navier stokes equation with force f l 2 loc 0 t l 2 r 3 if 2 p 3 q 2 with 3 2 q then u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 t 0 f t 2 l 2 dt exp cq t 0 n 1 vnu t uvn t q lq n t p q dt 5 63 with the constant cq depending only on q in particular if the maximal existence time for a mild solution tmax t then tmax 0 n 1 vnu t uvn t q lq n t p q dt 5 64 in particular if we take vn t 0 0 1 for all n n then 5 64 reduces to tmax 0 3 u t u 3 t plqdt 5 65 proof let v x t n 1 vn t i n t x where i is the indicator function i x 1 for all x and i x 0 otherwise note that in this case we clearly have s x t v x t n 1 i n t x s x t vn t 5 66 because n n n are disjoint we have s t v t q lq r 3 n 1 s t vn t qlq n t 5 67 therefore we find that s t v t p lq r 3 n 1 s t vn t qlq n t p q 5 68 finally observe that s x t vn t 1 2 vnu x t 1 2 uvn x t 5 69 so s t v t p lq r 3 n 1 1 2 vnu t 1 2 uvn t q lq n t p q 5 70 applying theorem 5 7 this completes the proof 28 corollary 5 8 significantly extends the range of exponents for which we have a critical regularity criterion involving one direction for instance kukavica and ziane 25 showed that if tmax and if 2 p 3 q 2 with 9 4 q 3 then tmax 0 3 u t plq r 3 dt 5 71 more recently it was shown by chemin zhang and zhang 8 9 that if tmax and 4 p then tmax 0 u 3 t p h 1 2 2 p 5 72 in the case where there is no external force f 0 these results imply the special case of corollary 5 8 that if tmax then tmax 0 3 u t u 3 t plq 5 73 in the range of exponents 9 4 q 3 and 3 2 q 6 respectively this follows from the helmholtz decomposition as we will now show proposition 5 9 helmholtz decomposition suppose 1 q for all v lq r 3 r 3 there exists a unique u lq r 3 r 3 u 0 and f lq r 3 r 3 such that v u f note because we do not have any assumptions of higher regularity we will say that u 0 if for all c c r 3 r 3 u 0 5 74 and we will say that f is a gradient if for all w c c r 3 r 3 w 0 we have r 3 f w 0 5 75 furthermore there exists bq 1 depending only on q such that u lq bq v lq 5 76 and f lq bq v lq 5 77 proof this is a well known classical result for details see for instance 27 we will also note here that the lq bounds here are equivalent to the lq boundedness of the riesz transform take the riesz transform to be given by r 12 then pdf v r r v and pg v r r v based on proposition 5 9 we will now define the projections onto the space of gradients and the space of divergence free vector fields definition 5 10 fix 1 q define pdf lq r 3 r 3 lq r 3 r 3 and pg lq r 3 r 3 lq r 3 r 3 by pdf v u and pg v f where v u and f are taken as above in proposition 5 9 29 now we observe that these projections allow us to control 3 u lq and u 3 h 1 2 p 2 by 3 u u 3 lq in particular we find 3 u lq pdf 3 u u 3 lq bq 3 u u 3 lq 5 78 applying the the sobolev embedding h 1 2 p 2 r 3 w 1 q r 3 when 2 p 3 q 2 and the lq bound edness of pg we can also see that u 3 h 1 2 2 p d u 3 lq dbq 3 u u 3 lq 5 79 this means that the regularity criterion requiring 3 u u 3 lptl q x is not new in the range 3 2 q 6 it does however extend the range of exponents for which a scale critical one direction type regularity criterion is known to 6 q more importantly corollary 5 7 and corollary 5 8 do not require regularity in a fixed direction but allow this direction to vary one interpretation of component reduction results for navier stokes regularity criteria is that if the solution is approximately two dimensional then it must be smooth the only reason that we have component reduction regularity criteria for the 3 d navier stokes equation is because the 2 d navier stokes equation has smooth solutions globally in time all of the previous component reduction regularity criteria involve some fixed direction and so can be interpreted as saying if a solution is globally approximately two dimensional then it must be smooth corollary 5 7 and corollary 5 8 strengthen these statements to the requirement that the solution must be regular even if it is only locally two dimensional this shows the deep geometric significance of the theorem 5 2 that 2 controls the growth of enstrophy 6 blowup for a toy model ode now that we have outlined the main advances in terms of regularity criteria that are made possible by utilizing strain equation we will consider a toy model ode the main advantage of the strain equation formulation of the navier stokes equation compared with the vorticity formulation is that the quadratic term s 2 1 4 w w has a much nicer structure then the quadratic term s in the vorticity formulation the price we pay for this is that there are additional terms particularly hess p which are not present in the vorticity formulation there is also the related difficulty that the consistency condition in the strain formulation is significantly more complicated than in the vorticity formulation we will now examine a toy model ode prove the existence and stability of blowup and examine asymptotic behavior near blowup the simplest toy model equation would be to keep only the local part of the quadratic term vorticity depends non locally on s and to study the ode tm m 2 0 as long as the initial condition m 0 is an invertible matrix this has the solution m t 1 m 0 1 ti 3 this equation will blow up in finite time assuming that m 0 has at least one negative eigenvalue blowup is unstable in general because any small perturbation into the complex plane will mean there will not be blowup however if we restrict to symmetric matrices then blowup is stable because then the eigenvalues must be real valued so a small perturbation will remain on the negative real axis the negative real axis is an open set of r but not of c so blowup is stable only when we are restricted to matrices with real eigenvalues which is the case we are concerned with as the strain tensor is symmetric this equation does not preserve the family of trace free matrices however because tr m 2 m 2 6 0 and therefore doesn t really 30 capture any of the features of the strain equation 1 11 we will instead take our toy model ode on the space of symmetric trace free matrices to be tm m 2 1 3 m 2 i 3 0 6 1 because every symmetric matrix is diagonalizable over r and every diagonalizable matrix is mutually diagonalizable with the identity matrix this equation can be treated as a system of odes for the evolution of the eigenvalues 1 2 3 with for every 1 i 3 t i 2 i 1 3 21 2 2 3 3 6 2 this equation has two families of solutions with a type of scaling invariance let s 0 cdiag 2 1 1 with c 0 then s t f t diag 2 1 1 where ft f 2 f 0 c therefore we have blowup in finite time with s t 11 c tdiag 2 1 1 the reverse case one positive eigenvalue and two equal negative eigenvalues also preserves scaling but decays to zero as t let s 0 cdiag 1 1 2 with c 0 then s t 11 c t diag 1 1 2 we will show that the blow up solution is stable while the decay solution is unstable further more the blow up solution is asymptotically a global attractor except for the unstable family of solutions that decay to zero i e two equal negative eigenvalues and the zero solution to prove this we will begin by rewriting our system first of all we will assume without loss of generality that s 6 0 because clearly if s 0 0 then s t 0 is the solution if s 6 0 then clearly 1 0 and 3 0 our system of equations really only has two degrees of freedom because of the condition tr s 1 2 3 0 but because we are interested in the ratios of the eigenvalues asymptotically we will reduce the system to the two parameters 3 and r 1 3 these two parameters completely determine our system because 1 r 3 and 2 1 3 r 1 3 we now will rewrite our system of odes t 3 1 3 21 2 2 2 23 6 3 1 3 2 3 r 2 r 1 2 2 6 4 1 3 2 3 2 r 2 2 r 1 6 5 and tr 1 t 3 3 t 1 23 6 6 3 r 1 3 2 3 r 2 3 r 2 2 3 2 3 r 1 3 r 2 6 7 1 3 3 2 r 3 3 r 2 3 r 2 6 8 at this point it will be useful to remark on the range of values our two variables can take clearly the largest eigenvalue 3 0 and 3 0 if and only if 1 2 3 0 now we turn to the range of values for r recall that 2 r 1 3 and that 1 2 3 therefore r r 1 1 so 1 2 r 2 if we take f r 2 r 3 3 r 2 3 r 2 we find that f r is positive for 1 2 r 2 with f 1 2 f 2 0 this is the basis for the blowup solution being the asymptotic attractor we are now ready to state our theorem on the existence and asymptotic behaviour of finite time blow up solutions 31 theorem 6 1 toy model dynamics suppose 3 0 0 and r 0 1 2 then there exists t 0 such that limt t 3 t and furthermore limt t r t 2 proof we ll start by showing that finite time blow up exists and then we will show that r goes to 2 as we approach the blow up time first we observe that g r 2 r 2 2 r 1 has a zero at 1 3 2 g r 0 for 1 2 r 1 3 2 and g is both positive and increasing on 1 3 2 r 2 we will begin with the case where r 0 r 0 1 3 2 clearly tr 0 so r t r 0 and g r t g r 0 let c 1 3 g r 0 then we find that t 3 1 3 g r t 23 c 23 6 9 from this differential inequality we find that 3 t 1 1 3 0 ct 6 10 so clearly there exists a time t 1 c 3 0 such that limt t 3 t now we consider the case where 1 2 r 0 1 3 2 it suffices to show that there exists a ta 0 such that r ta 1 3 2 then the proof above applies note that g is increasing on the interval 1 2 2 so g r t g r 0 let b 13 g r 0 0 and let c 1 3 min f r 0 f 1 3 2 suppose towards contradiction that for all t 0 r t 1 3 2 then we will have the differential inequalities tr c 3 6 11 t 3 b 23 6 12 from 6 12 it follows that 3 t 1 1 3 0 bt 6 13 plugging 6 13 into 6 11 we find that r t r 0 c t 0 1 1 3 0 b d r 0 c b log 1 b 3 0 t 6 14 however this estimate 6 14 clearly contradicts our hypothesis that r t 1 3 2 for all t 0 therefore we can conclude that there exists ta 0 such that r ta 1 3 2 and then we have reduced the problem to the case that we have already proven now we will show that limt t r t 2 suppose toward contradiction that limt t r t r 1 2 first take a t 1 3 f r t observe that a t 0 for 0 t t our differential equation is now given by t 3 a t 2 3 which must satisfy 1 3 t 1 1 3 t 2 t 2 t 1 a d 6 15 if we take t 2 t the blow up time then 6 15 reduces to 1 3 t t t a d 6 16 32 let a t t t a d clearly a t 0 a t a t 0 by the fundamental theorem of calculus for all m a t there exists 0 such that for all t t t t a t m t t m t t 6 17 using the definition of a and plugging in to 6 16 we find that for all t t t 3 t 1 m t t 6 18 let b 1 3 min f r 0 f r 1 it then follows from our hypothesis that tr b 3 6 19 therefore we can apply the estimate 6 18 to the differential inequality 6 19 to find that for all t t t r t r t b t t 1 m t d r t b m log t t 6 20 however it is clear from 6 20 that limt t r t contradicting our hypothesis that limt t r t 2 so we can conclude that limt t r t 2 this toy model ode shows that the local part of the quadratic nonlinearity tends to drive the intermediate eigenvalue 2 upward to 3 unless 1 2 given the nature of the regularity criterion on 2 the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the strain matrix are extremely important the fact that the toy model ode blows up from all initial conditions where 1 2 and that 2 3 is a global attractor on all initial conditions where 1 2 provides a mechanism for blowup but of course the very complicated nonlocal effects make it impossible to say anything definitive about blowup for the full navier stokes strain equation without a much more detailed analysis 33 references 1 dallas albritton blow up
