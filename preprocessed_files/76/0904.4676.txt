abs 0904 4676 v 2 2 y charles li and zhiwu lin 1 introduction the most influential paradox in fluids is the d alembert paradox saying that a body moving through water has no drag as calculated by d alembert 7 via inviscid theory while experiments show that there is a substantial drag on the body the paradox splitted the field of fluids into two branches 1 hydraulics observing phenomena without mathematical explanation 2 theoretical fluid mechanics mathematically predicting phenomena that could not be observed a revolutionary development of the boundary layer theory by ludwig prandtl in 1904 resolved the paradox by paying attention to the substantial effect of small viscosity in the boundary layer prandtl s boundary layer theory laid the foundation of modern unified fluid mechanics sommerfeld paradox has the potential of being the next most influential para dox in fluids the paradox says that the linear shear in couette flow is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers as first calculated by sommerfeld 51 but exper iments show that any small perturbation size to the linear shear can lead to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence when the reynolds number is large enough this paradox is the key for understanding turbulence inside the infinite dimensional phase space dynamical system studies on the navier stokes flow in an infinite dimensional phase space is still at its developing stage in this article we shall conduct such a study to offer a resolution to the sommerfeld paradox linear hydrodynamic stability is a classical subject for a modern version with dynamical system flavor see 46 couette flow between two parallel horizontal plates is the simplest of all clas sical fluid flows with boundary layers it is one of the most fundamental flows for understanding the transition to turbulence another basic flow is pipe poiseuille flow which is also linearly stable for any reynolds number as shown by numerical computations but reynolds s famous experiment in 1883 showed the transition to turbulence for large reynolds number indeed there are lots of similar features in the study of transient turbulence of plane couette flow and pipe poiseuille flow 22 we expect that some of our studies for couette flow in this paper could be useful for understanding the turbulence of pipe poiseuille flow the linear stability of couette flow was first studied by sommerfeld in 1908 51 using a single fourier mode analysis to the linearized navier stokes equa tions sommerfeld found that all eigenvalues are non positive for all values of the reynolds number indicating the absence of exponentially growing eigen modes and concluded that the linear shear is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers this fact was rigorously proved by romanov 45 who showed that all the eigen values are less than c r where r is the reynolds number and c is a positive constant furthermore the linear shear is nonlinearly asymptotically stable in l 2 norm of vorticity on the other hand experimentally no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is a transition to turbulence always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough now we briefly comment on some previous attempts to explain sommerfeld paradox one popular resolution which was first suggested by orr 40 see also 53 is to use the non normality of the linearized navier stokes operator to get algebraic growth of perturbations before their final decay note non normality refers to operators with non orthogonal eigenfunctions however it is not clear how such linear algebraic growth relates to the nonlinear dynamics see 57 moreover sommerfeld paradox 3 the non normality theory cannot explain many coherent structures observed in the transient turbulence we believe that norms play a fundamental role in resolving the paradox per turbations with large l 2 norm of vorticity may still have small l 2 norm of velocity i e small energy in experimental or numerical studies such perturbations of small energy are still considered to be small but they are outside the vorticity s l 2 neighborhood of the linear shear where romanov s nonlinear stability result is valid 45 therefore such perturbations have the potential of being linearly unstable and initiating the transition to turbulence the main idea of our resolution is to show the existence of a sequence of linearly unstable shears which approach the linear shear in the velocity variable but not in the vorticity variable these shears are the single modes of the fourier series of all the 2 d shears of the couette flow y m 1 cm sin my more precisely our sequence of oscillatory shears has the form 1 1 un y y a n sin 4 n y 1 2 1 4 a 1 4 as n the oscillatory shears approach the linear shear i e un y y in l 2 and l on the other hand in the vorticity variable the oscillatory shears do not approach the linear shear since yun y 1 4 a cos 4 n y 6 1 in any lebesgue norm thus in the velocity variable the oscillatory shears can be viewed as the linear shear plus small noises for any large n we prove that un y is linearly un stable for both inviscid and slightly viscous fluids more precisely in theorems 3 2 and 4 1 it is shown that these shears are linearly exponentially unstable for both euler equations and navier stokes equations with large reynolds numbers under the navier stokes dynamics our shears are not steady rather drifting slowly by viewing them as frozen we investigate the spectra of the corresponding linearized navier stokes operator orr sommerfeld operator moreover numerical simula tions 24 indicate that its unstable growth rate does not depend on n substantially implying that as n its unstable growth rate does not shrink to zero rather approach a positive number such a linear instability will generate the transition to turbulence no matter how small the initial perturbation added to the linear shear is as long as the reynolds number is large enough to realize the linear instability numerical simulations 24 indicates that initial perturbations to un y indeed lead to a transient nonlinear growth in fact our new theory proposed in 24 claims that such a transient nonlinear growth induced by slowly drifting states is the only mechanism for transition from the linear shear to turbulence based upon comments from our colleagues it is important to clarify a few points here 1 a more precise formulation of the sommerfeld paradox is one one hand the linear shear is linearly stable on the other hand experiments indicate that for any 0 there is a 0 such that when the reynolds number is larger than 1 there is a perturbation of size that leads to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence due to various difficulties and lack of a precise mathematical direction experiments in the past were often less conclusive and confusing but recent experiments gradually converge to the conclusion of the precise mathematical statement above 4 y charles li and zhiwu lin 2 it is fundamental to notice that our sequence of oscillatory shears 1 1 is uniformly unstable for all positive integers n i e for any n 1 2 un is linearly unstable 3 under the navier stokes dynamics our sequence of oscillatory shears drifts as follows 1 2 un t y y e 4 n 2 ta n sin 4 n y in terms of the above sommerfeld paradox for any we can find a n such that a n then there is a such that when the reynolds number is larger than 1 i e the orr sommerfeld linear navier stokes operator has an unstable eigenvalue at such a un 1 1 now we inspect the drifting 1 2 for such un n a the dual effect of n and above can prevent the drifting exponent 4 n 2 to be too large therefore prevent the oscillatory component of un to be quickly dissipated in fact when the reynolds number is larger enough i e is small enough the drifting exponent 4 n 2 is very small there fore the drifting and the dissipation the oscillatory component are very slow the linear instability of un then has plenty of time to be amplified leading to the observations in the experiments and the resolution of the sommerfeld paradox finally even when n 1 the amplitude of the oscillatory component of un is already very small 0 04 a 0 08 in theorem 5 1 we prove the bifurcation to nontrivial travelling solutions to 2 d euler equation near the oscillatory shear un y in the energy norm the stream lines of these travelling waves have the structure of kelvin s cat s eyes this study has been recently extended in 35 to show that vorticity h 3 2 is the critical reg ularity for nontrivial euler traveling waves to exist near couette flow see remark 5 3 in theorem 6 1 we also show that 3 d shears u y z 0 0 in a neighborhood w 1 p p 2 in the velocity variable of any linearly unstable 2 d shear including our un y are linearly unstable too this shows that the instability found near couette flow in theorem 3 2 is also robust in the 3 d setting in recent years there has been a renaissance in numerical dynamical system studies on fluids the focus was upon three classical flows plane couette flow plane poiseuille flow and pipe poiseuille flow basic flows of them are the linear shear for plane couette flow and the parabolic shear for both plane and pipe poiseuille flows original studies on transition to turbulence for these flows were conducted by the orszag group 41 42 primitive steak roll wave coherent structures were discovered the orszag group also emphasized the importance of the slowly drifting states like our un y in 1990 nagata made a breakthrough by discovering 3 d steady states fixed points in plane couette flow 39 there are two branches of 3 d steady states called upper and lower branches the same 3 d steady states also appeared in plane poiseuille flow 58 most recently the same 3 d steady states were also discovered in pipe poiseuille flow and they become traveling waves with constant speeds in the laboratory 9 22 the pipe discovery made laboratory experiment easy to implement indeed hof et al observed such traveling waves in experiments 19 a steady state fixed point study is generally the starting sommerfeld paradox 5 point of a full dynamical system study which is still in progress 21 13 14 55 49 47 the most intriguing new discovery on the steady states is that the lower branch steady states of the three classical flows share some universal feature i e they all approach 3 d shears as the reynolds number approaches infinity 59 56 58 such 3 d shears u y z 0 0 are neutrally stable under the linearized euler dynamics so they are not our 3 d shears in the neighborhood of our un y on the other hand any 3 d shear u y z 0 0 is a steady state of the 3 d euler equations so it is interesting to understand the special features of the limiting 3 d shear of the lower branch a necessary condition on such a limiting 3 d shear was also discovered 29 in numerical and experimental studies on transition to turbulence one often observes the steak roll wave structure the streak and roll are the 0 th fourier mode while the wave is the higher fourier mode in the fourier series of the velocity field when plotting these modes separately the steak roll wave structure should generically be observed taking into account the linear instability of our 3 d shears in a neighborhood of our un y such steak roll wave structures will be generated too the 3 d steady state argument on the sommerfeld paradox claims that the stable manifolds of the 3 d steady states may get very close they cannot be con nected to the linear shear in the infinite dimensional phase space which leads to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence 13 the main criticism of this argument is that these 3 d steady states are not close to the linear shear in the phase space even in the kinetic energy norm while experiments show that no matter how small the initial perturbation to the linear shear is a transition always occurs when the reynolds number is large enough we believe that the linear instability of our un y and 3 d shears in its neighborhood offers a better explanation for the ini tiation of transition from the linear shear to turbulence in other words the key point for answering the sommerfeld paradox is whether or not there is a linear in stability happening arbitrarily close to the linear shear our un y and 3 d shears in its neighborhood does the job again they approach the linear shear in the velocity variable but not the vorticity variable in consistency with romanov s non linear stability theorem 45 on the other hand stable manifolds of the 3 d steady states can often only be established in higher sobolev spaces in which romanov s nonlinear stability theorem prohibits them to get close to the linear shear explorations on two dimensional viscous steady states turn out to be not suc cessful so far 5 10 that is the counterpart of the 3 d upper or lower branch steady state has not been found in 2 d a formal analysis in 28 confirms the non existence of a viscous steady state in 2 d on the other hand numerics shows that transitions still occur from the linear shear to turbulence in 2 d this further con firms that the stable manifolds of the 3 d steady states are not the initiators for the transition under the 2 d euler dynamics theorem 5 1 shows the existence of 2 d inviscid steady states with cat s eye structures the neighborhood of these eye structures might be a good place for a future numerical search of 2 d viscous steady states a rigorous proof on the existence of 3 d steady states in the three classical flows remains open the main difficulty is the lack of a proper bifurcation point there is no hope directly from the linear shear end since it is linearly stable from the infinite reynolds number limiting shear of the lower branch it is promising and challenging since we do not know much of its property except a necessary condition 6 y charles li and zhiwu lin 29 however with the discovery of more and more 3 d n s steady states travelling waves numerically besides the upper and lower branches 15 it is unclear if any of these 3 d steady states are fundamentally important to the development of transient turbulence in theorem 5 1 we show that nontrivial 2 d steady states bifurcate from the unstable shears un y 0 under the 2 d euler dynamics since un y is arbitrarily close to the linear shear in the velocity variable so we get inviscid steady states near the linear shear these inviscid steady states could provide a natural starting point for constructing steady states of navier stokes equation with large reynolds number this is a problem of bifurcation from infinity or asymptotic bifurcation theory as suggested by yudovich 61 of course to get n s travelling waves from euler travelling waves the key and difficult issue is to understand the boundary layers proving the existence of chaos turbulence for couette flow is a far more difficult problem than resolving the sommerfeld paradox the boundary layer effect adds tremendously to the difficulty the kolmogorov flow periodic boundary condition in every spatial dimension is a much easier mathematical problem in this aspect the boundary layer is not present some progress on the dynamical system studies on the kolmogorov flow has been made 37 3 4 27 49 25 so far proving the existence of chaos in partial differential equations is only successful for simpler systems for a survey see 26 the article is organized as follows in section 2 we will discuss some possible phase spaces in which dynamical system studies can be conducted on the couette flow in section 3 we prove the inviscid linear instability of our sequence of os cillatory shears un y in section 4 we prove the viscous linear instability of our sequence of oscillatory shears un y when viewed frozen in section 5 we prove a bifurcation of our oscillatory shears un y to kelvin s cat s eyes under the 2 d euler dynamics in section 6 we prove the inviscid linear instability of 3 d shears u y z in a neighborhood of our oscillatory shears un y 2 mathematical formulation we are interested in fluid flows between two infinite horizontal planes figure 1 where the upper plane moves with unit velocity and the lower plate is fixed the dynamics of such a fluid flow is governed by the navier stokes ns equations 2 1 ut u u p u u 0 defined in the spatial domain d r 0 1 r where u u 1 u 2 u 3 is the velocity p is the pressure and is the inverse of the reynolds number 1 r the following boundary condition identifies the specific flow u 1 t x 0 z 0 u 1 t x 1 z 1 ui t x 0 z ui t x 1 z 0 i 2 3 2 2 the linear shear is given by 2 3 u 1 y u 2 u 3 0 one can choose the infinite dimensional phase space to be s u u hsloc d s 3 u 0 together with 2 2 sommerfeld paradox 7 figure 1 couette flow where hsloc is a local sobolev space this phase space s is too large and too difficult to analyze one can first study its invariant subspace by posing extra periodic boundary condition along x and z directions with periods l 1 and l 3 denote by d the partially periodic domain d 0 l 1 0 1 0 l 3 the partially periodic invariant subspace is given by 2 4 s u u hs d s 3 u 0 together with 2 2 often we are interested in the two dimensional reduction u 3 3 0 in which case the phase space s is simplified further moreover in the two dimensional case the flow is nicer since both 2 d ns and 2 d euler equations are globally well posed remark 2 1 by the change of variables u 1 y v 1 u 2 v 2 u 3 v 3 the new variable v v 1 v 2 v 3 satisfies the dirichlet boundary condition at y 0 1 thus v n 1 vn x z sinn y and vn x z is periodic in x and z by this representation we see that the phase space s is a banach manifold in fact the navier stokes equations 2 1 can be re written in terms of the v variable as 2 5 vt v v p v f v 0 where f y x v v 2 1 0 0 in terms of v the phase spaces will be banach spaces in our exploration inside the phase space we will focus not only on the neigh borhood of the linear shear 2 3 but also on the neighborhood of the following sequence of oscillatory shears 2 6 u 1 un y y a n sin 4 n y 1 2 1 4 a 1 4 u 2 u 3 0 which will be proved later to be linearly unstable under the 2 d euler flow all the 2 d shears together form an invariant submanifold 2 7 u s u 1 u y u 2 u 3 0 u 0 0 u 1 1 where u y is an arbitrary function inside the invariant submanifold the dy namics is governed by tu 2 yu 8 y charles li and zhiwu lin the fixed point of this equation is given by 2 yu 0 i e u c 1 y c 2 the boundary conditions u 0 0 and u 1 1 imply that u y which is the linear shear 2 3 that is when 6 0 the linear shear is the only fixed point inside of course when 0 euler flow is an equilibrium manifold let u y v then tv 2 yv v 0 v 1 0 thus v n 1 ane n 2 t sinn y where an s are constants finally the orbits inside is given by u y n 1 ane n 2 t sinn y 3 inviscid linear instability of the sequence of oscillatory shears let u y 0 be a steady shear of the 2 d navier stokes or euler equation e g u y y introducing the stream function u 1 y u 2 x and linearizing at the steady shear in the form y ei x t y ei x ct i c one obtains the so called orr sommerfeld equation 3 1 i 2 y 2 2 u u c 2 y 2 0 with the boundary conditions 3 2 0 at y 0 1 for euler equation 0 and 3 1 is reduced to the rayleigh equation 3 3 u u c 2 y 2 0 with the boundary conditions 3 4 0 at y 0 1 we call c with 0 c c an eigenmode of orr sommerfeld or rayleigh equa tions if for such c the equation 3 1 or 3 3 is solvable and the corresponding solution is called an eigenfunction the eigenmode with im c 0 is called unstable with im c 0 is called neutral as shown in last section all the shears u y 0 are steady under the 2 d euler dynamics while only the linear shear u y y is steady under the 2 d navier stokes dynamics nevertheless when the reynolds number r is large is small the shears u y 0 only drift slowly when they sommerfeld paradox 9 are viewed frozen or artificial forces make them steady the spectra of the corre sponding orr sommerfeld operator are still significant in predicting their transient instabilities first indicated by sommerfeld 51 the linear shear u y y is linearly stable for all reynolds number this fact was rigorously proved by romanov 45 who showed that the eigenvalues of the linearized navier stokes operator satisfies re c r and moreover the linear shear is nonlinearly stable for all reynolds number in w 1 2 0 1 r 2 when 0 for the linear shear the rayleigh equation reduces to u c 0 where 2 y 2 which has only continuous spectrum 11 c minu y maxu y 0 1 and the corresponding quasi eigenfunction for c u y 0 is given by y y 0 in the variable 2 y 2 y y 0 that is is the green function in fact the linear shear is also nonlinearly stable under the 2 d euler flow in the vorticity form the 2 d euler equation is given by t u 0 u 0 which has the invariants f dxdy for any f near the linear shear 1 and satisfies t u 0 u 0 where u is the velocity corresponding to then f dxdy are also invariant for any f thus the linear shear is nonlinearly stable in lp norm of vorticity for any p 1 when 0 each point in is a fixed point the linear spectrum of these shear flows has been studied a lot since lord rayleigh in 1880 s 44 if the profile of the shear does not contain any inflection point then by rayleigh s criterion there is no unstable eigenvalue and the spectrum consists of only continuous spectrum given by the imaginary axis however the existence of an inflection point is only necessary for linear instability and the results on sufficient conditions for instability remain very limited 8 31 to construct unstable shears near the linear shear we use the following instability criterion for monotone shear flows lemma 3 1 consider a monotone shear profile u y c 2 0 1 with inflection points let y 0 yl be all the inflection points and u i u yi l i 0 be the in flection values define 3 5 qi y u y u y u i 10 y charles li and zhiwu lin and the sturm liouville operator 3 6 li qi y with the dirichlet boundary condition 0 1 0 i if for some 0 i l the operator li has a negative eigenvalue then the rayleigh equation 3 3 has unstable eigenmodes for some intervals of wave numbers any end point s of the unstable intervals is such that 2 s being a negative eigenvalue of some operator li ii if li 0 for all 0 i l then the shear profile u y is linearly stable for any wave number lemma 3 1 was rigorously proved in 33 the following key observation is due to tollmien 54 in 1930 see also 11 and 30 if 2 s is a negative eigenvalue of li and s is the eigenfunction then c u i s is a neutral eigenmode to the rayleigh equation 3 3 with s being the eigenfunction then one can try to find unstable modes c im c 0 to 3 3 near such neutral mode a variational formula for c can be derived at the neutral mode notice that any point in has the representation 3 7 u y y n 1 an sinn y so the sequence of oscillatory shears 1 1 can be viewed as single modes of the above expansion the following theorem shows the inviscid linear instability of the oscillatory shears 1 1 since un y y l 0 1 a n this shows that there exist unstable shears in any small l velocity neighborhood of the linear shear 2 3 in particular these unstable shears are arbitrarily small kinetic energy perturbations to the linear shear theorem 3 2 under the 2 d euler dynamics the oscillatory shears un defined by 1 1 are linearly unstable more precisely there exists an unstable eigenmode curve c with im c 0 of the rayleigh equation 3 3 with un stemming from a neutral mode n 1 2 where n c 0 n c 0 0 is independent of n the corresponding unstable eigenfunctions are in c 0 1 proof first notice that the oscillatory shears 1 1 are monotone since u n 0 so to show the linear instability of un by lemma 3 1 it suffices to prove that for at least one inflection point the sturm liouville operator 3 6 has a negative eigenvalue we choose the inflection point of un at y 1 2 define 3 8 q y u y u y u 1 2 16 2 na sin 4 n y y 1 2 a n sin 4 n y and the sturm liouville operator l d 2 dy 2 q y by rayleigh riesz principle the smallest eigenvalue 1 of l is given by 3 9 1 min h 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 q 2 dy 1 0 2 dy thus to prove that 1 is negative all we need to do is to show that the fraction on the right hand side of above is negative for some specific test function h 10 0 1 sommerfeld paradox 11 let y y 1 2 y 1 2 1 2 and denote q y q y 1 2 when y 1 8 n 1 8 n we have 2 4 n y sin 4 n y 4 n y thus q y 16 2 na sin 4 n y y a n sin 4 n y 16 2 na 2 4 n y y a n 4 n y 2 8 2 n 2 a 1 4 a we choose the test function as follows figure 2 y 1 4 n 1 8 n y 1 8 n 3 8 n y 1 8 n y 3 8 n 3 8 n y 3 8 n y 1 8 n 0 1 2 y 3 8 n since both q y and y are even in y we only need to estimate over the interval y 1 8 n 2 8 n 3 8 n 1 8 n 2 8 n 3 8 n 1 4 n figure 2 the test function 0 3 8 n first we have 3 8 n 0 2 dy 1 4 n notice that for 0 1 8 n un 1 4 n 1 2 un 1 2 un 1 4 n 1 2 un 1 2 0 since un is monotonically increasing and sin 4 n 1 4 n sin 4 n 1 4 n thus q 1 4 n q y 1 4 n 0 notice also that 1 4 n 1 4 n 0 so 3 8 n 1 8 n q 2 dy 1 8 n 0 q 1 4 n 2 1 4 n q 1 4 n 2 1 4 n d 0 12 y charles li and zhiwu lin on the other hand 1 8 n 0 q 2 dy 8 a 2 4 n 2 1 4 a 1 4 n 2 1 8 n 4 a 2 1 4 a 1 4 n 1 2 1 4 n where 4 a 1 0 1 2 for the oscillatory shears 1 1 we also have 3 8 n 0 2 dy 1 4 n 2 1 8 n 1 3 1 4 n 3 5 6 1 4 n 3 gathering all the above estimates together we get 1 0 2 q 2 dy 1 0 2 dy 3 8 n 0 2 q 2 dy 3 8 n 0 2 dy 6 5 4 n 2 1 2 1 by 3 9 this means 3 10 1 6 5 4 n 2 1 2 1 0 when 0 2 1 0 533 since 0 1 2 for the oscillatory shears un y 2 6 the corresponding 1 is negative thus by lemma 3 1 we get unstable modes c im c 0 to the rayleigh equation 3 3 associated with un y for certain intervals of wave number in particular the unstable wave number inter vals include a neighborhood of n 1 c 0 n and for those wave numbers the unstable eigenvalue c is close to the inflection value 1 2 here c 0 is a positive constant independent of n see 3 10 since un y c 0 1 the regularity of the unstable eigenfunction follows easily from the rayleigh equation 3 3 this completes the proof of the theorem remark 3 3 1 even though they approach the couette flow 2 3 in the energy norm and l norm of velocity as n the oscillatory shears 2 6 do not approach the linear shear in hs s 1 as n by simply noticing that u n 1 4 a cos 4 n y thus in our phase space s the oscillatory shears are of a finite distance away from the linear shear for large n on the other hand in fluid experiments it is the l norm of velocity that is observed thus for large n the oscillatory shears 2 6 can be considered to be small noises by fluid experimentalists 2 the form of the unstable shears un y 1 1 is not unique for example we could choose 3 11 un y y a n w ny where w y c 2 0 1 is a 1 periodic function of the similar shape as sin y by choosing constant a properly the proof of theorem 3 2 can still go through to get the linear instability of un y nevertheless we consider the oscillatory shears 2 6 as good representatives of linearly unstable shears near the linear shear since they are single fourier modes of 3 7 we also notice that the oscillatory structure of un 1 1 is in some sense nec essary for instability first for any given function f y c 2 0 1 the shear sommerfeld paradox 13 flow u y y f y is spectrally stable i e there is no unstable solution to the rayleigh equation 3 3 when is small enough this can be seen as follows when is small u y is monotone so by lemma 3 1 ii u y is spectrally stable if all the operators li d 2 dy 2 qi y are nonnegative where qi y f y u y u yi and yi i 1 l are all the inflection points of f y when is small qi y l is small so li 0 which proves the linear stability of u y second for shears of the form 3 11 with w y c 2 r to preserve the couette boundary conditions 2 2 for all large n the function w y must have infinitely many zeros so it is natural to choose w as a periodic function with zeros 3 for the sturm liouville operator l d 2 dy 2 q y with q y defined by 3 8 the second eigenvalue 2 0 see appendix for a proof thus 1 is the only negative eigenvalue of l so by sturm liouville theory 1 is simple and the corresponding eigenfunction n y can be chosen such that n y 0 when y 0 1 this fact will be used later in the proof of theorem 5 1 let d 0 l 1 0 1 where l 1 2 and is an unstable wave number for un y with n large as a corollary of theorem 3 2 we have theorem 3 4 the spectra of the linear euler operator at the oscillatory shear 2 6 in hs d s 3 are as follows 1 there are j 1 unstable eigenvalues and j 1 stable eigenvalues 2 the imaginary axis is the absolutely continuous spectrum the first claim is proved in theorem 3 2 and the proof of the second claim can be found in 11 for any linearly unstable shear flow of euler equation the nonlinear instability can be established too i e 1 16 32 moreover the existence of unstable and stable manifolds near unstable shear flows was recently proved 34 for euler equation 4 viscous linear instability of the sequence of oscillatory shears a more precise statement of the sommerfeld paradox is as follows mathematically the linear shear is linearly and nonlinear stable for all reynolds number r in fact all the eigenvalues of the orr sommerfeld operator satisfy the bound c r where c is a positive constant 45 experimentally for any r 360 where r 1 4 in our setting 2 there exists a threshold amplitude of perturbations of order o r where 1 21 4 depends on the type of the perturbations 23 which leads to transition to turbulence a mathematically more precise re statement of this experimental claim is as follows for any fixed amplitude of perturbations to the linear shear when r is sufficiently large transition to turbulence occurs for any fixed r when the amplitude of perturbations is sufficiently large transition to turbulence occurs there may even be an asymptotic relation between such amplitude threshold and r 14 y charles li and zhiwu lin our main idea of the resolution is as follows the oscillatory shears 2 6 are perturbations of the linear shear as n they approach the linear shear in l norm of velocity they are linearly unstable under the 2 d euler dynamics as shown later on this will lead to the existence of an unstable solution of the orr sommerfeld equation 3 1 with u given by the oscillatory shears 2 6 when the reynolds number r is sufficiently large notice that these oscillatory shears are not fixed points anymore under the navier stokes dynamics nevertheless they only drift very slowly the important fact is that here the unstable eigenvalue of the orr sommerfeld operator is order o 1 with respect to 1 r as 0 this fact should lead to a transient nonlinear growth near the oscillatory shears and the linear shear which manifests as a transition to turbulence this has been confirmed numerically 24 here the amplitude of the perturbation from the linear shear will be measured by the deviation of the oscillatory shears from the linear shear and the perturbation on top of the oscillatory shears one final note is that here the turbulence is often transient i e with a finite life time after which the flow re laminates back to the linear shear as mentioned in the introduction due to the recent discovery of 3 d steady states there has been a conjecture on the explanation of the sommerfeld paradox using the stable manifolds of the 3 d steady states the stable manifolds can not be connected to the linear shear since it is linearly stable the conjecture is that the stable manifolds can get close to the linear shear which leads to the transition from the linear shear to turbulence 13 the main criticism on this argument is that these 3 d steady states are quite far away from the linear shear even in the velocity variable for each of such 3 d steady states its stable manifold will have a fixed distance from the linear shear due to its romanov s nonlinear stability theorem 45 when the reynolds number r is large enough this distance will be much bigger than the threshold o r of perturbations given above this contradiction shows that the stable manifold explanation is not so satisfactory based upon the fact that the oscillatory shears 2 6 are linearly unstable under the 2 d euler dynamics it is natural to search for an unstable solution of the orr sommerfeld equation 3 1 with u given by 1 1 the main difficulty in this search naturally lies at the boundary conditions for rayleigh equation 3 3 only two boundary conditions are necessary while four are required for orr sommerfeld when is small of course the other two boundary conditions will create boundary layer effects by using the asymptotic expansion theory developed by w wasow 60 60 years ago we can prove the following theorem 4 1 let 0 c 0 be on the unstable eigenmode curve of the rayleigh equation associated with the oscillatory shears un 1 1 which stems from the neu tral mode 0 1 2 then for sufficiently small there exists an unstable eigenmode 0 c with im c 0 of the orr sommerfeld equation 3 1 with u given by 1 1 when 0 c c 0 proof rewrite the orr sommerfeld equation 3 1 in the following form 4 1 2 y 2 2 2 b y 2 y 2 u n 0 where un is given by the oscillatory shears 2 6 2 i r b y un c sommerfeld paradox 15 let 0 c 0 be on the unstable eigenvalue curve of the linear 2 d euler operator 0 in 3 1 stemming from the neutral mode n 1 2 as identified by theorem 3 2 c 0 c 0 r ic 0 i c 0 i 0 c 0 r is near 1 2 we will study the segment where c 0 is sufficiently close to 1 2 and the region c b 1 c 0 a circular disc of radius 0 1 1 2 c 0 i and centered at c 0 see figure 3 b 1 c 0 1 2 c figure 3 a c plane illustration we know that un y 1 2 has only one zero y 1 2 on the real segment y 0 1 thus we can find a rod region s around 0 1 in which un y 1 2 has only one zero at y 1 2 see figure 4 then by rouche theorem when c is sufficiently close to 1 2 un y c also has the only zero y near 1 2 y 1 2 1 1 4 a c 1 2 o c 1 2 2 and 4 2 u n y 1 4 a o c 1 2 2 6 0 define q y y y b s ds as y circles around y once in counter clockwise direction arg q y increases by 3 so there are three curves cj j 1 2 3 stemming from y on which re q y 0 by the derivative formula 4 2 there is a disc d centered at y 1 2 the radius of which is independent of c such that inside the disc the three curves cj can be well approximated by using un c 1 4 a y y we can choose the rod region s so thin that it penetrates d as shown in figure 5 direct calculation reveals that c 1 has an angle of 6 and the angles between 16 y charles li and zhiwu lin c 3 c 2 c 1 s 3 s 1 s 2 1 2 10 y y s figure 4 a y plane illustration neighboring cj s are 2 3 when c 1 2 along the two pieces of the interval 0 1 outside the disc d arg q y is not changing thus when c is sufficiently close to 1 2 but not equal to 1 2 the entire real interval 0 1 lies inside the two sectors s 1 s 2 y not included figure 4 inside the two sectors s 1 s 2 wasow obtained the following results 60 there are four linearly independent solutions to the orr sommerfeld equation 4 1 in the forms j e q y n n 0 jn y n f s 1 s 2 n 1 j 1 2 4 3 y f s 1 s 2 2 3 4 4 4 where re q y 0 in sj for j and changes sign when y crosses into the other sector jn are analytic in s 1 s 2 n is a large number f s 1 s 2 denotes any function which together with all its derivatives in y is uniformly bounded in in every closed subdomain of s 1 s 2 and y are two linearly independent solutions to the 0 orr sommerfeld equation 3 1 in particular here j j 1 2 3 4 are four linearly independent analytic solutions on the entire real interval 0 1 the eigenvalues of the orr sommerfeld operator 4 1 are given by the zeros of the determinant c 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 sommerfeld paradox 17 c 3 c 1 c 2 1 2 1 y s d 0 figure 5 another y plane illustration each entry of c is analytic in c b 1 c 0 c 0 6 1 2 wasow obtained the following expression 60 c 2 e q 0 q 1 k 0 c o 1 where 0 c 3 0 4 0 3 1 4 1 and re q 0 0 re q 1 0 k is a non zero constant let 1 c k 0 c o 1 notice that the unstable eigenvalue c 0 of the linear 2 d euler operator is a zero of 0 c here we fix 0 by a proper choice of 1 0 c is non zero on the boundary of b 1 c 0 then when is sufficiently large by rouche theorem 1 c also has a zero c near c 0 as c c 0 the proof is complete remark 4 2 the key point in the above proof is to show how to embed the entire real interval 0 1 inside the interior of the two sectors s 1 s 2 this key point was missing in 38 next we will develop an expression for the eigenfunction needed for later studies first we need a lemma lemma 4 3 re q y is a strictly monotone function on y 0 1 18 y charles li and zhiwu lin proof d dy re q y d dy re q y re q 0 r d dy re y 0 ci i un cr ds rre ci i un cr for the above to be zero we need ci 0 and un cr 0 since ci 0 in our case the above is never zero this proves the lemma the eigenfunction of the orr sommerfeld operator corresponding to the unsta ble eigenvalue given by the above theorem is given by 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 where j j 1 2 3 4 are given by 4 3 4 4 we need to know the asymptotic property of as for this the only trouble maker is the exponent q y we choose the convention 4 5 re q 0 0 re q 1 some of the entries in the expression of are exponentially small in dropping these entries we have 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 1 1 0 3 1 4 1 1 1 0 3 1 4 1 3 1 4 1 3 1

the convention 4 5 by rescaling 2 ere q 0 re q 1 we see that c 4 1 3 y 3 1 4 y o 1 notice that the quantity 4 1 3 y 3 1 4 y is not zero but small of order o 1 it depends upon c when it does approach zero taking derivatives of in y the balance of orders shifts to the first two terms in 4 6 one can clearly see that hs o s 1 as sommerfeld paradox 19 in fact it is a matter of scaling if we scale as nere q 0 re q 1 for any n then hs o s n 1 as 5 a bifurcation to kelvin s cat s eyes the bifurcation we are seeking will stem out of the oscillatory shear 2 6 since there is no external parameter in 2 d euler equation the bifurcation here is with regard to an internal parameter the wave number along x direction the proof of theorem 3 2 shows that there is a neutral mode c n 1 2 n to the rayleigh equation 3 3 associated with the oscillatory shear un y 1 1 here 2 n 1 is the negative eigenvalue of the operator l d 2 dy 2 q y with q y defined by 3 8 and n is the corresponding eigenfunction by the proof of theorem 3 2 n c 0 n by remark 3 3 3 we can choose n y such that n y 0 when y 0 1 the following theorem shows that we can get nontrivial inviscid travelling waves bifurcating from the above neutral modes theorem 5 1 there is a local bifurcation curve of travelling wave solutions to the 2 d euler equation with the stream function x 1 2 t y which stems out of the oscillatory shear un y 2 6 here is near n c 0 n theorem 3 2 y c 2 0 2 0 1 0 1 is periodic and even in of period 2 and is constant on y 0 and y 1 near y 1 2 the streamlines of these new fixed points have a kelvin cat s eye structure with a leading order expression given by 5 5 proof let x where will serve as the bifurcation parameter let rel y to be the relative stream function in the reference frame x 1 2 t y that is rel y y 1 2 y the travelling waves solves the poisson s equation 5 1 f 2 2 2 rel 2 2 rel y 2 f rel 0 for some function f with the boundary conditions that rel takes constant values on y 0 and y 1 since we seek nontrivial travelling waves near the oscillatory shear 2 6 we demand that the oscillatory shear 2 6 satisfies 5 1 too that is 5 2 2 rel y 2 f rel where rel y 1 2 y 1 2 2 a 4 n 2 cos 4 n y a 4 n 2 is the relative stream function for the the oscillatory shear 2 6 it follows from 5 2 that 5 3 f rel u n y un y 12 q y 20 y charles li and zhiwu lin where q y is defined before in 3 8 since both rel y and q y are symmetric to the line y 1 2 we only need to check 5 3 for 0 y 1 2 the function rel y is monotone on 0 1 2 since rel y un y 12 0 on 0 1 2 therefore we have f q rel 1 which determines the relation f in 5 1 we define y rel y 1 2 y 1 2 2 and reduce 5 1 to solve the equation 5 4 2 2 2 2 y 2 1 f 1 2 y 1 2 2 0 with the homogeneous boundary conditions 0 1 0 for 0 1 define the spaces b y c 2 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 2 periodic and even in and d y c 0 0 2 0 1 2 periodic and even in consider the mapping f 2 b r 7 d defined by f 2 2 2 2 2 y 1 f 1 2 y 1 2 2 then the travelling wave solutions satisfy the equation f 2 0 the trivial solutions corresponding to the oscillatory shears 2 6 have y a 4 n 2 cos 4 n y a 4 n 2 let 2 n be the negative eigenvalue of 2 y q y and n y the corresponding positive eigenfunction the linearized operator of f around 2 n has the form l f 2 n 2 n 2 2 2 y f rel 2 n 2 2 2 y q y then by remark 3 3 3 the kernel of l b 7 d is given by ker l n y cos in particular the dimension of ker l is 1 since l is self adjoint n y cos 6 r l the range of l in fact again by remark 3 3 3 dim b r l 1 sommerfeld paradox 21 notice that 2 f 2 is continuous and 2 f 2 n n y cos 2 2 n y cos n y cos 6 r l therefore by the crandall rabinowitz local bifurcation theorem 6 there is a local bifurcating curve 2 of f 2 0 which intersects the trivial curve 2 at 2 2 n such that y n y cos o and 2 is a continuous function 2 0 2 n so the relative stream function has the form 5 5 rel y 1 2 y 1 2 2 y n y cos o since n y 0 in 0 1 so near the inflection point y 1 2 of the oscillatory shear 1 1 the streamlines of these travelling waves have a cat s eye structure see 8 with saddle points near 1 2 2 j j z the proof is complete remark 5 2 1 the small travelling waves constructed in theorem 5 1 has a x period of the order o 1 n in particular the cat s eyes near the oscillatory shear un y has the spatial scale 1 n 2 since the oscillatory shears un y 2 6 are arbitrarily close to the linear shear in l 2 norm of velocity the travelling waves constructed in theorem 5 1 appear in an arbitrarily small l 2 velocity neighborhood of the linear shear we note that there might not exist nontrivial travelling waves near the linear shear in a stronger norm in lieu of romanov s nonlinear stability theorem 45 this conjecture is partly supported by the following rough argument any travelling wave of 2 d euler equation satisfies the poisson s equation 5 6 g for some function g in 0 l 0 1 where l is the x period and is the relative stream function taking x derivative of 5 6 we get x g x note that x 0 on the boundaries y 0 and y 1 multiplying above by x and integration by parts in we get x 2 dxdy g x 2 dxdy if the travelling wave is close to the linear shear in a strong norm e g c 1 vorticity g should be close to 1 in c 1 norm and thus g l is very small we have x 2 dxdy g l x 2 dxdy but we also have x 2 dxdy x x 2 x 2 dxdy since x 0 on and the operator with dirichlet boundary conditions on has the lowest eigenvalue 2 so if g l 2 we must have x 0 in and the travelling wave is a trivial shear flow 22 y charles li and zhiwu lin remark 5 3 after this paper the study of euler traveling waves near couette was extended in 34 to show that vorticity h 3 2 is the critical regularity for the existence of nontrivial traveling waves near couette more precisely it is shown in 34 that there exist cats s eyes flows in any vorticity hs s 3 2 neighborhood of couette with arbitrary minimal x period and no nontrivial traveling waves exist in a sufficiently small vorticity hs s 3 2 neighborhood of couette these results shed some light on another puzzle about couette flow namely the nonlinear inviscid damping for which the linear damping was first discovered by orr 40 in 1907 6 inviscid linear instability of 3 d shears in this section we show that the instability of oscillatory shears un y 1 1 persists under the 3 d setting consider a 3 d

d shears so far the understanding of the instability of such 3 d shears remains very limited due to the complicated nature of 6 5 6 6 our next theorem shows instability of 3 d shears close to an unstable 2 d shear theorem 6 1 let u 0 y c 2 0 1 be such that the rayleigh equation 3 3 has an unstable solution with 0 c 0 0 im c 0 0 fixed lz 0 consider u y z c 1 0 1 0 lz lz periodic in z and 6 7 u

moreover if u y z c then u v w p c sommerfeld paradox 23 the proof of theorem 6 1 is divided into several steps first we give a new formulation of linearized growing modes for 3 d shears fixed 0 consider a growing mode solution ei 0 x ct u v w p y z im c 0 to the linearized euler equation around u y z 0 0 instead of studying 6 5 6 6 we reformulate the problem in the following way from 6 1 6 4

assumption that im c 0 define 6 14 wy vz then by equation 6 9 6 15 u c uyw uzv 0 taking y z divergence of 6 9 and using 6 10 we get 6 16 2 p 20 u c u i 0 uyv uzw from 6 11 and 6 9 p satisfies the

2 1 n f to be the unique solution in h 2 0 2 of the neumann problem 2 h f in 2 h n 0 on 2 24 y charles li and zhiwu lin thus from 6 16 we get 6 17 qp 2 1 n 20 u c u i 0 uyv uzw denote b 2 1 n q q 2 1 n q then b l 2 2 h 2 0 2 is a self adjoint bounded and nonnegative operator we rewrite 6 17 as 6 18 qp 20 b uu c 20 bu i 0 b uyv uzw multiplying 6 8 by q and using the equation 6 18 we get i 0 c 1 20 b u 6 19 i 0 20 b q uu 20 b q uyv uzw where we use the property qu u due to 6 12 let i 0 c then re 0 from 6 19 and 6 15 we get u i 0 u u 6 20 1 20 b 1 i 0 1 q uu 20 b q uyv uzw i 0 uyw uzv i 0 u u i 0

next lemma lemma 6 2 i a l 2 2 2 l 2 2 2 is compact perturbation of f ii the essential spectrum of a is i 0 minu 0 minu sommerfeld paradox 25 proof ii is a corollary of i because of weyl s theorem see 17 or 20 and the fact that the operator f is bounded skew adjoint and has the essential spec trum i 0 minu 0 minu to show i we need to prove that k l 2 2 2 l 2 2 2 is compact by lemma 7 1 we have v w h 1 2 u 2 h 1 2 c 0 div u 2 l 2 curl u 2 l 2 c 0 0 u l 2 l 2 thus the linear mapping u v w is compact in l 2 2 2 since 1 20 b 1 b q are bounded this proves the compactness of k as a corollary of the above lemma any eigenvalue of a with re 0 is a discrete eigenvalue with finite multiplicity by using the formulation 6 20 the proof of persistence of instability for 3 d shears is similar to that in 12 for 2 d euler equation given with re 0 and u y z c 1 10 1 0 lz we define the operator m u f 1 k in l 2 2 2 then the growing mode equation is reduced to solve m u u for some with re 0 lemma 6 3 consider c re 0 and u y z satisfying conditions in theorem 6 1 then i m u l 2 2 2 l 2 2 2 is compact and analytical in c ii m u depends continuously on u in the following sense let v y z satisfy the same conditions of u y z as in theorem 6 1 then for any b 0 there exists another constant c 0 such that 6 22 sup re b m u m v l l 2 2 2 c u v w 1 p proof since f is skew adjoint for any with re 0 f 1 is bounded andm is compact in l 2 2 2 by lemma 6 2 since f generates an unitary group and f 1 0 e f tdt so m u is analytic in in the half plane c to show ii we write m u m v f u 1 k u f v 1 k v f u 1 f u f v f v 1 k u f v 1 k u k v i ii 26 y charles li and zhiwu lin when re b f u 1 1 b both k u and f u are norm continuous to u in the norm u w 1 p which we show below we use c for a generic constant first f u f v 0 u v l c u v w 1 p second for any u l 2 2 2 we have k u k v u l 2 c u v l u l 2 u v lp v w l 2 p p 2 c u v l u l 2 u v lp v w h 1 c u v w 1 p u l 2 and thus k u k v l 2 c u v w 1 p so both i and ii above are uniformly controlled by u v w 1 p this proves 6 22 the proof of theorem 6 1 uses the following lemma of steinberg 50 lemma 6 4 let t s be a family of compact operators on a banach space analytic in and jointly continuous in s for each s s where is an open set in c and s is an interval in r if for each s there exists a such that i t s is invertible then i t s 1 is meromorphic in for each s and the poles of i t s 1 depend continuously on s and can appear or disappear only at the boundary of or at infinity proof of theorem 6 1 by definition is an unstable eigenvalue of a if and only if 1 is an eigenvalue of m u for re 0 and 0 s 1 define t s 1 s m u 0 sm u by lemma 6 3 these operators are compact analytic in and continuous in s the assumption on u 0 y implies that 0 i 0 c 0 is a pole of i t 0 1 in the right half plane since the poles of i t 0 1 are discrete we can choose 0 so small such that on the circle 0 0 the inverse i t 0 1 exists by the continuity property 6 22 t s t 0 s m u 0 m u c u u 0 w 1 p thus when u u 0 w 1 p is sufficiently small i t s 1 also exists on the cir cle for all s 0 1 thus by lemma 6 4 there exists a pole 1 of i t 1 1 i m u 1 within the disk 0 0 for 0 small 1 also has positive real part and is an unstable eigenvalue of the operator a associated with u y z let u l 2 2 2 be the corresponding eigenfunction and v w h 1 2 2 is determined by u as in the definition of k define c 1 i 0 p 1 i 0 i 0 u c u vuy wuz sommerfeld paradox 27 we check that u v w p solves the growing mode equations 6 8 6 11 first an integration of the equation au 1 u implies that 2 u dydz 0 namely qu u so 6 10 follows from 6 21 the equations 6 8 and 6 11 are already implied in our construction to check 6 9 first we note that the vector field i 0 u c v w is curl free because of the equation 6 15 which follows from a 1 so there exists a scalar function p y z such that i 0 u c v w p x p y taking divergence of above and using 6 10 we can set p 2 1 n 20 u c u i 0 uyv uzw by modulating a constant it remains to show 6 17 from which 6 9 follows we note that au 1 u implies 6 19 combining with qu u we get 6 18 an equivalent form of 6 17 to show the regularity of the growing mode we look at the eigenfunction equation m u 1 f 1 k u u the eigenfunction u l 2 2 2 implies that v w h 1 2 2 and thus k u h 1 2 2 since 1 f 1 is regularity preserving we have u h 1 2 2 if u c we can repeat this process to deduce that u hk 2 2 for any k 1 and therefore u c 2 2 then u v w p c 2 this finishes the proof of theorem 6 1 remark 6 5 in theorem 6 1 the smallness of u y z u 0 y w 1 p 2 p 2 is required to show persistence of instability for 2 d shears i e u u y we can show that if u y u 0 y h 1 0 1 is small enough then linear instability of u 0 y implies that of u y this is an improvement over the result in 12 where the smallness in c 2 norm is required to prove persistence of instability for 2 d euler flows without hyperbolic points the proof is very similar to the 3 d case although much simpler so we only sketch it briefly in the 2 d case we reformulate the growing mode problem in terms of u using the notations as before from the linearized equations we derive u i 0 uu i 0 1 0 uu dy 1 20 b 1 20 b q uyv here q is the projector from l 2 0 1 to mean zero space and b q d 2 dy 2 1 n q where d 2 dy 2 1 n is the mean zero solution operator of the 1 d neumann problem the mapping u v is defined by solving the ode dv dy i 0 qu v 0 v 1 0 the rest of the proof is the same as in the 3 d case so we skip it smallness of u y u 0 y h 1 0 1 is required in the proof because of the sobolev embedding h 1 0 1 l 0 1 28 y charles li and zhiwu lin 7 appendix proof of the claim 2 0 in remark 3 3 3 by the sturm liouville the orem 62 the linear operator l l q y 0 1 0 has a sequence of real eigenvalues 1 2 3 and there is a unique eigenfunction n corresponding to each eigenvalue n which has exactly n 1 zeros in 0 1 moreover n form an orthonormal base of l 2 0 1 under the boundary condition 0 1 0 thus 1 min l where denotes l 2 inner product in the case of theorem 3 2 we also know that 2 0 by the following argument suppose otherwise 2 0 and let 2 be its corresponding eigenfunction then 2 has one zero z 0 1 let u y u 1 2 then 7 1 q 0 also 7 2 2 q 2 2 2 multiplying 7 2 by and 7 1 by 2 then subtracting we have 7 3 2 2 2 2 if z 1 2 we use the interval 0 z otherwise we use the interval z 1 without loss of generality we assume z 1 2 integrating 7 3 over the interval 0 z we have 7 4 2 z 0 2 z 0 2 dy on the interval 0 z neither nor 2 changes sign we note that 2 0 has the same sign with 2 on 0 z while 2 z has the opposite sign then the right hand side and the left hand side of 7 4 have opposite signs a contradiction is reached even in the case 2 0 0 and or 2 z 0 thus 2 0 the following lemma is used in the proof of theorem 6 1 lemma 7 1 given f 1 f 2 l 2 2 2 and 2 f 1 dydz 0 then there exists a unique vector field u v w h 1

existence we split u u 1 u 2 where u 1 and u 2 satisfy div u 1 0 curl u 1 f 2 and div u 2 f 1 curl u 2 0 respectively with conditions 7 7 and 7 8 for existence and uniqueness of u 1 we refer to theorem 2 2 of 36 chapter 1 we construct u 2 where solves the neumann problem f 1 in 2 n 0 on 2 the solvability is ensured by the zero mean assumption on f 1 and fredholm al ternative principle note that condition 7 7 is automatic for the gradient flow u 2 second we show uniqueness if there exists two vectors fields u and u satisfying 7 5 7 8 then their difference u u u is an irrotational and divergence free field tangent to 2 with zero circulations on 2 by theorem 2 1 of 36 chapter 1 u 0 and thus u u it remains to prove the estimate 7 9 for this we use the following general estimate see 1 26 in 52 page 318 let be an open bounded domain of r 2 m is an integer 1 then for any u hm with u n 0 on there exists c m such that 7 10 u hm c div u hm 1 curl u hm 1 u l 2 we shall show that for any u h 1 2 2 satisfying 7 7 and 7 8 7 11 u l 2 2 c 0 div u l 2 2 curl u l 2 2 then 7 9 is obvious from 7 10 and 7 11 we prove 7 11 by a contradiction argument suppose otherwise for any n 1 there exists un h 1 2 2 such that 7 12 un l 2 2 n div un l 2 2 curl un l 2 2 we normalize un l 2 2 1 then by 7 10 un h 1 2 is uniformly bounded so un converges to u weakly in h 1 2 and strongly in l 2 2 thus u l 2 2 1 but from 7 12 u is irrotational and divergence free moreover u also satisfies 7 7 and 7 8 so u 0 a contradiction this finishes the proof acknowledgement this work is supported partly by the nsf
