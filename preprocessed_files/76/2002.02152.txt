a locally anisotropic regularity criterion for the navier stokes equation in terms of vorticity evan miller 1 1 mcmaster university department of mathematics and statistics millee 14 mcmaster ca november 2 2021 abstract in this paper we will prove a regularity criterion that guarantees solutions of the navier stokes equation must remain smooth so long as the the vorticity restricted to a plane remains bounded in the scale critical space l 4 tl 2 x where the plane may vary in space and time as long as the gradient of the vector orthogonal to the plane remains bounded this extends previous work by chae and choe that guaranteed that solutions of the navier stokes equation must remain smooth as long as the vorticity restricted to a fixed plane remains bounded in family of scale critical mixed lebesgue spaces this regularity criterion also can be seen as interpolating between chae and choe s regularity criterion in terms of two vorticity components and beira o da veiga and berselli s regularity criterion in terms of the gradient of vorticity direction 1 introduction the navier stokes equation is the fundamental equation of fluid mechanics the incompressible navier stokes equation is given by tu u u u p 0 u 0 1 1 where p is determined entirely by u by convolution with the poisson kernel p 1 3 i j 1 uj xi ui xj 1 2 the navier stokes equation is best viewed as an evolution equation on the space of divergence free vector fields rather than as a system of equations and that is the vantage point we will adopt in this paper two other fundamentally important objects for the study of the navier stokes equation are the strain and the vorticity the strain is the symmetric part of u and is given by sij 1 2 iuj jui 1 3 1 ar x iv 2 00 2 02 15 2 v 1 m at h a p 6 f eb 2 02 0 the vorticity is the curl of the velocity u it is a vector representation of the anti symmetric party of u with a 1 2 0 3 2 3 0 1 2 1 0 1 4 where aij 1 2 iuj jui 1 5 note that is implies that for all v r 3 av 1 2 v 1 6 the evolution equation for the strain is given by ts s u s s 2 1 4 1 4 2 i 3 hess p 0 1 7 and the evolution equation for vorticity is given by t u s 0 1 8 before we proceed we should define a number of spaces we will take h 1 r 3 to be the homogeneous hilbert space with norm u 2 h 1 r 3 4 2 2 u 2 d 1 9 we will note that for all u h 1 we have u 2 h 1 u 2 l 2 1 10 we will take the inhomogeneous hilbert space h 1 r 3 to be the space with norm u 2 h 1 u 2 l 2 u 2 h 1 1 11 finally we will take the mixed lebesgue space l p tl q x to be the banach space l p tl q x l p 0 t lq r 3 1 12 we will note in particular that u l t l x ess sup x r 3 0 t u x 1 13 in his foundational work on the navier stokes equation leray proved the global existence of weak solutions to the navier stokes equation satisfying an energy inequality for arbitrary initial data u 0 l 2 15 such solutions however are not known to be either smooth or unique kato and fujita introduced the the notion of mild solutions 7 which are solutions that satisfy the navier stokes equation tu u u u p 1 14 2 in the sense of convolution with the heat kernel as in duhamel s formula they used this notion of solution in particular the higher regularity that can be extracted from the heat kernel to show that the navier stokes equation has unique smooth solutions locally in time for arbitrary initial data u 0 h 1 mild solutions are only known to exist locally in time however and so this approach based on the heat semigroup cannot guarantee the existence of global in time smooth solutions of the navier stokes equation it is one of the biggest open questions in the field of nonlinear pdes whether smooth solutions of the navier stokes equations can develop singularities in finite time if the h 1 norm remains bounded this guarantees that a solution of the navier stokes equation must remain smooth but there is no known bound on the growth of the h 1 norm of u one bound we do have for smooth solutions of the navier stokes equation is the energy equality proposition 1 1 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 r 3 is a mild solution to the navier stokes equation then for all 0 t tmax 1 2 u t 2 l 2 t 0 u 2 l 2 d 1 2 u 0 2 l 2 1 15 the energy equality gives us bounds on solutions u of the navier stokes equation in l t l 2 x and l 2 t h 1 x but this cannot guarantee regularity because both of these bounds are supercritical with respect to the scale invariance of the navier stokes equation the solution set of the navier stokes equation is invariant under the rescaling u x t u x 2 t 1 16 if we do have a bound on u in a scale invariant l p tl q x space then that is enough to guarantee regularity in particular the ladyzhenskaya prodi serrin regularity criterion 13 22 23 states that if a smooth solution of the navier stokes equation develops a singularity in finite time tmax then for all 2 p 3 q 2 3 q then tmax 0 u t plq dt 1 17 it is easy to check that this regularity criterion is scale critical with respect to the rescaling in 1 16 this result was extended to the q 3 p case by escauriaza seregin and s vera k 6 where they proved that if tmax then lim sup t tmax u t l 3 r 3 1 18 there have been many extensions of these regularity criteria far more than we can discuss here so we will confine ourselves to discussing regularity criteria directly related to this paper for a very thorough overview of the literature on regularity criteria for solutions to the navier stokes equation see chapter 11 in 14 one regularity criterion proven by chae and choe 2 has a particular geometric significance chae and choe prove a scale critical regularity criterion on two components of vorticity for a two dimensional solution of the navier stokes equation in the xy plane the vorticity is entirely in the z direction perpendicular to the xy plane this means that if the vorticity restricted to the xy plane or using rotational invariance any fixed plane remains bounded in a scale critical space then the solution is not too far from being two dimensional the size of the vorticity restricted to a plane can be interpreted as a measure of how fully three dimensional a solution of the navier stokes equation is so chae and choe s regularity criterion can be interpreted as saying that blowup must be fully three dimensional chae and choe s result is the following 3 theorem 1 2 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 r 3 is a mild solution of the navier stokes equa tion and let v r 3 v 1 then for all 3 q 2 p 2 3 2 q there exists cq 0 depending only on q such that for all 0 t tmax u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp cq t 0 v plq d 1 19 in particular if tmax then tmax 0 v t plq dt 1 20 remark 1 3 chae and choe s result is not stated in this form in 2 chae and choe prove a regularity criterion on two components of the vorticity 1 2 0 however we can see that e 3 2 1 0 1 21 this means that a regularity criterion on 1 2 0 is equivalent to a regularity criterion on e 3 using the rotational invariance of the navier stokes equation this is equivalent to a regularity criterion on v for any fixed unit vector v r 3 we note that the navier stokes equation is rationally invariant in the sense that if q so 3 is a rotation matrix on r 3 and u is a solution of the navier stokes equation then uq is also a solution of the navier stokes equation where uq x qtru qx 1 22 see chapter 1 in 16 for further discussion we will note that because u is a derivative of u the vorticity has the rescaling x t 2 x 2 t 1 23 if is a solution of the vorticity equation then so is for all 0 theorem 1 2 is critical with respect to this rescaling theorem 1 2 was then extended into besov spaces by chen and zhang 24 and more recently into the endpoint besov space b 3 q by guo kuc era and skala k 8 this is an improvement on theorem 1 2 because we have an embedding lq b 3 q and b 3 q is the largest translation invariant banach space with the the same scaling relation as lq this is therefore the furthest ad vance that can be made to chae and choe s regularity criterion solely by loosening the assumptions on the space another regularity criterion with geometric significance is the regularity criterion in terms of the positive part of the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain matrix this was first proven by neustupa and penel in 19 21 and independently by the author using different methods in 17 theorem 1 4 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 r 3 is a mild solution of the navier stokes equa tion let 1 x t 2 x t 3 x t be the eigenvalues of s x t and let 2 x t max 0 2 x t then for all 3 q 2 p 2 3 2 q there exists cq 0 depending only on q such that for all 0 t tmax u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp cq t 0 2 plq d 1 24 in particular if tmax then tmax 0 2 t plq dt 1 25 4 this regularity criterion gives a geometric characterization of the structure of potential finite time blowup solutions of the navier stokes equation theorem 1 4 says that in order for blowup to occur the flow needs to be stretching in two directions while compressing more strongly in the third points where the strain has two positive eigenvalues corresponding to stretching in two directions and one negative eigenvalue corresponding to compressing more strongly in a third are the points that drive enstrophy growth and hence blowup this provides more insight into the qualitative properties of blowup solutions than the regularity criteria that just involve the size of u or the author also proved the following corollary of theorem 1 4 in 17 corollary 1 5 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 r 3 is a mild solution of the navier stokes equa tion let v l r 3 0 tmax r 3 with v x t 1 almost everywhere then for all 3 q 2 p 2 3 2 q there exists cq 0 depending only on q such that for all 0 t tmax u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp cq t 0 s v plq d 1 26 in particular if tmax then tmax 0 s t v t p lq r 3 dt 1 27 this result follows from theorem 1 4 because tr s 0 so 2 is the smallest eigenvalue of s in magnitude therefore if v r 3 v 1 then sv 2 1 28 corollary 1 5 follows immediately from this fact and theorem 1 4 we will show in section 3 that the special case of corollary 1 5 where we take v r 3 to be a fixed unit vector is equivalent to chae and choe s result theorem 1 2 this raises an interesting question can chae and choe s result be extended to a regularity criterion on v where v is a unit vector that is allowed to vary in space clearly unlike in corollary 1 5 we won t be able to take an arbitrary unit vector otherwise we would simply take v and regularity would be guaranteed for any solution of the navier stokes equation in fact using corollary 1 5 it is possible to improve chae and choe s result to one that allows the unit vector v to vary in space and time so long as v remains bounded the main theorem of this paper is the following theorem 1 6 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 r 3 is a mild solution of the navier stokes equa tion suppose v l r 3 0 r 3 with v x t 1 almost everywhere and suppose v l loc 0 l r 3 then for all for all 0 t tmax u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp 2916 c 2 u 0 4 l 2 v 2 l t l x c 2 8 t 0 v 4 l 2 d 1 29 where c 2 is a constant independent of u taken is in theorem 1 4 and corollary 1 5 in particular if tmax then tmax 0 v t t 4 l 2 dt 1 30 5 chae and choe s result theorem 1 2 states that for a solution of the navier stokes equation to blowup in finite time the vorticity must become unbounded in every fixed plane for a two dimensional flow in the xy plane the vorticity is entirely in the z direction so theorem 1 2 can be interpreted as requiring the blowup of vorticity to be globally three dimensional theorem 1 6 strengthens this result by requiring the vorticity to blowup in every plane where the plane may vary in space and time so long as the gradient of the vector orthogonal to the plane remains bounded meaning the geometry of the blowup must be locally three dimensional this result highlights the strength of the strain formulation of the navier stokes regularity problem using the strain formulation we are able to get a stronger regularity criterion in terms of the vorticity than by working directly with the vorticity formation theorem 1 6 follows as a fairly direct corollary of corollary 1 5 using the relationship between the structure of the strain and vorticity that is imposed by the divergence free condition on the velocity because the regularity criterion on 2 gives us geometric information that is fundamentally anisotropic in that it does not involve any fixed direction it allows us to go from component reduction regularity criterion that involve some fixed direction and therefore guarantee regularity as long as the solution is not too far away from being globally two dimensional in some sense to a component reduction type regularity criterion that only requires that the solution is not too far away from being locally two dimensional the regularity criterion in terms of 2 first proven by neustupa and penel therefore encodes fundamentally anisotropic information about the structure of possible blowup solutions that does not require the imposition of any arbitrary direction for this reason it is quite powerful we should also note that while chae and choe s result holds for 2 p 3 q 2 3 2 q the proof of theorem 1 6 only holds with q 2 p 4 because the hilbert space structure of l 2 is essential to the proof it is possible that theorem 1 6 can be generalized for all 3 2 q but this would require much more delicate analysis and likely somewhat different techniques there are several other scale critical component reduction type regularity criteria for instance kukavica and ziane 12 showed that if a smooth solution of the navier stokes equation blows up in finite time tmax and if 2 p 3 q 2 with 9 4 q 3 then tmax 0 3 u t p lq dt 1 31 more recently it was shown by chemin and zhang 3 and chemin zhang and zhang 4 that if tmax and 4 p then tmax 0 u 3 t p h 1 2 2 p dt 1 32 neustupa novotny and penel had previously proven a regularity criterion on u 3 18 which was the first result of this type but their regularity criteria was not scale critical it required u 3 to be in the subcritical space l p tl q x with 2 p 3 q 1 2 like theorem 1 2 due to chae and choe all of these results say that the flow must be regular as long as it is not too three dimensional in the sense that either u 3 or 3 u remains bounded in the appropriate scale critical space the rotational invariance of the navier stokes equation implies that there is nothing special about the particular direction e 3 so 3 u and u 3 can be replaced by v u and u v respectively for any unit vector v r 3 but the vector v cannot be allowed to vary in space these regularity criteria are therefore global anistotropic regularity criteria in that they require solutions which are globally anisotropic in some sense to remain smooth theorem 1 6 is significantly stronger because it is a locally anisotropic regularity criterion which only requires solutions to be locally anisotropic to remain smooth 6 there is one recent regularity result that does involve local anisotropy kukavica rusin and ziane proved that if u is a suitable weak solution on r 3 and for some domain d r 3 r we have 3 u l p tl q x d with 2 p 3 q 2 9 4 q 5 2 then u is ho lder continuous on d 11 this is a locally anisotropic regularity criterion because we only require control on 3 u in some domain not globally this implies that the control on the anisotropy is local this differs from theorem 1 6 which involves an estimate over the whole space and is therefore a global not local regularity criterion but a global regularity criterion that is locally anisotropic on account of the direction being allowed to vary we will discuss the relationship between kukavica rusin and ziane s regularity criterion and theorem 1 6 further in section 3 another regularity criterion related to theorem 1 6 is the regularity criterion in terms of the vorticity direction proven by constantin and fefferman which states that the direction of the vorticity must vary rapidly in regions where the vorticity is large in order for a solution of the navier stokes equation to blowup 5 this was a very important advance in that the rapid change of the vorticity direction in regions of large vorticity has long been at least heuristically understood as a fundamental property of turbulent flow and constantin and fefferman s result shows that any navier stokes blowup solution must be turbulent in this sense indeed even leonardo da vinci s qualitative studies of turbulence in the early 1500 s 9 show an understanding of the fundamental character of a rapid change in the orientation of vortices in turbulent regions of the fluid to the phenomenon of turbulence figure 1 leonardo da vinci studies of turbulent water royal collection trust kolmogorov would rigourously describe the phenomenon depicted purely heuristically by da vinci with his celebrated theory of turbulent cascades 10 which remains central to our under standing of turbulence kolmogorov showed that turbulence should involve a transfer of energy from lower order frequency modes to higher with a decay of the energy spectrum e 5 3 and also that turbulence is locally isotropic with no preferred vorticity direction constantin and fef ferman were the first to connect the change in the orientation of vortices in turbulent regions to the 7 navier stokes regularity problem which suggests that blowup for the navier stokes equation is not only of purely mathematical interest but could have significant physical implications particularly if there is finite time blowup on our phenomenological understanding of turbulence constantin and fefferman s result was later generalized by beira o da veiga and berselli in 1 in particular as a corollary of their refined result that the vorticity direction must vary rapidly in regions with large vorticity they proved a regularity criterion in terms of the gradient of the vorticity direction theorem 1 7 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 is a mild solution of the navier stokes equation that blows up in finite time tmax then for all 2 p 3 q 1 2 6 q tmax 0 t p lq dt 1 33 this is related to theorem 1 6 because if we take v then we find that theorem 1 6 implies if tmax then ess sup 0 t tmax t l 1 34 if we take the p 4 q case of theorem 1 7 then we can see that if a solution of the navier stokes equation blows up in finite time tmax then tmax 0 t 4 l dt 1 35 we will note that beira o da veiga and berselli s result is stronger than the special case of theorem 1 6 where we take v because it not only specifies that must become unbounded as we approach blowup time but also a rate of blowup namely that its integral to the fourth power must go to infinity we can see that the two extremal cases of theorem 1 6 are the case where v is constant and hence v 0 in which case we recover theorem 1 2 from chae and choe and the case where v and hence v 0 in which case we recover a weaker form of theorem 1 7 from beira o da veiga and berselli therefore this result could be said to interpolate between these two results although suboptimally at one end we will discuss why this interpolation is suboptimal in section 3 in section 2 we will prove the main result of the paper theorem 1 6 in section 3 we will further discuss the relationship between this result and the previous literature 2 proof of the main theorem we will now prove theorem 1 6 which is restated here for the reader s convenience theorem 2 1 suppose u c 0 tmax h 1 r 3 is a mild solution of the navier stokes equa tion suppose v l r 3 0 r 3 with v x t 1 almost everywhere and suppose v l loc 0 l r 3 then for all for all 0 t tmax u t 2 h 1 u 0 2 h 1 exp 2916 c 2 u 0 4 l 2 v 2 l t l x c 2 8 t 0 v 4 l 2 d 2 1 8 where c 2 is taken is in theorem 1 4 and corollary 1 5 in particular if tmax then tmax 0 v t t 4 l 2 dt 2 2 proof we will prove that this theorem is a corollary of corollary 1 5 in particular we will show that t 0 s v 4 l 2 d 2916 u 0 4 l 2 v l t l x 1 8 t 0 v 4 l 2 d 2 3 first we will recall from 1 6 that 1 2 v av 2 4 1 2 u v 1 2 u trv 2 5 therefore we find that 1 4 v 2 l 2 1 4 u v 2 l 2 1 4 u trv 2 l 2 1 2 u v u trv 2 6 likewise we may compute that sv 1 2 u v 1 2 u trv 2 7 and therefore sv 2 l 2 1 4 u v 2 l 2 1 4 u trv 2 l 2 1 2 u v u trv 2 8 putting together 2 6 and 2 8 we find that sv 2 l 2 1 4 v 2 l 2 u v u trv 2 9 we know that for all a b 0 a b 2 2 a 2 2 b 2 so we find that sv 4 l 2 1 8 v 4 l 2 2 u v u trv 2 2 10 now we will need to estimate u v u trv by definition we have u v u trv 3 i j k 1 r 3 iujvj kuivk dx 2 11 integrating by parts with respect to xi and applying the fact that u 3 i 1 iui 0 we find that u v u trv 3 i j k 1 r 3 uj kui vk ivj vj ivk dx 2 12 3 i j k 1 r 3 2 u u v v 2 13 54 r 3 u u v 2 14 54 u l 2 u l 2 v l 2 15 9 this estimate implies that sv 4 l 2 1 8 v 4 l 2 5832 u 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 v 2 l 2 16 applying the energy equality and our hypothesis on v we find that t 0 u 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 v 2 l d t 0 u 0 2 l 2 u 2 l 2 v 2 l t l x d 2 17 u 0 2 l 2 v 2 l t l x t 0 u 2 l 2 d 2 18 1 2 u 0 4 l 2 v 2 l t l x 2 19 therefore we may conclude that t 0 s v 4 l 2 d 2916 u 0 4 l 2 v 2 l t l x 1 8 t 0 v 4 l 2 d 2 20 applying corollary 1 5 this completes the proof 3 relationship to the previous literature in this section we will further discuss the relationship between the results in this paper and the previous literature in particular we will show that theorem 1 5 the regularity criterion on sv is equivalent to chae and choe s regularity criterion on v in the special case where we take v r 3 to be a fixed unit vector in order to do this we will first need to introduce the helmholtz decomposition of vector fields in lq 1 q into gradients and divergence free vector fields proposition 3 1 suppose 1 q for all v lq r 3 r 3 there exists a unique u lq r 3 r 3 u 0 and f lq r 3 r 3 such that v u f note because we do not have any assumptions of higher regularity we will say that u 0 if for all c c r 3 r 3 u 0 3 1 and we will say that f is a gradient if for all w c c r 3 r 3 w 0 we have r 3 f w 0 3 2 furthermore there exists cq 1 depending only on q such that u lq cq v lq 3 3 and f lq cq v lq 3 4 using this decomposition we will define the projection onto the space of divergence free vector fields pdf l q lq to be pdf v u 3 5 and the projection onto the space of gradients pgr l q lq to be pgr v f 3 6 10 we can now show that for any fixed unit vector v r 3 sv lq and v lq are equivalent norms proposition 3 2 suppose u 0 and u lq then for all unit vectors v r 3 and for all 1 q v u lq cq v lq 3 7 v u lq cq 2 sv lq 3 8 u v lq cq v lq 3 9 u v lq cq 2 sv lq 3 10 where cq is taken as in proposition 3 1 furthermore 1 2 cq v lq 2 sv lq 2 cq v lq 3 11 proof first we will observe that the rotational invariance of the space of divergence free vector fields means that we can take v e 3 without loss of generality it is a simple calculation to see that e 3 3 u u 3 3 12 likewise we can see that 2 se 3 3 u u 3 3 13 clearly u 3 is a gradient and we can also see that 3 u is divergence free because 3 u 3 u 3 14 0 3 15 this implies that 3 u pdf e 3 3 16 3 u pdf 2 se 3 3 17 applying proposition 3 1 we can therefore conclude that 3 u lq cq e 3 lq 3 18 3 u lq cq 2 se 3 lq 3 19 likewise we can observe that u 3 pgr e 3 3 20 u 3 pgr 2 se 3 3 21 and apply proposition 3 1 to find that u 3 lq cq e 3 lq 3 22 u 3 lq cq 2 se 3 lq 3 23 11 we will now finish the proof by applying the triangle inequality and concluding that e 3 lq 3 u u 3 lq 3 24 3 u lq u 3 lq 3 25 2 cq 2 se 3 lq 3 26 and that 2 se 3 lq 3 u u 3 lq 3 27 3 u lq u 3 lq 3 28 2 cq e 3 lq 3 29 this completes the proof proposition 3 2 implies that in the range 9 4 q 3 kukavica and ziane s regularity criterion on 3 u implies chae and choe s regularity criterion on e 3 because 3 u lq cq e 3 lq 3 30 likewise chemin zhang and zhang s regularity criterion on u 3 implies chae and choe s regularity criterion on e 3 when 4 p we can see this by applying the fractional sobolev embedding w 1 q r 3 h 1 2 2 p r 3 when 2 p 3 q 2 and proposition 3 2 to find u 3 h 1 2 2 p cq u 3 lq 3 31 c q e 3 lq 3 32 we will also note that theorem 1 6 differs in a fundamental way from the locally anisotropic regularity criterion proven by kukavica rusin and ziane in 11 this is true in particular because while 3 u lq r 3 cq e 3 lq r 3 3 33 no such inequality holds if we are not on the whole space for arbitrary u lq u 0 and arbitrary domains r 3 there is no inequality of the form 3 u lq cq e 3 lq 3 34 the proof of proposition 3 2 relies on the lq boundedness of the helmholtz decomoposition which in turn relies on the lq boundedness of the riesz transform this is something which only holds globally not locally because the riesz transform is a nonlocal operator e 3 controls 3 u globally in lq but not locally in lq this means that while kukavica and ziane s regularity criterion for 3 u l p tl q x r 3 implies chae and choe s regularity criterion for e 3 l p tl q x r 3 for 9 4 q 3 the local anisotropic regularity criterion with 3 u l p tl q x d and the locally anisotropic regularity criterion on v where v is allowed to vary do not have this same relationship finally we will note that when we set v theorem 1 6 requires that if our solution of the navier stokes equation blows up in finite time tmax then ess sup x t r 3 0 tmax x t 3 35 12 however as we discussed in the introduction beira o da veiga and berselli proved the stronger result that under these conditions tmax 0 t 4 l dt 3 36 for this reason it seems like it ought to be possible to relax the condition in theorem 1 6 from v l t l x to v l 4 tl x the methods used to prove theorem 1 6 would at first glance suggest this would be possible but the difficulty is that when integrating by parts we cannot get all of the derivatives off of u and onto v which is what leads to the sub optimal bound remark 3 3 suppose for all u h 1 u 0 v l v x 1 almost everywhere x r 3 we had a bound of the form u v u trv c r 3 u 2 v 2 3 37 c u 2 l 2 v 2 l 3 38 then using the energy inequality we could conclude that t 0 u v u trv 2 d c 2 t 0 u 4 l 2 v 4 l d 3 39 c 2 u 0 4 l 2 t 0 v 4 l d 3 40 and we could relax the requirement in theorem 1 6 to v l 4 tl x using precisely the same proof the difficulty is that as much as at first glance it would appear that an inequality of the form 3 37 should hold using integration by parts after multiple attempts to do so by the author it does not appear possible to push all the derivatives off of u and onto v in the manner desired the asymmetry from the transpose u tr does not seem to allow this it is definitely possible perhaps even likely that the condition can be relaxed to v l 4 tl x so that the interpolation between chae and choe s regularity criterion and beira o da veiga and berselli s will be optimal but it would require a fundamentally different proof because it will not follow as a
