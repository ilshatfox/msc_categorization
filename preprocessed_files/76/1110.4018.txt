of this article is to study the effect of the moisture on the planetary scale atmospheric circulation over the tropics the modeling we adopt is the boussinesq equations coupled with a diffusive equa tion of humidity and the humidity dependent heat source is modeled by a linear approximation of the humidity the rigorous mathematical analysis is carried out using the dynamic transition theory in particular we obtain the same types of transitions and hence the scenario of the el nin o mechanism as described in 10 11 the effect of the moisture only lowers slightly the magnitude of the critical

22 1 introduction this article is part of a research program to study low frequency variability of the atmospheric and oceanic flows as we know typical sources of climate low fre quency variability include the wind driven horizontal and thermohaline vertical circulations thc of the ocean and the el nin o southern oscillation enso their variability independently and interactively may play a significant role in climate change past and future the primary goal of our study is to document through careful theoretical and numerical studies the presence of climate low fre quency variability to verify the robustness of this variability s characteristics to changes in model parameters and to help explain its physical mechanisms the 1991 mathematics subject classification 35 j 60 35 b 33 the work of sw was supported in part by the us office of naval research and by the us national science foundation 1 http arxiv org abs 1110 4018 v 1 2 c hsia c s lin t ma and s wang thorough understanding of the variability is a challenging problem with important practical implications for geophysical efforts to quantify predictability analyze error growth in dynamical models and develop efficient forecast methods enso is one of the strongest interannual climate variability associated with strong atmosphere ocean coupling with significant impacts on global climate enso consists of warm events el nin o phase and cold events la nin a phase as observed by the equatorial eastern pacific sst anomalies which are associated with persistent weakening or strengthening in the trade winds see among others 1 4 5 12 13 20 21 14 3 18 19 15 6 17 an interesting current debate is whether enso is best modeled as a stochastic or chaotic system linear and noise forced or nonlinear oscillatory and unstable system 15 it is obvious that a careful fundamental level examination of the problem is crucial for this purpose ma and wang 10 initiated a study of enso from the dynamical transition point of view and derived in particular a new oscillation mechanism of the enso namely enso is a self organizing and self excitation system with two highly coupled os cillation processes the oscillation between metastable el nino and la nina and normal states and the spatiotemporal oscillation of the sea surface temperature sst the main objective of this article is to address the moisture effect on the low frequency variability associated with the enso first as our main purpose is to capture the patterns and general features of the large scale atmospheric circulation over the tropics it is appropriate to use the boussinesq equations coupled with a diffusive equation of humidity in addition the humidity effect is also taking into consideration by treating the heating source as a linear approximation of the humidity function second although the introduction of the humidity effect leads to substantial dif ficulty from the mathematical point of view we haver shown in theorem 4 1 that the humidity does not affect the type of dynamic transition the system undergoes namely we show that under the idealized boundary conditions only the continu ous transition type i occurs however the critical thermal rayleigh number is slightly smaller than that in the case without moisture factor to see this effect of the humidity we refer to formula 3 31 which reads rc 1 le 1 le 2 kc 24 1 th 2 le q 2 kc t r 4 kc r 20 k 2 2 kc 1 r 20 2 kc r 20 since in the expression of thermal critical rayleigh number rc the coefficient of the humidity rayleigh number r is negative and this indicates that the presence of humidity lowers down the critical temperature difference for the onset of the dynamic transition third we remark that the perturbation analysis in 10 can be applied to the case here to carry out the analysis and we can show that that under the natu ral boundary condition the underlying system with humidity effect will undergo a mixed type transition in addition as we argued in 10 it is necessary to in clude turbulent friction terms in the model to obtain correct convections scales for the large scale tropical atmospheric circulations leading in particular to the right critical temperature gradient and the length scale for the walker circulation tropical atmospheric circulations with humidity effects 3 finally based on these theoretical results it is easy then to conclude the same mechanism for enso as proposed in ma and wang namely enso is a self organizing and self excitation system with two highly coupled oscillatory processes 1 the oscillation between the two metastable warm el nino phase and cold events la nina phase and 2 the spatiotemporal oscillation of the sea surface tempera ture sst field the interplay between these two processes gives rises the climate variability associated with the enso leads to both the random and determinis tic features of the enso and defines a new natural feedback mechanism which drives the sporadic oscillation of the enso with the deterministic model consid ered in this article the randomness is closely related to the uncertainty fluctuations of the initial data between the narrow basins of attractions of the corresponding metastable events and the deterministic feature is represented by a deterministic coupled atmospheric and oceanic model predicting the basins of attraction and the sea surface temperature sst it is worth mentioning that as practiced by many in the field the randomness associated with the enso may be incorporated by introducing the noise directly in the model in addition from the predictability and prediction point of view it crucial to capture more detailed information on the delay feedback mechanism of the sst for this purpose the study of explicit multi scale coupling mechanism to the ocean is inevitable this article is organized as follows section 2 gives the objective boussinesq model with humidity the eigenvalue problem is analyzed in section 3 the transi tion theorem is stated and proved in section 4 in section 5 the turbulence friction factors are considered and the corresponding critical temperature difference and the wave numbers of walker circulation are checked 2 model for atmospheric motion with humidity 2 1 atmospheric circulation model the hydrodynamical equations governing the atmospheric circulation is the navier stokes equations with the coriolis force generated by the earth s rotation coupled with the first law of thermodynamics let r be the spheric coordinates where represents the longitude the latitude and r the radial coordinate the unknown functions include the velocity field u u u ur the temperature function t the humidity function q the pressure p and the density function then the equations governing the motion and states of the atmosphere consist of the momentum equation the continuity equation the first law of thermodynamic the diffusion equation for humidity and the equation of state for ideal gas which

follows 1 the gradient and divergence operators are given by 1 r cos 1 r r div u 1 r 2 r r 2 ur 1 r cos u cos 1 r cos u 2 in the spherical geometry although the laplacian for a scalar is different from the laplacian for a vectorial function we use the same notation for both of them u u 2 r 2 cos ur 2 sin r 2 cos 2 u u r 2 cos 2 u 2 r 2 ur u r 2 cos 2 2 sin r 2 cos 2 u ur 2 ur r 2 2 r 2 cos u

2 u 2 cos ur sin u sin u cos u here is the angular velocity vector of the earth and is the magnitude of the angular velocity the above system of equations were basically the equations used by l f richard son in his pioneering work 16 however they are in general too complicated to conduct theoretical analysis as practiced by the earlier researchers such as j char ney and from the lessons learned by the failure of richardson s pioneering work one tries to be satisfied with simplified models approximating the actual motions to a greater or less degree instead of attempting to deal with the atmosphere in all its complexity by starting with models incorporating only what are thought to be the most important of atmospheric influences and by gradually bringing in oth ers one is able to proceed inductively and thereby to avoid the pitfalls inevitably encountered when a great many poorly understood factors are introduced all at once the simplifications are usually done by taking into consideration of some main characterizations of the large scale atmosphere one such characterization is the small aspect ratio between the vertical and horizontal scales leading to hydro static equation replacing the vertical momentum equation the resulting system of equation are called the primitive equations pes see among others 7 the tropical atmospheric circulations with humidity effects 5 another characterization of the large scale motion is the fast rotation of the earth leading to the celebrated quasi geostrophic equations 2 2 2 tropical atmospheric circulation model in this article our main focus is on the formation and transitions of the general circulation patterns for this purpose the approximations we adopt involves the following components first we often use boussinesq assumption where the density is treated as a constant except in the buoyancy term and in the equation of state second because the air is generally not incompressible we do not use the equa tion of state for ideal gas rather we use the following empirical formula which can be regarded as the linear approximation of 2 5 2 6 0 1 t t t 0 q q q 0 where 0 is the density at t t 0 and q q 0 and t and q are the coefficients of thermal and humidity expansion third since the aspect ratio between the vertical scale and the horizontal scale is small the spheric shell the air occupies is treated as a product space s 2 a a a h with the product metric ds 2 a 2 d 2 a 2 sin 2 d 2 dz 2 this approximation is extensively adopted in geophysical fluid dynamics fourth the hydrodynamic equations governing the atmospheric circulation over the tropical zone are the navier stokes equations coupled with the first law of thermodynamics and the diffusion equation of the humidity these equations are restricted on the lower latitude region where the meridianal velocity component u is zero let z m 0 2 a a h be the coordinate where is the longitude a the radius of the earth and h the height of the troposphere the unknown functions include the velocity field u u uz the temperature function t the humidity function q and the pressure p then the equations governing the motion and states of the atmosphere read 2 7 u t u u u uz a u 2 a 2 uz u a 2 2 uz 1 0 a p uz t u uz u 2 a uz 2 a 2 u 2 uz a 2 2 u 1 0 p z g 1 t t t 0 q q q 0 t t u t t t q q t u q q q h 1 a u uz z 0 where is the earth s rotating angular velocity g the gravitational constant 0 the density of air at t t 0 the viscosity t and q are the coefficients of thermal and humidity expansion t and q the thermal and humidity diffusion coefficients and q h the heat and humidity sources however the differential operators used 6 c hsia c s lin t ma and s wang in 2 7 are as follows u u a uz z f 1 a 2 2 2 f 2 z 2 f u u e uzez
