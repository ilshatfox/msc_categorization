road cambridge cb 3 0 wa uk dated november 17 2021 propulsion at microscopic scales is often achieved through propagating traveling waves along hair like organelles called flagella taylor s two dimensional swimming sheet model is frequently used to provide insight into problems of flagellar propulsion we derive numerically the large amplitude waveform of the two dimensional swimming sheet

is a front back symmetric regularized cusp that is 25 more efficient than the optimal sine wave this optimal two dimensional shape is smooth qualitatively different from the kinked form of lighthill s optimal three dimensional flagellum not predicted by small amplitude theory and different from the smooth circular arc like shape of active elastic filaments i introduction the microscopic world is teeming with organisms and cells that must self propel through their fluid environ ment in order to survive or carry out their functions 1 at these very small scales viscous forces dominate inertia in fluid flows and a common method of overcoming the challenges of viscous propulsion through the fluid envi ronment is by propagating waves along slender hair like organelles called flagella or cilia 2 3 to examine the fluid mechanical basis for microscopic propulsion taylor 4 considered a simplified flagellum model comprising a two dimensional sheet exhibiting small amplitude travel ing waves this seminal work subsequently sparked the development of other techniques for examining newto nian viscous flows such as slender body theory 5 7 and resistive force theory 2 8 as well as other models for non newtonian swimming based on distribution of force singularities 9 10 due to its analytical tractability and agreement with more involved approaches in the small amplitude limit taylor s swimming sheet has been used to give insight into many fundamental problems in microscale propul sion such as hydrodynamic synchronization between waving flagella 4 11 13 swimming in non newtonian fluids 14 16 and swimming past deformable membranes 10 these approaches are typically characterized by asymptotic expansion of the flagellar waveform under the condition that the amplitude of the waves is small when compared to the wavelength recently taylor s small amplitude expansion was formally extended to arbitrar ily high order for a pure sine wave a method able to produce results comparable to full numerical simulations of large amplitude sine waves with the boundary element method 17 motivated by the role of evolutionary pressures on the shape and kinematics of swimming microorganisms electronic address e lauga damtp cam ac uk it is relevant to investigate which flagellar waveform is the most energetically efficient for the cell for an infinite flagellum lighthill 2 showed that in the local drag approximation of resistive force theory the hydrodynamically optimal flagellar waveform has a con stant tangent angle to the swimming direction this leads to the shape of a smooth helix in three dimen sions and a singular triangle wave in two dimensions whilst the helical waveform is commonly observed in bacterial flagella 18 19 unsurprisingly the kinked pla nar waveform is not spagnolie and lauga 20 showed that this shape singularity in lighthill s flagellum can be regularized by penalizing the swimming efficiency by the elastic energy required to bend a flagellum which might provide one explanation for its absence in nature this model was then improved upon by lauga and eloy 21 by proposing an energetic measure based on the internal molecular cost necessary to deform the active flagellum for finite length flagella pironneau and katz 22 showed that traveling waves are fundamental to optimal propul sion using resistive force theory they then analyzed op timal patterns for model spermatozoon exhibiting small amplitude planar sinusoidal waves and finite amplitude triangle waves the optimal stroke pattern of purcell s finite three link swimmer was found by tam and hosoi 23 who then went on to consider optimal gaits for the green alga chlamydomonas 24 while all past optimization work has focused on three dimensional slender filaments the optimal waveform of taylor s two dimensional swimming sheet has yet to be considered although the two dimensionality of the prob lem makes it less realistic as a model for swimming cells the fluid dynamics around a sheet can be computed very accurately allowing us to bypass various hydrodynamic modeling approximations employed in three dimensions in the present study we use the boundary element method to examine a sheet propagating large amplitude waves of arbitrary shape we derive computationally the waveform leading to swimming with maximum hydrody namic efficiency we show that the optimal waveform for the swimming sheet is a regularized cusp wave not ar x iv 1 40 6 10 70 v 1 ph ys ic s fl u dy n 4 j un 2 01 4 mailto e lauga damtp cam ac uk 2 wave propagation swimming direction 2 0 2 1 0 1 x y fig 1 a schematic of the wave propagation of a swimming sheet here illustrated by a single sine wave mode showing the computational domain to along the x axis direction of wave propagation in the swimming frame and direction of swimming predicted by small amplitude analysis the optimal is qualitatively different from three dimensional swimmers both the kinked triangle of lighthill s hydrodynamically optimal flagellum 2 and the circular arcs of internally optimal active filaments 21 and indicates a qualitative difference between two and three dimensional swimming at large amplitude ii formulation of the problem newtonian fluid mechanics at microscopic scales is gov erned by the incompressible stokes flow equations 2 u p u 0 1 where u is the fluid velocity field p the dynamic pres sure and is the dynamic viscosity hereafter non dimensionalized to 1 we consider the waving sheet model illustrated in fig 1 and assume the waveform to be fixed and to travel along the positive x direction at unit speed the infinite sheet is periodic over the interval 0 2 and swimming is expected to occur in the x direction opposite to the direction of propagation of the wave 4 since the sheet is infinite there is no extrinsic length scale to the prob lem and as such we hereafter non dimensionalise lengths using the reciprocal of the wavenumber k 1 in order for net swimming to take place with no rotation we require the wave to be odd about the axis x 0 i e ask that y 0 t y 0 t without loss of generality the waveform may therefore be described as a fourier sine series where the shape in the swimming frame is described by y x t with y x t p p 1 bp sin p x t 2 even modes for the shape b 2 q with q any integer are al ways obtained by our optimization algorithm to be zero indicating that optimal waveforms are front back sym metric waves the physical reason underlying this front back symmetry is unclear due to kinematic re versibility if the shape was asymmetric then an equally optimal waveform would be its front back mirror image and thus the optimization procedure would always lead to two symmetric solutions this is not the case and a unique front back symmetric shape is always obtained we thus consider a general waveform represented by y x t n n 1 bn sin 2 n 1 x t 3 and use our computational approach to derive the opti mal series of coefficients bn n n n for increasing n the lack of an extrinsic length scale to the infinite sheet means that our choice of first mode is in some sense ar bitrary and thus we will not consider solutions for which b 1 0 in order to define a fundamental period to the wave to derive the hydrodynamically optimal waveform we use the standard definition of swimming efficiency intro duced by lighthill 2 we therefore compare a useful rate of swimming u 2 to the rate of working of the sheet against the fluid w s u n ds where the fluid stress is pi u u t 2 s is the surface of the swimmer over one wavelength and n is the unit normal to the sheet into the fluid we thus seek the set of coefficients bn n that maximize the hydrodynamic efficiency e defined as e u 2 s u n ds 4 and numerically compute the value of the swimming speed u and surface stress n in order to impose velocity conditions on the surface of the sheet we solve the problem in a frame of reference that moves with the propagating wave since the sheet is stationary in this frame the velocity of material elements is purely tangential 2 by subtracting the normalized wave speed this allows us to retrieve the boundary con ditions everywhere along the sheet as u x q cos x 1 v q sin x 5 where q denotes the ratio between the arclength of the waveform in one wavelength to the wavelength measured along the x direction and x is the tangent angle of the sheet measured about the x axis both the value of q and the distribution of are functions of the wave geometry only and thus of the coefficients bn n iii computational approach in order to compute the flow field generated by the sheet and the resultant surface stresses we employ the boundary element method 25 with two dimensional pe riodic green s functions as in pozrikidis 26 and sauzade 3 et al 17 at any point x along the sheet the velocity at that point is given by the surface integral uj x 1 2 s sij x x fi x tijk x x ui x nk x ds x 6 where n x is the unit normal pointing into the fluid at x and fi ijnj using the notation r x the stokeslet tensor sij and stresslet tijk are given by sij x ij ln r x ix j r 2 tijk x 4 x ix j x k r 4 7 and represent the solution to stokes flow due to a point force in two dimensions and the corresponding stress re spectively since we are modeling an infinite 2 periodic sheet we have velocity contributions at x from an infinite sum of stokeslets and stresslets sp n i ln rn x nx n r 2 n tp n 4 x nx nx n r 4 n 8 where x n x x 2 n y y for singularities posi tioned at x these infinite sums may be conveniently expressed in a closed form as spxx a y y a 1 spyy a y y

by a minus sign from those found in sauzade et al 17 due to our adoption of the sign convention from pozrikidis 26 for the computational procedure the sheet is dis cretized into 500 straight line segments of constant force per unit length i e the components f 1 2 in equation 6 are constant over each straight line element this dis cretization breaks equation 6 into a sum of line integrals of singularities multiplied by the unknown force per unit length numerical evaluation of each non singular line in tegral is performed with four point gaussian quadrature whilst singular integrals are treated analytically this nu merical discretization produced a 0 02 relative differ ence in the calculated swimming velocity and efficiency for both kinked and unkinked example sheets when com pared to simulations with 600 and 800 elements with 8 and 16 point gaussian quadrature whilst still allowing calculation in a reasonable time by decoupling the nu merical quadrature from the force discretization com parable accuracy is achieved for relatively smaller linear systems 27 the computational mesh is refined locally around regions of high curvature appearing as a result of the optimization in order to resolve potential kinks and singular shapes using these parameters we find conver gence of the waveform and optimal efficiency for n 30 in order to reach this number of coefficients quickly it is important to provide a good starting guess for the coeffi cients bn at the beginning of the optimization procedure since we are interested in the convergence of our wave form with an increased number of points we numerically optimize for n 1 30 sequentially and use the con verged optimal coefficients for the n n 1 waveform as an initial guess for the n n waveform with bn initially set to zero in order to ensure that our solution represents the global maximum of the hydrodynamic effi ciency 4 multiple initial conditions were tried all found to be optimized to the same waveform optimization is carried out using the standard fminunc function in matlab using the quasi newton algorithm iv the shape of the optimal swimming sheet with this framework established we are able to com pute the shape of the optimal swimming sheet it is first instructive to ask what would be predicted from the analytical small amplitude approach in that case the waveform is written as y x t n 1 bne in x t 10 where is a small dimensionless amplitude to second order in the amplitude 4 the swimming speed u and work done against the fluid w are given by u n 1 n 2 bn 2 w n 1 n 3 bn 2 11 because the work done is proportional to n 3 whereas the swimming velocity is proportional to n 2 higher order modes are energetically penalized compared to lower modes therefore for a fixed amount of mechanical power expended by the swimmer it is more efficient to dis tribute all of that power to the first mode n 1 un der the small amplitude approximation the most efficient waveform is therefore a single sine wave of period 2 relaxing the small amplitude constraint we show in fig 2 a the optimal waveform obtained numerically for n 30 odd fourier modes the set of coefficients bn that describe this waveform are given in appendix a and a three dimensional sheet propagating this wave is fur ther shown in fig 2 b the optimal swimming sheet ap pears to take the shape of a regularized cusp wave qual itatively different from the single mode sine wave pre dicted by the asymptotic analysis we further plot in fig 2 c the distribution of slopes along the sheet show ing that the wave has an almost

amplitude theory 4 and lighthill s optimal triangle wave for a flagellum with drag anisotropy ratio of 1 2 2 2 we display in fig 2 d the distribution of curvature along the sheet while the curvature at the wave crest in creases it remains finite for comparison our predicted optimal waveform is plotted against the pure sine wave of small amplitude theory 4 and the triangle wave pre dicted by lighthill 2 in fig 2 e since our optimization procedure finds the optimal so lution for incremental values of the number of coefficients n used to describe the wave we can investigate conver gence of all optimal waveforms described by n ranging from 1 to 30 the convergence for the swimming effi ciency is shown in fig 3 a while the dependence of the maximum curvature on n is plotted in fig 3 b for n 30 the optimal waveform is over 25 more effi cient than the optimal one mode sine wave n 1 the swimming efficiency appears to reach its asymptote near n 13 which corresponds to the peak in the maximum curvature but thereafter continues to increase slightly before reaching its converged value of e 0 11065 this slight increase is accompanied by a decrease in the max imum curvature of the optimal waveforms for n 14 up to n 13 it appears that subsequent modes serve to steepen the waveform as it approaches around the crest such steepening is likely hydrodynamically favorable in two dimensions since fluid cannot pass around the sheet as it would around three dimensional flagellum how ever steepening results in a region of high curvature at the wave crest which induces locally high viscous dissipa tion in the fluid and so there appears to be an efficiency trade off between wave steepening and minimizing curva ture for n 14 the wavelength of the fourier modes is on the order of the length of the cap on the wave crest these modes are then able to decrease the maximum cur vature without decreasing the slope of the wave yielding small increases in efficiency until the curvature converges for n 30 we further display the convergence of the optimal waveform as a function of the number of coeffi cients n in fig 4 despite the decrease in maximum 5 e cicency 0 10 20 30 0

trade off between wave steepening and reducing curvature can be further investigated by examining a family of waves of the form bn c 1 n 1 2 n 1 m n 1 12 where c is a constant the value of m dictates the de cay of the fourier coefficients with the fourier mode and with the choice m 2 eq 12 leads to the triangular waveform of lighthill s optimal flagellum the choice of alternating sign is informed both by the series for the triangle wave and by the coefficients of our optimal so lution up to n 14 cusps are obtained for m 2 and rounded off waves for m 2 and by truncating the series at small

coefficients black dashed if a large enough number of odd modes n 50 is used to describe the curve the kink at the wave crest is sufficiently resolved as to no longer be regularized in this case the optimal jumps to an unkinked profile with which c 0 9173 and m 2 923 yielding an efficiency of just 0 0912 and demonstrating the detrimental effect of kinked waveforms on hydrodynamic efficiency when non local effects are taken into account the optimal within 6 this family is thus more efficient than any kinked wave furthermore this result suggests that by fully resolving the hydrodynamics around lighthill s optimal flagellum viscous dissipation associated with the kink might also regularize this waveform v discussion taylor s swimming sheet model is commonly used to address a range of phenomena in the biological physics of small scale locomotion a natural question to raise is the relevance of a two dimensional geometry to the three dimensional locomotion of flagellated cells in this paper we used the boundary element method to compute the swimming efficiency of arbitrary wave forms in two dimensions by focusing on the ques tion of optimal waveform for locomotion we show that the optimal two dimensional waveform is a regularized cusp which is about 25 more efficient than a sim ple sine wave this result is different from the three dimensional hydrodynamically optimal triangle wave de rived by lighthill 2 the slope of the straight section is shallower the waveform steepens towards the wave crest and there is no discontinuity in the slope but rather a regularized cusp the result is also different to the three dimensional internally optimal wave which is composed of circular arcs joined by straight lines 21 although it is know that the dynamics of a swimming sheet can provide qualitative insight into the hydrodynamics of small scale locomotion differences with three dimensional results ex ist therefore at large amplitude acknowledgements the authors would
