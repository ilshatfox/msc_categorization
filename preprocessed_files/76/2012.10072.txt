tsuji abstract a system of fluid dynamic type equations and their boundary conditions derived from a system of the boltzmann equation is of great importance in kinetic theory when we are concerned with the motion of a slightly rarefied gas it offers an efficient alternative to solving the boltzmann equation directly and more impor tantly provides a clear picture of the flow structure in the near continuum regime however the applicability of the existing slip flow theory is limited to the case where both the boundary shape and the kinetic boundary condition are smooth functions of the boundary coordinates which precludes for example the case where the kinetic boundary condition has a jump discontinuity in this paper we discuss the motion of a slightly rarefied gas caused by a discontinuous wall temperature in a simple two surface problem and illustrate how the existing theory can be extended the discussion is based on our recent paper taguchi and tsuji j fluid mech 897 a 16 2020 supported by some preliminary numerical results for the newly introduced kinetic boundary layer the knudsen zone from which a source sink condition for the flow velocity is derived 1 introduction let us consider a rarefied gas in contact with a smooth boundary or boundaries we are concerned with the steady behavior of the gas suppose that the molecular mean free path is small compared with the characteristic system size the knudsen number is small then it is often advantageous to solve the fluid dynamic system derived satoshi taguchi department of advanced mathematical

taguchi and tetsuro tsuji from the boltzmann system this approach is known as the generalized slip flow theory and was developed notably by sone and his coworkers 13 14 15 16 the generalized slip flow theory is based on the asymptotic analysis of the boltz mann system for small knudsen numbers both the boundary shape and the boundary condition need to be smooth this smoothness condition is required for the knudsen layer problem to be reduced to a half space problem of a kinetic equation in space one dimension from which the slip jump boundary conditions are obtained the smoothness condition can be however restrictive in some situations for example s t considered in 17 a rarefied gas flow around a sharp edge with different surface temperatures on each side but due to the limitation only a qualitative argument was possible for the flow structure around the edge motivated by this in this article we discuss the possibility to extend the generalized slip flow theory to the case where the boundary condition has a jump discontinuity in a simple two surface problem that is we consider a steady rarefied gas flow between two parallel plates with a discontinuous wall temperature in the framework of the generalized slip flow theory the discussion is based on our recent paper 18 with some new numerical result which supports the present theory finally we remark on the following in our problem to be stated next the bound ary condition has a jump discontinuity through the plate s temperature distribution this induces discontinuities of the velocity distribution function on the boundary and they propagate into the gas region this feature is important in a numerical analysis and was taken into account in 2 where a similar temperature driven flow has been considered see also 18 it is also considered in our numerical results shown in sect 5 although the numerical approach is different the propagation of boundary induced discontinuity in kinetic equations is also a mathematical concern and has been investigated in e g 1 9 6 7 8 2 problem and formulation 2 1 problem let be the reference length and let d 0 0 and 0 be the reference density temperature and pressure of the gas respectively we consider a monatomic rarefied gas occupying the space between two parallel plates located at g 1 c 2 and g 1 c 2 where g 1 g 2 g 3 is the cartesian coordinates as shown in fig 1 the upper halves of the plates g 2 0 are kept at temperature 0 1 gw while the lower halves g 2 0 at temperature 0 1 gw where gw is a constant henceforth we assume gw 0 therefore the surfaces temperature has a step like distribution which is discontinuous at g 2 0 with the jump 2 0 gw we also assume that the gas is subject to no pressure gradient nor external force we investigate the steady behavior of the gas under the following assumptions i the behavior of the gas is described by the boltzmann equation ii the gas molecules make diffuse reflection on the plates iii gw is so small that the equation and boundary conditions can be linearized around a generalized slip flow theory for a slightly rarefied gas flow 3 the reference equilibrium state at rest with density d 0 and temperature 0 iv the knudsen number defined by the molecular mean free path at the reference state divided by is small gas h o t c o ld fig 1 schematic of the problem a rarefied gas between two parallel plates located at g 1 c 2 with a step like temperature distribution is considered the temperature of the plates is discontinuous at g 2 0 2 2 formulation let us denote by 2 0 1 2 z 1 z 2 z 3 the molecular velocity is the specific gas constant and by d 0 2 0 3 2 1 q x the velocity distribution function where c 3 2 exp 2 the time independent boltzmann equation reads z 8 m 8 q 1 y q 1 where m 8 m mg 8 is the linearized collision operator 16 and y is a parameter defined by y c 2 kn c 2 0 kn knudsen number here 0 is the mean free path of the gas molecules in the equilibrium state at rest with temperature 0 and density d 0 note that y is the knudsen number multiplied by c 2 the operator is given by 4 satoshi taguchi and tetsuro tsuji e r 3 s 2 d e d 2 a 2 b e e e e 2 c e 1 c 3 2 4 2 2 d where d e is the solid angle element in the direction of e is a non negative function whose functional form is determined by the designated intermolecular force for example 1 4 2 c e for a hard sphere gas the diffuse reflection boundary conditions on the plates are summarized as q 2 c z 1 0 z 1 q d 2 2 gw z 1 0 g 1 c 2 g 2 0 3 a q 2 c z 1 0 z 1 q d 2 2 gw z 1 0 g 1 c 2 g 2 0 3 b where d dz 1 dz 2 dz 3 the macroscopic quantities of interest namely the density the flow velocity the temperature and the pressure of the gas denoted by d 0 1 l 2 0 1 2 d 8 0 1 g and 0 1 respectively are defined in terms of q as l q d 8 z 8 q g 2 3 2 3 2 q 2 3 2 q l g 4 where designates r 3 d 5 in the present two dimensional problem we may assume that q is independent of g 3 nevertheless the g 3 dependency has not been precluded in the above formulation for later convenience the study on the behavior of a slightly rarefied gas i e the gas with small knudsen numbers has a long history see e g references in 15 in the case of a smooth boundary sone and his coworkers have extensively studied the question both for the steady 13 14 15 16 and unsteady 16 19 settings it is based on the asymptotic analysis of the boltzmann system for small knudsen numbers and the theory is nowadays known as the generalized slip flow theory however the approach above precludes the discontinuous boundary data one of the paper s purposes is to show that we can extend sone s asymptotic theory to include the latter situation a generalized slip flow theory for a slightly rarefied gas flow 5 3 case of a smooth temperature distribution before we discuss the discontinuous surface temperature case it is useful to review the case of a smooth temperature distribution let the temperature of the two plates be given by 0 1 gw where gw is a smooth function of g 2 g 3 then assuming the diffuse reflection condition the boundary conditions 3 a and 3 b are replaced by q 2 c z 1 0 z 1 q d 2 2 gw z 1 0 g 1 c 2 g 2 g 3 6 we consider the asymptotic behavior of the solution q of the linear system 1 and 6 for small y following sone s method 15 16 it should be noted that for the linearization m 8 gw 1 should be assumed by the symmetry of the problem one can assume that the solution is even with respect to g 1 0 therefore in the sequel we consider the problem only in the left half domain g 1 g 2 g 3 c 2 g 1 0 g 2 g 3 the solution in the right half domain is obtained from that of by q g 1 g 2 g 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 q g 1 g 2 g 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 according to 15 the solution is expressed in the form q qh qk 7 where qh is called the hilbert solution and describes the overall behavior of the gas while qk is a correction to qh required in the vicinity of the boundary the knudsen layer correction more precisely qh is a solution to eq 1 subject to the condition m 8 qh qh i e moderately varying solution on the other hand qk is appreciable only in a thin layer the knudsen layer adjacent to the boundary g 1 c 2 whose thickness is of the order of y the knudsen layer correction qk is subject to the conditions m 1 qk qk y x 8 9 8 9 m 9 qk qk 8 where x 8 9 is kronecker s delta and n 1 0 0 the qh and qk are expanded in y as qh qh 0 yqh 1 y 2 qh 2 9 a qk yqk 1 y 2 qk 2 9 b accordingly the macroscopic quantities l d 8 g are also expressed as 6 satoshi taguchi and tetsuro tsuji h k 10 a h h 0 y h 1 y 2 h 2 10 b k y k 1 y 2 k 2

takes a special value and that the solution is unique 3 5 15 it has also been proved that the solution decays exponentially fast as suppose that the functions i 0 1 and i 1 8 8 1 2 are known then the func tional dependency of qh and qk on the molecular velocity is prescribed through these auxiliary functions and qeh on the other hand the spatial dependency enters through those of d 8 h x gh x and

notations used in 15 16 it should be noted that since we are seeking a solution that is symmetric with respect to g 1 0 the above system should be supplemented by an appropriate reflection condition at g 1 0 a similar comment applies throughout the paper and will not be repeated in the sequel solution procedure for a given gw the process to obtain the solution q to the order y is as follows 1 from eq 17 h 0 0 constant 2 solve eqs 18 a 18 c for 0 under the condition 19 a to obtain dh 0 h 1 and gh 0 note that h 1 is determined up to an additive constant say 1 compute lh 0 from eq 18 d with 0 the leading order solution qh 0 is derived from eq 13 a 3 solve eqs 18 a 18 c for 1 under the conditions 19 b and 19 c to obtain dh 1 h 2 and gh 1 note that h 2 is determined up to an additive constant say 2 compute lh 1 from eq 18 d with 1 the first order solution qh 1 qk 1 is obtained from eqs 13 b and 13 c in the above procedure h lh and qh are determined up to a common additive constant at each although d 8 h and gh are determined without such ambiguities a physical argument can single out a solution for example we can specify the gas pressure at a certain point in the domain or specify the average gas density in the whole domain another possibility to remove the ambiguity might be through a symmetry argument depending on gw as in the next section a generalized slip flow theory for a slightly rarefied gas flow 9 4 case of a discontinuous wall temperature now we return to the original problem again we assume that the solution is symmetric with respect to g 1 0 and

to obtain qhk 0 and qhk 1 we apply the solution algorithm given in the previous section step 1 the leading order pressure is h 0 0 constant we chose h 0 0 0 in view of the antisymmetry of the solution

discontinuous at g 1 g 2 c 2 0 this solution has the following drawbacks 1 the solution does not produce any non zero flow velocity which is not mean ingful note that a non uniform surface temperature of a body usually causes a rarefied gas flow such as the thermal creep this remains true even if the temperature distribution is piecewise uniform with a jump discontinuity 2 2 near the point g 1 g 2

dimensional analog of the thermal creep flow 12 10 11 and represents a reaction of a rarefied gas to a forced temperature variation in the gas we give further details on the derivation of 36 c in appendix 4 2 a source sink condition for the flow velocity let us assume that qz 0 is known including 1 i we consider a point in such that y a g 1 c 2 2 g 2 2 1 and consider the asymptotic behavior of

condition that provokes a non vanishing flow velocity in the stokes system as we will see later sect 5 1 i is likely to be a positive number thus a sink flow toward the discontinuity point appears in the region g 2 0 and a source flow in the region g 2 0 to summarize after the consideration of the knudsen zone step 3 should be replaced by step 3 the stokes problem for the first order in y is given

results for the knudsen zone problem to sim plify the numerical analysis we employ the bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator 4 20 instead of the boltzmann collision operator the linearized bgk collision operator is well known and its explicit form is omitted 16 figure 2 a shows the streamlines of the flow velocity d 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 and the perturbed tempera ture gz 0 in the upper half domain h 1 0 and h 2 0 here d 8 z 0 and gz 0 are defined by d 8 z 0 z 8 qz 0 8 1 2 gz 0 2 3 2 3 2 qz 0 44 note that the wall temperature is discontinuous at h 2 0 along h 1 0 the plates temperature is 0 1 gw for h 2 0 figure 2 b shows the flow velocity vector d 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 and its absolute value near the origin as seen from these figures a flow is induced in the positive h 2 direction which exhibits a diverging flow pattern in the region far from the origin note that by the antisymmetry it implies that there is a shrinking flow toward the origin in the region h 2 0 the flow speed is strongest near the discontinuity point and decreases as h 2 1 h 2 2 increases see fig 2 b in this way the flow field obtained by the numerical analysis of the bgk model clearly indicates the presence of a source sink flow pattern in the far field this becomes the source sink condition near the point of discontinuity when rescaled with the spatial variables g 8 and the limit y 0 is approached as discussed in the previous section a generalized slip flow theory for a slightly rarefied gas flow 15 fig 2 numerical results for the knudsen zone problem based on the linearized bgk colli sion operator a the thick gray curves with arrows show the streamlines of the flow velocity g 1 w d 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 and the dashed contours show the temperature gz 0 gw b a magnified figure near the origin the arrow indicates the flow velocity vector g 1 w d 1 z 0 d 2 z 0 at its starting point and the contours visualize the absolute value 6 discussions we have considered a slightly rarefied gas confined between two parallel plates whose common temperature distribution has a jump discontinuity along them in the case of a smooth temperature distribution without the jump discontinuity the hilbert expansion and the knudsen layer correction yield a practical tool i e the stokes system to investigate a thermally driven flow between the two plates sect 3 on the other hand the case of the discontinuous surface temperature cannot be handled solely by the hilbert solution and the knudsen layer correction indeed the term qhk 1 can grow indefinitely near the point of discontinuity which disproves the validity of the hk solution there sect 4 given this observation we have introduced the knudsen zone near the point g 1 g 2 c 2 0 in which the solution is allowed to undergo an abrupt spatial variation in both g 1 and g 2 directions the knudsen zone is described by the system 36 which is a half space problem for the linearized boltzmann equation in two space dimensions in this problem the constant 1 i occurring in the far field asymptotic property 36 c is essential from the macroscopic view points indeed 1 i is inherited to the source sink condition 42 c in the stokes system and plays a role to induce a non zero flow velocity d 8 h 1 in this sense 1 i is of equal importance as the viscosity or the slip jump coefficients finally let us make a brief comment on the global flow structure when y is small since the zeroth order flow velocity d 8 h 0 is identically zero the overall flow vanishes as y tends to zero except in the knudsen zone in the knudsen zone the nonzero flow of the order gw 1 is induced as seen from fig 2 and remains 16 satoshi taguchi and tetsuro tsuji however the knudsen zone shrinks to g 1 g 2 c 2 0 with the decrease of y therefore the strong flow of gw 1 is gradually localized near g 1 g 2 c 2 0 as y becomes smaller the localized flow affects the global flow at the order y through the source sink condition for d 8 h 1 and induces an overall flow with the magnitude gw y in this way a global flow of the order gw y is established as a result of the piecewise uniform temperature distribution of the plates the present analysis successfully provides a clear picture of the flow structure which is also consistent with the picture inferred in 2 acknowledgements the present work was supported by jsps kakenhi grant no 17 k 06146 appendix in this appendix we briefly explain the derivation of the condition 36 c our stating point is the asymptotic behaviors of the leading order hk solution qhk qhk 0 qh 0 near g 1 g 2 c 2 0 i e qhk 0 2 gw c 2 5 2 a 2 a 1 arctan g 2 g 1 c 2 45 this suggests that the leading order term of qz is of the form qz 0 2 gw c 2 5 2 as y h 1 0 arctan h 2 h 1 46 thus the problem for qz 0 consists of 36 a 36 b and 46 we regard this problem as a kind of scattering problem and seek a solution with the following asymptotic property 18 qz 0 2 gw 1 i y za sin 2 2 gw c 2 5 2 2 0 1 sin y 2 gw c z y 1 h 2 i 0 1 h 1 z 1 as y 47 where 1 i is a
