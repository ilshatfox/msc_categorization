jungho park and shouhong wang the main objective of this addendum to the mentioned article 49 by park is to provide some remarks on bifurcation theories for nonlinear par tial differential equations pde and their applications to fluid dynamics problems we only wish to comment and list some related literatures with out any intention to provide a complete survey for steady state pde bifurcation problems the often used classical bifur cation methods include 1 the lyapunov schmidt procedure which reduces the pde problem to a finite dimensional algebraic system 2 the kras noselskii theorem for bifurcations crossing an eigenvalue of odd algebraic multiciplicity 28 3 the krasnoselskii theorem for potential operators 4 the rabinowitz global bifurcation theorem 51 5 crandall and rabi nowitz theorem for bifurcations crossing a simple eigenvalue 11 and 6 bifurcation from higher order terms regardless of the multiplicity of the eigenvalues 31 32 we also refer the interested readers to among many others 47 8 20 21 35 42 for more comprehensive discussions nirenberg have a beautiful survey paper 46 on topological and variational methods for nonlinear problems which has influenced a whole generation of nonlinear analysts the hopf bifurcation also called poincare andronov hopf bifurcation was independently studied and discovered by andronov in 1929 and hopf in 1942 and poincare in 1892 for ordinary differential equations in partic ular in his paper 24 hopf also indicated the possible application of the hopf bifurcation theorem to bifurcation of time periodic solutions for the navier stokes equations the hopf bifurcation was generalized to infinite dimensional setting for pdes by crandall and rabinowitz 12 marsden and mccracken 44 and henry 23 we mention in particular the last two

applications see among many others d sattinger 53 54 55 56 m golubitsky i stewart and d schaeffer 20 21 and m field 14 recently ma and wang have developed a bifurcation theory for nonlinear pdes 36 33 this bifurcation theory is centered at a new notion of bifur cation called attractor bifurcation for nonlinear evolution equations and is synthesized in two recent books by ma and wang 35 42 furthermore this new bifurcation theory has been further developed by ma and wang into a complete new dynamic transition theory for nonlinear problems see two recent books by ma and wang 42 40 and the references therein for a more detailed account of the theory these new theories has been used in many problems in sciences and engineering including the be nard con vection problem and the taylor problem in the classical fluid dynamics doubly diffusive convections and rotating boussinesq equations in geophys ical fluid dynamics many phase transition problems in statistical physics biology and chemistry see 30 34 38 35 42 40 and the references therein a b cd e f g h figure 1 a bifurcated attractor containing 4 nodes the points a b c and d 4 saddles the points e f g h and orbits connecting these 8 points the main purpose of this new bifurcation theory is to study transitions of one state to another in nonlinear problems we illustrate the concept by a simple example for x x 1 x 2 r 2 the system x x x 31 x 32 bifurcates from x 0 0 to an attractor s 1 this bifurcated attractor is as shown in figure 1 and contains exactly 4 nodes the points a b c and d 4 saddles the points e f g h and orbits connecting these 8 points from the physical transition point of view as crosses 0 the new state after the system undergoes a transition is represented by the rayleigh be nard convection 3 whole bifurcated attractor rather than any of the steady states or any of the connecting orbits note that the global attractor is the 2 d region enclosed by we point out here that the bifurcated attractor is different from the study on global attractors of a dissipative dynamical system both finite and infinite dimensional global attractor studies the global long time dynamics see among others 15 1 9 10 while the bifurcated attractor provides a natural object for studying dynamical transitions 35 42 40 now we return to the rayleigh be nard convection problem this is clas sical problem in fluid dynamics the study for this problem on the one hand plays an important role in understanding the turbulent behavior of fluid flows and on the other hand often leads to new insights and methods toward solutions of other problems in sciences and engineering linear theory of the rayleigh be nard problem were essentially derived by physicists see among others chandrasekhar 3 and drazin and reid 13 bifurcating solutions of the nonlinear problem were first constructed for mally by malkus and veronis 43 the first rigorous proofs of the existence of bifurcating solutions were given by yudovich 59 60 and rabinowitz 50 yudovich proved the existence of bifurcating solutions by a topological degree argument earlier however velte 58 had proved the existence of branching solutions of the taylor problem by a topological degree argument as well the application of group theoretic bifurcation theory to the be nard convection are explored in last thirties years or so by many authors to the best knowledge of authors sattinger s papers 52 53 55 are the first ones to use the group theoretic point of view to study this problem in combina tion with the lyapunov schmidt reduction procedure then group theoretic methods are used in conjunction with center manifold reduction and lead ing to the amplitude equations to fluid problems by among others m golubitsky i stewart and d schaeffer 21 chossat and his collaborators 6 7 iooss and his collaborators 25 57 and the references therein we would like also to mention the hopf bifurcation result obtained by chen and price 4 where they use the continued fractions method first introduced by meshalkin and sinai 45 recently ma and wang have used their newly de veloped attractor bifurcation theory mentioned earlier to study the be nard convection problem in 33 they proved that the rayleigh be nard prob lem bifurcates from the basic state to an attractor ar when the rayleigh number r crosses the first critical rayleigh number rc for all physically sound boundary conditions regardless of the geometry of the domain and the multiplicity of the eigenvalue rc for the linear problem furthermore detailed characterization of solutions in the bifurcated attractor ar in both the physical and the phase spaces for special geometries of the domain is given in 41 also the bifurcated attractor ar attracts any bounded set in h where h is the whole phase space and is the stable manifold of the basic solution finally we would like to point out that the bifurcation and stability analysis discussed in this and the above mentioned articles 4 ma park and wang are for viscous flows and we refer to friedlander and yudovich 17 and friedlander strauss and vishik 16 and the references therein for details the work presented in park 48 49 is an application of the aforemen tioned new attractor bifurcation theory to the infinite prandtl number be nard convection here are some specific comments on the results in these articles and some further developments first the results obtained are motivated by the attractor bifurcation theory 35 and the geometric theory for incompressible flows 37 both de veloped recently by ma and wang 35 without the new insights from these theories one does not come up with the theorems proved in 48 49 and in other related articles as evidenced by the fact that no such theorems have been stated in the vast existing literature on the rayleigh be nard convec tion second the types of solutions in this s 1 attractor depend on the bound ary conditions with the periodic boundary condition in the x 1 direction in this article the bifurcated attractor consists of only steady states in fact when the boundary conditions for the velocity field are free slip boundary conditions and the spatial domain is 0 l 2 0 1 with 0 l 2 2 3 2 3 2 1 ma and wang 41 40 prove that the bifurcated attractor is still an s 1 consisting of exactly eight singular steady states with four saddles and four minimal attractors and eight heteroclinic orbits connecting these steady states the bifurcated attractor and its detailed classification provide a global dynamic transition in both the physical and phase spaces furthermore again in a more general three dimensional 3 d domain 0 l 1 0 l 2 0 1 with doubly periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions and the free boundary conditions on the top and bottom it is proved 40 that the bifurcated attractor is either r s 5 if l 2 k 2 1 l 1 for k 2 3 or else r s 3 it is clear that these bi furcated attractors contains many more solutions than the solutions derived by any group theoretic methods hence we iterate here that the method and ideas developed by ma and wang are crucial to obtain these results which can not be obtained using only the classical bifurcation theories for the case studied in this article the classical bifurcation theory with symmetry arguments implies that the bifurcated attractor contains a circle of steady states we need however the new bifurcated theory to prove in particular that the bifurcated attractors are exactly an s 1 furthermore it is also much obvious as partially indicated that the 3 d results can not be derived by group theoretic methods in addition for general boundary conditions such as the free slip boundary conditions mentioned above no symmetry can be used and the classical amplitude equation methods fails to derive the dynamics rayleigh be nard convection 5 in short although group theoretic bifurcation methods are useful in dif ferent problems the need for other more general methods is obvious and inevitable as suggested by among others d sattinger 53 55 one of the pioneers of the group theoretic bifurcation methods and b gru nbaun 22 third it is proved in 33 41 48 49 that the bifurcated attractor in the be nard convection problem attracts any bounded set in h where h is the whole phase space and is the stable manifold of the basic solution to the best of the knowledge of authors this global stability result can not be derived from any existing methods it is obtained by using a new stability result proved by ma and wang 33 which is derived using a combination of energy estimates and topological arguments as kirchga ssner indicated in 27 an ideal stability theorem would in clude all physically meaningful perturbations and establish the local stability of a selected class of stationary solutions and today we are still far from this goal on the other hand fluid flows are normally time dependent there fore bifurcation analysis for steady state problems provides in general only partial answers to the problem and is not enough for solving the stability problem hence it appears that the right notion of asymptotic stability af ter the first bifurcation should be best described by the attractor near but excluding the trivial state it is one of our main motivations for introducing attractor bifurcation theory and the dynamic transition theory 35 42 40 fourth the geometric theory for incompressible flows recently developed by ma and wang 37 is crucial for the structure and its stability of the solutions in the physical spaces obtained in the main theorems in 49 also we note that a special structure with rolls separated by a cross channel flow derived in 41 has not been rigorously examined in the be nard convection setting although it has been observed in other physical contexts such as the branstator kushnir waves in the atmospheric dynamics 2 29 for completeness we mention that this geometric theory for incompress ible flows consists of research in two steps 1 the study of the structure and its transitions evolutions of divergence free vector fields and 2 the study of the structure and its transitions of velocity fields for 2 d incompressible fluid flows governed by the navier stokes equations or the euler equations the original motivation of this research program was to understand the dynamics of the ocean currents in the physical space and it turns out that there is a much richer new mathematical theory with more applications than the original motivation from the oceanography among other results for example the theory leads to a rigorous characterization of boundary layer separation on when where and how the separation occurs and to make connections between the time and location of the separation see ghil ma and wang 18 19 ma and wang 37 and the references therein this is a long standing problem in fluid mechanics going back to the pioneering work of prandtl 1904 see also chorin and marsden 5 and ja ger lax and morawetz 26 6 ma park and wang with this characterization of the boundary layer separation in our dis posal ma and wang 39 are able to derive a rigorous characterization of the boundary layer and interior separations in the taylor couette poiseuille flow the results obtained provide a rigorous characterization on how when and where the propagating taylor vortices ptv are generated in particu lar contrary to what is commonly believed it is shown that the ptv do not appear after the first dynamical bifurcation and they appear only when the taylor number is further increased to cross another critical value so that a structural bifurcation occurs this structural bifurcation corresponds to the boundary layer and interior separations of the flow structure in the physical space references 1 a
