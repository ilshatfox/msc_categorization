siddhartha sahi and charles torossian abstract consider the kontsevich product on the symmetric alge bra of a finite dimensional lie algebra g regarded as the algebra of dis tributions with support 0 on g in this paper we extend this product to distributions satisfying an appropriate support condition as a con sequence we prove a long standing conjecture of kashiwara vergne on the convolution of germs of invariant distributions on the lie group g 0 introduction in several problems in harmonic analysis on lie groups one needs to re late invariant distributions on a lie group g to invariant distributions on its lie algebra g for instance it is a central aspect in harish chandra s work in the semi simple case the symmetric algebra s g and the envelop ing algebra u g can be regarded as convolution algebras of distributions supported at o in g and 1 in g respectively therefore the harish chan dra isomorphism between the ring of invariants in s g and u g can be seen in this light at a more profound level harish chandra s regularity result for invariant eigendistributions on the group involves the lifting of the corresponding result on the lie algebra using the orbit method of kirillov duflo defined an isomorphism extend ing the harish chandra homomorphism to the case of general lie groups d 1 d 2 d 3 this result was crucial in the proof of local solvability of invariant differential operators on lie groups established by ra s ra 1 for nilpotent groups then by duflo and ra s dr for solvable groups and finally by duflo d 3 in the general case soon thereafter kashiwara and vergne kv conjectured that a natural extension of the duflo isomorphism to germs of distributions on g when restricted to invariant germs with appropriate support should carry the convolution on g to the convolution on g they proved this conjecture for solvable groups and showed that in general their conjecture implies the local solvability result mentioned above see also an observation of ra s in ra 2 the research of the first author was supported by cnrs ep 1755 the research of the second author was supported by an nsf grant the research of the third author was supported by cnrs umr 8553 1 http arxiv org abs math 0104100 v 1 2 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian apart from the special case of sl 2 r considered by rouvie re rou 1 the kashiwara vergne conjecture resisted all attempts until 1999 when it was established for arbitrary groups but under the restriction that one of the distributions have point support ads 2 ads 1 this suffices for many applications including the local solvability result mentioned above around the same time vergne v proved the conjecture for arbitrary germs but for a special class of lie algebras the quadratic lie algebras those admitting an invariant non degenerate quadratic form in this paper we prove the kashiwara vergne conjecture in full generality using as in ads 2 the kontsevich quantization of the dual of a lie algebra let us now outline the result and our method let g be a lie group with lie algebra g and exp g g the exponential map let q be the analytic function on g defined by q x det eadx 2 e adx 2 adx 1 2 1 define for a distribution u on g u exp u q 2 where exp is the pushforward of distributions under the exponential map we consider germs at 0 of distributions on g henceforth simply germs for distributions u v the corresponding germs will be denoted u v we use the same notation for the induced map on germs we wish to consider the convolution of germs this notion is well defined under a certain asymptotic support condition which we now describe if u is a subset of rn one defines the asymptotic cone of u at x rn as the set cx u of limit points of all sequences an xn x 3 for all sequences xn x and all sequences an r clearly cx u depends only on the intersction of u with an arbitrarily small neighborhood of x if m is a manifold and x m u m using a coordinate chart one can once again define cx u as a cone in the tangent space txm let u be a distribution on g then c 0 suppu depends only on the germ u and we will write it as c 0 u assume that u v are germs such that c 0 u c 0 v 0 4 when two germs verify 4 we will say that they are compatible in this case the abelian convolution on the lie algebra u g v is well defined as a germ on g also using the campbell hausdorff formula it is easy to see that the lie group convolution u g v is well defined as the germ at 1 of a distribution on the group g the lie algebra g acts on functions on g by adjoint vector fields the dual action descends to germs we call a germ invariant if it is annihilated by all elements of the lie algebra our main theorem is invariant distributions 3 theorem 0 1 kashiwara vergne conjecture assume that u and v are com patible invariant germs then u g v u g v 5 as in kv one can reformulate the conjecture slightly by considering for t r the lie group gt with lie algebra gt where gt is g as a vector space equipped with the lie bracket x y t t x y 6 the function q x must then be changed to qt x q tx and accordingly to t let u and v be compatible germs on g u and v distributions with small compact support representing u and v and a smooth function we can define t u v t 1 t t u gt t v 7 as a function of t r clearly 0 u g v and 1 1 u g v the kashiwara vergne conjecture is implied by and in fact equivalent to the statement that for u and v invariant germs and for all with sufficiently small support depending on u and v the function u v is constant using the campbell hausdorff formula it can be verified that is a differentiable function of t thus it suffices to show that for u and v invariant t 0 for all t 8 in their paper kv kashiwara and vergne formulate a combinatorial con jecture on the campbell hausdorff formula which implies the vanishing of t it is this combinatorial conjecture which is proven in various special cases in the papers mentioned above kv rou 1 v however it remains unproven in general our approach is diferent we first show that if u and v are invariant then t is analytic in t thus it suffices to prove that n 0 0 for all n 9 while at first this may not seem to be an easier problem however in this paper we relate the group convolution to an extension of the kontsevich product to distributions and prove an equivalent statement concerning the product we now recall the construction of kontsevich in ko an associative product is defined on any poisson manifold given by a formal series in a parameter u v n n bn u v 10 where u v are c functions on the manifold and bn u v are certain bi differential operators 4 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian consider g the dual of g equipped with its natural poisson structure it is easy to see that when u v are in s g i e polynomial functions on g the formula for u v is locally finite so that one can set 1 and then u 1 v is again in s g now regarding u and v as distributions supported at 0 on g 1 can be considered as a new convolution on g but defined only for distributions with point support at 0 the product is closely related to the multiplication in the universal enveloping algebra u g which in turn is simply the group convolution g for distributions supported at 1 in g indeed by the universal property of u g there exists an isomorphism between s g 1 and u g g kontsevich shows that this isomorphism is given explicitly in the form u s g 7 u 1 11 here was defined in ko as a formal power series s 1 x but was shown in ads 2 to be an analytic function in a neighborhood of 0 in g 1 more generally setting equal to a real number t we deduce that u 7 t u 1 t 12 is an isomorphism from s g t to u g gt this implies the identity 1 t t u gt t v u t t v t 1 t 13 for u v distributions on g supported at 0 our first main result proved in section 3 is the following theorem 0 2 the kontsevich product on s g extends to a convolu tion product u v 7 u t v 14 for u and v distributions on g with sufficiently small support near 0 more over formula 13 continues to hold in section 4 we prove theorem 0 3 the extended product descends to a product on compatible germs also denoted t if u and v are compatible invariant germs then u t v is invariant furthermore u t t v t u g v t 15 the proof of 15 requires the analyticity of t together with an exten sion of the kontsevich homotopy argument from ads 2 clearly theorems 0 3 and 0 2 imply theorem 0 1 acknowledgements part of this research was conducted during a visit by s s as professeur invite to the versailles mathematics department umr cnrs 8100 and subsequently during an nsf supported visit by m a to the rutgers mathematics department 1 a recent preprint of shoikhet s shows that in fact 1 we have not used this result in our paper its incorporation would simplify some of the statements but not the proofs invariant distributions 5 1 preliminaries let g be a finite dimensional real lie group with lie algebra g and fix a basis ei 1 i d of g 1 1 symmetric algebras here we work with the lie algebra g and its dual but they are considered as vector spaces the symmetric algebra s g can be considered in three different ways as the algebra r g of polynomial functions on g as the algebra of constant coefficient differential operators on g if p s g we write p for the corresponding differential operator for example for p g p is the constant vector field defined by p finally as the algebra for convolution of distributions on g with sup port 0 by the map p 7 dp where dp p 0 for a test function on g up to some powers of i d coincides with the fourier transform from functions on g to distributions on g when there is no ambiguity we drop d and use the same notation for an element of s g as a polynomial function on g and as a distribution on g we will then use or g for the product in s g depending on how we view elements of s g the symmetric algebra s g has similar interpretations 1 2 algebra of differential operators let w g the weyl algebra of differential operators with polynomial coefficients on g any element inw g can be uniquely written as a sum qi pi with qi s g and pi s g in other words we have a vector space isomorphism from s g s g to w g the inverse map associates to a differential operator in w g its symbol in s g s g the symbol can be viewed as a polynomial map from g to s g we observe that an element of w g is completely determined by its action on s g similarly any element in w g can be written as a sum i pi qi with pi s g and qi s g by duality with test functions the set of distributions d g on g is a right w g module d l d l where c c g d d g l w g one can define a canonical anti isomorphism the fourier transform f from w g to w g such that f pi qi qi pi for pi s g and qi s g it verifies dl p dp f l 16 for any l w g p s g 6 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian 1 3 multi differential operators letwm g be the set ofm differential operators with polynomial coefficients on g these are linear combinations of operators from c g m to c g of the form f 1 fm 7 p q 1 f 1 qm fm 17 where p s g and qi s g there is an obvious linear isomorphism written a s g m s g 7 a w m g its inverse maps a m differential operator b to its symbol b a symbol will often be viewed as a polynomial map from gm to s g for multidifferential operators there is no symmetry similar to the one given by the fourier transform f from w g to w g nevertheless in the case of bi differential operators for any b p q 1 q 2 w 2 g we define an operator f b mapping functions on g to functions on g g f b f x y q 1 x q 2 y p f x y 18 by duality we get a right action on pairs of distributions on g in the following way u v f b u q 1 g v q 2 p 19 where u v are distributions on g g is the convolution on g and it is assumed that the convolution makes sense we then have a formula similar to 16 db f g df dg f b 20 note that a bi differential operator with polynomial coefficients is completely determined by its action on point distributions 1 4 enveloping algebra the enveloping algebra u u g of g can be seen as the algebra of left invariant differential operators on g multiplica tion being composition of differential operators as the algebra of distribu tions on g with support 1 multiplication being convolution of distributions depending on the situation we will write or g the product in u g it is well known and can be easily seen that the symmetrization map from s g to u g can be interpreted as the pushforward of distributions from the lie algebra to the lie group by the exponential map for all p s g p exp p note that there is no jacobian involved here 1 5 poisson structure as is well known the dual g of g is a poisson manifold for f g functions on g the poisson bracket is f g 1 2 df dg 21 for g where df dg g are identified with elements of g using the given basis ei of g and the corresponding structure constants ei ej c k ijek 22 invariant distributions 7 we use the einstein convention of summing repeated indices we write j for the partial derivatives with respect to the dual basis e j of ei we get the following formula for the poisson bracket f g f g 1 2 ckij k i f j g 23 said otherwise the corresponding poisson tensor is ij 1 2 ckij k 2 general facts about the kontsevich construction of a product 2 1 admissible graphs consider for every integers n 1 and m 1 a set gn m of labeled oriented graphs with n m vertices 1 n are the vertices of first kind 1 m are the vertices of second kind here labeled means that the edges are labeled we will actually use these graphs here mostly for m 1 resp 2 in those cases the vertices of second type will be namedm resp l r the set of vertices of is denoted v the set of vertices of the first kind v 1 and the set of edges e for e a b e we write a a e and b b e for graphs in gn m we assume that for any edge e a e is a vertex of the first kind b e 6 a e and for every vertex a 1 n the set of edges starting at a has 2 elements written e 1 a e 2 a finally we assume that there are no double edges as usual a root of an oriented graph is a vertex which is the end point of no edge and a leaf is a vertex which is the beginning point of no edge 2 2 multidifferential operators associated to graphs letx be a real vector space of dimension d with a chosen basis v 1 vd the vector field vj on x is denoted j we fix a c bi vector field i j 1 d ij i j on x 2 2 1 differential operators let gn 1 we define a differential operator d by the formula d i l n k 1 e e b e k i e i e 1 k i e 2 k e e b e m i e 24 where l is the set of maps from e to 1 d taggings of edges one should think of this operator in the following way for each tagging of edges put at each vertex the coefficient ij corresponding to the tags of the edges originating at and put at m whatever is at a given vertex 1 n or m should be differentiated according to the edges ending at that vertex 8 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian 2 2 2 bi and multi differential operators consider a graph gn 2 de fine a bi differential operator b by the formula 25 b f g i l n k 1 e e b e k i e i e 1 k i e 2 k e e b e l i e f e e b e r i e g the bi differential operator b has a similar interpretation as d put at each vertex of the first kind the coefficient ij put at l the function f and at r the function g differentiate whatever is at some vertex according to the labels of the edges ending at that vertex and finally multiply everything for graphs in gn m by a straightforward generalization of 25 one defines m differential operators with the same interpretation as before 2 3 lie algebra case 2 3 1 relevant graphs assume that the vector space x g and that the bi vector field is the poisson bracket so that ij ij 1 2 ckij k since we use only this bi vector field we shall drop from the notation because of the linearity of the bi vector field associated with the poisson bracket for the graphs gn m for which there exists a vertex of the first kind with at least two edges ending at b 0 we will call relevant the graphs which have at most one edge ending at any vertex of the first kind since we are dealing exclusively with the lie algebra case we will henceforth change our notation slightly and use the notation gn m for the set of relevant graphs 2 3 2 action on distributions let gn 2 and let us interpret graphi cally the operator f b acting on pairs of distributions u v on g as in 25 the action is defined as a sum over all taggings of edges of termes ob tained in the following way put u and v at vertices l and r put at any vertex of the first kind the distribution d ei ej where i j are the tags of the edges originating at that vertex any vertex tagged by gives a multiplica tion by function e of the distribution sitting at the end point of that vertex and finally one takes the convolution of the distributions at all vertices 2 4 the kontsevich product kontsevich defines a certain compacti fication c n m of the configuration space of n points z 1 zn in the poincare upper half space with zi 6 zj for i 6 j and m points y 1 y 2 ym in r up to the action of the az b group for a r and b r to each graph is associated a weight w which is an integral of somme differential form on c n m let x rd with a poisson structure considered as a bi vector field let a c x the corresponding poisson algebra a product on a is an invariant distributions 9 associative r bilinear product on a given by a formula of the type f g 7 f g fg b 1 f g 1 2 2 b 2 f g 1 n nbn f g 26 where bj are bi differential operators and such that f g g f 2 f g 27 modulo terms in 2 the kontsevich product is given by formulas bn f g gn 2 w b f g 28 note that each bn being a finite sum is a bi differential operator 2 4 1 setting 1 as is explained in ads 2 one can set 1 or for that matter t for any t r in the kontsevich formula in the lie algebra case indeed for fixed f g s g of degrees p q respectively the terms b f g 0 for n p q so that the sum 26 actually involves a finite number of terms this operation is written rather than 1 replace the lie algebra g by gt for t r or t a formal variable as in 6 is is easy to check that the kontsevich product 1 for the lie algebra gt at 1 coincides with t 3 an extension of the kontsevich product 3 1 the symbol of the product we consider here the product as a formal bidifferential operator i e as an element of w 2 g it has a symbol a which belongs to s g s g s g we will view a a x y as a polynomial map of x y g g into s g and prove some properties of a recall that for gn 2 is the symbol of the corresponding bi diffferential operator b let n gn 2 w 29 we have for x y g a x y n n n x y 30 we will describe a factorization of a x y in proposition 3 7 below we first need to have a careful inspection of various graphs and their symbols 3 1 1 wheels we say that a graph gn m contains a wheel of length p if there is a finite sequence 1 p 1 n with p 2 such that 1 2 p 1 p p 1 are edges and there are no other edges begin ning at one of the k and ending at another k the graph is a wheel if p n 10 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian 3 1 2 simple components let gn m consider the graph whose vertices are 1 n and whose edges are those edges e e such that b e 1 m let i i i be the connected components of the corresponding simple components i are the graphs whose edges are the edges of i and the edges of beginning at a vertex of i and whose vertices are the vertices of i and 1 m it is easy to see that any simple component of a graph in gn m can be identified to a graph in gn m for n n in this situation we use the notation i i 31 and more generally if and are sub graphs whose simple components determine a partition of the i we write 32 a simple graph is a graph with only one simple component 3 1 3 symbols we now give rules to compute the symbol of the operator attached to a graph gn m they are recorded as a series of lemmas whose easy proofs are left to the reader lemma 3 1 let gn 2 with r roots the symbol is of total degree n 2 r of partial degree r for the s g components we call this degree the polynomial degree and of partial degree n r for the s g s g component the differential degree lemma 3 2 let gn m assume that there exists a sub graph 0 with p leaves 1 p such that each leaf j is the end point of one edge is the union of 0 and of p sub graphs 1 p each j has a single root j then 0 1 p 33 lemma 3 3 if gn n is a wheel of length n then x 1 xn tr adx 1 adxn 34 lemma 3 4 the symbol associated to the graph g 1 2 whose edges are 1 1 and 1 2 is the map x y g g 7 1 2 x y invariant distributions 11 lemma 3 5 let gn m there exist two subgraphs 1 and 2 possibly empty with 1 having wheels and no roots and 2 having roots and no wheels such that 1 2 the decomposition is unique up to labelling of vertices lemma 3 6 let gn m and assume that then 3 1 4 decomposition of a let us consider the following two subsets of gn m gwn 2 gn 2 with no roots grn 2 gn 2 with no wheels and consider the two following symbols aw x y n n n gw n 2 x y ar x y n n n gr n 2 x y proposition 3 7 1 as an s g valued map on g g aw is scalar valued 2 the symbol a x y decomposes as a product a x y a w x y ar x y proof 1 by lemma 3 1 the symbol of a graph with no roots has polynomial degree 0 this proves the first assertion 2 by lemma 3 5 any graph is 1 2 1 with no roots 2 with no wheels it is easy to see from the definition that the weights are multiplica tive w w 1 w 2 the only things that remain to be considered are the n factors when one looks at a decomposition 1 2 it is unique only up to labelling which explains the factors n n 1 for x y g let z x y be their campbell hausdorff series writing z z 1 we have z x y 1 z x y 35 it is well known that the campbell hausdorff series z x y converges for x y small enough therefore for any h 0 there exists such that for x y the power series in z converges normally for t 0 the following is due to v kathotia ka theorem 5 0 2 proposition 3 8 ar x y ez x y x y as a consequence for x and y small enough the formal series ar converges for 1 12 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian proposition 3 9 considered as an s g valued function on g g aw x y is a convergent series in a neigborhood of 0 0 moreover aw x y exp a w x y where a w is the contribution to the series corresponding to graphs with exactly one wheel proof by an argument similar to the one in the proof of proposition 3 7 one proves that aw x y exp a w x y we now need to prove convergence of the series a w x y and by ho mogeneity one can set 1 without loss of generality one can assume that the structure constants ckij 2 therefore 1 2 p tr ad ei 1 ad ei 2 ad eip d p and more generally 1 2 p tr ad z 1 ad z 2 ad zk d p with zj lie monomial in ei of degree pj and pj p let gwn 2 with only one wheel of length p n if the absolute values of all components xi yj of x y respectively are less than r x y r ndndn rnd 2 n 36 besides the following inequalities can be found in ads 2 lemma 2 2 and 2 3 w 4 n gn 2 8 e nn finally the terms of the series in a w 1 x y can be bounded by 32 e nrnd 2 n which proves convergence for r small enough 3 2 a formula for the product proposition 3 10 let t r let u v s g and u t v their product considered as distributions on g then u t v is given by the formula u t v u v a w t zt 37 for a test function on g in this proposition we are of course looking at the fourier transform of t see 20 meaning that we are actually expressing du tv in terms of du dv but we avoid using these cumbersome notations see also abm for a similar integral formula proof since for fixed u v the series for u v is finite we can substitute to a real number t and interchange summation with the test function distribution bracket u t v u x v y at x y x y 38 invariant distributions 13 and we avoid convergence problems for a fixed t by taking a test function with small enough support we know that at x y a w t x y a r t x y and awt x y is scalar valued proposition 3 7 so at x y x y awt x y art x y x y by 3 8 a r t x y e zt x y x y and by taylor s formula for polynomials art x y x y x y zt x y x y zt x y 39 the proposition follows 3 3 an extension of the kontsevich product in this paragraph we use formula 37 to define the product of distributions with small enough compact support and we prove that the definition agrees with the original one for distributions with point support proposition and definition 3 11 let t be a fixed real number then for all distributions u and v on g with sufficiently small support the formula 37 7 u t v u v a w t x y zt x y defines a distribution u t v on g proof let ku and kv be the supports of u and v assume that ku and kv are included in a ball or radius assume that 2 is less than the radius of convergence of at x y it is clear that 37 makes sense we need to prove that the functional t defined therein is a distribution since x y 7 zt x y is analytic from g g to g the pushforward of the compactly supported distribution u v under zt is a distribution but u t v is obtained by multiplying this distribution by the analytic function atw so it is a distribution by proposition 3 10 we see that definition 3 11 extends the product this proves the first statement of theorem 0 2 3 4 a connection between the product and group convolution two elements of s g r g play a crucial role in this situation q x det g eadx 2 e adx 2 adx 1 2 x exp n wn 2 n tr adx n where wn is the weight corresponding to the graph with one wheel of order n it is clear by definition that q x is analytic on g and it is proven in ads 2 that x is analytic in a neighborhood of 0 see also the footnote in the introduction consider the infinite order constant coefficient differential operator with symbol note that is denoted it in ko similarly q written ist in ko is well defined 14 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian as in ko we write ialg for the isomorphism from u g g to s g coming from 27 and the universal property of u g recall that is the symmetrization map ipbw in ko by ko these four maps are related by the following i 1 alg q 40 when we consider elements in s g and u g as distributions and q should be replaced by multiplication operators so that 40 is equivalent to i 1 alg p p q 1 41 and as mentioned before is interpreted as the direct image of distributions under the exponential map we therefore have the identity 13 1 t t u gt t v u t t v t 1 t for u v distributions on g supported at 0 the following proposition will finish the proof of theorem 0 2 proposition 3 12 1 the scalar valued function aw is given by aw x y r x r y r z x y where r q 1 42 2 let u v be distributions on g with small enough compact support the identity 13 1 t t u gt t v u t t v t 1 t holds proof 1 let u v s g the convolution ur g vr is given by ur g vr ur vr expz 43 for a test function on g since ialg is an algebra homomorphism by 40 we get u v r ur g vr 44 therefore applying 37 we get for any distributions u v with support 0 u v aw r z expz ur vr expz 45 fix a neighborhood of 0 in g g on which aw x y is defined assume that exp z x y 1 on that neighborhood we have u v aw r z u v r r 46 since this equality holds for any u and v supported at 0 this implies that the two functions aw x y r z x y and r x r y have same derivatives at 0 0 since they are analytic they must be equal 2 the second statement follows immediately from 43 42 and 37 we will prove now one last property about the extended product re lating it directly to graphs invariant distributions 15 proposition 3 13 let u v be two distributions with small enough compact support on g the following holds dn dtn t 0 u t v gn 2 u v f b 47 before giving the proof let us observe that we fall short from proving that u t v is analytic in t for u v general however we will prove such a result for u v invariant in section 4 proof for u v be two distributions on g with small support and a test function on g let us define cn u v dn dtn t 0 u t v 48 by inspection cn is a bi differential operator with polynomial coefficient acting on distributions for distributions u v s g we know that cn u v gn 2 u v f b 49 now bi differential operators with polynomial coefficients are completely determined by their action on distributions with point support this proves that cn gn 2 f b 50 4 proof of theorem 0 3 4 1 convolution on the level of germs the first step is to transfer the results of section 3 to germs we will begin by giving a few definitions 4 1 1 germs recall that the germ at 0 resp at 1 of a distribution u on g resp g is the equivalence class of u for the equivalence relation u 1 u 2 if and only if there exists a neighborhood c of 0 resp 1 such that for any test function on g resp g with support in c u 1 u 2 clearly for any distribution u and any given neighborhhod of 0 resp 1 there exists a distribution with support in defining the same germ at 0 as u 4 1 2 action of g on germs from the action of g on g by conjugation resp the adjoint action on g we get an action of g on functions and distributions on g resp g for g g and u a distribution we write ug for the image of u under g we get therefore an infinitesimal action of g on functions and distributions on g which is exactly the action by adjoint vector fields adjx for x g it is straightforward to see that these actions go down to germs 16 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian 4 1 3 invariant germs invariant germs are defined as germs u such that u a 0 for all a g by taking a basis of g it is easy to see lemma 4 1 a germ u is invariant if and only if for any distribution u representing u there exists an open neighborhood of 0 such that for any supported in and any a g u a 0 51 4 1 4 the compatibility condition for u a germ on g recall we have defined c 0 u as the cone c 0 suppu for any u representing u two germs u v are compatible if c 0 u c 0 v 0 52 4 1 5 proof of the first statement of theorem 0 3 we need to prove that the product descends to germs the analogous statements about the con volutions on g and on g are made in kv by formula 13 we deduce it for u v 4 2 invariant germs in order to finish the proof of theorem 0 3 we need to have very precise statements about the choice of representatives of invariant germs that we will work with this is what we do in this paragraph we choose some norm on g and write b 0 r for the open ball of center 0 and radius r for us open cones mean cones containing 0 with open cross section lemma 4 2 1 let u be a germ for any open cone d containing c 0 u there exists a representative of u with support in d 2 let u v be compatible germs there exist open cones d 0 u c 0 u d 0 v c 0 v such that d 0 u d 0 v 0 53 proof the second statement is easy we prove the first let u 1 be any representative of u by definition of c 0 u there exists 0 such that suppu 1 b 0 d let be a c function supported in b 0 which is identically equal to 1 in b 0 2 clearly u u 1 is a representative of u with support included in d 0 u for 0 we write d 0 u d 0 u b 0 the following lemma is crucial for our purposes lemma 4 3 let u v be compatible germs and d 0 u d 0 v open cones as in lemma 4 2 there exists a 0 such that for any 0 there exists 0 satisfying supp zt d 0 u d 0 v b 0 b 0 54 for all smooth with support in b 0 invariant distributions 17 proof we study the restriction of zt x y to d 0 u d 0 v the campbell hausdorff formula implies that there exists a positive number 1 such that the g valued map t x y 7 zt x y is analytic for t 1 x 1 y 1 furthermore zt x 0 0 zt y 0 0 i 55 therefore the implicit equation zt x y 0 can be solved there exists a constant 2 1 and an analytic map x t 7 zt x defined for t 1 1 and x 2 such that zt x y 0 is equivalent to y zt x for x 2 y 2 now since zt x 0 i and d u is an open cone we conclude that there exists 2 such that for x d 0 u and any t 1 1 zt x d 0 u finally we have proven that for x y with norms less than x d 0 u y d 0 v zt x y 0 implies x y 0 using a straightforward topological argument we get 0 0 x d 0 u y d 0 v t 1 1 zt x y implies x y 56 assume that is a test function supported in b 0 then by 56 supp zt d 0 u d 0 v is included in b 0 b 0 as we wanted we can now make the following precise statement about the choice of rep resentatives of germs proposition 4 4 let u v be compatible germs and d 0 u d 0 v open cones as in lemma 4 2 there exists a positive real such that for any t 1 1 the germ at 0 of u tv does not depend on the choice of u resp v distribution supported in d 0 u resp d 0 v representing u resp v this implies that the germ of u v is independent of the choice of d 0 u d 0 v proof let u v be compatible germs and u 1 v 1 u 2 v 2 two pairs of rep resentatives by formula 37 since the multiplication factor awt does not play a role it is enough to prove that for any t 1 1 the formula u 1 v 1 zt u 2 v 2 zt 57 provided the supports of ui vi are adequate assume that u 1 u 2 resp v 1 v 2 are supported in d 0 u resp d 0 v since u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 there exists such that for any test function with support included in the ball b 0 u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 58 using 54 we deduce 57 for supported in b 0 18 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian proposition 4 5 let u v be two compatible invariant germs the germ u t v is invariant proof it is enough to do it for t 1 we consider from proposition 4 4 as before we chose representatives u v of u v supported in d 0 u and d 0 v respectively since the germs are invariant there exists a such that for any test function supported in b 0 u a v a 0 59 for all a g applying again lemma 4 3 consider a test function sup ported in b 0 we prove that u v a u v a 0 for all a g indeed since the functions q are invariant it is enough to prove u v a z 0 60 using the covariance of z x y under the adjoint action of g g g z x y z g x g y writing g exp ta and differentiating at t 0 we get a z a 1 1 a z 61 thus we get u v a z u a v z u v a z by lemma 4 3 supp z d 0 u d 0 v b 0 b 0 now we use 59 to conclude 4 3 end of proof of theorem 0 3 as before we consider two compat ible invariant germs u and v and take representatives u v of u v we shall prove the equivalence of distributions u t t v t u g v t 62 for u and v adequately chosen it clearly will imply theorem 0 3 it is enough to prove that for any arbitrary test function with sufficiently small support u t t v t u g v t 63 considering both sides as functions of t we will prove that they are analytic in t and that their derivatives at 0 at any order are equal invariant distributions 19 4 3 1 analyticity we will derive the required analyticity result by extend ing some arguments of rouvie re from rou 2 rou 3 for the reader s con venience we summarize below the results that we need from these papers rouvie re defines an analytic function e x y on g g and a family of maps t depending smoothly on t 0 1 from g g to g g with the following properties 0 i for all t t 0 0 0 0 and t is a local diffeomorphism at 0 0 if g g g is the addition map then 1 t zt for a smooth function g on g g define gt ftg 1 t where ft x y q tx q ty q tx ty e tx ty 1 rouvie re proves t gt tr g adx x gtft ady y gtgt 64 where ft and gt are certain smooth functions on g g and all differentials are taken at x y since the differential operators on the right can be expressed in terms of adjoint vector fields rouvie re uses this to conclude that for invariant distributions u and v u v t gt 0 whence u v g 0 u v g 1 65 if now is a smooth function on g applying this result to g x y e x y q x q y x y and pairing with uq and vq we obtain u v e uq vq q 1 z 66 rewriting this we get u v e 1 u g v 67 lemma 4 6 let u v be two compatible invariant germs d 0 u d 0 v cho sen as in lemma 4 2 and from 54 let u v be representatives which verify the conditions of proposition 4 4 there exists a positive number such that for any test function supported in b 0 u t t v t 68 is an analytic function of t in a neighborhood of 0 1 note that this lemma implies that the function u v t considered in the introduction is analytic 20 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian proof the first step is to prove that 67 holds under the assumptions of the lemma provided has small enough support we proceed as in proposition 4 5 from the invariance of u v we have a constant such that u a v a 0 69 for all a g and any supported in b 0 we derive from lemma 4 3 let have support in b 0 in rouvie re s proof which was just outlined above the distribution u v is paired with the function gt and some derivatives of gt since 1 t zt we can write gt kt zt where kt is some smooth function therefore the support of gt and any derivative is included in the support of zt by 54 wee see that supp gt d 0 u d 0 v 70 is included in b 0 b 0 since we are pairing with u v with u v verifying 69 we still conclude as in rouvie re that u v gt is independent of t so that 65 and 67 still hold now we apply 67 but to the algebra gt note that this t is not the same as the t used before using 13 since the e function for gt is given by et x y e tx ty see rou 2 proposition 3 14 we derive u t t v t u x v y e tx ty tx ty x y 71 using the fact that e q are analytic in a neighborhood of 0 we conclude from 71 that u t v is analytic for t 1 1 the analyticity of the right hand side of 63 being immediate it now remains to prove the equality of derivatives of both sides of 63 at 0 to all orders 4 3 2 cancellation lemma 4 7 there exists a bidifferential operator mn w 2 g such that u v f mn dn dtn t 0 u t t v t u g v t 72 for u v distributions with compact support proof let p be the differential of at 0 of order p evaluated at the p tuple x x it follows from proposition 3 13 that the right hand side of the lemma is p q r n n p q r u p v q br u g v n 73 where br gr 2 b invariant distributions 21 clearly this expression is the fourier transform of a bidifferential operator with polynomial coefficients we now define a certain subset j of w 2 g considering the natural surjective map c from w g w g to w 2 g given by p 1 q 1 p 2 q 2 7 p 1 p 2 q 1 q 2 for pi s g qi s g let b c d 1 d 2 then u v f b u f d 1 v f d 2 74 let now i be the left ideal in w g generated by adjoint vector fields we define j c i w g w g i 75 we now establish lemma 4 8 for any b j and u v as in proposition 4 5 u v f b 0 76 proof by symmetry it is enough to prove that for b c d 1 a d 2 with a an adjoint vector field d 1 w g d 2 w g u v f b 0 77 but u v f b u a v c d 1 d 2 78 since the support c d 1 d 2 is included in the support of we can now apply proposition 4 5 to conclude the proof of theorem 0 3 we need to prove that mn belongs to j we adapt the proof of theorem 0 3 of ads 2 which relies on an argument of homotopy we use the notations of ads 2 as a consequence of stokes formula one can express u v 7 u v f mn 79 as a weighted sum of bi differential operators b for gn 2 with weights w zn 80 where zn is some subset of the boundary of the compactification c n 2 0 and is a differential form among the configurations 1 to 4 of ads 2 proof of theorem 0 3 we only need to consider the two following configurations the other cases being adressed in exactly the same way as in ads 2 two point clusters of type 1 correspond to a bi differential operator of the form c i w g two point clusters of type 2 1 correspond to a bi differential operator of the form c w g i this finishes the proof of theorem 0 3 22 martin andler siddhartha sahi and charles torossian references ads
