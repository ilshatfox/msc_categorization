theorem and applications by raul gomez doctor of philosophy in mathematics university of california san diego 2011 professor nolan wallach chair let g be a simple lie group with finite center and let k g be a maximal compact subgroup we say that g is a lie group of tube type if g k is a her mitian symmetric space of tube type for such a lie group g we can find a parabolic subgroup p man with given langlands decomposition such that n is abelian and n admits a generic character with compact stabilizer we will call any parabolic subgroup p satisfying this properties a siegel parabolic let v be an admissible smooth fr chet representation of a lie group of tube type g and let p g be a siegel parabolic subgroup if is a generic character of n let wh v v c n v n v be the space of bessel models of v after describing the classification of all the simple lie groups of tube type we will give a characterization of the space of bessel models of an induced representation as a corollary of this characterization we obtain a local multiplicity one theorem for the space of bessel models of an irreducible representation of g as an application of this results we calculate the bessel plancherel measure of a lie group of tube type l 2 n g where is a generic character of n then we use howe s theory of dual pairs to show that the plancherel measure of the space l 2 o p r q s o p q is the pullback under the lift of the bessel plancherel measure l 2 n sp m r where m r s and is a generic character that depends on r and s xi xii introduction in the classical theory of modular forms there is a construction that associates to every cusp form f on the upper half plane h an l function l s f n 0 an ns this l function is related to other objects of interest in number theory like elliptic curves over number fields and its study is of critical importance in a wide range of applications the l function l s f can also be constructed using a representation theoretic point of view by considering the space of whittaker models of a discrete series representation of sl 2 r associated with the modular form f if we also include mass forms then we can extend this construction to include all types of representations of sl 2 r this point of view has been incredibly successful and has given rise to an intricate and beautiful theory of l functions associated to automorphic representations of gl n unfortunately this theory has not been as successful with other groups like gsp n part of the problem is that not all automorphic representations of gsp n admit a whittaker model in 21 siegel developed a technique analogous to the theory of modular forms to construct l functions associated with holomorphic representations of sp n r 25 in this construction the space of whittaker mod els is replaced by the space of generalized bessel models wh v v c n v n v for all n n where p man is a siegel parabolic subgroup of sp n r with given langlands decomposition and is a generic character of n i e the p orbit of on n is 1 2 open this construction has been adapted by novodvorsky and piatetski shapiro 15 to construct l functions associated to automorphic representations of gsp 4 the study of the space of generalized bessel models is the subject of the first chapter of this thesis in order to describe the results obtained in that chapter we need to introduce a little bit of notation let g be a simple lie group with finite center and let k be a maximal compact subgroup we say that g is a lie group of tube type if k g is a hermitian symmetric space of tube type in section 1 2 we use the correspondence between euclidean simple jordan algebras over r and simple hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type to describe a classification of the simple lie groups of tube type as a consequence of this classification we have the following proposition proposition 0 0 1 if g is a lie group of tube type then 1 there exists a parabolic subgroup p man with given langlands decom position such that n is abelian 2 there exists a unitary character on n such that its stabilizer in m m m m m 1 nm n n n is compact if p g is a parabolic subgroup satisfying 1 and 2 then we say that p is a siegel parabolic subgroup let g be a lie group of tube type and let p man be a siegel parabolic sub group with given langlands decomposition let v be an admissible smooth fr chet representation of m and let a c a lie a define i g v f is smooth and f n amk a m f k for all n n a a and m m here is half the sum of the roots associated to the p pair p a 23 and p man is the parabolic opposite to p if we set g f x f xg for all f i x g g then i defines and admissible smooth fr chet representation of g let wh i i c n f n f for all n n 3 be the space of generalized bessel models for a generic character n this space has been subject of careful study during recent years in the real case the more general results can be found in 22 where a multiplicity one result is proved in the case where p man is a very nice parabolic subgroup 26 and v is finite dimensional representation of m in this context multiplicity one means that dimwh i dimv 0 1 in 2007 dipendra prasad asked if a similar result was true in the case where v is an admissible smooth frechet moderate growth representation of m in this case the statement about dimensions in equation 0 1 has to be replaced by an m intertwiner isomorphism between v and wh i where m m m mnm 1 n for all n n let i be the representation smoothly induced from km k m to k given f i define f namk a m f k the map f 7 f defines a k equivariant linear isomorphism from i to i consider the integrals j f n n 1 f n dn these integrals are called generalized jacquet integrals and converge absolutely and uniformly on compacta for re 0 22 let v and define j observe that if re 0 then defines a weakly holomorphic map into i theorem 0 0 2 assume that m is compact i extends to a weakly holomorphic map from a c to i ii given a c define f f f i then wh i and the map 7 defines an m equivariant iso morphism between v and wh i 4 when m is not compact the above theorem as it is stated is false this is mainly due to the fact that the orbits of the symmetric space x m m under the action of a minimal parabolic subgroup of m are much more complicated than in the case where m is compact 14 however something can still be said about wh i assume that the center of m is compact and let v be an irreducible admissible tempered infinite dimensional representation of m as in the case were m is compact define j and observe that if re 0 then defines a weakly holomorphic map into hom i v let wh i i v mn f n m f m m n n theorem 0 0 3 with assumptions as above i extends to a weakly holomorphic map from a c to hom i v ii given a c define f f f i then wh i and the map 7 defines a linear isomorphism between homm v v and wh i we will now describe an application of the results given so far let l 2 n g f g c f ng n f g and n g f g 2 dng we will call this the space of generalized bessel functions observe that there is a natural action of m g on this space with g acting on the right and m acting on the left in chapter 2 we compute the bessel plancherel measure i e the spectral decomposition of the space of generalized bessel functions with respect to this action the calculations are based on the work of wallach described in 24 and depend on theorem 0 0 2 and 0 0 3 the main result of that chapter is theorem 0 0 4 let g be a lie group of tube type and let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup of g with given langlands decomposition let be a generic 5 unitary character of n and let m be its stabilizer in m then the spectral decomposition of l 2 n g with respect to the action of m g is given by l 2 n g g m w d d where w is some multiplicity space is the usual plancherel measure of g and is the plancherel measure of m furthermore if m is compact then w wh is finite dimensional given an irreducible unitary representation h let h be the associ ated contragradient representation then in chapter 2 we also have the following theorem theorem 0 0 5 let g be a lie group of tube type and let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup with given langlands decomposition let be the set of open p orbits in n if is a generic character of n let o be its associated p orbit in n then for almost all irreducible tempered representations v of g p o m w ind p m n d here the spaces w are the same as the ones appearing in the spectral decom position of l 2 n g let g be a reductive group and let x be a g spherical variety in 20 sakel laridis and venkatesh give a conjecture describing the spectral decomposition of l 2 x in terms of the representation theory of another group this conjecture generalizes the results of harish chandra for l 2 g and of delorme schlichtkrull and van den ban for l 2 x where x is a symmetric space 3 4 5 6 more precisely the sakellaridis venkatesh conjecture postulates the existence of a group gx and a correspondence g x g between the unitary duals of gx and g such that l 2 x g x m d 6 where is the plancherel measure of gx and m is some multiplicity space whose dimension is finite and typically 1 if x satisfies some technical hypoth esis then the group gx has the property that its dual group is g x the dual group associated to x by gaitsgory and nadler 7 and hence the conjecture fits nicely into the setting of a proposed relative langlands program 19 using the theory of dual pairs of the oscillator representation to construct the map howe 9 parameterized the spectral decompositions of the space l 2 o p 1 q o p q in terms of the unitary dual of sl 2 r following the same ideas it s possible to obtain examples in the spirit of the sakellaridis venkatesh conjecture but that lie beyond the spherical variety case for example consider the dual pair sp m r o p q sp mn r p q n and assume that p q m the last condition states that we are in the stable case to simplify the exposition assume also that n is even the n odd case is very similar but involves a double cover of sp m r let p man be the siegel parabolic subgroup of sp m r with given langlands decomposition and let r s r s m be the character of n given by r s im x im tr ir sx where ir s ir is and is some fixed nontrivial unitary character of r let l 2 n sp m r r s f sp m r c f ng r s n f g and n sp m r f g 2 dng observe that ma gl m r in a natural way and m r s o r s in this setting theorem 0 0 4 says that l 2 n sp m r r s sp m r o r s w r s d d 0 2 where is the plancherel measure of o r s and is the plancherel measure of sp m r moreover by theorem 0 0 5 we have that for almost all tempered 7 representation of sp m r p r s m o r s w r s ind p o r s n r s d 0 3 on the other hand howe showed that in the stable range the oscillator represen tation l 2 rmn of sp mn r decomposes in the following way when restricted to sp m r o p q l 2 rmn sp m r d 0 4 where is the plancherel measure of sp m r and is a representation of o p q called the lift of a lot of work has been done to describe the explicit correspondence and in the stable range this correspondence can be described using the work of jian shu li 12 among others using equations 0 2 0 3 0 4 and the explicit formulas for the action of sp m r o p q on l 2 rmn given in 1 17 18 16 we obtain the following description of l 2 o p r q s o p q theorem 0 0 6 as an o r s o p q module with o r s acting on the left and o p q acting on the right l 2 o p r q s o p q sp m r o r s w r s d d where and are the plancherel measures of o r s and sp m r respectively and w r s are the multiplicity spaces appearing in equation 0 3 observe that when m 1 we regain howe s result 9 also observe that in this case the decomposition given in equation 0 2 is contained in wallach s work on the plancherel whittaker measure for minimal parabolic subgroups 24 chapter 1 bessel models for representations of lie groups of tube type 1 1 siegel modular forms on the upper half plane let h z x iy c y 0 denote the complex upper half plane for each integer k 0 we will consider the space of holomorphic functions f h c such that f az b cz d cz d kf z 1 1 for all integers a b c d such that ad bc 1 observe that this condition implies that f z 1 f z for all z h and hence we have a fourier series expansion f z n z anq n 1 2 where q e 2 iz we say that f is a modular form of weight k if an 0 for all n 0 if in addition to this conditions we have that a 0 0 then we say that f is a cusp form given a cusp form f of weight k we can define a dirichlet series l s f n 0 an ns where the an are the fourier coefficients appearing in the expansion of f 1 2 observe that this dirichlet series defines a holomorphic function for re s 0 8 9 moreover it can be shown that l s f has meromorphic continuation to all of c and that it satisfies a functional equation the l functions constructed this way are related to other objects of interest in number theory like elliptic curves over the rational numbers via the modularity theorem and its study is of central importance in a wide range of applications the numbers an appearing in this construction have a beautiful representation theoretic interpretation that we will now describe given a holomorphic function f on h and an element g sl 2 r define f kg z cz d kf az b cz d g a b c d this equation defines a right action of sl 2 r on the space of holomorphic func tions on h given a modular form f of weight k define a function on sl 2 r by g f kg i it is then clear using equation 1 1 that c sl 2 r where sl 2 z furthermore it can be shown that if k cos sin sin cos so 2 then gk eik g let u g be the universal enveloping algebra of g lie sl 2 r and set vk u g then it can be shown that vk is isomorphic to the space of so 2 r finite vectors of a discrete series representation h of sl 2 r with lowest weight k let v h be the space of smooth vectors of h then for each n z there is a natural choice of a linear functional n v c such that n 1 x 1 v e 2 inx v this family of linear functionals has the property that n an for all n z 10 the theory of maass forms extends this theory to include all types of unitary representations of sl 2 r the analogous functionals n are called following jacquet whittaker functionals corresponding to the unitary character n of n given by n 1 x 0 1 e 2 inx we will now move to the siegel upper half plane hm consisting of elements z x iy with x and y symmetric m m matrices over r and y positive definite let g sp m r realized as the set of 2 m 2 m matrices with block form g a b c d with a b c d m m matrices such that if j 0 i i 0 with i the m m identity matrix then gjgt j observe that we can define an action of g on hm by linear fractional transforma tions g z az b cz d 1 in this case c l siegel 21 considered subgroups of finite index ingz sp m z and holomorphic functions f on hm such that with g in block form as above f gz det cz d k f z for g and a growth condition at as above one has the subgroup n consisting of the elements of the form n l i l 0 i 11 with l anm m symmetric matrix over r observe that n contains a subgroup of finite index in nz gz n we will assume just as we did in the classical case that n is actually equal to nz then f z l f z for l an m m symmetric matrix with entries in z we can thus expand this siegel modular form in a fourier series ase 2 itr sz where the sum runs over the m m symmetric matrices s over z one finds that if as 6 0 then s must be positive semi definite once again this coefficients have a beautiful representation theoretic interpre tation we can consider s n x e 2 itr sx with s a symmetric m m matrix over r let m be the image of gl m r in g via the embedding g 7 g 0 0 gt then p mn is the siegel parabolic subgroup of g and we have an action of m on n and hence in its space of characters n by conjugation one finds that if a character is generic that is the m orbit in the character group is open then the character must be given by s with dets 6 0 the stabilizer of the character is compact if only if s is positive or negative definite if v is an irreducible representation of sp m r we will set wh s v v c n l v s n l v if the stabilizer of the character s is compact we will call any element wh s v a bessel model if s is just a generic character then we will call any wh s v a generalized bessel model one can show c f w 5 that the only such models for holomorphic resp antiholomorphic representations are those corresponding to positive definite resp negative definite such s thus 12 the only generic characters that can appear if we consider holomorphic or anti holomorphic siegel modular forms are the ones with compact stabilizer and the relevant space here is the space of bessel models of holomorphic or antiholomorphic representations of g as in the case of sl 2 r m 1 this theory can be extended to include other types of representation of sp m r in this case we need to broaden or scope to include the space of generalized bessel models for a generic character s 1 2 classification of lie groups of tube type and its generalized bessel characters let g be a connected simple lie group with finite center and let k be a max imal compact subgroup we assume that g k is hermitian symmetric of tube type this can be interpreted as follows there exists a group homomorphism of a finite covering s of psl 2 r into g such that if h s then h k is the center of k we take a standard basis h e f of lie h over r with the stan dard tds three dimensional simple commutation relations e f h h e 2 e h f 2 f if g lie g then we have g n m a n with n m a n respectively the 2 0 2 eigenspace of ad h a rh and m the orthogonal com plement of a in m a with respect to the cartan killing form in particular n and n are commutative and e n f n let be the cartan involution of g corresponding to the choice of k then we may assume n n f e and r e f lie h k set p m a n and let p g g ad g p p then p is a parabolic subgroup of g and if we take its langlands decomposition p man then m lie m a lie a and n lie n let be a generic character of n and let m m m ad m in this section we will describe representatives for all the equivalence classes of generic characters on n for the rest of the section we will fix a unitary character r of r this is the list of examples 13 1 g sp n r realized as 2 n 2 n matrices such that gjng t jn with jn 0 in in 0 with in the n n identity matrix upper t means transpose g g 1 t with this description ma g 0 0 g 1 t g gl n r n i x 0 i x m n r xt x the list of generic characters is described as follows let p q be two positive integers such that p q n define a character p q as follows p q i x 0 i r tr ip qx from this definitions it is clear that m p q o p q using the natural identification m gl n r 2 g su n n realized as the 2 n 2 n complex matrices g such that glng ln with ln 0 iin iin 0 in this case the centralizer ma of h in g is the set of all g 0 0 g 1 with g gl n c and n i x 0 i x m n r x x 14 representatives of equivalence classes of characters are again parameterized by positive integers p q such that p q n and we can define p q i x 0 i r tr ip qx in this case m p q u p q 3 g so 4 n realized as the group of all g so 4 n c such that gj 2 ng j 2 n we can describe g lie g as a lie subalgebra of m 2 n h as the matrices in block form a x y a with a x y mn h and x x y y in this form g m 2 n r lie sp n r we take e f h as above and note that ma gl n h if we define p q as before it is then easy to check that m p q sp p q 4 g the hermitian symmetric real form of e 7 in this case we will emphasize a decomposition of lie g which makes it look exactly like those examples 1 2 and 3 in each of those cases we have lie g a x y a with a an element of mn f and f r c or h the upper is the conjugate of the field transposed furthermore x y are elements of mn f that are self adjoint example 4 corresponds to the octonions o here we replace m 3 o by m a r e 6 2 the real form of real rank 2 with maximal compact of type f 4 we take for x y elements of the exceptional euclidean jordan algebra the 3 3 conjugate adjoint matrices over o with multiplication a b 1 2 ab ba thus in this case the x s and y s are defined in the same way for the octonions as for the other fields here m acts by operators that are a sum of jordan multiplication and a derivation of the jordan algebra the derivations defining the lie algebra of 15 compact f 4 with this notation our choice of e f h are exactly the same as the examples for r c or h in this case we can define the characters 3 0 i x 0 i r trx in which case m 3 0 is isomorphic to compact f 4 or the character 2 1 i x 0 i r tr i 2 1 x in which case m 2 1 is isomorphic to f 4 1 the real form of f 4 of real rank 1 the stabilizer of the characters 1 2 and 0 3 are the same as the stabilizers for 2 1 and 3 0 respectively there is one more example that doesn t fit this beautiful picture 5 g so n 2 realized as the group of n 2 by n 2 matrices of determinant 1 that leave invariant the form 0 0 1 0 in 1 1 0 1 0 0 here ma a 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 a 1 a r m so n 1 1 and n 1 vt v v 2 0 i v 0 0 1 v r n 1 1 representatives of the orbits of generic characters are given by k 1 vt v v 2 0 i v 0 0 1 r vk where vk is the k th component of v observe that m n so n 1 r 16 and m k so n 2 1 if k 6 n 1 3 jacquet integrals and bessel models let g be one of the simple lie groups of tube type we just described and let p man and m be as before let p m a n be a minimal parabolic sugroup such that p p n n a a m m let be the system of positive roots of g relative to p and let m be the system of positive roots of ma induced by let w w g a wm w ma a and set wm w w w m then we have the following classical result lemma 1 3 1 bruhat decomposition with notation and assumptions as above 1 if v w then v can be expressed in a unique way as a product of an element in wm and an element in w m 2 given v w fix wv nk a such that m wv v then g v wm p wvp 3 let vg be the longest element of w vm the longest element of wm and set vm vgvm if we set wg wvg wm wvm and w m wvm then p w mp pwmn and if v 6 vm then dimp wvp dimpw mn 17 corollary 1 3 2 assume that the character has compact stabilizer then g v wm p wvm n furthermore if v wm and v 6 vm then dimp wvm n dimp w mm n proof from the classification of simple lie groups of tube type we see that if the stabilizer of m is compact then there is a maximal compact subgroup k such that if we set km m k then m km is a maximal compact subgroup of m we note that wm v w v m hence wv p m w 1 v p the iwasawa decomposition implies that m p m km since wva w 1 v a for all v w we see that g v wm p wv p m kmn v wm p wv p m w 1 v wvkmn v wm p wvkmn if we now use that m km we obtain the decomposition we wanted the dimension assertion follows from the fact that vm vgvm is the unique element of wm such that wvnw 1 v n 1 lemma 1 3 3 assume that the character has compact stabilizer if v wm is not vm then the restriction of to w 1 v n wv n is non trivial proof the tube type assumption implies that is a root system of type cn with n dima hence there exist linear functionals 1 n on a lie a such that i j 1 i j n 2 1 2 n and m i j 1 i j n 18 let x lie n be such that h x 2 i h x for all h lie a for such an x it can be checked that d x 6 0 hence if v wm and restricted to w 1 v n wv n is trivial we must have v 1 2 i i 1 n therefore v 1 i j for all i j which implies that v vm given an admissible smooth fr chet representation v of g and a generic character of n define the space of bessel models of v to be wh v v n v n v for all n n here v is the continuous dual of v observe that we can define an action of m on wh v by setting m v m 1 v for m m wh v effectively if n n m n v m 1 n v m 1 nm m 1 v m 1 nm m 1 v n m v where the last equality follows from the fact that ad m for all m m if v is an admissible smooth fr chet representation of m we will set wh v hom v v mn v n m v where hom v v is the set of continuous linear maps between v and v observe that if v is irreducible then there is a natural m equivariant embedding v wh v wh v given by v v for v wh v and v v let v be an admissible smooth fr chet representation of m of moderate growth let a lie a and let a c be the set of complex valued linear functionals on a let be half the sum of the positive roots of p relative to a given an element a c set nam a m for all n n a a m m 19 let i g v is smooth and namk a k and define an action of g on i by setting g x xg for x g g if we give to i the usual c topology then i is an admissible smooth fr chet representation of g of moderate growth let i k v is smooth and mk m k for all m km observe that this space has a natural k action given i define i by namk a m k observe that the map 7 defines a k equivariant isomorphism between i and i for all a c given an element i and a generic character of n we define its gener alized jacquet integral to be the integral j n n 1 w mn dn observe that if g is a simple lie group of tube type then dim a c 1 and we can use to identify a c with c we will use this identification during the rest of the chapter lemma 1 3 4 there exists a constant q such that j n n 1 w mn dn converges absolutely and uniformly in compacta of a c re q for all i proof from the iwasawa decomposition of g we have that for any n n there exists n wmn n a wmn a m wmn m and k wmn k such that w mn a wmn re m wmn k w mn 1 3 on the other hand in w 3 proof of 4 5 6 it is proved that there exists some constants c 1 and r depending on such that m wmn c 1 n r 20 now in w 3 lemma 4 a 2 3 it s shown that there exists a constant c 2 and linear functional 0 such that n c 2 a w mn therefore m wmn ca wmn rd for some constant c 0 from this equation and 1 3 we conclude that w mn ca wmn r re k w mn therefore it is enough to show that there exists a constant q such that if a c and re q then n a wmn r re dn but this follows directly from w 3 thm 4 5 4 let a c be such that re q and let v define a linear functional of i by j n n 1 p w mn dn it s easy to check that wh i furthermore given v v we can find an element i with support on pw mn such that j v this means that if then in the next section we will describe how we can use the theory of the transverse symbol of kolk varadarajan to define a map wh i v for all a c such that if re q then furthermore we will show how we can make use of lemma 1 3 3 to show that this map is injective in the case where has compact stabilizer 1 4 the transverse symbol of kolk varadarajan let h be a lie group and let x be a c manifold with a left h action given a fr chet space e let c c x e be the space of smooth compactly supported 21 functions on x with values in e we will denote by d x e c c x e its dual space and we will make the identification d x e hom c c x e we will call any element in this space an e distribution on x fix an h orbit o x let diff r be the sheaf of differential operators of order r on x for any x x let v r x be the subspace of diff r x generated by germs of r tuples v 1 vr of vector fields around x for which at least one of the vi is tangent to o let i r x diff r 1 x v r x choosing local coordinates at x it can be seen that i r x actually is the stalk at x of a subsheaf i r diff r 11 hence we have a well defined quotient sheaf m r diff r i r with stalk at x equal to m r x diff r x i r x it can be checked that m r is a vector bundle over o of finite rank 11 this is the r th graded part of the transverse jet bundle on o observe that m r is the r th symmetric power of m 1 we say that t d x e has transverse order r at x o if there exists an open neighborhood u of x in x such that for all f c c u e with the property that df o u 0 for all d diff r u t f 0 let d r o x e be the linear subspace of elements in d x e which have transverse order r at all points of o observe that if t d r o x e then supp t o which justifies the notation given a normal subgroup h h and a point y o define a character y of h y h h h y y by y h h h h y h where h is the modular function of hy and h y is the modular function of h y the following theorem is a restatement of theorems 3 9 3 11 and 3 15 of 11 22 theorem 1 4 1 kolk varadarajan let x be a c manifold with a left action of h let e be a smooth fr chet representation of a normal subgroup h of h and let o x be an h orbit of x 1 assume that the action of h can be extended to an action of h if there exists y o such that m r y e c y h y 0 for all r z 0 then d o x e h 0 2 assume that h h then for any t d r o x e d r 1 o x e there exists y m r y e c y hy such that t f h hy h y f dh 3 assume that e is finite dimensional and assume that for all y o m r y e c y h y 0 for all r z 0 then d o x e h 0 we will now show how we can use this result to define a linear map wh i v given f c c g and v v set fp v g p f pg p 1 v drp then fp v pg p f g i e fp v i p 23 let up f i p supp f p wm n then given f c c g such that supp f p w m n fp v up further more the span of the fp v s constructed this way is dense in up let d p wm n v t c c p w m n v be the space of v distributions on p w m n given wh ip define d p wm n v by f v fp v it s easy to check that actually d p wm n v 2 c p n hence according to part 2 of kolk varadarajan theorem there exist v such that f v n p n 1 f pwmn p 1 v drp dn fp v n n 1 fp v w mn dn j p fp v k we will denote the map 7 by p observe that if re q then is surjective since given v we can define j and it s then clear that proposition 1 4 2 assume that the character has compact stabilizer if wh i p and up 0 then 0 corollary 1 4 3 if has compact stabilizer then the map p wh ip v is injective 24 proof of proposition we will first reduce the problem to the case where is an induced representation if v is a finite dimensional representation of p we define i p to be the space of smooth g v such that pg p g for p p and g g set g x xg for x g g if we endow i p with the c topology then i p is an admissible smooth fr chet representation of moderate growth let f be a finite dimensional representation of pm p m and let i pm be the corresponding representation ofm observe that p m is a minimal parabolic subgroup ofm the casselman wallach theorem implies that there exists a surjective continuous m intertwining operator l i pm v for some finite dimensional representation f of pm this map lifts to a surjective g interwining map l i p i p given by l g l g for i p g g the representation i p is equivalent to the representation smoothly induced from p to g by the representation of p with values on f defined as follows nap a p for p pm a a n n setting we can identify the map l with a surjective g equivariant map l i p i p set up i p supp pwmn p w mp and define wh i p in the same way as above assume that we have proved the proposition for i p i e assume that if wh i p and up 0 then 0 let wh i p be such that up 0 and let l be the pullback of to wh i p by l it s easy to check using the definition of l that up 0 and hence by our assumptions l 0 but l is surjective therefore 0 we will now prove the proposition for wh i p let wh i p be such that up 0 proceeding as before we can define a distribution d g f c n n that vanishes on the big bruhat cell now if we can prove that d p wvkmn g f c n n 0 v wm v 6 vm then the standard bruhat theoretic argument shows that and hence is equal to 0 25 now since km m we can extend the action of n n on f c to an action of p kmn therefore from part 1 of theorem 1 4 1 we just need to show that m r wv f c n n wv 0 r 0 but this follows from the fact n acts unipotently on m r wv f and that the restriction of to w 1 v n wv n is non trivial according to lemma 1 3 3 although proposition 1 4 2 is false in the case where the stabilizer of is non compact we will show later how we can obtain a similar result in the general case but before we are able to prove this result we will need dig a little bit more into the structure of lie groups of tube type 1 5 the bruhat matsuki decomposition of a lie group of tube type an affine symmetric space is a triple g h consisting of a connected lie group g a closed subgroup h of g and an involutive automorphism of g such that h lies between g and the identity component of g where g denotes the closed subgroup of g consisting of all the elements fixed by if g is real semi simple matsuki 14 has given an explicit double coset decomposition of the space h g p where p is a minimal parabolic subgroup of g his construction goes as follows let g h be an affine symmetric space such that g is real semi simple and g h the corresponding symmetric algebra let be a cartan involution commutative with and g k p the corresponding cartan decomposition since the factor space g p is identified with the set of all minimal parabolic subalgebras of g the following theorem and corollary give a complete characterization of the h orbits on g p theorem 1 5 1 1 let p be a minimal parabolic subalgebra of g then there exists a stable maximal abelian subspace ap of p and a positive system of the root system of the pair g ap such that p is h conjugate to p ap 26 where h is the identity component of h p ap m ap n m z ap n g and g x g y x y xfor all y p 2 let ap and a p be stable maximal abelian subspaces of p and be positive systems of root systems p ap and p a p respectively if p ap and p a p are h conjugate then ap and a p are k conjugate k h k if ap is a stable maximal abelian subspace of p we can define a subgroup w ap k of the wey group w ap by w ap k m ap k m ap k where m ap nk ap and m ap zk ap corollary 1 5 2 let api i i be representatives of the k conjugacy classes of stable maximal abelian subspaces of p then there exists a one to one corre spondence between the h conjugacy classes of minimal parabolic subalgebras of g and i iw ap k w api where the union is disjoint the correspondence is given as follows fix a positive system i of api for each i i then w ap k w i iw ap k w api corresponds to the h conjugacy class of minimal parabolic subalgebras of g con taining p ap w i let ap be a stable maximal abelian subspaces of p such that ap ap p is maximal abelian in p p h put q x g x x and ap ap h ap where h is the unique element in ap such that b h h h for all h ap b is the killing form of g let i i 1 k be elements of ap and x i i 1 k be on zero elements of g i then x 1 x k is said to be a q orthogonal system of ap if the following two conditions are satisfied i x i q for i 1 k ii x i x j 0 and x i x j 0 for i j 1 k i 6 j two q orthogonal systems x 1 x k and y 1 y k are said to be conjugate under w ap k if there is a w w ap k such that w k i 1 rh i k i 1 rh i then the following theorem gives a complete characterization of the k conjugacy classes of stable maximal abelian subspaces of p 27 theorem 1 5 3 let g h be an affine symmetric spaces such that g is real semi simple a cartan involution of g commutative with and g k p the corresponding cartan decomposition of g let ap be a maximal abelian subspace of p and ap a maximal abelian subspace of p containing ap then there exists a one to one correspondence between the k conjugacy classes of stable maximal abelian subspaces of p and the w ap k conjugacy classes of q orthogonal systems of ap the correspondence is given as follows let q x 1 x k be a q orthogonal system of ap put r k i 1 rh i a p h ap b h r 0 a p ap k i 1 r x i x i where ap ap q and a p a p a p then the w ap k conjugacy class of q orthogonal system of ap contain ing q corresponds to the k conjugacy class of stable maximal abelian sub space of p containing a p moreover if x i i 1 k is normalized such that 2 i h i b x i x i 1 then a p ad exp 2 x 1 x 1 ad exp 2 x k x k ap where x i x i theorem 1 5 4 let g h be an affine symmetric space such that g is real semi simple a cartan involution commutative with and g k p the cor responding cartan decomposition let ap be a maximal abelian subspace of p such that ap is maximal abelian in p and q 1 qm be representatives of w ap k conjugacy classes of q orthogonal systems of ap suppose that qj x 1 x k is normalized such that 2 i h i b x i x i 1 i 1 k for each j 1 m put c qj exp 2 x 1 x 1 2 x k x k then 1 we have the following decomposition of g g mi 1 v w ap k w api hwvc qi p disjoint union where p p ap is a positive system of ap api ad c qi ap and wvis an element of m api that represents an element of the left coset v w api 28 2 put pi wv wvc qi pc qi 1 w 1 v let h 1 h 2 h and p 1 p 2 p then h 1 wvc qi p 1 h 2 wvc qi p 2 if and only if there exists an x h pi wv such that h 2 h 1 x and that p 2 c qi 1 w 1 v x 1 wvc qi p 1 3 let p p a p ma pn be a minimal parabolic subgroup of g such that a p is stable then h p k m a p exp h n

observe that a m ip q 1 i 0 p q 2 i 1 i and hence dim a m ip q i 1 6 the vanishing of certain invariant distributions definition 1 6 1 let v be a smooth fr chet moderate growth representation of a semi simple lie group g with finite center we say that v has a split eigenvec tor if the following holds there exists an iwasawa decomposition g k a n where g lie g and an element h a such that 31 1 the projection of h to any simple factor of g is non zero 2 there exists v v such that h v v for some c lemma 1 6 2 let g be a connected semi simple lie group with finite center let v be a smooth irreducible admissible fr chet representation of moderate growth with a split eigenvector then dimv proof let k be a maximal compact subgroup of g associated with a cartan involution let vk be the space of k finite vectors of v then the casselman wallach theorem implies that if vk n vk then extends to a continuous map of v to c this implies that vk n vk v n v as an a module let v 6 0 be such that hv v with c let w be the restricted weyl group of g acting on a if g is simple over r then the action of w on a would be irreducible hence our assumption onh implies that wh spans a if s w then there exists s k such that ad s h sh and d s hs v s v this implies that there exists u v and a c such that if h a then hu h u now since the action of a diagonalizes on u g and u g u v the action of a diagonalizes on v let 1 m a c be the weights of a on v n v then we see that the set of weights of a on v is contained in mi 1 i a non zero sum of positive roots of a in n note that m let n n these observations imply that n acts locally nilpotently on v now let u be a weight vector for a on vk since v n v vk n vk the above argument implies that such a u exists then we have u n u a u u n u which is finite dimensional thus vk u k u n u a u is finite dimensional observe that this lemma implies in particular that if g is as above and v is an irreducible tempered representation of g then v has no split eigenvectors proposition 1 6 3 let v be an admissible representation of p such that n acts locally unipotently an v has finite length let ip f g v f is c and f pg p f g for all p p 32 and let up f ip supp f pw mn let v be a representation of m with no split eigenvectors and let wh ip ip v nm f n m f n n m m let wh ip be such that up 0 then 0 proof given f c c g and v v define fv ip by fv g p p 1 f pg v dlp it s easy to check that f v 7 fv defines a surjective continuous map from c c g v to ip let wh ip be such that up 0 and define a hom v v valued distribution on g by f v fv to prove the proposition it suffices to show that 0 by the definition of lpf v p 1 v p p 1 6 rnmf v n m n n m m 1 7 and supp g pw mn recall that according to equation 1 4 g q i 0 w wm wv w a ki w a p w wvcim n so the condition supp g pw mn says that supp is contained outside the union of the open orbits we will show that all the other orbits can t support distributions satisfying conditions 1 6 and 1 7 then the usual bruhat theoretic argument show that 0 let ow v i p w wvcim n be an orbit that is not an open orbit then either w 6 w m ci 6 e or both let h w v i mn m m and w 1 wvcim 1 c 1 i wvw 1 p 33 and let h w v i wwvcim 1 c 1 i w 1 v w 1 m m h w v i observe that h w v i is the stabilizer of wwvci on p m n define a representation w v i v of h w v i by h v wwvcimci 1 w 1 v w 1 v let m r w v i be the r th transverse bundle on o w v i defined by kolk varadarajan 11 then theorem 3 9 of the aforementioned paper says that if homh w v i v m r w v i vt 0 r 1 8 then d g hom v v p m n 0 1 9 assume that ci 6 e let homh w v i v m r w v i vt for each t r define ht cosh t sinh t i sinh t cosh t observe that the ht define a one parameter subgroup of m observe also that wwvci cosh t sinh t i sinh t cosh t c 1 i w 1 v w 1 wwv e t i et w 1 v w 1 a since the action of a on v m r w v i is semi simple there exists a nonzero vector v v m r w v i such that wwv e t i et w 1 v w 1 v e tv for some c on the other hand cosh t sinh t i sinh t cosh t v wwv e t i et w 1 v w 1 v e tv e t v 34 which contradicts our assumption on v hence if i 6 0 homh w v i v m r w v i vt 0 r now assume that i 0 then o w v 0 p wwvm n since w 6 wm there exists 1 i j n such that wwv i xei i i w 1 v w 1 i xej j i n now since n acts locally unipotently on v m r w v i there is a v v m r w v i such that i xej j i v v v with v ker and v 6 0 on the other hand i xej j i v wwv i xei i i w 1 v w 1 v i xei i i v for all x r but this is only possible if v 0 which is a contradiction from all this we see that if o w v i is not an open orbit then do w v i g hom v v p m n 0 now the standard bruhat theoretic argument shows that 0 which implies that 0 we are now ready to state the main result of this chapter theorem 1 6 4 let v be an admissible smooth fr chet representation of m and let v be an smooth irreducible tempered representation of m 35 1 the map wh i p homm v v defines a linear isomorphism for all a c 2 for all homm v v the map 7 j extends to a weakly holomorphic map of a c into hom i v before starting the proof of this theorem we will need some technical results that we will develop in the next section 1 7 tensoring with finite dimensional representa tion let g be a simple lie group of tube type and let p man be a siegel parabolic observe that dima 1 hence we can choose h lie a such that if f is a finite dimensional representation of g then there exists an integer r such that f rj 0 f 2 j r where fj v f h v jv given such a finite dimensional representation f set xj r k jf 2 k r then f x 0 x 1 xr xr 1 0 is a p invariant filtration if we now set y j f xj 0 then f y r 1 y r y 0 0 is the corresponding dual filtration we will identify i p f with the space g v f pg p i g and observe that i p g v f pg p p g 36 with this conventions there is an isomorphism of g modules i p f i p where g i g g and g i g 1 g let j xj be the restriction of to p acting on xj and let j xj xj 1 be the representation induced on the quotient then we have the following g invariant filtration i p i p 0 i p r 1 0 moreover it can be checked that i p j i p j 1 i p j the next theorem is a restatement of some of the results given in 22 for the case at hand theorem 1 7 1 let g be a lie group of tube type and let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup with given langlands decomposition let be a generic char acter of n and set g lie g there exists an element u g m depending only on f such that 1 the map wh i p f wh i p f is an isomorphism 2 if wh i p y j then with i p y j 1 define wh i p f wh i p by 37 then it s clear from the above lemma that defines an m equivariant iso morphism if v is a representation of p let i p g v pg p p 1 2 p g up i p supp p w m n observe that if up then has compact support modulo p if v is a representation of m define wh i p homm v v in the same way we defined now observe that since is an m equivariant isomorphism induces an isomorphism which we wil also denote by wh i f v m wh i v m wh i wh i here we are using the fact that wh v wh v v m for all representa tions v of g and v of m we will identify wh i i f v n i n m m m then we can identify with a map wh i homm v f v such that if wh i u and we set then n n 1 wmn dn let a c be such that is an isomorphism for every representation v of m then is an isomorphism and if we set 1 then 38 the following diagram commutes homm v f v wh i wh i homm v f v 1 10 lemma 1 7 2 is an isomorphism observe that this lemma immediately implies that is an isomorphism proof let homm v f v since is an isomorphism there exists wh i such that i e if up then n n 1 wmn dn to prove the lemma we will show that if homm v f v is such that v 0 for all v v xj then i wm v 0 v v xj 1 for any such wh i y j v m and hence with i p y j 1 v therefore if i xj 1 then 0 and now by definition n n 1 wmn dn but on the other hand since up n n 1 wmn dn n n 1 i wmn wmn dn 39 given vj 1 v xj 1 choose a i xj 1 such that wm vj 1 let uk k be an approximate identity on n and define k up by k wmn u k n n wmn then lim k n n 1 k wmn dn lim k n n 1 i wm k wm dn lim k n uk n wmn dn lim k n uk n i wm wm dn wm i wm wm vj 1 i w 1 m vj 1 since this holds for all vj 1 v xj 1 we conclude that i w 1 m v y j 1 v as we wanted to prove we will now choose a representation f such that the action of m on fr is trivial then 0 r and hence i 0 i r let w j wh i i j 0 observe that if w j 1 then i j defines an element in wh i j lemma 1 7 3 there exists and isomorphism s wh i r j 0 w j 1 i j 40 such that the following diagram is commutative wh i r j 0 w j 1 i j rj 0 wh i p j rj 0 homm v xj xj 1 v homm v f v s j xj xj 1 fr 2 j 1 11 corollary 1 7 4 is an isomorphism for all a c proof of corollary let a c be such that is an isomorphism then we know that is an isomorphism and from the above diagram j is an isomorphism for all j in particular if f is as before then r is an isomor phism proceeding by induction it can now be shown that is an isomorphism for all a c proof of lemma let wh i since is an isomorphism there exists homm v f v such that if u then n n 1 wmn dn let pj be the natural projection of v f onto v fr 2 j since pj is m equivariant pj homm v f v let j 1 pj then it is clear that j furthermore if u j 1 then j pj n n 1 wmn dn 0 since all the values of are in xj 1 now since j u j 1 0 proposition 1 6 3 implies that j i j 1 0 i e j w j 1 define s 0 r with j j i j 1 41 it s then clear from the above observations that s is an isomorphism that makes diagram 1 11 commute 1 8 holomorphic continuation of certain jacquet integrals theorem 1 8 1 let v be an admissible smooth fr chet representation of m and let v be an smooth irreducible tempered representation of m 1 the map wh i p homm v v defines a linear isomorphism for all a c 2 for all homm v v the map 7 j extends to a weakly holomorphic map of a c into hom i v proof we have already seen that is an isomorphism for all a c given homm v v and i define 1 observe that if re 0 then j we will show that has holomorphic continuation to all a c by showing that it satisfies a shift equation let a c and i be arbitrary by definition r r 1 r r for some wh i r but now according to 1 10 and 1 11 there exists wh i and i such that r r t t where this is the desired shift equation which shows that is weakly holomorphic everywhere chapter 2 the bessel plancherel theorem 2 1 the bessel plancherel theorem for rank 1 lie groups of tube type let g be a lie group of tube type and let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup with given langlands decomposition given a character of n we will set c c n g to be equal to the set of smooth functions f g c such that f ng n f g for all n n g g and such that f has compact support modulo n we will also set l 2 n g f g c f ng n f g for n n g g and n g f g 2 dng here dng is the measure on n g such that if f c c g then g f g dg n g n f ng dn dng 2 1 observe that l 2 n g has a natural inner product defined by f h n g f g h g dng for f h l 2 n g let be the measure on n such that if f c c n then f e n f d 2 2 42 43 where f is the fourier transform of f given f c c g l 2 g define sf c c n g l 2 n g by sf g n n 1 f ng dn 2 3 we would like to use this equation to identify f with a section sf on a vector bundle e over n with fibers l 2 n g unfortunately this bundle fails to satisfy the local triviality property we will work around this problem in the following way given f c c n g and p p set lpf g f p 1 g then lpf ng f p 1 ng f p 1 np p 1 g p 1 np f p 1 g p n lpf g i e lpf c c n g p moreover according to section 2 c lpf lpf n g lpf g lpf g dng n g f p 1 g f p 1 g dng n g f g f g p p 1 dng p p 1 f f where p is the modular function of p what this couple of equations say is that we can extend lp to a conformal transformation from l 2 n g to l 2 n g p now from equation 2 3 srg 1 f g n n 1 rg 1 f ng dn n n 1 f ngg 1 dn sf gg 1 rg 1 sf g 2 4 and slpf g n n 1 lpf ng dn n n 1 f p 1 npp 1 g dn n pnp 1 1 p p f np 1 g dn n p 1 n 1 p p f np 1 g dn p p sf p 1 p 1 g 2 5 let be the set of open orbits for the action of p on n then we can use equations 2 4 and 2 5 to define a p g vector bundle e 44 with fibers e l 2 n g now observe that if f c c g then according to equations 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 f f n g n f ng f ng dn dng n g n sf g sf g d dng n sf sf d sf sf d 2 6 where the last equality follows from the fact that the complement of the union of the open orbits of p in n has measure zero therefore if we set l 2 e s e s e and s 2 d then the map f 7 sf extends to a p g equivariant isometry between l 2 g and l 2 e this is the identification we were after when we defined sf we will now use the material developed in section 2 a to continue the study of the decomposition of l 2 g with respect to the action of p g for every we will fix a character then according to the material in section 2 a there is a natural p g equivariant isomorphism l 2 e indp gm n g l 2 n g therefore l 2 g l 2 e indp gm n g l 2 n g m indpm n l 2 m n g d m indpm n g w d d m g w ind p m n d d 2 7 here is the plancherel measure of m whereas is a measure on g that depends on and and w is some multiplicity space that also depends 45 on and on the other hand harish chandra s plancherel theorem says that l 2 g g p d 2 8 where is the plancherel measure on g we will now restrict to the case where g has rank 1 in this case if is generic then m is compact and hence equation 2 7 reads l 2 g m g w ind p m n d from this and equation 2 8 we conclude that for almost all p m w ind p m n 2 9 and that is absolutely continuous with respect to the plancherel measure for all i e l 2 m n g g w d 2 10 observe that in the rank 1 case p is both a maximal and a minimal parabolic subgroup and hence this case is contained in the calculation of the whittaker plancherel measure given in 24 there the multiplicity spaces w are explic itly computed to be isomorphic to the space of whittaker models wh looking at equations 2 7 2 8 2 9 and 2 10 it is natural to state the following conjecture conjecture 2 1 1 for almost all p m w ind p m n d 2 11 furthermore if is a generic character of n then l 2 n g g m w d d 2 12 where is the plancherel measure of m and is the plancherel measure of g 46 proving this conjecture will be the goal of this chapter we will start in section 2 2 where we will restate the asymptotic expansion of certain matrix coefficients developed by wallach 23 24 then in section 2 3 we will define the schwartz space c n g of l 2 n g analogous to the schwartz space c g of l 2 g and define a fourier transform map between c g and c n g in section 2 4 we will use the results developed in the previous two sections to prove equations 3 13 and 2 12 this is the generalized bessel plancherel theorem generalized in the sense that the group m may not be compact in the case where m is compact we can give a more explicit description of the isomorphism appearing in equation 2 12 in section 2 5 we will use the holo morphic continuation of the generalized jacquet integrals proved in section 1 8 to calculate the fourier transform of a wave packet in the case where m is compact this calculations will allow us to push forward the decomposition of c g to obtain a decomposition of c n g with explicit intertwiner operators finally in section 2 6 we will use this results together with the asymptotic expansions developed in section 2 2 to identify the multiplicity spaces w with the space of bessel models wh the chapter closes with three appendixes that although not necessary for the main results of this chapter are related to the material discussed here in appendix 2 a we discuss the basic representation theory of parabolic subgroups although this results are known from the work of wolf et al 13 it is convenient to have them here to set the notation and for easy reference appendix 2 b discusses the plancherel measure of the space l 2 p although not directly related to the bessel plancherel measure some of the ideas discussed there are used through this chapter finally in appendix 2 c it is proved that the support of the whittaker plancherel measure with respect to any parabolic subgroup is contained in the tempered spectrum this result may be useful in future calculations of other whittaker plancherel measures at least they give us hope that this whittaker plancherel measures may not be too awful 47 2 2 the asymptotic expansion of certain matrix coefficients let h be an admissible finitely generated hilbert representation of g let v be the space of smooth vectors of h given v v and v we can define a smooth function c v g g v for g g this function is called a matrix coefficient function in this section we will describe some asymptotic expansions of certain matrix coefficients c v where satisfies certain properties the exposition of this sections follows very closely the material developed in 23 and 24 i decided to put it here as it is convenient to develop this results together but if the reader so desires he can also look at the original exposition by looking at the references in the appropriate places let s start by specifying what we mean by an asymptotic expansion definition 2 2 1 by a formal exponential polynomial power series we will mean a formal sum of the form 1 j r ezjt n 0 pj n t e nt 2 13 where pj n is a polynomial in t for each j n the point here is that we do not care if the series converges fix such a formal series then we may rearrange it in the following way j 1 eujtpuj t 2 14 with uj zk n 1 k r n 0 n n re u 1 re u 2 and puj is the sum of the pk n with zk n uj we will call n a gap of the series if un un 1 if f is a function on r we say that f is asymptotic as t to the formal exponential polynomial power series given as in 2 13 if for each gap n there exists constants c and depending on n such that f t j n eujtpuj t ce re un t for t 1 48 notice that if n is a gap then lim t e reun t f t j n eujtpuj t 0 lemma 2 2 2 let 1 j r ezjt n 0 pj n t e nt and 1 j s ewjt n 0 qj n t e nt be two formal exponential polynomial series such that zj zk respectively wj wk is not an integer for j 6 k and pj 0 6 0 qj 0 6 0 if both formal exponential polynomial series are asymptotic to the same function f then r s and after relabeling wj zj pj n qj n this is precisely lemma 4 a 1 2 in 23 definition 2 2 3 let h be as above and let p a be a minimal p pair for g we say that v is tame with respect to p a if there exists a such that x a v cx va for all x u g v v and a cl a the important point in this definition is that doesn t depend on the element x u g observe that if h then is tame for all minimal p pairs p a the following proposition provides more examples of tame linear func tionals proposition 2 2 4 let h be an admissible finitely generated hilbert repre sentation of g let p nam be the siegel parabolic described in section 1 2 and let be a character of n whose stabilizer m is compact if wh v the isotypic component for some m then is tame for every minimal p pair p a such that a a 49 proof by the gelfand neimark decomposition g n m a n on the other hand according to the iwasawa decomposition m m am nm where m lie m and am nm lie p therefore g n m am nm a n and hence u g u a am nm u n u m n 2 15 the plan for the proof of this proposition is the following we will show that if wh v then u m n wh v and there exists a such that x a v cx va for all a cl a we will also show that if wh v satisfies that a v cva for all a cl a and x u n then x a v cx va for all a cl a observe that in this case x may no longer be in wh v finally if a v cva for all a cl a and x u a am nm we will show that x a v cx va for all a cl a it is then clear that all this statements together with equation 2 15 are enough to prove the proposition given wh v set w u m n and observe that this is a finite dimensional subspace of wh v let 1 k be a basis of w then for any given v v and every 1 i k there exists i a and a constant ci such that i a v cia i for all a cl a let a be such that a i a for all 1 i k a cl a if x u m n then there exists some constants bi x such that x a v k i 1 bi x i a v k i 1 bi x cia i ca 2 16 for some constant c let wh v be such that a v cva for all a cl a since a a we have that n n n n n let x n n for some root p a then x a v xta v aad a 1 xt v a a xt v cx va cx va 2 17 50 now let x n n for some root p a in this case we can always find y n n such that y 6 0 for such a y y a v y ta v aad a 1 y t v y a v a a y t v cy va a v c y va 2 18 where in the last step we are using that y 6 0 using this improved estimate we see that x a v xta v aad a 1 xt v a a xt v c x va c x va 2 19 since n is a direct sum of spaces of the form n n and n n with p a from 2 17 and 2 19 we conclude that if x u n then x a v cx va for all a cl a now assume that is a linear functional such that a v cva for all a cl a and let x u a u a am then x a v xt a v a xt v cx va 2 20 finally let x nm for some root p a then x a v xta v aad a 1 xt v a a xt v cx va cx va 2 21 since nm is a direct sum of its weight spaces from equations 2 20 and 2 21 we conclude that x a v cx va for all x u a am nm we have thus proved all the statements that we made at the beginning of the proof so we are done let k g be a maximal compact subgroup if v is as above we will denote by vk the space of k finite vectors of v let f 1 be a subset of p 0 a 0 p 1 a 1 be the corresponding standard p pair and let p 1 m 1 a 1 n 1 be the parabolic subgroup opposite to p 1 set e p 1 v a 1 c vk n 1 vk 6 0 51 where vk n 1 vk is the generalized weight space of vk n 1 vk i e there exists d 1 such that for all h a 1 h h d vk n 1 vk 0 now assume that p 0 a 0 1 r define h 1 hr a 0 by i hj i j then we can define v a 0 by v hj max re hj e p 0 v the following theorem provides an asymptotic expansion for the matrix co efficient function c v where v v and is a tame linear functional and it s essentially a combination of theorems 15 2 4 and 15 2 5 in 24 theorem 2 2 5 let h be an admissible finitely generated hilbert represen tation of g and let p 1 a 1 be a standard p pair with respect to the minimal p pair p a if v is tame with respect to p a then i there exists d 0 such that if v v then for all a cl a 0 a v 1 log a da v v v for some continuous seminorm v of v ii if h a 1 m m 1 and v v then exp th m v e p 1 v et h q l 1 e tq h p q th m v as t where p q a 1 m 1 v c is a function that is polynomial in a 1 real analytic in m 1 and linear in v and l 1 j nj j j p 1 a 1 and nj is a nonnegative integer the proof of this result is complicated and first we will need to prove the same result but for v vk instead of v v namely we need to first prove the following lemma which is equivalent to theorem 15 2 2 in 24 52 lemma 2 2 6 let h be an admissible finitely generated hilbert representa tion of g and let p 1 a 1 be a standard p pair with respect to the minimal p pair p a if v is tame with respect to p a then i there exists d 0 such that if v vk then for all a cl a 0 a v 1 log a da v v v for some continuous seminorm v of v ii if h a 1 m m 1 and v vk then exp th m v e p 1 v et h q l 1 e tq h p q th m v as t where p q a 1 m 1 vk c is a function that is polynomial in a 1 real analytic in m 1 and linear in vk and l 1 j nj j j p 1 a 1 and nj is a nonnegative integer proof we will start with the proof of i since is tame with respect to p a there exists a such that a v a v 2 22 for some seminorm of v let p a 1 l and choose elements hj a 0 such that i hj ij then i i and i i with i hi i hi the idea of the proof is to show that if i i then we can replace i with i at the cost of possibly changing the seminorm and adding a polynomial term fix i p a and set fi p a i and pi pfi then ai rhi and any given a cl a 0 can be expressed uniquely as a ata with at exp thi t 0 and a exp cjhj with cj 0 ci 0 we will now make use of the k finiteness of v let qi be the canonical projection of vk onto vk n ivk we claim that if qi v 0 then a v a i v 2 23 53 for some seminorm v effectively let x 1 x p be a basis of n i consisting of root vectors with corresponding roots 1 p if qi v 0 then v x jvj and hence a v ax jvj ad a x j a vj a j x tj a vj a j x j vj a i v here we are using the fact that if j is a root of n i and a cl a then a j a i given v vk choose vectors v v 1 vr vk such that q v 1 q vr is a basis of u ai qi v then hivj k bjkvk wj 2 24 with wj n ivk given a cl a 0 such that a i 1 set f t a v ata v 1 ata vr and g t a v ata w 1 ata wr then equation 2 24 says that d dt f t a v bf t a v g t a v where b bjk solving this differential equation explicitly we get that f t a v etbf 0 a v etb t 0 e sbg s a v ds observe that since v v 1 ata v f t a v e tbf 0 a v etb t 0 e sbg s a v 2 25 54 here we are using the usual norm in cr we will now estimate the two summands in the right hand side of 2 25 by equation 2 22 f 0 a v a v 2 26 on the other hand by the definition of v etb 1 t dietmax hi e pi v 1 t diet i 2 27 using equations 2 26 and 2 27 we can estimate the first summand in the right hand side of 2 25 namely etbf 0 a v 1 t diet i a v 2 28 to estimate the second summand of 2 25 observe that by equation 2 23 g t a v a et i 1 v 2 29 breaking cr as a direct sum of the invariant subspaces of b and using 2 29 it can be shown that etb t 0 e sbg s a v ds 1 t d i a et i 1 v ci 1 t diet i a v 2 30 finally from 2 25 2 28 and 2 30 we obtain the following bound ata v 1 t d i etmax i i 1 a v 2 31 if i i 1 we can use the fact that 1 t d i cet 2 for some constant c to get equation 2 22 again but for a new linear functional gotten from replacing i by i 1 2 we can then repeat this same argument a finite number of times until we get i i 1 observe that in the last step e t i dominates et i 1 so again from equations 2 25 2 28 and 2 30 we get ata v 1 t diet i a v 2 32 where di is as in equation 2 27 observe that this di is independent of v 55 to finish the proof of i observe that if a cl a 0 then a exp tjhj for some tj 0 if we repeat the argument leading up to equation 2 32 for all i 1 l we get that a v v l i 1 1 ti dieti i v 1 log a da for some d 0 and some seminorm we will now start the proof of ii we will only prove this result for p 1 p 0 the remaining cases being a consequence of this result fix a tame linear functional let a h a 0 h 1 and h for all p a and set l max h h a 0 h 1 let qk be the canonical projection of vk onto vk n k 0 vk arguing as in the proof of 2 23 we can show that if h a and qk v 0 then exp th v 1 t det l k v for all t 0 2 33 where is a continuous seminorm on v given v vk choose vectors v v 1 vr vk such that qk v 1 qk vr is a basis of u a 0 qk v then as in the proof of part i we have that hvj k bjk h vk wj 2 34 with wj n k 0 vk hence if we set f v v 1 vr and g v w 1 wr then from equation 2 34 we get that d dt f exp th v b h f exp th v g exp th v 56 where b h bjk h solving this differential equation explicitly we get that f exp th v etb h f v etb h t 0 e sb h g exp sh v ds 2 35 we will use this equation to derive an asymptotic expansion for exp th v for every h a given h a define e k h p v e k p v h l k observe that since ek h p v is finite there exists 0 such that h l k for all ek h p v let p k h be the projection of c r onto the generalized eigenspaces of b h with eigenvalues of the form h for ek h p v set qk h i p k h where i is the indentity map on c r starting with equation 2 35 and arguing as in the proof of i we can show that qk hf exp th v 1 t 2 det l k v 2 36 on the other hand from the fact that e sb h p k h c 1 s des k l and statement 2 33 we get that e sb h p k hg exp sh v 1 s 2 des k l es l k v 1 s 2 de s v 2 37 from the above equation the integral 0 e sb h p k hg exp sh v ds set f k h v p k hf v 0 e sb h p k hg exp sh v ds 2 38 then the above estimates imply that f exp th v etb h f k h v 1 t 2 det l k v 2 39 using again that e tb h p k h c 1 t det k l we obtain that lim t e tb h p k hf exp th v f k h v 2 40 57 from this equation we can get the following identity f k h v lim t e s t b h p k hf exp s t h v e sb h lim t e tb h p k hf exp th exp sh v e sb h f k h exp sh v 2 41 or equivalently f k h exp sh v e sb h f k h v set fk h t v equal to the first component of f k h exp th v then fk h t v e p v q l re q h l k et q h pk h q t v 2 42 for some polynomials pk h q t v observe that as long as k l re q h this polynomials are independent of k so if we let k we can use equations 2 39 and 2 42 to define an asymptotic expansion for exp th v since asymptotic expansions are unique the polynomials appearing in the expan sion are independent of the 0 chosen summarizing we have shown that given h a there exists polynomials ph q t v such that exp th v e p 0 v q l 0 et q h ph q t v as t to finish the proof we need to show that the ph q t v are actually polynomial on a 0 let h 1 h 2 a if we can show that p k h 2 f k h 1 v p k h 1 f k h 2 v then we have finished the proof of the lemma to simplify notation we will write p 1 for p k h 1 f 1 for f k h 1 and analogously for p 2 and f 2 we will start by making the following simple observations since h 1 h 2 a then 1 h 1 h 2 c 0 therefore if s t 0 sh 1 th 2 sh 1 th 2 s 2 h 1 h 1 2 st h 1 h 2 t 2 h 2 h 2 s 2 2 stc t 2 c 2 s 2 2 stc t 2 sc t 2 the upshot is that we have shown s t sh 1 th 2 cs t now observe that if ek h 1 p v e k h 2 p v then h 1 h 2 l k and hence sh 1 th 2 sh 1 th 2 s h 1 t h 2 s r l k 2 43 58 making use of this observations and of equation 2 37 we can check that e b sh 1 th 2 p 2 p 1 g exp sh 1 th 2 v 1 sh 1 th 2 2 de sh 1 th 2 v 1 s t 2 de cs t v 2 44 hence by the definition of f 1 e tb h 2 p 2 f 1 exp th 2 v e tb h 2 p 2 p 1 f exp th 2 v 0 e b sh 1 th 2 p 2 p 1 g exp sh 1 th 2 v ds where the convergence of the last integral is guaranteed by equation 2 44 taking the limit as t and using again equation 2 44 we get lim t e tb h 2 p 2 f 1 exp th 2 v lim t e tb h 2 p 2 p 1 f exp th 2 v 0 p 1 f 2 v 2 45 where the last equality follows from equation 2 40 but now using equation 2 41 we have that e sb h 1 lim t e tb h 2 p 2 f 1 exp th 2 exp sh 1 v e sb h 1 p 1 f 2 exp sh 1 v lim t e tb h 2 p 2 f 1 exp th 2 v p 1 f 2 v using this identity and reversing the roles of h 1 and h 2 in equation 2 45 we get that lim t e tb h 1 p 1 f 2 exp th 1 v p 2 f 1 v lim t p 1 f 2 v p 2 f 1 v as we wanted to show with this result at hand we will now start the proof of the theorem proof of theorem once again we will only consider the case p 1 p 0 the re maining cases being a consequence of this result the plan for the proof is teh 59 following given h a 0 such that h is an integer for all p 0 a we will show that for any v v the matrix coefficient c v has asymptotic expansion exp th v p i 1 ezit n 0 pi n t v e nt 2 46 where pi n t v are functions that are polynomial on t and continuous on v since asymptotic expansions are unique if v is a k finite vector this asymptotic expan sion must coincide with the asymptotic expansion given in lemma 2 2 6 now using that the pj n are continuous and that vk is dense in v we see that this asymptotic expansion should be of the form specified in the statement of the theorem to get the asymptotic expansion described in 2 46 we will first need to make some observations by the gelfand naimark decomposition g n 0 m 0 a 0 n 0 let p g m 0 a 0 be the canonical projection with respect to this decomposition it s a known result of harish chandra that there exist elements 1 e 1 ed z m 0 c a 0 c such that z m 0 c a 0 c i p z gc ei in particular for all h a 0 there exist elements zij z g such that hei j p zij ej let x 1 x p be a basis of n 0 consisting of root vectors with cor responding roots 1 p i p 0 a then there exists yijk u g such that zij p zij k x kyijk and hence hei j zijej j k x kyijkej therefore given v v if we set uik j gijkej then we get hei v j zij ej v k x kuik v let q be the canonical projection of v onto v n v the above equation implies that u a 0 q v is contained in the span of e 1 q v ed q v set ij zij and let z 1 zp be the generalized eigenvalues of the matrix ij now observe that hx kejuik v k h x kejuik v l x k jleluik v s x kx susjuik v 60 let q 2 be the canonical projection of v onto v n 2 v then from the above equa tion we see that the span of the ei v s and the xkejuik v s contains the subspace u a 0 q 2 v of v n 2 v furthermore for fixed i k the subspaces generated by the xkejuik v are invariant under the action of h and the generalized eigenvalues associated with this action are of the form zs k h if we continue with this process we can find a finite number of generating vectors for u a 0 qk v on v n kv furthermore the action of h on this subspace has generalized eigenvalues of the form zs m with m a non negative integer because k h is a non negative in teger for all k if we now proceed as in the proof of lemma 2 2 6 we would get an asymptotic expansion as the one described in 2 46 to finish the proof of the theorem we just need to refine the above argument to include all h a 0 which is easily done 2 3 the schwartz space for l 2 n g before giving the definition of the schwartz space for l 2 n g we will first recall the definition of the schwartz space for l 2 g and some of its properties definition 2 3 1 if f c g x y u gc and d n set qx y d f sup g g lyrxf g g 1 1 log g d where is harish chandra s function we define the schwartz space of g to be c g f c g qx y d f for all x y u gc d n if we endow c g with the topology induced by the seminorms qx y d then c g becomes a fr chet space furthermore it is well known that c c g c g l 2 g and that this inclusions are continuous and dense if we use the usual topologies on this spaces let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup of g with given langlands decomposition then we will fix as usual a generic character of n 61 definition 2 3 2 if f c n g x u gc and d 1 d 2 n set qx d 1 d 2 f sup g g a g m m g 1 1 log a g d 1 1 log m g d 2 rxf g here m is the function for the group m define the schwartz space for l 2 n g to be the space c n g f c n g qx d 1 d 2 f for all x u gc d 1 d 2 n we will endow c n g with the topology induced by the seminorms qx d 1 d 2 then it is easily seen that c n g is a fr chet space and that the space c c n g of all f c n g such that f c c n g is dense in c n g lemma 2 3 3 if f c n g then f l 2 n g furthermore there exists d 1 d 2 n and 0 c such that f 2 cq 1 d 1 d 2 f proof let d 1 and d 2 be so large that a 1 log a 2 d 1 da c 2 a and m m m 2 1 log m g 2 d 2 dm c 2 m for some positive constants ca and cm if f c n g then f namk a 1 log a g d 1 m m 1 log m g d 2 q 1 d 1 d 2 f thus f 2 n g f g 2 dg a m k a 2 f amk 2 da dmdk q 1 d 1 d 2 f 2 a 1 log a 2 d 1 da m m 2 1 log m g 2 d 2 dm c 2 ac 2 mq 2 1 d 1 d 2 62 lemma 2 3 4 let c n g and f c g then g g f g dg f converges absolutely and there exist continuous seminorms q 1 and q 2 on c n g and c g respectively such that f q 1 q 2 f proof we are looking at n a m k a 2 n amk f namk dn da dmdk now for each d 1 d 2 we have amk q 1 d 1 d 2 a 1 log a d 1 m 1 log m g d 2 thus g g f g dg q 1 d 1 d 2 n a m k a 1 log a d 1 m m 1 log m g d 2 f namk dn da dmdk in the proof of theorem 7 2 1 of 23 it is shown that there exists p a continuous semi norm on c g such that a m m 1 n f nam dn p f 2 47 thus if we take q 2 f supk k p rkf then we have g g f g dg q 1 d 1 d 2 q 2 f a 1 log a d 1 da m m 2 1 log m g d 2 dm if d 1 and d 2 are sufficiently large then the integral on the right converges there fore if we take q 1 q 1 d 1 d 2 with d 1 and d 2 large enough we obtain the statement of the lemma note that equation 2 47 immediately implies the following lemma 63 lemma 2 3 5 if f c g set f g n n 1 f ng dn the integral converges absolutely and the map f 7 f is continuous from c g to c n g let h be an irreducible square integrable hilbert representation of g and let v be the space of c vectors of h then v is an irreducible fr chet representation of moderate growth now let h be the dual of h and let h be the contragradient representation defined by g v g 1 v for h v h g g let v v be the space of c vectors of h and let v then v is also an irreducible fr chet representation of moderate growth observe that there is a natural g invariant bilinear pairing v v c given by v v lemma 2 3 6 given v and v v define c v g g v then c v c g proof let g g according to the kak decomposition there exists k 1 k 2 k and a a such that g k 1 ak 2 hence according to part i of theorem 2 2 5 there exists d 1 0 and continuous seminorms q 1 q 2 on v v respectively such that for all x y u gc lyrxc v g k 1 1 y a k 2 x v 1 log a d 1 a q 1 k 1 1 y q 2 k 2 x v 1 log a d 1 a qy qx v where qy supk k q 1 k 1 y and qx v supk k q 2 k x v on the other hand theorem 4 5 3 of 23 says that there exist constants c d 2 such that a g ca 1 log a d 2 64 therefore for all d 0 lyrxc v g g 1 1 log g d qy qx v 1 log a d 1 da but now since v is square integrable a hence there exists a constant cx y d such that lyrxc v g g 1 1 log g d cx y d for all g g since x y and d were arbitrary we conclude that c v c g as we wanted to show proposition 2 3 7 let h be a square integrable hilbert representation of g and let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup with given langlands decomposi tion let be a character of n whose stabilizer m in m is compact h an irreducible finite dimensional representation of m and let wh v be the isotypic component of wh v under the action of m given wh v we will set t v c v then t defines a continuous intertwiner operator be tween v and c n g the isotypic component of c n g under the left action of m furthermore each t extends to a continuous intertwining operator from h to l 2 n g and homg h l 2 n g t wh v proof we will first show t v c n g for all v v according to the iwasawa decomposition given g g we can find n n a a m m and k k such that g namk if we now use the kak decomposition for m we can find k 1 k 2 m and am a m such that m k 1 amk 2 therefore rxc v g t k 1 n 1 aam k 2 k x v n t k 1 1 aam k 2 k x v t k 1 1 aam k 2 k x v 2 48 now since wh v is finite dimensional there exists 1 r wh v such that t k i k i for some functions 1 r c m from this and equation 2 48 rxc v g i k i aam k 2 k x v i k i aam k 2 k x v 65 now let q be a minimal parabolic subgroup such that aam cl a q then by part i of theorem 2 2 5 there exists d 0 and continuous seminorms i such that rxc v g i k 1 log aam d aam q i k 2 k x v cx 1 log aam d aam q cx 1 log a 2 d 1 log am 2 d aam q where cx sup k 1 m k 2 k i i k 1 i k 2 xv observe that q q q with q a q now since n n n q n nq n nq n n q then q q with q cl a q and also q q with q cl a q therefore q q q q on the other hand theorem 4 5 3 of 23 says that there exist constants c d 2 such that a m m ca m 1 log a d 2 therefore for all d 1 d 2 0 rxc v g m m 1 1 log am d 1 1 log a d 2 a cx 1 log am d 1 2 d 1 log a d 2 2 da q q a q q m a a mm cx 1 log am d 1 2 d 1 log a d 2 2 da q qa q qm now since q a q and q q cl a q we conclude that there exists a constant cx d 1 d 2 such that rxc v g m m 1 1 log am d 1 1 log a d 2 a cx d 1 d 2 since x d 1 and d 2 were arbitrary we conclude that c v c n g n as we wanted to show 66 we will now define a new g invariant inner product on v in the following way given v 1 v 2 v we have that t v 1 t v 2 c n g n and hence by lemma 2 3 3 t v 2 t v 2 l 2 n g set v 1 v 2 t v t w then it is clear that is g invariant therefore by schur lemma v 1 v 2 t v 1 t v 2 c v

vectors to c vectors and defines a continuous intertwining operator on smooth frechet representations now l 2 n g c n g and evaluation at 1 is continuous on l 2 n g define t v t v 1 for v v then t wh v and t t t the result now follows 2 4 the generalized bessel plancherel theorem after the work done in the previous two sections we are finally ready to tackle conjecture 2 1 1 we will focus on proving the decomposition given in equation 3 13 and we will then show how we can use this result to prove the generalized bessel plancherel theorem given in 2 12 we will start by considering an irreducible square integrable hilbert repre sentation h of g let v v be as in the past section and let v and v v be arbitrary by theorem 2 3 6 the function c v c g and hence by lemma 2 3 5 the integral n n 1 n v dn converges absolutely therefore we can define a map w v wh v 67 by w v n n 1 n v dn when it s clear from the context what the the representation is we will sometimes drop the suffix and denote this map simply by w observe that the matrix coefficient function cw v c n g and also observe that r g cw v cw g v lemma 2 4 1 with notation and assumptions as above 1 w is m n equivariant 2 there exists a non degenerate hermitian form on w v such that cw 1 v 1 cw 2 v 2 1 d w 1 w 2 v 1 v 2 where d is the formal degree of 3 for all 1 2 v 1 2 n w 1 w 2 d here d d in the notation of equation 2 2 4 if v v v then w v w v w where v is the element in v defined by v w v w for all w h 5 there is a non degenerate bilinear pairing w v w v c given by w w v w v w 68 proof part 1 of this lemma follows directly from the definition of w so we will start with the proof of 2 given 1 2 w v define a g invariant inner product on v by v 1 v 2 1 2 d c 1 v 1 c 2 v 2 since this inner product is g invariant then by schur lemma there exists a con stant 1 2 such that d c 1 v 1 c 2 v 2 v 1 v 2 1 2 1 2 v 1 v 2 it is then clear that the bilinear form defined this way is hermitian and non degenerate we will now prove part 3 by classical fourier analysis if f l 1 n l 2 n then n f n f n dn f f f f n f f d 2 49 hence if 1 2 v and v 1 v 2 v c 1 v 1 c 2 v 2 n cw 1 v 1 cw 2 v 2 d 1 d 1 2 v 1 v 2 n 1 d w 1 w 2 v 1 v 2 d here we are using that c 1 v 1 c 2 v 2 are in l 1 n l 2 n when restricted to n according to lemma 2 3 5 and lemma 2 3 6 since this equation holds for all v 1 v 2 v we conclude that 1 2 n w 1 w 2 d we will now move to part 4 from part 2 cw 1 v 1 cw 2 v 2 1 d w 1 w 2 v 1 v 2 2 50 69 on the other hand by definition cw 1 v 1 cw 2 v 2 n g w 1 g v 1 w 2 g v 2 dng n g n n

conclude that w 2 1 w 1 w 2 which is equivalent to the equation appearing in part 4 finally for part 5 we only need to check that the definition only depends on w v but by part 4 w w v w v w w v w v where the last equality follows from the intrinsic symmetry between and v in the definition of w v we will denote by w h the closure of w v with respect to the inner product when it is clear what the representation is we will also drop the suffix in the notation of this inner product 70 let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup of g with given langlands decomposition given n and p p define p wh v whp v by p v p 1 v for wh v and v v observe that if p 1 p 2 p then p 1 p 2 p 1 p 2 also observe that if v v v then p w v w p 1 v n n 1 n p 1 v dn n n 1 p 1 pnp 1 v dn n p 1 np 1 p n v p p dn p p w p p

will define f p w v by f p p w p 1 set f p f p proposition 2 4 2 the map 7 f induces a p equivariant isometry between h and ind p m n w h proof let v then f f m n p f p f p dp m n p p w p 1 p w p 1 dp

p 1 f p 1 p p w p 1 w p 1 which implies that f we now want to construct a map analogous to w in the case where h is an induced representation let p 0 m 0 a 0 n 0 be a minimal parabolic subgroup and assume that p man is a siegel parabolic subgroup dominating p 0 let p 1 m 1 a 1 n 1 be another parabolic subgroup dominating p 0 if h is an admissible hilbert representation of m 1 and a 1 c lie a 1 c we will set i f g v f is c and f n amk a m f k for all n n 1 a a 1 and m m 1 here p 1 m 1 a 1 n 1 is the parabolic opposite to p 1 is half the sum of the positive roots of p 1 relative to a 1 and v is

we will now consider the natural g invariant pairing between i and i given by f p 1 g g f g dg where dg a 2 dk for g n amk n n 1 a a 1 m m 1 k k if u and m m we will set w w m w 1 j wm w 1 v where 1

this results in place we are now ready to state the analog of proposition 2 4 2 for induced representations this result is a very important step in the way of proving equation 3 13 proposition 2 4 5 given u define f w p w w p e w w the map 7 w f w extends to a p equivariant isometry between i and w ind p m 1 n w 1 h w 75 proof observe that by the definition of w w if m m then w w mp e w w p m hence if u w f w w f w w m n p m 1 m w w p m w w p m dmdp w n m 1 m w w m w w m dmd n n n 1 n 1 dn d where in the last step we have used lemma 2 4 4 and fourier inversion formula we can extend this map to an injective isometry between the hilbert spaces i and w ind p m 1 n w 1 h w now since w w e u w 1 w v w and w 1 w v w is dense in w 1 h w we conclude that this extended map is surjective we will now show how we can use this results to prove conjecture 2 1 1 let be a generic character of n from abstract representation theory we have that as an m module ind m m 1 w 1 h w m w w d w 2 54 for some measure w that depends on w and some multiplicities w that also depend on and w on the other hand if p 1 a 1 is a standard parabolic subgroup with respect to p 0 a 0 then we will write p 1 a 1 p a let e 2 m 1 be the set of irreducible square integrable representations of m 1 up to equivalence then harish chandra s plancherel theorem states that l 2 g p 1 a 1 p a e 2 m 1 i a 1 i i d 2 55 76 where a 1 is the positive weyl chamber of a 1 relative to p 1 and is a measure on a 1 that can be calculated explicitly on the other hand by proposition 2 4 5 and equation 2 54 i w indpm 1 n w 1 h w w indpm n ind m n m 1 n w 1 h w w indpm n m w w d w w m w w ind p m n d w 2 56 hence by equations 2 55 and equation 2 56 l 2 g p 1 a 1 a 1 w m w w ind p m n d w i d p 1 a 1 w m a 1 w w ind p m n i d d w where in the last equation we have used that w is independent of to reverse the order of integration on the other hand equation 2 7 says that l 2 g m g w ind p m n d d from this two equations we conclude that w is absolutely continuous with respect to is absolutely continuous with respect to and w i w w w using this and the series of equations leading to equation 2 7 we conclude that l 2 n g g m w d d 2 57 as we wanted to show 2 5 the fourier transform of a wave packet let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup of a lie group of tube type g in the last section we proved the generalized bessel plancherel theorem that is we 77 showed that if is a generic character of n then l 2 n g g m w d d where are the plancherel measures of m and g respectively and w is some multiplicity space that we identified with a subspace of wh what we want to show now is that if m is compact then w is actually isomorphic with wh and hence finite dimensional fix a generic character of n with compact stabilizer and let o be the orbit of under the action of p on n then we have the following lemma lemma 2 5 1 let h be an admissible hilbert representation of m given a c denote by i the representation induced from the opposite parabolic to p by and let i be such that n l 1 n l 2 n and supp o is compact let f i be arbitrary then f n j 0 j 0 f d 0 if we use the convention that j 0 f 0 if 0 o proof observe that for all 0 n 0 j 0 now f n n f n dn given 0 let f i be defined by f k n a n f k n a real where n n n a n m n k n with n n n a n a m n m k n k set f n n f n dn then is continuous for 0 and analytic for 0 now for 0 f n n a n f n dn n j 0 j 0 f d 0 78 on the other hand if we set f n j 0 j 0 f d 0 then is analytic for all and for 0 f f therefore f 0 f 0 f n j 0 j 0 f d 0 as we wanted to show let p 0 m 0 a 0 n 0 be a minimal parabolic subgroup with given langlands decomposition and assume that p dominates p 0 let p 1 m 1 a 1 n 1 be another parabolic subgroup dominating p 0 let pm 1 p m 1 mm 1 am 1 nm 1 where mm 1 m m 1 am 1 a m 1 nm 1 n m 1 let h be a hilbert square integrable representation of m 1 and let v be its space of smooth vectors then by the casselman wallach theorem there exist and injective intertwiner map v i where is an irreducible smooth representation of mm 1 and lie am 1 c the casselman wallach theorem also implies the existence of a map t i v such that t v v for all i v v lemma 2 5 2 let v and i be as above and let 1 nm 1 then for all i v v w 1 t v j 1 j 1 f where f v 79 proof let i be such that nm 1 l 1 nm 1 l 2 nm 1 and supp o 1 is compact then w 1 t

such that w 1 t v v j 1 from this two equations we conclude that v j 1 f and hence w 1 t v j 1 j 1 f as we wanted to show corollary 2 5 3 if v is a square integrable representation of m 1 define f i w

surjective map t i i let i v v then from lemma 2 5 2 w 1 j t v w 1 t j v j 1 j j 1 f where f v now if we use the natural identification i i then the above equation becomes f j j 1 f observe that the right hand side has holomorphic continuation to all definition 2 5 4 define w i ind m m 1 w 1 v by w m f m observe that if u then this definition is consistent with the previous definition of w also observe that w t ind m m 1 w 1 v i is injective furthermore w t ind m m 1 w 1 v wh i proposition 2 5 5 the map 7 f extends to a p equivariant isometry between i and ind p m 1 n w 1 h proof the proof is completely analogous to the proof of 2 4 5 81 we are now ready to state the main result of this section let p 0 p and p 1 be as before let h a square integrable hilbert representation of m 1 and set i f k v f is c and f mk m f k for all m km 1 k m 1 observe that as a k module i i for all a 1 c or in other words there is a family of representations i a 1 c with the same underlying representation space let i f i and let ia 1 c be a smooth compactly supported function for any g g we will set f g a 1 g f d where is the plancherel measure then f c g 24 thm 12 7 7 proposition 2 5 6

subgroup and let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup dominating p let p 1 m 1 a 1 n 1 be another parabolic subgroup dominating p let be a 83 generic character of n whose stabilizer in m m is compact we will set nm 1 n m 1 mm 1 m m 1 am 1 a m 1 nn 1 n n 1 m 1 m p 1 the purpose of this section is to prove the following theorem theorem 2 6 1 with notation as above 1 let v be a square integrable representation of m 1 and let a 1 c if h is an irreducible representation of m then wh i is finite dimensional and for all a 1 c there exists an isomorphism j wh 1 1 v h wh i where 1 nm 1 1 m 1 2 as an m n g representation l 2 n g m p 1 a 1 p a e 2 m 1 i a 1 wh 1 1 v h i d where is the usual plancherel measure for g 3 given c c ia 1 wh 1 1 v h and f i define c f g ia 1 j v g fv d then c f c n g we call this the explicit bessel plancherel theorem as here unlike the case for the generalized bessel plancherel theorem the multiplicities appearing in the decomposition are associated with finite dimensional vector spaces of interest in their own and we also have explicit intertwiner operators we will start this section by stating a version of frobenius reciprocity on which we will rely for the rest of the section although this result is well known we will include a proof of it here as it will be useful to have at hand the explicit formulas for the isomorphism 84 let v be an irreducible representation of a compact group k and let v be a smooth fr chet representation of a subgroup m k let i f k v f is smooth and f mk m f k for all m m we define a smooth fr chet representation i of k by setting k f k f kk for all k k k then we have the following result lemma 2 6 2 with notation as above there exists a canonical isomorphism homk i v homm v v proof part 2 of theorem 1 4 1 says that given homk i v there exists a unique homm v v such that f m k k 1 f k dk 2 58 and the map 7 defines a linear isomorphism between homk i v and homm v v this is enough to prove the lemma but we would like to give a more explicit description of what it s clear is that if for any homm v v and f i we set f m k k 1 f k dk 2 59 then and given v v set v k m mk m 1 v dm it s straightforward to check that v i furthermore for all m m m v k m mk m 1 m v dm m m mk m 1 v dm m mkm m 1 v dm v km m v k 85 let d be the dimension of v then from equation 2 58 d v m k k 1 d v k dk m k d k 1 m mk m 1 v dm dk m k m

then wh 1 1 v w i proof by proposition 2 3 7 if h is a square integrable hilbert representation of g then w h wh v 2 61 on the other hand by proposition 2 5 5 w i ind m m 1 w 1 h let w 1 h be the dual of w 1 h then by frobenius reciprocity w i h homm ind m m 1 w 1 h h h homm 1 w 1 h h h wh 1 1 v where the last equations follows from 2 61 and the definition of wh 1 1 v we will now want to show that wh i wh 1 1 v for all for this we will first need the following lemma 86 lemma 2 6 4 consider the following commutative diagram 0 u p 1 v p 2 w 0 s t 0 u p 1 v p 2 w 0 where the two rows are short exact sequences if s is an isomorphism and t is injective then t is an isomorphism furthermore there exists an isomorphism r u u that makes the whole diagram commute proof the proof is a classical diagram chasing argument and it s provided below but the reader my want to amuse himself and do the diagram chasing by his own we will first show that t is surjective let w w since p 2 is surjective there exists v v such that w p 2 v set w p 2 s 1 v w then t w t p 2 s 1 v p 2 v w since t was already injective by hypothesis we conclude that t is an isomorphism now let u u and observe that p 2 s p 1 u t p 2 p 1 u 0 since p 2 p 1 0 but now by the exactness of the bottom row there exists a unique u u such that p 1 u s p 1 u set r u u it s easy to check that this defines a linear map between u and u that makes the diagram commute let u u be such that r u 0 then s 1 p 1 r u 0 p 1 u since p 1 is injective this implies that u 0 since the only condition in u was that r u 0 we conclude that r is injective now let u u then p 2 p 1 u t p 2 s 1 p 1 u 0 now since t is an isomorphism we conclude that p 2 s 1 p 1 u 0 hence there exists a unique u u such that p 1 u s 1 p 1 u therefore p 1 u s p 1 u p 1 r u now since p 1 is injective we conclude that r u u finishing the proof of the surjectivity of r and finishing the proof of the lemma 87 let h be an irreducible square integrable hilbert representation of m 1 and let a 1 c let h be an irreducible representation of m given wh 1 1 v and f i define j f nn 1 m 1 m n 1 m 1 f nm dn dm lemma 2 6 5 let p 1 a 1 be the system of positive roots of a 1 induced by p 1 let b denote the cartan killing form on g c let wh 1 1 v and f i if reb 0 for all p 1 a 1 then the integral defining j f converges absolutely proof the proof of this lemma is identical to the proof of lemma 1 3 4 proposition 2 6 6 let wh 1 1 v and f i the map 7 j f extends to a holomorphic map from a 1 c to c furthermore j wh 1 1 v wh i is a linear bijection for all a 1 c proof let q p m 1 be a minimal parabolic subgroup of m 1 let v be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of m 0 and let a 0 m 1 be such that there exists a surjective map from i q onto v here i q i but we are including the parabolic subgroup from which we are inducing to avoid confusion with the several induced representations that we will use in this proof let w denote the kernel of this map if a 1 c then we have the exact sequence 0 i p 1 q w i p 1 q i p 1 0 in this sequence the first arrow is given by the obvious homomorphism s 1 given by s 1 f k f k since w i q and the second arrow is given by s 2 f k s f k the point is that the total spaces and s 1 s 2 are independent of we therefore have the exact sequence 0 wh i p 1 st 2 wh i p 1 q st 1 wh i p 1 q i p 1 0 2 62 88 we also have 0 wh 1 1 v st wh 1 1 i q wh 1 1 i q w 0 2 63 to simplify notation we will denote q by then we have that wh i p 1 q homm 0 v v wh 1 1 i q the isomorphism induced by this two isomorphisms is precisely j j 1 1 we now want to show that j induces a well defined injective map between wh 1 1 i q w and wh i p 1 q i p 1 to show that the induced map is well defined we need to show that if wh 1 1 i q and w 0 then j i p 1 0 let f i p 1 then the map 7 j f is holomorphic on let reb 0 0 then j f nn 1 m 1 m n 1 m 1 f nm dn dm 0 since f nm w for all n nn 1 m m and w 0 since the map 7 j f is holomorphic on we conclude that j f 0 for all a 1 c since f i p 1 was arbitrary we conclude that j induces a well defined map between wh 1 1 i q w and wh i p 1 q i p 1 now we want to show that the map is injective assume that j i p 1 0 let w w we will define a function on up 1 i p 1 in the following way given m m and n nn 1 we set f nm n w m where c c nn 1 is a function such that nn 1 n 1 n dn 1 then 0 j f nn 1 m 1 m n 1 m 1 f nm dn dm nn 1 m 1 m n 1 m 1 n w m dn dm m 1 m 1 m w m dm w 89 according to the proof of lemma 2 6 2 but this says that w 0 for all w w i e w 0 therefore the map j is well defined and injective between wh 1 1 i q w and wh i p 1 q i p 1 therefore we are in the situation of lemma 2 6 4 and hence we can define an isomorphism j from wh 1 1 v to wh i p 1 such that if reb 0 for all alpha in p 1 a 1 or f up 1 then j f nn 1 m 1 m n 1 m 1 f nm dn dm and the map 7 j f is holomorphic in to prove the theorem given at the beginning of this section we just have to put together all the results we have obtained more concretely part 1 is just a restatement of proposition 2 6 6 part 2 follows from part 1 the generalized bessel plancherel theorem and propositions 2 6 3 and 2 6 6 finally part 3 is just a restatement of proposition 2 5 6 2 a irreducible representations of siegel parabolic subgroups theorem 2 a 1 let p be a siegel parabolic subgroup of a lie group g and let p man be its langlands decomposition if h is an irreducible unitary representation of p then h ind p m n with m n proof as an n module we have that h n e d where e l v v n and l is a multiplicity space this means that there exists a vector bundle e n 90 and a measure on n such that h l 2 n e s n e s e n s 2 d under the action n s n s under this isomorphism we can extend this action of n on l 2 n e to an action of p on the same space let m m and define em n to be the vector bundle such that em em define a measure m on n by m x m x for x n a measurable set and define m l 2 n e l 2 n em m by m s m s m we claim that m is an isometry effectively m s 2 m n m s 2 d m n m s m 2 d m n m s 2 d m s 2 s 2 where the last equality comes from the fact that the action of p is unitary now if we define an action of n on l 2 n em m by m s n s 91 then m becomes an n intertwiner that is m n s m n s m mnm 1 m s m m mnm 1 m s m m 1 mnm 1 m m s m n m s m n m s but now since n is a ccr group the n interwiner m l 2 n e l 2 n em m should come from a morphism of vector bundles m e em that is m s m s and hence m s m s m s m m s which says that m s m s m 1 now since l 2 n e is irreducible as a representation of p the support of should be contained in a unique p orbit on n and hence l 2 n e l 2 ma m e ind p m n e using again that l 2 n e is irreducible we conclude that e with m n putting all of this together we get that h ind p m n as we wanted to show 92 2 b decomposition of l 2 p drp under the action of p p we will now decompose l 2 p drp under the action of p p given by p 1 p 2 f p 1 1 lp 1 rp 2 f as a left n module l 2 p ind p n ind n 1 1 ind p n l 2 n ind p n n hs v d n indpn hs v d l 2 n e with e hs v the isomorphism is given in the following way given f cc p define sf l 2 n e by sf p n n 1 f np dn observe that f sf and hence this map extends to an isometry between l 2 p and l 2 n e furthermore srp 1 f p n n 1 rp 1 f np dn n n 1 f npp 1 dn sf pp 1 rp

where and p are half the sum of the roots of p a and p a respectively proof let m be equal to half the sum of the roots of pm am pm p m the lemma follows from the integral formulas of the iwasawa decomposition of g and m and from the fact that m p given f l 2 n g define g f x f xg then l 2 n g is a unitary representation of g we now state the main result of this section lemma 2 c 2 supp is

follows from 2 66 2 67 2 69 and 2 70 chapter 3 applications howe duality 3 1 howe duality and the relative langlands pro gram let g be the set of k points of a reductive algebraic group defined over a local field k associated to this group g we can find the dual group g which is a complex reductive algebraic group and its l group lg which is a semi direct product of the absolute galois group of k with g let wd k be the weil deligne group of k in their current form the local langlands conjectures establish that there is a natural finite to one correspondence between the sets conjugacy classes of l parameters wd k lg equivalent classes of irreducible smooth representations of g let lh be a subgroup of the l group of g and consider the set of l parameters that factor through lh the natural question here is what is the set of irreducible representations of g associated to this l parameters the general consensus is that there should be a subgroup h g such that wd k lg lh irreducible representations of g with an h invariant functional 97 98 one can also ask the same question in the opposite direction given a subgroup h g satisfying certain properties is there an lh lg such that we have a correspondence like the mentioned above in recent years there has been a lot of progress in formalizing this ideas for example if x is a g spherical variety then gaitsgory and nadler 7 have defined a subgroup g x of the dual group g of g that encodes many aspects of the geometry and the representation theory of the variety x this result set into motion the so called relative langlands program which aims to set a framework for the study of h distinguished representations of g building on this ideas sakellaridis and venkatesh 20 have stated a conjecture that relates the harmonic analysis of the space l 2 x with the group g x the ideal result in this direction is the following given a g spherical variety x we want to find a group gx and a correspondence a g x g between the unitary duals of g and gx with the following properties 1 if a has l parameter wd k lgx then has l parameter i wd k lg where i is the natural inclusion of lgx into lg 2 we have the following spectral decomposition l 2 x a m d where is the plancherel measure of gx restricted to a and m is some multiplicity space we will consider the following classical example to illustrate this ideas let x sn 1 o n 1 r o n r where sn 1 is the n 1 th sphere and o n r is the group of n n orthogonal matrices we want to understand the decomposition of l 2 sn 1 under the natural action of o n r let c x 1 xn be the space of complex valued polynomials in n variables this space has a natural action of o n r and from classical invariant theory c x 1 xn k 0 hk c r 2 99 where r 2 x 21 x 2 n and hk p x c x 1 xn deg p x k and p 0 here 2 x 21 2 x 2 n is the laplace operator the spaces hk are irreducible under the action of o n r and if we restrict this polynomials to the unit circle we can identify them with square integrable functions on sn 1 the functions obtained this way are the so called spherical harmonics and it s a classical result that l 2 sn 1 k 0 hk let h e n 2 x 1 x 1 xn xn n 2 e r 2 2 x 21 x 2 n 2 f 2 x 21 x 2 n 2 then an easy calculation shows that h e 2 e h f 2 f and e f h i e sl 2 c span c h e f observe that the action of this differential operators commutes with the action of o n r furthermore for all k 0 hk c r 2 d k n 2 where d k n 2 is an irreducible lowest weight representation of sl 2 c with lowest weight k n 2 this representation integrates to a discrete series representation of s l 2 r the double cover of sl 2 r let a d k n 2 k 0 s l 2 r and define a o n r by d k n 2 hk 100 then since the d k n 2 are square integrable it s clear that l 2 sn 1 a d where is the plancherel measure of s l 2 r we will now describe a family of examples of this kind of correspondence where the space x is not a spherical variety what this examples will show is that the ideas discussed here have applications beyond the spherical variety setting to construct this examples we will use howe s theory of dual pairs let s p n r be the double cover of the symplectic group sp n r there is a special representation of s p n r on l 2 rn called the oscillator representation 10 let g 1 g 2 s p n r be two reductive subgroups we say that they form a reductive dual pair if one group is the centralizer of the other one in s p n r and viceversa in this case howe duality theory states that if we restrict the oscillator representation to the subgroup generated by g 1 and g 2 then l 2 rn g 1 d for some measure where is an irreducible representation of g 2 even more we will focus on the dual pair sp m r o p q sp m p q r let s start with the case m 1 in this case howe has shown that if p q 2 l 2 o p 1 q o p q s l 2 r wh d where is the plancherel measure of sp m r and wh v c n v n v for all n n for some generic character of the unipotent radical n of some minimal parabolic subgroup p man on the other hand wallach 24 has shown that l 2 n s l 2 r s l 2 r wh d 101 where l 2 n s l 2 r f s l 2 r c f ng r s n f g and n s l 2 r f g 2 dng in other words the plancherel measure of l 2 o p q 1 o p q can be seen as the pullback under the lift of l 2 n s l 2 r we will now consider the dual pair sp m r o p q sp m p q r with m 1 we will assume that we are in the stable range that is p q m let p man be a siegel parabolic subgroup with given langlands decomposition let be a generic character of n in this case generic means that the orbit of in n under the action of m is open let m m m m 1 nm n be the stabilizer of in m then there is a natural action of m g on l 2 n s p m r f s p m r c f ng n f g and n s p m r f g 2 dng theorem 3 1 1 as a m g module l 2 n s p m r g m w d d where are the plancherel measures of s p m r and m respectively and w is some multiplicity space that depends on and furthermore if m is compact then w wh where wh v v mn v n m v for all m m n n the purpose of this chapter is to use the explicit formulas for the action of p g on the oscillator representation and this result to show that theorem 3 1 2 if r s m then there exists a generic character r s of n such that l 2 o p r q s o p q s p m r m r s w r s d d 102 3 2 howe duality for the symplectic and the or thogonal group consider the dual pair sp m r o p q sp mn r with n p q and p q 2 m the last condition asserts that we are in the stable range let p mn be the siegel parabolic subgroup of sp m r with given langlands decomposition in the theory of the oscillator representation there are very explicit formulas for the action of p o p q on l 2 rmn 1 16 17 18 to simplify the exposition we will only consider the case where n is even the case n odd is very similar but involves taking a double cover of sp m r to write down the explicit action on the oscillator representation we will identify rmn with hom rm rn and we will fix a unitary character of r the action is then given by i x i t trxt tip qt t 3 1 a a t t deta n 2 ta a gl m r 3 2 g t g 1 t g o p q 3 3 where t hom rm rn using this formulas we will describe l 2 hom rm rn as a representation of p o p q let u t hom rm rn t is of maximal rank and the inner product on t rm is non degenerated observe that u hom rm rn is open dense and its complement has mea sure 0 let r s 0 be a pair of integers such that r s m and define ur s t u t r m has signature r s it s then clear that u r s m ur s and hence l 2 hom rm rn r s m l 2 ur s 3 4 103 by looking at the formulas for the action of p o p q on l 2 hom rm rn it is easy to check that the subspaces l 2 ur s are p o p q invariant we will now describe l 2 ur s as a p o p q module let tr s ur s be given by tr sei ep r i and define a character r s on n by the formula r s i x i trxt tr sip qtr s trxir s let mr s m m r s mnm 1 r s n be the stabilizer of r s in m we will now identify m with gl m r observe that then mr s gets identified with o r s on the other hand we can define an embedding of o r s o p r q s into o p q by identifying o p r q s with the subgroup of o p q that fixes every element in the image of tr s and o r s with the subgroup that fixes every element in the orthogonal complement of the image of tr s with this identifications in mind let hr s be the stabilizer of tr s in m o p q observe that there is a subgroup that we will denote by o r s of hr s such that o r s o r s o r s m o p q and hr s o r s o p r q s n then from equations 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 we have that l 2 ur s ind p o p q hr sn 1 r s ind p o p q o r s o p r q s n 1 1 r s ind p o r s n l 2 o p r q s o p q r s 3 5 where o p q acts on the right on l 2 o p r q s o p q and o r s acts on the left then from equations 3 4 and 3 5 l 2 hom rm rn r s m indpo r s n l 2 o p r q s o p q r s 3 6 now we will describe the mixed model of the oscillator representation observe that since p q 2 m there exists a polarization rn x u y such that x and y are totally isotropic complementary subspaces and dimx dim y 2 m let b stabx g o p q gx x be the stabilizer of x and let b mbnb 104 be its langlands decomposition we will now describe the mixed model of the oscillator representation relative to the polarization rn x u y observe that rmn r 2 m r 2 m rm rn 4 m identifying r 2 m r 2 m and rm rn 4 m with end r 2 m and hom rm rn 4 m respectively we have that l 2 rmn l 2 end r 2 m l 2 hom rm rn 4 m where we interpretate l 2 end r 2 m l 2 hom rm rn 4 m as the space of square integrable functions on end r 2 m with values in l 2 hom rm rn 4 m now iden tifying mb with gl 2 m r o p 2 m q 2 m gl x o u we have that the action of sp m r mb is given by a t s deta m a 1 t s a gl 2 m r 3 7 h t s h 1 t s 3 8 g t s g tg s g sp m r 3 9 where t end r 2 m s hom rm rn 4 m and l 2 hom rm rn 4 m is the oscillator representation associated to the dual pair sp m r o u now observe that gl 2 m r end r 2 m is open dense and its complement has mea sure 0 therefore if i 2 m end r 2 m is the identity map then as a sp 2 m r gl 2 m r module l 2 rnm ind sp m r gl 2 m r stabi 2 m 1 l 2 hom rm rn 4 m sp m r ind gl 2 m r sp m r l 2 hom rm rn 4 m d where is the plancherel measure of sp m r hence from the abstract theory of howe duality l 2 rmn p o p q sp m r p d 3 10 in the stable range the representation has been determined by the work of jian shu li 12 among others we are thus left with the problem of decomposing an irreducible tempered representation of sp m r when restricted to p now let s look at l 2 sp m r as a p sp m r module we claim that we have an isomorphism l 2 sp m r l 2 n e 105 where e is a measurable bundle over n with fibers e ind sp m r n for any given n and is a haar measure on n the isomorphism is given in the following way given f l 2 sp m r define sf l 2 n e by sf g n n 1 f ng dn where dn is the usual lebesgue measure on n the way we should interpret the above formula is that we have an isomorphism l 2 sp m r ind sp m r n ind n 1 1 ind sp m r n l 2 n and in the last expression we take the fourier transform on l 2 n with this convention the measure on n is the measure dual to dn now by definition srg 1 f g n n 1 rg 1 f ng dn n n 1 f ngg 1 dn sf gg 1 rg 1 sf g and slpf g n n 1 lpf ng dn n n 1 f p 1 npp 1 g dn n pnp 1 1 p f np 1 g dn n p 1 n 1 p f np 1 g dn p sf p 1 p 1 g p lpsf p 1 g where is the modular function of p this means that the action of p sp m r on l 2 n e is given by a vector bundle action and hence if is the set of open orbits for the action of m on n then r s m r s where r s is the orbit of the character r s defined before therefore l 2 sp m r l 2 n e r s m ind p sp m r mr sn sp m r ind sp m r n r s r s m ind p sp m r mr sn sp m r l 2 n sp m r r s 106 but then according to equation 2 57 l 2 sp m r r s m indpmr sn sp m r o r s w r s d d r s 3 11 where is the plancherel measure of o r s and r s is the bessel plancherel mea sure on the other hand the harish chandra plancherel theorem says that l 2 sp m r sp m r p d 3 12 now from equations 3 12 and 3 11 we conclude that p r s m o r s w r s ind p m n d 3 13 from this and equation 3 10 we have that l 2 hom rm rn sp m r p d r s m sp m r o r s w r s ind p m n d d r s 3 14 but then from this and equation 3 6 we have that as an o r s o p q module l 2 o p r q s o p q sp m r o r s w r s d d r s 3 3 the dual pair sl 2 r o v outside stable range the results obtained in the former section can be further refined when we restrict ourselves to the case n 1 i e to the dual pair sl 2 r o v 3 3 1 the case o v o n from classical invariant theory we know that as an sl 2 r o n module l 2 rn k 0 hk c r 2 107 where hk are the harmonic polynomials of degree k and sl 2 r acts via the operators e r 2 2 f 2 h e n 2 where e is the euler operator in this case the correspondence relates the irreducible representations of o n on hk with the irreducible representations of s l 2 r with lowest weight k n 2 3 3 2 the case o v o p 1 we will now consider the dual pair sl 2 r o p 1 once again we will only consider the case where n p 1 is even and leave to the reader the modifications needed for the case where n is odd let p mn sl 2 r be the minimal parabolic subgroup consisting of all upper triangular matrices with given langlands decomposition let e 1 en be the canonical basis of r n and assume that we have an inner product such that ei ej 0 if i 6 j ei ei 1 for 1 i p and en en 1 then the oscillator representation associated to the dual pair sl 2 r o p 1 can be realized on the space l 2 rn and the action of p o p 1 is given by the following formulas 1 x 1 v x v v f v x r 3 15 1 v n 2 v r 3 16 g v g 1 v g o p 1 3 17 where v rn let u v rn v v 6 0 then u is open dense and its complement has measure 0 observe that u u u where u v r n v v 0 and u v r n v v 0 hence l 2 rn l 2 u l 2 u 3 18 we will identify o p r with the subgroup of o p 1 that fixes en o p 1 1 with the subgroup of o p 1 fixing e 1 and o 1 r with the center of sl 2 r we will 108 also set h stabe 1 and h staben then putting everything together we get that l 2 u ind p o p 1 h n 1 ind p o 1 r nl 2 o p 1 1 o p 1 3 19 and l 2 u ind p o p 1 h n 1 ind p o 1 r nl 2 o p r o p 1 3 20 where 1 x 1 eix and 1 x 1 e ix x r now we will describe the mixed model for the oscillator representation associ ated to a complete polarization rn x u y observe that dimx dim y 1 let b stabx g o p 1 gx x and let b mbnb be a langlands decomposition observe that mb r o p 1 r where r r 0 since rn r 2 rp 1 we can identify l 2 rn with l 2 r 2 l 2 rp 1 which we interpretate as the space of square integrable functions on r 2 with values on l 2 rp 1 with this conventions the action of sl 2 r mb is given by the following formulas x y v 1 1 x 1 y v for r 3 21 h x y v x y h 1 v for h o p 1 r 3 22 g x y v p 1 g x y g v for g sl 2 r 3 23 where x y r v rp 1 and p 1 l 2 rp 1 is the oscillator representation associated to the dual pair sl 2 r o p 1 r now observe that r 2 0 and r p 1 0 are open dense subsets of r 2 and rp 1 respectively and its complements have measure 0 from this observation and equations 3 21 3 22 and 3 23 we have that as an sl 2 r mb module l 2 rn ind sl 2 r r hn l 2 rp 1 109 where h 1 r sl 2 r r let 1 be the subgroup of h whose projection onto r is precisely 1 then l 2 rp 1 ind sl 2 r r hn l 2 rp 1 ind sl 2 r r hn ind hn 1 nl 2 sp 2 ind sl 2 r n ind r 1 l 2 sp 2 where sp 2 rp 1 is the p 2 dimensional sphere from all this formulas it is immediate that l 2 rn p o p 1 sl 2 r p d 3 24 where is the plancherel whittaker measure of l 2 n sl 2 r finally from the usual plancherel whittaker theorem 24 we have that if h is a tempered representation of sl 2 r then p ind p o 1 r nwh indpo 1 r nwh but then from equations 3 18 3 19 3 20 and 3 24 we have that l 2 o p 1 1 o p 1 sl 2 r wh d 3 25 and l 2 o p r o p 1 sl 2 r wh d 3 26 observe that l 2 o p r o p 1 has no discrete spectrum effectively from equa tion 3 26 only the theta lift of a representation with a positive and a negative whittaker model can
