short title baryons from u 3 neutron to proton mass difference parton distribution functions and baryon resonances from dynamics on the lie group u 3 ole l trinhammer department of physics technical university of denmark fysikvej building 307 dk 2800 kongens lyngby denmark ole trinhammer fysik dtu dk we present a hamiltonian structure on the lie group u 3 to describe the baryon spectrum the ground state is identified with the proton from this single fit we calculate approximately the relative neutron to proton mass shift to within half a percentage of the experimental value from the same fit we calculate the nucleon and delta resonance spectrum with correct grouping and no missing resonances for specific spin eigenfunctions we calculate the delta to nucleon mass ratio to within one percent finally we derive parton distribution functions that compare well with those for the proton valence quarks the distributions are generated by projecting the proton state to space via the exterior derivative on u 3 we predict scarce neutral flavour singlets which should be visible in neutron diffraction dissociation experiments or in invariant mass spectra of protons and negative pions in b decays and in photoproduction on neutrons the presence of such singlet states distinguishes experimentally the present model from the standard model as does the prediction of the neutron to proton mass splitting conceptually the hamiltonian may describe an effective phenomenology or more radically describe interior dynamics implying quarks and gluons as projections from u 3 which we then call allospace pacs numbers 12 90 b 14 20 gk 14 20 dh 1 introduction the quark flavour model has a missing resonance pro blem since it predicts many more baryon n resonances than observed 1 2 3 the quark colour model qcd has a confinement problem to construct hadrons analy tically from quarks and gluons we are aware of the successes of qcd in pertubative domains 4 5 and in lattice gauge theory 6 7 nevertheless we want to stress the two first mentioned issues the latter the confine ment problem motivated a radical approach which solves the former as a by product we construct the dynam ics in a compact space the spectroscopy can live there and manifest itself in real space as different mass reso nances then we will have confinement per construction and can hope to see quarks and gluons by projection from the compact configuration space to the laboratory space we will present here a study of this idea we shall call it the allospatial hypothesis from the greek word al los meaning another or different in general terms the idea is that a hamiltonian description is the more nat ural framework for spectroscopy and the lagrangian de scription more suitable for scattering phenomena see e g 8 the defining equation is a group space hamiltonian on u 3 where the toroidal degrees of freedom project out in colour quark fields and gluons come out by an adjoint projection it turns out that there is also room for flavour in the model and we can reproduce an okubo mass formula involving hypercharge and isospin we note from the beginning that u 3 is not to be thought of as a symmetry group but as a configuration space the allospatial hypothesis is evolved in sect 2 here a specific hamiltonian is stated the underlying quanti zations defined and a projection of the group space wave function into real space quark and gluon fields given the projection is shown in appendix a to lead to fields trans forming properly as respectively fundamental and adjoint representations of su 3 appendix a concludes from the projection to laboratory space we recognize the toroidal generators as momentum operators thus when experimental production of resonances is of concern we see from space the impact momentum generates the abelian maximal torus of the u 3 allospace the mo mentum operators act as introtangling generators when decay asymptotic freedom fragmentation and confine ment is of concern we see from allospace the quark and gluon fields are projections of the vector fields induced by the momentum form d with this interpretation of the origin of quarks we see that the quarks are confined per construction since the lie group of allospace is com pact and thus cannot be projected in its global totallity you cannot peel an orange without breaking the skin as differential topologists say see fig 1 the theory is unfolded in sect 3 the laplacian is parametrized in a polar decomposition analogous to the treatment of the hydrogen atom in polar coordinates we shall see that the laplacian contains a term naturally in terpreted as a centrifugal potential it includes the off toroidal generators of the group and thereby carries the complexity needed to include spin and flavour spectral characteristics alongside the basic colour dynamics as an example we calculate matrix elements of our hamil ar x iv 1 10 9 47 32 v 3 he p th 2 5 ju n 20 12 2 tonian with symmetrized d functions of specific angular momentum and find a very promising ratio when com pared with m 1232 mn 939 energy eigenstates are discussed in sect 4 and both approximate and exact solutions given for the neutral flavour n and sectors together with tentative spin parity assignments the number and grouping of reso nances agrees with all the certain four star resonances listed by the particle data group without a missing reso nance problem in sect 5 we give a controversial interpretation rela ting period doublings in the wavefunction to the creation of charge in the neutron decay the mass shift related to this interpretation is quite promising with a relative mass difference of 0 13847 between the neutron and proton mass predicted from the approximate solutions to be compared with the experimental value of 0 13784 in sect 6 we discuss experimental predictions apart from predicting all the observed certain resonances our model predicts scarce neutral flavour singlets in sect 7 we list some open questions together with selected parton distribution functions and in sect 8 we give concluding remarks the present work contains five appendicies in ap pendix a we give the projection to space in appendix b we derive the spectrum of the off toroidal generators of our group space laplacian in appendix c we describe the rayleigh ritz method used to solve the exact case for neutral charge states and calculate analytically the ma trix elements of the rayleigh ritz method when this is used on trigonometric base functions in appendix d we derive parton distribution functions in appendix e we give a survey of those concepts in differential geometry most crucial for the calculations in appendicies a and d 2 the allospatial hypothesis the communication between the interior dynamics and the spacetime dynamics runs through the exterior derivative of the state on the chosen configuration space so the characteristics of the fields we wish to generate by the exterior derivative implies which configuration space should be hypothesized we wish to generate projec tion fields transforming under the su 3 algebra with the fields possibly being electrically charged this points to a configuration space containing both su 3 and u 1 thus we choose the lie group u 3 as configuration space and assume the following hamiltonian c a 1 2 1 2 d 2 e u u e u 1 it is the hypothesis of the present work that the eigen states of 1 describe the baryon spectrum with u u 3 being the configuration variable of a sole baryonic entity and a is a scale below we shall find exact solutions of 1 for alleged n states and we shall discuss approximate solutions for both alleged n and states it should be fig 1 the algebra approximates the group in the neigh bourhood of origo the allospace in the present work is the lie group u 3 in which the dynamics is supposed to describe the baryon spectrum as a set of stationary states of a certain hamiltonian projecting from the group to the algebra gene rates quark and gluon fields according to the representation space chosen mentioned that when unfolded the structure of 1 car ries degrees of freedom for both colour spin hypercharge and isospin the laplacian in 1 is parametrized in the next section the configuration variable u ei and the trace of its squared argument tr 2 d 2 e u is used in the representation independent potential so the potential is half the squared geodetic distance 9 from the point u to the origo e d 2 e u 21 2 2 2 3 j 2 where ei j are the eigenvalues of u the geodetic distance may be seen as the euclidean measure folded into the group manifold 10 the geodetic distance is invariant under translation in group space as it should be since the choice of origo is arbitrary d v uv d e v 1 uv d e u 3 planck s constant h 2 enters the description via the canonical quantization behind eq 1 the speed of light c and the scale a enter the description from a parametrization of the eigenangles via either a time parameter t or a space parameter x a ct this gives the scale c a for the dimensionful eigenva lues e the ground state eigenvalue e e c a of 3 fig 2 periodic parametric potential 17 originating from the squared geodetic distance 2 from u to the origo e in the lie group milnor 9 the dashed curve corresponds to the wilson analogue 11 of the manton potential 12 and is not considered in the present work the dimensionless edition 10 of 1 is of the order of 4 5 predicting a promising scale a 1 fm if the dimensionful ground state eigenvalue is identified with the nucleon e 939 mev reversing the argument a is to be determined experimentally by fixing the ground state energy of 1 to that of the nucleon it turns out that c a 210 mev in fine agreement with the average qcd scale e g 5 m s in 13 we denote the configuration variable u by a lower case letter and accordingly the lie group space to make it clear that u is a configuration variable and not a priori a symmetry transformation we parametrize the confi guration variable by u ei ktk where tk for k 4 9 are the off toroidal gell mann generators 14 whereas tj for j 1 2 3 are toroidal generators and j j we have toroidal coordinate fields j implied by the abelian toroidal generators j uei tj 0 uitj 4 the basic action angle quantization condition 1 with tj i j i j e reads j i ij d i j ij 5 for i j 1 2 3 where d i are the torus forms the scale a enters the model when the three toroidal degrees of freedom are related to the three spatial degrees of freedom by the following projection xj a j 6 thus we define parametric momentum operators pj pro portional to the toroidal generators pj i 1 a j a tj 7 whereby the canonical action angle quantization of 5 translates into position momentum quantization a i pj i ij a i a j pi pj 0 8 it is via 6 and 8 that the physical dimensions enter the model 1 the state projects out on laboratory space via d where j and j is the jacobian 13 of our parametrization for instance the restriction of the mo mentum form d to the torus d jd j 9 generates a member of the fundamental representation of su 3 the coefficients in 9 are the components of the alleged colour quark spacetime field whose transforma tion properties are shown in appendix a 3 the theory unfolded to study the stationary states of 1 let us rewrite the schro dinger equation in a dimensionless form with e e 1 2 1

which may be interpreted in the hamiltonian as additional potentials a constant global curvature 15 potential 1 2 2 1 and a centrifugal potential c 1 2 3 i j k 6 i j k 2 k m 2 k 8 sin 2 1 2 i j 12 further the van de monde determinant the jacobian of our parametrization is j 3 i j 2 sin 1 2 i j 13 and with 1 the off diagonal gell mann generators are 16 17 18 19 k 1 7 k 2 5 k 3 2 14 m 1 6 m 2 4 m 3 1 kk commute as body fixed angular momentum opera tors and mk connect the algebra by commuting into the subspace of kk mk ml kk kl ikm cyclic in k l m 15 the presence of the components of k k 1 k 2 k 3 in the laplacian operator opens for the description of spin 4 interpreting k as the allospatial spin operator is encour aged by the body fixed signature of the commutation re lations the relation between space and allospace is like the relation in nuclear physics between fixed coordinate systems and intrinsic body fixed coordinate systems for the description of rotational degrees of freedom once k 2 and e g k 3 have been chosen to be independent and mu tually commuting operators both commuting with the hamiltonian h of 1 the presence of m m 1 m 2 m 3 in the laplacian makes it possible to describe flavour via the spectrum of m 2 see below substituting 11 into 10 we get the fully parametrized schro dinger equation 1 2 3 j 1 1 j 2 2 j j 2 3 i j k 6 i j k 2 k m 2 k 8 sin 2 1 2 i j v 1 v 2 v 3 u e u 16 where the potential 1 2 d 2 spells out as a sum of periodic chopped harmonic oscillator potentials the potential 17 is shown in fig 2 v 1 2 n 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 where n z 17 we may assume the wavefunction to be an eigenstate of k 2 and m 2 and thus write it as a product of a toroidal part like the radial wavefunction for the hydrogen atom and an off toroidal part km like the spherical harmonics ylm with 1 2 3 we thus write u 1 2 3 km 4 5 6 7 8 9 18 it should be noted that in determining the spectrum for m 2 we exploit the possibility of choosing specific eigen states of hypercharge and isospin 3 component as shown in appendix b and thus instead of km we might had written ky i 3 multiplying 16 by the jacobian j we introduce a new function u r km where r j 19 then satisfies e 2 3 i j k 6 i j k 2 k m 2 k 8 sin 2 1 2 i j 2 3 j 1 v j u 2 e u 20 where the euclidean laplacian is e 3 j 1 2 2 j 21 now we integrate out the off diagonal degrees of free dom 4 5 9 to get an equation for the torodial part rkm for specific eigenvalues k k 1 and m 2 of respectively k 2 and m 2 e v rkm 1 2 3 2 erkm 1 2 3 22 here the curvature and centrifugal terms of the group space laplacian have been collected with the geodetic distance potential into a total potential v v 2 1 3 k k 1 m 2 3 i j 1 8 sin 2 1 2 i j 2 v 1 v 2 v 3 23 in the centrifugal term during the integration we have exploited the existence of the haar measure over 4 5 9 together with the factorization 18 fur ther we have used that the off toroidal part of the wave function is an eigenstate of k 2 and m 2 together with the fact that the centrifugal term 12 is symmetric under in terchange of the torus angles j the centrifugal term leads to a mass formula of the well known okubo type 20 in appendix b we derive the spectrum of k 2 m 2 and show the following relation among quantum numbers k k 1 m 2 4 3 n 3 2 2 3 1 3 y 2 4 i 23 24 here y is the hypercharge i 3 is the three component of isospin and n is an integer which we may call hyperdi mension it is natural in the present framework to classify the eigenstates according to the three independent values of n y and i 3 however we can make a transformation of this classification into the familiar one by rewriting the expression 24 and choose the sum of hyperdimension and hypercharge to be a constant for n y 2 which yields the lowest possible k k 1 m 2 we get k k 1 m 2 40 3 k 23 m 2 3 28 3 y 4 1 4 y 2 i i 1 25 since k 23 m 2 3 commutes with both y and i 2 we get for a given value of k 23 m 2 3 k k 1 m 2 a b y c 1 4 y 2 i i 1 26 equation 26 is the famous okubo mass formula that reproduces the gell mann okubo ne eman mass rela tions within the baryon n octet and decuplet 17 20 21 22 independently of the values of a b and c of course this is only so if one chooses the same toroidal wavefunction for all members of a given multiplet in practice the su 3 symmetry breaking in 26 will be influenced by the dependence in 23 because different values of k 2 m 2 lead to different values of the centrifu gal potential and thereby influence which span of toroidal energy eigenstates will project out on a specific angular momentum eigenstate in the laboratory 5 3 2 total angular momentum all members of an su 3 multiplet have the same total angular momentum and therefore it would seem natural to let this be carried by the structure of the toroidal wave function as a possible base one may try d functions the d functions are eigenfunctions of angular momen tum 23 j 2 d j k m j j 1 d j k m 27 now the d functions are functions of the euler angles describing rotations between a fixed coordinate system and body fixed coordinates 24 they are simultane ously eigenfunctions of the three component of angular momentum in coordinate space and in body fixed space with eigenvalues m and k respectively where m and k may vary in integer steps from j to j 25 26 de spite the notation no a priori relation is intended between k m and k m in a specific example below however we shall test the identification j k in the present connection we may interpret the fixed coordinate system as the laboratory space and the body fixed space as al lospace since a priori there is no prevailing direction in laboratory space the states should have no specific three component of angular momentum thus states should be constructed by summing over m and since the labeling of the eigenangles in allospace is arbitrary we should ex pand on states that are symmetric under interchange of the eigenangles therefore a possible expression for the nucleon ground state wave function with j k 1 2 could be t 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 t 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 t 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 t 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 n 1 2 28 where n 1 2 is a normalization factor and t 1 2 1 2 is a sum over the two d functions for the two possible values 1 2 and 1 2 of m corresponding to total angular momentum j 1 2 t 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 1 2 e i 1 2 cos 2 2 e i 3 2 e i 1 2 sin 2 2 ei 3 2 29 for total angular momentum j 3 2 there will be four terms in 29 corresponding to the allowed values of m 3 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 it is encouraging for this line of investigation to note that jt 3 2 3 2 hr jt 3 2 3 2 jt 1 2 1 2 hr jt 1 2 1 2 1 32 m 1232 mn 939 1 31 30 here hr is the allospatial hamiltonian in the exact form in 22 and the result in 30 is for the lowest possi ble value of k 2 m 2 like in table 1 the value of fig 3 all observed certain neutral flavour baryons boxes compared with approximate allospatial predictions lines from eq 31 with label combinations based on table 2 the dashed line is a predicted neutral charge state without charged partners the red lines mark states with augmented contribu tion in level 3 the boxes indicate the experimental range of peak values 27 not the widths which are much larger the systematic errors in the approximation are of the order of 50 mev digits at selected allospatial states are the toroidal la bels l m n note the fine agreement in the grouping and the number of resonances in both sectors with just one fitting at p 1 2 3 jt 1 2 1 2 hr jt 1 2 1 2 in 30 is 5 93 and fitting this to the nucleon rest energy 939 6 mev corresponds to a scale a 1 2 fm it is also reassuring to note that the numerical eigenvalue 5 93 is rather close to the value 0 5111 0 0855 5 98 of the nucleon ground state in a favoured choice of parameters for lattice calculations shown in table 5 of 7 3 3 energy eigenstates equation 22 can be solved by a rayleigh ritz method for details see appendix c the eigenvalues of the full equation 22 are listed in table 1 for the low est possible value of k 2 m 2 here we have expanded r on slater determinants of trigonometric functions of increasing order 44 in table 4 consistency is shown by comparison with exact results for 22 by expansions on slater determinants of parametric eigenfunctions 33 in table 1 are shown also possible identifications with 6 baryon resonances we see that all the n resonances which the particle data group considers certain 27 are present except n 1520 thus the general tendency is promising but the predicted energy values are in need of improvement such an improvement is seen if instead of comparing the energy of the electrically neutral part ners of each n resonance one looks at the energy of the charged partner the energies of the charged partners are calculated below for an approximate case and the comparison is shown in fig 3 in sect 6 we shall return to the question of n 1520 4 approximate solutions here we omit the constant curvature potential and the centrifugal potential they are of the same order of mag nitude and of opposite sign see sect 5 we may then expect to keep the general structure of the spectrum we shall introduce a new degree of freedom to be related to the electric charge having integrated out the off toroidal degrees of free dom in 19 we are lead to an approximate edition of 22 namely the following seperable equation 1 2 3 j 1 2 2 j v 1 v 2 v 3 r 1 2 3 er 1 2 3 31 with both the laplacian and the potential now being just sums the equation separates into three schro dinger equations for parametric eigenfunctions with periodic boundary conditions 1 2 2 2 j 1 2 2 j i j ei i j j 32 figure 4 shows to the left the first eight parametric eigenfunctions the eigenstate in 18 is symme tric in the eigenangles as the labelling of angles in the parametrization is arbitrary j is antisymmetric in to tal r 1 2 3 is antisymmetric and may be constructed 28 as a slater determinant of three freely chosen ortho gonal l m n parametric eigenfunctions rlmn l 1 l 2 l 3 m 1 m 2 m 3 n 1 n 2 n 3 33 substituting the km indices each state thus gets three toroidal labels l m n the labels of the parametric eigen functions the eigenvalues e of 31 are sums of three different parametric eigenvalues e i l m n ei for instance we will have e e 1 e 2 e 3 for 123 1 j 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 34 fig 4 periodic parametric eigenfunctions 32 from which the toroidal part 34 of the wavefunction of approximate states are constructed eigenstates of diminished eigenval ues are shown to the right the exact functions in 22 can be found from an expansion on such states or on a base set 44 mimicking these parametric eigenfunctions by sines and cosines of increasing order we may interpret the antisymmetry under interchange of the columns in the slater determinant r as a colour antisymmetry under interchange of the eigenangles of u to keep a uniform probability measure in group space when seen from parameter space it is that we would like to project to space and not because the external derivative is linear d inherits the antisymmetry of and carries it through to the projection space e g d 2 1 3 d 1 2 3 d 1 2 3 35 4 2 parity we might expect a winding number effect in km due to the increasing number of oscillations in the base func tions such a winding number effect may be expressed in specific partial waves to which the allospatial state re lates in space this would explain the general trend of increasing total angular momentum with increasing en ergy the idea is supported by table 5 where we see the allospatial states together with spin and parity of the n resonance candidates we can give an ad hoc assign ment of parity according to each particular combination 7 of toroidal labels l m n namely p 1 m l 1 n m 36 which in general reduces to p 1 n l the assign ment 36 gives a rather consistent correlation to the observed resonances with only a few exceptions namely for the singlet states like 135 see below which seems to mix with ordinary doublet n states to yield a state with reversed parity there also seems to be a correla tion between increments in toroidal label number and in crements in angular momentum a tentative trend being j m n in series like 125 127 147 1 2 5 2 9 2 and 134 136 156 1 2 5 2 9 2 this confirms the winding number effect using the parity assignment 36 and the trend j m we predict from the series 235 237 257 3 2 7 2 11 2 a jp value of 11 2 for the allospatial state 257 with approximate energy 2542 mev in accordance with the three star rated n 2600 27 although promising the spin parity assignments in table 5 is just a tentative number game we shall now give a more specific suggestion we return to the projection a j xj and construct parity eigenstates t t t and t t t 37 based on states like 28 identifying the operation of the parity operator p on x with a similar operation on the allospace eigenangles would ensure that the states t have intrinsic parity 1 p t t t 38 since p h 0 states are possible with simultaneous p and e eigenvalues a state like t 1 2 1 2 in 28 is then split into two with specific parity the presence of two different parity states for each angular momentum fits very well with the pattern of the observed certain n resonances such states might be the spin parity definite states through which the spin parity indeterminate en ergy eigenstates of parametric function slater determi nants like 33 communicate with the partial wave am plitudes of the experimental analysis 4 3 bloch states now let us return to the question of solving 31 and 32 the basic trick in exploring the full structure of u 3 and solving the parametric eq 32 is to introduce bloch waves ei g and get a set of eigenvalue bands see fig 5 here g is the 2 periodic part belonging to the bloch wave number choosing 0 gives us 2 periodicity of the parametric functions corresponding to the periodicity of the parametric potential for the state with lowest eigenvalue in this case e e 1 e 2 e 3 4 474172455 see table 6 if we choose 2 12 in level fig 5 reduced zone scheme 29 for allospatial parametric eigenvalues the black dots represent the values for the un stable neutron state left and the proton state right for clarity the variation of the eigenvalues with wave number is grossly exaggerated for the lowest states 2 it will lead to a lower lying parametric eigenstate which we can couple to a compensating 1 12 in level 1 we thus couple two bloch waves 1 e i 1 g 1 and 2 e i 2 g 2 from the two lowest lying eigenvalue bands in the reduced zone scheme to the right in fig 5 this combination is possible because the energy gained by the period doubling in level 2 is larger than the energy lift needed to cause period doubling in level 1 note that the parametric eigenstates of the first and second levels now have 4 periodicity in the eigenangles this is possible since we only require 2 and not nescessarily to be single valued on u 3 after a single rotation in the parameters j cf the case of a spin 1 2 particle like the free electron which needs a 4 rotation for its state to return to its original value 30 other values of than 0 and 1 2 are not in accordance with the single valuedness of 2 the lower eigenvalue after this coupled decay is e e 1 e 2 e 3 4 467985519 which we interpret as the proton ground state with this interpretation we predict from our approximate calculation the relative difference between the neutron mass mn and the proton mass mp mn mp mp e e e 4 474172455 4 467985519 4 467985519 0 138473 39 the result in 39 is in close agreement with the experi mentally determined value 27 mn mp mp 939 565346 mev 938 272013 mev 938 272013 mev 0 137842 40 8 it is encouraging that the approximate calculation gives a too high mass splitting one may namely expect the eigenvalue bands to narrow slightly in an exact solution because of the spikes from the centrifugal potential which has been omitted in our above calculation and which will effectively leave the levels in a deeper potential well on the other hand one may fear that the resulting level shifts might be too large in order to keep the fine agreement indicated by 39 and 40 however the neutron state shifts only two per cent downwards to 4 38 for the ex act solution in table 1 actually the jacobian 13 kills the wave function exactly at the location of the singu larities of the centrifugal potential so we may hope that the shifting effect on the proton state will be just what we would need in order to diminish the still significant discrepancy between the prediction in 39 and the very accurate observations in 40 where the uncertainties on both masses are 0 000023 mev which means that the uncertainty lies on the last digit in 40 5 charge interpretation and systematic error we interpret the period doublings in the diminished ground state topology as creator of the proton charge in the neutron decay thus is interpreted as a charge quantum number degree of freedom which express the coupling between allospatial structure and the spacetime fields of the electroweak interaction the interpretation is supported by the structure of the implied proton state 1 2 3 1 j e i 1 2 1 g 1 1 e i 1 2 2 g 1 2 e i 1 2 3 g 1 3 ei 1 2 1 g 2 1 e i 1 2 2 g 2 2 e i 1 2 3 g 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 41 we see that the period doublings induce u 1 factors curled up in the slater determinant thereby trapping the charge topologically note that u 1 is the gauge group of the electromagnetic interaction the diminished parametric function in the second row of the determinant in 41 is shown to the right in fig 4 and the lifted one in the first row is shown in fig 6 the decay seems to couple inherently to spin degrees of freedom since the two bloch wave phase factors render the measure scaled wave function r 1 2 3 e i 1 2 1 g 1 1 e i 1 2 2 g 1 2 e i 1 2 3 g 1 3 ei 1 2 1 g 2 1 e i 1 2 2 g 2 2 e i 1 2 3 g 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 42 with a structure resembling sums of d functions 32 for instance d 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 e i 1 2 1 d 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 e i 1 2 3 e i 1 2 1 sin 1 2 2 e i 1 2 3 43 fig 6 the first lifted parametric eigenstate with periodicity 4 the eigenvalue is found by collocation with 1500 points in matlab and the corresponding eigenstate is generated by solving in maple the one dimensional schro dinger equation 32 for the particular eigenvalue see 31 for programs is related to a particular rotation of spinors for the case of spin 1 2 33 34 we may even imagine that the decay with its simultaneous period doublings in two parametric levels generates two component structures to carry away the excess energy it is beyond the scope of the present work to show that these structures might be the electron and its antineutrino 35 instead of expansions on the parametric eigenfunctions 33 we could also use the rayleigh ritz method for solv ing the full 22 and the approximate 31 eqs by expan sions on functions of the type bpqr 1 2 3 cos p 1 cos p 2 cos p 3 sin q 1 sin q 2 sin q 3 cos r 1 cos r 2 cos r 3 ijk cos p i sin q j cos r k 44 where p 0 1 2 q 1 2 r p 1 p 2 and similar with 0 2 or 3 sines the details are laid out in appendix c and it turns out that all matrix elements for this set of base functions can be calculated analyti cally the functions 44 have a structure quite similar to the slater determinant 33 the increasing number of oscillations in the parametric eigenfunctions of 33 is modeled by the increasing order of the cosines and sines the order of magnitude of the omitted terms in 31 i e the constant curvature potential and the centrifugal potential may be evaluated from these base functions for instance b 011 c b 011 b 011 b 011 2 3 45 where c is the centrifugal potential fork 2 1 2 1 2 1 and m 2 13 4 like in table 1 the centrifugal potential more or less cancels the curvature potential 1 and the result 1 3 of the two terms taken together is small compared to the geodetic potential which yields 2 2 see c 12 and c 9 9 6 experimental predictions we determine the scale for the approximate solu tions from the proton rest energy e e 938 3 mev 4 468 210 mev based on this scale the pre dictions are shown in fig 3 the allospatial spectrum agrees with the number and grouping of all the certain resonances in the n and sector it should be stressed that all the observed certain resonances are accounted for by allospatial states by certain we mean all the well established resonances with four stars in the particle data group listings 27 relative to the exact solutions in table 1 the omissions in the approximate solutions re present systematic errors of the order of 50 mev the relative mass splitting between the neutron and the proton resulting from the period doublings in 39 is 0 13847 to be compared with the experimental value of 0 13784 the slightly lighter as opposed to heav ier mass of the charged proton is natural in the present hypothesis states with two even labels like 1 2 4 have the possibility of two parametric eigenvalue diminishing period doublings this will give states with a multiplicity of four the state 1 2 4 is interpreted as the resonance with two diminutions for again the charged part ners are naturally the lighter ones the state 2 4 6 is the first example where all three parametric states can undergo diminution induced period doublings but the complex exponentials are now common factors in each column of the slater determinant so they factorize out thereby releasing the topological trap the determinant regains a parametric 2 periodicity and the state may eventually contribute to neutral resonances the grouping of the resonances agrees quite well with the observed certain states only one certain n resonance is missing in the group of three resonances in the domain around 1500 mev however the approximate treatment in 31 predicts a neutral singlet 1 3 5 at 1510 mev exactly in that area the exact treatment in 22 places the singlet at 1526 mev see table 3 this state is thought to mix with the other two n resonances to give the total of three n resonances in the group the next singlet state 1 3 7 is predicted in the desert area between 1700 mev and 2100 mev in the approximate case of 31 the resonance comes out at 1965 mev and in the exact case of 22 it comes out at 2051 mev table 3 no certain n resonance is observed in this domain being close to the observed resonance domain around 2100 2200 mev the state 1 3 7 may hide itself by mixing with ordinary n states thus it could explain the new resonance n 2040 in mp invariant mass spectra from j p n 36 the singlet 5 7 9 lies just above the free charm threshold for baryonic decay into c 2455 d at 4324 mev 2454 1870 27 and should be visible together with 3 5 11 at 4652 mev in neutron diffraction dissociation experiments like those in ref 37 it should also be visible in n p photoproduction experiments like 38 other lower lying singlets shown in table 3 might be visible in invariant mass mp from b decay experiments like 39 40 7 open questions the present work has three open ends a very specific momentarily halted end a far horizon perspective and finally a more immediate and accessible opening 1 it has not been possible to solve the general eq 22 for the alleged electrically charged states a suitable set of base functions analogues to the uncharged case 44 has not been found 2 the introduction of the charge degree of freedom in 41 is supported by the fact that u 1 is the gauge group generating the electromagnetic interaction this point is in need of elaboration 3 the projection mediated by the exterior derivative relates toroidal parameters to spacetime parameters and transfers structure from the group configuration space into transformation properties of the spacetime fields however we also need to understand how the topology of the allospatial state transfers into angular distribu tions in spacetime partial waves we expect d functions to be involved they are representations of the rota tion group o 3 which happens to be doubly covered by su 2 of which there are three copies in su 3 e g re presented by the three spins u v and i we may then assume that the spin structure in allospace is excited via the generators of the rotation group in laboratory space if we apply the so called clebsh gordan series 41 twice we can reduce a triple product of d functions to a sum over d functions presumably pertaining to the toroidal wavefunctions with specific angular momentum j d j 1 k 1 m 1 d j 2 k 2 m 2 d j 3 k 3 m 3 j c j 1 j 2 j k 1 k 2 c j 1 j 2 j m 1 m 2 d j k 1 k 2 m 1 m 2 d j 3 k 3 m 3 j c j 1 j 2 j k 1 k 2 c j 1 j 2 j m 1 m 2 j c j j 3 j k 1 k 2 k 3 c j j 3 j m 1 m 2 m 3 d j k 1 k 2 k 3 m 1 m 2 m 3 46 10 a systematic investigation of total spin and parity eigenstates based on d functions like 37 seems an ob vious task to undertake from here thus attacking point 3 but we would like to sort out the relation between the structure of the d functions and the toroidal labeling of states on which our present interpretation of charge mul tiplets rests after all the energy eigenstates constructed from expansions on parametric function slater determi nants agree surprisingly well with the observed states as seen in fig 3 further the toroidal parton distributions traced out in appendix d and shown in fig 7 compares rather well in shape with the proton valence quark dis tributions in figs 16 4 of 42 and 6 14 of 43 fig 7 parton distribution functions for a first order ap proximation to an alleged proton ground state of 1 the distributions are traced out by specific toroidal generators tu 2 3 0 1 and td 13 0 1 via the exterior deriva tive 9 see appendix d the curves generated by tu green solid and td red dashed compare both in peak value and relative integral content with the proton valence quark distri butions uv and dv shown in the insert from 42 7 2 on interaction ansatz baryons interact via the harmonic potential their dis tance being measured by the length d u u of the rela tive geodetic where u and u are the configuration vari ables of the respective baryons this leads to two con jectures conjecture 1 the deuteron should be the ground state of the follow ing schro dinger equation c a 1 2 u 1 2 u 1 2 d 2 u u u u e u u 47 conjecture 2 the isotopic landscape should in principle be derivable from a hamiltonian something like ha hz n c a z n i j 1 2 i j a a 1 2 k l 1 2 d 2 uk ul 48 conjecture 1 should be tractable at least numerically by exploiting the translational invariance of the distance measure here one would rewrite d u u d e u 1 u d e u u 49 where in the last expression we have used the unitarity of u in that way we end up with a system of six differ ential equations in the two sets of eigenangles this set is coupled by the potential term 1 2 d 2 e u u 1 2 3 j 1 j j 2 1 2 3 j 1 j j 2 50 conjecture 2 may be tested by studying the decay of tri tium to helium 3 according to our allospatial hypothesis this decay involves period doublings analogous to the de cay of the neutron and thus in principle one should be able to calculate the relative mass difference of 31 h and 3 2 he without knowing the actual mechanism behind the creation of the electron and its antineutrino 8 conclusions we have presented a radical approach to the confine ment problem by shifting the dynamics of strong inter action baryon spectroscopy to a compact configuration space we have developed a hamiltonian framework in which to formulate this dynamics and suggested how the dynamics communicate with spacetime kinematics we have called it the allospatial hypothesis the model has no fitting parameters except the scale which turns out to be 210 mev corresponding to a length scale a 1 fm the number of resonances and their grouping in the n and sectors are reproduced well by eigenstates of a schro dinger equation on u 3 called allospace a quite accurate prediction of the relative neutron to proton mass shift 0 138 follows from approximate solutions to the same schro dinger equation a projection of states to space is given via the exterior derivative this projec tion has shown to yield parton distribution functions that compare rather well with those of the proton va lence quark distributions already in a first order approx imation a kinematic parametrization for the projection gives a natural transition between a confinement domain where the dynamics unfolds in the global group space and an asymptotic free domain where the algebra approxi mates the group a promising ratio between the 1232 and n 939 masses has been calculated based on specific 11 d functions we expect the allospatial energy eigenstate spectrum to project into partial wave amplitude reso nances of specific spin and parity via expansions on spe cific combinations of d functions singlet neutral flavour resonances are predicted above the free charm thresh old of c 2455 d the presence of such singlet states distinguishes experimentally the present model from the standard quark model as does the prediction of the neu tron to proton mass splitting acknowledgments we thank

1 and for any left invariant vector field x we have 44 xuv d lu v xv a 2 in particular we have for our toroidal coordinate fields when comparing with 4 j u e d lu e j e u j e a 3 thus the exterior

so does their sum e as in general j u tmu the set of generators itj are the coordinate field generators j which also constitute an induced base from parameter space j u j u d exp exp 1 u cj a 8 where cj is a set of base vectors for the parameter space for the torus see fig 9 appendix e in our interpretation we identify cj with a base for a fundamental represen tation space for the colour algebra su 3 we may thus introduce complex valued components j for the colour vector and write 1 c 1 2 c 2 3 c 3 1 2 3 a 9 in the above representation u will be represented by a 3 3 matrix u for rotations under v su 3 we then have cj c j v cj a 10 and u u v uv 1 a 11 from a 7 a 10 and a 11 we can derive the transfor mation property of u u u e u u e v uv 1 v e v u e v u a 12 which shows that the differential coefficient vector transforms as a colour vector in the fundamental re presentation under su 3 rotations in other words left invariance in group space projects out as su 3 rotation in projection space we thus interpret in a 7 as a quark field with three colour components which may be projected on a specific base like in a 9 12 likewise the gluon fields may be seen as resulting from a projection on adjoint representation spaces of an expan sion of the momentum form corresponding to the full set of eight generators k needed to parametrize the general group element u ei k k separating out a phase factor 46 thus for each generator ta we have left invariant vector fields a defined as a ei ktkei ta 0 uita a 13 where ta i a i a e we now choose the set ta as a base for the adjoint representation this base transforms under v su 3 like t a v tav 1 a 14 analogous to a 4 we expand the external derivative d on forms related to the left invariant vector fields a to get the

i a x ta a 20 we note that as space time fields the gauge fields also ac quire a term representing the variation along spacetime translations as represented by the second term in a 19 note further that translational invariance in group space corresponds to an su 3 rotational invariance in repre sentation space and thereby the translational invariance of the interaction potential 3 in group space through the projections 6 and 9 reflects the gauge invariance of the fields in laboratory space 1 kinematics using 6 and 7 and suppressing the centrifugal and curvature terms like in 31 the projected schro dinger equation reads 1 2 a 2 xj xj 1 2 1 a 2 d 2 x r x a ea c r x a a 21 in the high energy limit taking e to be the la boratory energy and letting a 0 while the allospatial eigenvalue e ea c remains fixed we see that the pro jected potential blows up and the kinetic term cools down to restrict the support of r to the neighbourhood of origo where the algebra approximates the group see fig 1 compactification loosens up this is a sign of asymptotic freedom in the other extreme taking e e 0 m 0 c 2 we will have a increasing thereby lowering the poten tial such that the wavefunction spreads out in all of the group adjusting e in the experimental set up auto matically determines whether one sees the deglobalized asymptotically free or the globalized confining char acteristics prevail from the projection 6 and 7 to laboratory space we recognize the toroidal generators as momentum oper ators thus when experimental production of resonances is of concern we see from space the impact momen tum generates the abelian maximal torus of the u 3 allospace the momentum operators act as introtangling generators when decay asymptotic freedom fragmen tation and confinement is of concern we see from al lospace the quark and gluon fields are projections of the vector fields induced by the momentum form d appendix b the spectrum of k 2 and m 2 in the allospatial interpretation the presence of the components of k k 1 k 2 k 3 and m m 1 m 2 m 3 in the laplacian opens for the inclusion of spin and non neutral flavour it can be shown 14 that the components commute with the laplacian as they should since the laplacian is a casimir operator and therefore the generators of the group commutes with it they also commute with the geodetic potential so kk h mk h 0 b 1 where h is the hamiltonian in 1 further kk k 2 kk m 2 mk m 2 mk k 2 0 b 2 thus we may choose k 2 k 3 m 2 as a set of mutually commuting generators which commute with the hamilto nian h to solve the general problem 1 or 10 we need to specify the spectrum of the involved operators the well known eigenvalues of k 2 and k 3 follow 48 from the 13 commutation relations 15 here we choose to interpret k as an interior angular momentum operator and allow for half integer eigenvalues instead of choosing eigenval ues of k 3 we may choose i 3 the isospin 3 component to determine the spectrum for m 2 we introduce a canonical body fixed coordinate representation 49 k 1 a 2 p 3 a 3 p 2 7 k 2 a 1 p 3 a 3 p 1 5 k 3 a 1 p 2 a 2 p 1 2 b 3 the remaining gell mann generators are traditionally collected into a quadrupole moment tensor q but we need to distinguish between the two diagonal components q 0 1 2 3 21 2 2 2 2 3 1 2 3 a 2 2 p 21 p 2 2 2 p 2 3 8 q 3 1 2 21 2 2 1 2 a 2 2 p 21 p 2 2 3 b 4 and the three off diagonal components which we have collected into m m 3 1 2 a 2 2 p 1 p 2 1 m 2 3 1 a 2 2 p 3 p 1 4 m 1 2 3 a 2 2 p 2 p 3 6 b 5 m is a kind of runge lenz vector 50 of our problem this is felt already in its commutation relations 15 we shall see in the end b 13 that conservation of m 2 corresponds to conservation of particular combinations of hypercharge and isospin for the spectrum in projection space we calculate the su 3 casimir operator using the commutation relations 8 c 1 1 k 2 m 2 q 20 q 2 3 3 1 3 2 2 he 2 b 6 where the hamiltonian he of the euclidean harmonic os cillator is given by 2 he ca p 2 c a 2 with p p 1 p 2 p 3 1 2 3 b 7 we define canonical annihilation and creation opera tors aj 1 2 a pj i j a j 1 2 a pj i j ai a j ij ai aj a i

relation of gell mann and ne eman between charge hypercharge and isospin 51 52 inserting b 9 in b 6 and rearranging we get m 2 4 3 2 he 2 k 2 3 2 3 y 2 4 i 23 b 13 the spectrum of the three dimensional euclidean isotropic harmonic oscillator hamiltonian b 7 is well known 53 54 if we assume the standard interpreta tions in b 12 with q 2 as a charge operator we have a relation among quantum numbers yquantum number 3 yoperator from which to determine the spectrum of m 2 2 namely m 2 4 3 n 3 2 2 k k 1 3 1 3 y 2 4 i 23 n n 1 n 2 n 3 ni 0 1 2 3 b 14 now m is hermittean and therefore m 2 must be non negative with k 1 2 y 1 i 3 12 as for the nucleon the lowest possible value for n is 1 where m 2 13 4 for the combination y 1 i 3 12 with n 1 we have k k 1 m 2 4 and thus only two half integer values are possible for k namely k 1 2 m 2 13 4 and k 3 2 m 2 1 4 whereas k 5 2 would demand an impossible negative m 2 if we keep y 1 and ask for i 3 32 the minimum value of n is 2 and again we get k k 1 m 2 4 allowing for the two above mentioned values of k note that n 3 does not allow i 3 52 if we keep y 1 the relation in b 13 can be cast into an okubo form by choosing a different set of mutually commuting opera tors we want to replace the three component of isospin by isospin itself this is possible because i 2 i 21 i 2 2 i 2 3 1 4 k 23 m 2 3 i 2 3 b 15 14 and k 23 m 2 3 i 2 0 thus by rearranging b 15 and b 13 we get k 2 m 2 4 3 2 he 2 3 2 k 23 m 2 3 3 y 3 4 i 2 b 16 from b 16 we get the following relation among quantum numbers k k 1 m 2 4 3 n 3 2 2 3 k 23 m 2 3 1 3 y 2 4 i i 1 b 17 here k 23 m 2 3 should be considered a single quantum number for a given value of k 23 m 2 3 we may group the spectrum in b 17 according to n y constant and get the okubo structure 26 for the nominator in the centrifugal potential as described in the main text appendix c rayleigh ritz solution we want to find the eigenvalues e of the following equation e v r 1 2 3 2 er 1 2 3 c 1 which is the full eq 22 in the main text in the rayleigh ritz method 55 one expands the eigenfunction on an orthogonal set of base functions with a set of expansion coefficients multiply the equation by this expansion integrates over the entire variable volume and end up with a matrix problem in the expansion coef ficients from which a set of eigenvalues can be got thus with the approximation rn n l 1 alfl c 2 we have the integral equation rn e v rnd 1 d 2 d 3 rn 2 ernd 1 d 2 d 3 c 3 the counting variable l in c 2 is a suitable ordering of the set of tripples p q r in 44 or l m n in 33 such that we expand on an orthogonal set the eq c 3 can be interpreted as a vector eigenvalue problem where a is a vector whose elements are the expansion coefficients al thus c 3 is equivalent to the eigenvalue problem atga 2 eatfa c 4 where the matrix elements of g and f are given by glm fl e v fmd 1 d 2 d 3 c 5 and flm flfmd 1 d 2 d 3 c 6 when the set of expansion functions is orthogonal c 4 implies ga 2 efa c 7 from which we get a spectrum of n eigenvalues deter mined as the set of components of a vector e generated from the eigenvalues of the matrix f 1 g i e e 1 2 eig f 1 g c 8 the lowest lying eigenvalues will be better and better determined for increasing values of n in c 2 for the base 44 the integrals c 5 and c 6 can be solved ana lytically and as 44 is an educated guess based on the solution of the separable problem 31 it improves the convergence in n for the general problem in c 1 and c 7 the exact expressions to be used in constructing g and f are given below for the base 44 for r p u s and q t 1 we have the following orthogonality relations fpqr fstu fpqr 1 2 3 fstu 1 2 3 d 1 d 2 d 3 6 3 ps qt ru c 9 here for a convenient notation we have generalized the kronecker delta

inclined system of coordinates u t x y 2 x y 2 needed in order to find the matrix elements of the centrifugal potential the seemingly singular denomina tor in the centrifugal potential is then found to be integrable see c 16 to c 18 the domain of integration is expanded to suit the new set of variables this is possible because of the periodicity of the trigonometric functions such that functional

in the rayleigh ritz method we solve here exemplar integrals for the trigonometric basis needed to prove the orthogonality relation c 9 the expectation value of the geodetic potential c 12 and the centrifugal potential c 13 first the orthogonality relation for p 0 q 0 r p p 0 is left for the reader with a slight change in notation for the angular variables we seek the scalar product f g

readily factorize we need a change of variables which suits the mixing of the variables in the denomi nators due to the arbitrary labelling of our angles we have fpqr 1 sin 2 1 2 x y 1 sin 2 1 2 y z 1

parton distributions inspired by bettini s elegant treatment of parton scat tering 57 we generate distribution functions via our exterior derivative 9 in short the derivation runs like this with c 1 imagine a proton at rest with four momentum p 0 e 0 we boost it to en ergy e by impacting upon it a massless four momentum q q e e 0 which we assume to hit a parton xp after impact the parton carries a mass xe thus xp q xp q x 2 e 2 d 1 from which we get the parton momentum fraction x 2 e 0 e e 0 d 2 now introduce a boost parameter e e 0 e 2 2 x 2 x d 3 which we shall use to track out an orbit on the u 3 torus 1 corresponds to x 0 and vice versa with the toroidal generator t as introtangling momen tum operator we namely have the qualitative correspon dence q e e 0 1 x e 1 x t that is we will project on t 1 x t in order to probe on xp with a probability amplitude interpretation of we then have ft x dx dru exp it 2 d where d 4 ft x is the sought for distribution function and r is the proton analogue of 44 with the period doublings in 41 mimicked by making q half integer see d 11 below the distributions in fig 7 are traced out with the generators tu 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 and td 1 3 0 0 0 0

1 t 2 t 3 the choices d 5 are skew fractionations of the charge operator q 2 in b 11 which in a matrix representation reads q 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 d 7 19 since the tracking in d 6 is done from laboratory space we project on a fixed basis like in a 8 when we calculate the exterior derivative dr any toroidal track ing generator t is a tangent vector and can be expressed in a fixed basis of the tangent space of the torus the cartan subalgebra we write t a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 a 3 t 3 d 8 where aj are the coefficients of expansion and the tj s are the toroidal generators also used in 4 in quark language in the end we want to project dr on all three colour degrees of freedom cf a 4 and sum the contri butions to get the total amplitude for the specific flavour amplitude along the specific tracing generator in general we have 14 58 59 60 61 see appendix e 3 j 1 dru j 3 j 1 dru uitj 3 j 1 dru d exp 1 2 3 j 3 j 1 dr 1 2 3 j 3 j 1 r j 1 2 3 d 9 where u exp 1 it 1 2 it 2 3 it 3 and r is the

have introduced a shorthand notation for the directional derivative in our specific case in fig 7 we use a first order term c 2 from 44 with p q r 0 1 2 1 b 0 1 2 1 1 2 3 1 n 1 1 1 sin 1 2 1 sin 1 2 2 sin 1 2 3 cos 1 cos 2 cos 3 d 11 where n is a normalization constant for the particular case of d 11 we get a specific expression for the function d introduced in d 10 nd 1 2 3 1 2 cos 1 2 cos 3 cos 2

function xfu x x d 2 3 0 1 2 d dx where d 13 expressed in the parton fraction x d 13 reads xfu x x d 2 2 x 2 x 2 3 2 2 x 2 x 0 2 2 x 2 x 1 2 2 3 x 2 d 14 the result d 14 is shown in fig 7 together with the result of tracking with td note that x ftu x max 0 63 and x ftd x max 0 32 in rather fine agreement with uv and dv in the distribution functions shown in fig 7 and which are experimentally

1 996 d 16 we should also note that when comparing with estab lished distribution functions one should be aware that these are slightly scale dependent as seen when compar 20 ing those for 10 gev 2 with those for 10 000 gev 2 from the particle data group 62 one should expect closer correspondence the lower the energy scale actually we would like to see data extracted at 0 gev 2 which would represent the purely allospatially derived distribu tion functions luckily though it seems that 10 gev 2 is small enough to make the bridge we could call it the bridge of soft deep inelastic scattering the softer the momentum transfer gets the more terms one needs in the qcd expansions through which the data are currently analyzed the distributions in the insert in fig 7 are parametrizations from next to leading order nlo calcu lations what we would need in order to reach allospa tial dynamics would be n lo qcd at q 2 0 gev 2 this would be the confinement domain which we have attacked in the present work from within but which is the domain where pertubative qcd is expected to break down i e where nnlo qcd is not expected to converge for n appendix e vector fields derivations and forms on smooth manifolds to understand the use in a 6 of left invariance of the coordinate fields and linearity of the coordinate forms actually requires a careful application of the different ex pressions for the directional derivative and to arrive from the first expression in d 9 to the last expression of the same equation specifically requires a consistent def inition of differentiation on smooth manifolds in the present appendix we shall outline the basic concepts the appendix is based almost exclusively on 58 we have only added two corollaries of particular relevance in the present context here it comes let z be the generator of a directional derivative of at a certain point u in our manifold u 3 repeating eq 8 of 14 we then have the following equivalent expressions for the directional derivative zu z u d u z d dt u exp tz t 0 e 1 the identity between the second and the third expression in e 1 is just a question of notation referring to fig 9 we namely have for the directional derivative of real functions f on a smooth manifold m with tangent space tm the following definition 1 let f m r be a smooth function and xp tmp the number dfp xp is called the directional derivative of f in the direction xp and is also denoted xp f e 2 the directional derivative xp f fulfils the following identities xp f g xp f xp g f g c m e 3 x f xp f r e 4 xp f g xp f g p f p xp g e 5 where f g and f g are the functions given by addi tion and multiplication of functional values we see that the directional derivative applies and acts algebraically in analogy to the usual act of differentiation we now state the following definition 2 a map dp c m r which fulfils e 3 e 5 is called a derivation at the point p e 6 we see that any tangent vector gives rise to a derivation it is remarkable and important for our purpose that the opposite is also true theorem 1 any derivation dp at the point p is a directional derivative e 7 this theorem is used in order to write the identity be tween the third and the fourth last expression in e 1 we shall leave out the proof of e 7 which needs some lemmas that would lead us astray in the present con text the conclusion is that there exists a 1 1 correspon dence between tangent vectors xp tmp and deriva tions dp c m r at the point p the derivation corresponding to xp is xp f dfp xp or e 8 xp f i ai f xi p e 9 where xp i ai xi p and f xi p f x 1 xi x p for an atlas u x that covers the manifold m the idea is illustrated in fig 9 locally for a partic ular local map in the book of maps the atlas which consist of enough maps to parametrize all of m via lo cal maps that are joined smoothly in their overlapping regions the manifold m is depictured in fig 9 as a surface in an embedding space of specific dimension so now in short we have a global definition of derivation and can faithfully derive locally by pulling back the derivation on the manifold to ordinary derivations in a parameter space rm of the same dimension m as the manifold m note that the presence of the spikes in the parametric potential 17 shown in fig 2 does not signify that the geodetic distance 3 used for our potential 2 in our defining hamiltonian 3 would not be smooth quite the contrary the geodetic distance and thus its square are smooth functions on all of u 3 the spikes in fig 2 only indicate that one cannot define a single map to 21 fig 9 derivation of a real function f m r at point p in the mainfold m is defined by using a local smooth map x m rm to pull back the problem to an ordinary derivation on rm by using the pullback function f x 1 rm r one can differentiate f x 1 in the ordinary way this idea is readily generalized to a complex valued function and in our case the manifold m could be u 3 and the complex valued function f could be either the wavefunction or its measure scaled partner cover u 3 globally you cannot peel an orange without breaking the skin this is also why we have to limit the expression 2 to the interval j for our parametrization which we need to make our hamiltonian operational for actual calculations in 16 but luckily we can use a common parametrization of the eigenvalues of u u 3 to proceed further we need the following statement 1 the smooth vector fields m on m constitute an infinite dimensional real vector space e 10 my personal notes in the lecture notes 63 explains the infinity with these comments there is an infinity of atlases and infinitely many coefficients to xi p at any point p m there is an m dimensional infinity of tan gent vectors and these can be combined in infinitely many ways at different p s to understand the statement e 10 we need some more math first let mm rk be a smooth manifold we shall then start out with the following 64 definition 3 a function x mm rk which fulfils x p tmp for all p m is called a vector field on m if m is continuous smooth the vector field is said to be continuous smooth e 11 please allow me to cite my teacher s comment on the above definition properties of vector fields and their dynamical systems on manifolds are studied locally by translating the previously treated euclidean case by the help of atlases this is a key point in our application in d 9 of the beautiful mathematical machinery exposed in this appendix let us now continue with his explana tion following my citation let u x be a chart on mm corresponding to this we have an induced base for any point p u xi p d x 1 x p ei e 12 where d x 1 x p r m tmmp rk and where ei is the i th standard unit vector in rm since e 1 em is a base for rm x 1 p xm p e 13 becomes a basis for tmmp i made a remark in his notes that d x 1 is injective since x is a diffeomorphism per definition of the smoothness of m ot 2012 perhaps we should have mentioned earlier that u m is an open neighbourhood of p u which is where we have defined directional derivatives above e 2 going back through the necessary mathematical con cepts for our purpose we give for the sake of complete ness definition 4 let p mm rk be a point on a smooth m dimensional manifold and u x a chart around p with x p the tangent space tmp for m m in the point p is the image of the linear map d x 1 r m rk e 14 definition 5 let mm rk and nn rl be smooth manifolds and f mm nn a smooth function by the differential of f in the point p is understood the linear map dfp tmp tnf p e 15 defined in the following way let v be a neighbourhood of p in rk and f v rl a smooth continuation of f f v m f or in words f s restriction to m is f ot 2012 then for tmp the diffential is dfp dfp e 16 we are now ready to explain statement 1 in e 10 which we shall need for essential algebraic manipulations below statement 1 might be obvious in connection with the lecture notes but here we need to strengthen the 22 statement by formulating the following corollary 1 let df tmm tr r be the diffential the exterior derivative of a functionf mm r further let xp f i ai f xi p and e 17 yp f i bi f xi p e 18 be directional derivatives of f in the directions xp respectively yp then zp f i ci f xi p where ci ai bi e 19 will be a directional derivative in the direction zp in other words xp yp f xp f yp f e 20 proof of corollary 1 it should be clear that tmmp is a linear vector space and thus it is clear that zp tmp we also remarked in the text following e 6 that zp will be a derivation this is obvious from definition 1 in e 2 when comparing with definition 2 in e 6 now from theorem 1 in e 7 we then have that zp will also be a directional derivative q e d it shall be essential to us that zp in e 19 is ex panded on the same basis as that of xp and yp this is possible because one can use the same smooth continu ation f for all the three derivatives xp yp and zp we need a second corollary 2 let f mm r then df x y df x df y e 21 where x y tmm and df x df x e 22 where r here we have suppressed the index p but e 21 and e 22 should be understood pointwise it should be ob vious that e 21 in corollary 2 is just a formal way of expressing the statement in definition 5 that dfp is a lin ear map and that e 22 in corollary 2 is just another way of stating one of the characteristics of derivatives namely e 4 however we have not proven the linearity of forms which has been the formulation exterior deriva tive primarily used in the main text of the present work thus we wanted to state this small proof of corollary 2 dfp x y xp yp f xp f yp f dfp x dfp y e 23 in the second expression we used the equivalent notation for directional derivatives introduced in definition 1 in e 2 in the third expression we used e 20 and in the last expression we returned to the language of forms via e 2 to prove e 22 we write dfp x xp f dfp x e 24 in the second expression we used again definition 1 in e 2 the last expression finishes the proof q e d of course the proof of corollary 2 is not really a proof there was nothing new to prove the proof is only meant to show how the algebra works when one switches between the different notations xp f and dfp x for the directional derivative corollaries 1 and 2 are readily generalized to f mm c and c with these two corollaries we now have our mathematical machinery in shape to pro ceed from the first to the last expression in d 10 in order to calculate d 12 the linearity of forms expressed in corollary 2 by the eqs e 21 and e 22 together with the generalization e 2 of derivation in definition 1 and finally the existence of induced bases like in e 12 pull back the problem to rm so that the partial derivatives pull back to give results like d 12 we have thus presented the derivation on the smooth manifold u 3 in an operational form which makes possible actual calculations 23 tables table i comparison of the
