length correspond to isometries of constant displacement those in turn have been used to study homogeneity of riemannian and finsler quotient manifolds almost all of that work has been done for group manifolds or more generally for symmetric spaces this paper extends the scope of research on constant length killing vector fields to a class of riemannian normal homogeneous spaces 1 introduction an isometry of a metric space m d is called clifford wolf cw if it moves each point the same distance i e if the displacement function x d x x is constant w k clifford 4 described such isometries for the 3 sphere and g vincent 19 used the term clifford translation for constant displacement isometries of round spheres in his study of spherical space forms sn with metabelian later j a wolf 20 21 22 extended the use of the term clifford translation to the context of metric spaces especially riemannian symmetric spaces there the point is his theorem 24 that a complete locally symmetric riemannian manifold m is homogeneous if and only if in the universal cover m m m the covering group consists of clifford translations in part wolf s argument was case by case but later v ozols 15 17 18 gave a general argument for the situation where is a cyclic subgroup of the identity component i 0 m of the isometry group i m h freudenthal 14 discussed the situation where i 0 m and introduced the term clifford wolf isometry cw for isometries of constant displacement that seems to be the term in general usage more recently the result 24 for locally symmetric homogeneous riemannian manifolds was extended to finsler manifolds by s deng and j a wolf 11 in the setting of non positive sectional curvature isometries of bounded displace ment are already cw 25 further there has been some work

riemannian homogeneous spaces such that the homogeneity can be achieved by cw translations i e cw homogeneous spaces 1 2 3 also s deng and m xu studied cw isometries and cw homogeneous spaces in finsler geometry 5 6 7 8 9 10 most of the research on cw translations has been concerned with riemannian and later finsler symmetric spaces there we have a full understanding of cw translations 24 and 11 but little is known about cw translations on non symmetric homoge neous riemannian spaces for example there are not many examples of clifford wolf translations on riemannian normal homogeneous space g h with g compact simple except the those found on riemannian symmetric spaces and in some closely related settings see 12 and 13 the infinitesimal version apparently introduced by v n berestovskii and yu g nikonorov is that of killing vector fields of constant length we will refer to those killing vector fields as clifford killing vector fields or ck vector fields they correspond at least locally to one parameter local groups of cw isometries the purpose of this work is to study and classify all ck vector fields on riemannian normal homogeneous spaces m g h we recall the general definition of riemannian normal homogeneous spaces let g be a connected lie group and h a compact subgroup such that m g h carries a g invariant riemannian metric thus the lie algebra g has an ad h invariant direct sum decomposition g h m where the natural projection g g h maps m onto the tangent space at the base point o e and the riemannian metric corresponds to a positive definite inner product m on m the riemannian manifold m is called naturally reductive if the ad h invariant decomposition g h m can be chosen so that prm u v w m v prm u w m 0 for all u v w m where prm g m is the projection with kernel h when m is the restriction of an ad g invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on g such that h m m g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space in this general definition riemannian normal homogeneous space is viewed as a generalization of riemannian symmetric space including the non compact type if we expect the riemannian nor mal homogeneous space to be related to riemannian isometric submersions there is another definition of riemannian normal homogeneous space which require m is the restriction of an ad g invariant bi invariant inner product on g in this definition g must be compact i e g is quasi compact or equivalently the universal cover of g is the product of a compact semi simple lie group and an euclidean space which can be 0 note that in both definition the normal homogeneous metric on m depends on g in this work we will only consider the special case that g is a compact connected simple lie group our main result is theorem 1 1 let g be a compact connected simple lie group and h a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg fix a normal riemannian metric on m g h suppose that there is a nonzero vector v g defining a ck vector field on m g h then m 2 is a complete locally symmetric riemannian manifold and its universal riemannian cover is an odd dimensional sphere of constant curvature or a riemannian symmetric space su 2 n sp n it is obvious to see that when dimh dimg m is reduced to a single point and when dimh 0 m is locally riemannian symmetric because it is covered by g with the bi invariant riemannian metric riemannian normal homogeneity is a much weaker condition than riemannian sym metry or locally riemannian symmetric homogeneity even in the case where g is a compact connected simple lie group every smooth coset space g h has at least one invariant normal riemannian metric while of course the list of riemannian symmetric spaces g h is rather short but theorem 1 1 provides the same classification result for ck vector fields it suggests that the existence of nontrivial ck vector fields and cw translations will impose very stronger restrictions on a riemannian homogeneous space at least when that space is riemannian normal homogeneous on the other hand we do not have have comprehensive results when g is of non compact type when g is compact but not simple generally speaking a riemannian normal homogeneous space m does not have a perfect local decomposition into sym metric spaces thus the study of cw translations and ck vector fields in this situation is still open the proof of the theorem 1 1 is organized as follows in section 2 we summarize the notations and preliminaries for the riemannian normal homogeneous spaces we will consider in section 3 we present some preliminary lemmas study the ck vector fields at the cartan subalgebra level and prove theorem 1 1 in the easiest situations in section 4 we prove the theorem 1 1 when g is an exceptional lie group from section 5 to section 8 we prove the theorem 1 1 when g is a classical lie group i e of type an bn cn or dn the first author thanks the department of mathematics at the university of cali fornia berkeley for hospitality during the preparation of this paper 2 notations about normal homogeneous spaces let g be a compact connected simple lie group and h a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg we denote g lie g and h lie h fix a bi invariant inner product of g it defines a decomposition g h m with h m and h m m the orthogonal projection to each factor is denoted prh or prm respectively we naturally identify m with the tangent space to g h at o e where g g h is the usual projection the restriction of to m is ad h invariant and defines a g invariant riemannian metric on m g h a riemannian metric defined in this way is called a normal homogeneous metric and m together with a normal homogeneous metric is a riemannian normal homogeneous space note the dependence on g here g is simple so the normal homogeneous metric on g h is unique up to scalar multiplications any cartan subalgebra of h can be expanded to a cartan subalgebra t of g such that t t h t m as any two cartan subalgebras of g are conjugate we can assume t is the standard one for example when g su n 1 t is the subalgebra of all diagonal 3 matrices the standard u n so 2 n comes from a b 1 7 a b b a for a b r we view sp n as the space of all skew hermitian skew n n quaternion matrices where q 7 q is the usual conjugation of h r ri rj rk over r then u n sp n when we identify 1 with i with these descriptions the space of diagonal matrices in u n also provides the standard cartan subalgebra t for the other classical compact simple lie algebras the standard cartan subalgebra of so 2 n can also be viewed as that for so 2 n 1 with so 2 n identified with the block at the right down corner let g t be the root system of g and be any positive root system in because of the bi invariant inner product on g the roots of g can be viewed as elements of t instead of t we have the standard decomposition of g 2 1 g t g in which each g is the real two dimensional root plane g c g c g considering the subalgebra h we have another decomposition of g 2 2 g t prh g where g prh g both 2 1 and 2 2 are orthogonal decompositions more importantly we have or thogonal decompositions t t h t m and 2 3 g g h g m 2 4 in which the summands are equal to the images of the projection maps prh and prm let h t h denote the root system of h and choose a positive subsystem the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to h is a bi invariant inner product there and can be viewed as a subset of t h for each root the two dimensional root plane h is just the factor g h in 2 4 for each simple lie algebra g we recall the bourbaki description of the root system and the root planes in the classical cases 1 the case g an su n 1 for n 0 let e 1 en 1 denote the standard orthonormal basis of rn 1 then t can be isometrically identified with the subspace e 1 en 1

root system is 3 0 3 2 3 2 0 1 3 2 1 2 2 13 there are many choices of the orthonormal basis e 1 en with respect to which the root systems have the same standard presentations as above for example the ones obtained by applying elements of the weyl group in the classical cases this means any permutation of the ei with any number of sign changes ei 7 ei in cases b and c an even number of sign changes in case d for type d we can also use the outer automorphism and thus have ei 7 ei with any number of sign changes 3 ck vector fields on compact normal homogeneous spaces assumem g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space in which g is a compact connected simple lie group and h is a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg we keep all notation of the last section and further assume there is a nonzero vector v g that defines a clifford killing vector field on m the value of v at g where g g h as usual is g lg ad g v g e ad g v so the condition that v defines a nonzero ck vector field on m is that prm ad g v is a positive constant function of g for the bi invariant inner product v 2 ad g v 2 prh ad g v 2 prm ad g v 2 is a constant function of g g so the same is true for prh ad g v suitably choosing v within its ad g orbit we can assume v t the standard special cartan subalgebra 6 given in the last section now prh v and prm v are constant functions of in the weyl group because g is simple and v 6 0 both the functions prh ad g v and prm ad g v for g g or the functions prh v and prm v for in the weyl group are positive constant functions from the above observations it is easy to prove two special cases of theorem 1 1 proposition 3 1 let g be a compact connected simple lie group and h a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg if g a 2 or g 2 then there is no nonzero v g that defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h proof consider g a 2 first assume conversely there is a nonzero ck vector field defined by the nonzero vector v t the subspaces t h and t m are a pair of orthogonal lines in t denote all different vectors in the weyl group orbit of v as v 1 v vk k 3 or 6 then k i 1 vi k i 1 prh vi k i 1 prm vi 0 all the vectors prm vi have the same nonzero length which only have two possible choices in t m so we must have k 6 and all vi can be divided into two set such that for example prm v 1 prm v 2 prm v 3 and prm v 4 prm v 5 prm v 6 are opposite to each other obviously v 1 v 2 v 3 6 0 so there are two vi among them v 1 and v 2 for example such that v 1 v 2 in which is the reflection in some root of g thus t h containing v 1 v 2 is linearly spanned by a root of g similar argument can also prove t m is spanned by a root of g but for a 2 there do not exist a pair of orthogonal roots this is a contradiction the weyl group of g 2 contains that of a 2 as its subgroup so the statement for g 2 also follows immediately the above argument to prove theorem 1 1 in general we need some preparation suppose that m g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space and v g defines a ck vector field on m if g g is a covering group and h is an open subgroup of 1 h then m g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space and a riemannian covering manifold of m and the same v g defines a ck vector field on m thus we can always replace g by a covering group similarly we can go down to a certain class of subgroups lemma 3 2 let m g h be a riemannian normal homogeneous space such that v g defines a ck vector field on m let g be a closed subgroup of g whose lie algebra g satisfies g g h g m let h be a closed subgroup of g with lie algebra h g h then the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g defines a riemannian normal homogeneous metric on m g h if v v v with v g v g 0 and v g 0 then v defines a ck vector field on m g h proof because of the decomposition g g h g m we also have g g h g m the condition that v v v defines a ck vector field for the 7 riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h implies that prm ad g v 2 prm ad g v prm ad g v 2 prm ad g v prm v 2 prm ad g v 2 prm v 2 is a constant function for g g and so does prm ad g v 2 i e v defines a ck vector field for the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h we will frequently use lemma 3 2 to reduce our considerations to smaller groups lemma 3 3 suppose that 0 6 v t defines a ck vector field on m g h then 1 if the weyl group orbit w v contains an orthogonal basis of t then prh v 2 v 2 dim t h dim t 2 if ad g v contains an orthogonal basis of g then prh v 2 v 2 dim h dim g proof 1 for simplicity we assume v 1 let v 1 vn w v be an orthogo nal basis of t and u 1 uh an orthonormal basis of t h expand ui n j 1 aijvj then prh vi h j 1 aijuj and prh vi 2 h j 1 a 2 ij so prh v 2 v 2 1 n n i 1 prh vi 2 1 n n i 1 h j 1 aij 2 1 n h j 1 h i 1 aij 2 h n that proves the first assertion the proof of the second is similar lemma 3 3 provides a useful tool when we deal the cases g bn and g dn lemma 3 4 suppose that 0 6 v t defines a ck vector field on m g h let g t such that 0 and v 6 0 6 v then prh prh prm prm 0 proof let the reflections for the roots and be denoted and respectively then the four points v 1 prhv v 2 prh v prh v 2 v prh v 3 prh v prh v 2 v prh 8 and v 4 prh v prh v 2 v prh 2 v prh belong to a two dimensional plane and have the same distance from 0 they are the vertices of a rectangle with adjacent edges parallel to prh and prh respectively those edges are orthogonal in other words prh prh 0 the other statement prm prm 0 follows immediately lemma 3 4 is the key to our study of the ck vector fields on the cartan subalgebra level the next proposition implies at least for classical g that a nonzero vector v which defines a ck vector field must would be very singular proposition 3 5 suppose that g is classical i e g an for n 0 bn for n 1 cn for n 2 or dn for n 3 suppose that 0 6 v t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h use the standard presentations for the cartan subalgebra t and root system in 2 5 2 8 then for a suitable choice of the ei v must be one of the following up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar 1 let g an with n 2 then v ne 1 e 2 en 1 or if n is odd v e 1 ek ek 1 en 1 for n 2 k 1 2 let g bn or cn with n 1 or let g dn with n 3 then v e 1 or v e 1 en proof 1 assume g an with n 2 if the weyl group orbit of v contains a multiple of ne 1 e 2 en 1 then assertion 1 is proved now suppose that the weyl group orbit of v does not contain a multiple of ne 1 e 2 en 1 then for any orthogonal pair of roots ei ej and ek el with i j k and l distinct we can replace v by a weyl group conjugate and assume v a 1 e 1 an 1 en 1 where ai 6 aj and ak 6 al applying lemma 3 4 we have 3 6 0 ei ej ek el prh ei ej prh ek el prh ei ej ek el for any k and l such that i j k and l are distinct express prh ei ej rmem hold i and j fixed and let k and vary over 1 n 1 i j then 3 6 shows that all such rk r thus we have constants a and b such that prh ei ej aei bej a bn 1 e 1 en 1 ei ej similarly prh ek el ce 3 de 4 c dn 1 e 1 en 1 ek el now 3 6 tells us prh ei ej prh ek el n 3 n 1 2 2 n 1 a b c d 0 3 7 i e either a b 0 or c d 0 if a b 0 then prh ei ej is a multiple of ei ej and if c d 0 then prh ek el is a multiple of ek el if a b 0 so 9 prh ei ej r ei ej then pr 2 h ei ej prh ei ej so r 2 r either r 0 and ei ej m or r 1 and ei ej h similarly if c d 0 then either ek el m or ek el h so if there is a root contained neither in h nor in m then any roots orthogonal to it are contained either in h or in m suppose that there is a root contained neither in h nor in m applying a weyl group element we may assume e 1 e 2 then any root ei ej 2 i j n 1 is contained in h or m and all such roots must be contained in the same subspace suppose they all belong to h the argument will be the same if they all belong to m now e 3 e 4 h and e 1 e 3 e 3 e 4 6 0 shows e 1 e 3 m if e 1 e 3 h then by the above argument e 2 e 4 h suitably permuting the ei we see ei ej h for 1 i j n 1 so m r ne 1 e 2 en 1 recall v a 1 e 1 an 1 en 1 with ai 0 all prm v have the same length for any in the weyl group in other words a 1 n a 2 an 1 n 1 a 1 is constant under permutations of the ai thus n is odd say n 2 k 1 and after a suitable permutation of the ei v is a scalar multiple of e 1 ek ek 1 en 1 on the other hand suppose that every root is contained in either h or m say h m if m then t h and the ck vector field v has a zero forcing v 0 which contradicts the hypothesis v 6 0 if h then t m contradicting our construction of t which starts with a cartan subalgebra of h thus h 6 and m 6 because h m 0 this is a contradiction with the fact that g is simple that completes the proof of assertion 1 2 assume g bn with n 1 if the weyl group orbit w v of v contains a multiple of e 1 then assertion 2 is proved for g bn now suppose that w v does not contain a multiple of e 1 express v a 1 e 1 anen then at least two of the coefficients ai are nonzero any two short roots ei and ej with i 6 j are orthogonal to each other so we can suitably choose v from its weyl group orbit such that ai 6 0 and aj 6 0 applying lemma 3 4 we see prh ei prh ej prm ei prm ej 0 whenever i 6 j these can only be true when each ei is contained in either t h or t m then suitably permute the ei we can assume that e 1 eh spans t h and eh 1 en spans t m all prh v in the weyl group have the same length in particular v a 1 e 1 anen must satisfy a 1 an by suitable scalar changes and weyl group actions we have v e 1 en that completes the proof of assertion 2 for g bn the proof for g cn is similar now assume g dn with n 3 the root system of dn contains two subsystems of type an 1 whose intersection is of type an 2 if the weyl group orbit w v contains a scalar multiple of e 1 or of e 1 or e 1 en then assertion 2 follows if it contains a scalar multiple of e 1 en 1 en we apply the outer automorphism that restricts to e 1 en 1 en 7 e 1 en 1 en and assertion 2 follows now suppose that neither of these holds w v contains neither a multiple of e 1 nor a multiple of e 1 en 1 en then v a 1 e 1 anen has two nonzero coefficients and not all the ai are equal if i j k and l are distinct we have v a 1 e 1 a nen w v such that a i 6 a j and a k 6 a l and v a 1 e 1 a nen w v such that a i 6 a j 10 and a k 6 a l apply lemma 3 4 to ei ej and ek el or ei ej and ei ej the result is prh ei ej prh ek el prm ei ej prm ek el 0 and prh ei ej prh ei ej prm ei ej prm ei ej 0 whenever i j k and l are distinct this is only possible when the each one of ei ej is contained in t h or t m by an argument similar that used to prove 1 we have either t h and the riemannian normal homogeneous spacem g h has no nonzero ck vector field or t h 0 which contradicts with our construction of t proposition 3 5 is the key step in the proof of theorem 1 1 it reduces our discussion for each classical g to very few possibilities for the vector v in the next section we will apply this proposition to each exceptional g and show there does not exist any nonzero ck vector field in those cases 4 proof of theorem 1 1 for g exceptional in this section we will apply proposition 3 5 to prove theorem 1 1 when g is a compact exceptional simple lie algebra the proof is a case by case discussion 1 the case g g 2 has already been proven in proposition 3 1 2 let g f 4 we use the standard presentation 2 12 for its root system its root system has a subsystem of type b 4 which defines a subgroup w of the weyl group w by the argument for the case of bn in proposition 3 5 if 0 6 v g defines a ck vector field on m we can re scale it and use the w action and assume that either v e 1 or v 1 2 e 1 e 4 but those belong to the same orbit for w considering v 1 2 e 1 e 4 it follows that each of t h and t m is linearly spanned by a non empty subset of e 1 e 4 then use v e 1 in the same weyl group orbit prm v varies with w contradicting the ck property of v we conclude that if g f 4 then m g h has no nonzero ck vector field 3 let g e 6 we use the standard presentation 2 9 for its root system its root system has a subsystem of type d 5 which defines subgroup w of the weyl group w of g suppose that 0 6 v g defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous spacem g h using the reflections for roots of the form 1 2 e 1 e 5 3 e 6 we can assume that v a 1 e 1 a 6 e 6 has three nonzero coefficients among the first five ai by the argument in the dn case of proposition 3 5 if 1 i j 5 then prh ei ej and prm ei ej are four orthogonal vectors in rei rej re 6 so if 1 i j 5 then either ei ej or ei ej is contained in t h or in t m and all those roots define the same subspace we will argue the case where they are in t h with very minor modifications our argument also works when they are in t m in that case there are two possibilities 1 there exist i and j with 1 i j 6 and both ei ej contained in t h or 2 whenever 1 i j 6 either ei ej or e 1 ej is not contained in t h m 11 suppose that whenever 1 i j 6 either ei ej or ei ej is not contained in t h m by suitably choosing the first five ei in the d 5 where w acts we can assume ei ej h and ei ej h m for 1 i j 5 let be the reflection in the root 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 3 e 6 denote e i ei apply the above argument to the new basis e 1 e 6 then for 1 i j 6 either e i e j or e i e j is not contained in t h m because e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 is not contained in t h m and because e 1 e 2 12 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 3 e 6 is not orthogonal to e 1 e 2 t h we have 4 1 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 3 e 6 t h if we use the reflection in the root 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 3 e 6 the above argument shows 4 2 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 3 e 6 h by 4 1 and 4 2 e 3 e 4 t h which contradicts our assumption thus there exist i and j such that 1 i j 6 and the ei ej are contained in t h then h re 1 re 5 and m re 6 let be the reflection in a root of the form 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 3 e 6 and denote e i ei for 1 i 6 the e i are another orthonormal basis of t for which the root system is given by 2 9 in particular the e i e j 1 i j 6 give a root system of d 5 in the above argument also implies m re 6 but re 6 6 re 6 this is a contradiction we conclude that there is no nonzero vector v that defines a ck vector field for the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h 3 use the standard presentation 2 10 for the root system of e 7 and apply an argument similar to the one above for e 6 arguing mutatis mutandis we see that when g e 7 there is no nonzero vector v that defines a ck vector field for the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h 4 let g e 8 we use the standard presentation 2 11 for its root system its root system contains a root system of type d 8 and the weyl group w of that d 8 is of course a subgroup of the weyl group w of g suppose that a nonzero vector v t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h the argument for the case of dn for proposition 3 5 can be applied here to show that up to scalar multiplications and the action of w either v e 1 or v e 1 e 7 e 8 in either case the reflection in the root 1 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 8 maps v to another v a 1 e 1 a 8 e 8 such that there are at least two nonzero ais and not all ai s are the same we have shown prh v is not a constant function for all w in the proof of proposition 3 5 this contradicts our assumption on v so there is no nonzero v g defining a ck vector field on m g h in summary we have proved proposition 4 3 let g be a compact connected exceptional simple lie group and h a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg then there is no nonzero vector v g that defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h 12 5 proof of theorem 1 1 for g an in this section g an su n 1 and 0 6 v t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h proposition 3 5 says that up to the action of the weyl group either v is a multiple of ne 1 e 2 en 1 or n 1 2 k and v is a multiple of e 1 ek ek 1 en 1 however we must see whether those vectors v actually define ck vector fields the case n 1 is trivial if there are nonzero ck vectors fields then dimh 0 the case n 2 has been proven in proposition 3 1 so we assume n 2 5 a the case n 2 k 1 is odd and v e 1 ek ek 1 en 1 from the argument in proposition 3 5 either t h r ne 1 e 2 en 1 or t m r ne 1 e 2 en 1 up to the action of the weyl group suppose t h r ne 1 e 2 en 1 then either h r ne 1 e 2 en 1 or h is the a 1 with cartan subalgebra h t r ne 1 e 2 en 1 in the a 1 case the root plane j of h relative to t h is contained in g e 1 e 2 g e 1 en 1 direct calculation shows j j 6 t h j so t h j is not a lie algebra this eliminates the a 1 case thus h r ne 1 e 2 en 1 let g g with ad g v 1 diag 0 11 0 1 1 1 1 then ad g v ne 1 e 2 en 1 0 while v ne 1 e 2 en 1 n 1 so v cannot define a ck vector field on m g h we have proved t h 6 r ne 1 e 2 en 1 so up to the action of the weyl group we assume t m r ne 1 e 2 en 1 if 0 6 t h then e 1 so dim g 0 or 2 the root planes of h are root planes of g for roots orthogonal to e 1 consider one such g ei ej where 1 i j n 1 which is not a root plane of h then it is contained in m permuting the el we may assume i 3 and j 4 then we have v 1 diag 1 1 0 11 0 1 1 1 1 ad g v but prm v prm v which is a contradiction this proves g ei ej h for 1 i j n 1 the other root planes of g involve e 1 in the root so they are all contained in m in conclusion h is a standard su n in g su n 1 and the universal cover of m g h is s 2 n 1 su n 1 su n with n 1 remark the vector v e 1 ek ek 1 en 1 defines a ck vector field on the sphere s 2 n 1 so 2 n 2 so 2 n 1 however the riemannian normal homogeneous metric on s 2 n 1 su n 1 su n is not riemannian symmetric the isotropy representation for s 2 n 1 su n 1 su n decomposes m m 0 m 1 in which dimm 0 1 with trivial ad h action let bi be the inner product on m which defines the riemannian symmetric metric on s 2 n 1 the decomposition m m 0 m 1 is orthogonal for both and bi by a suitable scalar change bi coincides with on m 1 and differs on m 0 if the same v e 1 ek ek 1 en 1 defines a ck vector field on s 2 n 1 su n 1 su n for the riemannian normal homogeneous metric then by the general observations at the beginning of section 3 ad g v is contained in a hyperplane in g which is parallel to h m 1 that would contradict the fact g is simple and v is nonzero 13 5 b the case v ne 1 e 2 en 1 suppose that some g ei ej m we may assume i 1 and j 2 then we have v e 1 ne 2 e 3 en 1 ad g v and v 1 diag n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 1 1 ad g v note prh v prh v prh v by construction prh v prh v 2 prh v so prh v prh v i e e 1 e 2 t m from this argument g ei ej m only when ei ej t m in particular for any root ei ej t m prh ei ej is a root of h similarly g ei ej h only when ei ej t h it will be convenient to assume prh e 1 en 1 0 so that prh is defined on the euclidean space rn 1 that contains t denote e i prh ei for 1 i n 1 then e i e j is 0 or a root of h the e i generate all the roots of h it follows that h is a simple lie algebra summarizing the above argument we have lemma 5 1 assume g an for n 2 and suppose that v ne 1 e 2 en 1 t defines a ck vector field on the normal homogeneous space m g h then 1 if g ei ej m then ei ej t m 2 if g ei ej h then ei ej t h 3 denote e i prh ei for 1 i n 1 then the root system of h is the set of all nonzero vectors of the form e i e j in particular h is a compact simple lie algebra now consider the case e i e j e k e l 6 0 in which e i 6 e k or e j 6 e l both inequalities are satisfied as we saw e i e j is a root of h so e j 6 e k for otherwise e i e l 2 e i e j is a root of h similarly e i 6 e l then for the roots e i e j and e i e k of h both e i e l and e k e j are roots of h there are only two possibilities for this 1 the roots and of h are short and have an angle 3 or 2 3 and h g 2 2 the roots and of h are short 0 and are long roots based on this observation we will prove the following lemma lemma 5 2 let g an with n 2 and suppose that v ne 1 e 2 en 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h denote e i prh ei so e 1 e n 1 0 then we have the following 1 no two e i are equal 2 there exist distinct i j k and l such that e i e j e k e l 3 if i j k and l are distinct and satisfy e i e j e k e l then the roots and of h are short 0 and are long roots 14 proof 1 for simplicity we call e i single if its pre image pr 1 h e i consists of a single element ei if e 1 is not single and pr 1 h e 1 e 1 ek k 1 then e 1 e i is root of h for i k permuting ei for i k we can assume e 1 e k 1 has the largest length among all the roots of the form e 1 e i and pr 1 h e k 1 ek 1 ek l l 0 if e 1 e k 1 e i e j with i k then by the observation before this lemma either there is a root e 1 e j longer than e 1 e k 1 which is a contradiction or h g 2 and the angle between e 1 e k 1 and e l e i is 3 or 2 3 we first assume there do not exist i and j such that i k and e 1 e k 1 e i e j then h e 1 e k 1 g e 1 e k 1 k i 1 l j 1 g ei ek j and direct calculation shows e 1 e k 1 r e 1 e 2 r ek l 1 ek l let g be the closed subgroup of g with its algebra g 1 i k l r ei ei 1 1 i j k l g ei ej it is the standard su k l in g su n 1 corresponding to the k l k l block at the upper left corner let h be the connected component of g h its lie algebra is h g h the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g defines a riemannian normal homogeneous space g h then we have the orthogonal decomposition g h m which coincides with g g h g m notice v ne 1 e 2 en 1 can be decomposed as a sum of v n 1 k l k l 1 e 1 e 2 ek l g and v n 1 k l 1 e 1 ek l ek l 1 en 1 cg g with v g 0 so by lemma 3 2 v k l 1 e 1 e 2 ek l defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h the subalgebra h is isomorphic to a 1 which can be assumed to be linearly spanned by u 1 1 aik 0 0 bil u 2 0 a a 0 and u 3 1 0 a a 0 in which ak bl 0 ik and il are k k and l l identity matrices respectively and a is a k l complex matrix direct calculation for the condition u 2 u 3 ru 1 indicates a b k l and by suitable scalar changes and unitary conjugations we can assume a ik the orbit ad g v contains v 1 1 k 1 e 1 1 ek 1 k 1 k e 1 k 1 ek 1 1 16 i 6 k 1 ei i and v 2 1 k 1 e 1 1 e 2 k 2 k k e 1 2 k e 2 k 1 16 i 6 2 k ei i thus prh v 1 prh v 2 0 which is a contradiction we conclude that there do exist i and j such that i k and e 1 e k 1 e i e j note then that i 6 j 15 now there exist i 6 j such that i k and e 1 e k 1 e i e j in this case h g 2 for simplicity we can suitably permute the ei not assuming e 1 e k any more such that we have e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 the angle between the short roots e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 and e 1 e 3 e 2 e 4 of h is 3 or 2 3 and both e 1 e 4 and e 2 e 3 are roots of h such that one is long and the other is short assume e 2 e 3 is the short root for example assuming e 1 e 4 to be the short root introduces only very minor changes in the following argument if e 2 e 3 e p e q such that e p 6 e 2 or e q 6 e 3 then either e p or e q must be different from the e rs with 1 r 4 the short root e 2 e p e 3 e q must be one of e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 or e 1 e 3 e 2 e 4 then the same e 2 or e 3 appears in different presentations of a short root of h this contradicts our earlier observation so there do not exist p and q such that e 2 e 3 e p e q with either e p 6 e 2 or e q 6 e 3 thus g e 2 e 3 e p e 2 e q e 3 g ep eq arguing as above we see that both e 2 and e 3 are single we can also get e 2 e 3 6 e 2 e 3 otherwise e 2 e 3 reaches the maximal possible length of h which must be a long root but we have assumed it is a short root by lemma 5 1 h e 2 e 3 is not a root plane of g i e g e 2 e 3 e p e 2 e q e 3 g ep eq has dimension bigger than 2 so e 2 and e 3 cannot both be single this is a contradiction assertion 1 of lemma 5 2 is proved 2 if there do not exist distinct indices i j k and l such that e i e j e k e l then by lemma 5 2 1 and lemma 5 1 each root ei ej is either contained in t h or t m that is only possible when t m or t h which we have seen is not the case 3 follows from the argument of lemma 5 2 1 which shows that h 6 g 2 now we determine h by the following lemma lemma 5 3 let g an with n 2 and suppose that v ne 1 e 2 en 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h keep all relevant notations then for any 1 i n 1 there is a unique j such that ei ej e i e j h is a long root of h furthermore n is odd proof since t is not contained in h for any ei there is another el such that ei el h then the root e i e l of h is not a root of g by lemma 5 1 h e i e l is not a root plane of g and then dim g e i e l 2 so we have e i e l e k e j with k 6 i and l 6 j by an earlier observation and lemma 5 2 3 e i e j is a long root of h there do not exist p and q such that p 6 i q 6 j and e i e j e p e q so h e i e j g e i e j is a root plane of g by lemma 5 1 2 e i e j ei ej t h there does not exist another index p such that p 6 j and ei ep h because ei ep is not orthogonal to ei ej el ek m obviously the map from i to j 6 i maps j back to i it follows immediately that n must be odd after a suitable permutation of the ei we can assume h contains e 1 ek 1 e 2 ek 2 ek en 1 where k n 1 2 and at the same time m contains e 1 ek 1 e 2 ek 2 e 2 ek 2 e 3 ek 3 ek 1 e 2 k 1 ek en those are bases for the subspaces h and m the root system of h is ei ei k 1 i k e i e j 1 i j k e i e j k 1 i j k 16 thus h is isomorphic to ck sp k for the root planes we have h ei ei k g ei ei k g ei ei k g e i e j g ei ej g ei k ej k for 1 i j k and g e i e j k g ei ej k g ej ei k for 1 i j k we will see m m h i e g h is riemannian symmetric if is a root of h such that g m 6 0 and u t m then ad u g g is the same 0 a a 0 on the root planes g where restricts to thus ad u g g is a multiple of an isometry for generic u ad u maps g h onto g m and thus g m onto g h because it maps orthocomplement to orthocomplement there are no root planes of g contained in m so the above argument proves 5 4 m t m m t m t h in particular u h m t and u m h for generic u t m if w 1 w 2 m t and u t m is generic now u w 1 u w 2 h and u w 1 w 2 u w 1 w 2 w 1 u w 2 m so w 1 w 2 m t w 1 w 2 u h u w 1 w 2 h 0 also we have w 1 w 2 u w 1 w 2 u 0 so w 1 w 2 t m 0 thus 5 5 m t m t h by 5 4 and 5 5 m m h in other words g h is a symmetric homogeneous space it is locally riemannian symmetric as well to summarize we have proved the following proposition proposition 5 6 let g be a compact connect simple lie group of type an and h a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg if there is a nonzero vector v g lie g that defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous spacem g h then m is a local riemannian symmetric space with universal riemannian covering space su 2 k sp k 6 proof of theorem 1 1 for g bn in this section g bn so 2 n 1 with n 1 and 0 6 v t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h proposition 3 5 says that up to the action of the weyl group either v is a multiple of e 1 or a multiple of e 1 en we must see whether those vectors v define ck vector fields on m 17 6 a the case v e 1 en following the proof of proposition 3 5 we may suitably permute the ei and assume h re 1 ren h 2 ren and m re 2 ren h 1 let g be the connected lie subgroup of g whose lie algebra g is the centralizer of ren h 2 ren in g let h be the connected component of g h its lie algebra h h g we have a direct sum decomposition g g c in which c is the center and g so 2 n 2 h 3 corresponding to the ei with 1 i n h 1 here c ren h 2 ren we also have a direct sum decomposition h h c in which either h re 1 or h is of type a 1 with cartan subalgebra t h re 1 let g be the closed subgroup in the universal cover of g with lie algebra g and h the closed connected subgroup of g with lie algebra h the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g and g defines locally isometric riemannian normal homogeneous metrics on g h and g h respectively thus we have orthogonal decompositions g h m and g h m 6 1 since g is the centralizer of a subalgebra of h the first decomposition in 6 1 coincides with g g h g m since c h is orthogonal to m i e m g the second decomposition in 6 1 coincides with g g h g m g h g m the vector v can be decomposed as the sum of v e 1 en h 1 g and vc en h 2 en c which is orthogonal to g so by lemma 3 2 v defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h if h re 1 we can find v 1 diag 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 m ad g v then prh v prh v 1 0 which contradicts the ck property of v if h a 1 we use the weyl group of g to change it to the standard so 3 so 2 n 2 h 3 corresponding the 3 3 block at the upper left corner the argument used for the case h re 1 also leads to a contradiction in this case 6 b the case v e 1 we now consider the case v e 1 in proposition 3 5 denote e i prh ei for 1 i n they all have the same length we have e 1 2 i e 2 i 1 and e 1 2 i 1 e 2 i 1 1 in ad g v g ei thus for 1 i n e i is a root of h and dim g e i 2 ad g v also contains e 2 i 2 j e 2 j 2 i g ei ej g ei ej for 1 i j n so either e i e j or e i e j is a root of h whenever i 6 j any root of h has form e i or e i e j and it follows that h is a compact simple lie algebra from the standard description of the roots of bn cn f 4 and g 2 the e i cannot be long roots because all roots of h are of the form e i e j for i 6 j 18 if i 6 j then e i 6 e j because that would give a root e i e j 0 or 2 e j thus e i is a set of 2 n distinct roots of h since dim g e i 2 and prh ej 6 e i for i 6 j there must be a root of the form ej ek such that prh e i i e e i e k e l summarizing the above argument we have the following lemma lemma 6 2 suppose that g bn with n 1 and that v e 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h denote e i prh ei then we have the following 1 e 1 e n consists of 2 n different roots of h if 1 i j n then either e i e j or e i e j is a root of h 2 the lie algebra h is compact simple if it is isomorphic to bn cn f 4 or g 2 then the e i are short roots 3 any e i can be expressed as e i e j e k in which i j and k are different from each other because from the ad g orbit of v we can find an orthonormal basis for t as well as an orthonormal basis for g by lemma 3 3 6 3 2 n 1 dim g dim t dim h dim t h denote h dim t h then the right side of 6 3 is h 2 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 h 1 13 19 31 13 or 7 respectively when h is isomorphic to ah bh ch dh e 6 e 7 e 8 f 4 or g 2 because h n h can only be e 7 e 8 f 4 or g 2 first consider the cases where h is isomorphic to e 7 e 8 or f 4 if e i e j e k then e j and e k have an angle 3 or 2 3 so the corresponding vector e j e k is not a root of h based on this observation we have the following lemma lemma 6 4 assume g bn h e 7 e 8 or f 4 and v e 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h then 6 5 v 2 prh v 2 dim t dim t h dim g e i 1 3 whenever 1 i n proof denote dim g e i 2 k 2 and g e i k j 1 g j consider any root j of g in the above equality and assume it has the form j ep eq with p q denote ep eq because h is not isomorphic to g 2 and all the e p e q and prh j e p e q are short roots of h now prh j e p e q is not a root of h i e g j m let v g ei k j 1 g j g j then v v h v m and v h h e i is real 2 dimensional because different roots j correspond to different pairs p q for j ep eq all roots j of g are also different with each other so v is a real 4 k 2 dimensional linear space inside ad g v ad g e 1 we have an orthonormal basis of v consisting of e 1 2 i e 2 i 1 and e 1 2 i 1 e 2 i 1 1 in g ei and e 2 p 2 q e 2 q 2 p 19 e 2 p 2 q 1 e 2 q 1 2 q e 2 p 1 2 q e 2 q 2 p 1 and e 2 p 1 2 q 1 e 2 q 1 2 p 1 in each g j g j by lemma 6 a and using some arguments as before we have v 2 prh 2 dim t dim t h dim v dim v h 2 k 1 g e i 1 if h is e 7 e 8 or f 4 then by 6 3 n dim t is 9 15 or 6 respectively contradicting 6 5 finally we consider the case h g 2 and show it is possible by 6 3 we have n 3 for this case with e 1 e 2 and e 3 corresponding to the three pairs of short roots suitably choosing ei and applying sign changes ei 7 ei as appropriate we may assume t m r e 1 e 2 e 3 and the root planes of h are h ei ej g ei ej for 1 i j 3 and h 1 3 ei ej 2 ek g 13 ei ej 2 ek g ei ej g ek for i j k 1 2 3 the subalgebra h is uniquely determined up to the action of ad g since the isotropy subgroup g 2 is transitive on directions in the tangent space of s 7 spin 7 g 2 the spin 7 invariant riemannian metric on that space is the standard constant positive curvature metric now the vector v e 1 t does defines a ck vector field on s 7 spin 7 g 2 it is well known that v e 1 e 4 defines a ck vector field on the symmetric space s 7 spin 8 spin 7 for the standard imbedding so 7 so 8 but if we change the setup by a suitable outer automorphism using triality v can be changed to v e 1 which belongs to the cartan subalgebra t of the standard so 7 so 8 inside so 8 the intersection of the standard so 7 and the isotropic one is just the g 2 so v e 1 also defines a ck vector field on the riemannian symmetric s 7 spin 7 g 2 in summary we have the following proposition proposition 6 6 let g be a compact connected simple lie group with g bn where n 1 let h be closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg such that g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space assume there is a nonzero vector v g that defines a ck vector field on m g h then m g h is a locally symmetric riemannian manifold whose universal riemannian covering is s 7 spin 7 g 2 7 the proof of theorem 1 1 when g cn in this section we assume that g cn sp n with n 2 and that 0 6 v t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h according to proposition 3 5 we may assume that either v e 1 en or v e 1 20 7 a the case v e 1 en after a suitable permutation of the ei we may assume h re 1 rem 2 ren and m re 2 rem 1 consider the closed subgroup g of g whose lie algebra g is the centralizer of rem 2 ren let h be the identity component of g h then g g c where g sp m 1 corresponds to e 1 em 1 and c rem 2 ren is its center the subalgebra h h c where either h h g re 1 or h a 1 with cartan subalgebra re 1 and root plane rje 1 1 rke 1 1 let g be the analytic subgroup of g for g and let h be the analytic subgroup of g for h they are closed subgroups the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g and g defines locally symmetric riemannian normal homogeneous metrics on g h and g h respectively as argued before the orthogonal decomposition g h m is the same as g g h g m we can also decompose v as the sum of v e 1 em 1 t g and vc em 2 en c which is orthogonal to g by lemma 3 2 v defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h from the ad g orbit of v we have v 1 i diag 0 1 1 0 1 1 m i e prh v prh v 1 0 which is a contradiction remark as in the case 5 a in section 5 for n 2 v e 1 en defines a ck vector field for the constant curvature metric on s 4 n 1 that metric is normal homogeneous for s 4 n 1 so 4 n so 4 n 1 but it is not normal homogeneous for s 4 n 1 sp n sp n 1 7 b the case v e 1 here v e 1 in proposition 3 5 and we denote e i prh ei for 1 i n the e i all have the same length the orbit ad g v contains v jei i g 2 ei and prh v 6 0 6 prm v for 1 i n so 2 e i is a root of h and dim g 2 e i 2 for 1 i n suitably choosing ei with any necessary sign changes ei 7 ei we may assume for 1 i j n that the roots 2 ei and 2 ej project to the same pair of roots of h only when e i e j in other words e i e j 6 0 for 1 i j n if we have a different presentation for the root 2 e i e g 2 e i e j e k then the plus signs must be taken and e j e k e i if e i e j for some i 6 j we can permute ei so that pr 1 h e 1 contains e 1 ek where k 1 and it does not contain any other ei so g 2 e 1 1 i k g 2 ei 1 i j k g ei ej in such a way that the root plane h e 1 is linearly generated by two matrices u and w in sp k sp n with nonzero elements only in the upper left k k corner so u w which is a nonzero multiple of e 1 is represented by a matrix in re 1 rek sp k since ei ej m for 1 i j k we have e 1 1 k e 1 ek any root plane g ei ej 1 i j k is contained in m 21 let g be the closed subgroup of g with lie algebra g sp k corresponding to e 1 ek and h the identity component of g h the lie algebra h g h re 1 h e 1 the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g defines a riemannian normal homogeneous space m g h the corresponding orthogonal decomposition g h m coincides with g g h g m v e 1 g defines a ck vector field on the normal homogeneous space g h and h is spanned by w 1 iik k w 2 ja kb and w 3 jb ka where a and b are real symmetric k k matrices from w 1 r w 2 w 3 we have ab ba and a 2 b 2 ci 0 by a suitable ad g conjugation which is a so k conjugation on sp k we diag onalize a and b simultaneously by a suitable ad g conjugation and scalar multi plications i e sp k conjugation we may assume w 2 jik k and w 3 kik k notice v 1 diag 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 v diag 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 diag 1 2 i 1 2 i 1 2 i 1 2 i 0 0 and v 2 diag 1 j 1 1 v diag 1 j 1 1 diag 1 2 i 1 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 i 0 0 belong to ad g v but prh v prh v 0 this is a contradiction so the e i must all be distinct and g 2 e i g 2 ei h 2 e i for 1 i n this contradicts our earlier conclusion that dim g 2 e i 2 in summary we have proved proposition 7 1 let g be a compact connected simple lie group with g cn and n 2 let h be closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg such that g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space then there is no nonzero vector v g that defines a ck vector field on g h 8 the case g dn in this section g dn so 2 n with n 3 and 0 6 v g defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h 8 a the case v e 1 en we consider the case v e 1 en of proposition 3 5 with n 4 if n 4 we can use the outer automorphism of g that changes v to e 1 which will be discussed in the next case by an argument similar to that of proposition 3 5 2 we show prh ei ej ek el prm ei ej ek el 0 22 whenever i j k and l are different indices changing k and l arbitrarily and taking linear combinations of these two equalities prh ei and prm ei are contained in rei rej change j as well we get prh ei and prm ei are contained by j 6 i rei rej rei so either ei h or ei m for each i let m dim t m we will prove m 1 for if m 1 we can suitably permute ei so that h t re 1 rem 2 ren and m t re 2 rem 1 let g be the centralizer of rem 2 ren in g and g the analytic subgroup of g for g similarly h g h and h is the corresponding analytic subgroup then g g c where g so 2 m 2 corresponds to the 2 m 2 2 m 2 block in the upper left corner and where c rem 1 ren is the center of g observe h h c where h g h is either the abelian subalgebra re 1 or is isomorphic to a 1 with cartan subalgebra re 1 let g be the analytic subgroup of g with lie algebra g and h the analytic subgroup of g for h as we argued in section 6 a the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g defines a riemannian normal homogeneous metric on g h such that the orthogonal decomposition g h m coincides with g g h g m for the corresponding decomposition v v vc v e 1 em 1 g and vc em 2 en c g v defines a ck vector field on the normal homogeneous space m g h if h is abelian then we can choose v 1 diag 02 2 i 2 2 i 2 2 02 2 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 m ad g v then prh v prh v 1 0 which is a contradiction if h is not abelian then we can use suitable ad g action i e so 2 m 2 conjugation to move h to the subalgebra so 3 for the 3 3 block in the upper left corner we can choose v 2 diag 03 3 i 3 3 i 3 3 03 3 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 m ad g v then we again have prh v prh v 2 0 which is a contradiction this completes the proof that m 1 now we suitably permute ei so that t h re 1 ren 1 and t m ren whenever 1 i j n we have vectors v 1 k n 1 i 6 k 6 j e 2 k 1 2 k e 2 k 2 k 1 u ad g v in which the possibilities for u are e 2 i 1 2 j 1 e 2 i 2 j e 2 j 1 2 i 1 e 2 j 2 i and e 2 i 1 2 j e 2 i 2 j 1 e 2 j 1 2 i e 2 j 2 i 1 in g ei ej and e 2 i 1 2 j 1 e 2 i 2 j e 2 j 1 2 i 1 e 2 j 2 i and e 2 i 1 2 j e 2 i 2 j 1 e 2 j 1 2 i e 2 j 2 i 1 in g ei ej the condition that prh v prh v for each choice of u indicates each u h i e g ei ej h for 1 i j n a similar argument can also show 23 each ei is a root of h and g ei g ei en g ei en now up to the action of ad g h is uniquely determined and is the standard so 2 n 1 in so 2 n we can also use similar argument as for the case 5 b in section 5 to prove directly the homogeneous space is symmetric i e m m h then g h is riemannian symmetric covered by the sphere s 2 n 1 so 2 n so 2 n 1 of positive constant curvature it is well known fact that v e 1 en defines a ck vector field on it because its centralizer u n acts transitively on s 2 n 1 8 b the case v e 1 finally we consider the case v e 1 in proposition 3 5 denote e i prh ei for 1 i n they all have the same length either e i e j or e i e j is a root of h because v e 2 i 1 2 j 1 e 2 j 1 2 i 1 g ei ej g ei ej belongs to the ad g orbit of v i e prh v prh v 0 distinct roots we first prove that e 1 e n consists of 2 n distinct roots of h for if not then there are indices i 6 j such that one of e i e j 0 then 2 e i e i e j is a root of h if 2 e i e k e l then e i e k e l tells us that the pairs e i e k and e l are equal if e i 6 e k and e i e k is a root of h then using 2 e i e i e k 0 2 e i e i e k e i e k is a root of h similarly if e i e k is a root of h then e i e k is a root of h notice that 2 e i is a long root and e i e k are short roots orthogonal to each other this can only happen in a subalgebra of type c 2 thus 2 e i e k 2 e i 2 e k is also a long root of h with e i e k 0 and there must be an index l with e k e l from this argument all 2 e is are long roots of h if there are exactly m different pairs e i then h is isomorphic to cm suitably choosing ei then we can assume e i e j 6 0 for i 6 j without loss of generality we may assume that pr 1 h e 1 contains e 1 ek but no other el and does not contain any el then g ei ej m for 1 i j k and h 2 e 1 g 2 e 1 1 i j k g ei ej now e 1 h 2 e 1 h 2 e 1 is realized as a matrix in so 2 k corresponding the left upper 2 k 2 k block i e e 1 re 1 rek by our assumption ei ej t m for 1 i j k so e 1 1 k e 1 ek let g be the analytic subgroup of g with lie algebra g so 2 k corresponding the upper left 2 k 2 k corner and h the analytic subgroup for h g h re 1 h 2 e 1 then h a 1 also g m 1 i k r ei 1 ei 1 i j k g ei ej the restriction to g of the bi invariant inner product on g defines a riemannian normal homogeneous metric on g h the orthogonal decomposition g h m coincides with the decomposition g g h g m so the vector v e 1 g defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h the orbit ad g v contains an orthonormal basis of g which in turn contains an orthonormal basis for t g by lemma 3 3 2 k 1 dim g dim t g dim h dim h t 3 so k 2 24 suitably permuting the ei we can assume the distinct e i are given by e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e n 1 e n then dim g e 1 e 3 8 in which 2 dimensions belong to h and the other 6 dimensions belong to m the ad g orbit of v e 1 contains an orthonormal basis of t consisting of all the ei it also contains an orthonormal basis of g e 1 e 3 g e 1 e 3 as in lemma 3 3 we have dim t dim t h dim g e 1 e 3 g e 1 e 3 dim h g e 1 e 3 g e 1 e 3 which is a contradiction because the left side is 2 and the right side is 4 in summary we have proved lemma 8 1 suppose g dn with n 3 suppose that v e 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h denote e i prh ei for 1 i n then e 1 e n has cardinality 2 n second we consider the case where one of e i e j is a root of h and the other is not for any 1 i j n given a root of h we denote dim g 2 k and dim t h h and we express g k i 1 g i by an argument similar to that of lemma 6 4 we see n h dim t dim t h dim g 2 k i e n 2 k h thus k k is independent of the choice of denote the number of roots of g and h by and respectively then 2 k but 2 n n 1 which implies 2 h 2 kh 1 4 h 2 2 h calculate and 4 h 2 2 h for each simple lie algebra aq bq cq dq g 2 f 4 e 6 e 7 e 8 q q 1 2 q 2 2 q 2 2 q q 1 12 48 72 126 240 4 h 2 2 h 4 q 2 2 q 4 q 2 2 q 4 q 2 2 q 4 q 2 2 q 12 56 132 182 240 now for any compact simple lie algebra h of rank h the number of all roots satisfies 4 h 2 2 h with equality if and only if k 1 and h is isomorphic to a 1 g 2 or e 8 if h is not simple say h h 1 hp rq let hi denote the rank and i the root system of hi then 8 2 p i 1 i p i 1 4 h 2 i 2 hi 4 p i 1 hi 2 2 p i 1 hi 4 h 2 2 h if q 0 the last in 8 2 is strict and if p 1 then the second to last in 8 2 is strict so in those cases 4 h 2 2 h now h is simple 25 since h is simple it is isomorphic to a 1 g 2 or e 8 here a 1 would imply n 2 while we are assuming n 3 so h is g 2 or e 8 with some sign changes ei 7 ei now every e i e i 1 is a root of h as dim g e i e i 1 2 ke i e i 1 2 i e h e i e i 1 g ei ei 1 e i e i 1 g ei ei 1 g ei ei 1 t h for 1 i n thus dim t h n 1 h this is a contradiction summarizing the above argument lemma 8 3 assume g dn with n 3 and suppose that v e 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h denote e i prh ei for 1 i n then there exist i j such that both e i e j are roots of h h is simple third we will prove that h is a compact simple lie algebra suitably permuting e i we can assume both e 1 e 2 and e 1 e 2 are roots of h they are orthogonal for each i 2 either e 1 e i or e 1 e i is a root of h suitably replace some ei by its negative then we can assume e 1 e i is a root of h then we have ci 1 for i 2 such that cie 2 e 1 e i 0 then e 1 cie 2 e 1 e i e 1 e 1 e i 0 in other words e 1 e i is a root for the same simple component of h as e 1 cie 2 the roots e 1 e i 1 i n e 1 e 2 of h generate t h so h is semi simple if h is not simple then the above argument shows h h 1 h 2 where e 1 e 2 is a root of h 1 e 1 e 2 is a root of h 2 and h 1 and h 2 are simple suppose h h 1 h 2 as just described suppose that there are indices i 6 j both 2 e 1 e i is a root of h 1 and e 1 e j is a root of h 2 because e 2 e i e 1 e 2 e 1 e i t h 1 h 2 is not a root of h e 2 e i t h 1 is a root of h 1 similarly e 2 e j t h 2 is a root of h 2 then neither e i e j e i e 2 e 2 e j nor e i e j e i e 1 e 1 e j is contained in t h 1 h 2 so they are not roots of h that is a contradiction so all e 1 e i for i 2 are roots of the same h 1 or h 2 suitably choose e 2 from e 2 so that e 1 e i is a root of h 1 for 1 i n it implies rkh 1 rkh 1 and then h 2 a 1 with the only roots e 1 e 2 there does not exist any root e i e j of h for 2 i j n because otherwise it is a root of h 1 and it implies t h 1 t h which is a contradiction as e 1 e 2 e 1 e i e 1 e 2 h is orthogonal to e 1 ei e 1 e i prm e 1 ei as well for 1 i n that implies e 1 e 2 r e 1 en let g be the analytic subgroup of g with lie algebra g 1 i n r ei ei 1 1 i j n g ei ej it is the standard su n 1 in so 2 n the identity component h of g h has lie algebra h h 1 the restriction of the bi invariant inner product of g to g defines a normal homogeneous metric on g h for g h we have the decomposition g t g t h 1 g in which g coincides with g because e 1 en 0 whenever is a root of h 1 the orthogonal decomposition g h m is given by g g h g m decompose v e 1 as v vc where v 1 n n 1 e 1 e 2 en t g and 26 vc 1 n e 1 en with vc g 0 and vc g 0 so v defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h by proposition 5 6 n is even say n 2 k with k 2 and conjugation by an element of ad g carries h to the standard sp k in su n so h ck a 1 since ad g v contains an orthonormal basis for g as well as an orthonormal basis for t lemma 3 3 implies 2 n 1 dim g dim t dim h dim t h 2 k 2 k 3 k 1 not an integer unless k 3 but if k 3 then 2 n 1 5 while 2 k 2 k 3 k 1 6 so in any case this is a contradiction summarizing the above arguments we have proved lemma 8 4 assume g dn with n 3 and suppose that v e 1 t defines a ck vector field on the riemannian normal homogeneous space g h then the lie algebra h is simple since h is simple the ratio r e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 can only be 3 1 2 1 or 1 the e i cannot all be mutually orthogonal because that would imply t h a contradiction if r 6 1 so h has two root lengths and must be bh or ch with h dim t h or f 4 with h 4 or g 2 with h 2 if r 1 and we have e i and e j such that i 6 j and e i e j 6 0 either e i e j or e i e j is a root whose length is different from that of e 1 e 2 so in that case also h is isomorphic to bh ch f 4 or g 2 as seen earlier ad g v contains orthonormal bases of t and g by lemma 3 3 8 5 2 n 1 dim g dim t dim h dim t h the g 2 case when h is isomorphic to g 2 the right side of 8 5 is 7 so n 4 in this case e i and e j must have an angle 3 or 2 3 when i 6 j the only possible choices for all e i are e 1 e 2 and the shorter pair among e 1 e 2 one can t have four different pairs of e i this is a contradiction the bh and ch cases when h is isomorphic to bh or ch the right side of 8 5 is 2 h 1 so n h 1 note that h t is a hyperplane in t so the complement has 2 components with suitable sign changes ei 7 ei we may suppose that all ei belong to the same component and they all have the same projection to m so ei ej h for i j and m t r e 1 en since e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 is a long root of h with length 2 e 1 e 2 can have length 1 only when n 4 in that case e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 1 e 3 e 2 e 4 and e 1 e 4 e 2 e 3 are the only three possible pairs of short roots that are orthogonal to each other so h is isomorphic to b 3 where the root system contains all above shorts roots and all long roots of the form ei ej up to ad g conjugacy now h is uniquely determined and it satisfies the symmetric space condition m m h by a suitable outer automorphism of d 4 it can be changed back to the standard so 7 inside g so 8 and so g h is a locally riemannian symmetric space covered by the round s 7 spin 8 spin 7 so 8 so 7 at the same time the automorphism 27 changes v e 1 to a vector of the form e 1 e 4 which is well known to define a ck vector field on s 7 the f 4 case for the rest of this section h is isomorphic to f 4 then the right side of 8 5 is 13 so n 7 for simplicity we rescale the inner product of g so that e i 1 for 1 i n then e 1 e 2 must be 0 or 13 our next step is to prove the case that e 1 e 2 are roots of h with e 1 e 2 13 is impossible assume conversely it happens then one of e 1 e 2 is short with length 2 3 and the other is long with length 2 2 3 for any indices i 6 j either e i e j or e i e j is a root of h with length 2 3 or 2 2 3 so ei ej 13 for 1 i j n we make appropriate sign changes ei 7 ei so that e 1 e i 13 for all i 1 so if e 1 e i is a root of h it is a long root and if e 1 e i is a root of h it is a short root for any i 2 if e 1 e i is a short root of h then e 1 e i has an angle 4 with the long root e 1 e 2 because e 1 e i e 1 e 2 1 e i e 2 0 so e 1 e i e 1 e 2 e 1 e i e 1 e 2 cos 4 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 4 3 that implies e 2 e i 13 if e 1 e i is a long root of h then e 1 e i has an angle 4 with the short root e 1 e 2 because e 1 e i e 1 e 2 1 e i e 2 0 arguing as above e 2 e i 13 assume i 6 j with i j 3 n if e 1 e i and e 1 e j are both long roots of h they must have an angle 3 because e 1 e i e 1 e j 53 e i e j 0 so e 1 e i e 1 e j 43 which implies e i e j 13 if e 1 e i is a long root and e 1 e j is short they must have an angle 4 because e 1 e i e 1 e j 1 e i e j 0 so e 1 e i e 1 e j 43 which implies e i e j 13 based on the above observations we see if there is e i i 2 such that e 1 e i is a long root of h we can suitably permute ej j 2 to make i 3 then the matrix e p e q 1 p q 5 must be of the form 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 or 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 which is non singular in either case that contradicts dim t h 4 so h has no long root of the form e 1 e i i 2 furthermore h has no long root of the form e 2 e i i 2 for if e 2 e i is a long root with i 2 then it has an angle 2 3 with the long root e 1 e 2 of h i e e 1 e i e 1 e 2 e 2 e i is a long root of h which contradicts our previous statement the number of long roots with the form e i e j is at most 22 consisting of e 1 e 2 and at most a pair of long roots from each set e i e j for 2 i j 7 the number of long roots of h can not reach 24 which is a contradiction this completes the proof in the f 4 case that we do not have roots e 1 e 2 of h with e 1 e 2 13 28 next in the f 4 case we consider the situation where e 1 e 2 0 and e 1 e 2 are roots of h since h has no root of length 2 any short root e i e j has the length 1 with e i e j 12 and any long root e i e j has the length 2 with e i e j 0 if i j and k are distinct e i e j 0 and e i e k 0 then for suitable c 1 1 and c 2 1 the roots e i c 1 e j and e i c 2 e k of h are long because e i c 1 e j e i c 2 e j 1 e i e j 0 the combination c 1 e j c 2 e k e i c 1 e j e i c 2 e j is a long root of h that implies e j e k 0 now 1 7 is a disjoint union a a sa such that i if i 6 j in the same sa then e i e j and ii if i sa and j sb with a 6 b then ei ej 12 if i 6 j are in the same sa and ei ej are both long roots of h then for whenever k sa i 6 k 6 j there is a long root of the form ei ek it has angle 3 with both ei ej and ei ej so both ek ej are long roots of h similarly both ei ek are long roots of h extending this argument whenever k 6 l in the same sa both ek el are long roots of h each sa 4 for if sa contains five elements then dim t h 4 which is impossible suppose sa 4 with 1 2 sa we may permute the ei so that sa 1 2 3 4 then e 1 e 4 is an orthonormal basis of t h by our previous observation e i e j provide all long roots of h from the standard presentation 2 12 of f 4 we can see for any orthogonal pair of long roots and of h 1 2 are short roots of h thus the e i 12 e i e j e i e j 1 i 4 and i 6 j are short roots of h but e i 1 2 e 1 e 4 for i 5 6 and 7 so any short root e i e j of h for 1 i 4 j 7 is a vector of the form 1 2 e 1 e 4 and each set e j e k 4 j k 7 contains at most one pair of short roots resulting in 3 pairs in total that is not enough for the presentation just above for all the e i 1 i 4 there is at least a short root e i of h 1 i 4 which can not be given as any e j e k this is a contradiction to our observation for the root system of h so there is no sa with sa 4 and 1 2 sa assume that one of the sets sb satisfies sb 4 and it does not contain 1 and 2 then we can permute the ei so that sb 4 5 6 7 from argument above if 4 i j 7 then either e i e j or e i e j is not a root of h so sb can at most provide 6 pairs of long roots of h the only way that h can have 12 pairs of long roots is that 1 2 and 3 must belong to the same sa and e i e j are long roots of h for 1 i j 3 in that case we look at the short roots each set e i e j 1 i 4 j 7 can only provide one pair of short roots and in fact it must provide one pair to make the 12 pairs of short roots of h f 4 now if is a root of h then h g is a root plane of g say h g then is also a root of g because r h h g g r then the root system of h is a subset of the root system of g that is impossible because all the roots of g have the same length this completes the argument that none of the sa can contain more than 3 elements 29 since it has at most 3 elements each sa can contribute no more than 12 long roots for h to have 24 long roots 1 7 a a sa is the union of three subsets two with three elements each one with one element suitably permuting the ei we can assume a a b c sa 1 2 3 sb 4 5 6 and sc 7 all ei ej must be long roots of h for 1 i j 3 or 4 i j 6 they give all 24 long roots of h from above argument e i 1 i 7 are short roots of h because they can be presented as 1 2 for an orthogonal pair of long roots and of h so for 1 i 7 we can find j and k such that e i e j e k it is easy to see if i 4 then j 3 and k 3 further more j and k can not both be chosen from 4 5 6 so one of them is from 4 5 6 which must be different for different e is and the other is just 7 so suitably substitute some e is by e is we can have e 1 e 4 e 7 0 e 2 e 5 e 7 0 and e 3 e 6 e 7 0 i e m is linearly spanned by e 1 e 4 e 7 e 2 e 5 e 7 and e 3 e 6 e 7 direct calculation shows for v e 1 and v e 7 in the ad g orbit of v prm v prm v which is a contradiction to summarize we have the following proposition proposition 8 6 suppose that g is a compact connected simple lie group with g lie g dn where n 1 h is a closed subgroup with 0 dimh dimg and g h is a riemannian normal homogeneous space assume there is a nonzero vector v g which defines a ck vector field on g h then g h is a locally riemannian symmetric space which is covered by the sphere s 2 n 1 spin 2 n spin 2 n 1 so 2 n so 2 n 1 theorem 1 1 follows by combining propositions 3 1 4 3 5 6 6 6 7 1 and 8 6 references 1 v n berestovskii yu g nikonorov
