lusztig s the ory of character sheaves it develops a notion of character sheaves on reductive lie algebras which is more general then such notion of lusztig and closer to lusztig s theory of character sheaves on groups the de velopment is self contained and independent of the characteristic p of the ground field the results for lie algebras are then used to give simple and uniform proofs for some of lusztig s results on groups introduction this paper gives a self contained presentation of character sheaves on reduc tive lie algebras independent of the characteristic p of the field except for the section on the characteristic varieties which have not been defined for p 0 for simplicity the formulations in the text involve only the d modules usually irregular i e the case p 0 however the definitions have obvious modifi cations in the light of lu 3 for perverse sheaves in characteristic p 0 and then the proofs are the same the first section studies two radon transforms and the second defines sheaves monodromic under an action of a vector group in the third section we linearize lusztig s construction of character sheaves on reductive groups and show that the resulting character sheaves on lie algebras are precisely the fourier trans forms of orbital sheaves in sections 4 and 5 we give an elementary proof of results of lu 3 proofs of lu 3 are for sufficiently large p 0 and use results from lu 1 lu 2 the main result is that the fourier transforms of orbital sheaves are precisely the irreducible constituents of sheaves obtained by induc ing from cuspidal sheaves 5 3 for p 0 character sheaves can be described by having a nilpotent characteristic variety and a monodromic behavior in some directions 6 4 this is analogous to a result for groups gi mv the last research supported in part by nsf 1 http arxiv org abs math 0411532 v 1 section uses nearby cycles to reprove some results on induction and restriction from lu 2 the purpose of this paper is to give a perspective to lu 3 and an introduc tion to character sheaves on reductive groups the original goal was a direct proof in characteristic zero of the fact that the cuspidal sheaves on groups are character sheaves theorem 6 8 a similar proof was found independently by ginzburg gi lusztig s original proof is spread though the series of papers lu 2 i owe a debt of gratitude to misha finkelberg for his decisive help in bringing this paper to completion notation we fix an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0 for a k variety x m x denotes the category of holonomic d modules on x and d x db m x is its bounded derived category our basic reference for d modules is bo if a connected algebraic group a acts on x then ma x denotes the subcategory of equivariant sheaves in m x and da x is the corresponding triangulated category constructed by bernstein and lunts see bl mv for any morphism of varieties x y there are direct image and inverse image functors f f and f f and the duality functor dx d x o d x bo if the map f is equivariant under a group a the same functors exist on the level of equivariant derived categories bl mv we will use a normalized pull back functor def dimy dimx and if is an embedding then f x will denote the pull back f for dual vector bundles v and v one has the fourier transform equivalence fv m v m v its basic properties can be found in br kl g will denote a reductive algebraic group over k and p l u a levi decomposition of a parabolic subgroup while g p l u will be the corresponding lie algebras we fix an invariant non degenerate bilinear form on g and use it to identify g and g and l and l etc 1 now fourier transform fg is an autoequivalence of m g the adjoint action of g g is denoted gx def ad g x 1 grothendieck transform g and horocycle trans form h 1 1 let b be the flag variety of g viewed as the moduli of borel subalgebras of g then b b x b g x b is the g homogeneous vector bundle over b with the fiber b at b b similarly there are vector bundles n g g n with the fibers b b g g b b at b b 1 this is just for simplicity of exposition 2 1 2 grothendieck resolution of g is the projection b g g while springer resolution of the nilpotent cone n g is its restriction n g 1 n s g 1 3 define grothendieck and horocycle transformsd b g d g h d g n by g g g and h q p using the diagram b g p q h hh hh hh hh b x m mm mm mm mm m defined by g g n x b x b b their left adjoints are g g g and h p q 1 4 theorem i fourier transform interchanges g and h fb g h fg hence also g and h ii fg g ob s on iii g g g ob og iv h h s on remarks a ii is a result of kashiwara br while iii on g instead of g appears in gi mv b the convolution in d is defined by a b a b for the addition g g g proof i the map adjoint to g q g n is the inclusion b j g so fg h fg q p j fg p j p fg g fg g fg ii the sheaves g ob and s on on g are direct images from g of b j g ob and n j g on these two are switched by the fourier transform since b b b for b b iii a og g ob g g a ob ob g ga now iv follows since fg a b fga og fgb 1 5 corollary functors g g and h h both contain identity functors as direct summands proof it is well known that g is a small resolution hence g ob is a semisim ple sheaf and one summand is og now the claim for g follows from ii in the theorem and for h one uses i 3 1 6 analogous transforms exist for g equivariant sheaves dg g n h dg g g hoo dg b g oo and from now on we restrict ourselves to the g equivariant setting 1 7 a basic tool in the equivariant setting are bernstein s induction functors ab a b see mv if a group a acts on a smooth variety x then for any subgroup b the forgetful functor fab da x db x has a left adjoint ab dima b which one can describe via the diagram a x p a b x a x x here g x g x x gx for any a db x there is a unique up to a unique isomorphism a da a b x such that a p a in da b a x now a ba a a similarly aba a a is a shift of the right adjoint of the forgetful functor if a b is complete then ab a b since the forgetful functor commutes with all standard functors including the fourier transform if x is a vector bundle the same is also true for ab 1 8 fix a borel subalgebra b b put n b b and consider the maps b r b j g g n s g n r x b x s y b y 1 9 lemma the following diagram is commutative dg b r g dg g h goo dg g n s h oo db b gb r oo g b j dg g j oo db g n gb s oo g b oo all vertical arrows are inverse equivalence of categories and they also commute with the fourier transform proof since the diagram is self adjoint the statements for the first and the second square are exchanged by the fourier transform since b g b b the functors r and gb r are inverse equivalences by lemma 1 4 in mv the pull back r commutes with the fourier transform hence so does gb r for 4 commutativity observe that r g r g j and since g is a g equivariant map g gb r g g b r g b g r g b j 1 10 in the remainder we use identifications from lemma 1 9 as definitions so b j g g n and db b g m mm mm mm db g n h wwoo oo oo oo h gb h f g b dg g h 77 oooooooo g ffmmmmmmm g gb j g j 0 fgb the theorem 1 4 and its corollary still hold in this setting 2 monodromic sheaves on vector spaces let v u be finite dimensional vector spaces over k 2 1 sheaf 0 6 a m v is said to be a character sheaf if a a a for v v v the equivalent condition on b fva is b b b for the diagonal v v v this implies suppb 2 v hence b is supported at a point now the condition is equivalent to irreducibility of b so the character sheaves on v are precisely the connections l v for l fv v opt 2 2 let u q v be the quotient map for any finite subset v we say that a sheaf b m u is monodromic if the support of fub lies in 1 q 1 such sheaves form a serre subcategory m u of m u the full triangulated sub category of d u consisting of sheaves with monodromic cohomologies is pre cisely the derived category of m u observe that m u m u for v a sheaf b m u is monodromic if and only if b l b 2 3 the category of v monodromic sheaves on u is the categorym u v def v m u a sheaf b m u is monodromic if and only if the action of v on u b via v u u du is locally finite this is the requirement that the action of v u ou on u fub is locally finite i e that the support of fub is finite modulo v so the category of v monodromic sheaves on v is semisimple while this would not be true for a torus 5 3 character sheaves and the orbital sheaves 3 1 fix a borel subalgebra b of g and denote n n and h b n then the diagram h b oooo j g g n oo h is self adjoint for any finite subset h h let p b be the category of sheaves on b supported on 1 so thatm g n fb p b is the category of sheaves on g n which are monodromic in the direction of h g n also we denote p b p b m g n m g n and in the equivariant versionm b g n m g n mb g n etc 3 2 we define character sheaves on g as irreducible constituents of the coho mology sheaves of complexes h a for a mb b m b b see 1 10 on the other hand an irreducible g equivariant sheaf on g is said to be orbital lu 3 if its support is the closure of a single g orbit 3 3 lemma lu 1 a let x s n g be a jordan decomposition with s semisimple and n nilpotent let p l u be a parabolic subalgebra of g such that l zg s then ux x u for the unipotent subgroup u corresponding to u b for any h the semisimple components of all elements of 1 are conjugate c for any g orbit in g b is finite proof a appears in the proof of lemma 2 7 in lu 1 for b choose semisimple s v 1 s n and put l zg s and p l b l u now s is the semisimple component of any element of s l n and by a adu s l n s l n u s n in c choose x for g g gx b is equivalent to x g 1 b and then gx is the same as the image of x in g 1 b g 1 n h so b is the image of the fiber g 1 x under the map bo h given by b x 7 x b b b b b h this is a complete subvariety of an affine variety so it is finite 3 4 theorem see theorem 5 b in lu 3 character sheaves are the same as fourier transforms of orbital sheaves 3 5 proposition orbital sheaves are exactly the irreducible constituents of complexes g b with b pb b proofs the first claim is the fourier transform of the second sincemb g n fb pb b and fg h g fg theorem 1 4 if c is an irreducible constituent of g d for some d pb b then this d can be chosen to be irreducible now supp d 1 for some h therefore supp c lies in the closure of 6 ad g 1 and this is covered by finitely many g orbits lemma 3 3 b and c is orbital conversely let c be an orbital sheaf by the corollary 1 5 c is a constituent of g g c but g c j 0 c is in pb b by lemma 3 3 c 3 6 remark let us say that the l packet of character sheaves attached to an orbit c in g consists of fourier transforms of all orbital sheaves with the support c its elements are in bijection with the irreducible representations of 0 zg x for any x c if x has jordan decomposition s n and l zg s this is 0 zl n the semisimple part of c is a semisimple orbit in g so it corresponds to a weyl group orbit in h we say that is the infinitesimal character of sheaves in the l packet of c so a character sheaf a has infinitesimal character if h a m b g n or equivalently if a is a constituent of some h b with b m b g n 4 cuspidal sheaves by observing that the restriction functor commutes with the fourier trans form we obtain an elementary proof of lusztig s characterization of cuspidal sheaves c in terms of the support of c and f c 4 1 restriction and induction let p be a parabolic subgroup of g with the unipotent radical u and p p u let g p u and p be the corresponding lie algebras restriction or u homology functor resgp dg g dp p is given in terms of the cartesian diagram p i g p j by resgp i fgp j f g p g u for convenience we have chosen to use the dual of the functor from lu 3 we will see in 4 7 that this does not matter the left adjoint of resgp is the induction indgp g p i dimg p gp i 4 2 lemma restriction and induction commute with the fourier transform 7 proof it suffices to look at the restriction since and j are adjoints of i and fp i fgp j dim u f g p fg j f g p fg the following two observations and their proofs are from lemma 2 7 in lu 1 4 3 lemma let x s n be the jordan decomposition of x g let p l u be a parabolic subalgebra with a levi factor zg s then for any a m g x l resgpa x g a 2 dimu proof we omit the forgetful functor from the notation and use the base change x l resgpa x u x x u i g a now x u ux by 3 3 a and the u equivariance gives i a ox u c x x u i a ox u x g a dimu so the claim follows from u pt ou opt dim u 4 4 lemma any sheaf a mg g such that res g pa 0 for all proper parabolics p is supported in z g n proof for any 0 6 a mg g there is a smooth g invariant subvariety s j g open and dense in the support of a and such that j a is a connection e on s for x in s define s n l p as in 4 3 then x l resgpa x s e 2 dim u 6 0 therefore p g i e s z g so z g n contains x and then also s and s 4 5 lemma let p l u be a parabolic subalgebra and a mg g if supp a n then supp resgpa n l proof if x supp resgpa l then x u meets suppa n hence x n 4 6 an irreducible sheafa mg g is said to be cuspidal lu 3 if i res g pa 0 for any proper parabolic subalgebra p and ii a l b for a character sheaf l on z g see 3 1 and some sheaf b on g g 4 7 theorem see lu 3 let g be a semisimple an irreducible sheaf a mg g is cuspidal if and only if a and fga are supported in n proof since the fourier transform commutes with the restriction ifa is cus pidal so is fga then they are both supported in n by lemma 4 4 conversely suppose now that a and fga live on n 8 for any parabolic p l u both b resgpa and flb res g p fga are supported in l n l l by the lemma 4 5 on the other hand if we write b b 0 z l o 0 for a sheaf b m l l then flb f l l b oz l has a z l invariant support now if p is proper then z l 6 0 hence b 0 so a is cuspidal remark a similar proof was found independently by ginzburg gi 4 8 corollary let g be semisimple the set of cuspidal sheaves is finite and invariant under duality any cuspidal sheaf is a character sheaf and an orbital sheaf it is gm monodromic and has regular singularities proof since g has finitely many orbits in n any g equivariant sheaf b supported on n is orbital and with regular singularities since the fundamental groups of g orbits are finite there are finitely many irreducible b s the fourier transform fg a of a cuspidal sheaf a is supported in n so it is an orbital sheaf so a is a character sheaf since the duality commutes with fg the dual of a is again cuspidal finally by the gm invariance of nilpotent orbits a is smooth on gm orbits i e gm monodromic 5 admissible sheaves the goal of this section is to identify two approaches to character sheaves i by induction from monodromic sheaves on g n and ii by induction from cuspidal sheaves on levi factors in the standard terminology this is the claim that the classes of character sheaves and admissible sheaves coincide and this is essentially the theorem 5 from lu 3 one direction that the admissible sheaves are character sheaves will be essentially obvious by now the proof of the converse is based on understanding the behavior of character sheaves on the lusztig strata in g i e the behavior under equisingular change of the semisimple part of an element of g this is stated as character sheaves are quasi admissible the proof is essentially from lu 1 one can simplify it here by proving instead the fourier transform of the main result stated in 5 9 but we use this version in the next section 5 1 admissible sheaves are defined as irreducible constituents of all indgpa for parabolic subalgebras p and cuspidal sheaves a on p lu 3 5 2 lemma if a and b are character resp orbital sheaves on g and p then the same holds for all irreducible constituents of resgpa and ind g p b the complex indgp b is semisimple proof fourier transform reduces the lemma to the orbital case the semi simplicity of the induced sheaf follows from the decomposition theorem since orbital sheaves are of geometric origin the rest of the proof is the same as for proposition 3 5 9 5 3 theorem admissible sheaves are the same as character sheaves 5 4 the class of character sheaves contains cuspidal sheaves by 4 8 and is closed under induction by 5 2 so it contains all admissible sheaves for the converse we will notice that character sheaves are quasi admissible in 5 6 and use this to show in 5 8 that character sheaves are admissible 5 5 for a levi subalgebra l of g we call zr l x l zg x l the regular part of the center z l of l it appears in the subvarieties sl o g zr l o of g indexed by nilpotent orbits o in l this gives the lusztig stratification g sl o lu 1 we say that a sheaf a mg g is quasi admissible if for any l and o all irreducible constituents of zr l o g a are of the form l zr l e for a character sheaf l on z l and a connection e on o see lu 2 5 6 lemma any character sheaf a is quasi admissible in particular it is smooth on the strata sl o proof for a pair l o choose a parabolic subalgebra p l u now the proof of 4 3 gives zr l o l resgpa zr l o g a 2 dim u by 5 2 irreducible constituents of resgpa are character sheaves so they are of the form l f for a character sheaf l on z l and f m l l therefore the constituents of have the needed property 5 7 corollary let g be semisimple for an irreducible sheaf a mg g the following is equivalent i a is cuspidal ii a is a character sheaf supported on n iii a is both a character sheaf and an orbital sheaf proof i ii is known and ii iii is obvious finally if a is a character sheaf then lemma 5 6 implies that the support of a is the closure of some stratum sl o if a is also orbital then l g and sl o o n now iii i follows from 4 7 since fga is also an orbital character sheaf 5 8 lemma let a be an irreducible quasi admissible sheaf on g i a is the irreducible extension of a connection e on one of the strata sl o ii connection e a zr l o is irreducible and its irreducible extension a to a sheaf on l is a constituent of res g pa iii a is a constituent of indgp a iv if a is also a character sheaf then a is cuspidal proof i is obvious denote s zr l o then by we have s l resgpa e up to a shift so for ii it suffices to see that s is open in supp resgpa 10 otherwise there would exist a smooth subvariety t of p s u such that t meets s u and t l a 6 0 one can make t small enough to lie in some stratum s l o now sl o meets s u us sl o and sl o g a 6 0 this gives s l o sl o pick a cartan subalgebra h of l and let w and wl be the weyl groups of g and l we can suppose that for some w w subvariety t lies in pwps pwus pw s u hence in p pw s u p w s u p t let a p h wl correspond to c h wl c p p c p for any root of h in wl the product u wl u c h wl vanishes on a t since the semisimple parts of elements of w s u lie in zr wl so a vanishes on t and on the non empty subvariety t s u since for s zr l and n o u one has a s n s wl we find that all roots of wl vanish at some s zr l therefore wl l now the image of t in p l is l zr l wo its closure can not meet s otherwise wo 6 o wo and dim wo dim o iii let s g p s u sl o be the conjugation map then sl o g indgpa e e os since by lemma 3 3 a map can be identified with the map g l s g ng l o s we see that os has osl o as a summand finally since supp indgpa g s u sl o we are done iv according to ii and 5 2 if a is a character sheaf then so is a since supp a z l corollary 5 7 implies that a is cuspidal 5 9 corollary orbital sheaves are precisely the irreducible constituents of sheaves indgp c s where c is a cuspidal sheaf on l l and s is the irreducible sheaf supported at a point s z l 6 characteristic varieties in this section we only consider k c since in positive characteristic there is yet no satisfactory notion of characteristic variety the characteristic variety of f d g is a subvariety of t g g g g g we say that it is nilpotent if it lies in g n 6 1 let g be semisimple and consider an irreducible a mg g supported in n then a is gm monodromic and regular hence prg cha supp fga br therefore a is cuspidal cha is nilpotent 11 6 2 it is easy to see that the characteristic variety of any character sheaf is nilpotent for any b mb section 3 1 monodromic property implies that ch b t g n g n b actually lies in g n n and therefore ch g g n b g n so it suffices to apply the principle that ch gbf g ch f for f with regular singularities this is the lemma 1 2 in mv however the proof remains correct for irregular d modules when the homogeneous space g b is complete the extension of this lemma to irregular sheaves and arbitrary homogeneous spaces is not true 6 3 theorem an irreducible sheaf a mg g is a character sheaf if and only if a is quasi admissible and ch a is nilpotent proof it remains to show that a quasi admissible a with ch a g n is a character sheaf since a is quasi admissible we can use use lemma 5 8 i iii its proof and notation it remains to prove a version of 5 8 iv if ch a is nilpotent then a is cuspidal this is equivalent by 6 1 to ch a is nilpotent since a is quasi admissible ch a is the union of conormal bundles to z l o for some nilpotent l orbits o o let o be one of the orbits contributing to ch a since for z zr l n o and x z n the conormal space at x is t s l o g x z l tx gx z l zg x z l l n t z l o l x it suffices to see that t s l o g ch a let l j zr l o i g so that a is a constituent of j i a hence t z l o l ch j i a to compare a and i a we use the radical u of the opposite parabolic subgroup and the map u u zr l o g defined by u u z n uu z n the image s of is open in supp a since supp a sl o g p zr l o u g p z l o u and by lemma 3 3 a s u zr l o u the map is finite and any z zr l has a neighborhood v in zr l such that the restriction of to u u v o is an isomorphism onto its image which is open in s to check this let di ui ui zi ni u u zr l o i 1 2 3 if di dj then sij u 1 i u 1 i ujuj ng l since sijzj zi so if d 1 d 2 d 3 and s 12 l s 13 l then d 2 d 3 first s 23 l then u 12 u 3 u p 1 and so lemma 3 3 a gives d 2 d 3 since a is g equivariant a ou u i a now the above properties of imply that t s l o g ch a 6 4 for f mg g and x g the fiber chxf chf t x g lies in the conormal space t gx g x zg x so chf is nilpotent if and only if ch f for x y g n y zg x the following is the lie algebra analogue of laumon s result for groups la 12 6 5 lemma is a lagrangian subvariety it is actually the union of some of t s l o g proof the fiber of at y n is zg y t gy g y so from the point of view of the projection to n is the union of conormal bundles to all nilpotent orbits so is lagrangian now let o be a nilpotent orbit in a levi factor l and s zr l n o then the tangent space ts n zr l o z l n l is orthogonal to zn l n zn s n t s n g so t s l o g and since is lagrangian it is a union of some of t s l o g 6 6 for sheaves on the group g one defines resgp and cuspidality in an anal ogous way by identifying n g with the unipotent cone in g we will not cause any confusion since for sheaves supported on n the exponential map intertwines resgp and res g p we know that supp res g pa l n lemma 4 5 and similarly on the group in order to calculate resgp a resp res g pa we integrate over cosets ey u resp y u for y n l but ey u ey u 6 7 theorem any cuspidal sheaf a on a semisimple group g has a nilpotent characteristic variety in particular it is a character sheaf remark lusztig proved in any characteristic that cuspidal sheaves on a group are character sheaves theorem 23 1 b in lu 2 the above theorem gives a simpler proof but only in characteristic zero a similar proof was found by ginzburg gi proof the second sentence follows from the first since any irreducible g equivariant regular d module on g with a nilpotent characteristic variety is a character sheaf gi mv the first claim is that ch a t g g g g g actually lies in g n if supp a n then the claim follows from 6 7 and 6 1 to reduce the situation to this case we follow lu 1 the pull back of a to any cover of g is obviously cuspidal so we can suppose that g is simply connected choose s e and x sn s as in the proof of lemma 4 4 then h zg s is connected it cannot lie in a proper levi subgroup l of g since we could repeat the proof of 4 4 and get resgp a 6 0 therefore h is semisimple and s is of finite order so g has finitely many orbits in s and we can assume that s gx is a single orbit let o hn and let ah be the irreducible extension of the connection s 1 e so from o to h since supp a s g so g h o we see that ch a is the union of conormal bundles for subvarieties g so g over all h orbits o in o such that t so l ch ah for any v o t g so g sv zg sv zh v t o h v so it remains to see that ah is cuspidal 13 let p l u be a parabolic subgroup of g such that ph lh uh for ph p h etc is a parabolic subgroup of h let v o ph th vuh o and t svu g so the projection to the semisimple part of the jordan decomposition gives an algebraic map t gs p it is a restriction of the map g so g h so g h s gs by composing with p p we find that im gs su since us is a connected component of gs su 1 us u 1 s u svu so u sth u uh sth is open in t therefore the integral of a over 1 us vanishes by u equivariance the same is true for the integral a over sth finally since sth g a th h ah up to a shift ah is cuspidal 7 an application of nearby cycles let c be a smooth curve and o c any function f x c defines exact functors of nearby and vanishing cycles m x f f mf 1 0 x from d modules on x to the subcategory of d modules on x supported in the fiber f 1 o be suppose that a group g acts on x and fixes the function f 7 1 lemma for any subgroup b such that g b is complete functor gb commutes with the equivariant versions of f and f proof computing gb involves inverse images for smooth maps and direct images for proper maps see 1 7 and these commute with f and f 7 2 as a consequence nearby and vanishing cycles will commute with h g and induction this gives a simple proof for the following result of lusztig 7 3 theorem lu 2 let a and b be character sheaves resp orbital sheaves on g and l then i indgp b is a semisimple sheaf ii resgpa d 0 l iii indgp b and res g pa do not depend on the choice of a parabolic subalgebra p l u proof as usual it suffices to look at the orbital sheaves since b is an orbital sheaf on l we have b s c for an orbital sheaf c ml l l and s s l opt for some s z l suppose that c is supported in n l and s zr l then g s n l g l s n l and for any n n l we have s n u u s n this shows that for l j p poo i g indgp b g p i p b gp i p lj b g l ij b 14 is a sheaf independent of p the point was that in this case the parabolic induction is just the naive induction from a levi factor indgp b ind g l b for the general s z l we construct a sheaf on l a 1 by b c k for k s c c c k z l a 1 such that s c zr l for c in some open dense u a 1 by the above calculation sheaf ind b is independent of p on g u hence so is ind b ind b indb by the transitivity of induction and by corollary 5 9 claim i and the induction part of iii follow for all orbital sheaves since indgp and res g p are adjoint functors between full subcategories of dg g and dl l consisting of complexes supported on finitely many orbits we also get the restriction part of iii the claim ii also follows by adjunction since for i 0 we have 0 hom ind g p b a i hom b resgpa i hence hj resgpa 0 for i 0 7 4 remarks i the proof is self contained for the class of sheaves supported in nilpotent cones this can be used for a proof of the theorem 5 3 which avoids lemma 5 8 ii actually resgpa is also a semi simple sheaf lu 2 a simple proof in characteristic zero was found by ginzburg gi 1 7 5 let s n g be the springer resolution of n then the proof above shows that the springer sheaf s on is the limit lim c 0 c of delta distributions c c g oc on regular semisimple conjugacy classes c more precisely any regular semisimple conjugacy class c defines a gm family of d modules s c s gm and the nearby cycle limit of the family at s 0 is the springer sheaf 15 references be a beilinson how to glue perverse sheaves lecture notes in mathematics 1289 1987 42 51 bl bernstein i lunts v
