conjectural depth zero local langlands correspondence of debacker reeder agrees with the known depth zero local langlands correspondence for the groupgl f where is prime and f is a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic 0 we also prove that if one assumes a certain compatibility condition between adler s and howe s construction of supercuspidal representations then the conjectural positive depth local langlands correspon dence of reeder also agrees with the known positive depth local langlands correspondence for gl f 1 introduction let f be a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero let g be a connected reductive group defined over f the local langlands correspondence asserts that there is a finite to one map from the set of admissible representations of g f to the set of langlands parameters of g f satisfying various conditions until recently this has only been proven for special cases of groups such as gl n f sp 4 f and u 3 the local langlands correspondence for gl n f has been proven independently by harris taylor and henniart more recently debacker reeder and reeder in 6 and 10 have described conjectural local langlands correspondences for a more general class of groups and certain classes of langlands parameters despite the fact that their correspondences satisfy several requirements that the langlands correspondence should have their correspondences are still conjectural one would therefore like to know whether they agree at least with the proven correspondences in the known cases we prove that the correspondence of 6 agrees with the known correspondence for gl f and that the correspodnence of 10 agrees with the known correspondence for gl f if one assumes a certain compatibility condition which we describe later for gl n f the constructions of harris taylor henniart and debacker reeder and reeder use different methods we first recall the classical construction of the tame local langlands corre spondence for gl f as in 9 we note that a tame local langlands correspondence for gl n f was conjectured by moy in 9 for general n because of recent work of bushnell and henniart see 3 the correspondence of 9 is indeed correct for gl f a prime definition 1 1 let e f be an extension of degree relatively prime to the residual charac teristic of f and let be a character of e the pair e f is called admissible if does not factor through the norm from a proper subfield of e containing f 1 http arxiv org abs 1010 6059 v 4 we write p f for the set of f isomorphism classes of admissible pairs e f where e f is a degree extension for more information about admissible pairs see 9 let a 0 f denote the set of supercuspidal representations of gl f howe constructs a map see 8 p f a 0 f e f 7 this map is a bijection see 9 let g 0 f denote the set of irreducible dimensional representa tions of wf where wf is the weil group of f we then have a bijection see 9 p f g 0 f e f 7 ind wf we the local langlands correspondence is then given by 7 for some subtle finite order character of e see 3 in the case of depth zero supercuspidal representations there is only one extension e f to deal with namely the unramified extension of f of degree on the other hand the constructions of debacker reeder see 6 and reeder see 10 ex tensively use bruhat tits theory to a certain class of langlands parameters for an unramified connected reductive group g they associate a character of a torus to which they attach a col lection of supercuspidal representations on the pure inner forms of g f a conjectural l packet they are also able to isolate the part of this packet corresponding to a particular pure inner form and prove that their correspondences satisfy various natural conditions such as stability specifically we will prove the following let e f be the unramified degree extension a prime to any tame regular semisimple elliptic langlands parameter trselp for gl f we show that the theory of debacker reeder attaches the character of e to which is attached the representation this will prove that their correspondence agrees with the correspondence of 9 for gl f we then prove the same for reeder s construction if one assumes a certain compatibility condi tion which we describe now reeder s construction in 10 begins by canonically attaching a certain admissible pair l f to a langlands parameter for gl f his construction then inputs this admissible pair into the theory of 1 in order to construct a supercuspidal representation l of gl f the compatibility condition that we will need to assume is that l is the same supercuspidal representation that is attached to l f via the howe construction in 8 we remark that this compatibility condition does not seem to be known to the experts we wish to make an interesting remark regarding the correspondences of moy and debacker reeder and reeder assuming the above compatibility although the correspondence of moy agrees with debacker reeder and reeder assuming the above compatibility there are some important details that are different in particular the passage from a langlands parameter to a character of a torus has a subtle but important difference to illustrate this difference we rewrite both correspondences to include their factorization through characters of elliptic tori as langlands parameters from 6 or 10 for gl f p f a 0 f 2 then the correspondence of moy is given by ind wf we 7 e f 7 whereas the correspondences of debacker reeder and reeder assuming the compatibility are given by ind wf we 7 e f 7 we now briefly present an outline of the paper in section 2 we introduce some notation that we will need throughout in section 3 we briefly recall some of the key components to the construction of debacker reeder from 6 in section 4 we recall the tame local langlands correspondence for gl f as explained in 9 in sections 5 and 6 we work out the theory of 6 for gl f and we show that the correspondence of debacker reeder and moy agree for gl f finally in section 7 we work out the theory of 10 for gl f where is prime and we show that under the compatibility condition the correspondence of reeder and moy agree for gl f 2 notation let f denote a nonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero we let of denote the ring of integers of f pf its maximal ideal f the residue field of f q the order of f and p the characteristic of f let fm denote the degree m extension of f we let denote a uniformizer of f let f u denote the maximal unramified extension of f we have the canonical projection o f o f 1 pf f we denote by wf the weil group of f if the inertia subgroup of wf i f the wild inertia subgroup of wf and w ab f the abelianization of wf we denote by w f the weil deligne group we set wt wf i f and we set it if i f we fix an element gal f f whose inverse induces the map x 7 xq on f f and if e f is the unramified extension of degree we fix an element e gal e e whose inverse induces the map x 7 xq on f f let g be an unramified connected reductive group over f and set g g f u we fix t g an f u split maximal torus which is defined over f and maximally f split and set t t f u we write x x t wo for the finite weyl group ng t t and set n ng t recall that the extended affine weyl group is defined by w x wo and that the affine weyl group is defined by w o wo where is the coroot lattice in x we let a a t be the apartment of t we denote by the automorphism of x w induced by if e f is a finite galois extension then we denote by e f the local class field theory character of f with respect to the extension e f if e satisfies 1 pe 1 then o e factors to a character denoted o of the multiplicative group of the residue field of e given by o x u for any u o e such that u x if e f is the degree unramified extension where is prime we once and for all fix a generator of gal e f we also fix a generator of gal f f which abusing notation we also denote by if is a character of e or f we let denote the character given by x x if l k is a galois quadratic extension we let the map x 7 x denote the nontrivial galois automorphism of l k if a is a group and b is a normal subgroup of a we denote the image of a a in a b by a if c d is a group homomorphism and is trivial on a normal subgroup m c then we will abuse notation and write c m for the factorization of to a map c m d for example the langlands parameters in 6 are trivial on the wild inertia subgroup i f of the inertia group if therefore if is such a langlands parameter and it if i f we will write it to denote the factorization of if to the quotient it 3 3 review of construction of debacker and reeder we first review some of the basic theory from 6 we first fix a pinning t b x for the dual group g the operator dual to extends to an automorphism of t there is a unique extension of to an automorphism of g satisfying x x see 6 section 3 2 following 6 we may form the semidirect product lg g definition 3 1 let w f denote the weil deligne group a langlands parameter w f lg is called a tame regular semisimple elliptic langlands parameter abbreviated trselp if 1 is trivial on i f 2 the centralizer of if in g is a torus 3 c g o z o where z denotes the center of g condition 2 forces to be trivial on sl 2 c let n n g t after conjugating by g we may assume that if t and f where f n let w be the image of f in w o and let w be the element of wo corresponding to w let be a trselp with associated w and set w is an automorphism of x let be the automorphism dual to and let n be the order of we set g ab g g where g denotes the derived group of g let lt t associated to debacker reeder see 6 chapter 4 define a t conjugacy class of langlands parameters t wf lt 1 as follows set t on if and t where t is any element whose class in t 1 t corresponds to the image of f in g ab 1 g ab under the bijection t 1 t g ab 1 g ab 2 in 6 chapter 4 debacker and reeder construct a canonical bijection between t conjugacy classes of admissible homomorphisms wt lt and depth zero characers of t where 1 we briefly summarize this construction let t x f given automorphisms of abelian groups a b respectively let hom a b denote the set of homomorphisms f a b such that f f the twisted norm map n t n t given by n t t t 2 t n 1 t induces isomorphisms hom t c hom id t n c hom id x f n c moreover the map s 7 s gives an isomorphism hom f n t hom id x f n c where s a s a the canonical projection it f m induces an isomorphism as modules it 1 ad m it f m where ad denotes the adjoint action since has order n we have hom f n t homad it t therefore the map s 7 s is a canonical bijection homad it t hom t c 4 moreover we have an isomorphism 0 t x t 7 where 0 t is the group of ofu points of t finally note that t 1 t is the character group of x whereby t 1 t corresponds to hom x c where therefore we have a canonical bijection between t conjugacy classes of admissible homomorphisms wt lt and depth zero characters s irr t 3 where s it and where we have inflated s to 0 t to get the depth zero l packet associated to one implements the component group irr c x 1 w x tor as follows we set xw to be the preimage of x 1 w x tor in x to xw debacker and reeder associate a 1 cocycle u hence a twisted frobenius ad u moreover to they associate a facet j and hence a parahoric subgroup g associated to j let g g g let w be the subgroup of w o generated by reflections in the hyperplanes containing j then to debacker reeder also associate an element w w fix once and for all a lift w of w to n using this lift debacker and reeder also associate a lift w of w to n by lang s theorem there exists p g such that p 1 p w we then define t ad p t and set ad p 1 since is depth zero its restriction to 0 t factors through a character 0 of t where t is the projection of 0 t in g therefore 0 gives rise to an irreducible cuspidal deligne lusztig representation 0 of g inflate 0 to a representation of g and define an extension to z g by 0 where z denotes the center of g this makes sense since z g acts on 0 via the restriction of 0 finally form the representation ind g z g where ind denotes smooth induction then debacker reeder construct a packet of repre sentations on the pure inner forms of g parameterized by irr c using the above construction where c is the component group of 4 existing description of the tame local langlands correspon dence for gl f a prime in this chapter we describe the construction of the tame local langlands correspondence for gl f as explained in 9 where is a prime 5 4 1 depth zero supercuspidal representations of gl f a prime let e f be an admissible pair where has level 0 and e f has degree by definition of admissible pair this implies that e f is unramified and the residue field of e is f since 1 pe 1 o e is the inflation of the character o of f by the theory of finite groups of lie type this character gives rise to an irreducible cuspidal representation of gl f which is the irreducible cuspidal deligne lusztig representation corresponding to the elliptic torus f gl f and the character o of f let be the inflation of to gl of we may extend to a representation of k f f gl of by setting f f and then induce the resulting representation to g f gl f set cind g f k f where cind denotes compact induction let p f 0 be the subset of admissible pairs e f such that has level zero and a 0 f 0 be the subset of depth zero supercuspidal representations of gl f proposition 4 1 suppose that p 6 the map e f 7 induces a bijection p f 0 a 0 f 0 proof see 9 4 2 positive depth supercuspidal representations of gl f a prime in this section we recall the parameterization of the positive depth supercuspidal representions via admissible pairs following 9 let a 0 f denote the set of all positive depth irreducible supercuspidal representations of gl f and let p f denote the set of all admissible pairs e f p f such that has positive level proposition 4 2 suppose that p 6 there is a map e f 7 that induces a bijection p f a 0 f proof see 9 4 3 langlands parameters let g 0 f be the set of equivalence classes of irreducible smooth dimensional representations of wf recall that there is a local artin reciprocity isomorphism given by w ab e e then if e f p f gives rise to a character of w ab e which we can pullback to a character also denoted of we we can then form the induced representation ind wf we of wf theorem 4 3 suppose p 6 if e f p f the representation of wf is irreducible the map e f 7 induces a bijection p f g 0 f 6 proof see 9 for the next theorem we will need to associate to any admissible pair e f p f a specific character of e we will not define in general but only for the cases that we need in this paper for the general definition of associated to any admissible pair e f p f see 9 definition 4 4 if e f is an admissible pair in which e f is quadratic and unramified define to be the unique quadratic unramified character of e if e f is an admissible pair in which e f is degree and unramified where is an odd prime then define to be the trivial character of e theorem 4 5 tame local langlands correspondence suppose p 6 for g 0 f define in the notation of propositions 4 1 and 4 2 for any e f p f such that the map g 0 f a 0 f is the local langlands correspondence for supercuspidal representations of gl f proof see 9 5 the case of gl f a prime for section 5 and section 6 we consider the group g f gl f where is prime we will show that the conjectural correspondence of 6 agrees with the local langlands correspondence for gl f given in section 4 let wf lg be a trselp for g f gl f this is equivalent to an irreducible admissible wf gl c that is trivial on the wild inertia group by section 4 3 have that ind wf we for some admissible pair e f where has level zero and e f is degree and unramified we will need the relative weil group we f wf we we c see 13 chapter 1 where c denotes closure and we we denotes the commutator subgroup ofwe the representation ind wf we factors through we f since we 1 we begin by calculating the character from 3 note that lg gl c t is the diagonal maximal torus in g gl c and after conjugation we may assume if t moreover f for some f n such that w is a cycle of length in the weyl group s the symmetric group on letters the reason for this requirement on the weyl group element is that is trselp and so in particular it is elliptic in particular ellipticity is equivalent to requiring that the image of is not contained in any proper levi subgroup of lg see 6 section 3 4 after conjugating the trselp by a permutation matrix in n g t we may assume without loss of generality that w 1 2 3 s since all cycles of length are conjugate in s note that this choice implies that w 1 2 3 s the arguments in the remainder of the paper are the same for all other allowable choices of w let us first calculate s where s it recall again that i f 1 so if factors to it proposition 5 1 let ind wf we and set s it where e f is an admissible pair as above then the isomorphism homad it t hom f t 7 sends s to s where s x o x 0 0 0 0 o x 0 0 0 0 2 o x 0 0 0 0 1 o x proof since has order s homad it t is trivial on 1 ad it so factors to it 1 ad it we first note that the isomorphisms it lim m f m it 1 ad it f are induced by local artin reciprocity see 10 chapter 5 moreover the map homad it t hom f t comes from the following diagram it s t it 1 ad it f recall that factors through we f therefore we also have the following commutative diagram wf gl c we f it is a fact that we f is an extension of gal e f by e and can be described by generators and relations as follows the generators are z e and an element j where j we f satisfies j and jzj 1 z then the map wf we f sends if to o e and to j let us calculate the map consider the canonical sequence 1 we we we c wf we we c wf we gal e f 1 recall that is trivial on we we c to calculate e it suffices to calculate we since we we we c e by artin reciprocity but we 1 therefore t t 0 0 0 0 t 0 0 0 0 2 t 0 0 0 0 1 t 8 moreover since is irreducible we have that j ngl c t represents w since i f 1 we have that 1 pe 1 so o e factors to a map s f gl c given by s x o x 0 0 0 0 o x 0 0 0 0 2 o x 0 0 0 0 1 o x x f proposition 5 2 let ind wf we and set s it as above then the composite isomorphism homad it t hom f t hom id x f c hom id t c sends s to eo where eo x 1 x 2 x o x 1 o x 2 1 o x and where s it ind wf we proof the composite isomorphism hom f t hom id x f c hom id t c is given by 7 x 7 x where x f and x x t x t t splits over f and note that t f f then it is easy to see that under this composite isomorphism s where s is as in proposition 5 1 maps to the homomorphism x 1 x 2 x 7 o x 1 o x 2 1 o x x 1 x 2 x f by considering the standard basis of cocharacters of x proposition 5 3 the isomorphism hom id t c hom t c is given by hom id t c hom t c 4 7 where a x 1 x 2 x for any x 1 x 2 x f f f such that x 1 x q 1 2 x q 2 3 x q a where a f proof recall that the isomorphism hom id t c hom t c is abstractly given by hom id t c hom t c 7 9 where a x 1 x 2 x for any x 1 x 2 x f f f such that n x 1 x 2 x a we need some preliminaries first note that x 1 x 2 x w 1 x 1 x 2 x w x q 1 x q 2 x q x q x q 1 x q 2 x q 1 if we make the identification of t with tuples x 1 x 2 x f f f then we have that since we made our choice of w 1 2 3 s we get t x 1 x 2 x f f f x q x q 1 x q 2 x q 1 x 1 x 2 x x 1 x q 1 x q 2 1 x q 1 1 x 1 f if x 1 x 2 x f f f t then n x 1 x 2 x x 1 x 2 x x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 2 x x 1 x 2 x x q x q 1 x q 2 x q 1 x q 2 1 x

f we now need to obtain a character of 0 t from a character of t in our case 0 t o e which has a canonical projection map o e 0 t t f then given hom t c we obtain a character of 0 t o e given by z z z o e let us more explicitly calculate such a given some hom t c that comes from hom id t c as in 4 let z o e then z z z 1 1 1 by proposition 5 3 we may now calculate the character s that arises from where s it and ind wf we the above analysis and proposition 5 2 shows that s z eo z 1 1 1 o z z where z o e it remains to compute first note that if we make the identification x z z z then x k k k k z let k k k x denote the character of t corresponding to k k k z z z via this identification proposition 5 4 let 2 the character is given by x c k k 7 k proof note that 1 and g sl 2 c so is any element whose class in t 1 t corresponds to the image of f in gl 2 c sl 2 c under the bijection t 1 t gl 2 c sl 2 c as in 2 we thus need to compute f first recall that j where is as in the proof of proposition 5 1 recall that since is irreducible then j 0 a b 0 for some a b c after conjugation by g we may assume that b 1 but since j 2 we have 0 0 j 2 j 2 a 0 0 a 10 therefore a and so j 0 1 0 and we may take f 0 1 0 we now note that the bijection t 1 t g ab 1 g ab is induced by the inclusion t g see 6 section 4 3 now we have that 0 0 1 0 1 0 gl 2 c sl 2 c since 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 sl 2 c therefore since 0 0 1 t we may set 0 0 1 then x c is given by k k k k k k 0 0 1 k proposition 5 5 let be an odd prime the character is given by x c k k k 7 k proof note that 1 and g sl c so is any element whose class in t 1 t corresponds to the image of f in gl c sl c under the bijection t 1 t gl c sl c as in 2 we thus need to compute f first recall that factors through we f and we have the commutative diagram wf gl c we f from proposition 5 1 we have j to compute j recall that because of our choice of w we have j 0 0 0 a 1 a 2 0 0 0 0 a 3 0 0 0 0 a 0 for some ai c after conjugation the langlands parameter by an element in g of the form 11 0 x 2 0 0 0 0 0 x 3 0 0 0 0 0 x 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 x x 1 0 0 0 0 we may assume that a 2 a 3 a 1 therefore 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 j j a 1 0 0 0 0 a

recall that we have computed on o e it remains to compute because of the isomorphism 0 t x t 7 we need to compute 1 1 1 1 proposition 5 6 let 2 then where ind wf we proof we have that 1 1 1 s 1 1 1 therefore recall that we have shown that o e o e since 2 is the unique quadratic unramified character of e therefore we have that 1 and o e 1 so proposition 5 7 let be an odd prime proof we have that 1 1 1 1 s 1 1 1 1 therefore recall that we have shown that o e o e therefore but recall that is trivial since is an odd prime so we have 6 from a character of a torus to a representation for gl f in this section we determine the representation that debacker reeder assign to a trselp for gl f using the results from section 5 note that x 1 w x tor 0 so we may let 0 recall that xw the proof of 6 lemma 2 7 2 implies that we may take u 1 and therefore it is also easy to see that we may take w w see 6 section 2 7 and w w where w is a fixed choice of lift of w since the theory of 6 is independent of any choices we are free to choose a specific lift w which we do now let f x be a monic irreducible polynomial of degree over f let f x be a monic lift of f x to f x we may write e f where is a root of f x first set w 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 13 recall that we need to find p g such that p 1 p w by choosing the basis 1 2 1 for e over f we may embed e into gl f in the standard way denote this embedding e gl f lemma 6 1 there exists an a g such that a t 0 0 0 0 0 t 0 0 0 0 0 2 t 0 0 0 0 0 3 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 t a 1 t for all t a 0 a 1 a 2 2 a 1 1 e ai f proof suppose r x is a polynomial of degree in f x that splits over e then we get an isomorphism e x r x i 1 e p x 7 p a 1 p a 2 p a where ai are the roots of r x setting r x to now be the minimal polynomial of and considering the basis 1 x x 2 x 1 of e x r x over e we get an isomorphism e x r x g e e e 1 7 1 1 1 1 x 7 2 1 x 2 7 2 2 2 2 1 2 x 1 7 1 1 2 1 1 1 this transformation yields the matrix v 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 2 1 1 3 3 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 we then set a v 1 note that what we have really done here is the following we first have taken the standard e basis e 1 e 2 e of e e e and pulled it back by g to get a basis e 1 e 2 e of e x r x we have then shown that the standard embedding of an element w e in gl f by considering its action on the basis 1 2 1 can be diagonalized over e with respect to the basis e 1 e 2 e 14 note that v is a vandermonde matrix therefore its determinant is 0 i j 1 j i which has valuation zero since we also have that the entries of v are contained in o e we conclude that v and hence a is contained in g set s w 1 a 1 a we now fix our choice of lift w of w by setting w s 1 w s s which we shall show is a legitimate lift we claim first that we may set p as and that s g t note that since we will show that s g t this shows that p g which is required to prove all of this consider the adjoint action of a 1 a on t first for s t w we have a 1 a s a 1 a s a 1 a a 1 asa 1 a a 1 asa 1 a s since lemma 6 1 implies that asa 1 is fixed by we therefore have that a 1 a s w s s t w since t w is dense in t in the zariski topology we have that a 1 a s w s s t this implies that w 1 a 1 a s s s t since w is clearly a lift of w which means that w 1 a 1 a s w 1 a 1 a 1 s s t this means that w 1 a 1 a cg t t so in particular w 1 a 1 a s t but a w g implies that w 1 a 1 a g which implies that s g t this shows that p g which is required moreover p 1 p as 1 as s 1 a 1 a s s 1 w s s w finally w is a lift of w since w is and since s t proving the claim thus we have a p such that p 1 p w and w is indeed a lift of w then if we define t ad p t we get that t is the image of e under this is crucial since the depth zero supercuspidals of gl f are constructed in section 4 1 by first fixing an the embedding of e into gl f the overall construction does not depend on the choice of embedding we have fixed the embedding debacker reeder are attaching a depth zero supercuspidal representation of gl f to a langlands parameter and we need to show that their depth zero supercuspidal matches the depth zero supercuspidal attached in theorem 4 5 the latter of which again uses the construction in section 4 1 which assumes a fixed embedding which we are assuming without loss of generality is note that we have a simple description for the map ad p 1 t ad p 1 t w t 7 diag t t 2 t 1 t where diag d 1 d 2 d denotes the diagonal by matrix with d 1 d 2 d on the diagonal and where t a 0 a 1 a 2 2 a 1 1 note that t w diag a 0 a 0 2 a 0 1 a 0 a 0 e finally because of propositions 5 6 and 5 7 and the definition of we have the following propo sition proposition 6 2 is given by t t t for all t a 0 a 1 a 2 2 a 1 1 e 15 let us sum up the data that we have obtained so far given a trselp for gl f we have obtained a torus t w given 0 xw we have constructed t and p we have t e from we have constructed a character of t w via ad p we transported to a character of t we have shown that note that the restriction of to 0 t factors through a character 0 of t then the packet of representations that debacker reeder construct in 6 from the data that we have obtained thus far is the single representation ind gl f f gl of 0 recall that in section 4 3 the local langlands correspondence for gl f where is prime was given as ind wf we 7 we have therefore shown that the correspondence of debacker reeder coincides with the local langlands correspondence 7 the positive depth correspondence of reeder for gl f an arbitrary prime in this section we prove that the correspondence of 10 agrees with the local langlands corre spondence of 9 for gl f where is an arbitrary prime if one assumes a certain compatibility condition which we describe now reeder s construction in 10 begins by canonically attaching a certain admissible pair l f to a langlands parameter for gl f his construction then inputs this admissible pair into the theory of 1 in order to construct a supercuspidal representation l of gl f the compatibility condition that we will need to assume is that l is the same supercuspidal representation that is attached to l f via the howe construction in 8 most of the arguments and setup are the same as in the depth zero case so there is not much to prove here we first very briefly review the construction of 10 and refer to 10 for various definitions and notions that are not explained here 7 1 review of construction of reeder let g be an f quasisplit and f u split connected reductive group let b g be a borel subgroup defined over f and t a maximal torus of b the langlands parameters considered in 10 are the maps wf lg g such that 1 is trivial on i r 1 and nontrivial on i r for some integer r 0 here i k k 0 is a filtration on if defined in 10 section 5 2 2 the centralizer of i r in g is a maximal torus of g this condition is the regularity condition 3 g and the centralizer of wf in g is finite modulo z this is the ellipticity condition we may conjugate by an element of g so that if t and f where f n let w be the image of f in w o and let w be the element of wo dual to w we say that the element w is associated to 16 set w and suppose its action on x has order n from an above such langlands parameter reeder defines a t conjugacy class of langlands parameters t wf lt in the exact same way as in the depth zero case in particular the element is defined in the same way as in the depth zero case a bijection is later given between t conjugacy classes of continuous homomorphisms wf i r 1 lt for which t and characters of t that are trivial on t r 1 where tk k 0 is the canonical filtration on t see 10 section 5 3 this is done as follows we have a composite isomorphism see 10 section 5 3 homad if i r 1 t homad if i r 1 n t hom o n 1 p r 1 n t hom id x o n 1 p r 1 n c hom id 0 t n t n r 1 c hom 0 t t r 1 c 5 under this composite isomorphism s if maps to a character s hom 0 t t r 1 c then if we get that gives rise to a character of x given by for x just as in the depth zero case recalling that t 0 t x we define a character of t by s which is our desired character of t constructed from the langlands parameter as in the depth zero case we have the set xw to xw reeder associates a 1 cocycle u hence a twisted frobenius ad u moreover to is associated an affine weyl group element w a parahoric subgroup gx and an element p gx such that p 1 p is a lift of w we then define t ad p t and set ad p 1 to the torus t and the character we apply the construction of 1 to obtain a supercuspidal representation then reeder constructs a packet of representations on the pure inner forms of g parameterized by irr c using the above construction 7 2 the case of gl f where is prime in this section we consider the group g f gl f where prime let wf lg be one of the langlands parameters for g f gl f that is considered in section 7 1 lemma 7 1 ind wf we for some admissible pair e f where has positive level and e f is degree unramified proof the proof is similar as in the gl 2 f case but we include it for completeness purposes as in the depth zero case in section 5 we may conjugate by an element of g so that the weyl group element w that is associated to is the weyl group element 1 2 3 in the symmetric group on letters we know that is an irreducible admissible wf gl c that is trivial on i r 1 and nontrivial on i r for some integer r 0 let e be the degree unramified extension of f again any representation ind wf we where e f is an admissible pair is equivalent to the representation wf gl c satisfying 1 we is given by e by the local langlands correspondence for tori 17 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 we want to show that satisfies the two conditions above for some admissible pair e f let s restrict to we by the composite isomorphism 5 ie gives rise to a character of o e then by following the composite isomorphism 5 backwards one sees that x r x 0 0 0 0 r x 0 0 0 0 2 r x 0 0 0 0 1 r x as in the depth zero case now as in propositions 5 4 and 5 5 we know that 0 0 0 a 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 for some a c because of the ellipticity condition on therefore we have that e a 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 a then extends to a character denoted of e by setting a and o e o e one can now see that ind wf we by the regularity condition on we get that 6 and thus e f is an admissible pair finally has positive level since r 0 proposition 7 2 let 2 then proof the analogous arguments as in the depth zero case show that o e o e in particular let z o e let x if be any element such that r 2 x z where r 2 is as in 10 section 5 1 and let be the cocharacter t 7 t 0 0 1 then n r 2 x z 0 0 z 18 moreover by the same arguments as in proposition 5 1 we get x r 2 x 0 0 r 2 x so that x z where here we are viewing as a character of t finally as we may take to be the same element as in the depth zero case we have that so that proposition 7 3 let be an odd prime then proof the analogous proof as in proposition 7 2 and the depth zero case works here note that x 1 w x tor 0 so we may let 0 recall that xw it is easy to see that we may again take u 1 and therefore it is also easy to see that we may take w w see 10 section 6 4 and we may also take the same p as in the depth zero case in section 6 so we have the same t as in section 6 and the analogous we have therefore shown that if we assume the compatibility condition in the beginning of section 7 then by proposition 7 3 the reeder construction attaches the representation to the langlands parameter ind wf we this shows that as long as we assume this compatibility condition the correspondences of 10 and 9 agree for gl f where is an odd prime acknowledgements this paper has benefited from conversations with jeffrey adams jeffrey adler gordan savin and jiu kang
