2018 abstract a locally compact group g has property pl if every isometric g action either has bounded orbits or is metrically proper for p 1 say that g has property bplp if the same alternative holds for the smaller class of affine isometric actions on lp spaces we explore properties pl and bplp and prove that they are equivalent for some interesting classes of groups abelian groups amenable almost connected lie groups amenable linear algebraic groups over a local field of characteristic 0 the appendix provides new examples of groups with property pl in cluding non linear ones 1 introduction let the locally compact group g act by isometries on a metric space x d the action is locally bounded if kx is bounded for every x x and every compact set k g the action is bounded if every orbit is bounded on the other hand the action is metrically proper if limg d gx x for every x x a length function on g is a non negative function l on g which is bounded on compact subsets is symmetric l g l g 1 for every g g and is sub additive l gh l g l h for every g h g clearly if g admits a locally bounded action by isometries on x d then for every x x the function l g r g 7 d gx x is a length function on g it is known that g admits a proper length function if and only if g is compact see section 2 in co 2 in the next definition the equivalence of the two statements is proposition 1 2 in co 2 definition 1 1 see co 2 a locally compact group g has property pl if every locally bounded action of g by isometries is either bounded or proper equiva lently every length function on g is either bounded or proper 1 http arxiv org abs 1705 00854 v 1 for p 1 a length function l on g is a lp type length function if it comes from a continuous affine isometric action of g on some lp space lp x i e l g g x x for some x lp x in the terminology of definition 6 5 in cdh the invariant kernel g h 7 l g 1 h p has type p on g definition 1 2 for p 1 a locally compact group g has property bplp if every affine isometric action of g on a lp space is either bounded or proper equivalently every lp type length function on g is either bounded or proper recall from bfgm that g has property flp if every continuous affine iso metric action of g on a lp space has a fixed point 1 obviously property bplp is implied both by property pl and by property flp a surprising fact discovered by y shalom sh 1 theorem 3 4 is that sim ple lie groups with finite center have property bpl 2 since those have property fh except when locally isomorphic to so n 1 or su n 1 this is really a state ment about the latter two classes of groups a stronger result was proved by y cornulier co 2 theorem 1 4 property pl holds for all simple algebraic groups over a local field 2 in the same paper it is also proved that certain semi direct products have property pl e g rd k where k is a closed subgroup of the orthogonal group o d acting transitively on the unit sphere see proposition 1 8 in co 2 or f a where f is a non archimedean local field and a is the invertible group of its ring of integers proposition 1 9 in co 2 the aim of the present paper is to investigate the relation between properties pl and bplp it was a surprise for us that for some interesting classes of groups they turn out to be equivalent for example for abelian groups both are equivalent to compactness theorem 1 3 let a be a locally compact abelian lca group the following are equivalent a a has property pl b for some resp every p 1 the group a has property bplp c a is compact for amenable locally compact groups we have 1 property fl 2 is more commonly denoted by fh and for compact locally compact groups property fh is equivalent to kazhdan s property t see bhv for all this 2 for isometric actions which are continuous not just locally bounded an even stronger result holds for simple algebraic groups over local field a continuous isometric action either is proper or has a globally fixed point see theorem 6 1 in bg 2 theorem 1 4 let g be a locally compact group admitting a closed co compact normal subgroup v such that v f d with f a local field of characteristic 0 and d 0 so that the compact group g v acts on v the following are equivalent a g has property pl b for some resp every p 1 the group g has property bplp c g v is infinite and it acts irreducibly on v notation we denote by gla the union of the class of almost connected lie groups and the class of groups of the form g f the group of f rational points of a linear algebraic group g defined over a non archimedean local field f with characteristic 0 theorem 1 5 let g be an amenable non compact group in gla the following are equivalent a g has property pl b for some resp every p 1 the group g has property bplp c there exists a compact normal subgroup w of g such that h g w has a closed co compact subgroup v isomorphic to f d for some d 1 with h v infinite and acting irreducibly on v for a group g we denote by ad g the image of g in its group of inner automorphisms for non amenable groups we have theorem 1 6 let g be a non amenable locally compact group which is either an almost connected lie group or a linear algebraic group over a local field of any characteristic the following are equivalent a g has property pl b every closed normal subgroup of g is either compact or co compact c there exists a compact normal subgroup w of g such that g w admits a closed co compact normal subgroup n which is isomorphic to a direct product s 1 sn of simple groups and the simple factors s 1 sn are permuted transitively under ad g the previous result actually holds under weaker assumptions on g see the orem 5 1 for the precise statement the linear algebraic groups with property fh have been characterized by s p wang wan so to classify linear algebraic groups with property bpl 2 we may assume that they do not have property fh 3 theorem 1 7 let g be a group in gla assume that g does not have property fh and is non amenable the following are equivalent a the group g has property bpl 2 b g admits a finite normal subgroup w such that g w admits a closed co compact normal subgroup n which is isomorphic to a direct product s 1 sn of simple groups and the simple factors s 1 sn are per muted transitively under ad g moreover if g g f with f is non archimedean each simple factor of n is a simple algebraic group of rank 1 over f if g is lie almost connected each simple factor of n is locally isomorphic to so n 1 or su m 1 finally we prove a general result about centers of bplp groups theorem 1 8 fix p 1 let g be a compactly generated locally compact group satisfying property bplp but not property fl p then the center of g is compact in a previous paper ctv property bp 0 was introduced for a locally compact group g it means that g satisfies the bounded proper alternative for affine isometric actions on hilbert spaces such that the linear part is a c 0 or mixing representation the class of groups with bp 0 is significantly larger than the class of groups with bpl 2 for example it was proved in ctv that every group with non compact center in particular every abelian group has bp 0 the paper is structured as follows section 2 contains generalities on property bplp in particular we prove that for 1 p 2 and g locally compact separa ble property bplp is equivalent to every action of g on a space with measured walls being bounded or proper proposition 2 8 section 3 contains generalities on property pl theorems 1 3 1 4 1 5 and 1 8 are proved in section 4 which is the core of the paper theorem 1 6 is proved in section 5 section 6 deals specifically with property bpl 2 we prove theorem 1 7 and make in proposition 6 2 the connection with the howe moore property by proving that it implies property bpl 2 this provides a new proof of the already mentioned theorem 3 4 in sh 1 stating that so n 1 and su n 1 have property bpl 2 the original proof used the mautner phenomenon since property bpl 2 is implied both by property pl and the howe moore property it is natural to ask for any relation ship between pl and howe moore and this is an interesting open question in the appendix corina ciobotaru shows that a closed non compact subgroup of the automorphism group of the d regular tree d 3 that acts 2 transitively on the boundary satisfies property pl as a consequence of her result all known examples of groups with the howe moore property see cio have property pl 4 this paper is a natural continuation of ctv ccltv but can be read independently acknowledgements special thanks are due to yves cornulier for numerous exchanges and conversations following the joint papers ctv and ccltv in particular he provided example 4 10 and suggested the use of the map x in the proof of theorem 1 4 we also thank bachir bekka for suggesting proposition 6 2 yves benoist for sharing his expertise on algebraic groups and pierre emmanuel caprace for suggesting theorem 5 1 as an improvement of theorem 1 6 2 generalities on property bplp the two next results follow immediately from definitions proposition 2 1 let g be a locally compact group and n a closed normal subgroup 1 if g has property bplp then so does g n 2 if g has property bplp and n is not compact then g n has property flp 3 if g n has property bplp and n is compact then g has property bplp proposition 2 2 let h be a closed co compact subgroup in g if h has property bplp then so does g example 2 3 let n sl 2 r sl 2 r and let z 2 z act on n by exchanging factors form the semi direct product g n z 2 z clearly n does not have property bpl 2 but g has property bpl 2 by theorem 1 7 this example shows that property bpl 2 is not inherited by finite index subgroups example 2 4 let g be the universal covering group of su n 1 n 1 for every p 1 the group g does not have have property bplp by proposition 2 1 since the quotient g z g of g by the non compact normal subgroup z g does not have property flp this shows that property bplp is not inherited by non trivial central extensions remark 2 5 there are plenty of discrete groups with property bpl 2 provided by discrete groups with property fh but we do not know any example of a discrete group with property bpl 2 but without property fh it is a result by 5 peterson thom theorem 2 6 in pt that if g is a countable group with non zero first l 2 betti number containing some infinite amenable subgroup e g z then there exists a 1 cocycle with respect to the regular representation which is neither bounded or proper so such a group does not have property bpl 2 nor the weaker property bp 0 since a locally compact group admitting a proper isometric action on some metric space must be compact we have in particular proposition 2 6 a group with property bplp but without property fl p is compact recall that a locally compact groupg is locally elliptic if every compact subset is contained in a compact subgroup observe that an locally elliptic group is amenable as a direct limit of compact groups for an arbitrary locally compact group the locally elliptic radical rell g is the unique maximal locally elliptic closed normal subgroup of g see example 4 d 7 7 in ch proposition 2 7 let g be a compact group with property bplp if g is not compactly generated then g is locally elliptic and not almost connected proof let k be a compact set in g and let u be the closed subgroup generated by k upon replacing k by its union with a compact neighborhood of the identity we may assume that u is an open subgroup let kn n 0 be an increasing sequence of compact subsets ofg withk k 0 andg n 0 kn and let un be the subgroup generated by kn by assumption un 6 g as explained e g in the proof of proposition 2 4 1 of bhv the set t n 0 g un carries a natural g invariant tree structure such that for the g representation on p of the set of oriented edges there is an unbounded 1 cocycle b z 1 g actually b g p d gx 0 x 0 where d is the distance in t and x 0 is the trivial coset in g u see proposition 2 3 3 in bhv by property bplp this unbounded cocycle b must be proper in particular vertex stabilizers in t must be compact so u g g gx 0 x 0 is compact i e g is locally elliptic it then follows from proposition 4 d 3 in ch that the connected component of identity in g is compact recall from cmv that a space with measured walls is a 4 tuple x w b where w is a set of walls on x i e partitions of x into 2 classes b is a algebra of subsets of w and is a measure on b such that for any x y x the set w x y of walls separating x from y is in b and has finite measure the kernel x y 7 w x y is then a pseudo metric on x called the wall distance 6 proposition 2 8 for a locally compact group g and p 1 consider the follow ing statements 1 g has property bplp 2 every action of g on a space with measured walls x is either bounded or proper when x is endowed with the wall distance then 1 2 the converse holds if 1 p 2 and g is separable proof 1 2 follows essentially from the proof of proposition 3 1 in ctv and the remark following it we recall the main features if g acts on a space with measured walls x and x 0 is some base point in x there is an affine isometric action x of g on l p of the space of half spaces in x such that x g 0 p p w gx 0 x 0 the measure of the set of walls separating gx 0 from x 0 so the g action on x is proper resp bounded if and only if x is proper resp bounded 2 1 this is a combination of results from cdh assume 1 p 2 and g separable and let be an affine isometric action of g on lp fix v lp and set g g v v pp in the terminology of definition 6 5 in cdh the invariant kernel g h 7 g 1 h has type p by corollary 6 11 1 in cdh the function is conditionally negative definite on g because 1 p 2 by theorem 6 25 2 in cdh since g is separable there exists a median space x d a point x 0 x and a continuous isometric g action on x such that g d gx 0 x 0 for every g g finally by theorem 5 1 in cdh because x is median it carries a structure of space with measured walls x w b such that d x y w x y for every x y x and every isometry of x is an automorphism of x w b so is bounded resp proper if and only if the g action on x w b is bounded resp proper 3 generalities on property pl let g be a locally compact compact group observe that if g has property pl then every closed normal subgroup is either compact or co compact if g is amenable with property bplp for some p 1 and n is a closed non compact normal subgroup then g n is both amenable and property flp so g n is compact so also in this case every closed normal subgroup of g is either compact or co compact in theorem e of cm caprace and monod obtained structural results for compactly generated locally compact groups g with the property that every 7 non trivial closed normal subgroup is co compact if g is not compact then g falls into one of the following three cases 1 g is isomorphic to a semi direct product rd k where k is a compact subgroup of gld r acting irreducibly on r d 2 g is a compact extension of a quasi product of finitely many non compact pairwise isomorphic topologically simple groups permuted transitively by ad g 3 g is discrete and residually finite lemma 3 1 let g be a non compact locally compact group assume either that g has property pl or that g is amenable with property bplp for some p 1 a if g is not compactly generated then g is locally elliptic b if g is compactly generated then rell g is compact and every non trivial closed normal subgroup of g rell g is co compact proof if g is not compactly generated the result follows from proposition 2 7 as pl implies bplp if g is compactly generated then every closed normal subgroup of g is either compact or co compact this is obvious if g has prop erty pl if g is amenable with property bplp this follows from the fact that any non compact compactly generated amenable group admits a proper action on lp in particular rell g is compact and g rell g is a non compact group with out non trivial compact normal subgroup and every non trivial closed normal subgroup co compact for almost connected lie groups lemma 3 1 cleans things up as those are compactly generated an immediate consequence of lemma 3 1 and the caprace monod theorem is proposition 3 2 let g be a non compact almost connected real lie group as sume that g either has property pl or that g is amenable with property bplp for some p 1 there is a compact normal subgroup w of g such that a if g is amenable then g w is isomorphic to a semi direct product rd k where k is a compact subgroup of gld r acting irreducibly on r d b if g is non amenable then g w is a compact extension of a product of finitely many non compact pairwise isomorphic simple lie groups per muted transitively by ad g 8 4 amenable groups 4 1 semi direct products for a a lca group we denote by a its pontryagin dual and by 1 a a the trivial character set a a 1 a proposition 4 1 fix p 1 let a be a lca group and let k be a compact group of automorphisms let be an infinite k invariant radon measure on a assume that for every compact subset c a we have sup a c a a 1 p d 1 for a k a k set l a k a a 1 p d 1 p then l is an unbounded lp type length function on a k proof let f be the space of measurable functions on a modulo equality almost everywhere we define a linear representation of a k on f by a k f a f k 1 a k a k f f a observe that has no non zero fixed vector view the space lp a as a subspace of f it is invariant under that induces an isometric representation of a k on lp a let t be the translation by the constant function 1 on f so that t f f 1 for f f define an affine action of a k on f by t 1 t more precisely for a k a k f f a a k f a k f a 1 observe that the constant function 1 is the only fixed point of in f by assumption 7 a 1 is in lp a for every a a so lp a is invariant and defines a continuous affine isometric action of a k on lp a then l a k a k 0 is indeed a l p type length function on a k since 1 lp a the action has no fixed point in l p a so that l is unbounded indeed this follows from the fact that an isometric action on lp with bounded orbits fixes a point this is a consequence of the center lemma for p 1 and of bgm for p 1 9 remark 4 2 suppose that a rd every continuous character on rd is of the form x 7 exp 2 i x y for some y rd where denotes the usual scalar product so for x k rd k we have l x k p rd exp 2 i x y 1 p d y 2 p 2 rd 1 cos 2 x y p 2 d y 2 p rd sinp x y d y using sin t t and the cauchy schwarz inequality we see that to ensure the finiteness condition 1 it is sufficient that has a p th moment i e rd y p d y we will apply proposition 4 1 to semi direct products a f with f finite in the case a z and f trivial the next result is due to edelstein theorem 2 1 in ede for a r and f trivial see corollary 5 3 in ctv theorem 4 3 let a be a non compact compact lca group and let f be a finite group of automorphisms of a for every p 1 the semi direct product a f does not have property bplp proof we will use proposition 4 1 to construct a specific unbounded lp type length function on a f which will turn out to be not proper let kn n 0 be a strictly increasing sequence of compact subsets of a with a n 0 kn clearly we may assume that each kn is f invariant for a a let a be the unique integer n 0 such that a kn kn 1 so that kn a a a n claim there exists sequences an n 0 in a and n n 0 in a such that an an 1 for f f k n we have f k an 1 2 n max a an 1 n a 1 2 n for every n 0 taking the claim for granted we define the measure on a as a sum of dirac masses f f k 0 f k then is an infinite f invariant radon measure on a moreover for a kn we have a uniform bound a a 1 p d f f n k 1 f k a 1 p f f k n f k a 1 p 10 2 pn f f k n 2 pk where the inequality follows from the claim and kn k an k ak 1 for k n then by proposition 4 1 l a g f f k 0 f k a 1 p 1 p a g a f defines an unbounded lp type length function on a f to show that it is not proper we show that l remains bounded along the unbounded sequence an ida n 0 in a f but by the claim l an ida p f f n k 1 f k an 1 p f f k n f k an 1 p f n 2 pn f k n 2 pk as an ak 1 for k n so limn l an ida 0 so the sequence l an ida n 0 is bounded it remains to prove the claim assume that a 1 an 1 a and 1 n 1 a have been constructed as a is not compact so that a is not discrete we find n a such that max a an 1 n a 1 2 n let h be the subgroup of a generated by the f k s with f f k n let denote the inclusion of h into a we then have the dual homomorphism a a h with h compact since has dense image see corollaire 6 in chap ii 1 7 of bou and a is not compact in any complement of a compact set in a we can find a with a arbitrarily close to the trivial element in h in particular we can find an with an an 1 with an f k 1 2 n i e f k an 1 2 n for f f k n remark 4 4 say that a rd in theorem 4 3 and assume that the finite group f stabilizes some proper closed unbounded subgroup b of rd think of b as either a proper linear subspace or a lattice then the proof of theorem 4 3 becomes much simpler indeed let y 0 r d be a non zero vector such that the character x 7 exp 2 i x y 0 is in the annihilator b a b 1 set then k x exp 2 i k x y 0 then the measure f f k 0 f k on rd has finite p th moment so by remark 4 2 and proposition 4 1 the function l a g f f k 0 f k a 1 p 1 p defines an unbounded lp type length function on a f on the other hand pick any non zero vector a 0 b and 11 set an n a 0 we claim that limn l an ida 0 indeed observe that f k an 1 for f f k n so that as in remark 4 2 l an ida p f f k n f k an 1 p 2 p f f k n sinp n k a 0 y 0 2 p a 0 p y 0 p f k n n k p 2 p a 0 p y 0 p f k n 1 n p n k using the bound n k 1 nn k for k n so we have l an ida p 2 p a 0 p y 0 p f 1 np 1 establishing the claim the choice of the weights in defining and the sequence an n 0 is inspired by the proof of theorem 2 1 in ede we will come back to finite groups stabilizing a lattice in rd in corollary 6 3 below here is a noteworthy consequence of theorem 4 3 corollary 4 5 let be an infinite finitely generated virtually abelian group then does not have property bplp for every p 1 proof write as the central term of a short exact sequence 0 zn p f 1 2 with f finite we claim that embeds as a co compact lattice in a semi direct product g rn f since g does not have property bplp by theorem 4 3 the corollary follows from proposition 2 2 to prove the claim let c z 2 f zn be the 2 cocycle on f describing the extension 2 the group zn becomes an f module through the conjugation action of f and c g g s g s g s gg 1 for some section s f of the map p now the f action on zn canonically extends to rn and the law v g v g v g v c g g gg v rn g f defines on g rn f the structure of an almost connected lie group in which embeds as a co compact lattice since h 2 f rn 0 the extension 0 rn g f 1 splits so that g rn f this proof was inspired by the proof of theorem 1 in ak 12 4 2 abelian groups the following lemma can be deduced from the proof of proposition 2 5 9 in bhv where it is proved for solvable groups and p 2 we include the simple proof for locally compact abelian lca groups lemma 4 6 fix p 1 a lca group a has property flp if and only if a is compact proof one implication is trivial for the non trivial one let a be a lca group with property flp we consider two cases a is discrete assume by contradiction that a is infinite since every infinite abelian group has a countably infinite quotient see theorem 2 5 2 in rud we may assume that a is countably infinite with property flp but a countable group with property flp is finitely generated by corollary 2 4 2 in bhv hence a is isomorphic to zn f with n 0 and f finite abelian but such a group does not have property flp so a contradiction is reached a is arbitrary by structure theory for lca groups see theorem 2 4 1 in rud a admits an open subgroup u of the form u k rm for some m 0 and some compact group k the group a u is discrete with property flp so it is finite by the first case of the proof i e u has finite index in a so u has property flp too by proposition 2 5 7 in bhv this clearly forces m 0 so a is compact proof of theorem 1 3 implications c a b are clear we prove b c by contradiction so suppose there is a non compact lca group a with property bplp for some p 1 as a is not compact a does not have property flp by lemma 4 6 since a has property bplp the group a must be compact by proposition 2 6 but this contradicts theorem 4 3 from theorem 1 3 we deduce immediately corollary 4 7 let g be a locally compact group with property bplp for some p 1 then g g g is compact 4 3 centers proof of theorem 1 8 let s be a compact generating subset of g since g does not have property flp it admits an affine isometric action on some lp space e with non zero 13 displacement inf x e sup s s s x x 0 indeed this follows from gro 3 8 d taking the energy e x to be sups s s x x in other words letting and b be respectively the linear part and cocycle part of we have that b is non trivial in reduced first cohomology let z g denote as usual the center of g by bfgm proposition 2 6 we have a g invariant continuous decomposition e e 1 e 2 e 3 where e 1 is the space of g invariant vectors and e 1 e 2 the space of z g invariant vectors the projection b 1 of b on e 1 is a group homomorphism g e 1 which by corollary 4 7 is zero observe then that the projection b 2 of b on e 2 vanishes on z g indeed the cocycle relation shows that b 2 z is a g invariant vector for all z z g so assuming by contradiction that z g is not compact by property bplp the affine action corresponding to b 2 is bounded so it has a fixed point and b 2 is a coboundary finally as the center z g is non compact the projection b 3 is trivial in h 1 e by brs corollary 5 finally implying that b itself is an almost coboundary this is a contradiction note that the above proof really needs p 1 to appeal to proposition 2 6 of bfgm and to corollary 5 of brs 4 4 proof of theorem 1 4 lemma 4 8 let f be a local field of characteristic 0 v f d and k an infinite compact subgroup of gl v acting irreducibly on v denote by k the lie algebra of k for every non zero x v there exists x k such that xx 6 0 proof contraposing we assume that there is a non zero vector x v such that xx 0 for every x k and will show that k is finite let w be the space of vectors v v such that xv 0 for every x k this is clearly a k invariant subspace so by irreducibility we have w v this implies k 0 and hence k is finite the next lemma says that if g is as in theorem 1 4 it is close to being a semi direct product lemma 4 9 let g be as in theorem 1 4 there exists a compact subgroup c of g such that g v c proof if f r it is a classical fact see theorem 2 3 in chapter iii of hoc that any extension of a finite dimensional real vector space by a compact group is split for f non archimedean we observe that v is locally elliptic and 14 appeal to the fact that local ellipticity is preserved by extensions see proposition 4 d 4 2 in ch hence g is locally elliptic so ifk is a compact set that surjects onto g v by the quotient map g g v the set k is contained in a compact subgroup c of g and clearly g v c example 4 10 let g be the following closed subgroup of the heisenberg group over qp g 1 x z 0 1 y 0 0 1 x y zp z qp then g is a central extension of v qp by z 2 p the extension is not split as g is not abelian however we have g v c where c is the heisenberg group over zp proof of theorem 1 4 the implication a b is obvious b c assume that g has property bplp by proposition 2 8 we may assume p 1 by lemma 4 9 we can write g v c for some compact subgroup c of g observe that v c is normal in g denote by v v v c and c c v c the quotient maps then the map g v v c c v c g vc 7 v c is well defined and is a continuous surjective homomorphism so the semi direct product v v c c v c has property bplp and theorem 4 3 implies that g v c v c is infinite if w is a non zero g v invariant linear subspace in v then w is a normal subgroup in g by proposition 2 1 the quotient g w has property flp so it is compact as g w is also amenable hence w v i e g v acts irreducibly on v c a set k g v assume that k acts irreducibly on v and is infinite so that its lie algebra k is non zero we proceed in several steps for x v 0 set x kd v g 1 gd 7 g 1 x gdx we claim that the image of x contains some open set in v for this it is enough to show that the differential d x g 1 gd has rank d for some g 1 gd k d but for x 1 xd k d we have d x g 1 gd x 1 xd g 1 x 1 x gdxdx by lemma 4 8 we find x k such that xx 6 0 as xx is a cyclic vector for k because k acts irreducibly we find g 1 gd k such that g 1 xx gdxx is a basis of v this means that d x g 1 gd has rank d 15 endow v f d with the norm x max 1 i d xi for x v 0 set x k 2 d v g 1 gd h 1 hd 7 x g 1 gd x h 1 hd by the previous point the image of x contains some open set around 0 let x denote the radius of the largest open ball centered at 0 and contained in the image of x since x depends smoothly on x the function x 7 x on the unit sphere of v is bounded below by some positive 0 as in lemma 4 9 write g v c let l be a length function on g let n 0 be such that l c n for x v g c the relation gxg 1 g x in g implies l g x l x 2 n assume that l is not proper so that there is a sequence xn n 0 in v with xn and a constant m 0 such that l xn m for every n 0 fix y v and choose n large enough so that y xn this implies that y is in the image of xn say y d i 1 gi xn d i 1 hi xn for suitable g 1 gd h 1 hd k then l y d i 1 l gi xn d i 1 l hi xn 2 d l xn 2 n 2 d m 2 n finally for y v c c we have l yc l y l c 2 d m 2 n n meaning that l is bounded 4 5 proof of theorem 1 5 the implication a b is trivial while c a follows from theorem 1 4 together with the fact that property pl is stable under extensions with compact kernels see lemma 3 1 in co 2 to prove b c let g be non compact amenable in gla with property bplp we will repeatedly appeal to what proposition 2 1 says for amenable groups if a locally compact amenable group has property bplp then every closed normal subgroup is either compact or co compact the case of almost connected lie groups follows from proposition 3 2 a and theorem 4 3 so we may focus on the algebraic case i e g g f with f a non archimedean local field f of characteristic 0 let o be the valuation ring of f and be a uniformizer so that f o z 16 let g 0 be the zariski connected component of identity and ru g 0 its unipo tent radical we proceed in two steps we claim that the unipotent radical ru g 0 is non trivial suppose by contradiction that it is trivial i e g 0 is reductive consider the levi decomposition g 0 r g 0 s as g 0 is non compact amenable s is com pact anisotropic and the radicalr g 0 is a non compact torus say r g 0 f r with r 0 let t o r be the unique maximal compact sub group of r g 0 then ts is the unique maximal compact subgroup of g 0 so it is normal in g the quotient g ts contains zr with finite index be cause of the assumption g ts has property bplp contradicting corollary 4 5 ru g 0 ru g 0 1 i e ru g 0 is abelian otherwise ru g 0 r g 0 is a non compact and non co compact closed normal subgroup in g so ru g 0 f d for some d 1 since ru g 0 is normal in g it is co compact the result then follows from b c in theorem 1 4 5 non amenable groups proof of theorem 1 6 it is actually possible to weaken the assumption of theorem 1 6 rather drastically for this we need two more definitions a locally compact group is locally linear if it admits an open subgroup which is linear over some local field we also define the class of elementary groups as the smallest class of locally compact totally disconnected groups containing all discrete groups all profinite groups and closed under group extensions and directed unions of open subgroups theorem 5 1 let g be a non amenable locally compact group assume more over that g is either an almost connected lie group or a non elementary locally linear totally disconnected group the following are equivalent a g has property pl b every closed normal subgroup of g is either compact or co compact c there exists a compact normal subgroup w and a closed co compact normal subgroup n of g with w n such that n w is isomorphic to a direct product s 1 sn of simple algebraic groups over some local field f and the simple factors s 1 sn are permuted transitively under ad g 17 in particular theorem 5 1 applies to any non amenable group of the form g f the group of f rational points of a linear algebraic group g defined over a non archimedean local field f of any characteristic proof of theorem 5 1 c a let g w be as in c by lemma 3 1 in co 2 it is enough to show that g w has property pl so let l be an unbounded length function on g w we show that l is proper as m n w is co compact l m is unbounded so there exists some index i such that l si is unbounded say i 1 by assumption for j 2 r there exists gj g such that ad gj sj s 1 then for sj sj we have by the triangle inequality l gjsjg 1 j l sj 2 l gj so that l sj is unbounded too by theorem 1 4 in co 2 l si is proper for every i 1 r by lemma 1 7 in co 2 l m is proper so l is proper a b we already observed that in a locally compact compact group with property pl every closed normal subgroup is either compact or co compact b c the lie group case follows immediately from the already quoted caprace monod theorem theorem e in cm and the discussion preceding proposition 3 2 for the totally disconnected case we appeal to a structural result by caprace and stulemeijer corollary 1 2 in cs if g is totally disconnected and locally linear there exists closed characteristic subgroups w n g such that w is elementary n w if non trivial is a product s 1 sn of topologically simple algebraic groups over local fields f 1 fn in particular si is compactly generated and abstractly simple and g n is elementary in view of the assumption that g is non elementary n w is non trivial hence non compact in our case if we assume that all closed normal subgroups of g are either compact or co compact we get that w is compact and n is co compact finally ad g acts transitively on the simple factors of n w since a proper orbit would allow to construct a closed normal subgroup of g that is neither compact nor co compact 6 property bpl 2 in particular 6 1 proof of theorem 1 7 the implication b a is clear if g has the described form then by theorem 1 6 the group g has property pl a fortiori it has property bpl 2 the proof of a b is very similar in spirit to the proof of b c in theorem 1 6 let g be either an almost connected lie group or g g f a linear algebraic group over a local field f of characteristic 0 let g be the 18 lie algebra of g let g r s be a levi decomposition write s sc snc where sc stands for the compact anisotropic factors and snc stands for the non compact isotropic factors assume g non amenable so that snc 6 0 suppose that g has property bpl 2 but not fh then g admits a proper isometric action on a hilbert space i e g has the haagerup property by theorem 1 10 in co 1 this implies r snc 0 and all simple factors of snc have f rank 1 and are locally isomorphic to so n 1 or su n 1 n 2 if f r or if g is lie and almost connected by property bpl 2 any quotient of g by a closed non compact normal subgroup must have property fh see proposition 2 1 we now distinguish the two cases 6 1 1 the algebraic case let g 0 be the zariski connected component of identity of g the radical r g 0 is compact suppose not as r g 0 is characteristic in g 0 it is a closed non compact subgroup of g and the quotient g r g 0 does not have property fh contradicting property bpl 2 of g let sc resp snc be the zariski connected subgroup of g 0 corresponding to sc resp snc since snc is a characteristic ideal in g the subgroup snc is characteristic in g 0 hence normal and co compact in g finally ad g acts transitively on the simple factors of snc since a proper orbit would allow to construct a quotient of g by a closed non compact normal subgroup not having property fh let w z snc be the center of snc then the subgroup n snc w is the desired subgroup of g w 6 1 2 the lie case let g be a non amenable almost connected lie group with bpl 2 and without fh let g 0 rs be a levi decomposition of the connected component of identity g 0 of g then r is compact otherwise as above there is a quotient by a non compact normal subgroup not having fh so r is a compact torus and g 0 is reductive let sc and snc be the analytic subgroups corresponding to sc and snc respec tively note that snc is closed in g because r is compact the subgroup snc is characteristic in g 0 hence normal in g so snc is co compact in g as above ad g permutes the simple factors of snc transitively set w z snc the center of snc since w is normal in g and g w does not have property fh the subgroup w must be finite as in the algebraic case we set n snc w and it is the desired subgroup of g w 19 6 2 link with the howe moore property let h be a closed subgroup of the locally compact group g we recall definition 1 3 of ccltv definition 6 1 the pair g h has the relative howe moore property if every unitary representation of g either has h invariant vectors or is such that h is a c 0 representation the group g is a howe moore group if the pair g g has the relative howe moore property proposition 6 2 let n be a closed co compact normal subgroup of g if the pair g n has the relative howe moore property then g has property bpl 2 in particular every howe moore group has property bpl 2 proof let be a unitary representation of g and let b be a 1 cocycle with respect to set g b g 2 assuming that g n has the howe moore property we must prove that n is either bounded or proper so suppose that n is unbounded by scho nberg s theorem for t 0 the function t g e t g is positive definite on g so there exists a hilbert space ht and a unitary representation t of g on ht with a cyclic vector t ht such that t g t g t t for every g g claim t has no non zero n fixed vector to see this let h 0 be the space of n fixed vectors in ht and h be its orthogonal complement we must show that h 0 0 observe that h 0 and h are g invariant as n is normal in g for h write 0 in the decomposition ht h 0 h as t is cyclic it is enough to show that 0 t 0 but for h n t h t h t t 0 t 2 as n is unbounded we can find a sequence hn n 0 inn such that limn hn then limn t hn 0 on the other hand coefficients of t n on h are c 0 by the howe moore property for g n so limn t hn t t 0 hence 0 t 0 proving the claim from the claim plus the fact that g n has the howe moore property we deduce that t n is a c 0 function this is equivalent to saying that n is proper 20 we will see in example 6 4 below that the converse of proposition 6 2 does not hold in general we revisit semi direct products of the form v k where v rd d 2 and k is a closed subgroup of the unitary group u d denote by k 0 the connected component of identity of k corollary 6 3 consider the following statements a k 0 acts irreducibly on v a the pair v k v has the relative howe moore property b k is infinite and acts irreducibly on v b v k has property bpl 2 c k stabilizes no proper closed unbounded subgroup of v d k acts irreducibly on v then a a b b c d if k is connected all those statements are equivalent proof a a follows immediately from theorem 4 5 in ccltv a b follows by observing that if k 0 acts irreducibly then k 0 is non trivial hence infinite b b is theorem 1 4 above b c if the semi direct product v k has property bpl 2 then every closed normal subgroup of v k is either compact or co compact this rules out any proper closed unbounded k invariant subgroup of w c d is trivial and so is d a when k k 0 in general the implications a b b c c d cannot be reversed as the following examples show example 6 4 1 let k be the semi direct product k so 2 so 2 c 2 where c 2 acts by flipping the two factors then k acts on r 4 r 2 r 2 with the first resp second copy of so 2 acting by rotations on the first resp second copy of r 2 and c 2 flipping the two copies of r 2 then k acts irreducibly on r 4 but k 0 so 2 so 2 acts reducibly so b a does not hold in general since r 4 k has property bpl 2 but the pair r 4 k r 4 does not have the relative howe moore property the same example shows that the converse of proposition 6 2 fails in general 21 2 let cn denote the cyclic group of order n 2 let cn act on r 2 by rotations of angles a multiple of 2 n for n 6 2 3 4 6 the group k cn stabilizes no proper closed unbounded subgroup of r 2 so c b does not hold in general 3 consider the same action of cn by rotations on r 2 this time with n 3 4 6 the action is irreducible but stabilizes a lattice in r 2 so d c does not hold in general 7 groups acting on trees with property pl appendix by corina ciobotaru in this appendix we prove that closed non compact subgroups of aut td that act 2 transitively on td have property pl beside linear examples as sl 2 qp the latter family of groups contains examples of non compact locally compact groups that are non linear at least in characteristic 0 those are the universal groups u f introduced by burger mozes in bm section 3 we denote by td a d regular tree with d 3 and by aut td its group of automorphisms which is a locally compact group with respect to the compact open topology let aut td be the group of all type preserving automorphisms of td by a type preserving automorphism of td we mean one that preserves an orientation of td that is fixed in advance this is the same as saying that the automorphism acts without inversion we denote by td the set of endpoints of td they are also called the ideal points of td and we call td the boundary of td for every two points x y td td we denote by x y the unique geodesic between x and y in td td for g aut td and x y td td we define g x y g g g fixes pointwise the geodesic x y in particular gx g g g x x for td we define g g g g and g 0 g g g and g fixes at least one vertex of td notice that g can contain hyperbolic elements if this is the case then g 0 g for the remaining of the appendix we consider g to be a closed non compact subgroup of aut td that acts 2 transitively on td one easily sees tit that g contains at least one hyperbolic element typical examples of such subgroups g are sl 2 qp and the universal groups introduced by burger mozes in bm section 3 those groups are moreover topologically simple we will see below that the universal groups are not linear 22 definition 7 1 let a be a hyperbolic element of g corresponding to a we define the set u a g g lim n a ngan e notice that u a is a subgroup of g it is called the contraction group corresponding to a and in general it is not a closed subgroup of g in the same way but using anga n we define u a for example u a are closed when g sl 2 qp and not closed when g is the universal group u f of burger mozes let us recall some important properties of g when g is 2 transitive on td let us fix for what follows a hyperbolic element a of g and denote by t the translation axis of a where td are the repelling and respectively the attracting endpoints of a without loss of generality we can assume from now on that a is of translation length 2 see cio example 4 10 where 2 transitivity is explicitly used we fix a vertex x one has the following cartan decomposition see e g ciobotaru cio example 4 10 g kak where k gx g g g x x and a g g g g g note that a is a closed subgroup of g containing a notice also that each element of a either is elliptic thus fixing pointwise the axis or it is hyperbolic and thus translating along the axis moreover every element g g is of the form g k 1 a nk 2 for some k 1 k 2 k and some n z for the latter decomposition we used the fact that a has translation length 2 by cio proposition 4 11 we have that g g 0 g 0 moreover by cio proposition 4 15 and corollary 4 17 we have g u a a g u a a g 0 u a a g 0 and g 0 u a a g 0 notice that g g g 0 and g 0 are closed subgroups of g and that a g 0 a g 0 g 0 g 0 the following lemma says that hyperbolic elements in a are boundedly gen erated by g 0 g 0 lemma 7 2 see the proof of cc lemma 3 5 for every hyperbolic element a there exist 1 a hyperbolic and u g 0 g 0 such that 1 u 1 has same translation length as and 1 is a product of 6 elements from g 0 and g 0 23 proof as in the proof of cc lemma 3 5 we start with a basic observation let be a bi infinite geodesic line in td with td then the intersection is a geodesic ray y with y a vertex in we claim that there is some u g 0 mapping to and fixing y pointwise indeed because and are opposite to in td and g is 2 transitive on td we obtain that g 0 is transitive on td by cc lemma 3 5 there exists an element u g 0 with the desired property by the same argument applied to the pair of bi infinite geodesic lines and we deduce the existence of u g 0 mapping to and fixing pointwise next we claim that for every vertex y there exists r g 0 g 0 product of three elements from g 0 and g 0 such that r fixes x and swaps to i e r y y r and r indeed fix a vertex y because td is d regular with d 3 there exists td with y moreover we also have that y by the above claim we can find an element u g 0 fixing y pointwise and mapping y to y similarly there are elements v w g 0 both fixing y pointwise and such that v y y and w y u 1 y now we set r vuw by construction r fixes the vertex y r g 0 g 0 and r is the product of three elements from g 0 and g 0 moreover we have r y vuu 1 y v y y and r y vu y v y y so that r swaps y and y let now a be a hyperbolic element thus of translation length 2 n for some n n recall that g is type preserving fix x and let y be the midpoint of the segment x x because has even translation length y is a vertex of td by our second claim above there exist r 1 r 2 g 0 g 0 each being product of three elements from g 0 and g 0 such that r 1 x x r 2 y y and ri ri for i 1 2 we claim that r 2 r 1 a is a hyperbolic element of translation length 2 n and it is a product of six elements from g 0 and g 0 indeed r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 and r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 so r 2 r 1 a moreover r 2 r 1 x r 2 x x and thus r 2 r 1 is hyperbolic as desired in particular we obtain that u 1 1 r 2 r 1 fixes pointwise the bi infinite geodesic line thus u g 0 g 0 by taking 1 r 2 r 1 the conclusion follows 24 proposition 7 3 cf cornulier co 2 proposition 4 1 let l be a length func tion on u a a if l is non proper on a then l is bounded on u a and also on g 0 proof let w be a compact neighborhood of the identity element e in g so that l is bounded by a constant m on w suppose that the length function l is not proper on a then there exists an unbounded sequence an n n a such that l an n n is bounded by a constant m then for every n n we can write an kna mnk n for some kn k n k and some mn z we obtain that l a mn n n is bounded by a constant m and that mn by extracting a subsequence when n by replacing mn with mn as l is symmetric and by taking u u a one can suppose that limn a mnuamn e therefore for mn large enough we have that a mnuamn w we obtain that l u m 2 m for every u u a as g 0 u a a g 0 and because a g 0 is compact as a closed subgroup of k the function l is also bounded on g 0 the conclusion follows corollary 7 4 let g be a closed non compact subgroup of aut td that acts 2 transitively on td then g has property pl proof let l be a length function on g if l is non proper then by propo sition 7 3 we have that l is bounded on g 0 and g 0 as g kak and l is bounded on the compact subgroups k a g 0 and a g it is enough to prove that l remains bounded on the set of all hyperbolic elements in a this follows by applying the bounded generation result of lemma 7 2 to every hyperbolic element of a thus l is bounded on g as desired as we have mentioned above beside sl 2 qp examples of closed non compact subgroups of aut td that are topologically simple and act 2 transitively on td are the universal groups u f introduced by burger mozes in bm sec tion 3 these groups are defined as follows definition 7 5 let e td be the set of unoriented edges of the tree td let e td 1 d be a function whose restriction to the star e x of every vertex x td is a bijection such a function is called a legal coloring of the tree td definition 7 6 let f be a subgroup of permutations of the set 1 d and let be a legal coloring of td the universal group with respect to f and is defined as u f g aut td g e x 1 f for every x td 25 by u f one denotes the subgroup generated by the edge stabilizing ele ments of u f and u f aut td moreover amann amm proposition 52 tells us that the group u f is independent of the legal coloring of td immediately from the definition one deduces that u f and u f are closed subgroups of aut td notice that when f is the full permutation group sym d then u f aut td and u f aut td the latter group being an index 2 simple subgroup of aut td for this see tits tit an important property of these groups is that u f and u f act 2 transitively on the boundary td if and only if f is 2 transitive moreover u f is either trivial or it is a topologically simple group see bm amm moreover the group u f is not linear this is because u f has tits independence property see amann amm this implies by caprace de medts cd section 2 6 that the contraction groups u a corresponding to hyperbolic elements a u f are not closed by wang wan theorem 3 5 ii we know that the contraction groups corresponding to a p adic lie group are closed thus one obtains the non linearity of u f in characteristic 0 in particular when f is 2 transitive we conclude that the universal group u f is non linear in characteristic 0 and has property pl references amm o amann group of tree automorphisms and their
