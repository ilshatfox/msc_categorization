langlands correspondence for gl n of a non archimedean local field f parametrizes irreducible admissible representations of gl n f in terms of representations of the weil deligne group wdf of f the corre spondence whose existence for p adic fields was proved in joint work of the author with r taylor and then more simply by g henniart is characterized by its preservation of salient properties of the two classes of representations the article reviews the strategies of the two proofs both the author s proof with taylor and henniart s proof are global and rely ultimately on an understanding of the adic cohomology of a family of shimura varieties closely related to gl n the author s proof with taylor provides models of the cor respondence in the cohomology of deformation spaces introduced by drinfeld of certain p divisible groups with level structure the general local langlands correspondence replaces gl n f by an arbitrary reductive group g over f whose representations are conjecturally grouped in packets parametrized by homomorphisms from wdf to the lang lands dual group lg the article describes partial results in this direction for certain classical groups g due to jiang soudry and fargues the bulk of the article is devoted to motivating problems that remain open even for gl n foremost among them is the search for a purely lo cal proof of the correspondence especially the relation between the galois theoretic parametrization of representations ofgl n f and the group theoretic parametrization in terms of bushnell kutzko types other open questions in clude the fine structure of the cohomological realization of the local langlands correspondence does the modular local langlands correspondence of vigneras admit a cohomological realization 2000 mathematics subject

0304324 v 1 584 michael harris introduction compared to the absolute galois group of a number field e g gal q q the galois group f of a non archimedean local field f has a ridiculously simple structure modulo the inertia group if there is a natural isomorphism f if gal k f kf where kf is the residue field of f then gal k f kf is topologically generated by the geometric frobenius frob x x 1 q where q kf p f for p prime the inertia group has a two step filtration 1 pf if 6 p z 1 where the wild ramification group pf is a pro p group thus if f gl n c is a continuous homomorphism n 1 then the image of is solvable and pf is nilpotent this is still true when is a finite dimensional complex representation of the weil group the subgroup wf f of elements whose image in gal k f kf is an integral power of frob despite this simplicity our understanding of the set of equivalence classes of n dimensional representations of wf is far from complete at least when p divides n the reciprocity map of local class field theory f w abf identifies the set g 1 f of one dimensional representations of wf with the set a 1 f of irreducible representations of f gl 1 f more than a simple bijection this identification respects a number of salient structures and its behavior with respect to field extensions f f is well understood moreover it is compatible in a straightforward way with global class field theory and was historically first derived as a consequence of the latter a simple special case of langlands functoriality principle is the so called strong artin conjecture which identifies the artin l function attached to an ir reducible n dimensional representation of gal q k for a number field k as the l function of a cuspidal automorphic representation of gl n k as a local coun terpart langlands proposed a parametrization of irreducible admissible represen tations of reductive groups over the local field f in terms of representations of wf the prototypical example is the local langlands conjecture for gl n by analogy with the case n 1 the set of equivalence classes of irreducible admissible repre sentations of gn gl n f is denoted a n f by g n f we denote the set of equivalence classes of n dimensional representations not of wf but rather of the weil deligne group wdf and only consider representations for which any lifting of frob acts semisimply then the general local langlands conjecture for gl n in its crudest form asserts the existence of a family of bijections as f and n vary n f a n f g n f 0 1 on the local langlands correspondence 585 a normalization condition is that the central character of a n f correspond to det via local class field theory the first general result of this type was proved by henniart he 1 early work of bernstein and zelevinsky reduced 0 1 to the existence of bijections n f a 0 n f g 0 n f 0 2 where g 0 n f are the irreducible representations of wf and a 0 n f is the su percuspidal subset of a n f both sides of 0 2 are homogeneous spaces under a 1 f and thus under its subset aunr 1 f of unramified characters of f if a 0 n f resp g 0 n f we denote by resp the tensor product of resp with the one dimensional representation det of gn resp with the character 1 f ofwf each a unr 1 f orbit on either side of 0 2 has a discrete invariant the artin conductor a resp a and the sets a 0 n f a resp g 0 n f a of orbits with given artin conductor a are known to be finite the main theorem of he 1 is the numerical local langlands correspondence a 0 n f a g 0 n f a 0 3 established by painstakingly counting both sides it has been known for some time that a family of bijections 0 2 compatible with artin conductors and twists by a 1 f is not unique henniart showed the uniqueness theorem he 2 that at most one normalized bijection is compatible with contragredients and twists and satisfies the condition l s l s s s 0 4 for a 0 n f a 0 n f n n here f c is a non trivial character the l and factors are defined on the automorphic side in jps sh on the galois side by langlands and deligne cf d it is in this version that the local langlands conjecture for gl n has finally been established for fields of positive characteristic in lrs and for p adic fields in ht followed shortly thereafter by he 3 see also he 5 1 compatibility with global correspondences as in the first proofs of local class field theory the bijections 0 2 are con structed in lrs ht he 3 by local specialization of maps for certain global fields e n e a good n e g n e 1 1 here e is supposed to have a place w such that ew f agood n e is a class of cuspidal automorphic representations of gl n e chosen to fit the circumstances and g n e can be taken to be the set of equivalence classes of compatible families of n dimensional semi simple adic representations of gal e e in particular 586 michael harris both sides of 1 1 as well as 0 2 are taken with adic rather than complex coefficients this does not change the problem in an essential way the map of 0 1 is particularly simple for unramified representations an unramified g n f is given by an unordered n tuple 1 n of unramified characters of w abf f ordering the i arbitrarily we obtain a character of the levi subgroup gn 1 of a borel subgroup b gn the element of a n f corresponding to is then the unique subquotient 1 of the normalized induced representation ind gl n f b containing a vector fixed bygl n of of the integer ring of f this defines a bijection a special case of the satake parametriza tion between the unramified subset gunr n f and the unramified spherical rep resentations aunr n f of gn fix an automorphic representation v v of gl n e the representation n e when it exists should have the property that n e wev n ev v 1 2 for almost all v such that v a unr n ev i e all but finitely many v by chebotarev density this determines n e uniquely one can then hope that hope 1 3 n e wev depends only on f and v for all v including v w the place of interest setting n f v n e wev one then needs to show that 1 4 for any a 0 n f there exists a good n e for some e with w 1 5 for agood n e agood n e the completed l function s n e n e satisfies the functional equation s n e n e s n e n e 1 s n e n e s n e n e v v s n e n e v is the product of local deligne langlands factors here denotes contragredient the local additive characters v are assumed to be the local components of a continuous character of ae e 1 6 the map n f a 0 n f g n f i takes values in g 0 n f ii defines a bijection a 0 n f g 0 n f iii satisfies the remaining requirements of a local langlands correspondence especially 0 4 the main burden of lrs is the construction of a class agood n e large enough to satisfy 1 4 now a moot point since lafforgue has proved that all cus pidal automorphic representations of gl n of a function field are good in this on the local langlands correspondence 587 sense the agood n e in lrs are the automorphic representations that con tribute to the cohomology of an appropriate drinfeld modular variety constructed from scratch for the occasion attached to the multiplicative group of a division algebra of dimension n 2 over e unramified at the chosen w property 1 5 in this case follows from general results of deligne in d valid only in equal characteristic now by 1 2 for a sufficiently large set s of places of e we have v s l s v v v s l s n ev v n ev v 1 7 where the left hand side is the rankin selberg l function completing the latter to s and applying jps or sh we find the functional equation s v v s v 1 s 1 8 in other words the partial l functions identified via 1 8 satisfy two functional equations 1 5 and 1 8 an argument first used by henniart then yields 0 4 and then 1 3 and the full local langlands conjecture follow from the uniqueness theorem of he 2 when f is p adic a class ack n e satisfying 1 2 is implicitly defined by work of clozel and kottwitz k cl 1 provided e is a cm field for ack n e one can take cuspidal automorphic representations cohomological at all archimedean primes square integrable at several finite primes other than w and such that c where c denotes conjugation of e over its maximal totally real subfield however the galois theoretic functional equation 1 5 is only available a priori when n e is associated to a global complex representation of the weil group of e i e when n e becomes abelian over a finite extension of e the article h 2 showed that there were enough of this type in ack n e denoting by agood n e the set of such we find that 1 4 is impossible as soon as p divides n however an argument in h 2 based on brauer s theorem on induced characters and 0 3 shows that 1 4 is true virtually in the set of formal sums with integral coefficients of elements of agood n e for varying n it then suffices to prove the following weak form of 1 3 which occupies the bulk of ht theorem 1 9 ht for all ack n e the semisimplification n e wev ss of n e wev depends only on f and v for all v more precisely ht proves that n e wf ss can be calculated explicitly in the vanishing cycles of certain formal deformation spacesmhlt f defined by drinfeld see 2 following k cl 1 the representations n e are initially realized in the cohomology of certain shimura varieties with canonical models over e and 1 9 is proved by a study of their bad reduction at w henniart soon realized that for agood n e the purely local nature of n e wev ss and hence the definition of a map n f could be derived directly from 1 5 and from the results of he 1 he 2 588 michael harris though he 3 dispenses with the geometry it is still a global argument inasmuch as it relies on h 2 which in turn depends on k cl 1 and cl the conditional base change results of cl a global consequence of theorem 1 9 is the generalized ramanujan conjecture for the automorphic representations in ack n e if ack n e and is unitary then its local component v is tempered at every finite prime v clozel in cl 1 already showed this to be true for almost all unramified v generalizing a method developed by lubotzky phillips and sarnak for the 2 sphere clozel cl 2 uses the version of the generalized ramanujan conjecture proved in ht to obtain effective constructions of families of equidistributed points on odd dimensional spheres with 0 1 out of the way we can propose the following improvement of 1 3 problem 1 show that n e wev n ev v 1 10 for n 2 this was established by carayol assuming standard conjectures on the semisimplicity of frobenius theorem 1 9 shows that it holds up to semisim plification the techniques of ht like the earlier work of kottwitz treating un ramified places is based on a comparison of trace formulas and cannot detect the difference between two representations with the same semisimplification assuming semisimplicity of frobenius the equality 1 10 follows easily from theorem 1 9 and deligne s conjecture apparently inaccessible on the purity of the monodromy weight filtration compatibility with functoriality given cuspidal automorphic representations i of gl ni e for i 1 2 r and a homomorphism gl n 1 gl nr gl n of algebraic groups langlands functoriality predicts the exis tence of an automorphic representation 1 r not necessarily cuspidal of gl n e such that for almost all unramified places v of e n ev 1 r v r i 1 ni ev i v 1 11 in recent years this has been proved for general number fields e in several impor tant special cases the tensor products gl 2 gl 2 gl 4 ramakrishnan and gl 2 gl 3 gl 6 kim shahidi and the symmetric powers sym 3 gl 2 gl 4 kim shahidi and sym 4 gl 2 gl 5 kim it has been veri fied in all four cases that 1 11 holds for all v construction of supercuspidal representations by backwards lifting the unitary representation a 0 n f is isomorphic to its contragredient if and only if the local factor l s has a pole at s 0 which is necessarily simple the local factor can be decomposed as a product l s l s sym 2 l s 2 1 12 on the local langlands correspondence 589 where the two terms on the right are defined for unramified by langlands and in general by shahidi only one of the factors on the right has a pole using the class agood n e of automorphic representations henniart has shown that it is the first factor resp the second factor if and only if is orthogonal resp symplectic the symplectic case only arises for n even one thus expects that is obtained by functorial transfer from an l packet of a classical group g over f via the map of l groups lg gl n c where lg so n c resp sp n c if the first resp the second factor in 1 12 has a pole at s 0 in particular when n 2 m and l s 2 has a pole at s 0 should come from an l packet on the split group so 2 m 1 f using a local analogue of the method of backwards lifting or automorphic descent due to ginzburg rallis and soudry jiang and soudry have constructed a generic supercuspidal representation of so 2 m 1 f for every a 0 n f with the indicated pole more generally they have obtained a complete parametrization of generic representations of split g so 2 m 1 f in terms of langlands parameterswdf lg js these results should certainly extend to other classical groups 2 cohomological realizations of the local correspondence the theory of the new vector implies easily that any irreducible admissible representation a n f has a rational model over the field of definition of its isomorphism class the brauer obstruction is trivial for gn the analogous assertion fails for representations in g n f thus one cannot expect the existence of a space m with a natural action of gn wf whose cohomology of whatever sort realizes the local langlands correspondence as an identity of virtual representations n f homgn hc m i 1 ihomgn h i c m 2 1 we add a third group to the picture by taking j to be an inner form of gn the multiplicative group of a central simple algebra d over f of dimension n 2 with hasse invariant rd n the set a n f contains a subset a 2 n f of discrete series representations character twists of those realized in the regular representation on l 2 gn modulo center the set a j of equivalence classes of irreducible admissible representations contains an analogous subset a 2 j equal to a j if d is a division algebra the jacquet langlands correspondence r dkv is a bijection jl a 2 gn a 2 j determined by the identity of distribution characters g j jl j a 2 g 2 2 if j 1 is the kottwitz sign and g and j are elliptic regular elements with the same eigenvalues when rd 1 there are two spaces n f and m n lt f with natural gn j actions the former is a countable union indexed by z of copies of the 590 michael harris profinite e tale cover n 0 f of the rigid analytic upper half space n f p n 1 cp pn 1 f defined by

f of equal characteristic by hausberger hau the case of mnlt f again for supercuspidal was initially treated by boyer bo in the equal characteristic case the analogous statement for f p adic and for any is the logical starting point of the proof of theorem 1 9 in ht theorem 2 3 is extended in ht to general a 2 g the explicit formula for the alternating sum of the homj h i c m n lt f jl is awkward

homj h i c m n lt f jl for all i j all a n f in particular show that ext j gn hic f vanishes unless there exists a 2 n f such that and induce the same character of the bernstein center the results of

i 6 n 1 and for j 6 0 this vanishing property should characterize on the local langlands correspondence 591 supercuspidal among representations in a 2 n f when is the steinberg representation the hic f as well as the corresponding ext groups are calculated explicitly in ss the calculation in ss is purely local whereas the vanishing outside the middle degree for a 0 n f is based on properties of automorphic forms problem 3 find a purely local proof of the vanishing property for a 0 n f the covering group of n 0 f over n f can be identified with the maximal com pact subgroup j 0 j thus hic f

the case in question for g j gu 3 rogawski has defined a local langlands correspondence via base change to gl 3 in that case the supercuspidal representations of g are grouped into l packets fargues s techniques apply to this case as well and he obtains a 592 michael harris version of the kottwitz rapoport conjectures more difficult to state than theorem 2 5 higher ext s are involved and the formula is averaged over l packets 1 more generally fargues methods apply to classical groups attached to shimura varieties whenever the trace formula is known to be stable and functorial transfer from g to gl n has been established in contrast to ht fargues methods are essentially rigid analytic and make no use of equivariant regular integral models of shimura varieties in wildly ramified level fortunately so since such models are not known to exist heuristically the characters of the representations of g and j on h m can be related by applying a lefschetz trace formula to adic cohomology of the rigid space m this approach which in principle provides no information about thewf action has been successfully applied to nf by faltings in f 1 and to m n lt f by strauch s when n 2 for higher mnlt f and for the rapoport zink spaces studied by fargues one does not yet know how to deal with wild boundary terms in huber s lefschetz formula hu and its higher dimensional generalizations using work of oort and zink on stratification of families of abelian varieties and the slope filtration for p divisible groups mantovan m has developed another approach to the cohomology of shimura varieties of pel type closer in spirit to ht than to f m obtains finer results on the geometry of the special fiber and a description of the cohomology in ramified level similar to that of f cohomological realizations with torsion coefficients it would be convenient if the following question had an affirmative answer question 5 is hic n f z a torsion free z module the global trace formula methods used in h 1 and ht to derive theorem 2 3 from an analysis of the cohomology of the simple shimura varieties of the title of k are insensitive to torsion in cohomology when n it may be possible as in recent work of mokrane and tilouine to combine adic hodge theory with the generalized eichler shimura congruence formula for the same simple shimura varieties to answer question 5 for n completely new ideas are needed when k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 6 p vigne ras has defined a class of smooth supercuspidal representations a 0 k n f of gn with co efficients in k and has proved that they are in bijection with the set g 0 k n f of irreducible n dimensional representations of wf over k see article in these pro ceedings it is natural to expect that this modular local langlands correspondence is realized on the spaces h c m k with m n f or m n lt f problem 6 define a modular jacquet langlands map 7 jl froma 0 k n f to k representations of j and formulate the last sentence precisely does the virtual 1 the statement of the general kottwitz rapoport conjectures in h 3 for general discrete series representations is based on a misreading of

assumption that the modular jacquet langlands map can be extended to a wider class of k representations of gn perhaps including reduction mod of supercuspidal representations in characteristic zero one can of course ask the same questions when p in this case we can consider rigid de rham cohomology in the sense of berthelot as well as p adic e tale co homology all three groups gn j and wf have large analytic families of p adic representations it is not at all clear whether the p adic cohomology of nf is suffi ciently rich to account for all p adic deformations in categories yet to be

moy expresses in terms of work in progress of bushnell and henniart shows that this conjecture is almost right probably up to an unramified character of degree at two 594 michael harris parametrization via types a fundamental theorem of bushnell and kutzko asserts that every supercusp idal can be obtained by compactly supported induction from a finite dimensional representation of a subgroup h gn which is compact modulo the center zn of gn the pair h called an extended type is unique up to conjugation by gn the character can be obtained from h by a simple integral formula bh a 14 the outstanding open problem concerning the local langlands correspondence is undoubtedly problem 8 a define directly in terms of h and vice versa b show directly that the definition of in a has the properties of a local langlands correspondence note that b presupposes a direct construction of the local galois constants problem 8 formulates the hope often expressed for a purely local construction

wildly ramified supercuspidal representations of gpm and wildly ramified 2 representations in g 0 p m f preserving local constants bh ii in each instance the constructions and proofs are based
