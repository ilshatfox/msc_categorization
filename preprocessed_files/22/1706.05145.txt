a split reductive algebraic group by a cyclic group of order n we compute the plancherel measure of the representation using eisenstein series and a comparison method in addition we construct genuine central characters of the metaplectic torus in the simply laced case 1 introduction let f be a non archimedean local field with ring of integers of and assume that g is a split reductive group defined over f let n be a positive integer a central extension of g by n is a topological group g that fits in the following exact sequence 1 n g g 1 the aim of this paper is to study the principal series representations of g such represen tations have been studied by several authors kazhdan and patterson 5 have studied the case of gln in which they have carried out the local theory and global theory in particu lar the theory of eisenstein series in great detail savin 11 has considered the case when g is simply laced and simply connected the double cover of a general simply connected reductive group has been studied by loke and savin 6 in which they construct genuine automorphic representations of the metaplectic torus using theta series mcnamara 7 has generalized the theory to the case of an arbitrary reductive group under the hypothesis that 2 n is coprime to the residual characteristic of f and f contains 2 n distinct 2 n th roots of unity in another direction weissman 14 has studied extensively the structure of the metaplectic torus both in the local and global cases and their representations this paper studies the same objects the above authors have considered with the following new results and constructions 1 we remove the tameness assumption on n imposed by mcnamara and other authors 2 we use a comparison method to compute the plancherel measures of ramified repre sentations of g f more precisely we compare the covering group with a well chosen linear group motivated by 14 and transfer the plancherel measure from the linear case to the non linear case this has been done for g the n fold cover of sl 2 f by goldberg and szpruch in 4 using a different approach 3 we give explicit constructions of genuine weyl group invariant central automorphic character of the covering torus in the sense of 14 definition 4 7 the organization of this paper is as follows in section 2 we review the local theory most of the results are known for a long time in section 3 we review the global theory in particular we obtain a product formula of local plancherel measures which will be used in the comparison method mentioned above in section 4 we carry out the comparison 1 http arxiv org abs 1706 05145 v 2 2 shiang tang method and prove our main theorem on the relation between plancherel measures of non linear groups and their associated linear groups under the assumption on the existence of genuine weyl group invariant central automorphic characters of the metaplectic torus in section 5 we construct explicitly such characters for simply laced groups and hence prove their existence i would like to thank my advisor gordan savin without whom none of this work would be possible 2 central extensions of split reductive groups over local fields 2 1 group theory let p be a fixed prime and n be a fixed integer let f be a finite extension of qp with ring of integers r and maximal ideal m generated by a uniformizer we assume that f contains the group n of n th roots of unity let g be a split reductive group over f with lie algebra g let t be a fixed maximal split torus of g with lie algebra t let g t be the root system associated to t and let the set of coroots we fix a borel subgroup b containing t with the corresponding set of positive roots and let be the subset of simple roots let x be the character lattice and y be the cocharacter lattice of t we have x and y the quadruple x y is called the root datum of g which determines g up to isomorphism let h x be a chevalley basis of gder g g let gsc be the simply connected chevalley group with lie algebra gder there exists a map gsc g which differentiates to the inclusion map gder g on the level of lie algebras the elements x t w t h t in g sc are defined as in 9 we use the same symbols to denote their images in g however x t for t f no longer generate g let k be a maximal subgroup of g with the property that the adjoint action of k preserves the r lattice in gder spanned by the chevalley basis then k is a maximal compact subgroup of g in particular when g is simply connected k is the subgroup of g generated by x t for t r we may identify t with y f let y y z be an integer valued symmetric bilinear form on y that is weyl group invariant and satisfies 2 when is long let g be a nontrivial central extension of g by the group of n th roots of unity 1 n g g 1 let t be the preimage of t in g we assume the followings 1 y 1 t 1 y 2 t 2 t 1 t 2 y 1 y 2 n where yi ti represents an element in the fibre of yi ti t by abuse of notation and n is the hilbert norm residue symbol in class field theory 2 if p does not divide n then there is a splitting not necessarily unique section s k g the image of s is denoted by k remark 1 item 1 implies that given t t t their commutator t t n only depends on t t t principal series representations of metaplectic groups 3 remark 2 item 2 implies that on k 0 the subgroup of k generated by x t with t r and s is the same as the canonical section which sends x t to its unique lift in g remark 3 for any t f x t g lifts uniquely to g and we use x t to denote the lift define w t x t x t 1 x t h t w t w 1 by 9 when is simply laced we have the following relations in t h t h u t u nh tu h t h u t u n however the h s do not generate t unless g g g 2 2 unramified principal series in this section we keep the assumptions made in sec tion 2 1 suppose we have an irreducible genuine representation of the metaplectic torus t which is weyl group invariant i e its central character is fixed by the conjugation action of the weyl group by 1 proposition 2 2 there is a bijection between irreducible gen uine representations of t and genuine central characters of its center zt we say that is unramified if t 0 6 0 where t 0 t k proposition 2 1 zt t 0 is a maximal abelian subgroup of t containing t 0 proof clearly zt t 0 is an abelian group we need to show that any element in zt t 0 must belong to zt t 0 observe that every element in t t 0 is represented by an element in t which is of the form x for some x y therefore it is enough to show that if x centralizes t 0 then it must lie in zt to see this note that x y u 1 for any y y and any u r the lhs of which is u x y u 1 x y q 1 n by item 1 so n divides x y for all y y it follows that x zt proposition 2 2 if p does not divide n and is unramified then dim t 0 1 proof let be the central character of observe that is trivial on zt k in fact choose 0 6 v 0 t 0 we have for any z t 0 v 0 z v 0 z v 0 which forces z to be 1 let be the extension of to zt t 0 by letting act trivially on t 0 form the induction indtzt t 0 which has central character frobenius reciprocity gives homt ind t ztt 0 homztt 0 ztt 0 since is unramified there is a line l that is fixed by t 0 so is a summand of ztt 0 and hence there is a nonzero t intertwining map from indtztt 0 to claim for any s t zt t 0 s 6 on t 0 once we have proved this claim it will follow by mackey s criterion that indtztt 0 is irreducible and isomorphic to and that has multiplicity one in indtzt t 0 zt t 0 from which the proposition follows 4 shiang tang to prove the claim we may assume that s x for some x y if the claim were false then s t 1 for all t t 0 that is x y u 1 for any y y and u r by the proof of the previous proposition this would imply s zt a contradiction lemma 2 3 suppose are roots in such that 1 which implies that and w then h t c t tn h t h t where n is 1 when is long and is the maximal number of links between adjacent dots in the dynkin diagram of when is short proof let u t h t hw t w u h t w u

hw t for any t f n and any since the central character of is invariant under the action of w the above identities imply h t 1 for any t f n and for all roots of the same length suppose that is simply laced and is not of type a 1 we have by 2 3 h t h t h t when 1 and t f n it is clear that such pair of roots exist if is not of type principal series representations of metaplectic groups 5 a 1 pick such pair of roots we have h t h t h t 1 therefore h t 1 t f n for all roots the demonstration for multi laced is similar remark 4 2 4 is true for short roots for of type g 2 and 3 not dividing n and for of type f 4 and 2 not dividing n example 2 1 if g sl 2 and n 1 any quadratic character of t is weyl group invariant so 2 4 fails in this case let b be a borel subgroup of g corresponding to we have b tn where n is the unipotent radical of b which lifts uniquely to g let b tn be the preimage of b tn define an induced representation normalized induction i indgb where is an unramified character of t for any w nk t t 0 choose a representative w in nk t there is a unique isomorphism jw w such that jw fixes t 0 pointwise in other words j w 1 tw t j t t and j v 0 v 0 for any v 0 t 0 if w is a different representative in nk t say w w t 0 for some t 0 t 0 then jw jw t 0 fix an haar measure on n for every w w there is an intertwining operator aw aw i i w defined as follows aw f x jw nw

double cover of a simply connected algebraic group over non archimedean fields and see 7 section 7 for the case when g is an n fold cover of an algebraic group over non archimedean fields in 12 an archimedean analogue is also established the following proposition is well known we record it here for the reader s convenience we normalize the haar measure m on f such that m r d 1 2 f where df is the discriminant of f over qp proposition 2 6 suppose that is a long root when is not of type a 1 and suppose satisfies 2 4 when is of type a 1 let f o i k be a function such that f o 1 v 0 where v 0

chevalley group defined over k we use gv to denote g kv for each v there is a unique up to isomorphism nontrivial central extension gv of gv by n 9 1 n gv gv 1 consider the restricted product g v gv with respect to the family of compact subgroups kv of gv generated by x t t rv for each v let zv denote the kernel of the covering projection gv gv form the restricted product i e all but finitely many components of any given element is 1 z v zv and let z 0 be the subgroup of z consisting of elements whose coordinates multiply up to one define g ak g z 0 which fits into a short exact sequence 1 n g ak g ak 1 proposition 3 1 suppose that g is a simply connected chevalley group then there is an injective homomorphism from g k to g ak proof let g k be the subgroup of g generated by x t x t x t with t k and let h k be its image in g ak we still use x t to denote the image of x t in h k they generate h k by definition put w t x t x t 1 x t and h t w t w 1 claim g k h k to prove the claim notice that h t h u h tu by hilbert reciprocity since g is simply connected there is a surjection f g k h k mapping x t to x t on the other hand there is a surjection g g k g k such that g x t x t and that g is principal series representations of metaplectic groups 9 trivial on z 0 so g factors through h k g k which is still denoted by g now g f is the identity map which forces f g to be isomorphisms in general if g is a split connected reductive group defined over k such an explicit construction is not available to us instead we will simply impose a number of axioms 1 there is a central extension g ak of g ak by n 1 n g ak g ak 1 2 for each place v of k there is a central extension 1 n gv gv 1 such that 2 1 item 1 holds for all v and 2 1 item 2 holds for all but finitely many v 3 there is a surjection v gv g ak whose kernel is in the center of v gv 4 there is an injective homomorphism from g k to g ak the metaplectic torus t ak is the image of the restricted product of t kv v with respect to t rv t kv kv v in g ak 3 2 principal series representations and intertwining maps we begin with a defi nition definition 3 1 we say a character v of zt zt ak is a genuine automorphic central character genuine acc in short of t t ak if 1 z z z zt n 2 is trivial on t k zt 3 is unramified almost everywhere i e for v outside a finite set of places s which contains all archimedean places and places where the residue characteristic divides n v is trivial on zt rv suppose that v is invariant under the conjugation action of the weyl group and is an irreducible representation of t ak with central character may be decomposed as a restricted tensor product of genuine irreducible representations v of tv with central character v v v where the the restricted product is with respect to a fixed set of vectors uv 6 0 v s uv t 0 v v let v v be an unramified character of t k t ak for example the adelic absolute value function ak v v a k r 0 is an unramified character of a k let i ind g a b a and let i v ind g kv b kv v v 10 shiang tang we have dim iv kv 1 for almost all v for such v let f v iv kv be the unique vector valued function so that f v 1 uv then i is the restricted tensor product of i v for v with respect to this set of functions suppose that is a submodule of l 2 t k t ak for a w w and a choice w of its representative in ng k t k the natural action of w on l 2 t k t ak maps to w which has the same underlying vector space but a twisted t ak action let jw be the vector space isomorphism w 7 w t w 1 tw we have jw vj v w where j v w w v v is defined in section 2 2 for v s take a representative w of w define for any f i aw f x jw nw ak f w 1 nx dn here nw ak n ak wn ak w 1 n ak and we normalize the haar measure on ak so that it is the product measure of the lebesgue measure on r for v real twice the lebesgue measure on c for v complex and the unique haar measure on kv such that rv has measure d 1 2 kv for v non archimedean where dkv is the absolute discriminant of kv proposition 3 2 aw maps i into i w and is independent of the choice of a repre sentative of w in ng k t k proof by the definition of j aw maps i into i w if w w t for some t t k then f w 1 nx 1 2 n t 1 t 1 t 1 f w 1 nx t 1 f w 1 nx on the other hand jw jw t since any function in the vector space is left t k invariant thus aw is independent of the choice of a representative of w in ng k t k proposition 3 3 aw v aw v where for each v aw v i v i w v is an intertwining map between local principal series proof this follows from the definition of intertwining operators and the identity jw j v w remark 5 the tensor decomposition of aw also yields for v s a canonical intertwining operator at v i e it does not depend on the choice of a representative of w let c n ak t k g ak be the space of smooth left n ak invariant left t k invariant right k ak finite functions on g ak and let c n ak t k g ak principal series representations of metaplectic groups 11 be the subspace consisting of functions such that for any k k ak the function k t 1 2 t tk belongs to the isotypic component of in l 2 t k t ak this definition is from 8 ch 1 3 3 lemma 3 4 for f i let f

f x t which is f x 1 since f x it remains to check that 1 f k for any k k a in fact t t a 1 t t 1 2 f tk 1 t t 1 2 f tk 1 t f k 1 f k t which shows 1 f k f k for c n a t k g a and x g a whenever the integral below is conver gent we set mw x nw ak w 1 nx dn note that this integral is independent of the choice of a representative of w proposition 3 5 the integral defined above converges absolutely when belongs to an open subset of x t c andmw maps c n a t k g a into c n a t k g a w proof the first half is proved in 8 ch 2 1 6 which also proved thatmw maps the space c n a t k g a into c n a t k g a w w but the latter is equal to c n a t k g a w since w theorem 3 6 8 ch 4 1 10 7 mw can be continued in a unique way to a mero morphic function on x t c moreover we have the equality of meromorphic functions given by mw w mw mw w lemma 3 7 for any f i we have aw f mw f proof aw f x jw nw ak f w 1 nx dn 1 nw ak jw f w 1 nx 1 dn nw ak f w 1 nx 1 dn mw f x 12 shiang tang corollary 3 8 aw w aw aw w 3 3 rank one group in this section we assume that gder sl 2 so g t g g where t is the maximal abelian subalgebra of g and is a root of g let g be a connected reductive group with lie

among the lie algebras gder g we use h t to denote the image of diag t t 1 sl 2 let t ak r 0 be a character such that h t t sa for some complex number s let v be a place of k for generic i v is irreducible hence by schur s lemma a wv a v is a constant which only depends on s and we denote by v s define the plancherel measure v s 1 v s by 2 6 v s dkv 1 h nv 1 q 1 v h n v 1 h nv 1 q 1 v h n v

ls ns 1 f which proves the proposition 4 a comparison method 4 1 a related linear reductive group given a connected reductive group g defined over a local field f and a central extension g of g by n we will define a linear reductive group that is closely related to g as in section 2 1 let x x t y x t and fix a non degenerate symmetric weyl group invariant bilinear form on y such that 2 for all we define following 14 section 1 y y y y y nz y y it is clear that y f zt with the covering map let y 1 n y and let x be the dual lattice of y under the natural perfect pairing xq yq q lemma 4 1 x y y proof since ny y y y for any and y y write y 1 n y for some y y we have y 1 n y 1 n y which is in z because of y and the definition of y it follows that x y is a root datum associated to some linear connected reductive group g with a maximal torus t such that x is the character lattice of t y is the cocharacter lattice of t g t is the root system of g g t is the coroots of g there is a group homomorphism t t induced by the inclusion map y y as in setting of section 3 2 we form the principal series representation of g ak induced from where is an unramified automorphic character of t ak and is an irreducible genuine automorphic representation of t with a weyl group invariant genuine automorphic central character we also consider the principal series representation of g ak denoted i induced from where denotes the trivial representation of t ak we compare the product formulas 3 10 for these groups let us fix a long root and suppose h t t sak for some complex number s depending on

14 shiang tang on the other hand we have for the associated linear group g v s v s v s dkv ls s 1 ls s ls s 1 ls s 1 therefore after making a simple substitution s 7 ns in the second equation we obtain theorem 4 2 let be an unramified character of t k t ak let be a weyl group invariant genuine irreducible representation of t ak such that for all v s v h t n 1 t k v let be a long root of such that h t t s ak then v s v s v s v ns for all but finitely many s c 4 2 application to ramified representations of reductive groups over local fields 4 2 gives us a way to go from those easy to compute plancherel measures of linear groups to those unknown plancherel measures of covering groups we will make it precise in this section let p be any prime and let n be any positive integer let f be a finite extension of qp containing n let q p f be the order of its residue field kf let g be a n fold cover of a split connected reductive group g defined over f suppose that we have an irreducible genuine weyl group invariant representation p of the metaplectic torus t and an unramified character p of t form the principal series representation of g f i p ind g b p p for any w w let aw p i p i w p be the standard intertwining operator then for generic p i p i w p are irreducible and hence for any simple reflection w w we have aw w p aw p 1 p p id suppose that p h t t s p for some s c let p s p p our goal in this section is to find an explicit expression of p s in the case when the principal series i p is ramified i e i p kp 0 let k be a global field that has completions isomorphic to f at places above p such k is easy to be constructed for instance take k 0 to be a number field that has exactly one place p above p such that kp f then we can take k to be the composite of k 0 and q n the number field k may have multiple places above p let p be the central character of p lemma 4 3 let v be a complex place k and be a simple root of g suppose that v h t t s v where t c v is the square of the complex absolute value and s c then v s s 2 4 2 theorem 4 4 main theorem let be a long root suppose that there is a weyl group invariant genuine acc such that v p for all v p and for all but finitely many principal series representations of metaplectic groups 15 places v v h t n 1 t k v suppose also that there is an unramified character of t k t ak such that h t t s a then p s c p ns for some constant c therefore p s is a constant multiple of 1 q ns 1 q ns 1 1 qns 1 qns 1 proof this will follow from 4 2 together with an elementary argument we are going to present since we are fixing we write v in place of v for any v the set of places of k we may assume that k has no real embeddings let m be the number of places of k above p for any complex place v by 4 3 v ns v s is a constant so 4 2 and the assumption gives p s m v sf p v s c p ns m v sf p v ns 1 for some constant c here sf p denotes the set of finite places in s that is not above p by 3 9 we may write up to constant that p s i ai q s ai q s bi q s bi qs for finitely many complex numbers ai bi counting multiplicities choose for each i a complex number si so that ai q si then the zeros of p s are si 2 i log q z si 2 i f log p z on the other hand by 2 6 the zeros of the right hand side of 1 are 2 i n log qv z 2 i nfv log pv z for some v sf we claim that si 2 i nf log p z for all i in fact for a fixed i by pigeonhole principal there is some prime p such that there are infinitely many elements in si 2 i f log p z that belong to 2 i nf log p z if p 6 p take two distinct elements in si 2 i f log p z 2 i nf log p z because their difference also belongs to 2 i nf log p z we obtain a nontrivial q linear relation among log p and log p which is impossible since log p log p are linearly independent over q therefore p p and in particular si 2 i nf log p z proves the claim it follows that ani 1 and all the zeros of p s belong to 2 i nf log p z 16 shiang tang by the same argument bni q and all the poles of p s belong to 1 n 2 i nf log p z therefore the zeros and poles of p s m are contained in that of p ns m it follows that p s m is a constant multiple of p ns m i e p s p ns m is a constant on the other hand by 3 9 both of p s and p ns are positive on the imaginary axis so p s p ns must equal to a positive constant when restricted to the imaginary axis it follows that p s p ns is a constant remark 6 in certain cases the assumption in 4 4 can be achieved using the construction of a weyl group invariant genuine acc in section 5 5 construction of weyl group invariant genuine automorphic central characters 5 1 n fold cover of sl 2 we let m to be n when n is odd and n 2 when n is even then y my mz and hence both t f and t f are isomorphic to f the natural inclusion y y induces a map t f t f t tm the covering torus t f is generated by symbols h t t f satisfying h t h u t u nh tu let t f t f h t 7 t be the covering map we define t f to be the set f n with group law t t tt when n 0 1 4 t t tt t t 2 when n 2 4 under this group law t f is an abelian group moreover t f t f t 7 t is an n to 1 homomorphism we then define a map t f t f t 7 h tm then it is a group homomorphism with image z f the center of t f it follows that z f t f m 1 let f f 2 be a function such that a b a b f ab and 1 1 where a b f is the quadratic hilbert symbol we now define a character of t f as follows when n 0 1 4 t 7 when n 2 4 t 7 t then it factors through z f because the weil index is trivial on m n 2 when n is even it is easy to see that this character is weyl group invariant we denote this character by p where p indicates the residual characteristics of f proposition 5 1 any weyl group invariant genuine character of t f is a product of p and a quadratic character proof take two genuine weyl group invariant characters let then factors through t f since is weyl group invariant t t 1 and so t 2 1 principal series representations of metaplectic groups 17 let p t f r 0 be the character defined by p t t s f for t f let p be the genuine irreducible representation of t f corresponding to p put i s i p ind g b p p lemma 5 2 the assumptions in are satisfied in the case of n fold cover of sl 2 proof we take a system v v of additive characters of kv and let v v be the weil index attached to the quadratic form x 2 y 2 and v let v be the genuine central character of t kv associated to v as described above the tensor product a v v defines a genuine character of the center t k t ak by construction v p for any v p when n is odd v h t n 1 for t k v by definition of v when n is even this is also true since tn is a square in k v and weil index is trivial on squares corollary 5 3 i 0 is irreducible i 1 n and i 1 n are reducible proof theorem implies that p s c 1 q ns 1 q ns 1 1 qns 1 qns 1 for some constant c in particular it has a double zero at s 0 and has a simple pole at s 1 n it follows that i 1 n and i 1 n are reducible by in the appendix i 0 is irreducible since 1 p s has a pole at s 0 5 2 two fold cover of simply connected chevalley group of type ade in this section we assume that g is a simply connected simply laced chevalley group defined over a local field f let g be its nontrivial two fold central extension let t be the metaplectic torus of g generated by h t for t f let zt be the center of t and t 2 be the subgroup of zt generated by h t 2 for t f the following proposition follows directly from proposition 4 2 of 11 proposition 5 4 let s be a subset of vertices of the dynkin diagram of g such that no two vertices in s are adjacent and every vertex not in s is adjacent to an even number of vertices in s then there is no nonempty s if is of type a 2 n e 6 e 8 there is exactly one nonempty s when is of type a 2 n 1 d 2 n 1 e 7 and there are three nonempty s when is of type d 2 n moreover z t t 2 is generated by hs t s h t t f f 2 let us label the dynkin diagram of d 2 n as follows we label the nodes from the very left end to the conjunction by 1 2 2 n 2 respectively and we label the node at the top 18 shiang tang right of the conjunction by 2 n 1 the node at the bottom right of the conjunction by 2 n the the three nonempty s are s 1 1 3 2 n 3 2 n 1 s 2 1 3 2 n 3 2 n s 3 2 n 1 2 n thus every element in zt t 2 is of the form hs 1 t 1 hs 2 t 2 hs 3 t 3 corollary 5 5 when is of type a 2 n e 6 e 8 zt t 2 is trivial when is of type a 2 n 1 d 2 n 1 e 7 zt t 2 is generated by 2 and hs t t f f 2 satisfying hs t hs u t u s h tu when is of type d 2 n zt t 2 is generated by hs 1 t hs 2 t hs 3 t proposition 5 6 let f f 2 4 be a function such that t u t u tu and 1 1 for instance the normalized weil index attached to the quadratic form x 2 y 2 and an additive character f s 1 define hs t t s then is a genuine character of zt proposition 5 7 the weyl group w fixes zt t 2 pointwisely proof it is enough to show that w fixes hs t for any s and t f f 2 that is w 1 hs t w 1 hs t t f f 2 by the definition of s if does not belong to s then it connects to an even number of nodes in s if the number is zero we are done if not then it must connect to two nodes in s say it suffices to check that w 1 h t h t w 1 h t h t the lhs is t c h t t c h t t c c h t h t t c c t c t h t h t t c t h t h t t c c t t h t h t t 1 t t h t h t h t h t finally if s then since w 1 h t w 1 h t 1 h t and is not adjacent to any element in s w 1 fixes hs t for a number field k we take a system v v of additive characters of kv for all places v of k and we let v v be the weil index attached to the quadratic form x 2 y 2 and v principal series representations of metaplectic groups 19 lemma 5 8 13 v is unramified for almost all v and v v x 1 x k let v be the genuine central character associated to v we form the product a v v which defines a character of the center zt ak of t ak lemma 5 9 t k zt ak is generated by h t 2 and hs t s h t where t t k proof any element in the intersection is generated by the elements h u s h t such that u t k u is a square in kv for all v and and t t differ by a square in kv for all s and places v but local global principal implies that any element of k that is a square in each kv must be a square in k proves the lemma corollary 5 10 a zt ak 4 is trivial on t k zt ak hence is a genuine weyl group invariant acc remark 7 by the proof of 5 2 the assumptions of 5 1 are also met if we take the principal series representation to be one induced from the irreducible genuine representation of t ak associated to a 5 3 two fold cover of gln consider the homomorphism i gln f sln 1 f given by mapping a gln f to a 0 0 det a 1 let s ln 1 f denote the nontrivial two fold central extension of sln 1 f and let g ln f denote its pullback which is a nontrivial two fold central extension of gln f because the standard maximal torus of gln f is isomorphic to the standard maximal torus of sln 1 f under the map i their pullbacks are also isomorphic so we may identify the covering torus of g ln f with the covering torus of s ln 1 f which is generated by hi t h i t for 1 i n and t f by 5 5 zt f is 20 shiang tang generated by 2 and hi t 2 for 1 i n t f when n is odd and is generated by hi t 2 and hodd t h 1 t h 3 t hn t for 1 i n t f when n is even globally we may define g ln over the adeles and its covering torus in the same fashion proposition 5 11 there exists a weyl group invariant genuine character zt ak t 2 ak 4 of the center of the covering torus of g ln ak explicitly is given by the isomorphism zt ak t 2 ak 2 when n is odd and is given by hodd t t n 1 2 when n is even proof by 5 10 there is a weyl group invariant genuine acc of the covering torus of s ln 1 ak where weyl group refers to the weyl group of sln 1 pulling back through i we get a genuine acc of the covering torus of g ln ak because the weyl group of gln may be identified with the subgroup of the weyl group of sln 1 that leaves the last entry of the torus invariant the character is invariant under the action of the weyl group of gln the second part follows directly from 5 6 6 appendix the results in this appendix are due to gordan savin 6 1 introduction many of harish chandra s results on intertwining operators and re ducibility of induced representations are contained in his work on the plancherel measure for reductive groups however since harish chandra works with algebraic groups his results are not applicable to non linear central extensions of reductive groups a purpose of this note is to provide simple proofs of some of those results in a manner applicable to non linear groups 6 2 notation let k be a p adic field with residual field of order q fix a uniformizing element and an absolute value on k such that 1 q let g be a reductive group defined over k let a be a maximal split torus and a set of simple roots for the corresponding root system for every we have a standard parabolic subgroup p m n or simply p mn if is fixed in particular p is the minimal parabolic subgroup while maximal parabolic subgroups correspond to such that has one simple root let a a be the connected component of the intersection of kernels of all then a is a split torus contained in the center of m and a x k where x is the co character lattice let w be the weyl group and w w the subgroup generated by simple reflections in let w and w be the longest elements in w and w respectively let w w w then w and p or simply p is the associated parabolic subgroup now assume that p is maximal and p p then w is of order 2 and normalizes m let y z be the lattice of characters of m trivial on the center of g fix a generator of this group of characters then w 1 the image of natural pairing between x and y is mz for some positive integer m let a a be such that a m principal series representations of metaplectic groups 21 6 3 induced representations let p mn be a maximal parabolic subgroup corre sponding to let n be the modular character let e be a supercuspidal representation of m let igp be the normalized induced representation it consists of locally constant functions f g e such that f nmg 1 2 n m m f g for all n n m m and g g if p 6 p then igp n 1 2 n the jacquet functor and i g p is always irreducible henceforth we assume that p p for example this is true for every maximal parabolic in sp 2 n k using the bruhat decomposition g w w w w pwp define a filtration of igp by p invariant subspaces j j igp where j is subspace consisting of functions in igp supported on pw p pw n and j is the subspace of functions supported on g p then j n 1 2 n w by integrating over w n j j n 0 and i g p j n 1 2 n by evaluating functions at the identity of g the representation igp sits in a family of induced representations more precisely for every s c let s e be the twist of by s this representation depends only on qs c in this way we have an algebraic family f of cuspidal representations of m from now on rather than fixing one particular member of f will usually denote any member of f however if is fixed then we can identify f with c or with c if it is more convenient let k be a special maximal compact subgroup of g since g pk by restricting func tions in igp to k we can identify all induced representations in f with x ind k k p e in particular an element f x defines a map 7 f igp for all f we shall call this map a constant section a regular section is a linear combination aifi where ai are regular functions on f and fi are constant sections if f is a constant section such that f is in j or in j for one f then f is in j or in j respectively for all thus we have a corresponding filtration of constant sections y y x we have a rational family of intertwining operators a igp i g p w traditionally defined on an open set in f by the integral a f g n f w ng dn more precisely there exists a rational function a on f such that for every constant section f x 7 a a f is a regular section via the frobenius reciprocity the intertwining operator a corresponds to a p intertwining map igp 1 2 n w which when restricted to j is given by the integral over w n and is therefore non zero we view as a rational map 7 homc x e the analytic behaviour of a and is the same in particular 1 for every constant section f x the map 7 a f e is regular 2 for every constant section f y the map 7 f e is regular 22 shiang tang 3 for every there is f y such that f 6 0 lemma 6 1 we have 1 for every constant section f y the map 7 f e is regular 2 if is not isomorphic to w which is always true if is not unitary then for every constant section f x the map 7 f e is regular at proof 1 assume that when applied to all sections in y has a pole of maximal order n at using as a basepoint we identify the family f with c then sn defines a non zero p intertwining map from j j to 1 2 n w but there is no such map since j j n 0 this is a contradiction 2 similarly if when applied to all sections in x has a pole of order n at then sn defines a non zero p intertwining map from igp j to 1 2 n w since igp j n 1 2 n we obtain an isomorphism of and w this is a contradiction the lemma is proved since igp is irreducible for a generic f the composition a w a is a nec essarily equal to 1 1 x for a rational function called plancherel measure the following is contained in casselman s notes proposition 6 2 we have 1 if is not unitary then igp is reducible iff 1 0 2 if is unitary and is not isomorphic to w then igp is irreducible proof 1 assume that igp reduces we claim that i g p has a non split composition series of length 2 let v be an irreducible submodule then by the frobenius reciprocity 1 2 n must be a quotient of v since is not isomorphic to w 1 2 n appears with multiplicity one in igp n this shows that v is unique submodule v n 1 2 n and v n 1 2 n w where v igp v it follows from the frobenius reciprocity that v is a submodule of igp w and v is a quotient thus a w a 0 conversely since a and a w are defined and non zero 1 0 must imply that igp and i g p w both reduce 2 if igp is reducible then arguing as in 1 it has a unique submodule and a unique quotient but igp is unitary and thus semisimple this is a contradiction assume that is unitary and that is isomorphic to w let tw w be a map intertwining the two actions of m let s s where s c let i s be the induced representation of g we have an intertwining map a s igp s i g p s defined by the integral a s f g tw n f w ng dn let 1 s be the function obtained by composing a s and a s the following is not contained in casselman s notes proposition 6 3 assume that is unitary and that is isomorphic to w then the following three are equivalent 1 igp is irreducible principal series representations of metaplectic groups 23 2 the exact sequence 0 1 2 n i g p n 1 2 n 0 does not split 3 the function 1 s has a pole necessarily of order 2 at s 0 proof since igp is unitary it is irreducible if and only if homg i g p i g p c by the frobenius reciprocity homg i g p i g p homm i g p 1 2 n thus i g p is irre ducible if and only if igp n does not split this proves the equivalence of 1 and 2 if is regular at then it defines a splitting of the exact sequence and igp reduces in order to finish we need to show that if 1 has a pole at then it is of order 2 and igp n does not split let a be the element in the center of m defined in the previous section let be the central character of let s 7 fs i g p s be a constant section then f s fs 1 a 1 2 n a a s s a fs is a regular section such that f s j s for all s in particular by lemma 6 1 s 7 f s is regular if s 6 0 but s is sufficiently small then is defined on the whole igp s hence f s fs q 2 ms fs 1 q 2 ms fs solving for fs we see that can have the pole of order at most one at s 0 and that happens if and only if f 0 6 0 for some constant section fs now we can finish easily assume that has a pole at s 0 we want to show that igp n does not split if it splits then extends to igp let be an extension then for every constant section fs the above computation shows f 0 1 q 0 f 0 0 a contradiction thus we have seen that the intertwining operator a can have a pole of order at most one at igp and if it does then igp is irreducible it follows that the residue of a acts on i g p as multiplication by a non zero scalar so 1 has a double pole corollary 6 4 assume that is unitary is isomorphic to w and igp reduces nec essarily into two non isomorphic summands then 0 1 6 0 and a 0 acts on the two summands by different scalars 0 1 2 proof we know that a 0 is well defined and non zero since is non zero on j let 1 and 2 be the eigenvalues of a 0 on the two summands since is not given by evaluation of functions at identity the operator a 0 is not a multiple of the identity operator thus 1 6 2 since a 0 2 1 the eigenvalues must be non zero and of opposite signs remark if g is a central extension of g by a group of n th roots of 1 then all of the above arguments go through provided that we replace a by an inverse image in g of an
