generalized cusps in real projective manifolds classification samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner abstract a generalized cusp c is diffeomorphic to 0 times a closed euclidean manifold geometrically c is the quotient of a properly convex domain in rpn by a lattice in one of a family of affine groups g parameterized by a point in the dual closed weyl chamber for sl n 1 r and determines the cusp up to equivalence these affine groups correspond to certain fibered geometries each of which is a bundle over an open simplex with fiber a horoball in hyperbolic space and the lattices are classified by certain bieberbach groups plus some auxiliary data the cusp has finite busemann measure if and only if g contains unipotent elements there is a natural underlying euclidean structure on c unrelated to the hilbert metric a generalized cusp is a properly convex projective manifold c where rpn is a properly convex set and pgl n 1 r is a virtually abelian discrete group that preserves we also require that c is compact and strictly convex contains no line segment and that there is a diffeomorphism h 0 c c see definition 3 1 a an example is a cusp in a hyperbolic manifold that is the quotient of a closed horoball it follows from 16 that every generalized cusp in a strictly convex manifold of finite volume is equivalent to a standard cusp i e a cusp in a hyperbolic manifold a generalized cusp is homogeneous if pgl the group of projective transformations that preserves acts transitively on it was shown in 17 that every generalized cusp is equivalent to a homogeneous one and that if the holonomy of a generalized cusp contains no hyperbolic elements then it is equivalent to a standard cusp furthermore by 17 it follows that generalized cusps often occur as ends of properly convex manifolds obtained by deforming finite volume hyperbolic manifolds here is an outline of the main new results of this paper given hom rn r with e 1 e 2 en 0 there is a properly convex domain rpn see definition 1 3 for 6 0 the cusp lie group g pgl and for 0 it is the subgroup of non hyperbolic elements in each case g acts transitively on a cusp is the quotient of by a lattice in g two generalized cusps c and c are equivalent if there is a generalized cusp c and projective embeddings that are also homotopy equivalences of c into both c and c and they are all diffeomorphic theorem 0 1 uniformization every generalized cusp is equivalent to a cusp the geometry of a cusp depends on the type t t which is the number of i with ei 6 0 and the unipotent rank u max n t 1 0 is the dimension of the unipotent subgroup of g the ideal boundary of is cl min n 1 t there is a unique supporting hyperplane rpn 1 to that contains so a rp n rpn 1 is the unique affine patch in which is properly embedded hence has a well defined affine structure and cusps inherit a unique affine structure that is a stiffening of the projective structure the non ideal or manifold boundary of is a smooth strictly convex hypersurface int that is properly embedded in a since is convex the frontier fr cl sn 1 and fr t types 0 and n are familiar for type 0 then fr 0 is a round sphere and 0 is a single point thus 0 may be projectively identified with a closed horoball in the projective model date april 30 2019 1 ar x iv 1 71 0 03 13 2 v 2 m at h g t 2 8 a pr 2 01 9 2 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner of hyperbolic space hn and also with clhn then hn and moreover g 0 is isomorphic to the subgroup of isom hn consisting of parabolics and elliptics that fix whence these generalized cusps are standard at the other extreme when t n there is an n simplex n rpn and int n and is a properly embedded convex smooth hypersurface that separates int into two components one of which is int then n 1 is a face of n moreover g pgl n and thus contains a finite index subgroup that is diagonalizable over the reals when 0 t n there is an affine projection int t with fibers that are projectively equivalent to horoballs in hu 1 in this case t in fact one can regard a generalized cusp as a kind of fiber product of a diagonalizable cusp of dimension t and a standard cusp of dimension 1 u and also as a deformation of a standard cusp where the boundary at infinity is expanded out into a simplex in particular this results in a flat simplex t in the ideal boundary of any domain covering a manifold that contains generalized cusps of type t 0 in the sense of klein geometries g is a subgeometry of euclidean geometry the orbits of g form a codimension 1 foliation and the leaves are called horospheres there is a 1 parameter group called the radial flow that centralizes g and the orbits are orthogonal to the horospheres these two foliations give a natural product structure on a generalized cusp the following is more easily understood after first reading section 6 about surfaces then section 7 about 3 manifolds the next goal is to classify cusps up to equivalence for this it is useful to introduce marked cusps and marked lattices see section 4 for the definition and more discussion a rank 2 cusp in a hyperbolic 3 manifold is determined by a cusp shape which is a euclidean torus defined up to similarity this shape is usually described by a complex number x iy with y 0 that uniquely determines a marked cusp unmarked cusps are described by the modular surface h 2 psl 2 z more generally a maximal rank cusp in a hyperbolic n manifold is determined by a lattice in isom en 1 up to conjugacy and rescaling we extend this result by showing when 6 0 that a generalized cusp of dimension n with holonomy in g is determined by a pair a o consisting of the conjugacy class of a lattice isom en 1 and an anisotropy parameter which we now describe the second fundamental form on a is conformally equivalent to a euclidean metric that is preserved by the action of g this identifies g with a subgroup of isom en 1 and g t o o is the semi direct product of the translation subgroup t rn 1 and a closed subgroup o o n 1 that fixes some point p in see theorem 1 45 the euclidean structure identifies with a lattice in isom en 1 this lattice is unique up to conjugation by an element of o the anisotropy parameter is a left coset a o in o n that determines the o conjugacy class the group o is computed in proposition 1 44 given a lie group g the set of g conjugacy classes of marked lattices in g is denoted t g define t isom en 1 t isom en 1 to be the subset of conjugacy classes of marked eu clidean lattices with rotational part of the holonomy up to conjugacy in o the classification of generalized cusps up to equivalence is completed by theorem 0 2 classification i if and are lattices in g tfae a and are equivalent generalized cusps b and are conjugate in pgl n 1 r c and are conjugate in pgl ii a lattice in g is conjugate in pgl n 1 r into g iff g is conjugate to g iii g is conjugate in pgl n 1 r to g iff t for some t 0 iv pgl g when 6 0 generalized cusps 3 v when 6 0 the map t isom en 1 o n 1 o t g defined in 4 2 is a bijection one might view ii in the context of super rigidity an embedding of a lattice determines an embedding of the lie group that contains it throughout this paper we repeatedly stumble over two exceptional cases a generalized cusp with 0 is projectively equivalent to a cusp in a hyperbolic manifold this is the only case when pgl is strictly larger than g and occurs because there are elements of pgl 0 isom hn that permute horospheres these elements are hyperbolic isometries of hn that fix this accounts for the fact that the equivalence class of a cusp in a hyperbolic manifold is determined by the similarity class pgl conjugacy class of the lattice rather than the g conjugacy class as in every other case the other exceptional case is the diagonalizable case t n and in this case the radial flow is hyperbolic instead of parabolic fortunately both these exceptional cases are easy to understand but tend to require proofs that consider various cases let cn denote the set of equivalence classes of generalized cusps of dimension n let modn denote the disjoint union over all with e 1 1 of conjugacy classes of unmarked lattice in g union lattices in g 0 isom en 1 up to conjugacy and scaling every non standard generalized cusp is equivalent to one given by a lattice in g with e 1 1 that is unique up to conjugacy in g giving corollary 0 3 cusps classified by lattices there is a bijection f modn cn defined for modn by f when is a lattice in g corollary 0 4 standard parabolics suppose m is a properly convex n manifold such that every end of m is a generalized cusp if a and d is the hilbert metric on and if inf d x a x x 0 then a is the holonomy of an element of 1 c for some generalized cusp c m and a is conjugate in pgl n 1 r to a parabolic in po n 1 generalized cusps are modeled on the geometries g and these are all isomorphic to subgeometries of euclidean geometry see corollary 1 60 in fact there is a natural euclidean metric theorem 0 5 underlying euclidean structure there is a metric on that is preserved by g and by the radial flow and is isometric to rn 1 0 with the usual euclidean metric the restriction of to is conformally equivalent to the second fundamental form of in a theorem 0 5 implies a generalized cusp has an underlying euclidean structure and also an un derlying hyperbolic structure see theorem 3 19 it is a well known that if c is a maximal rank cusp in a hyperbolic manifold m then c has finite hyperbolic volume for properly convex manifolds there is a natural notion of volume see section 5 for details theorem 0 6 parabolic finite vol suppose c is a generalized cusp in the interior a properly convex manifold m and is conjugate into g then c has finite volume in m with respect to the hausdorff measure induced by the hilbert metric on m iff u 0 iff g contains a parabolic element the original definition 17 of generalized cusp differs from the one in the introduction by replacing the word abelian by nilpotent to avoid confusion we have decided to call the generalized cusps of 16 g cusps see definition 3 1 for the precise definition the reason nilpotent was used originally is the connection between cusps and the margulis lemma a consequence of the analysis in this paper is that these definitions are equivalent theorem 0 7 nilpotent abelian suppose c is a properly convex manifold and c c 0 and c is compact and strictly convex and 1 c is virtually nilpotent then c is a generalized cusp and 1 c is virtually abelian 4 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner another aspect of the definition of generalized cusp is that c is compact in the theory of kleinian groups rank 1 cusps are important these are diffeomorphic to a 0 where a is a non compact annulus for hyperbolic manifolds of higher dimensions there are more possibilities however the fundamental group of such a cusp is always virtually abelian this is not the case for properly convex manifolds in 14 there is an example of a strictly convex manifold with unipotent parabolic holonomy and with fundamental group the integer heisenberg group there might to be a nice theory of properly convex manifolds c c 0 with 1 c virtually nilpotent and c strictly convex but without requiring c to be compact the definition of the term generalized cusp was the end result of a lot of experimentation with definitions and was modified as more was discovered about their nature in retrospect it turns out they are all deformations of cusps in hyperbolic manifolds this theme will be developed in a subsequent paper choi 11 12 has studied certain kinds of ends of projective manifolds and generalized cusps in this paper correspond to some lens type ends and quasi joined ends

omits at least 2 points the boundary is used in the sense of manifolds int and is usually distinct from the frontier which is fr cl cl int a properly convex domain has strictly convex boundary if contains no line segment an affine patch is the complement of a projective hyperplane if there is a unique supporting hyperplane to at p fr then p is a c 1 point a geometry is a pair x g where g is a subgroup of the group of homeomorphisms of x onto itself in this section we describe a family of geometries parameterized by points in the closed dual weyl chamber 1 1 a hom rn r i ei 1 2 n 0 for each

that c is compact in the theory of kleinian groups rank 1 cusps are important these are diffeomorphic to a 0 where a is a non compact annulus for hyperbolic manifolds of higher dimensions there are more possibilites however the fundamental group of such a cusp is always virtually abelian this is not the case for properly convex manifolds in 6 there is an example of a strictly convex manifold

convex but without requiring c to be compact the definition of the term generalized cusp was the end result of a lot of experimentation with definitions and was modified as more was discovered about their nature in retrospect it turns out they are all deformations of cusps in hyperbolic manifolds this theme will be developed in a subsequent paper 1 the geometry of cusps a geometry is a pair g x where g is a subgroup of the group of homeomorphisms of x onto itself in this section we describe a family of geometries parameterized by points in the closed dual weyl chamber 1 a hom rn r i ei 1 2 n 0 for each a there is a closed convex subset rn and a lie subgroup g of aff rn that preserves and acts transitively on the pair g is called geometry it is isomorphic to a subgeometry of euclidean geometry 1 22 given a the semisimple rank r r is defined by ei 0 i r and the unipotent or parabolic rank is p p n r define v v rr rp the horofunction h v r is defined by 2 h x 1 xn xr 1 r i 1 i log xi 1 2 n i r 2 x 2 i if r n n i 1 i 1 n i 1 i log xi if r n the domain h 1 0 rn has boundary h 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 y 1 x y log x y x 2 figure 1 a projective view of 2 dimensional generalized cusp domains the domains pictured in figure 1 are projective and the affine equations for are obtained by dehomogenizing with respect to a good choice of coordinates made explicit later we denote the derivative by d figure 1 a projective view of some 2 dimensional domains proposition 1 5 is a closed unbounded convex subset of rn and a properly convex subset of rpn the horospheres ht are smooth strictly convex hypersurfaces that foliate v and h 0 proof since h is a smooth submersion ht are smooth hypersurfaces that foliate v and is a closed submanifold of rn with boundary h 0 moreover is unbounded because h is a decreasing function of xs where s max t 1 the second derivative of x 2 and of log x are both positive on v so the second derivative d 2 h is positive semi definite on v for t n it has nullity 1 given by the xt 1 direction when t n it is positive definite the tangent space toht is t ht kerdh which does not contain the xt 1 direction thus d 2 h restricted to t ht is positive definite hence ht is strictly convex suppose is a line segment with endpoints a b set f h then f 0 so f attains its maximum at an endpoint thus f max f a f b and f a f b 0 since a b thus f 0 so and is convex suppose is a complete affine line contained in then is contained in rt rn t so xi is constant along for i t thus t n and h c 1 t c 2 t 2 where t is an affine coordinate on but implies this function is nowhere positive a contradiction hence contains no complete affine line and is thus properly convex remarks 1 6 a if i i i 1 then h is convex iff either i i 0 or i i 0 b it follows from lemma 1 25 and the discussion in section 3 of 16 that the ht are horospheres in the sense of busemann and from 1 15 that they are also algebraic horospheres as defined in 16 definition 1 7 the cusp lie group is the subgroup g g pgl n 1 r that preserves each horosphere a cusp is c where g is a torsion free lattice the condition that g preserves each horosphere is equivalent to preserving the horofunction thus g pgl it follows from propostion 1 5 that a cusp is a properly convex manifold the torsion free hypothesis on is strictly a matter of convenience if is a lattice in g that contains torsion then c is an orbifold 1 1 the radial flow the unipotent rank is u max n 1 t 0 and the rank r is defined by r u n 1 then r min t n 1 a more conceptual interpretation of r and u is given by equation 1 42 it is convenient to use coordinates on v given by 1 8 x z y v rr r ru if t n rr r ru if t n when t 0 the x coordinate is empty and when t n 1 then u 0 so the y coordinate is empty the z coordinate is called the vertical direction this terminology is motivated by regarding the horospheres as graphs of functions see equation 1 19 the y coordinate is called the parabolic direction and the x coordinate is called the hyperbolic direction see equation 1 33 definition 1 9 the basepoint of is b b e 1 et rn 6 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner thus for t 0 the basepoint is b 0 rn the basepoint satisfies h b 0 so b when t n then b x 0 z 0 y 0 where x 0 1 1 rr and the remaining coordinates are 0 when t n then b 1 1 in projective coordinates the basepoint is b en 1 rpn define u u rr ru radial projection is the map v u given by 1 10 x z y x y if t n x z y z if t n definition 1 11 the radial flow pgl n 1 r is the 1 parameter subgroup that acts on v by 1 12 t x z y x z y t x z t y if t n e t x z y if t n in the first case the radial flow is called parabolic and in the second case it is hyperbolic this terminology agrees with that of 17 the orbit of a point is called a flowline each flowline maps to one point under radial projection when t n flowlines are vertical lines and when t n they are open rays that limit on 0 rn the reason for the name radial flow is that this group acts on rpn and there is a point rpn called the center of the radial flow with the property that if a point rpn is not fixed by the flow then the orbit of is contained in the projective line containing and moreover t as t the center is 1 13 et 1 if t n then rpn 1 corresponds to the z axis and 0 rn when t n observe that the radial flow has the following equivariance property 1 14 h t x h x t this equation would need to be modified without the first factor in the definition of h see 1 4 when t n it follows that the radial flow permutes the level sets of the horofunction and hence permutes the horospheres and 1 15 ht t definition 1 16 a product structure on a manifold m is a pair of transverse foliations on m determined by a diffeomorphism p q m there is a diffeomorphism f 0 given by f x t t x this defines a product structure on with a foliation by horospheres and a transverse foliation by half flowlines if c is a cusp then preserves this product structure so it covers a product structure on c the image in c of a horosphere is called a horomanifold the set is backwards invariant which means that t for all t 0 and is the backwards orbit of t 0 t for t n it is convenient to introduce t rt r given by 1 17 t x x 0 0 define og r r by 1 18 og x 0 if x 0 log x if x 0 generalized cusps 7 and extend this to a map og rr rr by applying og componentwise then define f f u r by 1 19 f x y t og x y 2 2 if t n n 1 i 1 x i n i if t n the map f f u given by 1 20 f x y x f x y y is the inverse of the restriction of vertical projection u so is the graph z f x y of f and x z y z f x y is the supergraph of f from definition 1 3 when t n the horofunction is expressed more compactly as 1 21 h x z y z f x y but for t n this does not work 1 2 the ideal boundary in what follows is omitted from the notation we describe the closure in rpn identify affine space rn with an affine patch in projective space rpn by identifying x z y in rn with x z y 1 in rpn then 1 22 x z y 1 z f x y x rr rpn observe that rn the points at infinity are rpn 1 rpn rn and 1 23 t with rpn 1 the set is called the ideal boundary or the boundary at infinity of see 19 definition 1 17 the non ideal boundary or just boundary of is rn thus t lemma 1 24 is the simplex of dimension r r x 1 xr 1 0 0 xi 0 proof from equation 1 22 consists of all the points that are the limit of a sequence of points x z y 1 with x z y for which z f x y first assume t n and so t r we claim that y x z y 0 along the sequence if eventually t og x y 2 4 then by equation 1 19 it follows that z y 2 4 and since y y 2 0 as y it follows that y z 0 otherwise we may take a subsequence so t og x y 2 4 since j 0 for all j r this means for some i r the coordinate xi of x is positive and larger than some fixed multiple of exp y hence y xi 0 this proves the claim hence r from 1 19 we see that f etx 0 0 for large t then by equation 1 22 lim t etx etz 0 1 z 0 x rr r which proves the result for t n when t n then r n 1 and v n 1 on the other hand if v int n 1 then v limt tx tz 1 where x rn 1 and z r from the definition of f x see equation 1 19 it is easy to check when t is large that tz f tx hence tx tz and so int n 1 since is closed it follows that n 1 lemma 1 25 every point in the relative interior of is a c 1 point and a rpn 1 is the unique hyperplane in rp n that contains and is disjoint from b a rpn rpn 1 is the unique affine patch that contains as a closed subset c pgl aff rn 8 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner proof clearly a implies b and c for a the result follows from the following picture that we will establish near a point q int the frontier fr looks like a flat open set in r product a hypersurface in rn r that is c 1 close to an ellipsoid and is thus c 1 now a is clear for r n 1 it is also clear in the case t 0 since cl is a round ball and q is a single c 1 point thus we may suppose that u 1 and r t 0 we use coordinates a y w rr 1 ru r rn 1 where a x z rr r in the coordinates above thus the affine patch used above is a y 1 and rpn 1 is a y 0 given q int then q a 0 0 with a a 1 ar 1 rr 1 by lemma 1 24 let p p r a ru r rpn then p rpu 1 and p q moreover w p rn is the subset of where the x z coordinate is z a for some z we may scale a so that ar 1 1 then z a za 1 zar z by equation 1 3 r a ru is given by 1 26 0 h za 1 zar z y z r i 1 i log zai y 2 2 this may be rewritten as 1 27 z log z y 2 2 i i log ai near q then z is large and w is c 0 close to the ellipsoid z y 2 2 in rpu 1 we now show it is c 1 close by changing to a different affine patch using y z 1 yz 1 1 z 1 u 1 v then q is the point u v 0 0 ru 1 and u ru and v r satisfy 1 28 v 1 log v 1 v 1 u 2 2 which can be expressed as f v u 2 2 where f v v v 2 log v v 2 for v 6 0 there is a c 1 extension of f given by f 0 0 then f 0 1 so by the inverse function theorem near 0 ru r we have v f 1 u 2 2 is c 1 close to v u 2 2 at q in particular q is a c 1 point of clw it is interesting that f v as v 0 let h rpn 1 be a supporting hyperplane to fr at q then since q is a c 1 point of cl w in p it follows that h contains q p rpn 1 furthermore dimq dimp 1 u since q int and h is a supporting hyperplane it follows that h contains by lemma 1 24 dim r and hence dim dimq r u n 1 dimh since and q are transverse in h it follows that h is the unique hyperplane that contains q the next result implies that a generalized cusp has a natural affine structure that is a stiffening of the projective structure proposition 1 29 let h h and let be the center of let h and be the corresponding objects for suppose that p pgl n 1 r and p then a t t b p c p aff rn d p p 1 e c 0 t ct p t p 1 f h p c h g p sends the product structure of to that of proof clearly p by lemma 1 24 is a simplex of dimension r min t n 1 and it follows that if t n 2 then t t it remains to distinguish t n 1 from t n in a projectively invariant way generalized cusps 9 claim if t n 1 then there is a unique minimal closed n simplex rpn such that and is a face of if and only if t n in the case t n then is the closure in rpn of rn rn minimality and uniqueness follows from the fact that is asymptotic in rn to near rp n 1 consider a ray 0 rn then h t as t thus t for t large if 6 and contains and p then there is such a ray in unless thus any simplex that contains also contains in the case t n 1 the analysis below shows that there is a projective plane h rp 2 such that h looks like 1 0 in figure 1 this implies no such exists which proves the claim and a by equation 1 13 et 1 when t n then t n and uniqueness of implies p observe that c en 1 is the unique vertex of that is not in thus p in this case when t 0 then e 1 and so b follows in this case for b this leaves the case 0 t n then et 1 rpn 1 by lemma 1 24 the vertices of are es with 1 s t 1 given s t let h rp 2 be any projective plane that contains the vertices et 1 and es of r and also some point v 1 vn 1 the intersection of h with the affine patch rn is the affine subspace v es et 1 v 1 vn using definition 1 3 the restriction of h h to v is f x y h xes y et 1 v y s log x vs c where c is a constant independent of x and y that depends on v the curve v is given by f x y 0 the affine change of coordinates x y x vs sy c maps this curve to y log x it follows that on the curve h the point es is c 1 and et 1 is not c 1 see the middle domain in figure 1 thus the center et 1 is a vertex of that is distinguished in a projectively invariant way from every other vertex es of this completes the proof of b by lemma 1 25 c p preserves rpn 1 proving c the radial flow is characterized as the one parameter subgroup pgl that fixes every point in the stationary hyperplane preserves every line containing the center and no non trivial element fixes any other point this and b implies d every automorphism of r is multiplication by some c 6 0 since is backward invariant c 0 which proves e by equation 1 14 h p c h which proves f the level sets of h gives the foliation by horospheres so p preserves this foliation similarly p preserves the orbits of points which are the flowlines giving g 1 3 the structure of g theorem 1 45 gives a decomposition of the group g t o o corresponding to the decomposition isom rn rn o o n into translation and orthogonal subgroups we begin by describing the translation subgroup t recall the standard identification of the affine group aff rn with the subgroup a v 0 1 a gl n r v rn gl n 1 r the affine action on rn is realized by the embedding rn rn 1 given by a 7 a 1 our next task is to define a subgroup of g called the translation subgroup t rn 1 that acts simply transitively on we first define the enlarged translation group tt rn that acts simply transitively on v rt rn t then t ker for a certain homomorphism tt r derived from the enlarged translation group is the direct sum of the translation group and the radial flow tt t 10 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner the enlarged translation group tt has lie algebra tt that is the image of the map t rn gl n 1 r given by 1 30 t x z y diag x 0 0 0 y t z 0 0 y 0 0 0 here x rr and z r and y ru except when u 0 there is no y and when t n there is no z and the bottom right block is 0 it is easy to check that all lie brackets in tt are 0 and so tt is an abelian lie subalgebra and tt rn as a lie group define mt x z y exp t x z y then tt consists of all matrices 1 31 mt x z y exp diag x 0 0 1 y t z y 2 2 0 iu y 0 0 1 definition 1 32 the translation group t t is the kernel of the homomorphism tt r defined for t n by mt x z y t x z and for t n by mn x i 1 x for t n the translation group t consists of the matrices mt x y z given by equation 1 31 for which z t x it will occasionally be convenient to write the translation group as the image of a linear map instead of as the kernel of a linear map for t n the translation group t is the image of m r r ru gl n 1 r given by 1 33 m x y exp diag x 0 0 1 y t y 2 2 t x 0 iu y 0 0 1 and for t n the translation group t is the image of m ker gl n 1 r by 1 34 m x exp diag x 0 0 1 it is worth pointing out that with this formalism the case t n 1 means u 0 and gives 1 35 m x y exp diag x 0 0 1 t x 0 1 lemma 1 36 tt acts simply transitively on v rt rn t and a h mt x z y h mt x z y b t is the the subgroup of tt that preserves h c t preserves the foliation of v by horospheres d t preserves the transverse foliation by flowlines proof it is clear the action is simply transitive and that a implies both b and c and that d holds we first prove a in the case t n from equation 1 21 h x z y z t og x y 2 2 and mt x z y x z y t exp x 1 x 1 exp xr xr z y y z y 2 2 y 1 y 1 yu yu t generalized cusps 11 so h mt x z y x z y t z y y z y 2 2 t og exp x 1 x 1 exp xr xr y y 2 2 z z t x og x y 2 2 z t x z t og x y 2 2 mt x z y h x z y a similar but simpler argument applies when t n by omitting the y and z coordinates lemma 1 37 t g and t acts simply transitively on proof by equations 1 33 and 1 31 t is the subgroup of tt given by z t x it follows from lemma 1 36 b that t is the subgroup of tt that preserves the horofunction hence t g simple transitivity on also follows from lemma 1 36 the following is from 16 if is open and properly convex and a pgl the displacement distance of a is 1 38 a inf d x ax x where d is the hilbert metric on then a is called hyperbolic if a 0 and elliptic if a fixes a point in otherwise it is called parabolic if a does not fix any point in and a 0 moreover a 0 if and only if all eigenvalues of a have the same modulus a parabolic a pgl n 1 r is called standard if it is conjugate into po n 1 isom hn this is equivalent to there are t 6 0 such that a is conjugate in gl n 1 r into 1 39 1 t t 2 2 0 1 t 0 1 1 o n 2 standard parabolics have a jordan block of size 3 it follows from equation 1 33 that lemma 1 40 the parabolic subgroup p t consists of all unipotent elements of t moreover p m 0 y y ru and non trivial elements are standard standard parabolics let t 1 t 2 t where t 1 is the subgroup of diagonalizable elements and t 2 is the subgroup of elements for which every jordan block has size at most 2 this description is invariant under conjugacy and 1 41 t 1 t 1 m x 0 x ker r t 2 t 2 m x 0 x rr then t p t 2 and dimt 2 1 dimt 1 if 0 t n non trivial elements of t 2 are hyperbolic a weight is a homomorphism t r such that det a i 0 for all a t let w be the set of such weights here are conceptual descriptions of u r and t 1 42 u dimp r dimt 2 t w 1 thus r is the dimension of the subgroup of hyperbolics in the translation group u the dimension of the unipotent parabolic subgroup dimt u r n 1 definition 1 43 o is the subgroup of g that fixes the basepoint b when 0 the case of a cusp in hn then o o n 1 is the subgroup of o n aff rn that fixes e 1 at the other extreme when t n and all the coordinates of are distinct then o is trivial the general case is 12 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner proposition 1 44 suppose a has type t t let e 1 en 1 be the standard basis of rn 1 and s gl t r be the subgroup that permutes e 1 et and preserves the vector t i 1 iei then o is equal to the subgroup o aff rn gl n 1 r given by t n 1 t n 1 t n o s 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 o u 0 0 0 0 1 s 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 s 0 0 1 proof it is easy to check that o fixes the basepoint and preserves the horofunction h h so o o for the converse pgl aff rn so o aff rn it is easy to check the result when t n so assume t n from equation 1 4 the horofunction h rt rn t r is h x z y t og x z y 2 2 if o then h h given a unit vector u x z y rr r ru there is an affine line u in rn containing the basepoint that is the image of the map u t b t u the horofunction is only defined on the subset of this line in v this gives a function f fu iu r defined on some maximal interval iu r by fu t h u t tz t 2 y 2 2 t i 1 i log 1 txi here x x 1 xt we distinguish two classes of line u according to the behaviour of f the function f is defined on iu r iff x 0 and it is defined on 0 iu and grows logarithmically as t iff z y 0 and each coordinate of x is non negative since is affine it preserves the smallest affine subspace that contains all the lines of a given type since fixes the basepoint b and preserves the type of lines preserves the affine subspaces p b e 1 et and q b et 1 en notice that p e 1 et by lemmas 1 24 and 1 29 preserves the simplex spanned by the ideal boundary and the center of the radial flow of this simplex is exactly unless t n in which case it is larger it follows that permutes the vertices ei 1 i t 1 of this simplex on p we have h x 1 e 1 xtet i log xi since p preserves h it follows that must preserve p thus the first t columns of are as shown in o the only u for which fu is linear is when u et 1 since fixes the basepoint and preserves h it follows that maps the line et 1 to itself by the identity this gives column t 1 in o finally fu is a quadratic polynomial with a minimum of 0 at the basepoint exactly when x 0 and z 0 so u et 2 en on this subspace h y 1 et 2 yuen y 2 2 since preserves this function the columns t 2 to n of in o those that contain o u are as shown since is affine and fixes the basepoint the last column is as shown in o the result now follows a morphism between two geometries g x and h y is a homomorphism g h and an immersion f x y such that g g x x f g x g fx if f and are both inclusions we say g x is a subgeometry of h y theorem 1 45 g t oo and a t rn 1 acts simply transitively on b o is the stabilizer of a point in c o is a maximal compact subgroup of g d g is isomorphic to a subgeometry of isom en 1 en 1 e t is the unique lie subgroup of g isomorphic to rn 1 generalized cusps 13 f t is the subgroup of g of elements all of whose eigenvalues are positive proof a and b follow from lemma 1 37 and definition 1 43 by proposition 1 44 o is compact giving part of c by a we may regard the orbit map t given by g g b as an identification then o acts smoothly on t fixing the identity the derivative of this action acts linearly on the lie algebra of t as a compact group thus there is an inner product on the lie algebra of t that is preserved by this action using left translation gives a flat riemannian metric on t which is therefore isometric to en 1 then conjugates the action of g on into a subgroup of isom en 1 this proves d clearly d implies the maximality claim in c as well as e and also implies that g is an internal semidirect product as claimed a euclidean isometry is conjugate by a translation to the composition of an orthogonal element and a translation that commute it follows by d that g g is conjugate to a t with t t and a o and a t t a by definition all eigenvalues of elements of t are positive since a and t commute the eigenvalues of a t are products of eigenvalues of a and of t thus if all the eigenvalue of g are positive then all those of a are positive an element of the orthogonal group with all eigenvalues positive is trivial which proves f corollary 1 46 every parabolic in g gl n 1 r is conjugate into o n 1 proof an element g g is parabolic iff all eigenvalues of g have modulus 1 and g is not conjugate into o n 1 such g is conjugate to a t with a o and 1 6 t t and a t t a since the eignevalues of t are all positive they are all 1 so t p thus g is a standard parabolic from equation 1 12 the radial flow gl n 1 r is given by 1 47 t n t n s exp 0 t t 0 0 0 0 s 0 0 n t n t 0 exp s in n 0 0 0 observe that the one parameter group is a subgroup of tt and tt t in particular t t commutes with the radial flow so t sends radial flows lines to radial flow lines thus t induces an action on the space of flowlines in v and radial projection identifies this space with u the action of t on u is affine and given by omitting row and column t 1 to give exp diag x 0 0 0 iu y 0 0 1 y ru with both y and iu interpreted as empty for u 0 this happens when r n 1 in the case t n then x rr and when t n then x ker t from this it follows that lemma 1 48 under radial projection v u the action of t on v is semi conjugate to a simply transitive affine action of t on u that is topologically conjugate to the action of rn 1 on itself by translation proof the second conclusion follows by conjugating with the map rr ru rn 1 given by x y 7 og x y 1 4 domains preserved by t is not the only properly convex domain preserved by t t if b aff rn normalizes t then t also preserves b however the cusp is affinely equivalent to b when t is diagonal there is a different class of examples given by gluing two copies of along int and then deleting one boundary component 14 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner definition 1 49 e t gl n 1 r is the the group of all diagonal matrices with i i 1 for i t t and i i 1 for i t moreover e t is the subgroup of e t that normalizes g lemma 1 50 e t centralizes t and e t consists of all e t such that k k j j whenever k j furthermore e t also centralizes g proof the first statement easily follows from the presentation of t see equations 1 34 and 1 33 by proposition 1 44 we may regard s and o u as subgroups of aff rn gl n 1 r acting on rn it is easy to check that e t centralizes o u an element a s permutes the xi coordinates for 1 i t and e t assigns a sign to each of these coordinates so that 1 51 a j k j j k kaj k is a signed permutation thus e t if and only if k k j j whenever k j moreover in this case commutes with a for 1 i t let hi rpn be the hyperplane xi 0 then x rpn rpn 1 ihi has 2 t components each affinely equivalent to v it is easy to check that lemma 1 52 e t acts simply transitively on the components of x and tt e t acts simply transitively on x it follows that the only projective hyperplanes that are preserved by t are rpn 1 and the hyperplanes hi if g e t then g is called a standard domain since g normalizes t this domain is preserved by t since t s if t s it follows that standard domains intersect if and only if one contains the other a properly convex set u u 0 that is preserved by the action of t is called reducible if there is a projective hyperplane h that is preserved by t and h u 6 otherwise u is irreducible if such h exists then h separates u into two properly convex sets that are preserved by t it follows from the above that if u is irreducible then u is contained in some component of x lemma 1 53 if u rpn is an irreducible properly convex set that is preserved by t and u u 0 then u is a standard domain moreover there is a unique g e t such that u g proof there is unique e t such that u v if x u then there is h tt such that h x since t acts simply transitively on and is the subgroup of tt that preserves it follows there is a unique h with this property and g h when t t n let i e t be the map that restricts to be the affine map of rn given by x 7 x in the above notation ii i 1 for all 1 i n and in 1 n 1 1 in what follows let v v and i v be standard domains and observe that n 1 then w t int t int rpn is called an extended domain lemma 1 54 the extended domain w is properly convex preserved by g and w w 0 proof at each point x frw t t there is a supporting hyperplane h if x then h is the projectivization of some coordinate hyperplane xi 0 for x t it is clear generalized cusps 15 h exists moreover cl w is disjoint from the projectivization of the affine hyperplane xi 0 so w is properly convex in what follows closure is taken in rpn observe that w a a where a cl and a cl cl so a a int then a int 0 1 and a int 1 so w int 0 since g preserves a and a it preserves w proposition 1 55 if u rpn is an open properly convex set that is preserved by t and u u 0 then either u is a standard domain or else t n and u is an extended domain proof as usual we drop from the notation since t preserves each component of x it preserves each component of u x the latter are properly convex so by lemma 1 53 the closure in rn of each of these components is a standard domain it suffices to show that if there is more than one component then t n and there are exactly two components if there is more than one component then since u is connected the closure in rpn of two distinct components must intersect we may assume one component is contained in v and the other is g for some g e t the intersection g is contained in r and separates the open set int u it follows that r n 1 so t n 1 or t n and that there are at most two components we claim that if t n 1 then u is not convex this is because using definition 1 3 the intersection of with the 2 dimensional affine subspace given by xi 1 for i n 1 is xn n 1 log xn 1 which looks like y log x shown in figure 1 in this case it is clear that an extended domain is not convex at the right hand endpoint of 1 0 if t n then g must preserve which implies g i completing the proof corollary 1 56 if c is a generalized cusp with holonomy g then c is equivalent to a cusp proof we have c u for some u u 0 that is preserved by by theorem 6 3 from 17 there is a g invariant subset u u and u is equivalent to c so u u 0 by proposition 1 55 either u is a standard domain or else an extended domain otherwise if u is extended then u contains a standard domain that is g invariant and c is equivalent to the cusp if c is a generalized cusp that properly contains another generalized cusp c and they have the same boundary then t n and the holonomy is diagonalizable equivalent cusps are not always projectively equivalent after removing suitable collars of the boundary if t n 1 then n 1 but there is no larger g invariant domain that contains in its interior 1 5 hex geometry in this section m m r denotes the interior of a simplex r let v 0 vr rr 1 be a basis then vi are the vertices of an r simplex the identity component dr pgl m is the projectivization of the positive diagonal subgroup and pgl m dr o sr 1 is an internal semidirect product where sr 1 is the group of coordinate permutations definition 1 57 the r dimensional hex geometry is hexr pgl m r m r let ui 0 i r rr 1 be a spanning set of unit vectors with ui 0 the map xivi 7 log xi ui is an isometry taking m dm to a certain normed vector space rr the name hex geometry comes from the fact that when r 2 the unit ball is a regular hexagon it follows that isom m m is isomorphic to a subgeometry of euclidean geometry moreover pgl m is an index 2 subgroup of isom m dm this is all due to de la harpe 22 recall that 1 2 r 0 and i 0 for all r i n recall proposition 1 44 that s pgl m r is the group of coordinate permutations that preserve r i 1 iei it is clear that s is isomorphic to a product of symmetric groups skj there is one factor isomorphic to the 16 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner symmetric group sk for each maximal consecutive sequence i i i i k 1 of non zero coordinates in definition 1 58 the subgeometry dr o s m r of hexr is called hexr when x is a metric space we denote isom x x geometry by x for example hn is hyperbolic geometry in dimension n the geometry 0 has g 1 the product geometry of g x and h y is g h x y with the product action horoball geometry is the subgeometry horou 1 b g of hu 1 where b hu 1 is a horoball and g isom hu 1 is the subgroup that preserves b in the following theorem interpret both hex 0 and e 0 as the trivial geometry on one point and horo 0 as the trivial geometry 0 theorem 1 59 g is isomorphic to the product geometry hexr horou 1 and also to hexr eu 0 proof in what follows most functions and sets should be decorated with this is often omitted for clarity first assume t n the diffeomorphism v v is defined by x z y x z t og x y by equation 1 20 is the graph z f x y and it follows that is the graph of z f x y t og x using equation 1 19 this simplifies to z y 2 2 when u 0 and to z 0 when u 0 in each case m r b where m r 0 r b z y r ru z y 2 2 and g g 1 acts on this set this gives an isomorphism of geometries g g m r b the subgroup t t 1 of g acts on by the affine transformations of rn t exp diag x 0 0 1 y t y 2 2 0 iu y 0 0 1 x r r y ru by proposition 1 44 o o which acts affinely on rn 1 by corollary 1 45 g t o o and it follows that the action of g gm r gb is affine and splits into the direct sum of actions on rr ru 1 given by gm r d r o s gb 1 y t y 2 2 0 o u y 0 0 1 then b gb horou 1 which is obviously isomorphic to eu 0 for t n the set has a product structure coming from the horospheres and the radial flow the group g acts trivially on the radial flow factor and projection along the radial flow gives a g equivariant diffeomorphism from each horosphere to n 1 corollary 1 60 g is isomorphic to a subgeometry of euclidean geometry proof each of the factors in theorem 1 59 is isomorphic to a subgeometry of euclidean geometry the next section gives a particular isomorphism generalized cusps 17 2 euclidean structure this section is devoted to showing that a generalized cusp has an underlying euclidean structure with flat totally geodesic boundary this provides a natural map from a generalized cusp to a standard cusp modelled on hn a metric is first defined on v rn in terms of a horofunction and may be viewed as a kind of modified hessian metric 30 theorem 2 1 let h h be the horofunction on v v given q v let h be the horosphere containing q and v h be projection along the radial flow then d 2 h d dh 2 is a quadratic form on tqv that defines a riemannian metric on v and a there is an isometry f v rn 2 where 2 is the standard euclidean metric b f rn 1 0 c the horofunction is the n th coordinate of f i e h p fn p d the action of g on v is by isometries of this metric e the radial flow t on v is conjugated by f to x 7 x t en f the radial flow acts on v by isometries g radial flow lines are orthogonal to horospheres h the action of t on is conjugated by f to the group of translations of xn 0 proof in what follows derivatives are at q so d means dq and so on cleary is symmetric and we first verify that it is also positive definite given q v let h v be the horosphere containing q the radial flow line through q is f r v given by f t t q and is transverse to h thus tqv tqh r v where v f 0 is tangent to the radial flow at q if w tqv then w a t v for some a tqh and d w a observe that tqh ker dh from equation 1 14 dh v 1 so dh 2 a t v t 2 thus 2 2 w d 2 h a t 2 and it suffices to check that d 2 h is positive definite on ker dh when r n 2 3 d 2 h n i 1 i 1 n i 1 ix 2 i dx 2 i and since all i 0 and xi 0 on v it follows that d 2 h is positive definite on tqv and so is positive definite on ker dh when r n 2 4 dh dxr 1 r i 1 ix 1 i dxi n i r 2 xidxi 2 5 d 2 h r i 1 ix 2 i dx 2 i n i r 2 dx 2 i in this case by equation 1 12 the radial flow is vertical translation and v xr 1 thus d 2 h is positive semi definite and vanishes only in the v direction hence it is positive definite on ker dh thus is a riemannian metric on v since g preserves h and commutes with it acts by isometries of proving d the radial flow preserves h up to adding a constant and so preserves dh and d 2 h and is therefore also an isometry of proving f hence the extended translation group tr acts by isometries of since this action is simply transitive we may identify tr with v since tr rn as a lie group it follows that this metric is flat so there is an isometry 18 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner f v rn 2 proving a we use u 1 un as the coordinates of a point in the codomain rn each horosphere in v is the orbit of a point under the subgroup rn 1 t tr therefore the horospheres are identified with parallel hyperplanes in rn we can choose the isometry f so that the horosphere is sent to the subspace un 0 and so that is identified with the half space un 0 observe that tqv tqh r v and is the sum of two quadratic forms each of which vanishes on one summand and is positive definite on the other it follows the two summands are orthogonal with respect to which proves g from g it follows that flow lines are lines parallel to the un direction along a flow line is dh 2 so the distance between x and t x is h t x h x t by equation 1 14 moroever since is un 0 the radial flow t is conjugated by f to u 7 u t en this proves b c e and h definition 2 6 set i 0 suppose a dsa is a euclidean manifold and i dt is a complete riemannian metric on i the metric ds 2 ds 2 a dt 2 on a i is called a product euclidean structure given c 0 the metric c ds 2 a c 2 dt 2 is called a horoscaling of ds 2 a diffeomorphism f a i m is a horoscaling if the pullback of the metric on m is a horoscaling of the metric on a i a horofunction metric on is a horoscaling of the metric in theorem 2 1 thus is a product euclidean structure and the metric c obtained by replacing h in the definition of by c h is a horoscaling of 2 7 c d 2 c h ker d c h d c h 2 c d 2 h ker dh c 2 dh 2 proposition 2 8 suppose has horofunction metric and has horofunction metric and p pgl r n 1 and p then p is a horoscaling of thus the set of horofunction metrics on is an invariant of the projective equivalence class of proof h p c h for some c 0 by proposition 1 29 f so p is a horoscaling of by equation 2 7 proposition 2 9 let and t t if t 0 then pgl g if t 0 then pgl acts by horoscalings and g 0 c pgl and pgl g 0 r proof proposition 2 8 implies pgl acts by horoscalings thus if p pgl then p is a euclidean similarity of if p is not an isometry of after replacing p by p 1 if needed we may assume p is a contraction of then there is a point x fixed by p by theorem 1 45 a the group t acts simply transitively on and this gives an identification t via t 7 t x under this identification x is identified with the id t let u be the ball of radius 1 with center x then p u u is a ball of strictly smaller radius under the identification u gives a neighborhood v t of the identity in t and pv p 1 v is a strictly smaller neighborhood this inclusion is given by conjugacy thus t is unipotent so t 0 thus if t 0 then p is an isometry of a horosphere in is characterized as the set of points some fixed distance from therefore p preserves each horosphere hence p g if t n and s 0 then t t s 2 by equation 1 33 if t n then 2 10 t s 2 pt p 1 with p diag ir s iu s 1 in both cases is projectively equivalent to s 2 proposition 2 11 if a and t t and t t then the following are equivalent a there is a projective transformation that sends to generalized cusps 19 b t and t are conjugate in gl n 1 r c ker ker d c for some c 0 proof d c is immediate because 6 0 implies e 1 0 and similarly for suppose p gl n 1 r and ptp 1 t since t acts transitively on it follows that p is a t orbit by lemma 1 52 there is a projective transformation r taking this orbit to after replacing p by r p we may assume p but is the convex hull of so p thus b a conversely if p then s ptp 1 is contained in g by proposition 2 8 since s rn 1 theorem 1 45 f implies s t proving a b c b by equation 2 10 this leaves b c if g gl v then a subspace 0 6 u v is a weight space with real weight g r if u v v g g g v g v by equations 1 33 and 1 34 the weight spaces of m are ei and the points ei rp n are the fixed points of t for 1 i t 1 if ptp 1 t then p sends the fixed points of t to those of t by the first paragraph we may assume p the center of the radial flow for both and is et 1 and proposition 1 29 b implies p thus p preserves the t invariant subspace w e 1 et the definition of t 1 is conjugacy invariant so pt 1 p 1 t 1 restricting the action of t 2 to w gives a subgroup t w 2 gl w of the positive diagonal group and tw 1 is the subgroup of t w 2 given by ker the conjugacy r p w gl w from tw 1 to t 1 w permutes the fixed points e 1 et of tw 1 since tw 1 is diagonal conjugating by a diagonal matrix centralizes tw 1 so we may assume r is a permutation matrix then rt w 1 r 1 t 1 w and r permutes the coordinates of but the coordinates of both and are in decreasing order so r must leave unchanged thus rtw 1 r 1 tw 1 it follows that t w 1 t 1 w which implies c 2 1 normalizing the metric given that comes equipped with a family of euclidean flat metrics it is natural to ask if there is any intrinsic way of distinguishing different metrics when 0 then the interior of 0 can be identified with hn and for each c 0 there is a hyperbolic element pgl isom hn that rescales the horofunction h 0 c h 0 as a result there is no projectively invariant way to assign a distinguished metric to 0 this corresponds to the familiar fact that the complement of a point in the sphere at infinity for hn only has an invariant euclidean similarity structure rather than a euclidean metric but when 6 0 the story is different if x d is a metric space and f x x is an isometry the displacement distance of f is d f inf d x fx x x if 6 0 define the subset j t 2 to consists of all a t 2 such that the largest eigenvalue of a is exp 1 this set is non empty and compact a horofunction metric on is normalized if sup a a j 1 this metric is euclidean by theorem 2 1 if c is a generalized cusp the normalized horofunction metric on c is the metric covered by corollary 2 12 if 6 0 then there is a unique normalized horofunction metric on if p pgl n 1 r and p then p is an isometry between the normalized horofunction metrics there is a unique normalized horofunction metric on a cusp c and c is isometric to the euclidian manifold c 0 with a product metric and c is a compact euclidean manifold if c and c are generalized cusps of type t 0 and p c c is a projective diffeomorphism then p is an isometry between these metrics proof unicity is clear suppose resp has normalized horofunction metric resp if p then by proposition 2 8 p is a horoscaling of the normalization condition implies these metrics are equal because conjugation does not change eigenvalues by 20 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner theorem 2 1 is isometric to a euclidean half space and g preserves this metric so covers a euclidean metric on c with c flat the last conclusion follows from the second conclusion 2 2 the second fundamental form definition 2 13 suppose s rn is a transversally oriented smooth hypersurface the second fundamental form ii on s is the quadratic form defined on each tangent space iiq tqs r by iiq 0 0 nq where s is a smooth curve in s with 0 q and nq is a unit normal vector to s at q in the direction given by the transverse orientation it is routine to verify that ii is well defined the sign of ii depends on a choice of normal orientation if s is a convex hypersurface and q s and nq points to the convex side then iiq is positive definite and defines a riemannian metric on s see 32 there is a cotangent vector q t q rn defined by q v v np and iiq 0 q 0 observe that ker q tqs tqrn we refer to q as the inward unit cotangent vector for s at q now apply this to the horosphere s h in theorem 2 1 suppose v 0 tqh then dq v v and v ker dq h hence the definition of in theorem 2 1 implies v d 2 q h v also dq h q q for some q 0 using tangent plane coordinates at q gives 2 14 tqh q iiq in particular since is a horosphere proposition 2 15 the restriction of the horofunction metric to is conformally equivalent to the second fundamental form of in a rn the following elementary fact does not seem to be well known cf proposition 1 1 in 9 it implies that g acts conformally on since the action of t on is simply transitive the second fundamental form is conformally equivalent to a flat metric proposition 2 16 suppose s rn is a smooth strictly convex hypersurface and rn rn is an affine isomorphism and s s then s ii s ii is a conformal map suppose p and q are the inward unit cotangent vectors to s at p and to s at q p respectively then q p for some p 0 and p ii q iip proof given p s set q p we must show that ii q p iip for some p 0 let h rn be the hyperplane tangent to s at p translate h infinitesimally so that it intersects s in an infinitesimal ellipsoid centered on p this gives a foliation of an infinitesimal neighborhood of p in s by ellipsoids which we may identify with the levels sets of iip in tp since affine maps send parallel hyperplanes to parallel hyperplanes the foliation near p is sent to the foliation near q if two quadratic forms have the same level sets then one is a scalar multiple of the other more formally suppose s is smooth with 0 p then iiq 0 iiq 0 q 0 since is an affine map 0 d 0 since d tps tqs it follows that q d p for some p thus q d 0 p 0 iip 0 generalized cusps 21 proof of theorem 0 5 the metric with the required properties is given by theorem 2 1 in the affine patch a and the restriction of to is conformally equivalent to the second fundamental form by proposition 2 15 3 generalized cusps are cusps as mentioned in the introduction the idea of a cusp in a projective manifold has evolved in a series of papers recall that if is properly convex then a pgl is parabolic if all the eigenvalues of a have the same modulus and there is no fixed point in int a definition of the term cusp in a properly convex manifold was first given in definition 5 2 of 16 there the holonomy of a cusp c consists of parabolics the definition used there was dictated by the requirement to establish a thick thin decomposition for strictly convex manifolds of possibly infinite volume in that paper the rank of c is defined and maximal rank is equivalent to c being compact see proposition 5 5 of 16 in this paper we only consider cusps of maximal rank so we have omitted the term maximal rank from statements a definition of the term generalized cusp was first given in 17 definition 6 1 it differs from the definition in the introduction by using the term nilpotent in place of abelian theorem 0 7 at the end of this section shows that these definitions are equivalent definition 3 1 a g cusp called a generalized cusp in 17 is a properly convex manifold c homeomorphic to c 0 with c a connected closed manifold and 1 c virtually nilpotent such that contains no line segment the group is called a g cusp group in addition a if 1 c is virtually abelian then c is a generalized cusp b if pgl acts transitively on then c is homogeneous c a cusp is a generalized cusp with parabolic holonomy d a standard cusp is a cusp that is projectively equivalent to a cusp in a hyperbolic manifold next we restate some previous results from 16 and 17 with respect the the terminology in definition 3 1 theorem 3 2 theorem 0 5 in 16 every cusp in a properly convex real projective manifold is standard observe that a finite cover of a g cusp is also a g cusp theorem 3 3 theorem 6 3 in 17 every g cusp is equivalent to a homogeneous g cusp definition 3 4 ut n gl n r is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with positive diag onal entries definition 3 5 an e group is a subgroup g gl n r such that every eigenvalue of every element of g is positive if gl n r is discrete a virtual e hull for is a connected e group g gl n r such that g and g g is compact observe that ut n is an e group definitions 6 1 and 6 10 and proposition 6 12 in 17 imply proposition 3 6 suppose p is a g cusp of dimension n then contains a finite index subgroup 1 that is a lattice in the connected nilpotent group t exp log 1 moreover t is conjugate in gl n 1 r into ut n 1 in 17 1 core n the zariski closure of generally has larger dimension than t theorem 3 7 theorem 6 18 17 if is a generalized cusp then t is the unique virtual e hull of 22 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner theorem 3 8 theorem 9 1 16 suppose that is open and strictly convex of dimension n and w sl is a nilpotent group that fixes p fr and acts simply transitively of fr p then fr is an ellipsoid and w is conjugate to the subgroup of a parabolic group in o n 1 that has all eigenvalues 1 definition 3 9 cf definition 6 17 in 17 a translation group is a connected nilpotent subgroup t gl n 1 r that is the virtual e hull of a g cusp definition 3 10 page 189 16 given a 1 dimensional subspace u v set p p u and define dp p v p p v u by dp x x u the space of directions of the subset p v at p is dp p theorem 3 11 if g gl n 1 r is a translation group then there exists a such that g and t have images in pgl n 1 r that are conjugate proof here is an outline the group g preserves a properly convex domain the idea is to build a bundle structure m where m is the interior of a simplex and the fibers are standard horoballs at several key places we use the fact that contains no line segment we can reduce to the case that g is upper triangular and nilpotent then g im is block upper triangular and each block is of the form i i where i is a weight and i is unipotent define t 1 to be the number of blocks the diagonal case is easy so we assume g is not diagonal then t n 1 there is a projection m t onto the interior of a simplex of dimension t this is obtained by writing v rn 1 w u where w rt 1 is the subspace spanned by the union over blocks of the last vector in each block and u is spanned by the remaining basis vectors then u is invariant because g is upper triangular and so g acts diagonally by the weights on v u w the vertices of m are given by the last vector in each block so m is preserved by g then is the orbit of a point because g acts transitively on it follows that m p w otherwise dim dim m n so dim dim which implies contains a line segment and contradicts is strictly convex the key fact is that the fiber q 1 q over a point q m is a standard horoball this is because the subgroup of g that preserves q acts transitively on q and is unipotent thus q is projectively equivalent to a horoball by theorem 3 8 this implies there is at most one block of dimension bigger than 1 we can arrange this block is in the bottom right corner and has trivial weight 1 at this point we almost have g it remains to find the coupling term i log xi there is a short exact sequence 1 k g h 1 here k rn t 1 is a standard parabolic group acting on q and h rt is the diagonal group acting on w there is a splitting h g that maps into the normalizer in unipotent upper triangular matrices n of k now n is generated by k and a 1 parameter group which turns out to be the radial flow this is enough structure to pin everything down here are the details by proposition 3 6 we may assume g is upper triangular by propositions 6 23 and 6 24 in 17 g preserves a properly convex domain rn with s strictly convex moreover g acts simply transitively on s let ei 1 i n 1 be the standard basis of rn 1 since g is nilpotent we may further assume cf proof of 9 2 in 16 there is a decomposition v rn 1 v 1 vt 1 into g invariant subspaces such that vi has ordered basis bi ek mi 1 k mi where ni dimvi mi mi 1 by reordering the standard basis we may assume ni ni 1 let ut 1 vi be the group of unipotent upper triangular matrices of size ni then there are distinct weights i g r and homomorphisms i g ut 1 vi so that g is the image of the generalized cusps 23 inclusion map g gl v given by 3 12 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 t 1 t 1 by scaling we may assume that t 1 1 and hence that g aff rn next let ui bi wi then vi ui r wi the subspace u ui is preserved by g and there is a linear projection v v u define a subspace w w 1 wt 1 rn 1 so w w 1 wt 1 is an ordered basis of w there is projection v v u and an isomorphism w v u defined by wi 7 wi u and p v p u p v u is the induced projection since g preserves u it acts on v u and thus on w we denote this action by w g gl w using the basis w this action is diagonal and recalling that t 1 1 3 13 w 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 t 0 0 0 1 there are t 1 projective hyperplanes pi in p w rpr each of which contains all but one of the points wi each of these hyperplanes is preserved by g the complement of these hyperplanes consists of 2 t open simplices since g acts transitively on s it also acts transitively via w on s p w choose q x s then q is in one of these open simplices say m otherwise since s is preserved by g it follows that s is contained in some hyperplane pi p w but this implies s 1 pi which is a hyperplane in p v this contradicts that s is a strictly convex hypersurface in v claim 1 either g is diagonal or else h w g acts simply transitively on m the fiber 1 q p v p u that contains q is the affine subspace uq x u if s is transverse to uq then s contains an open subset of m so dimh dim m but s is the h orbit of a point and h is the projectivization of a diagonal subgroup so h acts transitively on m thus we may assume s is not transverse to uq if a strictly convex hypersurface is not transverse to a hyperplane then it is to tangent to it at one point so uq s q since g acts transitively on s this condition holds at every q s this implies s is injective so dim m dims thus t n 1 if t n then g is diagonal as claimed otherwise t n 1 since s is injective and dims n 1 dim m it follows that s contains an open subset of m as before this implies h acts transitively which proves claim 1 in the case g is diagonal since dimg dims n 1 it follows that g is the kernel of some homomorphism d r where d is the diagonal subgroup of ut n 1 aff rn it follows from remark 1 6 that or is positive this proves the theorem when t n henceforth we assume t n so h acts simply transitively on m thus dimh t and from equation 3 13 it follows that h gl t 1 r consists of all positive diagonal matrices with 1 in the bottom right corner the projection restricts to a g equivariant surjection m and k ker w g acts trivially via w on m and is unipotent each fiber q uq 1 q is a properly convex set which is preserved by k since g acts simply transitively on it follows that k acts simply transitively on q uq for every q simple transitivity implies that the action of k on uq is faithful since the action of k on m is trivial k x u x u for all k k thus the subspace u u r x v is preserved by k and uq u x p u p v the action of k on u 24 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner is the restriction of the action on v and is therefore unipotent moreover u ui r x so the action k on u is given by k k where 3 14 u 1 u 1 0 0 2 u 2 0 0 0 0 0 t 1 ut 1 0 0 1 the notation u means the restriction of the action of to the subspace u v etc the properly convex set q uq p u is preserved by k moreover k is nilpotent upper triangular and acts simply transitively on q the hyperplane p u p u is preserved by k and the point s q cl q p u is fixed by k also ds q ds q hence ds q k q k is a single point and thus compact it now follows from theorem 5 7 in 16 that s is a round point of q recall from 16 that a point is round if it is c 1 and strictly convex in the boundary hence cl q q t s and q is strictly convex it follows from theorem 3 8 that q is an ellipsoid and k is conjugate to the parabolic subgroup 3 15 p exp 0 y 1 yu 0 0 y 1 0 0 yu 0 0 gl u hence u 2 dimu if u 0 this is the identity matrix and k k is the trivial group when u 0 then p acts affinely on ru 1 the orbit under p of the origin is the paraboloid y 0 1 2 y 2 1 y 2 u which is the boundary minus one point of the parabolic model of hu 1 and p is the group of parabolics in particular if a and b are invariant subspace of u then a b 6 0 it follows that dimui 0 for at most one i since dimvi dimvi 1 and dimui dimvi 1 then ui 0 and dimvi 1 for all i t let t 1 v vt 1 be the projection given by the direct sum decomposition then u ut 1 r x and t 1 u vt 1 is an equivariant isomorphism after a change of basis for vt 1 3 16 k it 0 0 p gl n 1 r this formula also holds when u 0 since k is then trivial we thus have a short exact sequence 3 17 1 k g h 1 incl w if t 0 then g k p t 0 and the result holds thus we may assume t 0 since vi r ei for i t it follows that vt 1 has basis et 1 en 1 since h rt there is a splitting h g since g is block diagonal and referring to equation 3 12 it follows that 3 18 1 0 0 2 0 0 t 0 0 where h ut 1 vt 1 and i h r satisfies i i w since k is a normal subgroup of g it follows that h is a subgroup of the normalizer n of p in ut 1 vt 1 let expr a ut 1 vt 1 be the one parameter group where a is the elementary matrix with 1 in the top right generalized cusps 25 corner then centralizes p thus is the radial flow on p vt 1 with center et 1 and stationary hyperplaneh p et 1 en it remains to show can be chosen so that h then k p and h t 2 thus g p t 2 t let n p k be the lie algebras of n p k respectively the above provides an identification k p claim 2 n p so n p r a the closures of the orbits of p in p vt 1 consists of a fixed point lines in the hyperplane h containing and a one parameter family of horospheres each tangent toh at sincen normalizes p it permutes p orbits thus n preserves the fixed set and center of and so normalizes the radial flow since n is unipotent n centralizes the radial flow the radial flow acts transitively on horospheres so if n n there is exp ta such that p n preserves one horosphere but since n centralizes this implies that p preserves every horosphere thus p is an isometry of hu 1 p vt 1 where dimvt 1 u 2 since p is unipotent it follows that p is parabolic thus p p so n 1 p which proves claim 2 taking derivatives d h g if f h k is a homomorphism then exponentiating f d gives a new section of equation 3 17 and so without loss of generality we may assume that d has image in r a then h the strictly convex hypersurface is a g orbit it follows from remark 1 6 that or is positive without loss we may assume is positive so a the rescaling changes g by central elements of gl n 1 r and as a result we have only shown that the original g and t have the same image in pgl n 1 r proof of theorems 0 1 and 0 7 suppose c is generalized cusp and hence a g cusp by theorem 3 3 c is equivalent to a homogeneous g cusp c by proposition 3 6 and theorem 3 7 contains a finite index subgroup 1 that is conjugate to a subgroup of a translation group t by theorem 3 11 after a conjugacy t t for some we may assume it is irreducible then by lemma 1 53 g for some g e thus a conjugate of preserves so after conjugacy we may assume pgl if 6 0 then pgl g and by proposition 2 9 therefore c is cusp if 0 then 1 t 0 so 1 g 0 since 1 is finite and pgl 0 g 0 r it follows that 1 g 0 and again c is a cusp this proves theorem 0 1 it follows is virtually abelian which proves theorem 0 7 proof of corollary 0 4 we identify 1 m since a 0 for every 0 there is a loop in m that has length less than and is conjugate in 1 m to a it follows that if x m is compact then a is represented by a loop in m x thus a is represented by a loop in an end of m and therefore in a generalized cusp c m with c c since a 0 then we can conjugate so deta 1 and then a g the result now follows from corollary 1 46 another consequence of theorem 0 1 is that each generalized cusp is equipped with a canonical hyperbolic metric theorem 3 19 underlying hyperbolic structure every generalized cusp c with boundary a horo manifold has a hyperbolic metric c such that c is the quotient of a horosphere in hn if c is another such cusp and if p c c is a projective diffeomorphism then p is an isometry from c to c proof suppose c is a generalized cusp of dimension n bounded by a horomanifold then by theorem 0 1 c is equivalent to a cusp there is a unique horofunction metric c on c such that the euclidean volume of c is 1 this metric is c if c and c are generalized cusps and p c c is a projective diffeomorphism then p is covered by a projective isomorphism which is an isometry between horofunction metrics thus p is an isometry 26 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner there is a unique hyperbolic cusph bounded by a horomanifold with h isometric to c c the restriction of the hyperbolic metric to h equals the restriction of h to h thus there is an isometry c c h h that identifies c with a hyperbolic cusp this raises several questions for example using this one can assign a cusp shape z c to a generalized cusp in a 3 manifold if a hyperbolic 3 manifold with one cusp can be projectively deformed can this shape change 4 classification of cusps this section is devoted to the proofs of theorem 0 2 and corollary 0 3 but first we need lemma 4 1 if c and c are equivalent generalized cusps of dimension n then and are conjugate subgroups of pgl n 1 r proof the definition of equivalent cusps given in the introduction is not transitive though it will follow from the classification that it is transitive in this proof we use the equivalence relation generated by the relation on pairs of cusps given c and c there is a cusp c diffeomorphic to both of them and projective embeddings of c that are also homotopy equivalences into both c and c thus it suffices to prove the lemma when there is a projective embedding of c into c that is also a homotopy equivalence we may assume c c and this amounts to performing a conjugacy since the embeddings are homotopy equivalences it follows that proof of theorem 0 2 i it is clear that c a also a b follows from lemma 4 1 for i b c and ii suppose g and g are lattices and p pgl n 1 r with p p 1 by theorem 3 7 t is the unique virtual e hull of thus pt p 1 t hence u p 1 is a properly convex set that is preserved by t moreover u is irreducible since this property is preserved by projective maps by lemma 1 53 there is g e such that g u since g centralizes t we may replace p by g p and assume that p it follows that p g p 1 g proving one direction of ii the converse of ii is obvious if g g then p preserves which proves i b c iii by theorem 1 45 f t is a characteristic subgroup of g it is the subgroup of elements all of whose eigenvalues are positive thus if p conjugates g to g then it conjugates t to t by proposition 2 11 this happens if and only if t for some t 0 iv follows from proposition 2 9 v is done below proof of corollary 0 3 to show f is surjective suppose c is a generalized cusp of dimension n by theorem 0 1 there is an equivalent cusp c for some lattice g by theorem 0 2 i c we may assume e 1 1 then f c therefore f modn cn is surjective to show f is injective suppose f 1 f 2 for lattices i g i by lemma 4 1 1 and 2 are conjugate subgroups of pgl n 1 r then by theorem 0 2 ii g 1 and g 2 are conjugate in pgl n 1 r and by theorem 0 2 iii this implies 1 t 2 for some t 0 since 1 e 1 2 e 1 then 1 2 by theorem 0 2 i c it follows that 1 and 2 are conjugate subgroups of g 1 so 1 2 and f is injective corollary 0 3 reduces the classification of equivalence classes of generalized cusps to the classifica tion of conjugacy classes of lattices in each of the groups g pgl n 1 r this classification corresponds to moduli space of g there is a finer classification using the notion of marking that results in an analog of teichmuller space we will show that a marked generalized cusp is parameterized by a marked euclidean cusp together with a left coset a o o n 1 o called the anisotropy parameter the classification of unmarked cusps is more complicated to state one complication is that in general there are finitely many distinct isomorphism types of lattice in g to make these subtleties clear requires several definitions generalized cusps 27 a discrete subgroup h of a lie group g is a lattice if g h is compact the set of lattices in g is denoted lat g the quotient of this set by the action of g by conjugacy gives the set of conjugacy classes of lattices in g denoted mod g lat g g this set is partitioned into isomorphism classes given a lattice h in g an h lattice is a lattice h in g with h h and the set of h lattices is the subset lat g h lat g the set of conjugacy classes of h lattice is mod g h lat g h g and is a subset of mod g a marking of an h lattice h in g is an isomorphism h h and is also called a marked h lattice the set of all marked h lattices in g is denoted by latm g h thus a lattice is a group but a marked lattice is a homomorphism and latm g h is the subset of the representation variety hom h g consisting of those injective homomorphisms with image a lattice of g let h be a set of lattices in g that contains one lattice in each isomorphism class the set of marked lattices in g is latm g latm g h where the union is over h h two marked h lattices 1 2 h g are conjugate if there is g g with 2 g 1 1 g and the set of conjugacy classes of marked h lattices is t g h latm g h g the set of conjugacy classes of marked lattices in g is t g latm g g as an example a lattice in g isom e 2 is a 2 dimensional bieberbach group wallpaper group and there are 17 isomorphism types for h these are also the isomorphism classes of compact euclidean 2 orbifolds there is a natural bijection between t isom e 2 z 2 and marked euclidean structures on a torus t 2 it is well known that a marked euclidean torus of area 1 is parameterized by a point in the upper half plane h 2 moreover t isom e 2 z 2 r x iy c y 0 r h 2 mod isom e 2 z 2 r h 2 psl 2 z the r factor records the area of the torus that is the quotient of e 2 by the action of the lattice before proceeding to the proof of theorem 0 2 v we give an example for 3 manifolds for a generic diagonalizable generalized cusp lie group such as 3 2 1 then g r 2 and o is trivial a z 2 lattice in g is a subgroup h zu zv r 2 given by a pair of linearly independent vectors u v r 2 using the z 2 marking given by 1 0 7 u and 0 1 7 v shows that the 2 2 matrix m ut vt determines a unique marked lattice so t g z 2 gl 2 r there is a natural map t g z 2 t isom e 2 z 2 and two lattices m m gl 2 r have the same image if and only if there is a o 2 with am m it follows that t g z 2 o 2 t isom e 2 z 2 this illustrates theorem 0 2 v a marked lattice in g is parameterized by a marked euclidean lattice and a left coset of o in this case o is trivial so the left coset is just an element of o 2 now consider unmarked lattices a change of marking is a change of basis in z 2 and this changes the lattice m to a m where a gl 2 z thus mod g z 2 gl 2 z gl 2 r the left action of gl 2 z on gl 2 r is free however the action of gl 2 z on t isom e 2 z 2 is not free a 2 rotation fixes an unmarked square torus thus mod g z 2 o 2 mod isom e 2 z 2 which means unmarked lattices in g are not parametrized by an unmarked lattices in isom e 2 together with an anisotropy parameter proof of 0 2 v for this proof we will identify g with the subgroup rn 1 oo of isom en 1 since isom en 1 g o n 1 o is compact every lattice in g is also a lattice in 28 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner isom en 1 let t isom en 1 t isom en 1 be the subset of conjugacy classes of lattice with rotational part in o the map latm g t isom en 1 is surjective choose a right inverse t isom en 1 latm g so id and define t isom en 1 o n 1 o t g by 4 2 g o g 1 g this map is well defined because the equivalence class in t g of a lattice is not changed by an o conjugacy then theorem 0 2 v is the assertion that is a bijection set l im then l is a set of marked lattices in g that contains one representative of each isom en 1 conjugacy class there is a map l isom en 1 t g given by g g 1 g which is obviously surjective observe that 1 g 1 2 g 2 if and only if g 11 1 g 1 k 1 g 12 2 g 2 k for some k g this is equivalent to 1 g 1 2 g with g g 2 k g 11 thus 1 2 are conjugate this implies the domain of both 1 and of 2 is the same lattice h h since 1 2 l it follows that 1 2 and 4 3 g g 1 therefore g centralizes the lattice h it follows that 1 g 1 1 g 2 if and only if there is l and k g such that 1 2 and g g 2 k g 11 centralizes observe that if marked lattices are replaced by unmarked lattices we can only conclude at this point that g normalizes we can express g isom en 1 uniquely as a pair g a v o n 1 rn 1 where g x ax v and a is called the rotational part of g indeed if g 1 x a 1 x v 1 and g 2 x a 2 x v 2 and k x bx v with b o then 4 4 g x g 2 k g 11 x a 2 ba 11 x v 2 a 2 ba 11 v 1 a 2 v by bieberbach s first theorem 10 the subset of the lattice consisting of pure translations is a finite index subgroup t that is also a lattice in rn 1 thus t is centralized by g this means the rotational part of g preserves an ordered basis of rn 1 an element of o n 1 that preserves an ordered basis of rn 1 is trivial hence the rotational part of g is trivial so a 2 ba 11 i and 4 5 g x x v 2 v 1 a 2 v it follows that g 1 g 2 if and only if g 1 a 1 v 1 and g 2 a 2 a 1 b 1 v 2 and there is v rn such that g i v 2 v 1 a 2 v centralizes if we choose v a 12 v 1 v 2 then g i 0 centralizes it follows that 1 a 1 v 1 2 a 2 v 2 if and only if 1 2 and a 2 a 1 o in other words 1 g 1 2 g 2 if and only if 1 2 and g 1 g g 2 g as a result induces a bijection l isom en 1 g t g observe that isom en 1 g o n 1 o by definition of l there is a bijection l l t isom en 1 given by 7 thus factors through the bijection in equation 4 2 completing the proof generalized cusps 29 5 hilbert metric in a generalized cusp in this section we describe how the hilbert metric of a horomanifold changes as it is pushed out into the cusp by the radial flow in the following discussion volume means hausdorff measure the horomanifolds shrink as they flow into a cusp although not uniformly in all directions parabolic directions which only exist when u 0 shrink exponentially with distance out into the cusp but hyperbolic directions shrink towards a limiting positive value hence the volume of the cusp cross section horomanifold goes to zero exponentially fast when u 0 and the cusp has finite volume when u 0 the cusp cross section converges geometrically to compact n 1 manifold and in this case the cusp has infinite volume if is an open properly convex set in rpn the hilbert metric on is defined as follows suppose p q lie on the line a b rpn given by t t a u b t v with endpoints u v and interior in if p x and q y then 5 1 d p q 1 2 log b x y a b y x a since cross ratios are preserved by projective transformations this is independent of the choice of this is a finsler metric for vectors tangent to this line the hilbert norm is the finsler norm that is the pullback of the riemannian metric on a b given by 5 2 1 2 1 x a 1 b x dx if p 6 q are two points in then q p rn is called a parabolic direction at p if there is a p with a p q it follows that p and q lie in the same horosphere the infinitesimal version of this is that a parabolic tangent vector is a vector v tp that is tangent to the orbit of point p under the action of a 1 parameter subgroup of p if u 0 there are no parabolic directions and if t 0 then every vector tangent to a horosphere is a parabolic direction in general the parabolic directions correspond to the y coordinates in x z y coordinates lemma 5 3 let be the radial flow on and t t and n dim suppose p 6 q and for t 0 define pt t p and qt t q and f t d pt qt then there is 0 a if t n then d p 1 pt log t and if t n then d p 1 pt t 2 b f t is a decreasing function of t c if q p is not a parabolic direction at p then limt f t d if q p is a parabolic direction at p then limt f t exp d p 1 pt proof a follows from a simple computation using 5 1 first assume t n so the radial flow is t x z y x z t y and moves points in the z direction which we call the vertical direction in this case b follows from 31 and also lemma 1 11 in 16 let it rn be the intersection with v of the line containing p t and q t then it t i 0 because preserves v observe that it is a complete affine line if and only if q p 0 z y in x z y coordinates which is equivalent to q p is a parabolic direction the subinterval jt it contains pt and qt thus if it is not a complete line then f t d pt qt djt pt qt dit pt qt di 0 p 0 q 0 0 hence if f t 0 then q p is parabolic since f t is decreasing this proves c in fact it is easy to check that f t di 0 p 0 q 0 now suppose q p is parabolic then p t p ter 1 and q t p t q p let p rn be the affine 2 plane containing the two flow lines p t and q t since q p 0 z y it follows that xi is constant on p for i r then equation 1 4 implies h p is quadratic so u p is a convex set bounded by a parabola the rays p t and q t are vertical in u 30 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner the translation group t acts by isometries of the hilbert metric and commutes with the radial flow we may apply an element of t so that p and q have the same z coordinate then we can choose a w coordinate axis for p in the hyperplane z 0 so that so that u w z z w 2 then p a a 2 and q a a 2 with a 0 and the radial flow acts by t w z w z t then pt a a 2 t and qt a a 2 t and the endpoints of jt are a 2 t a 2 t let kt a 2 t a 2 t r then d pt qt dkt a a for t large by equation 5 1 dkt a a 1 2 log a a 2 t a a 2 t a a 2 t a a 2 t 2 a t 1 2 using a gives d when t n there are no parabolic directions in this case p t and q t are rays in rn contained in lines through 0 the closure of rn in rp n is an n simplex 0 that contains so d d and f t d p t q t the rays p t and q t limit on distinct points p q in the interior of and d p t q t is bounded below by the hilbert distance in between p and q this proves c let lt j 1 be the image of jt under radial projection from 0 since is convex it follows from studying a diagram that lt increases with t however the images p t and q t in j 1 are p 1 and q 1 thus f t d pt qt djt pt qt dlt p 1 q 1 decreases with t which proves b a geodesic is orthogonal to a hypersurface s at the point x s if for all y and z s x then d y x d y z proposition 5 4 in the flowlines of the radial flow are orthogonal to the horospheres hr r moreover d hr hs 1 2 log r s if t n and d hr hs 1 2 r s if t n proof given x int let hr be the horosphere and the radial flow line each containing x let p then r p x the radial flow acts conformally on rn in the parabolic case by translation and in the hyperbolic case by homothety moreover the radial flow preserves and permutes the horospheres let p rn be the hyperplane tangent to at p then r p is parallel to p and tangent to hr at x let u be the component of rn p that contains int then u is a half space and the formula for the hilbert metric applied to u gives a semi metric distinct points can have zero distance with du d the level sets of f y du x y are planes parallel to p moreover du x y d x y when y it follows that if s 0 then s x is the unique point on s hr that minimizes distance to x the formula follows from lemma 5 3 a given a metric space m d the k dimensional hausdorff measure is defined as follows if b x r m is the ball of radius r in m center x then b x r ckr k where ck is the volume of the ball of radius 1 in rk if s is a set of balls in m then s b s b given a subset x m and 0 define x infimum s where the infimum is over all sets s of balls with radius at most that cover x then define an outer measure by x lim 0 x this gives a measure on m in the usual way called k dimensional hausdorff measure denoted volk if is an arc in m then vol 1 is the length of the arc we will use voln 1 to measure the size of a horomanifold in a generalized cusp if m is an n dimensional manifold with a finsler metric then the measure voln is given by a integrating a certain n form called the volume form suppose p m and b tpm is the unit ball in the given norm the volume form on tpm is normalized so that the volume of b is the euclidean volume cn of the unit n dimensional euclidean unit ball thus if 6 0 is an n form on tpm then generalized cusps 31 the volume form dvol on tpm is dvol cn b 1 this defines a borel measure volm on m given by volm x x dvol for a riemannian metric this is the usual volume form for x m we refer to voln x as its volume written voln x m vol x for a properly convex projective n dimensional manifold voln is also called busemann measure it is a result of busemann 8 that busemann measure equals hausdorff measure the next result describes how the volume of a subset of a horosphere shrinks as it flows out into the end of the cusp using the radial flow the asymptotic behavior depends only on the unipotent rank u of the cusp if u 0 the volume of the region shrinks exponentially with distance as it flows out but if u 0 the volume stays bounded away from 0 proposition 5 5 suppose has unipotent rank u u let voln 1 denote busemann measure on hypersurfaces set ht t let l 1 t h 1 ht and let t l 1 voln 1 the measures voln 1 and t on h 1 are absolutely continuous and their radon nikodym derivative t is constant furthermore there exists k 0 such that for all t 0 if u 0 then t k and if u 0 then t k exp d h 1 ht proof we may regard the hilbert norm for restricted to ht as a normed vector space ht t because t t acts simply transitively on ht by isometries of the hilbert metric then l is 1 lipschitz by lemma 5 3 b and l commutes with t so l is linear hence the measures are absolutely continuous and t 1 is constant if u 0 then by lemma 5 3 d there is t 0 0 and a vector v 6 0 such that for all t t l v t 2 t 1 2 v 1 since l v t v 1 for t t this inequality holds for all t 0 with 2 replaced by k max 2 t the result then follows for u 0 using t 1 2 exp d h 1 ht by proposition 5 4 when u 0 by lemma 5 3 c there is 0 independent of t so that the map l 1 is 1 lipschitz then for x h 1 voln 1 x voln 1 l 1 lx 1 n 1 voln 1 lx and the result follows with k n 1 lemma 5 6 there is a decreasing function r 1 such that limx 0 x 1 with the following property suppose rpn are both open and properly convex let and be the hilbert norms on and suppose p and d p x then p p x p proof since the definition of the hilbert metric only involves a line segment it suffices to prove the result in dimension n 1 with 1 1 and u u and 0 u 1 it is easy to do this proof of theorem 0 6 let c be a smaller cusp contained in a larger cusp n c so that c and n are both horomanifolds by lemma 5 6 it suffices to prove the theorem for c n instead of c m suppose v is a normed vector space and u v is a codimension 1 subspace suppose a is a compact subset of u and v v satisfies v minu u u v then a v a tv a a 0 t 1 v is called a cylinder and is diffeomorphic to a i 32 samuel a ballas daryl cooper and arielle leitner write x k y to mean k 1 x y kx given n there is a constant k 0 such that in a normed vector space v of dimension n if a is a cylinder then see 7 5 5 v voln 1 a k voln a v there is a diffeomorphism f c 0 c given by f x s t x where s t 2 if t n and s log t 2 if t n by lemma 5 3 a f x 0 has image a flow line parameterized at unit speed then ct f c t is compact so voln 1 ct using f and volume with respect the busemann measure on n it follows that 5 7 voln c k 1 voln 1 ct dt when u 0 it follows from lemma 5 3 and proposition 5 5 that voln 1 ct o e t and so the integral converges on the other hand if u 0 lemma 5 3 and proposition 5 5 implies there is a 0 such that voln 1 ct a for all t and in this case the volume is infinite 6 dimension 2 in this section we describe 2 dimensional generalized cusps in a way that illuminates the higher dimensional cases and can be read before the rest of the paper a generalized cusp c in a properly convex surface m is a convex submanifold c s 1 0 of m withm c connected and c is a strictly convex curve in the interior ofm thus c where is an infinite cyclic group generated by some element a pgl 3 r and is properly convex and homeomorphic to a closed disc with one point deleted from the boundary and int is a strictly convex curve that

holonomy of each end of s is unipotent conjugate into t 0 0 each domain has two foliations that are preserved by t a horocycle is the orbit of a point under t the radial flow is a one parameter

is determined by a lattice in a generalized cusp lie group for a surface a lattice is infinite cyclic and is determined by a nontrivial element of some t up to replacing the element by its inverse a marked lattice is a lattice with a choice of basis thus conjugacy classes of lattices correspond to moduli space and conjugacy classes of marked lattices to teichmuller space there is an equivalence relation on marked generalized cusps generated by projectively embedding one in another let t be the teichmuller space of equivalence classes of marked generalized cusps for surfaces there is an identification of t with a subspace of sl 3 r modulo conjugacy that sends a marked generalized cusp to the conjugacy class a of the holonomy of the chosen generator the eigenvalues exp x 1 exp x 2 exp x 3 of a determine a and satisfy x 1 x 2 x 3 0 thus a generalized cusp is determined by x 1 x 2 x 3 up to permutations let x r 2 s 3 closed weyl chamber where we identify r 2 with the plane x 1 x 2 x

generalized cusp clearly f is continuous it is easy to check that f is surjective consideration of eigenvalues shows f is injective suppose a sl 3 r and a t then a has real positive eigenvalues let 1 2 3 be the eigenvalues of a in decreasing order and define g a log 1 log 2 log 3 since the eigenvalues of a matrix are continuous functions of the matrix g is continuous but g is the inverse of f so f is a homeomorphism the groups t and t are conjugate in pgl 3 r if and only if t for some t 0 it follows that the space of conjugacy classes of translation subgroup is the non hausdorff space obtained by taking the quotient of x by this equivalence relation this is the union of a compact euclidean interval 0 1 and one extra point which only has one neighborhood 7 dimension 3 let c be an orientable 3 dimensional generalized cusp then c is diffeomorphic to t 2 0 given 1 2 3 with 1 2 3 0 there is a lie subgroup g t oo of pgl 4 r where t r 2 is called the translation group and o is compact then is

that are t orbits moreover is the epigraph of a convex function see equation 1 19 and is shown in figure 4 the radial flow equation 1 12 is a one parameter affine group that centralizes t and orbits give a foliation by a pencil of lines transverse to the horospheres the enlarged translation group equation 1 30 is tt t r 3 it is obtained by replacing the most complicated term in the matrix for t by z there are 4 such groups depending only on t then t is the kernel of a homomorphism tt r obtained from the group t t acts simply transitively on rt r 3 t and the latter contains the group o is the

described in theorem 0 2 they are parameterized by a triple a o with as above and is a marked lattice of co area 1 in r 2 and a o o 2 o is a left coset in 25 the third author showed that in dimension 3 every translation group as defined in definition 3 9 is conjugate into one of these 4 families this together with 1 provided the impetus for the present paper we now describe some geometric properties of these domains and discuss relevant examples from the literature the interior of 0 0 0 is projectively equivalent to h 3 if c 0 0 0 then is conjugate into po 3 1 cusps of finite volume hyperbolic 3 manifolds give rise to generalized cusps of this type the ideal boundary see equation 1 23 of 0 0 0 consists of a single point which is stabilized by g and c admits a compactification by a singular projective manifold obtained by adjoining this ideal boundary point for a generalized cusp c c modelled on 1 0 0 the ideal boundary is a projective line segment j the action of c on i int j is discrete iff contains a parabolic in this case c has a compactification c i c that is a projective manifold that is singular along the circle s 1 i c in 1 the first author found for t 0 a continuous family of properly convex manifolds projectively equivalent to mt t t and diffeomorphic to the figure 8 knot complement x s 3 k and m 0 is the complete hyperbolic structure moreover the end of mt is projectively equivalent to t 0 0 t where t t t 0 0 is a lattice containing parabolics as a result for t 0 there is a compactification m t t t that is a projective structure on s 3 that is singular along k and mt m t k is a properly convex structure on x here t t and also contains generalized cusps 37 the t orbit of an open segment in t 0 0 the cusp of the hyperbolic manifold m 0 deforms to a generalized cusp of a different type as the deformation proceeds an ideal boundary point of h 3 opens up into an ideal boundary segment this is an example of a geometric transition the hyperbolic cusp 0 0 0 0 geometrically transitions to the non hyperbolic cusp t 0 0 t as t moves away from zero cf 18 and 15 higher dimensional examples of hyperbolic manifolds deforming to properly convex manifolds with type 1 cusps can be found in 4 furthermore in subsequent work the authors will show that every generalized cusp arises as a deformation of a hyperbolic cusp in this way the domains of the form 1 2 0 have ideal boundary a 2 simplex the interior of one of the edges of consists of c 1 points and the remainder of the 1 skeleton of consists of non c 1 points in particular the fixed point of the radial flow is the intersection of the two edges of non c 1 points of see lemma 1 29 any lattice in t 1 2 0 acts properly discontinuously on thus c 1 2 0 has a manifold compactification by adjoining recently martin bobb produced the first examples of hyperbolic 3 manifolds with type 2 cusps 6 roughly speaking his examples are constructed by starting with a certain arithmetic hyperbolic 3 manifold and successively bending along a pair of orthogonal totally geodesic hypersurfaces the first author has also been able to show using different techniques that there are infinitely many hyperbolic 1 cusped hyperbolic 3 manifolds that admit properly convex structures with type 2 cusps see 2 finally the domains of the form 1 2 3 also have ideal boundary consisting of a 2 simplex however in this case each point of the 1 skeleton of is a non c 1 point as in the previous case if is a lattice in t 1 2 3 then acts properly discontinuously on and there is a compactification of c by adjoining there are examples of properly convex deformations of the complete hyperbolic structure on finite volume hyperbolic 3 manifolds whose topological ends are of the form 1 2 3 where t 1 2 3 the first such examples were constructed by benoist 5 using coxeter orbifolds these ideas were extended and generalized by marquis in 27 allowing him to construct further examples other examples were constructed for the figure eight knot complement and the figure eight sister by gye seon lee 24 his examples are constructed by gluing together two projective ideal tetrahedra using the combinatorial pattern that produces the figure eight knot complement see chapter 3 of 33 for details subsequent work of the first author j danciger and g s lee showed that any finite volume hyperbolic 3 manifold that satisfies a mild cohomological condition that is known to be satisfied by infinitely many hyperbolic 3 manifolds for example by applying 23 theorem 1 4 to the whitehead link also admits deformations all of whose ends are projectively equivalent to 1 1 1 where t 1 1 1 thus producing many additional examples furthermore as explained in section 1 4 the lack of c 1 points in the 1 skeleton of the ideal bound ary allows properly convex manifolds with ends projectively equivalent to quotients of 1 2 3 to sometimes be glued together to produce new properly convex manifold this idea is explored in detail in 3 and using these techniques it is possible to find properly convex projective structures on non hyperbolic 3 manifolds this was first done by
