the existence problem of proper actions of sl 2 r on homoge neous spaces g h of reductive type based on kobayashi s properness criterion math ann 1989 we show that g h admits a proper sl 2 r action via g if a maximally split abelian subspace of lie h is included in the wall defined by a restricted root of lie g we also give a number of examples of such g h keywords proper actions homogeneous spaces lie groups mathematics subject classification 2010 57 s 30 22 e 40 1 introduction and main results in the present paper we find a number of examples of homogeneous spaces g h of reductive type which admit proper actions of sl 2 r our method is based on the criterion of proper actions established by kobayashi 9 see theorem 2 1 below to begin with let us recall the definition of proper action let l be a locally compact topological group acting continuously on a locally compact hausdorff topological space x this action is said to be proper if for every compact subset s x the set ls g l g s s 6 is compact the action is called properly discontinuous if it is proper and the topology of l is discrete a general study of discontinuous groups for homogeneous spaces g h with h non compact was initiated by kobayashi 9 in full generality following the survey 14 we recall some of the general problems and perspectives as below let g be a lie group and h a closed subgroup of g a discrete subgroup of g is said to be a 1 http arxiv org abs 1405 4167 v 3 discontinuous group for the homogeneous space g h if the natural action on g h is properly discontinuous and fixed point free for such the quotient space g h is a smooth manifold to be referred to as a clifford klein form see 9 in more detail g h has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the quotient map g h g h is a c covering thus any g invariant local geometric structure on g h descends onto g h this opens a perspective of applying results on the existence of such groups in geometry if g h is compact we say that g h admits a compact clifford klein form the problem of finding discontinuous groups for g h is straightforward when h is compact in such cases any discrete subgroup of g acts properly discontinuously on g h so the interesting case is when h is non compact for instance if rankrg rankrh then only finite groups can act properly discontinuously on g h it is the calabi markus phenomenon see 3 and 9 one of effective ways of constructing properly discontinuous groups for g h is to find closed lie subgroups l of g acting properly on g h then any torsion free discrete subgroup of l is a discontinuous group for g h for homogeneous spaces g h of reductive type many results for closed lie subgroups l of g acting properly on g h can be found in 1 7 8 12 13 15 17 18 22 one of the most important results in this area is kobayashi s criterion 9 of the properness of the l action on g h in terms of lie algebras of g h and l see section 2 for more details we are interested in homogeneous spaces g h of reductive type which admits proper actions of sl 2 r throughout this paper we use the following terminology definition 1 1 we say that a homogeneous space g h admits a proper sl 2 r action via g if there exists a lie group homomorphism sl 2 r g such that the action of sl 2 r on g h induced by is proper in definition 1 1 the image sl 2 r in g of is isomorphic to sl 2 r or psl 2 r note that by the lifting theorem of surface groups cf 16 discontinuous groups for g h which is isomorphic to the surface group 1 g for some g 2 can be constructed as discrete subgroups of sl 2 r kulkarni 17 studies parameters p q such that sp q o p 1 q o p q admitting proper sl 2 r actions via o p 1 q in general semisimple symmetric spaces g h admitting proper sl 2 r actions via g are classified by teduka 22 and the third author 18 continuing this line of research in 2 the first and the fourth authors give a sufficient condition on the lie algebra data of the pair g h which implies the existence of non virtually abelian discontinuous groups for g h 2 this enabled them to extend results of 1 to homogeneous spaces generated by automorphisms of order 3 in this paper based on kobayashi s properness criterion 9 we show a sufficient condition on homogeneous spaces g h for the existence of proper sl 2 r actions via g our main theorems are stated in theorems 1 2 and 1 3 below let g be a connected non compact real semisimple linear lie group a cartan involution on g and h a stable closed subgroup of g then g h is of reductive type we take maximally split abelian subspaces ag ah of g lie g h lie h respectively with ah ag see section 2 for the notation the restricted root system of g ag is denoted by g a g theorem 1 2 assume that there exists g such that ah 0 then the homogeneous space g h admits a proper sl 2 r action via g we remark that the assumption of theorem 1 2 depends only on g h but not on the choice of ag and ah ag the next result yields a class of homogeneous spaces for which the condition of theorem 1 2 is easy to check theorem 1 3 for each g we take a closed lie subgroup h h of g such that lie h zg a zg a where a is the coroot of then the homogeneous space g h admits a proper sl 2 r action via g note that in the setting of theorem 1 3 h lie h is the semisimple part of the levi subalgebra zg a of g families of examples of theorem 1 2 and 1 3 are given in section 4 in greater detail let g be a split real form of a complex semisimple lie algebra and h a regular semisimple subalgebra of g lieg using the classification results of oshima 19 on s closed subsystems of root systems we can always check whether or not g h satisfies the assumption of theorem 1 2 then as in tables 1 and 2 below we obtain a number of examples g h satisfying the assumption in theorem 1 2 furthermore for non split g we also obtain some examples of g h in theorem 1 3 as in table 3 below we also study homogeneous spaces g h of reductive type admitting proper sl 2 r actions via g in the cases where the center of h is compact and rankr h 1 see section 4 3 acknowledgment the third author is supported by jsps kakenhi grant num ber jp 16 k 17594 in this work 3 2 kobayashi s properness criterion in this section we recall kobayashi s properness criterion 9 theorem 4 1 in a form that we shall need let g be a connected real semisimple lie group with its lie algebra g we fix a cartan decomposition g k p and a maximal abelian subspace ag of p such subspace ag of g is unique up to the adjoint action of g and called a maximally split abelian subspace of g let us denote by g and wg the restricted root system of g ag and the weyl group of g acting on ag respectively throughout this paper a closed lie subgroup h of g is said to be reductive in g if there exists a cartan involution on g such that h is stable then h is reductive as a lie group the converse is not true in general for such a closed subgroup h of g ah denotes a subspace of ag which is conjugate to a maximally split abelian subspace of h that is there exists g g and a cartan involution on g with h h such that ad g ah ph where h kh ph denotes the cartan decomposition of h lieh by such a subspace ah of ag is unique up to the conjugations by the weyl gourp wg let us fix closed subgroups h and l which are both reductive in g the lie algebras of h and l are denoted by h and l respectively we fix subspaces ah and al of ag as above the following simple criterion by kobayashi 9 for the properness of the action of l on g h is the crucial tool of this paper theorem 2 1 9 theorem 4 1 the following three conditions on g h l are equivalent i the l action on g h is proper ii the h action on g l is proper iii ah wgal 0 in ag let us consider the cases where l sl 2 r a triple a x y of vectors in g is called the sl 2 triple if a x 2 x a y 2 y and x y a then there exists a lie group homomorphism sl 2 r g with d 1 0 0 1 a d 0 1 0 0 x d 0 0 1 0 y 4 indeed the lie algebra homomorphism d sl 2 r g defined by the sl 2 triple a x y can be lifted to sl 2 r g since the complexification sl 2 c of sl 2 r is simply connected as a corollary to theorem 2 1 for l sl 2 r we have the following claim corollary 2 2 18 corollary 5 5 let g be a connected semisimple linear lie group and h a closed subgroup of g which is redctive in g for a given sl 2 triple a x y in g we denote by sl 2 r g the corresponding lie group homomorphism then the following two conditions on g h are equivalent i the sl 2 r action on g h induced by is proper ii the adjoint orbit through a in g does not meet h it should be remarked that in the case where a a the second condition in theorem 2 2 is equivalent to the condition that a w ah 3 proofs of theorem 1 2 and theorem 1 3 let g be a non compact real semisimple lie algebra we take a maximally split abelian subalgebra ag and denote by g a g the restricted root system of g ag as before we show the following lemma lemma 3 1 there exists an sl 2 triple a x y in g such that a 6 0 for any g it should be noted that the claim of the lemma above can be found in 5 section 4 without proofs for the convenience of the readers we give a proof as follows proof of lemma 3 1 the proof is similar to that of in the complex case see 4 theroem 4 1 6 let us fix a simple system g of the restricted root system g we denote by a ag the unique element in ag such that a 2 for all g it is enough to show that there exists x y g such that a x y is an sl 2 triple in g for each g we denote by a the coroot of then it is well known that there exist x g and y g such that a x y is an sl 2 triple in g here g is the root space of in g not in gc since a g is a basis of ag the element a ag can be written as a g a a for some a r g let 5 us put x g x and y g a y we shall prove that a x y is an sl 2 triple we see that a x g a x 2 x a y g a a y 2 y recall that since g is a simple system is not a root in g for any g therefore x y 0 if 6 and hence we have x y g a x y g a x y g a a a this completes the proof now we are ready to prove theorem 1 2 proof of theorem 1 2 there exists g such that ah 0 and hence ah is contained in the wall c v ag v 0 defined by by lemma 3 1 there exists an sl 2 r triple a x y in g such that a 6 0 for any g therefore a does not lie in the walls in ag hence we see that the orbit of the weyl group through a does not meet ah the proof is completed by corollary 2 2 using theorem 1 2 we prove theorem 1 3 as follows proof of theorem 1 3 recall that a is a coroot of g and h lie h zg a zg a therefore v ag v 0 is a maximally split abelian subspace of h thus theorem 1 3 follows from theorem 1 2 4 examples 4 1 examples from theorem 1 2 the split case let be a reduced root system as in 19 we say that a subset of is an s closed subsystem if for any with note that any s closed 6 subsystem of is a subsystem of in the sense of 19 that is s for any where s is the reflection on a through the hyperplane perpendicular to let us fix a reduced root system and an s closed subsystem of we denote by g a split real form of a complex semisimple lie algebra corresponding to we fix a maximally split abelian subspace a of g and then is realized as the restricted root system of g a the root space decomposition of g by a can be written as g a g for the s closed subsystem of we define a semisimple subalgebra h by h a g where a is the subspace of a spaned by the set of all coroots of then h is an a regular semisimple subalgebra of g in the sence of 6 that is h is semisimple and normalized by a conversely any a regular semisimple subalgebra of g can be obtained as h for an s closed subsystem of let us take a connected semisimple linear lie group g and its closed subgroup h with lieg g and lieh h then by theorem 1 2 g h admits a proper sl 2 r action via g if 0 for any 6 in 19 the classification of s closed subsystems of irreducible reduced root systems with 6 can be found in tables 10 1 and 10 2 using this classification we obtain a number of examples of homogeneous spaces g h admitting proper sl 2 r actions via g in tables 1 and 2 we give a complete list of pairs of irreducibe reduced root systems such that can be realized as an s closed subsystem of with 6 4 2 examples from theorem 1 3 we describe a procedure to construct examples of homogeneous spaces g h of re ductive type admitting proper sl 2 r actions via
