a higgs mass at 125 gev calculated from neutron to proton decay in a u 3 lie group hamiltonian framework ole l trinhammer department of physics technical university of denmark fysikvej building 307 dk 2800 kongens lyngby denmark eu we investigate the neutron to proton decay via a higgs mechanism in the framework of a rein terpreted kogut susskind hamiltonian on the lie group u 3 we calculate expressions for a scalar higgs mass an electroweak energy scale and vector gauge boson masses which all compare well with observed or derived values our sole ad hoc inputs to the calculations are the classical electron radius and the weak mixing angle our result for the higgs mass relative to the electron mass involves only mathematical constants and the fine structure constant it yields 125 1 gev for a fine structure constant taken as a geometric mean between it s sliding scale values at respectively the electron mass and the w vector boson mass which are both involved in the neutron decay in pass ing we compare with the neutral flavour baryon spectrum and mention an approximate calculation of the relative neutron to proton mass ratio of 0 13847 percent which is promisingly close to the

the electroweak interactions 5 6 7 8 9 the goal is to reduce the number of ad hoc pa rameters in the description of baryon phenomena here we restrict our inputs to the above mentioned scale and the weak mixing angle w in that way we can express in terms of the fine structure constant e 2 4 0 c 4 10 and the weak mixing angle all masses coming out of the model relative to the value of the electron

bloch degree of freedom we shall argue that the bloch degrees of freedom are opened by a higgs mechanism that will allow a diminishing of the ground state eigenvalue via the creation of the e el doublet and it s coupling to a higgs field for instance the ground state eigenvalue en e 1 e 2 e 3 4 47 of 12 is lowered to a value ep e 1 e 2 e 3 4 46 for real symmetry broken states of parametric eigenvalues e 1 3 fig 2 parametric eigenfunctions from 14 the period doubling right in the diminished state for level two is paired with an augmented period doubled state for level one above fig 3

description of the decay of an excited state in an atom where the electron position coordinates act as dy namical variables here a spontaneous transition takes place in the electronic level structure through a coupling to the photon field i e a photon is created at a ran dom point and emitted in a random direction to exterior space in our case the interior baryon configuration space is the analogue of the atom as an entire structure now with non spatial configuration variables that project to exterior space as field variables in a one dimensional analogue of standard procedures in electroweak theory 7 we allow for a local phase vari ation e iq in with q soon to be identified with the electric charge coupling constant e thus we consider the local transformation x x e iq x x 18 following mcmahon 7 we have the standard lagrangian l d d w 1 4 f f 19 for and the local transformation by related to a gauge field b b b b 20 the gauge field renders the lagrangian invariant under the transformation in 18 by the action of the general ized derivative d iqb 21 we presume the neutron decay to be mediated through energetically favourable period doublings allowed in the periodic potential 6 for parametric eigenfunctions see fig 3 these period doublings correspond to sudden jumps of from one trough to a neighbouring one we therefore consider the restriction of w to a specific section like w 1 2 2 2 22 neighbouring to the generic section at n 0 the section 22 has a minimum at 2 and we investigate perturba tions around this using 17 2 2 h x 2 1 2 v h x 23 we have absorbed the scaled energy dimension 2 into dimensionful entities v 2 v and h h 26 and anticipated the factor 1 2 in the mass term in the lagrangian below by introducing the factor 1 2 in the expression above the lagrangian for the pertubing field h x and the related gauge field b now also scaled by is found by inserting in 19 the eqs 21 and 22 with substituted for according to 23 to give l 1 2 h h 1 2 h 2 2 1 2 qv 2 b b 1 2 q 2 h 2 b b 2 q h 2 b b 1 4 f f 24 from the coefficients of the quadratic terms h 2 and b b with q e 4 in 18 and with dimen sionless v 2 we read off the respective dimensionless masses mh and mb determined by 1 2 mh 2 1 2 1 2 and 1 2 mb 2 1 2 4 2 2 25 5 our length scale a in the hamiltonian originates in the classical electron radius mentioned in the introduction and thus our energy scale can be conveniently ex pressed in units of the electron mass me by mec 2 26 from the higgs mechanism above we therefore get for the scalar field mass mh mhc 2 mh 2 1 2 2 2 mec 2 27 which yields mh 125 1 gev for a geometric mean fine structure constant 132 42 1 between electron and vector boson energies the expression 27 con taining solely the electron mass and the fine structure constant and cited in 2 is determined by the trailing in 17 and by the structure of the potential 22 and therefore remains valid below similarly we would get mb c 2 78 gev however for the vector gauge field masses corresponding to mb we need to consider the full electroweak su 2 l u 1 treatment to give the results in 2 4 a full two component higgs mechanism the symmetry breaks introduced by the bloch phase factors in the parametric eigenstates gp in 15 have to come in pairs of half odd integer valued bloch wave num bers 1 2 in order to kill the singularity in the cen trifugal potential c 1 2 4 3 3 i j 1 8 sin 2 1 2 i j 28 generalizing our ansatz we take the paired period dou blings corresponding to the shift in fig 3 from 1 2 0 0 to 1 2 12 1 2 to be mediated by a higgs mechanism with a complex two component doublet 1 2 29 to absorb phase changes and a two component elec tronic lepton lel e e l 30 to take care of the remaining degrees of freedom in common and lel are topological moulds with the neces sary degrees of freedom to absorb the kinematics of the liberated energy and to mirror the topological changes in the nucleon state following from the parametric pe riod doublings in the neutron to proton transformation indicated in fig 3 and 15 following cornwell aitchi son hey and weinberg 27 9 28 we perform a transfor mation such that 0 31 has the individual real valued component vacuum expec tation values 0 and 0 v 2 for our case 22 23 we have v 2 2 32 which relates the electroweak scale to the scale of the strong interactions and which can now be inserted into the standard results from the electroweak theory 29 30 mw c 2 v g 2 mzc 2 v g 2 g 2 2 33 where the su 2 coupling constant g and the u 1 cou pling constant g are given from the electric charge cou pling constant e 4 and the electroweak mixing angle w by g e sin w g e cos w 34 when 32 26 and 34 are used in 33 the results in 2 follow readily with no ad hoc 4 term in the higgs mechanism with weinberg salam 31 we could assume a yukawa coupling lagrangian term 28 32 to yield a direct determination of the yukawa coupling constant ge ge 2 mec 2 v it should further be noted that weinberg s value for ge 2 07 10 6 follows from a de termination of v from the fermi coupling constant gf whereas in our model ge 2 04 10 6 is determined di rectly by a sliding scale geometric mean 1 132 42 from 3 in that way the fermi coupling constant be comes a derived quantity gf c 3 1 2 1 v 2 1 8 2 4 1 mec 2 2 35 it is not clear at which energy should be taken in 35 in 2 we give results for a geometric mean between elec tronic and vector bosonic energies in field theory terms our results are only to lowest order thus the exact factor two between the electroweak scale v and the higgs mass mh is not supposed to hold in individual sliding scale treatments 5 conclusion with just two ad hoc inputs the classical electron radius which gives our scale and the weak mixing angle we have investigated the neutron decay specifically we have investigated a higgs mechanism for paramet ric period doublings of two coupled toroidal degrees of 6 freedom in the configuration variables describing a shift from parametric eigenstates involved in a neutronic state to parametric eigenstates involved in a protonic state on the lie group u 3 in that way we have related the strong and electroweak energy scales the common scale of our hamiltonian for baryonic phenomena expresses the scalar higgs and vector gauge boson masses in units of the electron mass the result for the higgs mass is 125 gev for a fine structure constant taken as a geomet ric mean between electronic to vector bosonic regimes in passing we have related to a fermi coupling constant prediction given an approximate result without any ad hoc parameters for the relative neutron to proton mass ratio in promising agreement with the experimentally de termined value and we have shown a construction of the neutral flavour baryon spectrum all comparisons with observations agree at a percent or a sub percent level and should encourage further study within the model in a further perspective we have suggested to look for a mesonic sector of the model based on a conjectured inter action term more readily we suggest to look for exactly solvable constructions of protonic states and to discuss interpretations of the model acknowledgments
