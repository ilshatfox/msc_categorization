the higgs mass derived from the u 3 lie group ole l trinhammer henrik g bohr mogens stibius jensen technical university of denmark dk 2800 kongens lyngby denmark corresponding author the higgs mass value is derived from a hamiltonian on the lie group u 3 where we relate strong and electroweak energy scales the baryon states of nucleon and delta resonances originate in specific bloch wave degrees of freedom coupled to a higgs mechanism which also gives rise to the usual gauge boson masses the derived higgs mass is around 125 gev from the same hamiltonian we derive the relative neutron to proton mass ratio and the n and delta mass spectra all compare rather well with the experimental values we predict scarce neutral flavor baryon singlets that should be visible in scattering cross sections for negative pions on protons in photoproduction on neutrons in neutron diffraction dissociation experiments and in invariant mass spectra of protons and negative pions in b decays the fundamental predictions are based on just one length scale and the fine structure constant more particular predictions rely also on the weak mixing angle and the up down quark flavor mixing matrix

higgs mecha nism fifty years ago 1 5 and especially after the experi mental findings and confirmations of the higgs particle during the last two years 6 9 the big question is how to calculate it s mass because the standard model did not contain a recipe for that to remedy this we make a step towards a unification of the quantum chromo dynamics of strong interactions with the quantum flavor dynamics of electroweak interactions to make the step we digress from quantum field theory into a common u 3 configu ration space where color and flavor are intermingled at first sight this might seem confusing but we shall show how one can project out both quark and gluon fields with the usual transformation properties the standard model contains quite a few unexplained parameters such as the six quark mass parameters the three angles and one phase of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ckm mixing matrix 10 the several coefficients and exponents of each parton distribution function and a similar wealth for the six leptons the strong and elec troweak interactions are described by seemingly indepen dent gauge groups su 3 and u 2 su 2 u 1 11 baryons feel both interactions wherefore we seek a de scription from a common lie group background the simplest choice is u 3 which contains su 3 su 2 and u 1 as exemplar subsgroups with this choice we can reduce considerably the number of parameters needed to describe baryon mass spectra and the higgs mass we stress that the group u 3 is generated from three para metric momentum operators three parametric angular momentum operators and three remaining runge lenz like operator components to connect the algebra the six latter can be seen as intrinsic editions of the gener ators of the lorentz algebra 12 with three dimensions in laboratory space r 3 the group manifold u 3 there fore becomes the natural choice for intrinsic degrees of freedom that can be kinematically excited from labora tory space the dynamics of the intrinsic degrees of free dom is projected back to laboratory space in the shape of quantum fields of various structures depending on the projection base chosen a mixing between such projec tions becomes natural when one considers that the re lated subgroups are intermingled in the common u 3 configuration this conception may open for a derivation of ckm matrix elements although that is far beyond the scope of the present work we shall however make a first step to correlate the strong and electroweak inter actions of baryons namely in a derivation of the higgs mass in this paper we derive fundamental mass values for higgs and gauge bosons and report on mass values for the n and baryon spectrum with dynamics described from a lie group perspective the derived higgs mass around 125 gev corresponds rather well to the recent experimental results 8 9 as seen in fig 1 and is based on just one dimensionful parameter in such a way that the ratio between the higgs mass and the electron mass apart from mathematical constants contains only the fine structure constant of other papers analyzing the higgs mass are composite models like the one by dhar mandal and wadia 14 related to the gross neveu model 15 with a nambu jona lasinio type 16 four fermion coupling leading to a dynamically generated higgs mass without the need for an a priori higgs potential one of us has previously introduced the lie group u 3 as configuration space 17 18 it contains the usual gauge groups su 3 of strong interactions and su 2 u 1 of electroweak interactions the essential frame to be ar x iv 1 50 3 00 62 0 v 2 ph

result dotted green in 73 from a common lie group perspective for strong and electroweak interactions the curve widths represent the standard deviations of the respective mass peak determinations and not the resonance width which is much smaller 13 adopted here complies with local gauge symmetry when the intrinsic lie group dynamics is projected to labora tory space each point p x y z in space is equipped with an intrinsic u 3 configuration space in which the fundamental dynamics is formulated with u ei u 3 as configuration variable thus our configuration space is orthogonal to the space time manifold of the laboratory space the closest analogue we can think of is that of intrinsic spin in the present case the intrinsic space con tains both color spin isospin and hypercharge degrees of freedom we thus can capture both the strong and elec troweak sections of baryon phenomena a major motiva tion is to reduce the number of ad hoc mass parameters in baryon phenomena relative to the standard model as a benefit of intermingling the gauge groups of the stan dard model in a common intrinsic space the parameters in the higgs potential and the electroweak energy scale are determined from the relation to the intrinsic baryon potential and the missing resonance problem in baryon spectroscopy vanishes we do not expect to capture the meson sector since mesons are interaction quanta i e field constructions in laboratory space our basic frame is a hamiltonian structure on the lie group u 3 as a configuration space for baryons we consider baryons as stationary states with masses mc 2 fig 2 projection of the lie group configuration space to the algebraic parameter space 17 the algebra approximates the group in the neighbourhood of the origo the projection is scaled by the classical electron radius re as a measure for the extension of the charge scar created in the neutron decay this corresponds excellently to the measured value for the neutron to electron mass ratio see fig 5 e

but differ for larger deviations of the configuration variable both will yield the same higgs and gauge boson masses but differ in the baryon mass spectra because the higgs mass is determined from the shared second order term near potential minima where the algebra approxi mates the group whereas the baryon states occupy all of the intrinsic geometry therefore the manton like poten 3 fig 3 all observed four star n and baryons boxes com pared with approximate predictions black red and dashed lines from eq 25 the dashed lines represent neutral fla vor singlets particular for the present model the red lines mark states with augmented contribution in level 3 the boxes indicate the experimental range of pole positions 33 not the resonance widths which are much larger we have made no estimate of mass shifts due to strong coupling to decay channels 34 digits at selected predictions are parametric la bels p q r based on table i note the fine agreement in the grouping and the number of resonances in both sectors with no missing resonance problem as opposed to ordinary quark models see fig 8 tial better reproduces the baryon spectrum see fig 3 we also prefer the manton like potential because in the parametrization of the configuration space it represents the euclidean measure folded onto the group manifold 32 note finally as the configuration space is truly intrin sic relativity only comes into play once the inherent dy namics in 1 is projected to space as when the parton distribution functions in fig 10 below were derived in ref 17 in sec 2 we describe the model in secs 3 and 4 we carry through particular solutions for the baryon spec trum and discuss experimental predictions for unconven tional baryon singlets in sec 5 we describe projections to laboratory space where quantum fields resurface in sec 6 we state a relation between strong and electroweak configurations and derive a higgs mass in sec 7 we re late to standard results for the vector gauge bosons in sec 8 we give remarks on interpretations and in sec 9 we suggest lines of future study 2 unfolding the model one may consider the basic equation 1 as an effective theory inspired by lattice gauge theory 19 21 however we prefer to present it as detached from this framework such that the configuration space and the space time manifold orthogonal to it are both continuous in the basic equa tion 1 c a 1 2 1 2 tr 2 u e u the wavefunction is a function of u ei u 3 analogously to the euclidean laplacian in polar coordi nates e polar 1 r 2 r r 2 r 1 r 2 l 2 2 here the laplacian in 1 can be parametrized in a polar decomposition 35 1 3 j 1 1 j 2 j j 2 j 3 i j k 6 i j k 2 k m 2 k 8 sin 2 1 2 i j 3 where j are the eigenangles in the three eigenvalues e i j of u and j is the van de monde determinant 89 the ja cobian of our parametrization 36 j 3 i j 2 sin 1 2 i j 4 in mathematical terms kk and mk are off toroidal derivatives which are non commuting and may be repre sented by off diagonal gell mann matrices see 15 and 16 below the triple kk commute as body fixed angu lar momentum operators and mk connect the algebra by commuting into the subspace of kk mk ml kk kl i km 5 cyclic in k l m the components of k k 1 k 2 k 3 which are su 2 generators and m m 1 m 2 m 3 in the laplacian carry spin and flavor interpreting k as an intrinsic spin operator is supported by the reversed sign in the commutator like for body fixed coordinate systems in nuclear physics the potential in 1 depends only on the eigenvalues of u since the trace is invariant under conjugation u vuv 1 by any v u 3 in particular a conjugation that diagonalizes u thus tr 2 d 2 e u d 2 e vuv 1 d 2 v vu 6 here e is the neutral element the origo of u 3 the last expression shows that the potential is left invariant as are the coordinate fields that we shall soon introduce in the above parametrization the potential reads 1 2 tr 2 w w 1 w 2 w 3 7 4 fig 4 periodic parametric potential 8 as a function of eigenangles of the u 3 configuration variable i e a sum of periodic parametric potentials see fig 4 w 1 2 n 2 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 n z 8 the potential may be considered as the euclidean mea sure folded into the group manifold 32 in compliance with the space projection 13 below now each of the nine generators tk of u 3 implies directional derivatives locally at each point u u 3 or so called left invariant coordinate fields k uei tk 0 uitk 9 with related differential forms d k also called exterior derivatives d k m km for the three toroidal de grees of freedom we use the angular symbols j the quantization inherent in the basic equation 1 can then be expressed in a generalized action angle form as d i j ij j i ij 10 where d i are the torus forms and ij is the kronecker delta by construction the act of the exterior derivative by a generator x in the lie algebra on a function at a point u in the lie group manifold is xu d u x d dt uetx t 0 11 this was used 17 to generate the parton distributions in fig 10 the three toroidal generators tj i j i j e j 1 2 3 correspond to parametric momenta pj i 1 a j a tj 12 and thus corresponding to a space projection xi a i 13 we have the standard commutators pj a i i ij 14 in the above coordinate representation 37 the off toroidal generators read 17 k 1 a 2 p 3 a 3 p 2 7 k 2 a 1 p 3 a 3 p 1 5 k 3 a 1 p 2 a 2 p 1 2 15 and m 3 1 2 a 2 2 p 1 p 2 1 m 2 3 1 a 2 2 p 3 p 1 4 m 1 2 3 a 2 2 p 2 p 3 6 16 the lambdas are gell mann generators 37 from these and y 1 6 21 2 2 2 2 3 1 6 a 2 2 p 21 p 2 2 2 p 2 3 8 3 2 i 3 1 2 21 2 2 1 2 a 2 2 p 21 p 2 2 3 17 the spectrum of m 2 was found to be 17 m 2 4 3 n 3 2 2 k k 1 3 1 3 y 2 4 i 23 n 0 1 2 3 18 where y and i 3 are hypercharge and isospin three component quantum numbers the minimum value for the positive definite m 2 is 13 4 in the case of spin 1 2 hypercharge 1 and isospin 1 2 as for the nucleon from here we are able to find specific solutions pre sented in secs 3 and 4 2 1 on flavor degrees of freedom the dynamics underlying the baryon mass spec troscopy in the present model is determined primarily by an intrinsic potential in the lie group namely the sec ond term in 1 as for flavor degrees of freedom these are contained in the laplacian on u 3 the laplacian can be parametrized in a polar decomposition with three toroidal abelian derivatives and six off torus derivatives 3 the latter correspond to the six off diagonal gell mann matrices 15 and 16 three of these we interpret as spin generators and the remaining three are related to the isospin and hypercharge of the standard suf 3 al gebra 18 the last term in the laplacian 3 the centrifugal term can be integrated by exploiting the existence of the haar measure over 4 5 9 by the factorization in 22 below further we use that the off toroidal part of the wavefunction is an eigenstate of k 2 and m 2 together with the fact that the centrifugal term is symmetric under interchange of the torus angles j 5 the centrifugal term leads to a mass formula of the well known okubo type 38 the spectrum of k 2 m 2 follows directly from 18 to yield k k 1 m 2 4 3 n 3 2 2 3 1 3 y 2 4 i 23 19 it is natural in the present framework to classify the eigenstates according to the three independent values of n y and i 3 however we can make a transformation of this classification into the familiar one by rewriting the expression 19 and choose the sum of n and y to be a constant for n y 2 which yields the lowest possible k k 1 m 2 we get k k 1 m 2 40 3 k 23 m 2 3 28 3 y 4 1 4 y 2 i i 1 20 since k 23 m 2 3 commutes with both y and i 2 we get for a given value of the quantum number k 23 m 2 3 k k 1 m 2 a b y c 1 4 y 2 i i 1 21 with the constants a 40 3 k 23 m 2 3 b 28 3 c 4 respectively equation 21 is the famous okubo mass formula that reproduces the gell mann okubo ne eman mass rela tions within the baryon n octet and decuplet 38 41 in dependently of the values of a b and c of course this is only accurate if one chooses the same toroidal wave function for all members of a given multiplet in practice the su 3 symmetry breaking in 21 will be influenced by the dependence in the centrifugal term because dif ferent values of k 2 m 2 lead to different values of the centrifugal potential and thereby influence which span of toroidal energy eigenstates will project out on a specific angular momentum eigenstate in the laboratory there fore the suf 3 symmetry break will not follow exactly 21 in hypercharge 2 2 on color degrees of freedom hadronic phenomena are traditionally described in the standard model with interactions shaped by the gauge groups suc 3 of their strong color interactions and su 2 u 1 of their electroweak interactions the model 1 uses the compact lie group u 3 as in trinsic configuration space the maximal torus of u 3 has three dimensions which we interpret as color degrees of freedom we start off in a hamiltonian framework with the hamiltonian operating on states u where u is the configuration variable belonging to the lie group u 3 we can generate su 3 transforming color quark 34 and gluon fields 45 below from the exterior deriva tive on scaled in measure by the jacobian 4 of the polar decomposition summing over such color compo nents 34 for particular flavor tracks led to u and d va lence quark parton distribution functions fig 10 for an approximate protonic state via projections along mixed toroidal directions 17 the parton distribution functions compare well with those established for the proton because the dynamical structure is formulated on the lie group it will show different manifestations depending on which derivatives 11 one is taking for instance the three toroidal dimensions for the color quark degrees of freedom are intermingled with flavor degrees of freedom since the hypercharge and isospin 3 component genera tors y and i 3 are not linearly independent of the three torodial generators t 1 t 2 t 3 and both are intermin gled with the eight gluon dimensions laid out by the gell mann matrices 45 because these include genera tors proportional to y and i 3 thus we do not consider color and flavor degrees of freedom as being independent for instance the distribution functions in fig 10 are produced by using the exterior derivative 34 on tracks from the quark flavor generators 17 tu 2 3 t 1 t 3 and td 1 3 t 1 t 3 we actually see the reduction in the number of independent quark degrees of freedom as a reason that the baryon spectrum from 1 is not ham pered by missing resonances as usual in ordinary quark models qms compare figs 3 and 8 3 specific solutions of the model i trigonometric base and the electron to neutron mass ratio it is possible to find the dimensionless eigenvalue for an unbroken neutron ground state en en in 1 with quite high precision by a rayleigh ritz method 42 we factorize the wavefuction in 1 into a toroidal part and an off torus part u 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 22 in that way 1 can be solved for specific choices of spin and flavor inflicted by the six off torus generators con tained in the laplacian after integration over the six off toroidal degrees of freedom 4 5 6 7 8 9 one ends up with a schro dinger equation 1 2 3 j 1 2 2 j v r 1 2 3 er 1 2 3 23 here r j with j from 4 and v 1 1 2 4 3 3 i j 1 8 sin 2 1 2 i j 24 w 1 w 2 w 3 contains in the second term contributions from off toroidal degrees of freedom that carry spin and flavor in the specific choice here of spin hypercharge and isospin s 1 2 y 1 i 1 2 the numerator 4 in front of the sum is the minimum value of k 2 m 2 2 for this 6 combination as well as for s 3 2 y 1 i 3 2 corre sponding to the choices respectively of n 1 and n 2 in 18 the term correponds to the centrifugal poten tial when solving the hydrogen atom in polar coordinates 2 the constant term is a global curvature term 43 aris ing from differentiating through j 2 in the laplacian 3 the measure scaled toroidal wavefunction r can be expanded on solutions b to the separable problem 1 2 3 j 1 2 2 j w b 1 2 3 eb 1 2 3 25 due to the arbitrary labeling of the eigenangles j the toroidal wavefunction is symmetric in these and as j is antisymmetric so must be r j therefore solu tions to 23 and 25 can be constructed from slater determinants 44 bpqr ijkbp i bq j br k 26 where p q r are natural number labels for orthogonal so lutions to the one dimensional scho dinger equation 1 2 2 2 w bp epbp 27 with periodic parametric potential this is postponed to sec 4 here we will use an expansion set where the necessary integrals for the rayleigh ritz procedure can be found analytically the measure scaled toroidal part r of the wavefunction is expanded on trigonometric slater determinants fpqr 1 2 3 ijk cos p i sin q j cos r k 28 where p q r are integers p 0 1 2 p 1 q 1 2 3 p r p 1 p 2 p the order parameter p determines the number of independent states on which we expand the value p 12 corresponds to 936 expansion functions and yields en 4 3849 whereas p 18 with 3078 expansion functions yields

derivation on rm by using the pullback function f x 1 rm r one can then differentiate f x 1 in the ordinary way this idea is readily generalized to a complex valued function and in the present case the manifold m could be u 3 and the then complex valued function f could be either the wavefunction or its measure scaled partner now in particular j e dre j r j belongs to the tangent space tme of the maximal torus m at e and therefore so does their sum e as in general j u tmu the set of generators itj are the coordinate field generators j which also constitute an induced base from parameter

space for the color algebra su 3 at a particular point p x y z in laboratory space we may thus introduce at p complex valued components j for the color vector and write 1 c 1 2 c 2 3 c 3 1 2 3 39 in the above representation u will be represented by a 3 3 matrix u for rotations under v su 3 at p we then have cj c j v cj 40 and u u v uv 1 41 from 40 and 41 we can derive the transformation property

fundamental repre sentation under su 3 rotations in other words left translation in group space projects out as su 3 rotation in projection space we thus interpret as a quark field with three color components which may be projected on a specific base like in 39 the distributions 17 in fig 10 are for tu 2 3 t 1 t 3 and td 13 t 1 t 3 likewise the gluon fields may be seen as resulting from a projection on adjoint representation spaces of an ex pansion of the momentum form corresponding to the full set of eight generators k needed to parametrize the general group element u ei k k separating out a phase factor 61 thus for each generator ta we have left invariant vector fields a defined as a ei ktkei ta 0 uita 43 where ta i a i a e we now choose the set ta as a base for the

represented by the second term in 49 note further that translational invariance in group space corresponds to an su 3 rotational invariance in repre sentation space and thereby the translational invariance of the interaction potential 6 in group space through the projections 13 and 34 reflects the gauge invari ance of the fields in laboratory space 6 an exemplar higgs mechanism for the neutron decay we want to relate the strong interaction dynamics in herent in 1 to the electroweak interaction involved in e g the decay of the neutron to the proton we settle the relation through the structure of the geodetic potential 8 supplemented by a trailing ansatz c 1 51 which balances the products of the coupling constants and the corresponding phase fields for the respec tive interactions namely a color field and a higgs field the color field is a space projection of an eigenangle dynamical variable from the description of the intrinsic configuration space and as such starts off dimensionless whereas or more precisely c has the dimension of energy 64 a certain caution is therefore needed when the geodetic potential for is to be translated into a potential for let us first look at the klein gordon lagrangian 65 for a scalar field of mass m l 1 2 1 2 mc 2 c 2 2 52 while in the following we set c 1 we still want to keep track of the length scale and we therefore write l 1 2 1 2 m a 2 2 53 here m is dimensionless while m m a represents the mass of dimension l 1 in usual c 1 notation thus the well known expression l 1 2 1 2 m 2 2 54 corresponding to the length scale a we have an energy scale c a which we shall settle below in 56 the dimensionless mass m is also given as m mc 2 in the higgs mechanism the mass term for a higgs particle field h equivalent to the mass term in 54 fol lows from the second order derivative of a higgs poten tial vh at a minimum point 0 6 0 the geodetic potential 4 has such minimum points off 0 which are activated in the neutron decay when parametric pe riod doublings occur the period doublings correspond to sudden jumps of from one trough of the geodetic potential to a neighbouring one we therefore consider a match of a higgs potential to a dimensionful edition w 1 2 0 2 55 of the geodetic potential 8 neighbouring to the generic n 0 section with the balancing trailing ansatz 51 we find that a jump from 0 to 2 corresponds to 0 2 56 to match 55 we introduce a constant term 2 in the exemplar higgs potential 66 67 to have vh 2 1 2 2 2 1 4 2 4 2 57 this potential as usual has minima at 20 2 2 note that the essential thing for the englert brout higgs gu ralnik hagen kibble mechanism 1 4 is not the particular shape 5 of vh but the fact that vh has a minimum for non zero for a real scalar we find 57 to match 55 in the neighbourhood of 0 for 2 1 8 20 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 20 58 see fig 11 with these choices w in 55 and vh in 57 both agree at 0 up to second order where v h 0 11 fig 11 a neighbouring trough in the periodic intrinsic po tential dashed red fitted by a lifted higgs potential solid blue in dotted green is shown the restriction 55 around the shifted minimum of the geodetic potential all three curves exhibit a harmonic form for small pertubations with the same second order mass term used to derive the higgs mass 63 and share the shift to derive the electroweak energy scale 70 2 2 for a complex 1 x i 2 x 2 we have minima in 57 for 0 e i 59 where is a real phase angle and for convenience we define v 2 0 v 0 since vh 0 h 2 1 2 2 1 2 h 2 1 4 2 20 h 2 2 h 2 60 1 2 2 h 2 we then get from standard derivations of higgs and gauge boson masses 68 71 a lagrangian for a higgs field h 2 pertubing around 0 v 2 and a related gauge field a l 1 2 h h 1 2 2 h 2 1 2 qv 2 a a 1 4 f f l 1 61 here we have hidden interaction terms in l 1 and the electric charge coupling constant q originates from the generalized derivative d iqa 62 from the coefficients of the quadratic terms h 2 and a a in 61 with q e 4 and v 2 we read off the respective masses mh and ma determined by mhc 2 1 2 2 2 2 mec 2 63 and mac 2 qv qv 4 2 64 in 63 above we have used that the length scale a in the hamiltonian in 1 relates to the classical electron radius mentioned in the introduction and thus the strong interaction energy scale can be conveniently expressed in units of the electron mass me by mec 2 65 in the neutron decay both an electron and a gauge boson are involved thus we use for the gauge mechanism as approximation for the geometric mean 1 1 me mz 132 41 66 between its known values around electronic energies 28 where 0 e 2 4 0 c 1 137 035999074 and at bosonic energies 29 where z 1 127 944 this yields mhc 2 125 0 gev in 63 see fig 1 for a comparison with observations the expression 63 containing solely the electron mass and the fine structure constant and cited again in 73 is determined by the trailing in 51 and by the struc ture of the potential 8 respectively 55 or 57 and therefore remains valid below similarly we would get mac 2 78 gev however for the vector gauge field masses corresponding to ma we need to consider the full electroweak su 2 l u 1 treatment to give the results in 73 note that the usual way of getting the masses for the massive gauge bosons is to derive v from the fermi cou pling constant in muon decay see e g 72 but we use 51 and 55 to give v 2 2 directly in 56 which leads to the values for mw and mz stated in 73 and following from the standard results in 71 in the next section 7 a full two component higgs mechanism the symmetry breaks introduced by the bloch phase factors in the parametric eigenstates gp in 29 have to come in pairs of half odd integer valued bloch wave num bers 1 2 in order to kill the singularity in the cen trifugal potential c 1 2 4 3 3 i j 1 8 sin 2

degrees inclined system of coordinates u t x y 2 x y 2 needed in order to find the matrix elements of the centrifugal potential the seemingly singular denom inator in the centrifugal potential 67 is then found to be integrable the domain of integration is expanded to suit the new set of variables this is possible because of the periodic ity of the trigonometric functions such that functional values on the hatched area outside the original domain of integration are identical by parallel transport from the hatched area within that same area pairs for instance 1 2 1 2 0 in that case we might expand on g couples gpqr gqpr eir 3 ei p q 1 2 2 2 i sin p q 1 2 2 68 which keep the integrated centrifugal potential regular 73 because p q remains integer see fig 12 here gpqr e ip 1 eiq 2 eir 3 69 generalizing the ansatz 51 we take the paired period doublings corresponding to the shift in fig 7 from 1 2 0 0 to 1 2 12 1 2 to be medi ated by a higgs field with a complex two component doublet 1 2 to absorb phase changes but not kinetic energy nor rest mass and a two component electronic lepton lel e e l to take care of the re maining degrees of freedom and carry away released en ergy following cornwell aitchison hey weinberg and lancaster blundell 68 71 we then transform to the indi vidual real valued component vacuum expectation values 0 and 0 0 v 2 in the present case 56 we have v 2 2 70 which relates the electroweak scale to the scale of the strong interactions and which can be inserted into the standard results from the electroweak theory 74 75 mw c 2 v g 2 mzc 2 v g 2 g 2 2 71 where the su 2 coupling constant g and the u 1 cou pling constant g are given from the electric charge cou pling constant e 4 and the electroweak mixing angle w by g e sin w g e cos w 72 when 70 65 and 72 are used in 71 together with 28 sin 2 mz 0 23116 we can collect our results for the higgs mh and the beta decay fermi coupling constant gf with values for the gauge boson masses mw mz mhc 2 2 2

in 63 and 73 were posted on the preprint archive 18 prior to newer announcements from the cms collaboration 8 and the atlas collaboration 9 the higgs mass should be compared to these experimental values 8 9 around mhc 2 125 gev namely 124 70 0 34 gev and 125 36 0 41 gev respectively the weighted average 76 of the cms and atlas results is 124 97 0 26 gev in fig 1 for the theoretical result we have used as standard deviation the difference of 0 062 gev between the higgs mass from the expression in 73 with either mz or the sliding scale estimate 45 47 for mh in 66 the latter gives mhc 2 124 986 gev in stead of mhc 2 125 048 gev from 66 the beta decay fermi coupling constant in 73 is related to the muon decay fermi coupling constant 28 gf 1 1663787 10 5 gev 2 by the quark fla vor mixing

and mzc 2 91 1876 21 gev note that the fermi coupling constant for beta decay has become a derived quantity gf c 3 1 2 1 v 2 1 8 2 4 1 mec 2 2 74 and that our value for v differs from the standard model edition by a factor 79 vud 0 97425 22 thus from 13 70 and 65 we would find the standard model value vsm of the electroweak energy scale as vsm v vud 2 2 2 mec 2 vud 246 85 gev 75 for a geometric mean fine structure constant 66 the numerical result is close to the established value 46 vsm 246 22 gev note that 63 70 and 73 would give the same result for the wilson inspired potential with its wwilson 1 cos because wmanton w in 8 and wwilson share the mass term 1 2 2 and the 2 periodicity baryonic states however will be shifted downwards by some 20 percent for states constructed from the lowest levels this would spoil the agreements in fig 3 7 1 on the influence of loop corrections on the higgs mass the electroweak scale 70 follows from the 2 shift to a neighbouring trough in 55 scaled by the balanc ing trailing ansatz 51 in which the coupling constant appears twice namely explicitly as a factor on the higgs field and hidden in the factor on the color angle the scale v is settled by the 2 shift giving a dimensionless v 2 and the higgs mass is settled by a dimensionless value mh 1 2 from matching the shape of the higgs potential to that of the neighbour ing trough 55 of the intrinsic geodetic potential in 8 with this non pertubative procedure we have condensed higher loop corrections into the question of finding the right value for the effective coupling constant eff per tubative corrections are then contained in the values of eff in the various steps where they enter the neutron decay which we have taken to shape the higgs potential involves both lepton dynamics and gauge boson dynamics wherefore we used in 66 for the gauge mechanism as approximation for the geometric mean me mz 1 132 41 76 between its known values around electronic energies where 28 0 e 2 4 0 c 1 137 035999074 and at bosonic energies where 29 z 1 127 944 with this we obtained for the higgs mh the beta decay fermi cou pling constant gf and the gauge boson masses mw mz the values in 73 to investigate the influence of fermionic loop correc tions on the result for the higgs we use expressions from an older work by jegerlehner 82 the definition of the total correction at scale s is given by s 1 s 77 from jegerlehner we then refer the lepton contributions leptons s l e 3 8 3 2 l 1 2 l 3 2 l ln 1 l 1 l 78 where l 1 4 m 2 l s the hadronic contributions are 6 had s 9 1 s h yd h ys h yb 4 h yu h yc h yt 79 where s is an effective strong coupling constant and h y 5 3 y 1 y 2 g y 80 with yi 4 m 2 i s and g y 2 y 1 arctan 1 y 1 for y 1 81 whereas g y 1 y ln 1 1 y 1 1 y for y 1 82 for consistency we use jegerlehner s set of effective parameters fitted for e 40 gev in the above o s pertubative qcd formula jegerlehner states the effective quark masses mu d s c b 0 067 0 089 0 231 1 299 4 500 gev and the effective s 0 102 to this we add the top pole value 83 mt 176 7 gev as a generalization of jegerlehner s 5 had with the lepton masses in 78 and the effective parameters in 79 we get for the scale s 125 gev at the higgs mass the following corrections leptons mh 0 032036 and 6 had mh 0 029986 these sum up 14 to fermions mh 0 0620 to be compared with the value fermions mz 0 0592 from a similar calculation at s 91 1876 gev for the radiative corrections we integrate the renormalization group equation for the electric charge coupling constant e e e 83 with the beta function 84 e e 3 12 2 e 5 64 2 o e 7 84 where is the sliding scale omitting o e 7 we get with b 1 1 12 2 and b 2 1 64 2 ln k b 2 b 21 ln e 1 2 1 b 1 1 e 2 1 2 b 2 b 21 ln b 1 b 2 e 2 f e 85 where k is an integration constant which in weinberg s lower order result leads to an expresssion 1 1 1 3 ln 2 m 2 e 5 3 86 this would correspond to a radiative correction rad 0 3 ln 2 m 2 e 5 3 87 with the fine structure constant 0 e 2 4 1 137 035999074 we want however to go to higher order but are on the other hand only interested in relations between different scales so from 85 we continue with the following identity f e ln f e ln 88 relating radiative corrections to at two different scales and to yield 1 1 1 3 ln 2 2 1 3 4 1 3 4 1 and 1 1 89 i e for scales that are not too far apart using the above fermionic corrections together with the sliding scale result 89 in the geometric mean in 66 would shift the estimated higgs mass with 3 5 per mille to 124 61 gev however if one trusts the heuristic argument leading to the introduction of the geometric mean one should stick to the prediction of the higgs mass from the geometric mean between the lepton and the gauge boson sector this because the higgs particle does not occur as such in the neutron decay it s mass is only derived from the gauge mechanism underlying the decay one could question however whether to use mw in the geometric mean in stead of mz since in the standard description it is w that is involved virtually in the neutron decay when a d quark is transformed into a u quark undertaking similar calculations as above we get fermions mw 0 0581 and fermions mz 0 0592 which together with the sliding correction 1 3 ln m 2 w m 2 z 1 3 4 1 z 3 0 02725 90 from 89 gives 1 ms 128 121 to yield mhc 2 125 224 gev note that we here take the shift ms between the modified minimal subtraction scheme and the on shell renormalization scheme 85 to be the same at mw as it is at mz namely 0 007165 this is of course not completely accurate glancing at the expression in ref 85 for the shift ms mz mz 100 27 1 6 7 4 ln m 2 z m 2 w o s 2 s 91 15 one would expect ms mw mw to be slightly larger by the amount 7 4 ln m 2 z m 2 w 0 001025 92 which obviously disappears when mz is replaced by mw for even higher order corrections one would need to know also the shift of the effective strong coupling s from s mz to s mw we postpone this for future study and refer the interested reader to ref 86 here we simply note that already our somewhat crude estimate 1 ms mw 128 12 agrees with the particle data group remark 87 that 1 128 at q 2 m 2 w fig 13 gaussian higgs mass distributions as observed by the cms collaboration 88 dashed and the atlas collaboration 9 dashdotted compared with the theoretical result dotted in 73 based on a geometric mean coupling constant between lepton and w gauge boson dynamics the curve widths represent the standard deviations of the respec tive mass peak determinations and not the resonance width which is much smaller 13 for ease of comparison we have shown the theoretical result with the same standard devia tion as in fig 1 cautiously we state our result as a prediction from mz with the estimates from mw and mh cited as systematic errors with the newest value 85 of 1 ms mz 127 940 0 014 used in me mz we arrive at the result ing value mhc 2 125 048 0 014 stat 0 18 0 44 syst gev added in proof we note that the final result from the cms collaboration 88 on run 1 at the lhc states mhc 2 125 03 0 29 0 31 gev for completeness we com pare in fig 13 a prediction based on 1 ms mw 128 12 with this final cms result together with the fi nal atlas result both from the large hadron collider at cern in gevena 8 remarks on physical interpretations the conceptual framework is not the standard model although many aspects comply with it a benefit is the reduction in the number of ad hoc parameters while keep ing and in certain cases improving on the agreements with experimental observations this suggests the frame work to be taken as more than just an approximation 1 the physical conception of baryon dynamics is that of introtangled energy momentum with baryons described as stationary states on an intrinsic compact configura tion space we consider the intrinsic dynamics to be fully described by a hamiltonian 1 on the intrinsic configu ration space i e not as fields of quarks and gluons in laboratory space with separate strong and electroweak interaction parts rather we consider the baryons to be entire entities of introtangled energy momentum which carry strong and electroweak manifestations intermin gled quarks 35 and gluons 45 come about when the intrinsic states are projected to laboratory space in the language of the standard model we have confinement per construction since we take the configuration space to be compact 2 we consider the creation of electric charge to orig inate in topological changes 29 in the intrinsic states see also fig 7 as configuration space we take the lie group u 3 it contains as intermingled subspaces exem plars of both u 1 su 2 and su 3 structures e g the gauge group su 3 of strong interactions and the gauge group u 1 su 2 of the electroweak interactions 3 we consider the strong and electroweak energy scales to be related by a balancing of color and higgs field energies 51 in the weak decay of baryons we take the length scale of the strong interaction sector of the model to be settled in the projection of the neutron de cay which relates changes in the intrinsic baryon states to the electroweak sector 55 56 70 we thus take a projection of the intrinsic geometry to the electrically de fined classical electron radius as an input for the strong interaction scale with the electron imagined as a peel off from the neutron leaving a charge scarred proton torus see fig 2 further we use a trailing ansatz 51 to relate strong and electroweak coupling constants in or der to set the scale 70 for the electroweak sector and its higgs 63 and gauge boson masses 71 4 states are projected from intrinsic space to labo ratory space by use of the exterior derivative the mo 16 mentum form on the intrinsic manifold 11 respectively 35 and 45 from projection of the intrinsic structure to space we recognize the toroidal generators as momen tum operators 12 and off torus generators as spin and flavor operators 5 18 in experimental production of resonances we see from space the impact momen tum generates the abelian maximal torus of the u 3 in trisic space the momentum operators act as introtan gling generators when decay asymptotic freedom frag mentation and confinement are of concern we see from intrinsic space the quark and gluon fields are projec tions of the vector fields induced by the momentum form on the intrinsic states the projected fields are treated as quantum fields and a balancing trailing ansatz between color and higgs field energies in weak baryon decays con nects strong and electroweak sectors 51 via the period doublings 68 allowed in the parametrization of the in trinsic space the structure of the period doublings and the intrinsic potential 8 determines the higgs potential from which the higgs mass originates 5 because the dynamical structure is formulated on the lie group it will show different manifestations de pending on which derivatives 11 one is taking for in stance we interpret the three toroidal dimensions as in trinsic color quark degrees of freedom 34 39 these are intermingled with flavor degrees of freedom and both are intermingled with the eight gluon dimensions laid out by the gell mann matrices 45 thus we do not consider color and flavor degrees of freedom as being independent as mentioned in subsec 2 2 the distri bution functions in fig 10 are produced by using the exterior derivative 34 on tracks 17 from the quark flavor generators tu 2 3 t 1 t 3 and td 1 3 t 1 t 3 and the reduction in the number of independent quark degrees of freedom practically eliminates the missing res onance problem in ordinary qms compare figs 3 and 8 9 examples for future study the neutral flavor neutral electric charge baryon sin glets mentioned in sec 4 and listed in table iii should be sought for they may even lie dormant in data pools already taken since they have no charged partners to help them surface in partial wave analysis a more accurate estimate of the coupling constant ms mw at w bosonic energies is wanted for an even more accurate prediction of the higgs mass mh a suitable base on which to expand for exact solutions for charged baryons is wanted in order to improve the predictions on the n and mass spectrum the geodetic distance potential 6 can be used as an interaction term for instance in a model for two baryons with configuration variables u and u for which d u u d e u u thus we conjecture the deuteron to be the spin 1 ground state of c a 1 2 u 1 2 u 1 2 d 2 u u u u e u u 93 when one imagines a projection of the term u u it has an antiquark quark structure characteristic of mesons in that the u when projected is to be represented on an antiquark to the left and the u is to be represented on a quark to the right 10 conclusion we have derived the higgs mass and the electroweak energy scale by connecting structurally the strong and electroweak baryon sector we have considered baryons as entire entities on an intrinsic u 3 configuration space with a hamiltonian structure to yield baryon mass spec tra the parametrization of the intrinsic baryon space and its potential allows for period doublings which de termines the higgs potential and settles the higgs mass parton distribution functions follow from the exterior derivative the momentum form on intrinsic states the general agreement of the various derivations with experimental observations suggests further investigations within the model in particular a base for exact solutions of electrically charged baryonic states is wanted as well as experimental investigations looking for neutral flavor neutral charge baryon singlets particular for the present model the singlets should be visible as resonances in negative pions scattering on protons in photoproduc tion on neutrons in neutron diffraction dissociation ex periments and in invariant mass spectra of protons and negative pions in b decays the higgs mass prediction the singlet predictions and the elimination of a missing baryon resonance problem distinguish the present model from the standard model predictions we await singlet searches on gev machines from new experiments or from dedicated analysis on existing data pools and we await more accurate higgs mass measurements from run 2 at the large hadron collider acknowledgments one of us
