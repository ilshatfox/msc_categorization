howe on the occasion of his 70 th birthday 1 introduction let f be a non archimedean local field and g a reductive group defined over f to study the category r r g of smooth representations of g bushnell and kutzko bk formulated the theory of types which build on the theory of minimal k types hm and a general framework due to bernstein be this category r is decomposed into a product of additive subcategories by the theory of bernstein center be 1 r s i r s g where i is the set of inertial classes of cuspidal pairs moreover each factor rs rs g can not be further decomposed see bk for details when we have a type in the sense of bushnell and kutzko we have the means to study a finite number of these rs to be effective we would like to have one type for each single rs the existence and the nature of such types has been a fundamental problem in this article we will give a construction of types for a general reductive p adic group g our method produces types corresponding to a single factor rs the construction here is not new it is the same construction used in yu for supercuspidal representations when certain obvious constraints pertaining to supercuspidality are removed what is new is that an additional constraint must be imposed concerning the embeddings of buildings for any tamely ramified twist of a levi subgroup g of g there is a family of embeddings of the extended building b g of g into that b g of g this family forms a euclidean space the choice of embeddings is unimportant for almost all applications but it is crucial here that we avoid a certain set of embeddings of measure 0 this generic choice of embeddings allows us to construct our types as covers of supercuspidal types on levi subgroups in a uniform manner to prove that this construction indeed yields g covers and thus types in the sense of bushnell and kutzko bk we use ideas from the work of k mp 2 in 9 we sketch a proof that our construction yields sufficiently many types to study all irre ducible admissible representations under a suitable tameness hypothesis on g and f acknowledgment it is our great pleasure to dedicate this paper to professor roger howe we would like to thank the referee for his her thoughtful and detailed comments which have been invaluable in improving the exposition an earlier version of this paper without sections 9 and 10 had been circulated among experts last 10 years we would like to thank our friends and colleagues who encouraged us to publish the paper 1 partially supported by an nsf grant 1 http arxiv org abs 1612 04204 v 1 2 notation and conventions 2 1 we adopt all notation and conventions from yu p 582 however in this paper we do not need to treat base field extensions extensively except in 4 3 therefore we work over a fixed non archimedean local field f that is f is either a p adic field or a function field over finite field if g is an algebraic group over f we will denote g s group of rational points also by g for simplicity this should lead to no confusion 2 2 throughout this paper g is a connected reductive group over f split over a tamely ramified extension of f for any maximal f split torus s g s f denotes the corresponding set of roots in g for a g s f let ua resp ua be the root subgroup resp root subspace corresponding to a by a levi subgroup of g we mean an f subgroup of g which is a levi factor of a parabolic f subgroup of g by a twisted levi subgroup g we mean an f subgroup g of g such that g f f is a levi subgroup of g f f 2 3 we assume that the residue characteristic p of f is not a torsion prime for g the root datum dual to the root datum g of g f f see yu 7 and st for the relevant notions by st 2 3 p is not a torsion prime for g for any twisted levi subgroup g of g from 7 on we also assume that p is odd 2 4 let g g 0 gd be a tamely ramified twisted levi sequence in g that is each gi is a e levi subgroup of g over a tamely ramified finite extension e of f yu p 586 let m 0 be an f levi subgroup of g 0 let zs m 0 be the maximal f split torus of the center z m 0 of m 0 we define m i to be the centralizer of zs m 0 in gi lemma a m i is an f levi subgroup of gi b m m 0 m 1 md is a generalized twisted levi sequence in m md in the sense of yu page 616 c z m 0 z md is f anisotropic proof a follows from bo 20 4 it then follows that m i is a twisted levi subgroup of gj for i j therefore for i j m i is the centralizer of z m i in gj hence is also the centralizer of z m i in m j again by bo 20 4 this implies that m i is a twisted levi subgroup of m j we have proved b finally since z md z m 0 the f split rank of z md is smaller than or equal to that of z m 0 by construction z md zs m 0 therefore z md and z m 0 have the same f split rank this proves c remark we observe that m is a tamely ramified twisted levi sequence in m 2 3 generic embeddings of buildings 3 1 we recall that if g is a tamely ramified twisted levi subgroup of g then there exists a family of natural embeddings of buildings b g b g which is an affine space under x zs g r all these embeddings have the same image two embeddings in the same orbit of x zs g r can be regarded as the same for most purposes 3 2 definition letm be a levi subgroup of g y b m and s r we say that the embedding b m b g is y s generic or s generic with respect to y if ua y s ua y s for all a g s f r m s f where s is any maximal f split torus of m such that y a m s f here a m s f is the apartment associated to s in b m once an embedding is fixed we will identify b m as a subset of b g here ua y r r r is the filtration on the root group ua a g s f so that ua y r ua g y r where g y r r 0 is the moy prasad filtration see mp 1 mp 2 the following two results illustrate the usefulness of the notion of generic embeddings 3 3 proposition let g m y be as above and let b m b g be 0 generic relative to y let p mu be a parabolic f subgroup of g with levi factor m for any smooth representation v of g the natural map ru v vu from v to its jacquet module induces a bijection ru v gy 0 vu my 0 this is a reformulation of mp 2 proposition 6 7 note that y b m and an embedding b m b g is not always 0 generic with respect to y 3 4 remark we can use generic embeddings to gain some new insight for the result in yu 17 indeed when g is a levi subgroup one observes that the main result in yu theorem 17 1 is obvious when the embedding b g b g implicitly used is y s generic where s r 2 in this case one can argue directly using the last paragraph of the proof yu corollary 17 3 in general one argues that there is an embedding 1 b g b g close to which is y s generic see 3 6 below and j j indjj 1 1 where j 1 1 is constructed in the same way as j but using 1 in place of then the theorem follows immediately from the generic case in fact this is just rephrasing the proof in yu 17 our j 1 is the ad hoc object j used there however now we view yu lemma 17 2 as a literal special case of yu theorem 9 4 by varying the embedding and we should regard yu theorem 17 1 in the case of a generic embedding as the essential result 3 5 we now work in the setting of 2 4 consider a commutative diagram of embeddings b g 0 b g 1 b gd b m 0 oo b m 1 oo b md oo to specify such a diagram of embeddings it suffices to give the image of a fixed y b m 0 in b m i 1 i d and in b gi 0 i d we will denote this whole diagram by and we will 3 denote by any composite embedding in this diagram from b m i to b m j or b gj or from b gi to b gj for i j definition let s s 0 sd be a sequence of real numbers and y b m 0 we say that is s generic relative to y if b m i b gi is si generic relative to y b m i for 0 i d 3 6 we now establish the abundance of generic embeddings let be a commutative diagram of embeddings as in 3 5 and y b m 0 denote the image of y in b m i by yi and that in b g i by zi 0 i d let v x zs m 0 r there is a commutative diagram of embeddings to be denoted by v in which the image of y in b m i is yi and that in b g i is zi v 0 i d lemma fix s rd 1 a s generic commutative diagrams of embeddings exist b assume that g 6 m for 0 i d let si be a maximal f split torus of m i let x zs m 0 r be such that a 6 0 for a gi si f r m i si f 0 i d then the set of t r such that the commutative diagram of embeddings t is not s generic is an infinite discrete subset of r proof for i 0 1 d and a gi si f r m i si f there exist infinite discrete subsets i a of r such that the set of v v x zs m 0 r with v not s generic is the union of hyperplanes in v defined by a v c c i a both statements follow easily from this 4 covers and decompositions 4 1 iwahori type decompositions let p mu be a parabolic f subgroup of g with levi factor m and p mu the opposite parabolic a compact open subgroup k of g is said to decompose with respect to u m u if k k u k m k u 4 2 covers let m be a levi subgroup of g k resp km a compact open subgroup of g resp m and resp m an irreducible smooth representation of k resp km the pair k is called a g cover of km m if for any opposite pair of parabolic subgroups p mu p mu with levi factor m we have i k decomposes with respect to u m u ii km m and k u k u ker iii for any smooth representation v of g the natural map from v to its jacquet module vu induces an injection on v k the k isotypic subspace of v this definition is due to bushnell and kutzko bk although we have used a reformulation given in bl the ore me 1 see also gr 4 1 4 4 3 we now give a useful probably well known class of compact open subgroups with the decom position property with respect to u m u fix b m b g and consider b m as a subset of b g let e f be a finite galois extension such that g e is split let t be a maximal torus of m defined over f and split over e let y be a point of a m t e b g put 0 g t e 0 and let f 0 r be a gal e f stable and concave function then we can define g e y f and k gy f g e y f g as in yu page 608 in addition let k gy f where f is the concave function a 7 max f a 0 yu lemma 13 1 ii proposition suppose that f a 0 for all a 0 and f a 0 for all a 0 r m t e a k gy f and k gy f decompose with respect to u m u b let k m be a compact open subgroup of m containing k m such that k m normalizes k then k k u k m k u is an open compact subgroup which decomposes with respect to u m u moreover k k k m k m proof a it suffices to prove the assertion for ke g e y f indeed if ke decomposes with respect to u m u and g gy f then g umu for unique elements u ke u e m ke m e u ke u e for any gal e f umu g g u m u by the uniqueness of the decomposition a consequence of the big cell theorem bo 14 21 we have u u e gal e f u f etc it follows that k gy f decomposes with respect to u m u a similar remark applies to k we now prove a with the additional assumption that e f and t is split over f the statement about k is then a special case of bt 1 6 4 48 write 0 u m u where m m t f 0 and u resp u is the set of roots for the action of t on lieu resp on lie u for h u m u let fh a f a if a h otherwise then fh is concave by yu lemma 13 1 iv and k h gy fh k h by bt 1 6 4 43 km normalizes ku therefore kukm is a subgroup of g and is the same as gy fum where fum inf fu fm again by bt 1 6 4 43 k ukm k normalizesk therefore kukmk is a subgroup of g since k k u k m k u and ku k m k ukm we have kukmk k ukmku is a subgroup of g it follows that this subgroup is gy f k and kh k h for h u m u this proves a b since k m m normalizes u k m normalizes k u and kuk m is a subgroup of g this subgroup normalizes k since both k u and k m do therefore k uk mk is a subgroup of g clearly this subgroup is equal to kuk mk u the natural morphism k m k k is surjective with kernel k m k k m this gives the asserted isomorphism and finishes the proof of b 5 5 heisenberg triples 5 1 definition let j j be compact open pro p subgroups of g and let j c be a smooth character such that j p c p 1 we say that j j is a heisenberg triple if i j is a normal subgroup of j and j j is an abelian group of exponent p ii the commutator subgroup j j ker iii the symplectic pairing j j j j p a b 7 aba 1 b 1 is non degenerate notice that i and ii imply that the pairing in iii is well defined it follows that j ker is a heisenberg p group such triples often occur in the representation theory of p adic groups 5 2 example we now recall the fundamental heisenberg triple used in yu the setting of this example will be in force through the rest of this section let g g be a tamely ramified twisted levi sequence in g and y b g fix an embedding b g b g to identify b g as a subset of b g let r be a positive real number and g y r r c a g generic character in the sense of yu 9 put s r 2 j g g y r s j g g y r s and j c the character obtained by extending the restriction of to g y r trivially across a subgroup of g that is perpendicular to g in a suitable sense see yu 4 then j j is a heisenberg triple by yu lemma 11 1 5 3 keep the settings in 5 2 in addition let m be a levi subgroup of g such that y b m letm be the centralizer in g of zs m then if we put g 0 g 1 g g m 0 m 1 m m is a levi sequence as in 2 4 we also fix a commutative diagram of embeddings of buildings extending b g b g b g b g b m oo b m oo we treat these embeddings as inclusions lemma m m y r is m generic of depth r relative to y proof by definition g y r r is realized by a g generic element x lie z g r let e f be a finite extension over which m m g and g are all split and t a maximal e split torus of m such that y a m t e then the genericity of x means ord x ha r for all a g t e r g t e recall that ha da 1 and a gm t is the coroot of a this is condition ge 1 in yu 8 by 2 3 and yu lemma 8 1 ge 2 holds automatically clearly m m y r r is realized by x m the image of x under lie g lie m so we have x m ha x ha has valuation r for all a m t e r m t e g t e r g t e notice that for a m t e g t e ha is the same whether we consider a as a root of m or of g again by 2 3 and yu lemma 8 1 this shows that m is m generic of depth r relative to y 6 5 4 keep the settings in 5 2 and 5 3 we now give the crucial construction of a new heisenberg triple needed in this paper let j m g y r s g g y r s j m g y r s g g y r s j where is the character used in 5 2 by yu lemma 13 2 the groups j and j can be described by concave functions in a suitable way lemma a j j is a heisenberg triple b let p mu be a parabolic f subgroup of g with levi factor m and unipotent radical u let u be the unipotent radical of the opposite parabolic subgroup let w and w be the images of j u j u and j u j u in v j j respectively then w and w are maximal isotropic subspaces of v and v w w in other words w and w form a complete polarization of v c let c be the center of h j ker let a a be the images of j u and j u in h then a c a c 1 d g g y 0 s u normalizes j u proof let j j be the triple in 5 2 so that j j and j j j thus conditions i and ii in 5 1 follow from the corresponding statements for j j it is also clear that j p denote by jm jm m the heisenberg triple obtained by applying the construction of 5 2 to m m y m then j m j jm j m j put v j j vm j m jm v j j then we have embeddings of vm v and v v which are compatible with the symplectic pairings on these spaces we will regard these embeddings as inclusions by yu lemma 13 3 j jm j this implies vm v v we now claim vm v since vm is non degenerate this will imply v vm v orthogonal direct sum of symplectic spaces and v is non degenerate so condition iii in 5 1 will follow by proposition 4 3 j j umy rj u it follows that we have v w w to prove the claim it suffices to show that both w and w are perpendicular to vm in v indeed if a jm b j u then aba 1 b 1 j j u j j u ker this shows vm w the same argument proves vm w this finishes the proof of a similarly if a b j u then aba 1 b 1 j j u ker therefore w is a totally isotropic subspace of v the same goes for w since v w w both w and w are maximal isotropic subspaces this proves b c is obvious since j j u j j u ker to prove d it suffices to prove the analogous statement when f is replaced by a finite tamely ramified galois extension field e therefore we may and do assume that m is split over f and that there is a maximal f split torus t of m such that y a m t f then we can write j u gy f g g y 0 s u gy g for suitable concave functions f g on 0 g t f 0 7 explicitly let v x zs m r be such that a v 0 for all roots a of zs m on the lie algebra of u then f a r if a v 0 a g t f s if a v 0 a g t f if a v 0 g a 0 if a v 0 a g t f s if a v 0 a g t f if a v 0 according to bt 1 6 4 43 it suffices to check f pa qb pf a qg b whenever p q z 0 a b pa qb 0 this condition is easily verified and hence d is proved 5 5 lemma let h be a finite heisenberg p group with center c assume that a a are subgroups of h such that a c a c 1 and the image of a and a in v h c form a complete polarization let be a non trivial character of c and x a complex representation of h such that c is isotypic let v xa be non zero then b a b v is also non zero proof this is k lemma 16 4 for completeness we produce a proof here assume v 6 0 is fixed by a for b a a a we have ab v aba 1 b 1 ba v aba 1 b 1 b v therefore b v is an eigenvector for a for the character b a 7 aba 1 b 1 as these characters are distinct the list of non zero vectors b v b a is linearly independent it follows that their sum is non zero 6 some covers of linear characters 6 1 setup we now work in the setting of 2 4 assume in addition i for each 0 i d 1 we have a quasi character i g i c such that i is g i 1 generic of depth ri relative to any x b g and ii these depths satisfy 0 r 0 r 1 rd 1 and iii we have a point y b m 0 and a commutative diagram of embeddings as in 3 5 which is s generic relative to y where s 0 s 0 sd 1 0 r 0 2 r 1 2 rd 1 2 notice that si ri 2 is the i 1 st component of s while ri is the i th component of r 8 we can now form compact subgroups similarly as in yu 3 ki g 0 y 0 g 1 y s 0 giy si 1 k i g 0 y 0 g 1 y s 0 giy si 1 let i k i c be the character defined as in yu 4 put k kd k k d d km k m m k m we caution the reader that these groups do depend on the choice of although the dependency is suppressed in the above notation following yu we will write ki ki etc when we need to make the dependency clear remark 1 in i if i is g i 1 generic of depth ri relative to an y b g i it is gi 1 generic of same depth relative to any yb gi this follows from the definition of the genericity of i 2 note that this ki and ki in 7 4 are different from the ki g 0 y g 1 y s 0 g i y si 1 in yu p 591 in general while ki and ki here are compact ki in yu is compact mod center in general 6 2 lemma let p mu be a parabolic f subgroup of g with levi factor m and unipotent radical u and p mu the opposite parabolic then we have a k and k decompose with respect to u m u b the character is trivial on k u and k u proof a follows from proposition 4 3 a we first observe that i u g i 1 since u gi lies in the commutator subgroup of gi assertion b follows from this and the definition of i and i in yu 4 6 3 theorem the pair k is a g cover of k m m proof we proceed by induction on d the argument here is similar to that in k proposition 17 2 the case d 0 is a reformulation of proposition 3 3 and the inductive step when d 1 follows the method of mp 2 using lemma 5 5 to play the role of mp 2 proposition 6 1 now assume d 1 and also g 6 m since there is nothing to prove if g m among the three defining conditions for a cover 4 2 i and ii are just the preceding lemma it remains to prove iii for any parabolic f subgroup p mu of g with levi factor m and for any smooth representation v of g the canonical map from v to its jacquet module vu is injective on the k isotypic subspace of v let v v be a non zero k isotypic vector it suffices to show that ni g v dg 6 0 for an increasing family of open compact subgroups ni of u whose union is the whole of u choose x zs m 0 r such that a 0 for all roots a of zs m 0 on the lie algebra of u for t r form the groups k t k t and k t k t see 3 6 for the notation put n t k t u and n t k t u then n t n t n t n t for t t and t rn t u by lemma 3 6 there is an infinite sequence t 1 t 0 t 1 t 2 such that tn and t n as n and k t is constant on the open intervals ti 1 t ti i z therefore we will denote by k ti 1 ti the group k t for any t ti 1 ti 9 in fact m k t k m m k t k m k m for all t for i z let ni u k ti 1 ti n i u k ti 1 ti then by proposition 4 3 we have k ti 1 ti nik m n i k ti nik m n i 1 k ti ni 1 k m n i since 0 is s generic the value t 0 lies on one of the open intervals ti ti 1 we may and do asssume that 0 t 0 t 1 now put v 1 v and for i 1 define inductively vi 1 ni 1 x vi dx we make two claims i vi is a non zero multiple of ni x v dx and ii vi is k ti 1 ti ti 1 ti isotypic where ti 1 ti is the character of k ti 1 ti obtained by using the construction of 6 1 but with the embeddings t t ti 1 ti in place of we prove the claims by induction i is a simple consequence of fubini s theorem and the unimodularity of u we have seen thatk ti ti 1 ni 1 k m n i 1 sinceni 1 n i 1 ker ti ti 1 by lemma 6 2 it follows that ker ti ti 1 ni 1 ker m n i 1 in particular ni 1 ker m n i 1 is a subgroup now we prove ii by the induction hypothesis vi is fixed by ker m n i ker m n i 1 since ni 1 ker m n i 1 is a compact subgroup it follows that vi 1 is fixed by this compact subgroup to finish the proof of ii it suffices to show that km acts on vi 1 via the the character m indeed for g km g vi 1 ni 1 gxg 1 g vi dx ni 1 gxg 1 m g vi dx m g vi 1 the last equality is because the compact group km normalizes ni 1 it remains to prove the most important statement lemma vi 1 6 0 for all i 0 proof we prove this by induction on i the case i 0 holds by assumption let j j be the triple constructed in 5 4 with m m g g r md 1 m gd 1 g d 1 rd 1 and the embeddings ti by lemma 5 4 d ni 1 k ti u g g y 0 s u normalizes j u where g g y 0 s is formed using the embeddings ti it follows that ni 1 g j u is a subgroup and in fact ni 1 g j u ni 1 by yu lemmas 13 3 and 13 4 it follows that vi 1 is a non zero multiple of ni 1 g j u y x vi dx dy 10 we make two more claims iii v j u x vi dx is non zero iv v is k ti 1 ti g ti 1 ti isotypic to prove iii let w be the j isotypic subspace of v this is naturally a representation of j it is easy to verify that j k ti 1 ti and ti 1 ti j therefore vi w and the integral defining v can be calculated within the j representation w the image of n i j in j ker is the same as that of j u and the image of ni 1 j in j ker is the same as that of j u where j u and j u are as in 5 4 by ii n i fixes vi this implies v 6 0 by lemmas 5 4 and 5 5 the proof of iv is similar to the proof of ii above finally we prove the lemma we can regard v as a smooth representation of g we may also regard v as a vector in the representation v 1 d 1 of g the integral ni 1 g y v dy is the same whether we use the action of g on v or on v 1 d 1 since d 1 ni 1 g 1 we can now apply the setting of this section tog gd 1 the twisted levi sequence g 0 gd 1 the characters 0 d 2 and the 0 r 0 2 rd 2 2 generic embeddings t where t ti ti 1 then we form the group k and as in 6 1 and these are nothing butk k ti 1 ti g and ti 1 ti k 1 d 1 recall that v v 1 d 1 is k isotypic by iv there fore we can apply the induction hypothesis for the induction on d to conclude vi 1 6 0 this proves the lemma and hence the theorem 6 4 corollary let k be a compact open subgroup of g and an irreducible smooth representation of k suppose that k satisfies conditions i and ii in 4 2 k k and k is isotypic then k is a g cover of k m k m proof for an irreducible smooth representation v of g let v resp v denote the isotypic resp isotypic component in v then v v since the natural map v vu on v is injective it is also injective on v 7 construction of types from now on we assume that p is odd 7 1 depth zero datum we now review the construction of types of depth zero by mp 2 we define a depth zero datum to be a triple g m y km m such that i g is a connected reductive group over f and m a levi subgroup of g ii y b m is such that my 0 is a maximal parahoric subgroup of m and b m b g is a 0 generic embedding relative to y iii km is a compact open subgroup of m containing my 0 as a normal subgroup and m is an irreducible smooth representation ofkm such that m my 0 contains a cuspidal representation of my 0 0 remark since my 0 is a normal subgroup of km the restriction m my 0 is isotypic where is any irreducible cuspidal representation occurring in m my 0 it follows that m my 0 is trivial 1 isotypic 11 this datum encodes not only a type of depth 0 in g but also how it arises from a cover as follows by mp 6 proposition 6 8 and bk proposition 5 4 km m is an s type where s is a finite set of the form m 1 m n with the i s irreducible supercuspidal representations of m note that when km is the maximal compact subgroup fixing y of m s is a singleton by proposition 4 3 b kg kmg y 0 is a subgroup such that kg g y 0 km my 0 let g be the representation of kg obtained by composing the above isomorphism with m then kg g is a g cover of km m therefore by bk theorem 8 3 it is an s g type where s g is defined in bk 8 7 2 the datum the datum from which we will construct a type is a 5 tuple g m 0 y r km 0 m 0 entirely analogous to that in yu 3 as follows d 1 g g 0 gd is a tamely ramified twisted levi sequence in g and m 0 a levi subgroup of g 0 unlike yu 3 we impose no assumption on z g 0 z g we construct a levi subgroup m of g and a generalized twisted levi sequence m in m as in 2 4 d 2 y is a point in b m 0 and is a commutative diagram of embeddings of buildings as in 3 5 s generic relative to y where s 0 r 0 2 rd 1 2 d 3 r r 0 rd is a sequence of real numbers satisfying 0 r 0 r 1 rd 1 rd if d 0 0 r 0 if d 0 d 4 g 0 m 0 y b m 0 b g 0 km 0 m 0 is a depth zero datum d 5 0 d where i is a quasi character of g i such that i is g i 1 generic of depth ri relative to x for all x b gi 7 3 remark again the datum encodes not just the type itself but also how the type arises as a cover in practice one may start with a 5 tuple g y r similar to yu 3 but with no assumption on z g 0 z g and instead of d 4 of yu 3 we assume that g 0 y 0 is an unrefined minimal k type of depth 0 in the sense of moy prasad we then construct m 0 and as follows by mp 2 6 3 to the parahoric subgroup g 0 y 0 of g 0 we can attach a levi subgroup m 0 of g 0 unique up to conjugacy by g 0 y 0 from the construction there we see that there is an embedding b m 0 b g 0 whose image contains y m 0 y 0 is maximal parahoric and is 0 generic relative to y one can then extend modify to a family which is s generic by lemma 3 6 of course there are choices involved in this procedure also in order to get the finest s types i e s types with s s a singleton we need to refine the datum a little bit eventually we end up with a datum as defined above 7 4 the construction we now put k 0 kg 0 km 0 g 0 y 0 km 0 k 0 and g 0 as in 7 1 and for i 1 put ki k 0 g 1 y s 0 g i y si 1 km 0 k i ki k i 12 again we remind the reader that these groups depend on the choice of and this ki may be different from the one used in yu 3 and 4 nevertheless it is easy to see that the construction in yu 4 can be carried out literally without any modification to give a representation i for each ki i 0 with 0 moreover m m y r m is a datum for constructing a supercuspidal type inm see yu remark 15 4 and the discussions following yu theorem 15 7 so we can construct supercuspidal types kim m i for each i 0 where k 0 m km 0 kim km 0 m 1 y s 0 m iy si 1 i 1 write t i ki i t td kd d tim k i m m i tm t d m k d m m d let si be the finite set such that t i m is an si type in m i if km 0 is the fixer of y in m 0 si is a singleton for r gi we write ti if i occurs in ki 7 5 theorem for i 0 ti is a gi cover of tim hence t i is an si g i type in gi proof the second statement follows from the first and bk theorem 8 3 condition i in 4 2 follows from proposition 4 3 b we now verify condition ii in 4 2 by induction the case of i 0 is just the definition the inductive construction of i from i 1 in yu 4 relies on the heisenberg triple j i j i i where i i 1 j i similarly to construct m i from m i 1 we use an analogous heisenberg triple j im j i m m i it follows from the definitions of these objects that j i m j i mi j i m j i mi and m i i j i m moreover j i and j i decompose with respect to u i m i u i by proposition 4 3 where u i u gi u i u gi since is s generic we have j i u i j i u i and j i u i j i u i it follows that the inclusion j im j i induces an isomorphism j im j i m j i j i let n i ker i n i m ker m i we can verify that the following diagram is commutative j im n i m j im j i m j i n i j i j i where j im j i m and j i j i are defined as in yu 10 the vertical arrows are the isomor phisms induced by inclusion and the horizontal arrows are the canonical special isomorphisms constructed in yu proposition 11 4 in addition the following diagram is also commutative ki 1 m sp j im n i m ki 1 sp j i n i 13 where the horizonal arrows are induced by conjugations and the vertical arrow on the right is induced by the isomorphism j im j i m j i j i it follows from these and the definitions of i and mi that we do have i k i m m i define ki i as in the preceding section note that this k i is identical to the k i used in yu by yu proposition 4 4 i k i is i isotypic by proposition 6 2 k i u i ki u i ker i since ki u i ki u i and ki u i ki u i by the genericity of we have proved condition ii of 4 2 completely now we see that all hypotheses for corollary 6 4 are satisfied the theorem is proved 8 support of hecke algebras let ki i be as in 7 4 let i be the contragradient of i then the hecke algebra h g i i associated to ki i is defined as follows h gi i f cc g i end i f jgj i j f g i j for g gi j j ki as in yu 17 we write h gi i for h g i i for g g i let ig i denote the space of intertwining maps homki gkig 1 g i i where g i is a representation of gk ig 1 with g i h i g 1 hg for h gkig 1 see also yu p 582 8 1 theorem a the support of h gi i is contained in k ig 0 ki b for g g 0 we have ig i ig 0 k 0 ig 0 ig i 1 where ig j is 1 dimensional for j 0 d 1 again the proof in yu 15 can be carried out without change 8 2 corollary the support of h gi i is contained in k ing 0 m 0 ki proof by mo theorem 4 15 for g g 0 we have ig 0 k 0 6 0 only if g k 0 ng 0 m 0 k 0 hence combining with the above theorem the corollary follows 9 exhaustion recall that in k it is proved that all supercuspidal representations arise from the construction given in yu under some hypotheses see k 3 4 in this section we prove that our construction gives all types parameterizing rs s i see 1 in 1 under the same hypotheses hk hb hgt and hn see k 3 4 for details we adopt notation and terminologies from k 9 1 theorem suppose hk hb hgt and hn are valid for each inertial class s i there is a datum g m 0 y r km 0 m 0 so that kd d is an s type 14 sketch of the proof let et g be the set of irreducible smooth tempered representations note that for any s ms s i the plancherel measure of e t g rs is nonzero hence it is enough to show that there are et g rs and a datum g m 0 y r km 0 m 0 so that kd d gives a g cover of the supercuspidal type of the cuspidal pair ms s which supports we sketch a proof in several steps below 1 recall from km 4 for a given strongly good datum g x r upon fixing embeddings of buildings b g 0 b g 1 b gd one can associate a strongly good type kdx d where kdx g 0 x 0 g 1 x s 0 gdx sd 1 and d is constructed as in 6 1 see km 4 for details then by k theorem 11 4 there are et g rs and a strongly good type kdx d such that kdx d 2 let v d be the d isotypic component of v then v d is stabilized by g 0 x 0 let y b g 0 be such that i g 0 y 0 g 0 x 0 ii v d has nontrivial g 0 y 0 invariants and iii g 0 y 0 is minimal satisfying i and ii such a y exist since d is trivial on g 0 x 0 3 let m 0 be a levi subgroup of g 0 so that m 0 y 0 is a maximal parahoric subgroup of m 0 and m the levi subgroup given by the centralizer of zs m 0 let p mu be the parabolic subgroup of g so that p g 0 x 0 g 0 y 0 g 0 y 0 let u be the opposite unipotent radical 4 form k um k d x u g 0 y 0 g 1 x s 0 gdx sd 1 which is defined in k 13 note that kx k and defines a character d of k such that d k d x d then by k corollary 13 12 k d v and v d v d 5 consider v d note that v d is stabilized by ky m m 0 y m g 1 y s 0 g d y sd 1 m 0 y m 1 y s 0 m d y sd 1 where m 0 y is the stabilizer of the image y of y in the reduced building of m and m i m gi let d be an irreducible representation of ky m such that d k is d isotypic as in k 13 d is denoted by in k 13 then by k corollary 18 6 there is an irreducible representation of m 0 y factoring through zmm 0 y 0 such that d is contained in v d then m 0 y 0 induces a cuspidal representation ofm 0 y 0 m 0 y 0 since otherwise there is a smaller parahoric subgroup g 0 z 0 g 0 x 0 with nontrivial g 0 z 0 invariants in v d which is a contradiction to the choice of g 0 y 0 in 2 6 from the proof of k theorem 19 1 m c ind m ky m d is a supercuspidal represen tation of m associated to a generic datum m y r m where m m 0 m 1 md and m 0 m d m moreover m m is equivalent to s in i 7 let km 0 be the maximal compact subgroup of m 0 y and m 0 a subrepresentation of when restricted to km 0 then m m 0 y r km 0 m 0 m gives a supercuspidal type k d m m d 8 consider g m 0 y r km 0 m 0 where is 0 s 0 sd 1 generic then by construction kd d is a cover of k d m d m hence an s type remark 1 the above proof starts with rs and a strongly good type contained in proceeds toward nailing down a supercuspidal type km m d out of the strongly good type and then finally finds a type as a cover kd d of km m d on the other hand we note that it is possible to start with a supercuspidal type datum for s and work toward getting a cover however to nail down g in the datum we find the proof above more efficient 15 2 a priori we can not assume our choices of y in 2 or embeddings b g 0 b g 1 b gd in 1 satisfy any genericity condition hence we still need to work with an auxiliary group k in 4 cf remark 3 4 10 equivalence 10 1 definition let and be two data as in 7 2 let t k resp t be the type constructed in 7 4 associated to resp i define rt to be the category of smooth representations which are generated by the isotypic components of v ii let t be the type associated to we say that t and t are equivalent if there is s i such that rs rt rt where r s s s r s from now on we assume that our data satisfy the hypothesis c g in hamu 2 6 10 2 theorem let g g 0 y r kg 0 g 0 and g g 0 y r k g 0 g 0 be two data such that zg 0 zg resp zg 0 zg is f anisotropic and kg 0 resp kg 0 is the maxi mal compact subgroup of g 0 y resp g 0 y let t k and t k let d i 0 i and d i 0 i be characters of g 0 and g 0 respectively then t and t are equivalent if and only if there is g g such that gy y gkg 0 kg 0 and g g 0 g 0 as kg 0 representations proof note that t and t are supercuspidal types suppose rt rt let rt rt be irreducible supercuspidal then let g 0 resp g 0 be a representation of g 0 y resp g 0 y containing g 0 resp g 0 so that g y r g 0 resp g y r g 0 is a supercuspidal datum for then hamu theorem 6 7 there is g g so that gy y gg 0 g 0 and g g 0 g 0 as g 0 y representations since both g g 0 and g 0 are subrepresentations of g 0 and k g 0 is a normal subgroup of g 0 y there is a g g 0 y so that g g g 0 g 0 conversely suppose there is g g such that gy y gkg 0 kg 0 and g g 0 g 0 as k g 0 representations it is enough to show that there is a supercuspidal representation rt rt let g 0 resp g 0 be a representation of g 0 y resp g 0 y containing g 0 resp g 0 so that g g 0 g 0 as g 0 y representations then g y r g 0 and g y r g 0 are supercuspidal data and their associated supercuspidal representations are isomorphic which are in rt rt hence rt rt 10 3 theorem let g m 0 y r km 0 g 0 and g m 0 y r k m 0 m 0 be two data such that km 0 resp km 0 is the maximal compact subgroup of m 0 y resp m 0 y let t k and t k let d i 0 i m 0 and d i 0 i m 0 be characters of m 0 and m 0 respectively then t and t are equivalent if and only if there is g g such that gkm 0 km 0 and g m 0 m 0 as km 0 representations 16 proof letm resp m be the centralizer of zs m 0 resp zs m 0 in g as in 2 4 let s resp s be the inertial class of m m resp m m where m resp m is the supercuspidal representation such that tm m resp t m m then we have rt r s and r t rs suppose rt rt thus r s rs then there is an unramified character of m 0 so that gm m and g m m by theorem 10 2 there is m m so that m g m 0 m 0 m 0 since is trivial on k we have m g m 0 m 0 as representations of k conversely suppose there is g g such that gkm 0 km 0 and g m 0 m 0 by theorem 10 2 rgtm rt m r m since gt and t are covers of gtm and t m respectively we have rt rgt rt remark in ka kaletha studied the equivalence of regular representations his methodology especially in 3 5 may allow the replacement of the hypothesis c g by a weaker
