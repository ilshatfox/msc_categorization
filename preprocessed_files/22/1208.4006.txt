constructed eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over the field of real numbers he established the almost everywhere convergence of these series obtained a formula for their constant terms and proved a functional equation for the constant terms in his subsequent paper 5 the convergence of the eisenstein series was obtained in this paper we define eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over global function fields using an adelic approach in the course of proving the convergence of these eisenstein series we also calculate a formula for the constant terms and prove their convergence and functional equations introduction classical eisenstein series are central objects in the study of automorphic forms the classical eisenstein series were generalized to the case of reductive groups and studied by r langlands 13 14 as in the classical case he found these eisenstein series have certain analytic properties as well as fourier series expansions where l functions appear in the constant terms because of this relationship these l functions inherit important analytic properties from the eisenstein series this approach to studying automorphic l functions is known as the langlands shahidi method see 7 for a survey the eisenstein series over function fields were studied by g harder in 8 in 4 h garland defines and studies eisenstein series on affine kac moody group over r he proved the almost everywhere convergence of the series while placing specific emphasis on calculating the constant term finding its region of convergence and proving functional equations of the constant term more precisely let g r be an affine kac moody group over r for each character of the positive part a of the torus he defines a function a c and as in the classical case uses the iwasawa decomposition g r k a u to extend to a function on g r garland extends this group by the automorphism e rd aut v r where r 0 and d is the degree operator of the kac moody lie algebra associated with g r setting ge rd g he defines an eisenstein series e on the space g r e rd aut v r by b ge rd where is a discrete subgroup of g r 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 22 e 67 secondary 11 f 70 1 http arxiv org abs 1208 4006 v 1 2 k h lee and p lombardo with suitable conditions on the character garland proves the almost everywhere convergence of e and calculates the constant term of this series e representing it as a sum over the affine weyl group w w w ae rd w c w here the function c w is a ratio of completed riemann zeta functions s s 2 s 2 s after establishing when this infinite sum converges he proves functional equations for the con stant term e in 5 garland proves the eisenstein series e converge absolutely for an arbitrary field f we can construct an affine kac moody group g f 2 let v be the set of places of f in this paper we consider the fields f for v completions of a global function field f we work adelically and define an eisenstein series e on g a a restricted direct product of the groups g f then we calculate the constant term of the eisenstein series e and as in garland s work find that we can express the constant term as an infinite sum over the affine weyl group moreover this expression contains c w functions composed of ratios of f the zeta function for the function field f this calculation leads to a proof of convergence of the eisenstein series theorem 0 1 let h such that re h i 2 for i 1 l 1 and let m m v be a tuple such that m z 0 and 0 m then the eisenstein series e h mdu f f b f h mdu is convergent for all h u h a u a u a f see 3 12 for the definition of md the zeta function f which appears in the c w functions of the constant term satisfies a functional equation using this we prove that the constant term of the eisenstein series satisfies a family of functional equations indexed by elements in the affine weyl group this paper has seven sections in section 1 we will provide a basic construction of an affine kac moody lie algebra and its corresponding groups and then proceed to section 2 where we prove an iwasawa decomposition for these groups section 3 uses the iwasawa decomposition to define an eisenstein series we also describe the characters we use for this definition and our analogue of the automorphism e rd that appears in garland s definition above in section 4 we calculate the constant term of our series the content of section 5 establishes the region of convergence for this infinite sum which we use in section 6 to prove the convergence of the eisenstein series e finally in section 7 we make use of the functional equation for f to prove functional equations for the constant term of our eisenstein series acknowledgments we are greatly indebted to h garland for his inspiring works on this subject we especially thank him for reading an earlier version of this paper which was the ph d thesis of the second author we were informed that m patnaik also considered loop eisenstein series over function fields in his thesis 15 without writing up details for convergence of the eisenstein series instead his thesis focused on geometric aspects of the eisenstein series eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 3 we thank m patnaik for helpful comments we also thank keith conrad who made many useful comments finally we thank the referee whose suggestions improved this paper very much 1 affine kac moody lie algebras and groups in this section we describe the affine kac moody groups that we use to define our eisenstein series we will first fix notations for an affine kac moody lie algebra g e then following chevalley s construction we will use automorphisms of a representation space v of g e to define the associated affine kac moody group g 1 1 affine kac moody lie algebras let g be a simple real lie algebra then we define 1 1 g e r t t 1 g rc rd and endow g e with the standard bracket operation see 5 or 11 in the expression above c is a central element and d is the degree operator that acts as t d dt on r t t 1 g and annihilates c we set 1 2 h e h rc rd where h is the cartan subalgebra of g we also set 1 3 g r t t 1 g rc and h h rc let be the classical root system of g and denote the simple roots by 1 l and the highest root by 0 then the affine roots of g e contain l 1 simple roots 1 l 1 by setting 0 l 1 we can describe the set of affine roots associated to g as 1 4 n n z n n z 6 0 the set of affine weyl or real roots is denoted by w n n z the set of the affine roots decompose into a disjoint union of positive roots and negative roots where n n z 0 n n z 0 n n z 0 similarly we can describe the positive and negative weyl roots by setting 1 5 w n n z 0 n n z 0 and w w let h 1 h l 1 denote the set of simple co roots associated to the affine simple roots 1 l 1 in general for any a we let ha denote the corresponding co root recall that we have the killing form on h which we normalize so that h 0 h 0 2 as in 4 we extend this bilinear form to a non degenerate bilinear form on h e for each simple root 1 l 1 we define a simple reflection wi aut h e for i 1 l 1 by 1 6 wi h h i h h i 4 k h lee and p lombardo then the affine weyl group w is defined to be w wi i 1 l 1 aut h e we have 1 7 w w t where w is the classical weyl group and t is a group of translations that we can index by h hz 10 11 as with g the algebra g has a chevalley basis which we can construct using the chevalley basis for g 2 first fix a chevalley basis for g h 1 h l e now we define some important elements of g for each a n w we let a t n e and i n t n h i for i 1 l also we set hi h i for i 1 l and hl 1 h 0 2 0 0 c using these elements we fix a chevalley basis for the algebra g h 1 hl 1 a a w i n i 1 n z 0 finally we denote the z span of by g z then g z is closed under the bracket operation for g e using g z we can make sense of an affine kac moody lie algebra over an arbitrary field f by setting 1 8 g ef f z g z fd let d denote the set of h e such that for i 1 l 1 we have h i z 0 and h i 6 0 for some i this is the set of dominant integral normal weights of g e in 2 we see that for each d we have an irreducible g e module v with a highest weight vector v this v contains a z module v z satisfying 1 9 a m m v z v z for any a w and m z 0 we fix this z module v z and call it the chevalley form of v the representation space v and v z decompose into a direct sum of weight spaces v and v z v v z respectively as a highest weight module we know that any weight of v is of the form 1 10 l 1 i 1 ki i where ki z 0 for an arbitrary field f we set v f f z v z then v f is a highest weight g ef module in the next subsection we will use the elements of g ef to describe some special automorphisms of the vector space v f these automorphisms generate the affine kac moody group over the arbitrary field f eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 5 1 2 construction of affine kac moody groups let f be an arbitrary field for a w and s f we define the automorphism a s of v f as 1 11 a s n 0 sn na n by 1 9 we know that this definition works for fields of arbitrary characteristic for each v v f and a w there exists an n 0 such that for all n n 0 we have na n v 0 hence for each v v f and a w the sum in 1 11 acts as a finite sum 2 we let f x be the field of laurent series in the variable x with coefficients from f then f x has an expression as i i 0 six i where i 0 z and si f for the classical roots we let 1 12 i i 0 i si for each v v f there exists an ik such that for all i ik i s v v for any s f and so for each v the product in 1 12 acts as a finite product 2 as a result of these observations each is an automorphism of the representation space v f finally we make the following definition definition 1 13 let f be an arbitrary field and d the affine kac moody group associated to g ef and its representation space v f is the following subgroup of aut v f 1 14 g f f x remark 1 15 1 since we are considering the automorphisms of v f our group depends on the choice of we fix a d and drop the from our notation 2 one may note that in the construction of g f we only used elements of g and ignored the degree operator d in section 3 we will extend our group g f by a particular auto morphism md related to d thereby establishing a more complete relationship between g ef g f fd and our group garland extends his group in a similar way by the automorphism e rd for r 0 4 5 in the next section we will begin working with this group when f is a field with a non archimedean absolute value our first objective is to develop an iwasawa decomposition for g f in this case from which we will be able to begin defining our eisenstein series 6 k h lee and p lombardo 2 iwasawa decomposition for affine kac moody groups in this section we prove an iwasawa decomposition for g f where f is a local field with a non archimedean absolute value in particular we will apply this result to the groups g f g where f is a completion of a global function field f we now consider the particular case of g f g where f is an arbitrary field with a non archimedean discrete valuation for x f let x denote the absolute value that corresponds to the valuation we define o x f x 1 and p x f x 1 noting that p is the unique maximal ideal of the ring o for any a w and s f we set wa s a s a s 1 a s and ha s wa s wa 1 1 likewise for and nonzero f x we set w 1 and h w w 1 1 using these elements we can define the subgroups of g that appear in the iwasawa decompo sition of the affine kac moody group we let f x f x denote the ring of power series over f we then set u f x or xf x h h i s i 1 l 1 s f and define b to be the group generated by u and h which can be realized as a semi direct product h u finally set k o x where o is defined above lemma 2 1 2 14 let n wa s a w s f w n n b n h and s w i 1 i 1 l 1 then g b n s is a bn pair for g remark 2 2 there is a natural isomorphism between w n n b and the affine weyl group w wi i 1 l 1 which identifies the element w i 1 for i with the simple reflection wi see 2 in light of the theory of bn pairs 12 5 9 29 we have the following facts regarding g corollary 2 3 for the affine kac moody group g we have 1 g w w b wb disjoint union eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 7 2 for w w let w wi 1 wik be a reduced expression then we have b wb yi 1 yikb where yi is a set of representatives for the cosets b wib b for each i 1 l 1 we continue by choosing a specific set of coset representatives for each yi to this end we recall the following lemma from 2 16 lemma 2 4 every element x b wb has an expression x a w a sa wy where sa f y b and w w w w in particular if we take w wi for some i each element x b wib has an expression as x i s wiy with y b now since we choose our yi s to be representatives of the coset space b wib b we can choose our yi s to consist of elements of the form i s wi where s f lemma 2 5 2 16 for an arbitrary field f and any a w we have a homomorphism a sl 2 f g f that is defined by the conditions a 1 s 0 1 a s a 1 0 s 1 a s a 0 1 1 0 wa 1 a r 0 0 r 1 ha r for s f and r f for the field f we know that the group sl 2 f contains the subgroup b consisting of upper triangular matrices and the subgroup k sl 2 o moreoever we have the iwasawa decomposition sl 2 f kb for more information see 10 2 lemma 2 6 we have the following 1 a b b if a w 2 a k k for any a w 3 we can choose the elements of yi for i 1 l 1 so that they are the images through i of elements in k in particular we may assume that yi k for i 1 l 1 proof 1 consider an arbitrary element r s 0 r 1 b we can express it in the following way r s 0 r 1 r 0 0 r 1 1 r 1 s 0 1 thus a r s 0 r 1 ha r a r 1 s since b is generated by h and u it suffices to show that a r 1 s u since we assumed that a w we know a n where either n 0 and or n 0 and we can write a r 1 s by setting r 1 s xn see the definition of 1 the conditions on and n guarantee that u therefore when a w we have the desired result 8 k h lee and p lombardo 2 we know that k 1 s 0 1 1 0 s 1 s s o see 10 2 and so an arbitrary element of k will be a finite product of these matrices as a result the image of an element in k through the homomorphism a will be a finite product of a s and a s with s s o it suffices to show that a s and a s are elements of k if a n then a n and we can express a s sx n and a s s x n since the coefficients s and s are each elements of o we have that a s and a s are elements of k 3 recall that yi is a set of coset representatives for b wib b for wi s by lemma 2 4 we can choose these representatives to be of the form i s wi for s f but then i s wi i 1 s 0 1 i 0 1 1 0 i s 1 1 0 however by the iwasawa decomposition for sl 2 f we know that s 1 1 0 kb for k k and b b thus we have i s wi i k i b and by part 1 of this lemma we know that the coset i s wib i k i b b i k b so we can take our representatives for b wib b to be of the form i k for some k k finally part 2 of this lemma implies that we can choose our yi to be a subset of k now we can prove that for any v the affine kac moody group g has an iwasawa decomposition theorem 2 7 iwasawa decomposition 2 let f be a field with a non archimedean discrete valuation and let g be an affine kac moody group over f then g k h u where k h and u are defined as above proof we have already established a bruhat decomposition for g in other words g w w b wb since this is a disjoint union it suffices to show that each b wb decomposes in the desired way it follows from corollary 2 3 and part iii of lemma 2 6 that for each w w we have b wb k b and thus g k b we have already observed that b h u and so we obtain the iwasawa decomposition g k h u the iwasawa decomposition of an element is not uniquely determined see remark 3 2 and corollary 3 11 eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 9 3 defining the eisenstein series for the remainder of this paper we set f to be a global function field of genus g let v denote the set of all places of f and for v let f denote the completion of f with respect to as in the previous section we let denote the corresponding non archimedean absolute value on f and we define the local ring o and its maximal ideal p as before we fix a uniformizer o so generates the ideal p finally let the integer q denote the cardinality of the residue field o p in this section we will use an ade lic approach and define our eisenstein series on the group g a a restricted direct product of affine kac moody groups over the completions of the field f 3 1 the ade lic approach using the completions f we define the ade le ring a as the restricted direct product a v f with respect to the subrings o the units of this ring the group of ide les a can also be realized as a restricted direct product a v f with respect to o where o x o x 1 o for s s a we define the ide lic norm s v s we set g g f and define the group g a as the following restricted direct product g a v g with respect to the subgroups k in order to define our eisenstein series on g a we must first establish an iwasawa decomposition for this group with the appropriately defined subgroups of g a this will be a direct result of theorem 2 10 to this end we distinguish the following subgroups of g a k v k h a v h and u a v u where the restricted direct products are with respect to h k and u k respectively theorem 3 1 we have the following iwasawa decomposition for the group g a g a k h a u a remark 3 2 in 2 garland develops an iwasawa decomposition for the group g r and estab lishes that the decomposition of an element is unique in our setting the iwasawa decomposition of an element is not unique this is potentially problematic because we will use this decompo sition to define the eisenstein series however we will see in proposition 3 10 that due to the structure of h a this is not an issue 10 k h lee and p lombardo 3 2 the structure and topology of the torus we fixed a normal weight d and hence a g e module v f it is a highest weight module so we let v denote the highest weight vector in 2 we see that the representation space v f decomposes into a direct sum of its weight spaces v f h e v f where v f v v f h v h v h h e moreover every weight of v f is of the form l 1 i 1 ki i for ki z 0 using this unique expression we define the depth of as dp l 1 i 1 ki we fix a basis b of v z by choosing basis vectors v v 1 vn in v z and ordering them so that 1 if vi v z vj v z and i j then we have dp dp and 2 for each weight of v z the basis vectors of v z appear consecutively a basis of v z that satisfies these conditions is called coherently ordered it is important to note that since we chose our basis vectors from v z the basis b serves as a basis for v f as well as v f for every v the advantage to fixing such a basis is that with respect to b we can view the elements of h as infinite diagonal matrices which are scalar matrices when we restrict to a weight space in addition the elements of u are strictly upper triangular block infinite matrices where the blocks are determined by the weight spaces of v z for more information see 2 by this observation we can clearly see that elements of h commute with each other and h normalizes the subgroup u since this holds for all v we obtain the same results for h a and u a because the definition of our eisenstein series depends on it we are interested in studying the structure of h a let h h a considering the local components we let h l 1 i 1 h i si as a result we may write h h a as the following product h l 1 i 1 h i si v we will prove the following proposition 3 3 assume that d suppose that h l 1 i 1 h i si h k eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 11 then we have ord si 0 for i 1 l 1 remark 3 4 we have included the superscript above since we must consider different s in the proof below proof as a consequence of lemma 15 7 and theorem 15 9 in 2 we know that for each funda mental weight i there exist a positive integer mi and a surjective group homomorphism mi i g g mi i and this homomorphism is characterized by the fact that it maps to mi i as a result l 1 i 1 h i si 7 l 1 i 1 hmi i i si as well set h l 1 i 1 h i si and h mi i l 1 i 1 h mi i i si since h h k by assump tion we have hmi i h mi i k mi i choose a highest weight vector 1 v v mi i f f v mi i z then by 2 we know that 3 5 hmi i 1 v l 1 i 1 hmi i i si 1 v l 1 i 1 s mi i h i i v s mi i v since elements of k preserve the subspace v o we have ord si 0 moreover since h k is a group we know h 1 l 1 i 1 h i s 1 i is also in the intersection applying the argument above to h 1 we find ord si 0 thus we have ord si 0 for each i 1 l 1 corollary 3 6 the subgroup h a g a may be realized in the following way h a l 1 i 1 h i si si a proof proposition 3 3 shows that for almost all v we have si o as a result these infinite tuples si are actually elements of a remark 3 7 we have a surjective group homomorphism a l 1 h a defined by s 1 s 2 sl 1 7 h l 1 i 1 h i si the group a l 1 inherits the product topology induced by the usual topological structure of a and we give the space h a the quotient topology induced by the map we will use the map again in section 5 12 k h lee and p lombardo 3 3 characters defining our eisenstein series on g a requires that we specify a character of the subgroup h a let be the ide lic norm we define a character by fixing a linear functional h and setting h l 1 i 1 si h i when h l 1 i 1 h i si h a remark 3 8 if h h a k then h l 1 i 1 h i si with si v o by our definition of we see that h 1 for any h h a k since si 1 for each i 1 l 1 fix h and define g a c to be the function induced by the character on h a and the iwasawa decomposition for g a in other words if g k hu is an element of g a then we set g k hu h we noted earlier that the iwasawa decomposition for g a is not unique so we need to prove that this function is well defined lemma 3 9 for any place v the subgroup b k is the semidirect product h k u k proof with respect to the coherently ordered basis b the elements of k are matrices with elements from the ring o and the elements of b are upper triangular block matrices thus we can view b b k as an upper triangular infinite block matrix with entries from o by the definition of b we know that b hu for h h and u u in fact with respect to b the matrix h will be diagonal with the same diagonal entries that appear in the matrix b in particular h h k which also implies that u u k proposition 3 10 let g k hu k h u be two iwasawa decompositions for g g a then k h u k hu in particular is a well defined function from g a into c proof we begin by noting that if k hu k h u then k 1 k h u hu 1 b a k by lemma 3 9 k 1 k h u with h h a k and u u a k using this information we see k h u k hu k h u hu since h a normalizes u a we can express k h u k h hu 1 for some u 1 u a finally we observe that by remark 3 8 we have k h u k h hu 1 h h h h h k hu eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 13 corollary 3 11 the h a component of an iwasawa decomposition is uniquely determined up to h a k proof from the proof of the above proposition we obtain h u h hu 1 since b a h a u a we actually have h h h 3 4 an important automorphism as in 4 we need to extend the group g a by an auto morphism related to the degree operator d that appears in the associated affine kac moody lie algebra g e c t t 1 g cc cd in 4 garland uses e rd aut v r for r 0 to extend the group g r however in our case we are considering the restricted direct product g a for this reason we first define local automorphisms m d aut v f for each v and then work with a product of the local automorphisms for each v and integer m z we define m d to be the automorphism of v f defined by the conditions 1 the automorphism m d fixes each weight space v f and 2 we have m d v m d v for v v f since m d acts as scalar multiplication on the weight spaces we can consider this automor phism as being a diagonal block matrix with respect to the coherently ordered basis b and as such the automorphism will commute with h and normalize u moreover note that if we chose m 0 then m d is the identity map we fix a tuple m m v such that m z and m 0 for all but a finite number of by doing so we fix the associated automorphism md defined as the product 3 12 md v m d v aut v f we will define the eisenstein series on g a md for our fixed automorphism md in particular we will consider as a function on g a md by setting g md g 3 5 defining the eisenstein series for each completion f there is the natural injection i f f which induces the injection f x f x by sending i i 0 six i 7 i i 0 i si x i from this map we see that there is a natural injection i g f g for each v and we may define the diagonal embedding i g f v g by 7 i v the image of the map i is not entirely contained in the group g a to see this clearly we construct an example of an element from g f that does not diagonally embed into g a 14 k h lee and p lombardo example 3 13 let f fq t it is well known that all but one of the places the infinite place corresponding to 1 t are indexed by monic irreducible polynomials in fq t we let f t denote the polynomial associated with the place set t 1 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 1 f 3 x 3 where we set the coefficient of xi to be 1 f i for some i that has not previously appeared in the expansion clearly we have 1 f fq t for all so f x however by design o x for an infinite number of v and as a result i is not an element of k for an infinite number of therefore i g a keeping this example in mind we consider the subgroup f defined by f g g f i g g a by an abuse of notation f will be considered as a subgroup of g f as well as g a where in the latter case we consider the elements as being diagonally embedded note that that h 1 for any h h a f and h we also have the subgroups h f u f and b f of the group g f in the definition of the eisenstein series f f b f will be the coset space over which we index our sum before continuing we first establish the following facts about lemma 3 14 let g g a and f b f then 1 gh h g for any h h a 2 g g and 3 g md g md proof 1 we write g khu according to the iwasawa decomposition since h a normalizes u a we have gh khuh khh u now by definition of we know khh u hh h h since h is the h a component of g we know this last expression equals h g 2 using an argument similar to that of lemma 3 9 we can show that for any f b a we have a decomposition h 1 u 1 with h 1 h a f and u 1 u a using our iwasawa decomposition express g khu then g khuh 1 u 1 khh 1 u u 1 hh 1 h g where the second to last equality holds because h 1 h a f eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 15 3 as before we let h 1 u 1 with h 1 f h a and u 1 u a since md commutes with h a and normalizes u a we see md md 1 h 1 u 2 for some u 2 u a let md md for some g a then g md g md g h 1 u 2 md g h 1 u 2 we know is right invariant by u a and in light of part 1 of this lemma the following equalities hold g h 1 u 2 g h 1 h 1 g g g md g md due to part 3 of the previous lemma the following definition of the eisenstein series e on the space g a md is well defined definition 3 15 for g g a and h we define 3 16 e g md f f b f g md whenever the series converges to a complex number otherwise we define e g md the goal of this paper is to prove the convergence of the series e later we will see that after some reductions we can consider e g md as a function on the space h a u a u a f in the next three sections we will prove the following theorem theorem 3 17 let h such that re h i 2 for i 1 l 1 and let m m v be a tuple such that m z 0 and 0 m then the eisenstein series e h mdu f f b f h mdu is convergent for all h u h a u a u a f to prove this theorem we first assume that is a real character so h a r 0 as a result the eisenstein series e takes values in r 0 this assumption is not very restrictive because for any complex character the series e is dominated by ere hence we can apply the dominated convergence theorem for the complex case after we consider the real character as in corollary 2 3 we see that g f has the bruhat decomposition into the following disjoint union g f w w b f w b f if we let f w f b f w b f and define 3 18 e w g md f w f w b f g md 16 k h lee and p lombardo then the bruhat decomposition above allows us to express our eisenstein series as 3 19 e g md w w e w g md this is simply a regrouping of the sum in definition 3 15 as with e we can consider each e w as a function on the space h a u a u a f in order to prove theorem 3 17 it suffices to show that 3 20 w w u a u a f e w h mdu du for h varying in an arbitrary compact set of h a and for real if we establish the convergence 3 20 then w w u a u a f e w h mdu du u a u a f w w e w h mdu du u a u a f e h mdu du 3 21 note that the last expression is nothing but the constant term of the eisenstein series e definition 3 22 we set e g md w w u a u a f e w g mdu du and call e the constant term of the eisenstein series e in the next section we will calculate the integrals u a u a f e w h mdu du for w w in section 5 we establish the convergence 3 20 when is a real character and h varies in a compact set of h a as a result we will obtain the almost everywhere convergence of the eisenstein series and a concrete description of its constant term 4 calculating the constant term of the eisenstein series in this section we simply state the existence and properties of the measures necessary for our calculation leaving the details to appendix a constructing these measures involves taking the projective limit of a family of measures for now we will also refrain from showing that e is a measurable function a topic that we will address in section 6 eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 17 4 1 definition and preliminary calculation from appendix a we have an invariant prob ability measure du on the space u a u a f as was discussed at the end of the previous section we now turn our attention to calculating the expression 4 1 w w u a u a f e w g mdu du we first calculate the integrals u a u a f e w g mdu du for w w let u f be the subgroup of g f consisting of the elements that are strictly lower triangular block matrices with respect to our coherently ordered basis b of v f we define u w f u f wu fw 1 note that this definition works over f as well so the notations u and u w are clear finally we set u a and u w a to be the expected restricted direct products the bruhat decomposition has this refinement g f w w u w f w b f disjoint union moreover every element of u u w f is of the form 4 2 u a w w w a sa for sa f see 4 6 3 6 it is straightforward to check that u w f f which implies f u w f w b f u w f w f b f as a result we can choose the coset representatives of f w f w b f to be bw for b u w f thus u a u a f e w g mdu du u a u a f f w f w b f g mdu du u a u a f b u w f g mdubw du we have the following decompositions 4 3 u f u w f u f wu fw 1 and u a u w a u a wu aw 1 this decomposition along with the fact that u w f f implies that 4 4 u f f u w f f u f w u f w 1 18 k h lee and p lombardo so we can consider the set of b u w f as a set of coset representatives for f u f f u f wu fw 1 since f u f f u a our integral u a u a f b f u f f u f wu fw 1 g mdubw du becomes 4 5 u a f u f wu fw 1 g mdu w du here we consider the measure du as the measure induced from du and the projection u a f u f wu fw 1 u a u a f using the decomposition 4 3 for u a we observe that integrating over this coset is the same as first integrating over u a u a wu aw 1 and then over u a wu aw 1 f u f wu fw 1 in appendix a we see that the measure du decomposes into measures du 1 and du 2 on these spaces respectively using these measures and decompositions we can manipulate our integral 4 5 to be 4 6 u w a u a wu aw 1 f u f wu fw 1 g mdu 1 u 2 w du 2 du 1 where we set u w a u a u a wu aw 1 since is u a right invariant we let u 2 w 1 u 2 w u a and rewrite g mdu 1 u 2 w g mdu 1 wu 2 g mdu 1 w as a result the integral 4 6 becomes u w a u a wu aw 1 f u f wu fw 1 g mdu 1 w du 2 du 1 since the values g mdu 1 w no longer depend on u 2 and the measure du 2 has a total measure of 1 this equals u w a g mdu 1 w du 1 u a wu aw 1 f u f wu fw 1 du 2 u w a g mdu 1 w du 1 the following proposition summarizes our results from this subsection eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 19 proposition 4 7 for g g a and w w we have u a u a f e w g mdu du u w a g mdu 1 w du 1 4 2 further calculation we continue our computation by further manipulating the integral in proposition 4 7 fix an iwasawa decomposition g khu since md normalizes u a we have g mdu 1 w khu mdu 1 w h mdu u 1 w the decomposition 4 3 allows us to write u u u for u u w a and u u a wu aw 1 clearly w 1 u w u a so by the right invariance of we have h mdu u 1 w h mdu u u 1 w h mdu u u 1 u 1 ww 1 u w h mdu u u 1 u 1 w the decomposition 4 3 also induces the natural projection u a u w a and we obtain that h mdu u u 1 u 1 w h mdu u u 1 u 1 w for any u 1 u w a and a fixed u u a wu aw 1 the map that sends u 1 to u u 1 u 1 is a unimodular change of variables so the integral in proposition 4 7 becomes u w a g mdu 1 w du 1 u w a h mdu u u 1 u 1 w du 1 u w a h mdu u 1 w du 1 however note that u u w a remains fixed as u 1 ranges over u w a and since du 1 is u w a translation invariant our integral may now be expressed as 4 8 u w a h mdu 1 w du 1 continuing we note that h mdu 1 w h mdu 1 md 1 h 1 ww 1 h mdw and since w 1 h mdw h a we obtain from lemma 3 14 part 1 h mdu 1 w w 1 h mdw h mdu 1 md 1 h 1 w since w 1 h mdw h md w the integral 4 8 becomes 4 9 h md w u w a h mdu 1 md 1 h 1 w du 1 20 k h lee and p lombardo set w w w w then applying the change of variables h mdu 1 h md 1 7 u 1 has the following effect on our integral in 4 9 h md w u w a h mdu 1 h md 1 w du 1 h md w h md u w a u 1 w du 1 where w it is known 6 p 50 that w w where h such that h i 1 for i 1 l 1 therefore h md w h md u

a finally since we may assume w k the k left invariance of allows us to rewrite our integral 4 10 as h md w u w a u du where du is the haar measure induced by conjugating by w 1 using definition 3 22 our results from this section appear in the following proposition proposition 4 11 for any g g a we have e g md w w h md w u w a u du 4 3 calculating the local integrals in this subsection we shift our focus away from the global g a and into the local pieces of g we aim to calculate some local integrals that will help us determine the value of the integral in proposition 4 11 we will see in the next subsection that the integral in proposition 4 11 may be expressed as a product of the local integrals that we discuss in this section as before we use w to denote w w w then w is a finite set of affine weyl roots that we can explicitly describe if w wir wi 1 is a minimal expression in terms of the generators of w then by setting j wir wij 1 ij we have w 1 r using these roots we can completely describe u w r sr 1 s 1 si f eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 21 for more information see 4 6 and 3 6 moreover each element in this group is uniquely expressed in this way so if we set u i i s s f then we have that u w v uniquely decomposes into u r u 1 in 13 of 2 we see that for any w the effect of conjugation by w is 4 12 w s w 1 uw so if we set u w w 1 u w w then u w uw 1 r uw 1 1 with uniqueness of expression calculating these roots we find w 1 j w 1 wir wij 1 ij wi 1 wir wir wij 1 ij wi 1 wij ij wi 1 wij 1 ij for convenience we set j wi 1 wij 1 ij and conclude 4 13 u w u r u 1 remark 4 14 each of the spaces u i is isomorphic to f so we can define a measure on these spaces using this isomorphism and the usual haar measure on f the measure du on u w may now be considered the product measure induced by the for more information see appendix a if we let w wir 1 wi 1 and j wir 1 wij 1 ij then by the same construction we get that w 1 r 1 and hence u w u r 1 u 1 similarly setting u w w 1 u w w we obtain its unique decomposition u r 1 u 1 recall that we fixed h so for every v we can define a function g r 0 in precisely the same way we defined on g a if g khu and h l 1 i 1 h i si for si f then we let g h l 1 i 1 si h i remark 4 15 using the same argument of proposition 3 10 we may conclude that this map is well defined it is our goal in this subsection to prove proposition 4 16 which calculates the value of the local integral involving the function on g as before we let h denote the co root corresponding to w and in particular h i for i 1 l 1 denote the simple co roots corresponding to the simple roots i finally let be the element of h defined by h i 1 for i 1 l 1 proposition 4 16 assume h i 2 for i 1 l 1 then for any v and w w u w u du w w 1 w 1 1 q h 1 1 1 q h 22 k h lee and p lombardo the above identity is an affine analogue of the gindikin karpelevich formula 13 the proof is by induction on the length of w w our first step is to consider a local integral over a unipotent subgroup of sl 2 f for each v and a w we have a unique group homomorphism a from sl 2 f into g by lemma 2 5 moreover sl 2 f has an iwasawa decomposition into kau 10 where k sl 2 o a a 0 0 a 1 a f and u 1 0 1 f we can define a real character on a by fixing a real number and setting a a 0 0 a 1 a using this character we define the function sl 2 f r 0 by g kau a for g kau sl 2 f where k k a a and u u remark 4 17 the iwasawa decomposition of sl 2 f is not unique for an element however in 10 we see that if g kau k a u where a a 0 0 a 1 and a a 0 0 a 1 then a a as a result is well defined we let u 1 0 s 1 s f sl 2 f and note that this group is isomorphic to the additive group f and so we define a measure du on u to be the haar measure on f normalized so that o has a total measure of 1 then the following lemma is well known lemma 4 18 if we fix a real number 2 then for any v we have u u du 1 1 q 1 1 q 1 observe that the map a of lemma 2 5 provides an isomorphism between u and u a moreover the measures du and du are identified under this isomorphism as a result we can equate the following integrals u a u du u 1 a u du assuming that we choose r correctly lemma 4 19 fix h to be real valued such that h i 2 then for any v and a w 4 20 u a u du 1 1 q ha 1 1 q ha 1 proof let 1 0 s 1 u then a 1 0 s 1 a s u u a the iwasawa decomposition of sl 2 f implies 1 0 s 1 k b 0 0 b 1 u eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 23 as a result in an iwasawa decomposition for u we may take its h component to be of the form a b 0 0 b 1 ha b for some b f our goal is to choose r so that 1 a u u for u u a we claim that we must set ha indeed with this choice we have 1 a u b b ha ha b u now the identity 4 20 is a direct result of lemma 4 18 and our choice of armed with lemma 4 19 we are prepared to prove proposition 4 16 proof of proposition 4 16 we assume h i 2 for i 1 l 1 and we want to show that for any v and w w u w u du a w w 1 w 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha as mentioned previously the proof is by induction on l w the length of the weyl group element base case to prove the base case we assume that l w 1 and therefore that w wi for some i 1 l 1 we begin by observing that wi i hence we have u wi i s s f u i moreover u wi w 1 i u i wi uw 1 i i u i and so u wi u du u i u du 1 1 q h i 1 1 1 q h i by lemma 4 19 and the fact that h i 1 induction step now suppose we choose w w with reduced expression wir wi 1 and that our proposition holds for all w w such that l w l w specifically we set w wir 1 wi 1 at the beginning of this subsection we showed that u w u r u w and so our integral breaks into 4 21 u r u w u 1 u 2 du 2 du 1 the measure du decomposes naturally by remark 4 14 let the element u 1 have the iwasawa decomposition k 1 h 1 u 1 recall that by definition is left invariant by k and right invariant by u in light of these observations and part 1 of lemma 3 14 we can make the following manipulations u 1 u 2 k 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 h 1 u 1 u 2 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 h 1 u 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 h 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 h 1 h 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 24 k h lee and p lombardo the integral in 4 21 now becomes 4 22 u r h 1 u w h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 du 2 du 1 we wish to show u 1 u 2 u 1 1 w 1 u w and note that it suffices to prove that w u 1 u 2 u 1 1 w 1 u we have w u 1 u 2 u 1 1 w 1 w u 1 w 1 w u 2 w 1 w u 11 w 1 since u 2 u w we have w u 2 w 1 u w u by definition for any u u r we have w uw 1 uw r u ir and so both w u 1 w 1 and w u 11 w 1 are elements of u ir u hence u 1 u 2 u 1 1 w 1 u w the decomposition 4 3 provides us with the unique group decomposition w 1 u w u w w 1 u w u let be the projection from w 1 u w u w which exists by the decomposition above then u 1 u 2 u 1 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 u 2 for u 2 w 1 u w u since h normalizes u we get h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 u 2 h 1 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 h 1 u 2 h 1 1 h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 u h 1 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 h 1 1 the map from u w to itself defined by u 2 7 u 1 u 2 u 1 1 is a unimodular change of variables so the integral 4 22 becomes u r h 1 u w h 1 u 2 h 1 1 du 2 du 1 now applying the change of variables h 1 u 2 h 1 1 7 u 2 has the following effect on our integral u r h 1 u w h 1 u 2 h 1 1 du 2 du 1 u r h 1 h 1 u w u 2 du 2 du 1 where we have a w 1 w w a w 1 see 6 our calculations so far have proven the following

hypothesis u w u 2 du 2 a w w 1 w 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha moreover observe that u r h w 1 1 du 1 u r w 1 u du 1 and so by lemma 4 19 we obtain u r h w 1 1 du 1 1 1 q w 1 h r 1 1 q w 1 h r 1 since we have w 1 h r w h r h w 1 r h ir 1 we obtain w 1 h r h r 1 and u r h w 1 1 du 1 1 1 q h r 1 1 1 q h r putting all of these calculations together we see u w u du u r h w 1 1 du 1 u w u 2 du 2 1 1 q h r 1 1 1 q h r a w 1 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha finally since w w 1 w r w 1 we obtain the desired result 4 4 finishing the computation in this final subsection we use the previous results to finish our calculation of the constant term e recall that by proposition 4 11 we have e g md w w h md w u w a u du in our next step we use proposition 4 16 to evaluate u w a u du note that the space u w a can be identified with the product of w copies of a since we have assumed that is real we can apply the monotone convergence theorem to see that u w a u du q w 1 g lim s s u w u du 26 k h lee and p lombardo where we use the relation a 9 and the following remark there in the expression above we take s to range over the finite subsets of v now by proposition 4 16 this is equal to lim s s a w w 1 w 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha a w w 1 w lim s s 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha a w w 1 w v 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha let f s denote the zeta function associated to the function field f see 17 then f s v 1 1 1 qs whenever re s 1 since we have assumed h i 2 we have that ha 1 for any a w as a result we obtain that v 1 1 q ha 1 1 1 q ha f ha f ha 1 we set c w q w 1 g a w w 1 w f ha f ha 1 finally we obtain the main result of this section theorem 4 23 for any g khu g a and h such that h i 2 for i 1 l 1 we have 4 24 e g md w w h md w c w we saw at the end of section 3 that in order to prove the almost everywhere convergence of the series e it suffices to show 4 25 w w u a u a f e w h mdu du for h varying in compact sets of h a when is a real character in this section we showed that the series 4 25 is the same as the series 4 24 so to establish the almost everywhere convergence of the eisenstein series e we direct our attention to proving that the series 4 24 converges for h varying in compact sets of h a we will prove this result in the next section eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 27 we also note that theorem 4 23 closely resembles garland s result for the constant term of the eisenstein series over g r 4 with the riemann zeta function replaced by the zeta function of the function field 5 convergence of the constant term in this section we prove the convergence of the series 4 24 by showing that if h varies in a compact subset of h a then the series 4 24 is bounded above by a theta series in r in order to establish this result we require an additional condition on the tuplem m v which determines the automorphism md specifically we will further assume that v log q mv 0 this will be important for the calculation in section 5 4 we will approach this proof by treating the factor h md w in subsections 5 2 through 5 5 and the factor c w in subsection 5 6 in the final subsection we will combine the results to finish proving the convergence of the series 4 24 which is indeed the constant term e of e we begin with considering the compact subsets of h a 5 1 topology of the torus and compact sets recall that a l 1 has the product topol ogy induced by the standard topology on a in remark 3 7 we defined the surjective group homomorphism a l 1 h a through this map we put the quotient topology on h a clearly the ide lic norm a r 0 is a continuous map moreover one can see that if s 1 sl 1 l 1 i 1 h i si 1 then si 1 for each i as a result we have a well defined continuous map h a r 0 l 1 given by l 1 i 1 h i si 7 s 1 sl 1 let c be a compact set of h a and pri be the i th projection of r 0 l 1 then for each i the image pri c is compact in r 0 and there exist ri ri r 0 such that ri pri h ri for any h c if we set r min r 1 rl 1 and r max r 1 rl 1 then for any h l 1 i 1 h i si c we have r si r for i 1 l 1 therefore we conclude lemma 5 1 let c be a compact set of h a then there exists r r r 0 such that for any h h 1 s 1 h l 1 sl 1 c we have r si r for i 1 l 1 28 k h lee and p lombardo for the rest of the section we fix a compact subset c of h a along with positive real numbers r and r that satisfy the conditions of lemma 5 1 we wish to prove that 5 2 w w h md w c w is bounded by a theta series in r as h varies in c clearly w w h md w c w h md w w h md w c w in the next four subsections we focus on finding a bound for h md w 5 2 preliminary calculation in section 3 we fixed the automorphism md where m m v is an infinite tuple of integers such that m 0 for almost all v however we could replace d with any element of h e to obtain a similar automorphism to be more precise let n n v be an infinite tuple of integers where n 0 for almost all v for h h e and v we define the local automorphism n h to i preserve each weight space v f and ii act on each weight space by n h v n h v for v v f then we consider the product of these local automorphisms and define the global automorphism nh v n h note that this automorphism only affects a finite number of places an element h can be considered an element of h e by setting d 0 with this in mind for h we define 5 3 nh v n h one can easily see that for w w we have nh w w 1 nh if s s v a then ord s ord s v is a tuple of integers with the property that ord s 0 for almost all then we see that 5 4 ord s h i h i s for each i moreover since d 0 we also have md 1 as a notational convenience we set and consider the factor 5 5 h md w for some w w let h h 1 s 1 h l 1 sl 1 then by our observation in 5 4 we have hw l 1 i 1 si w h i l 1 i 1 ord si h i w eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 29 as a result the factor 5 5 becomes l 1 i 1 ord si h i md w ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 md w w 1 ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 md v w 1 ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 m d v 1 q w 1 ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 m d 5 6 for the remainder of this subsection we will focus on calculating 5 7 w 1 ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 m d the affine weyl group of g e can be decomposed into a semi direct product of the classical weyl group and a group of translations w w t in particular t th h hz for more information see 2 4 or 11 using this product decomposition we may express w 1 w 1 th for some w 1 w and h hz moreover we note that for any h hz the translation th does not affect the imaginary co root h and we recall that the classical weyl group leaves h and d invariant in order to calculate the element of h e in 5 7 we will use this decomposition of w 1 and a particular result from 4 which we summarize in the following lemma lemma 5 8 garland 4 let h h and th be the translation element associated to h hz we have the following formula 5 9 th h d h h d h h 2 h h h where is the normalized bilinear form on h we let w 1 w 1 th for w 1 w and th t for each v we set l 1 i 1 ord si h i h e h where h h and e r we begin our calculation by making these substitutions w 1 ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 m d w 1 th h e h m d after factoring out m for m 6 0 we have w 1 th h e h m d w 1 m th h m d e m h w 1 m th h m d th e m h 30 k h lee and p lombardo the translation th does not affect the imaginary root so if we apply lemma 5 8 we see this equals w 1 m h m h d h h 2 h m h h e m h w 1 h m h m d m h h 2 h h e h w 1 h m w 1 h m d m h h 2 h h e h 5 10 where the last equality follows from the fact that the classical weyl group element w 1 does not affect d or h one can check that the same formula holds for m 0 substituting 5 10 into 5 6 we obtain that h md w v 1 q w 1 ord s 1 h 1 ord sl 1 h l 1 m d v 1 q w 1 h m w 1 h m d m h h 2 h h e h we continue to break up this product by writing it as a product of three factors that we obtain by grouping the parts appearing in the exponent of 1 q since d 0 the factor containing m d disappears from our computation in particular we have the following proposition proposition 5 11 the term h md w appearing in e g md is the product of the following three factors i v 1 q w 1 h e h ii v 1 q m w 1 h m h h 2 h iii v 1 q h h h remark 5 12 note the calculations in this subsection work for any w w in this subsection we calculated the term h md w explicitly and showed that it is a product of the factors i ii and iii above in the next three subsections we will work with each factor individually showing that if we let h vary in a compact set c we have an upper bound that depends on w w 5 3 bounding factor i of the product we wish to find an upper bound for the product 5 13 v 1 q w 1 h e h eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 31 first notice that since we set h e h l 1 i 1 ord si h i we have v 1 q w 1 h e h v w 1 h e w 1 h l 1 i 1 ord si w 1 h i l 1 i 1 ord si h i w 1 1 hw 1 1 by our observation in 5 4 hence it is our goal to prove there exists an upper bound for the factor hw 1 1 for any w 1 w the classical weyl group since the classical weyl group is a finite group and we fixed h we know there exist real numbers m 1 and m 1 such that m 1 w 1 1 h i m 1 for all i 1 l 1 and w 1 w moreover we assumed in the beginning of the section that we are choosing h to vary in a compact set c of h a such that for any h h 1 s 1 h l 1 sl 1 c we have r si r for each i combining these we see that there exists a positive constantm such that h i si w 1 1 si w 1 1 h i m for all i 1 l 1 and w 1 w hence we conclude lemma 5 14 5 15 v 1 q w 1 h e h hw 1 1 ml 1 for all w 1 w 5 4 bounding factor ii of the product we now turn our focus to factor ii so we consider the infinite product 5 16 v 1 q m w 1 h m h h 2 h however recall that in the definition of the automorphism md we specified m m v where m z m 0 for all but a finite number of now we further assume that log q m 0 let s v m 6 0 then our infinite product above reduces to the finite product s 1 q m w 1 h m h h 2 h s 1 q m w 1 h s 1 q m h h 2 h 5 17 32 k h lee and p lombardo we will treat each product in 5 17 separately beginning with the factor involving w 1 h if we write h h h 1 2 for h h we can prove the following lemma lemma 5 18 there exists n 1 0 such that for any h hz and w 1 w 5 19 s 1 q m w 1 h n h 1 proof let b 0 h h h 1 then this is clearly a compact set of h where the topology on h is the metric topology induced by the norm the linear map b 0 r is a continuous map and hence is bounded since w preserves b 0 we can find a real number n 1 such that w 1 h n 1 for all w 1 w and h b 0 let h be any element of hz then w 1 h w 1 h h h and we note that h h b 0 so we see that for all w 1 w and h hz w 1 h n 1 h now we have s 1 q m w 1 h exp s log q m w 1 h exp s log q m n 1 h we set n 1 exp s log q m n 1 and obtain the desired inequality 5 19 next we consider the other factor from 5 17 specifically s 1 q m h h 2 h recalling that h i 2 for each i 1 2 l 1 we see h 0 we have s 1 q m h h 2 h exp 1 2 s log q m h 2 h we write n 2 exp 1 2 s log q m h since we assumed s log q m 0 we get 0 n 2 1 thus we obtain lemma 5 20 if we write 5 21 s 1 q m h h 2 h n h 2 2 then 0 n 2 1 eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 33 5 5 bounding factor iii of the product we finally consider factor iii in particular we find a bound for the infinite product 5 22 v 1 q h h h since we set h e h l 1 i 1 ord si h i and h h 0 for all h hz we can make the following changes h h l 1 i 1 ord si h i e h h l 1 i 1 ord si h i h as a result the infinite product in 5 22 becomes v l 1 i 1 1 q ord si h i h h l 1 i 1 v 1 q ord si h i h h l 1 i 1 si h i h h as before we let b 0 h h h 1 for each i 1 l 1 we consider the continuous maps determined by the bilinear form h i b 0 r since we are only considering l 1 different images of the compact set b 0 in r we can find numbers n and n such that n h i h n for all h b 0 using the same argument as in lemma 5 18 we conclude that for any h hz and i 1 2 l 1 we have n h h i h n h or equivalently n h h h i h h n h h since h 0 since we assumed that h varies in the compact set c h a we know that r si r for i 1 l 1 it is now straightforward to prove the following lemma lemma 5 23 there exists a constant n 3 such that for any h hz we have 5 24 v 1 q h h h l 1 i 1 si h i h h n l 1 h 3 now we collect the results of subsections 5 2 through 5 5 and summarize them in a proposition recall that proposition 5 11 proved that h md w is the product of the factors i ii and iii by combining this with the results of lemmas 5 14 5 18 5 20 and 5 23 we obtain lemma 5 25 for w w we write w 1 w 1 th where w 1 w and h hz we have the following upper bound for the factor h md w h md w ml 1 n h 1 n l 1 h 3 n h 2 2 34 k h lee and p lombardo in subsection 5 7 we wish to bound the constant term by a theta series to this end we rewrite n h 1 n l 1 h 3 e log n 1 n l 1 3 h and n h 2 2 e logn 2 h 2 we set 1 log n 1 n l 1 3 and 2 logn 2 since n 2 1 we have 2 0 we state our final result in the following proposition proposition 5 26 for w w suppose w 1 w 1 th where w 1 w and h hz there exist constants m 1 and 2 that do not depend on w w such that 2 0 and 5 27 h md w ml 1 e 1 h 2 h 2 5 6 bounding the zeta functions in this subsection we focus on bounding the c w factor in the constant term e recall the definition c w q w 1 g a w w 1 w f ha f ha 1 standard techniques involving zeta functions establish the following lemma lemma 5 28 let s c and 0 then for all s such that re s 1 we have q 1 g f s f s 1 m where m is a positive constant in particular we can take m q 1 g f 1 2 corollary 5 29 there exists a positive constant m such that for each w w we have c w m w proof for any a w we have ha l 1 i 1 kih i where ki z 0 and at least one ki 6 0 since h i 2 for i 1 l 1 there exists 0 such that ha 1 for any a w it is known that w w 1 w w 12 now the corollary follows from lemma 5 28 each w w can be expressed as w w 1 th for w 1 w and some h hz and we have w w 1 th however since the classical weyl group is finite w 1 can only be as large as the length of the longest element of w thus for each w w m w m w 1 m th m m th in 8 17 of 4 we see that there exists a postive constant 3 such that th 3 h in light of these observations we have the following proposition proposition 5 30 there exists a positive constants m m and 3 such that c w m m 3 h for each w w 1 th w eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 35 5 7 bounding the constant term by a theta series in this final subsection we prove that if h varies in a compact set of h a then the sum 5 31 w w h md w c w is bounded above by a theta series hence the constant term of the eisenstein e is absolutely convergent for these compact sets by substituting the results of propositions 5 26 and 5 30 we see h md w w h md w c w h md h hz ml 1 e 1 h 2 h 2 m m 3 h h md w ml 1 m h hz e log m 3 1 h 2 h 2 where w is the cardinality of the finite weyl group w it is essential to note that 2 0 so this theta series converges as a result of this computation we have proven the following theorem theorem 5 32 let h such that h i 2 for i 1 l 1 and let c w ql w 1 g a w w 1 w f ha f ha 1 assume that log q m 0 for m m then the infinite series w w h md w c w converges absolutely and uniformly for h varying in any compact set of h a remark 5 33 combining the above theorem with 3 21 definition 3 22 and theorem 4 23 we have proved the identities e g md u a u a f e g mdu du w w h md w c w and established convergence of the constant term e 6 convergence of the eisenstein series in this section we will use the results of the previous sections to prove the convergence of the eisenstein series e recall that in section 4 we skipped the proof of the measurability of e with respect to du in the next subsection we prove this fact 36 k h lee and p lombardo 6 1 measurability of the eisenstein series the constant term of the eisenstein series e is defined to be the following integral e g md u a u a f e g mdu du it is the purpose of this subsection to prove that the map u 7 e g mdu is a du measurable function observe however that since is left invariant by k and md normalizes u a it is enough to show that for a fixed h h a the map u 7 e h mdu is a du measurable function as in section 4 we express the eisenstein series as the sum e h mdu w w e w h mdu in turn each e w h mdu is also a sum of particular values for recall that we set f w f b f w b f and defined 6 1 e w h mdu f w f w b f h mdu and we saw in section 4 that we may take the coset representatives above to be of the form bw where b u w f now with respect to our coherently ordered basis u w f is a finite dimensional space for each w w and as such we can choose our coset representatives of f w f w b f to come from this finite dimensional space in appendix a we construct the measure du by expressing u a u a f as a projective limit of compact spaces part of this construction is important for this discussion so we briefly state some definitions from that section for the coherently ordered basis b v v 1 we let v f s denote the f span of the vectors v v 1 vs by setting u s u u f u v f s id we may define the restricted direct product u a s u s with respect to the subgroup u s k and let u s a u a u a s as proved in the appendix u a lim s u s a since we may choose our coset representatives f w f w b f so that they come from a finite dimensional space there exists an s large enough so that for any u u a s and as above we have u u for some u u a then we observe that 6 2 h mdu h md u h md using and f w f w b f we define the function from u a to r 0 by setting 6 3 u h mdu by the observation 6 2 in the previous paragraph defines a function on the finite dimensional space u a u a s for s large enough we will see in appendix a that we may consider u a u a s as eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 37 embedded into the group of upper triangular s 1 s 1 block matrices with entries from a most importantly for any f w f w b f the function can be written as a composition of continuous maps and hence measurable on the space u a u a s then it follows from the definition of the measure du in appendix a that the function is a measurable function on u a u a f for a fixed h h a and w w we define the function w from u a u a f to r 0 by sending u 7 e w h mdu f w f w b f u the function is a positive measurable function for every above and so w u is also a measurable function on u a f u a to see this we view 6 4 w sup finite sums of and note that this is measurable likewise for a fixed h h a we can consider e as a function from the quotient u a u a f to the positive real numbers by sending u 7 e h mdu since e can be expressed as the sum over the affine weyl group of the positive measurable functions w we conclude lemma 6 5 for any h h a the function e is a du measurable function into the positive real numbers 6 2 convergence of the series the eisenstein series e on g a md can be considered as the function from h a u a u a f to r 0 defined by 6 6 h u 7 e h md u moreover theorem 5 32 proved that the constant term e g md u a u a f e g mdu du w w h md w c w is absolutely convergent for h varying in compact sets of h a however this also tells us that the eisenstein series e is integrable with respect to du for h varying in any compact subset of h a hence the series e is convergent almost everywhere on h a u a u a f since h a is locally compact moreover we can prove the following proposition proposition 6 7 let h be a real character such that h i 2 for i 1 l 1 and let m m v be a tuple such that m z 0 and 0 m then the series e h mdu absolutely converges to a positive real number for all h u h a u a u a f proof the remarks in the previous paragraph tell us that the series e h mdu converges for all h u h a u a u a f off a set of measure zero assume that e h mdu for some h u we claim that there exists a subset u u a of positive measure such that h mdu h md 1 u a k for all u u if the claim is true we will have e h mdu u e h mdu 38 k h lee and p lombardo for all u u since the set u u has positive measure it is a contradiction now we prove the claim we write u u and u l i 1 h i i where f x xf x and i f x with i 1 mod x it follows from direct computation that if a 0 a 1 x a 2 x 2 then m d m d where a 0 a 1 m x a 2 2 m x 2 we also write h h v and h l 1 i 1 h i si then we obtain h i si h i si 1 s h i i by 13 10 of 2 recall that m 0 for all and ord si 0 for almost all because of these conditions on m and ord si it is straightforward to construct the set u of the claim having established this important proposition the following theorem is a simple consequence of the dominated convergence theorem and the fact that ere dominates e for any complex character theorem 6 8 for a complex valued h such that re h i 2 for i 1 l 1 and for a tuple m m v such that m z 0 and 0 m the infinite series e h mdu f f b f h mdu absolutely converges for all h u h a u a u a f 7 functional equations for the constant term in this section we will establish meromorphic continuation of the constant term of the eisen stein series and prove their functional equations we will begin by stating some results for the zeta function of the global function field f 7 1 background on the zeta function of a function field we refer the reader to 17 for specifics on the definition of the zeta function associated to a global function field f the following result from 17 describes the functional equation for f s theorem 7 1 let f be a global function field in one variable over a finite constant field fq suppose f is of genus g then there exists a polynomial lf u z u of degree 2 g such that 7 2 f s lf q s 1 q s 1 q 1 s for re s 1 moreover 7 2 provides an analytic continuation of f to the complex plane if we set f s q g 1 s f s then we have the functional equation 7 3 f s f 1 s eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 39 using the functional equation for f s we prove the following lemma lemma 7 4 let f s be the zeta function associated to f and f s q g 1 s f s its com pleted form then the following identities hold f s f 1 s q 2 s 1 1 g f s f 1 s q 2 s 1 1 g and f s f 1 s f s f 1 s q 2 1 g proof these computations follow by replacing f s with q s 1 g f s and using the functional equation of f s for example we consider calculation for the second identity f s f 1 s f s f 1 s q s 1 g f s q 1 s 1 g f 1 s q s 1 g q 1 s 1 g q 2 s 1 1 g the first identity follows in the same manner and third one is simply the product of the other two identities 7 2 meromorphic continuation we first note that the function c w is well defined as meromorphic function for any h e c we assume that 7 5 re h 0 since h h the dual coxeter number this assumption is equivalent to 7 6 re h h we fix 0 and set c h e c re h recall that if a w we have ha h mh for some and m z 0 thus there exists a finite set w such that re ha 1 for all a w and for any c let f c be the set of all c such that the function f ha f ha 1 has a pole for some a then f is contained in the union of a countable locally finite family of hyperplanes lemma 7 7 suppose that b is a bounded open subset of h e c whose closure is contained in the set c assume that the function f ha f ha 1 has no pole for any b and for any a then there are positive constants m and m such that for each w w we have c w m m w proof since is a finite set and independent of w this lemma is proved by a slight modification of the proof of corollary 5 29 theorem 7 8 the constant term e g md w w h md w c w is a meromor phic function for h e c satisfying re h 0 or equivalently re h h 40 k h lee and p lombardo proof assume that b is a bounded open subset of h e c whose closure is contained in the set c f where the set f is defined above consider a compact subset c of h a if we replace corollary 5 29 with lemma 7 7 all the other arguments in the proof of theorem 5 32 remain valid to prove that the infinite sum w w h md w c w converges uniformly and absolutely as varies over b and h varies over c since was arbitrary the theorem follows 7 3 proving functional equations we wish to prove functional equations for the constant term of the eisenstein series e on g a the following property of the function c w is essential proposition 7 9 with c w defined as above and w w w we have 7 10 c ww c w w c w where w is the usual shifted action of w on h i e w w we will prove this proposition at the end of this section first we show that this proposition leads to the following functional equation for the constant term of the eisenstein series theorem 7 11 assume that h e c satisfies the condition re h h then we have re w h h and 7 12 e g md c w e w g md for any w w proof for the first assertion we only need to consider the simple reflections wi w we have wi h wi h hi i h h since we assumed re h h the the first assertion follows now we fix an arbitrary element w of the affine weyl group then for any w w we set w w w 1 so that w w w now by proposition 7 9 we have e g md w w h md w c w w w h md w w c w w w w h md w w c w w c w c w w w h md w w c w w c w e w g md in order to establish this functional equation for e it suffices to prove proposition 7 9 proof of proposition 7 9 recall that we want to show that for any w w w we have c ww c w w c w we proceed by an induction argument and first consider the following cases eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 41 case 1 suppose that wi is a simple reflection w w satisfies wwi 1 w and w 1 wir wi 1 is a reduced expression then since w w 1 w w 1 the discussion in section 4 3 shows w w 1 w 1 r where j wir wij 1 ij if we let w wwi then we can see w w 1 w wi 1 wi r i now we have c w q 1 l w 1 g w w 1 w f h f h 1 q 1 g f h i f h i 1 ql w 1 g w w 1 w f hwi f hwi 1 c wi c wi w since hwi wi h wi h this is our desired result so we move on to our second case case 2 suppose wi is a simple reflection and w w such that wwi w 1 if this is the case then w has a reduced expression w wi 1 wir where wir wi if we set w wi 1 wir 1 then w w wi and w wwi and w wi 1 w as such we can apply the result of case 1 to this situation with wi and we see c w c w wi c wi w c wi c wwi c wi so by solving for the factor c wwi we see that c wwi c wi w c wi wi 1 in order to prove our result for this case it suffices to show that 7 13 c wi c wi wi 1 observe that c wi c wi wi q 2 1 g f h i f h i 1 f wi h i f wi h i 1 q 2 1 g f h i f h i 1 f h i f h i 1 in lemma 7 4 we calculated the value of this product of zeta functions so we conclude that c wi c wi wi q 2 1 g q 2 1 g 1 as a result we see c wwi c wi w c wi the desired result we now consider the general case 42 k h lee and p lombardo general case the proof is by induction on the length of w if w 1 then the proofs of case 1 and case 2 secure our result now suppose the result holds for w k we consider w w such that w k 1 and write w w wi for some simple reflection wi and with w w 1 by cases 1 and 2 and the induction hypothesis we obtain c ww c ww wi c wi ww c wi c w wi w c wi w c wi c w wi w c w wi c w w c w since c wi w c wi c w wi this completes our proof of proposition 7 9 appendix a measures in this appendix we will describe various measures that are important for our calculation of the constant term of an eisenstein series the first subsection addresses the technique of constructing a measure by means of a projective limit of a family of measures a 1 the projective limit construction of a measure we begin by stating a result of 1 let u s ss s z 0 be a projective family of compact spaces and equip each u s with a regular borel probability measure du s if s s then by our assumption we have the map ss u s u s we say du s s z 0 is a consistent family of measures with respect to the projections s s if for any measurable set x u s we have du s ss 1 x du s x for any s s theorem a 1 1 suppose u s ss s z 0 is a projective family of compact spaces where du s is a regular borel probability measure on u s if du s s z 0 is a consistent family of measures with respect to the projections ss then 1 there is a unique regular borel probability measure du on the projective limit lim s u s 2 if s lim s u s u s is the canonical projection then for any measurable set x u s we have du s 1 x du s x corollary a 2 under the conditions of theorem a 1 if we further assume that each measure du s is translation invariant then du is also translation invariant proof our measure du is a borel measure so it is enough to show that this property holds for any open set y lim s u s however the projective limit of topological spaces inherits the coarsest topology such that the canonical projections s are all continuous it is a standard result that a basis for this topology consists of the sets s 1 x s for an open set x s u s hence the eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 43 translation invariance of the measure du is a result of part 2 of theorem a 1 and the invariance of the measure du s a 2 measure on the arithmetic quotient as mentioned in section 4 we need to define a measure on the quotient space u a u a f the main result of 1 allows us to define this measure du by expressing u a u a f as a projective limit of compact spaces u s a s u equipped with a consistent family of measures du s for a similar construction over q see 4 recall that we fixed a coherently ordered basis b v v 1 v 2 which we use as a basis for the vector space v f for s z 0 set v f s to be the f span of the vectors v v 1 vs and u s u u f u v f s id we define the restricted direct product u a s u s with respect to the subgroups u s k and let u s a u a u a s we first note that any element u u s a is an infinite tuple u v in 2 we see that each u is in the subgroup of s 1 s 1 strictly upper triangular block matrices with entries from f where the blocks are determined by the weight spaces of v z moreover we know that for all but a finite number of our entries are from o as such we may identify u s a with n copies of a for some n we give u s a the topology that makes this identification a homeomorphism and denote this homeomorphism by s lemma a 3 we have 1 u s a is a locally compact group for every s z 0 2 u a lim s u s a proof the first part follows from the local compactness of a and the homeomorphism s in order to prove the second part we first check that u s a ss forms a projective system suppose we have s s then v f s v f s for all v as a result we have that u a s u a s and obtain a unique surjective map ss u s a u s a such that ss p s p s where p s u a u a u a s u s a is the canonical projection now it is clear that u s a ss is a projective system and we have a surjective map u a lim s u s a such that s p s for every s z 0 where s denote the canonical projections from lim s u s a to u s a in order to prove the isomorphism we only need to show that is an injective map 44 k h lee and p lombardo suppose that x ker then x ker s for every s z 0 by the commutativity of our maps we have that x ker p s for every s z 0 and so x s z 0 u a s id thus is injective as well as surjective and we obtain the desired isomorphism between u a and lim s u s a under the homeomorphism s the product measure s on an becomes a haar measure on u s a to see this note that the effect of left multiplication in u s a through this homeomorphism is affine transformation of an in other words for x and y in an we have xy ax y bx where ax is a linear transformation of a n and bx a n the invariance of s is hence a direct result of the change of variables theorem and the fact that det ax 1 for all x we wish to define a measure on u a f u a the next lemma establishes this space as a projective limit of compact spaces lemma a 4 let s u p s f u a where p s u a u a u a s u s a is the canonical projection then 1 we have u a f u a lim s u s a s u and 2 for each s z 0 the space u s a s u is compact and has an invariant probability measure du s induced from the measure s on u s a proof 1 since ss s u s u we obtain the induced projection ss u s a s u u s a s u and the collection u s a s u ss s z 0 is a projective family then we have the natural map u a lim s u s a lim s u s a s u considering the kernel of the map we obtain u a f u a lim s u s a s u 2 recall that we can consider the space u s a to be embedded into the group of strictly upper triangular s 1 s 1 block matrices with entries from a similarly s u can be considered as a discrete subspace of u s a consisting of strictly upper triangular s 1 s 1 block matrices with entries from f diagonally embedded in a as a result the quotient space u s a s u is a classical object and it is well known that this is a compact space for more information see 16 moreover since s u is a discrete subgroup of the unimodular group u s a we have an invariant measure du s on u s a s u induced from s on u s a 16 and we normalize du s to have total measure 1 eisenstein series on affine kac moody groups over function fields 45 finally we must prove that the measures du s form a consistent family the induced measure du s may be considered as the restriction of the measure s to a fundamental domain for u s a s u for each s z 0 we choose a fundamental domain s for u s a s u such that ss s s then we have for a measurable subset x of u s a a 5 s ss 1 x s s x s lemma a 6 the set du s s z 0 forms a consistent family of measures proof let s u s a u s a s u be the canonical projection for s z 0 suppose that x is a measurable set of u s a s u then by our observation above du s x s s 1 x s to establish the consistency of the measures we need to calculate du s ss 1 x using a 5 we obtain du s ss 1 x s ss s 1 x s s s ss 1 x s s s 1 x s du s x and we conclude these measures form a consistent family finally we obtain the main result of this appendix in the following proposition proposition a 7 there exists a unique u a left invariant probability measure du on the arith metic quotient u a u a f proof this follows from lemma a 6 and theorem a 1 a 3 measures on other spaces before we discuss measures on other spaces we briefly recall some constructions from section 4 with respect to our coherently ordered basis b we fix u f to be the group of strictly lower triangular block matrices and set u w f to be u f wu fw 1 this definition works for all of our fields f and so we can define u w a v u w with respect to u w k by the decomposition 4 3 we know a 8 u a u w a u a wu aw 1 and we have the covering projection u a f u f wu fw 1 u a u a f we define the measure du on u a f u f wu fw 1 to be the one induced from the measure du on u a u a f through the projection 46 k h lee and p lombardo in light of the decompositions a 8 our measure du decomposes into two measures i the measure du 1 on u w a and ii the measure du 2 on u a wu aw 1 f u f wu fw 1 we construct the measure du 2 by expressing this space as a projective limit of compact spaces equipped with a haar probability measure we omit the details and note that the construction will be very similar to our proofs regarding the construction of the measure du on u a u a f using theorem a 1 the measure du 2 is a haar probability measure to construct du 1 we recall that every element of u u w a takes the form u a w w 1 w a sa for sa a for more information see section 4 3 the set w w 1 w is finite and of size w as in lemma a 3 we have a homeomorphism from u w a to a w the product measure induced from w copies of the haar measure on a becomes a haar measure on u w a where we normalize so that a f 1 we set du 1 to be this measure if we consider the haar measure on f with the normalization o 1 for each v we obtain from 2 1 3 of 18 that a 9 q 1 g if we let du 1 be the measure on u w f then we have du 1 q w 1 g du 1 a similar relation holds between du for u w a and the product of measures on local components in section 4 4
