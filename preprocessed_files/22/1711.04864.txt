families of closed subgroups of sl n qp the first family is the set of all parahoric subgroups of sl n qp although the chabauty com pactification of parahoric subgroups is well studied we give a different and more geometric proof using various levi decompositions of sl n qp let c be the subgroup of diagonal matrices in sl n qp the second family is the set of all sl n qp conjugates of c we give a classifica tion of the chabauty limits of conjugates of c using the action of sl n qp on its associated bruhat tits building and compute all of the limits for n 4 up to conjugacy in contrast for n 7 we prove there are infinitely many sl n qp nonconjugate chabauty limits of conjugates of c along the way we construct an explicit homeomorphism between the chabauty compact ification in sl n qp of sl n qp conjugates of the p adic lie algebra of c and the chabauty compactification of sl n qp conjugates of c 1 introduction for a locally compact topological space x the set of all closed subsets of x is a compact topological space with respect to the chabauty topology see proposition 2 1 given a family f of closed subsets of x it is natural to ask what is the closure of f with respect to the chabauty topology f and whether or not closed subsets of f satisfy the same properties as f we call elements of f the chabauty limits of f let x be a topological space admitting a continuous action by a locally compact group g so the stabilizer gx in g of every point x x is a closed subgroup of g then the closure of gx x x with respect to the chabauty topology gives a natural compactification of x called the chabauty compactification ofx examples include riemannian symmetric spaces gjt 98 and bruhat tits buildings gr 06 where points correspond to certain compact subgroups let g be a semisimple real lie group with finite center and finitely many connected compo nents and let k be the maximal compact subgroup work of guivarc h ji taylor gjt 98 shows many different compactifications of g k are homeomorphic guivarc h and re my gr 06 extend many of these results to bruhat tits buildings using a probabilistic method which holds for general semi simple algebraic groups g over non archimedean local fields caprace and le cureux cl 11 generalize these results to a larger class of buildings in section 5 we give a different and more geometric proof of gr 06 theorem 3 corollary 4 and hae 10 theorem 3 14 for sl n qp using various levi decompositions of sl n qp this geometric method works mainly for sl n qp and the reason is given after the proof of theorem 5 3 the various levi decompositions used for sl n qp are recalled and proved in section 4 for general closed non compact subgroups acting on locally finite thick affine buildings although the main part of section 4 is a brief overview of groups acting on affine buildings the last subsection is new see propositions 4 12 4 13 4 14 and lemma 4 16 and generalizes the notion of panel trees for a local field f we study a second family of closed subgroups of sl n f let c be the set of all diagonal matrices of sl n f also called the diagonal cartan subgroup haettel hae 13 corina ciobotaru gmail com aleitner math gmail com alain valette unine ch 1 http arxiv org abs 1711 04864 v 2 studies the chabauty compactification of all conjugates of c in sl n r and iliev and manivel im 05 study that compactification for sl n c in the second part of this paper we study the chabauty compactification cart sl n qp ch of all conjugates of c in sl n qp using the action of sl n qp on its associated bruhat tits building x we describe chabauty limits of c up to conjugacy and study how the different geometries produced by c and its limits change theorem 1 1 see theorems 6 32 6 36 6 37 let h cart sl n qp ch if h contains hy perbolic elements then h stabilizes a flat in x if h contains no hyperbolic elements then up to conjugacy h is contained in u n where u is the unipotent radical of the borel subgroup of sl n qp and n is the group of n th roots of unity in q p to prove the second part of theorem 1 1 we need to build a bijection between subgroups and sub algebras which we do in section 6 1 we construct an explicit bijection between cart sl n qp ch and the chabauty compactification cart sl n qp ch in sl n qp of all sl n qp conjugates of the lie subalgebra c sl n qp of c although there is a lie functor that has been well studied in bou 89 ser 06 and elsewhere this is functorial only to a neighbourhood the germ of the identity element of the lie group and for the p adic case the germ is very small and does not give a bi jection between lie groups and lie algebras it might be possible that a p adic lie algebra to be the lie algebra of two different p adic lie groups that share the same group germ for more see the introduction of section 6 1 the map we produce is a bijection and surprisingly it is continuous with respect to the chabauty topology in general canonical maps between spaces endowed with the chabauty topology are only upper lower semi continuous theorem 1 2 see propositions 6 22 6 23 6 24 corollary 6 25 the map gr cart sl n qp ch cart sl n qp ch a 7 gr a a id sl n qp is a homeomorphism regarding the algebras in cart sl n qp ch we also have proposition 1 3 see corollary 6 28 every element of cart sl n qp ch is an abelian subalgebra with respect to the lie bracket of sl n qp and of dimension n 1 chabauty limits of c in sl n r are classified in lei 16 b lei 16 hae 13 im 05 we extend these results and describe conjugacy classes of limits of c in sl n qp for n 4 and show there are finitely many theorem 1 4 see section 7 there are two chabauty limits of c up to conjugacy in sl 2 qp there are 4 q 3 chabauty limits of c up to conjugacy in sl 3 qp there are at least 12 q 2 q 4 chabauty limits of c up to conjugacy in sl 4 qp and less than 12 q 2 q 8 where qk q p q p k are computed in section 7 we explicitly write down all these chabauty limits in section 7 notice there are more conjugacy classes of limits over qp than over r since the galois group of the algebraic closure over qp is bigger following ideas in lei 16 b im 05 we show in section 8 that for n 5 not all abelian subalgebras of the dimension n 1 are chabauty limits of c moreover for n 7 we show there are infinitely many nonconjugate chabauty limits of c for n 5 6 it is unknown whether there are finitely or infinitely many nonconjugate chabauty limits of c in sl n qp 2 acknowledgements we thank uri bader marc burger yair glasner thomas haettel tobias hartnick and guy

chabauty topology cha 50 can be found in cdp 07 or hae 10 section 2 and the references therein we recall briefly some facts that are used in this paper for a locally compact topological space x we denote by f x the set of all closed subsets of x f x is endowed with the chabauty topology where every open set is a union of finite intersections of subsets of the form ok f f x f k where k is a compact subset of x or o u f f x f u 6 where u is an open subset of x by cdp 07 proposition 1 7 p 58 the space f x is compact with respect to the chabauty topology moreover if x is hausdorff and second countable then f x is separable and metrisable thus hausdorff see cem 06 proposition i 3 1 2 proposition 2 1 cdp 07 proposition 1 8 p 60 cem 06 proposition i 3 1 3 suppose x is a locally compact metric space a sequence of closed subsets fn n n f x converges to f f x if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied 1 for every f f there is a sequence fn fn n n converging to f 2 for every sequence fn fn n n if there is a strictly increasing subsequence nk k n such that fnk fnk k n converges to f then f f for a locally compact groupg we denote by s g the set of all closed subgroups ofg by cdp 07 proposition 1 7 p 58 the space s g is closed in f g with respect to the chabauty topology and thus compact moreover proposition 2 1 can be applied to a sequence of closed subgroups hn n n s g converging to h s g obtaining a similar characterisation of convergence in s g we thank daryl cooper for suggesting the next idea a group h satisfies an universal relation if there is a finitely generated free group f and a word w f such that for all homomorphisms f h we have w 1 for example an abelian group satisfies xyx 1 y 1 1 proposition 2 2 if h g satisfies a universal relation w then so does every g conjugacy limit l of h proof the main idea of the proof follows as in bridson de la harpe kleptsyn bdlhk 09 propo sition 3 4 i let gn k g be such that gkhg 1 k k converges to l in the chabauty topology suppose for contradiction that l does not satisfy the universal relation of h then for every finitely generated free group f and for every word in v f there is a homomorphism f l such that v 6 1 in particular take the free group f and the word w f given by the universal relation of h then there exist l 1 ln l such that w l 1 ln 6 1 moreover as the multiplication in g is continuous there exist neighborhoods of the identity ui for each i 1 n so that for all l i li ui then w l 1 l n 6 1 set u n i 1 ui and consider the neighborhood of l in s g v v l 1 ln u 1 l d s g d l 1 ln l u 1 l l 1 ln d u 1 then for all d v we have l 1 ln d u 1 in particular there exists l i d for 1 i n such that l i liui but every element li l is approximated by a sequence of elements from gkhg 1 k k thus as k gkhg 1 k does not satisfy the universal relation which gives the necessary contradiction 3 3 on affine buildings when working with a semi simple algebraic group g over a non archimedean local field e g the p adic field qp its associated symmetric space is the bruhat tits building that is a locally finite thick affine building see ab 08 gar 97 ron 89 in the davis realisation every locally finite affine building is a cat 0 space and one can define the visual boundary of denoted by by the theory of cat 0 spaces the space admits a cone topology for definitions see bh 99 part ii section 8 and it is a compact space moreover is a spherical building called the spherical building at infinity of we denote by aut the group of all automorphisms of the group aut is endowed with the compact open topology and it is a totally disconnected locally compact group e g the pointwise stabilizer in aut of a finite number of points of is compact and open the set of all such pointwise stabilizers forms a basis for the compact open topology on aut let x be a point a sequence gn n n aut converges to the automorphism g aut if for every r 0 there exists nr 0 such that gn y g y for every y b x r and every n nr recall a closed subgroup g aut acts continuously on this means for every xn n n that converges to x with respect to the cone topology on and every gn n n g that converges to g g with respect to the group topology on g we have gn xn n n converges to g x with respect to the cone topology on definition 3 1 let a be a building e g a spherical building or an affine building and g aut we say that g acts strongly transitivly on if for any two pairs 1 c 1 and 2 c 2 consisting of apartments i a and chambers ci of i there exists g g such that g 1 2 g c 1 c 2 and by preserving the types of the vertices of c 1 and c 2 recall buildings are colorable i e the vertices of any chamber are colored differently and any chamber uses the same set of colors we say that g aut is type preserving if g preserves the coloration of the building we say that g aut is type preserving if all elements of g are type preserving the bruhat tits building x associated with sl n qp is constructed in gar 97 chapter 19 for example and it is considered with its maximal system of apartments the building x is locally finite thick affine of type a n 1 and of dimension n 1 example 3 2 for sl 2 qp the bruhat tits building x is a p 1 regular tree it is an affine building of dimension 1 where an apartment is a bi infinite geodesic line of the tree and a chamber is an edge the group sl n qp is a closed subgroup of aut x that acts strongly transitively and by type preserving automorphisms on x also sl n qp acts strongly transitively on its spherical building at infinity x definition 3 3 let x d be a cat 0 space and let be an isometry of x let min x x d x x where infx x d x x denotes the translation length of if min is the empty set then is parabolic if min is not the empty set then is elliptic if 0 otherwise is hyperbolic a semi simple isometry of x is by definition either elliptic or hyperbolic when is an affine building any element of aut is either elliptic or hyperbolic lemma 3 4 let be a locally finite affine building and g be a closed non compact subgroup of aut suppose the sequence gn n n g converges to an isometry g g if g is elliptic resp hyperbolic then there exists n 0 such that gn is elliptic resp hyperbolic for every n n in particular g gn for every n n 4 proof as g aut either g is elliptic or g is hyperbolic suppose g is elliptic then there exists x min g thus g x x by considering a ball b x r around x with r 0 there exists nr with the required properties suppose g is hyperbolic then min g is not empty and g invariant min g gmin g in particular for every x min g we have gn x min g for every n z moreover gn x n z is contained in an apartment of that is not necessarily unique and the points gn x n z are on a bi infinite euclidean line that forms a translation axis of g thus by taking a ball b x r with r big enough such that g 4 x b x r then there exists nr 0 such that gn y g y for every y b x r and every n nr in particular the oriented segment x g x is sent by every gn with n nr to the segment g x g 2 x preserving the orientation moreover as x g x and g x g 2 x are collinear and because the orientation is not reversed by cc 15 lemma 2 8 we have gn is a hyperbolic element and gn g for every n nr 4 decompositions of groups acting on affine buildings let be a locally finite thick affine building with the complete system of apartments and let g be a closed subgroup of aut that acts strongly transitively and by type preserving automorphisms on a good maximal compact subgroup of g is the stabilizer stabg x g g g x x of a special vertex x of for the definition of a special vertex see gar 97 sec 16 1 for the rest of the article we fix an apartment of and a special vertex x and let k stabg x the cartan subgroup c of g is the centre of the subgroup stabg g g g since g acts transitively on the set of all apartments of the subgroup c is unique up to conjugation in g let fixg g g g z z z let ch resp ch be the set of all chambers of the spherical building resp spherical apartment let c ch ch be an ideal chamber of that is fixed for what follows the borel subgroup b of g is the closed subgroup b stabg c g g g c c since g acts on strongly transitively and induces a strongly transitively action on the visual boundary the borel subgroup b is unique up to conjugation in g let b 0 g g g c c g elliptic recall w aff stabg fixg is the affine weyl group associated with the affine building w aff saff is the affine coxeter system of and saff is the set of the reflexions through the walls of a chamber in ch another well known fact is that w aff contains a maximal abelian normal subgroup isomorphic to zm whose elements are euclidean translation automorphisms of the apartment and m is the euclidean dimension of denote this maximal abelian normal subgroup by a and note its elements are images of hyperbolic automorphisms of in particular every element of a can be lifted not in a unique way to a hyperbolic element of g note for a general closed strongly transitive and type preserving subgroup g of aut its cor responding abelian subgroup a w aff does not necessarily lift to an abelian subgroup of g still this is the case if we consider g to be a semi simple algebraic group over a non archimedean local field e g g sl n qp by the theory of bruhat tits the abelian group a w aff is in fact the restriction to of a maximal split torus of g which is abelian note the subgroups k c a b all depend on the choice of the apartment the special vertex x and the ideal chamber c ch in particular the decompositions below also depend on the choice of x and c lemma 4 1 cartan decomposition for a proof see cio 15 lemma 4 7 let g be a strongly transitive and type preserving subgroup of aut that is not necessarily closed then g kak 5 lemma 4 2 iwasawa decomposition for a proof see cio 15 p 14 let g be a strongly tran sitive and type preserving subgroup of aut that is not necessarily closed then g kab 0 and b ab 0 remark 4 3 for a general affine building and g a strongly transitive and type preserving subgroup of aut not necessarily closed the cartan and iwasawa decompositions above do not hold for x a non special vertex and k stabg x if x is not special the translation subgroup of the affine weyl group of g might not act transitively on the set of non special vertices of the same type which is an ingredient in the proofs of the cartan and iwasawa decompositions the weyl group associated with the affine building is the group w stabg stabg b here w s is the finite coxeter system of and s is the set of all the reflexions through the walls in that determine the chamber c ch fixing the vertex x so w is a finite group in contrast to the infinite w aff for a simplex of c there is a unique coxeter subsystem wi i of w s such that s s s i let p i g g g g for c the corresponding wi i id and p b note b p i for every wi i coxeter subsystem of w s and p i is unique up to conjugation in g the subgroups p i are closed subgroups of g and are called the parabolic subgroups of g the borel subgroup b is the minimal parabolic among them for an ideal chamber c ch there is a unique ideal chamber c ch opposite c every simplex of c has a unique opposite simplex in with c the coxeter subsystem wi i associated with equals the one of still the corresponding parabolic subgroups are not the same to avoid the confusion when and are opposite ideal simplices in we denote p i g g g g and p i g g g g correspondingly for opposite ideal chambers we use the notation b gc b gc we also use the notation g 0 g g g g elliptic definition 4 4 see section 3 of bw 04 let g be a totally disconnected locally compact group and take a g the parabolic and contraction subgroups associated to a are 1 p a g g a ngan n n is bounded u a g g lim n a ngan e the group p a is a closed subgroup of g but in general u a is not closed similarly we define p a and u a using a nga n example 4 5 we apply definition 4 4 to a hyperbolic element a g where g aut and is a locally finite affine building every hyperbolic element a aut admits unique attracting and repelling endpoints and contained in then and are the endpoints of the translation axis of a proposition 4 6 levi decomposition for a proof see cio 15 prop 4 15 and cor 4 17 let g be a closed strongly transitive and type preserving subgroup of aut let be an apartment in and assume there is a hyperbolic automorphism a stabg let be the attracting and repelling endpoints of a and the unique simplices in whose interior contain respectively note is opposite and let wi i be the corresponding coxeter subsystem of then p a g p i u a mi where mi g g and u a is normal in g 0 and g in particular g 0 u a mi g 0 remark 4 7 let a b stabg be two hyperbolic elements with attracting endpoints in the interior of the same unique simplex in by proposition 4 6 one can see that u a u b thus we define u i u a and call it the unipotent radical of p i g note u i depends only on 6 the simplex and not on the chosen hyperbolic element a the subgroup mi is called the levi factor subgroup of p i remark 4 8 let g be a semi simple algebraic group over a non archimedean local field k and let g g k be the group of all k rational points of g over the completion of k for example g sl n qp denote by the corresponding locally finite thick affine building of dimension m on which g acts by type preserving automorphisms and strongly transitively let be the apartment that corresponds to the abelian subgroup a zm of the affine weyl group w aff of g as a can be lifted to an abelian subgroup of g one can choose a basis of hyperbolic elements 1 m stabg for the lift of a such that the attracting endpoint of j for every j 1 m is a vertex in i e it is a vertex of the chamber at infinity that corresponds to the borel subgroup b it is then easy to see that for every simplex there exists a hyperbolic element in stabg with attracting endpoint in the interior of so p i u i mi are well defined for any simplex remark 4 9 let g be a semi simple algebraic group over a non archimedean local field k and let g g k be the group of all k rational points of g by the bruhat tits theory and cio 15 cor 4 29 the groups u a are closed example 4 10 for the totally disconnected locally compact group g sl n qp the levi decom positions from proposition 4 6 are as follows consider the subgroups of sl n qp b m u 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 n 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 n 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 the subgroup b is the borel subgroup corresponding to the model ideal chamber c ch then b gc p u m note the subgroup u is closed in sl n qp and it is the unipotent radical of b as defined in remark 4 7 it is a fact that u contains only elliptic elements also m c is contained in stabg so m stabilizes the apartment it contains both elliptic and hyperbolic elements the subgroup m 0 sl n zp contains all the elliptic elements of m more generally we associate the following subgroups of sl n qp with a coxeter subsystem wi i of w s p i mi u i a 1 0 a 2 0 0 0 0 ak a 1 0 0 0 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ak id 1 0 id 2 0 0 0 0 idk where the blocks a 1 ak are indecomposable square matrices of possibly different dimensions for b the blocks are one dimensional and k n a block ai is indecomposable if no conjugate of p i in sln qp allows us to write ai as a direct sum of smaller blocks the dimensions of the blocks a 1 ak are determined by wi i we abuse notation and denote by id 1 idk identity matrices of the same size as a 1 ak then b p i u imi the subgroup u i is the unipotent radical of p i as defined in remark 4 7 it is a closed subgroup of sl n qp and u i u the levi factor mi is a reductive group bor 91 definition 11 22 and it is unique up to conjugacy its elliptic and hyperbolic part and the flat that mi stabilizes are a special case of the general case that will be presented below 7 remark 4 11 recall psl n qp acts faithfully on the bruhat tits building associated with sl n qp and the kernel of the isogeny sl n qp psl n qp is precisely n the group of n th roots of unity in q p as n id is a normal subgroup of sl n qp and acts trivially on the building psl n qp and sl n qp give the same action on further decomposition of mi first we fix the following notation let be a locally finite thick affine building of dimension n with its complete system of apartments let be an apartment of and be two opposite simplices in and let wi i be the corresponding coxeter subsystem of the residue res is the set of all ideal chambers in ch that contain the simplex let be the union of all the apartments of whose ideal boundaries contain proposition 4 12 the union of apartments is a closed convex subset of it is an extended locally finite thick affine building and r i i with i a locally finite thick affine building of dimension n i moreover res is a compact subset of ch it is a spherical building and res ch i proof this is proved by rousseau rou 11 4 3 in a more general setting see also cmr section 2 6 by ab 08 5 30 we know res is a spherical building when and in proposition 4 12 are two opposite chambers in then r n and i is just a point note the euclidean factor r i from the splitting of is in fact the affine space li in guivarc h re my gr 06 1 2 1 the simplices are in the boundary at infinity of r i proposition 4 13 let g be a closed type preserving subgroup of aut with a strongly transitive action on then g g g mi acts strongly transitively on i proof since g acts strongly transitively on then g acts strongly transitively on by propo sition 4 12 every apartment of i is the boundary at infinity of some apartment not necessarily unique in let c 1 c 2 res and let a 1 a 2 be two apartments of with ci ch ai for i 1 2 then by the strong transitivity of g there exists g g with g a 1 a 2 and g c 1 c 2 in particular g ch a 1 ch a 2 since c 1 and c 2 share the same simplex and g is type preserving then g so g because a 1 a 2 are apartments of thus g mi proposition 4 14 let g be a closed type preserving subgroup of aut with a strongly transi tive action on then mi acts on and preserves the splitting r i i moreover the induced map mi isom isom r i isom i is a group homo morphism and the normal subgroups hi 1 isom i mi resp h i 1 isom r i mi of mi act by automorphisms and strongly transitively on i resp by translations on r i proof as every g mi stabilizes and and is type preserving then g preserves the splitting r i i and acts by translations or as a trivial element on r i and by automorphisms on i by the splitting results of fl 08 theorem 1 1 corollary 1 3 we have isom isom r i isom i as the action of mi on is a group action the corresponding map mi isom r i isom i is a group homomorphism since isom r i isom i are normal subgroups in isom so are the subgroups hi h i in mi by construction hi is a subgroup of translations of r i it remains to prove hi acts strongly transitively on i indeed first note h i does not affect the action on i and res ch i so asmi acts strongly transitively on res we obtain hi acts strongly transitively on i by ks 17 theorem b hi acts strongly transitively on i and the conclusion follows 8 remark 4 15 in general the map mi isom r i isom i from proposition 4 14 is not injective as the subgroup ker mi that acts trivially on r i i can be non trivial in addition the image subgroup mi might not split as a direct product in isom r i isom i both issues occur in the special case mi g sl n qp we have seen in example 4 10 that the levi factor mi of a parabolic subgroup p i of sl n qp is a reductive group mi a 1 0 0 0 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ak det a 1 det a 2 det ak 1 where the blocks a 1 ak are indecomposable square matrices of possibly different dimen sions the next lemma computes the normal subgroups ker and hi for the map mi isom isom r i isom i from proposition 4 14 lemma 4 16 we have ker 1 id 1 0 0 0 2 id 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 k idk sl n qp 1 2 k zp hi 1 id 1 0 0 0 2 id 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 k idk sl n qp 1 2 k qp where id 1 id 2 idk are square identity matrices of possibly different dimensions but respectively with the same size as a 1 a 2 ak from mi above proof notice every element in ker fixes pointwise and so ker fixes pointwise the apartment corresponding to the cartan subgroup c sl n qp thus ker sl n zp b stabg diag n zp the diagonal matrices in sl n zp recall stabg is the monomial subgroup of sl n qp see ab 08 section 6 9 page 351 but ker is normal in mi and a subgroup in diag n zp thus it is easy to see ker has the desired form now let us compute hi indeed we first claim hi is a subgroup of diag n qp this is true because every element of hi acts trivially on i and translates or acts trivially on the flat r i recall r i is a subflat of and so every element ofhi stabilises the apartment and fixes pointwise the boundary of thus hi is a subgroup of stabg b diag n qp and our claim follows as hi is also a normal subgroup of mi we obtain the desired conclusion remark 4 17 notice the intersection hi h i is ker consisting of diagonal matrices with entries in zp and those elements are not hyperbolic therefore hyperbolic elements of hi are not hyperbolic elements in hi as hi acts strongly transitively on i we can apply all the decompositions presented above let y i then fixmi r i y g mi g z z z r i y hi y following the definition in guivarc h re my gr 06 1 2 3 we have definition 4 18 for y i we denote ki y fixmi r i y hi y di y u iki y and ri y u ihiki y 9 5 chabauty limits of parahoric subgroups this section gives a different geometric proof of gr 06 theorem 3 corollary 4 and hae 10 the orem 3 14 for sl n qp by using lemma 3 4 and the decomposition ofmi given in proposition 4 14 the proof of gr 06 theorem 3 uses a probabilistic method which holds for general semi simple algebraic groups g over non archimedean local fields for completeness we also give more geometric proofs of two main lemmas in gr 06 hae 10 about general semi simple algebraic groups g over non archimedean local fields let g be a semi simple algebraic group over a non archimedean local field k and let g g k be the group of all k rational points of g in particular we will consider g sl n qp denote by the corresponding locally finite thick affine building of dimension n 1 on which g acts by type preserving automorphisms and strongly transitively let be the apartment of and fix a special vertex x in the base point for a point y we denote ky stabg y gy note ky is a closed subgroup of g given a sequence xl l n of points we want to study the chabauty limits in s g of the sequence of closed subgroups kxl l n by guivarc h re my gr 06 lemma 1 1 3 3 for every sequence xl l n there exist i s a converging sequence glk k n kx and a simplex i such that for every k n we have xlk glk ylk ylk is in the weyl chamber with base point x of and the projection of ylk to i is in comprising the boundary of the sequence ylk k n is called i canonical the following two lemmas hold true for any i canonical sequence yl l n with its associ ated simplex in i and y a point in the interior of lemma 5 1 see gr 06 lemma 7 suppose the sequence kyl l n converges to d s g with respect to the chabauty topology on s g then di y d proof we use the levi decomposition since di y u iki y we prove the lemma in two steps the unipotent radical u i is a subset of d and ki y d to prove the inclusion u i d it is enough by cio 15 cor 4 29 to prove every root group uh of u i is in d fix a root group uh as in cio 15 cor 4 29 and some u uh by cio 15 cor 4 24 u fixes pointwise a half apartment of that contains in its interior the weyl chamber but a finite volume part then there exists nu 0 such that for every l nu we have u yl yl thus u kyl and so u d now we showd containski y indeed as y is in the interior of and by the definition of ki y we have ki y ki and for l big enough ki y fixes pointwise yl so ki y kyl lemma 5 2 see hae 10 lemma 3 12 suppose the sequence kyl l n converges to d s g with respect to the chabauty topology on s g then d p i proof the proof goes as for hae 10 lemma 3 12 by hypothesis we know the sequence yl l n is contained in the closed strip r i intersected with the weyl chamber in with base point x therefore yl l n admits a converging subsequence to a point whose stabilizer is p i let d d and take kl kyl l n that converges to d then we have restricting eventually to a subsequence kl yl yl l n converges to d and also to thus d and so d p i theorem 5 3 see gr 06 theorem 3 corollary 4 and hae 10 theorem 3 14 let g sl n qp with its associated bruhat tits building and x be a fixed special vertex of let xl l n then the sequence kxl i n admits a convergent subsequence with respect to the chabauty topology on s g and the corresponding limit is kx conjugate to some di y for some i s and y i proof by guivarc h re my gr 06 lemma 1 1 3 3 it is enough to consider an i canonical sequence yl l n such that kyl l n converges to d s g let be the associated simplex in i of yl l n and let y be inside by the above lemmas we have di y d p i let d d by 10 lemma 5 1 u i d and we can assume that d mi by proposition 4 14 d cannot project to a non trivial translation in hi as this contradicts the fact that d is a limit of elliptic elements see lemma 3 4 therefore we have d hi as every vertex in the affine building of of sl n qp is special every vertex of the affine building i of hi is also special so for every vertex z i the maximal compact subgroup hi z is good and hi admits the iwasawa decomposition hi hi zaib 0 i where ai is the maximal split torus of hi with respect to the apartment i and b 0 i is the pointwise stabilizer in hi of a ideal chamber in i corresponding to the weyl chamber in suppose that is a vertex so y as in this case hi ki y and ki y is contained in d by lemma 5 1 we can assume up to multiplying by the inverse of an element in ki y that d aib 0 i again by lemma 3 4 d b 0 i as otherwise d would translate along some axis in the building i and thus in contradicting the fact that d is a limit of elliptic elements so d fixes pointwise an ideal chamber in i and so the ideal chamber in corresponding to the weyl chamber of this implies d fixes pointwise an entire weyl subsector contained in since d mi then d preserves the splitting r i i since it is elliptic d fixes pointwise a flat in of dimension i that is parallel to the flat r i corresponding to mi in particular by bh 99 chapter ii prop 6 9 min d r i y for some y i as min d is closed convex and contains a flat of dimension i and a weyl subsector d must fix all points yl for l big enough by projecting to i we have d ki y hi we have obtained d di if is a vertex suppose now is not a vertex as in guivarc h re my gr 06 proof of lemma 8 di y di z vertex of di z and d di z for every z vertex of and the conclusion follows recall from remark 4 3 the iwasawa decomposition does not hold for a general non special vertex and so the proof of theorem 5 3 cannot be generalised to semi simple algebraic group over a non archimedean local field 6 chabauty limits of diagonal cartan subgroups and classification in this section we study chabauty limits of a different family of closed subgroups the set of all sl n qp conjugate of the cartan subgroup c of g sl n qp as defined in section 4 the diagonal subgroup of g is called the diagonal cartan subgroup c it is a closed subgroup of g and c stabg for a unique apartment in the bruhat tits building x associated with g sl n qp set cart g gcg 1 g g s g the set of all conjugates in g of c let cart g ch be the closure of cart g in s g with respect to the chabauty topology on s g so cart g ch is compact an element in cart g ch is called a chabauty limit of the diagonal cartan for simplicity we will use limit of the cartan as terminology lemma 6 1 the diagonal cartan subgroup c stabg fixes pointwise the boundary at infinity of the apartment of x proof since c is abelian and acts cocompactly on the restriction of every element of c to is either hyperbolic or pointwise fixes in particular we have min for every c in both cases is hyperbolic or elliptic the boundary is pointwise fixed by every c and the conclusion follows proposition 6 2 any limit of the diagonal cartan is contained in the product of the group n of n roots of 1 in qp with a conjugate of the borel subgroup b and fixes pointwise the closure of an ideal chamber of ch x that is not necessarily unique here n is identified with the corresponding group of scalar matrices 11 proof note that n appears as the kernel of the quotient map sln qp psln qp indeed it is only psln qp that acts faithfully on the corresponding bruhat tits building x let gm m n g and suppose the limit lim m gmcg 1 m exists in s g and equals h let be the apartment of x such that c stabg in particular every ideal chamber c ch is fixed by c take one such ideal chamber c ch recall x x is a hausdorff compact space with respect to the cone topology on x x since the action of g on x x is continuous the sequence gm c m n admits a convergent subsequence gmi c c ch x when mi for simplicity we denote that subsequence also by gm m n let h h there exists a sequence hm gmcg 1 m m n such that hm h when m with respect to the induced subgroup topology on h from g the action of g on x x is continuous thus so is the action of h so we have hmgm c h c when m but hmgm c gm c c thus h c c for every h h therefore h is a subgroup of stabg c that is contained in a conjugate of n b as g acts by type preserving automorphisms the ideal chamber c and its closure are pointwise fixed by h note for every ideal chamber c ch there is an ideal chamber c ch x such that h stabg c but maybe for c 1 6 c 2 ch the corresponding c 1 c 2 are different this means there could be more ideal chambers stabilized by h examples of limits of the diagonal cartan that fix pointwise more ideal chambers of ch x are all conjugates of c any conjugate of c pointwise fixes the ideal boundary of an apartment of x next we show every limit of c is conjugate to a limit of c under conjugating by a sequence in the unipotent radical u of b lemma 6 3 let h be a limit of the diagonal cartan then there exists a sequence um m n u where u is the unipotent radical of the borel subgroup b and some k k such that umcu 1 m m n converges to a limit h of the diagonal cartan and kh k 1 h proof ash is a limit of the diagonal cartan there exists gm m n sl n qp such that gmcg 1 m m n converges to h in the chabauty topology as sl n qp kb kuc where c is the diagonal cartan subgroup of all diagonal matrices we have gm kmumam with km k um u and am c because k is compact the sequence km m n admits a convergent subsequence to some k k abusing notation we write km m k then umamca 1 m u 1 m umcu 1 m m n admits a convergent subsequence in s sl n qp abus ing notation again we write umcu 1 m m h so h is a limit of the diagonal cartan we claim kh k 1 h indeed it is easy to see kh k 1 h take now h h then there exists hm c m n such that kmumhmu 1 m k 1 m m h but k 1 m hkm m k 1 hk so umhmu 1 m k 1 m kmumhmu 1 m k 1 m km m k 1 hk thus k 1 hk h and the conclusion follows remark 6 4 to classify limits of c up to conjugacy it suffices by proposition 6 2 to find all limits of c that are subgroups of the borel b note a limit h of the diagonal cartan either contains only elliptic elements and in which case we call h an elliptic limit of the cartan otherwise h contains at least one hyperbolic element and we call h a hyperbolic limit of the cartan 6 1 a homeomorphism between cart sl n qp ch and cart sl n qp ch by bourbaki bou 89 thm 2 pg 340 we know that every closed subgroup of a real or p adic lie group is again a real or p adic lie group for the definition of a real or p adic lie group see bourbaki bou 89 in particular every closed subgroup of sl n qp is a p adic lie group again by bourbaki bou 89 def 6 pg 252 every real or p adic lie group h has an associated real or p adic lie algebra h this gives a lie functor l from the set of real or p adic lie groups to the set of real or p adic lie algebras in particular one can consider the restriction of the lie functor l to the set of all closed subgroups of a lie group h to the set of all closed lie subalgebras 12 of h in the p adic case the lie functor l is not injective see bourbaki bou 89 thm 3 pg 283 l h 1 l h 2 implies h 1 h 2 is open in h 1 and h 2 so the lie algebra does not uniquely determine the lie group for the p adic case it would be interesting to see when the lie functor real or p adic case l s h s h is continuous with respect to the chabauty topology on s h and the chabauty topology on s h or on which compact subsets of s h the lie functor l is continuous as in the case of real lie groups every p adic lie group h has an associated exponential map exp h h see bourbaki thm 4 pg 284 def 1 pg 285 bou 89 or hooke hoo 42 serre ser 06 schneider sch 11 still the exp map for p adic lie algebras h see bou 89 examples 2 pg 285 is well defined only in a neighbourhood v of zero of h and maps v diffeomorphically onto a neighbourhood of identity element in h for r the exponential map is well defined on all of the lie algebra in the case of sl n qp and explicitly for the set cart sl n qp ch we propose a map that looks like an inverse map of the lie functor l gr cart sl n qp ch cart sl n qp ch a 7 gr a sl n qp a id here cart sl n qp is the set of all sl n qp conjugates of the lie subalgebra c sl n qp of c for a sl n qp we denote a id a id qp and a a to be the qp linear span of a and id we show that a cart sl n qp ch is the lie algebra of gr a and moreover the map gr is continuous with respect to the chabauty topology 6 1 1 on closed subalgebras of m n qp and sl n qp in this subsection we build background on closed subgroups and subalgebras before defining the map gr in the next section all the topologies that we consider here for example onm n qp gl n qp sl n qp sl n qp etc are the subspace topologies inherited from the product topology on qn 2 p the set m n qp of all n n matrices over qp is an algebra it is a qp vector space of finite dimension and the multiplication of matrices gives the structure of an algebra set g sl n qp gl n qp and g is a closed subgroup of gl n qp by milne mil example 3 9 page 122 the lie algebra of g is g sl n qp the set of all matrices in m n qp of trace zero note g is a finite dimensional qp vector subspace of m n qp that is not a subalgebra of m n qp with respect to the usual multiplication of matrices the multiplication on g is given by the lie bracket a b ab ba for every a b g note a b is of trace zero for every a b g thus a b g and the identity matrix id is not in g abelian subalgebra or just subalgebras of g are considered with respect to the lie bracket the diagonal subgroup diag n qp gl n qp is a maximal abelian subgroup in gl n qp and it is easy to see diag n qp is a closed subgroup of gl n qp we denote by diag n qp the set of all diagonal matrices of m n qp it is a maximal abelian subalgebra of m n qp we denote by c the diagonal cartan subalgebra of the diagonal cartan subgroup c we have c diag n qp g and c is an abelian subalgebra of g with respect to the lie bracket as for every a b c we have a b 0 so c consists of all diagonal matrices of m n qp with trace zero we have cart g g diag n qp g g 1 g g g diag n qp g 1 g g g definition 6 5 let h g be a subgroup denote by h the qp linear span of elements of h lemma 6 6 c diag n qp proof for a q p let da be the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries a a 1 1 1 so da d 1 has diagonal entries a 1 a 1 1 0 0 choose distinct a b q p with a 6 1 6 b and observe that the matrices da d 1 db d 1 are linearly independent so the linear span of da db d 1 13 contains the diagonal matrices with diagonal entries 1 0 0 0 and 0 1 0 0 moving a and a 1 down the diagonal we construct all other elements of the canonical basis of diag n qp hence the result note that this proof holds over any field of order at least 4 observe g acts on cart g and cart g by conjugation lemma 6 7 stabg c gcg 1 c g g equals stabg c gcg 1 c g g proof if g g stabilizes c then it stabilizes c diag n qp by lemma 6 6 so it stabilizes the set of trace 0 matrices in diag n qp which is c conversely if g g stabilizes c then it stabilizes c id diag n qp hence it stabilizes diag n qp g c the next remark is very useful for what follows remark 6 8 by bourbaki bou 81 section i 14 cor 1 in a banach space over qp every finite dimensional linear subspace is closed similarly to the real case by remark 6 8 diag n qp is a closed subset of m n qp and thus a closed subalgebra of m n qp similarly g is a closed subset of m n qp definition 6 9 let v be a vector space over qp of finite dimension n endow v with the product topology from qnp we denote by s v the set of all qp linear subspace of v thus closed in particular one can consider v g we have c is a closed and abelian subalgebra of g so c s g for every g g we obtain gcg 1 is also a closed abelian subalgebra of g thus cart g s g note a b g then ab is not necessarily in g and a b 0 if and only if ab ba lemma 6 10 the set s g is compact with respect to the chabauty topology from g proof first g is a locally compact topological group with matrix addition with the topology induced from the locally compact topological group m n qp by paulin cdp 07 proposition 1 7 p 58 the space f g of all closed subsets of g is compact with respect to the chabauty topology on f g by cdp 07 proposition 17 2 s g is a closed subset of f g and thus compact with respect to the chabauty topology abelian groups and algebras satisfy the universal relation that the commutator is trivial so limits of abelian groups and algebras are abelian as a consequence of proposition 2 2 we obtain lemma 6 11 1 cart g ch contains only abelian subalgebras of g 2 cart g ch contains only abelian subgroups 6 1 2 defining the bijection gr cart g ch cart g ch remark 6 12 by lemma 6 7 we may define the bijective map gr cart g cart g gcg 1 7 gcg 1 our goal is to establish a bijection between the closures cart g ch and cart g ch definition 6 13 let a m n qp be a subalgebra of m n qp denote by a the group of all invertible elements of a i e a a if and only if a a gl n qp with a 1 a lemma 6 14 let k be a field in particular one can take k qp let a m n k be a subalgebra of m n k then a a gl n k proof the inclusion a a gl n k is clear for the converse let a a gl n k let p t tn kn 1 t n 1 k 1 t k 0 be the characteristic polynomial of a where kn 1 k 1 k 0 k with k 0 det a 6 0 by cayley hamilton we have 0 p a a n kn 1 a n 1 k 1 a k 0 and so a 1 1 k 0 an 1 kn 1 a n 2 k 1 id belongs to a 14 lemma 6 15 let a s g such that a id is a subalgebra of m n qp then a id a id gl n qp is a closed subgroup of gl n qp proof as by lemma 6 14 a id a id gl n qp the conclusion follows remark 6 16 notice c id g c id g c lemma 6 17 let v be a finite dimensional vector space over qp let w be a hyperplane in v and let v be a vector in v w then the map ev s w s v given by a 7 a v is continuous with respect to the chabauty topology in particular ev is injective proof we write w ker where is some linear form on v such that v 1 let an n n be a sequence of linear subspaces of w converging in the chabauty topology to a linear subspace a of w for x a v ev a write a limn an with an an for every n n then for every n n we have an v ev an and limn an v x conversely if xn ev an n n converges to x a v v then by writing xn an nv and applying we obtain limn n then limn an limn xn nv x v a thus a a and x ev a we have shown the chabauty limit of ev an n n is ev a as a w ev a for every a s w the injectivity follows for ev remark 6 18 as a consequence of lemma 6 17 we obtain if am m n cart g ch with am m a cart g ch then am id m a id with respect to the chabauty topology induced from m n qp lemma 6 19 let a cart g then a id is an abelian subalgebra of m n qp if am m n cart g with am m a cart g ch then a id is an abelian subalgebra of m n qp proof let a cart g then there exists g g such that a gcg 1 and by lemma 6 6 a id g diag n qp g 1 so a id is a subalgebra ofm n qp with respect to the multiplication of matrices as diag n qp is an abelian subalgebra this implies a id is abelian too let am m n cart g with am m a cart g ch let a b a id by remark 6 18 there exist am am id m n and bm am id m n with am m a and bm m b by the first part of the lemma we know that ambm am id so ambm cm m id where cm am trace cm 0 and trace ambm n m moreover we have ambm m ab and thus trace ambm n m m trace ab n we write ab c id with c g then cm m c and as am m a we obtain c a it follows ab a id because ambm bmam we have ab ba and the conclusion of the lemma follows note in the proof of lemma 6 19 it was important that a cart g is a conjugate of the set of all diagonal matrices with trace zero let s 1 m n qp be the set of unital subalgebras of m n qp proposition 6 20 the map g r s 1 m n qp s g given by b 7 g r b b g b g is chabauty continuous in order to prove this we need the following lemma which allows us to construct a continuous branching of the m th root on a neighborhood of 1 in q p lemma 6 21 pointed out by y de cornulier fix m 1 then there exists an open neighbourhood u of 1 in q p and a continuous function g u q p such that g x m x for every x u proof by robert rob 00 chapter 5 section 4 1 the function mapping x 7 exp log 1 x m is defined on a small neighbourhood v around 0 in qp denote this function by f moreover by 15 rob 00 chapter 5 section 4 2 prop 3 we have f x m exp log 1 x 1 x thus the function g x f x 1 defined on u 1 v does the job proof of proposition 6 20 let bk k n be a sequence in s 1 m n qp converging tob s 1 m n qp we need to show the sequence bk g k n converges tob g indeed if a sequence bk bk g k n converges to b m n qp then clearly b b g as g is closed conversely if b b g then we may write b limk bk with bk bk so limk det bk 1 and det bk is in a neighbourhood u qp of 1 qp for k 0 large enough by lemma 6 21 for m n define k g det bk so that limk k 1 and b k 1 k bk then b k bk g and limk b k b proposition 6 22 let a cart g ch then gr a a id g is a closed subgroup of cart g ch and if x a belongs to the domain of the exponential map exp then exp x gr a the map gr cart g ch cart g ch is well defined and continuous with respect to the chabauty topology on cart g ch and cart g ch proof by lemma 6 19 a id is a closed abelian subalgebra of m n qp thus by lemma 6 15 gr a a id g a id g is a closed abelian subgroup of gl n qp if x a then exp x g as x is of trace 0 and on the other hand exp x a id as the latter is a closed sub algebra of m n qp so exp x gr a now consider the map eid s g m n qp given by a 7 eid a a id by lemma 6 17 it is chabauty continuous as well is the canonical inclusion cart g ch s g it is then easy to see the image of eid is contained in s 1 m n qp as a id is a unital subalgebra so we may compose with g r and obtain gr g r eid that is well defined and chabauty continuous since gr maps cart g to cart g just by continuity it maps cart g ch to cart g ch notice gr c c our goal is to prove the map gr cart g ch cart g ch is a bijection proposition 6 23 the map gr cart g ch cart g ch is surjective proof take h cart g ch then there is a sequence hm cart g with hm m h each hm gmcg 1 m for gm g set am gmcg 1 m cart g m n a sequence then gr am hm since cart g ch is compact am admits a convergent subsequence amk m a cart g ch as hmk gr amk m gr a by proposition 6 22 the conclusion follows proposition 6 24 let b s 1 m n qp then we have b q p b g in particular the maps g r s 1 m n qp s g and gr cart g ch cart g ch are injective proof because gr g r eid and eid are injective it is enough to prove g r is injective this follows from the first part of the proposition that we now prove in four steps 1 recall by lemma 6 14 we have b b gl n qp 2 we claim b is open in b indeed it is enough to show that id has an open neighbourhood in b such that any of its elements is also contained in b it is a general fact for banach unital algebras that if a id 1 and by setting b id a then a 1 id b 1 k 0 b k is a norm convergent series the claim follows let d be the dimension of the qp linear subspace b then b is a d dimensional p adic analytic group hence b g b g ker det b is a d 1 dimensional p adic analytic subgroup see serre ser 06 part ii chapter 4 section 5 corollary lg 4 12 3 we claim q p b g is open in b indeed consider the analytic group homomorphism b g q p b given by g 7 g g its differential at the identity id is d id b g qp b x 7 x id 16 notice d id has rank d so by the inverse function theorem serre ser 06 part ii chapter 2 lg 2 10 is a local analytic isomorphism hence its image contains an open set 4 finally in a finite dimensional vector space the linear span of an open set is the whole space hence b q p b g we have obtained a continuous bijective map from the compact set cart g ch to the compact set cart g ch which concludes the proof of theorem 1 2 as the chabauty topology on cart g ch is hausdorff and cart g ch is compact we directly conclude the map gr is a homeomorphism corollary 6 25 the map gr cart g ch cart g ch is a homeomorphism remark 6 26 let n be the group of n th roots of unity in q p let h cart g ch and let n if g h then we claim g h indeed by corollary 6 25 take ah cart g ch such that g ah id gr ah h take g h and let the unique a ah such that a trace g n id g then g a trace g n id a trace g n id ah id but det g 1 so the conclusion follows 6 1 3 remarks on the dimension of a limit of the diagonal cartan so far we have shown that for every h cart g ch there exists a unique ah cart g ch such that gr ah h we end this subsection by showing that the dimension of every ah cart g ch is n 1 we thank thomas haettel for the idea of the proof of the following proposition let v be a qp vector space of dimension n denote by s v m the set of all qp linear subspaces of v of dimension m n then s v m s v in particular one can consider v g and m n 1 proposition 6 27 we have s v m is closed in s v and s v m equals the grassmannians grass m v as a set moreover s v m with the chabauty topology is homeomorphic to the grassmannians grass m v endowed with a quotient topology induced from the topological group gl v qp proof recall s v is the set of all qp linear subspaces of v and by lemma 6 10 s v is compact let gl v qp be the set of invertible linear maps on v considered as a qp linear vector space note gl v qp acts by left multiplication and continuously on s v with respect to the chabauty topology indeed suppose dk k n gl v qp converges to some d gl v qp and fk k n s v converges to f s v as gl v qp acts continuously on v we have dkfk k n converges to df for every sequence fk fk k n that converges to f f it remains to prove if dkfk k n admits a strictly increasing subsequence kl l n with dklfkl l n converging to some g v then d 1 g f as d 1 dkl converges to id gl v qp for l large enough fkl is as close as we want to d 1 dklfkl and thus to d 1 g we obtain fkl l n converges to d 1 g and so d 1 g is in f therefore dkfk k n converges to df in the chabauty topology on s v since we can apply a linear transformation in gl v qp to change between bases of any two qp linear subspaces of the same dimension there are a finite number of qp linear subspaces of v up to gl v qp action thus the gl v qp action on s v is cocompact recall gl v qp admits the iwasawa decomposition kan kb see lemma 4 2 where k gl v zp a is the set of diagonal matrices in gl v qp b is the subgroup of all upper triagular matrices of gl v qp and n the set of all upper triangular matrices with 1 on the diagonal as in lit section 1 1 3 we fix the standard basis e 1 en of v then the qp linear subspace fd span e 1 ed of dimension d in v is invariant under the group that contains b 17 gl v fd 0 n d n d as fd is in s v d we obtain gl v zp acts transitively on s v d which implies gl v qp and gl v zp have the same orbits on s v since gl v zp is compact every gl v qp orbit in s v is closed now as fm s v m s v and fm grass m v the orbit gl v qp fm is in bijection with grass m v as a set because elements of gl v qp do not change the dimension of a qp linear subspace we obtain s v m is closed in s v and in bijection with grass m v denote the stabilizer of fm in gl v qp by gl v fm then the map from gl v qp gl v fm grass m v to s v m given by g 7 gfm is bijective and continuous with respect to the quotient topology induced from the topological group gl v qp and the chabauty topology on s v m that is also hausdorff we conclude s v m with the chabauty topology is homeomorphic to gl v qp gl v fm grass m v with the quotient topology induced from the topological group gl v qp corollary 6 28 every element of cart g ch is an abelian subalgebra with respect to the lie bracket of g and of dimension n 1 6 2 elliptic cartan limits lemma 6 29 take h cart g ch and the corresponding ah cart g ch if h is contained in the upper triangular borel subgroup b g then every matrix in ah is upper triangular proof we prove the contrapositive assume that ah contains some non upper triangular matrix a consider the sequence pka id k 0 in ah id as k the sequence p ka id k 0 converges to id hence det pka id converges to 1 fix k large enough so that det pka id belongs to the neighborhood u of 1 appearing in lemma 6 21 then the matrix 1 g det pka id pka id is in g ah id h and it is clearly not upper triangular remark 6 30 see platonov rapinchuk pr 94 page 151 for sl n qp the good maximal compact subgroup is sl n zp and so elements of sl n zp are elliptic the diagonal matrices in sl n qp of the form diag p a 1 pan with the condition that a 1 an z n and n i 1 ai 0 are hyperbolic the iwasawa and levi decompositions associated with sl n qp implies an upper triangular matrix of sl n qp is hyperbolic if and only if at least one entry of its diagonal has p adic absolute value 1 lemma 6 31 let 1 n qp suppose for some fixed i 6 j 1 n we have i 6 j then there exists a non empty open subset u in qp such that i n p j n p and i n p n t 1 t p 0 for every u proof we prove the set u is non empty this is done by considering two cases case 1 suppose that j 0 first notice that for every k that is not zero and for m 0 large enough we have k p m p k p moreover for m 0 large enough we also have t t 6 0 t p m p t t 6 0 t p thus set pm qp for some m 0 large enough so that p m i n p i n p and i n p n t 1 t p 0 then j p p m and so j n p i n p case 2 we now treat the general case when j 6 0 then we may apply the first case to the sequence 1 j 2 j n j the result follows finally we observe the set u of s in qp satisfying all the inequalities in the statement of the lemma is clearly open as a consequence of lemma 6 31 we have 18 theorem 6 32 elliptic unipotent given h cart g ch take ah cart g ch so that gr ah h if h is contained in the borel subgroup b and h does not contain hyperbolic elements then every matrix in ah has only zero on the diagonal moreover h is contained in u n where u is the unipotent radical of b see example 4 10 and n is the group of n th roots of unity in q p proof by lemma 6 29 every matrix in ah is upper triangular fix a ah with diagonal values a 1 an suppose for contradiction that not all ai s are 0 by lemma 6 31 there exist i 1 n and qp such that ai n p n j 1 aj p 0 then det a id 6 0 hence a id n det a id belongs to g and is a hyperbolic matrix since the i th diagonal coefficient has the p adic norm 1 this contradicts the assumption on h so all diagonal coefficients of a are 0 to prove the last statement of the theorem write h gr ah with ah strictly upper triangular by the first statement then a id consists of strictly upper triangular plus scalar matrices so intersecting with g one obtains a subgroup in u n this proves the theorem 6 3 hyperbolic cartan limits in this section we prove that hyperbolic cartan limits are up to conjugacy subgroups of b g g for some subsimplex of the ideal chamber c and is opposite and contained in lemma 6 33 let h be a subgroup of b and let h 0 h h h is elliptic then h 0 is a normal subgroup of h if h is closed then h 0 is closed too proof this follows from lemma 3 1 from cc 15 lemma 6 34 let h b be elliptic and let g b be hyperbolic then gh is hyperbolic proof suppose gh is elliptic then gh fixes a point in the affine building x thus gh fixes pointwise an entire sector q with ideal boundary the ideal chamber c that defines the borel subgroup b and that is contained in the apartment as h is also elliptic it fixes a sector q in with ideal boundary the ideal chamber c then h and gh fix pointwise q q so g must fix pointwise q q this is a contradiction as g is hyperbolic it follows that gh is hyperbolic recall by lemma 4 2 b b 0 a where a zn 1 is the set of all diagonal matrices in g that are hyperbolic elements but the id see remark 6 30 and b 0 is normal in b then by lemma 6 34 for every h b the quotient h h 0 contains only hyperbolic representatives lemma 6 35 let h b be a hyperbolic cartan limit then h h 0 is a free abelian subgroup of rank m with 0 m n 1 and maps to a via a canonical injective homomorphism proof since h is a limit of the diagonal cartan it is abelian and so is h h 0 as h b every h h has a decomposition as h ahh 1 for a unique ah a and some h 1 b 0 the element ah is unique because a id contains only hyperbolic elements more precisely h ahh 1 bhh 2 implies b 1 h ah b 0 a so it is elliptic and must be the identity then the map h h 0 a given by h 7 ah is well defined and injective because h is abelian and h 0 b 0 are normal subgroups in h respectively b the map is also a homomorphism we obtain h h 0 is a free abelian subgroup of rank 0 m n 1 the convex hull in x of a flat e x is the intersection of all half apartments and apartments in x that contain e denote the convex hull of e in x by convx e and notice it is unique the convex hull is again a flat in x and in general might be of bigger dimension that the dimension of e 19 theorem 6 36 let h be a hyperbolic cartan limit with rank h h 0 m then there exist 0 k n 1 maximal which depends on m and opposite simplices with c such that up to conjugacy in g h is a subgroup of b g g and stabilizes a flat of dimension k in x whose ideal boundary is the support of proof by proposition 6 2 we may take h to be a hyperbolic cartan limit contained in b by lemma 6 35 choose m hyperbolic representatives in h that generate h h 0 then those represen tatives generate a free abelian subgroup h of h of rank m n 1 and h h h 0 apply the flat torus theorem bh 99 chapter ii thm 7 1 and obtain min h h h min h y em where em is a flat in x of dimension m and every element h h stabilizes min h the splitting y em and acts as a translation on em in particular h stabilizes em by bh 99 chapter ii thm 6 8 5 every element of h stabilizes min h preserves the splitting y em and acts as a translation on em in particular every element in h 0 is elliptic and acts as the identity on em we obtain h stabilizes convx e m more precisely every hyperbolic element of h acts as a translation on convx e m and every elliptic element fixes pointwise convx e m then we take k to be the dimension of convx e m and notice k is maximal in particular h fixes pointwise the boundary convx e m then there exist two opposite ideal simplices not necessarily unique convx e m x such that the support of is convx e m fix such since h fixes pointwise the ideal chamber c corresponding to the borel subgroup b and also the ideal simplex and since the convex hull is unique then h fixes pointwise the convex hull conv x c in x of c and see ab 08 example 3 133 c let c be the unique ideal chamber of conv x c that contains the simplex see ab 08 def 3 104 and exe 3 149 then by the strong transitivity ofg on ch x there exists g g with g c c and g thus there exist g g opposite simplices and c such that up to conjugacy h is a subgroup of b g g theorems 6 36 and 6 32 imply theorem 1 1 in order to give explicit examples of limits of the diagonal cartan in low dimensions we need to understand further the diagonal entries of matrix elements of hyperbolic cartan limits this is a generalization of theorem 6 32 theorem 6 37 up to conjugacy every hyperbolic cartan limit h is a subgroup of b g g a 1 0 0 0 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 ak sl n qp for some opposite simplices with c and where the blocks a 1 ak are inde composable upper triangular square matrices of possibly different dimensions and in each block ai every element in h has its diagonal entries all the same in particular if the dimension of convx e m corresponding to h is n 1 then h is conjugate to the diagonal cartan subgroup proof recall a block ai is indecomposable if no conjugate of p i in sl n qp allows us to write ai as a direct sum of smaller blocks the first part of the proposition is just theorem 6 36 proposition 4 6 and example 4 10 as h b and by lemma 6 29 every matrix in ah is upper triangular and so is every matrix in h let us prove in each block ai every matrix element in h has its diagonal entries all the same we treat hyperbolic and elliptic elements of h separately let f be the flat in x of maximal dimension k that is stabilized by h and given by theorem 6 36 recall from the proof of theorem 20 6 36 every hyperbolic element h of h acts as a translation on f and every elliptic element in h fixes pointwise f then by lemma 4 16 and remark 4 17 for every hyperbolic element h h the preimage 1 isom f h consists of diagonal matrices with entries in each block ai all the same moreover every elliptic element of h has its diagonal entries in z p otherwise it will be hyperbolic see remark 4 8 suppose for contradiction that there is an elliptic element h of h such that in one block ai it has two different diagonal entries say j 6 l we fix for what follows ai j 6 l then a h n id ah where trace h zp still has nonequal diagonal entries j n 6 l n denote the diagonal entries of a by a 1 an where aj 6 al by the previous paragraph then by lemma 6 31 there exists qp such that aj n p al n p and al n p n t 1 at p 0 thus h a id n det a id h is a hyperbolic element by the first part of the proof the preimage 1 isom f h consists of diagonal matrices with entries in each block at all the same take some g 1 isom f h as al n p n t 1 at p 0 the corresponding entry i of g in the block ai is such that i p 1 moreover we claim g 1 h is an elliptic element of b indeed applying the map from proposition 4 14 to g 1 h and by the choice of g we obtain g 1 h isom i h so by definition g 1 h acts trivially on the flat f as h is in b and g 1 is diagonal the claim follows thus the diagonal entries of g 1 h must be in z p but the j diagonal entry of g 1 h in the block ai is such that aj n det a id 1 i p 1 this contradicts the fact that the diagonal entries of g 1 h are in z p if the dimension of convx e m of the flat em corresponding to h is n 1 then is the ideal chamber c so h is contained up to conjugacy in c as the corresponding lie algebra ah of h is of dimension n 1 and thus contained in the set of diagonal matrices with trace zero we conclude by propositions 6 24 6 23 that h is a diagonal cartan subgroup 7 explicit examples of limits of the diagonal cartan in low dimensions recall k is the group of kth roots of unity in qp 7 1 sl 2 qp we compute a limit of the diagonal cartan by lemma 6 3 it is sufficient to conju gate c only by sequences in the unipotent radical u of b in view of corollary 6 25 we may replace cart g ch by cart g ch and c by c observe that 1 p n 0 1 an 0 0 an 1 p n 0 1 1 an 2 p nan 0 an for this to converge to 0 x 0 0 it is enough to take an pnx 2 this computation shows that n 0 x 0 0 x qp is a chabauty limit of conjugates of c applying gr we obtain that id u is an elliptic cartan limit we now show this is the only possible limit up to conjugacy proposition 7 1 up to conjugacy there is only one limit of c in cart sl 2 qp ch cart sl 2 qp the product of the unipotent radical of the borel subgroup b with id proof recall the bruhat tits building of sl 2 qp is a p 1 regular tree tp 1 and up to conjugacy there is only one parabolic subgroup the borel subgroup b equal to the set of the upper triangular matrices of sl 2 qp see example 4 10 21 leth be a limit of the diagonal cartan by proposition 6 2 it is enough to considerh id b by theorem 6 32 if h is an elliptic cartan limit h is contained in the unipotent radical of b times the square roots of unity id moreover by propositions 6 23 6 24 and corollary 6 28 the subalgebra ah cart sl 2 qp ch corresponding to h is of dimension one and is a subset of all upper triangular matrices in sl 2 qp with only zero on the diagonal in other words ah is the set of strictly upper diagonal nilpotent matrices then h ah id id u with u the unipotent radical of b if h is a hyperbolic cartan limit by theorem 6 37 h is in cart sl 2 qp we obtain geometric intuition using the lattice construction of the bruhat tits buildingx tp 1 of sl 2 qp from gar 97 chapter 19 the diagonal cartan subgroup stabilizes an apartment which in the tree tp 1 is a bi infinite line a vertex in tp 1 is an equivalence class of lattices and by choosing the standard basis for q 2 p the vertices of the a bi infinite line stabilized by c are determined by the chosen base in q 2 p going to infinity can be seen by moving the second basis vector onto the first basis vector so that the angle between them goes to zero they collapse to a single generalized eigenvector which is preserved by the limit group under this same sequence 7 2 sl 3 qp by gar 97 chapter 19 the bruhat tits building x for sl 3 qp is constructed by gluing triangles with p 1 triangles along each edge vertices correspond to lattices in q 3 p to go to infinity we move the generators of the lattice close together in different ways which gives us non conjugate limits of c to classify limits in sl 3 qp we use remark 7 2 by ser 70 the ore me 2 page 33 the structure of q p is given by q p z zp z p 1 z p 6 2 z z 2 z 2 z p 2 if p 6 3 then zp is a 3 divisible group in which every element is a cube from this it is easy to compute q 3 q p q p 3 9 p 3 9 p 1 mod 3 3 p 2 mod 3 proposition 7 3 up to conjugacy there are 3 q 3 limits of c in cart sl 3 qp ch cart sl 3 qp the product of 3 with a x 0 0 a 0 0 0 1 a 2 1 x y 0 1 x 0 0 1 1 x y 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 y 0 1 x 0 0 1 where qp is fixed we will need the following lemma 7 4 set n 1 x y 0 1 x 0 0 1 x y qp in sl 3 qp the subgroups n and n are conjugate if and only and are in the same class of q p q p 3 proof if and are in the same class of q p q p 3 then 1 3 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 2 3 22 conjugates n into n conversely assume that n and n are conjugate by some t sl 3 qp then t also conjugates the lie algebras n and n where n x 0 x y 0 0 x 0 0 0 x y qp let e 1 e 2 e 3 be the canonical basis of q 3 p since e 1 x n ker x and n and n are conjugate by t we see that e 1 is t invariant similarly since e 1 e 2 x n ker x 2 we see that e 1 e 2 is t invariant in other words t is upper triangular say t 0 0 0 1 then by direct computation tx t 1 0 x 0 0 2 x 0 0 0 for this to be in n we need 2 i e is a cube in q p proof of 7 3 let h be a limit of the diagonal cartan by proposition 6 2 it is enough to consider h 3 b where b is the minimal parabolic subgroup that equals the upper triangular matrices of sl 3 qp see example 4 10 by section 6 3 if h is a hyperbolic cartan limit h either stabilizes a 2 dimensional flat that is an apartment or a 1 dimensional flat the former case gives a diagonal cartan subgroup by section 6 3 and theorem 6 37 in the latter case there are three possible subgroups a x 0 0 a 0 0 0 a 2 a 2 0 0 0 a x 0 0 a a 0 x 0 a 2 0 0 0 a where a q p and x qp but these are all conjugate by permutation matrices to show that the first appears as a limit of the diagonal cartan we proceed as in proposition 7 1 and work at the level of cart sl 3 qp ch 1 p n 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 xn 0 0 0 yn 0 0 0 xn yn 1 p n 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 xn p n yn xn 0 0 yn 0 0 0 xn yn for this to converge to a x 0 0 a 0 0 0 2 a we may take xn a and yn a p nx this takes care of the unique up to conjugacy non trivial hyperbolic cartan limit by theorem 6 32 if h is an elliptic cartan limit then h is contained in the product of 3 with the unipotent radical of b by propositions 6 23 6 24 and corollary 6 28 the subalgebra ah cart sl 3 qp ch corresponding to h is of dimension two and a subset of the upper triangular matrices in sl 3 qp having only zero on the diagonal so ah id h it is then easy to see that the abelian subgroup h is conjugate to the product of 3 with one of the following three subgroups with x y qp n 1 x y 0 1 x 0 0 1 1 x y 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 y 0 1 x 0 0 1 and where qp is fixed by lemma 7 4 the number of conjugacy classes of n is q p q p 3 q 3 23 we claim that all the above three subgroups are limits of c indeed consider the case of n and the following conjugating matrix p n 1 2 p 2 n 0 1 p n 0 0 1 again work at the level of cart sl 3 qp ch then p n p 2 n 2 0 1 p n 0 0 1 xn 0 0 0 yn 0 0 0 xn yn p n p 2 n 2 0 1 p n 0 0 1 1 xn p n yn xn 3 p 2 nyn 2 0 yn p n xn 2 yn 0 0 xn yn for this to converge to 0 x y 0 0 x 0 0 0 we may take xn p nx and yn 2 p 2 ny 3 the reader can verify that the two remaining subgroups are obtained as limits of c using the following conjugating sequences respectively 1 p n p n 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 p n 0 1 p n 0 0 1 remark 7 5 the sequences of conjugating matrices follow a geometric pattern the cartan sub group c naturally preserves a projective triangle in p q 3 p the limits of c correspond to different ways of identifying points and lines in the triangle given by projective transformations which are the same as the conjugating matrices for a full explanation see lei 16 example 7 6 recall sl 3 f 2 is a finite simple lie group whose affine weyl group is the dihedral group of order 6 its associated bruhat tits building is a finite spherical building that is represented by the heawood graph there are two kinds of vertices in the heawood graph blue vertices corre sponding to a point in p f 32 and the red vertices corresponding to a line in p f 3 2 an apartment is a hexagon i e 6 connected vertices in the heawood graph and every half apartment is represented as 4 connected vertices in the graph in the bruhat tits building of sl 3 q 2 every vertex has a link ab 08 def a 19 which is represented by the bruhat tits building for sl 3 f 2 ab 08 prop a 20 which is the heawood graph moreover a spherical apartment in the spherical building at infinity for sl 3 q 2 is repre sented by an apartment in the heawood graph the red and blue types of vertices of the heawood graph are stabilized by the two maximal parabolic subgroups of sl 3 q 2 intuitively these red and blue vertices are associated with the last two groups in the list of proposition 7 3 the second group in the list of proposition 7 3 preserves the maximal flag e 1 e 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 e 3 which appears as the edge connecting a red and a blue vertex in the heawood graph note by proposi tion 6 2 all these three groups are contained in the borel subgroup that stabilizes an edge chamber in the spherical building at infinity for sl 3 q 2 this ideal chamber corresponds to an edge in the heawood graph finally the first group preserves a wall in the bruhat tits building of sl 3 q 2 that is a line the two ideal opposite endpoints of this line are a red and a blue vertex they can be visualized as two non connected vertices in an apartment of the heawood graph in the bruhat tits building associated with sl 3 qp where p 2 the links of vertices will be larger graphs compare these results with similar results by hae 13 lei 16 st 68 over r and c the proofs written by hae 13 st 68 are not geometric and

number of conjugacy classes of limits of c is bounded below by 12 q 2 q 4 and bounded above by 12 q 2 q 8 iliev and manivel prove there are 14 conjugacy classes of 3 dimensional abelian subalgebras in sl 4 c see im 05 this list is the same as ours with only one representative for each family of conjugacy classes since c is algebraically closed lemma 7 8 a the groups n 1 n 1 are conjugate in sl 4 qp if and only if are in the same square class 25 b if the groups n 4 and n 4 are conjugate in sl 4 qp then and are in the same coset of q p q p 4 if and are in the same coset of q p q p 8 then the groups n 4 and n 4 are conjugate in sl 4 qp proof a the proof of the necessary condition is very similar to the one of lemma 7 4 we just sketch the idea assume that n 1 n 1 are conjugate by some t sl

ker x and e 1 e 2 e 3 x n 4 ker x 2 we see that e 1 and e 1 e 2 e 3 are t invariant subspaces so that t has the form t xt 0 a y 0 0 1 det a for some q p x y q 2 p a gl 2 qp then by direct computation tx t 1 0 ata 1 0 0 det a ad a 0 0 0 setting a at 1 a we get tx t 1 0 a 0 0 det a ad a ta 0 0 0 expressing that tx t 1 is in n 4 we get det a ad a ta d a for every a q 2 p i e det a ad a t d taking

closed field the work here is necessary to descend from the algebraic closure to qp so we need to understand whether or not it is possible to multiply an entry by a scalar in groups which have repeated entries then we need to determine conjugacy classes of groups see also hae 10 lei 16 c for classifications over r if h is a hyperbolic cartan limit by section 6 3 h preserves a flat of dimension 1 2 or 3 this is the same codimension as the largest block which has a common eigenvalue the proof of proposition 7 3 may be applied to classify the hyperbolic cartan limits as the first 6 groups if h is an elliptic cartan limit by theorem 6 32 h is contained in the unipotent radical of b 4 one computes that in order for a group to be abelian entries on diagonals must be zero or scalar multiples of one another given a group of matrices of the form 1 x a t 0 1 y b 0 0 1 z 0 0 0 1 as x y z a b t run over qp one checks that one of the following conditions is necessary for the group to be abelian first notice x y are either zero or scalar multiples of one another and the same for y z if y 6 0 and xz 6 0 then from the previous relations we get x y z are scalar multiples of one another and either a 0 b 0 or a b are scalar multiples of one another if a or b 0 then we do not get a group so we must have that x y z are scalar multiples of each other and a b are scalar multiples of each other so that after checking the group laws we see it has the form 1 x a t 0 1 x a 0 0 1 x 0 0 0 1 where qp are fixed scalars and x a t run over qp but this group is conjugate to a group where 1 by diag 1 1 1 so we are left with the group n 1 which provides q 2 conjugacy classes by lemma 7 8 27 if y 0 and xz 6 0 and ab 6 0 then x is a scalar multiple of z or b and z is a scalar multiple of x or a so we get the groups n 4 whose conjugacy classes are studied in lemma 7 8 if y 0 and xz 6 0 and a b 0 we get the group n 6 if y 6 0 and x z 0 then a b t may take any value this is a maximal abelian subgroup which is 4 dimensional see st 68 since we are interested in 3 dimensional groups we require some linear relation in y a b t one checks that the groups is then either conjugate to n 5 thus we are left with the cases where some of x z a b 0 if x or z 0 then ab 0 or a is a scalar multiple of b in the case that a b are scalar multiples we do not get a group if one of a b 0 then one checks that the group is conjugate to n 2 or n 3 if a or b 0 then either xz 0 or x is a scalar multiple of z if one of a b is zero and one of x z is zero then the group is conjugate to n 7 or n 8 if one of a b 0 and x is a scalar multiple of z then again we do not have a group thus we have run over all possible cases for x y z a b t and we have obtained all of the groups in our list this also concludes the proof of theorem 1 4 the spherical building at infinity for sl 4 qp has three kinds of vertices whose stabilizers in sl 4 qp are the maximal parabolic subgroups and they correspond to fixing a point line or plane in p q 3 p intuitively these correspond to n 8 n 6 and n 7 respectively the group n 5 also fixes the vertex that corresponds to planes in p q 3 p the group n 3 preserves the edge between the vertices fixing a plane and line in p q 3 p the group n 2 preserves the edge between vertices fixing a vertex and line in p q 3 p the groups n 4 preserve the edge between vertices fixing a plane and a point since n 4 is contained in the unipotent radical of the parabolic which preserves this edge at infinity the groups n 1 correspond to preserving the triangle between vertices fixing a vertex line plane in p q 3 p the groups with eigenvalues preserve opposite faces in the spherical building at infinity for sl 4 qp notice they are made by gluing together unipotent conjugacy limits in lower dimen sions 7 4 sl 5 qp and higher using the same sorts of arguments as the above we conjecture that there are again finitely many limits of the cartan in sl 5 qp hyperbolic cartan limit groups are constructed by gluing together elliptic cartan limit groups from lower dimensions as each block with matching diagonal entries on each block see theorem 6 37 so there will again be finitely many hyperbolic cartan limit groups elliptic cartan limit groups must be contained in the unipotent radical of a parabolic product with 5 the largest such abelian subgroup of any unipotent radical is the image of an abelian representation from q 6 p so we conjecture that it is still only possible to fit finitely many conjugacy classes of limits of the cartan inside this unipotent radical in sl 6 qp there is an abelian subgroup of a unipotent radical which is the image of a rep resentation from q 9 p computing conjugacy classes of limits of the cartan in sl 6 qp is open for n 7 the next section shows there are infinitely many conjugacy limits of the cartan up to conjugacy remark 7 9 it is a natural question to ask which limits of the cartan can limit to others the incidence geometry of the spherical building answers this question for us nicely consider first the case of a hyperbolic cartan limit h then h stabilizes a flat in the bruhat tits building by taking a limit of a sequence of conjugates of h it is then clear that the dimension of the corresponding stabilized flat cannot increase so hyperbolic cartan limits can limit to either hyperbolic cartan limits which stabilize lower dimensional flats or to elliptic cartan limits 28 recall the unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroups decreases as the dimension of the face in the spherical building at infinity decreases see example 4 10 we mean there are less blocks in the unipotent radical and the size of the blocks is smaller if h is an elliptic cartan limit we expect h to be contained in a unipotent radical u i which is the unipotent radical stabilizing the face fi then a limit of a sequence of conjugates of h must be contained in a unipotent radical whose corresponding face in the spherical building at infinity is contained in fi notice that this corrects the digraph of limit groups in im 05 8 an infinite family of nonconjugate limits in this section we adapt arguments due to haettel iliev manivel and leitner iliev and manivel study red n the zariski closure of cart sl n r in the grassmannians grass n 1 sl n r endowed with the zariski topology recall by proposition 6 27 that the chabauty topology on s sl n qp n 1 is compatible with the topology of the grassmanniansgrass n 1 sl n qp define ab n 1 grass n 1 sl n qp to be the set of abelian subalgebras of dimension n 1 by results of lei 16 b we know that over r we have cart sl n r ch ab n 1 for n 4 and cart sl n r ch ab n 1 for n 5 the same examples used in lei 16 b to show cart sl n r ch ab n 1 for n 5 may be adapted to qp as the arguments use only linear algebra example 8 1 abelian subgroups which are not limits of the cartan consider the image of the representation q 4 p sl 5 qp given by a b c d 7 1 a 0 a 2 2 b 0 1 0 a 0 0 0 1 c d 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 this is an abelian subgroup of sl 5 qp a flat subgroup is a subgroup of sl n qp which is the intersection of a vector subspace of q n 2 p with sl n qp end q n p the diagonal cartan subgroup c is flat conjugacy is a linear map so it preserves this property and chabauty limits of conjugates of c are also flat by proposition 6 27 the group in this example is not flat and so although 4 dimensional it cannot be a limit of c similar examples as above can be constructed for n 6 theorem 8 2 for n 5 we have cart sl n qp ch is a proper subset of ab n 1 proof extend example 8 1 iliev and manivel and haettel give a counting argument which proves theorem 8 2 for n 7 over c and r respectively they count the dimension of the space of subalgebras isomorphic to rn 1 and show is cubic in n compared with the dimension of the space of limits of the cartan subalgebra which is quadratic in n leitner s examples gave the first explicit examples of subalgebras isomorphic to rn 1 which are not limits of the diagonal cartan subalgebra leitner lei 16 b also gives a lower bound on the covering dimension ofcart sl n r ch conjugacy over r to extend this to qp a good notion of dimension is needed and we intend to explore this in future work let g be a group which acts on the projective space p kn over a field k and let a b g be subgroups every orbit of a has a closure which spans a projective subspace the dimension of an orbit closure is the dimension of this projective subspace the set of orbit closures of a is 29 the set of all closures of all orbits of a if a and b are conjugate then the orbit closures of a and b are projectively equivalent i e there is a projective transformation taking the orbit closures of ay p kn to the orbit closures of b leitner produces a continuum of groups with non conjugate orbit closures we adapt the same argument from lei 16 b proposition 8 3 for n 7 there are infinitely many nonconjugate limits of c in sl n qp proof we give a sketch of proof for n 7 which contains all the main ideas and significantly reduces notation the details for n 7 may be read in lei 16 b and nothing about the topology of r is used so the same proof will work in the projective space over qp let qp 0 1 2 be fixed consider the homomorphism q 6 p sl 7 qp and the sequence pm m n a b c d e f 1 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 1 0 0 0 b b 0 0 1 0 0 c 2 c 0 0 0 1 0 d d 0 0 0 0 1 e f 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 pm 1 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 1 0 0 0 m m 0 0 1 0 0 m 2 m 0 0 0 1 0 m m 0 0 0 0 1 m 2 m 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 then the image of is a group l we see that l is a limit of the cartan under conjugacy by conjugating c by the sequence pm m n of matrices and taking a limit as m in the chabauty topology we want to show l is not conjugate to l for 6 uc 0 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 here uc 0 1 2 is the set of all possible cross ratios of the four points 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 in any order we follow leitner s argument and show the orbits of l acting on the projective space p q 7 p are not projectively equivalent to the orbit closures of l the orbit closures of l are a fixed four dimensional space surrounded by a sheaf of 5 dimensional spaces some of which break down further we count the dimension of an orbit of a point x p q 7 p under l there are three cases case 1 x e 1 e 5 then l acts as the identity and the dimension of an orbit is 0 case 2 x e 1 e 5 te 6 e 7 and t 6 0 1 2 then the orbit is 5 dimensional case 3 x e 1 e 5 te 6 e 7 and t 0 1 2 then the orbit is 4 dimensional we can project out the space e 1 e 5 and onto the projective line e 6 e 7 this gives us four special points on the line 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 the unordered cross ratio is a projective invariant of these four points so the sets of points 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 and 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 are projectively equivalent if and only if they have the same unordered cross ratio and this proves the claim leitner generalizes this proof to groups with a matrix of coefficients in the upper right the dimension count comes from counting the degrees of freedom in the matrix after applying the unordered generalized cross ratio all of the details can be found in lei 16 b references ab 08 peter abramenko and
