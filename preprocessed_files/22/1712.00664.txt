integrable g sl modules which depend on the choice of a certain reductive in g subalgebra k g the simple objects of tg k are tensor modules as in the previously studied category tg dps however the choice of k provides for more flexibility of nonsimple modules in tg k compared to tg we then choose k to have two infinite dimensional diagonal blocks and show that a certain injective object km n in tg k realizes a categorical sl action on the category o z m n the integral category o of the lie superalgebra gl m n we show that the socle of km n is generated by the projective modules in oz m n and compute the socle filtration of km n explicitly we conjecture that the socle filtration of km n reflects a degree of atypicality filtration on the category oz m n we also conjecture that a natural tensor filtration on km n arises via the duflo serganova functor sending the category oz m n to o z m 1 n 1 we prove a weaker version of this latter conjecture for the direct summand of km n corresponding to finite dimensional gl m n modules mathematics subject classification 2010 primary 17 b 65 17 b 10 17 b 55 key words super category o integrable sl module duflo serganova functor socle filtration injective module 1 introduction categorification has set a trend in mathematics in the last two decades and has proved important and useful the opposite process of studying a given category via a combinatorial or algebraic object such as a single module has also borne ample fruit an example is brundan s idea from 2003 to study the category fz m n of finite dimensional integral modules over the lie superalgebra gl m n via the weight structure of the sl module mv nv where v and v are the two nonisomorphic defining natural representations of sl using this approach brundan computes decomposition numbers in fz m n b an extension of brundan s approach was proposed in the work of brundan losev and webster in blw where a new proof of the brundan kazhdan lusztig conjecture for the category o over the lie superalgebra gl m n is given the first proof of the brundan kazhdan lusztig conjecture for the category o over the lie superalgebra gl m n was given by cheng lam and wang in clw the same approach was also used by brundan and stroppel in bs where the algebra of endomorphisms of a projective generator in fz m n is described as a certain diagram algebra and the koszulity of fz m n is established all three authors have been supported in part by dfg grant pe 980 6 1 the first and third authors been partially supported by bsf grant 2012227 the third author has been also supported by nsf grant dms 1701532 1 http arxiv org abs 1712 00664 v 4 integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 2 the representation theory of the lie algebra sl is of independent interest and has been developing actively also for about two decades in particular several categories of sl modules have been singled out and studied in detail see dp pstyr dps ps nam the category tsl from dps has been playing a prominent role its objects are finite length submodules of a direct sum of several copies of the tensor algebra t v v in dps it is proved that tsl is a self dual koszul category in ss it has been shown that tsl has a universality property and in fps tsl has been used to categorify the boson fermion correspondence our goal in the present paper is to find an appropriate category of sl modules which contains modules relevant to the representation theory of the lie superalgebras gl m n for this purpose we introduce and study the categories tg k where g sl and k is a reductive subalgebra of g containing the diagonal subalgebra and consisting of finitely many blocks along the diagonal the lie algebra k is infinite dimensional and is itself isomorphic to the commutator subalgebra of a finite direct sum of copies of gl n for varying n and copies of gl when k g this new category coincides with tg a well known property of the category tg states that for every m tg any vector m m is annihilated by a large subalgebra g g i e by an algebra which contains the commutator subalgebra of the centralizer of a finite dimensional subalgebra s g for a general k as above the category tg k has the same simple objects as tg but requires the following for a nonsimple module m the annihilator in k of every m m is a large subalgebra of k this makes the nonsimple objects of tg k more flexible than in those of tg the degree of flexibility being governed by k in section 3 we study the category tg k in detail one of our main results being an explicit computation of the socle filtration of an indecomposable injective object i of tg k where and are two young diagrams see theorem 20 an effect which can be observed here is that with a sufficient increase in the number of infinite blocks of k the layers of the socle filtration of i grow in a self similar manner this shows that tg k is an intricate extension of the category tg within the category of all integrable g modules in section 4 we show that studying the category tg k achieves our goal of improving the understanding of the integral category oz m n for the lie superalgebra gl m n more precisely we choose k to have two blocks both of them infinite then we show that the category oz m n is a categorification of an injective object km n in the category tg k in order to accomplish this we exploit the properties of tg k as a category and not just as a collection of modules the object km n of tg k can be defined as the complexified reduced grothendieck group of the category oz m n endowed with an sl module structure categorical action of sl for m n 1 km n is an object of tg k but not of tg we prove that the socle of km n as an sl module is the submodule generated by classes of projective gl m n modules in oz m n moreover we conjecture that the socle filtration of km n which we already know from section 3 arises from filtering the category oz m n according to the degree of atypicality of gl m n modules we provide some partial evidence toward this conjecture we also show that the category fz m n of finite dimensional integral gl m n modules cat egorifies a direct summand jm n of km n which is nothing but an injective hull in tg k of brundan s module mv nv see corollary 28 note that the module mv nv is an injective object of tg but is not injective in tg k when k has two or more infinite blocks integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 3 finally we conjecture that a natural filtration on the category oz m n defined via the duflo serganova functor ds oz m n oz m 1 n 1 categorifies the tensor filtration of km n i e the coarsest filtration of km n whose successive quotients are objects of tg we have a similar conjecture for the direct summand jm n of km n and we provide evidence for this conjecture in proposition 42 2 acknowledgements we would like to thank two referees for their extremely thorough and thoughtful comments 3 new categories of integrable sl modules 3 1 preliminaries let v and v be countable dimensional vector spaces with fixed bases vi i z and v j j z together with a nondegenerate pairing v v c defined by vi v j ij then gl v v has a lie algebra structure such that vi v j vk v l vk v j vi v l vi v l vk v j we can identify gl with the space of infinite matrices aij i j z with finitely many nonzero entries where the vector vi v j corresponds to the matrix eij with 1 in the i j position and zeros elsewhere then corresponds to the trace map and its kernel is the lie algebra sl which is generated by ei ei i 1 fi ei 1 i with i z one can also realize sl as a direct limit of finite dimensional lie algebras sl lim sl n in contrast to the finite dimensional setting the exact sequence 0 sl gl c 0 does not split and the center of gl is trivial let g sl the representations v and v are the defining representations of g the tensor representations v p v q p q z 0 have been studied in pstyr they are not semisimple when p q 0 however each simple subquotient of v p v q occurs as a submodule of v p v q for some p q the simple submodules of v p v q can be parameterized by two young diagrams and we denote them v recall that the socle of a module m denoted socm is the largest semisimple submodule of m the socle filtration of m is defined inductively by soc 0 m socm and socim p 1 i soc m soc i 1 m where pi m m soc i 1 m is the natural projection we also use the notation socim socim soci 1 m for the layers of the socle filtration schur weyl duality for sl implies that the module v p v q decomposes as 3 1 v p v q p q s v s v y y where y and y are irreducible sp and sq modules and s denotes the schur functor corresponding to the young diagram equivalently partition each module s v s v is indecomposable and its socle filtration is described in pstyr moreover theorem 2 3 of pstyr claims that 3 2 sock s v s v k n n v integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 4 where n are the standard littlewood richardson coefficients in particular s v s v has simple socle v it was also shown in pstyr theorem 2 2 that the socle of v p v q equals the intersection of the kernels of all contraction maps ij v p v q v p 1 v q 1 3 3 v 1 vp v 1 v q 7 v j vi v 1 v i vp v 1 v j v q a g module is called a tensor module if it is isomorphic to a submodule of a finite direct sum of sl modules of the form v pi v qi for pi qi z 0 the category of tensor modules tg is by definition the full subcategory of g mod consisting of tensor modules dps a finite length g module m lies in tg if and only if m is integrable and satisfies the large annihilator condition dps recall that a g module m is called integrable if dim m x m x 2 m for any x g m m a g module is said to satisfy the large annihilator condition if for each m m the annihilator anngm contains the commutator subalgebra of the centralizer of a finite dimensional subalgebra of g the modules v p v q p q z 0 are injective in the category tg moreover every indecomposable injective object of tg is isomorphic to an indecomposable direct summand of v p v q for some p q z 0 dps consequently by 3 1 an indecomposable injective in tg is isomorphic to s v s v for some the category tg is a subcategory of the category t ensg which was introduced in ps as the full subcategory of g mod whose objects m are defined to be the integrable g modules of finite loewy length such that the algebraic dual m homc m c is also integrable and of finite loewy length the categories tg and t ensg have the same simple objects v ps dps the indecomposable injective objects of t ensg are up to isomorphism the modules v and soc v v ps a recent result of cp 2 shows that the grothendieck envelope tensg of t ensg is an ordered tensor category and that any injective object in tensg is a direct sum of indecomposable injectives from t ensg 3 2 the categories tg k in this section we introduce new categories of integrable sl modules this is motivated in part by the applications to the representation theory of the lie superalgebras gl m n let g sl with the natural representation denoted v consider a decomposition 3 4 v v 1 vr for some vector subspaces vi of v let l be the lie subalgebra of g preserving this decom position then k l l is isomorphic to k 1 kr where each ki is isomorphic to sl ni or sl definition 1 denote by t g k the full subcategory of t ensg consisting of modules m satisfying the large annihilator condition as a module over ki for all i 1 r by tg k we denote the full subcategory of t g k consisting of finite length modules both categories tg k and t g k are abelian symmetric monoidal categories with respect to the usual tensor product of g modules two categories t g k and t g k are equal if k and k have finite corank in k k so we will henceforth assume without loss of generality that each vi in decomposition 3 4 is infinite dimensional note that tg g tg integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 5 we define the functor g k t ensg t g k by taking the maximal submodule lying in t g k then 3 5 g k m m s 1 sr where the union is taken over all finite corank subalgebras s 1 k 1 sr kr lemma 2 let tg k be as in definition 1 1 the simple objects of tg k and of t g k are isomorphic to v 2 the functor g k sends injective modules in t ensg to injective modules in t g k 3 the category t g k has enough injective modules 4 the indecomposable injective objects of t g k are isomorphic to g k v proof 1 the category tg is a full subcategory of tg k and of t g k which are both full subcategories of t ensg since the categories tg and t ensg have the same simple objects v the claim follows 2 this follows from the definition of g k since homtg k x g k y homt ensg x y for all x tg k and y t ensg 3 every module m in t g k can be embedded into g k m which is injective in t g k since m is injective in t ensg ps 4 this follows from 1 and 2 since v is an indecomposable injective object of t ensg and consequently g k v is an indecomposable injective object of t g k with soc g k v v remark 3 it will follow from corollary 12 that the indecomposable injective objects g k v are objects of tg k consequently tg k and t g k have the same indecomposable injectives 3 3 the functor r and jordan h lder multiplicities in this section we calculate the jordan h lder multiplicities of the indecomposable injective objects of the categories tg k one of the main tools we use for this computation is the functor r which we will now introduce let 3 6 v v 1 vr 1 g g gl v k k 1 kr 1 let vr v be the annihilator of v v 1 vr 1 with respect to the pairing we have g sl and k g define a functor r from the category g mod of all g modules to the category g mod by setting r m mkr it follows from the definition that after restricting to t g k we have a functor r t g k t g k lemma 4 the following diagram of functors is commutative g mod r g mod g k y g k y t g k r t g k integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 6 proof by 3 5 we have g k m m s 1 sr for any g module m then r g k m m s 1 sr kr m s 1 sr 1 kr r m s 1 sr 1 g k r m lemma 5 if are young diagrams then r s v s v n n s r v s r v proof since r v v we have the decompositions v r v vr v r v vr we also have the identity 3 7 s v w n s v s w which holds for all vector spaces v and w these imply s v s v n n s r v s vr s r v s vr by definition r s v s v homg s v s v c and it follows from 3 2 that dimhomg s vr s vr c being kronecker s delta therefore homg s v s v c n n s r v s r v lemma 6 if 0 a b c 0 is an exact sequence of modules in t ensg then the dual exact sequence 0 c b a 0 splits proof this follows from the fact that c is injective in t ensg lemma 7 the functor r t g k t g k sends an indecomposable injective object to an injective object proof let p g k s v s v then by lemma 4 we have r p g k r s v s v and hence by lemma 5 3 8 r p n n g k s r v s r v integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 7 therefore r p is injective in t g k every indecomposable injective object in t g k is isomorphic to g k l for some simple object l v and by lemma 6 g k l is a direct summand of p g k s v s v since the functor r is left exact r g k l is a direct summand of r p hence r g k l is injective in t g k lemma 8 let v vn w and v v n w be decompositions with dim vn n w v n and w vn let s be the commutator subalgebra of w w let m tg be a module such that all its simple constituents are of the form v with n then the length of ms in the category of sl n modules equals the length of m in tg proof it follows from 3 7 and the fact that s vn and s v n are nonzero since dimvn that s v s v s s vn s v n the description of the layers of the socle filtration of s v s v in 3 2 shows that the length of s v s v equals the length of s vn s v n furthermore since the socle v of s v s v coincides with the set of vectors annihilated by all contraction maps see 3 3 and the set of vectors in s vn s v n annihilated by all contraction maps is the simple sl n module v n we obtain v s v n it then follows from left exactness that the functor s does not increase the length let m tg and let k m be the maximum of over all simple constituents v of m we proceed by proving the statement by induction on k m with the obvious base case k m 0 consider an exact sequence 0 m i n 0 where i is an injective hull of m in tg from the description of the socle filtration of an injective module in tg see 3 2 we have k n k m therefore the length l n of n equals the length l ns of ns by the induction assumption on the other hand since i is injective and hence isomorphic to a direct sum of s v s v with n the length of i equals the length of is now if l ms l m then l ns l is l ms l i l m l n which is a contradiction corollary 9 let s be a subalgebra of g as in lemma 8 and let m t g be a module such that all its simple constituents are of the form v with n then m u g ms proof since m is a direct limit of modules of finite length it suffices to prove the statement for m tg this can be easily done by induction on the length of m indeed consider an exact sequence 0 n m l 0 with simple l lemma 8 implies that 0 ns ms ls 0 is also exact because the functor s is left exact and l ls l ms l ns now if u g ms 6 m then since u g ns n by the induction assumption we obtain u g ms n this implies ms ns and hence l ls 0 which contradicts lemma 8 lemma 10 for any m tg k we have u g r m m proof recall the definition of k m from the proof of lemma 8 and recall the decomposition 3 4 let u be a subspace of v and u be a subspace of v such that vr u and vr u each of codimension k m integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 8 denote by l g the commutator subalgebra of u u and by resl the restriction functor from tg k to t l the identity 3 7 implies that k resl m k m by corollary 9 with g l and s kr we get m u l r m the statement follows lemma 11 the functor r tg k tg k is exact and sends a simple module v tg k to the corresponding simple module v tg k and hence induces an isomorphism between the grothendieck groups of tg k and tg k proof since v is in fact an object of tg the statement about simple modules follows by the argument concerning contraction maps from the proof of lemma 8 since r is left exact we have the inequality 3 9 l r m l m thus to prove exactness of r it suffices to show that r preserves the length i e l m l r m we prove this by induction on l m consider an exact sequence of g modules 0 n m l 0 such that l is simple by the induction hypothesis we have l r n l n if we assume that l r m l m then l r m l n and so r n r m but then by lemma 10 we have n m which is a contradiction corollary 12 for any the module g k s v s v has finite length hence the module i g k v has finite length and is an object of the category tg k proof it was proven in dps that g g s v s v has finite length in t g see the proof of proposition 4 5 in dps and note that the functor g g is denoted by b in dps using 3 8 the first claim follows by induction on the number r of components in the decomposition of v for the second claim observe that lemma 6 implies i is isomorphic to a direct summand of the module g k s v s v lemma 13 let i denote an injective hull of the simple module v in tg k and let j denote an injective hull of r v in tg k then r i n n j proof we have i g k v and j g k v let p g k s v s v q g k s r v s r v then we have 3 10 p n n i q n n j indeed using lemma 6 we can deduce from 3 2 that s v s v n n v and then by applying g k to both sides we obtain 3 10 integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 9 by 3 8 we have r p n n q let ig k denote the complexified grothendieck group of the additive subcategory of tg k generated by indecomposable injective modules then i and p both form a basis for ig k let a a be the change of basis matrix on ig k given by 3 10 which expresses p in terms of i the same matrix a expresses q in terms of j by 3 10 the functor r induces a linear operator from ig k to ig k which is represented by the matrix a with respect to both bases p and q hence the matrix which represents r with respect to the bases i and j is again a as a aa a 1 corollary 14 the jordan h lder multiplicities of the indecomposable injective modules i are given by i v 1 r n 1 r n 1 r proof after applying the functor r to the module i r 1 times we obtain a direct sum of injective modules in the category tg the multiplicity of each indecomposable injective in this sum is thus determined by applying the matrix ar 1 to i the jordan h lder multiplicities of an indecomposable injective module in tg are also given by the matrix a see 3 2 therefore i ar v 3 4 the socle filtration of indecomposable injective objects in tg k in this section we describe the socle filtration of the injective objects i in tg k we consider the restriction functor resk tg k tk where tk denotes the category of integrable k modules of finite length which satisfy the large annihilator condition for each ki recall 3 4 note that simple objects of tk are outer tensor products of simple objects of the categories tki for each ki i 1 r recall that ki sl we will use the notation v 1 r 1 r v 1 1 1 v r r r injective hulls of simple objects in tk will be denoted by i 1 r 1 r k and they are also outer tensor products of injective ki modules i 1 r 1 r k s 1 v 1 s 1 v 1 s r vr s r vr recall that for every object m in tg k we denote by k m the maximum of for all simple constituents v of m similarly for every object x in tk we denote by c x the maximum of 1 r 1 r for all simple constituents v 1 r 1 r of x it follows from corollary 14 that 3 11 k m k socm c x c socx integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 10 the identities 3 12 k m n k m k n c x y c x c y follow easily from the littlewood richardson rule and we leave their proof to the reader lemma 15 the restriction functor resk maps the category tg k to the category tk and it maps s v s v to an injective module furthermore we have the identity c resk m k m proof after applying identity 3 7 r times to s v s v we get resk s v s v n 1 rn 1 r i 1 r 1 r k this implies the first and the second assertions of the lemma identity 3 11 implies that it is sufficient to prove the last assertion for m s v s v hence this assertion follows from the above computation conjecture 16 suppose extktg k v v 6 0 then k remark 17 for k g this was proven in dps proving this conjecture would imply that the category tg k is koszul we prove the case k 1 proposition 18 suppose ext 1 tg k v v 6 0 then 1 proof since v is isomorphic to a simple constituent of i we know by corollary 14 that s 1 it remains to show that s 1 we will do this in two steps first we show that ext 1 tg k v s v s v 6 0 implies s 1 consider a nonsplit short exact sequence in tg k 3 13 0 s v s v m v 0 let v g s v s v be a cocyle which defines this extension by lemma 15 the module resk s v s v is injective in tk and therefore the sequence 3 13 splits over k without loss of generality we may assume that v k 0 then the cocycle condition implies that v g k s v s v is a nonzero homomorphism of k modules consequently the image of contains a simple submodule in the socle of resk s v s v by lemma 15 we have socresk s v s v n 1 rn 1 r v 1 r 1 r in particular c v 1 r 1 r 1 r 1 r for every simple submodule v 1 r 1 r of socresk s v s v therefore c v g k and so 3 12 implies c v c g k since g k i 6 j vi vj we have c v c g k 2 integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 11 and thus 2 s 2 this yields s 1 assume now to the contrary that s 2 set x s v s v v and consider the long exact sequence of ext homg v x ext 1 tg k v v ext 1 tg k v s v s v since s 2 v is not isomorphic to a submodule of socx so homg v x 0 and by the already considered case when s 1 we have ext 1 tg k v s v s v 0 hence ext 1 tg k v v 0 which is a contradiction corollary 19 suppose that m tg k has a simple socle v and the multiplicity of v in sockm is nonzero then k proof this follows by induction on by proposition 18 the module m socm embeds into a direct sum of injective indecomposable modules i with simple socles v satisfying 1 and by induction each i satisfies our claim if the multiplicity of v is nonzero in sockm sock 1 m socm sock 1 i then k 1 the result follows finally by combining corollary 14 and corollary 19 we obtain the following theorem 20 the layers of the socle filtration of an indecomposable injective i in tg k satisfy socki 1 r k n 1 r n 1 r v where r is the number of infinite blocks in k see 3 4 example 21 consider an injective hull of the adjoint representation of sl in the category tg k in the case that k has k infinite blocks then and each consist of one box and socv sl and soc 1 v ck the trivial representation of dimension k the self similarity effect mentioned in the introduction amounts here to the increase of the dimension of soc 1 by 1 when the number of blocks of k increases by 1 remark 22 let s observe that the category tg k is another example of an ordered tensor category as defined in cp 1 indeed the set i in the notation of cp 1 can be chosen as the set of pairs of young diagrams and then the object xi for i equals i 4 sl modules arising from category o for gl m n for the remainder of this paper we let k k 1 k 2 be the commutator subalgebra of the lie algebra preserving a fixed decomposition v v 1 v 2 such that both k 1 and k 2 are isomorphic to sl r 2 in 3 4 integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 12 4 1 category o for the lie superalgebra gl m n let om n denote the category of z 2 graded modules over gl m n which when restricted to gl m n 0 belong to the bgg category ogl m n 0 m section 8 2 3 this category depends only on a choice of simple roots for the lie algebra gl m n 0 and not for all of gl m n we denote by o z m n the serre subcategory of om n consisting of modules with integral weights any simple object in o z m n is isomorphic to l the unique simple quotient of the verma module m for some where denotes the set of integral weights any object in the category oz m n has finite length we denote by fz m n the serre subcategory of o z m n consisting of finite dimensional modules let oz m n oz m n be the parity reversing functor we define the reduced grothendieck group km n respectively jm n to be the quotient of the grothendieck group of o z m n respec tively fz m n by the relation m m the elements l with respectively form a basis for km n respectively jm n we introduce an action of sl on km n km n z c following brundan b our starting point is to define the translation functors ei and fi on the category o z m n consider the invariant form str xy on gl m n and let xj yj be a pair of z 2 homogeneous dual bases of gl m n with respect to this form then for two gl m n modules v and w we define the operator v w v w v w j 1 p xj p v 1 xjv yjw where p xj denotes the parity of the z 2 homogeneous element xj it is easy to check that endgl m n v w let u and u denote the natural and conatural gl m n modules for every m oz m n we let ei m respectively fi m be the generalized eigenspace of in m u respectively m u with eigenvalue i then as it follows from blw the functor u respectively u decomposes into the direct sum of functors i zei respectively i zfi moreover the functors ei and fi are mutually adjoint functors on o z m n we will denote by ei and fi the linear operators which the functors ei and fi induce on km n if we identify ei and fi with the chevalley generators ei i 1 and fi 1 i of sl then km n inherits the natural structure of a sl module this follows from b blw another proof can be obtained by using theorem 3 11 of cs and 4 2 below weight spaces with respect to the diagonal subalgebra h sl correspond to the complexified reduced grothendieck groups of the blocks of oz m n let jm n jm n z c and let tm n km n denote the subspace generated by the classes m of all verma modules m for let furthermore m n jm n denote the subspace generated by the classes k of all kac modules k for for the definition of a kac module see for example b then tm n is an sl submodule isomorphic to v m v n and m n is a submodule of tm n isomorphic to mv nv b to see this let vi i z and wi i z be the standard dual bases in v and v i e h eigenbases in v and v and let m 1 1 0 0 1 1 n m v 1 v m v m 1 v m n integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 13 the map m 7 m establishes an isomorphism tm n v m v n and restricts to an isomorphism m n mv nv k 7 k v 1 v m v m 1 v m n lemma 23 the sl module km n satisfies the large annihilator condition as a module over k 1 and k 2 that is g k km n km n proof note that an sl module m satisfies the large annihilator condition over k 1 and k 2 if and only if for each x m we have eix fix 0 for all but finitely many i z indeed if eix fix 0 for all but finitely many i z then the subalgebra generated by the ei fi that annihilate x contains the commutator subalgebra of the centralizer of a finite dimensional subalgebra the other direction is also clear since the classes of simple gl m n modules l form a basis of km n we just need to show that for each l we have ei l fi l 0 for almost all i z however since tm n satisfies the large annihilator condition we know that the analogous statement is true for m therefore since l is a quotient of m the exactness of the functors ei and fi implies the desired statement for l if we consider the cartan involution of sl ei fi fi ei we obtain 4 1 gx y x g y for all g sl if x is a sl module we denote by x the twist of the algebraic dual x by note that v v hence if x is a semisimple object of finite length in t ensg then x is an injective hull of x in t ensg let pm n denote the semisimple subcategory of o z m n which consists of projective gl m n modules and let pm n denote the reduced grothendieck group of pm n the sl module pm n pm n z c is the socle of tm n cs theorem 3 11 note that for any projective module p pm n the functor homgl m n p on o z m n is exact and for any module m fm n the functor homgl m n m on pm n is exact moreover we have the dual bases in km n and pm n given by the classes of irreducible modules and indecomposable projective modules respectively consider the pairing km n pm n c defined by m p dimhomgl m n p m since the functors ei and fi are adjoint we have eix y x fiy and fix y x eiy for all i z x km n y pm n thus there is an embedding of sl modules 4 2 km n p m n given by m 7 m integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 14 theorem 24 the sl module km n is an injective hull in the category tg k of the semisim ple module pm n furthermore there is an isomorphism km n m n i y y where y y are irreducible modules over sm and sn respectively and i is an injective hull of the simple module v in tg k consequently the layers of the socle filtration of km n are given by sockkm n m n socki dimy dimy where socki 1 2 k n 1 2 n 1 2 v proof the module g k p m n is an injective hull of the semisimple module pm n in the cat egory tg k so it suffices to show that the image of km n under the embedding 4 2 equals g k p m n the fact that km n g k p m n follows from lemma 23 herein we will identify km n with its image km n span l where l l now soc g k p m n pm n since pm n is semisimple and soctm n pm n by cs theorem 3 11 therefore since tm n km n g k p m n we have sockm n pm n we will show that km n g k p m n to accomplish this we use the existence of the dual bases p p pm n and l km n where l denotes the irreducible gl m n module with highest weight and p is a projective cover of l fix g k p m n to prove that km n span l it suffices to show that p 0 for almost all for each q r z with q r we let gq r g q g r where g q is the subalgebra of g generated by ei fi for i q and g r is the subalgebra of g generated by ei fi for i r by the annihilator condition is gq r invariant for suitable q and r fix such q and r then since is gq r invariant it suffices to show that p gq rpm n for almost all if p pm n gq rtm n then p gq rpm n indeed for any gq r module m we have gq rm homgq r m c ker now any gq r module homomorphism pm n c lifts to a gq r module homomorphism km n c since the trivial module c is injective in the full subcategory of gq r mod consisting of integrable finite length gq r modules satisfying the large annihilator condition dps hence the claim follows for each we define supp to be the multiset 1 m m 1 m n where m 1 1 0 0 1 1 n the set of such that supp z q m n z r m n is finite hence to finish the proof of the theorem it suffices to show the following lemma 25 if supp z q m n 6 then p g q tm n similarly if supp z r m n 6 then p g r tm n integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 15 proof we will prove the first statement the proof of the second statement is similar we can write p c m where each c z 0 and m m is the class of the verma module m over gl m n of highest weight we claim that supp z q 6 for every m which occurs in the decomposition of p indeed recall that p is a direct summand in the induced module ind gl m n gl m n 0 p 0 where p 0 is a projective cover of the simple gl m n 0 module with highest weight now 4 3 p 0 w w bw m 0 w where m 0 denotes the verma module over gl m n 0 with highest weight w denotes the weyl group of gl m n 0 and w denotes the 0 shifted action of w the isomorphism of gl m n modules m ind gl m n gl m n 0 gl m n 1 m 0 implies that ind gl m n gl m n 0 m 0 ind gl m n gl m n 0 gl m n 1 m 0 u gl m n 1 therefore ind gl m n gl m n 0 m 0 admits a filtration by verma modules m where runs over the set of weights of u gl m n 1 since supp m n m n for every we have i i m n combining this with 4 3 we obtain that for each i m n i w i m n for some w w the claim follows following the notations of lemma 47 from the appendix we set w 1 span vi i q w 2 span vj j q then g q sl w 1 s by above every m occurring in the decomposition of p is contained in ym n hence p ym n since we also have p soctm n lemma 47 implies that p g q tm n hence km n g k p m n and the description of the socle filtration now follows from theorem 20 4 2 the symmetric group action on km n recall that we have a natural action of the product of symmetric groups sm sn on tm n which commutes with the sl module structure on tm n moreover it follows from dps sect 6 that 4 4 endsl tm n endsl pm n c sm sn a similar result is true for km n proposition 26 endsl km n endsl pm n c sm sn proof recall that pm n is the socle of km n by theorem 24 every endsl km n maps the socle to the socle hence we have a homomorphism 4 5 endsl km n endsl pm n integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 16 let k m n km n pm n by theorem 20 for every simple module v we have k m n v pm n v 0 therefore every endsl km n such that pm n 0 is identically zero since for such the socle of im is zero in other words homomorphism 4 5 is injective the surjectivity follows from the fact that every pm n pm n km n extends to km n km n by the injectivity of km n 4 3 the zuckerman functor gl m n and the category f z m n let us recall the definition of the derived zuckerman functor a systematic treatment of the zuckerman functor for lie superalgebras can be found in s assume that m is a finitely generated gl m n module which is semisimple over the cartan subalgebra of gl m n let gl m n m denote the subspace of gl m n 0 finite vectors then gl m n m is a finite dimensional gl m n module and hence gl m n is a left exact functor from the category of finitely generated gl m n modules semisimple over the cartan subalgebra to the category fm n of finite dimensional modules the corresponding right derived functor i gl m n is called the i th derived zuckerman functor note that i gl m n x 0 for i dim gl m n 0 m n we are interested in the restriction of this functor igl m n o z m n f z m n let us consider the linear operator km n jm n given by m i 1 i igl m n m this operator is well defined as for any short exact sequence of gl m n modules 0 n m l 0 we have the euler characteristic identity m n l it is well known that i gl m n commutes with the functors u and u and with the pro jection to the block oz m n with a fixed central character therefore is a homomorphism of sl modules proposition 27 the homomorphism is given by the formula 4 6 s sm sn sgn s s where the action of s on km n is defined in proposition 26 proof by proposition 26 it suffices to check the equality 4 6 on vectors in tm n which amounts to checking that for all verma modules m 4 7 m s sm sn sgn s m s where s s and m 1 0 0 1 1 n integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 17 consider the functor res 0 of restriction to gl m n 0 this is an exact functor from the category of finitely generated gl m n modules semisimple over the cartan subalgebra to the similar category of gl m n 0 modules it is clear from the definition of i gl m n that 4 8 res 0 i gl m n i gl m n 0 res 0 recall that every verma module m over gl m n has a finite filtration with successive quotients isomorphic to verma modules m 0 over gl m n 0 hence by 4 8 it suffices to check the analogue of 4 7 for even verma modules 4 9 0 m 0 s sm sn sgn s m 0 s where 0 is the obvious analogue of to prove 4 9 we observe that m 0 m 0 where x stands for the contragredient dual of x it is easy to compute i gl m n 0 m 0 let t denote the cartan subalgebra of gl m n and let n 0 n 0 be the maximal nilpotent ideals of the borel and opposite borel subalgebras of gl m n 0 respectively from the definition of the derived zuckerman functor the following holds for any homgl m n 0 l 0 igl m n 0 m ext i l 0 m where the extension is taken in the category of modules semisimple over t if m m 0 then m is cofree over u n 0 and therefore exti l 0 m 0 homt hi n 0 l 0 c now we apply kostant s theorem to conclude that igl m n 0 m 0 l 0 if s for s sm sn l s i 0 otherwise here is the only dominant weight in sm sn and hence s is unique moreover if is a singular weight then i gl m n 0 m 0 0 for all i combining this with the weyl character formula l 0 s sm sn sgn s m 0 s we obtain 4 9 and hence the proposition corollary 28 we have jm n km n and km n jm n ker in particular jm n is an injective hull of m n mv nv recall that m n jm n denotes the subspace generated by the classes of all kac mod ules let qm n denote the additive subcategory of f z m n which consists of projective finite dimensional gl m n modules and let qm n denote the reduced grothendieck group of qm n it was proven in cs theorem 3 11 that qm n qm n zc is the socle of the module m n implying that qm n v m n where indicates the conjugate partition corollary 28 implies the following corollary 29 jm n is an injective hull of qm n and the socle filtration of jm n is socijm n v m i n i i 1 integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 18 4 4 the duflo serganova functor and the tensor filtration in this section we discuss the relationship between the duflo serganova functor and submodules of the sl modules km n and jm n let a a 0 a 1 be a finite dimensional contragredient lie superalgebra for any odd element x a 1 which satisfies x x 0 the duflo serganova functor dsx is defined by dsx a mod ax mod m 7 kermx xm where kermx xm is a module over the lie superalgebra ax a x x a here ax denotes the centralizer of x in a ds in what follows we set mx dsx m the duflo serganova functor dsx is a symmetric monoidal functor ds see also proposition 5 in ser it is known that the functor ds is not exact nevertheless it induces a homomorphism dsx between the reduced grothendieck groups of the categories a mod and ax mod defined by dsx m mx recall that reduced indicates passage to the quotient by the relation m m where is the parity reversing functor this follows from the following statement see section 1 1 in gs lemma 30 for every exact sequence of a modules 0 m 1 m 2 m 3 0 there exists an exact sequence of ax modules 0 e dsx m 1 dsx dsx m 2 dsx dsx m 3 e 0 for an appropriate ax module e proof set e ker dsx e coker dsx and consider the exact sequence 0 e dsx m 1 dsx m 2 dsx m 3 e 0 the odd morphism 1 x 1 dsx m 3 dsx m 1 induces an isomorphism e e in hr the existence of the homomorphism dsx was proven for finite dimensional modules remark 31 if 0 c 1 ck 0 is a complex of a modules with odd differentials the euler characteristic of this complex is defined as the element k i 1 ci in the reduced grothendieck group if hi denotes the i th cohomology group then k i 1 ci k i 1 hi the absence of the usual sign follows from the relation m m and the fact that the differentials are odd for example for an acyclic complex 0 x x 0 the euler characteristic is zero integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 19 let a gl m n and suppose rankx k then ax gl m k n k let o ind m n be the category whose objects are direct limits of objects in om n then by lemma 5 2 in cs the restriction of dsx to om n is a well defined functor dsx om n o ind m k n k lemma 32 the functor dsx o z m n oz m k n k ind commutes with translation functors proof recall that u is the natural gl m n module since ds is a monoidal functor we have a canonical isomorphism m u x mx ux moreover a direct computation shows that ux is isomorphic to the natural gl m k n k module we will use these observations to show that there is a canonical isomorphism 4 10 ei mx ei m x recall the notations of section 3 1 define the homomorphism of gl m n modules m n c gl m n gl m n 1 7 1 p xj xj yj we have dsx m n m k n k consider the composition m u 1 m n 1 m gl m n gl m n u rm lu m u where rm m gl m n m is the morphism of right action and lu gl m n u u is the morphism of left action the morphism dsx mx ux mx ux is defined in a similar manner in the category of gl m k n k modules recall that ei m v m u i nv 0 for some n 0 similarly ei mx v mx ux dsx i nv 0 for some n 0 this implies the existence of the isomorphism 4 10 as desired the proof for fi is similar we are going to strengthen the result of cs by proving the following proposition proposition 33 the restriction of dsx to om n is a well defined functor dsx om n om k n k to prove the proposition we first consider the case when k 1 lemma 34 if k 1 then the restriction of dsx to om n is a well defined functor dsx om n om 1 n 1 proof by theorem 5 1 in cs we may assume without loss of generality that x is a generator of the root space gl m n for some i j moreover we can choose a borel subalgebra b gl m n so that is a simple root let m be an object in the category om n and m denote the weight space of weight the set of all weights of m is denoted by suppm let x m m be the restriction of x as an operator on m then mx suppmm x where m x ker x x m integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 20 let us first check that all weight multiplicities of mx are finite with respect to the cartan subalgebra hx ker i ker j of gx we have to show that for any h x 4 11 suppm hx dimm x note that dimm x 6 0 implies 0 by sl 1 1 representation theory if 0 and hx hx then c denote by s the set of simple roots of b since m is an object of om n m has a finite filtration by highest weight modules therefore it suffices to consider the case when m is a highest weight module let be the highest weight of m then every suppm has the form s k for some k z 0 satisfying k 1 s k therefore for any suppm the set c suppm is finite hence for any h x the set of suppm such that hx and 0 is finite since all weight spaces of m are finite dimensional this implies 4 11 to finish the proof we observe that lemma 32 implies ei mx fi mx 0 for almost all i z now for each i supp at least one of the ei ei 1 fi fi 1 does not annihilate lgx together this implies that the set sm of all weights satisfying mx lgx 6 0 is a finite set on the other hand since mx has finite weight multiplicities every simple constituent occurs in mx with finite multiplicity hence mx has finite length proof now we prove proposition 33 by induction on rank x k by theorem 5 1 in cs x is b 0 conjugate to x 1 xk where xi gl m n i for some linearly independent set of mutually orthogonal odd roots 1 k so without loss of generality we may suppose that x x 1 xk let y x 1 xk 1 choose hy hxk and hxk hy such that hy hxk z for all roots of gl m n hy y y and hxk xk xk assume that m om n and suppm q where q is the root lattice then adhy hy and ad hxk hxk define a z z grading on m and the differentials y and xk form a bicomplex moreover mx is nothing but the cohomology r hr y xk m of the total complex consider the second term e p q 2 m h p xk h q y m of the spectral sequence of this bicomplex by the induction assumption my om k 1 n k 1 and in particular hq y m 6 0 for finitely many q the induction assumption implies that hp xk h q y m om k n k does not vanish for finitely many p this yields p q e p q 2 m om k n k since r hr y xk m is a subquotient of p q e p q 2 m we obtain mx r hr y xk m om k n k next note that the restriction of dsx to o z m n is a well defined functor ozm n o z m k n k since dsx is a well defined functor from o z m n to oz m k n k we see that dsx km n km k n k is a well defined group homomorphism lemma 35 if x x 1 xk with commuting x 1 xk of rank 1 then on km n we have the identity dsx dsxk dsx 1 integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 21 proof we retain the notation of the proof of proposition 33 clearly it suffices to check that dsx dsxk dsy where y x 1 xk 1 the euler characteristic of the es terms of the spectral sequence from the proof of proposition 33 remains unchanged for s 2 p q e p q 2 m p q ep qs m as the spectral sequence converges to mx we obtain dsxk dsy m p q e p q 2 m mx dsx m for the category of finite dimensional modules the above statement is proven in hr proposition 36 the complexification dsx km n km k n k is a homomorphism of sl modules as is its restriction dsx jm n jm k n k to the sl submodule jm n jm n zc proof this follows from the fact that the duflo serganova functor commutes with translation functors see lemma 32 remark 37 note that in hr the ring jm n is denoted by jg where g gl m n let xa x a 1 x x 0 and let 4 12 ba b iso b 1 k i j 0 i 6 j be the set of subsets of linearly independent mutually orthogonal isotropic roots of a then the orbits of the action of the adjoint group g 0 of a 0 on xa are in one to one correspondence with the orbits of the weyl group w of a 0 on ba via the correspondence 4 13 b 1 k 7 x x 1 x k xa where each x i a i is chosen to be nonzero ds theorem 4 2 lemma 38 let a gl m n fix x xa and set k bx where bx ba corresponds to x the homomorphism dsx jm n jm k n k depends only k and not on x proof this follows from the description of dsx given in hr theorem 10 using the fact that supercharacters of finite dimensional modules are invariant under the weyl group w sm sn of gl m n if b 1 b 2 b with b 1 b 2 then there exists w w satisfying w b 1 if and only if b 2 so if f jm n we have that dsx 1 f f 11 1 k 0 w f w 11 w 1 k 0 w f 2 1 2 k 0 f 2 1 2 k 0 dsx 2 f note that lemma 38 does not hold if we replace jm n with km n remark 39 since the homomorphism dsx jm n jm k n k does not depend on x we denote it by dsk where bx k and we let ds ds 1 now we introduce a filtration of an sl module m whose layers are tensor modules integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 22 definition 40 the tensor filtration of an sl module m is defined inductively by tens 0 m tensm g g m tens i m p 1 i tens m tens i 1 m where pi m m tens i 1 m is the natural projection we also use the notation tens i m tensim tensi 1 m note that tensm is the maximal tensor submodule of m example 41 the socle of j 1 1 is isomorphic to the adjoint module of sl and soc 1 j 1 1 c c note that this is a special case of example 21 in the case that k has two infinite blocks consider now the tensor filtration of j 1 1 this filtration also has length 2 tens j 1 1 1 1 v v and tens 1 j 1 1 c the module j 1 1 admits a nice matrix realization indeed we can identify the sl module 1 1 with the matrix realization of gl see section 3 1 and then extend it by the diagonal matrix d which has entries dii 1 for i 1 and 0 elsewhere the action of sl in this realization of j 1 1 is the adjoint action proposition 42 for each k let dsk jm n jm k n k be the homomorphism induced by the duflo serganova functor see remark 39 set t 1 min m n and let mtk ker ds k consider the filtration of sl modules m t 1 m t 2 m t t jm n then mt 1 m n and m t k 1 m t k m kv n kv this filtration is the tensor filtration of jm n that is tens k 1 jm n ker ds k proof in the proof we let m and n vary it follows from hr theorems 17 and 20 that for every m n z 0 the map ds jm n jm 1 n 1 is surjective and the kernel is spanned by the classes of kac modules so we have an exact sequence of sl modules 0 m n jm n ds jm 1 n 1 0 thus we obtain the following diagram of sl modules for each l m n in which the horizontal arrows represent the map ds m 55 m 4 4 m 3 3 m 2 2 m 1 1 m 54 m 4 3 m 3 2 m 2 1 0 m 53 m 4 2 m 3 1 0 m 52 m 4 1 0 m 51 0 by induction we get mtk 1 m t k m t k 1 m k n k and by b m k n k m kv n kv hence the first claim follows for the second claim suppose for sake of contradiction that for some k the module mtk 1 m t k is not the maximal tensor submodule of jm n m t k by projecting to jm k n k we obtain that mt 1 is not the maximal tensor submodule of jm n for some m n since integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 23 mt 1 m n mv nv is injective in the category tg dps this implies that socjm n is larger than socmt 1 which is a contradiction since socjm n soc m n pm n in the rest of this subsection we fix x to be a generator of the root space corresponding to j i we denote by dsij km n km 1 n 1 the sl module homomorphism dsx proposition 43 we have i j ker dsij tm n proof it follows from hr that dsij m 0 if and only if e i e j divides the supercharacter schm of m hence m lies in the intersection of kernels of all dsij if and only if i j e i e j divides schm this means that schm is a linear combination of supercharacters induced from the parabolic subalgebra gl m n 0 gl m n 1 therefore schm is a linear combination of supercharacters of verma modules proposition 44 we have tenskm n tm n moreover km n has an exhausting tensor filtration of length min m n 1 proof obviously tenskm n tm n assume that tenskm n 6 tm n then since tm n is injective in tg the socle of tenskm n is larger than the socle of tm n but this is a contradiction since soctm n sockm n the second claim can be proven by induction on min m n since km n tm n is isomorphic to a submodule of k mn m 1 n 1 via the map ijdsij 4 5 meaning of the socle filtration now we will define a filtration on the category oz m n for a gl m n module m let xm x xgl m n dsx m 6 0 and let xk gl m n be the subset of all elements in xgl m n of rank less than or equal to k we define oz m n k to be the full subcategory of oz m n consisting of all modules m such that xm x k gl m n note that oz m n k is not an abelian category furthermore we define oz m n k to be the full subcategory of oz m n consisting of all modules m such that xm gl m n 1 x k gl m n let kk m n denote the complexification of the subgroup in km n generated by the classes of modules lying in oz m n k and let kk m n be defined similarly for the category o z m n k since both categories are invariant under the functors ei and fi both k k m n and kk m n are sl submodules of km n conjecture 45 kk m n soc k 1 km n and k k m n tens k 1 km n here we prove a weaker statement recall that oz m n has block decomposition ozm n ozm n where oz m n is the subcategory of modules admitting generalized central character the complexified reduced grothendieck group of oz m n coincides with the weight sub space km n the degree of atypicality of is defined in ds in cs it is proven that oz m n o z m n k if the degree of atypicality of is not greater than k note that the integrable sl modules and category o for gl m n 24 degree of atypicality of the highest weight of the irreducible sl module v is equal to m n and the degree of atypicality of any weight of v is not less than the degree of atypicality of the highest weight combining this observation with the description of the socle filtration of km n we obtain the following proposition 46 sock 1 km n is the submodule in km n generated by weight vectors of weights with degree of atypicality less or equal to k therefore we have sock 1 km n k k m n 5 appendix in this section we prove the technical lemma used in lemma 25 which in turn is needed for the proof of theorem 24 consider decompositions v w 1 w 2 and v w 1 w 2 such that w 1 w 2 and w 2 w 1 denote by s the subalgebra sl w 1 of g let tm n v m v n and let ym n be the intersection with tm n of the ideal generated by w 1 w 1 in the tensor algebra t v v then tm n considered as an s module admits the decomposition resstm n w m 2 w 2 n ym n lemma 47 we have soctm n ym n sym n proof note that ym n is an object of t s and 5 1 sym n homs ym n c ker let denote a map from 1 m n to 1 2 denote by t m n the subspace of tm n spanned by v 1 vm um 1 um n with vi w i and uj w j clearly resstm n t m n and we have an s module isomorphism t m n w p 1 w m p 2 w 1 q w 2 n q where p 1 1 1 m q 1 1 m 1 m n furthermore ym n p q 0 t m n recall from pstyr theorem 2 1 that soctm n 1 i m m j m n ker ij where

homogeneous elements by uj vi wr uj vi if uj vi wr 0 otherwise next recall from dps that homs w p 1 w 1 q c 0 if p 6 q and if p q is spanned by compositions of contractions w 11 j 1 w 1 p jp for all possible permutations j 1 jp using 5 1 we can conclude that sy m n y m n if p 6 q whereas if p p q we have sy m n i 1 ip j 1 jp 1 1 ker w 1 i 1 j 1 w 1 ip jp observe that 5 2 ij w 1 ij w 2 ij we claim that if y y ym n and ij y 0 for all i j then y st m n for all the statement is trivial for every such that p 6 q now we proceed to prove the claim in the case p q p by induction on p let p 1 and consider with p 1 q let i m and j m be such that i j 1 note that i j y w m 1 2 w 2 n 1 and for 6 we have i j y ym 1 n 1 therefore i j y w 1 i j y 0 and hence y st m n now consider y such that p p q let i 1 ip m and j 1 jp m such that i j 1 we would like to show that 5 3 w 1 i 1 j 1 w 1 ip jp y i 1 j 1 ip jp y 0 note that has the property 5 4 i 1 j 1 ip jp y w m p 2 w 2 n p suppose that also has
