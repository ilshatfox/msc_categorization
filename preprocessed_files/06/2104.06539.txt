submitted a paper on congruence lattices of finite lattices to a journal the referee expressed surprise that i have more to say on this topic after all i published a whole book on the subject this second edition will attest to the fact the we indeed have a lot more to say on this subject in fact we have hardly started the new topics include the minimal representation theorem for rectangular lattices a combina torial result see chapter 11 this is joint work with e knapp a new field investigating the ordered set princk of principal congruences of a lattice k see part vi i started this field it was continued by g cze dli and myself congruences and prime intervals a field concerned with the congruence structure of finite lattices especially of sps lattices see part vii for sps lattices this field was started by g cze dli the results are due to him and myself part i has been extended to also provide an introduction to the new topics ltf refers to the book lattice theory foundation 62 and lts 1 to the book lattice theory special topics and applications volume 1 152 we use now the notation as in ltf in particular the functional notation for maps and bold greek letters for congruences this introduced 0 incorrect formulas and diagrams i think i have been able to catch 99 of the errors however if you find a map difficult to figure out just change it to i would like to thank all those who sent me corrections especially g cze dli k kaarli h lakser r padmanabhan and f wehrung note all the unpublished papers in the references can be found in the researchgate website researchgate net introduction the topic of this book congruences of finite lattices naturally splits into three fields of research congruence lattices of finite lattices the ordered set of principal congruences of finite lattices the congruence structure of finite lattices congruence lattices of finite lattices this is the major topic of this book it covers over 70 years of research and almost 200 papers the congruences of a finite lattice l form a lattice called the congruence lattice of l denoted by conl according to a 1942 result of n funayama and t nakayama 53 the lattice conl is a finite distributive lattice the converse is a result of r p dilworth from 1944 see 11 dilworth theorem every finite distributive lattice d can be represented as the congruence lattice of a finite lattice l this result was not published until 1962 see g gra tzer and e t schmidt 117 in the almost 60 years since the discovery of this result a large number of papers have been published strengthening and generalizing the dilworth theorem these papers form two distinct fields i representation theorems of finite distributive lattices as congruence lattices of lattices with special properties ii the congruence lattice problem clp can congruence lattices of lattices be characterized as distributive algebraic lattices xxii introduction a nontrivial finite distributive lattice d is determined by the ordered set j d of join irreducible elements so a representation of d as the congruence lattice of a finite lattice l is really a representation of a finite ordered set p j d as the ordered set conj l of join irreducible congruences of a finite lattice l a join irreducible congruence of a nontrivial finite lattice l is exactly the same as a congruence of the form con a b where a b in l that is the smallest congruence collapsing a prime interval therefore it is enough to concentrate on such congruences and make sure that they are ordered as required by p the infinite case is much different there are really only two general positive results 1 the ideal lattice of a distributive lattice with zero is the congruence lattice of a lattice see e t schmidt 177 also p pudla k 168 2 any distributive algebraic lattice with at most 1 compact elements is the congruence lattice of a lattice a p huhn 159 and 160 see also h dobbertin 45 the big breakthrough for negative results came in 1999 in f wehrung 190 based on the results of f wehrung 189 this book deals with the finite case for a detailed review of the infinite case see f wehrung 192 194 chapter 7 9 of the book lts 1 the two types of representation theorems the basic representation theorems for the finite case are all of the same general type we represent a finite distributive lattice d as the congruence lattice of a nice finite lattice l for instance in the 1962 paper g gra tzer and e t schmidt 117 we already proved that the finite lattice l for the dilworth theorem can be constructed as a sectionally complemented lattice to understand the second more sophisticated type of representation theorem we need the concept of a congruence preserving extension let l be a lattice and let k be a sublattice of l in general there is not much connection between the congruence lattice of l and the congruence lattice of k if they happen to be naturally isomorphic we call l a congru ence preserving extension of k more formally see section 3 3 for sectionally complemented lattices the congruence preserving extension theorem was published in a 1999 paper g gra tzer and e t schmidt 129 every finite lattice k has a finite sectionally complemented congruence pre serving extension l it is difficult reading this for the first time to appreciate how much stronger this theorem is than the straight representation theorem while the 1962 theorem provides for a finite distributive lattice d a finite sectionally complemented lattice l whose congruence lattice is isomorphic to d the 1999 theorem starts with an arbitrary finite lattice k and builds a sectionally complemented lattice l extending it with the same congruence structure introduction xxiii the ordered set of principal congruences of a finite lattice a large part of this book investigates the congruence lattice conl of a finite lattice l but conl is not the only interesting congruence construct we can associate with a finite lattice l a new one is princl the ordered set of principal congruences of l we discuss this topic in part vi it turns out that only a tiny consequence of finiteness being bounded is of importance for this topic so we will phrase the results for bounded lattices we start discussing this new field in chapter 22 characterizing princk of a bounded lattice k as a bounded ordered set see g gra tzer 65 utilizing this result we prove in section 22 3 that for a bounded lattice 1 l the two related structures princl and autl are independent see g cze dli 28 if k and l are bounded lattices and is a bounded homomorphism 2 of k into l then there is a natural bounded isotone map of princk into princl the main result of chapter 23 is the converse every bounded isotone map of princk into princl can be so represented see g cze dli 26 27 and g gra tzer 75 77 congruence structure of finite lattices the spreading of a congruence from a prime interval to another prime interval involves intervals of arbitrary size can we describe such a spreading with prime intervals only we can indeed by introducing the concept of prime projectivity see sec tion 24 2 and obtaining prime projectivity lemma see g gra tzer 69 then in section 24 3 we develop much sharper forms of this result for sps slim planar semimodular lattices the main result is the swing lemma g gra tzer 70 from which we derive many of the known results of g cze dli and myself concerning congruences of sps lattices proof by picture in 1960 trying with e t schmidt to prove the dilworth theorem unpublished at the time we came up with the construction more or less as presented in section 8 2 in 1960 we did not anticipate the 1968 result of g gra tzer and h lakser 89 establishing that the construction of a chopped lattice solves the problem so we translated the chopped lattice construction to a closure space as in section 8 2 proved that the closed sets form a sectionally complemented lattice l and based on that we verified that the congruence lattice of l represents the given finite distributive lattice 1 a lattice is bounded if it has 0 and 1 see section 1 1 1 2 a homomorphism is bounded if it preserves 0 and 1 see section 1 3 1 xxiv introduction when we submitted the paper 117 for publication it had a three page section explaining the chopped lattice construction and its translation to a closure space the referee was strict you cannot have a three page explanation for a two page proof i believe that in the 50 plus years since the publication of that article few readers have developed an understanding of the idea behind the published proof the referee s dictum is quite in keeping with mathematical tradition and practice when mathematicians discuss new results they explain the construc tions and the ideas with examples when these same results are published the motivation and the examples are largely gone we publish definitions constructions and formal proofs and conjectures paul erdo s would have added tradition has it when gauss proved one of his famous results he was not ready to publicize it because the proof gave away too much as to how the theorem was discovered i have had my results for a long time but i do not yet know how i am to arrive at them gauss is quoted in a arber 3 i try to break with this tradition in this book in many chapters after stating the main result i include a section proof by picture this is a misnomer a proof by picture is not a proof the pythagorean theorem has many well known proofs by picture sometimes called visual proofs these are really proofs my proof by picture is an attempt to convey the idea of the proof i trust that if the idea is properly understood the reader should be able to provide the formal proof or should at least have less trouble reading it think of a proof by picture as a lecture to an informed audience concluding with the formal details now you can provide outline in the last paragraph i call an audience informed if they are familiar with the basic concepts and techniques of lattice theory part i provides this i am very selective as to what to include there are no proofs in this part with a few exceptions they are easy enough for the reader to work them out on his own for proofs lots of exercises and a more detailed exposition i refer the reader to my book ltf most of the research in this book deals with representation theorems lattices with certain properties are constructed with prescribed congruence structures the constructions are ad hoc nevertheless there are three basic techniques to prove representation theorems chopped lattices used in almost every chapter in parts iii v boolean triples used in chapters 12 14 and 18 and generalized in chapter 21 also used in some papers that did not make it in this book for instance g gra tzer and e t schmidt 131 introduction xxv cubic extensions used in most chapters of part iv these are presented in part ii with proofs actually there are two more basic techniques multi coloring and its recent variant quasi coloring see many recent papers of g cze dli is used in several relevant papers however it appears in the book only in chapter 19 so we introduce it there pruning is utilized in chapters 13 and 16 it would seem to qualify for part ii however there are only concrete uses of pruning there is no general theory to discuss in part ii part iii contains the representation theorems of congruence lattices of finite lattices requiring only chopped lattices from part ii i cover the following topics the dilworth theorem and the representation theorem for sectionally complemented lattices in chapter 8 g gra tzer and e t schmidt 117 p crawley and r p dilworth 13 see also 11 minimal representations in chapter 9 that is for a given j d we minimize the size of l representing the finite distributive lattice d g gra tzer h lakser and e t schmidt 102 g gra tzer rival and n zaguia 114 the semimodular representation theorem in chapter 10 g gra tzer h lakser and e t schmidt 105 another minimal representations in chapter 11 for rectangular lattices g gra tzer and e knapp 87 the representation theorem for modular lattices in chapter 12 e t schmidt 174 and g gra tzer and e t schmidt 134 we are forced to represent with a countable lattice l since the congruence lattice of a finite modular lattice is always boolean the representation theorem for uniform lattices that is lattices in which any two congruence classes of a congruence are of the same size in chapter 13 g gra tzer e t schmidt and k thomsen 141 part iv is mostly about congruence preserving extension i present the congruence preserving extension theorem for sectionally complemented lattices in chapter 14 g gra tzer and e t schmidt 129 semimodular lattices in chapter 15 g gra tzer and e t schmidt 132 isoform lattices that is lattices in which any two congruence classes of a congruence are isomorphic in chapter 16 g gra tzer r w quack enbush and e t schmidt 113 xxvi introduction these three constructions are based on cubic extensions introduced in part ii in chapter 17 i present the congruence preserving extension version of the baranski urquhart theorem v a baranski 4 5 and a urquhart 188 on the independence of the congruence lattice and the automorphism group of a finite lattice see g gra tzer and e t schmidt 126 finally in chapter 18 i discuss two congruence destroying extensions which we call magic wands g gra tzer and e t schmidt 135 g gra tzer m greenberg and e t schmidt 82 what happens if we consider the congruence lattices of two related lattices such as a lattice and a sublattice i take up three variants of this question in part v let l be a finite lattice and let k be a sublattice of l as we discuss it in section 3 3 there is a map ext from conk into conl for a congruence relation of k let the image ext be the congruence relation conl of l generated by the map ext is a 0 separating join homomorphism chapter 19 proves the converse a 1974 result of a p huhn 158 and a stronger form due to g gra tzer h lakser and e t schmidt 103 we deal with ideals in chapter 20 let k be an ideal of a lattice l then the restriction map re conl conk which assigns to a congruence of l the restriction ek of to k is a bounded homomorphism we prove the corresponding representation theorem for finite lattices g gra tzer and h lakser 90 we also prove two variants the first is by g gra tzer and h lakser 97 stating that this result also holds for sectionally complemented lattices the second is by g gra tzer and h lakser 95 stating that this result also holds for planar lattices the final chapter is a first contribution to the following class of problems let be a construction for finite lattices that is if d and e are finite lattices then so is d e find a construction of finite distributive lattices that is if k and l are finite distributive lattices then so is k l satisfying con k l conk conl if the lattice construction is the direct product the answer is obvious since con k l conk conl in chapter 21 we take up the construction defined as the distributive lattice of all isotone maps from j e to d in g gra tzer and m greenberg 78 we introduced another construction the tensor extension a b for nontrivial finite lattices a and b in chapter 21 we prove that con a b cona conb in 2013 i raised the question whether one can associate with a finite lattice l a structure of some of its congruences we could take the ordered set of the principal congruences generated by prime intervals but this is just conj l which is equivalent with conl see section 2 5 2 for an explanation we proposed to consider the ordered set princk of principal congruences of a lattice k in part vi we describe the first few results of this field introduction xxvii it turns out that the class of bounded not necessarily finite lattices is the natural setting for this topic the highlights include the representation theorem characterizing princk of a bounded lattice k as a bounded ordered set see chapter 22 g gra tzer 65 for a bounded lattice l the two related structures princl and autl are independent see section 22 3 g cze dli 28 see also g gra tzer 76 if k and l are bounded lattices and is a bounded homomorphism of k into l then there is a natural bounded isotone map of princk into princl the main result of chapter 23 is the converse every bounded isotone map of princk into princl can be so represented g cze dli 26 27 and g gra tzer 75 finally part vii deals with another new topic the congruence structure of finite lattices focusing on prime intervals and congruences the two main results are the prime projectivity lemma which verifies that indeed we can describe the spreading of a congruence from a prime interval to another prime interval involving only prime intervals see g gra tzer 69 the swing lemma a very strong form of the prime projectivity lemma for sps slim planar and semimodular lattice see g gra tzer 70 each chapter in parts iii v concludes with an extensive discussion section giving the background for the topic further results and open problems this book lists more than 80 open problems hoping to convince the reader that indeed we have hardly started there are almost 200 references and a detailed index this book is as much as possible visually oriented i cannot stress too much the use of diagrams as a major research tool in lattice theory i did not include in the book the list of figures because there is not much use to it it would list about 150 figures notation and terminology lattice theoretic terminology and notation evolved from the three editions of g birkhoff s lattice theory 10 by way of my books 54 57 59 60 ltf and r n mckenzie g f mcnulty and w f taylor 165 changing quite a bit in the process birkhoff s notation for the congruence lattice and ideal lattice of a lattice changed from l and i l to conl and idl respectively the advent of latex promoted the use of operators for lattice constructions i try to xxviii introduction be consistent i use an operator when a new structure is constructed so i use conl idl autl and so on without parentheses unless required for readability for instance j d and con idl i use functional notation when sets are constructed as in atom l and j a generated by uses the same letters as the corresponding lattice construction but starting with a lower case letter conl is the congruence lattice of l and con h is the congruence generated by h while idl is the ideal lattice of l and id h is the ideal generated by h new concepts introduced in more recent research papers exhibit the usual richness in notation and terminology i use this opportunity with the wisdom of hindsight to make their use more consistent the reader will often find different notation and terminology when reading the original papers the detailed table of notation and index may help in combinatorial results i will use landau s big o notation for the functions f and g we write f o g to mean that f c g for a suitable constant c natural numbers start at 1 toronto ontario george gra tzer summer 2016 homepage http www maths umanitoba ca homepages gratzer html part i a brief introduction to lattices 1 c h a p t e r 1 basic concepts in this chapter we introduce the most basic order theoretic concepts ordered sets lattices diagrams and the most basic algebraic concepts sublattices congruences products 1 1 ordering 1 1 1 ordered sets a binary relation on a nonempty set a is a subset of a 2 that is a set of ordered pairs a b with a b a for a b we will write a b or a b mod a binary relation on a set p is called an ordering if it is reflexive a a for all a p antisymmetric a b and b a imply that a b for all a b p and transitive a b and b c imply that a c for all a b c p an ordered set p consists of a nonempty set p and an ordering a b means that a b and a 6 b we also use the inverse relations a b defined as b a and a b for b a if more than one ordering is being considered we write p for the ordering of p on the other hand if the ordering is understood we will say that p rather than p is an ordered set an ordered set p is trivial if p has only one element the elements a and b of the ordered set p are comparable if a b or b a otherwise a and b are incomparable in notation a b let h p and a p then a is an upper bound of h iff h a for all h h an upper bound a of h is the least upper bound of h iff a b for any upper bound b of h in this case we will write a h if a h exists 3 4 1 basic concepts then it is unique by definition exist is the empty set iff p has a smallest element zero denoted by 0 the concepts of lower bound and greatest lower bound are similarly defined the latter is denoted by h note that exists iff p has a largest element unit denoted by 1 a bounded ordered set is one that has both 0 and 1 we often denote the 0 and 1 of p by 0 p and 1 p the notation h and h will also be used for families of elements the adverb similarly in similarly defined in the previous paragraph can be given concrete meaning let p be an ordered set then p is also an ordered set called the dual of p the dual of the ordered set p will be denoted by p d now if is a statement about ordered sets and if in we replace all occurrences of by then we get the dual of duality principle for ordered sets if a statement is true for all ordered sets then its dual is also true for all ordered sets for a b p if a is an upper bound of b then a is an upper bound of b if for all a b p the set a b has an upper bound then the ordered set p is directed a chain linearly ordered set totally ordered set is an ordered set with no incomparable elements an antichain is one in which a b for all a 6 b let p be an ordered set and let q be a nonempty subset of p then there is a natural ordering q on q induced by for a b q let a q b iff a b we call q q or simply q or even simpler q an ordered subset or suborder of p a chain c in an ordered set p is a nonempty subset which as a suborder is a chain an antichain c in an ordered set p is a nonempty subset which as a suborder is an antichain the length of a finite chain c lengthc is c 1 an ordered set p is said to be of length n in formula lengthp n where n is a natural number iff there is a chain in p of length n and all chains in p are of length n the ordered sets p and q are isomorphic in formula p q and the map p q is an isomorphism iff is one to one and onto and a b in p iff a b in q let cn denote the set 0 n 1 ordered by 0 1 2 n 1 then cn is an n element chain observe that lengthcn n 1 if c x 0 xn 1 is an n element chain and x 0 x 1 xn 1 then i 7 xi is an isomorphism between cn and c therefore the n element chain is unique up to isomorphism let bn denote the set of all subsets of the set 0 n 1 ordered by con tainment observe that the ordered set bn has 2 n elements and lengthbn n 1 1 ordering 5 in general for a set x we denote by powx the power set of x that is the set of all subsets of x ordered by set inclusion for an ordered set p call a p a down set iff x a and y x in p imply that y a for h p there is a smallest down set containing h namely x x h for some h h we use the notation h for this set if h a we write a for a let downp denote the set of all down sets ordered by set inclusion if p is an antichain then downp bn where n p the map p q is an isotone map resp antitone map of the ordered set p into the ordered set q iff a b in p implies that a b resp a b in q then p is a suborder of q even if is one to one the ordered sets p and p need not be isomorphic if both p and q are bounded then the map p q is bounded or a bounded map if it preserves the bounds that is 0 p 0 q and 1 p 1 q most often we talk about bounded isotone maps and bounded homomorphisms see section 1 3 1 1 1 2 diagrams in the ordered set p the element a is covered by b or b covers a in formula a b or b a iff a b and a x b for no x p the binary relation is called the covering relation the covering determines the ordering let p be a finite ordered set then a b iff a b or if there exists a finite sequence of elements x 1 x 2 xn such that a x 1 x 2 xn b a diagram of an ordered set p represents the elements with small circles the circles representing two elements x y are connected by a line segment iff one covers the other if x is covered by y then the circle representing x is placed lower than the circle representing y the diagram of a finite ordered set determines the order up to isomorphism in a diagram the intersection of two line segments does not indicate an element a diagram is planar if no two line segments intersect an ordered set p is planar if it has a diagram that is planar figure 1 1 shows three diagrams of the same ordered set p since the third diagram is planar p is a planar ordered set 1 1 3 constructions of ordered sets given the ordered sets p and q we can form the direct product p q consisting of all ordered pairs x 1 x 2 with x 1 p and x 2 q ordered componentwise that is x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 iff x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 if p q then we write p 2 for p q similarly we use the notation pn for pn 1 p 6 1 basic concepts for n 2 figure 1 2 shows a diagram of c 2 p where p is the ordered set with diagrams in figure 1 1 figure 1 1 three diagrams of an ordered set figure 1 2 a diagram of c 2 p figure 1 3 diagrams of c 2 p p c 2 and p u c 2 another often used construction is the ordinal sum p q of p and q defined on the disjoint union p q and ordered as follows x y iff x p y for x y p x q y for x y q x p y q figure 1 3 shows diagrams of c 2 p and p c 2 where p is the ordered 1 1 ordering 7 set with diagrams in figure 1 1 in both diagrams the elements of c 2 are black filled figure 1 3 also shows the diagram of p u c 2 a variant construction is the glued sum p uq applied to an ordered set p with largest element 1 p and an ordered set q with smallest element 0 q then p uq is p q in which 1 p and 0 q are identified that is 1 p 0 q in p uq 1 1 4 partitions we now give a nontrivial example of an ordered set a partition of a nonempty set a is a set of nonempty pairwise disjoint subsets of a whose union is a the members of are called the blocks of the block containing a a will be denoted by a a singleton as a block is called trivial if the elements a and b of a belong to the same block we write a b mod or a b or a b in general for h a h a a h a collection of blocks an equivalence relation on the set a is a reflexive symmetric a b implies that b a for all a b a and transitive binary relation given a partition we can define an equivalence relation by x y iff x y conversely if is an equivalence relation then a a a is a partition of a there is a one to one correspondence between partitions and equivalence relations we will use the two terms interchangeably parta will denote the set of all partitions of a ordered by 1 2 iff x y mod 1 implies that x y mod 2 we draw a picture of a partition by drawing the boundary lines of the non trivial blocks then 1 2 iff the boundary lines of 2 are also boundary lines of 1 but 1 may have some more boundary lines equivalently the blocks of 2 are unions of blocks of 1 see figure 1 4 2 and a 1 2 1 figure 1 4 drawing a partition 8 1 basic concepts parta has a zero and a unit denoted by 0 and 1 respectively defined by x y mod 0 iff x y x y mod 1 for all x y a figure 1 5 shows the diagrams of parta for a 4 the partitions are labeled by listing the nontrivial blocks 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 2 4 3 4 1 2 4 1 3 4 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 3 2 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 1 3 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 part 1 part 1 2 part 1 2 3 part 1 2 3 4 0 1 0 1 0 1 figure 1 5 parta for a 4 a preordered set is a nonempty set q with a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive let us define the binary relation a b on q as a b and b a then is an equivalence relation define the set p as q and on p define the binary relation a b iff a b in q it is easy to see that the definition of on p is well defined and that p is an ordered set we will call p the ordered set associated with the preordered set q 1 2 lattices and semilattices 9 starting with a binary relation on the set q we can define the reflexive transitive closure of by the formula for a b q let a b iff a b or if a x 0 x 1 xn b for elements x 1 xn 1 q then is a preordering on q a cycle on q is a sequence x 1 xn q satisfying x 1 x 2 xn x 1 n 1 the preordering is an ordering iff there are no cycles 1 2 lattices and semilattices 1 2 1 lattices we need two basic concepts from universal algebra an n ary operation on a nonempty set a is a map from an to a for n 2 we call the operation binary an algebra is a nonempty set a with operations defined on a an ordered set l is a lattice if a b and a b exist for all a b l a lattice l is trivial if it has only one element otherwise it is nontrivial we will use the notations a b a b a b a b and call the join and the meet they are both binary operations that are idempotent a a a and a a a commutative a b b a and a b b a associative a b c a b c and a b c a b c and absorptive a a b a and a a b a these properties of the operations are also called the idempotent identities commutative identities associative identities and absorption identities respectively identities in general are introduced in section 2 3 as always in algebra associativity makes it possible to write a 1 a 2 an without using parentheses and the same for for instance for a b powx we have a b a b and a b a b so powx is a lattice for parta if we regard and as equivalence relations then the meet formula is trivial but the formula for joins is a bit more complicated x y mod iff there is a sequence x z 0 z 1 zn y of elements of a such that zi zi 1 mod or zi zi 1 mod for 0 i n so parta is a lattice it is called the partition lattice on a for an ordered set p the order downp is a lattice a b a b and a b a b for a b downp to treat lattices as algebras define an algebra l a lattice iff l is a nonempty set and are binary operations on l both and are 10 1 basic concepts idempotent commutative and associative and they satisfy the two absorp tion identities a lattice as an algebra and a lattice as an ordered set are equivalent concepts let the order l l be a lattice then the algebra la l is a lattice conversely let the algebra l l be a lattice define a b iff a b b then lp l is an ordered set and the ordered set lp is a lattice for an ordered set l that is a lattice we have lap l for an algebra l that is a lattice we have lpa l note that for lattices as algebras the duality principle takes on the following very simple form duality principle for lattices let be a statement about lattices ex pressed in terms of and the dual of is the statement we get from by interchanging and if is true for all lattices then the dual of is also true for all lattices if the operations are understood we will say that l rather than l is a lattice the dual of the lattice l will be denoted by ld the ordered set ld is also a lattice a finite lattice l is planar if it is planar as an ordered set see section 1 1 2 we have quite a bit of flexibility to construct a planar diagram for an ordered set but for a lattice we are much more constrained because l has a zero which must be the lowest element and a unit which must be the highest element contrast this with figure 1 1 all lattices with five or fewer elements are planar all but the five chains are shown in the first two rows of figure 1 6 the third row of figure 1 6 provides an example of good and bad lattice diagrams the two diagrams represent the same lattice c 23 planar diagrams are the best diagrams in which meets and joins are hard to figure out are not of much value in the last row of figure 1 6 there are two more diagrams the one on the left is not planar nevertheless it is very easy to work with joins and meets are easy to see the notation m 3 c 3 will be explained in section 6 1 the one on the right is not a lattice the two black filled elements have no join in this book we deal almost exclusively with finite lattices some concepts however are more natural to introduce in a more general context an ordered set l is a complete lattice if x and x exist for all x l all finite lattices are complete of course 1 2 2 semilattices and closure systems a semilattice s is an algebra a nonempty set s with an idempotent commutative and associative binary operation a join semilattice s is a structure where s is a semilattice s is an ordered set and a b iff a b b in the ordered set s we have a b a b as conventional we write s for s or just s if the operation is understood 1 2 lattices and semilattices 11 i o a b c i o a b c b 2 c 1 b 2 b 2 c 1 n 5 m 3 c 32 m 3 c 3 figure 1 6 more diagrams 12 1 basic concepts similarly a meet semilattice s is a structure where s is a semi lattice s is an ordered set and a b iff a b a in the ordered set s we have a b a b as conventional we write s for s or just s if the operation is understood if l is a lattice then l is a join semilattice and l is a meet semilattice moreover the orderings agree the converse also holds let l be a lattice and let c be a nonempty subset of l with the property that for every x l there is a smallest element x of c with x x we call c a closure system in l and x the closure of x in c obviously c as an ordered subset of l is a lattice for x y c the meet in c is the same as the meet in l and the join is x c y x l y let l be a complete lattice and let c be closed subset of l that is if x c then x c since 1 such a subset is nonempty and contains the 1 of l then c is a closure system in l and for every x l x y c x y 1 3 some algebraic concepts 1 3 1 homomorphisms the lattices l 1 l 1 and l 2 l 2 are isomorphic as algebras in symbols l 1 l 2 and the map l 1 l 2 is an isomorphism iff is one to one and onto and a b a b 1 a b a b 2 for a b l 1 a map in general and a homomorphism in particular is called injective if it is onto surjective if it is one to one and bijective if it is one to one and onto an isomorphism of a lattice with itself is called an automorphism the automorphisms of a lattice l form a group autl under composition a lattice l is rigid if the identity map is the only automorphism of l that is if autl is the one element group it is easy to see that two lattices are isomorphic as ordered sets iff they are isomorphic as algebras let us define a homomorphism of the join semilattice s 1 into the join semilattice s 2 as a map s 1 s 2 satisfying 1 similarly for meet semi lattices we require 2 a lattice homomorphism or simply homomorphism of the lattice l 1 into the lattice l 2 is a map of l 1 into l 2 satisfying both 1 1 3 some algebraic concepts 13 and 2 a homomorphism of a lattice into itself is called an endomorphism a one to one homomorphism will also be called an embedding note that meet homomorphisms join homomorphisms and lattice homo morphisms are all isotone figure 1 7 morphisms figure 1 7 shows three maps of the four element lattice b 2 into the three element chain c 3 the first map is isotone but it is neither a meet nor a join homomorphism the second map is a join homomorphism but is not a meet homomorphism thus not a homomorphism the third map is a lattice homomorphism various versions of homomorphisms and embeddings will be used for in stance for lattices and join semilattices there are also 0 homomorphism and so on with obvious meanings an onto homomorphism is also called surjective while a one to one homomorphism is called injective it is the same as an embedding for bounded lattices we often use bounded homo morphisms and bounded embeddings that is 0 1 homomorphisms and 0 1 embeddings in the literature bounded homomorphisms sometimes have a different definition this is unlikely to cause any confusion it should always be clear from the context what kind of homomorphism we are considering if we say let be a homomorphism of k into l where k and l are lattices then is a lattice homomorphism unless otherwise stated 1 3 2 sublattices a sublattice k of the lattice l is defined on a nonempty subset k of l with the property that a b k implies that a b a b k the operations are formed in l and the and the of k are restrictions to k of the and the of l respectively instead of k is a sublattice of l we will simply say that k is a sublattice of l in symbols k l of course a sublattice of a lattice is again a lattice if k is a sublattice of l then we call l an extension of k in symbols l k for every h l h 6 there is a smallest sublattice sub h l containing h called the sublattice of l generated by h we say that h is a generating set of sub h for a bounded lattice l the sublattice k is bounded also called a 0 1 sublattice if the 0 and 1 of l are in k similarly we can define a 0 sublattice 14 1 basic concepts bounded extension and so on the subset k of the lattice l is called convex iff a b k c l and a c b imply that c k we can add the adjective convex to sublattices extensions and embeddings a sublattice k of the lattice l is convex if it a convex subset of l let l be an extension of k then l is a convex extension if k is a convex sublattice an embedding is convex if the image is a convex sublattice for a b l a b the interval i a b x a x b is an important example of a convex sublattice we will use the notation 1 i for the largest element of i that is b and 0 i for the smallest element of i that is a an interval a b is trivial if a b the smallest nontrivial intervals are called prime that is a b is prime iff a b another important example of a convex sublattice is an ideal a nonempty subset i of l is an ideal iff it is a down set with the property id a b i implies that a b i an ideal i of l is proper if i 6 l since the intersection of any number of ideals is an ideal unless empty we can define id h the ideal generated by a subset h of the lattice l provided that h 6 if h a we write id a for id a and call it a principal ideal obviously id a x x a a so instead of id a we could use a many do who work in categorical aspects of lattice theory and use id for the identity map the set idl of all ideals of l is an ordered set under set inclusion and as an ordered set it is a lattice in fact for i j idl the lattice operations in idl are i j id i j and i j i j so we obtain the formula for the ideal join x i j iff x i j for some i i j j we call idl the ideal lattice of l now observe the formulas id a id b id a b id a id b id a b since a 6 b implies that id a 6 id b these yield the map a 7 id a embeds l into idl since the definition of an ideal uses only and it applies to any join semilattice s the ordered set ids is a join semilattice and the same join formula holds as the one for lattices since the intersection of two ideals could be empty ids is not a lattice in general however for a 0 semilattice a join semilattice with zero ids is a lattice 1 3 some algebraic concepts 15 for lattices join semilattices s and t let s t be an embedding we call an ideal embedding if s is an ideal of t then of course for any ideal i of s we have that i is an ideal of t ideal embeddings play a major role in chapter 20 by dualizing we get the concepts of filter fil h the filter generated by a subset h of the lattice l provided that h 6 principal filter fil a and so on 1 3 3 congruences an equivalence relation on a lattice l is called a congruence relation or congruence of l iff a b mod and c d mod imply that a c b d mod sp a c b d mod sp substitution properties trivial examples are the relations 0 and 1 introduced in section 1 1 4 as in section 1 1 4 for a l we write a for the congruence class congruence block containing a observe that a is a convex sublattice if l is a lattice k l and a congruence on l then ek the restriction of to k is a congruence of k formally for x y k x y mod ek iff x y mod in l we call discrete on k if ek 0 sometimes it is tedious to compute that a binary relation is a congruence relation such computations are often facilitated by the following result g gra tzer and e t schmidt 116 and f maeda 164 referred to as the technical lemma in the literature lemma 1 1 a reflexive binary relation on a lattice l is a congruence relation iff the following three properties are satisfied for x y z t l i x y mod iff x y x y mod ii x y z x y mod and y z mod imply that x z mod iii x y and x y mod imply that x t y t mod and x t y t mod let conl denote the set of all congruence relations on l ordered by set inclusion remember that we can view conl as a subset of l 2 we use the technical lemma to prove the following result 16 1 basic concepts theorem 1 2 conl is a lattice for conl the join can be described as follows x y mod iff there is a sequence x y z 0 z 1 zn x y of elements of l such that zi zi 1 mod or zi zi 1 mod for every i with 0 i n remark for the binary relations and on a set a we define the binary relation the product of and as follows for a b a the relation a b holds iff a x and x b for some x a the relation is formed by repeated products theorem 1 2 strengthens this statement the integer n in theorem 1 2 can be restricted for some congruence joins we call the congruences and permutable if a lattice l is congruence permutable if any pair of congruences of l are permutable the chain cn is congruence permutable iff n 2 conl is called the congruence lattice of l observe that conl is a sublattice of partl that is the join and meet of congruence relations as congruence relations and as equivalence relations partitions coincide if l is nontrivial then conl contains the two element sublattice 0 1 if conl 0 1 we call the lattice l simple all the nontrivial lattices of figure 1 5 are simple of the many lattices of figure 1 6 only m 3 is simple given a b l there is a smallest congruence con a b called a principal congruence under which a b the formula 3 con a b a b mod is trivial but important for h l the smallest congruence under which h is in one class is formed as con h con a b a b h homomorphisms and congruence relations express two sides of the same phenomenon let l be a lattice and let be a congruence relation on l let l a a l define and on l by a b a b and a b a b the lattice axioms are easily verified the lattice l is the quotient lattice of l modulo lemma 1 3 the map x 7 x for x l is a homomorphism of l onto l 1 3 some algebraic concepts 17 the lattice k is a homomorphic image of the lattice l iff there is a homomorphism of l onto k theorem 1 4 illustrated in figure 1 8 states that any quotient lattice is a homomorphic image to state it we need one more concept let l l 1 be a homomorphism of the lattice l into the lattice l 1 and define the binary relation on l by x y iff x y the relation is a congruence relation of l called the kernel of in notation ker theorem 1 4 homomorphism theorem let l be a lattice any homomor phic image of l is isomorphic to a suitable quotient lattice of l in fact if l l 1 is a homomorphism of l onto l 1 and is the kernel of then l l 1 an isomorphism see figure 1 8 is given by x 7 x for x l onto l l 1 l x 7 x x 7 x figure 1 8 the homomorphism theorem we also know the congruence lattice of a homomorphic image theorem 1 5 second isomorphism theorem let l be a lattice and let be a congruence relation of l for any congruence of l such that define the relation on l by x y mod iff x y mod then is a congruence of l conversely every congruence of l can be uniquely represented in the form for some congruence of l in particular the congruence lattice of l is isomorphic with the interval 1 of the congruence lattice of l let l be a bounded lattice a congruence of l separates 0 if 0 0 that is x 0 mod implies that x 0 similarly a congruence of l separates 1 if 1 1 that is x 1 mod implies that x 1 we call the lattice l non separating if 0 and 1 are not separated by any congruence 6 0 similarly a homomorphism of the lattices l 1 and l 2 with zero is 0 separating if 0 0 but x 6 0 for x 6 0 c h a p t e r 2 special concepts in this chapter we introduce special elements constructions and classes of lattices that play an important role in the representation of finite distributive lattices as congruence lattices of finite lattices 2 1 elements and lattices in a nontrivial finite lattice l an element a is join reducible if a 0 or if a b c for some b a and c a otherwise it is join irreducible let j l denote the set of all join irreducible elements of l regarded as an ordered set under the ordering of l by definition 0 j l for a l set j a x x a x j l id a j l that is j a is a formed in j l note that by definition 0 is not a join irreducible element and similarly 1 is not a meet irreducible element in a finite lattice every element is a join of join irreducible elements indeed a j a and similarly for meets dually we define meet reducible and meet irreducible elements an element a is an atom if 0 a and a dual atom if a 1 atoms are join irreducible a lattice l is atomistic if every element is a finite join of atoms in a bounded lattice l the element a is a complement of the element b iff a b 0 and a b 1 a complemented lattice is a bounded lattice in which every element has a complement the lattices of figure 1 5 are complemented and so are all but one of the lattices of figure 1 6 the lattice bn is complemented 19 20 2 special concepts figure 2 1 the lattices n 5 and n 6 let a b c the element x is a relative complement of a in b c iff a x b and a x c a relatively complemented lattice is a lattice in which every element has a relative complement in any interval containing it the lattice n 5 of figure 2 1 is complemented but not relatively complemented in a lattice l with zero let a b a complement of a in 0 b is called a sectional complement of a in b a lattice l with zero is called sectionally com plemented if a has a sectional complement in b for all a b in l the lattice n 6 of figure 2 1 is sectionally complemented but not relatively complemented 2 2 direct and subdirect products let l and k be lattices and form the direct product l k as in section 1 1 3 then l k is a lattice and and are computed componentwise a b c d a c b d a b c d a c b d see figure 2 2 for the example c 2 n 5 obviously bn is isomorphic to a direct product of n copies of b 1 there are two projection maps homomorphisms associated with this construction l l k l and k l k k defined by l x y 7 x and by k x y 7 y respectively similarly we can form the direct product l 1 ln with elements x 1 xn where xi li for i n we denote the projection map x 1 xi xn 7 xi by i if li l for all i n we get the direct power ln by identifying x li with 0 0 x 0 0 x is the i th coordinate we regard li as an ideal of l 1 ln for i n the black filled elements in figure 2 2 show how we consider c 2 and n 5 ideals of c 2 n 5 a very important property of direct products is 2 2 direct and subdirect products 21 c 2 n 5 figure 2 2 c 2 n 5 a direct product of two lattices theorem 2 1 let l and k be lattices let be a congruence relation of l and let be a congruence relation of k define the relation on l k by a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 iff a 1 a 2 mod and b 1 b 2 mod then is a congruence relation on l k conversely every congruence relation of l k is of this form a more general construction is subdirect products if l k 1 kn and the projection maps i are onto maps for i n then we call l a subdirect product of k 1 kn trivial examples l is a subdirect product of l and l if we identify x l with x x l 2 diagonal embedding in this example the projection map is an isomorphism to exclude such trivial cases let us call a representation of l as a subdirect product of k 1 kn trivial if one of the projection maps 1 n is an isomorphism a lattice l is called subdirectly irreducible iff all representations of l as a subdirect product are trivial let l be a subdirect product of k 1 and k 2 then ker 1 ker 2 0 this subdirect product is trivial iff ker 1 0 or ker 2 0 conversely if 1 2 0 in conk then k is a subdirect product of k 1 and k 2 and this representation is trivial iff 1 0 or 2 0 every simple lattice is subdirectly irreducible the lattice n 5 is subdirectly irreducible but not simple there is a natural correspondence between subdirect representations of a lattice l and sets of congruences 1 n satisfying 1 n 0 this representation is nontrivial iff i 6 0 for all i n in this subdirect representation the factors the lattices l i are subdirectly irreducible iff the 22 2 special concepts con l u v l 0 1 con u v 0 1 figure 2 3 a subdirectly irreducible lattice and its congruence lattice congruences i are meet irreducible for all i n by the second isomorphism theorem theorem 1 5 for a finite lattice l the lattice conl is finite so we can represent 0 as a meet of meet irreducible congruences and we obtain theorem 2 2 every finite lattice l is a subdirect product of subdirectly irreducible lattices this result birkhoff s subdirect representation theorem is true for any algebra in any variety a class of algebras defined by identities such as the class of all lattices or the class of all groups finite subdirectly irreducible lattices are easy to recognize if l is such a lattice then the meet of all the 0 elements is 0 obviously is an atom the unique atom of conl conversely if conl has a unique atom then all 0 congruences are so their meet cannot be 0 we call the base congruence of l called monolith in many publications if u 6 v and u v mod then con u v so conl 0 con u v 1 as illustrated in figure 2 3 let l be a finite subdirectly irreducible lattice with con u v the base congruence where u v l by inserting two elements as shown in figure 2 4 we embed l into a simple lattice lemma 2 3 every finite subdirectly irreducible lattice can be embedded into a simple lattice with at most two extra elements note that every finite lattice can be embedded into a finite simple lattice in general we need more than two elements for a stronger statement see lemma 14 3 2 3 terms and identities 23 u v l 0 1 b a figure 2 4 embedding into a simple lattice 2 3 terms and identities from the variables x 1 xn we can form n ary terms in the usual manner using and parentheses examples of terms are x 1 x 3 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 x 1 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 2 an n ary term p defines a function in n variables a term function or simply a term on a lattice l for example if p x 1 x 3 x 3 x 2 and a b c l then p a b c a c c b b c if p is a unary n 1 lattice term then p a a for any a l if p is binary then p a b a or p a b b or p a b a b or p a b a b for all a b l if p p x 1 xn is an n ary term and l is a lattice then by substituting some variables by elements of l we get a function on l of n variables such functions are called term functions unary term functions of the form p x p a 1 ai 1 x ai 1 xn where a 1 ai 1 ai 1 an l play the most important role see sec tion 3 1 a term function in fact any term function p is isotone that is if a 1 b 1 an bn then p a 1 an p b 1 bn furthermore a 1 an p a 1 an a 1 an note that many publications in lattice theory and universal algebra use polynomials and polynomial functions for terms and term functions 24 2 special concepts terms have many uses we briefly discuss three i the sublattice generated by a set lemma 2 4 let l be a lattice and let h be a nonempty subset of l then a sub h the sublattice generated by h iff a p h 1 hn for some integer n 1 for some n ary term p and for some h 1 hn h ii identities a lattice identity resp lattice inequality also called equation is an expression of the form p q resp p q where p and q are terms an identity p q resp p q holds in the lattice l iff p a 1 an q a 1 an resp p a 1 an q a 1 an holds for all a 1 an l the identity p q is equivalent to the two inequalities p q and q p the inequality p q is equivalent to the identity p q q the most important properties of identities are given by lemma 2 5 identities are preserved under the formation of sublattices homomorphic images direct products and ideal lattices a lattice l is called distributive if the identities x y z x y x z x y z x y x z hold in l in fact it is enough to assume one of these identities because the two identities are equivalent as we have just noted the identity x y z x y x z is equivalent to the two inequalities x y z x y x z x y x z x y z however the second inequality holds in any lattice so a lattice is distributive iff the inequality x y z x y x z holds by duality we get a similar statement about the second identity defining distributivity the class of all distributive lattices will be denoted by d a boolean lattice is a distributive complemented lattice a finite boolean lattice is isomorphic to some bn a lattice is called modular if the identity x y x z x y x z holds note that this identity is equivalent to the following implication x z implies that x y z x y z 2 3 terms and identities 25 the class of all modular lattices will be denoted by m every distributive lattice is modular the lattice m 3 is modular but not distributive all the lattices of figures 1 5 and 1 6 are modular except for part 1 2 3 4 and n 5 a class of lattices v is called a variety if it is defined by a set of identities the classes d and m are examples of varieties and so are l the variety of all lattices and t the trivial variety of one element lattices iii free lattices starting with a set h we can form the set of all terms over h collapsing two terms if their equality follows from the lattice axioms we thus form the free est lattice over h for instance if we start with h a b then we obtain the four element lattice f 2 of figure 2 5 we obtain more interesting examples if we start with an ordered set p and require that the ordering in p be preserved for instance if we start with p a b c with a b then we get the corresponding nine element free lattice f p of figure 2 5 b c a f p f 2 figure 2 5 two free lattices sometimes we need free lattices with respect to some special conditions the following result illustrates this lemma 2 6 let x y and z be elements of a lattice l and let x y y z z x be pairwise incomparable then sub x y y z z x b 3 lemma 2 6 is illustrated by figure 2 6 we will also need free distributive lattices obtained by collapsing two terms if their equality follows from the lattice axioms and the distributive identities starting with a three element set h x y z we then obtain the lattice freed 3 of figure 2 7 26 2 special concepts x y z y z z x x y z x y

8 an equivalent definition of freeness is the following let h be a set and let k be a variety of lattices a lattice freek h is called a free lattice over k generated by h iff the following three conditions are satisfied i freek h k ii freek h is generated by h 28 2 special concepts iii let l k and let h l be a map then there exists a lattice homomorphism freek h l extending that is satisfying a a for all a h 2 4 gluing in section 1 1 3 glued sums of ordered sets p uq applied to an ordered set p with largest element 1 p and an ordered set q with smallest element 0 q were introduced this applies to any two lattices k with a unit and l with a zero a natural generalization of this construction is gluing let k and l be lattices let f be a filter of k and let i be an ideal of l if f is isomorphic to i with the isomorphism then we can form the lattice g the gluing of k and l over f and i with respect to defined as follows we form the disjoint union k l and identify a f with a i for all a f to obtain the set g we order g as follows see figure 2 9 a b iff a k b if a b k a l b if a b l a k x and x l b if a k and b l for some x f lemma 2 7 g is an ordered set in fact g is a lattice the join in g is described by a g b a k b if a b k a l b if a b l a k x l b if a k and b l for any b x f and dually for the meet if l has a zero 0 l then the last clause for the join may be rephrased a g b a k 0 l l b if a k and b l g contains k and l as sublattices in fact k is an ideal and l is a filter of g an example of gluing is shown in figure 2 10 there are more sophisticated examples in this book see for instance chapters 12 and 18 lemma 2 8 let k l f i and g be given as above let a be a lattice containing k and l as sublattices so that k l i f then k l is a sublattice of a and it is

relation on l we define the reflexive product k r l as k l k l we can easily describe the congruences of g lemma 2 9 a congruence of g can be uniquely written in the form k r l where k is a congruence of k and l is a congruence of l satisfying the condition that k restricted to f equals l restricted to i under the identification of elements by 30 2 special concepts a i c i a cb b oon 5 m 3 figure 2 11 the two characteristic nondistributive lattices conversely if k is a congruence of k and l is a congruence of l satisfying the condition that k restricted to f equals l restricted to i then k r l is a congruence of g let a and b be lattices fa a filter of a ib an ideal of b and fb a filter of b let us assume that fa ib and fb are isomorphic we now define what it means to obtain c by gluing b to a k times for k 1 let c be the gluing of a and b over fa and ib with the filter fb regarded as a filter fc of c now if ck 1 with the filter fck 1 is the gluing of b to a k 1 times then we glue ck 1 and b over fck 1 and ib to obtain c the gluing of b to a k times with the filter fb regarded as a filter fc of c 2 5 modular and distributive lattices 2 5 1 the characterization theorems the two typical examples of nondistributive lattices are n 5 and m 3 whose diagrams are given again in figure 2 11 the following characterization theorem follows immediately by inspecting the diagrams of the free lattices in figures 2 5 and 2 8 theorem 2 10 i a lattice l is modular iff it does not contain n 5 as a sublattice ii a modular lattice l is distributive iff it does not contain m 3 as a sublat tice iii a lattice l is distributive iff l contains neither n 5 nor m 3 as a sublattice theorem 2 11 let l be a modular lattice let a l and let u and v be sublattices with the property u v a for all u u and v v then sub u v is isomorphic to u v under the isomorphism u u and v v u v 7 u v conversely a lattice l satisfying this property is modular 2 5 modular and distributive lattices 31 corollary 2 12 let l be a modular lattice and let a b l then sub a b a a b b that is the sublattice of l generated by a b a a b b is isomorphic to the direct product a b a a b b in the distributive case the sublattice generated by a b a a b b is the interval a b a b this does not hold for modular lattices as exemplified by m 3 let g be the gluing of the lattices k and l over f and i as in section 2 4 lemma 2 13 if k and l are modular so is the gluing g of k and l if k and l are distributive so is g the distributive identity easily implies that every n ary term equals one we get by joining meets of variables so we get lemma 2 14 a finitely generated distributive lattice is finite 2 5 2 finite distributive lattices for a nontrivial finite distributive lattice d the ordered set j d is equivalent to the lattice d in the following sense theorem 2 15 let d be a nontrivial finite distributive lattice then the map a 7 j a is an isomorphism between d and down j d corollary 2 16 the correspondence d 7 j d makes the class of all non trivial finite distributive lattices correspond to the class of all finite ordered sets isomorphic lattices correspond to isomorphic ordered sets and vice versa in particular d down j d and p j downp let d and e be nontrivial finite distributive lattices and let d e be a bounded homomorphism then with every x j e we can associate the smallest y d with y x it turns out that y j d so we obtain an isotone map j j e j d let p and q be ordered sets and let p q be a isotone map then with every i downq we can associate 1 i it turns out that 1 downp so we obtain the isotone map down downq downp theorem 2 17 let d and e be nontrivial finite distributive lattices and let d e be a bounded homomorphism let d and e be the isomorphisms 32 2 special concepts between d and down j d and between e and down j e respectively then the diagram d d down j d y ydown j e e down j e commutes that is down j d e let u be a finite order if u is an antichain then powu downu the finite boolean lattice of the power set of h since down j d is a sublattice of the finite boolean lattice of all subsets of j d we get corollary 2 18 every finite distributive lattice d can be embedded into a finite boolean lattice if d is nontrivial then it can be embedded into bn where n j d in theorem 2 15 instead of j d and down sets we could work with the dual concepts m d the ordered set of meet irreducible elements of d and up sets however surprisingly j d and m d are isomorphic to see this for a m d let a denote the smallest element x of d not below a that is with x a by distributivity it is easy to see that a j d in fact we have the following theorem 2 19 let d be a nontrivial finite distributive lattice then the map a 7 a is an isomorphism between the ordered sets m d and j d 2 5 3 finite modular lattices take a look at the two positions of the pair of intervals a b and c d in figure 2 12 in either case we will write a b c d and say that a b is perspective to c d if we want to show whether the perspectivity is up or down we will write a b up c d in the first case and a b dn c d in the second case if for some natural number n and intervals ei fi for 0 i n a b e 0 f 0 e 1 f 1 en fn c d then we say that a b is projective to c d and write a b c d one of the most important properties of a modular lattice is stated in the following result 2 5 modular and distributive lattices 33 b c a b d b c dc b a d c a d a figure 2 12 a b up c d and a b dn c d theorem 2 20 isomorphism theorem for modular lattices let l be a modular lattice and let a b up c d in l then c x 7 x c x a b is an isomorphism of a b and c d the inverse isomorphism is b y 7 y b y c d see figure 2 13 corollary 2 21 in a modular lattice projective intervals are isomorphic corollary 2 22 in a modular lattice if a prime interval p is projective to an interval q then q is also prime c c a b d b x x c y y b figure 2 13 the isomorphisms c and b 34 2 special concepts figure 2 14 the lattices s 7 and s 8 let us call the finite lattice l semimodular or upper semimodular if for a b c l the covering a b implies that a c b c or a c b c the dual of an upper semimodular lattice is a lower semimodular lattice lemma 2 23 a modular lattice is both upper and lower semimodular for a finite lattice the converse also holds a finite upper and lower semimodular lattice is modular and conversely the lattice s 8 in figure 10 1 see page 113 is an example of a semimodular lattice that is not modular see section 10 2 for an interesting use of this lattice the following is even more trivial than lemma 2 13 lemma 2 24 if k and l are finite semimodular lattices so is the gluing g of k and l a large class of semimodular lattices is provided by lemma 2 25 let a be a nonempty set then parta is semimodular it is not modular unless a 3 c h a p t e r 3 congruences 3 1 congruence spreading let a b c d be elements of a lattice l if a b mod implies that c d mod for any congruence relation of l then we can say that a b congruence forces c d in section 1 3 3 we saw that a b mod iff a b a b mod therefore to investigate congruence forcing it is enough to deal with compa rable pairs a b and c d instead of comparable pairs we will deal with intervals a b and c d projectivity see section 2 5 3 is sufficient for the study of congruence forcing or congruence spreading in some classes of lattices for instance in the class of modular lattices in general however we have to introduce somewhat more general concepts and notation as illustrated in figure 3 1 we say that a b is up congruence perspective onto c d and write a b up c d iff there is an a 1 a b with a 1 b up c d similarly a b is down congruence perspective onto c d and we shall write a b dn c d iff there is a b 1 a b with a b 1 dn c d if a b up c d or a b dn c d then a b is congruence perspective onto c d and we write a b c d if for some natural number n and and intervals ei fi for 0 i n a b e 0 f 0 e 1 f 1 en fn c d 35 36 3 congruences a da b b c d c figure 3 1 a b up c d and a b dn c d then we call a b congruence projective onto c d and we write a b c d if a b c d and c d a b then we write a b c d also if see section 2 5 3 a b up c d then a b up c d and c d dn a b if a b dn c d then a b dn c d and c d up a b if a b c d then a b c d and c d a b if a b c d then a b c d and c d a b but while and are symmetric the relations and are not in particular if a c d b then a b c d if a b c d then there is a unary term function p with p a c and p c d it is easy to see what special kinds of unary term functions are utilized in the relation intuitively a b congruence forces c d iff c d is put together from pieces c d each satisfying a b c d to state this more precisely we describe con a b the smallest congruence relation under which a b introduced in section 1 3 3 see r p dilworth 44 we use the technical lemma to prove this result theorem 3 1 let l be a lattice a b c d l a b c d then c d mod con a b iff for some sequence c e 0 e 1 em d we have a b ej ej 1 for j 0 m 1 this result can be usefully augmented by the following lemma for an application see lemma 23 2 lemma 3 2 let l be a lattice a b c d l with a b and c d then a b is congruence projective to c d iff the following condition is satisfied there is an integer m and there are elements e 0 em 1 l such that pm a e 0 em 1 c pm b e 0 em 1 d 3 1 congruence spreading 37 where the term pm is defined by pm x y 0 ym 1 x y 0 y 1 y 2 let l be a lattice and h l 2 to compute con h the smallest congru ence relation under which a b mod for all a b h we use the formula con h con a b a b h we also need a formula for joins lemma 3 3 let l be a lattice and let i i i be congruence relations of l then a b mod i i i iff there is a sequence z 0 a b z 1 zn a b such that for each j with 0 j n there is an ij i satisfying zj zj 1 mod ij this is an easy but profoundly important result for instance the well known result of n funayama and t nakayama 53 which provides the foundation for this book immediately follows another typical application is lemma 3 13 theorem 3 4 the lattice conl is distributive for any lattice l proof let conl as we note on page 24 to verify the identity it is sufficient to verify the inequality so let a b mod then a b mod and so a b a b mod and also a b mod so by lemma 3 3 there is a sequence z 0 a b z 1 zn a b such that zj zj 1 mod or zj zj 1 mod for each j with 0 j n for each j we have zj zj 1 mod so either zj zj 1 mod or zj zj 1 mod proving that a b mod by combining theorem 3 1 and lemma 3 3 we get corollary 3 5 let l be a lattice let h l 2 and let a b l with a b then a b mod con h iff for some integer n there exists a sequence a c 0 c 1 cn b such that for each i with 0 i n there exists a di ei h satisfying di ei di ei ci ci 1 38 3 congruences there is another congruence structure we can associate with a lattice l the ordered set of principal congruences princl a subset of conl we dedicate part vi to the study of this structure lemma 3 6 for a lattice l the ordered set princl is a directed ordered set with zero if l is bounded so is princl indeed for a b c d l an upper bound of con a b and con c d is con a b c d a b c d 3 2 finite lattices and prime intervals there is a much stronger version of the technical lemma for finite lattices see g gra tzer 72 lemma 3 7 let l be a finite lattice let be an equivalence relation on l with intervals as equivalence classes then is a congruence relation iff the following condition c and its dual c hold c if x is covered by y z l and x y mod then z y z mod proof to prove the join substitution property if x y and x y mod then 1 x z y z mod this is trivial if y z so we assume that y 6 z clearly we can also assume that x y and x z let u x y z we induct on lengthu the length of u using the fact that the intersection of two convex sublattices is either or a convex sublattice it follows that for every interval v of l the classes of ev are intervals hence we can assume that x y z indeed otherwise the induction hypothesis applies to v y z y z and ev since lengthv lengthu yielding 1 note that lengthu 2 if lengthu 2 then 1 is stated in c so we can also assume that lengthu 2 pick the elements y 1 z 1 l so that x y 1 y and x z 1 z the elements y 1 and z 1 are distinct since y 1 z 1 would contradict that x y z y 1 z 1 let w y 1 z 1 since the classes are intervals x y 1 mod therefore c yields that 2 z 1 w mod let i y 1 y z and j z 1 y z then length i length j lengthu hence the induction hypothesis applies to i and ei and we obtain that w y w mod combining this with 2 by the transitivity of we conclude that 3 z 1 y w mod 3 2 finite lattices and prime intervals 39 therefore applying the induction hypothesis to j and ej we conclude from 3 that x z z z 1 z y w y z mod proving 1 we get the meet substitution property by duality this lemma found applications in some recent papers of g cze dli and myself let prime l denote the set of prime intervals of a finite lattice l let p a b be a prime interval in l that is a b in l and let be a congruence relation of l in a finite lattice l the formula con p 0 p 1 p mod immediately yields that the congruences in j conl to be denoted by conj l are the congruences of the form con p for some p prime l of course a join irreducible congruence can be expressed as a rule in many ways in the form con p since a prime interval cannot contain a three element chain the following two lemmas easily follow from the technical lemma and from corollary 3 5 lemma 3 8 let l be a finite lattice and let p and q be prime intervals in l then con p con q iff p q this condition is easy to visualize using figure 3 2 the sequence of congru ence perspectivities as a rule has to go through nonprime intervals intervals of arbitrary size to get from p to q p q figure 3 2 congruence spreading from prime interval to prime interval 40 3 congruences lemma 3 9 let l be a finite lattice let p be a prime interval of l and let a b be an interval of l if p is collapsed under con a b then there is a prime interval q in a b satisfying q p in view of theorem 2 15 we get the following theorem 3 10 let l be a finite lattice the relation is a preordering on prime l the equivalence classes under form an ordered set isomorphic to conj l if the finite lattice l is atomistic then the join irreducible congruences are even simpler to find indeed if a b is a prime interval and p is an atom with p b and p a then a b dn 0 p so con a b con 0 p corollary 3 11 let l be a finite atomistic lattice then every join irreduc ible congruence can be represented in the form con 0 p where p is an atom the relation p q defined as 0 p 0 q introduces a preordering on the set of atoms of l the equivalence classes under the preordering form an ordered set isomorphic to conj l we use figure 3 3 to illustrate how we compute the congruence lattice of n 5 using theorem 3 10 n 5 has five prime intervals o a a b b i o c c i the equivalence classes are a b o c b i and o a c i the ordering holds because c i dn o b up a b similarly a c b o n 5 conn 5 conj n 5 1 0 i figure 3 3 computing the congruence lattice of n 5 it is important to note that the computation of p q may involve non prime intervals for instance let p o c and q a b in n 5 then p q because p up a i dn q but we cannot get p q involving only prime intervals as another example we compute the congruence lattice of s 8 see figure 3 4 by corollary 2 23 in a modular lattice if p and q are prime intervals then p up q implies that p up q and p dn q implies that p dn q thus p q implies 3 3 congruence preserving extensions and variants 41 1 s 8 cons 8 conj s 8 0 figure 3 4 computing the congruence lattice of s 8 that p q therefore theorem 3 10 tells us that conj l is an antichain in a finite modular lattice l so conl is boolean as noted in section 2 5 2 corollary 3 12 the congruence lattice of a finite modular lattice is boolean by a colored lattice we will mean a finite lattice some of whose prime intervals are labeled so that if the prime intervals p and q are of the same color then con p con q these labels represent a subset of the equivalence classes of prime intervals as stated in theorem 3 10 in figure 3 4 every prime interval of s 8 is labeled in figure 9 2 only some are labeled the coloring helps in the intuitive understanding of some constructions if the prime interval p is of color c then we define con c as con p 3 3 congruence preserving extensions and variants let l be a lattice and k l how do the congruences of l relate to the congruences of k every congruence restricts to k the relation k 2 ek on k is a congruence of k so we get the restriction map re conl conk that maps a congruence of l to ek lemma 3 13 let k l be lattices then re conl conk is a 0 1 homomorphism for instance if k o a i and l m 3 see figure 2 11 then conk is isomorphic to b 2 but only 0 and 1 are restrictions of congruences in l as another example take the lattice l of figure 3 5 and its sublattice k the black filled elements in this case conl conk b 2 but again only 0 and 1 are restrictions there is no natural relationship between the congruences of k and l if k is an ideal in l or any convex sublattice we can say a lot more 42 3 congruences k l figure 3 5 illustrating the map re lemma 3 14 let k l be lattices if k is an ideal of l then re conl conk is a bounded homomorphism proof by lemma 3 13 the map re is a 0 1 homomorphism let and be congruences of l we have to prove that ek ek ek since is trivial we prove so let a b k a b mod ek we want to prove that a b mod ek ek by lemma 3 3 there is a sequence z 0 a b z 1 zn a b such that for each j with 0 j n either zj zj 1 mod or zj zj 1 mod holds in l since a b k and k is an ideal it follows that z 0 z 1 zn k so for each j with 0 j n either zj zj 1 mod ek or zj zj 1 mod ek holds proving that a b mod ek ek let k l be lattices and let be a congruence of k the congruence conl the congruence con formed in l is the smallest congruence of l such that ek unfortunately conl ek may be different from as in the example of figure 3 5 we say that the congruence of k extends to l iff is the restriction of conl figure 3 6 illustrates this in part if a congruence extends then the congruence classes of in k extend to congruence classes in l but there may be congruence classes in l that are not such extensions the extension map ext conk conl 3 3 congruence preserving extensions and variants 43 maps a congruence of k to the congruence conl of l the map ext is a 0 homomorphism of conk into conl in addition ext preserves the zero that is ext is 0 separating to summarize lemma 3 15 let k l be lattices then ext conk conl is a 0 separating join homomorphism the extension l of k is a congruence reflecting extension and the sub lattice k of l is a congruence reflecting sublattice if every congruence of k extends to l k l figure 3 6 a congruence extends utilizing the results of sections 3 1 and 3 2 we can find many equivalent formulations of the congruence reflecting property for finite lattices lemma 3 16 let l be a finite lattice and k l then the following conditions are equivalent i k is a congruence reflecting sublattice of l ii l is a congruence reflecting extension of k iii let p and q be prime intervals in k if p q in l then p q in k as an example the reader may want to verify that any sublattice of a distributive lattice is congruence reflecting a much stronger concept central to this book is the following let k be a lattice a lattice l is a congruence preserving extension of k or k is a congruence preserving sublattice of l if l is an extension and every congruence of k has exactly one extension to l satisfying ek 44 3 congruences lk lk figure 3 7 examples of congruence preserving extensions lk lk figure 3 8 examples of not congruence preserving extensions of course conl it follows that 7 conl is an isomorphism between conk and conl two congruence preserving extensions are shown in figure 3 7 while figure 3 8 shows two other extensions that are not congruence preserving we can also obtain congruence preserving extensions using gluing based on the following result lemma 3 17 let k and l be lattices let f be a filter of k and let i be an ideal of l let be an isomorphism between f and i let g be the gluing of k and l over f and i with respect to if l is a congruence preserving extension of i then g is a congruence preserving extension of k if i and l are simple then l is a congruence preserving extension of i so we obtain corollary 3 18 let k l f i and be given as above if i and l are simple lattices then g is a congruence preserving extension of k 3 3 congruence preserving extensions and variants 45 lemma 3 19 let the lattice l be an extension of the lattice k then l is a congruence preserving extension of k iff the following two conditions hold i re ext for any congruence of k ii ext re for any congruence of l we can say a lot more for finite lattices lemma 3 20 let l be a finite lattice and k l then l is a congruence preserving extension of k iff the following two conditions hold a let p and q be prime intervals in k if p q in l then p q in k b let p be a prime interval of l then there exist a prime interval q in k such that p q in l lemma 3 19 ii is very interesting by itself it says that every congruence of l is determined by its restriction to k in other words conl ek we will call such a sublattice k a congruence determining sublattice we can easily modify lemma 3 20 to characterize congruence determining sublattices in finite lattices lemma 3 21 let l be a finite lattice l and k l then k is a con gruence determining sublattice of l iff for any prime interval p in l there is a prime interval q in k satisfying p q in l of course a congruence preserving sublattice is always congruence deter mining in fact a sublattice is congruence preserving iff it is congruence ref lecting and congruence determining c h a p t e r 4 planar semimodular lattices 4 1 basic concepts many concepts discussed in this section are diagram dependent this is discussed in detail in g cze dli and g gra tzer 33 a chapter in lts 1 a planar lattice l has a left boundary chain cl l and a right boundary chain cr l if c and d are maximal chains in the interval a b and there is no element of l between c and d then we call c d a cell a four element cell is a 4 cell or covering square that is cover preserving four element boolean sublattice of l a diagram of m 3 has exactly two 4 cells and three covering squares a planar lattice is called a 4 cell lattice if all of its cells are 4 cells for example m 3 is a 4 cell lattice but n 5 is not planar semimodular lattices can be characterized by cells see g gra tzer and e knapp 85 lemmas 4 and 5 lemma 4 1 let l be a planar lattice i if l is semimodular then it is a 4 cell lattice if a b are 4 cells of l with the same bottom then these 4 cells have the same top ii if l has a planar 4 cell diagram e in which no two 4 cells with the same bottom have distinct tops then l is semimodular as defined in g gra tzer and e knapp 85 a semimodular lattice l is slim if l contains no covering m 3 sublattice let l be a slim semimodular lattice two prime intervals of l are consecutive if they are opposite sides of a 4 cell as in g cze dli and e t schmidt 38 maximal sequences of consecutive 47 48 4 planar semimodular lattices prime intervals form a trajectory so a trajectory is an equivalence class of the transitive reflexive closure of the consecutive relation see figure 4 1 for two examples we denote by trajl the set of all trajectories of l figure 4 1 two trajectories 4 2 sps lattices an sps lattice is a slim planar semimodular lattice for the following lemma see g gra tzer and e knapp 85 lemma 6 lemma 4 2 an sps lattice l is distributive iff s 7 see figure 2 14 is not a cover preserving sublattice of l for an overview of this topic see g cze dli and g gra tzer 33 chapter 3 of lts 1 let us call the elements u v w l pairwise disjoint over the element a provided that a u v v w w u the first and third statement of the next lemma can be found in the litera ture see g gra tzer and e knapp 85 88 g cze dli and e t schmidt 40 41 lemma 4 3 let l be an sps lattice i an element of l has at most two covers 4 3 forks 49 ii if the elements u v w l are pairwise disjoint over a then two of them are comparable iii let x l cover three distinct elements u v and w then the set u v w generates an s 7 sublattice lemma 4 3 i and ii state in different ways that there are only two directions to go up from an element the next lemma states this in one more way this important statement follows from g cze dli and e t schmidt 38 lemma 2 8 lemma 4 4 let l be an sps lattice let q q 1 q 2 be pairwise distinct prime intervals of l satisfying q 1 dn q and q 2 dn q then q 1 q 2 sps lattices are meet semidistributive see ltf for the relevant definitions especially section 2 7 by k adaricheva for a current overview of semidis tributivity see the chapters by k adaricheva and j b nation in the second volume of lts 1 153 4 3 forks our goal is to construct all planar semimodular lattices from planar distributive lattices this section is based on g cze dli and e t schmidt 40 we construct a lattice extension l s of l as follows firstly we replace s by a copy of s 7 the lattice of figure 2 14 introducing three new elements secondly we do a series of steps each step introducing one new element if there is a chain u v w such that v is a new element but u and w are not and t u x x u w x u is a 4 cell in the original lattice l see figure 4 2 then we insert a new element y such that x u y x u and y v figure 4 2 illustrates the construction let l s denote the lattice we obtain when the procedure terminates we say that l s is obtained from l by inserting a fork at the 4 cell s it is easy to see that l s is an sps lattice for the new elements we shall use the notation of figure 4 4 in an sps lattice l an element u covering n 3 elements together generate up to isomorphism a unique sublattice we call this sublattice a multifork for n 3 it is s 7 for n 4 we get the lattice of figure 4 3 see g cze dli 18 consider the trajectory containing determined by a prime interval p the part of the trajectory to the left of p including p is called the left wing of p see g cze dli and g gra tzer 32 the left wing of o al is also called the left wing of the covering square s o al ar t we define the right wing symmetrically note that trajectories start and end in prime intervals on the boundary so a left wing starts with a prime interval on the boundary the direct product of two nontrivial chains is a grid now we can state the main result of g cze dli and e t schmidt 40 50 4 planar semimodular lattices v u x w v u x w v u x w v u x w figure 4 2 inserting a fork into l at s figure 4 3 a

cze dli and g gra tzer 32 see also chapter 3 in lts 1 presents a twin of this construction called resection there are other constructions that yield all planar semimodular lattices planar semimodular lattices can also be described by jordan ho lder permu tations see g cze dli and e t schmidt 42 g cze dli l ozsva rt and b udvari 34 and g cze dli 21 these descriptions are generalized to a larger class of lattices see g cze dli 19 and k adaricheva and g cze dli 1 there is a description with matrices see g cze dli 16 with smaller diagrams as in g cze dli 24 they can also be built from smaller building blocks called rectangular lattices discussed in the next section 4 4 rectangular lattices following g gra tzer and e knapp 87 a semimodular lattice l is rectan gular if the left boundary

let l be a nontrivial lattice if l cannot be obtained as a gluing of two nontrivial lattices we call l gluing indecomposable the following result of g cze dli and e t schmidt 40 is an easy conse quence of theorem 4 8 theorem 4 9 let l be an sps lattice with at least four elements then l is a patch lattice iff it is gluing indecomposable the next result of g cze dli and e t schmidt 41 follows
