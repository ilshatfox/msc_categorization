99 03 c 99 1 preliminaries decompositions into intervals were first studied by hausdorff 12 13 in the context of linearly ordered sets then extended to partially ordered sets graphs see sabidussi 19 appearing in particular in the study of compa rability graphs 9 the concept of decomposition was extended to hyper graphs and directed graphs by do rfler and imrich 4 and do rfler 3 and to higher arity relational structures by fraisse 6 7 8 a general abstract the ory of decompositions was first presented by mo hring and radermacher 17 and mo hring 16 under mild stipulations about what is to be considered an 1 http arxiv org abs 1306 5503 v 2 interval interval decompositions constitute a complete lattice in 17 it was proved that this lattice is semimodular whenever it is of a finite length this result was extended in 5 to arbitrary interval decomposition lattices and their meet irreducible elements were also described another proof for the semimodularity can be found in 14 we note that in graph theory inter val decompositions are closely related to the transitive orientation problem see 9 and 15 in the present paper we prove further properties of the lattice of interval decompositions first we characterise the join irreducible elements in this lattice and using this result we show that the lattice is bal anced as a consequence several other properties of the lattice of interval decompositions are deduced a closure system v q q p v is called algebraic if the union of any chain of closed sets is closed an interval system v i was defined in 5 as an algebraic closure system with the following properties i 0 x i for all x v and i i 1 a b i and a b 6 imply a b i i 2 for any a b i the relations a b 6 a b and b a imply a b i and b a i examples of interval systems given in 5 include modules of graphs and relational intervals these latter include order intervals in linearly ordered sets a set a q is called a strong set in the closure system v q if for any b q a b 6 implies a j b or b j a let s stand for the set of the all strong sets in v q then v q is an algebraic closure system satisfying conditions i 1 and i 2 let v q satisfy condition i 0 then and any singleton a a v are strong sets and hence v s is an interval system v and the singletons a a v are called improper strong sets we note that restricting a closure system v q to a nonempty set a v we obtain again a closure system a qa with qa q a q q clearly for any a q we have qa q and a qa is an interval system whenever v q is an interval system definition 1 1 a decomposition in a closure system v q is a partition ai i i of the set v such that ai q for all i i if v q is an interval system then is called an interval decomposition the set of all decompositions in v q is denoted by d v q 2 let part v denote the lattice of all partitions of v since d v q part v it is ordered by refinement where for any 1 2 d v q 1 2 holds if and only if any block of 2 is the union of some blocks of 1 more over in 5 we proved the following proposition 1 2 let v q be a closure system then d v q is a com plete lattice with the greatest element v if v q is algebraic and satisfies condition i 0 then d v q is a complete sublattice of part v if and only if it satisfies condition i 1 example 1 3 if t v e is a finite tree then the vertex sets of its subtrees form a closure system v q which satisfies conditions i 0 and i 1 then d v q is a finite sublattice of part v according to proposition 1 2 we prove that d v q is a boolean lattice isomorphic to p e indeed given s e define s as the equivalence relation on v in which two vertices are equivalent if they are connected in the tree t by a path containing only edges from s since the classes of s induce subtrees of t s is a decomposition in v q then the isomorphism of p e to the lattice d v q is given by the mapping s 7 s the following result was proved in 5 proposition 1 4 if v q be an algebraic closure system satisfying condi tion i 1 then d v q is an algebraic semimodular lattice therefore for an interval system v i the lattice d v i is always an algebraic semimodular sublattice of part v remark 1 5 let v q be a closure system satisfying i 0 then clearly x x v is the least element of d v q and to any a q corresponds the decomposition a a x x v a moreover if ai i i d v q then ai i i 1 where means the join in the complete lattice d v q 3 a decomposition ai i i in a closure system v q is called a strong decomposition if every ai i i is a strong set in v q since the strong decompositions in v q can be considered also as decompositions in the closure system v s they form a complete lattice d v s whose greatest element is v an element a of a lattice l is called standard see gra tzer 10 if x a y x a x y holds for all x y l the standard elements of l form a distributive sublattice of l denoted by s l the following result was proved also in 5 theorem 1 6 let v q be a closure system then the strong decomposi tions in v q are standard elements of d v q and d v s is a distributive sublattice of d v q and of part v a set a q of a closure system v q is called fragile if it is the union of two disjoint nonempty members of q otherwise a is called nonfragile this generalizes the concept of fragility studied by habib and maurer 11 in the context of the module systems of graphs in view of 5 if v q is an interval system then any nonfragile interval a q is a strong set 2 completely join irreducible elements in d v i an element j l 0 of a complete lattice l is called completely join irreducible if for any system of elements xi l i i the equality j xi i i implies p xk for some k i let j l stand for the set of completely join irreducible elements of l the completely meet irreducible elements of l are defined dually and their set is denoted by m l let us define a x l x a for any a l 0 and a x l x a for any a l 1 denoting by the covering relation in a lattice l we can observe that j l 0 is completely join irreducible j j j j and m l 1 is completely meet irreducible m m m m 4 in this section we characterise the completely join irreducible elements in the lattice d v i of interval decomposition and we show that they are closely related to the strong sets of v i the following result of 5 will be useful in our proofs lemma 2 1 let 1 bj j j and 2 ai i i be two decompositions in a closure system v q if 1 2 holds in d v q then there exists a unique k i and jk j j with at least two elements such that ak j jk bj and ai 1 for all i i k now we are prepared to prove the following result lemma 2 2 let v q be a closure system satisfying condition i 0 and d v q then is completely join irreducible in d v q if and only if there exists a nonempty closed set a q with a and such that a admits a greatest proper decomposition into closed sets proof assume that ai i i is a completely join irreducible element in d v q since ai i i according to 1 we obtain that ak for some k k then in view of lemma 2 1 bj j j x x v ak where bj q j 2 and ak equals to the disjoint union j j bj clearly bj j j is a proper decomposition of a qak let ct t t be an arbitrary decomposition of a qak such that 6 ak then it is easy to see that ct t t x x v ak is a decomposition in d v q and ak since is completely join irreducible we get hence the partition ct t t of a is a refinement of the partition bj j j of a thus holds in d a qak and this means that ak admits as a greatest proper decomposition conversely let a q be a closed set that admits a greatest proper decomposition a bj j j j 2 we prove that a is a completely join irreducible element in d v q since bj qa q and bj 6 for each j j bj j j x x v a is a decomposition in d v q now let d v q a arbitrary since the partition is a refinement of a it is has the form ct t t x x v a where ct q t 2 and a t t ct then ct t t is a proper decomposition in a qa and hence ct t t bj j j because 5 this result yields bj j j x x v a we deduce a bj j j x x v a a and this implies that a is completely join irreducible proposition 2 3 let v i be an interval system then is a completely join irreducible element in d v i if and only if a where a is an interval admitting a greatest proper decomposition bj j j j 2 such that each bj j j is a strong set in v i if the later condition holds with j 3 then a is strong proof let a i be an interval such that bj j j j 2 is a greatest proper decomposition of it then bj v i for all j j if j 3 then a can not be the union of two disjoint nonempty members of i therefore a is nonfragile and hence it is a strong set according to 5 in view of lemma 2 2 to prove our statement it is enough to show that each bj j j is strong first assume that j 3 then a is a strong set let c i such that c bj 6 for some j j since a is strong now c a 6 implies that either a c or c a holds in the first case bj c if c a then c x x a c is a decomposition in a ia and 6 a hence and this implies c bj because c bj 6 therefore bj is a strong set of v i let j 2 then a b 1 b 2 and b 1 b 2 is the greatest proper decomposition in a ia suppose that c b 1 6 and b 1 c then also c a 6 and a c since c a a c i we get that c a a c is proper decomposition in a ia hence since a maximal proper partition of the set a we obtain then b 1 c a as otherwise b 1 a c would imply c b 1 a contradiction thus b 1 c and this means that b 1 is a strong set the fact that b 2 is strong is proved similarly as an immediate consequence of proposition 2 3 we obtain corollary 2 4 let v i be an interval system if is a completely join irreducible element in d v i then is a strong decomposition a lattice l is called geometric if it is atomistic semimodular and alge braic it is well known that the geometric lattices are also dually atomistic 6 corollary 2 5 let v i be an interval system such that d v i is of finite length then the following assertions are equivalent i d v i is an atomistic lattice ii d v i is a geometric lattice iii d v i is a dually atomistic lattice iv d v i has no proper strong intervals proof i ii is clear because d v i is an algebraic semimodular lat tice according to proposition 1 5 the implication ii iii is obvious and iii iv follows from 5 corollary 3 7 iv i since d v i is a lattice of finite length any element of it is a join of some completely join irreducible elements see e g 1 now assume that v i has no proper strong intervals and let be a completely join irreducible element of d v i since we get because by corollary 2 4 6 v is a strong decomposition in view of proposition 2 3 we get that any block of is of the form a a v then since is the 0 element of d v i it follows that is an atom hence d v i is an atomistic lattice 3 further properties of the lattice d v i let l be a lattice of finite length l is called a strong lattice if for any join irreducible element j j l and for all x l j j x implies j x it is easy to see that any atomistic lattice is strong we say that the lattice l is dually strong if its dual l d is strong l is called a consistent lattice if for any j j l and each x l the element x j is a join irreducible in the interval x 1 if for any j j l and m m l with j m j m m j m j holds true then l is called a balanced lattice we say that l satisfies the kurosh ore replacement property for join decompositions korp for short if for every a l and any two irredundant join decompositions a j 1 jm and a k 1 kn 7 with j 1 jm k 1 kn j l each ji can be replaced by a kp such that a j 1 ji 1 kp ji 1 jm remark 3 1 it is well known that any semimodular lattice of finite length is dually strong see e g stern 20 it belongs to the folklore that a lattice l of finite length is balanced if and only if both l and l d are strong crawley showed 1 that l satisfies the korp if and only if l is consistent let l be of finite length as it is noted in 20 from the previous facts together with walendziak result 21 thm 1 it follows the equivalence of the following assertions a l is semimodular and has the korp b l is semimodular and balanced c l is semimodular and consistent d l is semimodular and strong theorem 3 2 let v i be an interval system if the lattice d v i has finite length then it is a balanced lattice that has the korp proof since d v i is a semimodular lattice of finite length in order to prove our theorem in view of remark 3 1 it suffices only to show thatd v i is strong take any j j d v i and x d v i with j j x because any join irreducible element of lattice with finite length is also completely join irreducible in view of corollary 2 4 j is a standard element in d v i thus we obtain j j j x j j j x j j x 2 since j is join irreducible and j j 2 implies j j x hence j x and this proves that d v i is strong the above theorem has an additional consequence for finite interval de composition lattices a tolerance of a lattice l is a reflexive and symmetric relation t l 2 compatible with the operations of l a block of t is a maximal set b l satisfying b 2 t suppose that the lattice l is of finite length then any block b of t has the form of an interval b u v u v l u v and the compatibility property of t makes it possible to build a factor lattice 8 l t whose elements are the blocks of t see cze dli 2 t is called a glued tolerance if it contains all covering pairs of l since every intersection of glued tolerances of l is again a glued tolerance of l there exists a least tolerance l comprising all pairs x y in l called the skeleton tolerance of l the lattice l is said to be glued by geometric lattices if all blocks of l are geometric lattices reuter 18 proved see also 20 thm 4 6 8 that for a finite lattice l the assertions a b c and d of remark 3 1 are equivalent to the following statement e l is glued by geometric lattices therefore by theorem 3 2 we infer corollary 3 3 let v i be an interval system such that d v i is a finite lattice then d v i is glued by geometric lattices acknowledgements this work has been co funded by marie curie actions and supported by the
