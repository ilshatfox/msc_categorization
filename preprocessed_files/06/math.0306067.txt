ar x iv m at h 03 06 06 7 v 2 m at h o a 1 0 m ay 2 00 4 about the qwep conjecture narutaka ozawa abstract this is a detailed survey on the qwep conjecture and connes embedding problem most of contents are taken from kirchberg s paper invent math 112 1993 1 introduction following kirchberg ki 1 we prove that several important conjectures arising in several branches of operator algebras are in fact equivalent theorem 1 1 the following conjectures are equivalent i we have c f max c f c f min c f ii the predual of any separable von neumann algebra is finitely representable in the trace class s 1 iii any separable ii 1 factor is a subfactor of the ultrapower r of the hyperfinite ii 1 factor r let a and b be c algebras and consider the problem to introduce a norm on their algebraic tensor product a b although there are presumably many c norms on the algebra a b there are two distinguished norms the minimal one and the maximal one a rather surprising theorem of takesaki ta 1 states that the minimal tensor norm is indeed the smallest c norm on a b these c norms have nice functorial properties both tensor norms tensorize completely positive maps and persist in passing to the second dual and moreover the minimal tensor norm is injective while the maximal tensor norm is projective thus it is natural to ask whether or not the minimal resp maximal tensor norm is the unique c norm with these functoriality since injective resp projective c norm comes from a fixed c norm on b 2 b 2 resp c f c f this problem is equivalent to asking whether there is only one c norm on b 2 b 2 resp c f c f probably led by this consideration cf ki 4 kirchberg conjectured that the answer would be yes for both cases however the problem date june 1 2003 2000 mathematics subject classification 46 l 05 46 l 06 46 l 10 key words and phrases qwep conjecture connes embedding problem the author was supported by the jsps postdoctoral fellowships for research abroad 1 http arxiv org abs math 0306067 v 2 2 narutaka ozawa on b 2 b 2 was solved negatively by junge and pisier jp the problem on c f c f remains outstanding the conjecture ii seems old cf hp since several analytical structures of banach spaces depend only on those of finite dimensional subspaces it is desirable to know whether any noncommutative l 1 spaces are finitely representable in the trace class s 1 many problems arising in operator spaces and noncommutative lp spaces are also connected to finite representability as an operator space e g ju ejr jr the problem iii was casually raised by connes co and is drawing increased attention in recent years in connection with free probability theory haagerup ha 3 showed a remarkable theorem that invariant subspaces exist for a large class of operators in ii 1 factors that are embeddable in r thus a positive answer would nicely complement haagerup s theorem the problem iii is equivalent to that microstates always exist microstates are used to define free entropy intro duced by voiculescu vo 1 besides its own interest free entropy has a number of important applications to theory of von neumann algebras voiculescu vo 2 later introduced another free entropy and asked the unification problem whether they actually coincide a negative answer to iii would imply this is not the case see voiculescu s survey vo 3 for details the problem iii may well be connected to geometric group theory in deep and important ways a positive answer would imply that all countable discrete groups are hyperlinear and hence would refute the famous theorem of gromov claiming that a proposition which holds for all countable discrete groups is either trivial or false here we say a group is hyperlinear if it is embeddable into the unitary group u r of r the class of hyperlinear groups is closed under several nat ural operations and contains all amenable groups and all residually finite groups since many exotic groups or monsters such as periodic simple groups with kazhdan s property t and non uniformly embeddable groups of gromov gr 1 gr 2 are arising as limits of hyperbolic groups it is particularly interesting to know whether all hyperbolic groups are hyperlinear in particular if such sim ple property t groups or non uniformly embeddable groups are not hyperlinear then there would exist non hyperlinear hyperbolic groups whether all hyper bolic groups are residually finite and hence hyperlinear is one of the major open problem in geometric group theory it is not completely understood for which c algebra a the semigroup ext a is actually a group kirchberg ki 1 showed the ext semigroup of the cone or the suspension over a is a group if and only if a has the llp local lifting property since a positive answer would imply that exact and non nuclear c algebras cannot have the llp it would follow ext cone a and ext s a never a group when a is exact and non nuclear about the qwep conjecture 3 proof of theorem 1 1 the equivalence i ii follows from propositions 3 19 4 1 and corollary 5 3 the implication ii iii follows from corollary 6 2 now we assume iii and prove i the assumption iii is equivalent to that all extremal traces and a fortiori all traces of c f satisfy the conditions in theorem 6 1 this implies that all separable von neumann algebras of type ii 1 are qwep cf corollary 6 2 we complete the proof by proposition 4 1 and the well known takesaki s theorem ta 2 that any separable von neumann algebra is isomorphic to a cp complemented von neumann subalgebra in a separable semifinite von neumann algebra acknowledgment the author would like to thank professors nate brown and gilles pisier for valuable comments this survey was written while the author was visiting the university of california at berkeley under the support of the japanese society for the promotion of science postdoctoral fellowships for research abroad notations unless otherwise stated all c algebras in this paper are assumed unital except for ideals and maps between them are assumed linear we will write a b c for unital c algebras j for ideals which always mean closed two sided ideals in c algebras m n for von neumann algebras r for the hyperfinite ii 1 factor f resp f for a free group resp on countably many generators b h resp k h for the c algebra of all bounded linear resp compact operators on a hilbert space h mn for the n by n full matrix algebra 2 preliminary background in this section we collect some basic results on positive maps we will omit proofs if they are found in standard references for c algebras a and b we denote by a b resp a min b a max b the algebraic resp minimal maximal tensor product for von neumann algebras m and n we denote by m n the von neumann tensor product for the definitions and basic properties of these tensor product we refer the reader to chapter iv in takesaki s book ta 1 and appendix t in wegge olsen s book we a general reference for the positive maps is sections 2 and 3 in paulsen s book pa 1 for simplicity we only deal with unital c algebras and unital maps al though this restriction is inessential lemma 2 1 a unital map between unital c algebras is positive if and only if it is contractive a positive map from a commutative c algebra into a possibly noncommutative c algebra is automatically cp for the proof see corollary 2 9 proposition 3 6 and theorem 3 11 in pa 1 the following two theorems are fundamental the first one is due to arveson ar 1 for cp maps and wittstock for cb maps recall that a unital self adjoint subspace of a c algebra is called an operator system this theorem means that b h is 4 narutaka ozawa injective in the category of operator systems with ucp maps resp operator spaces with complete contractions theorem 2 2 let x b be an operator space then any cb map x b h extends to a cb map b b h with cb cb in particular a ucp map from an operator system into b h extends to a ucp map the second one is the stinespring dilation theorem theorem 2 3 let a b h be a ucp map then there is a representation a b h and an isometry v h h such that a vh is dense in h and that a v a v for a a moreover the triple h v is unique up to unitary equivalence corollary 2 4 if a b is a ucp map then idc a c b c is continuous w r t the minimal resp maximal tensor norms proof we only prove this corollary for the maximal tensor product take a faithful representation b max c b h and let h v be the stinespring triplet for a b h we claim that for x c the operator x defined by x a vh j aj v j 7 j aj v x j h is well defined and x x indeed putting 1 n t n 2 h we have j aj v x j 2 i j a i aj x j x i 1 x a iaj 1 x x 2 a iaj x 2 j aj v j 2 where we used the fact that a i aj i j mn b is positive and commutes with 1 x for x c b since a vh h is dense gives rise to a representation of c on h whose range commutes with a hence is a representation of a max c such that idc a x v a x v for a a and x c this completes the proof the above construction is taken from ar 1 the jordan product on a c algebra a is defined as a b ab ba 2 for a and b in a this equips a with a commutative non associative algebra structure a self adjoint subspace in a c algebra which is closed under the jordan product will be simply called a jordan algebra a positive linear map between jordan algebras is called a jordan morphism if it preserves the jordan product jordan morphisms are necessarily contractive cf lemma 2 1 the following schwarz type inequalities are due to kadison ka for positive maps and choi ch 1 for cp maps about the qwep conjecture 5 corollary 2 5 let a b h be a ucp resp unital positive map then we have a a a a resp a a a a for every a a proof first let be a ucp map and h v be the stinespring triplet then we have a a a a v a 1 v v a v 0 for every a a this proves the case where is cp now let be a unital positive map it follows from the cp case that b 2 b 2 for every self adjoint element b in a since the restriction of to the com mutative c subalgebra generated by b is automatically cp hence denoting by re a a a 2 and im a i a a 2 we have a a re a 2 im a 2 re a 2 im a 2 a a for every a a corollary 2 6 let a b h be a ucp resp unital positive map for a a we have a a a a xa x a for all x a aa a a ax a x for all x a resp a a a a x a x a for all x a moreover the subspace c a a a a a a aa a a resp c a a a a a a is a c subalgebra resp a jordan subalgebra of a proof we denote by the usual product resp the jordan product throughout this proof let a a be so that a a a a and x a be arbitrary by corollary 2 5 we have for any t r 0 ta x ta x ta x ta x t a x x a a x x a x x x x since t r is arbitrary it follows that a x x a a x x a replacing x with ix we obtain a x x a a x x a combining them we obtain x a x a for all x a this proves the first half we only prove that c is a jordan subalgebra for unital positive it is clear that c is a self adjoint subspace of a hence it is sufficient to show that csa a c a a is closed under the jordan product since the usual product and the jordan product coincide on a commutative subalgebra we have a 2 csa provided that a csa now the claim that a b csa for any a b csa follows from the first half of this corollary and the equation a b 2 a b a b 1 2 a 2 b b 1 2 a 2 b 2 6 narutaka ozawa this completes the proof definition 2 7 we say the subalgebra c in corollary 2 6 is the multiplicative domain for by corollary 2 5 a a is in the multiplicative domain for provided that that a 1 and a is a unitary therefore if a b is a ucp resp unital positive map which maps the closed unit ball of a onto the closed unit ball of b then is surjective on the multiplicative domain for the following important corollary will be used frequently without mention corollary 2 8 let a b and let b b h be a ucp map such that the restriction of to a is a homomorphism then is an a bimodule map i e axb a x b for a b a and x b a map on b is called a projection if 2 the following theorem is due to tomiyama to a simple proof is found in section 9 in stra tila s book st and chapter ix in takesaki s book ta 2 theorem 2 9 for a b and a projection from b onto a the following are equivalent i the map is a conditional expectation i e the map is an a bimodule map axb a x b for a b a and x b ii the map is cp iii the map is contractive we need the structure theorem for jordan morphisms due to st rmer hs theorem 2 10 let a be a c algebra and a b h be a jordan morphism then there is a central projection p in the von neumann algebra m a generated by a such that the map a a 7 a p mp resp a a 7 a 1 p m 1 p is a homomorphism resp antihomomorphism we review some operator space theory we refer the reader to the books of effros and ruan er 2 and of pisier pi 2 many important results in operator space theory are related to the dual operator space structure introduced by blecher paulsen and effros ruan bl bp er 1 let x b h be an operator space and let x be its dual banach space for x xij i j mn x we define x x f 7 f xij i j mn let be the union of the closed unit balls of mn x n 1 2 we introduce an operator space structure on x by the isometric inclusion x f 7 x f x x mn x unless otherwise stated we always assume that the dual space x is equipped with this operator space structure we note that mn x mn x always about the qwep conjecture 7 holds isometrically but mn x mn x is not isometric it is not hard to see x min mn mn x cb x mn isometrically it follows that for operator spaces x and y there is a canonical isometric inclusion defined by x min y k fk yk 7 k fk yk cb x y the predual m of a von neumann algebra m is equipped with the operator space structure induced from that of m it is proved in bl that m m completely isometrically as one should expect 3 wep and llp definition 3 1 we say a c subalgebra a in b is cp complemented resp weakly cp complemented in b if there is a a ucp map b a resp b a such that a ida we say a c algebra b has the wep weak expectation property if it is weakly cp complemented in b h for a faithful representation b b h since b h is injective the definition of the wep does not depend on choice of faithful representation of b we say a c algebra is qwep if it is a quotient of a c algebra with the wep the qwep conjecture states that all c algebras are qwep if m n are von neumann algebras with a faithful normal trace on n then there is a unique trace preserving conditional expectation from n onto m defined by the relation a x ax for a m and x m in particular m is cp complemented in n indeed this follows from the fact that linear functionals on m of the form a with a m are dense in m let be a subgroup of then the c subalgebra in the full c algebra c generated by is naturally isomorphic to c indeed this follows from existence of induction moreover c is cp complemented in c by the conditional expectation defined by s 0 for s lemma 3 2 for c algebras a b the following are equivalent i the c algebra a is weakly cp complemented in b ii the second dual a is cp complemented in b iii for any finite dimensional subspace e b and any 0 there exists a map e a such that 1 and e a ide a in particular if a is weakly cp complemented in b and b has the wep then so does a if ai i i is a family of c algebras with the wep then ai has the wep proof the equivalence i ii is a consequence of the fact that any bounded linear map from a banach space x into a dual banach space y y uniquely extends to a weak continuous map from x into y the implication i iii 8 narutaka ozawa follows from the principle of local reflexivity for banach spaces to prove iii ii let i be the set of pairs e where e b is finite dimensional and 0 the set i is directed by the order relation e 1 1 e 2 2 if and only if e 1 e 2 and 1 2 by the condition iii for each i e i there exists a map i b a such that i e 1 and i e a ide a then any cluster point b a of the net i i i in the point weak topology satisfies that 1 and a ida it follows from theorem 2 9 that the weak continuous extension of on b is a conditional expectation from b onto a finally we observe that the condition iii is stable under direct product the notion of wep was introduced by lance la 1 where he showed the following theorem which in particular shows nuclear c algebras have the wep theorem 3 3 let a b then a is weakly cp complemented in b if and only if a max c b max c isometrically for any c algebra c resp for c c f or c aop proof we note that the canonical map a maxc a maxc is always isometric and the canonical map idc a maxc b maxc is always contractive hence the only if part follows from corollary 2 4 to prove if part let a b h be the universal representation i e a a and let c be a c algebra which has a representation c b h with c a by the assumption the representation a max c on b h extends to a ucp map b max c b h then the map b b 7 b 1 b h is a ucp extension of ida since is a c bimodule map cf corollary 2 8 we have b x b x x b for b b and x c i e b c a this completes the proof the following proposition reduces many problems to that for separable c algebras proposition 3 4 let b be a non separable c algebra and let x b be a separable subspace then there is a separable c subalgbera a which contains x and is weakly cp complemented in b proof let c c f and let bi i i be the directed set of all separable c subalgebras in b ordered by inclusions we claim that x b maxc lim x bi maxc for every x b c note that the limit in r h s always exists since the net is decreasing and that the inequality is clear to prove the converse inequality suppose that x bi maxc 1 for all i i it follows that for every i i there are commuting representations i bi b hi and i c b hi such that i i x b hi 1 let be a nontrivial ultrafilter on the directed set i and let h be the ultraproduct hilbert space of hi i i then the nets i i i and i i i give rise to commuting representations b b h and c b h therefore we have x b maxc x b h 1 which proves the claim about the qwep conjecture 9 let a 0 b be a separable c subalgebra containing x using the first part of this proof recursively we can find an increasing sequence an n 0 of separable c subalgebras in b such that x b maxc x an maxc for every n n and x an 1 c let a be the closure of n 1 an then a is a separable c subalgebra such that a max c b maxc isometrically hence by theorem 3 3 a is weakly cp complemented in b definition 3 5 let a b j be a ucp map we say is ucp liftable if there is a ucp lifting a b i e there is a ucp map such that for the quotient from b onto b j we say is locally ucp liftable if for any finite dimensional operator system e in a there is a ucp lifting e b we say a has the lp lifting property resp the llp local lifting property if any ucp map from a into any quotient c algebra b j is resp locally ucp liftable the following effros haagerup lifting theorem eh characterizes those ucp maps which are locally ucp liftable theorem 3 6 a ucp map a b j is locally ucp liftable if and only if id a b 2 b min b 2 j min b 2 is continuous w r t the minimal tensor norm on a b 2 existence of completely contractive local lifting immediately follows from opera tor space duality explained in section 2 but making the lifting completely positive requires a technical lemma see eh or wa for the proof of the following lemma lemma 3 7 let e b j be a ucp map from a finite dimensional operator system into a quotient c algebra suppose that for any 0 there is a lifting e b with cb 1 then is ucp liftable the c algebra b 2 is universal in the sense that it contains all separable c algebras and is injective the other universal thing is the full c algebra c f of the free group f on countably many generators since any separable c algebra is a quotient of it and it has the lp theorem 3 8 the full c algebra c f of a countable free group f has the lp proof this proof is taken from ki 2 we first show that a homomorphism c f b j is ucp liftable to this end let x 1 x 2 b be a contractive liftings of s 1 s 2 where s 1 s 2 are the free generators of f then each xn dilates to a unitary x n xn 1 xnx n 1 2 1 x nxn 1 2 x n m 2 b by universality there is a homomorphism c f m 2 b with sn x n it is not hard to see that the 1 1 corner of is a desired lifting of 10 narutaka ozawa now let c f b j be a ucp map since f is countable we may assume b j is separable by the kasparov stinespring dilation theorem la 2 there is a homomorphism c f m k minb j such that a a 11 for a c f where x 11 is the 1 1 entry of x m k min b j by the noncommutative tietze extension theorem the surjective homomorphism from k min b onto k min b j extends to a surjective homomorphism between their multiplier algebras hence by the first part of this proof there is a ucp map c f m k min b such that the ucp map c f a 7 a 11 b is a desired lifting of the above proof seems unreasonably involved hence it would be interesting to find another proof the llp rather than the lp is sufficient in most of places and an independent proof of the llp for c f will be given in theorem 3 14 we note that a map from a discrete group into a c algebra a extends to a ucp map on the full c algbera c if and only if it is unital and positive definite i e s 1 i sj i j is positive in mn a for any n and any s 1 sn since countable noncommutative free groups are isomorphic to subgroups of each other their distinction in our story is very minor the full c algebras of free groups on uncountable generators do have the llp it seems they do not have the lp but it is not known even for the free group of continuous cardinality there is a non separable c algebra which has the llp but not the lp indeed the commutative c algbera c 0 is such an example as there is no bounded linear lifting from c 0 into since c 0 contains a c subalgebra isomorphic to c 0 i with an uncountable index set i it cannot be embedded as a banach space into which has a separable predual we will see that the lp and the llp are equivalent for separable c algebras provided that the qwep conjecture is true corollary 3 9 let a be a separable c algebra and let j c f be such that a c f j then a has the lp resp the llp if ida is resp locally ucp liftable there is a criteria when a locally ucp liftable map has a global lifting this is due to arveson ar 2 and its variant is due to effros and haagerup eh the condition ii in this lemma is satisfied whenever j is nuclear the separability condition is essential as the quotient from onto c 0 is not grobally liftable lemma 3 10 let p a b j be a ucp map then is ucp liftable provided that a is separable and either i or ii holds i the ucp map can be approximated by ucp liftable maps in the point norm topology ii the ucp map is locally ucp liftable and moreover for any finite dimensional operator systems e f a any 0 and for any cp map e j there is a cp map f j with e about the qwep conjecture 11 proof let be the quotient map from b onto b j and let e 1 e 2 a be an increasing sequence of finite dimensional operator system with dense union we first deal with the case ii let n en b be ucp maps such that a n a 2 n a for a en we claim that there is a sequence of ucp maps n en b such that n n and n 1 a n a 2 n 2 a for n n and a en we proceed by induction suppose that n is already constructed take 0 sufficiently small since n 1 a n a 2 n 1 a for a en we can find a quasicentral approximate unit e j with 0 e 1 such that 1 e 1 2 n 1 a n a 1 e 1 2 2 n 1 a and moreover n a e 1 2 n a e 1 2 1 e 1 2 n a 1 e 1 2 a for a en cf ar 2 by the condition ii there is a cp map en 1 j such that a e 1 2 n a e 1 2 a we define n 1 by n 1 a b 1 2 a 1 e 1 2 n 1 a 1 e 1 2 b 1 2 where b 1 1 e b since b 1 we have n 1 a n a f 2 n 1 a for a en where f is a continuous function with f 0 0 this proves the claim the desired ucp lifting a b is now obtained by letting for a en a lim n n a the proof for the case i is similar but easier than the case ii indeed n and n in the above proof are defined globally on a hence no need to choose the following is the choi effros lifting theorem ce corollary 3 11 let a b j be a ucp map then is ucp liftable provided that a is separable and is nuclear i e there is a sequence of ucp maps n a mk n and n mk n b j such that n n converges to pointwise in particular a separable nuclear c algebra has the lp proof it is well known and not too hard to show that a map from mk into a c algebra c is cp if and only if eij ij mk c is positive it follows that any ucp map mk b j is ucp liftable the conclusion follows from this fact and lemma 3 10 the following is due to kirchberg ki 1 corollary 3 12 let a b j be a ucp map if a is a separable c algebra with the llp and b is qwep then is ucp liftable 12 narutaka ozawa proof we may assume b has the wep to verify the condition ii in lemma 3 10 we give ourselves finite dimensional operator systems e f a 0 and a cp map e j since b has the wep extends to a ucp map from a into b which is still denoted by for a directed set i let bi bi i i i i b strong lim i i bi exists in b and let bi b be the map which takes bi i i to its limit since the adjoint operation and product is jointly strong continuous on bounded sets bi is a c algebra and is a homomorphism choosing the directed set i appropriately we may assume that is surjective since a has the llp there is a ucp map f bi such that f it follows that there is a net of ucp maps i f b such that the net i e converges to in the pointwise weak topology taking convex combinations and multiplying by an approximate unit we find a desired cp map f j the converse is also true for the proof see oz 1 proposition 3 13 a separable c algebra a has the llp if and only if any ucp map from a into the calkin algebra b 2 k 2 is ucp liftable it might be the case that any ucp map from a separable c algebra into the calkin algebra b 2 k 2 dilates to a homomorphism into m 2 b 2 k 2 if it is the case then it would imply that a separable c algebra has the llp if and only if ext a is a group recall that the unitized cone of a c algebra a is defined to be cone a f c 0 1 a f 0 c 1 by an ingeneous argument on the cone kirchberg ki 1 proved that a separable c algebra a has the llp if and only if ext cone a is a group kirchberg ki 2 ki 1 proved the following important theorem and its corollary theorem 3 14 we have c f min b 2 c f max b 2 we will present an elegant and simple proof of pisier pi 1 to this end let en be the n dimensional operator space in c f spanned by 1 u 0 u 1 un 1 where u 1 u 2 are the canonical generators of c f it is rather obvious that en is canonically isometric to n 1 or equivalently n 1 k 0 kuk n 1 k 0 k for every k n 1 k 0 c this gives rise to the canonical one to one correspondence between an element z n 1 k 0 uk xk en b 2 and a map z n k n 1 k 0 7 n 1 k 0 kxk b 2 lemma 3 15 the above operator space en is canonically completely isometrically isomorphic to the dual operator space n 1 n or equivalently z min z cb for every z en b 2 about the qwep conjecture 13 proof since uk n 1 k 0 en min is contractive and z iden z uk n 1 k 0 we have z min z cb to prove the converse inequality we give ourselves contractions a 0 an 1 b h let a k m 2 b h be their unitary dilations cf the proof of theorem 3 8 it follows that the map en m 2 b h defined by uk a 1 0 a k k 0 n 1 is completely contractive since it extends to a homomorphism on c f hence the map en b h defined by uk a 0 uk 11 ak k 0 n 1 is also completely contractive therefore we have idb h z ak n 1 k 0 min idb 2 z min z min since the contraction ak n 1 k 0 b h min n was arbitrary we have z cb z min the dual operator space structure n 1 n coincides with so called the max imal operator space structure pa 2 lemma 3 16 let xi b hi i 1 2 be unital operator spaces and let x 1 x 2 be a unital complete isometry suppose that x 2 is spanned by unitaries in b h 2 then uniquely extends to a homomorphism between c subalgebras c xi in b hi proof by theorem 2 2 extends to a complete contraction from b h 1 into b h 2 which is still denoted by since is unital it has to be a ucp map since x 1 is isometric and x 2 is spanned by unitaries x 1 is contained in the multiplicative domain of cf definition 2 7 and the following remarks proof of theorem 3 14 thanks to lemma 3 16 it suffices to show that the formal identity map from en min b 2 into c f max b 2 is completely contractive for every n we give ourselves z n 1 k 0 uk xk en b 2 with z min 1 by lemma 3 15 the corresponding map z n b 2 is completely contractive hence by the stinespring type theorem for cb maps there are a hilbert space h a representation n b h and contractions v w b 2 h such that z f v f w for f n we may assume that h 2 then ak k v and bk k w are in b 2 and satisfy xk a kbk for k 0 n 1 and n 1 k 0 a kak 1 n 1 k 0 b kbk 1 it follows that n 1 k 0 uk xk c f maxb 2 n 1 k 0 1 ak uk bk c f maxb 2 n 1 k 0 1 ak 1 ak 1 2 max n 1 k 0 uk bk uk bk 1 2 max 1 this shows that the formal identity from en min b 2 into c f max b 2 is contractive since b 2 is stable it is also completely contractive we remark that the fact that c f has the llp was not used in the proof of theorem 3 14 combining this theorem with theorems 3 3 3 6 and corollary 3 9 we obtain the following 14 narutaka ozawa corollary 3 17 for a and b we have the following i a min b a max b if a has the llp and b has the wep ii a min b 2 a max b 2 if and only if a has the llp iii c f min b c f max b if and only if b has the wep we remark that both the wep and the llp and the lp for separable c algebras are stable under taking a tensor product with a nuclear c algebra and taking a crossed product by an amenable group this fact easily follows from the above corollary or the completely positive approximation property corollary 3 18 let ai i 1 2 be c algebras and let i c f ai be homomorphisms if at least one of ai s is qwep then the homomorphism 1 2 c f c f a 1 maxa 2 is continuous w r t the minimal tensor product proof thanks to proposition 3 4 we may assume that ai s are separable and the free group f is countable suppose that a 2 b j and b has the wep since c f has the llp 2 lifts to a ucp map 2 c f b it follows that 1 2 c f min c f id 2 c f min b c f max b 1 q a 1 max a 2 is continuous choi ch 2 proved that the c algbera c f is residually finite dimensional i e it has a faithful family of finite dimensional representations it follows that c f has a faithful trace kirchberg ki 1 observed that his conjecture is equivalent to the above for f f we note that bekka be proved that the full c algebra of a residually finite group need not be residually finite dimensional e g sl 3 z proposition 3 19 the following conjectures are equivalent i we have c f min c f c f max c f ii the full c algebra c f f is residually finite dimensional iii the full c algebra c f f has a faithful trace iv the c algebra c f has the wep v all separable c algebras are qwep vi the llp implies the wep proof we note that c f f c f max c f canonically the implica tions i ii iii are trivial and iii i follows from lemma 3 20 below the implications i iv v and vi i follow from corollary 3 17 for v vi we prove that a c algebra a with the llp and qwep has the wep let a b h and let be a quotient onto a from a c algebra b with the wep fix a finite dimensional operator system e a and let e e b be a ucp lifting since b has the wep e extends to a ucp map e b h b it follows that e e is a ucp map which coincides with the identity on e any cluster point of the net of ucp maps e b h a in the pointwise weak topology is a desired weak expectation this completes the proof about the qwep conjecture 15 lemma 3 20 any trace on the maximal tensor product a 1 maxa 2 factors through the minimal tensor product a 1 min a 2 proof it suffices to show the assertion for extremal traces it is well known and not too hard to see that a trace is extremal if and only if its gns representation generates a finite factor let be an extremal trace on a 1 max a 2 with the gns representation and let i ai m a 1 max a 2 be the restriction of to ai it follows that mi i ai are commuting von neumann subalgebras of m which have to be factors by uniqueness of the trace on a finite factor we have m a 1 a 2 m 1 a 1 m 2 a 2 for ai i ai which means that m m 1 m 2 recall the notations used in the proof of theorem 3 14 according to lemma 3 16 c f max c f c f min c f if and only if the formal identity n from en minen into c f maxc f is completely contractive for every some n 3 it follows from a grothendieck type factorization theorem of junge ju paulsen pa 2 and pisier pi 2 that n 2 for all n n however no nontrivial esti mates of n cb is known it is known that the c subalgebra in c f minc f generated by its diagonal s s s f is canonically isomorphic to c f indeed since c redf is qwep cf the remark at the end of section 4 the homomorphism c f min c f c redf max c redf is continuous thanks to corollary 3 18 the claim now follows from pisier s observation pi 2 that the diagonal in c red maxc red is canonically isomorphic to c for any discrete group the following is proved by pisier pi 1 and boca bo proposition 3 21 the llp resp the lp for separable c algebras is stable under a full free product by modifying pisier s proof pi 1 one can prove that the llp is stable under a full amalgamated free product over a finite dimensional c subalgebra indeed if ai i 1 2 are c algebras with a common c subalgebra b then the linear span of a 1 a 2 in the full amalgamated free product a 1 b a 2 is canonically completely isometrically isomorphic to the relative haagerup tensor product a 1 h b a 2 a 1 ha 2 nb where nb span a 1 x a 2 a 1 xa 2 ai ai x b hence if b is finite dimensional then there is a completely contractive lifting from a 1 h b a 2 into a 1 h a 2 it follows from lemma 3 16 that the canonical quotient map from a 1 a 2 onto a 1 b a 2 is locally ucp liftable whenever b is finite dimensional it is not known whether the full amalgamated free product over a finite dimensional c subalgebra preserves the lp the llp resp the lp also passes to a resp separable weakly cp comple mented c subalgebra it is not known whether the llp resp the lp is stable under the maximal tensor product or equivalently whether the full c algebra c f f has the llp resp the lp it seems related to the qwep con jecture but we have found no logical connection although it seems full group 16 narutaka ozawa c algebras rarely have the llp there is no example of groups whose full c algebra is known to fail the llp it was observed in oz 3 that there is a group whose full c algebra does not have the lp we note that the full c algebra c has the llp if and only if any positive definite function from into the calkin algebra b 2 k 2 has a positive definite lifting 4 permanence properties of the qwep following kirchberg ki 1 we study the permanence properties of the qwep proposition 4 1 we have the following i if ai is qwep for all i i then so is i i ai ii if a b is weakly cp complemented and b is qwep then so is a iii let ai i i be an increasing net of possibly non unital c subalgebras in a resp m whose union is dense in norm resp weak topology if all ai are qwep then so is a resp m iv a c algebra a is qwep if and only if the second dual a is qwep v if a is qwep and b is nuclear then a min b is qwep if m and n are qwep then so is m n vi if a resp m is qwep and is an action of amenable group then a resp m is qwep vii the commutant m is qwep if and only if m is qwep viii let m m d be the direct integral of separable von neumann alge bras then m is qwep if and only if m are qwep for a e proof ad i this follows from lemma 3 2 ad ii let j be an ideal in c with the wep such that b c j and let c b be the quotient map then the c subalgebra 1 a is weakly cp complemented in c and thus has the wep indeed this follows from lemma 3 2 and the fact 1 a j a j b c hence a is a quotient of 1 a which has the wep ad iii let m be the weak closure of a ai we will prove that m is qwep then the qwep property of a follows from ii by considering the case where m a by the kaplansky density theorem ball a is strong dense in ball m hence amplifying the directed set i if necessary we may assume that for any x ball m there is a net ai i i ball i i ai such that x strong limi i ai we denote by c i i ai the c algebra c is qwep by i let b ai i i c strong lim i i ai exists in m about the qwep conjecture 17 and let b m be the map which takes ai i i to its limit since the adjoint operation and product is jointly strong continuous on bounded sets b is a c subalgebra of c and is a surjective homomorphism onto m we claim that b is weakly cp complemented in c let ej j be an increasing approximate unit for j ker and let e limj ej c we note that e is in the center of b and b b e b 1 e j m since j is hereditary in c i e eixei j for all x c we have ec e j for a fixed free ultrafilter on i the map defined by c ai i i 7 weak lim i ai m is a ucp extension of this ucp extension gives rise to a conditional expectation from 1 e c 1 e onto b 1 e m it follows that b j m ec e 1 e c 1 e is cp complemented this proves our claim and we are done by ii ad iv this follows from ii and iii note we are not going to use v to vii of this proposition and the proof requires some results which will be proved later ad v the first assertion follows from the fact that the tensor product of a wep c algebra with a nuclear c algebra again has the wep the second assertion follows from corollary 5 3 or corollary 6 2 and the following result of tomiyama to if m 1 m 2 is a not necessarily weak continuous ucp map between von neumann algebras then the map idn m 1 n m 2 n extends to a ucp map idn m 1 n m 2 n indeed this follows from the fact that m 2 n is dense in m 2 n ad vi the assertion for von neumann algebras follows from that for c algebras let a be a c dynamical system with amenable we claim that there are nets of ucp maps i a mn i a and i mn i a a such that i i converges to id a pointwisely once this is proved then the qwep property of a follows from that of a cf corollary 5 3 take a faithful representation a b h with a unitary action u of on h which implements the action i e s a ad us a for a a then we have a b 2 h where s 7 s 1 b 2 h and a a 7 a b 2 h with a s s s 1 a we fix a finite subset f the compression of b 2 to b 2 f mf defines a ucp map f a mf a let f mf a b 2 h be the ucp map defined by f x v f 1 x vf where the isometry vf is given by vf 2 h s 7 1 f t f t 1 s t ut 1 s 2 2 f h a direct computation shows that f est t a 1 f s 1 t a therefore f maps into a and f f s a sf f f s a this proves the claim 18 narutaka ozawa ad vii this follows from standard representation theory of von neumann al gebras ad viii suppose m is qwep and let a be a separable weak dense c subalgebra which is weakly cp complemented inm cf proposition 3 4 then a is qwep by ii in this proposition since almost all m arise as the weak closure of representations of a they are qwep conversely suppose m are qwep for a e and let resp be a homomorphism from c f onto a weak dense c subalgebra of m resp m since is coninuous w r t the minimal tensor product for a e cf corollary 3 18 the representation d is also coninuous w r t the minimal tensor product if c f b h then one can show that c f m extends to a ucp map b h m cf the proof of theorem 3 3 the qwep property of m now follows from corollary 5 3 it is not known whether the minimal tensor product of qwep c algebras is again qwep or equivalently whether b 2 min b 2 is qwep or not we note that this c algebra fails the wep as shown in oz 2 haagerup ha 1 showed that there is a sequence of complete contractions n lf 2 c redf 2 a such that limn n a a for a a let lf 2 a be a cluster point of the sequence n then is a unital complete contraction such that a ida this shows that c redf 2 is weakly cp complemented in lf 2 cf theorem 2 9 it follows that c redf 2 is weakly cp complemented in any c superalgebra with a trace since lf 2 is qwep cf proposition 7 3 the reduced group c algebra c redf 2 is also qwep however it seems unknown whether the reduced group c algebra c red of say sl 3 z is qwep or not 5 finite representability in the trace class following kirchberg ki 1 we study the relation between the qwep property and finite representability definition 5 1 the banach mazur distance d between two banach spaces e and f is defined by d e f inf 1 e f a continuous linear isomorphism we put d e f when e is not isomorphic to f we say a banach space x is finitely representable in a banach space y if for every finite dimensional subspace e of x one has inf d e f f y 1 similarly the cb banach mazur distance dcb and os finite representability are defined by just replacing the usual norm with the cb norm in the above definitions for a banach space x we denote by ball x resp ball x the open resp closed unit ball of x a map x y is called a metric surjection if it maps ball x onto ball y i e x ker y isometrically if y embeds into x about the qwep conjecture 19 isometrically then the transpose of the isometric inclusion is a weak continuous metric surjection which maps ball x onto ball y proposition 5 2 for von neumann algebras m and n we have the following i if m embeds into n isometrically then there is a weak continuous unital metric surjection from n onto m ii if there is a weak continuous unital metric surjection from n onto m then there are projections p and q in n such that m is isomorphic to a normally cp complemented von neumann subalgebra of pnp qnq op proof ad i let 0 n m be the transpose of an isometric embedding of m into n let v be an extreme point of the weak closed face x n x 1 and 0 x 1 of ball n it follows from a standard argument cf sa that v is a partial isometry and 0 vv x 0 x hence the map n m defined by x 0 vx is the desired unital metric surjection ad ii let be a weak continuous unital metric surjection from n onto m let e n be the support projection of i e 1 e sup a n 0 a 1 and a 0 we note that a 0 and a 0 implies that is zero on the support projection of a it follows that a eae for every a n and that a 6 0 for all positive non zero element a ene let c ene be the jordan multiplicative domain for ene i e c a ene a a a a a ene a x a x for all x ene by corollary 2 6 and the following remark c is a weak closed jordan subalgebra in ene and c is a normal jordan isomorphism from c onto m hence c 1 is a normal jordan isomorphism from m onto c with idm by theorem 2 10 there is a projection p in c ene with q e p such that the map 1 m x 7 x p pnp resp 2 m x 7 x q qnq is a homomorphism resp antihomomorphism it follows that the map m x 7 1 x 2 x op pnp qnq op defines a normal unital injective homomorphism and the map pnp qnq op a bop 7 a b m defines a unital positive map such that idm therefore the map is a weak continuous contractive projection onto the von neumann subalgebra m in pnp qnq op we complete the proof by theorem 2 9 corollary 5 3 for a von neumann algebra m the following are equivalent i the von neumann algebra m is qwep ii there are a hilbert space h and a ucp map b h m which maps ball b h onto ball m 20 narutaka ozawa iii the predual m of m is os finitely representable in the trace class s 1 iv there is a qwep c algebra a and a contraction a m such that ball a is weak dense in ball m moreover we can choose the hilbert space h in ii separable when so is m proof ad i ii let b b h be a c algebra with the wep and let be a surjective homomorphism from b onto m since b has the wep there is a ucp map b h b with b idb it follows that the composition of and the normal extension b m of is a ucp map such that ball b h ball m if m is separable then there is a separable c subalgebra a in b h such that ball a is weak dense in ball m let a b 2 be a faithful representation and let b 2 b h be a ucp extension of 1 it follows that 0 is a ucp map such that 0 ball b 2 is weak dense in ball m fixing a free ultrafilter on n we define n n b 2 m by an n n weak lim n 0 an m since m is separable the ucp map maps ball n n b 2 onto ball m ad ii iii a metric surjection between c algebras which is ucp is automat ically a complete metric surjection cf corollary 2 6 if b h m is a ucp metric surjection then m b h is completely isometric by the principle of local reflexivity b h is finitely representable in b h s 1 h the operator space analogue of the principle of local reflexivity for s 1 h is a deep theorem of junge ju see ejr for a more general result ad iii iv let ei i i be an increasing net of finite dimensional subspaces in m with ei m by the assumption there is an embedding i ei s 1 for each i i such that i 1 dimei 1 and 1 i 1 fixing a free ultrafilter on i we define a contraction i i b 2 m by ai i i f lim i xi i f for ai i i i i b 2 and f m since f ei eventually the limit in the above definition makes sense we give ourselves an arbitrary x ball m for each i i let ai b 2 s 1 be a hahn banach extension of x 1 i i ei it follows that a ai i i ball i i b 2 is such that a x ad iv i by the kaplansky density theorem there is an directed set i such that for any x ball m there is a net ai i i in ball a such that x weak limi i ai it follows that the map i i a ai i i 7 weak lim i ai m defines a metric surjection from i i a onto m taking the transpose we ob tain an isometric embedding of m into i i a by proposition 5 2 m is about the qwep conjecture 21 isomorphic to a not necessarily unital cp complemented von neumann subal gebra of n nop where n i i a we conclude by proposition 4 1 that m is qwep 6 connes embedding problem let be a fixed free ultrafilter on n and let r be the hyperfinite ii 1 factor whose faithful normal trace is denoted simply by we define a trace on n n r by an limn an the ultrapower r of the hyperfinite ii 1 factor r is defined to be the von neumann algebra generated by the gns representation associated with we still denote by the faithful trace on r it turns out that n a r a a 0 is a maximal ideal in r and r r n as a c algebra is a ii 1 factor which is not separable let a be a c algebra and be a trace on a with the gns triplet h we denote by c the representation of the conjugate c algebra a of a on h defined by c b a ab for a b a the conjugate c algebra a is isomorphic to the opposite c algebra aop via a a 7 a op aop this gives rise to a representation of a a on h given by a a k ak b k 7 k ak c b k b h which is continuous w r t the maximal tensor norm it follows that the linear functional on a a given by a a k ak b k 7 k akb k c is also continuous w r t the maximal tensor norm connes showed that a ii 1 factor a is injective iff or is continuous w r t the minimal tensor norm on a a the following theorem of kirchberg generalizes connes characterization theorem 6 1 for a trace on a c algebra a in b h the following are equiv alent i the trace extends to an a central state on b h i e the trace extends to a state on b h such that ax xa for every a a and x b h ii there is a net of ucp maps i a mn i such that a limi trn i i a and limi trn i i ab i a i b 0 for every a b in a ii the trace is liftable i e there is a homomorphism a r with a ucp lifting a r such that iii the functional is continuous w r t the minimal tensor norm on a a iv the representation is continuous w r t the minimal tensor norm on a a moreover if a k h 0 then one can choose the ucp maps i a mn i in the condition ii as compressions to finite dimensional subspaces of h 22 narutaka ozawa proof we will prove i ii iii iv i and ii ii i ad i ii the proof is taken from ha 2 to prove ii we give ourselves a finite set f of unitaries in a and 0 we approximate the a central state by tr h where h is a positive trace class operator with tr h 1 by a standard approximation argument we find such h that tr hu u and h uhu 1 tr for u f further we may assume that h is of finite rank and has no irrational eigenvalues let p 1 q pm q p 1 pm n and q k pk be the non zero eigenvalues of h with the corresponding eigenvectors 1 m h put p max p 1 pm and define an isometry vk pk 2 h p 2 for each k by vk i k i for i 1 pk since vk s have orthogonal ranges the sum of vk s gives rise to an isometry v m k 1 pk 2 h p 2 identifying mq with b m k 1 pk 2 we obtain a ucp map a mq defined by a v a 1 v it follows that trq a tr ha for a a and that by denoting uk l u l k we have tr h 1 2 uh 1 2 u trq u u k l uk l 2 pkpl 1 2 min pk pl q k l uk l 2 p 1 2 k p 1 2 k p 1 2 l q k l uk l 2 pk q 1 2 k l uk l 2 p 1 2 k p 1 2 l 2 q 1 2 h 1 2 u 2 tr h 1 2 u uh 1 2 2 tr recall the powers st rmer inequality ps that h 1 2 u uh 1 2 2 tr h uhu 1 2 1 tr it follows that trq uu u u tr uhu tr h 1 2 uh 1 2 u tr h 1 2 uh 1 2 u trq u u 2 h 1 2 u uh 1 2 2 tr 2 1 2 for u f finally we note that trq ab a b trq aa a a 1 2 trq bb b b 1 2 for any a b a if a k h 0 then by glimm s theorem the ucp map a mq is approximated by compressions to q dimensional subspaces in h since a is spanned by unitaries this completes the proof of i ii ad ii iii since n mn min m n k xk y k 7 trn k xky k c are states for all n the net of states n i i i on a min a is well defined and converges to the functional ad iii iv this follows from the fact that is cyclic for a a and the corresponding vector state is continuous w r t the minimal tensor product about the qwep conjecture 23 ad iv i let b h min a b h be a ucp extension of and let b h x 7 x 1 b h since is an a min a bimodule map we have c b x x b x c b for all x b h and b a it follows that b h c a a and a in particular is an a bimodule map thus the state given by x x for x b h is a desired a central extension of ad ii ii i the implication ii ii follows from the definition of r and the fact that mn s are isomorphic to subfactors of r for all n now assume ii and let and be as in the condition since r is injective extends to a ucp map from b h into r composing this with the quotient map r r we obtain a ucp extension b h r of since is an a bimodule map the state given by is a desired a central extension of corollary 6 2 let m be a separable finite von neumann algebra then m is qwep if and only if m is isomorphic to a von neumann subalgebra of r proof any von neumann subalgebra of r is the range of a conditional expec tation and a fortiori is qwep now assume that m is qwep and let be a normal faithful state on m let c f m be a homomorphism with a weak dense range since m is qwep by corollary 3 18 the homomorphism c f min c f m max m is continuous it follows that theorem 6 1 is applicable to the trace on c f there is a homomorphism c f r such that this means that m is isomorphic to the von neumann subalgebra generated by c f in r 7 groups with the factorization property otherwise stated all groups denoted by the symbol are assumed countable and discrete if connes embedding problem has a negative answer then it is quite natural to seek a counterexample in the group von neumann algebras it turns out ki 3 ra 2 that embeddability of l into r is equivalent to that of into the unitary group u r of r we say a group is hyperlinear if it embeds into u r proposition 7 1 a group is hyperlinear if and only if l is isomorphic to a von neumann subalgebra of r proof one direction is obvious let u r be an injective homomorphism and let n n n u n n r be any lift i e s s for s we note that n is asymptotically multiplicative but no longer multiplicative for each n we define n s 7 n s 1 n s n s u m 2 r r 24 narutaka ozawa since z z 2 2 1 for z c with z 1 and z 6 1 we have limn n s 1 for all s with s 6 1 it follows that for an appropriately chosen sequence k n of integers the sequence of functions n k n n u m 2 r k n u r is asymptotically multiplicative and limn n s 0 for all s with s 6 1 this means that for the homomorphism lim n the von neumann subalgebra of r generated by is canonically isomorphic to l definition 7 2 we say a group has the property f the factorization property if the trace on the full c algebra c defined by s 1 s for s is liftable by theorem 6 1 a group has the property f if and only if the representation c c k ak bk 7 k ak bk b 2 is continuous w r t the minimal tensor norm where reps is the left resp right regular representation of on 2 a group with the property f is hyperlinear and to the best of our knowledge all groups known to be hyperlinear satisfy the property f let be a hyperlinear group and let n be a normal subgroup of f such that f n then because of the llp of c f the trace on c f given by the characteristic function of n is liftable hence the study on permanence properties of liftable traces is more general than that of hyperlinearity if p is a property of groups e g being finite then a group is said to be residually p if for any s with s 6 1 there is a normal subgroup in such that s and satisfy p when is a subgroup of the quotient homogeneous space is said to be amenable if there is a invariant mean on this is equivalent to the existence of a f lner sequence in see gl as it was observed by wassermann wa and kirchberg ki 3 residually finite groups and in particular the free groups have the property f this also follows from a more general result of brown and dykema bd that the property f is preserved under a free product with amalgamation over a finite subgroup proposition 7 3 a group which is residually f has the property f in particular residually finite groups have the property f moreover the property f is preserved under taking a subgroup a supergroup with an amenable quotient a direct product an increasing union and an amalga mated free product over a finite group proof the first assertion follows from the fact that the set of liftable traces is closed in the pointwise topology we only prove nontrivial claims in the second the claim on a supergroup follows from a ucp analogue of induction let and fix a section so that x x let c b h about the qwep conjecture 25 be a ucp map and let f be a finite subset then the ucp map dilates to a ucp map f c b 2 f h given by f s x f s 1 f esx x sx 1 s x b 2 f h for s indeed let h be the hilbert space arising from c h with the inner product t s s 1 t where is extended on by puting s 0 for s clealy acts on h by left translation since f coincides with the restriction of this unitary representation to the subspace generated by c f h it is ucp now we assume that is amenable and has the property f then there is a sequence of ucp maps n c mk n such that lim trk n n s 1 s and lim trk n n s n s 1 for all s it is not too hard to see that the sequence fnn on c satisfy the same conditions for a suitably chosen f lner sequence fn we turn to an amalgamated free product let ai i i be c algebras with a common finite dimensional c subalgebrab and let i be liftable traces onai which agree on b we have to show the free product trace on the full amalgamated free product i i ai b is liftable we may assume that i 1 2 since each i is liftable there is an asymptotically multiplicative and asymptotically trace preserving ucp map i from ai into a full matrix algebra di we claim that i can be chosen exactly trace preserving and multiplicative on b indeed by amplifying the rangedi if necessary we may assume that there is a trace preserving homomorphism i b di such that i u i u 2 0 for u u b cf bd for technical details note that u b is compact since b is finite dimensional we define a map i ai di by i a u b u b i u i u av i v du dv it is not too hard to see that i is a completely positive b bimodule map by our assumption ei 1 i 1 i b is close to zero in the 2 norm finally take a ucp extension i ai di of i and define a ucp map i ai di by i a i a e 1 2 i i a e 1 2 i for a ai then i is a small perturbation of i and agrees with i on b let a 0 i ai be the orthogonal complement of b w r t the trace i by boca s theorem bo the b bimodule map a 1 b a 2 b d 1 b d 2 b defined by a 1 an i 1 a 1 in an for ak a 0 ik i 1 6 6 in is a ucp map between the full amalgamated products since each i is asymptotically trace preserving and asymptotically multiplicative so is thus we reduced the problem to the case where ai are full matrix algebras di this case was proved by brown and dykema bd indeed under this assumption they showed that the reduced amalgamated free product is embeddable into an interpolated free group 26 narutaka ozawa factor and a fortiori into r and a homomorphism from the full amalgamated free product into r is ucp liftable brown suggested a possibility that all one relator groups have the property f we note that the baumslag solitar groups bs p q a t tapt 1 aq which are typical examples of non residually finite one relator groups at least for 1 p q are hyperlinear ra 2 and moreover have the property f since they are hnn extension of the cyclic group z and hence embeddable in the semidirect products by z of the increasing union of residually finite groups however it is not that all groups have the property f indeed infinite simple groups with kazhdan s property t for existence of such groups see gr 1 do not have the property f as it was shown by kirchberg ki 3 we refer the reader to de la harpe and valette s book hv for kazhdan s property t the following proof is close to that of kirchberg ki 3 but uses an idea of bekka wa theorem 7 4 let be a trace on the full c algebra c of a group with kazhdan s property t then is liftable if and only if there is a sequence of homomorphisms n c mk n such that a limn trk n n a in particular a group with the properties f and t is residually finite proof let be a set of irreducible representations of which contains exactly one representation from each equivalence class it follows that is a faithful representation of c on the hilbert space h h we consider the faithful representation of c min c on h h by the assumption the state on c min c is continuous hence it is approximated by a vector states associated with a unit vector n h h since s s 1 for all s the sequence of unit vectors n is almost invariant under here we regard as a representation of hence by kazhdan s property t we may assume that n are actually invariant under the well known lemma of schur states that for irreducible 1 and 2 the representation 1 2 has a non zero invariant vector if and only if 1 and 2 are equivalent and finite dimensional moreover any invariant vector for is a constant multiple of d 1 2 k k k where k k is an orthonormal basis of the d dimensional hilbert space h it follows that we may assume that the vector states associated with n is a convex combination with rational coefficients of that of s with finite dimensional we obtain the conclusion by observing that s 1 trd s for all s it is unknown whether there exists a simple property t group which is hyperlinear by the above theorem the full c algebra c of such a group cannot have the llp it is obvious that an inductive limit of hyperlinear groups is again hyperlinear since gromov gr 1 constructed infinite simple t groups as inductive limits where connecting maps are surjective and not injective of about the qwep conjecture 27 hyperbolic groups it is particularly interesting to know whether all hyperbolic groups are hyperlinear or more generally satisfy the property f 8 further topics and open problems haagerup and winsl w hw 1 hw 2 studied the space vn h of all von neu mann algebras acting on a fixed separable hilbert space h equipped with the effros mare chal topology among other things they proved that a ii 1 factor m vn h is embeddable into r if and only if it is approximated by finite dimensional factors in vn h they also gave a new proof of equivalence between the conjectures ra dulescu ra 1 ra 2 studied the space of the moments of noncommutative monomials of degree p in a ii 1 factor m and proved that it coincides with that for the hyperfinite ii 1 factor r when p 3 he also showed that the same assertion for p 4 is equivalent to the connes embedding problem brown br 1 br 2 studied various approximation properties of traces on c algebras and proved in particular that a separable ii 1 factor or any von neumann algebra m b h is embeddable into r resp qwep if and only if there are a weak dense c algbera a in m and a ucp map b h m with a ida there is a related result of brown and dykema bd on the interpolated free group factors lfs the following questions were raised by kirchberg ki 1 problem is the qwep conjecture true problem does there exist a non nuclear c algebra with the wep and the llp what kirchberg found is very close to an example he found an short exact sequence 0 k 2 b cone c redf 2 0 with b min b op b max b op by theorem 3 3 the c algebra b has the wep unfortunately it is not known whether b has the llp we remark that a c algebra with the wep has the llp if and only if it is os finitely representable in c f cf jp in the remarkable paper ht haagerup and thorbj rnsen proved that c redf 2 is embeddable into mn mn which has to be weakly cp complemented cf the remarks at the end of section 4 therefore all quasidiagonal extensions of c redf 2 have the wep however there are uncountably many mutually non isomorphic such extensions among which at most countably many can possibly have the llp the precise statement is that the set of all 3 dimensional operator subspaces in quasidiagonal extensions of c redf 2 is non separable in the cb distance topology cf jp problem does there exist a non nuclear exact c algebra with the llp existence of such an example is in contradiction with the qwep conjecture since exact c algebras are locally reflexive ki 2 and locally reflexive c algebras with the wep are necessarily nuclear eh to the best of our knowledge all 28 narutaka ozawa c algebras known to have the llp are either nuclear or equivalent to c f in the sense that they are cp complemented subquotients of each other we note that a c algebra a has both the exactness and the llp if and only if a min b 2 k 2 a max b 2 k 2 problem does there exist a separable c algebra with the llp but not the lp again existence of such an example is in contradiction with the qwep conjec ture by corollary 3 12 it seems that we have no example of a locally ucp liftable map defined on a separable c algebra which does
