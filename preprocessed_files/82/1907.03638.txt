engineering a bo akademi university a bo finland dated july 9 2019 the magnetically frustrated spin ice family of materials is host to numerous exotic phenomena such as magnetic monopole excitations and macroscopic residual entropy extending to low temperature a finite temperature ordering transition in the absence of applied fields has not been experimentally observed in the classical spin ice materials dy 2 ti 2 o 7 and ho 2 ti 2 o 7 such a transition could be induced by the application of pressure and in this work we consider the effects of uniaxial pressure on classical spin ice systems theoretically we find that the pressure induced ordering transition in dy 2 ti 2 o 7 is strongly affected by the dipolar interaction we also report measurements on the neutron structure factor of ho 2 ti 2 o 7 under pressure and compare the experimental results to the predictions of our theoretical model i introduction in a frustrated magnet a unique ground state can be difficult to reach since the primary interactions are ob structed by competition between interactions of similar strength or a special geometry of the lattice leading to a strong ground state degeneracy in the unperturbed case 1 therefore an eventual low temperature ordering transition and resolution of the third law of thermody namics is often driven by weak perturbative interactions whose effects are typically hidden in non frustrated sys tems in recent years the geometrically frustrated spin ice compounds have revealed many unusual phenomena such as magnetic monopole excitations 2 fractionaliza tion of the magnetic moment 3 and a low temperature coulomb phase 4 however a low temperature ordering transition below the coulomb phase in the absence of applied fields has not been experimentally observed in the classical spin ice compounds dy 2 ti 2 o 7 dto and ho 2 ti 2 o 7 hto 5 6 theoretically there are predictions for a dipolar driven low temperature transition in the 0 2 k temperature range 7 but experimentally the mea surements are challenging due to extremely slow relax ation effects 5 and the nature of such a transition is not known one way to increase the possible transition temper ature into a more experimentally accessible range is to apply a suitable perturbation such as pressure to the system previous experimental studies detect a clear uni axial pressure induced signature in the susceptibility of dto 8 while hydrostatic pressure has no noticeable effect on hto 9 a previous theoretical study predicts that uni axial pressure should give rise to an unusual infinite order phase transition in dto with features of both a con tinuous and discontinuous transition to a ferromagnetic state 10 in this study we include the long range dipo lar interaction in the theoretical model and find that it does not favor the ferromagnetic state we also perform spin polarized neutron scattering experiments on hto under uniaxial pressure and compare the results to our theoretical predictions while our model captures the qualitative features of the experiment further measure ments are needed in order to fully understand the effects of pressure on the low temperature spin ice state in dto and hto ii model simulation and experimental methods a model existing literature presents a large number of spin ice models ranging from effective monopole models 2 electrolyte theories 11 to microscopic models incorporat ing for example dipolar exchange and even hyperfine interations 6 12 13 different models emphasize different aspects of the physical properties of spin ices we aim to select the simplest model that captures the most relevant aspects of the pressure dependence of the system in the previous theoretical study on the effects of pressure in the classical spin ice materials a nearest neighbor model ar x iv 1 90 7 03 63 8 v 1 co nd m at s tr e l 8 j ul 2 01 9 2 was used 10 due to a self screening of the long range part of the dipolar interaction this relatively simple model gives a surprisingly good description of classical spin ice behaviour 14 15 it can be analyzed analytically us ing a husimi tree solution 16 and the low temperature properties are similar to those of the monopole model 2 however to capture the experimental low temperature behavior of dto and hto dipolar interactions have proven to be important 12 and we therefore consider the dipolar spin ice model the hamiltonian for normalized spins si residing on the sites ri of the pyrochlore lattice with nearest neighbor distance a is given by a nearest neighbor antiferromag netic exchange interaction j and a long range dipolar interaction d h i j j i j si sj da 3 i j si sj rij 3 3 si rij sj rij rij 5 1 a 001 p 001 j j j j j j b p 111 111 j j j j j j c p 110 110 j 1 j j 2 j 2 j 2 j 2 fig 1 model for uniaxial pressure applied in the 001 a 111 b and 110 c directions j remains fixed while j k vary with pressure colors indicate the different exchange interactions the angle between the ising axis and the side of the tetrahedron is altered to 001 111 and 110 when the crystal lattice is compressed in the respective direction here the angle brackets denote summation over near est neighbors and rij ri rj the antiferromagnetic in teraction j is caused by oxygen mediated superexchange between adjacent magnetic ions due to the strong crys tal field the spins are oriented along the local 111 axis connecting the center points of adjacent tetrahedra to capture the detailed behavior of a number of physical properties for dto exchange interactions up to third nearest neighbors have been determined 13 for simplic ity we do not investigate the effects of pressure on weaker further neighbor interactions and truncate the exchange but not the dipolar interaction at the first nearest neighbor we therefore use as our starting point the so called s dsm model with j 3 72 k d 1 41 k 7 for dto and j 1 56 k d 1 41 k for hto 17 we model compression of the crystal with zero poisson ratio as suggested by experiment 8 when atoms move closer the wave function overlap and corresponding ex change parameters are expected to change we make the assumption that j i j j jp 0 if the neigh bors i and j are in a lattice plane perpendicular to the direction of applied pressure and j i j jk if they are not jp 0 is the ambient pressure value of the s dsm model k labels the 6 different directions of nearest neighbor bonds and we make no a priori assumptions on the magnitude of jk the dipolar interactions become stronger along the direction of compression growing as rij 3 when distances decrease furthermore we make the assumption that the spins continue to point towards the centers of the tetrahedra as the crystal deforms al tering the local 111 axis this change of spin directions leads to a change in both exchange and dipolar interac tions due to the dot products in eq 1 motivated by experiments 8 we model pressure applied along the 001 111 and 110 directions by symmetry for the first two directions it suffices to model the near est neighbor interactions with two parameters j and j for the 110 direction however the lower symmetry of the lattice requires us to use three different exchange parameters j j 1 and j 2 we illustrate these different exchange interactions for a single tetrahedron in fig 1 for the three respective directions of pressure j k need not be the same for the different directions of pressure demagnetizing effects in susceptibility measurements can under ambient pressure be minimized by using needle shaped samples however such samples are likely to break under pressure and less elongated samples are used in practice it is therefore important to consider the demagnetizing transformation bext bint nm 2 which gives the relationship between the internal field bint the external field bext the magnetization m and the demagnetizing factor of the sample n note that n depends on the shape of the sample and therefore changes upon compression we find that this effect cannot be ignored in an accurate description of the experiments 8 hence the uniaxial pressure directly alters both micro scopic properties such as spin directions and interac tion parameters and macroscopic properties such as the magnetization and shape of the sample in previous magnetization measurements it was found that the signatures of pressure is largest when pressure is applied along the 001 direction 8 earlier theoretical work predicts a low temperature transition into an or dered phase carrying net magnetization along this axis 10 this motivates us to make an extended study of the zero temperature phases for our model in the 001 direction to investigate the system at low temperature b simulation method and demagnetization corrections monte carlo simulations using single spin flip and loop updates are used to investigate a number of different sys tem sizes with periodic boundary conditions according to 3 the metropolis hastings algorithm we use the 16 par ticle standard cubic unit cell 7 all super cells used are cubic of size l 3 l 1 8 ewald summation is used to effectively account for the long range condition ally convergent dipolar contributions 18 the geometrical compression is introduced by an appropriate linear co ordinate transformation depending on the direction of applied pressure in particular the ewald summation is done using sheared lattice vectors for the reciprocal space contribution in order to account for the macroscopic boundary effects demagnetization transformations are made by modeling the sample as a prolate ellipsoid the ma jor axes of the ellipsoid are given by the dimensions of the samples used in the experiment for the dto experiment 8 only the shape of the 001 and 110 crystals could be recovered 1 77 1 80 1 61 mm 3 001 pressure along the side of length 1 61 mm and 1 28 0 96 1 63 mm 3 110 pressure along the side of length 1 63 mm 19 these dimensions give n 001 0 319 and n 110 0 426 respectively in the high temperature limit 20 and we have not taken the temperature depen dence of the demagnetization factor into account 21 the sample dimensions are deformed in accordance with the microscopic compression of the lattice along the direction of pressure the dimensions for the sample measured in the 111 direction were unavailable and we assume the shape to be a perfect sphere with n 111 1 3 under am bient pressure c experimental methods magnetic neutron diffraction experiments were per formed at the institut laue langevin ill using the polarized diffuse scattering instrument d 722 23 elas tic neutron diffraction profiles with uniaxial polarization analysis neutron polarization along the vertical axis were measured for hto under uniaxial pressure with an incident wavelength 4 86 a polarisation analysis on d 7 measures spin flip and non spin flip contributions in the limit of negligible background and nuclear spin inco herent scattering the spin flip scattering will have only the magnetic scattering given by eq 4 the data have been corrected for detector and polarization analyzer ef ficiencies using standard samples of vanadium and amor phous silica respectively 22 uniaxial pressure was applied to hto crystals us ing a cu be anvil type pressure cell optimized for uni axial pressure details of the cell will be published elsewhere 24 temperature control was achieved using a liquid helium cryostat the samples were cylindri cal shaped single crystals v 10 mm 3 cut from the larger image furnace grown crystals with a surface align ment better than 0 1 the pressure applied was deter mined via force gauge calibrations considering low tem perature changes to the cell with a maximum pressure of 2 2 0 5 gpa the crystals were synthezised using an image furnace located at the univerity of lund with ambient oxygen conditions structural neutron diffraction measurements on zebra of the paul scherrer institute switzerland showed an absence of structural diffuse scattering which would have indicated oxygen defect clusters 25 iii theoretical and experimental results a magnetization the magnetization of dto single crystals under ap plied uniaxial pressure and magnetic field has earlier been measured at t 1 7 k 8 the magnetic field ranged up to 3 t and was parallel to the axis of pressure mea surements were performed with pressure along the 001 111 and 110 directions we adjust the parameters of the proposed model eq 1 to match the experimental data the best match between experiment and model is shown in fig 2 and next we describe the details of the modeling procedure 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 bext t m m experiment p 001 1 05 gpa mc j 001 3 91 k 001 1 34 experiment p 111 1 30 gpa mc j 111 4 31 k 111 3 3 experiment p 110 1 20 gpa mc

experimental result 8 dotted and our fit by mc simulation for a system of 8192 spins solid we assume that the magnetic moments retain their ising symmetry under pressure and that a sufficiently strong field aligns the moments for such a field changes in the demagnetization factor or in the interaction ener gies will have no effect on the magnetization the differ ence in saturation magnetization observed when apply ing pressure in different directions is purely due to lattice compression which changes the angle of the local 111 axis the components of the magnetic moments parallel to the direction of the applied field decreases which re 4 duces the saturation magnetization along the relevant di rection from the value of the saturation magnetization we can therefore determine the compression we find that the crystals deform by 001 1 34 111 3 3 and 110 1 0 for the 001 111 and 110 direc tions respectively this gives the demagnetization fac tors n 001 0 322 n 110 0 433 and n 111 0 341 under compression for the respective directions the data for the 001 direction appears saturated al ready at about 1 t while we assume that the data for the 111 direction has saturated at 3 t for the 110 di rection the experimental data has not saturated at high field we find this result peculiar since the configuration that minimizes the zeeman energy can be reached with out leaving the spin ice manifold for fields along 110 and 001 while this is not so for the 111 direction we would expect that a stronger field is needed to create the necessary monopole excitations for full 111 satura tion but this is not reflected by the experiment due to this anomaly in the high field behavior we take the value at 1 5 t which would firmly saturate the crystal in the 001 direction to be the saturation value for the 110 direction resulting in a compression of 1 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 t k m b d y io n mc for p 0 mc for p 110 mc for p 001 mc for p 111 fig 3 simulated values of

demagnetization factor fixed the j exchange parameter is adjusted in order to give the best fit for the measured magnetization as a function of external field these data are shown as contin uous lines in fig 2 it was found that for both the 001 and 111 directions the j coupling increases from the original value of j 3 72 k our best estimate gives j 001 3 91 k and j 111 4 31 k for the 110 di rection the parameters decrease and it is the difference j 110 1 j 1102 that determines the zero field limit in mag netization change our best fit gives j 110 1 3 29 k and j 110 2 3 35 k assuming that the exchange parameters are independent of temperature we find that for all di rections the ground state of our model is a dipolar spin chain state with zero net magnetization which is also the expected ground state of the dipolar spin ice model under ambient pressure 6 7 this is illustrated in fig 3 which shows how the fi nite size absolute magnetization drops to zero in a first order transition the transition temperature increases with pressure especially when pressure is applied in the 001 and 110 directions the twelve fold degeneracy of the ground state is lifted due to the change of symmetry in the deformed unit cell with pressure along 001 the ground state manifold is split into two submanifolds one with chains perpendicular to the 001 direction m and one with chains having a component along 001 m see fig 4 our fit to magnetic susceptibility data for dto finds that the m state has the lowest energy of the two possible states 001 m m a b fig 4 the degeneracy is lifted under application of pressure for the 001 direction there exists two submanifolds of ground states a m and b m red and blue bonds corresponds to j and j respectively only up tetrahedrons are drawn for

si sj but without dipolar interactions and no lattice compression in the hamiltonian it was found by fitting to the experimental data that j eff j eff and that this results in a ferro magnetic phase transition at low temperatures in this work we find that with the inclusion of dipo lar interactions the picture is more complicated since the m state will compete with the fm state the out come of this is that a larger difference between j eff and j eff is needed for the ferromagnetic transition to oc cur at the nearest neighbor distance the interaction in the s dsm model is jeff 5 d j and we note that in order for jeff to increase j must decrease we find that the ground state of the system is fm only when j eff 5 d jc 3 5 d j j eff instead of imme diately when j eff j eff furthermore with the inclu sion of lattice compression and the associated change of the local 111 axis we find when fitting to the magne m m fm afm j j dto p 0 gpa hto p 0 gpa 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 j d j d a 001 0 m m fm

suggested by the dto magnetization data blue light red and grey regions represent the m afm and fm states respectively the m region is very narrow and shown in dark red close to the j j line the phase boundaries shift with compression and j increases with pressure we include also the ambient pressure value for hto tization measurements that j increases as a function of pressure rather than decreases this change seem ingly moves away from rather than towards the fm boundary as illustrated in the left hand side of fig 5 however a further complication is that the critical value for the phase boundary j c 3 also increases with lattice compression right hand side of fig 5 so it may still be possible for the system to display the ferromagnetic transition but this would require much higher pressure than what has been applied in the current measurements by linear extrapolation j for dto would cross the zone boundary at 3 4 gpa and the fm transition would occur at low temperatures in fig 6 we show the general ground state phase dia gram as a function of normalized j and j interactions fig 6 a depicts the ground states of the system with no lattice compression in this case j j defines the boundary between the m and m phases when adding compression the phase boundaries are shifted which is illustrated as we plot the phase diagram for the experi mentally relevant compression in fig 6 b in particular the m region moves breaking the m m degeneracy for j j in favor of the m states the overall be havior is the same with an afm ground state for large j and a fm ground state for small j 6 c prediction of neutron diffraction results for dto neutron scattering is an ideal and unique tool to ex tract the spin spin correlations in materials 26 this en ables a close comparison

cracking dur ing the application of uniaxial pressure make these exper iments inordinately expensive and challenging instead we have chosen to perform neutron scattering measure ments on crystals of hto which share many low tem perature properties with dto 1 motivated by the theoretical results uniaxial pres sure was applied along the 001 crystalline axis with 001 polarized neutrons used to probe the h k 0 plane the axis perpendicular to the applied pressure is left unconstrained and therefore can give rise to the pois son effect in contrast to the previous magnetization measurements 8 however

scattering data after cell correction data taken at 1 5 k and 2 2 gpa the circles drawn mark regions of increased intensity for high q in the experimental data and are plotted in symmetry equivalent places for the theoretical estimate we construct a theoretical estimate of the change in scattering intensity since we do not know the pressure dependent susceptibility or magnetization data for hto we are not able to make a detailed determination of the evolution of j and with pressure in hto in contrast to dto however since the two materials are chemi cally similar and in order to make a rough estimate we assume that the compression is linear in the applied pres sure and that their compressibilities are identical using the fitted value for dto 1 34 at 1 05 gpa then gives a compression of 2 8 for hto at 2 2 gpa the magnetic ions in hto and dto are significantly dif ferent and it would be unreasonable to use the similarity argument also for the exchange interaction instead we adjust the single parameter j for hto to give the best possible match with experiment a comparison between the theoretical prediction and the experimental results for the relative increase in the magnetic structure factor under 2 2 gpa pressure is shown in fig 8 a fourfold rotational averaging consis tent with the crystalline symmetry has been performed on the experimental data the experimental data have been corrected for a strong background contribution from the pressure cell 24 this background dominates the low angular region of reciprocal space leaving this region rather poorly sampled there is a reasonable correspondence between the mea surement and the theoretical prediction in the region cor responding to wave vector transfers q 1 5 a 1 where the high intensity regions are marked by circles fur ther experimental activity will be required to improve the background from the pressure cell and reliably access the q 1 5 a 1 region in particular it is of interest to gather more statistics and to improve the construction and geometry of the cell to get a cleaner signal and bet ter control of the pressure the measurement of further crystallographic directions would also be of great value we note that the data from hto has weaker features than those predicted for dto fig 7 b this can be ac counted for by the tuning of the j parameter both changes in and changes in j give rise to a cross square pattern in the relative increases in the scattering which are not prominent in the experimental data the j pa rameter can be tuned such that these features are can celled to a large degree we choose it to get a profile as similar to the experiment as possible fig 9 shows the evolution of the relative increases in the scattering left half when varying j together with the

pattern is inverted when we increase j from 1 94 k to 2 00 k the circles drawn mark regions of increased intensity for high q in the experimental data and are plotted in symmetry equivalent places for the theoretical estimate we determine that the closest fit has j 1 975 1 98 k about 27 larger than j in contrast to j j 1 5 seen for dto the fact that the experimental 8 profile does not have a strong cross square pattern im plies within our model that the ground state of hto lies close to the border between the m and m states this is because the inversion point of the cross square pattern is at the border between the m and m phases in the ground state phase diagram fig 6 iv discussion and conclusion using a dipolar spin ice model we have accurately modeled the experimental changes in magnetization of dto under the application of pressure in multiple crys talline directions using the model parameters derived from the magnetization measurements we have calculated the correspondingly expected changes in neutron scat tering cross section for dto neutron scattering exper iments were performed on hto under applied pressure and we found the response to be weaker than what we predicted for dto one possible reason for the difference is that hto may be located at the boundary between two different chain states as discussed in the previous sec tion another is that the compressibility of hto may be smaller than that of dto and that the associated pres sure induced changes in the exchange parameters are also smaller furthermore we have not considered changes to exchange parameters past the nearest neighbors which certainly could influence the results 6 13 in conclusion we note that in order to determine which of these scenarios are relevant for hto more experiments are necessary in particular similar magnetization measurements of hto under pressure as previously were performed on dto would be highly useful acknowledgments we thank m mito and k matsuhira for useful
