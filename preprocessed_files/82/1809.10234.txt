the role of shape disorder in the collective behaviour of aligned fibrous matter salvatore salamone nava schulmann olivier benzerara hendrik meyer thierry charitat carlos m marques institut charles sadron universite de strasbourg cnrs 23 rue du loess bp 84047 67034 strasbourg cedex 2 france dated march 6 2019 we study the compression of bundles of aligned macroscopic fibers with intrinsic shape disorder as found in human hair and in many other natural and man made systems we show by a combination of experiments numerical simulations and theory how the statistical properties of the shapes of the fibers control the collective mechanical behaviour of the bundles this work paves the way for designing aligned fibrous matter with pre required properties from large numbers of individual strands of selected geometry and rigidity i introduction in natural and composite bundles of nearly fully aligned fibers as for instance in hair tresses ponytails and other natural fagots the spontaneously curved shapes of the individual strands allow for an intrinsic fluffiness of the materials 1 4 this was first discussed by van wyk 5 who proposed an equation of state eos for the material compressibility by suggesting that the response of wool stacks to compression is mostly controlled by the bending modes of the fiber strands the suggestion has been widely discussed in work related to fibrous matter 6 in explanations of the compressibility of textiles 7 matted fibers 8 non woven fibrous mats needled 9 or not 10 of bulk samples of wool fibers 11 for studies of the shape of hair ponytails 12 for predicting droplet formation at the tip of wet brushes 13 or even to study the mechanical response of aegagropilae 14 since van wyk s seminal work 5 many models have been proposed to understand the collective mechanical elasticity of stacks of randomly oriented straight fibers 15 18 recently broedersz et al have shown that the elastic properties of such networks are governed by bending elasticity for low connectivity and by stretching elasticity for high connectivity 18 in this paper we focus on the case of highly aligned fibers with disordered shapes fig 1 central image

fluffy cones made from fibers here we test the validity of a statistical mechanics treatment of this problem by studying both experimentally and numerically the compression behaviour of stacks of fibers with intrinsic shape disorder see fig 1 a generalisation of the mean field theory introduced in 19 compares well with our results revealing the key statistical and mechanical factors that control the eos of fibrous matter ii materials and methods a experimental systems fig 2 top example of a fiber stack of steel wool sw 1 with typical characteristic length scales lx ly bottom single fiber shape and definition of 0 x experiments were performed on 6 different fiber bundles with caracteristic sizes noted lx ly and d 0 see fig 2 and 3 a first class of samples was obtained by unbraiding different commercial climbing ropes of polypropylene pp 1 pp 2 and pp 3 and standard denim cloth den for most fiber studies fiber bundles were formed by stacking manually a high number hundreds or thousands of individual fibers of the same length ensuring a strong alignment a second class of samples sw 1 and sw 2 was obtained from standard steel wools gerlon r in this case compression experiments were directly performed on the purchased samples the fiber sections as observed by optical microscopy do not have regular shapes and we measured the following approximate diameters pp 1 and pp 2 100 20 m pp 3 20 5 m den 500 100 m sw 1 200 50 m and sw 2 300 100 m see esi section s 1 the individual mass of several fibers of each stack was measured allowing us to determine the mass per length together with the full mass of the stack it allows us to estimate the number n of fibers per bundle and the transverse density n ly see table i b experimental methods compression experiments were made using two different experimental setups the first one is homemade from a precision balance used as a force sensor mettler toledo r and a motorized translation stage this setup provides a very good resolution accuracy 2 10 4 n in a wide range of force 6 decades from 2 10 4 n to 40 n the stiffness of the device is of the order of 10 mpa and we have systematically corrected for scale plate displacement the second setup is a commercial testing system electropulstme 3000 from instron r 10 n sensor with a lower force range 3 decades 10 2 10 n accuracy 10 2 n but a higher stiffness 100 mpa this setup was mainly used for stress relaxation experiments with both setups and for each experiment we measured the distance d 0 between the compression plates at first contact the distance d between compression plates at each step of compression the projected lengths lx and ly see fig 2 and the force f we calculated the stress p f lxly and the relative deformation that we define as d 0 d see fig 3 3 fig 3 experimental images of a stack of thousands of fibers pp 1 before compression top and under a compression stress p bottom and definitions of d and d 0 c theoretical description we introduce now the theoretical models used in the following we assume that we have a two dimensional stack of n fibers in between two hard walls separated by a distance d for a compression stress p d d 0 for p 0 the average distance between fibers will be noted d d n and d 0 d 0 n for p 0 individual fiber shape deformations are associated to the bending energy given by hbend 2 n n 1 lx 0 dx n x 0 n x 2 1 where n x is the deformed shape and 0 n x the function describing the spontaneous shape of fiber n see fig 2 lx corresponds to the chain projection on the x axis the bending modulus is an intrinsic property of a fiber directly related to the young s modulus and the fiber geometry equation 1 is valid in the limit of small deformation gradients n 1 that is a very good approximation in the case of nearly aligned fiber stacks as we checked on experimental and numerical systems d numerical simulations numerical simulations were performed using the steepest descent method 20 to find the equilibrium conforma tions of compressed fibers represented by the bead spring model 21 22 sketched in fig 4 with nb beads per fiber interactions between beads are modelled by an effective hamiltonian containing three terms h hlj hbond hangle 2 the first term corresponds to the truncated and shifted lennard jones lj potential 23 describing the repulsive interaction between non neighboring beads hlj 4 r 12 r 6 for r 21 6 3 4 fig 4 sketch of the geometry of the numerical simulations at two different compression distances the insets show the shapes of two neighbouring fibers with the definition of the angles 0 i and i between consecutive beads i 1 i and i 1 where ri j is the distance between two monomers i and j and the monomer size the second term is the connectivity potential between two adjacent monomers on the same fiber hbond kb 2 ri i 1 r 0 2 4 with a strong spring constant kb 600 and r 0 the distance between two connected beads for a non deformed fiber the last term is the discrete representation of eqn 1 it corresponds to the angular potential that controls the chain stiffness and spontaneous shape hangle k 2 i 0 i 2 5 with i the angle between bonds i 1 i and i i 1 and k the angular stiffness the set of non vanishing reference angles 0 i i 1 nb 1 between any three consecutive monomers see fig 4 are chosen such that the local fiber gradients remain much smaller than unity fiber shapes can thus be also described by a single valued function 0 x which allows in the limit of large fibers to directly compare numerical results against continuous elastic theories with k r 0 the bending modulus 5 fig 5 color online average spectra 20 q extracted from measurements of at least 40 fibers of the 6 experimental systems and best power law fits with exponent solid line for pp 1 a sw 1 b sw 2 c pp 2 d pp 3 e and den f the insets display typical experimental fiber shapes iii single fiber characterization a shape characterization as we will see below the spontaneous shape of the fibers 0 x is a crucial determinant of the collective mechanical behavior of the bundle we measure 0 x for a large number 50 of individual fibers and we expand 0 x on the basis of the eigenfunctions qi x of the square laplacian operator that describes bending curvature elasticity 24 25 see also the esi section s 1 for more details 0 x i 0 qi qi x the corresponding spectra for average values 20 q are displayed on fig 5 the dominant amplitudes are present for q 2 mm 1 the dispersion of the variance spreads over 6 decades a dominant wavelength appears very clearly for pp 2 pp 3 and den all spectra exhibit a power law regime over two or more decades of wavenumber values the power exponent denoted is related to the roughness of the fiber and the prefactor of the power law to its root mean square amplitude b mechanical properties to determine experimentally the bending modulus of fibers we performed two different types of experiments the first one consists in measuring the oscillation period of a horizontal fiber see section iii b 1 this method is particularly suited for steel fibers sw 1 and sw 2 which are sufficiently rigid however we have not been able to apply it to synthetic fibers pp 1 pp 2 pp 3 and den which are too light and too sensitive to small disturbances for these fibers we have developed an original experience of stretching inspired by the work of kabla and mahadevan 4 see section iii b 2 6 1 single fiber oscillations fig 6 position of the end point of a sw 2 fiber during an oscillation experiment in the inset the spectral density sd obtained by a simple fourier transform of the signal the position of the end of a horizontal fiber is measured over time during an oscillation experiment see fig 6 see also the esi for a video a simple fourier transform allows precisely characterising the fundamental frequency f 0 of the system see fig 6 inset which is related to the modulus of curvature by the equation 24 25 3 194 ml 4 f 20 6 where m is the fiber mass and l its length 2 single fiber stretching experiments to determine experimentally the bending modulus of softer fibers we performed stretching experiments using the same experimental set up as for fiber stack compression a single fiber is attached by its extremities to the scale plate and the translation stage see the esi for a video at each stage of the experiment we measure the stretching force f and a snapshot is taken whereby the total length the projected length and the shape analysis of the fiber are calculated to avoid creating new folding states during the preparation of the fiber we proceed as follows we first measure the projection length l 0 of the fiber along the average direction of the unperturbed free fiber we then fix the fiber extremities to the experimental set up and impose a distance between extremities slightly smaller than l 0 forces and distances are then only considered for distances equal or above to l 0 as an example the shape of a pp 1 fiber for a few steps of a stretching experiment is shown in fig 7 in this example the reference state f l l 0 0 corresponds to step 6 steps 6 to 12 show clearly that the largest wavelengths are first unfolded as confirmed by the spectra see the esi section 1 where the amplitudes of the modes q 1 0 5 mm 1 and q 2 1 0 mm 1 ie 1 2 q 1 12 mm and 2 2 q 2 6 mm decreased significantly more than the other ones beyond step 15 the deformation is dominated by elongation complete mode supression is typically not attainable the fibers breaking before becoming completely straight the force measured during the stretching experiment is shown in fig 8 as a function of the length ratio using the equation of state developped for an extensible fiber by kabla and mahadevan 4

elasticity a perfectly ordered system consisting of a stack of sinusoidal fibers 0 i x d 0 2 cos 2 x i i with i for all i i 1 1 i 2 will be referred to as the reference system ref in the following in such an ideal configuration the eos can be computed easily from the functional minimization of eqn 1 leading to p 2 d ref 192 d 0 4 d 0 d d 0 8 this reference model will be compared to the results of numerical simulations to validate our method 2 self consistent model the challenge for a statistical mechanical treatment of aligned fibrous systems is thus to connect the information contained in spectra such as those of fig 5 and the mechanical behaviour under compression stress we follow here a two dimensional approach first introduced in 19 briefly fiber shape deformations are associated to the bending energy given by eqn 1 we assume that forces between first neighbours dominate the interaction energy an exact assumption for excluded volume potentials in two dimensions assuming a quadratic form for the interactions with a compression modulus b d the effective energy can be written as heff hbend b d 2 n n 1 l 0 dx n 1 x n x 2 9 by functional minimization we deduce the equilibrium shapes of the fibers and calculate the energy density e 2 d q q 4 1 q 4 4 b d q 4 20 q 10 where d is the mean distance between fibers the compression modulus b d has to be determined self consistently from bself d 2 d e d 2 11 the compressive stress given by p 2 d self d e d can then be calculated using p 2 d self d d d 0 bself d dd 12 equation 10 is the key result of this approach it relates the shape disorder distribution measured by 20 q to the energy density of the stack through a mechanical kernel accounting for bending rigidity and fiber interactions and allowing to calculate self consistently the state equation pself d 9 b experimental results fig 9 color online normalised stress vs times curves for pp 1 left axis and sw 1 4 right axis at 50 of deformation in 2 s the orange area corresponds to the duration of stress experiments 20 s presented in fig 10 and 11 we first perform stress relaxation experiments over long times 10 hours all materials demonstrate a complex relaxation behavior highlighting the effect of fiber rearrangement see fig 9 polymer samples see pp 1 exhibit a relaxation of almost 50 over 10 hours while steel wools relaxes only about 5 over the same time this is likely related to the higher friction coefficient between steel fibers compared to polymers in all cases it is clear from the relaxation experiments that performing the full compression experiments at high enough strain rate is important in order to avoid stress relaxation by fiber rearrangement we have thus decided to perform compression experiments on all samples with strain rate of the order of 50 mhz full compression experiments in less than 20 s corresponding to a maximum stress relaxation of 10 for pp samples and less than 1 for steel wools stress relative deformation curves are given in fig 10 and fig 11 all materials exhibit a strong non linear elasticity spreading over five decades of stress values using the experimentally determined spectra 0 q and the value of we apply the self consistent model see section iv a 2 to interpret the compression the whole method is illustrated in fig 10 in the case of the sample sw 1 we assume that the stacks of fibers consist of the transverse sum of independent planes of effective density that can be estimated from the geometrical characteristics of the bundle see table i since all planes contribute with p 2 d d to the total stress p 3 d d we write p 3 d d p 2 d d 13 for very weak relative deformations d 0 d 1 we observe a linear behavior corresponding to the deformation of the largest wavelength max this linear elasticity is well described by p 3 d ref p 2 d ref where p 2 d ref is given by eqn 8 and represented by dotted line in fig 10 and 11 for larger relative deformations d 0 d 1 we test the predictive power of eqn 10 by solving numerically the self consistent eqn 11 for the experimentally determined distributions 20 q as a result we obtain the 2 d stress p 2 d self d and p 3 d self p 2 d self d that is represented as dotted dashed lines in fig 10 for sw 1 if the overall shape of the data is well described by the theory it is clear that it is necessary to introduce a scaling factor exp to be able to reproduce the data for large deformation see dashed line finally we calculate the total stress ptot d p 2 d ref d expp 2 d self d 14 where exp is the only fitting parameters ptot d is represented as a solid line in fig 10 the experimentally determined compression stress p and the theoretical analysis for the six experimental fiber stacks studied in the paper are given in fig 11

elasticity behavior pref and the solid line the total stress ptot eqn 14 observe a very good agreement between the three dimensional experimental compression curves and the theoretical description c numerical simulations to further understand how fiber shape disorder determines the compression of the stack we performed numerical simulations on 2 dimensional systems we investigated three classes of two dimensional disordered systems in this configuration fiber rearrangements are forbidden first in order to validate our simulation method we consider a stack of perfectly ordered sinusoidal fibers referred to as the reference system ref in the following see fig 12 top inset as a second step we introduce phase disorder to the system by choosing a random phase shift i homogeneously distributed in phase space i 0 2 referred to as single mode disordered systems smd finally we investigate fiber stacks with a power law disorder pld inspired by the features of the experimentally measured distributions fig 5 this allowed us by varying the exponent between 2 and 5 to test the self consistent model by exploring a range of disorder wider than that of the experimental systems 1 reference system ref numerical simulation for the reference system is shown in fig 12 as see the esi section s 2 for more results it exhibits linear elasticity and the eos is well described in a large compression range without any fitting parameter by eqn 8 at very high compressions the fibers are fully squeezed and the stress is dominated by local excluded volume effects leading to a strong increase well above the bending contribution 2 single mode disorder systems smd numerical simulations on disordered systems smd distinctly exhibit non linear elastic behavior see fig 12 the compression behaviour is determined by randomness of phase shift and the distribution of wavelengths plays only a minor role as shown in the esi section s 2 a simple analytical approach accounting for phase disorder for a 11 fig 11 experimentally determined compression stress p vs relative deformation d 0 d for the six experimental fiber stacks studied in the paper pp 1 pp 2 pp 3 n den sw 1 4 sw 2

normalized density 20 1 2 d for 2 and 5 see also esi section s 2 for a more extensive set of values for the large density limit where fibers are in close contact and where shape disorder is irrelevant the data collapses on the same master curve similarly to those of a single mode fiber see fig 12 for the most significant compression regime at intermediate densities we observe a strong dependence of the compression law on the value of the exponent further confirming that the mechanical properties of the macroscopic stacks are controlled by fiber disorder by following a procedure similar to that applied to fit the experimental results we solve numerically the self consistent relation eqn 11 for the numerical distributions 20 q theoretical self consistent results presented in fig 14 show a remarkable agreement with compression values from numerical simulations the low compression regime is again well described by the linear elasticity p 2 d ref without any fitting parameters the self consistent theory is in good agreement with the numerical simulations especially for very rough fibers 4 provided that a global multiplication factor num be applied as for experimental results 13 fig

2 pp 3 n den sw 1 4 sw 2 v discussion both for experimental and numerical studies systematic deviations between the mean field predictions and the simulations can be seen in the low relative deformation limit where the distance between fibers is of the order of the fibers mean square amplitude mean field theory poorly describes this limit because of the vanishing number of fibers of mean amplitude larger than 20 1 2 this regime can be qualitatively understood by noticing that as the force rises sharply from zero due to fiber fiber contacts it progressively builds up with essentially single mode compression behavior this is shown in fig 11 and 14 where the dashed line corresponds to the single mode expression pref with the wavelength associated to the first mode of the distribution at larger relative deformations in both experimental and numerical cases the self consistent theory correctly described our results up to a numerical scaling factor exp and num respectively in both cases these are the 14 unique fitting parameters that we introduce in the description fig 15 displays num and exp as a function of values for both coefficients are comparable to the experimental uncertainties this clearly demonstrates that this coefficient is not related to experimental artifacts further supporting that our 2 dimensional approach is also relevant to describe 3 dimensional experiments up to a consistent density of stress planes and that it is the self consistent approximation that is involved it is worth noting that the agreement between numerical simulations and self consistent theory is optimal for 2 where num is of order unit this is further supported by the analytical resolution of the self consistent theory in continuous limit see esi section s 3 this corresponds to the case of the rougher fibers with the highest number of contacts a situation where the mean field self consistent approximation is expected to be more accurate the experimental fibers in this work have values close to 2 8 3 were is quite large in future work it will be interesting to identify classes of experimental fibers with 2 it is also important to note that in our theoretical analysis and computer simulations all the fibers interactions are purely repulsive in practice environmental conditions such as humidity might add short range adhesive components for instance capillary bridges to the force between fibers without including drastic changes such as that from the long range interactions in needled non woven materials 9 these short range effects are nevertheless worth investigating in the future for their relevance for the compression of experimental systems such as lacquered hair with cross linked contact points note that short range attractions would also provide for material cohesion of the stacks enabling for instance to perform tensile transversal experiments an experimental geometry better described by approaches for nonwoven fibrous mats 10 vi conclusions in summary we have investigated experimentally the mechanical properties of well aligned corrugated fiber stacks showing that such fiber stacks display a strongly non linear elastic behavior over 5 decades of stress we showed that a theoretical self consistent description 19 connecting fiber shape disorder with stack compressibility explains well three different classes of fibers we also performed numerical simulation studies for a larger class of fiber disorder interestingly we found that fiber shape as characterized by the phase and wavelength disorder at fixed amplitude is enough to induce a non trivial compression behavior we also simulated more realistic distributions for fiber disorder with the spontaneous fiber shapes reconstituted from a superimposition of modes with power law q dependent amplitudes for fibers of moderate corrugation the compression forces compare very well with our 2 dimensional mean field theory while more extensive simulation on 3 dimensional systems will certainly allow to better probe van wyk s seminal intuition 5 our results here show that bending disorder indeed control the compressive behavior of aligned fibrous matter provided that the statistical nature of the fiber shape disorder is accounted for vii acknowledgements we wish to thank je re mie geoffre and damien favier for their participation to

to calibrate our simulation method against predictions from continuous elasticity theory we test simple systems corresponding to single fibers with sinusoidal shapes confined between parallel walls in practice for consistency with the more complicated systems where periodic boundary conditions are imposed instead of simulating single chains between walls we simulate periodic systems consisting of pairs of chains with identical sinusoidal shapes and opposite phases 8 i i i 1 1 i 2 s 6 the opposite phases coupled with chains small roughness due to the shapes of individual monomers insure that chains do not slide in the following we will refer to this system as the reference state ref s 1 3 2 disordered states i single mode disordered systems smd we consider a first class of disorder by

3 1 single mode disorder model smd for this class of disorder we find numerically that even small perturbations in fiber ordering significantly modify the compression behavior of the fiber stacks in the intermediate compression regime as illustrated by data in fig s 8 results for disordered systems in fig s 8 suggest that the distribution of wavelengths plays only a minor role in the final compression behaviour that is instead determined by the presence of phase shift randomness we propose here a simple analytical approach accounting for phase disorder by considering a test fiber with a sinusoidal spontaneous shape of wavelength and amplitude d 0 neighbouring fibers exerce localised forces on the test strand by direct contact as sketched in fig s 8 we compute the deformation of the test fiber by minimizing the bending energy under a prescribed distance d between fibers and a given phase shift measured by x 0 see fig s 8 by defining the dimensionless variable u x 0 and
