interfacial phenomena in nanocapacitors with multifunctional oxides a v kimmel cic nanogune tolosa hiribidea 76 san sebastian 20018 spain the analysis of the structure chemical stability electronic and ferroelectric properties of the interfaces be tween pt 001 and pbzrtio 3 001 have been performed with ab initio methods we show that the chemical environment plays a critical role in determining the interfacial reconstruction and charge redistribution at the metal oxide interfaces we demonstrate that the difference in interfacial bonds formed at the pt pzt interfaces with tizr o 2 and pbo termination of pzt essentially defines the effectiveness of the screening and ease of polarisation switching in pzt based capacitors the imperfect screening in pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors is caused by strong interfacial bonds formed at the pt pztbo 2 interface that is accompanied by the suppressed polari sation of pzt film in contrast the capacitors with pbo terminated pzt show a negligible depolarising field and high polarisation which is the consequence of weak bonds formed at the pt pzt interfaces the latter also causes a higher switching barrier than that in the former system i introduction stable ferroelectric phases in nanometer thick films are of great interest for ultra high density and ferroelectric field ef fect transistors fefets thus the properties of ferroelectrics in ultrathin films has been under intense theoretical and exper imental investigation 1 10 lead zirconate titanate pb zr 1 xtix o 3 pzt is one of the most commonly used ferroelectric materials due to its small coercive field large polarisation relatively high curie tem perature and excellent piezoelectric response pzt is a dis ordered solid solution abo 3 perovskite with pb atoms oc cupying the a site and ti and zr cations randomly arranged among the b sites the material exhibits a rich phase diagram with the transition region x 0 42 0 52 known as the mor photropic phase boundary mpb where it exhibits its highest piezoelectric response 11 12 pzt has found a wide range of applications in piezoelec tric sensors actuators and non volatile memories where the interface between the metal electrode and a functional ox ide plays an important role in the performance of the de vice 5 10 13 15 for thin pzt films in particular the cycling stability the imprint performance and the leakage cur rent strongly depend on the interfaces between electrode ma terial and ferroelectric film 6 14 16 however the reliable and precise data on the interfacial properties whether at the structural or chemical level is often difficult to obtain from experiment in the interfacial region the local chemical and electrostatic environment significantly differs from that of parent materials and the description of the interface in terms of bulk parameters is unjustified in this work we use density functional theory calcula tions to provide an insight into the properties of pzt 001 pt 001 interfaces we study interfacial reconstruction the na ture of interfacial bonds and interfacial charge redistribu tion we characterise the stability of the ferroelectric phase in pt pzt pt metal oxide nano capacitors with respect to the size and termination of pzt we show that the chemical bonding a kimmel nanogune eu at the interface plays a critical role in determining the effec tiveness of the screening ease of polarisation switching and stability of ferroelectric state in perovskite based capacitors ii methods we carried out our first principles calculations with the castep plane wave code 17 and ultrasoft pseudopoten tials 18 we chose the wu cohen generalised gradient ap proximation density functional 19 because it is known to reproduce the structural properties of perovskites with high accuracy a 500 ev plane wave cutoff together with 0 025 1 den sity of k points monkhorst pack mesh have been used for cal culations the convergence of the total energy and forces per atoms were 0 005 ev and 0 05 ev respectively we model mpb composition of pzt with x 0 5 using one of the stable p 4 mm phases found by dft methods 20 this phase is characterised by the lattice parameters of a 5 625 and c 4 261 and exhibits an alternating columnar ar rangement of b site cations along the polar axis fig 1 a b we have modelled a pzt 001 slab terminated with pbo and tizr o 2 atomic layers further denoted as ao and bo 2 as followed to standard definition of perovskite formula abo 3 where a site cations are pb while b site cations are ti and zr further we use pt pztao and pt pztbo 2 nota tions for the pt pzt interfaces with ao and bo 2 terminations of pzt respectively due to symmetry breaking each sim ulated capacitor system is characterised by two electrostat ically inequivalent interfaces further denoted as p and p see fig 1 to reveal the effects of the thickness of ferroelectrics in pt pzt pt capacitor geometry we have varied the thickness of pzt n from 1 5 0 06 nm to 7 5 3 55 nm unit cells we model metal electrodes using pt slabs with a 3 998 fcc lattice parameter to achieve the convergence of electrostatic potential inside the metal we used ten layers of the metal elec trode overall to simulate the effect of the mechanical boundary condi tions due to the strain imposed by the substrate the in plane lattice constant of pzt was fixed to the theoretical equilib ar x iv

direction of polar axis is perpendicular to the interface due to symmetry break ing there are two inequivalent interfaces further denoted as p and p rium lattice constant of bulk pt thus the tensile strain was of 0 6 pzt atoms were allowed to relax in all the directions while only three metal layers in vicinity of the interface were allowed to relax the pt pzt pt nanocapacitors were simulated by using a supercell approximation with imposed periodic boundary con ditions a 1 x 1 periodicity of the supercell perpendicular to the interface is assumed this set up gives the electri cal short circuit condition as well as an electrode perovskite super lattice geometry thus the formula describing the peri odically repeated supercell is pt 5 pztn pt 5 n 1 5 7 5 we calculate the rumpling parameter which provides in direct understanding of a dipole bearing by an atomic layer as an averaged deviation of cations m and anions o in atomic layer i along the polar axis z 21 z i z mi z oi 1 the band offset at a metal insulator interface was calculated using a spatially resolved projected density of states pdos by defining the location of the band edges deep in the insulat ing region with the fermi level of the metal taken as a refer ence 21 i e nk b z i nk 2 e enk dk 3 where i is a normalised function localised in space around the region of interest and r e is the local density of states the planar averaged electron charge density normal to the interface was calculated as z 1 sxy x y z dxdy 4 where sxy is a cross section area of the system x y z is three dimensional charge density and z is its planar aver aged derivative the planar averaged potential was calculated across the ca pacitor as v z 1 sxy v x y z dxdy 5 where v x y z is three dimensional electrostatic potential sxy is the cross section of ferroelectric the planar averaged potential v z exhibits fast oscillations correlated with the atomic arrangement in the material in order to take the infor mation related to interfaces we have used a macroscopically averaged potential 21 v z v z h z z dz 6 where h z is the heaviside step function taken with the pe riod of the pzt lattice parameter iii results a chemical stability and atomic relaxation to characterise the interfacial binding energy density we calculated the difference between the total energy of the mod elling system etot and the sum of the energy of the pzt slab epzt and the pt slab ept normalised to the surface area s of the interface since our system has two interfaces we in clude a factor of 2 into the equation eslabpzt ept epzt pt 2 s we have found that both pt pztao and pt pztbo 2 sys tems are chemically stable calculated values exhibit a variation with the thickness of pzt however the increase of n leads to a rapid convergence of to 0 175 ev 2 and 0 252 ev 2 for pt pztao and pt pztbo 2 systems respec tivly thus it is energetically advantageous to form a pt pzt interface although the pt pztbo 2 system is 94 5 mev 2 more stable than pt pztao the values of the binding energy density are in good agreement with previous ab initio calcula tions of similar pt pzt interfaces calculated with open circuit boundary conditions 6 we have found a strong difference in the interfacial struc ture of pt pzt related to different chemical environment the pt pztao interface is characterised by a close contact of the pbo atomic plane with the surface of the metal electrode one may distinguish different types of oxygen species at the pt pztao interface see fig 1 the oxygen in pt o zr bonds further denoted as ozr and the one in pt o ti bonds 3 denoted as oti we show further that despite the chemical similarity of ti and zr cations in pzt 22 the interfacial bonds and the charge transfer at the interface with pt are dif ferent for these species with the increase of n the length of interfacial pt oti and pt ozr bonds converges to 2 1 and 1 99 for p and to 2 35 and 2 7 for p respectively the electrostatic asymmetry also affects the second neighbours to the interface for the p interface the short ti o and zr o bonds are 0 1 shorter in comparison to their bulk values 1 91 and 1 75 for the short zr o and ti o bonds respectively while the long ti o and zr o bonds at the p interface were elongated by 0 4 2 22 and 2 5 for long zr o and ti o bonds respectively such a difference in bond lengths occurs due the relative proximity of pb and o ions to the surface of the electrode the latter affects the electrostatic repulsion between cations dominated by the attraction between o and pt ions such an uncompensated repulsion as we will later see leads to the formation of weak pt o bonds at the p interface the pt pztbo 2 interface also shows p and p asymme try with respect to the interfacial bonds indeed the p in terface exhibits relatively short interfacial pt o bonds of 2 12 however the p interface relaxes with two types of pt o interfacial bonds long 2 4 and short 2 12 at the p the b site cations locate closer to pt cations than o ions thus the repulsion between positive species is partly balanced by the pt o attraction we have also observed rumpling of the first metal layer of 0 1 which rapidly decays away from the interface the analysis of the crystal orbital hamilton populations curves related to interfacial bonds demonstrates a strong bonding character of interfacial pt o bonds at pt pztbo 2 in terface meanwhile these bonds exhibit a very weak even non bonding character at the p side of the pt pztao inter face see supplementary information we have found that interfacial bonds formation induces the rotation of oxygen octahedra at the interfacial layers the ro tation of octahedra is characterised with the tilt angle see fig 2 with increasing of pzt thickness a rapid decrease from 8 to 0 5 is observed we found that the tilt angles of the octahedra based on zr and ti cations exhibit differ ent signs demonstrating an antiferro distortive nature of the reconstruction at the pt pzt interfaces the tilt angles are bigger at the pt pztao interface while the p interface of pt pztbo 2 shows negligible angles 1 o see fig 2 a similar phenomenon has been observed at sto pto and sto nb pto interfaces 2 here the rotation of oxygen octahedra was observed in nearly zero strain systems at open circuit conditions the authors have observed a long range octahedral rotation with the critical thickness of 4 nm above which the rotation disappears we assume that the origin of the interfacial rotation of oxy gen octahedra at the pt zt pt interfaces is related to the min imisation of strain and the depolarising field while at the pt pztbo 2 interface the octahedral rotation has a lesser am plitude due to the strong interfacial pt o bonds formed figure 2 the dependence of the octahedral tilt on the thickness n at a pt pztao b pt pztbo 2 interfaces b rumpling parameter in the capacitor geometry the formation of the interfacial bonds may affect the polarisation with the possibility of sup pression or enhancement of polarisation in the ferroelectric material 21 to characterise this the rumpling parameter for pt pztao pt and pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors has been cal culated for different thicknesses of pzt fig 3 below the critical thickness of nc 4 5 u c the rumpling parameter in pt pztao pt exhibits smaller values than that of the bulk pzt 0 49 and 0 36 for the pbo and tizro 2 atomic layers respectively with n nc the rum pling reaches its bulk limit for the pbo atomic layer while for tizro 2 layers is 0 2 lower than the bulk value the smallest system n 1 5 u c exhibits a negative rumpling at the p side this corresponds to the appearance of a head to head domain in pzt see fig 3 a notably the pt pztao pt capacitor shows an enhancement of the rumpling parameter at the p side up to 0 6 because of short pt o bonds formed while the p side exhibits re duced rumpling due to flattening of the interfacial layer the overall rumpling parameter in the thin pt pztbo 2 pt is significantly suppressed and reaches its bulk values for the thicknesses above the critical one nc the p interface in cluding several adjacent layers is characterised by a reduced rumpling parameter while the p interface exhibits its slight increase which converges to its bulk limit with n 10 we assume that interfacial reconstruction affects pt pztao interfaces making pbo atomic layers at p rougher in comparison to bulk pzt thus we expect that polarisation in pt pztao pt will be somehow similar to that in bulk pzt while in pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors we expect a suppressed polarisation due to flattening of the atomic layers this finding contradicts the conclusion of ref 23 that the perovskite materials with the flatter surface displays a strong enhancement of the polar instability while those that are sig nificantly buckled shows its suppression in the bulk p 4 mm pzt the pbo atomic layer is more buckled than the bo 2 one in the capacitor geometry the interfacial relaxation at the p interface enhances the rumpling of the former while notably reduces that of the latter 4 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 15 0 0 15 0 3 0 45 0 6 7 5 u c 6 5 u c 5 5

black circles corresponds to bulk pzt while coloured ones corresponds to pzt in capacitor geometry with different thickness from 1 5 to 7 5 unit cells c switching the interfacial reconstruction and bond formation may in fluence the switching characteristics of a capacitor because the process of switching requires a reversion of the polar state of ferroelectric which leads to a swap between p and p sides of the capacitor relative stability of the ferroelectric fe state versus the paraelectric pe state may be affected by the interfacial reconstruction and important in understanding the switching properties of capacitors we have found that a pzt based capacitor exhibits a higher pe state energy than that of the fe state for all studied ter minations and thicknesses see further details in the supple mentary information with n 4 5 u c the switching barrier of pt pztao pt converges to 0 41 ev per formula unit while that for pt pztbo 2 pt gives a smaller value of 0 26 ev per for mula unit both barriers are smaller than 0 451 ev barrier for bulk pzt the switching barrier for bulk pzt is expectedly high because it has been calculated for an ideal material free of defects domain walls metal contacts vacancies clearly the presence of interfaces affects the switching barrier we suggest that the switching barrier for the pt pztbo 2 pt is smaller because the interfacial layer is affected by polarisation reversal in a small amount i e there is no physical bond breaking at the interface although bond lengths are modified in addition the pt pztbo 2 pt shows flatter atomic layers than pt pztao pt thus less energy is required to revert the first system in contrast switching of pt pztao pt requires the transformation of the interfaces with a strong pt o bonding the p side to non bonding p which consists in bond breaking figure 4 the planar average of charge density difference of the pt pzt 7 5 system and the sum of the isolated metal and perovskite densities for a pt pztao and d pt pztbo 2 the projections of elec tron charge density on b xz and xy projections of the charge den sity at p c xz and xy projections for p interface of pt pztao p exhibits a larger population of the density originated from oti while p shows homogeneous weak population e xz and xy charge density projections for the p f xz and xy projections for the p interface of pt pztbo 2 the p interface shows the charge density localised at the interfacial bonds while p exhibits a lesser density at the interface with an asymmetry associated with ozr species d charge density distribution the asymmetry of interfacial bonds related to the differ ent chemical in a sense of ao and bo 2 terminations and the electrical environment i e the presence of p and p interfaces indicates a strong charge redistribution at pt pzt interfaces that would affect its electronic properties further we provide an insight into the redistribution of the charge den sity in the pt pzt pt capacitors for this we decompose the system into its perovskite and electrode components and calculate charge densities separately in respective frozen ca pacitor geometry the difference between the charge densities of the pt pzt pt capacitor and the sum of isolated pt and pzt systems give the charge redistribution caused by the in terface fig 4 the largest effect of the charge redistribution is at the interface itself inside the ferroelectric exhibits regular oscillations of a small amplitude indicating the long range effect of the density redistribution interesting that the amplitude exhibited by the pt pztbo 2 is twice larger than the that in the pt pztao the analysis of the charge density at the crossover of p and p interfaces provides an insight into the charac 5 ter of interfacial bonds fig 4 b c e f in particular the pt pztbo 2 shows a dense homogeneous population of the charge density for both p and p interfaces this corre sponds to strong chemical interactions followed by the charge transfer between pt and the outermost layer of pzt despite the repulsion between cations at the p interface the oxygen states hybridise with pt states in contrast the pt pztao interface exhibits a weak popu lation of the charge density at the p interface due to the re pulsion between closely located positive charges of pt and pb cations we note the p and p asymmetry in the hybridisa tion between pt and o states the oti species exhibit charge density population at the pt surface while ozr shows the den sity localised in the ferroelectric to provide quantitative insight into the charge redistribution in a pt pzt 7 5 pt system we have performed the analysis of the bader charges 24 for the reference the bader charges of oxygen species in bulk pzt vary as 1 22 e for species in pb o pb bonds and as 1 05 e and 1 28 e for oti and ozr respectively we found that interfacial pt species show the charge modi fication of 0 3 and 0 3 e in pt pztao pt and 0 2 and 0 2 e in pt pztbo 2 pt at the p and p interfaces respectively at the p side of pt pztao interface the oti species be come 0 07 e more electronegative in comparison to bulk while the ozr loose 0 08 e however at the p the charge variation is more pronounced of 0 39 e and 0 16 e for the oti and ozr respectively see notations in fig 4 the anions at the pt pztbo 2 interfaces become less elec tronegative see fig 4 with charge reduction of 0 11 e and 0 2 e at the p and p interfaces respectively in addition zr cations at the pt pztbo 2 interface became 0 02 e and 0 06 e more electropositive in comparison to the bulk at the p and p sides respectively meanwhile ti species show the largest modification of the charge at the p interface ti ion became 0 5 e less electropositive while at the p it gains 0 154 e the described interfacial charge redistribution has a good correspondence with the projected charge density fig 4 b c e f the bader charge analysis demonstrates that pt pzt pt capacitors are characterised by a strong redistribution of the charge which leads to the formation of unequal local dipoles at the p and p interfaces where the pt pztao inter face shows effectively larger formed dipoles than that at the pt pztbo 2 interface e electronic properties for most practical applications it is highly desirable for a capacitor to be insulating to dc current an undesirable source of heating and power consumption is related to the transmission of electrons via non zero conductivity or direct tunnelling to provide an insight into the electronic properties of metal oxide interfaces we have constructed pdos for pt pztao pt and pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors for the different pzt thicknesses we found that thin systems with nc 4 5 figure 5 projected density of states for atomic layers of a pt pztao pt and b pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors with n 7 5 u c red blue and black areas correspond to ao bo 2 and pt atomic layers respectively the vertical broken line depicts the femi level while dotted lines depict top of the valence band and the bottom of the condition band of the pzt film u c exhibit populated electronic states at the fermi level in the central layer of the system see supplementary informa tion the increase of n leads to an opening of the band gap and its value converges to 2 8 ev corresponding to the band gap of the bulk pzt calculated with gga level and expect edly underestimated in comparison to the experimental value in fig 5 the pdos for pt pzt 7 5 pt with ao and bo 2 terminations of pzt are shown one can see that the lay ers adjacent to the electrode interface exhibit states that cross the fermi level thus the system is locally metallic for the pt pztao pt capacitor in the middle of the pzt the states at the fermi level vanish which implies that the system is lo cally insulating the pdos of the conduction and the valence bands converges quickly to the bulk curve when moving away from the interface furthermore the pdos of each layer of pt pztbo 2 pt ca pacitor appears systematically shifted with respect to the neighbouring layers which is consistent with the presence of the depolarising field the increase of the pzt thickness leads to cross of the fermi level with unoccupied levels of pzt by extrapolating this straight line we would see that it crosses the fermi level at the thickness of n 9 5 u c f screening properties imperfect screening leads to the appearance of a depolaris ing field that reduces the dielectric response and can desta bilise the single domain ferroelectric state thus an in sight into the interaction of ferroelectric and electrode ma terials is crucial for the device design we further anal 6 ysed the planar averaged potential to tackle the variation of this property across the pt pzt pt capacitor we plot the macroscopic average electrostatic potential eq 5 in fig 6 for pt pztao pt and pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors together with the potential in the freestanding pzt slabs in frozen bulk ge ometry with a similar termination due to the polarisation orientation the p and p sur faces of the ferroelectric slab have different work functions causing the potential drop across the slab 1 and the poten tial difference between two asymmetric vacuum potentials 2 see fig 6 we found that the electronic screening proper ties of the pzt based capacitors depend crucially on the local chemical environment indeed the potential drop in the ao terminated slab 2 1 0 17 v is greater than that inside the pt pztao pt capacitor 3 0 015 v in the absence of elec trodes the depolarising field of 6 1 mv would bring the freestanding slab into the paraelectric state while in the ca pacitor geometry the field is cancelled mostly due to metallic screening from the electrodes that compensates the polarisa tion charge indeed in pt pztao pt the residual depolarising field inside the film is as small as 0 5 mv similarly for the bo 2 terminated slab we found a poten tial drop 2 1 of 0 09 v while the potential drop inside the bo 2 terminated capacitor is of 0 14 v much larger than that of the ao terminated system fig 6 c d the residual depo larising electric field in the pt pztbo 2 pt capacitor is of 4 5 mv that produces a linearly increasing electrostatic poten tial on the film fig 6 b the existence of such a depolaris ing field is caused by the imperfect screening at the interface 21 25 26 which is a property of the interface as a whole that is the metal the ferroelectric and the specific interface geometry we assume the origin of the depolarising field is due to strong chemical bonds formed at the pt pztbo 2 inter faces we therefore emphasise the importance of the chemical environment leading to the inequivalent work functions de termining the ferroelectric behaviour of ultrathin films at this range of thicknesses iv summary in this work we studied the structural and electronic proper ties of pt pzt interfaces with different pbo and tizro 2 ter minations in varied thickness capacitor geometry we showed that the chemical environment at the interface plays a criti cal role in determining the interfacial bonds promoting oxy gen rotation and charge redistribution our findings reveals that the pt pztbo 2 interface is 94 5 mev more energet ically stable than pt pztaoone this is related to strong in terfacial bonds formed at the pt pztbo 2 interfaces while the pt pztao is characterised by weak interfacial bonds we ex pect a suppressed polarisation in the pt pztbo 2 pt capacitors due to a flattening of its outermost atomic layers while the pt pztao pt capacitor shows an enhanced rumpling parame ter at the p interface the ferroelectric state was found to be stable for all thick nesses of pzt films although thin capacitors with the thick ness below 4 5 u c exhibit metal states in the gap figure 6 planar averaged electrostatic potential in a the frozen bulk geometry freestanding ao terminated pzt slab exhibits the drop of potential 1 0 37 v difference between the two asymptotic vac uum potentials is 2 0 54 v b freestanding bo 2 terminated pzt slab with 1 0 35 v vacuum potential drop is 2 0 44 v c ao terminated pzt slab in capacitor geometry exhibits drop of potential of 3 0 14 v d bo 2 terminated pzt slab shows the drop of po tential 3 0 090 v the pt pzt interfaces are characterised by the strong charge redistribution leading to the formation of unequal local dipoles at the p and p interfaces where the pt pztao in terface shows an effectively larger dipole formed than that at the pt pztbo 2 interface the pt pztao ptcapacitor ex hibits a small depolarising field of 0 5 mv while the pt pztbo 2 ptcapacitor shows a depolarising field ten times larger this is caused by the imperfect screening due to strong interfacial bonds formed at the pt pztbo 2 interfaces and sup pressed rumpling of zrtio 2 outermost pzt layer we hope that our findings will provide a guidance to the synthesis of nanoscale capacitors and allow for a better con trol of epitaxial growth of pzt
