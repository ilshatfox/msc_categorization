oxygen doping and polaron magnetic coupling in alq 3 films andrea droghetti 1 2 1 nano bio spectroscopy group and european theoretical spectroscopy facility materials physics center university of the basque country av tolosa 72 20018 san sebastian spain 2 school of physics and crann institute trinity college dublin 2 ireland the understanding of the physics underlying the performances of spin valve devices comprising organic semiconductors is still incomplete according to some recent models spin transport takes place in an impurity band inside the fundamental gap of the organic semiconductor this seems to be confirmed by recent experiments performed with la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co devices the reported results suggest a possible correlation between the magnetoresistance and the variable oxygen doping in the alq 3 spacer in this paper we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of o 2 molecules and ions in alq 3 films by means of first principles calculations to establish whether oxygen plays any important role for spin transport in la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co devices the conclusion is that it does not in fact we show that o 2 molecules do not form an impurity band and there is no magnetic interaction between them in contrast we suggest that spin transport may be enabled by the direct exchange coupling between alq 3 ions i introduction more than a decade ago organic semiconductors oscs were proposed as an ideal medium for spin transport 1 2 owing to their long spin relaxation time 3 since then a large number of experiments have investi gated the performances and the underlying physics of the so called organic spin valve devices which comprise an osc spacer in between two ferromagnetic electrodes 4 some of these experiments have succeeded in measuring magnetoresistance mr 5 10 but at the same time some others have failed 8 11 overall these seemingly contradictory reports show that our understanding of spin injection and transport in oscs is still largely incomplete a few studies unequivocally proved that the injection of spin polarized charge carriers from ferromagnetic metals into oscs could be achieved either optically 12 13 or electrically 14 15 the injection potential barriers were generally estimated of the order of 1 v 10 16 17 these large values however contrast the results of most spin valve experiments where the mr was detected only at low bias voltages 0 1 v 2 5 18 because of this issue one can question whether the measured mr is really due to spin transport over molecular orbitals furthermore we note that the hanle effect which is commonly considered as the ultimate proof of spin injection was reported absent 19 20 while most devices showing mr were surprisingly very conductive 21 with their performances not disrupted by the conductivity mismatch 22 this body of experimental observations has been partly rationalized by using an impurity band model firstly introduced by yu 23 24 in an osc film there are impurities which introduce charge carriers and which give rise to an impurity band inside the osc transport gap at sufficiently high impurity concentrations the charge current is due to hopping of the carriers between impurities concurrently carriers can become localized and unpaired at impurity sites which therefore have a magnetic moment spin current is then enabled by the exchange coupling between these magnetic moments and is carried by spin waves charge and spin propagate through different regions of the film as two fluids 25 with different diffusion constants 23 the impurity band model can qualitatively explain the typical i v characteristic curve of spin valves the dependence of the mr on the bias voltage the absence of the conductivity mismatch problem and of the hanle effect 23 24 furthermore it has been recently used to calculate the spin diffusion length in polymers achieving a remarkable agreement with experimental results 26 during the last few years riminucci et al have in vestigated la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valve devices to validate the impurity model 21 in these devices both the charge carrier density and the mr can be modulated systematically through multilevel resistive switching 27 30 at low carrier concentrations the mr is not observed while it is measured when the carrier concentration is sufficiently high 1019 cm 3 the authors suggested a possible correlation between this behavior and the variable oxygen doping in the alq 3 spacer 31 according to the proposed picture 31 32 the alox tunnel layers incorporate o ions that are trapped near positively charged oxygen vacancies 33 these ions are then able to migrate out of the alox layers under the application of a large several v electrical bias pulse forming o 2 ions and eventually doping the alq 3 film 31 the mr is then measured at low voltages 0 1 v and it is interpreted as a result of spin transport across oxygen states in line with the impurity band model 32 in this paper we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of oxygen molecules o 2 and ions o 2 in alq 3 films by means of first principles calculations to establish whether they play any important role for charge and spin transport the conclusion is that they probably do not specifically we show that o 2 molecules do not form an impurity band furthermore no magnetic interaction is found between pairs of either o 2 or ar x iv 2 10 1 07 30 3 v 1 co nd m at m tr l sc i 1 8 ja n 20 21 2 fig 1 dos calculated by using g 0 w 0 for a o 2 alq 3 com plex the dos projected over the o 2 molecule is in red o 2 in contrast alq 3 ions which have spin 1 2 are exchanged coupled via the interaction of their ligands this exchange coupling which is direct can reach almost room temperature hence we propose that spin transport in la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valves does not involve oxygen states as suggested previously by riminucci et al 32 but it may be enabled by the exchange coupling between alq 3 ions instead ii results a electronic properties to begin with we investigate whether any of the o 2 frontier states lays inside the transport gap of alq 3 even tually giving rise to an impurity band we therefore con sider a cluster comprising an o 2 molecule in close prox imity to an alq 3 molecule see inset of fig 1 and we analyze the relative energy level alignment obtained from first principles calculations all presented calculations are performed by using the all electron code fhi aims 34 36 the atomic positions were optimized by density functional theory dft with the tkatchenko scheffler ts van der waals corrected method 37 until the forces were smaller than 0 01 ev a we consider different initial configurations for o 2 and alq 3 we generally find that o 2 is unlikely to go close to the al center of alq 3 after optimization o 2 always ends up quite far from the alq 3 molecule as for example shown in fig 1 for such alq 3 o 2 separation the elec tronic properties of the cluster are quite independent on the relative position of the two molecules and addition ally they do not depend on the orientation of o 2 we therefore describe here only the results obtained for the cluster in fig 1 the energy level alignment is inferred from the density homo ev lumo ev o 2 11 34 0 37 alq 3 6 37 1 21 table i homo and lumo energies of alq 3 and o 2 calcu lated by c dft of states dos computed with the g 0 w 0 approxima tion of many body perturbation theory 35 36 38 it is im portant to remind that the electronic states in many body perturbation theory can be rigorously interpreted as the quasiparticle excitations measured in photoemis sion experiments unlike the kohn sham states of dft 39 many body perturbation theory therefore represents the appropriate theoretical framework to study energy level alignment in materials the initial state for g 0 w 0 is ob tained from a spin polarized dft calculation with the pbe 0 hybrid exchange correlation functional 40 using the same computation details as in refs 41 42 spin polarized calculations are required to describe o 2 which is a mag netic molecule of spin 1 as we showed in a previous work 42 g 0 w 0 yields excellent results for the occupied spectra of alq 3 compared to experiments similarly it is also expected to provide reliable estimates for the ener gies of unoccupied states although it is hard in practice to achieve the basis set convergence 43 because of that we also use constrained dft c dft 44 47 with the local spin density approximation for the exchange correlation potential as a complementary approach in fact it has been demonstrated that c dft generally returns quite accurate results for the energies of the frontier orbitals of molecules inside crystals and clusters 48 49 specifically the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of alq 3 o 2 is obtained in c dft by calculat ing the opposite of the electron affinity a via the finite energy difference lumo a e e e is the energy of alq 3 o 2 and e is the energy of the anion alq 3 o 2 obtained by enforcing the localization on the molecule of the added electron which otherwise would spread over the whole system in a nonphysical way sim ilarly the energy of highest occupied molecular orbital homo is calculated as the opposite of the ionization potential i according to homo i e e with e the energy of the cation alq 3 o 2 the c dft calcula tions are performed by using the default basis set referred as tight in the fhi aims manual the g 0 w 0 dos is presented in fig 1 where the homo and the lumo of alq 3 and o 2 can be readily recognized we note that since o 2 is magnetic its homo and lumo are respectively spin up and spin down orbitals the c dft estimates are listed in tab i overall the two different methods give results in very good agreement making us confident about the reliability of our predictions the o 2 homo is more than 5 ev below the alq 3 homo and the o 2 lumo is almost 1 ev above the lumo of alq 3 this means that firstly 3 o 2 does not form an impurity band inside the alq 3 transport gap and secondly an extra electron added to the whole system will not reduce o 2 to o 2 but it will rather go into the lumo of alq 3 giving alq 3 hence no o 2 ions are expected in alq 3 films unlike what proposed in refs 31 32 in la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valves if o 2 impurities are driven into the alq 3 film from the alox layers they will donate the electron to an alq 3 molecule this is the first important observation of this paper the energy level alignment studied so far refers to vertical quasi particle excitation energies this means that we neglected the molecular conformational changes induced by the addition of an electron and which increase the electron affinity the energy associated to such ionic effect called inner shell re organization energy 50 and usually labeled can be estimated by subtracting the energy of the anion at the neutral molecule geometry from the energy of the anion at its own relaxed geometry in gas phase 51 we assume that the external reorganization energy is the same for the two molecules and we therefore neglect it the increased electron affinity which is called adiabatic is given by aa a in our calculations we find that is 0 06 ev and 0 49 ev for alq 3 and o 2 respectively the reorganization energy is therefore much larger for o 2 than for alq 3 however aa is lower for o 2 than for alq 3 hence even including ionic contributions the picture presented above remains valid and a dopant electron prefers to reduce alq 3 rather than o 2 in addition to o 2 we also consider the effect of other dopants by performing similar g 0 w 0 calculations it is worth to remark that in this paper we focus only on the electronic structure while understanding possible chemical reactions which are still very much debated 52 is beyond our goals we start by considering a single o atom or o ion these establish a covalent bond with alq 3 during the dft optimization hence we can not have free o in alq 3 films the resulting complex does not for an impurity band and moreover is non magnetic we also introduce a water molecule which is known to be a common intrinsic impurity in alq 3 films however we predict that h 2 o similarly to o 2 does not have any state in the transport gap of alq 3 and therefore it can not give rise to an impurity band finally we also propose some triatomic molecules for example o 3 and no 2 as alternative dopants since these molecules have a large electron affinity they induce an intra gap state in alq 3 for instance the o 3 lumo is at about 3 2 3 4 ev below above the alq 3 lumo homo however as far as we know no evidence for the presence of this type of molecules in alq 3 films has ever been reported and it is not clear what mechanism would be responsible for their incorporation into la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valves in particular because these devices are usually fabricated in ultra high vacuum condition this may deserve more experimental investigations in the future fig 2 exchange coupling j as a function of the distance d between the stacked ligands of two alq 3 ions inset the magnetization isosurface for the alq 3 ions although our g 0 w 0 and c dft calculations are per formed for clusters to limit the computational overhead the results can be readily extrapolated towards those of a film by adding electrostatic polarization effects 53 these will induce only a rigid shift of unoccupied occupied states towards lower higher energies as such they will change the absolute energy position of the various states but not their relative position which is ultimately what we are interested in the polarization induced shift can be calculated by assuming that a molecule is a charged point embedded in a dielectric medium 54 since an alq 3 film has dielectric constant of 3 55 the energy shift is estimated to be about 0 9 ev for unoccu pied occupied states but as just stated this will not change the conclusions drawn in the previous paragraphs b magnetic properties after having addressed the electronic structure of the impurities in alq 3 we now examine the magnetic properties o 2 and o 2 have spin 1 and 1 2 respectively and our calculations correctly reproduce that the main question is whether we can have magnetic interaction be tween pairs of o 2 as required to enable spin transport according to the impurity band model to provide an answer we consider several huge clusters which contain fifteen alq 3 molecules and two o 2 impurities each these clusters differ one from another for the relative po sitions and distances of the o 2 impurities allowing us to study the spatial dependence of the eventual magnetic interaction the atomic positions are fully optimized by using dft with the ts method we then assume that the magnetic interaction between the two impurities can be described through a heisenberg model with the exchange coupling j which is computed by means of the broken symmetry approach 56 as follows we perform a first calculation with the magnetic moments of the two impurities constrained to be parallel p and we obtain 4 the total energy ep afterward we perform a second calculation with anti parallel magnetic moments and we obtain the total energy eap the exchange coupling j is finally given by j ep eap 4 s 56 with s equal to 1 and 1 2 for o 2 and o 2 respectively these calculations are repeated for many clusters however in no case we find a finite j within the accuracy of our calculations 0 1 mev hence we conclude that spin transport in alq 3 does not involve the exchange coupling between oxygen states in contrast to what suggested in refs 31 32 while alq 3 is non magnetic the ion alq 3 has a spin 1 2 with the added electron that is localized over the pyridyl moieties of the ligands 57 59 these therefore become de facto organic radicals since magnetic coupling between radicals in crystals has been reported in a large number of studies and different magnetic coupling mechanisms have been proposed 60 it is interesting to investigate whether any interaction between alq 3 ions is possible as explained above the electrons reducing alq 3 molecules to alq 3 can be donated by o 2 impurities in la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valves since most devices have a large charge carrier concentration it could be that o 2 impurities are already incorporated during the fabrication process on the other hand at low carriers concentration impurities are assumed to be driven into the alq 3 film through a voltage pulse according to the model in ref 31 32 furthermore we note that electrons can also be directly injected into the alq 3 film by such an applied pulse with no need for o 2 or other dopant molecules the exchange coupling between two alq 3 ions is cal culated by means of the broken symmetry approach similarly to what done for the oxygen impurities we highlight that the use of c dft is required not just to force the magnetic moments to be either parallel or anti parallel but also to localize the two added electrons on one molecule each as lsda would otherwise return the electrons to be shared between the two molecules in an unphysical way 61 the results are found not to depend on whether we use the geometry of the neutral molecule or that of the anion in fact the two geometries only differ slightly for the length of the o al and n al bonds while as discussed above the unpaired electron of alq 3 is localized on the ligands and not along those bonds j is found to be non zero and ferromagnetic j 0 when the ligands of the two ions are stacked in a configuration as shown in the inset of fig 2 importantly this relative arrangement of the molecules is also the energetically most favorable one as the overlap between the ions wave functions is maximized j is equal to 4 5 mev which corresponds to about 50 k at the calculated equilibrium geometry for which the distance d between the stacked ligands is 3 35 a j is remarkably large when compared to the typical exchange coupling calculated for radicals 60 furthermore we note that the considered equilibrium geometry is for a two ion cluster in vacuum we expect that alq 3 molecules will be more tightly packed in a device and therefore d will be shorter j can reach almost room temperature for d 2 0 a this is a quite short distance for stacked systems but we note that c dft may underestimate j by enforcing a too large localization of the wave functions as such our results represent conservative estimates the predicted non zero and eventually large exchange coupling between two alq 3 ions is the second important result of this paper the large j value is because the exchange coupling is direct and not the result of the kinetic mechanisms often invoked in the case of radicals 60 the plot of j as a function of d is shown in fig 2 the curve has a shape similar to the bethe slater curve describing the direct exchange coupling between atomic orbitals of transition metals it presents a maximum at d 1 96 a around which it is well approximated by a quadratic function in contrast at large d 3 5 a j decays exponentially according to ce d with 2 04 a 1 and c 3 4 ev such exponential decay at large distances is qualitatively consistent with what assumed by yu in its original impurity band model however he considered the impurities to have hydrogen like wave functions instead of being stacked molecules and this leads to quantitative variations in the parameters differently from yu s original model we proposed in ref 25 the exchange coupling to be indirect rather the direct the results will be reconsidered based on our new first principles predictions in the future there is an issue that we have neglected so far namely that having two charged molecules at a close distance is unlikely as they will repel each other therefore at low carrier concentrations alq 3 ions will be far apart in order to minimize their electrostatic interaction and there will be no magnetic coupling between them only when the concentration of the electrons is large enough these will localize on neighbor molecules which will then be exchanged coupled in fact in experiments the mr is detected only for carriers concentrations of the order of 1019 cm 321 32 if we model an alq 3 molecule as a sphere of radius 12 a we will see that this is a huge concentration which corresponds to one electron per ten molecules since each molecule can be surrounded my about nine other molecules it is unavoidable to find nearest neighbor alq 3 ions for such a high electron concentration summarizing we suggest that alq 3 ions which are exchange coupled are present in la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valves and can carry a spin current in accordance to the impurity band model we point out that our calculations are for systems in equilibrium and there is no applied electric field the results might therefore be valid only in the very low bias regime which is anyway when the mr is measured for large bias voltages we expect that electrons will be driven and there might be a strong electron density delocalization as discussed for example 5 in ref 62 this means that dopant electrons will not stay tightly bound to alq 3 forming alq 3 ions this might explain the absence of the mr finally we note that spin transport through alq 3 films was also demonstrated in spin pumping experiments 63 the results provided a strong evidence that the spin current was propagated by spin waves and they were explained by means of the impurity band model by yu notably the estimated carriers concentration in these experiments is similar to that needed to observed the mr in spin valves therefore we propose that spin transport involves exchange coupled alq 3 ions also in those spin pumping experiments iii conclusions based on the results of first principles calculations we propose that spin transport in la 0 7 sr 0 3 mno 3 alq 3 alox co spin valves does not involve oxygen states we then suggest the following alternative picture to explain the mr reported in devices if electrons are injected into the alq 3 film via a voltage pulse they will reduce some of the alq 3 molecules to alq 3 ions these are magnetic and if their concentration is high enough they will become exchange coupled and percolate across the film spin current is then carried by spin waves according to the impurity band model acknowledgment this work started at the
