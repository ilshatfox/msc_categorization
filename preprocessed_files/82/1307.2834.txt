minimal average standardized riesz pair energies vs n of n point configurations on the sphere s 2 for various s r the standardized riesz pair energy of a pair of points on s 2 a chordal distance r apart is vs r s 1 r s 1 s 6 0 which becomes v 0 r ln 1 r in the limit s 0 averaging it over the n 2 distinct pairs in a configuration and minimizing over all possible n point configurations defines vs n it is known that n 7 vs n is strictly increasing for each s r and for s 2 also bounded above thus overall concave it is easily proved that n 7 v 2 n is even locally strictly concave and that so is the map 2 n 7 vs 2 n for s 2 by analyzing computer experimental data of putatively minimal average riesz pair energies vxs n for s 1 0 1 2 3 and n 2 200 it is found that the map n 7 vx 1 n is locally strictly concave while n 7 vxs n is not always locally strictly concave for s 0 1 2 3 concavity defects occur whenever n cx s an s specific empirical set of integers it is found that the empirical map s 7 cx s s 2 1 0 1 2 3 is set theoretically increasing moreover the percentage of odd numbers in cx s s 0 1 2 3 is found to increase with s the integers in cx 0 are few and far between forming a curious sequence of numbers reminiscent of the magic numbers in nuclear physics it is conjectured that these new magic numbers are associated with optimally symmetric optimal log energy n point configurations on s 2 a list of interesting open problems is extracted from the empirical findings and some rigorous first steps toward their solutions are presented it is emphasized how concavity can assist in the solution to smale s 7 th problem which asks for an efficient algorithm to find near optimal n point configurations on s 2 and higher dimensional spheres typeset in latex by the authors

physics to com puter science one encounters n point optimization problems for which the following one is archetypical consider n 2 distinct points on the two sphere s 2 any such n point configuration will be denoted by n s 2 the positions of the n points are conveniently given by vectors qk r 3 of euclidean length qk 1 k 1 n so that qi qj is the chordal distance between the two points in the pair i j any pair i j is now assigned a standardized riesz pair energy 1 vs qi qj with vs r s 1 r s 1 s r s 6 0 1 v 0 r ln r lim s 0 vs r 2 the average standardized riesz pair energy of a configuration is given by vs n 2 n n 1 1 i j n vs qi qj 3 and the minimal average standardized riesz pair energy by 2 vs n inf n s 2 vs n 4 the problem is to determine vs n together with the minimizing configuration s s n also known as n tuple of elliptic s fekete points 3 whenever such exist 4 for the convenience of the non expert reader in our appendix a we present a brief survey of this intriguingly beautiful and rich but also challengingly hard mathematical problem to which nobody knows the general solution only for one distinguished value of s has this problem been solved for all n and only for a few n values has it been conquered for all s also computers are soon overwhelmed when n becomes large indeed as apparently first noticed in erho 97 computer assisted searches see e g rsz 94 rsz 95 aetal 97 petal 97 erho 97 bcnt 02 bcnt 06 betal 07 1 traditionally the riesz pair energy is defined as v s r r s for s 6 0 and v 0 r ln r for s 0 this has the disadvantages that v 0 r 6 lims 0 v s r and that one has to seek energy minimizing configurations for s 0 yet energy maximizing ones for s 0 2 our vs n equals 2 s n where s n denotes the so called pair specific ground state energy in physics cf eysp 93 kie 09 a kie 09 b while s n is indeed a physically meaningful quantity its attribute pair specific is a misnomer it should actually refer to the statistically meaningful vs n for the number of different pairs is n n 1 2 3 originally m fekete cf fek 23 studied points from an infinite compact set in the complex plane that maximize the product of all mutual distances which is equivalent to minimizing the average standardized riesz pair energy for s 0 4 by the lower semi continuity of the standardized riesz pair energy and the compactness of the sphere there always exist n labeled points not necessarily pairwise different if s 2 whose average pair energy equals vs n a minimizing set of n labeled points is not a proper minimizing n point configuration unless all points are pairwise different 2 waul 06 wma 09 for the minimizing configuration s suggest that the number of local minimum energy configurations most of which are not globally minimizing grows exponentially 5 with n an exponential proliferation of local minimizers and by implication of critical points eliminates the possibility of a polynomial in n algorithm which first solves the algebraic problem of finding all critical points then evaluates their energies and finally picks the lowest energy configuration s amongst all critical points 6 since it is so difficult to find the optimizing configurations one may need to settle for less and employ computer assisted random searches 7 unfortunately with increasing likelihood when n becomes large a practically feasible random search will find only one of these exponentially many non global minima without guarantee of its energy being close to the optimum this is not good enough what one wants is a controlled approximation smale s 7 th problem sma 98 is formulated in this spirit find an algorithm which upon input n in polynomial time returns a configuration n on s 2 whose average standardized riesz pair energy does not deviate from the optimal value obtained with sn by more than a certain conjectured s specific function of n remark 1 smale s problem was originally posed for s 0 viz v 0 r ln r and then not for the average logarithmic pair energy but for the total logarithmic energy of the n point configurations i e for e 0 n n 2 v 0 n the s specific function of n in this original formulation is the fourth term of the partially proved partially conjectured large n asymptotic expansion of the optimal logarithmic energy of n point configurations on s 2 rsz 94 rsz 95 e 0 n an 2 bn lnn cn d lnn o 1 5 with a 1 4 ln e 4 and b 1 4 rigorously known and with rigorous upper and lower bounds on c and numerical estimates for d given in rsz 94 for an update see bhs 12 8 the coefficient d in smale s problem is unspecified and allowed to be bigger than any asymptotically determined d 9 subsequently smale extended his problem to s 0 2 and he remarked that anal ogous problems can be formulated for higher dimensional spheres sd d 3 4 5 the growth rate should have a significance similar to the complexity of the energy landscape see wal 04 studies of the riesz s energy landscape for n point configurations on s 2 have only begun recently see cetal 13 and references therein 6 for an exponential time algorithm which provides rational points on the sphere whose logarith mic energy differs from the optimal value by at most 1 9 see proposition 1 11 in bel 13 a 7 a good collection of existing search algorithms can be found at the website bcgmz 8 in bhs 12 it is conjectured that c ln 2 2 3 1 4 3 4 1 3 3 2 recently a rigorous de termination of c for weighted logarithmic fekete problems in r 2 to which the logarithmic fekete problem on s 2 is related by stereographic projection was given in sase 13 unfortunately their con ditions on the weights barely miss the weight obtained by stereographic projection note added after submission of the revised version of our paper we were informed by laurent be termin that in bet 14 the order n term in 5 is proved with the sandier serfaty method see also bezh 14 9 currently only numerical evidence is available for the fourth term in the putative asymptotic expansion and it is also conceivable that this term is actually not truly asymptotic 3 to the best of our knowledge no algorithm has yet been found which delivers what smale is asking for 10 instead as already mentioned when n gets too large random searches 11 and educated guesses inevitably also of the type trial and error are employed which produce many different local energy minimizers for the same n amongst which the one with the lowest energy is a putatively energy optimizing configuration until a better one is found eventually perhaps in this situation it becomes important to search for necessary criteria that can test those configurations which have produced the lowest energy amongst all empirically found configurations with a given n for their potential optimality we emphasize that such types of tests can only identify non optimal data but not confirm optimal ones one such test based on the strict monotonic increase of n 7 vs n see lan 72 for a proof 12 was proposed and carried out successfully in kie 09 b there about two dozen experimentally found putatively minimal energies vxs n were identified in publically available lists of empirical data at which the empirical map n 7 vxs n failed to be monotonically increasing hence these data could not possibly be true minimal energies vs n making it plain that it was is worth an effort to do better of course all empirical maps n 7 vxs n which we analyzed in this paper we also tested for whether they strictly increase all data passed this first derivative test remark 2 incidentally also the map s 7 vs n is strictly monotonically increasing see appendix c for a proof supplying another necessary criterion for optimality of putative standardized riesz pair energy minimizers all empirical maps s 7 vxs n which we analyzed in this paper we also tested for whether they strictly increase all data passed this first derivative test too the main purpose of the present paper is to report the results of our quest for additional tests in form of necessary criteria for minimality based not on the first but on the second discrete derivative of n 7 vs n our point of departure was the observation that strict monotonic increase of n 7 vs n in concert with its boundedness above for s 2 a simple variational estimate implies that the overall shape of the graph n vs n n 2 3 must be concave in the large for each s 2 this raised the question whether this graph is perhaps even locally at each n 2 strictly concave when s 2 moreover although vs n is not bounded above for s 2 the leading order terms of the asymptotic large n expansion of vs n namely v 2 n lnn kusa 98 and vs n n s 2 2 for s 2 hasa 05 are strictly locally concave for 2 s 4 so that it was even conceivable that so was 10 for a state of the art survey see bel 13 b 11 for a link to random polynomials see abs 11 in particular see their thm 0 2 12 when the monotonicity proof was recently rediscovered kie 09 a kie 09 b that author remarked kie 09 b p 276 that the monotonic increase of n 7 vs n and its proof are quite elementary and presumably known yet after a serious search in the pertinent literature i came up empty handed cf also kie 09 a p 1188 m k likes to thank ed saff for subsequently pointing out to him that the monotonicity result and its proof were already given in lan 72 indeed happily the applications of the monotonicity presented in kie 09 a and kie 09 b were novel 4 n 7 vs n so the question we asked ourselves was whether the discrete second derivative of vs n given by v s n vs n 1 2 vs n vs n 1 n 2 6 is perhaps strictly negative for all n 2 when s 2 or possibly even when s 4 clearly knowledge of any s values for which the map n 7 vs n is everywhere strictly concave will yield a necessary criterion for minimality that can be fielded as a test for lists of empirical data of those putatively minimal riesz s energies remark 3 as with smale s 7 th problem analogous concavity questions can be raised about the minimal average riesz s energy vs n for the higher dimensional spheres s d d 3 4 and also for the circle s 1 although no optimality test for putative minimizers on s 1 is needed all optimizers with n 2 and s 2 are explicitly known see bhs 09 interestingly enough for the problem on s 1 the n dependence of n 7 vs n is polynomial for special s values bra 11 in particular the map n 7 v 2 n is affine linear furthermore our own partly analytical partly numerical studies of the explicit finite sum formulas for vs n strongly support the conjecture that n 7 vs n is locally strictly concave for s 2 2 and locally strictly convex for s 2 indeed what we found out about the minimal average riesz s energy vs n for s 2 mostly empirically yet partly rigorously went beyond our expectations including not only strict concavity of the theoretical map n 7 vs n respectively the empirical map n 7 vxs n for some s values but also hints at a monotonic increase with s of the set of convexity points whenever concavity of vxs n failed suggesting novel and unexpected test criteria for optimality in particular the hypothesis that the empirically suggested monotonicities are factual has led us to discover in a published data list three non optimal data points which had not previously been detected more precisely we readily affirmed the strict concavity of n 7 vs n for the special value s 2 for which the problem of the elliptic s fekete points is exactly solvable for all n cf appendix a thus simply by differentiating the expression 109 for v 2 n twice one gets a strictly negative expression for the second discrete derivative furthermore twofold discrete differentiation of vs 2 n when s 2 see 110 showed that also 2 n 7 vs 2 n is strictly locally concave for s 2 of course this does not prove that n 7 vs n is strictly concave for all n 2 when s 2 but it suggests that one may be able to prove it rigorously this already exhausts the s values for which we were able to rigorously prove some strict local concavity result unfortunately the regime s 2 is of rather academic interest in particular for the exactly solvable case s 2 one does not need any necessary criteria for minimality to test putative optimizers the practically interesting regime is s 2 in the absence of any closed form expressions of vs n for s 2 we decided to gather some experimental input and turned to the empirical data published in erho 97 hss 94 rsz 95 cal 09 and waul and to those publicly available at the 5 website bcgmz some of which we generated ourselves by carefully scrutinizing these data lists we discovered that strict local concavity of n 7 vs n may in fact hold for s 1 but not for s 0 1 2 3 we then proved quasi rigorously for s 0 1 2 3 rigorously for s 10 that local concavity of n 7 vs n fails we then inspected the sets of the n values at which v xs n 0 more closely empirically we found that these sets were set theoretically increasing with s except for two relatively large n values namely n 177 and n 197 when s was 2 or 3 since the empirical data become less trustworthy the larger n becomes and also the larger s becomes we used the thomson applet at bcgmz to see whether we could find configurations with lower energy using an educated guess as input configuration for n 177 and n 197 happily we succeeded and when we used these better energy data points for n 177 and n 197 at s 2 respectively 3 those n values were no longer exceptions to the empirical overall monotonic increase of the sets of the n values at which v xs n 0 to summarize we have collected empirical evidence for the following conjectures conjecture 1 the map n 7 v 1 n is locally strictly concave for all n 2 conjecture 2 when s 0 1 2 3 the map n 7 vs n is not locally strictly concave and the set of n values at which strict concavity fails is expanding with s clearly if proven true these regularities will serve as useful test criteria for optimality of empirical large n configurations at the above s values yet our empirical findings also suggest a catalog of interesting new questions for general s values a catalog of interesting questions and some partial answers to pose our questions sharply we define several new quantities first of all for each s we partition the integer subset n 2 into three mutually disjoint subsets the set of strict local concavity c s the set of strict local convexity c s and the set of local linearity c 0 s defined as c s n 2 v s n 0 7 c s n 2 v s n 0 8 c 0 s n 2 v s n 0 9 respectively we note that c s c 0 s c s n 2 we are now ready to raise our first mathematical question empirically we found that cx 0 cx 1 cx 2 cx 3 thus we ask q 1 is s 7 c s s r monotonic increasing in the sense of set theoretic inclusion if the answer to q 1 is affirmative then this set theoretical monotonicity supplies a potentially useful test for optimality of putative energy minimizers for any real s not just for the handful of integer s values which we have studied empirically in particular it would imply that c s for all s 2 for c 2 and even 6 for all s 1 if conjecture 1 is true more precisely an affirmative answer to q 1 would imply that for some s 2 one has c s whenever s s incidentally by itself this would not yet imply strict local concavity of the map n 7 vs n for s s only local concavity because we cannot conclude that c 0 s would be empty for all s s 13 yet we suspect that in fact c 0 s for all s s to address the question of strict local concavity of n 7 vs n independently of whether or not the answer to q 1 is affirmative we define s as follows s sup s c 0 s c s s s 10 note that the sup cannot be a max because for any fixed configuration n the map s 7 vs n is a c function which implies that the map s 7 vs n is a c 0 function c regularity of s 7 vs n should hold almost everywhere but for each n 2 the minimizing configuration may change discontinuously at some s value s at which only c 0 regularity can be guaranteed alternatively s is defined as s inf s v s n 0 for at least one n 2 11 and inf min if and only if s thus we ask q 2 is s q 3 if s then what is the value of s because of the strict local concavity of the maps n 7 v 2 n and 2 n 7 vs 2 n for s 2 we not only suspect that s but that s 2 in fact the strict local concavity of the empirical map n 7 vx 1 n even suggests that s 1 while the violations of strict local concavity by the empirical map n 7 vx 0 n suggest that s 0 if confirmed that s 2 0 strict local concavity of n 7 vs n can be fielded as rigorous test criterion for optimality of putative optimizers for s s even though only s 2 s would seem to be of practical interest if s then c s for s s and c 0 s for s s but not for s s this leads us to now define the critical set of local linearity l c 0 s if s 12 assuming that s we now expand our list of mathematical questions q 4 is the set l finite or infinite q 5 can one explicitly compute the set l q 6 which optimal configurations correspond to the set l 13 of course as a test criterion for empirical data concavity or strict concavity are equally fine 7 again supposing that s there are then also interesting questions to ask about the regime s s in particular since n is countable while r is not the continuity of s 7 v s n suggests that c 0 s is empty almost everywhere w r t lebesgue measure thus it is natural to ask q 7 is the set of s values for which c 0 s 6 finite or infinite q 8 can one compute the set of s values at which c 0 s 6 as with l one can raise similar questions for all non empty c 0 s thus q 9 for each non empty c 0 s is it finite or infinite q 10 for each non empty c 0 s can one compute it q 11 for each non empty c 0 s which configurations does it represent questions q 2 q 11 do not presuppose that q 1 is answered affirmatively yet if the answer to q 1 is affirmative then both lims c s c and lims c s c exist in particular then c c s s s with s 2 as we already know as for the opposite limit since the large n asymp totics of vs n is locally strictly convex for s 4 hasa 05 it is tempting to speculate whether there exists s such that the map n 7 vs n itself is locally strictly convex for all s s which would mean that c n 1 2 c s s s equivalently c s for all s s however we shall provide partly rigorous partly numerical evidence for c 6 n 1 2 so c if it exists is likely more complicated and more interesting than the full set of admissible integers n 1 2 thus under the hypothesis that q 1 is answered affirmatively we also ask q 12 can one explicitly characterize c finally the question of s persists q 13 does there exist an s such that c s c for all s s q 14 if yes can one compute s all these questions are presumably quite difficult to answer in any event it is reasonable to expect valuable insights even from partial answers for example to answer q 2 and also q 3 conditional on an affirmative answer for q 2 one may want to try proving a negative upper bound on v s n for all s below some critical value any upper bound on v s n obtained in the process even if not negative would offer a test criterion for optimality in this vein in subsection 4 2 of this paper we prove the following bounds 8 proposition 1 for s 0 the second discrete derivative of vs n is bounded above and below as follows 2 n 1 n 2 vs n 1 s v s n 2 n 1 n vs n 1 s of course our proposition 1 is not strong enough to offer an answer even to q 2 coming to q 3 we will provide some quasi rigorous upper bounds on s we already mentioned that the large n asymptotics of the map n 7 vs n is strictly convex for s 4 hasa 05 which implies that s 4 yet empirically from the analysis of putative minimizers we expect that s 0 indeed with the help of the partly empirically partly rigorously known optimizers for n 5 7 in the range s 0 2 and the rigorously known optimizer for n 6 in subsection 3 5 we will prove the following proposition 2 under the assumption that for n 5 7 the optimizing config urations in the range s 0 2 are given by the regular triangular and pentagonal bi pyramids respectively one has s 0 we will rigorously prove proposition 2 yet the bound on s in proposition 2 is called quasi rigorous for the named configurations are not rigorously known to be optimizers for all s 0 2 although there can be hardly any doubt that they are with the help of the rigorously known optimizing configurations for n 4 6 and the only partly rigorously known hence putatively optimizing configurations for n 5 in the respective ranges s 2 s and s s with s 15 04807 in subsection 4 4 we will also supply partly rigorous and partly numerical evidence for conjecture 3 under the assumption that the optimizing configurations for n 5 in the range s 2 are given by the regular triangular bi pyramid when s s and the square pyramid with adjusted height when s s we have that s 2 v s 5 0 thus while it is locally strictly concave for s 2 and presumably for all s 2 and possibly for all s 1 the map n 7 vs n is very likely not locally strictly convex for any s even though its large n asymptotics is when s 4 so as for q 12 very likely c if it exists is not n 1 2 we have mentioned large n asymptotics several times already we ourselves shall produce several well motivated conjectures that relate the concavity of n 7 vs n to its asymptotics at large n for which even computer assisted searches of the optimal n point configurations are hopeless we defer stating our conjectures to section 5 for we need technical preparations beyond the scope of this introduction our last remark makes it plain that we consider our mathematical questions to be of theoretical interest in their own right too irrespective of whether some test for 9 empirical data will ensue from their answers or not in this spirit we also raise an intriguing question which cannot be so sharply formulated magic numbers optimally optimal configurations for s 0 the smallest s value for which we found empirical violations of strict local n concavity i e for the logarithmic pair interaction invoked in the original formulation of smale s 7 th problem the violations of strict local concavity were few and far between they occurred at the following experimental sequence of integers c x 0 6 12 24 32 48 60 67 72 80 104 108 122 132 137 13 curiously the majority of the numbers in the sequence 13 are multiples of 6 un derlined or almost multiples like 67 and 137 coincidence we note that the logarithmic energy minimizers for the first two integers of convexity i e n 6 and n 12 are two optimally symmetric configurations namely platonic polyhedra the octahedron n 6 and icosahedron n 12 also the putative minimizers for n 24 48 60 are highly symmetric configurations in particular the one for n 24 is an archimedean polyhedron also for n 48 60 there are archimedean polyhedra but these are not log energy optimizers to be sure there is an integer inbetween which is not divisible by 6 namely n 32 the highly symmetric optimizer is a catalan polyhedron and also the odd balls n 67 and of all integers n 137 show up yet assuming that cx 0 c 0 it is an intriguing thought that the n values in c 0 may correspond to log energy optimizing configurations which are optimally symmetric in the following sense most of the log energy optimizing configurations associated with cx 0 are separated by longer n intervals in which n 7 vx 0 n is strictly concave this suggests that perhaps the configurations in an interval of concavity form a family of more and more symmetric optimizers which better and better approximate a highly symmetric endpoint configuration once an endpoint configuration is reached the addition of the next point inevitably will destroy a high amount of symmetry for which an extra large amount of energy may be required these concave families would thus be vaguely analogous to the periods in the so called periodic table of the chemical atoms the endpoints of the periods are the chemically very inert noble gases which are associated with highly symmetric electronic configurations 14 about the nuclei with charge number z 2 10 18 incidentally also the atomic nuclei seem to form something akin to periods in the sense that the set of nucleon numbers 2 8 20 28 50 82 126 is associated with nuclei that have a particular high binding energy per nucleon this set of nucleon numbers is known as the magic numbers of nuclear physics 15 by analogy we call the set c 0 for now c x 0 the magic numbers of smale s 7 th problem 14 actually what is symmetric is the structure of the wave function of the electrons 15 since there are protons and neutrons in the nucleus some nuclei are doubly magic 10 the structure of the remaining sections in section 2 we present the details of our analysis of the data of hss 94 rsz 95 cal 09 bcgmz waul which induced us to formulate questions q 1 q 14 in section 3 we address q 3 obtaining quasi rigorous upper bounds on s more to the point we give a computer assisted proof of proposition 2 for this we explicitly compute the putative expressions for s 7 v s n for n 3 4 5 6 when s runs through certain intervals in which these functions are elementary easily discussed and readily evaluated with maple mathematica or matlab with the help of the exactly computable s 7 v s 3 we also show rigorously that c s is nonempty whenever s 10 s in section 4 we prove various rigorous upper and lower bounds on v s n which go to zero like a power of n when n and s 0 in particular we prove proposition 1 we re emphasize that our upper and lower bounds can serve for testing optimality of putative energy minimizers while our rigorous bounds are not strong enough to prove negativity of v s n uniformly in n 2 for any s 2 we do rigorously prove negativity of v s n for n 4 6 in some regime of negative s values 2 by taking advantage of the explicitly known optimizers for these n values and for n 2 we also obtain a rigorous upper bound for s 7 v s 12 but this bound is positive because the control of the opitimizers for n 11 13 is too weak we also vindicate conjecture 3 in section 5 we present an asymptotic analysis of n 7 v s n for the large n regime and produce several well motivated conjectures that relate the concavity of n 7 vs n to the large n asymptotics the character of the asymptotics depends on whether s is in the potential regime s 2 2 in the hypersingular regime s 2 or exactly inbetween at the singular s 2 a discussion of the degeneracy regime s 2 will be left for some future work in section 6 we summarize our findings and suggest future inquiries in appendix a we briefly survey some distinguished minimal riesz s energy problems for n point configurations on s 2 and the pertinent literature in appendix b we prove relations 111 and 112 needed in appendix a in appendix c we prove the strict monotonic increase of s 7 vs n in appendix d we include a brief study of data of spherical digital nets 11 2 data analysis for s 1 0 1 2 3 and n 200 there are many studies of putatively minimal standardized riesz s energies but only a few feature data lists for consecutive n values which are sufficiently long for our purposes in erho 97 the first 110 consecutive data for the thomson problem s 1 are reported similarly on the website hss 94 the first 130 consecutive data for s 1 are listed 16 and on the website waul 06 391 consecutive data for s 1 starting with n 10 are reported all these are never worse than those of erho 97 in rsz 95 one finds the first 200 consecutive data for s 1 0 1 and these authors remark that their data for s 1 agree with those of hss 94 for the same n values m calef in his thesis cal 09 lists 180 consecutive data for minimizing configurations starting at n 20 covering the cases s 0 1 2 3 he also identified the number of stable configurations observed during many trials in 16 cases the obtained results for s 0 and 1 differed by more than 10 6 compared to results in rsz 95 s 0 and 1 and mdh 96 s 1 some lower and some higher than those of these other two works on the interactive website bcgmz putatively minimal riesz energies are reported for s 0 1 12 yet for variously many consecutive n values although there one finds consecutive data for s 0 and s 1 up to n in the thousands data become less trustworthy with increasing n 17 yet whenever a user finds a lower energy than previously observed this new record holder is substituted for the old one we chose to work with about 200 numerical data each for s 1 0 1 2 3 in each case we selected the lowest energy data available from any of the mentioned lists thus for s 1 0 1 we worked with the data from rsz 95 except that for s 0 and 1 we replaced a few data points by lower energy data from cal 09 for s 1 they agree with those at waul 06 for s 2 3 and n 20 200 we used the data from cal 09 supplemented by data from bcgmz for s 2 3 and 18 n 3 19 however for s 3 consecutive data were available at bcgmz only for n 3 12 together with data for n 16 18 19 so we used the applet bcgmz to create our own experimental s 3 data for n 13 14 15 17 moreover we also used the applet bcgmz to create our own experimental s 2 and 3 data for n 177 and 197 improving over those reported in cal 09 see below the experimental data exs n reported in rsz 95 cal 09 bcgmz and in the other above cited publications have been computed with the conventional riesz s energy we converted the data into putatively minimal average standardized riesz pair energies using the formula vxs n 1 s 2 n n 1 e x s n 1 for s 1 1 2 3 when s 0 only multiplication by 2 n n 1 was required to obtain vx 0 n since the forward derivative n 7 v s n vs n 1 vs n is strictly increasing for each s 1 0 1 2 3 we first checked whether vxs n 1 vxs n n for all 0 n n 2 all data that we pooled together 19 for each s value passed this test 16 save the exactly computable data for n 2 and n 3 17 for n 200 failures of monotonicity were spotted in some data lists at bcgmz cf kie 09 b 18 we have completed all lists by computing vs 2 1 s 2 s 1 whenever necessary 19 the data lists are given in a supplementary section after the bibliography 12 2 1 plots of vxs n and v x s n vs n a first impression was gained by plotting vxs n versus n for n 2 200 and s 1 0 1 2 3 20 the easy to prove ordering see appendix c vs n vt n for s t 14 suggested to us to plot all five graphs n vxs n s 1 0 1 2 3 of the empirical data jointly into a single figure see fig 1 which shows a the graph n vx 1 n computed with consecutive data for ex 1 n from rsz 95 b the graphs n v x 0 n and n vx 1 n both computed with consecutive data for e x 0 n respectively e x 1 n pooled from rsz 95 cal 09 and c the graphs n vx 2 n and n v x 3 n both computed with consecutive data for exs n s 2 3 pooled from cal 09 and bcgmz all data points with the same s value are joined by thin solid lines to guide the eye fig 1 reveals that vx 1 n v x 0 n v x 1 n v x 2 n v x 3 n thus all empirical data that entered fig 1 pass the test implied by 14 cf remark 2 0 50 100 150 200 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 n vs x figure 1 the empirical functions vxs n vs n for s 1 0 1 2 3 fig 1 reveals also that the five empirical graphs n 7 vxs n s 1 0 1 2 3 are strictly increasing as already mentioned above and overall concave as they should furthermore to the human eye the empirical map n 7 vxs n appears to be strictly locally concave for s 1 0 while convexity defects seem to occur for s 1 2 3 interestingly the online version of fig 1 allows one to zoom in re enforcing the impression about strict concavity vs convexity defects of course 20 for s 0 and 1 see respectively also fig s 1 and 2 in kie 09 b 13 the human eye can only distinguish so much 21 so we next plotted the second discrete derivative v xs n for s 1 0 1 2 3 and n 3 199 shown in fig 2 is the graph n v x 1 n for 2 n 200 together with a zoom in of the domain 100 n 200 since the amplitude of v x 1 n decays from about 10 1 to less than 10 6 when n ranges from 3 to 199 no single plot can show the global structure of the graph as well as its fine structure the data v x 1 n in fig 2 remain below the n axis confirming the impression that n 7 vx 1 n is strictly locally concave 0 50 100 150 200 0 15 0 10 0 05 0 00 n v 1 x 100 150 200 2 5 10 6 0 figure 2 v x 1 n as a function of n the solid line is drawn to guide the eye while fig s 1 and 2 do show strict local concavity of n 7 vx 1 n we also confirmed the optical impression of the strict local concavity of the empirical function n 7 vx 1 n with a refined data analysis see below the strict local concavity of n 7 vx 1 n for 2 n 200 can be taken as mild empirical support for our conjecture 1 that n 7 v 1 n is strictly locally concave also the plot of n 7 vx 0 n in fig 1 does look pretty much strictly concave everywhere however the graph of n 7 v x 0 n shown in fig 3 for n 3 199 reveals that the graph of n 7 vx 0 n is not locally strictly concave despite the strictly concave optical appearance of n 7 vx 0 n tiny violations of concavity occur every now and then in fact already when n is less than a dozen the positivity of some small n data in the graph of n 7 vx 0 n is clearly visible but not for n larger than a dozen say because the amplitude of v xs n now decays from a value of order 10 1 to less than 10 5 when n ranges from 3 to 199 to aid the visualization in the global graph we plotted positive data points with black filled diamonds negative ones with blue filled circles colors online again we also inserted a zoom in for the 21 in addition the limited resolution of the plotting programs can yield deceptive plots 14 domain 100 n 200 note the different vertical scale 0 50 100 150 200 0 08 0 06 0 04 0 02 0 00 n v 0 x 100 150 200 1 10 5 0 1 10 5 figure 3 v x 0 n as a function of n the solid line is drawn to guide the eye we already mentioned that zooming into fig 1 reveals that neither of the graphs n 7 vxs n s 1 2 3 appears locally strictly concave not even to the human eye indeed the graphs n v xs n for n 3 199 and s 1 2 3 clearly cross the v xs n 0 axis many times see fig s 4 5 and 6 which are designed like fig 3 0 50 100 150 200 0 04 0 03 0

function of n the solid line is drawn to guide the eye since the minimizing configurations for n less than a dozen or so have been determined numerically with a high degree of confidence the empirical violations of strict local concavity for s 0 1 2 3 at the smaller n values do not seem to be due to incorrect computations of the minimal average pair energies 16 2 2 the sets cx s we next inspected the numerical data of the second discrete derivative v xs n v s n v s n where v s n vs n vs n 1 is the first backward derivative for n 3 199 and s 1 0 1 2 3 for each of these s values we have collected the n values at which v xs n 0 22 into the empirical set cx s empirically we thereby found the following experimental sets of convexity c x 1 15 c x 0 6 12 24 32 48 60 67 72 80 104 108 122

184 187 192 195 197 here the numbers n 177 marked bold in cx 3 and n 197 marked bold in c x s for s 2 3 were absent when we used the data of cal 09 but appeared after we replaced the corresponding energy data from cal 09 with lower energy data discovered ourselves by using the applet bcgmz the reason for why we became suspicious of those data in cal 09 is explained next namely inspection of the empirical sets s 7 cx s reveals a quite interesting property the map s 7 cx s increases set theoretically more precisely before replacing the data of cal 09 for n 177 when s 3 and for n 197 when s 2 3 with lower energy data obtained with the help of the applet bcgmz we had noticed that the map s 7 cx s seemed to be mostly increasing set 22 we note that it is futile to look for n values for which v xs n 0 in the empirical data 17 theoretically with the exception of exactly those three data points thus we found that cx 0 cx 1 whereas c x 1 cx 0 4 18 20 22 27 44 50 62 75 77 78 88 94 96 98 100 111 112 117 127 135 141 144 155 159 160 162 170 174 180 184 197 20 and without the bold data we found cx 1 cx 2 197 whereas c x 2 cx 1 10 28 30 34 40 45 51 54 56 70 83 90 92 106 115 130 148 157 171 175 177 21 and finally without the bold data we found cx 2 cx 3 177 whereas c x 3 cx 2 8 9 14 36 42 63 124 143 165 178 22 so restricted ton 176 and to s 2 1 0 1 2 3 the map s 7 cx s increased set theoretically also cx s 178 196 increased set theoretically curiously n 177 cx 2 but 177 6 cx 3 without the bold data even more curious was the fact that n 197 cx 1 but 197 6 cx 2 and 197 6 cx 3 without the bold data since these non monotonic outliers occurred for quite large n values it was tempting to conjecture that s 7 c s may actually increase set theoretically to test this hypothesis we tried to beat calef s n 177 data for s 3 and n 197 data for s 2 and s 3 cf cal 09 we achieved this goal by loading the presumably optimal s 1 configurations for n 177 and n 197 respectively and evaluated their riesz s energies for s 2 and s 3 these new data are now available at bcgmz with these new bold data in place for those of cal 09 the set theoretical differences became cx 1 cx 2 as well as cx 2 cx 3 while the set theoretical differences cx 2 cx 1 and cx 3 cx 2 remained as shown in 21 and 22 we summarize with the best available data in place the empirical map s 7 c x s s 1 0 1 2 3 increases strictly set theoretically this is the basis of our conjecture 2 that the actual map s 7 c s s r increases set theoretically the increase of the map s 7 cx s becomes easier discernable by collecting the sets cx s 3 199 for s 1 0 1 2 3 into the following table 18 table 1 the sets cx s for s 1 0 1 2 3 and 2 n 200 c x 1 cx 0 cx 1 cx 2 cx 3 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 8 9 10 10 12 12 12 12 14 18 18 18

195 195 195 197 197 197 it is also of interest to supplement the qualitative statement that s 7 cx s increases monotonically with s 1 0 1 2 3 by quantitative information about bulk properties of these increasing sets cx s as s varies through 1 0 1 2 3 thus the percentage of integers in 3 199 belonging to cx s increases with s as follows c x 1 contains 0 of the integers from 3 199 c x 0 contains 11 of the integers from 3 199 c x 1 contains 27 of the integers from 3 199 c x 2 contains 38 of the integers from 3 199 c x 3 contains 43 of the integers from 3 199 these percentages suggest that cx s contains more and more integers when s in creases continuously but they do not reveal that cx s increases monotonically in s similarly it is readily seen that 5 out of 22 integers in cx 0 are odd or 23 16 out of 54 integers in cx 1 are odd or 30 24 out of 75 integers in cx 2 are odd or 32 28 out of 85 integers in cx 3 are odd or 33 this second table of percentages reveals yet another monotonicity the percentage of odd integers in cx s increases monotonically with s this raises the question whether such a monotonicity is perhaps a property of the theoretical map s 7 c s for s r if the percentage of odd numbers in c s is indeed increasing then since it cannot increase beyond 100 it will converge to some limit when s increases provided the percentage remains meaningful i e as long as c s is not empty and also when s s 0 if such a s exists in particular it makes one wonder whether only even integers will remain in c 0 s 2 3 further visualization of the increase of the sets cx s to further aid the visualization of the set theoretical differences for s 1 s 2 we defined signed indicator functions s 2 s 1 n icx s 2 n icx s 1 n where icx s n 1 24 if n cx s and icx s n 0 if n 6 c x s thus s 2 s 1 n 1 if n 6 c s 1 and n c s 2 0 if n c s 1 c s 2 or n 6 c s 1 c s 2 1 if n c s 1 and n 6 c s 2 23 whenever a convexity point n is lost by passing from s 1 to s 2 the signed indicator function n 7 s 2 s 1 n will take the value 1 at n n otherwise n 7 s 2 s 1 n is non negative this affords a convenient way of checking for set theoretical mono tonicity compared to the painstaking sifting through numerical tables fig s 7 8 and 9 below show 10 n 2 1 n and 3 2 n for n 3 199 since cx 0 cx 1 cx 2 cx 3 these diagnostic functions only take the values 0 and 1 0 50 100 150 200 n 1 d 0

theoretical results 25 3 quasi rigorous upper bounds on s while it may not be so easy to obtain a rigorous lower bound on s it is relatively easy to find a rigorous upper bound on s by studying the s dependence of v s 3 and with the help of computer evaluations of v s n for n 3 4 5 6 we easily obtained better though only quasi rigorous upper bounds on s to study the s dependence of v s n for n 3 4 5 6 when s 2 we need to know the minimizing n point configurations for n 2 3 4 5 6 7 if 2 s we begin by summarizing what we know about these 3 1 sn for n 2 3 4 5 6 7 and s 2 below we list the four rigorously known optimizers sn n 2 3 4 6 together with the partly rigorously known but mostly computer generated putative optimizers 23 s 5 and s 7 for s 2 note that for n 2 3 4 6 each optimizer sn is independent of s 2 24 while the putative optimizers s 5 and s 7 display a non trivial dependence on s 2 s 2 two antipodal points s 2 24 s 3 equatorial equilateral triangle s 2 25 s 4 regular tetrahedron s 2 26 s 5 triangular bi pyramid s 2 15 04807 square pyramid f 1 s 15 04807 27 s 6 regular octahedron s 2 28 s 7 c 2 1 123 f 5 s 2 0 pentagonal bi pyramid s 0 2 c 2 1 123 f 5 s 2 5 c 2 v 1 14121 f 3 s 5 5 5979 c 3 v 1 132 f 2 s 5 5979 29 in the above we use the scho nflies point group notation f is the number of degrees of freedom of the configuration e g for the square pyramid at n 5 the height varies with s the configurations for n 5 7 are taken from mks 77 for s 1 and from beha 77 for s 1 as to the c 2 symmetric n 7 configuration at s 1 we quote from beha 77 it consists of two points almost antipodal and the remaining five points sprinkled around an equatorial band this suggested to us that this configuration belongs to a family which bifurcates off of the pentagonal bi pyramid 23 since the s range has not been and cannot be covered exhaustively with a computer our list of 5 point and 7 point optimizers should be seen as preliminary 24 recall that sn depends on s 2 whenn is odd recall also that at s 2 the minimizer is not unique even after factoring out so 3 except when n 2 26 which we then computed numerically ourselves to happen at s 0 moreover by the nearly complete degeneracy of the s 2 problem this family of configurations will have another bifurcation point at s 2 intriguingly geometrically this is the same c 2 family of configurations which was discovered by mks 77 to bifurcate off of the pentagonal bi pyramid at s 2 and to merge with the c 2 v configuration at s 5 note though that mks 77 did not carry out a complete bifurcation analysis yet presumably the five degrees of freedom in the family will be differently optimized in each family in the sense that for most if not all s 2 0 there is no s 2 5 with the same configuration 3 2 explicit maps s 7 vs n for n 2 3 4 5 6 7 based on the table shown in subsection 3 1 we computed explicit expressions for vs n in all situations where we did not have to numerically optimize any of the degrees of freedom thus for n 2 3 4 6 and s 2 one has vs 2 1 s 1 2 s 1 30 vs 3 1 s 1 3 s 2 1 31 vs 4 1 s 3 8 s 2 1 32 and vs 6 1 s 1 5 1 2 s 4 5 1 2 s 2 1 33 while for vs 5 an explicit expression is available for s 2 15 04807 viz vs 5 1 s 1 10 1 2 s 3 10 1 3 s 2 3 5 1 2 s 2 1 34 and for vs 7 the following expression is valid for s 0 2 vs 7 1 s 1 21 1 2 s 5 21 2 sin 2 5 s 2 sin 5 s 10 21 1 2 s 2 1 35 3 3 bounds on s from s 7 v s 3 for s 2 only for n 3 can we compute v s n for all s 2 viz v s 3 1 s 1 2 s 3 8 s 2 2 1 3 s 2 36 the elementary function s 7 v s 3 is sufficiently simple to allow a thoroughly rigorous discussion thus inserting s 2 we obtain v 2 3 1 3 but we already knew 27 that any function s 7 v s n had to be strictly negative at s 2 on the other hand rewriting v s 3 as v s 3 1 s 3 8 s 2 1 8 9 s 2 1 3 4 s 2 37 we can extract the large s asymptotic behavior v s 3 1 s 3 8 s 2 0 as a continuous function v s 3 therefore has to have an odd number of zeros in 2 let s 3 1 denote the smallest zero of v s 3 in 2 then s s 3 1 rigorously of course the bound s s 3 1 is not explicit an explicit upper bound is obtained by inserting s 10 into 36 or 37 which yields the strictly positive tiny value v 10 3 1289 79626240 thus we have rigorously proved proposition 3 the critical s satisfies the upper bound s s 3 1 10 with a little extra effort one can show that v s 3 has exactly one zero in 2 namely starting at s 2 with a strictly negative value v s 3 then increases mono tonically to a single strictly positive maximum after which it decays monoton ically to zero as s we illustrate this behavior with a mathematica plot of s 7 v s 3 see fig 10 5 10 15 20 s 0 0003 0 0001 0 0001 v s x h 3 l figure 10 behavior of v s 3 as a function of s numerically we get s 3 1 9 4 so that our explicit upper bound on s is not much worse than this numerically computed bound on s the bound stated in proposition 3 is the only upper bound on s which we were able to establish with complete rigor by analyzing explicitly known finite n optimiz ers quantitatively this bound is lousy in particular as mentioned in the introduc tion hardin and saff hasa 05 rigorously showed that n 7 vs n is asymptotically for large n strictly convex when s 4 which implies that s 4 28 in the ensuing subsections we will obtain several much better upper bounds alas aided by a computer some of these are stated as conditional propositions which includes proposition 2 3 4 bounds on s via s 7 v s 4 2 s 15 048 for n 4 we can explicitly compute v s n when 2 s 15 04807 namely v s 4 1 s 1 10 1 2 s 13 10 1 3 s 2 3 5 1 2 s 2 2 3 8 s 2 38 the s dependence of this elementary function is also simple enough to allow a thor oughly rigorous discussion which reveals the following thus v 2 4 is strictly neg ative again as we know already it must also the large s asymptotics of r h s 38 can be worked out immediately r h s 38 1 s 3 5 1 2 s 2 0 yielding the information that r h s 38 has an odd number of zeros in 2 however since the validity of the expression 38 is restricted to s 2 15 04807 the asymptotic result does not yield relevant information which in concert with the strict negativity of v 2 4 would allow us to draw any conclusions about s 7 v s 4 in s 2 15 04807 instead we need to take a closer look inserting s 2 we easily find v 2 4 41 120 0 as a continuous function v s 4 therefore has to have an odd number of zeros in 2 2 let s 4 1 denote the smallest zero of v s 4 in 2 2 then s 4 1 is a quasi rigorous 25 upper bound on s also the bound s s 4 1 is not explicit but s 4 1 2 gives the explicit quasi rigorous upper bound s 2 which improves over s 10 and also over s 4 from the asymptotic analysis hasa 05 also with the aid of maple or such the explicit quasi rigorous upper bound can be improved to s 1 for numerically v 1 4 0 0000745467 0 in remarkable agreement with the numerical data extracted from the computer experiments so that s 4 1 1 in fact this can also be made quasi rigorous proposition 4 the critical s satisfies the upper bound s 1 as v 1 4 1 20 13 10 1 3 1 2 3 5 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 0 39 proof first we derive a sufficiently tight lower bound of 1 x 1 2 in terms of a polynomial that gives a rational number if x is rational the usual taylor polynomial with lagrange remainder term does not provide good enough bounds using the binomial formula pochhammer symbols and gauss hypergeometric functions we 25 the reason for the prefix quasi is the absence of a rigorous proof that the triangular bi pyramid is the n 5 optimizer for s 2 2 for such a small n value it is

result with some extra energy one should be able to make the above bounds totally rigorous but this would require to prove that the triangular bi pyramid is the n 5 optimizer for s 0 2 say 26 digital

to us only through our numerical bifurca tion analysis so that it seems prudent for now to be satisfied with a computer assisted evaluation fig 12 shows a numerical rendering of r h s 40 0 0 0 5 1 0 1

zeros in 2 0 let s 6 1 be the smallest one then s s 6 1 0 this proves proposition 2 3 6 remarks on s 7 v s 12 for 2 s 2 fig s 3 and 4 suggest that the n 6 peak increases more rapidly with s than the n 12 peak when s runs from 0 to 1 since the n 12 peak appears to be the highest peak for s 0 while the n 6 peak is barely above zero then we suspect that by lowering s below 0 the n 12 peak will vanish at a lower s value than the n 6 peak so that the first zero of s 7 v s 12 will yield a better upper bound on s than the one we have found with n 6 unfortunately to evaluate s 7 v s 12 one needs to know the optimal configura tions forn 11 13 we are planning a computer assisted evaluation of s 7 v s 12 which seems to be the best one can do right now 4 rigorous bounds on v s n 4 1 generic o n 2 upper bounds on v s n for s 0 we now derive the following positive o n 2 upper bound on v s n for s 0 proposition 5 for s 0 the second derivative of vs n is bounded above by v s n 2 n 1 n vs n 1 1 s 41 proof we rewrite 2 vs n 1 vs n 1 vs n 42 where 2 n 1 next since vs n vs sn using 3 we now rewrite 42 further as 2 vs n 1 2 n n 1 1 i j n 1 vs qsi qsj 1 2 n n 1 1 i n 1 vs qsi qsn 1 2 n n 1 1 i j n vs qsi qsj 32 and so using that 2 n 1 2 vs n 2 n 3 n 1 n n 1 1 i j n 1 vs qsi qsj 2 n 3 n 1 n n 1 1 i n 1 vs qsi qsn 2 n 1 n 1 i j n vs qsi qsj 43 for the term in the second line we use that n 3 n 1 4 and rewrite 2 n 3 n 1 n n 1 2 n 1 n 8 n 1 n n 1 44 in the single sum receiving the factor 2 n 1 n we now rename the point qsn into q n 1 and pool this single sum together with the double sum in the last line in 43 obtaining 1 i n 1 vs qsi q n 1 1 i j n vs qsi qsj 1 s 1 i j n 1 vs q i q j 45 where q k q s k for 1 k n and q n 1 qsn and where we used that vs 0 1 s for s 0 now multiplying by 2 n 1 n and recalling 3 yields 2 n 1 n 1 i n 1 vs qsi q n 1 1 i j n vs qsi qsj 2 n 1 n 1 s vs n 1 46 where n 1 q 1 q n 1 for the remaining single sum with factor 8 n 1 n n 1 we note that without loss of generality we may assume that 1 i n 1 vs qsi qsn 1 i n i 6 j vs qsi qsj j 1 n but then 1 n 1 1 i n 1 vs qsi qsn 2 n n 1 1 i j n vs qsi qsj and therefore also 1 n 1 1 i n 1 vs qsi qsn 2 n 1 n 2 1 i j n 1 vs qsi qsj 47 33 this estimate of the single sum from the middle line of 43 in terms of the double sum in the first line of 43 gives us 2 n 3 n 1 n n 1 1 i j n 1 vs qsi qsj 8 n 1 n n 1 1 i n 1 vs qsi qsn n 3 n 2 8 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 i j n 1 vs qsi qsj 1 2 n 1 n vs sn qsn in total we therefore have the estimate 2 vs n 2 n 1 n 1 s vs n 1 1 2 n 1 n vs sn qsn 48 which can be estimated again with the help of 4 to get 2 vs n 2 n 1 n 1 s vs n 1 1 2 n 1 n vs n 1 49 regrouping terms in 49 we get vs n 1 2 vs n vs n 1 2 n 1 n 1 s vs n 1 50 the proof is complete remark 4 step 45 requires vs 0 which is true only for s 0 remark 5 for s 0 we have 1 s vs n 1 0 so that r h s 50 0 remark 6 for the special value s 2 we have the exact result 109 and a direct computation shows that v 2 n 2 n 1 3 0 therefore at least for s 2 the upper estimate is not optimal also for s 2 and even n we have the exact result 110 which converges to v 2 n when taking the limit s 2 of 110 again a simple computation shows that v s n 0 for s 2 and n even modulo confirming that the situation doesn t change when n is odd the upper bound on v s n for s 0 would be non optimal for all s 2 34 remark 7 the 1 s at r h s 50 is a consequence of our definition of vs r by working instead with v s r r s s the 1 s term will not show up in 45 and 46 and hence be absent in 50 which would read v s n 1 2 v s n v s n 1 2 n 1 n v s n 1 51 note that indeed the 1 s at r h s 50 cancels against the 1 s implicit in vs n 1 and l h s 50 is invariant under the change vs r v s r so that our 50 is quan titatively identical to 51 remark 8 if one could improve the factor 2 at r h s 47 into a 3 2 this would prove concavity however the inequality 47 turns out to be sometimes an equality e g when s 1 and n 3 or n 4 also 48 rewritten as vs n 1 2 vs n vs n 1 vs n 1 vs n 1 vs n 1 vs sn qsn 2 n 1 n 1 s vs sn qsn 52 is still sometimes an equality for instance take s 1 then v 1 2 1 2 and v 1 3 1 3 and v 1 4 1 2 2 3 so for n 3 then v 1 3 v 1 2 2 vs 3 vs 4 2 1 3 2 3 0 168891546 and the exact evaluation of r h s 52 yields the same answer remark 9 the only true inequality is in the step from 48 to 49 thus to prove concavity at least for some s values one has to improve this estimate we have checked that for s 1 and n 3 the sum of the second line at r h s 52 alone does not dominate the term in the third line namely the sum of these two terms is 7 6 3 2 0 also the term in the first line at r h s 52 alone does not dominate the one in the third line in this case namely their sum equals 3 1 2 2 3 0 too therefore to prove concavity for some negative s values say s 1 one will need to prove that the first two lines at the r h s 52 together are more negative than the last line is positive at least for a certain range of negative s values 4 2 point energies better o n 2 bounds on v s n s 0 so far our analysis has only used the concept of an energy of a configuration of n points which is based on the interpretation of vs q q as a pair energy we now bring in the well known concept of an energy of an individual point or point energy for short which is based on the interpretation of vs q q as the potential energy of a particle located at q in the potential field of a particle at q a notion which is clearly reflexive 35 we recall that every unlabeled n point configuration n on s 2 can be assigned a unique compatible family of normalized so called empirical n point measures with 1 n n and vice versa for instance with the help of any labeling the first two of these can be written as 27 1 n dq 1 n 1 j n qj dq 53 2 n dqdq 2 n n 1 1 j k n qj dq qk dq 54 and analogously one writes the empirical measures of higher order n 3 n here with a mild abuse of notation qj dq denotes the dirac measure on s 2 concen trated at qj i e for any borel subset of s 2 we have qj dq 0 if qj 6 and qj dq 1 if qj with the help of 2 n we can rewrite the average standardized riesz pair energy of an n point configuration n as vs n s 2 s 2 vs q q 2 n dqdq 55 moreover with the help of 1 n we can now associate with each n point configu ration n a standardized riesz s potential function on s 2 given by vs 1 n q s 2 vs q q 1 n dq q s 2 s 0 56 remark 10 since s 0 the potential function 56 is well defined and finite on all of s 2 because vs r r is continuous for s 0 of course provided one restricts q to s 2 n one can also extend 56 continuously to the regime s 0 moreover when s 0 2 the function q 7 vs q q is weakly lower semi continuous i e vs is the pointwise limit of an increasing sequence of continuous functions and therefore the potential function 56 is well defined in the sense that it may be positive infinite for certain q also for n whenever 1 n dq dq in the weak sense where dq is a regular borel measure on s 2 note that vs q lim inf vs 1 n q of special interest to us are the standardized riesz s potentials of n point con figurations n on s 2 obtained from n 1 point configurations by removing any particular point or rather their analogues with n replaced by n 1 every n defines a set of n such n 1 point configurations after introducing any con venient labeling of the points in n this set of n 1 point configurations reads n q n 1 for every n 1 point configuration there is a standardized riesz s potential function on s 2 given by vs 1 n q q 27 note that the expressions at the r h s s are invariant under the permutation group sn which is why the mapping n n n nn 1 is one to one only for unlabeled configurations 36 for every point q n 1 n its average standardized riesz point energy w r t the reduced n 1 point configuration n q is simply the standard ized riesz s potential of n q evaluated at q q viz 1 n 1 1 j n j 6 vs qj q vs 1 n q q 1 n 57 thus every n defines a set of n point energies vs 1 n q q n 1 the average standardized riesz pair energy of n is the mean of these vs n 1 n 1 n vs 1 n q q 58 remark 11 given a minimizing configuration sn it can easily be seen that vs 1 s n qs q vs 1 s n qs qs for all q s 2 59 which simply says that each generalized unit point charge in a minimal energy con figuration occupies a point of minimal potential energy in the potential field generated by the remaining generalized unit point charges with the help of the so defined potential functions and point energies we are ready to prove proposition 1 which improves the upper bound in proposition 5 and also supplies a lower bound of the same type proof of proposition 1 using the definitions 3 and 57 for each 1 n we have vs n n 2 n vs n q 2 n vs 1 n q q 60 this will be our master identity first averaging 60 over all q 1 n and recalling 58 gives vs n 1 n 1 n vs n q 61 now replacing n by s n qs 1 qsn a minimizing n point configuration and using 4 for n 1 point configurations at the r h s we recover the monotonicity relation vs n vs n 1 for all integers n 2 62 cf lan 72 kie 09 a kie 09 b 37 second replacing n in 60 with n q q s 2 and q by q yields vs n q n 1 n 1 vs n 2 n 1 vs 1 n q or equivalently vs n n 1 n 1 vs n q 2 n 1 vs 1 n q 63 now setting q q n and averaging 63 over all q 1 n and recalling 57 and 58 gives vs n n n 2 n 1 n 1 1 n 1 n vs n q 2 vs 0 n 1 n once again replacing n by s n then using 4 with n replaced by n 1 at the r h s we find an estimate in the opposite direction to 62 vs n n 1 n n 2 n 1 vs n 1 2 vs 0 n 2 n 1 n 2 64 note that vs 0 1 s for s 0 next inserting a minimizing n point configuration sn qs 1 qsn directly into 60 and also into 63 with q qs then using 4 yields vs n n 2 n vs n 1 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs 65 vs n n 1 n 1 vs n 1 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs 2 vs 0 n n 1 66 for each 1 n recalling definition 6 of v s n we split 2 vs n in 6 into 1 vs n 1 vs n then use inequality 65 to estimate 1 vs n and inequality 66 to estimate 1 vs n arriving after simplifications at v s n 2 n 2 n vs n 1 2 n 1 n 1 vs n 1 4 1 n vs 1 s n qs l qs 2 1 s 1 n n 1 67 this relation holds for all 1 n and parameters with 1 1 let 0 1 and pick such that vs 1 s n qs qs vs n 68 38 that such a choice of is possible follows from 58 with these choices of and inequality 67 and the monotonicity relation 62 together give v s n 2 n 2 n vs n 2 n 1 n 1 vs n 4 n vs n 2 1 s 1 n n 1 2 1 n n 1 vs n 1 s so nothing can be gained here let 2 n 1 0 and now pick such that vs 1 s n qs qs vs n 69 that such a choice of is possible follows again from 58 with these choices of and inequality 67 and the estimate 64 together give v s n 2 1 n n 1 vs n 1 s 2 n 1 0 for 2 n 2 0 and 2 n 1 0 since vs n 1 s 0 we obtain for 2 n 1 the upper estimate exhibited in proposition 1 v s n 2 n 1 n vs n 1 s on the other hand the estimates 66 and 68 can be used to get a lower bound for vs n 1 vs n 1 n n 1 n 1 n 2 vs n 2 vs 0 n 1 n 2 this estimate and the estimate vs n 1 vs n allow us to estimate the r h s in the definition 6 of v s n to obtain the lower estimate exhibited in proposition 1 v s n n n 1 n 1 n 2 vs n 2 vs 0 n 1 n 2 2 vs n vs n 2 n 1 n 2 vs n vs 0 39 remark 12 for 2 n 1 and as in 69 we obtain from 67 using vs n vs n 1 v s n 2 n 2 n vs n 1 2 n 1 n 1 vs n 1 4 n vs n 2 1 s 1 n n 1 2 n 2 n vs n 1 2 n 1 n 1 vs n 1 2 1 s 1 n n 1 2 n vs n 1 2 n 1 vs n 1 2 s 1 n n 1 n 2 n vs n 1 n 1 n 1 vs n 1 2 s 1 n n 1 both factors 2 n 2 and 2 n 1 are 0 as special cases one has v s n 2 n n 1 vs n 1 1 s if 2 n 1 v s n vs n 1 vs n 1 if 1 the first of these inequalities is simply proposition 5 while the second one also follows trivially from the definition 6 and 62 remark 13 the concept of the riesz potential of an n point configuration also allows one to obtain identities relating point energies and the average pair energy when a single point is removed or added in again as follows again inserting a minimizing n point configuration sn qs 1 qsn into 60 and also into 63 with q qs but this time not using 4 yields vs n n 2 n vs sn q 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs 70 vs n n 1 n 1 vs s n qs 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs 71 for all 1 n meaning we have 2 n not necessarily all different expressions for vs n now subtracting 70 from itself with two different values in place and the same for 71 and the same for the identity r h s 70 r h s 71 and resorting 40 yields for all 1 n the identities 28 n 2 n vs sn q vs sn q 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs vs 1 s n qs qs n 1 n 1 vs s n qs vs sn qs in this vein alternate exact representations of the discrete second derivative of vs n follow for instance we offer v s n vs n 1 vs sn q vs n 1 vs sn qs 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs vs sn q vs sn qs vs 1 s n qs qs 2 n n 1 vs s n qs vs 0 note that from the definition 3 it follows that the first line at the r h s 0 by the last line in our remark we obtain an upper bound on v s n entirely in terms of expressions involving only the optimal n point configuration viz proposition 6 for s 0 the map n 7 v s n is bounded above by v s n 2 n vs 1 s n qs qs vs 1 s n qs qs vs sn qs vs sn q 2 n n 1 vs s n qs vs 0 4 3 upper bounds on v s n for n 4 6 12 s 2 the upper and lower bounds on v s n presented so far are valid for general n 2 and s 0 no structural information about any optimizer was used for the n values of the universal configurations viz 29 n 3 4 6 and 12 one can easily get better upper bounds on v s n for any s though for n 3 this is a pointless exercise because 36 gives the exact expression of v s 3 for all s 2 cf subsection 3 3 where we found that v s 3 0 for s 9 4 approximately this leaves the cases n 4 6 12 28 in fact one can show these hold for all general n point sets n 29 of course the n 2 configuration is also universally optimal but v s 2 is ill defined 41 we begin by noting the obvious inequality v s n vs n 1 2 vs n vs n 1 72 here n 1 and n 1 are any convenient n 1 point configurations inequality 72 allows us to state an immediate corollary to the results of section 3 corollary 1 since the optimizers for n 3 4 are universal but not the one for n 5 r h s 38 is a rigorous upper bound to v s 4 for all s 2 as a consequence v s 4 0 for all s 2 s 4 1 with s 4 1 1 yet 1 since the n 6 optimizer is universal but not those for n 5 7 r h s 40 is a rigorous upper bound to v s 6 for all s 2 as a consequence v s 6 0 for all s 2 s 6 1 with s 6 1 0 yet 0 similarly based on the fact that the n 12 optimizer is universal while those for n 11 13 are not we can obtain rigorous upper bounds on v s 12 proposition 7 the map s 7 v s 12 is bounded above by v s 12 vs s 12 qs 1 2 vs 12 vs s 12 p 73 in particular choosing the epi center of a face of the icosahedron for p yields v s 12 1 s 1 26 1 3 5 2 3 sin 2 5 5 5 8 sin 2 2 5 s 1 3 5 2 3 sin 2 5 5 5 8 sin 2 2 5 s 2 sin 1 2 arccos 1 3 sin 2 5 1 2 arctan 1 2 s 2 sin 1 2 arcsin 1 3 sin 2 5 1 2 arccot 1 2 s 2 143 5 1 sin 2 5 s 5 4 sin 2 2 5 1 sin 2 5 s 2 s 74 note that the two trial configurations used to obtain 74 are not local energy minimizers not even mechanical equilibrium configurations unfortunately we pay a high price for having chosen these configurations which allowed us to compute an upper estimate explicitly r h s 74 0 for all s its minimum 0 014 at s 1 8 presumably good upper bounds can only be obtained with the aid of a computer by optimizing the parameters in a well chosen multi parameter family of configurations 4 4 upper and lower bounds on v s 5 for 2 s we begin with the rigorous lower bound proposition 8 for all s 2 we have v s 5 1 s 3 8 s 2 2 5 1 2 s 2 3 5 1 3 s 2 75 42 proof since both s 4 and s 6 are rigorously known to be universal optimizers for all s 2 and therefore do not depend on s when s 2 whereas s 5 does it follows from the definition 4 that v s 5 vs 4 2 vs trial 5 vs 6 76 where trial 5 is any trial 5 point configuration picking the regular triangular bi pyramid and using 30 and 33 yields 75 we next vindicate conjecture 3 thus we work under the hypothesis that the putative 5 point minimizers listed in our table in subsection 3 1 are actual minimizers proposition 9 for all s 2 we have 1 s 3 8 s 2 2 5 1 2 s 2 3 5 1 3 s 2 0 77 proof we break the proof down into several parts first we show that l h s 77 0 for all s 0 we rewrite 3 8 s 2 2 5 1 2 s 2 3 5 1 3 s 2 3 8 s 2 1 2 5 4 3 s 2 3 5 8 9 s 2 78 now use the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means to estimate 2 5 4 3 s 2 3 5 8 9 s 2 4 3 s 2 2 5 8 9 s 2 3 5 213 38 s 10 1 79 where the last estimate follows from 213 38 8192 6561 1 and the strict increase of the map x 7 xs 10 for s 0 this proves that l h s 77 0 when 0 s 15 04807 remark 14 for s 2 the map x 7 xs 2 is convex so we can alternatively use jensen s inequality to get 2 5 1 2 s 2 3 5 1 3 s 2 2 5 1 2 3 5 1 3 s 2 2 5 s 2 3 8 s 2 80 where the second inequality follows from the strict increase of the map x 7 xs 2 noting that 2 5 16 40 15 40 3 8 next we show that l h s 77 0 for all 2 s 0 for 2 s 0 the map x 7 x s 2 is concave so we use jensen s inequality to get 8 3 s 2 2 5 2 s 2 3 5 3 s 2 8 3 s 2 2 5 2 3 5 3 s 2 8 3 s 2 13 5 s 2 0 81 where the second inequality follows from 8 3 40 15 39 15 13 5 and the strict increase of the map x 7 x s 2 since s 0 this proves that l h s 77 0 when 2 s 0 it remains to show that l h s 77 0 when s 0 indeed what we proved so far does not rule out that l h s 77 0 when s 0 however l hospital s rule yields lims 0 1 s 3 8 s 2 2 5 1 2 s 2 3 5 1 3 s 2 1 10 ln 3 8 213 0 82 where the inequality follows from 38 213 6561 8192 1 already used earlier this completes the proof that l h s 77 0 when s 2 43 by our hypotheses according to our table in subsection 3 1 the regular triangular bi pyramid is the optimizer if 2 s 15 04807 thus v s 5 r h s 75 l h s 77 in this range of s values since l h s 77 0 for s 2 we obtain corollary 2 we have that v s 5 0 when 2 s 15 04807 see fig 13 5 10 15 s 0 03 0 02 0 01 v s x h 5 l figure 13 behavior of v s 5 as a function of s for s 2 15 08407 unfortunately empirically we know that r h s 75 is not the correct formula for v s 5 when s 15 04807 therefore our estimate 79 does not rule out that v s 5 may become positive for some s 15 04807 we now summarize our computer generated evidence that v s 5 0 for s 15 04807 by our hypotheses the optimal 5 point configuration for s 15 04807 is the square pyramid with adjusted height so for s 15 04807 the optimal 5 point average riesz s pair energy is given by vs 5 vs ssqpyr with vs ssqpyr 1 s 21 s 2 5 1 z s 2 2 1 s 2 5 1 z 2 s 2 2 s 5 1 z 2 s 2 1 83 where z is the unique solution in 1 0 of the equation 1 z 1 s 2 2 2 s 2 z 0 84 the solution of 84 is the z coordinate of the base of the pyramid if its tip is at z 1 for s 15 equation 84 has no explicit solution in terms of elementary functions but l h s 84 is convex and a newton scheme very rapidly converges downward from z 0 0 for all s 15 with the help of the newton scheme we found that vs 4 2 vs ssqpyr vs 6 0 85 for 15 s 106 to make this completely rigorous we need to show that asymptoti cally v s 5 0 with good error bounds which we hope to supply in future work the vindication of conjecture 3 is complete 44 5 an asymptotic point of view a rigorous proof of the concavity of n 7 vs n for some regime of s values possibly for all s s with s conjectured to be in 1 0 most likely has to be based on a combination of different strategies attempts to rigorously identify all the opti mizers and to check for the negativity of v s n by explicit computation may be feasible for sufficiently small n values but clearly are bound to fail even for moder ately large n values on the other hand the very large n regime is to some extent accessible by asymptotic analysis ultimately the goal is to determine the complete asymptotic large n expansion of n 7 vs n but at least as many terms as possi ble with enough hard work one may be able to extend the asymptotic control down to sufficiently small n values to establish an overlap with some explicitly controlled small n regime in the previous section we presented the type of analysis suitable for the small n regime this section is devoted to asymptotic analysis it has already been mentioned in the introduction that the limit lim n vs n is given by the variational principle 114 explicitly lim n vs n inf p s 2 s 2 s 2 1 s 1 p q s 1 dp dq 86 where p s 2 is the set of all borel probability measures supported on s 2 by classical potential theory bjo 56 for s 0 and lan 72 for s 0 one knows that for s 2 is s 2 s 2 1 p q s dp dq 87 is well defined and finite for any p s 2 on p s 2 the riesz s energy integral has a degenerate maximum with value 2 s 1 when s 2 and it has a unique maximum when 2 s 0 respectively a unique minimum when 0 s 2 achieved at the normalized surface area measure on s 2 r 3 with value is 21 s 2 s ws 88 this expression is also valid at s 0 with i 0 1 for all p s 2 for s 2 the energy integral 87 is for any p s 2 altogether therefore lim n vs n 1 s 2 s 1 1 if s 2 1 s ws 1 if s 2 2 if s 2 89 with the special case s 0 included as lim s 0 1 s ws 1 12 ln 1 2 we need to know how these limiting values are approached by vs n as n 45 for the regime s 2 we already have an exact formula for vs n valid for all even n namely 110 yet as mentioned in appendix a the s 2 regime is largely unsettled for odd n and we have nothing to add to this here moreover the case s 2 is completely solved with v 2 n given by 109 thus henceforth we will discuss the regime s 2 clearly we need to further make the distinction between the subregimes s 2 2 and s 2 as to the regime s 2 2 to find the large n asymptotic expansion of vs n one seeks the powers s r and s r for which a nontrivial limit lim n n s lnn s vs n 1 s ws 1 c s 90 exists then subtracts c s from the expression under the limit in 90 multiplies by n s lnn s with new powers s and s and repeats the procedure etc this strategy has to some extent been carried out in the literature see bhs 12 for a recent account we will call upon the results of bhs 12 in a moment to pave the way for our discussion we first recall the definition 4 of vs n involving our standardized riesz pair energy vs r given in 1 and note that the additive term 1 s in the difference vs n 1 s ws 1 cancels out this motivates the definition of the s 2 adjusted riesz pair energy us r s 1 r s ws s 2 s 6 0 91 and its s 0 limit u 0 r log r wlog 92 where wlog inf s 2 s 2 log 1 p q dp dq p s 2 is the s derivative of ws 1 1 2 log 2 s o s 2 as s 0 evaluated at s 0 with value wlog w 0 1 2 log 1 2 0 193147 0 we define the average s 2 adjusted riesz pair energy of a configuration by us n 2 n n 1 1 j k n us qj qk s 2 2 93 and the minimal average s 2 adjusted riesz pair energy by 30 us n inf n s 2 us n s 2 2 94 30 the energy functionals us n without the normalization 1 n n 1 were studied by wagner wag 90 wag 92 who first derived two sided bounds for optimal n point configurations in terms of the correct order of decay of n for the complete range 2 s 2 46 we note that for each s 2 2 the map n 7 us n is monotonically increasing and that by construction the limit is 0 hence us n 0 for all n as for the regime s 2 since vs n as n it would seem that the asymptotic analysis has to be set up in a somewhat different manner in fact this is true for s 2 see below however it is worth noting that r h s 88 is defined on the complex s plane except at the single and simple pole at s 2 and thus gives the analytic continuation of ws to the complex s plane we will denote this meromorphic function by the same symbol ws understood in this analytically extended way 90 and the ensuing description the definition 91 as well as 93 and 94 all make sense also for the regime s 2 note though that for s 2 the map n 7 us n diverges monotonically to as n hence us n 6 0 for most n when s 2 so that the power s 0 for s 2 and if s 0 then s 0 while for s 2 the power s 0 and if s 0 then s 0 while all this may seem just like a convenient coincidence we shall see in subsection 5 2 that the analytic continuation to s 2 actually seems to have some deeper significance for the aysmptotic problem cf bhs 12 as to the singular case s 2 it obviously makes no sense to subtract the infinite term 1 2 w 2 from v 2 n or from v 2 r yet if one replaces 90 by lim n n 2 lnn 2 v 2 n 1 2 c 2 95 the ensuing description remains valid with the definitions 93 and 94 extended to s 2 with the help of the definition u 2 r 12 1 r 2 note that n 7 u 2 n diverges monotonically to as n so the same remarks apply as for the hypersingular regime s 2 regarding the powers s and s clearly for each s 2 s 6 2 the s 2 adjusted pair energy us r on s 2 and the standardized pair energy vs r differ only by a constant viz us r vs r s 1 1 ws r 0 96 with the case s 0 understood as limit s 0 viz u 0 r v 0 r wlog as a consequence all their discrete n derivatives coincide in particular we have lemma 1 for all s 2 s 6 2 we have u s n v s n 97 u s n v s n 98 in the remaining subsections we will elaborate on the asymptotic expansion of n 7 us n and its implications for the asymptotic expansion of n 7 v s n sub section 5 1 is concerned with the potential regime s 2 2 subsection 5 2 with the hypersingular regime s 2 and subsection 5 3 with the singular case s 2 as mentioned earlier a discussion of the degeneracy regime s 2 has to be left for some future work 47 5 1 the potential theoretical regime 2 s

k n sign s qj qk s q 1 qn s 2 cf hasa 04 then it is known 31 cf bhs 12 that there are s dependent constants c c 0 such that c n 1 s 2 es s 2 n wsn 2 cn 1 s 2 for all sufficiently large n 2 hence c n 1

using the definition of the s 2 adjusted riesz pair energy 31 it is furthermore well known that for a sequence sn n 2 of optimal n point configurations with 2 s 2 s 6 0 one has the limit relation lim n 2 n n 1 1 j k n qsj n qsk n s ws 99 the reciprocal of the quantity under the limit symbol is also known as the n th generalized diameter of s 2 it converges monotonically to the generalized transfinite diameter of s 2 introduced by po lya and szego in posz 31 which equals the so called s capacity 1 ws of s 2 incidentally it should also be noted that p q s is a conditionally positive definite function of order 1 for 2 s 0 cf sch 38 48 from the bounds in proposition 10 we get estimates for the discrete second deriva tive of us n and by means of lemma 1 for vs n proposition 11 let s

computations hold with c and c interchanged 49 proposition 11 although much weaker than proposition 1 clearly shows that one needs more information about the asymptotic behavior of us n for large n the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of es s 2 n for large n yields the following fundamental conjecture we refer the interested reader to bhs 12 and papers cited therein conjecture 4 let 2 s 2 and s 6 0 then there exists a constant cs and a function s n such that us n 1 s cs 4 s 2 n s 2 1 ws s n 1 s n for all n 2 and n 1 s 2 s n 0 as n it should be noted that the n 1 term may be dominated by the function s n for 0 s 2 indeed at presence it is unclear how fast n 1 s 2 s n tends to zero as n one suggestion is that n s 1 2 1 or even n s 2 2 is the correct order of n for the next term the numerical evidence is inconclusive in this regard worse the properly normalized s n may be oscillating with bounded non zero amplitude as n becomes large motivation of conjecture 4 for 2 s 2 and s 6 0 the following conjecture for the large n behavior of es s 2 n is known cf bhs 12 for a most recent account es s 2 n wsn 2 cs 4 s 2 n 1 s 2 rs n where rs n n 1 s 2 0 as n hence us n 1 s es s 2 n n n 1

interference from higher order terms in the conjectured asymptotic expansion of us n forces a 51 positive sign the numerical evidence for s 1 no exceptional n 200 with non negative discrete second derivative of v 1 n discussed earlier supports a negative sign of v 1 n viz u 1 n in fact if u s n 0 for infinitely many growing nk then 100 would imply that s nk s nk 1 2 s nk s nk 1 2 swsn 3 k 0 remark 16 for 0 s 2 the dominant term in 100 is the cs term or possibly s n it is not even known that the constant cs appearing in conjecture 4 and thus in 100 exists results for the hypersingular case discussed below suggest that cs is related to the epstein zeta function for the hexagonal lattice in the plane an inspection of the graph of the conjectured value of cs analytically continued shows that it is negative in the interval 0 2 asymptotically seen higher order terms in the large n expansion of us n 0 s 2 cause the appearance of large magic numbers n indeed analysis of the putatively minimal average s 2 adjusted riesz pair energy up to n 200 for s 1 gives a sequence of n s for which u s n is not negative 5 1 2 the logarithmic case in the logarithmic case one has the

local concavity properties of the map n 7 vs n where vs n is the minimal average standardized riesz pair energy for n point configurations on the unit 2 sphere s 2 r 3 by standardized riesz pair energy we mean vs r s 1 r s 1 with s r where r is the chordal distance between the points of the pair the map s 7 vs r defines a real analytical family of increasing pair energies in particular it includes the logarithmic interaction ln r lims 0 vs r given the limited amount of knowledge about true minimizers see appendix a we have studied mostly the n dependence of putatively minimal average standard ized riesz pair energies vxs n obtained numerically in computer experiments our empirical findings indicate that for s 1 the minimal average standardized riesz pair energy could be locally strictly concave function of n without any convex anomalies however when s 0 1 2 3 we have found that n 7 vxs n is not strictly concave based on our empirical findings we have conjectured that there exists an s 1 0 such that n 7 vxs n is locally strictly concave for all s s while lo cal strict concavity is violated at some n values whenever s s we presented some rigorous but rough and some quasi rigorous yet more promising upper bounds on s also in appendix a we shall readily see analytically that n 7 v 2 n is strictly locally concave and restricted to even numbers n 2 n the results of bjo 56 imply the strict local concavity of n 7 vs n also for s 2 we also presented various rigorous bounds on the second discrete derivative v s n of n 7 vs n and we related concavity to an asymptotic analysis of the large n regime our control of v s n is not good enough to prove strict local con cavity for any s other than s 2 yet we expect that our analysis will serve as a stepping stone along the way to a concavity proof for s s in any event our rigorous bounds can serve as test criteria for optimality we emphasize that an a priori knowledge of any concavity properties of the actual maps n 7 vs n will furnish valuable test criteria for the accuracy of empirical maps n 7 vxs n in particular given the practical importance of the s 1 problem in numerical integration schemes as mentioned in appendix a it is of special interest to 60 prove or disprove the empirically suggested local strict concavity of n 7 v 1 n since the optimizers of the s 1 fekete problem are related to spherical digital nets it is of interest to raise our concavity questions also for these average standardized riesz pair energies computed for such nets see our appendix d for each studied s value the n values at which the map n 7 vxs n is strictly convex were collected into a set cx s inspection of the empirical map s 7 cx s suggested to us the conjecture that the actual map s 7 c s is set theoretically monotonic increasing inspired by this conjecture we suspected and then verified by finding lower energy configuations that the n 177 and n 197 data points in the computer experimental tables of putatively minimal riesz pair energies for s 2 3 in cal 09 are non optimal this makes it plain that a priori knowledge of any monotonicity property of the map s 7 c s will also furnish valuable test criteria for the accuracy of empirical maps n 7 vxs n we have also discovered yet another empirical monotonicity the percentage of odd numbers in cx s increases monotonically with s 0 1 2 3 based on this finding it is reasonable to conjecture that the percentage of odd numbers in c s increases monotonically with s s if such s exists we have not been able to detect any algebraic generating rule of cx s for any s 0 1 2 3 and with increasing s it seems increasingly unlikely another monotonicity property to detect any such rule because the sets cx s appear more and more random as s increases from 0 to 3 on the other hand the set cx 0 exhibits some intriguing quasi regular patterns which reminded us 33 of the periodic table of the chemists or the magic numbers in nuclear physics incidentally note that the s 0 problem can be viewed as the electric ground state energy problem for a system of n two dimensional point charges on s 2 thus we decided to call the n values in c x 0 the magic numbers of smale s 7 th problem we have speculated that those magic numbers are perhaps associated with optimally symmetric endpoints of families of more and more symmetric configurations based on our observation that the first few configurations associated with cx 0 are highly symmetric in order to switch from a magic n optimal configuration to an optimal n 1 configuration by adding a particle would then require an unusually large amount of energy to break up the optimally symmetric magic n configuration hence the convexity we hope that our paper triggers further research into the concavity properties of the minimial average standardized riesz pair energies on s 2 in particular the structure of its sets of convexity defects as functions of s as a preliminary guide into such future inquiries we have formulated a list of 14 interesting questions yet surely there are many more it would also be interesting to try to answer analogues of our questions formulated for the s fekete problem on other compact manifolds m in particular we expect that the analogue of our list of questions q 1 q 14 for m s 1 33 by this we only mean a vague qualitative reminiscence of course thomson tho 04 may have hoped to find the actual quantitative pattern of the periodic table of the chemists for a most recent inquiry in this spirit see laf 13 61 can be answered in complete detail cf our remark 3 furthermore even though the paper mks 77 contains many numerically com puted bifurcation diagrams we noticed the absence of any proper bifurcation analyses in the literature on the s fekete problems to assist our inquiries we have begun such a bifurcation analysis so far numerically for a few small n values in the process we discovered a previously undetected bifurcation in the n 7 point problem at s 0 where the local minimality is exchanged between the pentagonal bi pyramid and a c 2 1 123 f 5 configuration we have not confirmed that this family is truly globally minimizing for the interval 2 s 0 neither did we confirm that the pentagonal bi pyramid is globally minimizing for 0 s 1 yet we strongly suspect that all this is true we are planning a more detailed bifurcation analysis with special attention given to the 7 point problem to be reported on in a future publication we emphasize that a bifurcation analysis will be practically feasible only for moderate n values because the eigenvalue problems involve nontrivial 2 n 2 n matrices which will become difficult to handle when n gets too large we mentioned that computer experimental evidence suggests that the number of non globally minimizing configurations modulo rotations on s 2 is growing expo nentially with n cf erho 97 it would be good to have a rigorous proof together with a determination of the growth rate but to the best of our knowledge there is no rigorous estimate even of their number being finite this reminds one of smale s 6 th problem viz the celestial mechanical counterpart of such a finiteness proof an exponential growth rate of the number of locally minimizing configurations or perhaps of the number of equilibrium configurations is reminiscent of the complexity of the energy landscape see wal 04 as far as we know not much is known about the riesz s energy landscape for n point configurations on s 2 with the help of catalogs of non globally minimizing configurations and their energies it should be feasible to determine the experimental number counts of the local minimizers below a certain energy e see cetal 13 for a most recent study and additional references acknowledgement j b and m

configuration s s n has been solved completely for all n 2 only at the distinguished value s 2 by explicit calculation namely s 2 yields the energy law for the completely integrable newtonian n body problem with repulsive harmonic forces any n point configuration satisfying n i 1 qi 0 is a minimizing configuration of vs n and only such are the minimal energy reads v 2 n 1 2 n 1 n 1 109 the presumably next simplest parameter regime is s 2 here one is con fronted with the possibly startling observation that for large n the n tuple fekete points accumulate around two opposite points and the localization sharpens as n is getting larger this is a consequence of theorem 7 in bjo 56 in particular it follows right away from theorem 7 in bjo 56 that for even n the infimum vs n s 2 is achieved 34 if and only if half of the particles each are placed at two antipodal points 35 yielding vs n 1 s 2 s 1 1 n 1 n 1 s 2 n 2 n 110 which converges to v 2 n when taking the limit s 2 of 110 when n is odd the situation is already more tricky and more interesting for instance for the smallest allowed odd n 3 it is suggestive to conjecture that the minimizing configuration consists of the corners of an equilateral triangle in an arbitrary equatorial plane yet comparison with an antipodal configuration arrangement with two labeled points in the north and one in the south pole reveals that the equilateral configuration yields a lower average standardized riesz pair energy only for s 3 s 2 where s 3 ln 4 9 ln 4 3 while for s s 3 the antipodal arrangement yields the lower average standardized riesz pair energy in this case one can easily show rigorously that the antipodal arrangement is in fact optimal namely the equilateral triangle and the antipodal arrangement are the only equilibrium arrangements of 3 labeled points when comparing the average standardized riesz pair energy for antipodal and equilateral arrangements for other odd n this changeover happens only if n is a multiple of 3 the critical s 3 2 n 1 tends monotonically to 2 as n 3 2 n 1 of course this does not prove that either arrangement is optimal in the respective range of s to the best of our knowledge the optimal arrangement of odd n points as a function of s 2 is far from being settled 34 by theorem 7 of bjo 56 the infimum is not achieved by a proper n point configuration 35 this was already noted by rachmanov saff and zhou rsz 94 63 the concentration of the minimizing n point configuration for s 2 at a few distinct points indicates that the optimization problem is incorrectly posed in the set of proper n point configurations the deeper reason is that the riesz pair energy ceases to be positive definite in the sense of schoenberg sch 38 for s 2 interestingly the sum of distance problem for s 2 plays a central role in the theory of quasi monte carlo integration schemes 36 for functions in smooth enough function spaces over s 2 we refer the interested reader to bssw 14 brdi 13 a brdi 13 b and papers cited therein when s 2 the problem becomes drastically more complicated one needs to distinguish the cases 2 s 2 s 2 s 2 and the limit s the interval 2 s 2 is known as the potential theoretical regime since con cepts and methods of potential theory can be applied to study both the discrete and the continuous i e n optimization problems 37 within this regime the integer values s 1 s 0 and s 1 are of particular interest when s 1 the minimal average standardized riesz pair energy problem is equivalent to the maximal average pairwise chordal distance problem see fejt 56 sto 75 bec 84 in brdi 13 b it is shown that maximum sum of distance configurations are ideal in tegration nodes for a certain optimal order quasi monte carlo integration scheme on s 2 we will come back to this in appendix d the case s 0 i e the limit s 0 which yields the logarithmic pair energy 2 also known as the coulomb energy for a pair of two dimensional unit point charges on s 2 respectively the kirchhoff energy kir 83 of a pair of unit point vortices on s 2 occurs in a stunning variety of problems on s 2 and other manifolds in the sciences and mathematics see e g fjm 92 shsm 93 chki 94 sato 97 bcnt 02 ketal 04 nech 09 for 10 kiwa 12 originally smale s 7 th problem for the 21 st century sma 98 was formulated for the logarithmic energy see below lastly the value s 1 yields the coulomb pair energy of three dimensional unit point charges associated with the so called thomson prob lem see tho 04 why 52 erho 97 aetal 97 petal 97 bcgmz laf 13 amongst the values s 2 the borderline value s 2 is special in the sense that the finite n behavior is qualitatively different from both the regime 2 s 2 and the regime s 2 yet it can be understood by considering a certain limit process s 2 cf caha 09 for the limit process s d in analogous optimization problems formulated on d dimensional manifolds the riesz pair interaction for s 2 in physics considered as correction term to newton s gravity man 25 is also special in 36 an important special case of quasi monte carlo schemes are the so called t designs which can be characterized by polynomial energy functionals slwo 09 37 the potential function q 7 vs q is strictly superharmonic i e vs q 0 in r 3 for s 2 1 harmonic vs q 0 for s 1 and strictly subharmonic vs q 0 for s 1 2 here is the laplacian in the ambient space r 3 and r 3 is r 3 with its origin removed one consequence is thatn point configurations with minimal average standardized riesz pair energy in the closed unit ball in r 3 live on its boundary s 2 in the superharmonic case but extend into the solid in the subharmonic case as some points need to move into the volume to lower the energy charge injection cf lan 72 ber 86 64 the sense that it yields a newtonian n body problem in r 3 with additional isolating integrals of motion boib 89 lybe 99 cale 13 besides those associated with galilei invariance restricted to r the motion is even completely integrable for all n cal 71 mos 75 the large s behavior of vs n n fixed is intimately connected with the classi cal tammes s problem tam 30 or hard sphere best packing problem cf cosl 99 that is to find a configuration of n points on the sphere with the minimal pairwise chordal distance between the points being as large as possible 38 it is not too difficult to see cf appendix b that for any n point configuration n q 1 qn s 2 the following limit relation holds lim s vs n 1 s 1 s min 1 i j n qi qj n 111 moreover whenever a family of minimizing configurations sn converges to a limit configuration n one has the relation cf appendix b lim s vs n 1 s 1 s n n 112 where n is the best packing chordal distance which maximizes the least distance n among all n point configurations on s 2 and n is the best packing configura tion 39 the best packing distance n is only known for n 2 3 12 and 24 cf fejt 43 schw 51 rob 61 bor 83 dan 86 40 another way of obtaining a nontrivial limit problem is to let s in vs r which gives v r lim s vs r if r 1 0 if r 1 113 in that case v n 0 for n n while v n for n n viz n is the maximum number of non overlapping calottes with spherical radius 6 which can be placed on the unit sphere by picking any ball b from a hexagonal close packing hcp of r 3 with unit balls then projecting its 12 nearest neighbors unit balls radially onto the surface of the central ball b one sees that n 12 and dividing the surface area of the unit sphere 4 by the area of a calotte 2 3 yields 14 92820323 giving the upper bound n 15 but how large is n exactly 38 from bhs 07 it readily follows that a certain limit of the leading coefficient in the asymptotic expansion of vs n for large n and the d sphere is closely related to the largest sphere packing density in rd only the densities for d 1 2 and 3 are known and only quite recently hales hal 05 could settle the last case by proving the famous kepler conjecture which states that no packing of congruent balls in euclidean space has density greater than the density of the face centered cubic packing which is identical to the density of the hexagonal close packing 39 see clke 86 mks 77 for tables of of n and numerical values of n 40 very recently a proof for n 13 has been proposed in muta 12 65 interestingly the sharp value for n is found by studying the related tammes problem for 2 n 12 one has 41 n 1 l fejes to th s famous inequality fejt 43 n 2 4 cosec 6 n n 2 2 where equality holds only for n 3 4 6 and 12 gives n 1 for n 14 from bava 08 follows 13 1 hence n 12 to our best knowledge the following point sets are the only ones for which one can rigorously prove that they have minimal average standardized riesz pair energy for all s 2 one can easily characterize the minimizing configuration explicitly only when n 2 or 3 as the antipodal and equilateral configuration respectively the minimizing configuration has been characterized explicitly also for n 4 6 and 12 as the vertices of platonic solids 42 tetrahedron octahedron and icosahedron which are known to be universally optimal see coku 07 such configurations minimize the potential energy of completely monotonic pair energy functions the standardized riesz pair energies for s 2 including the logarithmic pair energy at s 0 fall into this category the listed configurations for n 2 3 4 6 and 12 exhaust the possibilities for universally optimal configurations on s 2 cf lee 57 coku 07 the surprisingly difficult task of finding a proof of minimality can perhaps be best illustrated with the only partly resolved five point problem on s 2 it is clear from coku 07 prop 14 that there is no universally optimal 5 point configuration on s 2 indeed computational optimization reveals that the minimal energy arrangement of five labeled points on s 2 changes many times as s varies over the real line 43 thus for s 2 368335 an antipodal arrangement with two labeled points in the south and three in the north pole say is the optimizer at s 2 368335 a crossover takes place and for 2 368335 s 2 the energy minimizing arrangement of five labeled points is an isosceles triangle on a great circle with one point in the north pole and two labeled points each in the other two corners with numerically optimized height at s 2 the isosceles arrangement bifurcates off of a continuous family of rectangular pyramids with height h 5 4 all of which have the same energy 3 4 at s 2 and of which the isosceles arrangement is the degenerate limit at s 2 also another crossover happens and for 2 s 15 048077392 the regular triangular bi pyramid is the putative energy minimizing configuration at s 15 048077392 yet another crossover happens at which the triangular 41 in particular 12 1 051462225 implies that the 12 calotte arrangement hcp obtained from the hexagonal close packing of r 3 which has hcp 1 is not the optimizer of the tammes problem with n 12 which is 12 the regular icosahedron 42 surprisingly perhaps the vertices of the platonic cube n 8 have a higher average pair energy than the square antiprism derived from the cube by twisting angle of 45 degrees and squeezing together two opposite faces of the cube similarly the dodecahedron n 20 is not a minimizing configuration either for any s 2 43 the numerical study for s 2 is our own for 1 s 400 and s cf mks 77 66 bi pyramid and a square pyramid with height h 1 1385 have the same average standardized riesz pair energy a square pyramid with numerically optimized height 44 as function of s appears to have lower standardized riesz pair energy for s 15 04807 lastly it is well known that the triangular bi pyramid and the square pyramid with height 1 both are particular best packing configurations with 5 2 so that at s an asymptotic crossover or degenerate bifurcation happens how much of this has been proved rigorously by traditional methods see dlt 02 it can be shown that the triangular bi pyramid consisting of two antipodal points at say the north and the south pole and three equally spaced points on the equator is the unique up to orthogonal transformation minimizer of the logarith mic average pair energy the proof that the same configuration maximizes the sum of distances that is assumes v 1 5 is computer aided exploiting interval methods and related techniques see hosh 11 in schw 13 a computer aided approach is proposed to show optimality of the triangular bi pyramid for s 1 and s 2 the optimality of both the triangular bi pyramid and the family of rectangular pyramids with height 5 4 at s 2 can be shown with elementary techniques the rest of the s parameter regime still awaits its rigorous treatment 45 numerical results in mks 77 carried out with varying s 1 400 for n 2 16 fixed suggest that also for other values of n 6 2 3 4 6 12 the mini mizing configuration sn may generally change as s passes through critical values and their number seem to depend on n in particular for n 7 there seem to be three critical s values in 1 6 at which the minimizing configuration changes and presumably a few more when s 1 cf beha 77 for s 1 the general dependence on s of the optimal n point configurations sn is one of the intriguing features of this minimization problem all the same it makes it plain why the rigorous determination of the optimizers is a highly nontrivial task even for moderate n values other than the special ones 2 3 4 6 12 becoming hopelessly complicated when n increases yet the large n asymptotics of the minimal average standardized riesz pair energy vs n can be determined without seeking the exact fekete points see rsz 94 in particular limn vs n is for all s determined by the variational principle 46 see sze 24 bjo 56 lan 72 kisp 99 lim n vs n inf p s 2 s 2 s 2 vs p q dp dq 114 here p s 2 is the set of all borel probability measures supported on s 2 for s 2 the minimizer is not unique but all minimizers are known in particular for 44 curiously for 2 s 0 the optimal height of the square pyramidal configuration is constant equal to 5 4 only for s 0 does the optimized height depend on s 45 the five point problem on the sphere can be also studied as unconstrained external field problem in the plane j b manuscript in preparation 46 our usage here of both p and q as points in space i e on s 2 should not be confused with the usage in hamiltonian dynamics of p q as a pair of canonical variables 67 s 2 the minimizer after factoring out so 3 is a symmetric measure which is concentrated on two antipodal points see bjo 56 from classical potential theory cf lan 72 for s 0 2 and bjo 56 for s 2 0 47 it is well known that the uniform normalized lebesgue surface area measure on s 2 denoted by uniquely minimizes the right hand side in 114 for 2 s 2 for s 2 the l h s and r h s of 114 are both in this case the rate of divergence of vs n can be determined it suffices to know that for large n the voronoi cells around the charges are mostly hexagons of a certain size see saku 97 for an enlightening discussion 48 the picture one should have in mind when n is large is a vast sea of hexagonal voronoi cells around most of the points thus the dual structure of the voronoi cell decomposition the delaunay triangulation is a network of mostly six fold coordinated sites the reason for the qualification mostly lies in the topology of the sphere which gives rise to geometric frustration see samo 99 for a thorough exposition of this notion certain points pick up a topological charge that measures the departure from the ideal coordination number 6 of the planar triangular lattice the celebrated euler theorem of topology yields that the total topological charge on s 2 is always 12 this accounts for example for the appearance of 12 isolated pentagons in the common soccer ball design for large n one observes scars emerging from these isolated centers that attract pentagon heptagon pairs having total topological charge 0 scars and other topology induced defects of the hexagonal lattice become important when pushing the asymptotic analysis to higher order and are not well understood for instance to the best of our knowledge it is an unresolved question if there are n gon voronoi cells with n 8 in a minimizing configuration see bogi 09 for an approach using elastic continuum formalism the truly hard regime is the vast intermediate range of n which are generically too large to allow for an explicit determination of the minimizing configuration but not large enough for the asymptotic formulas to yield sufficiently accurate results this concludes our brief survey of this fascinating field further information can be found in the survey articles erho 97 saku 97 hasa 04 and on the websites bcgmz and wom 09 see also the delightful article atsu 03 where based on numerical evidence the first dozen minimizers are discussed mostly for thomson s problem s 1 47 the investigation of the energy integral s 2 s 2 p q dp dq real can be traced back to posz 31 48 this also works for s 2 cf ber 86 where a semi continuous approach is used to model the large n behavior 68 appendix b in this appendix we supply the proofs of relations 111 and 112 which control the limit s proof of relation 111 suppose n q 1 qn s 2 is a fixed n point set with separation distance n min 1 i j n qi qj then using that the function f x x 1 s is strictly decreasing for s 0 we find that vs n 1 s 1 s 1 s 2 n n 1 1 i j n 1 qi qj s 1 s n 1 s 2 n n 1 1 i j n n qi qj s 1 s n 1 s 1 s n on the other hand retaining only one of the least distance pairs in the double sum yields vs n 1 s 1 s 1 s 2 n n 2 1 n s 1 s n 1 s 1 s 2 n n 2 1 s n as s this completes the proof of 111 proof of relation 112 let sn qs 1 qsn s 2 denote a minimizing n point set and suppose n is a best packing configuration with n n then first of all vs sn vs n but vs sn vs n and so by 111 we have lim inf s vs n 1 s 1 s n n 115 69 on the other hand using that qsi qsj sn for at least one pair i j and furthermore that sn n we obtain vs sn 1 s 1 s 2 n n 1 1 i j n qsi qsj s n s 1 s 2 n n 1 1 i j n n qsi qsj s n s 1 s 2 n n 1 0 hence vs sn 1 s 1 s n s 1 s n n 1 2 1 s n as s but again vs sn vs n and so we get lim sup s vs n 1 s 1 s n 116 by 115 and 116 lim s vs n 1 s 1 s n this completes the proof of 112 70 appendix c we now prove the strict monotonic increase of s 7 vs n proof of relation 14 we begin with the observation that the map s 7 vs r is monotone increasing for all r 0 2 in fact strictly so except when r 1 to see this take the first partial derivative of vs r w r t s to get svs r s 2 r s 1 s 1 r s ln r 117 clearly r h s 117 0 if r 1 we now show that r h s 117 0 if r 6 1 to this end now take the first partial derivative of svs r w r t r to get r svs r r s 1 ln r 118 clearly r h s 118 0 iff r 1 thus r 7 svs r has a critical point at r 1 and only this one finally take the second partial derivative of svs r w r t r to get 2 r svs r r s 2 1 1 s ln r 119 evaluating r h s 119 at r 1 yields 2 r svs 1 1 thus for each s the map r 7 svs r has a non degenerate minimum at r 1 with value 0 and no other critical point therefore svs r 0 with 0 iff r 1 with the help of this calculus result we now conclude that whenever s t then vs n vs sn vt sn vt tn vt n 120 here the strict inequality holds because there is no optimizing n point configuration on s 2 with all pairs having distance 1 this completes the proof 71 appendix d spherical digital nets maximal sum of distance points i e optimal configurations sn for s 1 provide optimal integration nodes for equal weight numerical integration rules on the sphere see brdi 13 b and bssw 14 brwo in general such configurations are obtained by solving a highly non linear optimization problem which makes them impractical for large number of points digital nets and sequences introduced in nie 87 are efficiently computable so called low discrepancy point systems in the unit square that define effective quasi monte carlo rules for integrating functions on the unit square 1 n n j 1 f xj 0 1 2 f x dx informally speaking the points of a digital net in 0 1 2 are distributed in such a way that a large number of elementary rectangles contain precisely the fraction of all points that corresponds to their area cf dipi 10 and fig 15 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 figure 15 2048 sobol points in the unit square generated using a method by joku 03 this distribution property remains unchanged when lifting a digital net and ele mentary rectangles now called spherical rectangles to s 2 using the area preserving lambert transformation of the map makers these spherical digital nets are studied in brdi 12 and abd 12 of particular interest is that numerically they are com 72 parable with maximal sum of distance points it is conjectured 49 that v 1 sphdnn will approach the same limit as v 1 n with the same rate of convergence as n we tested for local concavity a sequence of n point spherical digital nets formed by the first n points of a sobol sequence lifted to the sphere for the implementation of the sobol points we used joku 03 cf fig 15 the graph of n 7 v 1 sphdnn fig 16 shows an overall concave shape 0 500 1000 1500 2000 0 341 0 340 0
