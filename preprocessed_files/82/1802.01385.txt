paper and a brief survey of the chiral anomaly i proceed to review some basic elements of the theory of the quantum hall effect in 2 d incompressible electron gases in an external magnetic field hall insulators i discuss the origin and role of anomalous chiral edge currents and of anomaly inflow in 2 d insulators with ex plicitly or spontaneously broken time reversal i e in hall insulators and chern insulators the topological chern simons action yield ing the large scale response equations for the 2 d bulk of such states of matter is displayed a classification of hall insulators featuring

problems are described and a problem in cos mology related to axionic insulators is mentioned as far as the quantum hall effect and the spin currents in time reversal invariant 2 d topological insulators are concerned this review is based on extensive work my collaborators and i carried out in the early 1990 s dedicated to the memory of ludvig dmitrievich faddeev a great scientist who will

field theory to condensed matter physics more specifically to the theoretical analysis of novel topologically protected states of matter this is an area that has been of much interest to me ever since the late 1980 s and to which i have made contributions that i feel are in teresting and important for this reason it makes sense to highlight them one more time trying to put the emphasis on some of the most important concepts and most elegant ideas the results sketched in the following are based on the papers 1 2 3 4 5 6 and references given therein all pub lished in the early nineties i am confident that the material exposed here would have interested ludvig faddeev among many other important contributions he greatly enhanced our mathematical understanding of quantum gauge theories and of the origin and implications of the chiral anomaly some of his results on gauge theories and anomalies provide the theoretical underpinning for much of what i will discuss in the following i start by sketching the general motivation underlying the efforts of my collaborators and myself see 4 5 6 7 8 that have led to the results dis cussed in the following key purposes of our work are to classify bulk and surface states of systems of condensed matter using concepts and results from gauge theory current algebra and general relativity in particular effective actions generating func tionals of connected current green functions yielding expressions for transport coefficients such as conductivities via kubo formulae are used extensively in our analysis their form being constrained by gauge invariance by the cancellation of gauge anomalies between bulk and surface terms holography and by locality unitarity and power counting it turns out that these general principles completely deter mine the most relevant terms in the effective actions of for example insulators using effective actions one discovers new ways of charac terizing novel states of matter as indicated next to complement the landau theory of phases and phase transitions by a gauge theory of phases states of matter with the purpose of 2 describing novel topologically protected states of matter that cannot be characterized by a local order parameter to apply our gauge theory of phases of matter to extend or de velop the theory of the fractional quantum hall effect our work extended over the period from 1989 2012 the theory of time reversal invariant topological insulators and of topological superconductors our first paper appeared in 1993 a description of higher dimensional cousins of the quantum hall effect with applications in cosmology e g towards understand ing the origin of intergalactic primordial magnetic fields in the universe etc 1999 the present the chiral anomaly while vector currents j are usually conserved i e j 0 axial cur rents j 5 defined on space times of even dimension fail to be conserved i e tend to be anomalous when coupled to gauge fields even if they are associated with massless matter fields this phenomenon is called chiral anomaly see 9 and references given there let e denote the electric field and b the magnetic field or induction in two space time dimensions the chiral anomaly is expressed by j 5 2 e q 2 where q is the electric charge of a massless field that gives rise to the current j 5 and is planck s constant and by the non vanishing anomalous equal time commutator j 05 y t j 0 x t i x y in four space time dimensions the anomaly is expressed by j 5 e b and the anomalous commutator j 05 y t j 0 x t i b y t y x y 3 for a massive matter field there are additional terms contributing to the divergence j 5 of the axial current that are proportional to the mass m of that field it is then obvious that the chiral currents j j j 5 and j r j j 5 are anomalous too the signs of their divergence being opposite to one an other in this paper we will not make use of anomalous commutators but they play an important role in the study of transport in dissipationless one dimensional and three dimensional conductors see 7 8 faddeev and collaborators 10 contributed important insights to a clear un derstanding of the mathematics underlying the chiral anomaly and anoma lous commutators contents credits and acknowledgements this paper is devoted to reviewing efforts to understand novel states of mat ter that i have personally been involved in and that have spanned more than two decades i think they have yielded a number of important and elegant results of course numerous other people have contriubuted important in sights towards clarifying issues discussed in this paper and it is completely impossible to do justice to all their contributions in a short review like this one some of the results on the fractional quantum hall effect described in section 2 overlap with independent ones due to xiao gang wen 11 1 ideas and results concerning 2 d time reversal invariant topological insulators re lated to some of the ones described in section 3 of this paper have also been brought forward by shoucheng zhang and collaborators and will be referred to later 2 in section 4 some results on 3 d time reversal invariant topologi cal insulators including axionic insulators are reviewed these results too overlap with ones described by shoucheng zhang and collaborators i am indebted to the following colleagues and friends for collaboration and or many illuminating discussions on the subject matter covered in this review and for encouragement 1 i will not review work on the integer quantum hall effect in 2 d non interacting electron gases and i refrain from quoting papers on this effect because there are too many of them and they are well known 2 however their work only appeared several years after the publication of the one of my collaborators and myself 4 a alekseev s bieri a boyarsky v cheianov g m graf b i halperin t kerler i levkivskyi l molenkamp g moore b pedrini o ruchayskiy c schweigert e

chiral edge currrents effective actions classification of hall fluids setup basic quantities we consider a two dimensional electron gas 2 d eg forming at the interface between an insulator and a semi conductor when a gate voltage is applied see fig 1 the gas is confined to a domain in the xy plane a uniform magnetic field b 0 is applied to the system the so called filling factor n e b 0 h c where n is the particle density of the 2 d eg e is the elementary electric charge and c is the speed of light is chosen such that the longitudinal resis tance rl of the gas vanishes it is known experimentally that such filling factors exist and these findings are supported by numerical simulations but there are essentially no analytical results that enable us to understand why at certain values of the longitudinal resistance vanishes or put differently why there is a strictly positive mobility gap above the ground state energy here we will not consider this difficult problem but see e g 12 3 rather we assume that at certain values of the filling factor rl vanishes and then derive non trivial mathematically precise consequences of this assumption 3 i refer the reader to 13 and 14 and references given there for much useful infor mation on the quantum hall effect 5 fig 1 caption schematic representation of the experimental setup and of exper imental results on the qhe observations rl 0 h plateau plateau heights e 2 h q the cleaner the sample the more numerous are the observed plateaux and the narrower they are if h e 2 h z there appear to exist fractional electric charges applications metrology novel computer memories topological quantum comput ing using quasi particles with non abelian braid statistics 15 we first study the response of the 2 d eg to small perturbations in the external electromagnetic field e and b we set btot b 0 b b b e e 1 e 2 note that as long as electron spin is neglected only the components e of the electric field parallel to the sample plane and the component b of the magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane enter the laws of motion of electrons in the domain the field tensor of the electromagnetic field on the three dimensional space time of the 2 d eg is then given by f 0 e 1 e 2 e 1 0 b e 2 b 0 when interpreted as a 2 form f is the exterior derivative da of a 1 form a a dx where x x 0 t x x x 1 x 2 r 2 and a is the electromagnetic vector potential 6 electrodynamics of 2 d incompressible electron gases the electric current density in the 2 d eg is defined by j x j x a 0 1 2 where j x is the quantum mechanical vector current density an operator valued distribtuion and a is the state of the eg in the presence of an external electromagnetic field with vector potential a we begin by summarizing the basic equations governing the electrodynam ics in the bulk of a 2 d eg which for e 0 and b 0 is assumed to be incompressible i e rl 0 i hall s law assuming that rl 0 j x h e x 1 where h is the hall conductivity and e is the vector arising from counter clockwise rotation of e in the xy plane of the sample through an angle of 90 this equation shows that space reflections in lines p and time rever sal t are not symmetries of the gas i e are broken which is of course a consequence of the presence of the external magnetic field b 0 ii charge conservation t x j x 0 2 iii faraday s induction law t

the z direction orthogonal to we find the 7 iv chern simons gauss law j 0 x hb x 5 combination of laws 1 and 5 yields j x 1 2 h f x 6 next when combining laws ii iii and eq 6 we seemingly conclude that 0 2 j 3 6 1 2 h f 6 0 7 wherever h 6 const e g at we seem to arrive at a contradiction well actually there isn t any contradiction the point is that the current density j appearing in eq 6 is the bulk current density j bulk which is not the conserved total electric current density j tot j tot j bulk j edge with j tot 0 8 where j edge is the edge current density a current distribution with sup port on all lines in across which the value of h jumps in particular supp j edge contains the boundary edge of the gas in general only j tot is conserved but j bulk j edge 6 0 as follows from eqs 7 and 8 anomalous chiral edge currents the edge current density is defined in such a way that supp j edge supp h jedge h one may view it as an instance of holography that on supp h j edge 8 j bulk supp h 6 he supp h 9 where e is the component of the electric field e supp h perpendicular to h eq 9 is the chiral anomaly in 1 1 dimensions 8 the edge current j edge j r is an anomalous chiral current in 1 1 dimensions at the edge of the sample the lorentz force acting on the electrons must be cancelled by the force confining the electrons to the interior of the domain hence e c btotv vedge where v is the propagation speed of an electron moving along and vedge is the potential of the force confining the electrons to the interior of the chiral nature of j egde becomes obvious from figure 2 fig 2 caption skipping orbits of electrons moving along the boundary edge of a 2 d electron gas confined to a disk electrons near perform a chiral motion classically the orbits of electrons moving close to the edge of the sample are so called skipping orbits which describe a chiral motion of electrons the chirality being determined by the direction of b 0 there is an analogous phenomenon in classical physics namely in the theory of hurricanes under the replacements b earth angular velocity lorentz force coriolis force vedge air pressure the theory of charge transport in a 2 d eg close to the edge of the sam ple is mapped to the theory of air transport in a hurricane near the sur face of the earth actually one may view a hurricane as an example of a hall effect in a rotating gas it is expected that a quantized hall effect is encountered in a rapidly rotating layer of a superfluid bose gas see last subsection of sect 1 recall that the chiral anomaly in 1 1 d says that for j edge j j edge 1 h q 2 e 9 h 1 h q 2 10 9 where q eq is the electric charge of an edge current corresponding to a counterclockwise chiral edge mode similar contributions come from clockwise modes but with a reversed sign on the right side in eq 10 equation 10 yields a precise expression for the hall conductivity h in terms of charges of chiral currents circulating at the edge of the integer quantum hall effect is observed if the charge quantum numbers q 1 for all the observation of a system in a fractional quantum hall state then implies that there are currents carried by chiral modes with fractional charge circulating at the edge of the system apparently starting from the basic equations of the electrodynamics of a 2 d eg in an external electromagnetic field we are led to rediscover halperin s edge currents 16 see also 17 edge and bulk effective actions eq 10 shows that if h e 2 h z then there must exist fractionally charged modes quasi particles propagating along supp h and in particular along the quantum mechanical chiral edge current density j edge turns out to generate a u 1 current algebra that can be described in terms of free massless chiral bose fields the green functions of j edge can be derived from the anomalous chiral action r a in 1 1 dimensions see eq 12 below where a is the restriction of the vector potential a to the boundary r of the space time of the 2 d eg the action r a is anomalous in the sense that it is not invariant under gauge transformations of a the anomaly of r a is a consequence of the fact that the chiral edge current j edge is not conserved i e is anomalous the anomaly of the edge current must be cancelled by the anomaly of the bulk current j bulk see eq 9 the generating function of the green functions of the bulk current density is the bulk effective action s r a which we will determine presently this action is not invariant under gauge transformations of a either its variation under gauge transformations of a must be cancelled by the gauge variation of an appropriate multiple of the anomalous chiral action r a next we derive the expression for the bulk effective action by the definition of effective actions the bulk current is given by the variational 10 derivative of s r a with respect to a thus j bulk x j bulk x a s r a a x 6 1 2 h f x x r it follows that s r a h 4 r a da 11 note that the action s r a is not invariant under gauge transformations of a not vanishing at the boundary r of the space time of the sample the total effective action is obtained by adding to the anomalous chern simons action in eq 11 the anomalous chiral action r a see eq 12 below multiplied by a coefficient chosen in such a way that the total action is gauge invariant in fact the coefficient in front of r a must be equal to h this observation implies that the bulk definition of the hall conductivity coincides with its edge definition a conclusion that first appeared in 2 4 finally we present an expression for the anomalous chiral action r of a single chiral matter field on r coupled to a vector potential a r a 1 2 r a a 2 a 2 a d 2 u 12 where a a du a du a and u u are light cone coordinates on the boundary r of the space time of the sample exercise check that the anomaly of the bulk chern simons action s r a in 11 which is a boundary term is cancelled by the one of h r a whatever we have said about 2 d electron gases in a homogeneous ex ternal magnetic field exhibiting the quantum hall effect can be extended to so called chern insulators 18 see also 2 which have the property that reflections in lines parity and time reversal are broken even in the absence of an external magnetic field e g because of magnetic impurities in the bulk an experimental realization of haldane s model 18 has been described in 19 the low energy physics of quasi particles in the bulk of a chern insulator may resemble the one of two component relativistic dirac fermions coupled to the electromagnetic vector potential with an effective action given by 11 with a atot and h e 2 2 h chern number of a certain vector bundle of dirac fermion wave functions over the brillouin zone t 2 11 classification of abelian hall fluids and chern insulators next i sketch a general classification 5 of 2 d insulators with broken time reversal and parity in topologically protected states i e groundstates of many body hamiltonians with a strictly positive mobility gap above the goundstate energy exhibiting quasi particles with abelian braid statistics 15 non abelian states are discussed in 20 explicit results will be limited to hall fractions in the interval 0 1 in the following jtot denotes the total electric current density bulk edge which is conserved i e j tot 0 we consider a general ansatz jtot m 1 q j where the densities j are separately conserved current densities corre sponding to different quasi particle species and the coefficients q r are charges in the simple case of the integer quantum hall effect for non interacting electrons labels filled landau levels of which there are m and q 1 on a three dimensional simply connected space time r a conserved current density j can be derived from a vector potential if j denotes the 2 form dual to j then conservation of j implies that dj 0 and hence j db by poincare s lemma where the 1 form b is the vector potential of j and is determined by the current density up to the gradient of a scalar function i e b and b d yield the same current density j chern simons effective action of conserved currents henceforth we use units where e 2 h 1 for a 2 d insulator i e a state of matter protected by a mobility gap above the groundstate energy the field theory of the conserved currents j m 1 in the limit of very large distance scales and very low frequencies must be topological if parity and time reversal are broken the most relevant contribution to the action of the currents j is the chern simons action s b a m 1 b db a q db boundary terms 13 12 where a is the electromagnetic vector potential and the boundary terms must be added to cancel the anomalies of the chern simons terms 1 st term on right side in 13 under the gauge transformations b b d and a a d

theory are labelled by networks of wilson lines contained in the half space r corresponding to negative values of the time variable and ending in points of the spatial surface 0 scalar products of physical states of the chern simons theory with action given by 13 can be calculated by inserting into the gaussian functional integral on the left side of eq 14 networks of wilson lines contained in hooked up to reflected networks of wilson lines contained in r at common intersection points in 0 so as to yield a network of gauge invariant wilson networks loops the hamiltonian of chern simons theory vanishes bulk excitations are static reflecting the feature that there is a positive mobility gap above the groundstate energy classification of 2 d abelian topological insulators with broken time reversal bulk degrees of freedom the operator measuring the electric charge of an excitation of the chern simons theory with action given by 13 contained in a region o of space 0 is given by qo o j 0 x d 2 x m 1 q o b the electric charge deposited inside the domain o by excitations corre sponding to a network of wilson lines can be inferred by inserting besides 13 the wilson network hooked up to its reflection at 0 a wilson loop exp i t m 1 q o b t r into the functional integral see eq 14 if a network of wilson lines creates an excitation describing n electrons or holes located inside o from the ground state of the insulator then its electric charge as measured by the operator qo is given by n 2 k k 1 n where k is the number of holes if n is odd this excitation must have fermi dirac statistics if n is even it must have bose einstein statistics this relation between the electric charge of an excitation and its statistics implies that the m tuples of quantum numbers assigned to lines in wilson networks creating multi electron hole excitations must be sites of an odd integral lattice of rank m and that the co vector q q 1 qm must belong to the dual lattice in fact q must be a so called visible vector in see 5 6 hence h 1 m q 2 q i e the hall conductivity h is a rational multiple of e 2 h it takes some more effort to show that the so called witt sublattice of is an a d or e root lattice see 5 6 classification of 2 d abelian topological insulators with broken time reversal edge degrees of freedom the chiral anomaly in the form of eq 10 reflects the feature that there are several namely n species of gapless quasi particles propagating either clockwise or anti clockwise along the edge of the 2 d eg the dynamics of these quasi particles is described by n massless chiral scalar bose fields n 1 with propagation speeds v n 1 we choose a basis n 1 in field space such that the velocity matrix v n 1 is diagonal we then find that 1 the chiral electric edge current operator and the hall conductivity are given by j edge e n 1 q q q 1 q n and h e 2 h q q t 14 respectively 2 multi electron hole states localized along the edge of the 2 d eg are created by vertex operators exp i n 1 q q q 1 qn 16 where the double colons indicate wick ordering and is a lattice the electric charge carried by the vertex operator in 16 is given by e q q by the same reasoning process as above the relation between the charge of an edge excitation created by the vertex operator in 16 and its statistics implies that the quantum numbers q must correspond to sites in an odd integral lattice of rank n the witt sublattice of is an a d or e root lattice and gives rise to an a d or e kac moody current algebra at level 1 acting as a quantum symmetry on the edge states of the 2 d electron gas the matrix q q k k 1 n where for all k the vector q k determines a vertex operator creating a one electron state propagating along the edge of the 2 d eg is a close analogue of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa matrix of the weak sector of the standard model we conclude that 3 the classifying data for the edge degrees of freedom of a 2 d eg ex hibiting the quantum hall effect are given by q visible q v v n 1 17 the charged quasi particles predicted by these data exhibit abelian braid statistics and transform under a d or e kac moody symme tries at level 1 for ideal hall insulators one expects that and q q see previous subsection on bulk degrees of freedom but in general the two lattices and need not be identical this can happen when the edge 15 of a 2 d incompressible eg has a layered structure however in any case the constraint that the edge conductivity e 2 h q q t is equal to the bulk hall conductivity e 2 h q qt must always be satisfied as required by gauge invariance a partial classification of 2 d electron gases with quasi particles ex hibiting non abelian braid statistics and quantized hall conductivity has been presented in 20 it is an interesting partly open problem to classify egde degrees of free dom localized on interfacial lines at which two different electron gases with non vanishing hall conductivities 1 h 6 2 h 6 0 join success of classification comparison with data in 5 6 we have given a list of physically plausible odd integral lattices and visible vectors q with the property that 0 e 2 h 1 h 1 we write e 2 h 1 h nh dh where nh and dh are relatively prime integers with nh dh plotting dh vertically downwards and e 2 h 1 h horizontally to the right we have obtained the table displayed in fig 3 below comparing data on 2 d elec tron gases exhibiting the quantum hall effect observed in laboratories with our theoretical predictions this figure is taken from a plenary lecture i presented at the 1994 international congress of mathematicians in zurich 21 4 4 on this occasion i was kindly introduced to the audience by ludvig faddeev 16 fig 3 caption observed hall fractions h nh dh in the interval 0

bullet these are fractions for which the longitudinal resistance rl has a minimum very close to 0 and rh shows a plateau fractions for which rl has a minimum and rh shows an inflection are indicated by a circle if there are only weak experimental indications for a hall insulator state or if the data are controversial the symbol is used all bullets and circles in this figure and more are predicted theoretically see 5 6 hall fractions at which a magnetic field b and or density driven transition from one insulator state to another one at a constant value of h has been ob served are marked by the letters b n p b p in the interval 1 3 1 1 1 the agreement between our theory namely the classification of 2 d abelian hall insulator states as presented above and experimentally observed hall frac tions including the prediction of transitions at a constant value of h is nearly perfect only the fractions 8 13 and 10 17 are somewhat uncertain furthermore there are abelian and non abelian states at h 1 4 1 2 in double layer electron gases and at h 1 see 20 predictions of plateaux in the intervals p p p 2 3 are related to those in the interval 1 1 by the so called shift map see 6 20 for a detailed discussion of the shift map and of the kac moody symmetries of hall insulators alluded to above with h 1 as indicated in fig 3 see 5 6 20 17 rotating bose gases and a duality between pho tonics and electronics we conclude our discussion of hall and chern insulators with some remarks remark 1 a discussion of the relevance of the gravitational anomaly and of some new invariants for the theory of the quantum hall effect in a spirit somewhat related to the one of this review can be found in recent papers by p wiegmann and collaborators 22 remark 2 a very rapidly rotating 2 d layer of a superfluid bose gas of atoms with hard core repulsion between atoms may settle in a state analogous to a hall insulator the centrifugal force acting on the bosonic atoms in the gas may be precisely cancelled by a harmonic potential trapping the gas and the coriolis force then plays the role of the lorentz force acting on the electrons in a 2 d eg the energy levels of a bosonic atom precisely correspond to the landau levels of an electron in a 2 d eg this effect has first been sketched in 4 6 and discussed in considerably more detail in 23 among other papers the basic formalism can be found e g in 24 remark 3 in two space dimensions the electromagnetic vector potential a is dual to the vector potential b q b of the conserved electromagnetic current density j see eqs 13 and 14 under the replacements a 7 b b 7 a conventional 2 d insulators with time reversal symmetry are mapped to 2 d su perconductors and conversely as discussed in 6 furthermore electronic hall insulators are mapped to 2 d gapped photonic wave guides exhibiting extended elec tromagnetic surface waves assuming that time reversal is not a symmetry of the system the leading terms in the action of the electromagnetic field in such a wave guide are given by swg a 1 2 e 2 e x e x 1 b 2 x d 3 x h 4 a da h a 18 where is the dielectric tensor of the wave guide and is its magnetic permeability this is the action functional of massive qed in 2 1 space time dimensions see 25 the chern simons term a da on the right side of eq 18 arises from coupling the electromagnetic vector potential a to the electric current density j db as in a db assuming that the action functional for the vector potential b of the current density is given in the simplest instance by s b 1 h b db boundary action l r terms 18 as appropriate for an insulator with broken time reversal see eq 13 with n 1 the boundary action see 12 is there to restore gauge invariance i e invariance under b 7 b d of s b and l r terms stands for less infrared relevant terms in the action functional we then find the response equations f x b s b b x 1 h j x 19 with j db using arguments similar to those presented in connection with eqs 7 and 9 we find that quantized electromagnetic waves can propagate chirally and essentially without dispersion along the edge of such a wave guide 3 chiral spin currents in planar time reversal invariant topological insulators so far we have not paid attention to electron spin although there are actually 2 d eg exhibiting the fractional quantum hall effect where electron spin must be taken into account see 6 but it would take us too far off the main line of this paper to discuss this issue here in the theory of 2 d time reversal invariant topological insulators which we will sketch next electron spin undoubtedly plays a crucial role in order to prepare the ground for an account of this theory we briefly review the pauli equation for a non relativistic spinning electron in an arbitrary external electromagnetic field i d 0 t 2 2 m d d t 20 where m is the effective mass of an electron t x t x t x l 2 r 3 c 2 is a two component pauli spinor describing the state of an electron located at the point x at time t and the operators d 0 and d d 1 d 2 d 3 are covariant derivatives given by i d 0 i t e w 0 zeeman coupling w 0 c 1 b 4 v 21 where is the electrostatic potential 1 2 3

inertial laboratory frame furthermore 19 i dk i k eak mvk wk 22 k 1 2 3 where a a 1 a 2 a 3 is the electromagnetic vector potential and wk is given by wk e c 2 v k spin orbit interactions with e 4 mc 23 describing spin orbit interactions and thomas precession 5 note that the 2 2 matrices w 0 and wk k 1 2 3 determine an su 2 gauge field connection on the bundle of two component pauli spinors over space time and that the pauli equation 20 obeys u 1 em su 2 spin gauge invariance for a detailed discussion of the pauli equation and its gauge invariance as well as plenty of physical consequences thereof see 4 6 effective action of a 2 d time reversal invariant topo logical insulator next we consider a 2 d gas of interacting electrons confined to a domain in the xy plane assuming that b and e v then the su 2 connection w is given by w 3 3 with wk 0 k 1 2 for 0 1 2 thus the connection determining parallel transport of the component of a pauli spinor is given by a w while parallel transport of is determined by a w with a 0 e ak eak mvk and w w 3 these connections are abelian i e just affect the phases of and respectively under time reversal the components of these connections transform as follows a 0 a 0 ak ak but w 0 w 0 wk wk 24 the term in the effective action of a 2 d insulator with the smallest scaling dimension i e the term dominating the large scale physics is a chern simons term if there were only the gauge field a with w 0 or only the gauge field w with a 0 a chern simons term would not be invariant under time reversal and the dominant term in the effective action would be given by s a r d 3 x e e 1 b 2 25 with the dielectric tensor and the magnetic permeability this is the effective action of a conventional time reversal invariant insulator but in the presence of 5 one should actually also include the spin connection of the sample geometry in the definition of the su 2 gauge field w see 4 20 electron spin and hence of two gauge fields a and w satisfying 24 the dominant term is a time reversal invariant combination of two chern simons terms s a w 4 a w d a w a w d a w 2 a dw w da 26 this action reproduces an action similar to the one in 25 if the connection w is chosen as in 21 and 22 however the action 26 describes the response of a topological insulator for an arbitrary choice of the gauge field w w 3 the gauge fields a and w transform independently under gauge transformations and the chern simons action s a w in eq 26 is anomalous under gauge transformations of a w not vanishing at the boundary of a 2 d sample with space time given by r edge degrees of freedom spin currents the anomalous chiral boundary action a w a w 27 cancels the anomaly of the bulk action s a w in 26 the two terms in the boundary action are the generating functionals of connected green functions of two counter propagating chiral electric edge currents one carried by electrons with spin up the other one carried by electrons with spin down generating two u 1 current algebras thus whenever the edge degrees of freedom support a current then a net chiral edge spin current s 3 edge circulates at the boundary of the sample bulk response equations of a 2 d time reversal in variant topological insulator from the chern simons action s a w in eq 26 one easily derives the following response equations in the bulk of a 2 d topological insulator with unbroken time reversal invariance j x b and s 3 x s a w w x f x 28 where j is the electric current density in the bulk of the insulator and s 3 is the bulk spin current density more precisely its 3 component in spin space compare 21 to eqs 1 and 6 by arguments analogous to those in eqs 7 through 9 we see that eq 28 implies that the spin current s 3 is anomalous and that its anomaly is cancelled by a chiral egde spin current the chern simons effective action in 26 the response equations in 28 chiral spin currents and the role of spin orbit interactions in connection with the presence of a non trivial gauge field w have first been described among many other effects in 4 in 1993 see also 6 quasi particles in 2 d time reversal invariant topo logical insulators we should ask what kinds of quasi particles may induce the effective chern simons actions s a w 4 a w d a w a w see eq 26 where stands for spin up and stands for spin down it is well known that a two component relativistic dirac fermion with mass m 0 m 0 breaks time reversal invariance and when coupled to an abelian gauge field a induces a chern simons term 1 4 a da in the effective action see 25 thus a 2 d time reversal invariant topological insulator with chiral edge spin currents might exhibit two species of charged quasi particles in the bulk with one species spin up related to the other one spin down by time reversal each species having two degenerate states per wave vector and mimicking at small wave vectors a 2 component dirac fermion the value of the constant is then determined experiments other approaches chiral spin liquids materials with properties similar to those predicted by the theory described above have been studied experimentally in the group of l molenkamp in wu rzburg 26 more detailed theoretical aspects have been discussed in 28 29 however because of external electromagnetic fields violating the assumption that b and e and because of magnetic impurities in the material the property that w 0 0 w 3 will usually not hold exactly and hence the spin current s 3 is not conserved although s is always covariantly conserved 4 6 there then exist spin umklapp processes that cause transitions between the two chiralities of edge currents and hide the quantization of the value of for these reasons one cannot expect that real materials exactly reproduce the theoretical predictions of the theory sketched above 22 one may however expect that there are materials with edge currents j and jr of opposite chirality related to each other by time reversal that do not mix the current j may couple to a chiral abelian gauge field a and the current jr to a gauge field ar the effective actions of a and ar are given by 1 the anomalous action in 12 the two gauge fields may have the form a r a w where w is a berry connection the transformation of a and w under time reversal is the one given in 24 the theory sketched above provides a description of such materials this theory has the advantageous feature that it is not based on a single particle picture more recently z 2 topological invariants based on a single particle picture and characterizing non interacting time reversal invariant topological insulators have been studied by kane and mele and numerous further authors see e g 29 and references given there in 4 6 various further 2 d systems with somewhat exotic magnetic properties have been described for example it has been speculated see also 30 that there may be chiral spin liquids with broken time reversal symmetry not exhibiting any long range spin order the response laws for the spin current s of chiral spin liquids can be derived from a non abelian chern simons action k 4 tr w dw 2 3 w w w bd terms where k is an integer and w w dx is an su 2 gauge field coupling to electron spin with w w 4 3 d topological insulators axions encouraged by the findings of the last section we propose to consider insulators in three dimensions confined to a region r r 3 6 of space time we are interested in the general form of the effective action describing the response of such materials to turning on an external electromagnetic field until the mid nineties it was expected that the effective action of a 3 d insulator is always given by s a 1 2 dtd 3 x e e b 1 b 29 where a is the electromagnetic vector potential of the electromagnetic field e b is the dielectric tensor of the material and is the magnetic permeability tensor in 3 1 dimensions the action in 29 is dimensionless in the seventies particle theorists have taught us that one could add another dimensionless term to the action in 29 the term first introduced in qcd 23 an effective action with a topological term we replace the action s a by s a s a s a i a 0 2 30 where is the analogue of the vacuum angle in particle physcis and i is a topological term instanton number given by 4 2 i a 2 dtd 3 x e b fa fa stokes a da 31 see 6 31 30 the partition function of a topological insulator in three dimensions whose effective action is given by 30 and 31 is z a exp is a in the thermodynamic limit r 3 z a is periodic in with period 2 and invariant under time reversal iff 0 surface degrees of freedom a conventional insulator corresponds to 0 for the partition function z a has a boundary term given by exp i 4 a da 32 see 31 as mentioned in the last section this is the leading term in the parti tion function of 2 1 dimensional charged relativistic two component dirac fermions on coupled to an external electromagnetic field a two species of charged spin polarized quasi particles with a conical dispersion law mimicking a two component relativistic dirac fermion and propagating along the surface of the system may be encountered in certain 3 d topological insulators with two de generate bands communicating with each other and an effective action given by 30 31 with such systems support surface hall currents as is evident from the form of the surface action in 31 and 32 cf eq 11 they have been studied experimentally in 27 see also 31 axionic topological insulators one may wonder whether following ideas of peccei and quinn 32 it might make sense to view the angle as the groundstate expectation value of a dynamical 24 field and replace the term i a by i a 1 4 2 fa fa s 0 33 where s 0 is invariant under constant shifts 7 n n z and is a pseudo scalar field called axion field see 8 the effective action given in 33 then gives rise to halperin s 3 d hall effect j 1 2 2 d fa in particular j 1 2 2 e 34 in a crystalline insulator and for an axion linear in x cst k where by invariance under lattice translations k must belong to the dual lattice hence is quantized 6 it is argued that dynamical axions may emerge in certain topological insulators with anti ferromagnetic short range order and two bands of electron states communicating with each other the time derivative of then has the interpretation of a chemical potential conjugate to the axial charge the chiral anomaly tells us that d j 5 cst fa fa terms masses 35 the action of eq 33 has been proposed in 8 as the effective action describing a higher dimensional cousin of the hall effect and has been applied to the problem of unravelling possible origins of intergalactic primordial magnetic fields in the universe see also 7 later it appeared in 34 35 mott transition and instabilities in axionic topolog ical insulators it is interesting to analyze physical effects observable in putative states of matter described by the effective action stot a s a i a where s a is as in 29 and i a as in 33 since the action s 0 on the right side of eq 33 has been assumed to be periodic under constant shifts 7 n n z one may expect that at positive but low temperatures the bulk of such a state of matter will exhibit axion domain walls across which the mean value of changes by an integer multiple of recalling the insight described after 32 one predicts that gapless charged two component dirac fermions propagate along domain walls across which the mean value of changes by an odd multiple of we are thus led to predict that the formation of macroscopic axion domain walls 6 i thank gregory moore for having explained this point to me see 33 25 gives rise to a mott transition from an insulator to a state with non vanishing bulk conductivity due to the extended charged surface modes propagating along such domain walls see 30 axion electrodynamics exhibits some tantalizing instabilities one such insta bility triggered by the term i a manifests itself in the growth of long wave length magnetic fields in the bulk of the system see 7 8 a related instability has been described in 36 above a certain critical field strength ec a constant exter nal electric field e n with n 1 and e ec applied to an axionic topological insulator is screened with the excess field e ec n converted into a magnetic field expository articles covering theoretical and experimental aspects of topological insulators can be found e g in 37 38 conclusions and outlook the physics of 2 d and 3 d insulators is surprisingly rich and has potential to lead to promising technological applications interesting mathematical techniques ranging from abstract algebra over the topology of fibre bun dles all the way to hard analysis have non trivial applications to problems concerning these fascinating states of matter 2 d electron gases bose gases and magnetic materials represent stimulat ing play grounds for experimentalists and theorists alike not least because very general principles of quantum theory such as braid statistics fractional spin fractional electric charges anomalies and their cancellation current algebra and holography appear to manifest themselves in the arena of 2 d condensed matter physics unfamiliar species of quasi particles in particular two component dirac like fermions and majorana fermions are encountered in the physics of various exotic two and three dimensional systems whose exploration has begun only recently it is interesting to consider higher dimensional cousins of the qhe and of time reversal invariant topological insulators see 8 39 some of them might be relevant in cosmology e g in connection with the generation of intergalac tic primordial magnetic fields in the universe ideas on cosmology somewhat related to those reviewed in this paper are presently actively pursued many ideas originally developed in particle physics turn out to have fruitful applications in condensed matter physics likewise ideas originating in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics promise to have very interesting applica tions in cosmology but that s another story that i cannot go into here in any event these fields of physics appear to feature highly stimulating exchanges and fruitful interactions or call for such moreover different mathematical techniques and styles of research have turned out to be useful and to complement each other in productive ways in particle physics condensed matter physics and cosmology 26 new insights gained in pure mathematics sometimes have spectacular applications in physics and conversely yet disappointingly interactions across certain disci plinary boundaries apparently continue to be weaker than they ought to be and people in different communities are not seldom reluctant to profit from each other s experiences a
