federal de educao tecnolgica de minas gerais abstract we study the ising model on the square lattice z 2 and show via numerical simulation that allowing interactions between spins separated by distances 1 and m two ranges the critical temperature tc m converges monotonically to the critical temperature of the ising model on z 4 as m only interactions between spins located in directions parallel to each coordinate axis are considered we also simulated the model with interactions between spins at distances of 1 m and u three ranges with u a multiple of m in this case our results indicate that tc m u converges to the critical temperature of the model on z 6 for percolation analogous results were proven for the critical probability pc b n b de lima r p sanchis and r w c silva stochastic process appl 121 2043 2011 keywords multirange ising model phase transition percolation 1 introduction the ising model and percolation are among the most important models in statistical mechanics the former introduced in 1920 by wilhelm lenz 1 exhibits a continuous transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases as temperature t is varied while the latter proposed in 1957 by broadbent and hammersley 2 to characterize transport in random media exhibits a transition between phases with and without global connectivity as the concentration p is varied a key question regarding these models is the critical value tc or pc for the d dimensional hypercubic lattice zd the critical value is known exactly only for d 1 and d 2 3 4 5 although quite precise estimates for the critical point are available in some other cases 6 22 the exact values are unknown corresponding author email address charlesmat cefetmg br charles s do amaral preprint submitted to physical review e may 27

dimensions d 4 17 22 the authors of 23 consider percolation on zd adding bonds of n different lengths m 1 k 1 m 2 k 1 k 2 mn k 1 k 2 kn parallel to each coordinate axis where ki 2 3 for all i these authors prove that if d 2 the critical point converges to the critical point of percolation on zd n 1 as ki for all i in both bond and site percolation this model is called multirange percolation these authors also conjecture that convergence is monotone and nonincreasing in each variable ki recent numerical work suggests that if d 2 this conjecture is valid and the convergence follows a power law for n 1 and n 2 24 in addition to revealing an unexpected connection between critical values in systems of distinct connectivity this result allows estimation of the critical point in higher dimensions by simulating the model with multiple ranges in lower dimensions reducing computational complexity and cost these results raise the question of whether other models with local interactions and exhibiting phase transitions have properties similar to multirange percolation in this study we provide numerical evidence suggesting that this is the case for the ising model in d 2 dimensions for n 1 two ranges or n 2 three ranges our results apply to the critical temperature tc allowing its determination in higher dimensions by simulating the model with multiple ranges in lower dimensions turban 25 obtained analytical results for an ising model with n 1 in one dimension he studied a chain of n sites with m spin interactions with coupling constant j in a field h using a change of variables this model can be transformed into the multirange ising model in d 1 with n 1 and first neighbor interactions h and mth neighbor interactions j turban showed that this model can be reinterpreted as a 2 d ising model in zero external field and with first neighbor interactions h and j one for each direction on the rectangular lattice of size n m m in the thermodynamic limit n m and m this model displays the critical behavior of the two dimensional ising model similar results were obtained for the potts model 26 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the model and our simulation procedure section 3 discusses our results key conclusions and open questions are summarized in section 4 2 model and numerical procedure to define the multirange model we begin with the usual d dimensional cubic lattice zd and add bonds linking pairs of sites along the principal lattice directions the resulting graph g is characterized by n an integer 1 and a set of n integers k 1 kn all 2 such that the added bonds have length m 1 k 1 m 2 k 2 m 1 k 1 k 2 and so on up to mn k 1 kn thus a site x 1 x 2 xd zd is connected to its 2 d nearest neighbors x 1 1 x 2 xd x 1 1 x 2 xd x 1 xd 1 and in addition to sites at distances m 1 m 2 mn along all principal directions fig 1 shows for n 1 and m 1 2 a portion 2 figure 1 color online part of the graph with all bonds that terminate at one of the vertices x or y where n 1 and m 1 2 the length of bonds with colors black straight and red curved lines is 1 and m 1 respectively of the square lattice z 2 with the added bonds highlighted in red curves of the central pair of sites with the graph g defined as above we can implement many multirange statistical models spin systems lattice gases polymers by equipping the sites with appropriate variables or operators one of the simplest is the multirange ising model whose configurational energy in the absence of an external field is given by h j i j eg i j 1 where eg is the set of bonds of the graph g the spins i take values 1 1 and j is the coupling constant we take j 1 we use the wolff algorithm 15 to estimate the binder cumulant u and magnetic susceptibility on multirange graphs constructed on l l square lattices with peri odic boundaries for n 1 two ranges we simulate the model with m 1 m where m 2 5 8 10 13 16 19 for n 2 we use m 1 m and m 2 m 2 where m 2 6 we study system sizes 768 l 2048 n 1 and 1280 l 2560 n 2 note for n 1 with m 16 and m 19 and n 2 with m 6 we only consider 1024 l 2048 and 1536 l 2560 respectively to reduce finite size effects the number of wolff steps following equilibration ranges from 2 106 l 768 to 106 l 2560 we use the first fifth of the wolff steps for equilibration we estimate the inverse critical temperature kc m using a procedure similar to that of 16 initially we estimate the critical exponent through the relation du dk max l 1 2 3 figure 2 color online graphs obtained for n 2 considering m 2 size ranges 1 2 and 4 the plots shows the estimated kc m using the finite size scaling 3 considering the functions du dk black squares and red circles the lines correspond to fits as described in text where the left hand side represents the maximum of du dk for size l the effective inverse critical temperature kc m l for a system of length l can be taken as the value that maximizes du dk or thus for each m and l we obtain two estimates for kc m l given estimates kc m l for a series of l values kc m is estimated using the finite size scaling fss relation kc m kc m l l 1 l 2 3 where and are constants the correction term l 2 is used because without it the residuals for certain values of m and n exhibit a systematic parabolic dependence on l the values obtained for vary between 0 883 20 n 1 m 1 19 and 0 999 11 n 1 m 1 2 determination of critical exponents would require a systematic analysis of a larger range of system sizes in the present context we regard simply as a fitting parameter to estimate lim m kc m we use a three parameter fit of the form kc m am b c 4 details of the uncertainty analysis are provided in the appendix 4 table 1 fitting parameters for kc m using eq

inverse critical temperature of the ising model on z 4 0 1496947 5 17 for n 1 and on z 6 0 09229 4 18 for n 2 the small discrepancies between our results and literature estimates for kc z 4 and kc z 6 obtained using and dudk respectively are likely due to the limited number of wolff steps employed for each l value analyzed and or the limited number of m values analyzed our goal was to be able to study several cases to analyze the behavior of kc m varying m which required about five months of cpu time on 50 cores with speed 3 2 ghz on the basis of the results obtained and the fact that there is analytical proof of con vergence of pc for the multirange percolation model on the square lattice 23 we conjecture that the same holds for the multirange ising model all estimated values of kc m

m varies between 1 and u l 1536 the error bars are smaller than the symbols for the multirange percolation model with three ranges 1 m and u the effective critical point varies in an irregular manner when u is fixed and m varies between 1 and u 24 we obtain numerical evidence showing analogous behavior in the multirange ising model the effective inverse critical temperature kc m l was estimated considering u 15 and 1 m u for l 1536 using five independent samples see fig 4 4 conclusion we study the two dimensional ising model with multiple interaction ranges it is known that in percolation on zd with n 1 different ranges each being a multiple of the previous one the critical point converges to the critical point on zd n 1 for n 1 and d 2 we show via numerical simulation that when we consider the critical temperature instead of the critical point the same result is valid for the ising model if d 2 when n 1 or 2 we 6 conjecture that the more general result valid for percolation is also valid for the ising model for the case with three interaction ranges n 2 we find that when the length of the largest range is fixed then the critical temperature behavior is irregular if the range with intermediate length varies this fact supports the hypothesis that the length of each range has to be a multiple of the one of the length immediately below the present study raises the question whether other models with local interactions and which exhibit phase transitions have similar connections between the number of interaction ranges and the critical temperature in addition it also allows us to estimate the critical temperature for the higher dimensional ising models by simulating the multirange ising model on z 2 raising the possibility of a computationally efficient

time required to obtain it we have simplified obtaining uncertainties to explain the methodology we will separate the cases analyzed into two groups group i consists of cases m 2 and m 19 for n 1 and m 2 and m 6 for n 2 group ii contains the remaining cases we describe the steps used to estimate the uncertainty of each parameter in the following 1 uncertainty in kc m l group i for each n m and l in this group we obtain five independent samples of the functions and u for q values of the inverse temperature in the vicinity of kc m l q 10 let k i c m l be the value of k that maximizes for a given m and l in the i th sample k i c m l is determined by fitting a cubic spline to the simulation data q points and locating the maximum of this polynomial we estimate the uncertainty in kc m l as the standard deviation of the mean the estimates for kc u m l and the uncertainties obtained by maximizing the deriva tive of u are derived in a similar manner the derivative is determined fitting u using a five parameter logistic function u a 1 a 2 a 1 1 a 3 k a 4 a 5 to the data for u in the vicinity of 7 kc m l again using q points we then calculate the derivative of the logistic function to estimate du dk u 2 uncertainty in kc m group i we estimate the critical exponent using the relation 2 and using the relation 3 perform a three parameter fit to determine the central value kc m and a fitting uncertainty f we calculated li the uncertainty in kc m induced by kc m li as the difference in the value obtained through the fit of points using kc m li kc m li and kc m with all other kc m li s taking their central values the symbol denotes or u the final uncertainty estimate in kc m is kc m f 2 s i 1 2 li 6 where s denotes the number of l s analyzed 3 uncertainty in kc m group ii we did not estimate uncertainties for kc m l in this group as these data were ob tained in single runs to estimate the uncertainty in kc m we perform a linear interpolation using the uncertainties obtained for group i table 3 we assume that kc m grows with m due to finite size effects the uncertainties determined for group i support this assumption table 3 uncertainty estimates for group i n m
