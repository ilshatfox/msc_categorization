lattices in the continuum limit master equations lead to fokker planck partial differential equations that represent the dynamics of physical systems in continuous spaces over the last few decades nonlinear fokker planck equations have become very popular in condensed matter physics and in statistical physics numerical solutions of these equations require the use of discretization schemes however the discrete evolution equation obtained by the discretization of a fokker planck partial differential equation depends on the specific discretization scheme in general the discretized form is different from the master equation that has generated the respective fokker planck equation in the continuum limit therefore the knowledge of the master equation associated with a given fokker planck equation is extremely important for the correct numerical integration of the latter since it provides a unique physically motivated discretization scheme this paper shows that the kinetic interaction principle kip that governs the particle kinetics of many body systems introduced in g kaniadakis physica a 296 405 2001 univocally defines a very simple master equation that in the continuum limit

mailto giorgio kaniadakis polito it mailto dionisi mred tuc gr i introduction nonlinear kinetics in the coordinate or velocity space or in the phase space has been used systematically over the last few decades a popular approach involves studying the temporal evolution of a particle system while it interacts with a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium in ref 1 the most general nonlinear kinetics in phase space was considered in the limit of the diffusive approximation in this limit the interaction between the particles and the medium is viewed as a diffusive process in the velocity space it was shown that the particle probability density function f f t r v henceforward particle density function obeys the following evolution equation f t 1 m u v f r 1 m v r f v v da f b f v v u ln a f b f 1 where d d r v is the diffusion coefficient while v v r and u u v represent the external potential and the particle kinetic energy respectively in addition f r f v denote the gradients of the particle density with respect to velocity and space and m is the particle mass the constant is given by 1 kbt where kb is the boltzmann constant and t the temperature of the system the above equation can be viewed as a generalized kramers equation that describes a nonlinear kinetics in the phase space the nonlinearity is due to the presence of the two arbitrary functions a f and b f that depend on the particle density function f in the case where a f f and b f 1 eq 1 reduces to the ordinary kramers equation that describes the standard linear kinetics e g 2 eq 1 has been employed to study the kinetic foundations of nonlinear statistical systems governed by entropy generalized statistical mechanics based on entropy 1 3 4 preserves the main features of ordinary boltzmann gibbs statistical mechanics for this reason it has attracted the interest of many researchers over the last 16 years who have studied its foundations and mathematical aspects 5 12 the underlying thermodynamics 13 17 and specific applications of the theory in various scientific and engineering fields a non exhaustive list of application areas includes quantum statistics 18 20 quantum entanglement 21 22 plasma physics 23 27 nuclear fission 28 astrophysics 29 35 geomechanics 36 genomics 37 complex networks 38 39 economy 40 43 and finance 44 47 2 it is important to note that the right hand side of eq 1 which introduces nonlinear effects into kinetics describes an unconventional diffusion process in the velocity space this process can clearly also be studied in the coordinate space where it describes an anomalous diffusion process such processes have long been observed and studied in various fields of condensed and soft matter physics 48 knowledge of the master equation that is associated with a given fokker planck partial differential equation is crucial for two reasons first as stated above the master equation provides a uniquely defined discretization scheme for numerical integration second the master equation is physically meaningful since it defines the process dynamics on lattices hence the study of the lattice dynamics allows an improved understanding of the dynamics in continuous space for example consider the fokker planck equation in the form 1 that involves two arbi trary functions a f and b f numerical integration of this equation requires discretization in the spatial variable the resulting master equation cannot contain any other functions besides a f and b f that are already present in the original partial differential equa tion hence any lattice finite size dynamical effects that are lost in the continuum limit cannot be re introduced at this level in addition the master equation derived from the discretization of the fokker planck equation depends on the particular differencing scheme e g forward differences versus central differences to avoid these shortcomings it is worth investigating the use of physical principles at the lattice scale in order to univocally define the discrete kinetics and directly derive the master equation the master equation thus obtained is clearly useful not only for deriving the nonlinear fokker planck equation 1 in the continuum limit but also as the starting point for the direct numerical integration of the fokker planck equation the present paper shows that the kinetic interaction principle kip which governs the particle kinetics 1 univocally defines a very simple lattice based master equation which yields the nonlinear fokker planck equation in the continuous limit both the master equa tion and the ensuing fokker planck equation involve physically motivated terms the paper is organized as follows in sect 2 we introduce the specific form of the fokker planck equation that we will investigate we then recall the kip that underlies the kinetics of a particle system and we apply it to derive the most general nonlinear master equation in the nearest neighbour approximation furthermore we express the master equation in the 3 form of a discrete continuity equation and introduce the nonlinear particle current in sect 3 we calculate the particle current in the continuous limit and derive the respective fokker planck equation 2 in sect 4 we focus on standard finite difference based discretization schemes of the fokker planck equation and we show that in the nonlinear case the kip based master equation cannot be derived from such discretization schemes in sect 5 we focus on an important subclass of nonlinear kinetics described by eq 2 which is related to ordinary fickian diffusion finally in sect 6 we present our concluding remarks and suggest future extensions of this research to lattices in higher dimensions ii kinetic interaction principle and master equation a nonlinear fokker planck kinetics in one dimension in the following we focus on the one dimensional nonlinear diffusive process that is described by the equation f t x da f b f x u ln a f b f 2 where f f t x u u x and d d x while x can indicate either the velocity or the coordinate space variable eq 2 represents a general form of the nonlinear fokker planck equation upon setting f a f b f f a f b f d df ln a f b f and a d x u x x this equation can also be expressed in the equivalent but more familiar form f t x a f d f f x 3 where the first summand inside the bracket on the right hand side yields the drift term while the second summand yields the diffusive term it is in general difficult or even impossible to explicitly solve fokker planck equations that are nonlinear with respect to the probability density function or even linear ones for general forms of the external potential function u x in the linear case it is possible to obtain explicit approximations for certain temporal characteristics of the fokker planck equation such as the escape time from a metastable potential function by means of the kramers approximation or estimates of mean first passage times 49 several special cases of the nonlinear fokker planck equation 3 have long been known the best known and most frequently studied case in the literature is that of diffusion in 4 porous media which corresponds to a 0 d constant and f fn 50 eq 3 expressed in velocity space has also been used in statistical physics by setting a v d constant and f f when f 1 f eq 3 describes the kinetics of bosons positive sign or fermions negative sign 51 whereas when f fn it describes particle kinetics in non extensive statistical mechanics 52 in the case of bosonic and fermionic statistics eq 3 was obtained with standard methods used in linear kinetics i e by applying the kramers moyal expansion to a balance equation or alternatively starting from a master equation 51 the same techniques were also used in 53 54 to derive eq 3 starting from a master equation in the special case where the function f is the sum of an arbitrary number of powers of the function f i e f i cif i the most general form of eq 3 involves arbitrary functions f and f the study of this general form is important for classifying the stationary and thermodynamically stable solutions 1 56 58 on the other hand the derivation of the nonlinear fokker planck equation from physical principles is crucial for understanding the nature of the f and f functions that determine the solutions the nonlinear fokker planck equation in the most general possible from 2 has been obtained by applying the kramers moyal expansion that takes into account only transitions between near neighbors to a balance equation based on the kip 1 subsequently eq 3 was obtained in 55 from a master equation that involves nearest neighbor transitions the rates of which are determined by two arbitrary functions a f and y f f the first function a f depends on the particle density function f and is related to the f function through the simple relation f fa f on the other hand y f f depends on two distinct particle density functions f and f and is related to the f function by means of a more complicated expression b the master equation let us consider the particle kinetics in a one dimensional lattice gas comprising n iden tical particles under the hypothesis that only transitions involving the nearest neighbour lattice sites are allowed during the evolution of the particle system the probability density function fi f t xi obeys the following master equation 5 dfi dt t xi 1 xi t xi xi 1 t xi 1 xi t xi xi 1 4 where t xi xj is the transition probability from site i to site j the transition probability related to the hopping of a particle from site i to site j depends on the nature of the interaction between the lattice and the particle and this dependence is taken into account through the transition rates wij the transition probability can of course depend on the particle density of the starting i and arrival j sites in ref 1 it was postulated that the fi and fj populations of the starting and arrival sites affect the transition probability through the two arbitrary functions a fi and b fj so that t xi xj assumes the following factorized form t xi xj wij a fi b fj 5 and this particular dependence on the particle population of the starting and arrival sites defines the kinetic interaction principle c the kinetic interaction principle let us now consider the transition probability from site i to site j the a fi function must satisfy the obvious condition a 0 0 because in the case where the starting site is empty no particles can transit toward the arrival site on the other hand the b fj function must satisfy the condition b 0 1 because in the case where the arrival site is empty the transition probability cannot be influenced by the arrival site in linear kinetics a fi fi and b fj 1 is usually posed 61 in nonlinear kinetics the b fj function plays an important role because it can stimulate or inhibit the particle transition to site j and can simulate collective interactions in many body physics for instance the expression b fj 1 fj can account for the pauli exclusion principle that governs a fermionic particle system 51 59 60 analogously the expression b fj 1 fj accounts for bosonic systems other more complicated expressions of the b fj factor can take into account collective interactions introduced by the haldane generalized exclusion principle originating from the fractal structure of the single particle hilbert space 6 another case of nonlinear kinetics corresponding to a fi fi e ufi where u 0 and b fj 1 was investigated in 62 motivated by observations of two different grain growth regimes in sintering studies 63 in this type of master equation the value of u controls the equilibrium state a normal diffusive regime is obtained for u below a threshold while an abnormal diffusion regime that exhibits the matthew effect of accumulated advantage is obtained at higher u if transitions are allowed only among the nearest lattice neighbors i e i j i 1 the transition rates wij are non zero only for nearest neighbor transitions the nearest neighbor transition rates are w i where w i corresponds to the transition i i 1 and w i corresponds to the transition i i 1 the kip assumes the following form t xi xi 1 w i a fi b fi 1 6 while the master equation 4 becomes dfi dt w i 1 a fi 1 b fi w i a fi b fi 1 w i 1 a fi 1 b fi w i a fi b fi 1 7 d incoming and outgoing lattice currents let us express the master equation 7 in the form fi t j i j i x 0 8 where the outgoing j i and incoming j i currents are defined as follows j i x w i a fi b fi 1 w i 1 a fi 1 b fi 9 j i x w i 1 a fi 1 b fi w i a fi b fi 1 10 taking into account the continuity relation between the incoming current at the node i and the outgoing current at node i 1 that is j i j i 1 11 7 the difference j i j i between the outgoing and the incoming currents can be expressed ex clusively in terms of the outgoing current or alternatively in terms of the incoming current according to j i j i j i 12 where the forward difference gi and the backward difference gi of the discrete function gi are defined through gi gi 1 gi 13 a gi gi gi 1 13 b e continuity form of the master equation based on the definition of the incoming and outgoing currents given above the master equation 8 assumes the following compact form fi t j i x 0 14 the two forms of the master equation as given by eq 14 are asymmetric with respect to the currents by employing the symmetry j i j i the master equation can be expressed in a symmetric form that involves both the outgoing j i and incoming j i currents as well as both the forward and backward differences i e fi t 1 2 j i x j i x 0 15 in order to write the latter equation in an even more symmetric form we introduce the discrete fokker planck current ji according to the average ji j i j i 2 16 when this definition is employed the incoming j i and the outgoing j i currents can be expressed in terms of the ji current j i ji x 2 j i j i x 17 and after taking into account the master equation 8 we obtain j i ji x 2 fi t 18 8 finally the following first and second order symmetric finite difference operators are intro duced x 1 2 x x 19 2 x 2 1 x x x 20 and after taking into account eq 18 the master equation 15 assumes the form fi t ji x x 2 1 4 t 2 fi x 2 0 21 the latter expression of the master equation is particulary suitable for obtaining the continuous limit as x 0 first we introduce the particle distribution function f t x according to f t x lim x 0 fi 22 and the fokker planck current j t x through j t x lim x 0 ji 23 subsequently after taking into accounts the limits x x x x x x 2 x 2 2 x 2 both eq 15 and eq 21 reduce to the continuity equation f t x t j t x x 0 24 the above continuity equation is the nonlinear fokker planck equation obtained in the continuous limit starting from the master equation 7 in order to write the nonlinear fokker planck equation explicitly as last step we have to calculate the fokker planck current j t x starting from its definition 16 and this will be the task of the next section iii the nonlinear fokker planck current a lattice expression of the fokker planck current in order to calculate the continuous limit of the discrete fokker planck current defined in eq 23 we express ji defined through eqs 9 10 and 16 in terms of the functions 9 a and b thus obtaining ji x 2 w i a fi b fi 1 w i 1 a fi 1 b fi w i a fi b fi 1 w i 1 a fi 1 b fi 25 in order to express the current ji in a form that can be more efficiently used to compute the continuous limit we first note that the transition rates w i 1 can be expanded in terms of the nearest neighbour rates w i as follows w i 1 w i w i x x 26 furthermore we assume that the functions a and b are differentiable functions of fi then the a fi 1 function can be approximated using the nearest neighbour approximation of fi 1 in terms of fi and the leading order taylor expansion of a fi 1 around fi which lead to a fi 1 a fi fi 1 fi x x a fi fi x x a fi d a fi d fi fi x x 27 following the same procedure one obtains the approximate expressions for the functions a b at the nearest neighbour sites of a given site i a fi 1 a fi d a fi d fi fi x x 28 b fi 1 b fi d b fi d fi fi x x 29 after substitution of the above expressions for a fi 1 and b fi 1 in the equation eq 25 of the discrete fokker planck current ji one obtains ji w i w i x w i w i x x 2 2 a fi b fi a fi d b fi d fi w i fi x w i fi x x 2 2 b fi d a fi d fi w i fi x w i fi x x 2 2 30 10 b continuum limit expression of the fokker planck current the above expression for the discrete current can be simplified in the continuum limit x 0 by taking into account that there is no difference between the first order forward backward and symmetric finite differences i e gi x gi x 31 hence the discrete fokker planck current ji assumes the form ji w i w i x w i w i x x 2 2 a fi b fi w i w i x 2 2 a fi d b fi d fi b fi d a fi d fi fi x 32 the diffusion coefficient defined by means of di w i w i 2 x 2 33 and the drift coefficient defined by means of ji w i w i x 34 are usually introduced into fokker plank kinetics following these replacements the discrete fokker planck current given by eq 32 assumes the equivalent form ji ji di x a fi b fi di b fi d a fi d fi a fi d b fi d fi fi x 35 furthermore the introduction of the kinetic energy function ui according to ui x 1 di ji di x 36 allows expressing the current in the following form ji di a fi b fi ui x d d fi ln a fi b fi fi x 37 11 or equivalently as ji di a fi b fi x ui ln a fi b fi 38 the discrete current ji as given by the latter equation is expressed in a form that permits straightforward evaluation of the x 0 continuous limit thus the nonlinear fokker planck current in the continuum limit is given by the following equation j t x d t x a f t x b f t x x u t x ln a f t x b f t x 39 iv fokker planck equation and discretization schemes if we insert the continuum limit of the fokker planck j t x current given by eq 39 in the continuity equation 24 we obtain the nonlinear fokker planck equation f t x da f b f x u ln a f b f 40 the above equation recovers the original fokker planck equation given by equations 2 and 3 thus the derivations in the preceding section show how the nonlinear fokker planck equation can be obtained from the discrete fokker planck current of eq 23 which is derived from the simple kip based master equation 7 in the following we investigate the impact of the discretization of the time derivative in fokker planck equation as well as the impact of the space derivative discretization in the linear and nonlinear kinetic regimes we also present an extension of the one dimensional formalism to two spatial dimensions we will express the fokker planck equation 40 as f t x t f t x 41 a f t x g t x x 41 b g t x da f b f x u ln a f b f 41 c 12 there are various numerical schemes for the discretization of partial differential equations such as the above including finite difference schemes methods based on finite elements finite volume methods spectral approaches multigrid methods etc 64 each approach leads to a different set of equations that depends on the mathematical assumptions made different discretization schemes for the one dimensional fokker planck equation are pre sented in 65 it is most straightforward to compare the master equation 7 with discretized fokker planck equations that are obtained by means of finite difference methods discretized ver sions of the functions f t x are denoted by means of fni where the index i refers to the lattice site and the index n to the time instant a temporal discretization three of the most common finite difference methods lead to the following discretization schemes of 41 a fn 1 i fni t f ni forward euler 42 a fn 1 i fni t f n 1 i backward euler 42 b fn 1 i fni t 1 2 f ni f n 1 i cranknicolson 42 c where t is the time step on the other hand the discretization of the master equation 7 leads to fn 1 i fni t f ni 43 f ni w n i 1 a f n i 1 b f n i w ni a fni b fni 1 w ni 1 a fni 1 b fni w ni a fni b fni 1 44 if we compare the master equation 43 with 42 we notice that the right hand side of the former involves the function f ni only at the current time step in contrast the backward euler and the crank nicolson schemes involve the values of the function f n 1 i at the next time step as well 13 in the forward euler discretization the time difference is determined by the function f ni which is in general different from f n i the function f n i is obtained by discretizing the spatial partial derivatives in f t x using the forward spatial derivative defined in 13 the function f ni can be shown to depend on the values of a b u at the sites labeled by i i 1 i 2 in contrast the time difference of the discretized master equation 43 depends on the lattices sites i and i 1 b linear kinetics regime the linear kinetics regime of 2 is obtained if a f f and b f 1 after recalling that f a f b f f a f b f f ln a f b f it follows that f f and f 1 hence the linear fokker planck equation derived from 2 assumes the form f t da x dx f a x dd x dx f x d x 2 f x 2 45 with a d x u x x in order to discretize the above equation in space we introduce at the place of the first and second order partial derivatives the following symmetric finite differences f x fi 1 fi 1 2 x 46 a 2 f x 2 fi 1 2 fi fi 1 x 2 46 b where x is the uniform discretization step in space then the linear fokker planck equation 45 transforms into the linear master equation dfi dt w i 1 fi 1 w i 1 fi 1 wi fi 47 a with the nearest neighbor transition rates w i 1 and w i 1 defined by w i 1 di x 2 di 1 di 1 4 x 2 ai 2 x 47 b wi 2 di x 2 ai 1 ai 1 2 x 47 c 14 similarly the nearest neighbor master equation 7 is given in the linear regime by the following equation dfi dt w i 1 fi 1 w i 1 fi 1 w i w i fi 48 after observing that wi w i w i the linear master equation 48 derived by means of the kip is essentially equivalent to the master equation 47 a obtained from the discretiza tion of the linear fokker planck equation 45 we can thus conclude that in the case of linear kinetics the kip based master equation leads in the continuum limit to a fokker planck equation discretization of the fokker planck equation using the centered difference scheme yields the original master equation in the case of linear kinetics we can use either the forward or the backward euler method or the cranck nicolson method since the coefficients of the fokker planck equation do not depend on time in addition the linear dependence on the probability density function ensures that even for the more demanding crank nicolson scheme it suffices to solve a linear system c nonlinear kinetics in the case of nonlinear kinetics we consider the fokker planck equation as given in 3 expansion of the terms that involve the spatial derivatives lead to the following expression f t da x dx f a x d f df dd x dx f f x d x d f df f x 2 d x f 2 f x 2 49 using the centered finite difference approximation of the spatial derivatives for the functions f t x d x and a x we obtain the following master equation dfi dt fi fi 1 i fi fi 1 2 fi fi 1 i fi fi 1 2 fi fi 2 i fi fi 1 fi 1 50 a where the density dependent coefficients fi fi and i fi are given by 15 fi di x 2 fi di 1 di 1 4 x 2 fi ai 2 x d fi dfi 50 b fi 2 di x 2 fi ai 1 ai 1 2 x fi fi 50 c i fi di 4 x 2 d fi dfi 50 d the master equation 7 that is based on the kip with nearest neighbor transitions repre sents different kinetics than the master equation 50 that is obtained from the discretization of the nonlinear fokker planck equation 3 the kinetics described by the kip based mas ter equation is physically motivated at the microscopic level on the other hand it is not straightforward to interpret in physical terms the kinetics described by 50 more precisely the first two terms on the right hand side of 50 a can be viewed as representing transitions into the site i from the site i 1 the population of the departure site enters linearly the transition rate in the first term but the population of the arrival site i can be a highly nonlinear and complicated function in the second term the dependence on the departure site is also nonlinear in addition to that of the arrival site analogous remarks hold for the third and fourth terms which represent transitions from the site i 1 towards the site i the last two terms represent exiting transitions from the sites i however there is no obvious physical mechanism that explains why the transition rate for particles exiting the site i should be proportional to the product of the densities at both sites i 1 and i 1 as dictated by the term i fi fi 1 fi 1 clearly the master equation 50 does not have an ob vious microscopic interpretation even though in the continuum limit it yields the nonlinear fokker planck equation 3 based on the above observations in order to integrate numerically the nonlinear fokker planck equation it is recommended to start with the spatial discretization provided by the master equation 7 for the time step the forward or backward euler methods are simpler alternatives than the crank nicolson method which leads to a nonlinear system of algebraic equations with respective computational cost more importantly in order to study the statistical properties of a physical system governed by lattice nonlinear kinetics the master equation 7 is clearly the starting point independently of the method used to integrate it which is not the focus of the current study how should we understand the difference between the master equation 7 and that 16 produced by the discretization of the nonlinear fokker planck equation 3 which after all is obtained from the initial master equation 7 in the continuum limit the key is that in process of taking the continuum limit information is lost the master equation 7 contains the density functions fi fi 1 fi 1 of three sites i i 1 through the set of functions im a fi b fi a fi 1 b fi 1 a fi 1 b fi 1 the nonlinear fokker planck equation 3 on the other hand contains the function f x through its dependence on a f b f and the partial derivatives f x 2 f x 2 clearly the set im that is used in the master equation 7 contains more information than the set ifp a f b f f x and 2 f x 2 due to this loss of information in the transition from the discrete lattice based to the continuum model discretization of the latter generates the master equation 50 which is radically different from the master equation 7 although both master equations yield the same fokker planck equation in the continuum limit it is important to stress that more than one master equations including 7 imposed by the kip yield the same fokker planck equation in the continuum limit in contrast applying the standard discretization rules to the fokker planck equation the master equations derived are not physically motivated and they differ from the master equation generated by the kip only in the case of the linear fokker planck equation the master equation obtained by discretization coincides with the kip based master equation v drift current and diffusion in nonlinear kinetics a nonlinear drift and fick currents let us now write the fokker plank equation 40 in the following form f t jdrift jfick x 0 51 where the nonlinear drift current jdrift jdrift t x and the nonlinear fick current jfick jfick t x are defined according to jdrift d u x a f b f 52 17 jfick d f f x 53 with f a f b f d df ln a f b f 54 the term d f represents the nonlinear diffusion coefficient if f 1 then the ordinary fick current jfick d f x is obtained the ordinary fick current appears in i linear kinetics for a f f and b f 1 and ii in the classical models of boson or fermion kinetics for a f f and b f 1 f respectively this important result pertaining to the ordinary diffusion that underlies the kinetics of classical bosons and fermions naturally leads to the question whether there exist other nonlinear kinetics which are governed by standard fickian diffusion b nonlinear kinetics with fickian diffusion in the following we focus on the fokker planck equation 40 in the case of fickian diffusion i e if the f function defined in eq 54 is subject to the f 1 condition in nonlinear kinetics the generalized logarithm f is introduced through f ln a f b f 55 in terms of the generalized logarithm the stationary and stable solution fs of eq 40 assumes the form fs u x 56 where is an arbitrary constant it is easy to express the a f and b f functions in terms of the f function first we write eq 55 in the form a f b f exp f 57 18 then based on eq 54 and taking into account the f 1 condition we obtain a f b f 1 d f df 58 finally the solutions of the two equations above for a f and b f lead to a f d f df 1 2 exp 1 2 f 59 b f d f df 1 2 exp 1 2 f 60 the nonlinear fokker planck kinetics described by eq 40 when a f and b f are given by eq 59 and 60 simplifies to f t x d u x f d f x 61 where the function f represents the inverse of the derivative of the generalized logarithm given by 1 f d f df 62 the eq 61 describes a process that undergoes standard fickian diffusion dominated by a nonlinear drift the latter imposes the non standard form given by eq 56 to the stationary distribution function c the case of kappa kinetics as a working example let us briefly consider the kinetics 1 where the generalized logarithm is given by f ln f 63 ln f being the logarithm defined by means of the equation 19 ln f f f 2 64 the inverse of the logarithm function i e the exponential is given by exp x 1 2 x 2 x 1 65 in this case the a f and b f functions assume the expressions a f 2 f f f exp f f 4 66 b f 2 f f f exp f f 4 67 while the respective fokker planck equation becomes f t x d u x 2 f f f d f x 68 it is remarkable that the latter equation is different from the one proposed in 1 both equations are correct and describe two different nonlinear kinetics that admit the same stationary solution fs exp u 69 the main difference between the two kinetics is that the present fokker planck equation describes a process which undergoes ordinary fickian diffusion second term on the right hand side of 68 in the presence of nonlinear drift first term on the right hand side of 68 while the fokker planck equation of ref 1 describes a process that undergoes non fickian diffusion in the presence of linear drift 20 vi conclusions let us summarize the main results of the present study starting from the kinetic inter action principle introduced in 1 we obtained the evolution equation of a general statistical system defined on a one dimensional lattice the kip based master equation in the contin uum limit yielded the already known nonlinear fokker planck equation 2 which is widely used in the literature to describe anomalous diffusion in condensed matter physics and non conventional statistical physics our derivation provides a better physical understanding of the underlying many body lattice dynamics at the microscopic level a second result is related to the possibility of directly using the kip based master equa tion as the numerical discretization scheme for the solution of the fokker planck partial differential equation 2 this approach resolves the ambiguity that results from different numerical discretization schemes of the fokker planck equation the proposed discretization scheme based on the master equation is physically motivated and follows from the kip that describes microscopic nonlinear dynamics on the contrary discretization schemes based on finite differences follow from mathematically considerations in addition the master equa tions obtained from the nonlinear fokker planck equation by applying different discretization schemes cannot be obtained starting from the kip the master equation proposed in this paper and obtained by means of the kip is thus uniquely defined by microscopic interactions finally after noting that the fokker planck current expresses the sum of two distinct contributions i e the nonlinear drift current and the generalized fick current as shown in eqs 51 53 we have demonstrated that some important nonlinear kinetics formulations proposed in the literature can be successfully described by ordinary fickian diffusion this can be accomplished by introducing a nonlinear drift term that is combined with fickian diffusion this combination leads to the same stationary solution of the fokker planck equation as an equation that involves non fickian diffusion and linear drift it is straightforward to extend the kip based approach for the derivation of physically inspired master equations to lattices in two and three dimensions for example in the case of a two dimensional square lattice whose sites are labeled by the integer indices i j the master equation 7 with nearest neighbor transitions becomes 21 dfi j dt w
