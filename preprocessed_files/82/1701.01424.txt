of the universe wpi the university of tokyo kashiwa chiba 277 8583 japan dated october 1 2018 we present a study of diffusion enhancement of underdamped brownian particles in 1 d symmetric space periodic potential due to external symmetric time periodic forcing with zero mean we show that the diffusivity can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude at appropriate choice of the forcing amplitude and frequency the diffusivity demonstrates tad abnormal decreasing temperature dependence at forcing amplitudes exceeding certain value at any fixed forcing frequency normal temperature dependence of the diffusivity is restored at low enough temperatures t ttad in contrast with the problem with constant external forcing at fixed temperature at small forcing frequency the diffusivity either slowly decreases with or at stronger forcing goes through a maximum near 2 reciprocal superdiffusion stage duration at high frequencies between 2 and a fraction of the oscillation frequency at the potential minimum the diffusivity is shown to decrease with according to a power law with exponent related to the transient superdiffusion exponent this behavior is found similar for the cases of sinusoidal in time and piecewise constant periodic square forcing pacs numbers 05 40 a 02 50 ey 68 43 jk 66 30 j i introduction the phenomena of diffusion and transport over a po tential energy landscape play a key role in a number of processes in physics chemistry and biology 1 5 joseph son tunneling junctions superionic conductors phase locked loop frequency control systems charge density waves are a few examples of systems in which these pro cesses in periodic potential are important 6 in recent years the interest has been growing to ex perimental studies of manipulating the particle diffusion by external fields one can effectively control the dif fusion processes by varying the field parameters for instance huge enhancement in diffusivity exceeding its value in the same system without extra forcing by a fac tor of order hundreds was observed in studying particle diffusion in colloids with optical traps optical vortices 7 large increase in diffusivity was also observed in studies of paramagnetic particle diffusion on surfaces of garnet ferrites influenced by external time periodic mag netic field 8 in the same manner diffusivity growth with shaking strength was noticed in experiments with gran azhiglo uchicago edu ular gas 9 it turned possible to increase the diffusivity of ions in membrane channels by varying the external electromagnetic field 10 one can increase the rates of diffusion limited physical processes and effectively sepa rate micro and nano particles of different nature by vary ing diffusion coefficients in different directions 11 despite these remarkable achievements quantitative description of such enhanced diffusion under the influence of external forces remains fragmentary to date a diffusion of brownian particles in spatially periodic potentials under constant external forcing special cases of underdamped and overdamped physi cal systems are often considered in overdamped systems inertial effects may be neglected significantly simplifying the mathematical treatment of the problem in under damped systems on the other hand the viscous decay of oscillations occurs on times long compared with the os cillation period in the potential such systems are harder to investigate and the progress in studying these is more limited compared with overdamped ones first detailed studies of a brownian particle motion in a washboard potential i e a periodic potential tilted http arxiv org abs 1701 01424 v 2 mailto azhiglo uchicago edu 2 with an additional constant force field were carried out by h risken and colleagues 12 13 for all values of the friction it was shown that at low friction the appearance of locked in which the particle oscillates around one minimum of the potential and running where the par ticle travels through many potential periods not getting trapped at separate minima solutions was important for the particle ensemble behavior at small temperatures running solutions appear abruptly at the external force value exceeding certain critical fcr at smaller forces a single class of solutions locked is realized systemati zation of the results of these studies may be found in authoritative monograph 6 approximate solution of the fokker planck equation fpe for the coordinate and velocity distribution func tion was the central moment of these studies two differ ent approaches were used that were checked to produce compatible results in the first of these 12 by expanding the distribution function in hermite functions in velocity and fourier series in space coordinate the fokker planck equation was transformed into an infinite set of coupled equa tions for the expansion coefficients these equations were solved by a matrix continued fraction method parti cle flux was then expressed through the expansion coef ficients after appropriate series truncation at smaller friction progressively more terms must be kept making this method less efficient another approach 13 is best suited for low friction when the energy becomes a slow variable changing on friction dissipation timescales the distribution func tion was rewritten in the energy and configuration space coordinate variables fpe was solved in these new vari ables with the help of physically motivated self consistent ansatz many illuminating results were obtained for the dis tribution functions at various parameter values stability domains of locked and running solutions plots of the mean particle velocity etc diffusion properties however remained not studied this matter was partly addressed in other works based on simulations of the stochastic langevin equation early systematic study of diffusion by means of nu merical simulation of the langevin equation in periodic potential with extra constant forcing was undertaken in 14 similar simulations were reported in 15 for forcing with a time periodic component costantini march esoni analyzed both overdamped and underdamped set tings at low dissipation they observed significant en hancement of the spatial diffusion near the critical force fcr 14 fig 1 diffusivity ten times larger than its post maximum value at f 2 fcr at the temperature equal to 0 6 of the potential well depth u 0 and related that to features of the particle jump statistics and locked to running transition further progress in studies of the diffusion under the action of constant force was made in 16 18 time dependence of the particle ensemble dispersion was stud ied in 16 it was shown for the first time that in under damped systems a special regime of dispersionless trans port was realized in which dispersion virtually does not change with time on certain limited interval of time the authors explained this phenomenon they showed that strongly non equilibrium distribution of particles in space with steep front and exponential tail formed as the particles first exit their original potential well per sists for long times before eventually broadening and assuming normal gaussian shape the temperature dependence of the diffusivity was studied as well 18 the authors observed that the max imal diffusivity dmax was achieved near the fcr at low friction dmax was shown to depend abnormally on the temperature increase with decreasing temperature t fitting for the three temperatures studied yielded dmax t 3 5 relation the presence of such abnormal temperature depen dence is one important aspect in which underdamped systems differ from overdamped ones in fact certain pe culiarities in diffusivity at low temperatures are observed for driven brownian particles in space periodic poten tials in overdamped situation as well p reimann and colleagues 19 showed analytically that for a sinusoidal in space potential at external constant force value near f 0 the value required for direct particle pull over the potential barrier eq 4 below p 4 the ratio of dmax to the diffusivity value d 0 in the viscous medium without lattice and bias forces grows at temperature decreasing t 2 3 yet the diffusivity itself still vanishes at t 0 as dmax t 1 3 19 and grows monotonically for all t regions with d t 0 were obtained in over damped problem in 20 cf fig 6 for specially crafted exotic potential flat apart from narrow peaks the au thors linked this abnormal diffusivity behavior to the large ratio of relaxation to escape time in such a sys tem similar abnormal d t behavior was found in 21 cf fig 2 4 for piecewise linear potential at extreme asymmetry essentially sawtooth so while possible at large friction special atypical conditions must be met for existence of parameters f t at which d t 0 on the contrary such parameters exist universally in the problem with small friction 22 more below another distinction of the diffusivity in overdamped problem is that the maximum in d f is achieved close to the f 0 whereas at low friction dmax f is achieved at typically much smaller fcr experimental data for diffusion of colloidal particles in a tilted potential created with laser traps 23 fig 1 agreed reasonably well with this analytic 19 d f dependence the potential bar rier height and the free diffusion coefficient were treated as fit parameters similarly diffusivity in 24 fig 7 showed peaked at f 0 behavior and agreed fairly well with analytic predictions from 19 with the potential form in ferred from independent study of the colloidal particle spatial distribution function in this work colloidal par ticles diffused over the potential created by the bottom grid of colloidal spheres and extra constant forcing was 3 due to gravity controlled by the sample inclination an gle different limiting cases of analytic predictions 19 for the mean particle velocity and diffusivity were com pared with experimental results at different settings and showed good agreement the physical reason behind the abnormal tempera ture dependence of diffusivity in underdamped systems is traced to increasing jump length of running parti cles before getting retrapped at another potential min imum with the temperature decrease 22 this phe nomenon being absent in overdamped systems as these have no proper running states the maximal diffusivity is achieved at forcing near fcr as at this value popu lations of locked and running particles are about equal and it is the mutual motion between these two popu lations with temperature independent running particle speed that leads to fast spreading of the particle packet manifested as giant diffusion 18 more thorough analysis of the temperature and force dependence of the diffusion in underdamped systems was carried out in 25 it was shown by numeric sim ulations of the langevin equation that the phenomenon of diffusivity growth with the temperature decreasing in the current work called tad temperature abnormal diffusivity was only manifested in a narrow interval of applied external forcing study in a wide range of tem peratures demonstrated that the diffusivity grew with de creasing temperature as dmax t 2 3 exp e kbt for certain e 0 checked valid for kbt u 0 0 05 0 85 whereas the power law fit dmax t 3 5 proposed in 18 could approximate the results only in the narrow temper ature range studied by the authors we showed that the main exponential growth resulted from such of the cor relation time at the temperature decreasing found from the simulation results the diffusion properties were further elucidated and systematized for a broad range of the forces f friction coefficients and temperatures t in 22 in sinusoidal 1 d potential in underdamped setting we introduced a velocity potential w v which in part governed time evolution of certain slow not changing much on times of order one period t 0 of small oscillations in the potential rather evolving on viscous dissipation timescales veloc ity variable defined through a discrete quantity maximal velocity in such consecutive oscillations with certain reservations that w v also defined the velocity distri bution function n v agreeing well with the one found numerically the latter showed clear bimodal structure with maxima at v 0 locked states and v f running ones at intermediate forcing values in this region of forcing values tad was observed analytic expressions for the mean particle velocity v and diffusivity were obtained with the model n v good agreement was shown with direct langevin equa tion simulation results simple fits were proposed de termining the model parameters entering w v and n v through f and which apart from useful ness for experimentalists applications allowed one to comprehend the features of transport and diffusivity in all the physical parameter space physical reason for the dmax exp e kbt scaling was explained more de tail in the introductory part of sec iii p 5 below b periodic in time external forcing in practical applications periodic in time external forces electromagnetic acoustic etc are more straight forwardly realized than constant forcing it is natural to study how the findings for the constant forcing problem are modified for the time periodic forcing setup both from theoretical and practical point of view by chang ing the diffusivity with the aid of periodic external fields it is possible to create surface structures with prescribed properties influence the dynamics of point defects un der irradiation in part alter the dislocation motion dy namics increase chemical reaction rates in selected direc tions manipulate the efficiency of processes in biological systems to mention just a few applications 26 27 most of the works on periodic forcing deal with ratchet type systems 4 or stochastic resonance studies focusing on diffusion properties are scarce we are not aware of any works that systematically study the combined de pendence of the diffusivity on the temperature the forc ing amplitude and frequency in a representatively broad range of these parameters dependence of the diffusivity on the interplay between the external periodic piecewise constant eq 6 on p 4 below forcing and the lattice force was studied in 28 in 2 d overdamped setup the forcing frequency was fixed at one value it was shown that in a system with a sum of yukawa potentials at square grid nodes the par ticle diffusivity was significantly enhanced for certain in tricate set of bands a windows of the forcing am plitudes and orientations with respect to the grid at special forcing arrangement tad was observed for some diffusivity tensor components and one of its principal values increased exponentially with inverse temperature the other diffusivity tensor principal value decreased ex ponentially at the same time it is likely that multi dimensionality effects were crucial for tad instead of having two locked and running populations in 1 d ac counting for already sophisticated in this case diffusion features flows in higher dimensional problems are far more complex known to result in further peculiarities in transport and diffusion 5 29 underdamped 1 d system was studied in 30 with a si nusoidal potential same as eq 3 below and sinusoidal in time forcing diffusivity enhancement by orders of mag nitude was seen tad was observed for some low forc ing frequencies at the forcing amplitude 0 15 f 0 studied dependence of the diffusivity on the forcing frequency was studied in more detail in 31 and was shown to be nonmonotonic at large forcing amplitudes 0 15 f 0 and 0 25 f 0 at t 240 k kbt u 0 0 258 at 0 15 f 0 the maximum in the frequency dependence of the dif 4 fusivity d t f const persisted for all the tempera tures studied corresponding frequency max increasing from 2 10 4 to 6 10 3 in units of the po tential eigenfrequency at t varying from 120 to 360 k kbt u 0 0 129 0 388 the goal of the present work is to investigate in detail the dependence of the diffusivity on the amplitude and the frequency of uniform time periodic external forcing in a 1 d underdamped space periodic system and conditions under which tad is realized we mainly study piecewise constant periodic pcp eq 6 forcing as this case is more straightforward to relate to the results for constant forcing the equations solved and the methods used are de scribed in sec ii in sec iii we show how the diffusivity changes with the pcp forcing frequency starting from the understood results at constant forcing 0 we observe that tad is realized for some intermediate forc ing amplitudes sec iv is devoted to studying the d t behavior at fixed the results for the diffusivity in the case of sinusoidal in time forcing are shown in sec v we conclude in sec vi ii problem setup and numerical method a problem setup in this paper the 1 d dynamics of a particle subject to external forcing ft is

exter nal force needed to drag the particle over the potential barrier separating potential minima on the 1 d lattice at large friction we use the same physical parameters as in 22 typi cal for adatom diffusion on close packed metal surfaces namely values u 0 80 mev a 2 a 5 for the activation barrier and the lattice constant are adopted two possibilities for the external periodic forcing are studied piecewise constant periodic pcp driving ft t fe sign sin t 6 and sinusoidal one ft t fe sin t 7 is the angular frequency of the external force and fe is its amplitude it is convenient to use

these by the the period t 0 of small oscillations in the lattice potential at 0 overdamped problem is characterized by m 0 whereas m 0 equivalently 1 corresponds to underdamped dynamics we study the underdamped case here friction coefficient 0 2 we use corresponds to the same physical value as in earlier studies 22 25 b numerical method we solve stochastic equation 1 2 numerically using a verlet type algorithm 33 with a time step t somewhat shorter than 1 100 th of the period of oscillation t 0 the 5 statistic averaging is performed over the ensemble con sisting of at least n 5 104 particles to verify the modeling consistency some computations were performed with n 5 106 the initial conditions are set as follows each particle is placed at x 0 its velocity chosen at random with maxwellian distribution for a given t thermalization over 100 oscillation periods in the potential u x but without the ft t is then used to get equilibrium parti cle distribution over both coordinate and velocity tests show that the distribution function does not change after that time in the process of such thermalization the par ticles can jump to nearby elementary cells of the lattice such relocated particles are returned back to the initial cell by translation over an integer multiple of the lattice constant to get diffusion of all particles starting from the initial cell of the lattice the diffusivity is computed based on the dispersion 2 of the particle distribution in the limit of large times d lim t d eff t lim t x x 2 t 2 t lim t 2 2 t 10 angle brackets with no subscripts mean averaging over the ensemble d and are dimensionless in our notation the physical diffusivity is d d a 2 t 0 for each diffusivity calculation we find time t lin after which the dispersion grows linearly with time if averaged over the forcing period the d is calculated as 2 2 t at t 100 t lin it is known that in systems with low dissipation tran sient regimes of anomalous diffusion can be realized 32 characterized by 2 x x 2 t 11 the process with 1 is referred to as superdiffusion whereas subdiffusion is characterized by 1 stages of anomalous diffusion were observed in our simulations the choice of initial conditions above aided in having these stages in clear form we determine the exponents by the least square lin ear fitting between log 2 and log t on the time interval of interest iii piecewise constant periodic forcing dependence of the diffusivity on the forcing frequency in 25 it was shown that depending on the value of the external force constant in that study different func tional dependences of the diffusivity on the temperature were realized plots of the diffusivity as a function of the external force at several temperatures based on 25 recomputed for the current units are shown in fig 1 there are three regions of fe values i iii with qualitatively dif ferent dependence of the diffusivity d on t in region i diffusion is enhanced as external force fe value in creases whereas in region iii diffusion is inhibited as fe increases in regions i and iii d grows with t increas ing contrary to this normal temperature behavior in region

observed in a limited interval of the forcing frequencies studies were carried out at fe 0 15 f 0 that would cor respond to region iii for the same amplitude of constant forcing see fig 1 so tad would not be observed at such fe value were the forcing ft t constant to understand physical reasons of the abnormal tem perature dependence of the diffusivity in these two dif ferent time periodic and constant forcing regimes we consider the periodic forcing regime in more detail be low for piecewise constant periodic pcp forcing one 6 can use intuition gained in the constant forcing problem for the time intervals in which ft stays constant the find ings are thus easier to interpret most of the results in this work are for the pcp forcing setup in 22 we showed that the transport properties of an ensemble of underdamped particles in a washboard po tential can be found by considering a simpler problem of the overdamped motion in effective potential w v in velocity space the problem showed similarities with the problem of active brownian particle motion 34 whether the particle belongs to locked tending with time to v 0 one minimum of w v or running tending to v f another minimum of the asymmetric double well potential w v population in the absence of noise is determined by the particle s initial state its velocity if placed at the potential minimum at t 0 it was shown that region ii of the force values the region in which tad is observed is precisely the region where both locked and running solutions are simultaneously possible thew v was also instrumental for proposing a model distribution function n v and for defining diffusivity through kubo relation the analytic predictions for d and v based on the model n v agreed well with direct numerical simulation results for all values of f 0 5 f 0 temperatures in the range t 0 129 0 776 friction 0 1 0 4 in the definitions of dimensionless quanti ties adopted here eqs 8 9 agreement getting progres sively better at smaller in the expression for the dif fusivity the analytic prediction for the correlation time corl factor was shown to be responsible for the main fea tures ind f t dependence numerically found in earlier study 25 namely corl showed proper nonmonotonic dependence on f with a maximum near fcr progres sively more pronounced at smaller t corl increased at temperature decreasing exp e kbt for certain e 0 this increase at low t reflected the kramers rate for transitions in the double well velocity potential w v between the wells corresponding to locked and running states schematics of the effective velocity potential in the three regions of the applied force are shown in the bot tom insets in fig 1 the first inset corresponds to fe 0 06 f 0 at which only locked solutions exist in the second inset fe 0 095 f 0 corresponding to the maximal diffusivity both types of solutions coexist at this force value finally fe 0 25 f 0 corresponding to region iii is shown in the third inset at this fe only running solu tions are realized the boundaries between regions i iii depend on and m on in the dimensionless problem at smaller these boundaries move to the left to the lower force values and the width of region ii decreases in the current study we use the same fixed values of and m as in 22 and investigate the features of d t at the three values of the external forcing amplitude listed above it may be expected that the same picture for differ ent temperature behaviors of the diffusivity with analo gous three regions i iii of the external force amplitudes holds for pcp driving at least at small frequencies the description with the effective potential is applica ble the potential w v keeping constant form for each of the two half periods of the external forcing on which ft stays constant this f value defining corresponding w v f below we show that in fact the situation is more sub tle similar three regions of the external force amplitudes fe exist differing in qualitative d t dependence tad is realized in certain range of intermediate fe smoothly dependent on at decreasing temperatures the de pendence d t starts progressively deviating from such at constant forcing for any fixed at temperatures below certain critical ttad normal temperature de pendence of the diffusivity is restored we demonstrate these features by analyzing d t in sequence for the above values of fe fe f 0 0 06 0 095 0 25 that cor respond to regions i ii iii in the constant external force problem we observe transient anomalous diffusion phase and see how its characteristics relate to the diffusivity in the asymptotic late time regime when normal diffusion regime sets in the properties of this anomalous diffu sion stage are different in the three regions of the applied force amplitudes this translates into different functional dependence of the diffusivity on the temperature a region i fe f 0 0 06 varying frequency here we investigate how the diffusivity changes with dimensionless frequency t 0 of the external forc ing at forcing amplitude fe 0 06 f 0 we show that the diffusivity stays nearly constant at small frequencies up to reciprocal of the superdiffusion stage duration at frequencies above this the diffusivity drops according to a power law with exponent related to the exponent of the superdiffusion this power law dependence holds up to frequencies a few times less than the lattice poten tial eigenfrequency the diffusivity grows with the tem perature normal temperature behavior related to the superdiffusion stage duration increasing with t figure 2 shows the growth of the particle dispersion with time at constant external forcing this growth demonstrates a clear superdiffusion stage 2 t 1 that switches to normal diffusion same power law growth but with 1

averaged over the forcing period d 2 dt t const higher frequencies of the forcing correspondingly result in lower diffusivity as the stage of 2 growing with time faster than linearly ends earlier than

that would indeed lead to d increasing at 2 1 with our parameters however result ing approximations are an overstretch the diffusion gets markedly nonequilibrium at such high s resulting in the complex d behavior at approaching 2 more on this in sec iii d finally fig 4 shows 2 t for a range of temperatures at constant forcing despite the superdiffusion exponent is seen to decrease with the temperature the duration 8 of the superdiffusion stage spd 2 1 grows fast with the temperature as a result the dispersion is larger for larger temperatures at any given time at late times this

diffusion at late times is observed at time 2 at forcing frequency growing the diffusiv ity again decreases only slightly from d 0 till reaches 2 2 2 it decreases fast according to the same power law d d 0 2 1 at larger s up to 1 0 1 contrary to the case of weaker forcing considered in the previous section superdiffusion dura tion spd 2 1 now decreases with the temperature this leads to diffusivity growing at temperature decrease tad at moderately low frequencies this is the main effect we intended to find in the periodic driving setup extending our previous findings at constant forcing 22 figure 5 shows growth of the particle dispersion with time again the superdiffusion stage is observed and it ends after one period of pcp forcing or after 2 the end time of superdiffusion at constant forcing whichever is smaller thus the same approximations eq 13 15 are applicable for the averaged over dispersion growth 2 t and dependence of the diffusivity on the forcing frequency d

decreases with the tem perature when fe is in region ii such an abnormal de pendence on the temperature is due to longer jumps the 9 particles perform on average at lower temperatures this in turn follows from lower probability at lower temper atures to turn the running particle into a locked state such a transition requires certain threshold energy trans fer to such a particle and at lower temperatures the prob ability of such a transfer decreases exponentially with in verse temperature hence the running particle travels at about the stationary speed fe the speed fluctuating around this average due to the lattice potential for in creasingly longer distances before getting trapped again in some next well of the potential resulting in larger dif fusivity at smaller temperatures this mechanism is not applicable in region i where only locked solutions are realized in terms of the dispersion evolution features this phenomenon of the diffusivity growing at the tempera ture decreasing results from the superdiffusion duration spd 2 1 growing at temperature decreasing as fig 7 demonstrates this qualitatively differs from the situation at forcing amplitude in region i end of the pre

the temperature normal behav ior this results from 2 decreasing with the tempera ture as can be seen in fig 7 despite d 0 is larger at smaller temperature t 1 as grows the d t 1 starts decreasing according to the power law earlier at s near the smaller 2 2 2 t 1 than d t 2 for t 2 t 1 does and the exponent of this power law decreases with t decreasing 1 t 1 1 t 2 0 therefore at larger frequencies commensurate with 2 the diffusivity starts increasing with the temperature tad disappears as it is the case for the forcing amplitude in region i d decreases monotonically with from d 0 up to the frequency values 0 3 2 at frequencies so high the particle transport becomes substantially non equilibrium that affecting the functional dependence d as discussed in sec iii d below c region iii fe f 0 0 25 for strong forcing region iii in which the diffusivity decreases with fe in constant forcing setup and increases with the temperature we demonstrate in this subsection that the dependence of dispersion on time shows new fea tures after initial superdiffusion stage at times t 2 prolonged dispersionless stage sets in till 3 10 3 2 in this stage the dispersion stays nearly constant as at weaker external forcing regions i ii both these stages may be interrupted earlier in the case of high forcing fre quency after about a period of the forcing at late times normal diffusion takes place dependence d is non monotonic here agreeing with findings in 30 d reaches a maximum near 2 2 2 tad is observed at intermediate frequencies figure 8 shows the particle dispersion

the behavior discussed in sec iii a iii b at weaker forcing for 3 2 the dispersionless stage is interrupted after about one period of external force after which time approximately linear dependence if av eraged over times 2 sets in d 2 dt t 2 d d equal to its asymptotic at t value at yet higher forcing frequencies 2 dispersionless stage is not realized at all normal diffusion sets in right after the prematurely interrupted superdiffusion stage similarly to the previous sections described above de pendence of ln 2 on ln t can be schematized by the fol lowing continuous piecewise linear

from this showing the same power law decay as in eq 15 at 2 and ad ditional linearly growing with feature at intermediate frequencies d d 0 1 at 3 3 at 3 2 2 1 2 3 at 2 17 simulation results for d are shown in fig 9 for two temperatures they indeed show the features suggested in eq 17 at high frequencies 2 the superdiffusion stage switches to normal diffusion earlier than at 2 at time 2 this behavior is the same as for the forcing amplitude in regions i ii thus in the same manner the diffusivity grows as decreases as the longer interval till t of superdiffusive dispersion growth is used at the forcing period getting longer however at smaller frequencies 3 2 it is the dispersionless phase that gets interrupted prematurely i e it is not realized in full till 3 as it would have at 0 so the earlier such a switch occurs i e the shorter the the higher diffusivity is obtained in the late time normal diffusion stage this explains the growth of d with at 3 2 the maximum in d is thus observed at max 2 this differs from monotonically decreasing d in re gions i ii such a nonmonotonic dependence d was observed in 30 31 the forcing studied was sinusoidal in time its amplitude indeed corresponded to region iii in terminology of this work max together with 2 2 increase with the tempera ture the maximal value of the diffusivity achieved at max increases as the temperature decreases

show approximately linear growth at 2 3 dispersionless stage duration 3 2 growing fast at tem perature decreasing and so does d at a given near 2 in a limited range of temperatures so abnormal tem perature dependence of the diffusivity tad is realized in intermediate region of the forcing frequencies around 2 the temperature dependence of the diffusivity is studied in more detail in sec iv below d diffusivity at high forcing frequency as the simulation results suggest the power law de cay of d at large s figs 3 6 9 does not hold at frequencies that are too high above 1 10 th of the eigenfrequency at the lattice potential minima this is due to the diffusion process becoming markedly non equilibrium the distribution function in velocities dif fers significantly from such at constant forcing at all times description in terms of the velocity potential w v is no longer useful to analyze this we introduce kinetic temperature t m v 2 u 0 i e made dimensionless with the same

duration with the diffusivity as in such a regime theoretically 2 t n 2 t n 2 for n n these results in part mean that the rule of superdiffu sion or dispersionless stage however these are modified in the high frequency regime terminating and turning into normal diffusion after one period of forcing no longer ap plies at high forcing frequencies this leads to the d derivation based on approximations eqs 13 16 progres sively less accurate at higher s the power law decay first slowing down and then going into a completely dif ferent regime at approaching 2 at 2 the diffusivity tends to the diffusivity of particles in the lattice periodic potential in the absence of extra driving ft t such an asymptote is shown by the horizontal dot dashed line in fig 6 iv dependence of diffusivity on temperature at fixed forcing frequency having studied how the temperature behavior of diffu sion changes at gradual forcing frequency increase here we investigate in more detail how the diffusivity changes with the temperature at fixed frequency besides theoret ical importance the results are of interest to experimen talists oftentimes changing the frequency in the system is

from below temperature in tervals contrary to the tad behavior observed in 22 for constant forcing in 22 the diffusivity was numerically checked growing only in region ii at 0 at tempera ture decreasing down to t 0 097 such a behavior was understood theoretically dependence d exp e kbt was predicted at low temperatures going all the way down to 0 and agreed well with simulation results in the current setup with periodic forcing similar tem perature dependence is observed too d exp 1 t 1 0 19 but only above certain temperature the growth slows down as the temperature keeps decreasing d reaches maximum dmax tmax at certain tmax and starts de creasing with further decrease in t the behavior at lower temperatures is well approximated by d exp 2 t 2 0 20 in the absence of forcing we

amplitude in region i 1 the time at which su perdiffusion starts about the potential well escape time increases with the temperature decreasing spd 2 1 at the same time decreases this is seen to result in the diffusivity growing with the temperature agreeing with the results shown in the 10 2 part of fig 11 in region ii 1 increases with the temperature decreas ing as well spd however also increases with the temper ature decreasing middle graph in fig 12 curves 3 5 contrary to the behavior for fe in region i tad is real ized at these temperatures at temperature tmax f t 0 194 in this graph 2 becomes equal to 2 the period of forcing at this temperature the maximal diffusivity is achieved corresponding to the longest ac tual superdiffusion stage at the given forcing frequency tad is only realized at temperatures above tmax fe even though spd superdiffusion duration at constant forcing still grows at further temperature decrease to gether with 2 in periodic forcing setup superdiffusion effectively ends earlier at t it is this superdiffu sion interruption at t that makes d t behavior at lower temperatures to diverge in the periodic forc ing setup from that at constant forcing in the constant forcing problem based on the same logic tad must be realized all the way down to t 0 in agreement with conclusions in 22 it is clear from this argument that there is no uniform convergence with of d t curves to d t f const at getting smaller d t gets close to such a d t curve for constant forcing on longer t interval down to progressively lower temperatures however at any there exists ttad such that normal temperature de pendence of the diffusivity is restored at t ttad this non uniform convergence is shown in the right plot in fig 11 the same behavior is observed in region iii the max imal diffusivity is achieved at tmax fe corresponding to the longest superdiffusion stage at the given the lowest temperature at which tad is realized is the one at which 2 reaches the period of external force more pre cisely the time of superdiffusion interruption at a given at this temperature d t fe const crosses zero value the interval of temperatures in which tad is observed is wider than at forcing in region ii due to the presence of dispersionless phase curve 4 in the right plot in fig 12 experimentally it is simpler to observe tad at larger fe at which within the period of ft t the superdiffusion stage is used to larger extent and the temperature interval of tad is thus wider presented study of the diffusion under external forcing can be summarized by the following schematics fig 13 force amplitudes fall into three regions i iii in re gion i the diffusivity grows with the temperature increas ing in regions ii iii the dependence d t is nonmono tonic it shows a maximum at certain tmax below tmax the temperature dependence of the diffusivity is normal d t 0 temperature interval of tad exists above tmax d t 0 in the forcing frequency dependence of the diffusiv ity on the other hand it is regions i and ii that look alike at the frequency decreasing from a fraction of the potential eigenfrequency the diffusivity grows monoton ically getting to a flat region at 2 in which it virtually reaches its limiting d 0 value in re gion iii the d curve passes through a maximum near 2 2 2 corresponding to the end time of su perdiffusion stage 2 at constant forcing at frequencies getting smaller the forcing period contains progressively longer interval of would be in the constant forcing problem dispersionless and at yet smaller frequencies normal diffusion time interval resulting in d decreasing at such further decrease v sinusoidal in time external forcing here we show the frequency dependence of the diffu sivity for sinusoidal in time external forcing we observe the same features in d as we saw for pcp forcing main conclusions of the sections above thus appear not to depend critically on specific form of time dependence 13 0 1 0 1

according to a power law at 2 2 2 being the superdiffusion stage ending time at constant ex ternal forcing with the same amplitude fe in region iii d grows linearly with at intermediate s reaches a maximum then shows a power law decay at larger fre quencies for all force amplitudes the power law decay switches to more complex behavior at reaching about 1 10 th of the potential eigenfrequency presence of periodic forcing of any form of time dependence leads to significant enhancement in diffusiv ity this enhancement is somewhat smaller for sinusoidal forcing in regions i ii can be understood as at the same fe the average over period forcing ft t is smaller for sinusoidal than for pcp forcing in region iii the max imum in diffusivity is achieved at smaller max and the value of dmax is larger than such a maximal diffusiv ity at corresponding max pcp under pcp driving with the same amplitude fe this can be understood from the same argument as in region iii the diffusivity de 14 creases with the forcing increasing all other parameters kept constant vi conclusions we investigated enhancement of diffusion in 1 d space periodic underdamped systems by external time periodic fields we showed that the diffusion can be enhanced by orders of magnitude at certain choice of temperatures t forcing amplitudes fe and frequencies three regions of fe exist i iii in which dependences of diffusivity d on t and differ qualitatively at all fe there is an interval of small frequencies in which d depends only weakly on the frequency ap proaching the limiting value d 0 this value coin cides withd at constant bias force with the same value fe in the case of piecewise constant in time periodic pcp forcing the form ft t of forcing we focused on in this study at larger frequencies from 2 2 2 corre sponding to the superdiffusion stage ending time 2 to about 2 10 dimensionful frequency 1 10 th of the potential eigenfrequency 0 d decays with accord ing to a power law the exponent of this decay is related to the superdiffusion stage exponent at yet larger fre quencies non equilibrium effects slow down the power law decay of d and after a local maximum in d near 0 8 0 d tends to its asymptotic value coinciding with the diffusivity in the absence of external forcing at small forcing amplitudes in regions i and ii d decreases monotonically with frequency from its value at constant forcing all the way till the non equilibrium effects become critical at 0 3 0 at stronger forc ing region iii d is nonmonotonic a maximum is reached at max 2 d grows monotonically on 0 max this growth is approximately linear on certain interval to the left of 2 we studied the temperature dependence of the diffu sivity at fixed contrary to the constant forcing prob lem 22 the diffusivity increases with the temperature for all fe when the temperature is below certain frequency dependent threshold value limited temperature inter vals exist for the force amplitudes in regions ii and iii in which the diffusivity decreases with the temperature temperature abnormal diffusivity tad the physical reason behind the strong diffusivity en hancement is emergence of two populations of particles under the action of external force locked and running ones at optimal fe and t the number of particles in the two populations is comparable long flights of the running particles relative to the locked population take place with significant probability resulting in giant en hancement of diffusion for comparison we studied diffusivity under sinusoidal in time driving we saw that the same features in d are observed in the three regions of force amplitudes as in pcp driving case we thus conjecture that the quali tative features of d t fe behavior are insensitive to specific functional dependence of the symmetric smooth enough in t external force on time the effects investigated allow for simple experimen tal verification diffusion of particles on solid body sur face is one natural arena for this such systems are characterized by low dissipation 36 another field to study tad in is in propagation of magnetic particles on non magnetic substrate acted upon with electromag netic fields abnormal diffusion enhancement could be manifested in e g enhanced growth of islands of the new phase at decreasing temperatures once verified experimentally the effect of abnormal diffusion enhancement can find applications in a number of new technologies in sorting of particles manufactur ing surface structures with required properties control ling penetration of
