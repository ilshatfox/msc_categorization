brownian particles in tilted pe riodic potentials we show that the particles exhibit normal diffusive motion right after transi tioning into the running state dragged by the constant bias force no special transient dynamics appears contrary to conjectures in the previous studies the observed flat segment in the disper sion evolution curve is solely due to the broad spatial distribution of particles formed in the early superdiffusion stage we quantitatively describe the whole evolution of the distribution function during superdiffusion and the transition to the normal diffusion that follows in the framework of the 2 well potential in the velocity space model we show that the superdiffusion exponent is 3 estimate of the duration of the ostensible dispersionless regime is provided it is shown to diverge exponentially as the temperature decreases to zero phenomena of brownian particle transport and diffu sion in tilted periodic potentials are realized in many di verse systems

dx dt 0 when studying this underdamped problem in 16 the authors observed a horizontal plateau superficially 0 cf fig 1 below in 2 t curve spanning 2 decades for the specified force range the authors provided analytical arguments on the nature of that plateau which they inter preted as a manifestation of special novel dispersionless transport regime in particular by studying the motion of an individual brownian particle after it leaving its ini tial locked state the authors believed to have proved that the particle spends long time on a trajectory that does not deviate further than a from deterministic x vrt x 0 before eventually switching to normal diffusive behavior the findings of 16 got differing interpretations in later works coherent motion is discussed in 18 in the ab sence of net time averaged particle motion in the setup with the constant bias force f replaced by a time periodic force f t with zero mean in a series of works 19 21 the authors observe the same horizontal plateau in 2 t evo lution in setups at either constant f 19 or time periodic f t forcing they call the corresponding stage of system evolution subdiffusion without checking if the known mechanisms behind subdiffusion 17 are realized the reason for identification of the plateau stage in 2 t evo lution with subdiffusion stems just from the observation that the diffusion coefficient defined in this stage when the system does not show normal diffusive behavior as d t 2 2 t decreases with time in this letter we show that in proper sense no spe cial dispersionless physics happens in the tilted peri odic potential with brownian particles subject to white gaussian noise nor does subdiffusion occur following the initial superdiffusion stage instead brownian particles demonstrate normal brownian motion normal diffusion shortly after transitioning into the running state the nearly invariance of 2 t and spatial distribution func tion n x t in the comoving frame are solely due to the initial broad spatial distribution formed at the superdiffu sion stage with no novel physics on top we also demon strate how erroneous conclusions may be and often are drawn by visual inspection of dispersion 2 t curves and by improper definition of the diffusion coefficient d in transient regime in which 2 t deviates substantially from the normal diffusion fick s law 2 2 d t form we analyze the

numerically using a verlet type algorithm 22 using the same procedure as described in 23 the time step was selected in such a way that the maximal distance covered by the particle in one step was within 10 3 of the lattice spacing the statistical averag ing was performed over the ensemble of at least 5 104 particles the ensemble of 106 particles was used to derive particle velocity and coordinate distribution functions fig 1 shows time evolution of the dispersion of brown ian particles for different values of the external force f at early times after the initial transient we see

for comparison of definitions of d we also show the pe clet number defined with integrally defined diffusion coefficient dint t 2 t 2 t as used in particular in 19 21 curve 2 in the top fig 2 fig 2 demonstrates that the pe clet number shows no spectacular features in the segment of the dispersionless transport t t 1 t 2 t 1 1 5 103 t 2 3 5 104 at f 0 25 4 pe is nowhere infinite as it must have been for truly co herent transport moreover the peint t computed with the dint t stays below 1 throughout the dispersionless regime whereas the pe defined with the differential definition of d line 1 reaches the constant value of some what over 3 at the very beginning of the dispersionless regime and statistically oscillates around that value into the asymptotic normal diffusion regime these conclusions based on the pe t behaviour contra dicting the reported dispersionless transport features are corroborated by the dispersion growth rate d 2 t dt in the t 1 t 2 interval shown in the lower part of fig 2 we see that not only d 2 dt never becomes zero but in fact it never drops in statistically significant manner below the asymptotic value of 2 d d 2 dt simply approaches that value from above at t 4 103 within the dispersion less interval and statistically fluctuates around 2 d at all later times to elucidate the somewhat paradoxical look of 2 t curves in fig 1 that has led different authors to search ing for novel physics in time interval t 1 t 2 we compare in fig 3 the appearance of the dispersion evolution in log log scale customarily used in the references and in linear scale superficial impression arising from fig 3 a is that 2 t undergoes rapid superdiffusive growth between t 10 and t t 1 the dispersion stays unchanged at t t 1 t 2 and eventually after t t 2 normal diffusion with 1 ensues however the flatness of 2 t curve on t t 1 t 2 is in a sense illusory it is an artifact of the log log scale and the preceding fast growing segment of the dispersion curve the red dashed line in upper fig 3 shows the linear fit 2 t 2 dt 21 seen to be virtu ally indistinguishable from the simulated 2 t through the whole dispersionless interval t 1 t 2 and the late time normal diffusion stage figure 3 b makes the fact of the linear 2 t growth on t 1 t 2 more overt with linear scale used at both axes the fast superdiffusion with 2 t t 3 is observed at t t 1 it results in the broad distribution of particles at t 1 that would have required 100 times longer time to be formed if diffused according to the linear diffusion law 2 2 dt with that it takes much time till t 2 for the linear growth of 2 t after t 1 to become apparent in the logarithmic scale used in fig 3 a modulo this artifact of the initial broad distribution at t 1 spreading of the particle ensem ble at t t 1 t 2 follows usual linear fick s law no novel physics is needed to explain the found ensemble evolution let us explain the evolution of the spatial distribution function by considering the process of transitioning of the particles into the running state in the two well velocity potential theory 23 the effective potential w v has two minima that correspond to locked and running particles located at vl 0 and vr f and a maximum between them at v vcr f 23 27 in this potential the particles transition from the locked state to the running state with the rate of wlr and in the opposite direction with rate wrl figure 4 shows the simulated according to eq 2 par ticle velocity distribution n v at different times at t 0 all the particles are in the locked state with time the particles gradually transition into the running state this transition is virtually finished by t t 1 when n v t assumes its final asymptotic shape corre sponding to all the particles having transitioned into

at which wlr wrl so the reverse transitions from the running to the locked state can be ignored 23 27 the problem is thus transformed to computation of the exit of the particles in contact with the thermal reservoir from the potential well this is described by the poisson process the number of particles transitioning in t t dt into the running state is wlr exp wlrt dt the average velocity of such particles after the transition is vr f this yields exponential distribution of the running parti cles over x n x t wlr vr exp wlr t x vr t vrt x 5 where y 1 if y 0 0 if y 0 is the heaviside

constant diffusivity d from asymptotic late time 2 t evolved from the initial condition given by curve 1 at t t 1 to time moments t 2 and 10 6 we see excellent agreement between the simulated n x t and the n x t obtained by normal diffusion of the initial profile of t t 1 in the log log graph of 2 t the ostensible horizontal segment ends when the normal diffusive broadening of the n x t becomes of the order of the broad n x t 1 width formed by the end of the superdiffusion stage therefore it is natural to define t 2 by 2 dt 2 2 t 1 accordingly the timespan of the horizontal section is tdl t

horizontal section in the log log graph of 2 t this imposes constraints on the form of the stationary particle velocity distribution tad is ob served when the stationary velocity distribution has two maxima 23 27 both locked and running states occupied with a significant fraction of all particles for the per ceivable dispersionless regime the tilt f must be above the upper limit fr of tad yielding

used in this letter fr 0 1 impression of coherent phase in the 2 t graph should appear at f fr 1 this agrees with the behavior observed in fig 1 in conclusion we have analyzed the dispersionless transport 16 of brownian particles in the washboard po tential which received conflicting interpretations in recent works 18 21 we showed that the whole phenomenon is due to the broad spatial distribution of the particles formed by the end t 1 of the superdiffusion phase which requires significant time t 2 t 1 t 1 to be noticeably broadened further by slow normal diffusion t 1 is the time needed for most of the particles to transition from the initial locked state to the running state with v f for the running particles the superdiffusion phase has been proven to have exponent 3 the evolution of the spatial ensemble dispersion 2 t during the superdif fusion phase its transition into normal diffusion after t 1 have been quantitatively described in the 2 well potential in the velocity space theory 23 we have shown that the evolution of the distribution function n x t follows nor mal diffusion equation with constant diffusion coefficient d right after t 1 no novel transient physical behavior of particles right after transitioning into the running state as theorized in 16 was observed the phenomenon of dispersionless transport occurs at bias force values f fr fr being the upper boundary of the bias at which tad is observed at these values in the stationary distribution in the velocity space formed after t 1 the vast majority of the particles are in the run ning state the timespan of this dispersionless regime is given by eq 10 it increases at the temperature q de creasing mainly exponentially exp qf q we are grateful to igor goychuk for the opportunity to cross
