november 2021 appeared as editors suggestion in phys rev lett 127 207204 6 pp 2021 by controlling quantum fluctuations via the falk bruch inequality we give the first rigorous argument for the existence of a spin glass phase in the quantum sherrington kirkpatrick model with a transverse magnetic field if the temperature and the field are sufficiently low the argument also applies to the generalization of the model with multi spin interactions sometimes dubbed as the transverse p spin model introduction spin glasses constitute a particularly multi facetted topic in the statistical mechanics of disordered sys tems classical spin glass models such as the mean field one by sherrington and kirkpatrick sk 44 were origi nally introduced to understand the unusual magnetic proper ties observed in some metal alloys with irregularly compet ing ferro and anti ferromagnetic interactions beyond their ongoing significance in condensed matter physics 20 such models with their built in frustration have evolved meanwhile into paradigms in optimization information processing and the theory of neural networks 33 37 their rich low energy structure and complexity continues to generate deep scientific discoveries for example among the recent excitements in computation is a conditional proof based on the widely be lieved assumption of replica symmetry breaking of the existence of a polynomial time classical algorithm for find ing an approximate bit string whose energy is with high prob ability close to the lowest sk energy 34 such an algo rithm is not believed to exist for a search of the ground state energy in p spin generalizations of the sk model quan tum mechanics promises to offer help in the form of quan tum adiabatic annealing or quantum approximate optimiza tion algorithms 3 4 6 10 16 18 26 in this context but also purely motivated by the fact that spin glasses are proto types for the emergence of non ergodic behavior in disordered quantum systems 5 28 36 42 45 it is important to study quantum versions of classical spin glass models this can be done by taking the quantum nature of spins seriously and by adding a transverse magnetic field to the classical energy landscape which induces quantum effects most prominent is the quantum sherrington kirkpatrick model qskm with n 2 three component vector spins of main quantum num ber 1 2 or qubits their z components interact with each other in a random fashion while their x components interact individually with a constant magnetic field of strength b 0 externally applied along the positive x direction up to a fac tor 1 2 the j th spin operator may be represented by the triple sxj 0 1 1 0 s y j 0 i i 0 szj 1 0 0 1 of pauli matrices and is meant to act on the j th factor of the tensor product hilbert space hn nj 1 c 2 and as the iden tity on the other factors the hamiltonian or energy operator of the qskm is then defined on hn by the sum hn j un b n j 1 sxj j 0 b 0 1 with its dimensionless classical zero field sk part un 1 n 1 j k n gjks z j s z k 2 here the spin coupling is only pairwise and given by in dependent identically distributed gaussian random variables gjk with mean e g 12 0 and variance e g 2 12 1 mod eling frozen in spatial disorder of the glass of strength j 0 as usual the thermal average for reciprocal temperature 0 is given by the canonical gibbs expectation tr e hn zn with the partition function zn tr e hn as the normalization factor for b 0 there is no a priori globally preferred spin orientation and no conven tional magnetic order arises yet one expects spin glass order even for b 0 in the sense that e qn e sz 1 sz 2 2 0 in the limit of a macroscopically large number of spins n provided that the temperature and the field are sufficiently low here we are using the model s spin index symmetry under the probabilistic disorder expectatione and the 0 1 valued random variable qn 2 n n 1 1 j k n szj szk 2 3 http arxiv org abs 2106 00500 v 4 2 as the corresponding order parameter it may be rewritten as qn n n 1 r 2 n 1 n 1 in terms of rn n 1 n j 1 szj szj the replica overlap operator for the duplicated model with hilbert space hn hn hamiltonian hn 1 1 hn and associated gibbs expectation strict positivity of e qn e sz 1 sz 2 2 is therefore equivalent to replica symmetry breaking as n main result the main result of this letter is a proof of this replica symmetry breaking at small enough temper ature and field strength this is facilitated by extending a key observation of bray and moore 7 generalized to cer tain non gaussian probability distributions of g 12 by aizen man lebowitz and ruelle 2 to the present quantum case b 0 the mean order parametere qn is related to the mean e un of the zero field part of the hamiltonian specif ically by the spin index symmetry and a standard gaussian integration by parts it is straightforward to obtain 2 n 1 e un n e g 12 sz 1 sz 2 n e sz 1 sz 2 g 12 j e sz 1 sz 2 sz 1 sz 2 sz 1 sz 2 2 j e

1 where the inequalities hold for general self adjoint a a and the equality is due to a 2 1 for the present a in the classical commutative case b 0 the third inequality is also an equality and 4 turns into 4 3 of 7 and 4 1 of 2 for gaussian disorder for general b 0 we need a lower bound on a a bet ter than a 2 in order to obtain a non trivial lower bound on e a 2 from 4 as our second main ingredient for the proof we control the quantum fluctuations by the falk bruch inequality 17 see also 15 43 a a a 2 1 4 a 2 a hn a 5 the function 0 0 1 from the positive half line to the left open unit interval is defined implicitly by the relation r tanh r r 1 tanh r it is monotone decreasing and convex with 0 1 moreover it can be estimated from below according to t t 1 1 e t max 0 1 t 2 see 15 we also note that the gibbs expectation of the double commutator in the argument of in 5 equals the scalar prod uct hn a hn a and is hence positive for a general self adjoint a since in the present case a sz 1 sz 2 com mutes with un the double commutator is independent of j and simply given by a hn a 4 b sx 1 s x 2 6 combining 4 5 6 and using jensen s inequality for the convex together with spin index symmetry yields the basis for our main result theorem 1 the mean of the spin glass order parameter 3 has a lower bound according to e qn 2 be sx 1 2 j 1 n 1 e un 7 it is valid for any 0 j 0 b 0 and all n 2 for more explicit bounds we further estimate the right hand side rhs of 7 starting with its first term adding to the hamiltonian 1 the term b b 1 sx 1 with b 1 0 and estimat ing the associated local susceptibility results in the differen tial inequality for the transverse magnetization b 1 sx 1 b 1 sx 1 sx 1 b 1 sx 1 2 b 1 1 sx 1 2 b 1 integrating by separation of variables and observing sx 1 0 0 we hence obtain sx 1 tanh b which by the mono tonicity of results in the estimates 2 be sx 1 2 b tanh b 2 b 8 a simple bound on the second term in 7 results from the non random ground state energy j 0 of jun n as n with the constant 0 763 according to 12 41 combined with 8 this leads to the more explicit lower bound q j b lim inf n e qn 2 b tanh b 2 j 9 on the lower limit of the sequence e qn n 2 in the unit interval 0 1 for b 0 the rhs of 9 is strictly positive for temperatures below j 2 0 655 j this not max imum temperature regime for the existence of a spin glass phase agrees with the one found in 4 14 of 2 in this regime the spin glass phase is seen to survive when turning on the transverse magnetic field provided that b j 0 is so small that the rhs of 9 remains strictly positive this condition is implied by the slightly stronger but simpler one 1 e 2 b 4 b j yielding in the zero temperature limit the same maximum field strength j 4 0 328 j as from 9 to establish the persistence of spin glass order for suffi ciently small b j also for temperatures up to the zero field critical freezing temperature j we start from the observa tion that 5 and hence 7 are equalities for b 0 and remain rather sharp for small b 0 consequently 7 should cover 3 the whole regime b 1 j to confirm this we es timate the mean u j b lim infn e un n of the zero field sk part 2 by the fisher type 21 inequality u j b a 1 ln cosh b u j a 0 q j a 0 1 j a 2 10 with an arbitrary a 0 it results from the convexity of ln zn j b in j together with the peierls bogolyubov and golden thompson bounds zn j 0 zn j b zn j 0 cosh b n on the partition function the equal ity in 10 is due to 7 for b 0 using 8 and 10 with a ab 2 ln cosh b in 7 for n leads to q j b 1 ab j q j ab 0 1 2 b tanh b 2 ab j q j ab 0 3 b 11 the simplifying second inequality follows by observing ab 0 b estimating t as above and assuming j 1 finally we fix an arbitrary j 1 which is equivalent to q j 0 0 characterizing the spin glass phase for b 0 see 53 the continuity of u j a 0 in a by 39 49 and hence of q j a 0 yields the continuity of the rhs of 11 in b its strict positivity for b 0 therefore extends to suf ficiently small b 0 1 3 in other words the well known spin glass phase without a field persists with a low enough transverse field at any temperature below j discussion over the years various approximate and or numerical studies like 19 24 35 50 52 have suggested for the qskm a temperature field phase diagram with a critical line between the spin glass and the paramagnetic phases as sketched in fig 1 see also 47 in particular these studies have predicted a quantum phase transition at zero temperature and b j 1 51 or 1 6 the red cross shaded regime in fig 1 illustrates where we prove the existence of spin glass order by the lower bounds 9 and 11 here the tiny regime above the temperature j 2 is produced by inserting the asymptotic expansion of q j 0 close to j 1 from 46 into the rhs of 11 apart from that we have no prediction for the location of the true critical line in particular our zero temperature critical field j 4 is very likely too small as is the whole cross shaded regime the precise location and nature of the true quantum critical point remains an important problem in particular in the context of adiabatic algorithms nevertheless our rigorous result supports the conjecture that the ground state typically has localization properties with re spect to the eigenbasis of un it does not rule out though a weak form of restoration of ergodicity through quantum tun neling for those parameters put forward in 9 35 36 42 to clarify this question it is necessary to consider the probabilis tic distribution function of the order parameter and not just its mean because the sequence qn n 2 is not expected to be self averaging in the spin glass phase spin glass paramagnet 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 0 1 1 j b j 1 2 1 4 fig 1 in the temperature field plane the red cross shaded regime indicates where we prove the existence of spin glass order in the qskm by 9 and respectively by 11 combined with 46 see text the red dashed line is a cartoon of the critical line between the spin glass and the paramagnetic phases as obtained by approxi mate arguments and or numerical methods 19 24 35 50 52 the blue line shaded regime for j 1 indicates where the spin glass order parameter is rigorously known to vanish 29 in this context we recall that for b 0 the mean free en ergy limn e ln zn j 0 n and hence also the rhs of 10 is exactly determined by parisi s zero field distribution function on 0 1 which with increasing j 1 exhibits replica symmetry breaking 12 39 41 48 49 in contrast no closed form expressions are available for b 0 recently the qskm free energy which previously has been proved to exist and to be independent of the specific proba bility distribution of the coupling coefficient g 12 as long as e g 12 0 and e g 12 3 see 11 was shown to be given by a variational formula in terms of a parisi like func tional for an infinite component vector spin model 1 how ever no conclusion could so far be drawn about emerging phases form this formula in contrast for the simpler case j 1 it is known 29 that the free energy coincides with its annealed version and that there is no spin glass phase for any b 0 see the blue line shaded regime in fig 1 the com bination of this result with the present one rigorously proves the existence of a phase transition in the qskm related to replica symmetry breaking but fig 1 clearly calls for fur ther rigorous work on this model for a family of quantum hierarchical models dubbed as qgrem which for b 0 were originally introduced by derrida 13 as approximations to the more difficult sk model explicit formulas for the free energy are available 31 also for b 0 unlike for their classical counterparts the phase diagrams of these qgrems seem to capture the qskm only on a qualitative level though since their critical lines reach up to j 0 separating a quantum paramagnetic phase from a classical one at high temperatures 4 extensions the above simple strategy for proving replica symmetry breaking has straightforward extensions from our proof it is evident that theorem 1 remains true as it stands if one adds to 1 any term commuting with un that is possibly random but independent of un such as for ex ample a zeeman term corresponding to a magnetic field in z direction adapting the more involved argument of 2 our bounds can also be extended from gaussian to more general symmetric distributions of the coupling coefficients this strategy can also be applied to quantum spin glass models with multi spin interactions for example to the trans verse p spin model this model generalizes the zero field sk part 2 of 1 for each natural p 2 to un p 2 np 1 1 j 1 jp n gj 1 j 2 jps z j 1 szj 2 s z jp where gj 1 j 2 jp are independent and identically distributed standard gaussian random variables for p 2 this clas sical zero field hamiltonian exhibits at its freezing tempera ture finite and not replica symmetry breaking 22 pro ceeding for the quantum model as in 4 and introducing p n n n p np which tends to one as n the mean zero field energy e un p n e g 12 p sz 1 sz 2 szp np 1 p 2 is now related to the mean of the p th power of the replica overlap operator e rp n p n e sz 1 sz 2 szp 2 op n where op n is a term which goes to zero as n since the double commutator 6 for a sz 1 sz 2 szp equals 4 b p j 1 sxj we thus obtain the following generalization of theorem 1 theorem 2 the mean of the p th power of the replica overlap operator is lower bounded according to e rp n p n p be sx 1 2 j 1 n e un op n 12 for any 0 j 0 b 0 and all n p as before we may further estimate the transverse magne tization sx 1 tanh b and bound the second term in 12 by the ground state energy of the zero field p spin model which itself is asymptotically as n lower bounded by j ln 2 the known value for p using slepian s lemma see 8 this proves a spin glass phase in a regime where the temperature and the field are low enough 14 38 however the larger we choose p the smaller the regime be comes in the limit p replica symmetry breaking cannot be concluded by the above strategy this limit corresponds to the quantum random energy model qrem its zero field part un is given in its canoni cal eigenbasis by the eigenvalues g n 2 with standard gaussian random variables g which are independent and identically distributed for distinct z configurations 1 1 n in this case the phase diagram is known 23 for general and b 0 even at the rigorous level 30 as goldschmidt s calculations 23 suggest in the spin glass phase the whole distribution of the replica overlap rn of the qrem turns out to agree with its classical analog in particular for this phase one can prove 32 that limn e rn 1 2 ln 2 j conclusion we have presented a simple argument that establishes replica symmetry breaking in spin glass models with a transverse field it relies on a susceptibility bound from 17 combined with an extension of the classical relation be tween the mean spin glass order parameter q and the mean of the zero field part of the energy to the quantum case for the prominent quantum sk model we have discussed in detail two resulting strictly positive but not optimal lower bounds on q nevertheless our method has extensions beyond the quan tum sk model we thank one of the referees for stimulating us to consider also temperatures between j 2 and j cm and sw are supported by the dfg
