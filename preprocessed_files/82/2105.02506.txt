drive pasadena california 91109 8099 usa dated may 7 2021 quantum back action imposes fundamental sensitivity limits to the majority of quantum measure ments the effect results from the unavoidable contamination of the measured parameter with the quantum noise of a meter back action evading measurements take advantage of the quantum cor relations introduced by the system under study to the meter and allow overcoming the fundamental limitations the measurements are frequently restricted in their bandwidth due to a finite response time of the system components here we show that probing a mechanical oscillator with a dichro matic field with frequencies separated by the oscillator frequency enables independent detection and complete subtraction of the measurement noise associated with the quantum back action detection of a classical force acting on a free mass or a mechanical oscillator using an optical meter is one of the major problems of modern optomechanics it is related to precision measurements of gravitational waves 1 2 gravity 3 acceleration 4 torque 5 7 and magnetic field 8 9 the problem is also linked to the frequency conversion between microwaves and light 10 11 and to the testing the limits of quantum mechanics 12 13 the fundamental sensitivity of the measurement is restricted by so called standard quantum limit sql 14 15 un less a special measurement procedure is utilized in this letter we introduce a new technique allowing beating the sql in a broad frequency range sql was studied in many physical systems ranging from kilometer sized gravitational wave detectors 16 to microcavities 17 18 for instance let us consider the dispersive optomechanical interaction 19 20 realized in an optical cavity where position of a mechanical body moving mirror modifies the cavity eigenfrequency a force proportional to the optical power or to the num ber of optical quanta inside the optical cavity occurs due to the light pressure in the case of a coordinate mea surement the sql results from the noise introduced by the pressure force since the information about the co ordinate is recorded in the phase of the light reflected from the mechanical system the signal is masked by the phase noise of the readout the radiation pressure noise also masking the signal is proportional to the amplitude fluctuations of the readout phase and amplitude fluctu ations of the same monochromatic wave do not commute and as the result cannot be simultaneously reduced to zero quantum theory does not allow accurate simul taneous measurements of the amplitude and phase fluc tuations of the readout this leads to the sql of the coordinate measurements of a force the sql does not pose a general fundamental limit for the classical force detection it can be avoided by ap plying a variational measurement technique 16 21 22 preparation of the probe light in an quantum squeezed state leads to the optimum measurement sensitivity bet ter than sql 23 29 the limit also can be surpassed with coherent quantum noise cancellation technique 30 32 and utilization of optical rigidity 33 34 optomechanical systems having several degrees of free dom in the optical probe mechanical system or both fea ture more complex interactions including radiation pul ing negative radiation pressure 35 36 ponderomotive force proportional to a generalized optical quadrature 16 21 37 38 as well as mechanical velocity rather than coordinate dependent interaction 39 40 poly chromatic probe can facilitate force measurements with better than sql sensitivity 41 42 this technique was adopted for a cavity with a movable test mass probed with the light modulated at frequency twice of the me chanical frequency 43 46 usage of two tone local os cillator for analysis of the signal produced in the cavity interrogated with a monochromatic light wave results in back action evading measurement with sensitivity limited by thermal noise 47 we here propose to merge the variational measurement and dichromatic interrogation techniques to improve the detection of the force we have realized that illuminat ing a mechanical oscillator with a dichromatic wave and properly measuring the signal using ideas of the varia tional approach results in decoupling the measured sig nal from the back action noise as a result the back action noise can be detected separately from the signal and subtracted from the measured signal while postpro cessing the measurement results such a measurement allows detection of the mechanical force with sensitivity better than sql the technique described in what follows has several novel features a standard variational measurement has a narrow bandwidth shrinking with the measurement sensitivity improvement one cannot overcome sql in a broad frequency band without usage of a special sig nal post processing technique moreover the variation measurement is applicable only if the signal force acts ar x iv 2 10 5 02 50 6 v 1 qu an t ph 6 m ay 2 02 1 2 on a free test mass it cannot be used for detection of a resonant force acting on a mechanical oscillator the technique described in this letter resolves both issues we show that the measurement can be broadband and also that it can be utilized for detection of a resonant force the main message of our study is that in the case of a polychromatic probe field the quantum back action can depend on the quantum fluctuations that commute with the measured observable of the probe field containing the signal and hence can be measured independently and subtracted from the measurement result such a mea surement is not feasible in the ordinary case when the back action results from the amplitude fluctuations of the monochromatic probe wave while the signal is recorded in the phase of the probe wave as the amplitude and phase of the same wave cannot be measured simulta neously in the same frequency band in what follows we illustrate our finding considering the case of a dis placement transducer comprising a mechanical oscilla tor interrogated with either monochromatic or polychro matic light and using a homodyne detection scheme with either monochromatic or polychromatic local oscillator we start from a brief review of the standard variational approach and then introduce the dichromatic probe tech nique let us consider a scheme in which a monochromatic optical probe wave with carrier frequency 0 is reflected from a movable mirror being a part of the mechanical oscillator of frequency m with mass m the infor mation about a force of interest fs t is obtained by the detection of the optimal quadrature amplitude of the reflected light we present amplitude of the probe wave as a a a exp i 0 t and normalize it so that p 0 0 a 2 becomes the averaged power of the probe wave 16 considering coherent probe we can write a t a t t t and a t a t t t where stands for ensemble average introducing fourier transform for the annihilation operator as a t a exp i t d 2 we get corresponding rela tionships for the fourier amplitudes a a 2 and a a 2 we present the coordinate of the movable mirror as x m x x 0 x where x is the shift of the mirror due to the radiation pressure effects and x stands for the dimen sionless fluctuation of the mirror position the normal ization constant is x 0 2 m m 1 2 the radiation pressure due to the monochromatic probe

the following expres sion in the linear approximation by x b a 2 ikx 0 ax 2 where b a is output input amplitude the time independent phase shift due to the constant radia tion pressure is neglected

explaining a dichromatic varia tional measurement of a test mass with two probes having frequencies the test mass is a suspended perfectly reflecting mirror characterized with frequency m and mass m frequencies relate to mechanical frequency as m a classical feedback force has to be applied to the mirror to avoid resonant excitation of the mechanical oscillation b four monochromatic probe fields are incident on the same test mass from the opposite sides in this scheme the resonant ponderomotive mechanical excitation of the mir ror is compensated at m 0 the spectral density 8 corresponds to the sql of the force the term proportional to k in 5 stands for the quan tum back action it can be cancelled around the fixed frequency f 0 if one measures the quadrature b ba cos b sin with optimally

possible the thermal noise limits the sensitivity unless the signal frequency f 0 is far from the resonance frequency f 0 m m 21 the standard variational approach is not optimal for the resonant force detection to surpass the sql of the force measurement we suggest to utilize a dichro matic probe field interrogating a moving mirror which is a part of a mechanical oscillator let us consider first a toy model in which the displacement of the mechan ical oscillator is measured via registering quadratures of the two reflected light waves with carrier frequencies 0 m 2 see fig 1 a by using corresponding balanced homodyne detectors a classical resonant force fcomp is applied to the mirror to suppress its oscillation resulting from the ponderomotive resonant excitation we denote the amplitudes of the incident and re flected waves as a a exp i t and b b exp i t respectively and write the mirror posi tion in the form x m x 0 d d e i m t d d ei m t where a b d stand for the annihilation operators of the fields as well as the mirror position we also assume that there is a known classical resonant force fcompe i m t c c acting on the mirror the force is ap plied to suppress resonant oscillations of the probe mass the expectation values obey two expressions obtained using eqs 1 and 2 where the monochromatic field is replaced with the dichromatic one b a 1 4 k 2 x 20 a 2 m 10 md 2 ikx 0 a a fcomp 11 these expressions show that the measurement scheme supports excitation of the mechanical oscillation if fcomp 0 for identical probe harmonics a a this effect can be neglected if 1 k 4 m m however this condition prevents us from beating the sql on the other hand if we assume that the classical feedback force fcomp is selected so that 2 ikx 0 a a fcomp 0 and d 0 we can show below that in this case the sql can be beaten for the fourier amplitudes of the fluctuations we write input output relations b a 2 ikx 0 ad 12 b a 2 ikx 0 ad 13 d 2 i kx 0 a m i a a 14 i fs ffl m i where a a m 2 and a a m 2 and the same for b let us introduce quadrature amplitudes of the out put waves as b a b b 2 linear combinations of the commuting amplitude quadratures a b a b a 2 can be measured simultaneously we obtain for them a a 15 a a k 2 m m i a 16 k 2 m m i fs a ffl a we notice that to perform the optimal measurement one has to detect and record simultaneously a and a and then evaluate their linear combination b a k 2 m m i a a k 2 m m i fs a ffl a 17 4 in such a measurement the back action is completely ex cluded and the measurement sensitivity is defined by the spectral density sn 2 m 2 nt 1 4 2 m 2 m k 18 remarkably the back action is evaded in a broad fre quency range unlike the case of the conventional vari ational measurements the thermal noise term can be filtered out at small m and the sql can be beaten if m this result can be repeated with the phase quadratures for the toy measurement scheme above the sensitiv ity is formally limited because of the resonant growth of the amplitude d that prevents the increase of the sensi tivity with an optical power increase unless an optimal classical resonant force is applied to the mirror to com pensate for the unlimited classical amplitude growth an alternative quantum mechanochal approach involves two dicromatic waves incident on the opposite surfaces of the mirror mass see fig 1 b it allows to perform the mea surement without the classical feedback force we select the dichromatic probes characterized by a real amplitude a and frequencies 0 m 2 the same as previously for symmetry reasons we conclude that d 0 in this case two more harmonics centered at frequencies 0 3 m 2 have to be taken into account in addition to the main probe fields the fluctuations in other frequency bands can be neglected using eq 1 we derive an expression for the spectral amplitude of the mirror position d i fs ffl m i 2 ikx 0 a m i 19 l n 1 2 1 l 1 al n a l n where l 1 2 stands for the left right probe

important result since it shows that taking multiple frequency bands into account we can improve the fundamental sensitivity of the the measurement to conclude equation 26 is the main result of our study we have shown that using a dichromatic varia tional measurement is advantageous for the detection of a classical force acting on a mass of a linear mechani cal oscillator the peculiarity of the proposed technique is that the resonant dichromatic probe field enables the transfer of information from the quadrature of a me chanical oscillator to the commuting quadratures of the dichromatic optical field one can measure the optical quadratures separately and then subtract out the back action while processing the measurement results in our understanding this is a new kind of measurement tech nique since usually the back action cannot be measured separate from the signal in a standard scheme with a monochromatic pump the information about the posi tional coordinate is transferred to the phase of the probe wave in this case we have only one quantum output and the back action cannot be measured separate from the signal variational measurement allows the subtraction of the back action wthin a limited bandwidth the strat egy described in this letter allows beating the sql in a broad frequency band moreover involving several spec tral harmonics enables simultaneous independent mea surements in different frequency bands that result in fur ther sensitivity improvements authors are grateful to daniel sigg for very valuable discussion and remarks the research of spv has been
