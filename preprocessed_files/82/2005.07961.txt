nottingham ac uk lyudmila turyanska nottingham ac uk abstract pristine graphene and graphene based heterostructures exhibit exceptionally high electron mobility and conductance if their surface contains few electron scattering impurities here we reveal a universal connection between graphene s carrier mobility and the variation of its electrical conductance with carrier density our model of graphene conductivity is based on a convolution of carrier density and its uncertainty which reproduces the observed universality taking a single conductance measurement as input this model accurately predicts the full shape of the conductance versus carrier density curves for a wide range of reported graphene samples we verify the convolution model by numerically solving the boltzmann transport equation to analyse in detail the effects of charged impurity scattering on carrier mobility in this model we also include optical phonons which relax high energy charge carriers for small impurity densities our numerical and analytical results both capture the universality observed in experiment and provide a way to estimate all key transport parameters of graphene devices 2 our results demonstrate how the carrier mobility can be predicted and controlled thereby providing insights for engineering the properties of 2 d materials and heterostructures keywords graphene charged impurities optical phonons electrical properties 3 1 introduction the unique electrical properties of graphene such as high carrier mobility 104 cm 2 vs at room temperature 1 3 offer significant advantages for applications ranging from fast electronics to touch screens and ultrasensitive photon detection 4 6 however the emergence of graphene electronics on the market is limited by the absence of cost effective large scale production of high quality graphene with reproducible electronic properties the best results have been achieved in exfoliated suspended single layer graphene slg samples a few micrometres across in which is limited only by the scattering of charge carriers electrons and or holes by intrinsic phonons 7 8 epitaxial growth of graphene by cvd 9 10 or sic surface growth 11 12 methods provides cost effective growth of large 10 mm slg layers however the presence of charged impurities near the graphene significantly reduces due to the associated long range coulomb scattering centres 7 13 if impurities are present they often ionise and form charged scattering centres which deflect the trajectories of electrons and holes in the 2 d layer thereby degrading the mobility charged impurities are introduced in the substrate and or in the slg capping layer during the device processing e g created by the diffusion of metallic ions present in the solvents or etching solutions used 14 various theoretical models have been proposed to explain the effect of impurities on carrier mobility in slg and it is commonly accepted that is inversely proportional to the impurity density nimp and independent of carrier density 15 16 scattering by charge neutral point defects can also affect which is inversely proportional to the carrier density 17 18 making it the dominant scattering mechanism at large carrier densities the 2 d nature of slg means that it is sensitive to the surrounding environment in particular the presence and position of the charged impurities however there is still limited understanding of the effect of the stand off distance d of the impurities from the graphene plane on the carrier mobility and other transport parameters additional complications arise in graphene based heterostructures where 4 slg is sandwiched between two other materials with the same or different dimensionality 3 d bulk 2 d layers and or 0 d quantum dots 2 19 21 here we report a theoretical and experimental study of the effects of charged impurities and optical phonons on the charge transport properties of graphene we develop a graphene conductivity model based on the convolution of carrier density and its uncertainty this model accurately reproduces the experimental data and provides a robust and simple way to model graphene conductivity as a function of the doping level and an applied gate voltage to verify this model and extend the parameter and sample range investigated we also present numerical k space simulations of carrier transport based on a self consistent model for the minimum carrier concentration and a full time evolution of the momentum distribution of the charge carriers by using a discontinuous galerkin technique to solve the boltzmann transport equation numerically we analyse the effects of charged impurity scattering on the electron hole mobility and show how such processes give rise to the universal behaviour that we have identified we model the conductivity over a wide range of carrier densities in the presence of multiple sources of scattering and demonstrate that the mobility increases inversely as the conductance peak narrows the calculations are supported by analysing experimental results obtained on both pristine and surface decorated graphene devices our studies for the first time enable the development of quantitatively accurate first principles calculations of the entire set of transport parameters conductivity mobility carrier concentration and its uncertainty in graphene layers containing charged impurities these parameters are of fundamental importance to the full range of graphene based heterostructures developed for 2 d electronics 5 2 theoretical model in our work we consider graphene sheets with charged impurities at a distance dimp from the plane of the graphene and optical phonons figure 1 a we model the effect of these two scattering mechanisms on the following electrical properties of graphene the carrier concentration n mobility conductivity s and resistivity r at the dirac point rmax graphene conductivity in the vicinity of the dirac point can be strongly affected by a number of different phenomena besides impurity scattering including ballistic transport effects 22 quantum capacitance 7 23 and temperature 24 25 as a result the device conductivity and carrier density are non zero even when the fermi energy f is at the dirac charge neutrality point therefore a simple model for the drude conductivity 1 with a constant mobility is not applicable for small gate voltages assuming the constant capacitance model for graphene s carrier number density 2 where n 0 n vg 0 is the sheet density of the graphene doping supplementary information si 1 spatial fluctuations of the local electrostatic potential in the graphene layer and the presence of electron and hole puddles figure 1 b are thought to explain the non zero conductivity and resistance smin and rmax figure 1 c d observed at the dirac point 15 26 electrons and holes play equal roles in determining the graphene conductivity with no scattering at the borders between the n and p type graphene areas due to the klein paradox 27 we now introduce a model that includes the effect of spatial fluctuations on the carrier number density versus gate voltage relation combined with the drude conductivity this model accurately describes the shape of the measured r vg curve figure 1 d 6 figure 1 a schematic diagram showing the impurity position with respect to the graphene sheet and a pictorial representation of spatio temporal angular frequency w phonon oscillations over one unit cell b spatial inhomogeneity in the impurity potential left and the resulting

data blue lines show linear fits using equation 1 dashed pink curves are fits to the data found by including a short range scattering resistivity red curves result from the convolution fit to first approximation the carrier number density at a given gate voltage n vg can be modelled as the moving average convolution of equation 2 over a window of width dn which is the characteristic amplitude of the carrier density fluctuations in the graphene layer such a moving average is equivalent to the convolution of the vg function with a box function f nc of width dn see supplementary information si 1

resistivity around the dirac point also when 0 dn 4 nnp where nnp min e is the residual carrier density at the dirac neutrality point our model thus allows us to extend linear conductivity models 8 to a wider range of n values around and including the dirac point thereby accurately reproducing the full observed s vg and r vg dependences figure 1 c d to explain the observed dn vg and vg curves in more detail we now develop a semi classical k space simulations of the electron and hole dynamics graphene has a linear energy wavevector dispersion relation v k for the electrons and holes at the two inequivalent valleys k and k in reciprocal space this results in a constant speed of the charge carriers v 106 ms 1 these charge carriers undergo diffusive scattering transport which we describe using a semi classical boltzmann transport approach the influence of perturbations such as impurities and phonons on the scattering of electrons is calculated using the fermi golden rule for transition rates between states the electrons are initially assumed to obey a fermi dirac distribution f 0 k inter band transitions are neglected such that the valence band is assumed to be full throughout the time evolution when the gate voltage is positive i e when the chemical potential lies within the conduction band 8 the spatially homogeneous boltzmann transport equation 0 2 4 02 6 8 c e f 0 2 4 02 g 9 6 describes the evolution of the occupancy f t k of state k at time t the first term on the right hand side of equation 6 describes the acceleration of electrons under an applied electric field e and the collision term is given by the detailed balance equation f 0 2 4 02 g 9 j 4 4 c e 1 c e j 4 4 c e 1 c e 4 7 where sk k is the transition rate of carriers from a state of crystal momentum k to a new state with momentum k we solve equation 6 using a discontinuous galerkin dg numerical simulation 28 for the steady state distribution function f k we can then determine the mobility vd e for an applied electric field e and the resulting drift velocity m e 8 o e de 8 alternatively to find approximate analytical solutions to equation 3 we can assume a small shift in the initial distribution function f 0 k proportional to the ensemble momentum relaxation time m this results in the linearised boltzmann approximation 29 for the mobility which at zero temperature is related to the relaxation time at the chemical potential f via q o m o 9 we calculate the momentum relaxation time m k as the sum over all possible transition rates sk k modified by the deflection angle k k between the incoming and outgoing vectors a 4 j 4 4 4 s 1 cos v 4 4 w b j 4 4 s 1 cos v 4 4 wde c 10 where a is the area of graphene unit cell the effect of screening by the electron and hole gases is included by introducing a random phase approximation for the dielectric screening function 30 31 yd 1 mz 11 9 where 2 d e 2 2 0 rq is the unscreened coulomb potential in fourier space q is the static polarisation function and the reciprocal space variable q k k since the conduction band distribution function changes throughout the simulation the screening function should be carefully considered however the valence band distribution is constant throughout as the band is assumed to be full the polarisation function for screening by a full valence band is 31 ef g h e 12 for the conduction band maximum screening in the thomas fermi limit q 0 occurs at t 0 and is given by i o 0 0 j do e d e o 13 where d 2 v 2 is the density of states throughout the simulation the integral in equation 10 does not change due to conservation of charge since both equations 12 and 13 are independent of the evolution of the distribution function we define a time independent two regime screening function where thomas fermi screening is assumed for low energy scattering and the valence electron screening is assumed for high energy electrons 15 i e we set yd 1 g g for k a 1 l for k a 14 where rs e 2 4 0 r v

impurities from the graphene plane note that in this model we consider randomly distributed impurities and disregard any possible spatial correlation of charges below and above the graphene plane 32

area are characterised by the short range scattering potential u r u 0 h r r where h is the heaviside step function and r gives the spatial extent of the perturbation this potential represents any charge neutral defects within the lattice the rate of carrier scattering transitions due to such defects is j 4 4 dl dl b d s 2 u m 2 g d 1 e fv 4 4 4 o 4 o 4 17 where c r 2 is the effective cross section of defects with an areal density nsr although phonons are not expected to have a significant effect on the mobility of slg compared to that of the impurities 7 we include optical phonons in our simulation because for small impurity densities carriers can be accelerated to sufficiently high energies to emit an optical phonon before they are scattered by impurities we also consider the low temperature regime kbt and assume that the phonon occupation is n 0 such that only spontaneous emission occurs we use the optical phonon scattering rates calculated using density functional theory in refs 34 and 35 near the points of the reciprocal lattice the energy and coupling strength of both transverse and longitudinal optical phonons are reported to be o 165 mev and o 10 ev respectively 36 therefore we can combine the transition rates of the two modes to obtain a single overall optical scattering rate j 4 4 v w 3 bxy 3 4 o 4 o 4 nv 18 phonons at the k points cause intervalley scattering at a rate j 4 4 z w 4 bxy 4 s 1 cos v 4 4 w 4 o 4 o 4 nz 19 where k 124 mev and k 3 5 ev 36 11 we consider a residual charge density of electron hole puddles at the dirac point due to inhomogeneity in the impurity induced potential figure 1 b which limits the minimum conductivity this residual charge density was calculated in ref 15 assuming a random distribution of impurities here we assume that the transition from the residual charge dominated minimum carrier concentration to the linearly vg dependent concentration occurs when the gate induced charged density n vg v 0 is equal to the residual charge density nnp where v 0 is the position of the dirac point for all numerical simulations we apply an electric field e 104 v m 0 1 v drop across a 10 m long slg corresponding to a regime of low field mobility where is independent of the applied electric field strength for comparison we also calculate the mobility using the linearised boltzmann formalism equation 9 with the scattering time calculated using equation 10 in which the integrals are evaluated numerically the linearised boltzmann method is simpler but the dg method is more accurate and allows consideration of the form of the ensemble momentum distribution which we will show is important for small impurity densities where electrons can be accelerated to high energies far from thermal equilibrium figure 2 a shows the calculated dependence of mobility on n for n nnp we define the low carrier mobility regime as when the chemical potential is near the dirac point with increasing n we observe an initial increase of as it is dominated by impurity scattering for larger n short range scattering becomes dominant this results in a peak mobility between the two regimes figure 2 a the dependence of mobility on carrier concentration n is affected by the density of impurities n 0 and by their distance from the graphene dimp hence both n and the low carrier mobility n nnp depend on n 0 and dimp figure 2 b 12 figure 2 a mobility calculated using our dg model as a function of gate induced carrier density n beyond the minimum carrier density nnp vertical dashed line for varying short range scattering strengths the impurity density is n 0 0 6 1016 m 2 b mobility calculated as a function of impurity density n 0 for several stand off distances dimp dashed curves are calculated using the linearised boltzmann approximation using equation 6 the solid green curve shows the constant capacitance approximation from ref 15 where 20 e h c d final distribution of electron momentum calculated for a small impurity

of radius kf purple circle shows a linear shift of the fermi circle by kx ee f orange dashed circle represents the p phonon level and the orange dashed dotted circle represents the phonon level 13 we see that the mobility increases as the graphene impurity distance is increased furthermore we observe that for low impurity densities the mobility given by the dg simulations differs from that obtained from the linearised boltzmann calculations whereas the two methods give values that converge at higher impurity densities both the linearised model and the dg simulations assume that initially at t 0 the electron gas is in thermal equilibrium and obeys the fermi dirac distribution equation 9 assumes a linear shift in the momentum of the ensemble proportional to the ensemble relaxation rate f whereas the dg simulations include the time evolution of the momentum distribution described by the full boltzmann transport equation 6 therefore the discrepancy between the two methods seen at low impurity densities can be explained by comparing the steady state distribution functions figure 2 c shows the final distribution of electrons obtained for a small impurity density using the dg simulation we obtain similar results by monte carlo simulations 28 37 figure 2 d in both the dg and monte carlo simulations with increasing t we observe continuous spreading of the electron distribution in k space until the occupied k values become limited by inelastic phonon scattering at this point the distribution is significantly different from the approximation of a linearly shifted fermi dirac distribution function assumed in the derivation of equation 9 the effect of dimp on the electrical properties of graphene is summarised in figure 3 our calculations demonstrate that the linewidth of the r vg curves broadens with decreasing dimp figure 3 a which is accompanied by a decrease of carrier mobility due to enhanced charge scattering figure 3 b at small values of n and hence small impurity densities we observe discrepancy between the dg and linearised boltzmann calculations of compare figure 2 b and figure 3 b despite the discrepancy in n 0 we find that both methods yield a similar n n 0 profile in order to confirm these results we now compare our calculations to experimental measurements 14 figure 3 a fwhm n variation with impurity density n 0

graphene samples grown by cvd filled circles or exfoliated filled triangles the dashed lines are obtained from equation 9 the solid lines are obtained using the dg simulations 3 experimental results we apply our analysis to experimental results reported previously for 20 devices fabricated using exfoliated and cvd grown graphene and for heterostructures incorporating 2 d inse hbn or 0 d colloidal qds inorganic perovskites layers 38 40 we fit the measured s vg dependencies and determine values of and n see supplementary information si 1 2 in graphene devices impurities at a distance dimp from the 2 d plane act as scattering centres an 15 increase in mobility is observed with decreasing n figure 3 a b these measurements are in good agreement with the results of our dg simulations with dimp 2 nm we note that our fit figure 3 b uses n calculated from sfwhm rather than n 0 extracted from the gate voltage at which s vg smax by using our simple expression for the conductivity and assuming the universal minimum conductivity for pristine graphene min 4 e 2 h 22 and constant mobility with respect to carrier density we obtain a simple inverse power law for mobility which provides excellent agreement with experimental data from a range of devices see supplementary information si 2 hs 5 6 6 20 recently the decoration of graphene devices with other low dimensional materials such as 0 d colloidal pbs quantum dots 38 or cspbi 3 perovskite 39 and 2 d inse flakes 40 materials has been used to functionalise these devices e g for photon sensing 5 39 40 the properties of the graphene heterostructures are greatly affected by both the unintentional presence of charge impurities in the vicinity of graphene as described above by dimp and those deliberately introduced by the top layer dtop in graphene heterostructures figure 4 a which we model as a distribution of impurities at some effective distance deff we note that in surface decorated graphene devices the distance between the graphene plane and the top layer can be controlled for example by introducing a dielectric layer such as hbn thus providing a tool for tailoring the electrical properties the relationship between mobility and the gate voltage offset is 1 n 0 for most pristine devices 15 however for devices with high densities of correlated unipolar charges 32 33 or uncorrelated bipolar charges 41 spatial correlation between charges must be considered this is particularly important when the dopants are mobile and able to adopt low energy correlated configurations such effects were recently demonstrated for quantum dot decorated graphene 16 figure 4 a schematic diagram showing the position of impurities and surface charges due to 0 d structures e g perovskites and 2 d structures e g inse with respect to the graphene sheet b relationship between mobility and the fwhm n obtained using the dg simulations taking dimp 1 0 nm compared to data from multiple modified graphene samples data points for each sample type are labelled as shown in the inset legend and validated using monte carlo simulations 33 41 despite the different n 0 characteristics of decorated and pristine graphene remarkably we find that both types of device exhibit the universal scaling behaviour that we have identified figure 4 a all our surface decorated devices follow the trend given by our universal scaling model for pristine graphene with different impurity densities the experimental results for the inse perovskite and pbs decorated slg are best fitted by dg calculations when deff 1 nm therefore we find that the relationship between and n is consistent throughout all of the devices as can be expected from the analytical expression given in equation 17 with modifications to only the effective distance of the impurities 17 our model links together three key transport parameters of slg devices n 0 and n where n can also be used to calculate rmax and s vg see supplementary information si 3 remarkably this model can be used to extrapolate the whole r vg dependence from a single r vg rmax measurement and for a wide range of different graphene devices see figure 1 c d of particular interest is the applicability of our model to a wide variety of different graphene types and to different device structures and geometries consequently the model has the potential to both predict and explain the observed behaviour of newly emerging device concepts and graphene types recently the need for upscaling of graphene growth and device manufacturing has led to significant research focus on molecular beam epitaxial growth 42 liquid exfoliation of 2 d materials 43 and additive manufacturing 3 d printing of graphene devices 44 45 our preliminary results indicate that our model can be optimised and expanded to explain and predict the properties of 3 d printed graphene devices by accounting for flake to flake hopping of charges 4 conclusions we have developed a universal analytical convolution model of electron transport in graphene and graphene heterostructures supported by numerical time dependent analysis of the charge carrier distributions our model includes the effects of impurities and optical phonons on the observed charge transport properties of graphene devices we find that the properties of a wide range of devices from high quality graphene with low carrier density to graphene based heterostructures exhibit universal behaviour that can be accurately described with this model our calculations combine multiple parameters that affect charge transport in graphene and facilitate the design accurate ab initio prediction of key transport parameters and analysis of future electronic and opto electronic devices based on 2 d materials furthermore our results may be generalised to predict and improve the electrical behaviour of 2 d multilayers made by 18 3 d printing or from reduced graphene oxide which are promising candidates for the scalable high yield

university loughborough uk si 1 analytical modelling of single layer graphene and fitting of the experimental data efficient gating provided by the si sio 2 substrates allows easy measurement of the carrier concentration and mobility of graphene field effect transistors fets without requiring sophisticated equipment or an applied magnetic field the carrier concentration of graphene can be estimated using a parallel plate capacitance model where the bottom plate is a si substrate and top plate is the graphene layer then the capacitance of the graphene fet per unit area is c 0 0 d 115 f m 2 where d 300 nm is sio 2 layer thickness and 3 9 is its dielectric constant the parallel capacitance model of a graphene fet is based on the 2 assumption that all mobile charges are equally distributed between the si gate electrode and the graphene layer in this case the carrier number density in the graphene layer is s 1 where n 0 is the doping of the graphene when 0 e g the doping arising from the nearby charged impurities and vg is the applied gate voltage the doping level n 0 is found from the position of the minimum smin i e the maximum of the resistivity rmax in the s vg curve the linear relation defines the field effect mobility as fe s e n where ds and dn are typically measured from the positions of the maximum gradients in the s vg curve the mobility of charge carriers in the graphene is assumed to be independent of vg s 1 the two main assumptions introduced above namely the parallel plate capacitor carrier concentration equation s 1 and vg independent mobility lead to a simple linear approximation of s vg using the drude formula s 2 where nc vg is given by equation s 1 and the mobility is constant this approach provides good estimates for the values of n 0 and fe but does not explain several features of the experimental data such as i the sublinear s vg variation far from the dirac minimum conductivity point ii the finite conductivity smin 0 when the chemical potential coincides with the dirac point and iii the left right asymmetry of the s vg curve with respect to the s smin n vg n 0 point sublinear s vg variation has previously been explained as resulting from an interplay of short and long range scattering mechanisms short range scattering can be described by introducing an additional constant vg independent resistivity rs into

the dirac point n n 0 figure 1 c d has been widely considered s 1 s 2 s 5 graphene conductivity in the vicinity of the dirac point is strongly affected by many different phenomena such as quantum capacitance s 3 s 4 and temperature s 5 as a result the classical parallel plate capacitor model is not applicable near the dirac point and the carrier concentration never reaches zero because some electrons and holes are present in the graphene even when the fermi energy f is at the dirac point this effect can be described as spatial fluctuations of the local electrostatic potential along the graphene layer and resulting electron and hole puddles as both electrons and holes play equal roles in the graphene conductivity with no scattering on the borders between the n and p type graphene areas s 6 we define a minimum cumulative electrons and holes carrier concentration dn using experimental data the minimum carrier concentration dn is defined as a full width half maximum of the r n peak dnfwhm it can also be calculated by applying the drude conductivity formula at the dirac point so that nnp min e to expand this fit away from the dirac point the experimental data are fitted by a convolution of linear conductivity equation s 2 or linear conductivity with a short range scattering correction equation s 3 and a carrier distribution function f n box function for 0 for 67 s 4 we note that carrier distribution function can be also represented as i e 9 and can be written as 9 for 0 for s 5 therefore we obtain 4 9 0 1 2 3 for for s 6 from which we obtain the full gate voltage

applied to the experimental data is shown by the red curves in figures 1 c d of the main text we used dn as a fitting parameter and found that the best fit is obtained with dn equal to dnfwhm or 4 nnp

shown that 0 s 7 5 for most pristine graphene samples we can approximate max h 4 e 2 s 11 as shown in figure s 1 a given equation s 7 this results in 16 e h n see figure s 1 b for pristine samples we note that for surface modified devices the maximum conductivity is slightly larger as shown in figure s 2 a this can be due to the increased amount of residual charge as modelled by the smaller effective distance figures 3 b and 4 b of main text if we approximate max h 5 e 2 we find 20 e h n for modified graphene see figure s 2 b the simultaneous increase of mobility and impurity density has been previously explained using spatial correlation of charged impurities s 10 our results suggest that the characteristic carrier density fluctuation determined from the fwhm n of the r vg dependence can be used to estimate the mobility of a wide range of graphene devices in way that is strikingly similar to the phenomenological relation defined for impurity density i e c nimp s 2 figure s 1 a

graphically as the golden triangle shown in figure s 3 the dashed lines represent simple phenomenological relations between the four main parameters relevant to the conductivity of graphene the resistivity at the dirac point rnp the carrier mobility the doping level n 0 and the uncertainty of the carrier density n the carrier density uncertainty parameter n provides additional connections

circles corresponding to expressions 1 6 below 7 within the golden triangle the numbered circles along the sides of the triangles refer to expressions 1 6 below which relate the parameters at the
