hydrodynamic limit and propagation of chaos for brownian particles reflecting from a newtonian barrier submitted to the annals of applied probability hydrodynamic limit and propagation of chaos for brownian particles reflecting from a newtonian barrier by clayton l barnes technion israel institute of technology in 2001 frank knight constructed a stochastic process modeling the one dimensional interaction of two particles one being newtonian in the sense that it obeys newton s laws of motion and the other particle being brownian we construct a multi particle analog using skorohod map estimates in proving a propagation of chaos and char acterizing the hydrodynamic limit as the solution to a pde with free boundary condition this pde resembles the stefan problem but has a neumann type boundary condition stochastic methods are used to show existence and uniqueness for this free boundary problem 1 introduction 1 1 description of the model consider n brownian particles x n 1 t x n n t on the real line reflecting from the same side of a moving barrier y n t the moving barrier is massive in the sense that it is not brownian but obeys newton s laws of motion by this we mean the barrier is modeled to have momentum and that it experiences an impulse upon colliding with one of the brownian particles impulse is equivalent to change in momen tum and in newtonian physics is proportional to the change in velocity in this way the brownian particles drive the massive barrier by increasing or decreasing depending on sign its velocity we assume the brownian parti cles have an equal mass of n 1 so the total mass of the system remains at unity and we fix a constant k 0 the impulse constant which deter mines the strength of the brownian particles interaction with the massive barrier increasing k will give the brownian particles more ability to in crease the massive barrier s velocity if k 0 the brownian particles have the author is currently a zuckerman postdoctoral

influence on the barrier the brownian particles become independent re flecting brownian motions while the barrier will travel with constant speed if k 0 however the brownian particles are dependent this can be seen intuitively for in the event that one brownian particle happens to impart a large impulse to the massive barrier it influences the barrier s trajectory and alters the region where the other brownian particles are allowed to disperse themselves to formally describe the above scenario we begin by assuming the stan dard setting a filtered probability space f ft t 0 p supporting i i d ft adapted brownian motions b 1 b n and where ft satisfies the usual conditions fix a coefficient k 0 the impulse constant and an ini tial velocity v r for the massive particle consider continuous ft

which is our definition of the local time of x n i on y n that such a system of sdes exists with the above definition of local time is proved in proposition 2 10 we assume the initial condition y n 0

sample path realizations existence of a strong solution to this system is proved in proposition 2 10 a system x n 1 x n n y n v n satisfying 1 1 above will be called a system of brownian particles reflecting from a massive barrier with impulse coefficient k the processes x n 1 x n n are the brownian particles y n is the reflecting barrier with v n its velocity 1 2 free boundary problem in theorem 1 2 we characterize the hydro dynamic limit of the empirical process together with the random barrier the hydrodynamic limit is the solution to a free boundary problem given as a pair p t x y t both of which interact according to the pde below we think of p t x as the temperature at time space location t x and y t as an insulating barrier the heat is concentrated above the insulating barrier so p t is supported on y t we assume our initial condition 0 dx is the distribution of a random variable with finite qth moment for q 1 p t x t 1 2 2 p t x x 2 x y t p t x x 2 y t p t x x y t y t k 2 p s y s y 0 0 y 0 v r lim t 0 p t x dx 0 dx 1 2 here p t x x lim h 0 p t x h p t x h is the one sided derivative on the positive side this second condition is mathematically equivalent to conservation of heat so the function y t acts imsart aap ver 2014 10 16 file hydrolimit revision 3 imsart tex date january 31 2020 4 clayton l barnes as an insulating barrier informally one can see this by taking the time derivative of y t p t x dx and applying leibniz integral rule the factor of two in the second line cancels with the heat diffusion factor of one half the third condition says the insulating barrier has an acceleration proportional to its temperature the last condition should be interpretedwp 0 p t dx 0 as 0 where wp is the wasserstein kantorovich distance defined in subsection 1 3 and q p 1 q 6 2 p see remark 4 4 this odd conditions comes from theorem 3 20 the unique solution will be one in which the equalities above hold in the classical sense that is p t x is a differentiable function in its domain t x 0 t t x y t which is c 1 in time c 2 in space and y c 2 0 t r 1 3 main results theorem 1 1 there exists a unique classical solution to the free bound ary problem 1 2 for the hydrodynamic limit we consider the empirical measure n t 1 n n i 1 x n i t for fixed t 0 n t is a random variable with values in the space pp r for a time horizon t 0 n t t 0 t is

the third result is the propagation of chaos which means the depen dence of any finite collection of tagged particles disappears as the number of particles tends to infinity theorem 1 3 propagation of chaos assume for every n x n i 0 i i 1 n where i i n are i i d samples of a nonnegative integrable random variable fix positive integers i 1 ik then x n i 1 x n ik x i 1 x ik in distribution on c 0 t rk as n and where the limit consists of independent processes x i 1 x ik furthermore x ik are independent brownian motions reflecting from a deterministic function y that is x i 1 t y t m t bi 1 t x i 1 0 where y t v k em t for all t 0 t where m t sup 0 s t b i 1 s x i 1 0 y s and x i 1 d 0 dx the i are given so the processes have an initial condition which does not depend on n in the triangular array this ensures that after n max ik the initial conditions for the x n i 1 x n ik are all defined and unchanging with n like theorem 1 2 the proof of theorem 1 3 is in subsection 3 2 remark 1 4 for fairly general exchangeable particle systems prop agation of chaos is equivalent to weak convergence of the empirical mea sures to the limiting law p t of one particle in the space c 0 t p here x t d

mode of convergence with we consider imsart aap ver 2014 10 16 file hydrolimit revision 3 imsart tex date january 31 2020 6 clayton l barnes 1 4 organization of paper the paper is organized as follows subsection 1 5 contains a historical background for the origin of our model and on related hydrodynamic limits in section 2 we construct the processes x n i pathwise on any prob ability space supporting an infinite sequence of i i d brownian motions b 1 b 2 b n and the initial random variables x n i 0 for all i 1 n n n we do this by constructing a functional to which we ap ply pathwise to the n brownian motions b 1 b n in proposition 2 10 we show this pathwise construction gives a system of processes satisfying 1 1 such a method for reflected processes is called a skorohod map since skorohod used the method to construct a reflected brownian motion on the positive half line r 0 for instance if b t is a standard brownian motion and m t sup 0 s t max b s 0 then b t m t has the same distribution as x where dx db dl and l is the semimartingale local time of x at zero see 20 section 3 6 c and the original paper by skorohod 33 here m t would be the skorohod map which corresponds to reflected brownian motion in subsection 3 1 we introduce the lemmas and propositions used in the proofs of theorems 1 2 and 1 3 the proofs of these two theorems are con tained in subsection 3 2 we use the estimates derived in the second section to demonstrate almost sure convergence of the barrier y n to a unique de terministic function y in the form of a functional strong law of large numbers see propositions 3 4 and 3 3 here we introduce properties of the measure valued process n mentioned above in proposition 3 18 we prove uni form stochastic equicontinuity which is stronger than the typical stochastic equicontinuity necessary for tightness of processes in some metric space we conclude the paper with section 4 where we use our stochastic rep resentation to prove uniqueness of the free boundary problem described in subsection 1 2 1 5 background knight introduced the model 1 1 in the case of one brownian particle 24 he studied density of the final velocity of the inert particle y 1 later white 40 generalized knight s construction and stud ied several related processes this inspired a higher dimensional version of a reflected process whose velocity vector is proportional to the boundary local time and the stationary distribution of its position and velocity was studied by bass burdzy chen and hairer 2 historically the study of macroscopic behavior for systems of randomly interacting particles began in 1956 by kac 18 and continued with mck ean 26 in 1969 this was followed by fundamental contributions during the imsart aap ver 2014 10 16 file hydrolimit revision 3 imsart tex date january 31 2020 brownian particles reflecting from a newtonian barrier 7 1980 s by sznitman 35 36 tanaka 37 ga rtner 15 and many others the hydrodynamic limit of a system of interacting particles is sometimes referred to as the macroscopic behavior of the system or the asymptotic behavior of the empirical measures such a result is closely related to prop agation of chaos and the two are equivalent equivalent when the system of interacting particles satisfies an exchangability condition cf sznitman me le ard for a history of hydrodynamic limits see 16 and 6 systems of randomly interacting particles are probabilistic models originally moti vated by statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics particularly the theory explored by maxwell boltzmann and vlasov who describe the deterministic evolution of the distribution of gas a good review of interact ing particle systems of the mckean vlasov type is found in me le ard 27 for instance such systems are given by prescribing that the particles x n i exhibit mean field interaction that is the diffusivity and drift of each par ticle is a function of the particles location and the empirical energy profile n for i 1 n x n i t x n i 0 t 0 b x n i s n s ds t 0 x n i s n s dbi s 1 4 where b 1 bn are independent d dimensional brownian motions and b determine the drift and diffusivity respectively one usually assumes the initial conditions are i i d or an appropriate asymptotic con dition to allow the propagation of chaos to hold at the initial time for a fixed time t n t is in the space of probability measures on rd denoted by pp rd one places a metric on pp rd typically the metric of weak convergence for a finite time horizon t 0 n t t 0 t is a measure valued process with paths in c 0 t pp rd oelschla ger 29 characterized the large scale behavior of the system in 1 4 assuming b are sufficiently regular by demonstrating that n t converges in distri bution to p t in the space c 0 t pp rd here p t is the law of the process z t at time t where z t z 0 t 0 b z s p s ds t 0 z s p s db s 1 5 for a d dimensional brownian motion b and z 0 d limn x n 1 0 this matches intuition upon inspection of 1 4 the time varying distribution p s is the solution to the vlasov equation thus giving one example of the macroscopic behavior of randomly interacting particles converging to imsart aap ver 2014 10 16 file hydrolimit revision 3 imsart tex date january 31 2020 8 clayton l barnes a deterministic time varying distribution 27 furthermore the individual processes x n 1 converge to a process with time varying law p for other results on convergence of empirical processes see 38 where varadhan uses entropy methods to examine a spin system on a lattice when the mesh goes to zero entropy and relative entropy methods are general methods however these are not always feasible for instance see 6 where chen and fan study a system of particles reflecting from a separating in terface for an introductory reading on hydrodynamic limits see the book 23 where kipnis and landim present a self contained treatment of hy drodynamic limits via the study of the generalized exclusion process and the zero range process these processes are continuous time and discrete in space with spacial distance decreasing to zero other hydrodynamic limit results have biological motivations in neuron modeling see 30 7 and 17 chapter 4 3 hydrodynamic limits are related to the theory of partial differential equations since the empirical measure of the particles converge to a solution of a pde or free boundary problem in 5 chayes and swindle study the one dimensional model of hot random walkers which are emitted by a source and which annihilate cold particles which remain stationary when a brownian scaling is introduced the density of the hot particles to gether with the cold region converge to the solution of the stefan problem the stefan problem is a free boundary problem modeling the melting of ice next to a heat source the heat particles are killed upon reaching the ice boundary i e a dirichlet boundary condition is imposed at the ice barrier while the melting of this ice barrier is proportional to the flux of heat across it in this way the density of heat and the ice barrier interact producing the free boundary effect the hydrodynamic limit we study in this paper resembles that of the stefan problem but with some distinctive features see 1 2 in contrast with the stefan problem our barrier reflects the heat back into the domain rather than absorbing it and our barrier has an acceleration proportional to its temperature as opposed to its velocity being proportional to the heat flux there is a large variety of interacting particle systems giving rise to many different limiting behaviors see the above mentioned works of tanaka 37 sznitman 36 35 as well as skorohod 34 nadtochiy and shkolnikov 28 chen and fan 6 to mention some for related models of interacting particles with rank dependence see sarantsev 31 32 karatzas pal and shkolnikov 19 and cabezas et al who study out of equilibrium behavior of particles interacting through their ranks 4 we

properties of skorohod maps are used to demonstrate a hydrodynamic limit see section 2 by apply ing this method with a stochastic representation corollary 3 11 we prove existence and uniqueness of the free boundary problem without relying on existence and uniqueness theorems from the theory of pdes properties of the transition density for brownian motion reflected in a time varying do mains is a key ingredient for a stochastic representation of the pde with free boundary see 3 this is the first existence and uniqueness result for the free boundary problem we study as it seems not to be

consequently for almost every in the probability space every subsequence of n k has a cauchy subse quence in c 0 t pp wp because c 0 t pp wp is complete every subsequence of n k has a convergent subsequence since n k t al ready converges to the continuous p t along rationals every subsequence of n k has a further subsequence converging to p t therefore n k t converges to p t in c 0 t pp wp

pde with free boundary condition p t y t which is the solution of our hydrodynamic limit given by 1 2 if p y is a solution and p t represents the distribution of heat then the equation in theorem 1 2 is interpreted as saying the acceleration of the moving barrier y t is proportional to its temperature the hydrody namic limit already yields existence of such a solution in that statement of theorem 1 2 n y n converges in some sense to a solution of 1 2 here we show this is the only solution by demonstrating uniqueness of this pde with free boundary remark 4 1 for any solution p y of 1 2 make a substitution u t x p t x y t and see u y is a classical solution to u t x t 1 2 2 u t x x 2 y t u t x x when x 0 u t x x 2 y t u t x at x 0 y t k 2 u t 0 y 0 0 y 0 v r y c 0 t r lim t 0 u t x f x dx f

important role because if y exists then the solution to 1 2 has a stochastic representation given from corollary 3 10 we exploit this to show uniqueness imsart aap ver 2014 10 16 file hydrolimit revision 3 imsart tex date january 31 2020 brownian particles reflecting from a newtonian barrier 41 proof theorem 1 2 gives existence to show uniqueness we will prove the corresponding barriers y 1 y 2 of any two solutions are in fact equal as sume that p 1 t y 1 t p 2 t y 2 t are pairs solving the pde with the given initial conditions following corollary 3 10 above we know that the transition density pi t x of brownian motion reflecting from yi satisfies the pde pi t 1 2 ypi y yi t pi y 2 y i t pi y yi t lim t 0 pi t y dy f y dy lp r p 1 4 2 remark 4 4 given a c 2 function y solving classical solution to the above pde one sees from propositions 3 8 and 3 7 that p t x is density of brownian motion reflecting from y with initial condition d f dx for fixed y there is a unique such p t x see friedman 14 th 15 ch 2 consequently the second condition in 4 2 is interpreted as convergence of the density of brownian motion reflecting above y to its value at time zero from an analysis perspective we have wp f x dx p t x dx 0 as t 0 which can easily be gathered from propositions 3 8 and 3 7 in particular once we show this solution is unique the stochastic representation shows y t p t x dx 1 and y t xpp t x dx for all t 0 t without loss of generality we assume f y dy 1 let f ft t 0 p be a probability space supporting an ft adapted brownian motion b t and an independent random

0 t for some c 1 as long as 0 t t 2 k as a result y 1 y 2 0 t 0 for all t 0 2 k in other words the barriers y 1 and y 2 are identical up until this fixed positive time repeating this argument shows that y 1 and y 2 are identical across the entire interval 0 t that is there is a unique boundary y associated to any pair p y solving 1 2 fixing y uniqueness of p follows as a special case of the
