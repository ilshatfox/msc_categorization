dimensional manifolds siebenmann s iconic 1965 dissertation sie 65 provided necessary and sufficient conditions for an open manifold mm m 6 to be compactifiable by addition of a manifold boundary his theorem extends easily to cases where mm is noncompact with compact boundary however when mm is noncompact the situation is more complicated the goal becomes a completion of mm ie a compact manifold m m containing a compactum a mm such that m m a mm siebenmann did some initial work on this topic and o brien o b 83 extended that work to an important special case but until now a complete characterization had yet to emerge here we provide such a characterization our second main theorem involves z compactifications an important open question asks whether a well known set of conditions laid out by chapman and siebenmann cs 76 guarantee z compactifiability for a manifold mm we cannot answer that question but we do show that those conditions are satisfied if and only if mm 0 1 is z compactifiable a key ingredient in our proof is the above manifold completion theorem an application that partly explains our current interest in that topic and also illustrates the utility of the 1 condition found in that theorem 1 introduction this paper is about nice compactifications of high dimensional manifolds the simplest of these compactification is the addition of a boundary to an open manifold that was the topic of siebenmann s famous 1965 dissertation sie 65 the main re sult of which can easily be extended to include noncompact manifolds with compact boundaries when mm has noncompact boundary one may ask for a compactifi cation m m that completes mm that is a more delicate problem siebenmann addressed a very special case in his dissertation before o brien o b 83 characterized completable n manifolds in the case where mm and mm are both 1 ended since completable manifolds can have infinitely many non isolated ends o brien s the orem does not imply a full characterization of completable n manifolds we obtain such a characterization here thereby completing an unfinished chapter in the study of noncompact manifolds date november 3 2018 key words and

http arxiv org abs 1712 05995 v 2 2 shijie gu and craig r guilbault a second type of compactification considered here is the z compactification these are similar to the compactifications discussed above in fact those are special cases but z compactifications are more flexible for example a z boundary for an open manifold need not be a manifold and a manifold that admits no completion can ad mit a z compactification these compactifications have proven to be useful in both geometric group theory and manifold topology for example in attacks on the borel and novikov conjectures a major open problem in our minds is a characterization of z compactifiable manifolds a set of necessary conditions was identified by chap man and siebenmann cs 76 and it is hoped that those conditions are sufficient we prove what might be viewed the next best thing if mm satisfies the chapman siebenmann conditions and m 6 4 then mm 0 1 is z compactifiable we do this by proving that mm 0 1 is completable an application that partly explains the renewed interest in manifold completions and also illustrates the usefulness of the conditions found in the manifold completion theorem 1 1 the manifold completion theorem an m manifold mm with possibly empty boundary is completable if there exists a compact manifold m m and a com pactum c m m such that m m c is homeomorphic to mm in this case m m is called a manifold completion of mm a primary goal of this paper is the following characterization theorem for m 6 definitions will be provided subsequently theorem 1 1 manifold completion theorem an m manifold mm m 6 is completable if and only if a mm is inward tame b mm is peripherally 1 stable at infinity c m m lim k 0 1 n n a clean neighborhood of infinity is zero and d m m lim 1 wh 1 n n a clean neighborhood of infinity is zero together conditions a and c ensure that nice neighborhoods of infinity have finite homotopy type while condition d allows one to upgrade certain naturally arising homotopy equivalences to simple homotopy equivalences these conditions have arisen in other contexts such as sie 65 and cs 76 condition b can be thought of as 1 stability rel boundary it seems unique to the situation at hand in the special case where mm is 1 ended and n 0 n 1 is a cofinal sequence of nice connected neighborhoods of infinity it demands that each sequence 1 mni ni 1 1 mni ni 2 1 mni ni 3 be stable where mni denotes m m ni this reduces to ordinary 1 stability when mm is compact a complete discussion of this condition can be found in 4 remark 1 several comments are in order 1 dimensions 5 are discussed briefly in 2 our main focus is m 6 2 if mm is compact and mm is inward tame then mm has finitely many ends see 5 so the ends are isolated and disjoint from mm in that case theorem compactifications of manifolds with boundary 3 1 1 reduces to siebenmann s dissertation sie 65 as such theorem 1 1 can be viewed as a generalization of sie 65 3 the special case of the manifold completion theorem where mm and mm are 1 ended was proved by o brien o b 83 that is where peripheral 1 stability was first defined but since candidates for completion can be infinite ended e g let c sm 1 be a cantor set and mm bm c the general theorem is not a corollary in the process of generalizing o b 83 we simplify the proof presented there and correct an error in the formulation of condition c we also exhibit some interesting examples which answer a question posed by o brien about a possible weakening condition b 4 if condition b is removed from theorem 1 1 one arrives at chapman and siebenmann s conditions for characterizing z compactifiable hilbert cube man ifolds cs 76 a z compactification theorem for finite dimensional manifolds is the subject of the second main result of this paper we will describe that theorem and the necessary definitions now 1 2 the stable z compactification theorem for manifolds to extend the idea of a completion to hilbert cube manifolds chapman and siebenmann introduced the notion of a z compactification a compactification x x z of a space x is a z compactification if there is a homotopy h x 0 1 x such that h 0 idx and ht x x for all t 0 subsequently this notion has been fruitfully applied to more general spaces notably finite dimensional manifolds and complexes see for example bm 91 cp 95 fw 95 ag 99 and fl 05 a completion of of a finite dimensional manifold is a z compactification but a z compactification need not be a completion in fact a manifold that allows no completion can still admit a z compactification the exotic universal covers constructed by mike davis are some of the most striking examples just apply adg 97 such manifolds must satisfy conditions a c and d but the converse remains open question does every finite dimensional manifold that satisfies conditions a c and d of theorem 1 1 admit a z compactification this question was posed more generally in cs 76 for locally compact anrs but in gui 01 a 2 dimensional polyhedral counterexample was constructed the manifold version remains open in this paper we prove a best possible stabilization theorem for manifolds theorem 1 2 stable z compactification theorem for manifolds an m manifold mm m 5 satisfies conditions a c and d of theorem 1 1 if an only if mm 0 1 admits a z compactification in fact mm 0 1 is completable if and only if mm satisfies those conditions remark 2 in fer 00 ferry showed that if a locally finite k dimensional polyhe dron x satisfies conditions a c and d then x 0 1 2 k 5 is z compactifiable 4 shijie gu and craig r guilbault theorem 1 1 can be viewed as a sharpening of ferry s theorem in cases where x is a manifold 1 3 outline of this paper the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in 2 we review the status of theorem 1 1 in dimensions 6 in 3 we fix some terminology and notation then in 4 7 we carefully discuss each of the four conditions present in theorem 1 1 in 9 10 we prove theorem 1 1 and in 11 we prove theorem 1 2 in 12 we provide a counterexample to a question posed in o b 83 about a possible relaxation of condition b and in 13 we provide the proof of a technical lemma that was postponed until the end of the paper 2 manifold completions in dimensions 6 the manifold completion theorem is true in dimensions 3 but much simpler versions are possible in those dimensions for example tucker tuc 74 showed that a 3 manifold can be completed if and only if each component of each clean neighborhood of infinity has finitely generated fundamental group a condition that is implied by inward tameness alone since we have been unable to find the optimal 2 dimensional completion theorem in the literature we take this opportunity to provide such a theorem if m 2 has finitely generated first homology e g if m 2 is inward tame then by classical work see ker 23 and ric 63 int m 2 2 p where 2 is a closed surface and p is a finite set of points therefore m 2 contains a compact codimension 1 submanifold c such that each of the the components ni k i 1 of m 2 c is a noncompact manifold whose frontier is a circle onto which it deformation retracts complete the ni individually as follows i if ni contains no portion of m 2 add a circle at infinity and ii if ni contains components of m 2 perform the kere kja rto freudenthal end point compactification to ni classification 9 26 of cks 12 applied to each ni of type ii ensures that the result is a manifold completion of m 2 as a consequence we have the following theorem 2 1 a connected 2 manifold m 2 is completable if and only if h 1 m 2 is finitely generated in particular theorem 1 1 is valid when n 2 in dimension 5 our proof of theorem 1 1 goes through verbatim provided it is always possible to work in neighborhoods of infinity with boundaries in which freed man s 4 dimensional disk embedding theorem holds that issue is discussed in qui 82 and fq 90 11 9 in the less general setting of siebenmann s thesis but the issues here are the same in the language of fq 90 theorem 1 1 holds provided con dition b is strengthened to require the existence of arbitrarily small neighborhoods of infinity with stable peripheral pro 1 groups that are good a caveat is that whenever fre 82 is applied conclusions are topological rather than pl or smooth compactifications of manifolds with boundary 5 remarkably siebenmann s thesis fails in dimension 4 see wei 87 and ks 88 counterexamples to his theorem are of course counterexamples to theorem 1 1 as well as for low dimensional versions of theorem 1 2 if m 3 and mm satisfies con dition a then mm is completable hence z compactifiable so mm 0 1 is com pletable and z compactifiable if m 4 then m 4 0 1 is a 5 manifold which see 11 satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 1 whether that leads to a completion de pends on 4 dimensional issues in particular the goodness of the stable peripheral fundamental groups of the ends of m 4 0 1 those groups are determined by but are not the same as the fundamental groups at the ends of m 4 if desired a precise group theoretic condition can be formulated from proposition 11 1 and gui 07 3 conventions notation and terminology for convenience all manifolds are assumed to be piecewise linear pl that as sumption is particularly useful for the topic at hand since numerous instances of smoothing corners would be required in the smooth category an issue that is cov ered nicely in o b 83 with proper attention to such details analogous theorems can be obtained in the smooth or topological category unless stated otherwise an m manifoldmm is permitted to have a boundary denoted mm we denote the man ifold interior by intmm for a mm the point set interior will be denoted intmm a and the frontier by frmm a or for conciseness intm a and the frontier by frm a a closed manifold is a compact boundaryless manifold while an open manifold is a non compact boundaryless manifold for q m a q dimensional submanifold qq mm is properly embedded if it is a closed subset of mm and qq mm qq it is locally flat if each p intqq has a neighborhood pair homeomorphic to rm rq and each p qq has a neighborhood pair homeomorphic to rm r q by this definition the only properly embedded codimension 0 submanifolds of mm are unions of its connected components a more useful type of codimension 0 submanifold is the following a codimension 0 subman ifold qm mm is clean if it is a closed subset of mm and frm q m is a properly embedded locally flat hence bicollared m 1 submanifold of mm in that case mm qm is also clean and frm q m is a clean codimension 0 submanifold of both qm and mm qm when the dimension of a manifold or submanifold is clear we sometimes omit the superscript for example denoting a clean codimension 0 submanifold by q similarly when the ambient space is clear we denote point set interiors and frontiers by inta and fra for any codimension 0 clean submanifold q mm let mq denote q m m alternatively mq q int frq similarly we will let intm q denote q intm m alternatively intm q q m m 6 shijie gu and craig r guilbault 4 ends pro 1 and the peripheral 1 stability condition 4 1 neighborhoods of infinity partial neighborhoods of infinity and ends let mm be a connected manifold a clean neighborhood of infinity in mm is a clean codimension 0 submanifold n mm for which mm n is compact equivalently a clean neighborhood of infinity is a set of the form mm c where c is a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold of mm a clean compact exhaustion of mm is a sequence ci i 1 of clean compact connected codimension 0 submanifolds with ci intm ci 1 and ci m m by letting ni mm ci we obtain the corresponding cofinal sequence of clean neighborhoods of infinity each such ni has finitely many components n j i ki j 1 by enlarging ci to include all of the compact components of ni we can arrange that each n j i is noncompact then by drilling out regular neighborhoods of arcs connecting the various components of each frm n j i further enlarging ci we can also arrange that each frm n j i is connected a clean ni with these latter two properties is called a 0 neighborhood of infinity most constructions in this paper will begin with a clean compact exhaustion of mm with a corresponding cofinal sequence of clean 0 neighborhoods of infinity assuming the above arrangement an end of mm is determined by a nested sequence nkii i 1 of components of the ni each component is called a neighborhood of more generally any subset ofmm that contains one of the nkii is a neighborhood of and any nested sequence wj j 1 of connected neighborhoods of for which wj also determines the end a more thorough discussion of ends can be found in gui 16 here we will abuse notation slightly by writing n ki i i 1 keeping in mind that a sequence representing is not unique at times we will have need to discuss components n j of a neighborhood of infinity n without reference to a specific end of mm in that situation we will refer to the n j as a partial neighborhoods of infinity for mm partial 0 neighborhoods if n is a 0 neighborhood of infinity clearly every noncompact clean connected codimension 0 submanifold of mm with compact frontier is a partial neighborhood of infinity with respect to an appropriately chosen compact c if its frontier is connected it is a partial 0 neighborhood of infinity 4 2 the fundamental group of an end for each end of mm we will define the fundamental group at by using inverse sequences two inverse sequences of groups a 0 1 a 1 2 a 3 3 and b 0 1 b 1 2 b 3 3 are pro isomorphic if they contain subsequences that fit into a commutative diagram of the form 4 1 gi 0 i 0 1 i 1 gi 1 i 1 1 i 2 gi 2 i 2 1 i 3 gi 3 hj 0 j 0 1 j 1 hj 1 j 1 1 j 2 hj 2 j 2 1 j 3 compactifications of manifolds with boundary 7 where the connecting homomorphisms in the subsequences are as always compo sitions of the original maps an inverse sequence is stable if it is pro isomorphic to a constant sequence c id c id c id clearly an inverse sequence is pro isomorphic to each of its subsequences it is stable if and only if it contains a subsequence for which the images stabilize in the following manner 4 2 g 0 1 g 1 2 g 2 3 g 3 im 1 im 2 im 3 where all unlabeled homomorphisms are restrictions or inclusions here we have sim plified notation by relabelling the entries in the subsequence with integer subscripts given an end n ki i i 1 choose a ray r 1 mm such that r i n ki i for each integer i 0 and form the inverse sequence 4 3 1 nk 11 r 1 2 1 nk 22 r 2 3 1 nk 33 r 3 4 where each i is an inclusion induced homomorphism composed with the change of basepoint isomorphism induced by the path r i 1 i we refer to r as the base ray and the sequence 4 3 as a representative of the fundamental group at based at r denoted pro 1 r any similarly obtained representation e g by choosing a different sequence of neighborhoods of using the same base ray can be seen to be pro isomorphic we say the fundamental group at is stable if 4 3 is a stable sequence a key observation from the theory of ends is that stability of pro 1 r depends on neither the choice of neighborhoods nor that of the base ray see gui 16 or geo 08 4 3 relative connectedness relative 1 stability and the peripheral 1 stability condition let q be a manifold and a q we say that q is a connected at infinity if q contains arbitrarily small neighborhoods of infinity v for which a v is connected example 1 if p is a compact manifold with connected boundary x p is a closed set and q p x then q has one end for each component of x but q is q connected at infinity more generally if b is a clean connected codimension 0 manifold neighborhood of x in p and a b x then q is a connected at infinity the following lemma is straightforward lemma 4 1 let q be a noncompact manifold and a a clean codimension 0 subman ifold of q then q is a connected at infinity if and only if q a is 1 ended if a q and q is a connected at infinity let vi be a cofinal sequence of clean neighborhoods of infinity for which each a vi is connected choose a ray 8 shijie gu and craig r guilbault r 1 intq such that r i vi for each i 0 and form the inverse sequence 4 4 1 a v 1 r 1 2 1 a v 2 r 2 3 1 a v 3 r 3 4 where bonding homomorphisms are obtained as in 4 3 we say q is a 1 stable at infinity if 4 4 is stable independence of this property from the choices of vi and r follows from the traditional theory of ends by applying lemmas 4 1 and 4 2 lemma 4 2 let q be a noncompact manifold and a a clean codimension 0 subman ifold of q for which q is a connected at infinity then for any cofinal sequence of clean neighborhoods of infinity vi and ray r 1 q as described above the sequence 4 4 is pro isomorphic to any sequence representing pro 1 q a r proof it suffices to find a single cofinal sequence of connected neighborhoods of in finity ni in q a for which the corresponding representation of pro 1 q a r is pro isomorpic to 4 4 toward that end for each i let c 1 c 2 be a nested se quence of relative regular neighborhoods of a inq such that ci a by cleanness of the vi each ci can be chosen so that ci vi is a clean codimension 0 submanifold of q which deformation retracts onto a vi then ni ci vi a is a clean neighborhood of infinity in q a and ni ci vi is a homotopy equivalence for each i there is a canonical isomorphism i 1 a vi r i 1 ni r i which is the composition 1 a vi r i 1 ci vi r i 1 ni r i these isomorphisms fit into a commuting diagram 1 a v 1 r 1 2 1 a v 2 r 2 3 1 a v 3 r 3 4 1 2 3 1 n 1 r 1 2 1 n 2 r 2 3 1 n 3 r 3 4 completing the proof remark 3 in the above discussion we allow for the possibility that a in that case a connectedness at infinity reduces to 1 endedness and a 1 stability to ordinary 1 stability at that end definition 4 3 let mm be a manifold and an end of mm 1 mm is peripherally locally connected at infinity if it contains arbitrarily small 0 neighborhoods of infinity n with the property that each component n j is mn j connected at infinity 2 mm is peripherally locally connected at if has arbitrarily small 0 neighbor hoods p that are mp connected at infinity an n with the property described in condition 1 will be called a strong 0 neigh borhood of infinity for mm and a p with the property described in condition 2 will be called a strong 0 neighborhood of more generally any connected partial 0 neighborhood of infinity q that is mq connected at infinity will be called a strong partial 0 neighborhood of infinity compactifications of manifolds with boundary 9 lemma 4 4 mm is peripherally locally connected at infinity iff mm is peripherally locally connected at each of its ends proof clearly the initial condition implies the latter for the converse let n be an arbitrary neighborhood of infinity in mm and for each end let p be a 0 neighbor hoods of contained in n which is mp connected at infinity by compactness of the freudenthal boundary of mm there is a finite subcollection p k n k 1 that covers the end of mm in other words c mm n k 1 p k is compact if the p k are pairwise disjoint we are finished just let n nk 1 p k if not adjust the p k within n so they are in general position with respect to one another then let qj s j 1 be the set of components of nk 1 p k and note that each qj is a mqj connected partial 0 neighborhood of infinity remark 4 in the next section we show that every inward tame manifold mm is peripherally locally connected at infinity as a consequence that condition plays less prominent role than the next definition definition 4 5 let mm be a manifold and an end of mm 1 mm is peripherally 1 stable at infinity if contains arbitrarily small strong 0 neighborhoods of infinity n with the property that each component n j is mn j 1 stable at infinity 2 mm is peripherally 1 stable at if has arbitrarily small strong 0 neighbor hoods p that are mp 1 stable at infinity it is easy to see that peripheral 1 stability at infinity implies peripheral 1 stability at each end and when mm is finite ended peripheral 1 stability at each end implies peripheral 1 stability at infinity a argument could be made for defining peripheral 1 stability at infinity to mean peripherally 1 stability at each end for us that point is moot in the presence of inward tameness the two alternatives are equivalent lemma 4 6 an inward tame manifold mm is peripherally 1 stable at infinity if and only if it is peripherally 1 stable at each of its ends proof of this lemma is technical and not central to the main argument for that reason we save the proof for later see 13 although it is not needed here it would be interesting to know whether lemma 4 6 holds without the assumption of inward tameness 5 finite domination and inward tameness a topological space p is finitely dominated if there exists a finite polyhedron k and maps u p k and d k p such that d u idp if choices can be made so both d u idp and u d idk i e p k we say p has finite homotopy type for simplicity we will restrict our attention to cases where p is a locally finite polyhedron a class that contains the pl manifolds submanifolds and subspaces considered here 10 shijie gu and craig r guilbault lemma 5 1 let mm be a manifold and a m then mm is finitely dominated resp has finite homotopy type if and only if mm a is finitely dominated resp has finite homotopy type proof mm a mm is a homotopy equivalence and these properties are homotopy invariants lemma 5 2 a locally finite polyhedron p is finitely dominated if and only if there exists a homotopy h p 0 1 p such that h 0 idp and h 1 p is compact proof assuming a finite domination as described above the homotopy between idp and d u has the desired property for the converse let k be a compact polyhedral neighborhood of h 1 p u k p and d h 1 p k a locally finite polyhedron p is inward tame if it contains arbitrarily small polyhe dral neighborhoods of infinity that are finitely dominated equivalently p contains a cofinal sequence ni of closed polyhedral neighborhoods of infinity each admitting a taming homotopy h ni 0 1 ni that pulls ni into a compact subset of itself by an application of the homotopy extension property similar to gm 18 lemma 3 4 we can require taming homotopies to be fixed on frni from there it is easy to see that in an inward tame polyhedron every closed neighborhood of infinity admits a taming homotopy 1 lemma 5 3 let mm be a manifold and a a clean codimension 0 submanifold of mm if mm is inward tame then so is mm a proof for an arbitrarily small clean neighborhood of infinity n in mm let h be a taming homotopy that fixes frn thenh extends via the identity to a homotopy that pulls a n into a compact subset of itself so a n is finitely dominated arguing as in lemma 4 2 mm a has arbitrarily small clean neighborhoods of infinity homotopy equivalent to such an a n remark 5 important cases of lemma 5 3 are when a mm and when v is a clean neighborhood of infinity or a component of one and a mv notice that lemma 5 3 is valid when mm is compact and h is the empty map a finitely dominated space has finitely generated homology from which it can be shown that an inward tame manifold with compact boundary is finite ended see gt 03 prop 3 1 that conclusion fails for manifolds with noncompact boundary see item 3 of remark 1 the following variation is crucial to this paper proposition 5 4 if a noncompact connected manifold mm and its boundary each have finitely generated homology then mm has finitely many ends more specifically the number of ends of mm is bounded above by dimhm 1 m m mm z 2 1 proof let c be a clean connected compact codimension 0 submanifold of mm with the property that n mm c is a 0 neighborhood of infinity and let n j k j 1 1 for a discussion of tameness terminology and its variants see gui 16 3 5 5 compactifications of manifolds with boundary 11 be the collection of connected components of nn it suffices to show that k dimhm 1 m m mm z 2 1 for the remainder of this proof and only this proof all homology is with z 2 coefficients note that c is the union of clean codimension 0 submanifolds mc and frc which intersect in their common boundary frc so by a generalized version of poincare duality hat 02 th 3 43 and the universal coefficients theorem for all i we have 5 1 hi c mc hm i c frc claim 1 dimhm 1 c mc k 1 by the long exact sequence for the pair c frc we have h 1 c frc h 0 frc h 0 c q q z 2 k 1 0 so the claim follows from identity 5 1 claim 2 rankhm 1 n mn k this claim follows from the long exact sequence for the triple n n mn hm n n hm 1 n mn hm 1 n mn q q 0 z 2 k where triviality of hm n n is due to the noncompactness of all components of n and the middle equality is from excision the relative mayer vietoris theorem for pairs hat 02 2 2 applied to mm mm expressed as c n mc mn contains 5 2 hm 1 frc frc hm 1 c mc hm 1 n mn hm 1 m m mm from which we can deduce dim hm 1 c mc hm 1 n mn dimhm 1 frc frc dimhm 1 m m mm since hm 1 frc frc z 2 k from excision then by claims 1 and 2 we have k 1 k k dimhm 1 m m mm so k dimhm 1 m m mm 1 corollary 5 5 if mm is inward tame then mm is peripherally locally connected at infinity 12 shijie gu and craig r guilbault proof by lemma 4 1 it suffices to show that each compact codimension 0 clean submanifold d mm is contained in a compact codimension 0 clean submanifold c mm so that if n mm c then each component n j of n has the property that n j mm is 1 ended since mm is inward tame each of its clean neighborhoods of infinity is finitely dom inated so mm d has finitely many components each of which is finitely dominated let p l be one of those components then frp l is a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold of d whose interior is the boundary of p l mm since int frp l and p l mm each have finitely generated homology p l mm is finitely dominated then by proposition 5 4 p l mm has finitely many ends choose a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold kl of p l mm that intersects int frp l nontrivially and has exactly one unbounded complementary component in p l mm for each of those ends after doing this for each of the component p l of mm d let c d kl 6 finite homotopy type and the obstruction finitely generated projective left modules s and t are stably equivalent if there exist finitely generated free modules f 1 and f 2 such that s f 1 t f 2 under the operation of direct sum the stable equivalence classes of finitely generated projective modules form a group k 0 the reduced projective class group of in wal 65 wall associated to each path connected finitely dominated space p a well defined p k 0 z 1 p which is trivial if and only if p has finite homotopy type here z 1 p denotes the integral group ring corresponding to 1 p in the literature k 0 z g is sometimes abbreviated to k 0 g as one of the necessary and sufficient conditions for completability of a 1 ended inward tame open manifold mm m 5 with stable pro 1 siebenmann defined the end obstruction m m to be up to sign the finiteness obstruction n of an arbitrary clean neighborhood of infinity n whose fundamental group matches the stable pro 1 m m 2 in cases wheremm is multi ended or has non stable pro 1 or both a more general definition of m m introduced in cs 76 is required its definition employs several ideas from sie 65 6 first note that there is a covariant functor k 0 from groups to abelian groups taking g to k 0 z g which may be composed with the 1 functor to get a functor from path connected spaces to abelian groups here we use an observation by siebenmann allowing base points to be ignored next extend the functor and the finiteness obstruction to non path connected p abusing notation slightly by letting k 0 z 1 p k 0 z 1 p j 2 the main theorem of o b 83 incorrectly uses mm the finiteness obstruction of the entire manifold mm in place of mm the mistake is an erroneous application of siebenmann s sum theorem to conclude that triviality of mm implies triviality of n for each clean neigh borhood of infinity n siebenmann sie 65 correctly used the sum theorem to show that in the case of stable pro 1 it is enough to check the obstruction once for a well chosen clean neigh borhood of infinity he denoted that obstruction in our situation and o brien s such a simplification is not possible we use the subscripted to help distinguish the general situation from siebenmann s special case compactifications of manifolds with boundary 13 where p j is the set of path components of p and letting p p 1 p k recalling that p is finitely dominated and hence has finitely many components each finitely dominated now for an inward tame locally finite polyhedron p or more generally locally com pact anr let nj be a nested cofinal sequence of closed polyhedral neighborhoods of infinity and define p n 1 n 2 n 3 lim k 0 z 1 ni the bonding maps of the target inverse sequence k 0 z 1 n 1 k 0 z 1 n 2 k 0 z 1 n 3 are induced by inclusion with the sum theorem for finiteness obstructions sie 65 th 6 5 assuring consistency clearly p vanishes if and only if each ni has finite homotopy type by another application of the sum theorem this happens if and only if every closed polyhedral neighborhood of infinity has finite homotopy type remark 6 alternatively we could define p to lie in the inverse limit of the inverse system corresponding to all closed polyhedral neighborhoods of infinity par tially ordered by inclusion these inverse limits are isomorphic and in either case the combination of conditions a and c of theorem 1 1 is equivalent to the require ment that all clean neighborhoods of infinity have finite homotopy type a property referred to as absolute inward tameness in gui 16 we close this section with an observation that builds upon lemma 5 3 both play key roles in the proof of theorem 1 1 lemma 6 1 let mm be a manifold and a a clean codimension 0 submanifold of mm if mm is inward tame and m m vanishes then mm a is inward tame and m m a also vanishes proof lemma 5 3 assures us that if mm is inward tame then so too is mm a the latter ensures that m m a is defined arguing as we did in the proof of lemma 5 3 mm a contains arbitrarily small neighborhoods of infinity which are homotopy equivalent to a n where n is a clean neighborhood of infinity in mm if m m 0 then n has finite homotopy type and since a n a n n where a n is a compact m 1 manifold then a n has finite homotopy type by a direct argument or easy application of the sum theorem for the finiteness obstruction the vanishing of m m a then follows from the above discussion 7 the obstruction the obstruction in condition d of theorem 1 1 was first defined in cs 76 and applied to hilbert cube manifolds the role it plays here is similar it lies in the derived limit of an inverse sequence of whitehead groups for a more detailed discussion the reader should see cs 76 14 shijie gu and craig r guilbault c 1 w 1 w 2 c 2 c 3 figure 1 decomposition of mm into wi i 1 the derived limit of an inverse sequence g 0 1 g 1 2 g 2 3 of abelian groups is

mm contains a cofinal sequence ni of clean neighborhoods of infinity with the property that each inclusion frni ni is a homotopy equivalence 3 let wi ni ni 1 and note that frni wi is a homotopy equivalence see figure 1 since frni and wi are finite polyhedra the inclusion determines a whitehead torsion wi frni wh 1 frni see coh 73 as in the previous section we must allow for non connected frni so we define wh 1 frni wh 1 frn j i where frn j i is the finite set of components of frni and wi frni w 1 i frn 1 i w ki frn k i 3 a manifold admitting such sequence of neighborhoods of infinity is called pseudo collarable see gui 00 gt 03 and gt 06 for discussion of that topic compactifications of manifolds with boundary 15 these groups fit into and inverse sequence of abelian groups wh 1 n 1 wh 1 n 2 wh 1 n 3 where the bonding homomorphisms are induced by inclusions to match cs 76 we have substituted 1 ni for the canonically equivalent 1 frni let i wi frni wh 1 ni then m m 1 2 3 lim 1 wh 1 ni where 1 2 3 is the coset containing 1 2 3 if m m is trivial it is possible to adjust the choices of the ni so that each inclusion frni wi has trivial torsion and hence is a simple homotopy equivalence roughly speaking the adjustment involves lending and borrowing torsion to and from immediate neighbors of the wi the procedure is as described in cs 76 6 except that a splitting theorem for finite dimensional manifolds see o b 83 p 318 replaces cs 76 lemma 6 1 the reader is warned that the procedure described in o b 83 4 is flawed we recommend cs 76 8 geometric characterization of completable manifolds and a review of h and s cobordisms the following geometric characterization of completable manifolds which has analogs in tuc 74 and o b 83 paves the way for the proof of theorem 1 1 it leads naturally to the consideration of h and s cobordisms which we will briefly review for later use lemma 8 1 geometric characterization of completable manifolds a non compact manifold with boundary mm is completable iff mm i 1 ci where for all i i ci is a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold of m m ii ci intci 1 and iii if wi denotes ci 1 ci then wi frci frci 0 1 frci 0 proof for the forward implication suppose m m is a compact manifold a is closed subset set of m m and mm m m a write a as ifi where fi i 1 is a sequence of compact clean codimension 0 submanifolds of m m with fi 1 intfi let c m m 0 1 m m be a collar on m m with c m m 0 m m and for each i let ci m m c int fi 0 1 i assertions i and ii are clear moreover wi fi 0 1 i intfi 1 0 1 i 1 fi 0 1 i via a homeomorphism taking c fi 1 i onto fi 1 i then since frci c fi 1 i fi 0 1 i fi an application of relative regular neighborhood theory allows an adjustment of that homeomorphism so that frci is taken onto fi 1 i a reparametrization of the closed interval completes the proof of assertion iii note that this works even when the fi have multiple and varying numbers of components see figure 2 16 shijie gu and craig r guilbault c 1 w 1 a figure 2 decomposing completed mm into product cobordisms for the converse we reverse the above procedure to embed mm in a copy of c 1 details can be found in tuc 74 lemma 1 the above lemma shows that a strategy for completing a manifold is to fill up a neighborhood of infinity in mm with a sequence of cobordisms then modify those cobordisms when possible so they become products recall that an absolute cobordism is a triple w a b where w is a mani fold with boundary and a and b are disjoint manifolds without boundary for which a b w the triple w a b is a relative cobordism if a and b are dis joint codimension 0 clean submanifolds of w in that case there is an associated absolute cobordism v a b where v w inta intb we view absolute cobordisms as special cases of relative cobordisms where v a relative cobor dism is an h cobordism if each of the inclusions a w b w a v and b v is a homotopy equivalence it is an s cobordism if each of these inclu sions is a simple homotopy equivalence for convenience is considered a simple homotopy equivalence a relative cobordism is nice if it is absolute or if v a b a 0 1 a 0 a 1 the crucial result proof and additional discussion of which may be found in rs 82 is the following theorem 8 2 relative s cobordism theorem a compact nice relative cobordism w a b with dimw 6 is a product i e w a b a 0 1 a 0 a 1 if and only if it is an s cobordism remark 7 a situation similar to a nice relative cobordism occurs when w a b where a and b are codimension 0 clean submanifolds of w with a common nonempty boundary a b by choosing a clean codimension 0 submanifold b b with the property that b intb b 0 1 we arrive at a nice relative cobordism w a b when this procedure is applied we will refer to w a b as compactifications of manifolds with boundary 17 a corresponding nice relative cobordism for notational consistency we will always adjust the term b on the far right of the triple w a b leaving a alone for our purposes the following lemma will be crucial lemma 8 3 let w be a compact manifold with w a b where a and b are codimension 0 clean submanifolds of w with a common boundary suppose a w is a homotopy equivalence and that there is a homotopy j w 0 1 w such that j 0 idw j is fixed on b and j 1 w b then b w is a homotopy equivalence so the corresponding nice relative cobordism w a b is an h cobordism proof choose p a b to be used as the basepoint for a b and w let i a w and b w denote inclusions and define f a b by f x j 1 x then 8 1 f j 1 i clearly j 1 w w induces the identity isomorphism on 1 w p and since i is a homotopy equivalence it induces a 1 isomorphism so from 8 1 we may deduce that f 1 a p 1 b p is injective moreover since f restricts to the identity function mapping a onto b eps 66 allows us to conclude that f is an isomorphism from there it follows that 1 b p 1 w p is also an isomorphism let p w w be the universal covering projection a p 1 a and b p 1 b since i and are both 1 isomorphisms these are the universal covers of a and b respectively by generalized poincare duality for non compact manifolds hk w b z h n k c w a z where cohomology is with compact supports since a w is a proper homotopy equivalence all of these relative cohomology groups vanish so hk w b z 0 for all k by the relative hurewicz theorem k w b 0 for all k so the same is true for k w b an application of whitehead s theorem allows us to conclude that b w is a homotopy equivalence 9 proof of the manifold completion theorem necessity we will prove necessity of the conditions in theorem 1 1 by a straightforward application of lemma 8 1 proof of theorem 1 1 necessity suppose m m is a compact manifold and a is closed subset set of m msuch that mm m m a as in the proof of lemma 8 1 write a ifi where fi is a sequence of compact clean codimension 0 submanifolds of m m with fi 1 intfi and let c m m 0 1 m m be a collar on m m with c m m 0 m m for each i let n i c fi 0 1 i and ni n i a then ni is cofinal sequence of clean neighborhoods of infinity in m m with frni c fi 1 i fi 0 1 i since fi 1 i fi 0 1 i fi 0 1 i and 18 shijie gu and craig r guilbault ni n i are both homotopy equivalences then so is frni ni and since each ni has finite homotopy type conditions a and c of theorem 1 1 both hold by the discussion in 5 and 6 if we let wi ni ni 1 then m m is determined by the whitehead torsions of inclusions frni wi see 7 associate wi with fi 0 1 i and frni with fi 1 i fi 0 1 i as in the proof of lemma 8 1 then the fact that both fi 1 i fi 0 1 i and fi 1 i fi 1 i fi 0 1 i are simple homotopy equivalences ensures that wi frni 0 so condition d is satisfied it remains to verify the peripheral 1 stability condition fix i 1 and let f j i be one component of fi n j i c f j i 0 1 i and n j i n j i a then mn j i c fi 0 a and n j i is clearly mn j i connected at infinity for each k i let f k be the union of all components of fk contained in f j i n k c f k 0 1 k and n k n k a by definition we may consider the sequence 9 1 1 mn j i n i 1 2 1 mn j i n i 2 3 1 mn j i n i 3 4 where basepoints are suppressed and bonding homomorphisms are compositions of maps induced by inclusions and change of basepoint isomorphisms each of those inclusions is the top row of a commutative diagram mn j i n k mn j i n k 1 incl incl mn j i n k mn j i n k 1 f j i 0 f k 0 1 k f j i 0 f k 1 0 1 k 1 where the bottom row is an obvious homotopy equivalence as are all vertical maps it follows that the initial inclusion is a homotopy equivalence as well as a result all bonding homomorphisms in 9 1 are isomorphisms so the sequence is stable 10 proof of the manifold completion theorem sufficiency throughout this section ci i 1 will denote a clean compact exhaustion of m m with a corresponding cofinal sequence of clean 0 neighborhoods of infinity ni i 1 each of which has a finite set of connected components n j i ki j 1 for each i we will let wi ni ni 1 a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold of m m note that wi may be expressed as frni mwi frni 1 a union of two clean codimension 0 submanifolds of wi intersecting in a common boundary frni figures 2 and 1 contain useful schematics the proof of theorem 1 1 will be accomplished by gradually improving the exhaustion of mm so that ultimately conditions i iii of lemma 8 1 are all satisfied lemma 10 1 if mm is inward tame and m m vanishes then for each i ni and ni m m are both zero compactifications of manifolds with boundary 19 proof by our discussion in 6 if mm is inward tame and m m 0 then each ni has finite homotopy type since ni ni m m is a homotopy equivalence so does ni m m proposition 10 2 if mm satisfies conditions a c of theorem 1 1 then the ci and the corresponding ni can be chosen so that for each i 1 frni ni is a homotopy equivalence and 2 mwi frni 1 ni is a homotopy equivalence therefore 3 the nice relative cobordisms corresponding to wi frni mwi frni 1 are h cobordisms proof by lemma 10 1 and the definition of peripheral 1 stability at infinity we can begin with a clean compact exhaustion ci i 1 of m m and a corresponding sequence of neighborhoods of infinity ni i 1 each with a finite set of connected components n j i ki j 1 so that for all i 1 and 1 j ki i n j i is inward tame ii n j i is mn j i connected and mn j i 1 stable at infinity and iii n j i 0 by lemmas 5 3 4 2 and 6 1 this implies that i n j i mn j i is inward tame ii n j i m m is 1 ended and has stable fundamental group at infinity and iii n j i m m 0 these are precisely the hypotheses of siebenmann s relativized main theorem sie 65 th 10 1 so n j i m m contains an open collar neighborhood of infinity v j i v j i 0 following the proof in sie 65 similar to what is done in o b 83 th 3 2 this can be done so that n j i m m int frn j i and v j i con tain clean compact codimension 0 submanifolds a j i and b j i respectively so that n j i m m inta j i v j i intb j i a j i 0 1 see figure 3 then k j i n j i v j i is a clean codimension 0 submanifold of m m which intersects ci in a j i to save on notation replace ci with ci k j i which is still a clean compact codimension 0 submanifold of mm but with the added property that 10 1 ni m m int frni 0 since adding mni back in does not affect homotopy types we also have that 10 2 frni ni is a homotopy equivalence having enlarged the ci pass to a subsequence if necessary to regain the property that ci intci 1 for all i letting ni mm ci gives a nested cofinal sequence of clean neighborhoods of infinity ni with the property that each inclusion frni ni is a homotopy equiv alence in other words we have obtained a pseudo collar structure on mm for each i 1 let wi ni ni 1 a clean compact codimension 0 submanifold of m m with wi frni mwi frni 1 20 shijie gu and craig r guilbault k b v a figure 3 v j i v j i 0 1 contained in n j i m m claim 1 frni wi is a homotopy equivalence condition 10 2 applied toni ensures the existence a strong deformation retraction ht of ni onto frni that same condition applied to ni 1 ensures the existence of a retraction r ni 1 frni 1 which extends to a retraction r ni wi the composition r ht restricted to wi gives a deformation retraction of wi onto frni claim 2 mwi frni 1 wi is a homotopy equivalence by applying lemma 8 3 it is enough to show that there exists a homotopy h wi 0 1 wi fixed on frni with the property that h 1 wi mwi frni 1 toward that end let b be a collar neighborhood of mwi in wi and let d wi b use the collar structure on ni m m to obtain a homotopy k ni 0 1 ni fixed on frni which pushes ni into the complement of d in other words k 1 ni b ni 1 compose this homotopy with the retraction r ni wi used in the previous claim to get a homotopy r kt of wi still fixed on frni with r k 1 wi b frni 1 follow this with a homotopy that deformation retracts b onto mwi while sending frni 1 into itself to complete the desired homotopy and prove claim 2 we can now write mm c 1 w 1 w 2 w 3 where for each i wi is a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold of m m wi frni mwi frni 1 and both frni wi and mwi frni 1 wi are homotopy equivalences as such the corresponding nice relative cobordisms as described in remark 7 are h cobordisms compactifications of manifolds with boundary 21 proposition 10 3 if mm satisfies conditions b d of theorem 1 1 the conclu sion of proposition 10 2 can be improved so that for each i the nice relative cobor disms corresponding to wi frni mwi frni 1 are s cobordisms in that case wi frni frni 0 1 frni 0 for all i and m m is completable proof by the triviality of m m it is possible to adjust the choices of the ni so that each inclusion frni wi has trivial whitehead torsion i e wi frni 0 and hence is a simple homotopy equivalence as was discussed in 7 the adjustment involves lending and borrowing torsion to and from immediate neighbors of the wi as described in cs 76 6 except that a splitting theorem for finite dimensional manifolds see o b 83 p 318 replaces cs 76 lemma 6 1 to complete the proof apply the relative s cobordism theorem to each wi then apply lemma 8 1 11 z compactifications and the proof of theorem 1 2 in this section we prove theorem 1 2 since mm 0 1 satisfies conditions a c and d of theorem 1 1 if and only if mm satisfies those same conditions see cs 76 it suffices to prove the following proposition which is based on work found in gui 07 proposition 11 1 if a manifold mm is inward tame at infinity then mm 0 1 is peripherally 1 stable at infinity proof apply corollary 5 5 to obtain a cofinal sequence ni of clean neighborhoods of infinity for mm with the property that for all i each component n j i of ni is mn j i connected at infinity since ni 0 1 is a cofinal sequence of clean neighborhoods of infinity for mm 0 1 it suffices to show that the corresponding connected com ponents n j i 0 1 are all m 0 1 n j i 0 1 connected and m 0 1 n j i 0 1 1 stable at infinity by lemmas 4 1 and 4 2 that is equivalent to showing that for each n j i intm n j i 0 1 is 1 ended and has stable pro 1 at that end every con nected topological space becomes 1 ended upon crossing with 0 1 so that condition is immediate the 1 stability property is proved with a small variation on the main technical argument from gui 07 in particular corollary 3 6 from that paper the small variation is necessary because the earlier argument assumed the product of an open manifold with 0 1 that issue is easily overcome by arranging that the analog of homotopy kt used in gui 07 prop 3 3 sends the manifold interior of intm n j i into itself and sends frn j i into itself for all t that is easily accomplished since frn j i has an open collar neighborhood at infinity 12 a counterexample to a question of o brien we now give a negative answer to a question posed by o brien o b 83 p 308 question for a 1 ended manifold mm with 1 ended boundary let vi be a cofinal sequence of clean 0 neighborhoods of infinity if 1 m m vi i 1 is stable does it follow that mm is peripherally 1 stable at infinity 22 shijie gu and craig r guilbault the key ingredient in our counterexamples is a collection of contractible open n manifolds w n one for each n 3 constructed by r sternfeld in his dissertation ste 77 see also gu each w n has the property that it cannot be embedded in any compact n manifold although these w n have finite homotopy type they are not inward tame since they contain arbitrarily small clean connected neighborhoods of infinity with non finitely generated fundamental groups our counterexamples will be the n 1 manifolds w n 0 1 first a general observation proposition 12 1 let w n be a connected open n manifold if w n has finite homo topy type then w n 0 1 is 1 ended and inward tame with w n 0 1 0 proof it suffices to exhibit arbitrarily small connected clean neighborhood of infinity in w n with finite homotopy type let n w n be a clean neighborhood of infinity and a 0 1 by choosing n small and a close to 1 we can obtain arbitrarily small neighborhoods of infinity in w n 0 1 of the form v n a n 0 1 w n a 1 since v n a deformation retracts onto w n a it is connected and has finite homotopy type example 2 consider the n 1 manifold mn 1 w n 0 1 where w n is the sternfeld n manifold n 3 described above then mn 1 w n 0 a standard duality argument shows that every contractible open manifold of dimension 2 is 1 ended let ni be a cofinal sequence of clean connected neighborhoods of infinity in w n and for each i 1 let vi v ni i i 1 as defined in the previous proof by seifert van kampen each vi m n 1 is simply connected so the inverse sequence 1 m n 1 vi i 1 is pro trivial hence stable to see that mn 1 is not peripherally 1 stable at infinity first assume that n 5 then if mn 1 were peripherally 1 stable at infinity it would be completable by theorem 1 1 the triviality of m n 1 is immediate since mn 1 is simply connected at infinity which follows from the simple connectivity of the vi but if m n 1 were a completion then w n 0 m n 1 would be an embedding into a closed n manifold contradicting sternfeld s theorem to obtain analogous examples when n 3 or n 4 we cannot rely on the manifold completion theorem but a direct analysis of the fundamental group calculations in sternfeld s proof reveals that the peripheral pro 1 systems arising in w n 0 1 are nonstable in those dimensions as well 13 proof of lemma 4 6 we now return to lemma 4 6 which asserts that the two natural candidates for the definition of peripherally 1 stable at infinity the global versus the local ap proach are equivalent for inward tame manifolds the intuition behind the lemma is fairly simple if mm contains arbitrarily small 0 neighborhoods of infinity n with the property that each component n j is mn j 1 stable at infinity then those com ponents provide arbitrarily small neighborhoods of the ends satisfying the necessary compactifications of manifolds with boundary 23 1 stability condition conversely if each end has arbitrarily small strong 0 neigh borhoods p that are mp 1 stable at infinity we can use the compactness of the set of ends in the freudenthal compactification to find within any neighborhood of infinity a finite collection p 1 pk of such neighborhoods which cover the end of mm if we can do this so the pi are pairwise disjoint we are finished just let n pi that is not as easy as one might hope but we are able to attain the desired conclusion by proving the following proposition proposition 13 1 suppose mm is inward tame and each end has arbitrarily small strong 0 neighborhoods p that are mp 1 stable at infinity then every strong partial 0 neighborhood of infinity q mm is mq 1 stable at infinity our proof requires that we break the stability condition into a pair of weaker conditions an inverse sequence of groups is semistable sometimes called pro epimorphic if it is pro isomorphic to an inverse sequence of surjective homomorphisms pro monomorphic of it is pro isomorphic to an inverse sequence of injective homomorphisms it is an elementary fact that an inverse sequence is stable if and only if it is both semistable and pro monomorphic we will make use of the following topological characterizations of the above proper ties when applied to pro 1 in these theorems a space should be locally compact locally connected and metrizable proposition 13 2 let x be a 1 ended space and r 0 x a proper ray then pro 1 x r is 1 semistable if and only if for every compact set c x there exists a larger compact set d x such that for any compact set e with d e x every loop in x d with base point on r can be pushed into x e by a homotopy with image in x c keeping the base point on r and 2 pro monomorphic if and only if x contains a compact set c with the property that for every compact set d with c d x there exists a compact set e d with the property that every loop in x e that contracts in x c also contracts in x d these are standard see for example geo 08 or gui 16 in the case that pro 1 x r is pro monomorphic the compact set c in the above proposition is called a 1 core for x notice that by proposition 13 2 the property of 1 ended x having pro monomorphic pro 1 x r is independent of the choice of r it is a non obvious but standard fact that having semistable pro 1 x r is also independent of the choice of r as for the characterization of semistable pro 1 x r we are mostly interested in the following easy corollary corollary 13 3 if x is a 1 ended space and pro 1 x r is semistable for some hence every proper ray r then for each compact set c x there is a larger compact 24 shijie gu and craig r guilbault set d x such that for every compact set e x and every path 0 1 x d with 0 1 e there is a path homotopy in x c taking to a path in x e we are now ready for our primary task proof of proposition 13 1 let q be a strong partial 0 neighborhood of infinity in mm by lemma 4 2 proving that q is mq 1 stable at infinity is equivalent to proving that the 1 ended space q mm has stable pro 1 we will take the latter approach by lemma 5 3 q mm is inward tame so a modification of the argument in gt 03 prop 3 2 ensures that pro 1 q m m r is semistable it is therefore enough to show that pro 1 q m m r is pro monomorphic we will do that by verifying the condition described in proposition 13 2 i e we will show that q mm contains a 1 core by hypothesis each end of q has a strong 0 neighborhood p which is mp 1 stable at infinity and lies in intm q since the set of ends of q is compact in the freudenthal compactification there is a finite subcollection p i k i 1 whose union is a neighborhood of infinity in q place the collection of submanifolds p i k i 1 in general position claim 1 for each 1 k the set j p j has finitely many components each of which is a clean codimension 0 submanifold of mm general position ensures that each component is a clean codimension 0 submanifold ofmm since each p j is a closed subset ofm m each component t of j p j is closed in mm and since t cannot also be open in mm it must have nonempty frontier since p j j is in general position so also is the collection of compact frontiers frp j j so for each i 6 j in i j frp i frp j is a clean codimension 1 submanifold of frp i and frp j the union of these i j separate k j 1 frp j into finitely many pieces and since the frontier of each t is a union of these pieces there can only be finitely many such t choose an embedding b mm 0 1 mm with b x 0 x for all x mm and whose image b is a regular neighborhood of mm in mm with some additional care arrange that b intersects q in b mq 0 1 each p i in b mp i 0 1 and more specifically each component t of each finite intersection j p j in b mt 0 1 for each 0 s t 1 let b s t b mm s t b s t b mm s t etc for a mm let ba b a 0 1 and define b s t a b s t a etc analogously by hypothesis and proposition 13 2 we can choose a clean codimension 0 compact 1 core ci for each p i m m then choose t so small that b 0 t ki 1 ci let c 0 q k i 1 p i then let c 0 c 0 b 0 t so that c 0 is a compact clean codimension 0 submanifold of q mm let c ki 0 ci q m m notice that the collection b 0 t mq p 1 p k covers q intqc choose a clean codimension 0 compact submanifold of d q mm so large that compactifications of manifolds with boundary 25 i intqd c ii d contains every compact component of j p j for all 1 k and iii for any compact set e q mm such that d e if is a path in t mm where t is an unbounded component of p i p j for some i j 1 k and lies outside d with endpoints outside e then there is a path homotopy of in t mm c pushing outside e this uses corollary 13 3 and the fact that each t being a clean partial neighborhood of infinity in mm has the property that t mm has finitely many ends each with semistable pro 1 now choose a compact set d q mm such that i d d ii for every 1 k and every unbounded component t of j p j each x t mm d can be pushed to infinity in t mm d this is possible since there are only finitely such t iii if x b y t 0 b d then b y 0 t 0 d claim 2 d is a 1 core for q m m toward that end let f be a compact subset of q mm containing d then choose g q mm to be an even larger compact set with the following property for each i 1 k loops in p i m m lying outside g which contract in p i m m c also contract in p i m m f let 0 1 0 1 q mm d the interiors of sets b 0 t mq p 1 p k cover q mm d so we can subdivide 0 1 2 into subsquares rt so small that the image of each rt lies in b 0 t or one of the p i m m and hence in b 0 t d or one of the p i m m d since each vertex of this subdivision is sent to a point x in b 0 t d and or t d where t is an unbounded component of the intersection of the p i which contain the images of the subsquares containing that vertex then by the choice of d we can push x into q mm g along a path that does not leave t and does not intersect d in those cases where x b y t 0 b 0 t d push x out of g along b y 0 1 so that the track also stays in b 0 t d by property iii doing the above for each vertex adjusts up to homotopy in q mm d so that each vertex of the subdivision is taken into q mm g and each rt is still taken into the same p i or b 0 t as before next we move to the 1 skeleton of our subdivision of 0 1 2 if an edge e is the intersection rt rt of two squares i e e is not in 0 1 2 we use property iii to adjust up to homotopy so e is mapped into q mm g noting that this homotopy may causes the new to drift into q mm c if e is sent into b 0 t we can use iii to ensure that the push stays in b 0 t d as well do the above for each edge until the entire 1 skeleton of the subdivision of 0 1 2 is mapped into q mm g the image of now lies in q mm c notice that the restriction of to each rt is a map of a disk into a single p i or b 0 t missing ci with boundary being mapped into p i g so by the choice of g we may redefine on rt to be the same on its boundary but to take rt into p i f or b 0 t f 26 shijie gu and craig r guilbault assembling the rt we get a map 0 1 0 1 q mm f that agrees with on 0 1 2 references adg 97 f d ancel m w davis and c r guilbault cat 0 reflection manifolds geometric topology athens ga 1993
