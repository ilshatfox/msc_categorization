degli studi di trieste dipartimento di matematica e geoscienze 34127 trieste italy abstract we consider finite group actions on 3 manifolds hg obtained as the con nected sum of g copies of s 2 s 1 with free fundamental group fg of rank g we prove that for g 1 a finite group of diffeomorphisms of hg inducing a trivial action on homology is cyclic and embeds into an s 1 action on hg as a consequence no non trivial element of the twist subgroup of the mapping class group of hg generated by dehn twists along embedded 2 spheres can be realized by a periodic diffeomorphism of hg in the sense of the nielsen realization problem we also discuss when a finite subgroup of the outer automorphism group out fg of the fundamental group of hg can be realized by a group of diffeomorphisms of

fudamental group nielsen re alization problem 1 introduction all finite group actions in the present paper will be faithful smooth and orientation preserving all manifolds orientable we are interested in finite group actions on con nected sums hg g s 2 s 1 of g copies of s 2 s 1 we will call hg a closed handle of genus g in the following the fundamental group of hg is the free group fg of rank g considering induced actions on the fundamental group and on the first homology h 1 hg z g there are canonical maps diff hg out fg gl g z where diff hg denotes the orientation preserving diffeomorphism group of hg and out fg aut fg inn fg the outer automorphism group of its fundamental group theorem 1 let g be a finite group acting on a closed handle hg of genus g 1 such that the induced action on the first homology of hg is trivial then g is cyclic and a subgroup of an s 1 action on hg in particular all elements of g are isotopic to the identity 1 http arxiv org abs 2105 04901 v 2 for a description and classification of circle actions on 3 manifolds and closed handles see 14 denoting by mod hg the mapping class group of isotopy classes of orientation preser ving diffeomorphisms of hg there are induced maps mod hg out fg gl g z let twist hg denote the subgroup of mod hg generated by all dehn twists along embedded 2 spheres inhg i e by cutting along a 2 sphere and regluing after twisting by one full turn around an axis since such a twist represents a generator of 1 so 3 z 2 its square is isotopic to the identity by classical results of laudenbach 6 7 there is a short exact sequence 1 twist hg mod hg out fg 1 moreover twist hg z 2 g is generated by the sphere twists around the core spheres s 2 of the g different s 2 s 1 summands of hg twists around seperating 2 spheres instead are isotopic to the identity it is proved in 1 that mod hg is isomorphic to a semidirect product twist hg out fg theorem 1 has the following consequence in the sense of the nielsen realization problem corollary 1 no nontrivial element of the twist group twist hg can be realized represented by a periodic diffeomorphism of hg for g 1 this follows from theorem 1 but the methods apply also to the case g 1 of h 1 s 2 s 1 using the fact that s 2 s 1 is a geometric 3 manifold belonging to the s 2 r geometry one of thurston s eight 3 dimensional geometries see 15 and that finite group actions on s 2 s 1 are geometric 10 theorem 8 4 for a solution of the nielsen realization problem for aspherical and haken 3 manifolds see 21 here finite groups of mapping classes can always be realized except for a purely algebraic obstruction in the case of seifert fiber spaces where however a finite inflation of the group can always be realized by 6 homotopic diffeomorphisms of hg are isotopic but this does not remain true for arbitrary connected sums of 3 manifolds by 4 twists around separating 2 spheres in a 3 manifold may or may not be homotopic to the identity moreover by 3 there are sphere twists which are homotopic but not isotopic to the identity see also the discussion in the introduction of 1 as an example considering a connected sum m m 1 m 2 of two closed hyperbolic 3 manifolds m 1 and m 2 the sphere twist around the connecting 2 sphere is not homotopic to the identity also it cannot be realized by a periodic map e g if m 1 or m 2 does not admit a nontrivial periodic map then also the connected sum m m 1 m 2 has no periodic maps 2 there arises naturally the question of which finite subgroups of out fg can be realized by a finite group of diffeomorphisms of hg finite groups g of diffeomorphisms of hg which act faithfully on the fundamental group i e inject into out fg are considered in 17 where for g 15 the quadratic upper bound g 24 g g 1 for their orders is obtained since out fg has finite subgroups of larger orders these subgroups cannot be realized by finite groups of diffeomorphisms by 16 the maximal order of a finite subgroup of out fg is 2 gg for g 2 a precise result is as follows we refer to 17 section 2 for definitions and the proof theorem 2 let g be a finite subgroup of out fg and 1 fg e g 1 the corresponding group extension associated tog theng can be realized by an isomorphic group of diffeomorphisms of hg if and only if e is isomorphic to the fundamental group 1 g of a finite graph of finite groups g in normal form associated to a closed handle orbifold in particular the vertex groups g have to be isomorphic to finite subgroups of so 4 and the edge groups to finite subgroups of so 3 we note that for a finite group g acting on a closed handle hg the quotient hg g has the structure of a closed handle orbifold see 17 analogous results on finite group actions on 3 dimensional handlebodies are obtained in 8 and 12 and in 9 for finite group actions on handlebodies in arbitrary dimensions the case g 2 is special by well known results out f 2 aut z 2 gl 2 z d 6 d 2 d 4 so up to conjugation the maximal finite subgroups of out f 2 are the dihedral groups d 6 and d 4 of orders 12 and 8 and both can be realized by diffeomorphisms of the torus with one boundary component hence if the realizations of the amalgamated subgroups d 2 coincide one obtains a realization of the whole group out f 2 d 6 d 2 d 4 considering the product with a closed interval one obtains realizations on the handlebody v 2 of genus 2 and alsos on its double h 2 along the boundary concerning the case g 3 by 18 there are exactly five maximal finite subgroups of out f 3 up to conjugation by an easy application of theorem 2 all of these maximal finite subgroups can be realized by diffeomorphisms of the closed handle h 3 of genus 3 but not of a handlebody v 3 of genus 3 2 proof of theorem 1 let g be a finite group acting faithfully and orientation preservingly on a closed handle hg g s 2 s 1 of genus g by the equivariant sphere theorem see 10 for an approach by minimal surface techniques 2 and 5 for topological combinatorial proofs there exists an embedded homotopically nontrivial 2 sphere s 2 in hg such that x s 2 s 2 3 or x s 2 s 2 for all x g we cut hg along the system of disjoint 2 spheres g s 2 by removing the interiors of g equivariant regular neighbourhoods s 2 1 1 of these 2 spheres and call each of these regular neighbourhoods s 2 1 1 a 1 handle the result is a collection of 3 manifolds with 2 sphere boundaries with an induced action of g we close each of the 2 sphere boundaries by a 3 ball and extend the action of g by taking the cone over the center of each of these 3 balls so g permutes these 3 balls and their centers the result is a finite collection of closed handles of lower genus on which g acts cf 17 applying inductively the procedure of cutting along 2 spheres we finally end up with a finite collection of 3 spheres or 0 handles closed handles of genus 0 note that the construction gives a finite graph on which g acts whose vertices correspond to the 0 handles and whose edges to the 1 handles note that has no free edges i e edges with one vertex of valence 1 on each 3 sphere 0 handle there are finitely many points which are the centers of the attached 3 balls their boundaries are the 2 spheres along which the 1 handles are attached for each of these 3 spheres let gv denote its stabilizer in g by the ge ometrization of finite group actions on 3 manifolds one may assume that the action of a stabilizer gv on the corresponding 3 sphere is orthogonal but this is not needed for the following denoting by ge the stabilizer in g of a 1 handles s 2 1 1 we can assume that each stabilizer ge preserves the product structure of s 2 1 1 of the corresponding 1 handle by choosing small equivariant regular neighbourhoods of the 2 spheres if some element of a stabilizer ge acts as a reflection on 1 1 we split the 1 handle into two 1 handles by introducing a new 0 handle obtained from a small regular neighbourhood s 2 of s 2 0 by closing up with two 3 balls hence we can assume that each stabilizer ge of a 1 handle s 2 1 1 does not interchange its two boundary 2 spheres that is g acts without inversions on the graph suppose now that g 1 and that the induced action of g on the first homology of hg and hence also of is trivial as before g acts without inversions on and has no free edges we will prove in next proposition that under these hypotheses the action of g on is trivial that is each element of g acts as the identity on hence g fixes each vertex and each edge of since g fixes each 1 handle s 2 1 1 it maps each 2 sphere s 2 0 to itself by construction g does not interchange the two sides ot such a 2 sphere and acts faithfully on it otherwise some element of g would act trivially on an invariant regular neighbourhood of such a 2 sphere and then act trivially also on all of hg well known in particular for smooth actions it follows that g is isomorphic to a finite subgroup of the orthogonal group so 3 i e cyclic zn dihedral d 2 n tetrahedral a 4 octahedral s 4 or dedecahedral a 5 it is easy to see that an orientation preserving action of d 2 n a 4 s 4 or a 5 on s 3 has at most two global fixed points around which a 1 handle can be attached but then the graph would be a segment or a circle that is g 1 since g 1 g is a cyclic group which acts by rotations around an axis s 1 in each 0 handle 4 s 3 by the positive solution of the smith conjecture 13 each of these axes is a trivial knot in s 3 and hence the action of the cyclic group g embeds into an s 1 action on each 0 handle since these s 1 actions on the 0 handles extend to the connecting 1 handles s 2 1 1 the cyclic g action on hg embeds into an s 1 action to complete the proof of theorem 1 it remains to prove the following proposition which may be considered as an analogue of theorem 1 for finite graphs proposition let g be a finite group acting faithfully on a finite connected graph without free edges and of genus g 1 or cycle rank or rank of its free fundamental group then also the induced action of g on the first homology h 1 z g of is faithful proof by subdividing edges we can assume that g acts without inversion of edges on suppose that an element x g acts trivially on the first homology of then its lefschetz number is 1 g which by the hopf trace formula is equal to the euler characteristic of the fixed point set of x which is a subgraph of since g acts without inversions of edges the graph of genus g has euler characteristic 1 g passing from to by adding successively the missing edges the euler characteristic remains unchanged when adding a free edge or decreases since has no free edges this implies and hence x acts trivally on this completes the proof of the proposition by 19 proof of satz 3 1 each finite subgroup of out fg can be realized by an action of the group on a finite graph without free edges this is a version of the nielsen realization problem for finite graphs which several years later was rediscovered by various authors the proposition implies then the following well known result corollary 2 the canonical projection out fg gl g z is injective on finite subgroups of out fg we note that not all finite subgroups of gl g z are induced in this way by finite subgroups of out fg in fact for g 2 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 there are finite subgroups of gl g z of orders larger than 2 gg which by 16 is the maximal order of a finite subgroup of out fg on the other hand there are also small cyclic subgroups of gl g z which cannot be realized in this way see the discussion in 20 section 5 5 references 1 t brendle n broaddus a
