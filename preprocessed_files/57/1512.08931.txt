present a large family of knots for which the rasmussen s invariants of arbitrary satellites do not detect sliceness this answers a question of hedden the proof hinges on work of kronheimer mrowka and cochran harvey horn 1 introduction in ras 10 rasmussen introduced a smooth knot concordance invariant s k using a deformed version of khovanov homology in general while invariants from khovanov homology have common aspects with and are related to those from heegaard floer ho mology it is expected and often confirmed that they behave very distinctly for instance the volume conjecture tells us that jones polynomials of cables contain significantly more information than the alexander polynomials of cables which are completely determined by the alexander polynomial of the initially given knot in case of the s invariant it shares several properties with the invariant of ozsva th szabo and rasmussen which may be viewed as its heegaard floer analog but hedden and ording showed that s is independent from ho 08 regarding the cabling hedden asked the following question question hed 09 question 1 4 does the rasmussen s invariant applied to all iter ated cables of k determine whether k is smoothly slice we remark that the behavior of under cabling is well understood by work of hedden and hom hed 05 hed 09 hom 14 a see also vc 10 pet 13 in particular the version of the above question was answered in the negative in a similar fashion to the alexander polynomial case but in a more sophisticated way hed 09 hom 14 a the s invariant case was left open mainly because of the difficulty of analyzing the khovanov chain complex of cables the goal of this note is to answer hedden s question on the s invariant by presenting a large family of counterexamples to state it we use the following condition for a knot k in s 3 motivated by work of kronheimer and mrowka km 13 and cochran harvey and horn chh 13 km there exist pairs v d v d of a compact smooth 4 manifold v and a smoothly embedded disk d in v such that v d s 3 k b 1 v 0 v is definite i e b 2 v b 2 v and d d 0 in 2 v s 3 by km 13 corollary 1 1 s k 0 if k satisfies km for knots k s 3 and p s 1 d 2 denote by p k the satellite knot with pattern p and companion k denote the unknot by u theorem a if k is a knot satisfying km then s p k s p u for any pattern p s 1 d 2 1 http arxiv org abs 1512 08931 v 1 rasmussen s invariants of satellites do not detect slice knots 2 consequently if k satisfies km any iterated cable of k has the same s invariant as the corresponding iterated cable of the unknot this answers hedden s question in the negative the collection of knots satisfying km is large for instance 0 bipolar knots in the sense of chh 13 satisfy km especially if a knot has a diagram from which a slice knot is obtained by changing positive crossings and has a possibly different diagram from which a slice knot is obtained by changing negative crossings then the knot satisfies km cl 86 lemma 3 4 to describe explicit examples let k a b be the knot shown in figure 1 then k 1 n and k n n satisfy km for any n 0 by the above it is known that k 1 n for 2 6 n 0 and k n n for n 0 are not slice even topologically e g see cg 86 jia 81 kim 05 cha 07 in fact they generate a subgroup isomorphic to z z 2 in the smooth and topological knot concordance group a positive full twists b negative full twists figure 1 the knot k a b the figure eight knot is the simplest case n 1 we remark that k n n with n 0 has order 2 in the knot concordance group and is smoothly rationally slice that is bounds a smoothly embedded disk in a rational homology ball whose boundary is s 3 see cha 07 theorem 4 16 and figure 6 for a proof consequently p k n n is ratio nally concordant to p u for any p this relates the case of k n n to an intriguing open question e g see cp 14 question 2 1 if k is rationally slice does s k vanish if so then one would conclude immediately that s p k n n s p u our proof of theorem a which is given in section 2 shows the conclusion without the invariance of s under rational concordance our method is largely influenced by work of cochran harvey and horn chh 13 we remark that our argument for the s invariant applies to the case of the invariant the invariant and the knot floer chain complex invariant cfk k of hom hom 14 a hom 14 b and the pk invariant of manolescu owens mo 07 and jabuka jab 12 as well using this we observe that these invariants of arbitrary satellites even when considered all together do not detect slice knots theorem b there are knots k which generate a subgroup isomorphic to z z 2 in the smooth and topological knot concordance groups and satisfy p k p u for any pattern p and s pk cfk the proof of theorem b is given in section 3 acknowledgment the

that everything is smooth we say that a pattern q s 1 d 2 is slice if q viewed as a knot in s 1 d 2 d 2 s 1 d 2 d 2 s 3 is slice that is q u is slice let c be the knot concordance group the following innocent observation reduces the investigation of the effect of satellite operations on a homomorphism of c to the case of slice patterns we state it as a lemma for later use as well lemma 2 1 suppose f c a is an abelian group homomorphism and k is a knot in s 3 satisfying f q k 0 for any slice pattern q then f p k f p u for any pattern p proof for a given pattern p let qp be the pattern p p u that is s 1 d 2 qp is the connected sum of two pairs s 1 d 2 p and s 3 p u then qp j p j p u for any knot j so qp u p u p u is a ribbon knot in s 3 and thus qp is a slice pattern for the given k by the hypotheses we have 0 f qp k f p k p u f p k f p u the following is a variation of arguments appeared in chh 13 proposition 3 3 cp 14 theorem 2 6 6 lemma 2 2 suppose that a knot k in s 3 satisfies km and q s 1 d 2 is a slice pattern then the satellite knot q k satisfies km proof suppose k satisfies km via v d choose a slice disk d 2 d 2 bounded by q s 1 d 2 d 2 d 2 choose a diffeomorphism d 2 d 2 d onto the normal bundle d which sends d 2 0 to d and p d 2 to a normal disk fiber for each p d 2 let be the image of the disk under the diffeomorphism then q k that is is a slice disk for q k in v now to show that q k satisfies km it suffices to prove that 0 in 2 v s 3 consider the following commutative diagram of inclusions where d d s 3 d d k v s 3 d d i oo j 66 the induced map j on 2 is zero by the condition km since i is a homotopy equiva lence k 0 on 2 too it follows that 0 in 2 v s 3 now we are ready to prove theorem a proof of theorem a suppose that k satisfies km for any slice pattern q s 1 d 2 q k satisfies km by lemma 2 2 and consequently s q k 0 by km 13 corollary 1 1 since s c z is a homomorphism s p k s p u for all pattern p s 1 d 2 by lemma 2 1 3 proof of theorem b invariants from floer homology our argument used in section 2 can be applied to cfk and pk in a similar way we begin with an observation based on hom s work which will be used to reduce the cases of and cfk to the case of rasmussen s invariants of satellites do not detect slice knots 4 theorem 3 1 hom for two knots k and k the following are equivalent 1 k k 0 2 cfk k cfk k 3 p k p k for any pattern p 4 p k p k for any pattern p 5 p k p k 0 for any pattern p 6 cfk p k cfk p k for any pattern p proof the equivalences 1 2 and 5 6 are definitions in hom 14 b corollary 5 and 2 3 is due to hom 14 b corollary 5 for 3 4 let p be the pattern obtained by taking 2 1 cable of p s 1 d 2 denote the p q cable of a knot j by jp q then p k 2 1 p k hom showed that the value of j is determined by the pair of integers j 2 1 j 2 1 hom 14 b theorem 5 2 since p k p k by 3 it follows that p k p k for 4 3 define qp p p k similarly to the proof of theorem a since qp k p k p k is slice qp k 0 by 4 qp k qp k 0 hom showed that j 0 whenever j 0 hom 14 b theorem 5 2 applying this it follows that qp k 0 now p k p k p k p k qp k 0 in the above paragraph we have shown that 4 implies qp k 0 since qp k p k p k this shows 4 5 the converse is a straightforward consequence of hom s result that j j j whenever j 0 hom 14 a proposition 3 6 6 indeed from this and the concordance invariance of it follows that j j j j j if j j 0 the implication 5 4 is a special case of this for the cases of cfk and pk it turns out to be natural to consider the class of r homology n bipolar knots defined in cp 14 here r is a subring of q this is a homology version of the notion of n bipolar knots introduced in chh 13 we do not spell out the definition since we do not use it directly the readers are referred to cp 14 definition 2 3 for details we will use the following facts only for a prime p denote by z p a b q a b z p b the localization of z at p b 1 an n bipolar knot is r homology n bipolar for any r cp 14 p 1544 b 2 if k is a r homology n bipolar knot then q k is r homology n bipolar for any slice pattern q cp 14 theorem 2 6 6 b 3 k 0 if k is z p homology 0 bipolar for some prime p or equivalently q homology bipolar cp 14 theorem 2 7 b 4 pk k 0 if k is z p homology 1 bipolar cp 14 theorem 2 8 we remark that b 2 b 3 and b 4 above are mild generalizations of chh 13 propo sitions 3 3 1 2 and 2 8 theorem 3 2 suppose k is a knot in s 3 and p is a prime 1 if k is z p homology 0 bipolar p k p u for any pattern p and cfk 2 if k is z p homology 1 bipolar pk p k pk p u for any pattern p consequently if k is 1 bipolar p k p u for any pattern p and s cfk proof this is shown by a variation of the proof of theorem a using b 2 in place of lemma 2 1 also we need to use b 3 and b 4 instead of km 13 corollary 1 1 details are as follows rasmussen s invariants of satellites do not detect slice knots 5 1 by theorem 3 1 it suffices to prove the case suppose k is z p homology 0 bipolar for an arbitrary slice pattern q q k is z p homology 0 bipolar by b 2 it follows that q k 0 by b 3 by lemma 2 1 p k p u for any pattern p 2 suppose that k is z p homology 1 bipolar for any slice pattern q q k is z p homology 1 bipolar by b 2 it follows that pk q k 0 by b 4 by lemma 2 1 pk p k pk p u for any pattern p proof of theorem b there exists a family of 1 bipolar knots say ki which generates a subgroup isomorphic to z z 2 in the smooth and topological knot concordance groups chh 13 theorem 7 1 since a 1 bipolar knot satisfies km and is z p homology 1 bipolar by theorem 3 2 we have p k p u for any pattern p and cfk pk when k is 1 bipolar especially when k ki references cg 86 andrew casson and cameron gordon cobordism of classical knots a la recherche de la topologie perdue birkha user
