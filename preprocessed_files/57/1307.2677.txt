second part of our works on hausdorff dimension of schottky groups 16 in this paper we prove that there exists a uni versal positive number 0 such that up to finite index any finitely generated non elementary kleinian group with limit set of hausdorff dimension is a classical schottky group the proof rely on our previous works in 16 15 which provide the foundation to the general result of this

space for a given kleinian group finitely generated torsion free discrete subgroup of psl 2 c the limit set of is defined as x h 3 is the minimal non empty closed subset of h 3 which is invariant under the group is called non elementary if contains more then two points when 6 h 3 then the group is said to be of second kind otherwise it is called first kind the set h 3 is called region of discontinuity of and it follows that acts properly discontinuously on given a collection of disjointed closed topological disks di d i 1 i k in the riemann sphere h 3 c with boundary curves di i d i i by definition i are closed jordan curves in riemann sphere h 3 let i k 1 psl 2 c such that i i i and i di d i the group generated by 1 k is a free kleinian group of rank k and is called marked schottky group with marking 1 k equivalently one can also define rank k schottky group to be the image of discrete faithful convex compact representation of rank k free group fk into psl 2 c with marking 2 given by the equivalence of these two definitions simply follows from s varc milnor lemma and the classification of finitely generated purely loxodromic free kleinian groups given a finitely generated kleinian group it is called schottky group if it is a marked schottky group for some markings whenever there exists a set i k of generators with all i i as circles then it is called a marked classical schottky group with classical markings i k and 1 k are called classical generators a schottky group is called classical schottky group if there exists a classical markings for denote by jk psl 2 c the space of all rank k schottky groups up to conjugacy and jk o be the set of all rank k classical schottky groups up to conjugacy one can topologies and put analytic structure on jk as follows note that one can embed jk into c 3 k 3 as 3 k 3 dimensional complex manifold then jk is infinite index covering space in fact analytic cover of the moduli space of genus k closed riemann surfaces hence jk can also be considered fine moduli space of genus k riemann surfaces the universal covering space of jk is the techimu ller space equivalently schottky space jk can also be viewed as the quasiconformal deformation space qf of a fixed given rank k classical schottky group the equivalency of these two definitions simply follows from representation deformation theory of klenian groups and the definition of schottky groups note that qf is independent of choice of since given any two ranked k classical schottky groups marked with i i 1 i k there exists quasiconformal f with i f i f the boundary qf psl 2 c k contains points that are non schottky groups which are called geometrically infinite kleinian groups of first kind i e limit set is c these kleinian groups have limit set of hausdorff dimension 2 in fact there are uncountable many such elements in qf the set of classical schottky groups is a non empty and non dense subset of set of schottky groups 19 also see 11 for a given schottky group denote the hausdorff dimension of by d our main result is theorem 1 1 there exists a universal 0 such that all finitely generated non elementary kleinian group with d are classical schottky groups note that theorem 1 1 holds up to finite index theorem 1 1 can be viewed as the converse to the result by phillips sarnak 23 for higher di mensional kleinian groups and doyle 11 which states that there exists a 3 universal upper bound on the hausdorff dimension of limit sets of all classi cal schottky groups there are also some recent interesting works on bounds of hausdorff dimensions of limit sets of kleinian groups by kapovich 17 bowen 5 let 0 be given by theorem 1 1 denote j k o as the set of classical schottky groups of hausdorff dimension then by analyticity of haus dorff dimension function on schottky space and theorem 1 1 we have the following simple observation corollary 1 2 j k o is 3 k 3 dimensional complex manifold 1 1 strategy of the proof the proof is based on induction on rank k it follows from main result of 16 we know theorem 1 1 holds for k 2 we assume theorem 1 1 is true for k 1 with k 2 the ideas and techniques used are mostly generalizations of methods developed in 16 note that for a given rank k schottky group when we speak of set of generators or generating set we always mean a set of k elements of free generators hence by definition it is always minimal preliminary estimates we state some preliminary estimates and some of it s generalizations that are given in 16 on the locations of fixed points centers of isometric circle of a given set of generators of a schottky group detailed proofs of these estimates can be found in 16 these estimates will give us a sufficient controls on how the fixed points of a set of generators move in terms of the hausdorff dimen sion of the limit set of the group more precisely when the hausdorff dimension of rank k schottky group is small then any set of k gen erators will have either the norm of the trace exponentially large or its fixed points degenerates into single point exponentially fast the main ingredients of the proofs of these estimates rely on the results of 15 this is done in section 3 and section 4 sufficient condition for classscial ness for a given sequence of rank k schottky groups we will derive a set of sufficient conditions on any sequence of set of generators with respective to hausdorff dimensions of its limit sets for it to contain classical schottky group generators if a given sequence of set of generators satisfies these conditions then the 4 sequence will contain a subsequence that will eventually be classical schottky groups these sufficient conditions ensures that a given sequence of decreasing hausdorff dimensions will contain a subsequence of eventually classical schottky groups are given in section 5 for computational purpose it turns out that the computations in this part are easier by using the unit ball model of the hyperbolic 3 space however all statements are made in the upper half space of hyperbolic 3 space of course all statements are model independent in fact this is our generalized version of conditions given in 16 to rank k these conditions in the basic form simply states that if the norm of the traces of generators growth sufficiently fast compare to the degenerations of it s fixed points then all the schottky disks will eventually be disjoint obstructions to classical ness let be a sequence of rank k schottky groups n of decreasing hausdorff dimensions dn 0 denote it s set of generators by s n we will classify all obstructions for this sequence to contain any classical schottky group subsequence it follows from theorem 3 1 and proposition 4 1 there are at least k 1 generators that will have either norms of the trace growth exponentially or it s fixed points degenerates into single point exponentially with respect to the dn hence we first assume the sequence is k 1 classical of standard form i e generators have k 1 that are classical generators with isometric centers not contained circles of the minimal element of trace then we define degenerate types i ii iii iv for the given sequence these are the obstructions to existence of classical schottky group degenerate types becomes classical when hausdorff siemsnion is suffi ciently small we show that for each of the degenerate types i ii ii iv given as obstructions to the existence of classical schottky group in a sequence of schottky groups when the hausdorff dimension d n 0 it must become classical schottky group in particular all the obstruc tions can be removed degeneracy resolved when the hausdorff di mension is sufficiently small the techniques used to resolve degenera cies is based generator selection process and trace hausdorff dimension growth estimates 5 non collapsing fixed points subspaces based on degeneracies resolu tions for sufficiently hausdorff dimension we then prove that theorem 1 1 holds for jk schottky subspaces for 0 here the schottky subspace jk is defined as collection of schottky groups up to con jugation that have a generating sets s with uniform lower bound on zs bounded separations of it s fixed point sets this is proved by induction on k and removal of obstructions to classical ness when hausdorff dimension is small removing uniform lower fixed points bound constraint we classify pos sible types of fixed points collapses into collapsing fixed points i and collapsing fixed points ii given a sequence of n with d n 0 we show that both types of collapsing fixed points i and ii we must have either uniform lower bound on d n z n sum of hausdorff dimensions and fixed points bounds or n will contain a subsequence of classical schottky groups this is done by analyzing fixed points distributions based on estimates of isometric circles centers of generating sets when the hausdorff dimensions is sufficiently small theorem 1 1 holds for fixed rank based on the removability of the constraint of uniform lower bound z and result on jk we show that theorem 1 1 is true for rank k whenever k 1 is true rank extension finally we prove rank extension based on fixed rank result we show that if theorem 1 1 holds for rank k i e there ex ists bounds k then for sufficiently small hausdorff dimension k must be independent on k this is proved by using rank length growth es timates lemma 3 4 the rank length estimates is growth estimates that relate the rank number k and norms of the traces with respect to other generators with respect to hausdorff dimension 1 2 organization of the paper section 2 is used to define and lists global notations that will be used through out the paper in section 3 we state a strong form of theorem 1 1 given in 15 for rank k free groups acting on hyperbolic space note that the original results of 15 are state for pinched negatively curved manifolds this will be used for generators selection processes see corollary 3 2 in section 4 given any sequence of rank k schottky groups n with bounded z n see 6 section 2 we shall prove estimates that will enable us to bounds locations of fixed points of a given sequence of generators of n in terms of the haus dorff dimensions d n of n these estimates will be used in the generators set selection procedure in section 5 we will derive sufficient conditions for a given set of k generators to be a classical generators this is done in the hyperbolic ball space b sections 6 to 11 given a sequence of rank k schottky groups which is k 1 classical and of strictly decreasing hausdorff dimen sion to 0 we show that all types of degeneracies can be resolved hence all degenerate types will leading to classical schottky groups section 12 to 14 we remove non collapsing fixed points constraint in section 15 we extend from fixed rank k to finitely generated by using already established results in earlier sections section 16 we finish the proofs of our main theorem by simple standard topological arguments acknowledgements the author would like to express appreciation to benson farb peter sarnak for giving me opportunity to discuss this work in details i would also like to express gratitude to peter shalen marc culler dick canary for many thoughts on this paper finally i like to express sincere appreciation to the referee 2 notations let psl 2 c be a rank k schottky group generated by 1 2 k with 1 having fixed points 0 note that by our choice here all generating set are minimal i e generating set of k elements for given rank k schottky group asssume that is a loxodromic element having fixed points 6 for a we write in matrix form as a b c d with det 1 we will set the following notations and definitions throughout the rest of the paper notation 1 denote the critical exponent of by d which is equal the hausdorff dimension of see section 3 r the radius of isometric circles of dc a c 7 we will define two different ways to denotes the two fixed points of z l z u the two fixed points of in c with z l z u and z z the two fixed points with z given by quadratic formula with subscripts corresponding to tr 2 4 note that we always take the principle branch for the square roots of complex numbers l is the axis of t is the translation length of z i min z i z i 1 z i 1 z i geometrically z i measure how far apart do the fixed points of i are in the conformal boundary c of h 3 this will be used subsequently for rate of convergence of fixed points with respect to norm of the trace for instance it is use for estimates in section 4 z 1 i min z i z i z i z i 1 z i 1 for all 2 i k whenever we need to emphases that i is element of the generating set we will also denote z 1 i by z 1 2 k to explicitly write out the generators set geometrically z 1 i or z 1 2 k measures relative position of the fixed points of i with respect to the fixed points of 1 in the conformal boundary c these relative positions will be used to make selection of generating sets for 0 we say that z if there exists a generating set 1 2 k of such that z 1 2 k given any two sequences of real numbers pn qn we use the notation pn qn iff there exists 0 such that 1 lim inf pnqn lim sup pn qn given two real numbers a b set da b z c a z b given a loxodromic denote by d schottky disks of set d d d note that schottky disks are defined to be circular disks such that interior d interior d also note that it is true that any loxodromic element always have schottky disks see proposition 5 5 but distinct elements generally don t have disjointed schottky disks in addition schottky disks may not always be isometric 8 circle disks since not all loxodromic elements have disjoint isometric circles but for sufficiently large norm of the trace and control on z once can always take the schottky disks to be isometric circular disks disks bounded by isometric circles notation 2 let n psl 2 c be a sequence of loxodromic transfor mations let pn be a sequence of complex numbers and qn a sequence of positive real numbers we write z n pn qn if there exists n such that for every n n we have at least one of the following holds i z n pn qn ii z n pn qn 3 actions on hyperbolic space let be a finitely generated non elementary kleinian group the critical exponent of is defined as the unique positive number such that the poincare series of given by e s dist x x is divergent if s and convergent if s if the poincare series diverges at s then is said to be divergent bishop jones showed that d for all analytically finite non elementary kleinian groups in fact if is topologically tame h 3 homeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary then d hence it follows from ian agol 1 and independently danny calegari and dave gabai 8 proof of tameness conjecture that d for all finitely generated non elementary kleinian groups note that agol s proof of tamness conjecture extends to pinched negatively curved manifolds the critical exponent and hence hausdorff dimension is a geometrically rigid object in the sense that a decrease in d corresponds to a decrease in geometric complexity of the group our following results are indications of geometric complexity we state the following theorem from 15 which provides the relation between the negatively curved free group action and the critical exponent 9 theorem 3 1 hou 15 let be a free non elementary kleinian group of rank k with free generating set s and x h 3 then s 1 1 exp d dist x x 1 2 in particular we have at least k 1 distinct elements ij 1 j k 1 of s that satisfies dist x ijx log 3 d and at least one element ij with dist x ijx log 2 k 1 d the following is a useful corollary of theorem 3 1 stated here for the case of is a free group of rank 2 corollary 3 2 let s 1 2 be a generating set for a free non elementary kleinian group let x h 3 then dist x 2 x 1 d log ed dist x 1 x 3 ed dist x 1 x 1 corollary 3 3 let s 1 2 be a generating set for a free non elementary kleinian group let x h 3 let m be any integer then at least one of the elements of s m 1 2 m 11 2 satisfies dist x x log 3 d we will need a much stronger estimates which will relates both the rank of and elements of generators this is needed in order to prove extension theorem from fixed rank to arbitrary rank lemma 3 4 rank length growth estimate let s 1 2 k be a generating set for a free non elementary kleinian group of rank k let x h 3 then for every i there exists some j 6 i such that dist x jx 1 d log 2 k 3 ed dist x ix 2 k 1 ed dist x ix 1 proof assume otherwise s 1 1 ed dist

fixed points and haus dorff dimension the relationships of fixed points of generating sets of a given sequence of schottky groups n and the hausdorff dimensions of n will be stated in this section proofs of these can be found in 16 which is stated for general rank k the main is idea is to find a relationship between the distribution function of the fixed points of one of the generators in terms of the translation length growth of the other generators and the hausdorff dimension of its limit set by obtaining these types of relationships we will be able to construct a new set of generators of the given generating set of generators so that it will have predetermined distribution of its fixed points these newly constructed set of generators will be a crucial part in our proof of the main theorem let n be a sequence of rank k schottky groups with dn 0 generated by 1 n i n psl 2 c 2 i k in h 3 with 1 n 1 n 0 0 1 1 n 1 n 1 set i n ai n bi n ci n di n throughout this section we assume that there exists m 0 such that t 1 n m for all n set dn d n let tr trace first we will state corollary 3 2 in the trace form proposition 4 1 16 suppose there exists 0 such that z i n there exists 0 depending on such that tr i n 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn for large n proof let ti n be the translation length of i n and ri n dist l 1 n l i n let xn be a point on axis of 1 n which is the nearest point of l 1 n to l i n by triangle inequality ti n dist xn i nxn 2 ri n here the triangle inequality is dist xn i nxn dist i nxn i nyn dist i nyn yn dist xn yn where yn is the closest point on l i n to l 1 n note for sufficiently large ti n we have for some positive constant c 0 tr 2 i n ceti n now for large n from corollary 3 2 tr 2 i n c 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 1 dn e 2 dist l 1 n l i n 11 the first factor on the right hand side of the last inequality is by taken expo nential of inequality ti n dist xn i nxn 2 ri n and using corollary 3 2 for edist xn i nxn the second factor of right hand side comes from the equality e 2 ri n e 2 dist l 1 n l i n now z i n implies that dist l 1 n l i n m for some m 0 hence the result follows we will also need to state the rank k form of the above estimates that relates the rank of as well proposition 4 2 let n be a sequence of rank k free group generated by 1 n k n with i n having fixed points 0 suppose there exists 0 such that z 1 n k n there exists j 6 i and 0 depending on such that tr j n 2 k 3 i n 2 dn 2 k 1 i n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn for large n corollary 4 3 we can state proposition 4 2 with condition z 1 n k n droped as follows tr 2 j n c 2 k 3 i n 2 dn 2 k 1 i n 2 dn 1 1 dn e 2 dist l i n l j n remark 4 1 a without assuming bounds on z i n we can state above proposition 4 1 as tr 2 i n c 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 1 dn e 2 dist l 1 n l i n if dist l 1 n l 1 n i n then there exists 0 such that tr i n 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn for large n 12 following lemmas and corollaries are given in 16 as lemma 4 2 corollary 4 4 and 4 6 note that all these results in 16 are originally stated for general rank k the proofs are verbatim to the proofs give in 16 with obvious notation modifications hence omitted the results are estimates of convergence

note that each given ki n li n provides a nielsen transformation of the gener ators we will determine what ki n li n are needed during the proof in later part of the paper the idea is that eventually we will need to choose some collection of generators which are nielsen transformations of 1 n i n based on the values of ki n li n determination on the constraints of ki n li n will require extensive analysis of both fixed points and centers of circles of gener ators here the definition of ki n li n is to measures the distance between fixed points and centers of circles of generators relative to ki n li n indices ki n li n are introduced to determine relationship between fixed points convergence rates with respect to nielsen transformation of i n by 1 n proofs of following statements can be found in 16 lemma 4 4 16 suppose there exists 0 m 0 such that z 1 n i n and t 1 n m for all n let ki n li n be any integers such that t 1 nki n t 1 n li n m then there exists a constant 0 such that ki n li n tr n ln knn for large n note that in general one could have t i n 0 which implies that we could have ki n li n in fact this is one of the degenerate cases that we will consider in section 7 corollary 4 5 16 suppose there exists 0 m 0 such that z 1 n i n and t n m for all n let ki n li n be any integers such that t 1 nki n t 1 n li n m then for any 0 there exists 0 such that if dn then ki

dn lemma 4 8 16 suppose there exists 0 m 0 such that z 1 n i n and t 1 n m for all n let ki n li n to be any integers such that t 1 nki n t 1 n li n m then there exists a constant 1 2 0 such that 1 tr

we include it here to demonstrate relations between fixed points and hausdorff dimensions lemma 4 9 16 suppose there exists 0 m 0 such that z 1 n i n and m 1 t 1 n m for all n let ki n li n to be any integers such that t 1 n ki n t 1 nli n m then for at least one j 0 1 and any inte gers k i n l i n with ki n k i n li n l i n j we have z k i n 1 n i n l i n 1 n z k i n 1 n i n l i n 1 n dn tr i n for all n sufficiently large the following observation can be seen from the proof of lemma 4 4 16 for a more rough upper bound of fixed points of ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n to ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n and ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n then we can relax the conditions in lemma 4 4 and state as follows remark 4 2 b suppose that z i n z i n c and ci n li n ki n 1 n then z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1

conditions that will be sufficient for the given sequence to contain a subsequence which will be classical schottky groups for small enough hausdorff dimensions denote the unit ball model of hyperbolic 3 space by b distb set b h 3 the stereographic hyperbolic isometry let n to be a sequences of k generated schottky groups for a loxodromic element of psl 2 c acting on the unit ball b model of hyperbolic 3 space denote by s r and s 1 r the isometric spheres of euclidean radius r of we set as the multiplier of in the upper space model h 3 for r 0 set cr as the circle in c about origin of radius r we will denote the north pole of b by e 0 0 1 proposition 5 1 16 let be a loxodromic element of psl 2 c acting on b with axis passing through the origin and fixed points on north and south poles then s r b s 1 r b maps to c 1 c lemma 5 2 let 1 n 2 n k n be generators for schottky groups n in the upper half space model h 3 with tr i n and n 1 n 0 0 11 n 1 n 1 suppose one of the following set of conditions holds there exists 1 such that for large n we have 1 n and 1 n 1 z i n l z i n u 1 n and lim inf n 1 z i n u 1 n tr i n 1 z i n l 1 n 1 tr i n 0 z i n z i n tr i n tr i n tr i n i 6 i or there exists 0 and for large n we have i n and 1 z 1 n l z 1 n u and 15 lim inf n 1 z i n u tr i n 1 z i n l 1 tr 1 n 0 z i n z i n tr i n tr i n tr i n i 6 i then there exists a subsequence such that form large 1 1 nm 2 nm k nm are classical generators for nm in the unit ball model b proof suppose that there exists some subsequence 1 ni 2 ni k ni which satisfies the first given set of above conditions let us first assume for large i min 2 j k z j ni u z j ni l 0 let ri j i be the euclidean radii of isometric spheres of generator 1 1 ni and 1 j ni respectively for 2 j k since that 4 cosh t 1 j ni tr 2 1 j ni implies that there exists some c 0 such that e t 1 j ni c tr 2 1 j ni by 1 j i cosh dist o l 1 j ni sinh 1 2 t 1 j ni 3 p 175 we have that 1 j i sinh 12 t 1 j ni so for large i there exists some c 0 with that 1 j i ce 1 2 t 1 j ni therefore there exists some 1 0 such that j i 1 tr j ni 1 for large i since for z w c 1 z 2 z e 2 and 1 z 1 w 1 z 1 2 1 w 1 2 z w this implies for large i and xj i c z j ni u and yj i c 1 ni j i 1 xj i 1 yj i 2 1 xj i e yj i e tr j ni xj i yj i since 1 ni there exists 2 0 such that xj i e yj i e 2 and lim i j i 1 xj i 1 yj i lim i 2 1 2 tr j ni xj i yj i 0 for 2 j k similarly there exists 3 0 such that for wj i c z j ni l and zj i c 1 ni 1 lim i j i 1 wj i 1 zj i lim i 2 1 3 tr j ni wj i zj i 0 for 2 j k 16 also there exists 4 0 such that for j 6 i and fj i c z j ni u c z j ni l and gj i c z j ni u c z j ni l and tr j i tr j i lim i j i j i 1 fj i 1 gj i 2 j i 1 fj i 1 gj i lim i 2 1 4 tr j ni fj i gj i 0 for 2 j k therefore it follows for large i and proposition 5 1 we have the isometric spheres s 1 1 ni ri s 1 11 ni ri s 1 j ni i s 1 1 j ni i and s 1 j ni i s 1 1 j ni i s 1 j ni i s 1 1 j ni i are disjoint for all 2 j j k remark 5 3 we see from above proof that without the assumption of j ni then we can t put bounds on xj i e yj i e but since xj i e yj i e z j ni u 1 1 ni 1 for xj i c z ni u yj i c 1 ni and xj i e yj i e z j ni l 1 1 ni 1 1 for xj i c z j ni l yj i c 1 ni 1 therefore we can restate the condition as 1 n 1 z j n l z j n u 1 n and lim inf n z j n u 1 1 n 1 z j n u 1 n tr j n z j n l 1 1 n 1 1 z j n l 1 n 1 tr j n 0 z j n z j n tr j n tr j n tr j n j 6 j next assume for some j we have that z j ni u z j ni l 0 then with this assumption we can do a much sharper estimate of the lower bounds on cosh dist j l j ni which is the distance between the point j on the vertical j axis and the translation axis of j ni in the space h 3 eventhough a much weaker lower bounds will be sufficient for our case for any given two points h 1 z 1 1 h 2 z 2 2 h 3 recall that the hyperbolic distance is provided by equation cosh dist h 1 h 2 z 1 z 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 17 by z j ni u z j ni l 0 also 1 z j ni l z j ni u we can esti mate cosh dist j l j ni by using the above formula for z 1 1 l 1 ni and z 2 2 l j ni since for large i we have z 1 z 2 z j ni l 1 2 z j ni l 1 2 z j ni u z j ni l 2 1 2 z j ni u z j ni u z j ni l hence for large i we have cosh dist j l j ni z j ni l 2 z j ni l 1 2 z j ni u z j ni l 2 z j ni u z j ni u z j ni l 1 since 1 z j ni l z j ni u and z j ni u z j ni l 0 we have for large i there exits 0 such that cosh dist j l j ni z j ni u z j ni l also by 1 z j ni l z j ni u and 1 ni there exists 0 such that 1 z j ni u 1 z j ni l since 1 z j ni u 1 z j ni l 1 z j ni u 1 z j ni l z j ni u z j ni l we have 1 z j ni u 1 z j ni l z j ni u z j ni l from 1 j i cosh dist o l 1 j ni sinh 1 2 t 1 j ni and the above estimates implies that for i large there exists 5 0 such that j i 5 1 z j ni u 1 z j ni l tr j ni 1 hence there exists 6 0 such that for xj i c z j ni u yj i c 1 ni lim i j i 1 xj i 1 yj i lim i 6 1 z j ni u 1 z j ni l tr j ni xj i yj i 0 similarly there exists 7 0 such that for wj i c z

1 1 ni r 1 i s 1 11 ni r 1 i are disjointed from s 1 j ni j i s 1 1 j ni j i also since tr j ni implies s 1 j ni j i and s 1 1 j ni j i are disjointed for i is large enough and additionally we have s 1 j ni j i s 1 1 j ni j i and s 1 j ni j i s 1 1 j ni j i are also disjointed for 2 j j k therefore we get first part of our lemma for our second part of the lemma it is easily seen it can be proved in the same way as first part remark 5 4 during the course of our proof we realize that when 1 n 1 then we can certainly relax our first set of conditions for 2 j k in the above lemma 1 n 1 z j n l z j n u 1 n and lim inf n z j n l z j n u z j n u 1 n tr j n z j n l z j n u z j n l 1 n 1 tr j n 0 next we consider when tr j n c for all n in this case we can t use the isometric circles but instead we can employ the following proposition to get disjoint circles for i n proposition 5 5 for any given loxodromic transformation with fixed points 6 0 and mutiplier 2 we can find disjoint circles so r so r of center o radius r and center o radius r respectively such that interior so r interior so r and r r z z 2 2 1 note that since 1 so by this equality for r r we have a upper bound as r r z z 1 1 proof we first conjugates into mobius transformation have fixed points 0 first we look at circles s 0 1 s 0 the transformation x x 1 x 1 maps the fixed points of consists of 0 to 1 1 as fixed points 19 respectively additionally it also maps s 0 1 s 0 to sz 1 r 1 sz 1 r 1 respec tively now we will use basic formulas to determine the values of z 1 z 1 r 1 r 1 see page 91 of 21 by 21 we have r 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 r 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 this gives r 1 r 1 4 2 1 the distance between the centers is z 1 z 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 since 2 1 2 1 2 0 implies sz 1 r 1 sz 1 r 1 are disjoint by conjugating 1 with x x z z z z we map the fixed points 1 1 to 2 z z z 2 z z z since x is a translation transformation i e eu clidian isometry the circles are then mapped to circles sz 2 r 2 sz 2 r 2 which have same radius as before and also preserves the disjointness as before then by conjugating 1 1 with x z z 2 sends 2 z z z 2 z z z to points z z and also maps the circles to sz 3 r 3 sz 3 r 3 we have that r 3 r 3 z z 2 1 and also the disjointness is preserved also we have 1 1 1 therefore we get that the sum of the radius of our disjointed circles are given by r 3 r 3 z z 2 2 1 20 for a given we will denote the set of disjoint disks d d such that d so r d so r with the convention that z d and z d we also set r z z 1 1 for rest of the sections proposition 5 6 given a sequence n n with dn 0 such that tr n c assume that n have fixed points 0 and n 1 n n n then either n n or n 1 n n is classical schottky group for large n proof this is a direct consequence theorem 1 1 of 16 and the particular choice of generator is given by the proof of theorem 6 1 of 16 from proposition 5 6 statement let us assume that its true in k 1 rank as well and we will from the k 1 rank prove that it is also true in rank k to do so we will first state the k 1 version of the above proposition proposition 5 7 given a sequence of k 1 generators 1 n k 1 n with dn 0 such that tr 1 n c assume that 1 n have fixed points 0 and 1 n 1 j n j n 1 n then 1 n a 11 n 2 n ak 1 1 n j n is classical schottky group for large n and some aj 0 1 denote g n n inf z n z z d n note that for a sequence of generators n n with z n z n c and z n 6 d n suppose that g n nr 1 n then n n generates a classical schottky group for large n 6 degenerate types this section we classify all possible behaviors such that a given sequence n of schottky groups with d n 0 will not eventually contain a subsequence of classical schottky groups the obstructions that a sequence of n to contain any classical schottky group will be called degeneracies analyzing degeneracies rely on the analysis of the behaviors of centers of isometric circles of generators to do this analysis we must characterize all possible dynamics here dynamic refers to behaviors with respect to decreas ing hausdorff dimension of sequence of generators according to behaviors of their centers of circles to do so we first consider dichotomized behaviors and then utilize them to show general result more precisely we show that each of the dichotomized degenerate behavior will lead into a classical schottky 21 group for sufficiently large n the dichotomization of degeneracies are into four types as typei type ii type iii type iv given in the following in addition each of these types of degeneracies will have several sub types which are stated later on separately definition 6 1 for 0 we set jk jk z for some recall that jk denotes schottky space of rank k here denotes equiva lence class of and jk is just collection of schottky groups that have some generating set with uniform lower bounds on z by under conjugation let us assume that there exists a sequence n jk of nonclassical schottky groups with strictly decreasingdn 0 set n 1 n 2 n k n with that z 1 n 2 n k n we arrange the generators so tr i n tr i 1 n there are two possibilities i there exists a subsequence such that tr 1 n ii tr 1 n m for some m 0 case i is trivial since tr i nj as n for all 1 i k it follows from z i nj k nj there must exists n such that i nj i nj becomes classical schottky groups for j n a contradic tion now we consider case ii we work in upper space model h 3 conjugate 1 n k n by a mobius transformation into 1 n 1 n 0 0 1 1 n with 1 n 1 denote j n aj n bj n cj n dj n since tr 1 n m implies 1 n m for some m 0 it follows from proposition 4 1 and dn 0 we have tr j n by replacing i n with 1 i n if necessary we can assume i n i n 2 j k since z 1 n k n there exists 1 2 3 4 0 such that 1 z j n l z j n u 2 and 3 z j n l z j n u 4 it follows from lemma 4 4 1 j n j n 2 and 3 limn j n j n 4 for each n and i 2 choose integers ki n li n such that 1 i n 2 ki n 1 n 21 n 1 i n 2 li n 1 n 21 n we consider the generating set 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n kk n 1 n k n lk n 1 n denote these new generators by i n for i 2 22 by passing to subsequence and considering inverses if necessary we have can assume i n 2 li n 1 n i n 2 ki n 1 n definition 6 2 standard form given a set of generators s 1 k of schottky group we say s is of standard form if up to conjugation by mobius transformation z 1 0 and 1 i 2 1 1 i 2 1 2 i k definition 6 3 k 1 classical given rank k schottky group we say is k 1 classical if every rank k 1 subgroup of g is a classical schottky group in section 11 2 we will show that given a sequence of n schottky group which is k 1 classical and d n 0 we can always choose a subsequence of generators s n such that it s k 1 classical of standard form another k 1 classical sequence called normal sequence one can choose is given next which is based on location of fixed points the idea is that when the hausdorff dimension is sufficiently small then both normal sequence and standard form sequence coincide definition 6 4 let n be a sequence of schottky groups with generating set s n 1 n 2 n k n such that 1 n have fixed points 0 we say s n is a normal sequence of generating sets if up to conjugation by mobius transformation all isometric circles of j k are strictly bounded between 1 and 1 n 2 for 2 j k and large n proposition 6 5 normal sequence let n be a sequence of schottky groups which is k 1 classical with d n 0 then there exists a normal subsequence of generating set s n we use same index for subsequence proof since n is k 1 classical we can choose a sequence of generating set sn so that every pair 1 n j n is classical for 1 j k we assume by same convention that 1 n is of minimal trace conjugate 1 n to have fixed points 0 and denote the new sequence by the same notation it follows from corollary 4 3 and remark 4 isometric circles of j n have radius 0 for all 2 j k since all fixed points are strictly bounded between 1 and 1 n 2 the result follows the behaviors of elements of our sequence of generators are done accord ing to location of their centers of circles of j n for 2 j k lets assume we 23 have a sequence of generating sets which is k 1 classical of standard form then we can categorize the obstructions of the sequence to contain classical schottky groups by disjointness of circles of j n for 2 j k to circles of 1 n definition 6 6 degenerate types using above notations let n be a se quence of rank k schottky groups which is k 1 classical with dn 0 let sn be a sequence of generating sets which is k 1 classical of standard form degenerate types are given by type i double boundary degeneracy i n 2 ki n 1 n i n 2 li n 1 n 0 type ii single boundary degeneracy i n 2 ki n 1 n 1 n 2 0 type iii elliptical degeneracy i n 2 ki n 1 n 1 type iv bounded i n 2 ki n 1 n i n 2 li n 1 n c and i n 2 ki n 1 n 1 n 2 c in the next four sections we will show that each of these degenerate types will lead to classical schottky group for large n 7 bounded type iv we show this type of degeneracy is classical for large n we use the same notation index for subsequences for large n there exists 1 1 n 1 such that maxi i n 2 ki n 1 n 2 let n be the mobius transformation that fixes 0 defined by x x x c let 1 2 be given as mini limn i n 2 li n 1 n then mini i n 1 24 and maxi i n 1 let tr i n min tr i n it follows from lemma 4 4 for n large max max i z i n 1 i n 1 max i z i n 1 i n 1 tr i n hence there exists 0 such that z i n 1 z i n 1 tr i n and 1 z i n 1 1 z i n 1 1 tr i n this implies that there exist 0 such that z i n 1 hence by applying proposition 4 1 to the generators 1 n 1 i n 1 implies tr i n 1 set 1 2 then for sufficiently large n we have 1 n 1 z i n 1 l z i n 1 u and obviously lim n 1 z i n 1 u tr i n 1 0 lim n 1 z i n 1 l 1 tr i n 1 0 also by s n z i n z j n tr i n for tr i n tr j n therefore 1 n 1 2 n 1 k n 1 satisfies the second set of conditions of lemma 5 2 and so by lemma 5 2 these will be classical gen erators for large n a contradiction 8 double boundary degeneracy type i we show this type of degeneracy is classical for large n this case we need to further break into two possibilities based on whether 1 n converging into a elliptical element or a nonellipitical element by passing to a subsequence if necessary we have two possibilities type i 1 1 n 2 1 is monotonically decreasing to 0 type i 2 there exists 1 such that 1 n for large n 25 8 1 type i 1 in the degeneration into elliptical case we need to consider whether the collapsing of fixed points is at must faster rate relative to collapsing of fixed points to circles i ii here we either have i lim sup n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 or ii lim inf n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 8 1 1 case ii in this subcase we show that under appropriate nielsen transformation and conjugation we can reduce to case i hence it would be enough just to consider subcase i which is done next take mobius transformation n defined by i n x x ki n n i n li n 1 n set n x be the i n with maximal i n 2 i k we conjugate ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n by n consider n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 1 since by factor out 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 21 n in ii lim inf n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 1 n 2 1 ki n n i n li n 1 n 1 1 n 2 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 21 n 21 n 1 lim inf n 1 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 21 n 21 n 1 since li n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 21 n ki n n i n 1 1 n and n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 1 n 1 n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 1 n 1 n we have lim inf n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 1 n 21 n 1 giving lim sup n n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 1 n 1 n 1 1 n 2 n ki n 1 n 1 n li n 1 1 n 1 n 1 1 1 26 the generator n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 1 n 1 n 1 satisfies i hence replacing the gen erators if necessary we can always assume the generators satisfy i and without lost of generality we will assume that 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n satisfies i 8 1 2 consider i here we must consider whether the collapsing is bounded from below or not i 1 i 2 in this case we have either i 1 lim sup n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 0 or i 2 lim sup n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 0 first we present the proof for i 1 8 1 3 consider i 1 lemma 8 1 there exists c 0 such that dist l 1 n l ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n log c 1 n 2 1 proof we first show that 1 tr i n 1 n 2 1 0 from proposition 4 1 we have lim 1 tr i n 1 n 2 1 lim 1 n 2 dn 1 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 1 2 dn 1 2 dn and for large n we have 1 n 2 dn 1 1 n 2 1 which implies that for some 0 lim 1 tr i n 1 n 2 1 lim 1 n 2 1 1 2 dn 2 dn 0 27 it follows from lemma 4 4 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n tr i n 1 z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1

for some m 0 hence for large n there exists 0 such that z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 1 m 1 tr i n 1 n 2 1 for the upper bounds we have z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n

tr i n 1 z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n l z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n u 1 n 2 2 tr i n 1 28 and above estimates for z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n u z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n l we have cosh dist l 1 n l ki n 1 n i n li n

reference we set the mobius transformations defined earlier as n 1 x next we present the proof for i 2 this case requires a bit more compu tation this is due to the fact that we need to address the possibility that collapsing of fixed points imply that the distance between axises of i n and 1 n will go to so we can t conclude that tr i n hence we will use different set of circles given by proposition 5 5 to compare rates 8 1 4 case i 2 there exists ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 such that ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n kn 1 n n if lim supn ki n 11 n i n li n 1 n 1 0 then with the same index notation for subsequence there exists a subsequence such that lim inf n ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 0 this implies by lemma 4 4 lim infn z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n

lim n ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 1 n 2 1 0 this can be seen as follows since 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 we have either 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 0 or 1 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 0 assume that the latter inequality holds this is equivalent to i 1 and we follows the same idea used in i 1 set mobius transformations n 2 x 11 n 1 n 1 x with n 1 n 2 1 2 1 n 2 then 1 n n 2 ki

tr ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 it follows that for large n 1 n 1 ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n and 0 lim n 1 tr ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 1 1 tr ki

consider the case that ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 33 we first consider the growth conditions that relates between 1 n ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n and ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n to do so we do some two generators estimates fix a i that satisfies ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 we first normalize so that ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 since our estimates will be in terms of traces so for simplicity we can take li n 0 and set ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 by conjugation with a desired mobius transformation let fi n be the mobius transformations given by fi n x 1 i n z ki n 1 1 n i n x z ki n 1 1 n i n z ki n 1 1 n

ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n tr i n tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 for n large in fact we only need the lower bound for tr i n proof since 1 n 2 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 ki n 1

recall ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 and by lemma 4 8 more precisely by equation 1 in the proof of lemma 4 8 and tr i n ci n tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n tr i n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2

z i nj i nj 1 lim j tr i nj 2 4 tr i nj 1 since tr i nj implies that the isometric circles of i nj are disjoint for large n since i nj i nj are centers of these isometric circles and so by disjointness the radius of these isometric circles must be i n i nj 2 for large j in addition each isometric circle contains one of the fixed point z i nj l z i nj u by our convention z i nj l z i nj

norm of the trace of nielsen transformed generators i n with respect to the rate the generators 1 n degenerates into elliptical elements i e 1 n decreases to 1 the required estimate is given by next lemma 37 lemma 8 4 assume that there exists a m 0 such that m f i n 1 n then there exists n 0 such that 1 n 2 dn 1 tr i n 2 dn 2 dn 1 for n n proof use matrix representation we can write i n a i n b i n ci n d i n note that i n 1 so c i n d i n we have i n a i n b i n di n d i n by i n 1 and our assumption of the lemma m i n 1 1 n 2 1 we have m 21 n 1 i n 1 m by tr i n and as in the proof of lemma 8 3 we have lim n z i n z i n i n 1 lim n tr i n 2 4 tr i n 1 since z i n z i n d i n 1 tr 2 i n 4 it follows that we have for some 0 and large n that tr i n d i n tr i n 1 n 2 1 1 let e be the euler number if there exists a subsequence such that limj i nj e 1 then 1 e 1 z i nj z i nj 1 e 1 for large nj otherwise we let mn 0 be integers defined as 1 1 mn 1 1 n 1 1 mn from this definition we have limn 1 n mn limn 1 m 1 n mn e then there exists n 0 such that for n n we have mn 1 n i n mn 1 n i n i n 1 n mn 1 e 1 and mn 1 n i n mn 1 n i n i n 1 n mn 1 e 1 38 hence it follows from lemma 4 4 there exists 0 such that 1 z mn 1 n i n z mn 1 n i n therefore by setting mn 0 for the subsequence with limj i nj e 1 we can always assume that for large n 1 z mn 1 n i n z mn 1 n i n since z mn 1 n i n z mn 1 n i n tr 2 mn 1 n i n 4 d i n mn 1 n we have tr i n tr mn 1 n i n tr i n 1 n 2 1 since 1 z mn 1 n i n z mn 1 n i n we have dist l 1 n l mn 1 n i n for some 0 by remark 4 1 a of proposition 4 1 applied to 1 n mn 1 n i n we have tr mn 1 n i n 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn and above bound for tr mn 1 n i n we have tr i n 1 1 n 2 1 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn 1 n 2 1 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn 1 n 2 dn 1 1 1 2 dn the last inequality implies that 1 n 2 1 1 n 2 dn 1 tr i n 2 dn 2 dn 1 next we are ready to take care the subcase when f i nj 1 nj m 39 proposition 8 5 suppose that there exists a m 0 such that m f i n 1 n then 1 n k 2 n 1 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n kk n 1 1 n k n lk n 1 n are classical generators for large n to prove proposition 8 5 when lim supn tr ki n 1 1 n i n we use dis joint non isometric circles for ki n 1 1 n i n based on the following lemma proof proposition 8 5 first assume that lim supn tr ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n let soi n ri n so i n r i n be the disjoint circles for ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n given by proposition 5 5 we will show that limn rn r n 1 n 2 1 0 note that lim n ri n r i n 1 n 2 1 lim n z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 i n i n 2 1 1 n 2 1 by tr ki n 11 n i n li n 1 n c for some c 0 we have lim n z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 c i n 2 1 1 n 2 1 since lim supn tr ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n and lim supn 1 n ki n 1 we have by lemma 4 8 z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 tr i n by proposition 4 1 tr i n 2 dn dn 1 n 2 dn 3 1 n 2 dn 1 4 dn 1 n 2 1 the last inequality follows from 1 n 2 dn 1 1 n 2 1 for large n by our assumptiom that m i n 1 i n 2 1 and lemma 8 4 we have lim n ri n r i n 1 n 2 1 lim n 4 dn 1 m tr i n 1 tr i n 2 dn tr i n 2 dn 1 2 dn since tr i n tr i n we have lim n 4 dn 1 2 dn 1 2 dnm tr i n dn 6 4 dn 1 1 2 dn 0 40 now the circles soi n ri n contains one of z ki n 11 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 1 n i n li n 1 n and so i n r i n contains the other fixed point and since kn 1 n n 1 and kn 1 n n 1 it follows from lemma 4 4 we must have soi n ri n so i n r i n contained in the region between 1 1 n and 1 n for large n hence we have classical generators for large n now if there exists a subsequence such that tr ki n 11 n i n li n 1 n then 1 n kk n 1 1 n k n lk n 1 n satisfies conditions of lemma 5 2 hence the case i 2 is complete next we consider type i 2 this is rela tively straightforward and parallel to case type i 1 but we provide another short proof in the following 8 2 type i 2 for the type i 2 it can be seen that we can certainly follow similarly procedure as given in our proof of the type i 1 and just simply do some modifications in fact many of our previous estimates will be became much simpler by 1 n hence all estimates that requires bounds on 1 n 2 1 1 are trivial to avoid much repetition of our previous proof of the type i 1 we therefore present a alternative and somewhat much shorter proof of type i 2 lemma 8 6 let n n be a sequence of loxodromic transformations with fixed points of n be 0 suppose z n z n 0 and c 1 z n c then there exists 0 such that dist l n l n log z n z n proof by using hyperbolic distance formula and since z n z n 0 and z

for subsequence such that tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n then by our assumption of type i 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 and 1 n 1 we have for large n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n and 0 lim n 1 tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 n 1 1 tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 n 2 1 n by lemma 4 4 1 n k 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n kk n 1 n k n lk n 1 n satisfies the second set of conditions of lemma 5 2 hence classical otherwise we have tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c for some c 0 since ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 and ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 by lemma 4 4 we have z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 now by remark 4 1 a and tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c we must have dist l 1 n l ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n this implies that z kn n n z kn n n 0 more precisely we have let so ri n so r i n be the circles given by proposition 5 5 proposition 8 7 tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c for some c 0 then we must have ri n r i n 0 proof first note that as we have showed tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c implies z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 0 and z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 set i n x x z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n x z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n let ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n be the mutiplier of i n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 i n by remark 4 1 a applied to i n i n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 i n we have 1 n 2 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 3 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 1 1 dn e 2 dist l i n 1 n 1 i n l i n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 i n 42 since z i n 1 n 1 i n z i n 1 n 1 i n 1 z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n we have z i n 1 n 1 i n 1 and z i n 1 n 1 i n z i n 1 n 1 i n 1 z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 0 by lemma 8 6 we have for large n dist l i n 1 n 1 i n l i n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 i n log z i n 1 n 1 i n z i n 1 n 1 i n this implies that for large n 1 n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 3 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn z i n 1 n 1 i n z i n 1 n 1 i n 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 3 1 2 dn z i n 1 n 1 i n z i n 1 n 1 i n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 1 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 3 1 2 dn rn r n 2 c z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n the last inequality follows from proposition 5 5 and ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c the second inequality in the above calculations follows from that ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c and for large n we have ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 1 1 2 dn ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 1 since 1 n m for some m hence by we have ri n r i n 2 c m z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 2 dn 3 1 2 dn 2 c m 4 1 2 dn 0 43 now we can continue and finish the proof for tr ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n c by proposition 8 7 and 1 n 1 this is condition of type i 2 we have ri n r i n 1 n 2 1 0 since the circles soi n ri n contains one of z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n z ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n and so i n r i n contains the other fixed point and ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 and by con dition i 2 we have ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n 1 it follows from lemma 4 4 we must have soi n ri n so i n r i n contained in the region between 1 1 n and 1 n for large n hence we have classical generators for large n this completes the proof for type i 2 9 single boundary degeneracy type ii we show this type of degeneracy is classical by reducing to type i for large n set mobius transformations n 3 x min 2 i k 1 2 i n 1 ki n 1 n x and con sider the generators n 3 1 n kk n 1 1 n k n lk n 1 n 1 n 3 then we have 1 n 3 ki n 1 1 n i n 1 n 3 n 3 ki n 1 1 n i n 1 n 3 1 n 2 since 1 i n 2 ki n 1 n 1 n 2 and i n 2 ki n 1 n 21 n 0 condition of b we have i n 2 ki n 1 n 1 1 i n 2 2 ki n 1 n 0 since 1 n m for some m 0 we have n 3 ki n 1 1 n i n 1 n 3 1 hence by considering n 3 1 n 1 n 3 n 3 lk n 1 n 1 k n 1 kk n 1 n 1 n 3 we have n 3 li n 1 n 1 i n 1 ki n 1 n 1 n 3 n 3 li n 1 n 1 i n 1 ki n 1 n 1 n 3 0 and n 3 li n 1 n 1 i n 1 ki n 1 n 1 n 3 1 we have reduced type ii to type i 10 elliptical degeneracy type iii we show this type of degeneracy is classical by reducing to type i for large n since 1 ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n ki n 1 n i n li n 1 n type iii implies type i in this can trivially reduce to type i 44 now we have completed the proof for types i ii iii iv next we will link them together and consider the general case without any restrictions on 1 n 11 non collapsing fixed points subspaces the main result in this section is the following when we have a sequence of n of schottky groups which is k 1 classical and z n for some 0 such thatd n 0 then n will contain a subsequence which will be classical schottky groups for large enough n given a set of generators 1 k we define nielsen maps fi l m for integers 1 i k and natural number l m as fi l m j k l i j m i first we show that given n sequence of k 1 classical schottky groups with dn 0 we can always choose generators so that the k 1 classical generators are of standard form which means that centers of isometric circles are bounded between 1 and 1 n for n sufficiently large lemma 11 1 let n be a sequence of rank k schottky group which is k 1 classical and d n 0 then we can find a subsequence of generating set sn of n up to mobius conjugation such that 2 n k n sn is a sequence of k 1 classical generators and sn is of standard form proof since n is k 1 classical and d n 0 it follows from prop 6 4 we have a normal subsequence of generating sets we using same index for subsequence 1 n 2 n k n of n as before there exists integers l 1 j n m 1 j n such that we can put these sequence of generating sets in to standard form by f 1 l 1 j n m 1 j n applied to j n for 2 j k we can assume that the all centers of isometric circles of f 1 l 1 j n m 1 j n j n are strictly bounded away from 1 n 2 note that the new sequence will not necessarily be k 1 classical generators suppose this is the case since n is k 1 classical sequence there ex ists classical generating set for the k 1 generators not including 1 n in fact there exists fi li j n mi j n such that elements of this classical generators will be of the form fi li j n mi j n j n for i 6 1 and integers li j n mi j n depends on indices i j n note that if it s not of standard form then by repeat ing this process for a fixed n we have generating set with generators with trace the generators constructed will have leading term of the form 45 fi li j n mi j nf 1 l 1 j n m 1 j n where i 6 1 and some integers li j n mi j n in partic ular continue this process we have generators of arbitrarily small isometric circles and since we only terminate when we have elements of leading term of the form f 1 l 1 j n m 1 j nfi li j n mi j n becomes k 1 classical generators we have every f 1 l 1 j n mi j nfi l 1 j n mi j n is distinct for the repetition this implies all fixed points of these k 1 generators are arbitrarily close to centers of circles for sufficiently many repetitions fi li j n mi j n j n for i 2 are clas sical generators of rank k 1 schottky group with each generator s fixed points and isometric centers arbitrarily close since j n is also gener ators of which must also of fixed points and isometric centers arbitrarily close and fi li j n mi j n j n is classical we must have fixed points of j n contained within isometric circles of fi li j n mi j n j n since isomet ric circle centers of j n are bounded within 1 1 n 2 and strictly away from 1 n 2 we must have isometric centers of fi li j n mi j n j n also bounded ar bitrarily close to 1 and away from 1 n 2 for sufficiently many repetitions hence we can find a mobius map scaling such that fixes 0 and moves all isometric centers of fi li j n mi j n j n to be bounded within 1 1 n 2 therefore the repetition process must terminate with k 1 classical generators j n with centers bounded within 1 1 n 2 hence a generating set of k 1 classical and standard form given n sequence of k 1 classical schottky group with dn 0 lemma 11 1 provides generators of standard form with k 1 classical for large n however note that the circles of the k 1 generators may not be disjointed from circles of 1 n hence they don t necessarily constitute classical gener ating set for n this is due to the fact we have degenerate types i ii iii iv theorem 11 2 let jk be the rank k schottky space for each 0 there exists a 0 such that jk d is k 1 classical for some jk o proof we proof by contradiction it follows from argument before for i we only need to assume that 1 n c for some c 0 now it follows from lemma 11 1 we have sequence of generating sets sn of n such that it is k 1 classical and of standard form since j n 46 for 2 j k are classical generators and have centers bounded within 1 and 1 n 2 standard form the only issues that prevents 1 n k n been a classical generators are degeneracies described earlier hence we have reduced the general case to degenerate type i ii iii iv now it follows from that degenerate types are all in fact classical generators for d n sufficiently small i e large n which gives our result 12 collapsing fixed points types this section and following sections are devoted in proving theorem 12 1 the theorem 12 1 will enable us to remove the constraint on z n that was placed in the theorem 11 2 the idea of the proof is based on analysis of the behavior of the set of fixed points of generators this should be compared to the previous section where analysis of centers of isometric circles were used recall theorem 11 2 states that a given schottky group is classical schottky group if z 1 k and hausdorff dimension d is sufficiently small and is k 1 classical now in this section theorem 12 1 we will state and start it s proof that for a given schottky group which is k 1 classical of small hausdorff dimension d we have the following dichotomy z 1 n j n c for some c 0 is classical schottky group therefore combining with theorem 11 2 we have the proof that schottky groups of fixed rank k which is k 1 classical and with sufficiently small hausdorff dimension are classical schottky groups theorem 12 1 there exists c 0 such that let n be a sequence of rank k schottky groups that is k 1 classical with dn 0 then for sufficiently large n there exists a subsequence using same index n with generating set 1 n 2 n k n such that z 1 n k n c or 1 n 2 n k n is classical schottky groups for large n the idea of the proof of theorem 12 1 is to use theorem 11 2 and show by contradiction the proof involves analysis of collapsing of fixed points given 47 below as collapsing i and ii first we pick an sequence of generating sets s n of n which is k 1 classical from s n we will examine when s n dose not satisfies conditions of theorem 11 2 in each situation where n 6 jk we can always obtain new sequence of generating sets such that it will leads to contradictions the proof will occupy next two sections of collapsing fixed points i ii proof we prove by contradiction suppose there exists n a sequence of schottky groups which is k 1 classical such that for every generating set 1 n k n of n we have z 1 n k n 0 for each n by replacing 1 n k n with 1 n m 2 n 1 n 2 n mk n 1 n k n for sufficiently large mk n if necessary we can always assume that every n is generated by generators with tr 1 n tr k n and tr k n log 3 dn we use h 3 the upper space model conjugating with mobius transfor mations it is sufficient to assume 1 n with fixed points 0 and multiplier 1 n and i n i 2 also 1 n 2 i n 1 note that as before we denote by z i n l z i n u as the two fixed points of i n by z i n l z i n u whenever we have i n in matrix form then we always assume ai n di n otherwise just replace i n by 1 i n note that by lemma 11 1 we can assume s n satisfies is k 1 classical of standard form hence we will always take such s n to be the generators set we when z n 0 which we say collapsing fixed points this can be divided into possible collapsing types collapsing fixed points i z i n u z i n l 0 for some i 2 collapsing fixed points ii z i n l 0 for some i 2 after we analyzed both collapsing fixed points i ii we will then address the general situation we will address these collapsing fixed points in next two sections 13 collapsing fixed points i we show that in this collapsing situation we have further additional i 1 and i 2 such that 48 i 1 implies z n c and i 2 implies classical where collapsing fixed points i is dichotomized into i 1 lim infn 1 n 1 i 2 there some exists 1 so that 1 n let us first analyze subclass i 2 which is straightforward 13 1 i 2 since z i n l z i n u 1 and 1 n 1 we have 1 z i n l z i n u for large n hence by 1 n k n is k 1 classical of standard form we have it satisfies lemma 5 2 for large n 13 2 i 1 in this case we will need to perform transformations on i n i 2 based on the rate of 1 n degenerates into 1 i e 1 n collapsing into an elliptical element this is done by divid the rate of degeneracy of 1 n into smaller and smaller intervals and then transform the i n i 2 based on the divided exponents by take a subsequence if necessary we can just assume that 1 n strictly decreasing to 1 for large sufficiently enough n we can choose a sequence of positive integers mn which depends on index n so that 1 1 mn 1 1 n 1 1 mn set i n ai n ci n i n di n ci n and since tr i n and tr 2 i n 4 2 ci n z i n z i n 0 we have tr i n ci n then from lemma 4 4 and remark 4 6 it follows that z imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n i n 2 imni n imni n tr i n e i tr i n z imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n i n 4 imni n 2 imni n tr i n e 2 i tr i n 49 for sufficiently large n by lemma 4 4 and remark 4 6 and the condition that z i n l z i n u 0 we get both n n 1 we have z imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n 2 imn 1 n z imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n 4 imn 1 n 0 by the definition of mn we must have 2 imnn e 2 i 2 imnn e 4 i hence it follows that z imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n e 2 and also z imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n 1 from this it follows that there exists c 0 such that z 1 n imn 1 n i n 2 imn 1 n kmn 1 n k n 2 kmn 1 n c for sufficiently large n 14 collapsing fixed points ii we show in this collapsing situation we have ii 1 implies z n c and ii 2 implies classical for n where collapsing fixed points ii is further dichotomized into ii 1 lim infn 1 n for some 1 ii 2 lim infn 1 n we also assume that i n i n as before otherwise we just simply replace by it s inverse 14 1 ii 1 in this case we prove that there are integers li n with z 1 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n lk n 1 n k n c for some c 0 by taking a subsequence we can just assume we have 1 n for large enough n first we consider 2 n and then move to k n inductively as follows choose positive integers l 2 n to be the smallest such that e 2 2 n 2 l 2 n 1 n since 1 n we must have some 2 0 such that e 2 2 n 2 l 2 n 1 n 2 50 lemma 14 1 with above notations there exists 0 e 2 and n n such that e 2 z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 to show this lemma 14 1 in the following we can use remark 4 2 b of lemma 4 4 proof note that since z 2 n z 2 n 1 for some 0 and large n and also tr 2 n we have c 2 n by remark 4 2 b we have z 2 n u 2 n 0 hence for large n we have 2 2 n 1 let us show that z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 6 suppose this is not true denote by 2 n the center of the circle having z l 2 n 1 n 2 n and z l 2 n 1 n 2 n as pair of antipodal points on the boundary sphere by l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 1 for some 0 and large n and 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 and z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n we get 2 n 2 for some positive number 0 and 2 1 since 2 n 2 2 n 2 2 1 2 2 1 we can take 2 3 2 1 hence we have that dist l 1 n l l 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 for some 2 0 by remark 4 1 a we have tr l 2 n 1 n 2 n and l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n tr l 2 n 1 n 2 n c 2 n l 2 n 1 n we get tr l 2 n 1 n 2 n c 2 n l 2 n 1 n but this imples that z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n c for some c 0 hence a contradiction note that if z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 0 then z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n since 1 2 e 2 1 1 2 l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 2 for large n this implies that 1 2 e 2 1 2 z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 2 for large n now if c z z l 2 n 1 n 2 n c for some c c 0 then it follows from remark 4 1 a we get tr l 2 n 1 n 2 n and it imples that c 2 n l 2 n 1 n so by remark 4 2 b we get z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n which gives the lemma next we proceed down to generator i 1 n and do the same above proce dure as we have done for i n with i 2 more precisely we choose li 1 n to be the smallest integer such that e 2 i 1 z li n 1 n 2 n u i 1 n 2 li 1 n 1 n then 51 it follows from above proof we have e 2 i 1 z li n 1 n 2 n u z li 1 n 1 n i 1 n z li 1 n 1 n i 1 n i 1 i 2 now for these transformed generators we have the following two possibilities according to the collapsing or the non collapsing fixed points respectively as ii 1 a lim inf z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 0 ii 1 b lim infn z l 2 n 1 n 2 n z l 2 n 1 n 2 n 0 in the case ii 1 b we have z 1 n l 2 n 1 n 2 n lk n 1 n k n c for some c 0 and large n hence suppose we have ii 1 a passing to a subsequence if necessary we can assume that z li 1 n 1 n i 1 n z li 1 n 1 n i 1 n 0 if 1 n 1 then choose positive integers mi n m i n as defined in collaps ing fixed points i 1 such that e 2 i z lk n 1 n k n u i n 2 li n 2 mi n 1 n emi n emi n 2 i n 2 li n 2 mi n 1 n em i n and also i n z li n mi n 1 n i n z li n mi n 1 n i n i n for some 0 i n i n mi n m i n by remark 4 1 a tr li n mi n 1 n i 1 n hence by remark 4 2 b we have z li n mi n 1 n i n z li n mi n 1 n i n li n mi n 1 n i n li n mi n 1 n i n this implies that e 2 i z lk n 1 n k n u z li n mi n 1 n i n emi n and emi n 2 z li n mi n 1 n i n em i n hence there exists c 0 such that z 1 n li n mi n 1 n i n lk n 1 n k n c for large n if 1 n c 0 then we do the same as above and treat it as special case by chose appropriate m i n then 1 z li n m i n 1 n i n z li n m i n 1 n i n 2 for some 0 1 2 and it follows from remark 4 1 a and remark 4 2 b we have that z 1 n li n m i n 1 n i n lk n 1 n k n c for large n 52 14 2 ii 2 take a subsequence of 1 n if necessary we can assume that 1 n is strictly increasing to let li n 0 be a sequence of integers such that i n 2 li n 1 n 1 if lim sup i n 2 li n 1 n 1 and lim sup i n 2 li n 1 n i n 6 0 then we have a subsequence such that lim inf j z 1 nj li nj 2 i 1 nj i nj 2 i 1 nj lk nj 2 k 1 nj k nj 2 k 1 nj 0 suppose lim sup i n 2 li n 1 n 1 then denote by 1 nj lk nj 1 nj k nj the subsequence of 1 n lk n 1 n k n with limj i nj 2 li nj 1 nj 1 if lim sup tr l 1 nji nj i nj then by passing to a subsequence if nec essary for large j li nj 1 nj i nj will have disjointed isometric circles since tr i nj z i nj l 0 so z i nj z i nj c for c 0 we have ci nj by remark 4 2 b limj min i nj z i nj i nj z i nj 0 since li nj 1 nj i nj 1 and tr l 1 nj 1 nj i nj we have li nj 1 nj i nj li nj 1 nj 1 nj tr li nj 1 nj 1 nj li nj 1 nj ci nj 0 and li nj 1 nj ci nj also z li nj 1 nj i nj z li nj 1 nj i nj tr 2 li nj 1 nj i nj 4 2 li nj 1 nj ci nj 0 hence it follows from remark 4 2 b there exists a 0 such that for large j we have 1 z li nj 1 nj i nj l z li nj 1 nj i nj u and since 1 nj we can choose mobius transformations i such that sj j 1 nj li nj 1 nj i nj li nj 1 nj i nj 1 j satisfies lemma 5 2 and since it is k 1 classical of standard form we have sj generates classical schottky groups for large j 53 let us arrange i n i 2 such that tr i 1 n tr i n if we have that lim sup tr lk nj 1 nj k nj then set j be mobius transformations so that j lk nj 1 nj k nj 1 j have fixed points 0 and fixed points z j 1 nj 1 j be z lk nj k nj then it follows that z j i nj 1 j l 1 hence we can reduced this case to collapsing fixed points i which has already been considered if lim sup i n 2 li n 1 n 1 then we have ii 2 a lim inf i n 2 li n 2 1 n 1 ii 2 b lim inf i n 2 li n 2 1 n 1 14 2 1 ii 2 a we arrange so that 1 nj lk nj 1 nj k nj be a subsequence of such that limj k nj 2 lk nj 2 1 nj 1 if supj tr lk nj 1 1 nj k nj then we conjugate 1 nj lk nj 1 nj k nj to k j j 1 nj 1 j and 1 j j lk nj 1 1 nj 1 nj 1 j with 1 i have fixed points 0 and k j have z lk nj 1 1 nj k nj since supj 1 j it follows that if z i j l 1 then 1 j k j falls under collapsing fixed points i and if z i l 0 then 1 j k j falls under collapsing fixed points ii 1 otherwise there exists 0 such that z i j l 1 hence as in collapsing fixed points i we can choose integers ni n such that z 1 j ni j 1 j i j ni n 1 j nk j 1 j k j nk n 1 j c for some c 0 now if we assume that supj tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj then for large j since the radius of isometric circles are r li nj 1 1 nj i nj z li nj 1 1 nj i nj u z li nj 1 i nj i nj l tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj and the distance between the centers is li nj 1 1 nj 1 nj li nj 1 1 nj i nj tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj ci nj li nj 1 1 nj 54 and by z li nj 1 1 nj i nj u z li nj 1 1 nj i nj l tr 2 li nj 1 1 nj i nj 4 2 ci nj li nj 1 1 nj we have lim j li nj 1 1 nj i nj li nj 1 1 nj i nj r li nj 1 1 nj i nj lim i 2 tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj 2 tr 2 li nj 1 1 nj i nj 4 tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj for some 0 hence li nj 1 1 nj i nj li nj 1 1 nj i nj 2 r li nj 1 1 nj i nj for large j from this it implies that li nj 1 1 nj i nj have disjointed isometric circles for large j by lemma 4 4 we have i nj 1 and since li nj 11 ni i nj i nj implies that li nj 1 1 nj i nj 1 note that if infj li nj 1 1 nj i nj 1 0 and li nj 1 1 nj i nj 1 then by tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj we have 1 z li nj 1 1 nj i nj l li nj 1 1 nj i nj z li nj 1 1 nj i nj u 0 and infj z li nj 1 1 nj i nj u z li nj 1 1 nj i nj l 0 hence for large j there exits 0 such that 1 z li nj 1 1 nj i nj l z li nj 1 1 nj i nj u 1 hence we can choose integers ni n such that inf j z 1 nj li ni ni nj 1 1 nj i nj ni nj 1 nj lk ni nk nj 1 1 nj k nj nk nj 1 nj 0 now suppose that li nj 1 1 nj i nj 1 then we have li nj 1 1 nj i nj li nj 1 1 nj i nj 0 hence tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj ci nj li nj 1 1 nj 0 since tr li nj 1 1 nj i nj which gives z kni 1 ni ni u z kni 1 ni ni l tr 2 lni 1 ni ni 4 2 cni lni 1 ni 0 55 therefore the distance between the centers of these isometric circles decreases to 0 and radius r li nj 1 1 nj i nj 0 since infj 1 nj 2 c 1 we have for large j that the isometric circles of li nj 1 1 nj i nj disjointed and lies between c 1 and c in particular c 1 z li nj 1 1 nj i nj l z li nj 1 1 nj i nj u c set sj 1 nj li nj 1 1 nj i nj lk nj 1 1 nj k nj sj satisfies lemma 5 2 hence classical 14 2 2 ii 2 b first we define a new sequence of 1 n k n as follows consider s n 1 n li n 1 n i n lk n 1 n k n we arrange l 2 n 1 n 2 n lk n 1 n k n so that tr li 1 n 1 n i 1 n tr li n 1 n i n if tr lk n 1 n k n tr 1 n then set i n i n i 1 otherwise let n be the mobius map so that n lk n 1 n k n 1 n have fixed points 0 and n 1 n 1 n have z n 1 n 1 n z k n set 1 n 1 n lk n 1 n k n 1 n i n 1 n i n 1 n i 6 k we define integer li n 1 with respect to 1 n 1 k n 1 the same way as we defined li n before suppose that tr lk n 11 n 1 k n 1 tr 1 n 1 then we set i n i n 1 i 2 and 1 n 1 n 1 otherwise we repeat this construction to get a sequence 1 n m k n m by construction for a each n either there exists a m such that tr lk n m 1 n m k n m tr 1 n m or we have tr lk n m 1 n m k n m tr 1 n m for allm assume the latter since 1 n m 1 n m lk n m 1 n m k n m 1 n m we have tr 1 n m 1 tr 1 n m for all m if limm tr 1 n m 0 then takemn to be the first integerm with with tr 1 n m 1 n if limm tr 1 n m 0 then take mn to be the first integer m with tr 1 n m 1 tr 1 n m 1 n if the former holds we setmn to be the first integerm with tr lk n m 1 n m k n m tr 1 n m hence there exists a mn such that either tr lk n mn 1 n mn k n mn tr 1 n mn 1 n or tr 1 n mn 1 n note that by construction arrange ment we have tr li n m 1 n m i n m tr li 1 n m 1 n m i 1 n m i 2 this also implies that tr li n mn 1 n mn i n mn tr 1 n mn 1 n i 2 whenever we have tr lk n mn 1 n mn k n mn tr 1 n mn 1 n we define 1 n 1 n mn i n i n mn i 2 for s n 1 n m lk n m 1 n m k n m note that s n is also of k 1 standard form 56 first let us consider 1 n k n if lim infn tr 1 n we choose a subsequence with tr 1 ni c for all large i and some c 0 let pi j 2 i k be a sequence of least positive integers such that tr pi j 1 nj i nj 1 dnj we conjugate pi j 1 nj i nj by j that fixes 0 and max 2 i k z j pi j 1 nj i nj 1 j u 1 set 1 j j 1 nj 1 j i j j pi j 1 nj i nj 1 j by construction if z i j l 0 then 1 j k j satisfies collapsing fixed points ii 1 and if z i j l 1 then 1 j k j satisfies collapsing fixed points ii otherwise there exists 0 such that z i j l 1 then we can chose ni 0 integers such that z 1 j ni 1 j i j ni 1 j nk 1 j k j nk 1 j c for some c 0 hence in either case we are done now suppose that lim infn tr 1 n since tr i n tr 1 n i 2 it is sufficient to assume that 1 n k n satisfies case ii 2 b otherwise we are done we define l i n li n mn i 2 set 1 n 1 n i n l i n 1 n i n since tr i n tr 1 n and z i n z i n 1 n with n 0 this follows from that 1 n 2 z i n u 1 z 1 n l 0 it follows from lemma 4 4 with remark 4 6 and the inequality tr li n mn 1 n mn i n mn tr 1 n mn 1 n which implies limn tr i n 1 n for 0 where 1 n is the multiplier of 1 n and i n i n 1 n 2 for some 0 since i n 1 n i n 2 1 n and 1 n i n i n we have i n 1 n 21 n i n 21 n 21 n 1 n 4 and 1 n i n i n i n i n 1 n 2 for large n now we have reduced ii 2 b to the collapsing behaviors of i n i n there are four cases that needs to be considered as follows i lim j i nj 2 1 nj 1 nj 2 i nj 2 l i nj 1 nj 21 nj 1 nj 2 c 1 ii lim j i nj 2 1 nj 1 nj 2 c 2 lim j i nj 2 l i nj 1 nj 21 nj 1 nj 2 iii lim j i nj 2 1 nj 1 nj 2 lim j i nj 2 l i nj 1 nj 21 nj 1 nj 2 c 3 57 iv lim n i n 21 n 1 n 2 i n 2 l i n 1 n 21 n 1 n 2 consider i in this case we will produce a set of classical generators for sufficiently large nj by using condition i which is the transformed set of generators from the original set of generators since i nj 2 l i nj 1 nj 1 nj 2 and our assumption and 1 nj i nj 2 1 nj i nj we have for large j 1 1 nj i nj c 1 1 2 i k since i nj l i nj 1 nj i nj i nj and 1 nj 2 i nj 1 implies that 1 i nj 2 1 nj by our assumption we have similarly 1 i nj 11 nj c 1 1 since 1 nj it follows that there exists 1 such that 1 1 1 nj i nj 11 nj 1 nj i nj 11 nj 1 for large i by lemma 4 4 with remark 4 6 and tr i nj 1 nj for large j we have for some 1 2 0 that 1 1 1 1 nj 1 z 1 nj i nj 11 nj l z 1 nj i nj 11 nj u 1 2 1 nj 1 hence there exists 1 such that 1 z 1 nj i nj 11 nj l z 1 nj i nj 11 nj u consider sj 1 nj 1 nj i nj 1 1 nj 1 nj k nj 1 1 nj since tr 1 nj i nj 11 nj and by k 1 classical we have sj satisfies the second set of conditions of lemma 5 2 hence classical consider iv in this case we will produce a set of classical generators for sufficiently large n by using condition iv the generators are conjugate to the original set of generators 58 there exists 0 n with n 1 n such that i n 2 l i n 1 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 let i n be mobius transformations defined by 2 n x 1 n n x we will show that n 1 n i n k n 1 n satisfies remark 5 3 of lemma 5 2 if we have that 1 i n 1 for some 1 0 then 1 n n 1 n i n 1 n 1 n n otherwise we have n 1 n 1 1 n n n i n 1 n 1 n n similarly by condition of collapsing fixed points ii 2 we have i n 2 l i n 1 n 1 this gives n 1 n 1 1 n n n i n 1 n 1 n n by lemma 4 4 with remark 4 6 z i n i n c tr i n 2 and z i n i n c tr i n 2 for some c 0 since tr i n 1 n for large n we have z n i n 1 n n i n 1 n c 1 n n z n i n 1 n n i n 1 n c 1 n n hence z n i n 1 n u 1 n n 1 1 n n c 1 n n and z n i n 1 n l n 1 n 1 1 n n c 1 n n we have 1 n 1 z n i n 1 n l z n i n 1 n u 1 n for large n by above estimates for fixed points of n i n 1 n and tr i n 1 n 59 we have z n i n 1 n u 1 1 n 1 tr i n 1 n z n i n 1 n u 1 n 2 n 1 n n 1 n 1 n 2 1 1 n 1 1 n 2 n c 1 n 2 n 1 1 1 n n 1 n n 1 n 2 n 1 1 n 1 1 n 2 n c 1 n 2 n by n 1 n we have some 1 such that n 1 1 n 1 1 n 2 n c 1 n 2 n 0 for the other part of the conditions of remark 5 3 we have if z n i n 1 n l m then z n i n 1 n l 1 1 n 1 1 tr i n z n i n 1 n l 1 n 1 m 1 1 n 1 1 1 n n 1 n 1 1 n n c 1 n n 1 1 n m n 1 n c n 1 m n 0 otherwise we have z n i n 1 n l and z n i n 1 n l 1 1 n 1 1 tr i n z n i n 1 n l 1 n 1 1 n 0 for some 0 set sn n 1 n i n k n 1 n s n 1 n i n k n since s n is k 1 classical of standard form and i n l i n 1 n i n we have sn satisfies 1 n 1 z n i n 1 n l z n i n 1 n u 1 n lim n z n i n 1 n u 1 1 n 1 tr i n 1 n z n i n 1 n u z n i n 1 n l 1 1 n 1 1 tr i n z n i n 1 n l 1 n 1 0 60 conditions of remark 5 3 consider ii in this case we will produce a set of classical generators for sufficiently large n using condition ii the set of generators are conjugate to the transformed from the original set generators since 1 nj 2 i nj 1 and by our condition we have 1 i nj 2 1 nj 1 c 2 as in iv and using same notations similarly we have 1 n n n i nj 11 nj 1 n 1 n n 1 c 2 n 1 n 1 1 n n n i n 1 n 1 n n now by same argument as in iv we have n 1 nj i n 1 1 nj k nj 1 1 nj 1 n are classical schottky groups for large j consider iii finally in this case we will produce a set of classical generators which are conjugate to the transformed set of generators from the original set as in i we have 1 1 nj i nj 1 c 3 and also as in iv and ii we also have 1 n n n 1 nj i nj 11 nj 1 n 1 n n 1 c 3 n 1 n 1 1 n n n 1 nj i n 11 nj 1 n 1 n n then by same arguments as in iv we have n 1 nj 1 nj i n 1 1 nj 1 nj k nj 1 1 nj 1 n are classical schottky groups for large j hence we have completed the proof for all cases i ii iii iv now from above proofs of i iv suppose we have some generators that satisfies some of i iv then there exists a 2 n ak n b 2 n bk n 1 1 0 such that n 1 nj ai nj 1 nj i n bi nj 1 nj ak nj 1 nj k nj bk nj 1 nj 1 n is classical schottky group 61 14 3 proof of theorem 12 1 and rank k completing proof of theorem 12 1 for general case we combine results of collapsing fixed points i ii to complete the proof as follows given a sequence n which is k 1 classical with dn 0 it follows that if z n is not bounded below by some constant c 0 then we have some elements of all generating sets of the sequence having collapsing fixed points i or ii or both as defined earlier in both collapsings fixed points situations we showed that either the generating set gives classical generators or it leads to bounded z n below in particular suppose both collapsing i and ii exists for all sequence sn of generating set of n if n is sequence of non classical schottky groups withdn 0 then it follows from results for collapsing i and ii we must have a uniform lower bound on z n hence we have completed proof theorem 12 1 theorem 14 2 rank k classical schottky there exists k 0 such that any rank k non classical schottky group must have d k proof we proof by induction by main theorem of 16 there exists 2 0 such that all rank 2 is classical when hausdorff dimension 2 let k 3 hence by induction and theorem 11 2 and thereom 12 1 there exists k 0 such that any d k is classical schottky group 15 extension from fixed rank k to all ranks this is section we will prove that our result on fixed rank k can be extended to all finitely generated define dk as dk sup d k any rank k nonclassical schpottky group must have d d k lemma 15 1 there exists a positive number 0 and k a positive integer such that given any k 1 rank k 1 schottky group with the property that all rank n k 1 subgroups of k 1 are classical schottky groups then k 1 is classical schottky group provided that d k 1 and k k the idea of the proof is induction on rank to do so we use proposition 4 2 which say that with respect to 1 n there must exists some generator such that the norms of its trace growth exponentially with respect to the 62 rank k so assuming that we have all rank k of small hausdorff dimensions are classical schottky groups then we will show that the additional generator of the k 1 element will have disjointed schottky circles from rest of the k elements when the rank is sufficiently large proof let k 1 be a sequence of schottky groups each k 1 is of rank k 1 such that any rank n that is k 1 is classical we will show that for sufficently large k k 1 is classical for small dk 1 in order to prove k 1 is eventually classical we will need to use the estimates given by proposition 4 2 we denote generators set of k 1 as s k 1 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 we can assume that d k 1 0 otherwise we are done with the lemma if necessary for i 2 replace i k 1 by li k 1 1 k 1 i k 1 mi k 1 1 k 1 such that 1 k 1 2 li k 1 1 k 1 i k 1 mi k 1 1 k 1 li k 1 1 k 1 i k 1 mi k 1 1 k 1 1 we can assume that all 1 k 1 2 i k 1 i k 1 1 i 2 for each n k 1 we choose and arrange the geneartors as follows fol lows from corollary 4 3 there exists a generators that satisfies the estimates stated in corollary 4 3 with respect to 1 k 1 set k 1 k 1 that satisfies the estimates provided by corollary 4 3 we arrange k k 1 simiarly by using corollary 4 3 on 1 k 1 k k 1 and we arrange generators this way for all generators down to n 1 k 1 and in particular we have tr n 1 k 1 c 2 n 1 1 k 1 2 d k 1 2 n 1 1 k 1 2 d k 1 1 1 2 d k 1 e dist l 1 k 1 l n 1 k 1 let n k 1 k 1 be generated by s n k 1 1 k 1 n k 1 since d n k 1 0 for k and by assumption that it is k 1 classical it follows from lemma 11 1 we can choose the generators set s n k 1 such that it is k 1 classical of standard form now we will show that the circles of n 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 are disjoint from circles c 1 k 1 1 c 1 k 1 suppose that z m k 1 z m k 1 1 k 1 2 1 2 c 63 for some c 0 m n by lemma 8 6 and above inequality and assume that d k 1 1 6 then 1 tr m k 1 1 k 1 2 1 1 k 1 2 d k 1 1 2 m 1 1 k

3 0 for m for small d k 1 and large m if z m k 1 z m k 1 1 k 1 2 1 2 0 then first let us assume that 1 k 1 c for some c 0 in this case we have the same result as to proposition 8 7 that r m k 1 r m k 1 0 to see this we can simply reproduce the same proof as given before more precisely we can assume that tr m k 1 c for some c 0 othewise it is trivial then we have as in last inequality of proof of proposition 8 7 r m k 1 r m k 1 m z m k 1 2 m 1 m k 1 2 d k 1 2 m 1 1 2 d k 1 m 2 m 1 0 for d k 1 1 for 1 k 1 1 then we can follow the same procedure as in the proof of lemma 8 3 and proposition 8 5 more precisely we break down to two cases based on bounds of f m k 1 1 k 1 0 or f m k 1 1 k 1 m for some m 0 for f m k 1 1 k 1 0 by repeating the same technique we can show that s k 1 with 1 k 1 replaced by 1 1 k 1 m k 1 in s k 1 generates a classical 64 schottk group for largem similarly for f m k 1 1 k 1 m we have s k 1 with m k 1 replaces by 1 1 k 1 m k 1 generates a classical schottky group for large m corollary 15 2 infkdk 0 proof let 0 k be given by lemma 15 1 then let d min dk then any nonclassical schottky group must have d d 16 proof of main theorem theorem 16 1 there exists 0 such that all finitely generated schottky group with d is a classical schottky group proof this follows from theorem 11 2 and theorem 12 1 proof of theorem 1 1 the final argument that we need to show is that kleinian groups with limit set of small enough hausdorff dimension are schot tky groups this is a well established fact and detailed arguments can be found in 16 for completeness we give a quick review here let be a non elementary finitely generated kleinian group by selberg lemma we can assume is a torsion free non elementary finited generated kleinian group d 1 2 implies is geoemtrically finite convex cocompact of second kind since consists of finitely many compact compressible riemann surfaces we can decomposes along compression disks and after finitely many steps we
