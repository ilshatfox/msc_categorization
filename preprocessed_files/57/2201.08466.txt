obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids angela wu abstract we show that any knot which is smoothly the closure of a 3 braid cannot be lagrangian concordant to and from the maximum thurston bennequin legendrian unknot except the unknot itself our obstruction comes from drawing the weinstein handlebody diagrams of particular symplec tic fillings of cyclic branched double covers of knots in s 3 we use the legendrian contact homology differential graded algebra of the links in these diagrams to compute the symplectic homology of these fillings to derive a contradiction as a corollary we find an infinite family of contact manifolds which are rational homology spheres but do not embed in r 4 as contact type hypersurfaces 1 introduction knot concordance was first defined by fox and milnor in fm 66 as a way to endow topological knots with a group structure two knots are said to be smoothly concordant if they jointly form the boundary of a smooth cylinder in four dimensional euclidean space we study a variant of the problem of concordance defined in the symplectic setting by chantraine cha 10 called lagrangian concordance we consider legendrian knots in r 3 with the standard contact structure ker dz ydx let r 4 be the symplectization of r 3 rt r 3 with the symplectic form d et definition 1 1 let r 3 be legendrian knots where r 3 is equipped with the standard contact structure ker a lagrangian cobordism from to is a lagrangian l embedded in r 4 such that t r 3 l t and t r 3 l t for some t 0 definition 1 2 if a lagrangian cobordism has zero genus then we call it a lagrangian concordance if there is a lagrangian concordance from to we write and say that is lagrangian concordant to lagrangian cobordisms between legendrian submanifolds have been studied in symplectic and con tact topology due to their key role in symplectic field theory egh 00 indeed lagrangian cobordisms were first defined to construct a category whose objects are legendrian submanifolds and whose mor phisms are given by the exact lagrangian cobordisms this led to the development of a new invariant by chekanov and eliashberg che 02 eli 98 a differential graded algebra whose homology called leg endrian contact homology gives a functor from the category of legendrians to the category of these differential graded algebras the study of lagrangian cobordisms has also led to the development of the wrapped fukaya category fss 08 with this motivation a lot of recent work aims to understand the structure and behaviour of the lagrangian cobordism relation for instance bll 20 cha 10 cha 15 cns 16 ehk 16 st 13 svvw 21 in cha 10 chantraine showed that legendrian isotopic legendrian knots are lagrangian concor dant and that lagrangian concordance can be obstructed by classical legendrian knot invariants the rotation number and the thurston bennequin number lagrangian concordance is both reflexive and transitive suggesting that as a relation it is potentially a partial order on legendrian knots in cha 15 chantraine proved that lagrangian concordance is not symmetric it is not known if la grangian concordance is antisymmetric ie if 1 2 1 then 1 is legendrian isotopic to 2 let u denote the tb 1 legendrian unknot as a first step to understanding the potential antisymmetry of this relation we may pose the following question about the simplest case 1 ar x iv

legendrian knots satisfy u u as in figure 1 the answer to this question is not known in fact it is not known whether any knot is lagrangian concordant to u other than u itself if a legendrian knot satisfies u then u can be filled at the negative end by a lagrangian disk the result is a lagrangian filling of with genus zero boileau and orevkov showed that any such must be quasipositive bo 01 furthermore must be smoothly slice meaning it bounds a smooth disk in b 4 cornwell ng and sivek cns 16 show that no nontrivial can have a decomposable lagrangian concordance to u they also provide many obstructions to and examples of lagrangian concordance for example if has at least two normal rulings then u in this paper we develop new obstructions to the double lagrangian concordance u u which do not depend on the legendrian contact homology of itself the main result is that we are able to obstruct the topological knot type of theorem 1 1 let u be the standard tb 1 unknot let be a legendrian knot satisfying u u and 6 u then cannot be smoothly the closure of a 3 braid the 3 braids are a relatively small class of braids murasugi classified representatives for all conju gacy classes of 3 braids mur 74 the proof of theorem 1 1 involves obstructing the closures of these braids we prove some obstructions by reframing the problem of lagrangian concordance as one of fillings of p the p fold cyclic cover of s 3 branched over a transverse push off of theorem 1 2 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u then any p fold cyclic branched cover p of s 3 branched over the transverse push off of embeds as a contact type hypersurface in b 4 std moreover p is stein fillable and has a stein filling which embeds in b 4 std theorem 1 3 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u then any filling of the p fold cyclic branched cover p of s 3 branched over the transverse push off must embed in a blow up of b 4 and must have negative definite intersection form we consider specifically the branched double cover to obtain a further obstructions using d 3 gompf s 3 dimensional invariant on 2 plane fields gom 98 theorem 1 4 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u then the contact 2 fold cyclic branched cover 2 of s 3 branched over the positive transverse push off of has d 3 1 2 these obstructions eliminate all 3 braids except those which are quasipositive and of algebraic length 2 to obstruct the remaining 3 braids we study particular fillings of their branched double obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 3 figure 2 a weinstein filling of 2 the shaded blue and shaded green represent parallel strands of a single legendrian link in s 1 s 2 covers by drawing the weinstein handlebody diagrams wei 91 of these fillings weinstein handlebody diagrams are the symplectic analogue to kirby diagrams and illustrate a symplectic version of handle decomposition we obtain these diagrams by adapting the recipe laid out by casals and murphy in cm 19 and prove the following theorem theorem 1 5 let 6 u be a legendrian knot which is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 let be a positive transverse push off of if lemma 3 6 gives with slope p q 0 p q then there is a filling of 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over given by the handle decomposition consisting of a single 1 handle and a single 2 handle pictured in figure 2 we then compute the legendrian contact homology differential graded algebra of the legendrian attaching sphere depicted in the general diagram the homology of this differential graded algebra called the legendrian contact homology was introduced by chekanov and eliashberg che 02 eli 98 and was the first non classical legendrian link invariant the differential graded algebra is generated by reeb chords in a legendrian link in r 3 and the differential counts holomorphic disks in r r 3 a z graded version of the legendrian contact homology differential graded algebra was defined by etnyre ng and sabloff ens 02 and a version of this differential graded algebra was defined for links in m s 1 s 2 by ekholm and ng en 15 and simplified by etgu and lekili el 19 the legendrian contact homology dga can be used to compute invariants of the weinstein manifolds including the symplectic homology of the filling of 2 following work of bee 12 we prove theorem 1 6 let 6 u be a legendrian knot which is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 let be a positive transverse push off of then there is a filling of 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over which has nonvanishing symplectic homology the main result theorem 1 1 then follows from an argument showing that this filling of 2 cannot embed in b 4 the strategy used in this paper can also be extended to n stranded braids on a case by case basis in example 4 4 we consider the m 10140 knot which is the closure of a 4 stranded braid it was previously not known whether or not this knot can be lagrangian concordant to the unknot since its legendrian contact homology dga is stable tame isomorphic to the dga of the unknot cns 16 and thus indistiguishable via contact homology techniques we show that in fact that m 10140 u a corollary of theorem 1 1 may be of separate interest in mt 21 mark and tosun pose the following question which smooth oriented manifolds can be realized up to diffeomorphism as contact type hypersurfaces in r 2 n with the standard symplectic structure they rule out the brieskorn spheres we find another infinite family of contact manifolds which are rational homology spheres but do not embed as contact type hypersurfaces in r 4 corollary 1 7 let 2 be the double cover of s 3 branched over a quasipositive transverse knot which is the closure of a 3 braid of algebraic length 2 suppose is not the unknot then 2 does not embed as a contact type hypersurface in r 4 structure of the paper in section 2 we build some obstructions from fillings of double covers and apply them to 3 braids in section 3 we produce particular open book decompositions of the branched double covers of the knots in a remaining family of 3 braids we find corresponding weinstein lefschetz fibrations of fillings of these covers in section 4 we draw the weinstein handlebody diagrams for these fillings in chapter 5 we compute the legendrian contact homology differential graded algebra of the 4 wu figure 3 going from left to right a positive markov move or stabilization and from right to left its inverse or de stabilization legendrian attaching spheres of these weinstein handlebody diagrams and prove that these fillings have non zero symplectic homology in section 6 we prove theorem 1 1 acknowledgements the author thanks roger casals orsola

london and by louisiana state university 2 initial obstructions from fillings in this section we prove some new obstructions to lagrangian concordance to and from the tb 1 unknot which come from restrictions on the fillings of cyclic branched covers of transverse knots we apply these to obstruct all but a particular family of closures of 3 braids from lagrangian double concordance in ben 83 bennequin showed that any conjugacy class of braids can be closed in a natural way to produce a transverse knot in s 3 std and that every transverse knot is transversely isotopic to a closed braid orevkov shevchishin and wrinkle os 03 wri 02 show that two transverse closed braids that are isotopic as transverse knots are also isotopic as transverse braids more precisely theorem 2 1 os 03 wri 02 two braids represent transversally isotopic links if and only if one can pass from one braid to another by conjugations in braid groups positive markov moves and their inverses markov moves also called positive or negative stabilizations are an operation on braids that in creases the number of strands but preserves the topological knot type of the braids see figure 3 recall that a braid is quasipositive if it is the product of conjugates of positive generators of the braid group a knot is called quasipositive if it is the closure of a quasipositive braid it follows from bo 01 that lagrangian fillable legendrian knots are quasipositive using conjugations and positive markov moves and their inverses hayden proves the following theorem 2 2 hay 18 every quasipositive link has a quasipositive representative of minimal braid index remark 2 3 thus every transverse representative of a quasipositive link is transversely isotopic to a transverse quasipositive braid of minimal braid index if a quasipositive knot has braid index 3 then any quasipositive transverse representative of that smooth knot type is transversely isotopic to a transverse 3 braid for a candidate satisfying u u we obtain a transverse knot which is a positive push off of if is smoothly the closure of a 3 braid then so is obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 5 b 4 p u p p u figure 4 p c b 4 a filling of p u p c is represented by the green area 2 1 embeddings of branched covers to begin we cite lemma 4 1 of cghs 14 which gives a way of approximating a lagrangian filling with a symplectic one lemma 2 4 cghs 14 let x be a strong filling of y with an oriented lagrangian l x whose boundary is a legendrian y then the lagrangian surface l may be c approximated by a symplectic surface l that satisfies 1 l 0 and 2 l is a positive transverse link smoothly isotopic to this result follows from lemma 2 3 a proved by eliashberg eli 95 lemma 2 5 eli 95 let f be a connected surface with boundary in a 4 dimensional symplectic man ifold x suppose that f is positive near f and non negative elsewhere then f can be c approximated by a surface f which coincides with f near f f and such that f 0 additionally we use theorem 1 2 of cha 10 theorem 2 6 cha 10 consider the standard contact s 3 and let u be the standard legendrian unknot with tb u 1 let c be an oriented lagrangian cobordism from u to itself then there is a compactly supported symplectomorphism of r s 3 such that c r u this theorem follows from a result of eliashberg and polterovich theorem 1 1 a of ep 96 theorem 2 7 ep 96 any flat at infinity lagrangian embedding of r 2 into the standard symplectic r 4 is isotopic to the flat embedding via an ambient compactly supported hamiltonian isotopy of r 4 with these we can prove the following two obstructions theorem 1 2 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u then any p fold cyclic branched cover p of s 3 branched over the transverse push off of embeds as a contact type hypersurface in b 4 std moreover p is stein fillable and has a stein filling which embeds in b 4 std note that since must be quasipositive fillability of p also follows from a result of pla 06 proof of theorem 1 2 suppose we have some legendrian knot in s 3 such that u u in rt s 3 which is symplectomorphic to r 4 b 4 suppose 0 s 3 let c 1 be the lagrangian cylinder from u to and c 2 be the lagrangian cylinder from to u see figure 1 by theorem 2 6 c 1 c 2 is hamiltonian isotopic to the product cylinder r u fill in c 1 at the negative end by a lagrangian disk in b 4 then c d 2 c 1 c 2 is a lagrangian filling of the unknot u by a standardly embedded disk by lemma 2 4 there is a symplectic approxi mation of c call it c c with transverse boundary c u where u is the transverse unknot with self linking number 1 the p fold cyclic branched cover of s 3 branched over u is the standard s 3 see lemma 2 4 of ce 19 6 wu x v p p u figure 5 v x a filling of p u where x is a filling of p the p fold cyclic branched cover of rt s 3 branched over c which we will call p c is the standard four ball b 4 std for a small enough perturbation there is some t in a neighbourhood of 0 such that c is transverse to t s 3 and c t s 3 is a transverse push off of in t s 3 then p the p fold cyclic branched cover of s 3 branched over is a contact type hypersurface in b 4 std we illustrate this in figure 4 taking the negative end of p c bounded by p gives a stein filling x of p which embeds in b 4 std theorem 1 3 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u then any filling of the p fold cyclic branched cover p of s 3 branched over the transverse push off must embed in a blow up of b 4 and must have negative definite intersection form proof suppose we have a legendrian knot in s 3 such that u in rt s 3 recall the construction from theorem 1 2 of the branched cover p c recall also the 4 manifold x which is a filling of the 3 manifold p and which embeds in p c let v p c x let x 0 be any filling of p and let w x 0 v be obtained by gluing x 0 to v along p the boundary w p u s 3 by a theorem of mcduff theorem 1 7 of mcd 90 or of gromov p 311 of gro 85 w is necessarily a blowup of b 4 with the standard symplectic structure as s 3 has a unique minimal filling b 4 finally since any surface embedded in x is embedded in b 4 ncp 2 for some n 0 x must be negative definite 2 2 using gompf s 3 dimensional 2 plane field invariant next we prove an obstruction to the concordance u u coming from the d 3 invariant of 2 proved in theorem 4 16 of gom 98 and apply it to the case where is a transverse knot which is the closure of a 3 braid for a given contact 3 manifold m we define the d 3 invariant on the homotopy type of the 2 plane field theorem 2 8 gom 98 suppose we have a contact 3 manifold m and suppose we have an almost complex 4 manifold x j such that x m with induced by the complex tangencies tm j tm let x denote the signature of x and let x denote the euler characteristic of x for c 1 a torsion class the rational number d 3 c 21 x j 3 x 2 x 4 is an invariant of the homotopy type of the 2 plane field obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 7 using theorem 1 2 we prove a restriction on d 3 for the branched double cover 2 theorem 1 4 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u then the contact cyclic branched double cover 2 of s 3 branched over the transverse push off of has d 3 1 2 proof suppose we have a legendrian knot satisfying u u consider a transverse push off in s 3 of and 2 the cyclic double cover of s 3 branched over by theorem 1 2 there is a filling x of 2 which embeds in r 4 now we will compute d 3 using x we begin with x which is the signature of the intersection form qx let s be any surface in x and take the class s h 2 x then since s embeds in x and x embeds in r 4 s embeds in r 4 and has self intersection 0 thus qx 0 and x 0 next we want to find c 21 x j we know c 1 x j h 2 x z and by poincare duality h 2 x h 2 x x thus let us consider a properly embedded surface f x such that f pd c 1 x j h 2 x x consider the exact sequence 0 h 2 x h 2 x x h 1 x note that for 2 k the branched double cover of a knot k h 1 2 k det k where the determinant of a knot is the alexander polynomial evaluated at 1 thus h 1 x is finite and f h 1 x thus d f 0 for some d 0 for instance d det k in h 1 x so d f s for some closed surface s x and f 2 f 1 d s qx f s d 1 d z since qx 0 we have c 1 x j 2 f 2 0 finally we compute the euler characteristic of x note that x is the branched double cover of a properly embedded disk d in b 4 x 2 d thus if we let d denote a neighbourhood of d in x we compute x 2 b 4 d d b where b is a circle bundle over d thus x 2 0 1 0 1 thus d 3 c 21 x j 3 x 2 x 4 0 3 0 2 1 4 1 2 remark 2 9 note that theorem 1 2 and theorem 1 3 also hold in the case that is a legendrian link if the lagrangian obtained by gluing the lagrangian cobordisms from u to and from to u is a cylinder thus so does theorem 1 4 theorem 1 2 of pla 06 states that for a transverse knot and 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over d 3 is completely determined by the topological link type of and its self linking number sl to this end ito ito 17 provides a formula theorem 2 10 ito 17 if a contact 3 manifold m is a p fold cyclic contact branched covering of s 3 std branched along a transverse link k then d 3 3 4 p 1 k p 1 2 sl k 1 2 p where k is the tristam levine signature of k given by 1 a 1 at where a is the seifert matrix of k and sl k is the self linking number of k 8 wu we apply this formula to 3 braids theorem 2 11 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u and the transverse pushoff of is the closure of a 3 braid then the algebraic length of is 2 proof let be a legendrian knot which satisfies u u and be a transverse pushoff of suppose is the closure of a 3 braid let 2 be a cyclic double cover of s 3 branched over then from 2 10 and 1 4 we get that 1 2 d 3 3 4 2 1 2 1 2 sl 1 2 2 since is slice its signature must vanish 1 2 0 1 2 sl 1 the self linking number of can be computed from this algebraic length and is given by sl len number of strands of len 3 thus len 1 3 2 using the same strategy we can obtain a more general result for n stranded braids corollary 2 12 if is a legendrian knot which satisfies u u and is the closure of n n braid then has self linking number 1 and the algebraic length of is n 1 proof consider the cyclic double cover of s 3 branched over 2 we apply the result of theorem 1 4 and the fact that the signature must vanish to ito s formula d 3 3 4 2 1 k 2 1 2 sl k 1 2 2 1 2 0 1 2 sl 1 1 sl len n 3 open book decompositions and weinstein lefschetz fibrations in this section we find a weinstein domain x whose boundary is 2 where is the closure of a 3 braid with algebraic length 2 for background on weinstein manifolds and their handlebody diagrams see wei 91 ce 12 or the summary in acsg 21 section 2 to find this weinstein domain we begin by expressing 2 as a particular open book decom position a pair f where f is a surface with non empty boundary and the monodromy is a diffeomorphism of f with f id is given by compositions of dehn twists about some curves in f let 1 and 2 be some such curves we denote the composition of dehn twists about these curves as 1 2 1 2 1 2 if is a curve and f is an orientation preserving surface homeomorphism then f f f 1 from this particular open book decomposition we construct a weinstein lefschetz fibration definition 3 1 let x be a compact oriented symplectic 4 manifold let be a compact oriented manifold with dimension 2 a lefschetz fibration x is a smooth surjective map which is a locally trivial fibration except at finitely many isolated nondegenerate critical points with distinct values on the interior of in local coordinates near a critical point the fibration is modelled by z 1 z 2 z 2 1 z 2 2 the lefschetz fibration is symplectic if the fibers are symplectic submanifolds let x 0 be a critical value let x be a generic value take a path x x 0 in a fiber 1 x of a generic value x there is a closed curve c called a vanishing cycle which collapses after parallel transport along this path 1 x 0 can be identified with 1 x by collapsing c to singular ordinary double point obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 9 figure 6 the curves red blue and an example of a curve green on the torus with one boundary component here is the curve of slope 3 4 a lefschetz fibration x where x is a weinstein domain is a weinstein lefschetz fibration if its generic fiber f is also a weinstein domain and if x is obtained by attaching critical weinstein handles along attaching legendrians i f s 1 f d 2 obtained by lifting the vanishing cycles ci f remark 3 1 suppose we have an open book decomposition m s 1 of a contact 3 manifold m with monodromy given by positive dehn twists 1 k about some curves 1 k in f then we can build a lefschetz fibration x d 2 of the stein filling x of m where total monodromy given as the composition of the i dehn twists about vanishing cycles ci collapsing in the critical surfaces 1 xi must agree with the monodromy of the open book as long as the fiber f has a weinstein structure x also has a weinstein structure corresponding to the attachment of critical weinstein handles along the corresponding vanishing cycles to begin our construction we prove the following lemma lemma 3 2 any quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 is conjugate to 1 b 1 b 1 for some braid b proof suppose we have some quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 call it a then a is the product of two conjugates of positive generators of the braid group a bi ib 1 i bj jb 1 j for i j 1 2 for k i j if k 1 let bk b k and if k 2 since 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 let b k bk 1 1 1 2 then a b 1 1 b 1 1 b 2 1 b 1 2 now we can conjugate by b 11 a b 11 b 1 1 b 1 1 b 2 1 b 1 2 b 1 1 b 1 1 b 2 1 b 1 2 b 1 so we take b b 11 b 2 proposition 3 3 let be a transverse knot which is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over 2 has an open book decomposition f where f is a torus with one boundary component and here is the curve of slope 1 0 and is some essential simple closed curve in f see figure 6 proof to prove this we will use the construction from plamenevskaya pla 06 when a contact manifold m is the branched double cover of a transverse link l which is the closure of a 2 k 1 stranded braid given by a braid word on 2 k generators and their inverses 1 1 1 2 k 1 2 k we can think of l as a transverse link in the standard contact structure std on s 3 s 3 has a planar open book decomposition with trivial monodromy and we arrange it so that the pages are transverse to 10 wu figure 7 a torus with one boundary component is the double cover of a planar page branched over 3 points the effect of a half twist in the braid lifts to a dehn twist in the torus the braid l then we may lift the contact structure on the double cover 2 l of s 3 branched over l the contact structure is compatible with the open book decomposition fk 1 where fk 1 is the genus k 1 boundary component surface obtained by taking each planar page branched over the three points where they intersect l see figure 7 and is given by dehn twists corresponding to the braid word which are the lifts of the half twists of l in s 3 thus the monodromy of the open book comes from the braid monodromy each generator i in the braid corresponds to a dehn twist i along a curve in fk 1 let be a transverse knot which is the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over 2 has an open book decomposition f since is a 3 braid f f 1 1 is a torus with one boundary component with 1 corresponding to a dehn twist about and 2 corresponding to a dehn twist about as seen in figure 6 is given by dehn twisting along these curves corresponding to the braid monodromy of by lemma 3 2 is the closure of of a braid of the form 1 b 1 b 1 for some braid b up to conjugation the first 1 corresponds to a dehn twist about the braid b 1 b 1 corresponds to a series of dehn twists 1 m 1 m 1 1 where the i 1 1 correspond to the braid generators in b then since 1 m 1 m 1 1 1 m 1 m 1 1 m we choose 1 m thus the monodromy of the open book decomposition is given by dehn twists along the curve of slope 1 0 and some essential simple closed curve corollary 3 4 let be a transverse knot which is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over 2 has weinstein filling x with the following property x has a weinstein lefschetz fibration x d 2 with generic fiber f a torus with one boundary component and monodromy given by vanishing cycles which are dehn twists along the curves and where is the 1 0 curve and is some essential simple closed curve in f see figure 6 proof let be a transverse knot which is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 by proposition 3 3 the double cover of s 3 branched over 2 has an open book decomposition f where f is a torus with one boundary component and is given by dehn twisting along the curves and where is the 1 0 curve and is some essential simple closed curve in f obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 11 see figure 6 then we may construct a weinstein lefschetz fibration by attaching handles along the lifts of vanishing cycles corresponding to and in a generic fiber f as described in remark 3 1 remark 3 5 repeated dehn twists 1 and 1 about the curve of slope 1 0 and of slope 0 1 in figure 6 transforms the curve to a curve with some slope p q in the torus with one boundary component f 1 1 indeed the mapping class group of the torus with one boundary component is generated by the positive dehn twists and with presentation see fm 12 for details any diffeomorphism of f 1 1 generated by and is equivalent to a dehn twist along some non separating curve with rational slope p q qp 1 q table 1 effect of a dehn twist about or on p q in the torus with one boundary component braid generator dehn twist effect on p q 1 p q 7 p q q 11 1 p q 7 p q q 2 p q 7 p q p 12 1 p q 7 p q p applying an additional dehn twist about or has the result on p q as explained in table 1 thus given any p q with p and q relatively prime a p q curve can be obtained by applying 1 and 1 to 1 0 according to the euclidean algorithm for instance if q p 0 the euclidean algorithm gives q nkp rk p nk 1 rk rk 1 rk nk 2 rk 1 rk 2 r 3 n 3 r 2 r 1 r 2 n 2 r 1 1 r 1 n 1 so if is the curve of slope p q in the torus with one boundary component nk nk 1 nk 2 n 1 lemma 3 6 let be a transverse knot which is not an unknot suppose is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 b then we can always find a braid b equivalent to b up to conjugation such that the procedure in proposition 3 3 yields an open book decomposition with monodromy given by dehn twists along the curves and of slopes 1 0 and p q respectively where 0 p q proof by lemma 3 2 we know is the closure of a braid of the form 1 b 0 1 b 1 0 and that after applying proposition 3 3 2 corresponds to an open book decomposition f where is given by a dehn twist on and on where 1 m 1 m where the i 1 1 correspond to the braid generators in b 0 12 wu by remark 3 5 corresponds to a curve of slope p q qp 1 without loss of generality we may assume that q 0 we know q 6 0 since p q 1 0 corresponds to 2 s 1 s 2 rp 3 but 2 must be a rational homology sphere so there is no such if p 1 then if either q 0 or q 1 then 2 s 3 and so is the unknot thus q 2 notice the following equivalence of braids 1 b 0 1 b 1 0 k 1 1 b 0 1 b 1 0 k 1 1 k 1 b 0 1 b 1 0 k 1 for any k z the braid k 1 b 0 corresponds to the dehn twists k 1 m and the braid k 1 b 0 1 b 1 0 k 1 corresponds to the dehn twists k 1 m 1 m 1 1 k k 1 m since 1 m corresponds to a p q curve applying an additional k instances of to 1 m corresponds to the curve of slope p kq q thus we can replace b 0 with the braid b k 1 b 0 where k z satisfies 0 p kq q we have an equivalence of braids up to

standard form gom 98 for x of the previous corollary to obtain the attaching spheres the 2 handles we will use the recipe laid out by casals and murphy cm 19 which uses the following proposition to determine the attaching maps as simplified contact surgery curves on the boundary proposition 4 1 cm 19 let y be a contact manifold with open book decomposition f and let denote the liouville form on f let s l f be two exact lagrangian submanifolds such that s is diffeomorphic to a sphere suppose that the potential functions s and l where d s s and d l l are c 0 bounded by a small enough 0 and consider the contact manifold y obtained by performing 1 surgery along s an pushoff of by and 1 surgery along 5 s then 1 there exists a canonical contact identification y y and 2 the legendrian 3 l y is legendrian isotopic to 0 s l y in an analogous manner performing contact 1 and 1 surgeries along s and 5 s in y results in a contact manifold y with a contact identification y y under which 3 l y is legendrian isotopic to 1 s l y the recipe of cm 19 is designed to find the attaching spheres in the weinstein diagram by finding the lifts of corresponding vanishing cycles consisting of dehn twists about some known spheres in their paper these vanishing cycles are obtained from a bifibration for our lefschetz fibrations we already have the vanishing cycles in terms of dehn twists so we skip the steps of the recipe which construct the bifibration we list the relevant steps here let x d 2 be a weinstein lefschetz fibration with generic fiber f and vanishing cycles c 1 ck obstructing

projection of their legendrian lifts i f d 2 4 then we consider the legendrian link i i determined by the cyclic ordering of the indices i we push the legendrian component i in the reeb direction by height equal to its index i and this gives a well defined link 5 simplify the weinstein handlebody diagram by applying the legendrian reidemeister moves gompf moves gom 98 see figure 8 handleslides dgs 04 see figure 9 and handle can cellations we apply this recipe to obtain the general form of the weinstein diagram of a filling x of 2 theorem 1 5 let 6 u be a legendrian knot which is smoothly

understand the legendrian lifts we choose the curves and of slopes 1 0 and 0 1 respectively in f see figure 6 to find the legendrian lifts and of and we consider the following let f 0 0 be the open book decomposition given by f 0 f and 0 given by dehn twists and this open book decomposition is the murasugi sum a 1 a 2 where a 1 a 2 are annuli with monodromy given by dehn twists about their cores and see figure 11 thus f 0 0 s 3 s 3 std std s 3 std and the legendrian lifts and of and are the lifts of the cores of the annuli a 1 and a 2 and each correspond to the attaching sphere of a critical

first the diagram given by proposition 4 1 2 we perform a handle slide of the blue curve over the 1 curve 3 and then we cancel out the parallel 1 and 1 surgery curves step 2 is to express and as the images of under words in dehn twists along and is as given for it suffices to find a series of dehn twists about and on the curve 1 0 to obtain the curve with slope p q in the torus with one boundary

legendrian knot which cancels the 1 handle labelled in figure 12 to find we draw the curve nk nk 1 nk 2 n 1 we apply proposition 4 1 repeatedly to obtain the surgery diagram this means repeatedly adding in a 1 and a 1 surgery curve along either or with heights determined by proposition 4 1 see figure 12 and sliding over the current handle to cancel them out we see that applying 1 increases the number of strands going through the topmost 1 handle labelled in figure 12 and applying increases the number of strands going through the bottom 1 handle labelled in figure 12 to begin the lift of 1 is given by figure 13 next assuming n 1 1 applying more twists n 1 1 results in the series of diagrams in figure 14 in n 1 there are now n 1 strands going through the 1 handle labelled and 1 strand going through the 1 handle labelled we now apply to n 1 resulting in the series of diagrams in figure 15 in n 1 there are now n 1 strands going through the 1 handle labelled and n 1 1 strands going through the 1 handle labelled now assuming n 2 1 we apply n 2 1 to n 1 we obtain the diagrams in figure 16 in the last diagram showing n 2 n 1 we can count n 1 strands going through the handle labelled and n 1 n 2 1 strands going through the handle labelled 16 wu 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 figure 14 how to draw the legendrian lift of n 1 shaded pink ribbons repre sent n 1 1 parallel 1 and 1 curves given by proposition 4 1 describing these 7 diagrams in order 1 1 2 n 1 1 parallel 1 and 1 curves added in 3 we slide the blue curve over the lowest of the parallel 1 curves the topmost pink ribbon now represents n 1 2 parallel strands 4 gompf 5 5 reidemeister 3 6 repeat steps 3 6 with remaining 1 curves and 7 we cancel the 1 and 1 curves to obtain n 1 we continue to apply successive ni and nj twists to the curve in doing so we obtain the diagrams of figure 17 applying ni results in the top row of diagrams and applying nj results in the bottom row of diagrams the count of strands passing through the 1 handles after each successive step correspond to the ri in the euclidean algorithm in the case that n 1 1 the diagrams in figure 14 reflected horizontally give the n 2 1 reflected versions of figures 15 and 16 give 1 n 2 1 and n 3 n 2 1 respectively in general we still end up with the diagrams of figure 17 with every additional application of nj resulting in the top row of diagrams and every additional application of ni resulting in the bottom row of diagrams since p q the final dehn twist applied will be a 1 so the final diagram will correspond to the bottom right of figure 17 with q strands going through the top 1 handle and p strands going through the bottom 1 handle we have found a legendrian representative for we proceed with step 4 since we are dealing with only 2 curves the lifts of and we choose the cyclic ordering that places above giving us the top left diagram of figure 18 step 5 is to simplify the handle diagram we do so following figure 18 by some knot isotopies a handle slide and cancelling the bottom 1 handle with the resulting diagram has one 2 handle winding about a single 1 handle q times we can see this in the attaching curve in the bottom right of figure 18 which is colour coded the blue shaded region represents p parallel curves and the green shaded region represents q p parallel curves obstructing lagrangian concordance for

corollary 3 4 the double cover of s 3 branched over this knot has a weinstein lefschetz fibration x d 2 with generic fibre f a torus with one boundary component containing vanishing cycles given by and 3 which are curves of slope 1 0 and 1 3 respectively following the steps in the proof of theorem 1 5 we obtain the lift of the 1 3 curve and the surgery diagram d m 820 as in figure 19 remark 4 3 this strategy can be used to obtain the weinstein diagram x for a filling of 2 where is a quasipositive n braid of algebraic length n 1 note that other n braids are obstructed obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 19 1 1 1 1 figure 17 coloured ribbons represent some number of parallel strands in the top row we apply dehn twists nj and see the resulting diagram the step by

handleslide the blue curves over the red curve 3 cancel the bottom 1 handle with the red curve 4 perform a series of reidemeister moves on the parallel blue curves from the lagrangian double concordance by corollary 2 12 however the generic fiber of the lefschetz fibration of x for an n stranded braid will have an additional 1 handle for each additional strand because of this added complexity the class of possible vanishing cycles cannot be classified as easily as in the 3 braid case furthermore the weinstein diagram will involve the attachment of n 1 2 handles 20 wu 1 1 figure 19 d m 820 the weinstein diagram for the filling of the double cover of the transverse m 820 knot following theorem 1 5 figure 20 on the left the fiber of the weinstein lefschetz fibration of a

corresponding to a filling of the double cover of m 10140 the legendrian lifts of and 3 are arranged in increasing reeb height in orange red and turquoise respectively we then perform a series of handle slides handle cancellations and reidemeister moves thus while it follows naturally to generate the weinstein diagram of an n braid in specific examples it is more difficult to generate the weinstein diagram for a general n braid example 4 4 we can for instance let have the same smooth type as the mirror of the 10140 knot which is given by the quasipositive 4 stranded braid 31 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 according to bnmea the braid has algebraic length 3 the legendrian contact homology dga of m 10140 is stable tame isomorphic to the dga of the standard unknot and thus lagrangian concordance from to the unknot cannot be obstructed by contact homology techniques we use the construction from this chapter to construct a familiar weinstein handlebody diagram of a filling of 2 so that it follows from the work of the subsequent sections of this paper that m 10140 cannot be concordant to the unknot first we perform a cyclic conjugation to work with the equivalent braid word 2 3 1 2 3 3 1 2 3 1 then an open book decomposition of 2 has pages consisting of the torus with two boundary components and monodromy given by dehn twists about the curves and then 3 where and are the curves in on the fiber shown in figure 20 we attach handles along these curves to obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 21 obtain a weinstein lefschetz fibration of a filling of 2 the legendrian lifts and are also pictured in figure 20 the legendrian lifts of and then 3 given by proposition 4 1 are arranged with their relative reeb heights given by their order in the monodromy in figure 21 this is a weinstein handlebody diagram corresponding to the filling we simplify the diagram to obtain a familiar weinstein diagram seen previously in example 4 2 5 the legendrian contact homology dga in this section we compute the legendrian contact homology dga of the knots in the diagrams d of the previous section drawn in s 1 s 2 let l be the knot depicted in the diagram d we ll denote its legendrian contact homology dga as al l for details on how to compute the legendrian contact homology dga for legendrian knots see en 19 in our situation since l winds about a 1 handle we follow the process in en 15 and the simplification in el 19 we now briefly summarize this procedure we begin by taking the lagrangian resolution of l following ng 03 where the lagrangian projection of l is depicted with additional 1 handle half twist from definition 2 3 of en 15 see for instance figure 23 the dga is the associative noncommutative unital algebra over the base ring z t t 1 e 1 where e 1 is an idempotent element generated by reeb chords of the legendrian knot ak c 0 i j c 1 i j the ak generators correspond to crossings of the knot called the external generators and the c 0 i j c 1 i j generators correspond to a subset of the reeb chords in the 1 handle called the internal generators the differentials of the external generators come from a count of certain immersed disks in l with corners at reeb chords of the crossings or the 1 handle the differentials of the internal generators are c 0 i j n m 1 i mc 0 i mc 0 m j c 1 i j i j n m 1 i mc 0 i mc 1 m j n m 1 i mc 1 i mc 0 m j where i j e 1 if i j and 0 otherwise we extend l by the signed leibniz rule the grading comes from a chosen maslov potential a kind of locally constant map on the strands of l that changes by 1 when traversing a cusp in the front diagram 5 1 computing the dga we now explicitly compute al l we label the crossings in the lagrangian resolution of l that were present in the front projection ie the crossings on the left side of the diagram with ai with the left most crossing labelled a we label crossings which come from the 1 handle twist of the lagrangian resolution with bi so that the indices increase from left to right starting with the bottom row and moving upwards we place a marked point at the minimum point of the top strand exiting the 1 handle on the left and we label the marked point t see the partially labelled figure 22 and the fully labelled examples of the lagrangian resolution of d where is the m 820 knot in figure 24 and where is the 10155 knot in figure 26 we can now compute the legendrian contact homology dga al l since there are no cusps we assign each strand the maslov potential 0 the generators are a a 1 ak b 1 bl c 0 i j for 1 i j q and c 1 i j for 1 i j q the gradings of the generators are as follows t a ai bi 0 c 0 i j 1 c 1 i j 1 the differentials of generators of the internal dga are c 0 i j q m 1 c 0 i mc 0 m j c 1 i j i j q m 1 c 0 i mc 1 m j q m

other crossing are labelled ai if they are in the region on the left and bj if they are in the region on the right where i j e 1 if i j and is 0 otherwise the differentials of the external dga are given by the count of immersed disks notably a from the leftmost crossing of figure 22 has one contributing disk to its left labelled c 0 p p 1 in the differential each of the differentials bi for i 1

particular d lemma 5 1 let k be the legendrian knot of a diagram d let q be the number of strands passing through the 1 handle then the terms a b 1 bq 1 do not appear in any differentials of the legendrian contact homology dga ak z e 1 as degree 1 monomials proof suppose a appears in the differential of some generator then there is an immersed disk with a negative corner at a the boundary of this immersed disk must follow one of the strands from a to the left suppose it s the overcrossing strand then the strand immediately enters the 1 handle so a appears in the differential in a word of the form 1 ac 0 i p 2 or 1 c 0 i pa 2 where i p and i is some other string of generators possibly an empty one likewise if it s the undercrossing strand we obstructing lagrangian concordance for

immediately reach the 1 handle to the left of the crossing so a appears in the differential in a word of the form 1 ac 0 i p 1 2 or 1 c 0 i p 1 a 2 i p 1 we can make an equivalent argument for any of the bi following their overcrossing and undercrossing strands to the left or right as we see that we do not meet any negative corners until we reach the 1 handle since we have quotiented out the constant terms any monomials of the form e 1 and the differential on products is generated by the leibniz rule the only way to obtain a monomial of smaller degree is if there is a constant term in one of the differentials but no such term exists thus a b 1 bq 1 cannot appear as a degree 1 monomial in the differential of some product of generators example 5 2 in this example we fully compute the internal and external dga of d where d is the weinstein diagram from example 4 2 and example 4 4 the lagrangian resolution of d is the diagram on the right of figure 23 we can then label the crossings which generate the dga as in figure 24 the generators are t a a 1 b 1 b 2 b 3 c 0 i j for 1 i j 3 and c 1 i j for 1 i j 3 then the gradings of the generators are t a a 1 b 1 b 2 b 3 0 c 0 i j 1 c 1 i

nonvanishing symplectic homology in this section we use the legendrian contact homology dga to understand symplectic homology of the weinstein manifold given by handle attachments according to d symplectic homology and cohomology are very useful invariants of exact symplectic manifolds with contact type boundaries introduced by viterbo in vit 99 symplectic homology can be used to prove the existence of closed hamiltonian orbits and reeb chords and the wrapped fukaya category fss 08 is built using the wrapped floer cohomology which are modules over the symplectic cohomology ring for non compact symplectic manifolds see sei 08 for a survey on symplectic homology work of bourgeois and oancea first related symplectic homology to linearized contact homology bo 09 and a way to compute symplectic homology via the legendrian contact homology dga was established by bourgeois ekholm and eliashberg in bee 12 ekh 19 in this section we summarize and apply the results of bee 12 we begin with corollary 5 7 of bee 12 which states theorem 6 1 bee 12 sh x lhho l where lhho l is the homology of the hochschild complex associated to the legendrian contact ho mology differential graded algebra of l over q thus in order to compute the symplectic homology sh x we first compute lhho l lho l l ho l defined as follows we consider the dga al defined in the previous section and generated by cyclically composable monomials of reeb chords let lho l al let lho l lho l e 1 be the subalgebra of lho l generated by non trivial cyclically composable monomials of reeb chords let lho l lho l and let l ho l lho l 1 that is lho l with grading shifted up by 1 now given a monomial w c 1 cl lho l we denote the corresponding elements in lho l and l ho l as w c 1 cl and w c 1 cl respectively the hat or check may mark a variable in the monomial which is not the first one in which case the monomial is the word obtained by the graded cyclic permutation which puts the marked letter in the first position let s lho l ho denote the linear operator defined by the formula s c 1 cl c 1 c 2 cl 1 c 1 c 1 c 2 cl 1 c 1 cl c 1 c 2 c l then the differential dho lh ho lhho is given by dho d lho dm ho 0 d lho the maps in the matrix on generators are as follows obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 25 1 if w lho l is a monomial then d lho w r j 1 v j where dlho w al w r j 1 vj for monomials vj 2 if c is a chord and w is a monomial such that cw lho l then d lho c w s dlho c w 1 c 1 c dlho w 3 if w c 1 cl lho then dm ho w c 1 cl c 1 c l remark 6 2 note that dm ho is zero on linear monomials now we can define lhho l lhho l c l where c l is the vector space generated by a single element 1 of grading 0 then the differential dho lh ho l lhho l is defined as dho dho 0 ho 0 for any chord c we define ho c nc 1 where nc is the count of the zero dimensional moduli space of holomorphic disks asymptotic to at c then we have the following proposition 6 3 bee 12 d 2 ho 0 and the homology lhho l h lhho l dho is independent of choices and is a legendrian isotopy invariant of l we apply theorem 6 1 to the diagrams d obtained in section 4 to obtain the following theorem theorem 1 6 let 6 u be a legendrian knot which is smoothly the closure of a quasipositive 3 braid of algebraic length 2 let be a positive transverse push off of then there is a filling of 2 the double cover of s 3 branched over which has nonvanishing symplectic homology proof let x be the filling of 2 given by the weinstein handle decomposition depicted in d we will show that sh x lhho l is nonzero by finding a w v ai i lho l l ho l c l lhho such that dho w v ai i 0 but w v ai i im dho first we consider the legendrian contact homology dga al lho l of the link l in the weinstein diagram d recall that d is constructed via surgery on a p q and a 1 0 curve in the torus with one boundary component and consists of the attaching curves of a single 2 handle and a single 1 handle since 6 u by lemma 3 6 we choose p and q satisfing 0 p q the attaching sphere of the 2 handle winds around the 1 handle q times as in subsection 5 1 we will write ai or a to denote generators coming from crossings present in the front diagram bi to denote generators coming from crossings formed by the lagrangian resolution and c 0 i j c 1 i j to denote generators coming from the internal reeb chords within the 1 handle in particular consider the generators a and bi 1 i q 1 as labelled in figure 22 the differentials for these generators are computed explicitly in the previous subsection see note that every c 0 i i 1 appears in this collection of differentials twice with the marked point giving an extra t coefficient only to the term c 0 q p 1 q p 2 in bp 1 when p 1 note also that since p q 1 for any i 6 j bi 6 bj let c ta q 1 i 1 it sibi where we choose si 0 1 and i 1 1 using the following procedure 26 wu figure 25 a front diagram of d where is the knot 10155 1 let c 0 a q 1 i 1 bi rearrange the terms in sum c

c 0 i 1 j 1 tc 0 q p 1 q p 2 c 0 1 2 c 0 1 2 c 0 p 1 p 2 c 0 q p q p 1 a b 1 b q 1 a q 1 j 1 b j 2 for i 1 q 1 if bi b j and j p 1 let si 1 otherwise let si 0 if p 1 si 0 for all i 3 let i 1 j then a c 0 consider the element c c 1 lhho l then a c dlho c 0 so dlho c 0 thus we obtain the following d lho c 0 d lho c 0 dm ho c 0 by remark 6 2 finally ho counts the zero dimensional moduli space of holomorphic disks asymptotic to reeb chords at these are disks with boundary consisting of a smooth curve along the front diagram that does not pass through a negative corner since the curves in d pass monotonically left to right any such boundary would necessarily have a negative corner at the 1 handle thus ho c 0 thus we conclude that dho c c 1 0 to see that c c 1 im dho note that in the image of dlho is generated by the differentials of the generators of al e 1 thus we can apply lemma 5 1 and we know that the terms a b 1 bq 1 do not appear in any differentials of al e 1 as degree 1

doubly slice meaning that it appears as a cross section of an unknotted s 2 in s 4 lm 15 however from the main theorem we can conclude that it cannot be lagrangian doubly slice in this example we compute the dga and find the cycle c explicitly for this example the transverse 10155 is the closure of the braid 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 cdgw by corollary 3 4 its double cover has a weinstein lefschetz fibration x d 2 with generic fibre f a punctured torus and vanishing cycles given by and 2 1 which are curves of slope 1 0 and 2 5 respectively following theorem 1 5 we obtain the surgery

cycle in the symplectic homology of the filling depicted in d as described in the proof of theorem 1 6 is given by c c 1 where c ta 1 tb 3 b 1 b 4 b 2 we see that c 0 7 the main theorem we will use the filling with nonzero symplectic homology of the previous section along with a result of mclean mcl 09 to prove theorem 1 1 mclean s result is based on the work of viterbo in vit 99 specifically viterbo functoriality which says that a codimension 0 exact embedding of a symplectic manifold with boundary into another induces a transfer map on the symplectic homologies between them more precisely theorem 7 1 vit 99 suppose w d is an exact symplectic manifold with a liouville vector field which is transverse at the boundary suppose w 0 w is an embedding of a compact codimension 0 submanifold then there exists a natural homomorphism sh w d sh w 0 d moreover this map along with the natural map on relative singular homology h w w h w 0 w 0 forms the following commutative diagram h n w w h n w 0 w 0 sh w d sh w 0 d mclean checked that this transfer map was in fact a unital ring map and proved the following theorem cor 10 5 in mcl 09 theorem 7 2 mcl 09 let x and w be compact convex symplectic manifolds suppose w is subcrit ical suppose sh x 6 0 then x cannot be embedded in w as an exact codimension 0 submanifold in particular if h 1 x 0 then x cannot be symplectically embedded into w we prove the main theorem theorem 1 1 let u be the standard tb 1 unknot let be a legendrian knot satisfying u u and 6 u then cannot be smoothly the closure of a 3 braid proof we proceed by contradiction suppose 6 u is smoothly the closure of a 3 braid which satisfies u u must be quasipositive has a positive transverse push off of the same topological knot type by remark 2 3 is transversely isotopic to a quasipositive 3 braid by corollary 2 11 must have algebraic length 2 by theorem 1 5 d is the weinstein diagram of a filling of 2 call it x by theorem 1 6 x has nonzero symplectic homology next we ll show that x embeds in b 4 as a codimension 0 exact submanfold recall the construc tion from the proof of theorem 1 3 in particular we will need the submanifold v of p c where c is the symplectic approximation of the lagrangian concordance cylinder of u u here we fix p 2 then we have v 2 s 3 in the proof of theorem 1 3 we showed that any 4 manifold constructed by gluing a filling of 2 to v must embed in a blow up of b 4 let x be the branched double cover of b 4 branched over the symplectic disk bounding then the manifold we get by gluing x to v along 2 is b 4 then we obtain the following mayer vietoris sequence h 3 b 4 h 2 2 h 2 x h 2 v h 2 b 4 obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 29 2 is a rational homology sphere thus h 2 2 q 0 then since h 3 b 4 q h 2 x q h 2 b 4 0 we have that h 2 v q 0 now instead take w x v to be the manifold obtained by gluing x to v we obtain the following mayer vietoris sequence h 2 2 h 2 x h 2 v h 2 w h 1 2 from d we see that x is constructed via attaching a single 1 handle and a single 2 handle to a 0 handle the 2 handle is attached along a curve which runs along the 1 handle nontrivially thus h 2 x q 0 and since h 2 2 q h 2 v q h 1 2 q 0 h 2 w q 0 thus w must be minimal so w is b 4 which is subcritical since x has a weinstein structure it is exact and convex this contradicts theorem 7 2 thus if satisfies u u 6 u then is not smoothly the closure of a 3 braid additionally the following result about contact embeddings follows from the proof of theorem 1 1 the double covers of s 3 branched over a quasipositive transverse knot which is the closure of a 3 braid of algebraic length 2 form an infinite family of contact manifolds which are rational homology spheres but do not embed in r 4 as contact type hypersurfaces motivated by the work of mark and tosun mt 21 corollary 1 7 let 2 be the double cover of s 3 branched over a quasipositive transverse knot which is the closure of a 3 braid of algebraic length 2 suppose is not the unknot then 2 does not embed as a contact type hypersurface in r 4 proof suppose 2 be the double cover of s 3 branched over a quasipositive transverse knot which is the closure of a 3 braid of algebraic length 2 suppose is not the unknot suppose 2 embeds as a contact type hypersurface in r 4 then it bounds a codimension 0 symplectic submanifold of r 4 call it x we now follow the same arguments as in the proof of theorem 1 1 to reach a contradiction we have a mayer vietoris sequence h 3 r 4 h 2 2 h 2 x h 2 r 4 x h 2 r 4 so h 2 x 0 consider r 4 x which has boundary 2 we can glue in the filling x of 2 corresponding to the diagramd of theorem 1 5 along the boundary 2 letw r 4 x x by p 311 of gro 85 w r 4 mcp 2 for some m 0 we have another mayer vietoris sequence h 2 p h 2 x h 2 b 4 x h 2 w h 1 p thus h 2 w 0 and we know that w is r 4 thus x embeds as an exact codimension 0 submanifold of w r 4 by theorem 1 6 x has nonzero symplectic homology thus by theorem 7 2 x cannot embed in r 4 a contradiction remark 7 3 the family of contact manifolds described by this corollary corresponds precisely to the stein rational homology balls in the boundary of the weinstein diagrams of figure 10 as contact surgery diagrams we depict these manifolds in figure 27 we note that the methods in this paper exclude specifically the contact structures determined by the double branched covers from embedding as contact type hypersurfaces and not necessarily all tight contact structures on these manifolds to see that these 2 of corollary 1 7 are indeed an infinite family we distinguish infinitely many of them using their first homology which we can compute from their contact surgery diagrams 30 wu figure 27 the weinstein diagram of x left and the corresponding surgery di agram of 2 right here the shaded blue region represents p parallel strands green represents q p parallel strands and purple represents q parallel strands where 0 p q and p q 1 figure 28 the weinstein diagram of x k with k strands entering the 1 handle left and the corresponding surgery diagram of 2 k right lemma 7 4 there are infinitely many non homeomorphic manifolds which are double covers of s 3 branched over quasipositive transverse knots which are the closures of 3 braids of algebraic length 2 proof consider the 3 braids k 1 k 2 1 k 2 for k z k 2 let k be a transverse knot which is the closure of k by proposition 3 3 there is an open book decomposition of the double cover of s 3 branched over k 2 k with pages consisting of tori with one boundary component and monodromy where is a 1 0 curve and is a curve with slope 1 k then by theorem 1 5 2 k has a filling x k with surgery diagram as in figure 28 we can replace the 1 handle in this diagram with a 0 framed surgery on an unknot to obtain a surgery diagram of 2 k as in figure 28 we call the unknot u and the other knot l we see that u has linking number k with l so their linking matrix is 0 k k tb l 1 which has determinant k 2 thus h 1 2 k k 2 thus 2 k is not homeomorphic to 2 j for j 6 k remark 7 5 we note that the orientation reversed version of the family of manifolds depicted in figure 28 has been previously studied using different methods by tosun tos 22 for k 6 2 where it is shown that these manifolds do not embed smoothly in r 4 and by nemirovski and siegel ns 16 for k 2 where it is shown that this manifold cannot be a contact type hypersurface obstructing lagrangian concordance for closures of 3 braids 31 references acsg 21 bahar acu orsola capovilla searle agne s
