a note on pure braids and link concordance miriam kuzbary abstract the knot concordance group can be contextualized as organizing problems about 3 and 4 dimensional spaces and the relationships between them every 3 manifold is surgery on some link not necessarily a knot and thus it is natural to ask about such a group for links in 1988 le dimet constructed the string link concordance groups and in 1998 habegger and lin precisely characterized these groups as quotients of the link concordance sets using a group action notably the knot concordance group is abelian while for each n the string link concordance group on n strands is non abelian as it contains the pure braid group on n strands as a subgroup in this work we prove that even the quotient of each string link concordance group by its pure braid subgroup is non abelian 1 introduction a knot is a smooth embedding of s 1 into s 3 and an n component link is a smooth embedding of n disjoint copies of s 1 into s 3 the set of knots modulo a 4 dimensional equivalence relation called concordance forms the celebrated knot con cordance group c using the operation connected sum while the set of n component links modulo concordance does not have a well defined connected sum even when the links are ordered and oriented fm 66 as a result multiple notions of link concordance group have arisen in the literature with somewhat different structural properties hos 67 ld 88 do 12 we focus on the n strand string link concordance group c n of le dimet as it is the only link concordance group which is non abelian this is in stark contrast to the original knot concordance group which is abelian and thus is perhaps a further indicator of the complexity of the link concordance story while each link has an infinite number of distinct string link representatives the correspondence between links and their string link representatives was characterized by habegger and lin using the action of c 2 n on c n hl 98 in particular a string link is trivial in this group exactly when the link in s 3 it represents is concordant to the unlink the string link concordance group is known to be non abelian as it contains p n the pure braid group on n strands as a proper subgroup ld 88 therefore it is not clear whether c n being non abelian is merely an inherited property from its pure braid subgroup this question can be viewed as in some sense complementary to the question of classifying links up to link homotopy answered in hl 90 as every string link is link homotopic to a pure braid understanding how p n sits inside c n is made more difficult by the fact that p n is not a normal subgroup for n 2 klw 98 therefore we must instead consider the quotient of c n by the normal closure ncl p n despite this difficulty we have proven the following theorem theorem 1 1 c n ncl p n is non abelian for all n 1 ar x iv 2 00 9 04 64 1 v 1 m at h g t 1 0 s ep 2 02 0 2 miriam kuzbary it is natural to further ask about the structure of the quotient group c n ncl p n and we have made the following observation proposition 1 2 c n ncl p n has a central subgroup isomorphic to n c notice that theorem 1 1 leads to questions about how close this quotient is to being abelian more precisely is the quotient solvable it is important to note that the pure braid group itself is residually nilpotent conjecture 1 3 c n is not solvable and neither is c n ncl p n there are many natural questions arising from these results including does c n ncl p n contain elements of finite order what is the abelianization of c n ncl p n how do the images of the n solvable filtration and bipolar filtration behave in this quotient what can be said about the structure of ncl p n itself and more pre cisely which properties of p n are preserved in this closure 2 proofs and tools used in proofs in this section we carefully define n component string links and the equivalence relation on them required to form a group we then outline the main invariants used to obstruct the relevant quotient being abelian and present proofs of the results definition 2 1 n component string link let d be the unit disk i the unit interval and p 1 p 2 pk be n points in the interior of d an n component pure string link is a smooth proper embedding m i d i such that ii 0 pi 0 ii 1 pi 1 as is typical in the study of knots and links we will often abuse notation and use to refer to both the map itself and to its image embedded in d 2 i notice that a n component string link is an n strand pure braid when each slice d 2 t is the n punctured disk just as we can take the closure of a braid we can take the closure of a string link and get a link in s 3 note that not every link is the closure of a pure braid however every link is the closure of a pure string link in the following way first introduce an embedded disk intersecting each component of l once positively then cut open s 3 along this disk to get a collection of n knotted arcs in d 2 i in order to multiply string links 1 and 2 glue d 2 1 1 to d 2 0 2 by the identity map on d 2 geometrically this multiplication is exactly what one would obtain from taking two closed n component links l 1 and l 2 in s 3 choosing basing disks 1 and 2 for each link which would give 1 and 2 if one were to cut open along them and then band summing the ith strand of l 1 with the i th strand of l 2 exactly at the points l 1 i 1 and l 1 i 2 note that the set of n component pure string links merely forms a monoid and not a group and therefore to define inverses we consider the following notion a note on pure braids and link concordance 3 definition 2 2 string link concordance two n component string links 1 and 2 are concordant if there is a smooth embedding h m i i b 3 i which is transverse to the boundary such that h m i 0 1 h m i 1 2 h m i i j 0 idi with j 0 m i s 2 now we can see the inverse of a string link is simply reflected across d 2 1 more precisely if r i i is the reflection map r t 1 t rt idd 2 r and rs n i 1 r then 1 rs rt theorem 2 3 ld 88 the set of n component string links modulo string link concordance with the above binary operation forms a group which we will notate as c n it is clear through taking string link closures that concordant string links close to form concordant links in s 3 and furthermore that c 1 is isomorphic to the usual knot concordance group c 2 1 milnor s invariants the main result in this work was proven using milnor s invariants these integer valued concordance invariants first defined by milnor in 1957 can be interpreted as higher order linking numbers and computed in many different ways roughly these invariants detect how deep the longitudes of an n component link l g 1 s 3 l lie in the lower central series gq of the link group of the link group g the mechanism for doing so involves comparing the nilpotent quotients g gq to those of the free group f on n letters and using combinatorial group theoretic techniques to analyze the longitudes in these quo tients in a sense we can view this process as taking the taylor expansion in non commuting variables of each longitude using fox calculus the milnor s invari ants are exactly the coefficients of the resulting polynomial modulo a subset of lower order coefficients it is certainly not obvious that such things would be concordance invariants it is a deep result that the entire nilpotent quotients g gq themselves are link concordance invariants and that milnor s invariants extract concordance data from these quotients these invariants are difficult to compute however due to cochran we have an algorithm for computing the non vanishing milnor s invariants of lowest weight which should be thought of as the lowest degree coefficients of the aforementioned polynomials using surface systems the main idea relies on the celebrated theo rem of turaev and porter which relates milnor s invariants to massey products on the link exterior cochran s process dualizes the massey product defining system machinery to use intersections of surfaces instead of cup products of cochains for details of the construction see coc 90 recall that one of the unique properties of c n is that it is nonabelian for n 1 ld 88 this is because it contains the pure braid group p n as a subgroup therefore it is not clear whether this non abelian property is merely inherited from the pure braid group this question is made far more difficult by the following fact theorem 2 4 kirk livingston wang klw 98 p n is not a normal subgroup of c n for n 2 4 miriam kuzbary 2 2 proofs theorem 1 1 c n ncl p n is non abelian for all n proof first notice that the milnor invariant p iijj 0 with i 6 j for any pure braid p p n this is because this milnor s invariant only depends on the 2 component sublinks p of p namely the link whose components are the ith and jth components of p and two component pure braids are simply full twists therefore the only non vanishing p i is exactly the linking number p 12 now let b ncl p n with all pairwise linking numbers zero for reasons which will soon be clear we see that b ml 1 slpls 1 l where pl p n and sl c n for all l now by theorem 8 12 in coc 90 we see that m l 1 slpls 1 l iijj m 1 slpls 1 l iijj again slpls 1 l iijj will depend only on the 2 component sublinks of each string link slpls 1 l made up of the i th and jth components of slpls 1 l each of these sublinks will be a product of the ith and jth components of sl pl and s 1 l we will show what happens for a specific l call these components l p and l 1 l l l l figure 1 pushing the string link l along the full twists p as is clear in figure 1 p is a product of full twists and thus we can slide l along the twisting region to obtain the word pll 1 we see this string link is concordant to p and thus slpls 1 l iijj p iijj 0 finally this tells us b iijj 0 what we have now shown is that any b ncl p n with vanishing pairwise linking numbers also has vanishing sato levine invariants hence to prove the theorem it will suffice to show a commutator in c 2 has a non vanishing sato levine invariant note that any commutator of string links has pairwise linking number 0 and there is no indeterminacy in computing the c 1122 where c is the closure consider the link c in figure 2 it is the commutator of a representative of the hopf link with a representative of the whitehead link to build a surface system we will first label the components c x and c y and think of these curves as indexed by meridional generators x and y in 1 s 3 l the closure c bounds surfaces v x and v y as in figure 3 these surfaces v x and v y intersect in the curve c yx in figure 4 with two components and one can think of this curve as being indexed by the commutator y x in order to be careful and consistent with orientations as in coc 90 we will consider this curve as the intersection v y v x and orient it so the triple c yx positive normal of v y positive normal of v x gives the right handed orientation of s 3 a note on pure braids and link concordance 5 figure 2 c c 2 c 2 with c iijj 1 a a surface v x b a surface v y figure 3 two surfaces in a surface system of weight 4 for c all linkings of c x c y and c yx with their pushoffs of weight 3 vanish and the only non trivial linking of weight 4 is lk c yx c yx 1 thus c 1122 1 by coc 90 this proves the result for n 2 now consider the link i c n whose first two strands are isotopic to c and whose remaining n 2 strands are trivial this link is also a commutator and we immediately see i 1122 1 therefore the result follows proposition 1 2 c n ncl p n has a central subgroup isomorphic to n c 6 miriam kuzbary figure 4 the curve c yx v y v x note that it has two components proof the result follows from a series of simple observations first note that any string link of the form ki which is split with i th strand isotopic to a knot k s 3 cut open at a point and all other strands trivial will commute with any string link by simply sliding k along the ith strand of ki furthermore note that ki jl is k j i if i l and if i 6 l it is the split link with ith component isotopic tok split open at a point and lth component isotopic to j split open at a point therefore the set ki k c i 1 n generates n c furthermore no element in this set is in ncl p n as each component of an element of ncl p n must have slice components this is clear as pure braids have unknotted components 2 3 acknowledgments the author was supported by an nsf graduate re search fellowship under grant no 1450681 as well as an aauw
