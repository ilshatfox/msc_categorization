links and planar diagram codes matt mastin abstract in this paper we formalize a combinatorial object for describing link diagrams called a planar diagram code pd codes are used by the knottheory mathematica package developed by bar natan et al we present the set of pd codes as a stand alone object and discuss its relationship with link diagrams we give an explicit algorithm for reconstructing a knot diagram on a surface from a pd code we also discuss the intrinsic symmetries of pd codes i e invertibility and chirality the moves analogous to the reidemeister moves are also explored and we show that the given set of pd codes modulo these combinatorial reidemeister moves is equivalent to classical link theory 1 introduction while the connection between gauss codes and link diagrams has been widely examined in the litera ture see for example chapter 17 of gr 00 not much attention has been given to alternate combinatorial descriptions of link diagrams the goal of this paper is to formalize another combinatorial object called a planar diagram code pd code which can also represent link diagrams we will take the approach of defining pd codes as stand alone objects and then present their correspondence with link diagrams this perspective has the advantage of producing a more general set of objects than the classical link diagrams similar observations have been made such as the ones by kauffman kau 99 nelson nel 11 and jablan et al jrs 11 we will also give explicit algorithms for reconstructing the link diagram on a surface from a pd code and discuss what information is lost when describing a diagram with a pd code a similar algorithm for reconstructing a diagram from a gauss code has been discussed by kauffman kau 99 pd codes and gauss codes are closely related each contains enough information to reconstruct a link diagram however pd codes can be more useful for computation because the combinatorial information is more explicit this is evidenced by the fact that the knottheory mathematica package bn 11 developed by dror bar natan and his students makes use of pd codes for presenting link diagrams section 2 will give the basic definitions of link diagrams and pd codes while section 3 describes the cor respondence between pd codes and link diagrams we will then discuss the analogues of the reidemeister moves in section 4 in section 5 we will discuss the intrinsic symmetries of pd codes and then finish with a section on future directions 2 link diagrams and pd codes we begin with our definition of an oriented and labeled link diagram this definition is more or less standard but we will be using the language of both graphs and link diagrams the following will serve as our dictionary between these two viewpoints definition 1 let s be a smooth closed oriented not necessarily connected surface a labeled oriented link diagram on s is a smooth oriented immersion d tns 1 s of n disjoint circles into the surface with date february 5 2018 1 ar x iv 1 30 9 32 88 v 1 m at h g t 1 2 s ep 2 01 3 2 matt mastin 1 1 figure 1 over and under crossings here the orientation is taken to be the standard orientation of the plane of the page finitely many transverse double self intersections and no other self intersections we take the circles tns 1 to be ordered call the self intersections of the immersion vertices and the arcs between vertices edges so a diagram is in particular an embedded 4 regular graph on s a diagram also includes a labeling of the edges by pairs i j where i is the index of the s 1 which contains the edge and the j s give a cyclic ordering of the edges so a diagram is in particular a 4 regular graph a graph in which all vertices have degree 4 on s with with a preferred covering by oriented circuits in the case of a knot n 1 we will omit the first element in the pair the vertices will also be called crossings and are equipped with a coloring by the set 1 1 called the sign of the crossing two diagrams are equivalent if there is an isotopy of s which brings one diagram to the other respecting the labeling of the edges and the signs of the crossings we will denote the set of equivalence classes of diagrams by d a link diagram is split if one can embed a circle in s disjoint from the diagram so that each connected component of s contains part of the diagram edges that are oriented toward the vertex will be called incoming edges and the others will be called outgoing each pair of non adjacent edges will be referred to as either the over edges or the under edges as determined by the sign of the crossing as shown in figure 1 it is a standard result that a link in a thickened surface s 1 1 can be recovered from a link diagram on s the more interesting question of recovering a link from combinatorial data will be covered in the following section but first we will discuss how to encode the information contained in a link diagram in a pd code a pd code is a set comprised of quadruples where each entry in a quadruple may be viewed as an edge in a link diagram and each quadruple corresponds to a crossing definition 2 given a link diagram on an oriented surface s we generate the set of quadruples of the pd code representing this diagram by the following procedure for each crossing we include the quadruple of arc labels involved beginning with the incoming under edge and proceeding around the crossings in the positively oriented direction of s see figures 2 and 3 we give a positive sign to incoming edges and a negative sign to outgoing edges in truth the signs appearing in a pd code are extraneous they can be recovered by traversing the edges of each component in their ordering remembering that the first label in a quadruple is the incoming under links and planar diagram codes 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 figure 2 a diagram for 31 and its pd code the labels are only single integers here as there is only one component note that we may omit directional arrows as the orientation can be inferred from the ordering of the edge labels 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 1 6 1 2 1 7 1 1 1 2 1 8 1 3 1 7 2 1 1 9 2 2 1 8 1 9 2 1 1 10 2 4 1 10 1 6 1 1 1 5 2 2 1 4 2 3 1 3 1 4 2 4 1 5 2 3 figure 3 a diagram of the link 727 and the corresponding pd code crossing however keeping track of these signs will be convenient for our algorithm for constructing a link diagram on a surface given a link diagram we can generate a pd code but which collections of quadruples come from link diagrams we will now define a particular class of codes and in the next section show that a link diagram on an orientable surface can be recovered from such codes definition 3 let pd be the set of collections of quadruples of the labels 1 1 1 n 1 1 n satisfying the following properties 1 each edge label appears exactly twice once positively i e the sign on the second coordinate is positive and once negatively i e the sign on the second coordinate is negative 2 each quadruple contains two positive edges and two negative edges and begins with a positive label 4 matt mastin 3 the second coordinate of non adjacent edge labels in each quadruple are consecutive modulo the number of arcs in those edges component in addition the first coordinate of non adjacent edge labels in each quadruple are the same 4 the first and third edge labels have opposite signs and the lesser edge label in the ordering of the labels is always positive the second and fourth edge labels have opposite signs and the lesser edge label in the ordering of the labels is always positive 3 graphs and surfaces in order to reconstruct a link from a pd code we will first recover the underlying 4 regular graph this graph can be thought of as the shadow of a link diagram since it is the edges of the link diagram which are labeled it will be convenient to describe graphs by giving the edge set explicitly and describing the vertex set by edge adjacencies thus we will use the following alternate definition of a graph definition 4 a graph is an ordered pair e v where e is a set of edges labeled by the pairs 1 1 1 n 1 1 n and v is a multi set a set with duplicates allowed this is to allow loops at a single vertex of unordered lists of labels such that each edge label appears exactly twice throughout the collection of lists the unordered lists will be referred to as vertices and we say that an edge is incident to a vertex if it appears in the corresponding list we say that two graphs e v and e v are isomorphic if there is a bijection e e such that e 1 ek v if and only if e 1 ek v because we wish to recover a link diagram which has oriented edges we will also consider graphs with oriented edges when doing so we will keep track of the orientations at the edge ends by labeling the incoming end with a positive label and the outgoing edge end with a negative label this choice of sign convention is arbitrary but should conform to the choice of signs of the labels in the pd codes example 5 consider the graph with edge set e 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 and vertex set v 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 since only one label appears in the first coordinate of the edge labels we will as mentioned in the previous section drop the first coordinate and write the edge set as 1 2 3 4 5 6 graphs of this type will correspond to knots 1 note that the graph with edge set e 1 2 3 4 5 6 and vertex set v 2 4 1 5 5 6 3 2 1 4 6 3 is the same graph as e v we can now orient the edges of this graph by adding signs to the edge labels in the vertex set for example the oriented graph with edge set e 1 2 3 4 5 6 and vertex set v 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 gives the graph underlying the knot diagram in figure 2 it is also important to note that these are abstract graphs as opposed to particular embeddings a diagram of an embedding of the graph from example 5 will be shown below in order to specify a particular embed ding of graph we must include information about the order in which the edges in terms of the orientation of s appear at each vertex definition 6 given a connected 4 regular graph we define a cyclic ordering at the vertices to be an order ing of the four edge ends incident at vertex vi we will denote the ordering at vertex vi by e 0 i e 1 i e 2 i e 3 i note that a single edge may be incident to the same vertex twice and thus the ordering labels need not correspond to distinct edges the reader may suspect that an arbitrary ordering of the edges may not produce a link diagram and the reader would be correct but as we will show later graphs that are produced from pd codes have an ordering links and planar diagram codes 5 on the edges that does produce a link diagram since each edge appears exactly twice once positively and once negatively in the cyclic orderings we can make the following definition definition 7 we define the successor map by s eji e j 1 mod 4 i the successor map gives the next edge to appear if we were to walk along an edge and turn right at each vertex there is no particular reason for taking the convention of turning right and the theory would work just as well with the opposite choice as another matter of convention walking along a positive edge means we are going with the edge orientation and walking along a negative edge means we are going against the edge orientation with this idea in mind we will generate a surface of identification using the successor map definition 8 for each orbit of the successor map s we construct an oriented polygon in the plane with sides given by the labels in each orbit where the labels are assigned clockwise around the polygon the orientation of an edge agrees with the orientation inherited from the standard orientation of the plane for negative labels and disagrees with this orientation for positive labels cf example 9 the orientations of the 2 cells is inherited from the standard orientation on the plane the orientations of the edges is induced by the orientation of the 2 cells this construction gives the associated cell complex to a given 4 regular graph with a cyclic ordering at the vertices example 9 consider the graph with edge set 1 2 3 4 5 6 and vertex set 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 from example 5 we can order the edges at each vertex and assign signs to distinguish incoming and outgoing edges as shown below 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 note that this is precisely the pd code of the example in figure 2 the values of successor map are shown in table 1 computing the orbits of this map on the set of edge labels gives that the set of faces is as follows 1 4 1 3 5 2 5 2 6 4 6 3 from definition 8 we have two triangles and three bigons as shown in figure 4 s 4 2 s 2 6 s 6 4 s 2 5 s 6 3 s 4 1 s 5 1 s 3 5 s 1 3 s 1 4 s 5 2 s 3 6 table 1 the successor map from example 9 proposition 10 the cell complex associated to a connected 4 regular graph with a cyclic ordering at the vertices is homeomorphic to a closed connected orientable surface proof let x be the cell complex corresponding to these identifications to see that x is homeomorphic to a closed surface we will first show that the gluing given in definition 8 produces a piecewise linear surface there is nothing to check at interior points of the faces let x be a point on edge e and let i be an open interval in e there are exactly 2 faces say f 1 and f 2 incident to edge e because the orbits partition the edges and each edge appears exactly twice each of these faces is a polygon in the plane so we may take uf 1 and uf 2 to be open balls in f 1 and f 2 which intersect the boundaries at exactly i in x we may now 6 matt mastin 2 6 4 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 2 4 3 1 5 31 5 35 4 2 6 1 3535 5 3 1 3 5 figure 4 the faces and resulting polyhedron from example 9 the shaded disks are contracted and interior edges removed in the last step to show that this is an identification for a 2 sphere construct the set uf 1 i uf 2 which is homeomorphic to an open disk in the plane it is left to check that there is a neighborhood of each vertex which is homeomorphic to a ball in the plane by construction each vertex is locally incident to exactly 4 faces in addition near each vertex there are four distinct edges where adjacent edges in the quadruple bound a distinct triangle in the corresponding face see figure 5 therefore two edges either correspond to a unique triangle or they are not the boundary of any triangle thus each vertex has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to a piecewise linear disk so x is homeomorphic to a closed piecewise linear surface since we have a finite cell complex we can appeal to the classification of surfaces and assume that we can smooth our surface we will call this smooth surface the surface associated to the diagram the original graph is embedded on the associated surface as a 1 skeleton thus since the graph is connected the surface must also be connected to see that the surface is orientable we refer to the identification of polygons in the plane and compute the second integral cellular homology group if we glue pairs of edges until we are left with a single polygon then we can remove edges and vertices until there is only a single 2 cell remaining since we removed pairs of edges the remaining edges must still appear in pairs once positively and once negatively there is only a single 2 cell so the group of 2 chains is generated by a single element the boundary of this two cell is the sum of the edges which is zero as the remaining edges pair off positively and negatively this process is illustrated in figure 4 so the second integral cellular homology group is isomorphic to z and the surface is therefore orientable if one starts with a disconnected graph then the resulting surface is the disjoint union of the connected surfaces resulting from each connected component of the graph links and planar diagram codes 7 1 6 6 2 2 5 5 1 figure 5 four faces coming together at a vertex to form a disk proposition 11 given a pd code we can produce a well defined link diagram on an orientable surface s proof given a pd code c we first produce a graph with a cyclic ordering at the vertices let the vertex set be the set of quadruples and the edge set be the set 1 1 1 n 1 1 n of labels in c neglecting signs an edge is incident to a vertex if its label appears in the vertices quadruple we get an ordering at the vertices by the order of the labels in each quadruple thus by proposition 10 we can produce an orientable not necessarily connected surface s with a cell decomposition corresponding to c we will now use the remaining data in c to define a link diagram on s using the 1 skeleton of the cell decomposition beginning with edge 1 1 we traverse the 1 skeleton by choosing the non adjacent edge according to the ordering at each vertex property 4 of definition 3 implies that the resulting cycle can be given an orientation by orienting each edge from the negative label to the positive thus we have an oriented immersion from s 1 into s we repeat this process until every edge is contained in a cycle thus producing an oriented immersion d tns 1 s where the tns 1 are ordered we color a vertex with 1 if the corresponding quadruple in the pd code is of the form and we color a vertex with 1 if the corresponding quadruple in the pd code is of the form it is important to note that the map of proposition 11 and the algorithm for computing a pd code from a diagram are not inverses for example if one placed the standard diagram for the trefoil inside an embedded disk on the torus one would obtain the same pd code as the standard diagram for the trefoil on a sphere in this case the map of proposition 11 will produce the diagram of the trefoil on the sphere cf example 15 definition 12 the surface associated to a pd code c is the closed orientable surface associated to the 4 regular graph with an ordering at the vertices underlying c cf proposition 11 we say the pd code is connected if the associated surface is connected proposition 11 and proposition 10 imply that the surface associated to a pd code is well defined definition 13 let the euler characteristic of a pd code be the euler characteristic of the corresponding polyhedron we define the genus of a pd code to be g i gi where the sum is over the connected components of the associated surface theorem 14 the euler characteristic of an n crossing pd code c is given by n s n where n s is the number of orbits of s on the set of edge labels 8 matt mastin proof the polyhedron corresponding to c has n vertices 2 n edges and n s faces computing the euler characteristic we see that n 2 n n s n s n example 15 consider again the pd code 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 from figure 2 we saw in example 9 that the orbits of the successor map are as follows 1 4 1 3 5 2 5 2 6 4 6 3 note that there are three vertices and five 2 cells so by theorem 14 we have 5 3 2 thus the surface associated with this pd code is a single 2 sphere it is important to note that we have implicitly used the fact that the surface is connected and orientable to conclude that having an euler characteristic of 2 implies that the surface is a 2 sphere as previously mentioned if we start with a link diagram generate its pd code and then produce a link diagram from the pd code we will not necessarily end up with the diagram that we started with for example two link diagrams on a torus that differ by a dehn twist would have the same pd code however for the case of classical non split link diagrams i e non split diagrams on a 2 sphere these operations are in fact inverses we now make this precise definition 16 define pd to be the subset of the set of all pd codes pd cf definition 3 whose associated surfaces are single 2 spheres proposition 17 pd is in bijection with the set of non split link diagrams on 2 spheres cf definition 1 proof definition 2 gives a map from link diagrams to pd codes and proposition 11 gives a map from pd codes to link diagrams we must show that these maps are inverses when restricted to non split links diagrams on the 2 sphere and the set of pd codes pd cf definition 16 first consider the image c of a link diagram d under the map of definition 2 the link diagram d on the 2 sphere gives a natural cell decomposition the 0 cells are the self intersections the 1 cells are the arcs and the 2 cells are polygons which form the complement of the diagram it is clear that the map of proposition 11 recovers a cell decomposition with the same number of 0 cells and 1 cells and by the definition of the successor map the 2 cells are polygons in bijection with the decomposition given by the link diagram moreover the gluing map given in proposition 11 ensures that the 2 cell adjacency relations in the link diagram as well as the associated surface agree therefore the 1 skeleton of d and the 1 skeleton of the diagram reconstructed from c are isomorphic graphs it is a corollary of the jordan schonflies theorem that two embeddings of a graph with the same cyclic order at the vertices on a surface are related by an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the surface cf mt 01 theorem 3 2 4 any orientation preserving homeomorphism of s 2 is isotopic to the identity thus the 1 skeletons of d and c are isotopic and hence equivalent as link diagrams now consider the image d of a pd code c under the map given in proposition 11 the arc labels of d are given by the labels of c as is the over under crossing information we again have that the adjacency relations of the 2 cells are preserved therefore if we read the pd code as in definition 2 fromd we recover c example 18 we now finish our running example with the pd code of example 15 and show that it in fact recovers the knot diagram from figure 2 in figure 6 we see the graph from example 15 along with the edge labels and vertex coloring as specified in proposition 11 to see that we have recovered the link diagram links and planar diagram codes 9 5 3 1 2 64 5 3 1 2 64 3 6 1 4 2 5 figure 6 here we see the graph from example 15 as it is embedded on s 2 if we redraw the crossings as shown in figure 1 we see that the diagram of figure 2 is recovered the second step shown is simply a rotation in the plane of the page 2 5 6 3 1 4 figure 7 a knot diagram on a torus which produces the pd code in example 19 the vertex colorings have been omitted for clarity of the figure but the sign of each crossing could be deduced from the pd code that we started with we can simply replace the vertices with the correct crossing configuration as shown in figure 1 and check that the resulting diagram agrees with figure 2 example 19 we end this section with an example of a pd code which represents a link diagram on a torus consider the pd code 5 2 6 3 3 1 4 6 1 4 2 5 obtained from the link diagram shown in figure 7 by choosing an incoming under crossing and sign at each vertex the orbits of the successor map are 1 4 6 3 2 6 3 5 1 4 5 2 at this point we can compute the euler characteristic of the surface using theorem 14 there are 3 orbits of the successor map and 3 crossings so we have 3 3 0 thus the surface is a torus the surface of identification is given in figure 8 the diagram in this example is that of a virtual knot with 3 classical crossings and 2 virtual crossings 4 reidemeister moves the goal of this section is to establish that pd modulo a certain set of combinatorial moves is equivalent to the set of link diagrams modulo the reidemeister moves and in turn to the isotopy classes of links by reidemeister s theorem polyak pol 10 established that the four oriented reidemeister moves shown in figure 9 are sufficient to generate oriented link equivalence on diagrams definition 20 given a pd code c the following moves are called the pd moves each of these moves corresponds to an oriented reidemeister moves shown in figure 9 10 matt mastin 4 2 1 6 5 3 5 2 6 1 3 4 1 4 2 3 4 16 3 5 2 2 3 1 4 3 5 2 1 4 6 figure 8 the surface of identification obtained by the pd code in example 19 we know this surface is orientable as removing edges 5 and 6 from the third frame leaves a single polygon whose boundary is 0 by computing 0 we conclude that the surface is indeed a torus as claimed i i i i i j i j i j k i k j 1 a 1 a 2 3 figure 9 a generating set of oriented reidemeister moves the analogous moves for pd codes are given in definition 20 1 a insert or remove a quadruple of the form i into p where and are new labels with i i 1 and i is any label of p b insert or remove a quadruple of the form i into p where and are new labels with i i 1 and i is any label of p 2 a let i and j be labels of p both bounding the same 2 cell in addition one of them agrees with the orientation of the 2 cell and the other does not insert the two quadruples j i and into p where and are new labels with i i 1 and j j 1 undoing this move amounts to removing a pair of quadruples of links and planar diagram codes 11 the form j i and make the following identification of the labels i and j 3 if i j k is an orbit of the successor map then a triple of quadruples of the form j 1 i j i 1 j k j 1 k 1 k i k 1 i 1 may be replaced by the triple of quadruples j 1 k 1 j k k 1 i 1 k i j i 1 j 1 i or vice versa it is a straight forward exercise to verify that the moves described in definition 20 correspond with the reidemeister moves in figure 9 this the following lemma is immediate and formalizes the relationship between the pd moves and the reidemeister moves lemma 21 if c and c are pd codes that are related by the single pd move p then l c and l c are related by the reidemeister move l p similarly if two link diagrams are related by the single reidemeister move r then their pd codes are related by pd r we will overload the maps l pd d and pd d pd so that if p is a pd move then l p is the corresponding reidemeister move similarly if r is a reidemeister move then pd r is the corresponding pd move the equivalence relation generated by the pd moves will be called p and the equivalence relation generated by the reidemeister moves will be called r the following proposition gives a convenient way to describe the relationship between link diagrams modulo the reidemeister moves and pd codes module the pd moves proposition 22 the following diagram commutes pd d pd p l r l pd pd l p r where the map l is defined by choosing a representative c from an equivalence class and setting l c r l c the map pd is similarly defined by pd d p pd d proof the proof will essentially amount to using repeated applications of lemma 21 to verify that l is well defined we first let c and c be to representatives of the same equivalence class in pd p as such there is a sequence of pd moves p 1 pn from c to c inducting on lemma 21 gives that l p 1 l pn is a sequence of reidemeister moves from l c to l c thus l c and l c are in the same equivalence class of d r the argument is essentially identical to show that pd is well defined the diagram commutes by construction since the bijection between pd and d is used to to define the maps l and pd the main content of this proposition is that the set pd codes under the pd moves is equivalent to link diagrams under the reidemeister moves as claimed 12 matt mastin 5 intrinsic symmetry of spherical pd codes for this section we will consider only genus 0 pd codes though the action described here after is well defined for higher genus pd codes we can only produce a well defined link in s 3 for genus 0 pd codes without extra information about the embedding of the surface and hence there is no natural correspondence between the action on the pd codes and an action on an underlying link the intrinsic symmetry group of a link was first defined by whitten whi 69 and discussed in detail by cantarella et al bcc 12 these symmetries are the generalization of invertiblility and chirality and are described by the group given in the following definition definition 23 consider the homomorphism given by s 7 aut z 1 2 p 7 p where p is defined as p 0 1 2 0 p 1 p 2 p for 0 1 p and 0 1 q z 1 2 o s we define the whitten group as the semidirect product z 1 2 o s with the group operation 0 1 2 p 0 1 2 q 0 1 2 p 0 1 2 qp 0 0 1 p 1 2 p 2 p qp we may also use the notation l to refer to the whitten group the action of this group on link diagrams is also described by cantarella et al bcc 12 our present goal is to describe the corresponding action on pd codes the main result of this section is that one can choose a preferred pd code for each link type so that no non trivial pd code is fixed by a non identity element of the whitten group i e the action is free definition 24 consider an element 0 1 p we define an action of on the labels of a pd code by the following operations which must be applied in order 1 first we apply p to the first component of each label 2 if 0 1 we do nothing if 0 1 we shift each positive crossing to the right by 1 and each negative crossing to the left by 1 3 if i 1 we do nothing if i 1 we first apply the permutation 1 2 n 1 3 n 1 1 n 2 2 1 n 2 2 1 n 1 2 2 to the second component of the labels whose first component label is i ignoring signs then shift each quadruple to the right or left by 2 if the ith component is the under crossing and finally switch the sign on the second component of every label with first component i it is clear that the action of these elements produces a set of quadruples but we will now show that in fact there is a well defined action on pd codes proposition 25 the previous definition gives a well defined action of on pd codes links and planar diagram codes 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 2 5 1 2 6 3 5 6 4 1 3 1 6 5 4 3 2 6 3 1 4 2 5 3 6 4 1 5 2 1 1 figure 10 the action of 1 1 on a diagram of the trefoil note that the affect on the pd codes is as described in definition 24 proof we must first show that the resulting collection of labels satisfies properties 1 4 of definition 3 and thus produces a valid pd code property 1 persists as the only change to the sign of a label changes the sign of all labels thus there are still exactly one positive label and one negative label for each edge property 2 persists as positive crossings have a positive second label in the first and last slots and after shifting to the right we again begin with a positive crossing similarly negative crossing have positive labels in the first two positions and so shifting to the left also gives a quadruple beginning with a positive label property 3 also checks out again because of the global sign change to see that property 4 is preserved we first note that since the sign change affects all labels we will still have that non adjacent labels have opposite sign however the sign change does affect the lesser edge is positive condition luckily the permutation 1 2 n 1 3 n 1 1 n 1 22 straightens this out we now turn the task of showing that we have a group action applying the permutations to the first coordinate of each label is the natural action of the symmetric group on the integers 1 the infor mation contained in a quadruple of a pd code represents an under crossing and an over crossing along with orientation information for both this structure admits a z 2 z 2 action by switching the overcrossing for the undercrossing and reversing the orientations in the case that both the undercrossing and the over crossing appear in the same component we have the diagonal action where the second two group elements of z 2 z 2 z 2 are the same the effect of this action on the labels in the pd code is described by 2 and 3 of definition 24 as seen in figure 10 we now address the issue of the existence of pd codes which are fixed under the action of an element of while these do exist we will show that we can produce a pd code for each link that is not fixed by a non trivial element of in particular if a pd code is fixed by some non trivial element in then we 14 matt mastin 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 figure 11 an example of a pd code that is fixed by 1 1 1 12 can add a reidemeister 1 loop to it so that it still represents the same knot type but is not fixed by any non identity element of in this way we can produce a collection of pd codes on which the action of is free example 26 consider the diagram and pd code of the hopf link shown in figure 11 the pd code associated to this diagram is 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 if we act on this pd code by 1 1 12 2 the result is the pd code 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 thus the pd code is fixed by the action of lemma 27 in every equivalence class of pd codes modulo the pd moves there is a representative which is fixed only by the identity element in proof we first observe that a reidemeister 1 loop occurs in a diagram if and only if the corresponding pd code contains a quadruple with two pairs with the same integer appearing as second components with opposite signs suppose we have a pd code for a knot with exactly one reidemeister 1 loop then there is a quadruple of the form i i j k i k j j i j j k or i j k i but none of these are fixed by a shift by 1 thus no pd code containing a reidemeister 1 loop can be fixed by the action of 1 1 similarly since there is no other quadruple contained both positive and negative i or j this pd code cannot be fixed by 1 1 thus if we have a pd code for a knot that is fixed by some element of we may modify it by first removing all reidemeister 1 loops and then adding a single reidemeister 1 loop given a table of pd codes for knots we simply traverse the list and fix each code to produce preferred list links and planar diagram codes 15 n n n 1 n 2 figure 12 adding a reidemeister 1 loop to arc n to generalize to links we simple remove all reidemeister 1 loops and then add n loops back to component n for each component 1 corollary 28 there is a preferred table of link diagrams on which the action of is free the preferred list of diagrams from the previous corollary will play a central role in the enhanced prime decomposition theorem for knots mas 13 6 future directions we have in many places restricted our attention to the pd codes whose associated surfaces are spheres because these correspond to classical knots relaxing this condition gives rise to the collection of pd codes whose associated surfaces are orientable but of arbitrary genus this set of pd codes includes the virtual links kau 11 and certainly warrant future study another obvious generalization is embed our surfaces in 3 manifolds other than s 3 and develop a combinatorial theory for links in arbitrary 3 manifolds sometimes intrinsic symmetries arise as combinatorial automorphisms of the associated cell complex such symmetries could be called diagrammatic symmetries and are convenient for finding intrinsic sym metries of links these methods were used by cantarella et al bcc 12 but formal attention should be given to this class of symmetries references
