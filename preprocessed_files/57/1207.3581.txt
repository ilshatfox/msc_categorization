simple closed nonseparating curve in f let tc denote a left handed dehn twist about c a fractional power of tc of exponent n is an h mod sg such that h n t c unlike a root of a tc a fractional power h can exchange the sides of c we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both side exchanging and side preserving fractional powers we show in the side preserving case that if gcd n 1 then h will be isotopic to the th power of an nth root of tc and that n 2 g 1 in general we show that n 4 g and that side preserving fractional powers of exponents 2 g 2 g 2 and 2 g 4 g always exist for a side exchanging fractional power of exponent 2 n we show that 2 n 2 g 2 and that side exchanging fractional powers of exponent 2 g 2 4 g 2 and 4 g 1 4 g 2 always exist we give a complete listing of certain side preserving and side exchanging fractional powers on s 5 1 introduction let sg be a closed orientable surface of genus g 2 and c be a simple closed nonseparating curve in sg let tc denote a left handed dehn twist about c and let mod sg denote the mapping class group of sg a root of tc of degree n is an h mod sg such that h n tc in 2008 d margalit and s schleimer 2 showed the existence of degree 2 g 1 roots of a dehn twist tc on sg 1 for g 1 in an earlier collaborative work with d mccullough 3 we derived necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a root of degree n the geometric construction of a root of degree n of tc on sg started with the definition of cn action on sg with fixed points p and q so that the rotation angles induced by the action around these points differ by 2 n we then remove invariant disks around p and q and attach an annulus n extending the restricted homeomorphism over n using a homeomorphism whose nth power is a full twist of n using thurston s orbifold theory 7 see also 6 and some elementary number theory an equivalent algebraic theory of roots was developed that completely captured this geometric construction a natural question is whether this theory can be extended to nth roots of th powers of tc and whether such date november 10 2018 key words and phrases surface mapping class dehn twist nonseparating curve root fractional power 1 http arxiv org abs 1207 3581 v 1 2 kashyap rajeevsarathy roots could possess some additional properties we will call such a root h a fractional power of tc of exponent n definition 1 1 a fractional power of tc of exponent n is an h mod sg such that hn t c in particular a root of tc of degree n is just a fractional power of ex ponent 1 n in this paper we will describe the geometric construction of a fractional power of tc of exponent n while this construction is fairly straightforward the main mathematics of the paper is in the extension of the algebraic theory of roots to the case of fractional powers so that it describes their geometric construction this algebra along with a simple calculus en ables us to obtain several qualitative and quantitative results on fractional powers including their enumeration the use of the notation n instead of n is for the reason that fractional powers of exponent n where n can exist while powers of exponent 1 n do not for example there always exists a fractional power of tc of exponent 2 g 4 g in mod sg 1 see remark 2 10 but we know from 3 that a square root of tc cannot exist let h be a fractional power of tc of exponent n as in the case of a root of tc h would also preserve c which is apparent from the following argument since t c ht ch 1 t h c h c is isotopic to c and by isotopy we may assume that h c c we showed in 3 that no root of tc can exchange the two sides of c however an intriguing fact about fractional powers of tc is that they can exchange the sides of c which motivates the following definition definition 1 2 a fractional power is side exchanging if it interchanges the two sides of c and side preserving otherwise since h is a root of degree n of t c t r ch is a root of degree n of t rn c we may assume that 6 n for if hn tnc then h fixes c up to isotopy and commutes with tc so ht 1 c n 1 and h ktc for some finite order homeomorphism k with k c c in other words h is a trivial modification of a 0 n root that preserves c consequently we need only to understand the fractional powers of tc having 1 n and we will generally assume that lies in this range the main result in both the side preserving and side exchanging cases will be proved using thurston s orbifold theory we know from 3 that any root of tc is side preserving so the theory of roots derived in 3 naturally extends to the case of side preserving fractional powers as in the geometric construction of roots we define a cn action on sg that has two distinguished fixed points p and q however the only difference is that the rotation angles at p and q have to differ by 2 n and the twisting on annulus n is through an angle 2 n rather than 2 n the quotient orbifold of the cn action has two distinguished cone points of order n in section 2 we define an abstract tuple called an sp data set which is an extension of the data set in 3 an sp data set in addition to holding the essential fractional powers of dehn twists about nonseparating curves 3 algebraic information required to describe the quotient orbifold action also holds information required that determines the geometric construction a root the main theorem in section 2 theorem 2 3 asserts that conjugacy classes of side preserving fractional powers correspond to sp data sets an interesting consequence of this theorem is the following proposition proposition 2 4 let h be a side preserving fractional power of tc of ex ponent n such that gcd n 1 then h h for some root h of tc of degree n in other words if gcd n 1 then a fractional power is essentially the th power of a root degree n among other direct applications of theorem 2 3 is the following corollary corollary 2 6 suppose that h is a side preserving fractional power of tc of exponent n then a n is odd if is odd b n 2 g 1 if gcd n 1 corollary 2 6 gives an upper bound for n when and n are relatively prime in the following corollary we also derive a general upper and lower bound for n corollary 2 8 suppose that h is a side preserving fractional power of tc of exponent n whose conjugacy class is given by the sp data set d n g 0 a b c 1 n 1 cm nm then 2 g m 2 g 0 m n 4 g 4 g 0 m finally we give a complete classification in mod s 5 up to conjugacy of side preserving fractional powers that arise from cyclic actions whose quo tient orbifold is topologically a sphere with three cone points we shall define such fractional powers as essential fractional powers a side exchanging fractional power h of tc will have an exponent of the form 2 n as it is obtained from a c 2 n action on sg that has two dis tinguished fixed points p and q interchanged by a generator h of c 2 n since the actions at p and q are conjugate by h p and q will have the same local turning angle and will descend to a single cone point of order n in the quotient orbifold as in the side preserving case we define an se data set to encode the algebraic information relating to the geometric construction of a side exchanging fractional power the main theorem in section 3 theorem 3 3 establishes that se data sets correspond to conju gacy classes of side exchanging fractional powers since we know from 3 that side exchanging or even degree roots do not exist side exchanging fractional powers cannot be powers of roots but it is a natural question to ask whether there exist side exchanging fractional powers that are pow ers of other side exchanging fractional powers it is immediately apparent that a side exchanging fractional power of exponent 2 n where is prime 4 kashyap rajeevsarathy can never be such a fractional power but when is composite such a fractional can exist if it satisfies the condition given in the following propo sition this proposition can be viewed as an analog of proposition 2 4 for the side exchanging case proposition 3 4 let h be a side exchanging fractional power of tc of ex ponent 2 n such that is composite integer with gcd n 1 let r be a divisor of then h h r for some side exchanging fractional power h of tc of exponent 2 n from a result of wiman 8 and later harvey 1 we know that 2 n 4 g 2 and in remark 3 6 we provide an se data set that represents the con jugacy class of a side exchanging fractional power of exponent 4 g 1 4 g 2 in mod sg 1 for all g 1 the existence of fractional powers of exponent 4 g 1 4 g 2 makes upper bounds for 2 n rather superfluous however in the following corollary we derive a lower bound for 2 n corollary 1 7 suppose that h is a se fractional power of tc of exponent 2 n whose conjugacy class is given by the se data set d 2 n g 0 a k 1 n 1 km nm then a n is odd if is odd and b 2 n 2 g m 2 g 0 m 1 we also show that a side exchanging fractional power of exponent 2 2 g 2 always exists as in the side preserving case here too we give a complete classification of essential fractional powers in mod s 5 though one would intuitively expect the occurrence of side exchanging fractional powers to be more restrictive the data obtained using gap soft ware 5 4 seems to suggest that in general side exchanging fractional powers achieve more exponents than side preserving powers however side exchanging fractional powers in general are much fewer in number when compared with side exchanging fractional powers table 1 in section 4 lists the occurrences of essential fractional powers of tc in mod sg 1 and their exponents for genera g in the range 20 g 1 30 2 side preserving fractional powers in this section we will derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a side preserving fractional power of exponent n and some additional applications in fact the main result of 3 can be extended to describe the side preserving fractional powers of tc adapting the main definition from that paper we define an sp data set of exponent n definition 2 1 an sp data set of exponent n is a tuple of the form n g 0 a b k 1 n 1 km nm where i n g 0 and the ni are integers such that n 1 g 0 0 each ni 1 and each ni divides n fractional powers of dehn twists about nonseparating curves 5 ii a and b are residues modulo n with gcd a n gcd b n 1 and each ki is a residue modulo ni with gcd ki ni 1 iii a b ab mod n and iv a b m i 1 n ni ki 0 mod n the integer g defined by 2 1 g g 0 n 1 2 m i 1 n ni ni 1 is called the genus of the data set two sp data sets are considered to be the same if they differ by in terchanging a and b or by reordering of the pairs k 1 n 1 km nm if m 0 in definition 2 1 then condition iv would give b a mod n which when substituted in iii would imply that 0 mod n so we may assume that m 1 remark 2 2 when g 0 0 and m 1 equation 2 1 takes the form 2 g n 1 1 n 1 since n 1 n we have that 2 g n 1 1 n n 1 that is n 2 g 1 the proof of theorem 1 1 in 3 adapts easily as we will explain to give the following theorem 2 3 for a given n 1 1 n and g 1 sp data sets of genus g and exponent n correspond to the conjugacy classes in mod sg 1 of the side preserving fractional powers of tc of exponent n consequently tc has a side preserving fractional power of exponent n if and only if there exists an sp data set of genus g and exponent n proof the first part of the proof of theorem 1 1 of 3 analyzed the case when h is a side preserving fractional power of tc obtaining a cn action on a closed surface sg with two fixed points p and q and possibly other with nontrivial stabilizers the analysis here proceeds in exactly the same way to the point when the rotation angles at p and q are analyzed the condition that a b ab mod n was shown to be equivalent to the fact that the rotation angles at the two ends of the annulus n in sg 1 differ by 2 n so that on n h must be have left handed twisting of 2 n an analogous argument shows that the condition a b ab mod n is equivalent to h having left handed twisting through 2 n so that hn t c thus an sp data set of exponent n produces a fractional power of exponent n the next part of the proof of theorem 1 1 showed that side exchanging roots of 6 kashyap rajeevsarathy tc do not exist which is irrelevant to us since we are assuming that h is side preserving finally the converse is a matter of reversing the argument the arguments for proving that a h conjugate to h would also yield the same sp data set and the converse are analogous to the arguments in the proof of theorem 1 1 theorem 2 3 allows us to perceive the conjugacy classes of side preserving fractional powers of tc on sg 1 simply as sp data sets so for a given g 1 we can explicitly compute the various possible exponents of side preserving fractional powers of in mod sg 1 using the algebraic conditions on sp data sets in the following proposition we will show that a fractional power of of tc of exponent n is the th of a nth root when and n are relatively prime proposition 2 4 suppose that h is a side preserving fractional power of tc of exponent n with gcd n 1 then h h for some root h of tc of degree n proof describe the conjugacy class of h by an sp data set d n g 0 a b k 1 n 1 km nm with a b ab mod n con sider the tuple d obtained by replacing with 1 and multiplying the values a b and k 1 km by since gcd n 1 d satisfies condition ii of an sp data set moreover the fact that a b a b mod n would imply that d also satisfies condition iii of an sp data set in other words d represents a side preserving fractional power h of degree 1 n that is h is a root of tc of degree n recall the proof of theorem 1 1 of 3 the numerical data corresponding to h described an orbifold o sg cn and an orbifold covering sg o cor responding to the kernel of a homomorphism orb 1 o cn the restriction h 0 of h to a subsurface of sg was extended to an annulus n giving h on sg 1 the h above is obtained from the same orbifold o as h is but using a restriction of h 0 of a different covering transformation of sg both have order n so h 0 equals some power of h 0 on n h n t c h n so that power is the th power this can also be checked directly by examining the rotation angles of h and h about the points p and q in f we now give an example to illustrate proposition 2 4 example 2 5 the sp data set d 2 9 0 1 1 7 9 which repre sents the conjugacy class of a side preserving fractional power of tc of expo nent 2 9 in mod s 5 is the 2 nd power of a 9 th root of tc whose conjugacy class is given by the data set d 1 9 0 2 2 5 9 this is evident by multiplying a 1 b 1 and c 7 of d by 2 modulo 9 and then replacing 2 with 1 to obtain d an immediate application of theorem 2 3 is the following corollary where we derive and upper bound for n when gcd n 1 fractional powers of dehn twists about nonseparating curves 7 corollary 2 6 suppose that h is a side preserving fractional power of tc of degree n then a n is odd if is odd b n 2 g 1 if gcd n 1 proof for a data set describing h we have a b ab mod n if n is even then must be even since a and b are relatively prime to n this proves part a for b suppose for contradiction that n 2 g 1 from equation 2 1 we have that 1 2 g 1 n 1 n 2 g 0 m i 1 1 1 ni this would imply that g 0 0 and m 1 and consequently n 1 n putting d n n 1 condition iv of definition 2 1 gives a b 0 mod d since gcd n 1 and d divides n this contradicts condition iii of definition 2 1 remark 2 7 interestingly the largest possible for which there exits a side preserving fractional power of exponent 2 g 1 is 2 g in fact the sp data sets d 1 2 g 2 g 1 0 1 g g 2 g 1 and d 2 2 g 2 g 1 0 2 g 1 2 g 1 4 2 g 1 represent conjugacy classes of side preserving fractional powers of tc of exponent 2 g 2 g 1 in mod sg 1 in the following corollary we will derive an upper bound and a lower bound for n corollary 2 8 suppose that h is a side preserving fractional power of tc of exponent n whose conjugacy class is given by the sp data set d n g 0 a b c 1 n 1 cm nm then 2 g m 2 g 0 m n 4 g 4 g 0 m proof to show that n 2 g m 2 g 0 m we use equation 2 1 from the definition of an sp data set on rewriting the equation we get 2 2 2 g n 2 g 0 m i 1 1 1 ni since each xi n we have that 2 g n 2 g 0 m m n from which we obtain the required inequality for the latter inequality we use the fact that ni 2 in equation 2 2 above to obtain 2 g n 2 g 0 m 2 which upon simplification gives the inequality the following corollary follows almost immediately from corollary 2 8 8 kashyap rajeevsarathy corollary 2 9 suppose that h is a side preserving fractional power of tc of exponent n given by the sp data set d n g 0 a b c 1 n 1 cm nm then a n 4 g b n g whenever g 0 1 and c m 1 whenever n 2 g remark 2 10 the upper bound for n in corollary 2 9 is realizable since there always exist side preserving fractional powers of exponent 4 g for example the data setsd 1 2 g 4 g 0 1 2 g 1 1 2 andd 2 2 g 4 g 0 2 g 1 4 g 1 1 2 represent conjugacy classes of side preserving fractional powers of tc of exponent 2 g 4 g in mod sg 1 geometrically data sets with g 0 0 and m 1 represent conjugacy classes of essential fractional powers from remark 2 2 we know that n 2 g 1 whenever g 0 0 and m 1 we now list all such sp data sets that represent conjugacy classes of side preserving fractional powers of exponent n in mod s 5 exponent 1 9 i d

classification it may be noted that the side preserving frac tional powers of exponent 9 for 2 4 5 7 and 8 are all powers of the fractional powers of exponent 1 9 that is the ninth roots of tc on s 5 moreover the highest value that takes is 2 g 8 these computations were made using the help of software 5 written in the gap programming language 3 side exchanging fractional powers in this section we shall derive equivalent conditions for the existence of side exchanging fractional powers of tc on sg 1 the geometric construc tion of side exchanging fractional powers differs from that of side preserving powers as they are obtained from c 2 n action on sg with two distinguished fixed points that correspond to a unique cone point of order n in the quotient orbifold therefore we need to analyze a slightly different kind of orbifold in this case which motivates the following the following definition of an se data set definition 3 1 a se data set of exponent 2 n is a tuple 2 n g 0 a k 1 n 1 km nm where i n g 0 and the ni are integers such that 2 n 2 g 0 0 each ni 1 and each ni divides 2 n ii a is a residue modulo n with gcd a n 1 and each ki is a residue modulo ni with gcd ki ni 1 iii a 2 mod n and iv 2 a m i 1 2 n ni ki 0 mod 2 n 10 kashyap rajeevsarathy the integer g defined by g n 2 g 0 1 m i 1 n ni ni 1 is called the genus of the data set two se data sets are considered to be same if they differ by the reordering of the pairs k 1 n 1 km nm remark 3 2 as in case of sp data sets it is apparent here too that if m 0 then 0 mod n if m 1 and g 0 0 then from equation 3 1 we have 1 g n 1 n 1 x 1 which would imply that g n 1 x 1 which is impossible we will now establish the main theorem in this section in which we will show that se data sets correspond to conjugacy classes of side exchanging fractional powers theorem 3 3 for a given n 1 1 n and g 0 the se data sets of genus g and exponent 2 n correspond to the conjugacy classes in mod sg 1 of the side exchanging fractional powers of tc of exponent 2 n consequently tc has a side exchanging fractional power of exponent 2 n if and only if there exists a data set of genus g and exponent 2 n proof suppose that h is a side exchanging fractional power of exponent 2 n as in the first part of the proof of theorem 1 1 we use h to obtain a c 2 n action on the closed surface sg since h exchanges the sides of c h 2 preserves the sides of c and hence the centers of the coned disks p and q since the actions at p and q are conjugate by a homeomorphism h that generates c 2 n rotation angles at p and q must be equal to 2 k n for some integer k as indicated in figure 1 let o be the quotient orbifold for the c 2 n action on sg denote the genus of o by g 0 and select standard generators ai bi 1 i g 0 of the fundamental group of the underlying surface o has one distinguished cone point p of order n which is the image of the distinguished fixed p and q under the quotient map and possibly m other cone points xi 1 i m from orbifold covering space theory the orbifold covering map sg o corresponds to an exact sequence 1 1 sg orb 1 o c 2 n 1 here c 2 n is the group of covering transformations generated by t and t 2 generates the stabilizer at p let be the generator of orb 1 o going around fractional powers of dehn twists about nonseparating curves 11 h 2 a h 2 b h h h b h a h 2 a b p q figure 1 the figure indicates the local effect of h and h 2 on disk neighborhoods of p and q the rotation angle of h 2 at p and q is 2 k n p and i be generators going around the xi selected so that orb 1 o 1 m a 1 b 1 ag 0 bg 0 n n 1 1 nm m 1 1 m g 0 j 1 aj bj is determined by the covering transformation corresponding to the loop which fixes p and has turning angle 2 k n at p for some k with gcd k n 1 so in c 2 n represents h 2 a h 2 a where ka 1 mod n the rotation angle around q is also 2 k n since h 2 n h 2 n tg 1 the left hand twisting angle of h 2 along the tubular neighborhood n of c is 2 n this requires 2 k n 2 k n 2 n giving 2 k mod n multiplying by a produces condition iii of a data set for 1 i m the preimage of xi consists of 2 n ni points cyclically permuted by t each of the points has stabilizer generated by t 2 n ni the rotation angle of t 2 n ni must be the same at all points of the orbit since its action at one point is conjugate by a power of t to its action at each other point so the rotation angle at each point is of the form 2 k i ni where gcd k i ni and as before lifting i shows that i t n ni ki where kik i 1 mod ni since c 2 n is abelian we have that g 0 j 1 aj bj 1 so 1 1 m t 2 a 2 n n 1 k 1 2 n nm km 12 kashyap rajeevsarathy giving condition iv of the data set the fact that the genus of the data set equals g follows from the multiplica tivity of the orbifold euler characteristic for the orbifold covering sg o 3 1 2 2 g 2 n 2 2 g 0 1 n 1 m i 1 1 ni 1 thus h leads to a se data set of exponent 2 n finally as in proof of theorem 1 1 of 3 the converse is a matter of reversing the argument the arguments for establishing that an se dataset would determine h up to conjugacy and the converse are similar to the ones in the proof of theo rem 1 1 however the part of that proof which pertains to showing that p q is preserved by some conjugating homeomorphism is redundant in this case theorem 3 3 allows to regard conjugacy class of a side exchanging frac tional power of exponent 2 n on sg 1 simply as an se data set in the following proposition we derive a condition under which a side exchanging fractional power can be the power of another side exchanging fractional power proposition 3 4 let h be a side exchanging fractional power of tc of ex ponent 2 n such that is composite integer with gcd n 1 let r be a divisor of then h h r for some side exchanging fractional power h of tc of exponent 2 n proof describe the conjugacy class of h by an se data setd 2 n g 0 a k 1 n 1 km nm with a 2 mod n consider the tuple d obtained by replacing with r and multiplying the values a and k 1 km by r since gcd n 1 d satisfies condition ii of an se data set also the fact that l r ar a 2 mod n would imply that d also satisfies condition iii of an se data set in other words d represents a side exchanging fractional power h of exponent 2 n where r as in the proof of theorem 3 3 numerical data corresponding to h de scribed an orbifold o sg c 2 n and an orbifold covering sg o corre sponding to the kernel of a homomorphism orb 1 o c 2 n the restriction h 0 of h to a subsurface of sg was extended to an annulus n giving h on sg 1 the h above is obtained from the same orbifold o as h is but using a restriction of h 0 of a different covering transformation of sg both have order 2 n so h 0 equals some power of h 0 therefore on n we have that h 2 n t c h r the following is a concrete example that illustrates proposition 3 4 example 3 5 the se data set d 6 10 0 2 3 10 3 10 that rep resents the conjugacy class of a side exchanging fractional power h of tc of exponent 6 10 in mod s 5 is the 2 nd power of a side exchanging fractional power h of tc of exponent 3 10 whose conjugacy class is described by the fractional powers of dehn twists about nonseparating curves 13 data set d 3 10 0 4 1 10 1 10 it is quite apparent that d can be obtained from d by multiplying a 2 k 1 3 and k 1 3 of d by r 2 modulo 5 and then replacing 6 with r 3 remark 3 6 it is a well known result of w j harvey 1 and a wiman 8 that the largest order of a cyclic action on a closed orientable surface of genus g is 4 g 2 for this reason 2 n 4 g 2 and from our earlier assumption 4 g 1 so it is interesting to note that for g 1 there exists a se fractional power of tc of degree 4 g 1 4 g 2 in mod sg 1 and its conjugacy class is represented by the se data set d 4 g 1 4 g 2 0 2 g 1 1 2 2 g 5 4 g 2 in the following corollary we shall derive a lower bound for 2 n corollary 3 7 suppose that h is a se fractional power of tc of exponent 2 n given by the se data set d 2

must be even since a is relatively prime to n to show b we use equation 3 1 from the proof of theorem 3 3 which upon simplification gives 3 2 g n 1 2 g 0 m 1 i 1 xi 1 since xi 2 n we have that 2 g 2 n

from corollary 3 7 that 2 n 2 g 2 it is worth mentioning here that for g 1 there always exist a side exchanging fractional power of tc exponent 2 2 g 2 in mod sg 1 and its conjugacy class is given by

exchanging and side preserving essential fractional powers of tc and their exponents in mod sg 1 we will use following notation notation 4 1 we will denote the number of distinct exponents of side exchanging and side preserving essential fractional powers of tc in mod sg 1 respectively by ese g and esp g also we will denote total number of side exchanging and side preserving essential fractional powers of tc up to conjugacy in mod sg 1 respectively by nse g and nsp g for 20 g 1 30 table 1 gives esp g ese g nsp g and nse g references 1 w j harvey cyclic groups of automorphisms of a
