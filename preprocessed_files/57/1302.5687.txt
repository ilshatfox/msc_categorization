a geometric transition from hyperbolic to anti de sitter geometry jeffrey danciger department of mathematics university of texas austin 1 university station c 1200 austin tx 78712 0257 jdanciger math utexas edu october 30 2018 abstract we introduce a geometric transition between two homogeneous three dimensional geometries hyperbolic geometry and anti de sitter ads geometry given a path of three dimensional hyperbolic structures that collapse down onto a hyperbolic plane we describe a method for constructing a natural continuation of this path into ads structures in particular when hyperbolic cone manifolds collapse the ads mani folds generated on the other side of the transition have tachyon singularities the method involves the study of a new transitional geometry called half pipe geometry we demonstrate these methods in the case when the manifold is the unit tangent bundle of the 2 m m triangle orbifold for m 5 1 introduction a geometric structure on a manifold is a system of local coordinates modeled on a homogeneous space x g k the structure is called hyperbolic if modeled on hy perbolic space hn po n 1 o n or ads if modeled on the anti de sitter space adsn po n 1 2 o n 1 1 which is a lorentzian analogue of hn we study families of geometric structures that degenerate or collapse our main source of exam ples coming from three dimensional hyperbolic cone manifolds the guiding philosophy based loosely on thurston s geometrization program is that when deforming structures collapse the degeneration is signaling that a transition to a different geometry is needed in order to continue the deformation the form of the collapse should tell us which type of geometry lies on the other side of the transition this article develops a new geometric transition going from hyperbolic structures to ads structures in the context of structures that collapse onto a co dimension one hyperbolic plane let n be a closed three manifold and let n be a knot assume that n itself is not hyperbolic but that n admits a complete hyperbolic structure then there exist j d is partially supported by the national science foundation grant number dms 1103939 1 ar x iv 1 30 2 56 87 v 1 m at h g t 2 2 f eb 2 01 3 hyperbolic cone structures on n with cone singularity along these are parametrized by the cone angle and in many cases all cone angles 2 may be achieved as 2 however these structures must degenerate and in general the collapse may take a variety of forms if for example the manifolds collapse uniformly to a point then a transition to spherical geometry passing through euclidean may be possible this well known tran sition studied by hodgson hod 86 porti por 98 and later in the proof of the orbifold theorem by cooper hodgson kerckhoff chk 00 and boileau leeb porti blp 05 can be described as follows the collapsing hyperbolic metrics are rescaled to give a limiting euclidean metric and that euclidean metric is then deformed to give nearby spherical cone metrics porti and collaborators have also studied degenerations in the context of non uniform collapse to a point por 02 and collapse to a line hps 01 consider a path of hyperbolic cone structures on n such that each chart in h 3 is collapsing onto a particular copy p of h 2 the transition functions between charts which lie in isom h 3 po 3 1 are converging into the o 2 1 subgroup that preserves p the collapsed charts define a transversely hyperbolic foliation f on n collapse of this type may happen for example when n is seifert fibered over a base s of hyperbolic type in this case one expects collapse onto a hyperbolic representative of the surface s so that f agrees with the seifert fibration the problem of regeneration or recovery of nearly collapsed hyperbolic structures from a transversely hyperbolic foliation was examined by hodgson hod 86 and later in a specific case by porti por 10 however it had not yet been established how to construct a geometric transition in this context our point of view based on real projective geometry is that such degeneration behavior suggests a natural transition to anti de sitter geometry as motivation note that both hyperbolic and ads are sub geometries of projective geometry and that when suitably embedded the structure groups isomh 3 po 3 1 and isom ads 3 po 2 2 intersect inside pgl 4 r in the o 2 1 subgroup that preserves a hyperbolic plane p we develop tools to construct examples of this hyperbolic ads transition in the setting above in which the hyperbolic structures have cone singularities the ads structures generated on the other side of the transition will have the analogous singularity in lorentzian geometry called a tachyon we demonstrate our methods in the case that n is the unit tangent bundle of the 2 m m triangle orbifold theorem 1 let m 5 and let s be the hyperbolic structure on the two sphere with three cone points of order 2 m m let n be the unit tangent bundle of s then there exists a knot in n and a continuous path of real projective structures pt on n singular along such that pt is conjugate to a hyperbolic cone structure of cone angle 2 when t 0 or an ads structure with tachyon singularity of mass 0 when t 0 as t 0 the cone angle 2 resp 0 and the hyperbolic geometry resp ads geometry of pt collapses to the surface s the key to the proof of theorem 1 given in section 5 is the construction of the transitional projective structure p 0 we build p 0 out of a new homogeneous geometry called half pipe hp geometry designed to bridge the gap between hyperbolic and ads half pipe geometry arises naturally as a limit of conjugates of hyperbolic geometry inside 2 of projective geometry in the context above in which hyperbolic structures collapse onto a hyperbolic plane p we rescale h 3 in order to prevent collapse specifically we apply a projective transformation that preserves p the plane of collapse but stretches transverse to p the limit of the conjugate copies of h 3 produced by this rescaling is the projective model for half pipe geometry hp 3 we note that information about the collapsed hyperbolic structure is contained in the hp geometry every hp structure has a natural projection to its associated transversely hyperbolic foliation f additionally the hp geometry preserves some first order information in the collapsing direction this information is critical for regeneration to both hyperbolic and ads structures we emphasize that the most important contribution of this paper is the general con struction of half pipe geometry given in section 3 as the transitional geometry connecting hyperbolic to ads although our main application is to structures with cone singularities this construction is very general and may be useful in other contexts we also note that half pipe geometry does not have an invariant metric riemannian nor lorentzian our projective geometry approach eliminates metrics from the analysis entirely 1 1 cone tachyon transitions recall that a cone singularity see section 2 4 or e g hk 05 bro 07 suo 03 in h 3 geometry is a singularity along a geodesic axis such that the holonomy of a meridian encircling the axis is a rotation around the axis similarly a tachyon see section 2 5 or bbs 09 in ads 3 geometry is a singularity along a space like axis such that the holonomy of a meridian encircling the axis is a lorentz boost orthogonal to the axis the magnitude of the boost is called the tachyon mass when rescaled a hyperbolic cone singularity of cone angle approaching 2 and an ads tachyon singularity of mass approaching zero both limit to an infinitesimal cone singularity in hp as is the case for the hyperbolic spherical transition it is technically difficult to prove general statements about when a collapsing family of hyperbolic cone manifolds yields a transition to ads we do not prove such statements here rather we shift our point of view toward constructing geometric transitions from an hp structure regeneration rather than degeneration one main tool for such constructions used in particular to prove theorem 1 is the following regeneration theorem theorem 2 let n be a closed orientable three manifold with a half pipe structure h singular along a knot and with infinitesimal cone angle 0 let 0 1 m o 2 1 be the holonomy representation of the associated transversely hyperbolic foliation f suppose that h 1 1 n so 2 1 ad 0 r then there exists geometric structures on n singular along and parametrized by t which are hyperbolic cone structures with cone angle 2 t for t 0 ads structures with a tachyon of mass t for t 0 both families limit as projective structures to the initial hp structure h as t 0 the proof of theorem 2 given in section 4 involves a generalization of cone sin gularities to projective geometry these cone like singularities include cone singulari ties in hyperbolic geometry tachyons in ads geometry and infinitesimal cone singu larities in hp geometry the basic ingredient needed for theorem 2 is an open ness 3 principle proposition 8 for projective structures with cone like singularities akin to the thurston ehresmann principle for non singular structures we mention that in contrast to the convex projective structures studied by goldman gol 90 choi goldman cg 97 benoist ben 08 cooper long tillman clt 12 crampon marquis cm 12 and others the projective structures appearing in this article do not arise as quotients of domains in rp 3 the assumptions in theorem 2 are satisfied by a variety of examples including exam ples coming from small seifert fiber spaces as in theorem 1 and anosov torus bundles we refer the reader to dan 11 for a careful analysis of the torus bundle case using ideal tetrahedra the cohomology condition reminiscent of a similar condition appearing in porti s regeneration theorem for euclidean cone structures por 98 is simply a way to guarantee smoothness of the o 2 1 representation variety indeed given an hp struc ture our construction of a geometric transition really only requires that a transition exists on the level of representations which is implied by but does not require smoothness in section 6 we study certain structures collapsing to a punctured torus for which the o 2 1 representation variety is not smooth though we can still produce transitions we also ob serve an interesting flexibility phenomenon in this case a transitional hp structure can be deformed so that it no longer regenerates to hyperbolic structures theorem 1 gives a limited class of manifolds on which transitions may be constructed many more examples can be constructed using the techniques of dan 11 in which tran sitioning structures are built out of ideal tetrahedra 1 2 some context from the point of view of three manifold topology our construction is a bit surprising for in light of the work of porti and others see above one might expect that collaps ing hyperbolic cone manifolds should limit to the appropriate thurston geometry of the underlying manifold which in the context of theorem 1 is the riemannian geometry of sl 2 r instead theorem 1 produces a half pipe structure as the limit we note that while half pipe geometry and sl 2 r geometry are incompatible our results do not rule out the possibility that sl 2 r structures could be constructed as limits of hyperbolic structures in some other way however as of yet no such construction exists on the other hand from the point of view of ads geometry our results are not surprising at all many parallels in the studies of hyperbolic and ads geometry have ap peared in recent years beginning with mess s classification of maximal ads space times mes 07 abb 07 and its remarkable similarity to the simultaneous uniformization theo rem of bers ber 60 for quasi fuchsian hyperbolic structures also noteworthy is the wick rotation rescaling theory of benedetti bonsante bb 09 which gives a correlation between the boundaries of convex cores of constant curvature space times and those of geometri cally finite hyperbolic three manifolds stemming from mess s work results and questions in hyperbolic and ads geometry see bbd 12 have begun to appear in tandem sug gesting the existence of a deeper link our geometric transition construction provides a concrete connection strengthening the analogy between the two geometries organization of

preliminaries in this section we give a description of the g x formalism that is ubiquitous in the study of locally homogeneous geometric structures we will then describe real projective hyperbolic and ads geometry using this formalism in the final subsection we describe transversely hyperbolic foliations 2 1 deforming g x structures let g be a group of analytic diffeomorphisms of x recall that a g x structure on a manifold m is given by a collection of charts into x with transition maps being the restrictions of elements in g this data is equivalent to the data of a local diffeomorphism d m x called a developing map which is equivariant with respect to the holonomy representation 1 m g ehr 36 or see thu 80 gol 10 a smooth family of g x structures on a manifold m with boundary is given by a smooth family of developing maps dt m x equivariant with respect to a smooth family of holonomy representations t 1 m g two deformations dt and ft of a given structure d 0 are considered equivalent if there exists a path gt g and a path t of diffeomorphisms defined on all but a small neighborhood of m so that dt gt ft t where t is a lift of t to m and we assume g 0 1 and 0 id a trivial deformation of d 0 is of the form dt gt d 0 t in this case the holonomy representations differ by a path of conjugations t gt 0 g 1 t such a deformation of the holonomy representation is also called trivial let r 1 m g be the space of representations up to conjugation we only consider points at which this quotient is reasonable let d m g x be the space of all g x structures on m up to the equivalence described above the following fact known as the ehresmann thurston principle is crucial for the study of deformations of g x structures 5 proposition 1 ehresmann thurston the map hol d m g x r 1 m g which maps a g x structure to its holonomy representation is well defined and a local homeomorphism we emphasize that the definition of d m g x above does not consider behavior at the boundary in particular given a structure d 0 with special geometric features at m proposition 1 may produce nearby g x structures with very different boundary geometry often and it will always be the case in this paper it is desirable to deform g x structures with control over the geometry at the boundary this is the case for example in the study of hyperbolic cone structures see hk 98 the proposition is not strong enough in these cases and a thorough study of the boundary geometry is needed in section 4 we will pay careful attention to this issue as we deform from hyperbolic cone structures to ads tachyon structures 2 2 infinitesimal deformations consider a smooth family of representations t 1 m g the derivative of the homo morphism condition evaluated at t 0 gives that ab a 0 b 0 a b this is a statement in the tangent space at 0 ab in g in order to translate all of the tangent vectors back to the identity we multiply this equation by 0 ab 1 ab 0 ab 1 a 0 a 1 0 a b 0 b 1 0 a 1 a 0 a 1 ad 0 a b 0 b 1 letting g tidg denote the lie algebra of g define z 1 m g by z 0 1 then z satisfies the cocycle condition z ab z a ad 0 a z b 1 the group cocycles z 1 1 m gad 0 are defined to be all functions z satisfying equation 1 for all a b 1 m the cocyle z z 1 1 m gad 0 is called an infinitesimal deformation of the representation 0 next suppose t gt 0 g 1 t is a trivial deformation of 0 differentiating shows that 0 1 g ad 0 g the co boundaries b 1 1 m gad 0 are defined to be all group cocycles z such that z u ad 0 u for some u g these are the trivial infinitesimal deformations now define the cohomology group h 1 1 m gad 0 z 1 1 m gad 0 b 1 1 m gad 0 if r 1 m g is a smooth manifold at 0 then h 1 1 m gad 0 describes the tangent space at 0 in all cases of interest here g is an algebraic group and the representation space r 1 m g can be given the structure of an algebraic variety 6 2 3 projective geometry real projective geometry will provide the framework for the constructions in this paper it is more flexible than metric geometries but nonetheless has a lot of useful structure the real projective space rpn is the space of lines in rn 1 it is an n dimensional manifold orientable if and only if n is odd the group gl n 1 r acts by diffeomorphisms on rpn with kernel given by its center i r thus pgl n 1 r defined to be the quotient of gl n 1 r by its center acts faithfully by diffeomorphisms on rpn a hyperplane of dimension k 1 in rn 1 descends to a copy of rpk inside rpn which we call a k plane the lines in rpn are described by the case k 1 they correspond to two dimensional planes in rn 1 note that k planes in rpn are taken to other k planes by pgl n 1 r so these are well defined geometric objects in projective geometry they play the role of totally geodesic hyperplanes in a riemannian model geometry a projective structure on a manifold mn is an g x structure for g pgl n 1 r x rpn hyperbolic structures ads structures and half pipe structures to be defined in section 3 are special examples of projective structures 2 4 hyperbolic geometry and cone singularities given a smooth manifold m the data of a hyperbolic metric on m i e a riemannian metric with sectional curvatures equal to 1 is equivalent to a g x structure on m where x hn and g isom hn is the group of isometries of hn for basics of of hyperbolic geometry see thu 80 thu 97 rat 94 we quickly recall the definitions and then describe the main structures of interest hyperbolic manifolds with cone singularities let rn 1 denote rn 1 equipped with the n 1 minkowski form 1 0 0 in the projective model for hyperbolic space is given by the negative lines with respect to this quadratic form hn x xt x 0 r the group po n 1 pgl n 1 r of matrices up to i that preserve defines the isometry group in this model so every hyperbolic structure is also a projective structure and we say that hyperbolic geometry is a specialization or sub geometry of projective geometry geodesic lines and hyperplanes in hn are given by lines and hyperplanes in rpn that intersect hn we now restrict to dimension three let n be a closed oriented three manifold with a knot in n let m n a hyperbolic cone manifold structure on n is given by a smooth hyperbolic structure on m such that the geodesic completion is topologically n see hk 98 the holonomy representation for the cone manifold structure refers to the holonomy representation for the smooth structure on m consider a tubular neighborhood t of the developing map d on t extends to the geodesic completion t which is the universal branched cover of t branched over the image d is a one dimensional set in h 3 which must be fixed point wise by the holonomy of a meridian encircling we will assume is non trivial 7 glue figure 1 schematic of a cone singularity in h 3 or any riemannian model geometry perpendicular to the singular locus the geometry is that of a cone point on a surface then is a rotation about a geodesic l in h 3 and d maps diffeomorphically onto l in this sense the singular locus is totally geodesic the local geometry at points of is determined by the cone angle given up to a multiple of 2 by the rotation angle of to determine the full cone angle one may lift the developing map d to h 3 l yeilding a lift of 1 t to the universal cover h l of the subgroup hl po n 1 that preserves l the lifted holonomy of then measures the full cone angle note that totally geodesic discs orthogonal to the singular locus exist and are isometric to h 2 cones of the same cone angle we mention that it is equivalent to describe the geometry of n near points of using finitely many charts that extend to that is for a point p there exists simply connected open sets u 1 uk in m and charts 1 k such that the closures u 1 uk cover a neighborhood of p in n and each chart i extends continuously to u i one may also construct a cone singularity by glueing together one or more polygonal wedges around a line as in figure 1 2 5 ads geometry and tachyons anti de sitter ads geometry is a lorentzian analogue of hyperbolic geometry in the sense that adsn has all sectional curvatures equal to 1 however the metric on adsn is indefinite of signature n 1 1 vectors of negative length squared are called time like vectors of positive length squared are called space like and non zero vectors with zero length are called light like or null for basics on lorentzian geometry see bee 96 or any physics text on relativity the implications of negative curvature in lorentzian geometry are somewhat different than in riemannian geometry for example adsn has an ideal boundary at infinity but only space like and light like geodesics have endpoints on this ideal boundary time like geodesics on the other hand are periodic the geometry in the time like directions acts more like a positively curved riemannian space the reader may consult bb 09 or dan 11 for some basics of ads geometry let rn 1 2 denote rn 1 equipped with the n 1 2 minkowski form which we choose to write as follows 1 0 00 in 1 0 0 0 1 the projective model of adsn is given by adsn x rn 1 xt x 0 r 8 the group po n 1 2 of matrices up to i that preserve defines the isometry group in this model if n is even then po n 1 2 so n 1 2 has two components one that preserves time orientation and one that reverses it if n is odd po n 1 2 has four components corresponding to the binary conditions orientation preserving or not and time orientation preserving or not the orientation preserving time orientation preserving subgroup is the component of the identity po 0 n 1 2 pso 0 n 1 2 the orientation preserving subgroup is pso n 1 2 totally geodesic lines and planes are given by lines and planes in rpn which intersect adsn a line is time like light like or space like if the signature of the corresponding 2 plane in rn 1 is 0 2 degenerate or 1 1 respectively each codimension one space like plane meaning positive definite signature is isometric to a copy of hn 1 we now specialize to dimension three and describe the ads analogue of a cone singu larity a tachyon let n be a closed three manifold with a knot in n let m n we give the following definition of an ads 3 manifold with tachyon singularities barbot bonsante schlenker give an equivalent definition in bbs 09 as well as a detailed discussion of tachyons and other singularities in ads definition 1 an ads 3 structure on n with a tachyon at is given by a smooth ads 3 structure on m such that the geodesic completion is topologically n the singular locus is required to be space like and the local future and local past at points of must each be connected and non empty glue figure 2 schematic of a tachyon singularity in ads 3 the geometry orthogonal to the space like singular locus can be constructed by glueing a wedge in ads 2 together with a lorentz boost the glueing depicted produces a tachyon of mass consider a tubular neighborhood t of the developing map d on t extends to the geodesic completion t which is the universal branched cover of t branched over the image d is locally a one dimensional set in ads 3 which must be fixed by the holonomy of a meridian around assuming is non trivial it point wise fixes a geodesic l in ads 3 and d maps diffeomorphically onto l in this sense is totally geodesic by definition l is required to be space like the group gl of orientation preserving isometries that pointwise fix a space like geodesic l is isomorphic to r z 2 the z 2 factor is rotation by while the non compact r factor corresponds to a hyperbolic rotation around l acting as a lorentz boost in each tangent plane orthogonal to l we choose an orientation of l which then determines an orientation on the tangent planes l the hyperbolic angle of a hyperbolic rotation a gl is determined by cosh vt av 9 where v l is any space like unit vector the sign of is determined from the orientation of l by the convention 0 if v av matches the orientation of l the tachyon mass is the hyperbolic angle of provided that is chosen to wind around in the direction consistent with the chosen orientation of l note that the sign of the tachyon mass is independent of the chosen orientation of l the length of is given by the translational part of the holonomy of a longitude of in general may also have a component in gl as in the riemannian case the local geometry at a singularity is in general captured by a lifted version of the local holonomy with image in the lift g l of gl to the universal cover adsn l the group g l r z is generated factor wise by hyperbolic rotations and rotations by integer multiples of the z component of an element of g l is called the discrete rotational part proposition 2 the discrete rotational part of the holonomy around is 2 proof this follows from the condition that the local future and local past at points of must be connected and non empty choose a representative t for the meridian so that for every t t lies on a ray orthogonal to emanating from p then d t lies entirely in the plane l orthogonal to l at the point q d p as the future of p and the past of p each have one component d t crosses the four light like rays emanating from q in l exactly once counted with sign as with cone singularities the geometry near a point of the tachyon can be equiv alently described using finitely many charts that extend to one may also construct tachyons by glueing together one or more polygonal wedges around a space like line as depicted in figure 2 if the mass is negative this construction can be performed using one wedge with space like faces as in figure 2 interestingly there is another way to construct a tachyon which is not directly analogous to the riemannian case begin with a tubular neighborhood u of a space like geodesic l in ads the light cone c of l consists of all light like lines passing through l orthogonally it is the union of two light like degenerate planes which cross at l removing l from c gives four disjoint open half planes note that the hyperbolic rotations around l preserve each of these light like half planes a tachyon is produced by slitting u along one such half plane and reglueing via a hyperbolic rotation figure 3 depicts a two dimensional cross section of this construction l light space past future s s figure 3 a two dimensional cross section of a tachyon can be constructed by cutting along a light like ray and then glueing back together with a lorentz boost which act as a dilation along the ray the figure depicts a tachyon of negative mass this construction should be compared with the construction of figure 2 which produces the same geometry 10 2 6 transversely hyperbolic foliations let x be a n k dimensional model geometry a transversely g x foliation on a manifold mn is a smooth foliation by k dimensional leaves so that locally the space of leaves has a g x structure more concretely a transversely g x foliation is defined by charts u rk x so that each transition map 1 f g respects the product structure and acts on the first factor by a smooth function f and on the second factor by the restriction of an element g g as we do not require the smooth functions f to be analytic a transversely g x foliation is not itself a g x structure consider the case k 1 with x hn 1 g isom hn 1 then a transversely g x structure on m is called a transversely hyperbolic foliation one can analytically continue charts in the usual way to build a pseudo developing map d m x which is a local submersion equivariant with respect to a representation 1 m g again called the holonomy representation this degenerate developing map encapsulates all of the information about the foliation and its transverse structure transversely hyperbolic foliations arise as limits of degenerating hyperbolic structures assume for simplicity that m is orientable consider a path dt m hn of developing maps for hyperbolic structures such that d 0 limt 0 dt collapses to a local submersion onto a codimension one hyperbolic space p hn 1 the limit d 0 will be equivariant with respect to the limiting holonomy representation 0 the image of 0 must lie in the subgroup h of isom hn that preserves the plane p this group h is exactly the isometries of p so d 0 defines a transversely p h hn 1 isom hn 1 structure on m the following theorem of thurston classifies the topology of closed three manifolds m that admit a transversely hyperbolic foliation theorem thm 4 9 thu 80 suppose m 3 is a closed manifold endowed with a trans versely hyperbolic foliation let d be a pseudo developing map with holonomy then one of the following holds a the holonomy group 1 m is discrete and d descends to a seifert fibration d 1 m m h 2 1 m b the holonomy group 1 m is not discrete and m fibers over the circle with fiber a torus theorem 1 of the introduction produces hyperbolic cone manifolds that collapse as the cone angle approaches 2 to the transversely hyperbolic foliation defined by a seifert fibration as in case a above 3 transition theory half pipe structures our description of the transition between hyperbolic and ads geometry hinges on the understanding of an interesting new transitional geometry which we call half pipe or hp geometry that bridges the gap between hyperbolic and ads geometry recall that we wish to construct transitions in the context of hyperbolic and anti de sitter structures 11 that collapse onto a co dimension one hyperbolic space therefore our model for hpn should be the midpoint in a family of models xs which share a common embedded co dimension one hyperbolic space we give a natural construction of such a family of models inside of real projective geometry though the main focus will be the case n 3 we develop this part of the theory in all dimensions n 2 3 1 hn and adsn as domains in rpn consider the family s of diagonal forms on rn 1 given by s 1 0 00 in 1 0 0 0 sign s s 2 where s is a real parameter and in 1 represents the identity matrix each form s defines a region xs in rpn by the inequality xt sx x 21 x 2 2 x 2 n sign s s 2 x 2 n 1 0 for each s xs is a homogeneous sub space of rpn which is preserved by the group gs of linear transformations that preserve s the usual projective model for hyperbolic geometry is given by hn x 1 withg 1 po n 1 in fact for all s 0 an isomorphism x 1 xs is given by the rescaling map rs in 0 0 s 1 pgl n 1 r note that rs conjugates po n 1 to gs similarly x 1 is the usual projective model for anti de sitter geometry adsn with g 1 po n 1 2 for all s 0 the map rs gives an isomorphism x 1 xs conjugating po n 1 2 into gs the rescaling map rs should be thought of as a projective change of coordinates which does not change intrinsic geometric properties remark 1 for s 6 0 a constant curvature 1 metric on xs is obtained by considering the hyperboloid model defined by xt sx 1 in this sense the maps rs are isometries there is a distinguished codimension one totally geodesic hyperbolic space pn 1 defined by xn 1 0 and x 21 x 2 2 x 2 n 0 note that pn 1 is contained in xs for all s the rescaling map rs point wise fixes pn 1 3 2 rescaling the degeneration definition of hpn the space x 0 is a natural intermediary space between hn and adsn however as the metric 0 is degenerate the full group of isometries of x 0 makes the structure too flimsy to be of much use in our transition context in order to determine a useful structure group for x 0 we examine the degeneration context in which we hope to construct a transition in this section we will not pay close attention to technical details about collapsing 12 figure 4 for each s 0 the hyperboloid xt sx 1 gives a model for h 2 left four figures as s 0 the limit is the hyperboloid model for hp 2 shown right the distinguished codimension one hyperbolic space p h 1 is shown in red consider a family of developing maps dt m x 1 with holonomy t 1 m g 1 po n 1 defined for t 0 suppose that at time t 0 our developing maps collapse to d 0 a local submersion onto the co dimension one hyperbolic space pn 1 in particular the last coordinate xn 1 converges to the zero function the holonomy representations t then converge to a representation 0 with image in the subgroup h 0 po n 1 1 that preserves pn 1 the one dimensional foliation defined by the local submersion d 0 has a natural transverse hn 1 structure the foliation together with its transverse structure is called a transversely hyperbolic foliation see section 2 6 we assume for simplicity that the the fibers of the foliation can be consistently oriented so that in particular the holonomy representation 0 of the transverse structure has image in the subgroup h 0 a 0 0 1 a so n 1 1 i pso n 1 1 next apply the rescaling map rt to get the family rtdt m xt this does not change the intrinsic hyperbolic geometry but extrinsically in rpn this stretches out the collapsing direction rt rescales the xn 1 coordinate by 1 t let us assume that rtdt converges as t 0 to a local diffeomorphism d m x 0 the map d will be equivariant with respect to a representation d 1 m pgl n 1 r this representation is the limit of the holonomy representations for the xt structures determined by rtdt which are given by the representations rt tr 1 t for a particular 1 m we write t a t w t v t a t where a is n n w vt rn and a r then rt t r 1 t a t tw t v t t a t t 0 a 0 0 v 0 1 d 2 the special form of d motivates the following definition definition 2 define hpn x 0 and ghp to be the subgroup of pgl n 1 r of matrices defined up to i with the form a 0 v 1 where a o n 1 1 and vt rn we refer to ghp as the group of half pipe isometries a structure modeled on hp n ghp is called a half pipe structure definition 3 we say that any path of o n 1 representations t satisfying the limit 2 is compatible to first order at t 0 with d 13 both lie algebras so n 1 and so n 1 2 split with respect to the adjoint action of o n 1 1 as the direct sum so n 1 1 rn 1 1 in both cases the rn 1 1 factor describes the tangent directions normal to o n 1 1 the group ghp is really a semi direct product ghp rn 1 1 o o n 1 1 where an element a 0 v 1 is thought of as an infinitesimal deformation v of the element a normal to o n 1 1 into either o n 1 or o n 1 2 we also note that the isotropy group of a point in hpn is rn 1 o o n 1 z 2 the subgroup that fixes a point and also preserves orientation and the orientation of the degenerate direction is rn 1 o so n 1 3 3 example singular torus we give an illustrative example in dimension n 2 of transitioning singular structures on a torus let f 2 a b be the free group on two generators for t 0 define the following representations into g 1 po 2 1 t a 3 2 2 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 1 t b 1 t 2 0 t 0 1 0 t 0 1 t 2 for small t the commutator t a b is elliptic rotating by an amount t 2 2 t o t 2 these representations describe a family of hyperbolic cone tori with cone angle t as t 0 these tori collapse onto a circle the geodesic representing a next we rescale this family to produce a limiting half pipe representation rt t a r 1 t t a independent of t rt t b r 1 t 1 t 2 0 t 2 0 1 0 1 0 1 t 2 t 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 after applying rt the fundamental domains for the hyperbolic cone tori limit to a funda mental domain for a singular hp structure on the torus see figure 5 the commutator rt t a b r 1 t t 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 2 2 2 1 fixes the singular point and shears in the degenerate direction this half pipe isometry can be thought of as an infinitesimal rotation in h 2 rescale figure 5 fundamental domains for hyperbolic cone tori collapsing to a circle shown in red the collapsing structures are rescaled to converge to an hp structure right 14 next consider the family of singular ads 2 structures on the torus given by the following g 1 pso 1 2 representations defined for t 0 t a 3 2 2 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 1 t b 1 t 2 0 t 0 1 0 t 0 1 t 2 here the commutator t a b acts as a lorentz boost by hyperbolic angle t 2 t o t 2 about a fixed point in ads 2 these representations describe a family of ads tori with a singular point of hyperbolic angle t the singular point is the lorentzian analogue of a cone point in riemannian gometry we describe the three dimensional version of this singularity in more detail in section 2 5 again as t 0 these tori collapse onto a circle the geodesic representing a similar to the above we have that rt t b r 1 t t 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 showing that the limiting hp representation for these collapsing ads structures is the same as for the above hyperbolic structures so we have described a transition on the level of representations indeed applying rt to fundamental domains for the collapsing ads structures gives the same limiting hp structure as in the hyperbolic case above rescale figure 6 the hp structure left from figure 5 is also the rescaled limit of ads tori with boost singularities fundamental domains for the ads structures are shown right 3 4 the geometry of hpn though hpn does not have an invariant riemannian metric there are some useful geo metric tools for studying hp structures to begin with the form 0 induces a degenerate metric on hpn the degenerate direction defines a foliation of hpn by degenerate lines these are exactly the lines of constant x 1 xn coordinates with xn 1 allowed to vary there is a projection map hpn pn 1 hn 1 given in coordinates by x 1 xn xn 1 x 1 xn 0 which makes the foliation by degenerate lines a trivial r bundle over hn 1 the projec tion commutes with the action of ghp in the sense that if g ghp then g g where ghp o n 1 1 is given by a 0 v 1 a thus defines a transverse hyperbolic structure on the degenerate lines of hpn this transverse structure descends to any hpn structure on a manifold m so an hp structure on m induces a transversely hyperbolic foliation on m see section 2 6 this can be described directly with devel oping maps if d m hpn is a local diffeomorphism equivariant with respect to 1 m ghp then d 0 d is a local submersion onto hn 1 which is equivariant with respect to 1 m o n 1 1 thinking of the induced transversely hyperbolic foliation we will sometimes refer to the degenerate direction as the fiber direction 15 topologically hpn is just hn 1 r a particularly useful diffeomorphism is given by l hpn hn 1 r where is the projection defined above and l is defined in coordinates by l x 1 xn xn 1 xn 1 x 1 1 x 2 x 1 2 xn x 1 2 hp 2 fiber p figure 7 the hyperboloid model of half pipe geometry in dimension two the degenerate fibers blue foliate hp 2 our choice of structure group ghp makes the geometry more stiff than the geometry of the degenerate metric alone in particular the non zero vector field xfiber x 1 1 x 2 x 1 2 xn x 1 2 xn 1 descends to hpn rpn and is invariant under ghp up to it is tangent to the de generate direction the group ghp has four components corresponding to the conditions orientation preserving or not and preserving xfiber or flipping it we denote the two components that preserve xfiber by g f hp declaring xfiber to have length one we can measure lengths along degenerate fibers as follows let t be a path parallel to the degenerate direction defined for t a b then t f t xfiber and we define lfiber b a f t dt we note that lfiber l b l a proposition 3 lfiber is invariant under ghp the sign of lfiber is preserved by the subgroup g f hp that preserves the fiber direction note that we can not measure such a fiber length for a path transverse to the fiber direction because there is no invariant projection onto the fiber direction this is the reason that no invariant riemannian metric exists on hpn remark 2 although we have not yet given a detailed discussion of singularities in hp geometry see section 4 2 we note here that at least in dimensions n 2 and n 3 all hp structures on closed manifolds must have singularities see the author s thesis dan 11 for a proof this might not be surprising as hp geometry was designed for the purpose of transitioning from singular hyperbolic structures to singular ads structures 16 3 5 regeneration in this section we show how to regenerate hn and adsn structures from hpn structures proposition 4 regeneration let m 0 be a compact n manifold with boundary and let m be a thickening of m 0 so that m m 0 is a collar neighborhood of m 0 suppose m has an hp structure defined by developing map dhp and holonomy representation hp let x be either hn or adsn and let t 1 m 0 isom x be a family of representations compatible to first order at time t 0 with hp in the sense of equation 2 then we can construct a family of x structures on m 0 with holonomy t for short time proof if x h 3 we take t to be defined for t 0 while if x ads 3 then we take t to be defined for t 0 this allows us to use the notation from section 3 1 and treat both cases at once the representations t rt tr 1 t 1 m 0 gt pgl n 1 r converge by as sumption to hp in pgl n 1 r thus thinking of the hp structure as a projective structure the ehresmann thurston principle proposition 1 implies that for small time there is a family of nearby projective structures on m 0 with holonomies t these pro jective structures are given by developing maps ft m 0 rpn which converge in the compact open topology to d as t 0 we show now that ft is the developing map for an gt xt structure we will use the following easy lemma lemma 1 let k be a compact set and let ft k rp 3 be any continuous family of functions suppose f 0 k is contained in xs then there is an 0 such that t and r s implies that ft k is contained in xr consider a compact fundamental domain k m 0 d k is a compact set contained in hpn x 0 rpn by the lemma ft k is also contained in xt for all t sufficiently small now since ft is equivariant with respect to t 1 m gt we have that the entire image of ft is contained in xt thus for small t ft determines an xt structure with holonomy t now applying the inverse of the rescaling map gives developing maps dt r 1 t ft into x which are equivariant with respect to t r 1 t trt these define the desired x structures note that while this proposition applies in broader generality than theorem 2 from the introduction it does not guarantee any control of the geometry at the boundary we study behavior near the boundary in section 4 in light of the constructions of this section we make the following definition of geo metric transition note that there is no mention of half pipe geometry in the definition definition 4 let m be an n dimensional manifold a geometric transition from hn structures to adsn structures is a continuous path of projective structures pt on m so that for t 0 pt is conjugate to a hyperbolic structure for t 0 pt is conjugate to an ads structure proposition 4 implies 17 proposition 5 let m be a compact manifold with boundary and let ht be a path of hyperbolic resp anti de sitter structures on m that degenerate to a transverse hyperbolic foliation suppose the ht limit as projective structures to an hp structure then a transition to anti de sitter resp hyperbolic structures can be constructed if and only if the transition can be constructed on the level of representations 4 singular three dimensional structures in this section our goal is to build transitions from hyperbolic cone structures to their ads analogues tachyon structures to do this we generalize the notion of cone singularity to projective structures we focus on dimension three though much of what is said here applies in general 4 1 cone like singularities for rp 3 structures let n be an orientable three manifold with n a knot let m n definition 5 a cone like projective structure with a cone like singularity on n is a smooth projective structure on m defined by charts u such that every chart u rp 3 extends continuously to the closure u in the case u contains points of we require that maps u diffeomorphically to a segment of a line l in rp 3 for every point p there is a neighborhood b of p and finitely many charts 1 u 1 k uk such that b is covered by u 1 uk and for each j b uj m is called the smooth part and is called the singular locus note that in the case u u contains points of the transition function g pgl 3 r maps l to l we note that a projective structure with cone like singularities on n induces an rp 1 structure on which is compatible with the projective structure on m n definition 6 let n and n be two projective three manifolds with cone like singularities an isomorphism n n is an isomorphism of projective structures n n which extends to a diffeomorphism n n we note that is an isomorphism of the induced rp 1 structures on and proposition 6 let n be a projective manifold with a cone like singularity let b be a small neighborhood of a point p with b b then the developing map d on b b extends to the universal branched cover b b b b of b branched over b d maps b diffeomorphically onto an interval of a line l in rp 3 the holonomy 1 b b point wise fixes l 18 r 0 r 1 d y l x figure 8 the developing map near a cone like singularity in particular there are cylindrical coordinates r x y 0 1 r z 0 1 around b which lift to coordinates on b so that limr 0 d r x y f y is a local submersion to l independent of x proof from the definition of cone like singularity we may chooseb and charts 1 u 1 k uk so that b u 1 uk b and ki 1 ui b by restricting to a smaller neighborhood we may assume that the following holds ui uj is either empty or ui uj b the ui are arranged in order around we construct the developing map using u 1 uk by first lifting u 1 to b and mapping into rp 3 with 1 then the usual analytic continuation process defines d on the rest of b note that by our assumptions ui ui 1 must be non empty and so the transition function gi i 1 maps li 1 to li since b ui for all i d extends continuously mapping b to l 1 by a diffeomorphism hence d extends to the universal branched cover b b b b the coordinates r x y are easily obtained by pulling back any choice of cylindrical coordinates around l 1 in rp 3 the converse of the proposition is also true suppose there is a projective structure on m and assume that is covered by neighborhoods b so that the developing map d on b extends to the universal branched cover b mapping b diffeomorphically to a line then it is easy to construct charts satisfying the requirements of definition 5 so n is a projective structure with a cone like singularity therefore the two singularities of interest in hyperbolic and ads geometry are both examples proposition 7 let n be a three manifold and a knot in n then cone singularities are cone like the underlying projective structure of a hyperbolic cone structure see section 2 4 on n has a cone like singularity at tachyons are cone like the underlying projective structure of an ads structure with a tachyon see section 2 5 on n has a cone like singularity at 19 let gl denote the elements of pgl 4 r which point wise fix l and preserve orien tation we fix an orientation of l and an orientation of rp 3 which determines a positive direction of rotation around l we define the rotation angle map r gl s 1 as follows given a gl there is a representative a so that the eigenvalues corresponding to l are both one let 3 4 be the other eigenvalues if 3 4 are complex then a is similar in sl 4 r to the block diagonal form a i 2 0 0 r where r rotates by angle in the positive direction in this case define r a ei if 3 4 are real then they both have the same sign and we define r a sign 2 the rotation angle function r gl s 1 is a homotopy equivalence now consider d and as in proposition 6 and let t 1 b l we can find a path g t gl such that d t g t d 0 with g 0 1 and g 1 the path g t is unique up to homotopy and defines the lifted holonomy g l let m be a meridian encircling in the direction consistent with the local orientation of the geometry in a neighborhood of a point of is determined by the lifted holonomy m there is extra information contained in the lifted holonomy m that is missing from m m does not detect how many times d m winds around l this information is contained in the total rotational part of defined by the lifted rotation angle map r g l r r r g t the map r 1 b r is a homomorphism note that it does not in general extend to a representation of 1 m definition 7 the quantity r m is the rotational part of the holonomy at l note that the rotational part of the holonomy must satisfy ei r in the case that the eigenvalues of are real is an integer multiple of and we call the discrete rotational part of the holonomy at l note that in the case of hyperbolic cone manifolds the rotational part of the holonomy at is exactly the cone angle and determines the local geometry entirely however in this more general setting there can be many geometrically different cones with the same rotational holonomy a projective structure with cone like singularities along a multiple component link can be defined analogously over the next few sections we will assume has one component this will be the case in the main theorem we are heading towards and it also keeps the discussion tidy however all of the basic theory we develop can easily be extended to the multiple component case 4 2 infinitesimal cone singularities in hp 3 in order to develop a theory of geometric transitions with singularities we consider hp structures with a singularity that is cone like with respect to the underlying projective structure these singularities arise naturally as rescaled limits of collapsing neighborhoods of cone singularities resp tachyons in h 3 resp ads 3 20 definition 8 let n be an oriented three manifold with n a knot let m n an hp structure with infinitesimal cone singularity on n is a smooth hp structure on m whose underlying projective structure has a cone like singularity at further we require that there are exactly two degenerate rays emanating from each point of hence is a non degenerate line and the discrete rotational part of the holonomy around is 2 in this section we describe model neighborhoods around an infinitesimal cone singu larity using the hp geometry we will show that the local geometry of any infinitesimal cone singularity is realized as the rescaled limit of a model collapsing neighborhood of a cone resp tachyon singularity in hyperbolic resp ads geometry we begin by demonstrating this on the level of holonomy representations let t be a solid torus with core curve and assume that t has an hp structure with infinitesimal cone singularity at let m be a meridian encircling in the positive direction with respect to the orientation of if the holonomy m is trivial then the hp structure extends smoothly over i e there is no singularity this follows from the requirement that the rotational part of the holonomy around be 2 so we assume that m is non trivial then m lies in the group kl of hp isometries that pointwise fix a non degenerate line l and preserve both orientation and the direction along degenerate fibers the holonomy of a longitude will lie in the group hl of hp isometries that preserve l the orientation of l and the orientation of hp 3 glue figure 9 orthogonal to the singular locus the geometry can be constructed by glueing together the two non degenerate boundary rays of a wedge with an infinitesimal rotation by conjugating in ghp we may assume m and have the following forms m 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 cosh d sinh d 0 0 sinh d cosh d 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 the general form of m describes kl r while the general form of describes hl rd r z 2 the rd factor consists of pure translations along l and the z 2 factor is a rotation by around l which reverses direction along degenerate fibers we will see how to interpret the r factor shortly recall that there is a hyperbolic plane p 2 hp 3 which we think of as simultaneously lying in each of our family of models xs refer to section 3 1 for notation note that if m are in the form given above then the preserved line l lies in p if is the limit of rescaled po 3 1 representations t then assuming that l lies in p corresponds to assuming that the axis of t m t 21 in h 3 lies in p at least to first order without loss in generality we will assume this throughout the section it is easy to construct a path t m po 3 1 whose rescaled limit agrees with define the path as follows t m 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 cos t sin t 0 0 sin t cos t t cosh d sinh d 0 0 sinh d cosh d 0 0 0 0 cos t sin t 0 0 sin t cos t these representations describe hyperbolic cone structures on a tubular neighborhood of with cone angles approaching 2 one easily checks that conjugating t by the rescaling map rt produces the desired limit as t 0 for example rt t m r 1 t 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 cos t t sin t 0 0 sin t t cos t t 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 the quantity describes the first order change in rotation angle of t m at t 0 hence we call m an infinitesimal rotation we note that if 0 the cone angle of nearby hyperbolic cone structures must be increasing while if 0 the cone angle of nearby hyperbolic structures will be decreasing definition 9 the infinitesimal cone angle around is defined to be the quantity note that the sign is well defined and that the lifted holonomy m is a rotation by 2 plus an infinitesimal rotation by remark 3 by an argument using the schlafli formula collapsing hyperbolic cone mani folds must have increasing cone angle see hod 86 por 98 for this reason we speculate that singular hp structures on closed three manifolds with positive infinitesimal cone angle 0 should not exist in most cases it is just as easy to construct a path of representations t m po 2 2 whose rescaled limit agrees with define the path as follows t m 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 cosh t sinh t 0 0 sinh t cosh t t cosh d sinh d 0 0 sinh d cosh d 0 0 0 0 cosh t sinh t 0 0 sinh t cosh t these representations describe ads structures on a tubular neighborhood of with a tachyon at of mass t one easily checks that conjugating t by the rescaling map rt produces the desired limit as t 0 hence the infinitesimal angle can also be thought of as an infinitesimal tachyon mass next we work directly with the hp geometry at let p and consider a neigh borhood b of p the developing map d on b extends to the universal branched cover b branched over b the image of b is a segment of a non degenerate line l which we may assume lies in p consider the plane p orthogonal to l and passing through 22 d p as p is spanned by the fiber direction and a non degenerate direction orthogonal to l the restricted metric is degenerate on p the inverse image cp d 1 p is a disk in b away from p cp is locally modeled on hp 2 the singularity at p is a cone like hp 2 singularity we may as in the h 3 and ads 3 cases parallel translate cp or at least a smaller neighborhood of p in cp along the interval i b giving the identification b cp i near i let w be a wedge in cp modeled on a wedge in hp 2 and define the product wedge u w i product wedges are as in the hyperbolic and ads case the most natural geometric charts at the singular locus we now construct some particularly useful wedges for simplicity this part of the discussion will take place in dimension two the corresponding three dimensional behavior is easily described by taking the product with a non degenerate geodesic consider the hp 2 cone cp defined above by assumption there are two degenerate rays emanating from p pick one of these rays r and let w be cp but with a slit along the ray r so that the boundary ofw contains two copies r r of r with opposite orientation though it is a bit of an abuse we count w as a wedge it is isomorphic to a disk v in hp 2 with a slit along a degenerate ray s emanating from the center q of v the boundary of v contains two copies s s of s we take s to be the positive ray meaning that it is adjacent to the portion of v containing a small positive rotation of s the glueing map g identifies s to s by an infinitesimal rotation fixing q note that g fixes s point wise nonetheless the geometry at q is singular for the glueing map does not preserve the lines transverse to s see figure 10 the holonomy around p is a rotation by 2 composed with g degenerate direction non degenerate lines s s q figure 10 a disk v is slit along a ray in the degenerate direction it is then glued back together using a non trivial infinitesimal rotation to produce an infinitesimal cone singularity this construction should be compared with the construction of figure 9 which produces the same geometry next we construct a model degeneration of hyperbolic cones see section 2 4 which when rescaled converge to a given hp cone again we give the construction in two dimensions the three dimensional case is described by taking the product with a geodesic we will assume that the infinitesimal cone angle 0 so that we can easily draw a picture let t 2 t construct a polygonal wedge v t in h 2 with seven sides six right angles and a seventh concave angle at the center point of the wedge as in figure 11 glueing v t together along the sides adjacent to the center point produces a rectangle with a cone point at the center we arrange for v t to be long and skinny with width roughly equal to one and thickness t o t 2 further we arrange one ray s of the concave part of the wedge to be aligned with the collapsing direction the glueing map g t is a rotation by t now the rescaled limit of these collapsing wedges v t 23 produces an hp wedge v of the type described in the previous paragraph the glueing map g is the rescaled limit of a rotation by t which is an infinitesimal rotation by as demonstrated explicitly above t t o 1 fiber collapse rescale h 2 v hp 2 figure 11 polygonal hyperbolic wedges collapse onto a line as the interior wedge angle 2 t approaches 2 each wedge is glued together to form a rectangle with a cone point at the center the rescaled limit of the wedges v is an hp polygon with a slit along the fiber direction glueing the slit together with the rescaled limit of the glueing maps produces an hp infinitesimal cone singularity with infinitesimal angle next we construct a model degeneration of ads tachyons see section 2 5 that when rescaled converge to the given hp cone let t t let v t be a wedge in ads 2 bounded by seven edges as in figure 12 the five edges along the convex part of the perimeter should alternate space like time like space like time like space like meeting at four right angles we arrange for the space like edges to be of roughly constant length while the time like edges have time like length t o t 2 the two remaining edges s s border a slit along a light like ray emanating from the center q of the wedge the glueing map g t which a is lorentz boost of hyperbolic angle identifies s with s the action of g t on s is a dilation by e now the rescaled limit of these collapsing wedges v t produces an hp wedge v of the type described in the previous paragraph the glueing map g is the rescaled limit of a boost by hyperbolic angle t which is an infinitesimal rotation by alternatively thought of as an infinitesimal boost 4 3 deforming cone like projective structures in order to prove a regeneration theorem for hyperbolic cone resp ads tachyon struc tures we need to extend the thurston ehresmann principle proposition 1 to the class of projective structures with cone like singularities that is we must show that an ap propriate deformation of the holonomy representation of a cone like projective structure produces nearby cone like projective structures let n be a three manifold with n a knot and let m n let t m be a neighborhood of m so t is the result of removing from a tubular neighborhood of in n let t be the universal cover of t we assume that 1 t 1 m so that t embeds 24 light fiber direction xt ads hp collapse rt o 1 t time figure 12 polygons with a slit along a light like ray in ads 2 are glued together with a lorentz boost of hyperbolic angle t t to form rectangles with a singular point at the center after rescaling the collapsing time like direction these polygons converge to an hp polygon with a slit along a degenerate ray this wedge is glued together with the rescaled limit of the lorentz boosts an infinitesimal rotation thought of as an infinitesimal boost by angle in m the fundamental group 1 t z z is generated by the meridian m around and a longitude remark 4 the assumption 1 t 1 m holds in every application that we are interested in however the assumption is not necessary everything done below can be easily modified if a longitude 7 1 in 1 m suppose n has a projective structure with cone like singularity let d t rp 3 be the developing map on a chosen lift t of t and let 1 t pgl 4 r be the holonomy using proposition 6 we can construct convenient coordinates r x y 0 1 r r for t with the following properties the action of 1 t by deck translations is given by m r x y 7 r x 1 y r x y 7 r x y 1 the limit limr 0 d r x y f y is a local submersion independent of x to a line l in rp 3 the line l represents the lift of corresponding to the chosen lift of t m point wise fixes l and preserves but does not fix l these coordinates will be useful for proving the following proposition proposition 8 suppose t 1 m pgl 4 r is a path of representations such that 1 0 is the holonomy representation of a projective structure with cone like singularities on n let l be the line in rp 3 fixed by 1 m 2 t m point wise fixes a line lt with lt l 25 then for all t sufficiently small t is the holonomy representation for a projective struc ture with cone like singularities on n proof first we let d 0 m rp 3 denote the developing map of our projective structure at time t 0 let m 0 m be the result of removing a smaller tubular neighborhood t t of from m so that m 0 and t overlap in a neighborhood of m 0 by proposition 1 we can deform the projective structure on m 0 to get developing maps dt m 0 rp 3 that are equivariant with respect to t further by the well known proof of the proposition we may assume that dt converges uniformly in the c 1 topology on compacts in m 0 now we must extend dt to the rest of m we may assume by conjugating t in pgl 4 r that t m also fixes l for all t that is we assume lt l in order to define dt on t we will need a quick lemma lemma 2 for each 1 t we can take arbitrary powers t z in a way that depends smoothly on z t proof of lemma first t 1 t psl 4 r so for each 1 t we can find a path g t in psl 4 r with g 0 id and g 1 0 the log function is well defined sufficiently near to the identity and can be defined by analytic continuation along the path g s this amounts to choosing a branch of log for the eigenvalues note that we can not have an odd number of negative real eigenvalues next analytically continue log along the path t thus t z exp z log t depends smoothly on z t next using the coordinates defined above define dt on t as follows dt r x y t m x t y 0 m x 0 yd 0 r x y we check that dt r x k y j t m x k t y j 0 m x k 0 y jd 0 r x k y j t m x k t y j 0 m x k 0 y j 0 m k 0 jd 0 r x y t m x k t y j 0 m x 0 yd 0 r x y t m k t j t m x t y 0 m x 0 yd 0 r x y t m k t jdt r x y so dt satisfies the right equivariance properties next since t m fixes l pointwise we still have that limr 0 dt r x y is independent of x further for small t limr 0 dt r x y will still be a local submersion to l so dt is the developing map for a structure with cone like singularities on a neighborhood of the singular locus further dt converges to d 0 in the c 1 topology in fact in c on compacts of t now the definition of dt on t and the definition of dt on m 0 may not agree on the overlap so we glue these two maps together using a bump function which is supported away from the singular locus finally extend dt to the other lifts of t in m by t equivariance this gives globally defined maps dt m rp 3 which converge in c 1 on compacts to d 0 thus for sufficiently small t the dt are local diffeomorphisms 26 4 4 regeneration of h 3 and ads 3 structures from hp 3 as the class of cone like singularities specializes to cone singularities in the h 3 case tachyons in the ads 3 case and infinitesimal cone singularities in the hp 3 case we get the following regeneration statement immediately from proposition 8 proposition 9 regeneration with cone like singularities let n be a closed three manifold with a knot and let m n with m 1 m the meridian around let x be either x 1 hn or x 1 adsn let t 1 m isom x be a family of representations defined for t 0 such that the path of conjugates rt tr 1 t converges as t 0 in c 1 to a representation hp hp is the holonomy of an hp structure on n with infinitesimal cone singularity along t m is a rotation if x h 3 or a boost if x ads 3 then for sufficiently small t 0 we can construct a family of x structures on n with singularities at for each t the holonomy representation of the smooth part is t and the structures have cone singularities if x h 3 or tachyon singularities if x ads 3 proof the proof is the same as the proof of proposition 4 at time t 0 we have an hp structure with infinitesimal cone singularity we regard this as a projective structure with cone like singularities if x h 3 then t rt tr 1 t is a representation landing in gt isom xt the t limit to hp by proposition 8 there is a family of cone like projective structures very close to the hp structure that realize the t as holonomy for short time the developing maps of these structures map a compact fundamental domain k which includes the singularity to a compact region inside of rp 3 that for small t is very close to the image of k by the developing map of the hp structure thus for all sufficiently small t the image will lie inside of xt ensuring the developing maps define a family of xt gt structures applying the inverse of the rescaling map r 1 t gives a family of x 1 h 3 structures with cone singularities if x ads 3 everything works the same except that t lands in g t and we get x t g t structures that by applying r 1 t are equivalent to ads structures with tachyons this proposition says that we can recover collapsing hyperbolic cone and ads tachyon structures from an hp structure and a suitable path of representations we use this proposition to prove our main regeneration theorem theorem 2 from the introduction as follows we use the condition h 1 1 m so 2 1 ad 0 r to get representations into pso 3 1 and pso 2 2 satisfying the conditions of proposition 9 in the hyperbolic case the proof of this makes use of the complex structure of the variety of pso 3 1 representations coming from the isomorphism pso 3 1 psl 2 c this isomorphism can be generalized to give pgl 2 descriptions of all of the isometry groups gs working with the pgl 2 description of isometry groups allows for the most natural proof of theorem 2 so we take a detour in the next section and give the proof of the theorem in section 4 6 27 4 5 the pgl 2 description of isometry groups in dimension three there is a useful alternative description of the isometry groups gt of our models xt section 3 1 which generalizes the isomorphism pso 3 1 psl 2 c let bs r r s be the real two dimensional commutative algebra generated by a non real element s with 2 s sign s s 2 as a vector space bs is spanned by 1 and s there is a conjugation action a b s a b s which defines a square norm a b s 2 a b s a b s a 2 b 2 2 s r note that 2 may not be positive definite we refer to a as the real part and b as the imaginary part of a b s it easy to check that bs is isomorphic to c when s 0 in the case s 1 we will denote s by the letter it is also easy to check that when s 0 bs is isomorphic to r r in the case s 0 we will denote s by the letter the algebras r r and r r play a central role in the study of ideal triangulations of ads and hp manifolds analogous to the role of the complex numbers in the study of ideal triangulations of hyperbolic manifolds see dan 11 now consider the 2 2 matrices m 2 bs let herm 2 bs a m 2 bs a a denote the 2 2 hermitian matrices where a is the conjugate transpose of a as a real vector space herm 2 bs r 4 we define the following real inner product on herm 2 bs a z z d e w w h 1 2 tr a z z d h w w e the signature of this metric depends on s proposition 10 the region xs in rp 3 defined in section 3 1 can be alternately defined by xs x herm 2 bs x x 0 x x for r where we use the coordinates x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 s x 3 x 4 s x 1 x 2 on herm 2 bs note that x x det x x 21 x 2 2 x 2 3 2 sx 2 4 the ideal boundary xs given by the projectivized light cone with respect to this metric is exactly the projectivized rank one hermitian matrices where for a hermitian matrix x rank one means det x 0 x 6 0 any rank one hermitian matrix x can be decomposed uniquely up to as x vv where v b 2 s is a two dimensional column vector with entries in bs and v denotes the transpose conjugate further v must satisfy that v 0 for bs if and only if 0 this gives the identification x p 1 bs x y x 0 and y 0 for bs 0 where x y x y for b s definition 10 we denote by pgl 2 bs the 2 2 matrices a with entries in bs such that det a 2 0 up to the equivalence a a for any b s 28 note that the condition det a 2 0 is only needed in the case s 0 for s 0 pgl and pgl are the same for s 0 pgl is the same as psl we will think of pgl 2 bs as determinant 1 matrices with entries in bs up to multiplication by a square root of 1 if s 0 there will be four such square roots we note that pgl 2 bs acts by mobius transformations on xs p 1 bs this action extends to all of xs giving a map pgl 2 bs gs isom xs as follows a x axa where x xs and det a 1 proposition 11 for s 6 0 the map pgl 2 bs gs isom xs is an isomorphism note that in the case s 1 this is the usual isomorphism psl 2 c pso 3 1 proof the proof is an easy exercise use the coordinates x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 s x 3 x 4 s x 1 x 2 on herm 2 bs remark 5 in fact the orientation reversing isometries are also described by pgl 2 b acting by x 7 axa note that with the coordinates x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 s x 3 x 4 s x 1 x 2 on herm 2 bs the rescaling map rs x 1 xs defined in section 3 1 corresponds to the algebraic rescaling map as c b 1 bs defined by i 7 s s this observation gives the following proposition proposition 12 for s 0 as defines an isomorphism psl 2 b 1 psl 2 bs which corresponds to the isomorphism g 1 gs given by conjugation by rs psl 2 c as psl 2 bs pso 3 1 rs gs 3 similarly for s 0 the rescaling map rs x 1 xs defined in section 3 1 corresponds to the algebraic rescaling map as b 1 bs defined by 7 s s again we get proposition 13 for s 0 as defines an isomorphism pgl 2 b 1 pgl 2 bs which corresponds to the isomorphism g 1 gs given by conjugation by rs pgl 2 r r as pgl 2 bs pso 2 2 rs gs 4 recall that in the case s 0 the metric on x 0 is degenerate so that the isometries of x 0 ended up being too large to be of use the half pipe group ghp was defined to be a strict subgroup giving a useful structure for the purposes of geometric transitions proposition 14 the map pgl 2 r r g 0 isom x 0 maps pgl 2 r r isomorphically onto g hp 29 proof to begin we think of r r as the cotangent bundle of r the element should be thought of as an infinitesimal quantity whose square is zero similarly pgl 2 r r is the cotangent bundle of pgl 2 r lemma 3 let a b have determinant 1 then deta det a b 1 and tra 1 b 0 in other words b is in the tangent space at a of the matrices of constant determinant 1 any element of herm 2 r r can be expressed uniquely in the form x y where x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 x 2 xt is symmetric and y 0 x 4 x 4 0 y t is skew symmetric then a b x y a b a b x y at bt axat bxat axbt ay at where we note that axat is symmetric and bxat axbt ay at is skew symmetric the symmetric part x 7 axat written in coordinates gives the familiar isomorphism pgl 2 r o 2 1 in x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 coordinates the transformation defined by a b has matrix a 0 v a b c a b the skew symmetric partx y 7 bxat axbt ay at written in x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 coordinates gives the bottom row of this matrix v a b ce df ag bh ce df ag bh cf de ah bg c a b det a det a 1 where a a b c d b e f g h to show that pgl 2 r r g hp is an isomor phism one easily checks that given a the map b v a b is a linear isomorphism to r 3 finally we restate the condition of compatibility to first order equation 2 of sec tion 3 2 in these terms in order to make sense of continuity and limits for paths of representations over the varying algebras bs we can embed all of the bs in a larger clif ford algebra c see dan 11 section 5 4 for our purposes here we assume that s 0 as s 0 in the hyperbolic case proposition 15 let t 1 m g 1 be a path of representations defined for t 0 converging to a representation 0 with image in the subgroup h 0 o 2 1 0 0 1 then the corresponding representations t 1 m pgl 2 c limit to a representation 0 into pgl 2 r suppose further that rt tr 1 t limit to a representation hp then at ta 1 t t 0 hp where hp is the representation into pgl 2 r r corresponding to hp further hp is defined by hp 0 d dt im t t 0 5 30 similarly in the ads case proposition 16 let t 1 m g 1 be a path of representations defined for t 0 converging to a representation 0 with image in the subgroup h 0 o 2 1 0 0 1 then the corresponding representations t 1 m pgl 2 r r limit to a representa tion 0 into pgl 2 r suppose further that rt tr 1 t limit to a representation hp then at ta 1 t t 0 hp where hp is the representation into pgl 2 r r corresponding to hp further hp is defined by hp 0 d dt im t t 0 6 in both propositions equations 5 and 6 are made sense of by choosing for each 1 m a lift of t to gl 2 with constant determinant 1 such that the limit 0 gl 2 r is real 4 6 proof of regeneration theorem we restate theorem 2 in terms of pgl 2 bs isometry groups theorem 3 let n be a closed orientable hp 3 manifold with infinitesimal cone singularity of infinitesimal angle along the knot let m n be the smooth part and let hp 1 m pgl 2 r r be the holonomy representation suppose that the real part 0 of hp satisfies the condition h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad 0 r then there exists singular geometric structures on n parametrized by t which are hyperbolic cone structures with cone angle 2 t for t 0 ads structures with a tachyon of mass t for t 0 proof we begin with a lemma about the representation variety r 1 m pgl 2 r of representations modulo conjugation lemma 4 the condition h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad 0 r guarantees that the representation variety r 1 m pgl 2 r is smooth at 0 proof it is a standard fact that h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad has half dimensional image see for example hk 05 in this case 0 m 1 and 0 is a non trivial translation possibly plus a rotation by so any nearby representation of 1 m preserves an axis so that h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad has dimension equal to two so h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad has dimension at least one for all nearby 0 it follows that 0 is a smooth point of r 1 m pgl 2 r and that the tangent space at 0 is one dimensional let m be a meridian around in the direction consistent with the orientation of so that in particular the discrete rotational part of the holonomy of m is 2 hyperbolic case t 0 in order to use proposition 9 we must produce for t 0 a path of representations t into psl 2 c with the following properties 31 1 t 0 2 t m is a rotation by 2 t 3 rt tr 1 t converges to hp as t 0 by proposition 15 this is equivalent to d dt im t t 0 im hp now our hp representation gives a pgl 2 r tangent vector at 0 as follows hp 0 y define z y 0 1 then z is an sl 2 r ad 0 co cycle it spans the tangent space of r 1 m pgl 2 r as the structure is singular we must have z m 6 0 thus the translation length of m increases or decreases away from zero the complexified variety r 1 m psl 2 c is also smooth at 0 and r 1 m psl 2 c r 1 m psl 2 c is a local immersion at 0 the variety r 1 m psl 2 c has complex dimension 2 lemma 5 the subset s r 1 m psl 2 c m is elliptic is locally a smooth real sub manifold of dimension three the image of r 1 m psl 2 c in r 1 m psl 2 c is transverse to s proof of lemma that s is smooth of dimension three follows immediately from the fact that r 1 m psl 2 c is parameterized near 0 by the complex lengths of m the image of r 1 m psl 2 c in r 1 m psl 2 c is transverse to s because z increases translation length of m away from zero now from the lemma we have that the psl 2 c representations of 1 m with m elliptic near 0 form a smooth real one dimensional manifold the tangent space at 0 is spanned by iz thus the rotation angle of m is changing along this manifold and we can choose t as desired ads case t 0 we obtain from the argument above a path t 1 m pgl 2 r defined in a neighborhood of t 0 with 0 0 d dt t t 0 im hp and z m d dt t m is an infinitesimal translation by along the axis l of 0 we may assume that the axis in h 2 preserved by t m is also l constant now define t 1 m pgl 2 r r by t 1 2 t 1 2 t a quick computation shows that d dt t t 0 d dt t t 0 further t m is a boost around the axis l by hyperbolic angle t so proposition 9 implies the result for t 0 32 5 hyperbolic and ads manifolds that collapse onto the 2 m m triangle orbifold in this section we prove theorem 1 restated here for convenience theorem 1 let m 5 and let s be the hyperbolic structure on the two sphere with three cone points of order 2 m m let n be the unit tangent bundle of s then there exists a knot in n and a continuous path of real projective structures pt on n singular along such that pt is conjugate to a hyperbolic cone structure of cone angle 2 when t 0 or an ads structure with tachyon singularity of mass 0 when t 0 as t 0 the cone angle 2 resp 0 and the hyperbolic geometry resp ads geometry of pt collapses to the surface s there are two steps to prove the theorem first we construct a half pipe structure on n with infinitesimal cone singularity along a circle this construction is explicit and gives a first order approximation of the geometry of the nearly collapsed manifolds in the theorem second we give a simple analysis of the representation variety and apply theorem 2 the methods of this section should be compared contrasted with por 10 in which hyperbolic cone orbifolds that collapse to a hyperbolic polygon are shown to exist 5 1 half pipe geometry in dimension three before getting to the main construction of this section we give some lemmas useful for working with hp geometry in dimension three it will be most convenient to work with the model given in section 4 5 with s 0 recall the algebra r r with 2 0 the half pipe space is given by hp 3 x 0 x y x y m 2 r xt x det x 0 y t y where x y x y for r the diffeomorphism x 0 h 2 r of section 3 4 is given in these coordinates by x y 7 x l 7 where we interpret the symmetric matrices x of positive determinant up to scale as a copy of h 2 in the usual way and the length l along the fiber is defined by the equation y l detx 0 1 1 0 8 we restrict to the identity component of the structure group which is given by g 0 psl 2 r r a b a sl 2 r and b ta sl 2 r 33 the structure group identifies with the tangent bundle t psl 2 r and it will be conve nient to think of elements as having a finite component a psl 2 r and an infinitesimal component a sl 2 r via the isomorphism psl 2 r n sl 2 r g 0 a a 7 a aa where aa ta psl 2 r this is the usual isomorphism gn g tg for a lie group g with lie algebra g t 1 g gotten by left translating vectors from the identity thinking of a sl 2 r as an infinitesimal isometry of h 2 recall that at each point x h 2 we may decompose a into its translational x symmetric and rotational x skew parts a ax sym ax skew 1 2 a xatx 1 1 2 a xatx 1 where the rotational part ax skew is a rotation centered at x of infinitesimal angle rot a x defined by x 1 ax skew x rot a x 0 1 2 1 2 0 the action of an element of g 0 in the fiber direction depends on the rotational part of the infinitesimal part of that element x h 2 p 1 a p l p 1 a p hp 3 figure 13 the action of 1 a on hp 3 when a is an infinitesimal rotation centered at x left or a is an infinitesimal translation along l right lemma 6 the action of a pure infinitesimal 1 a on the point x y x 0 is by translation in the fiber direction by amount equal to the rotational part rot a x of the infinitesimal isometry a at the point x h 2 in the product coordinates 7 1 a x l 7 x l rot a x more generally the action of a aa is given by a aa x l 7 a x l rot a x 34 proof 1 a x y 1 a x y 1 at x y ax xat x y 2 ax skewx x y 2 rot a x x 0 1 2 1 2 0 x x y rot a x det x 0 1 1 0 and the first statement now follows from equation 8 the second more general formula follows easily after left multiplication by a finally we mention two very easy but useful facts lemma 7 infinitesimals in g 0 commute 1 a 1 b 1 b 1 a lemma 8 conjugating an infinitesimal 1 h by k kk only depends on the finite part k of k kk k kk 1 h k kk 1 k 1 h k 1 1 adkh 5 2 building blocks for the unit tangent bundle n we now begin our half pipe geometry construction of the unit tangent bundle n of s the 2 m p p u v r 2 m q q dp dq v r u figure 14 s is constructed by glueing together two pieces sp and sq which are quotients of the regular right angled m gons p and q respectively dp and dq are fundamental domains for the rotational symmetry hyperbolic orbifold surface s can be constructed as follows take two isometric regular right angled m gons p and q let a b psl 2 r be the counter clockwise rotations of order m about the center points p and q of p and q respectively then sp p a and sq q b are isometric monogons each with an order m interior cone point and each having a right angle at its exterior vertex glueing sp and sq together gives the 35 2 m m triangle orbifold s we choose a fundamental domain dp for sp as follows let r be a corner point of p and let u and v be the midpoints of the two edges adjacent to r then we define dp to be the quadrilateral spanned by p u r v as in figure 14 similarly define the fundamental domain dq to be the quadrilateral with vertices q u r v as in the figure now s is constructed by glueing dp to itself via a glueing dq to itself via b and glueing dp to dq identifying the edge r v to rv and the edge r u to ru as in the figure using in each case the unique orientation preserving isometry p q 2 m 2 m dp dq fp fq r p 1 p 2 r 4 r 3 v 3 u 4 r 1 p 3 p 4 m u 2 v 1 v u r 2 q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 v 2 v 4 u 3 u 1 r 4 r 3 r 1 r 2 m r v u figure 15 build n out of two pieces fp and fq next we construct the unit tangent bundle n of s out of two pieces in a similar way these pieces are suitable polyhedral lifts fp and fq of dp and dq to hp 3 first we define fp let a aa be a lift of a to psl 2 r r thinking of as an element of t psl 2 r via the discussion in section 5 1 the infinitesimal part aa of describes the change in the rotation angle of a via the linearization of the usual trace relationship the element m is an infinitesimal rotation of infinitesimal angle m centered at p the fixed point of a then by lemma 6 the action of m on hp 3 is a translation in the fiber above each point x h 2 by amount m cosh d p x where d is the distance function we assume henceforth that 0 so that m translates upward in all fibers now refer to figure 15 for the construction of fp let the lifts p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 of p the lifts r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 of r the lifts v 1 v 3 of v and the lifts u 2 u 4 of 36 u satisfy the following p 3 p 4 p 1 p 2 v 3 u 4 v 1 u 2 p 2 mp 4 p 1 mp 3 r 2 mr 4 r 1 mr 3 u 2 mu 4 v 1 mv 3 r 4 r 3 v 3 are colinear r 2 r 1 v 1 are colinear all vertices of fp are determined by say u 4 r 4 p 4 the bottom of fp consisting of the hyperbolic triangles p 4 u 4 r 4 p 3 r 3 v 3 and the vertical hp 2 quadrilateral p 4 r 4 r 3 p 3 is glued by m to the top of fp consisting of the hyperbolic triangles p 2 u 2 r 2 p 1 r 1 v 1 and the vertical hp 2 quadrilateral p 2 r 2 r 1 p 1 the vertical hp 2 side face p 4 u 4 u 2 p 2 is glued by to the adjacent vertical face p 3 v 3 v 1 p 1 the result is an hp structure on the unit tangent bundle np of sp note that the specific geometry of the bottom and top faces is not important provided that the top is related to the bottom by m similarly to construct fq choose a lift b bb of b such that the infinitesimal change in rotation angle 0 let the lifts q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 of q r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 of r v 2 v 4 of v and u 1 u 3 of u satisfy the following q 3 q 4 q 1 q 2 u 3 v 4 u 1 v 2 q 2 mq 4 q 1 mq 3 r 2 mr 4 r 1 mr 3 u 1 mu 3 v 2 mv 4 r 4 r 3 u 3 are colinear r 2 r 1 u 1 are colinear all vertices of fq are determined by say v 4 r 4 q 4 now the bottom of fq consisting of the hyperbolic triangles q 4 v 4 r 4 q 3 r 3 u 3 and the vertical hp 2 quadrilateral q 4 r 4 r 3 q 3 is glued by m to the top of fp consisting of the hyperbolic triangles q 2 v 2 r 2 q 1 r 1 u 1 and the vertical hp 2 quadrilateral q 2 r 2 r 1 q 1 the vertical hp 2 side face q 4 v 4 v 2 q 2 is glued by to the adjacent vertical face q 3 u 3 u 1 q 1 the result is an hp structure on the unit tangent bundle nq of sq next we attempt to glue together the hp structures np and nq to produce an hp structure on n first of all we need to glue r 2 r 4 v 4 v 2 to r 1 r 3 v 3 v 1 so in particular we need the fiber of fp above a point x of edge rv to have the same length as the fiber of fq above the corresponding point y of edge r v under the glueing in other words the action of m must translate the fiber 1 x the same amount that the action of m translates the fiber 1 y this leads to the equation m cosh d x p m cosh d y q 37 where the second equality follows because d p x d q y by symmetry in fact this condition also ensures that r 1 r 3 v 3 v 1 can be glued to r 2 r 4 v 4 v 2 however even if this is the case glueing np to nq can not give a smooth structure for let g psl r r map r 2 r 4 v 4 v 2 to r 1 r 3 v 3 v 1 note that g is a lift of the map glueing edge r v of dq to edge rv of dp then g mg 1 m is non trivial as g mg 1 is an infinitesimal rotation around g q 6 p where g is the finite part of g hence the corresponding closed curve in n which runs along a generic fiber of np then runs once backwards around a generic fiber of nq passing between np and nq via g has non trivial holonomy since is trivial in 1 n this glueing can not define a smooth hp structure on n the curve encircles an infinitesimal cone singularity in the face r 1 r 3 v 3 v 1 5 2 1 the singular hp structure on n defining equations we add an edge to each of the faces r 2 r 4 v 4 v 2 r 1 r 3 v 3 v 1 r 2 r 4 v 4 v 2 and r 1 r 3 v 3 v 1 so that each quadrilateral is divided into two quadrilaterals stacked vertically there are four glueing maps to be determined ga gb gc gd which glue fq to fp along a b c d respectively as in figure 17 the directed edges in the figure unite after glueing to form a simple closed and oriented curve in n the goal here is to construct an hp structure on n with infinitesimal cone singularity along the first condition we impose is that be totally geodesic and smooth in the glued up manifold in the following equations which we use in the next subsection li refers to the line containing a given line segment as labeled in figure 16 l 1 gah 1 l 2 gah 2 l 4 gah 5 l 2 gdh 2 l 3 gdh 3 l 5 gdh 6 l 4 gbh 4 l 5 gbh 5 l 2 gbh 1 l 5 gch 5 l 6 gch 6 l 3 gch 2 l 4 l 1 l 5 l 2 l 6 l 3 h 1 h 4 h 2 h 5 h 3 h 6 ml 3 l 1 ml 6 l 4 mh 3 h 1 mh 6 h 4 next we must pay special attention to the fiber f above r in fp the vertical edge at the intersection of face a and b or d and c in fp this is the exceptional fiber of order 2 we must check that the hp structure is smooth at points of this fiber not belonging to one of the li the following equations express that the holonomy of any curve encircling such a piece of f is trivial in other words the order 2 exceptional fiber is non singular gag 1 c gd mg 1 b 1 gdg 1 c mgag 1 b 1 gd mg 1 b gag 1 c 1 gag 1 b gdg 1 c m 1 9 next segments of the li become the singular locus after glueing which has one component therefore all curves encircling pieces of the li should be conjugate in a specific way gdg 1 a gcg 1 b 1 gd mg 1 a m gc mg 1 b m 1 gag 1 b gcg 1 a mgc mg 1 b gd mg 1 b mgcg 1 d gcg 1 b 10 38 m m ga gb gc gd l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h 6 figure 16 glueing diagram for the singular structure on n the arrows represent paths crossing through a given face in the manifold each arrow is labeled with the corresponding glueing map note that glueing maps are dual to paths e g the path from fp to fq crossing though face a is dual to the glueing map ga which glues fq to fp along a finally the edges u 4 u 2 v 1 v 3 v 4 v 2 and u 3 u 1 are all identified we must enforce that this artificial edge is non singular in the glued up manifold gb g 1 a 1 gc g 1 d 1 11 next we convert these equations into equations about the holonomy representation of words in the fundamental group the following is a generating set for 1 n gdg 1 a ga g 1 a t gbg 1 a then a quick computation gives that gcg 1 a gcg 1 b gbg 1 a 1 t so we can easily translate any of the above equations into these new letters by inserting g 1 a ga and using the above relations we now transform the equations and reduce first we use either of the equivalent equations 11 to eliminate t t 1 t 1 equations 9 become 2 m 1 1 2 m 1 1 12 39 equations 10 now reduce to one equation the equations on the first line are implied by the above while the two equations of the second line turn out to be equivalent giving 2 m m 13 we demonstrate the derivation of this equation starting from the bottom right equation of 10 gd mg 1 b mgcg 1 d gcg 1 b mt 1 m 1 t 1 1 t t 1 m 1 m 1 1 1 m 1 m 1 1 lemma 7 m m 1 1 m m 1 lemma 8 next we use equations 12 and 13 to derive the relationship between and where refers to the rate of change of the rotation angle for substituting from equation 13 into the lefthand equation of 12 we have m 2 m m 1 m m m m 1 m m m 1 m 2 m 1 m where we note that if k 1 a is an infinitesimal then k 1 1 2 a is well defined now m 1 m and 2 are infinitesimal rotations of h 2 about fixed points q a 1 q and r respectively where recall a is the finite part of note that r is the midpoint of the segment connecting q and a 1 q see figure 17 hence m 1 m is an infinitesimal rotation centered at r with infinitesimal rotation amount cosh d q r m so the equation is satisfied if and only if 2 m cosh d q r similarly the righthand equation of 12 gives 2 m cosh d q r where denotes the rate of change of rotation angle for from 13 we also get the relationship between the infinitesimal cone angle of and the rate of change of rotational parts of the generators note that by lemma 6 the infinitesimal cone angle 40 r q a 1 q d q r d q r p figure 17 r is the midpoint of the segment connecting q to a 1 q is given by the infinitesimal translational part of along the projection of the singular axis to h 2 2 2 m sinh d q r sin 4 2 2 m cot 2 m 1 we have assumed that 0 throughout it is possible to interpret the case 0 as building the same manifolds but with the fiber direction reversed the building blocks in figure 15 turn upside down in this case the infinitesimal rotational part of also changes sign as in the above equation however the infinitesimal cone angle is always negative for if the orientation of the fibers is reversed will encircle the singular locus in the negative direction one should then use 1 to measure the infinitesimal cone angle 5 2 2 placement of the li the last step in the construction of our singular hp structure on n is to determine the exact placement of the lines li on the boundary of the two building blocks for our structure when glued together all li are matched up by the glueing maps and the result must be a closed geodesic in the hp structure with no corners we can deduce the correct geodesic candidate for say l 2 by beginning at a point near l 2 and following once around the singular locus the resulting group element gb 1 mg 1 d 1 1 1 is a longitude of the singular locus and is represented by a translation in hp whose geodesic axis must be l 2 this determines the other li according to the equations in the previous section the hi are also determined once a choice of initial glueing map say ga is made we must check that the axes li are actually arranged as in figure 16 lemma 9 1 l 2 lies strictly in between l 1 and l 3 in the degenerate plane 1 e and does not intersect either 2 l 4 lies strictly in between l 1 and l 2 41 proof by symmetry and we may assume that r r 1 where r is rotation by preserving a degenerate plane containing l 2 as in figure 18 then with notation as in the figure note that w 1 x 2 y 1 z 2 r r 1 z 2 r x 2 rw 1 x 2 z 2 y 1 w 1 l 2 l 1 l 3 l 4 a d b c x 1 r x 3 y 2 z 1 figure 18 diagram for proof of lemma 9 the segment z 2 w 1 therefore has the same signed length as x 2 y 1 so y 1 x 1 z 2 w 1 then has the same signed length as x 2 y 1 so all four segments x 3 y 2 y 2 x 2 x 2 y 1 and y 1 x 1 have the same signed length they must all be nontrivial and positive since x 1 mx 3 x 3 5 3 regeneration in the previous section we showed that there exists an hp structure on n with prescribed infinitesimal cone angle 0 along let m n the following proposition shows that the cohomology condition of theorem 2 is satisfied by our hp structure this will complete the proof of theorem 1 proposition 17 the hp structure on n with infinitesimal cone angle 0 along defined in the previous section is locally and infinitesimally rigid if the infinitesimal cone angle is fixed in particular if 0 z 1 m psl 2 r n sl 2 r is the holonomy representation then h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad 0 r is spanned by z 42 proof all quantities in the construction of the previous section are determined by the choice of one parameter say which is related to by the linear equation 2 m cot 2 m 1 when 0 so the first assertion will follow if we argue that any small change in the geometry corresponds to an hp structure which can still be constructed in the same way any hp structure on n with infinitesimal cone singularity along gives rise via projection to a transversely hyperbolic foliation onn which extends smoothly over the by a theorem from thurston s notes thm 4 9 thu 80 see section 2 6 this transversely hyperbolic foliation must be the same one we started with namely that arising from projection of n onto s because the geometry of s is rigid so the psl 2 r part of the holonomy representation is rigid then we may decompose our perturbed hp structure into two pieces as in figure 16 by cutting the surface s into two pieces and taking the inverse image under the projection as in the beginning of this section this proves the first assertion about local rigidity and infinitesimal rigidity rel the cohomology assertion follows because hp structures are locally parameterized by their holonomy representations which since 0 is rigid are described by the group h 1 1 m sl 2 r ad 0 locally classes z are in 1 1 correspondence with infinitesimal cone angles though note that z and z correspond to the same infinitesimal cone angle a generalization of theorem 1 and the methods of this section to the case of higher genus s may be possible however it is important to note the following obstacle the psl 2 r representation variety will not be smooth in such a case a representation corresponding to a collapse of the three manifold onto a surface s lies on the intersection of two irreducible components the extra one corresponding to deforming the geometry of s as the teichmuller space of s is non trivial in this case in the final section we give an example displaying this phenomenon and some interesting consequences of it 6 an interesting flexibility phenomenon here we will construct examples of transitioning structures for which the underlying hy perbolic and ads structures collapse onto a puncture torus the underlying manifold is the borromean rings complement m with one boundary torus required to be a parabolic cusp and the other two boundary tori filled in with cone tachyon singularities we will see that the so 2 1 representation variety is not smooth at the locus of degenerated struc tures so the existence of a representation level transition is not automatic as a result of the non smoothness we observe that a transitional hp structure on m can be deformed to nearby hp structures that do not regenerate to hyperbolic structures interestingly these nearby hp structures do regenerate to ads structures the geometry can be con structed using ideal tetrahedra and the methods of dan 11 in fact m is the union of eight tetrahedra however for brevity we observe this phenomenon only at the level of representations 43 6 0 1 representation variety consider the three torus t 3 defined by identifying opposite faces of a cube now define m 3 t 3 where are disjoint curves freely homotopic to the generators a b c of 1 t 3 as shown in figure 19 then m is homeomorphic to the complement of the figure 19 we remove the three curves shown in the diagram from the three torus t 3 opposite sides of the cube are identified the resulting manifold m is homeomorphic to the complement of the borromean rings in s 3 borromean rings in s 3 this is stated in hod 86 a presentation for 1 m is given by 1 m a b c a b c c b 1 a 1 we study the representation variety rpar m of representations 1 m psl 2 r up to conjugacy such that a b is parabolic and so c is parabolic with the same fixed point these representations correspond to transversely hyperbolic foliations which are cusped at one boundary component and have dehn surgery type singularities at the other two boundary components see hod 86 let t denote the punctured torus with 1 t a b then 1 t 1 m so that rpar m rpar t the representations of rpar t correspond to hyperbolic punctured tori with a cusp at the puncture a representation 1 t psl 2 r satisfies the parabolic condition if and only if a b are hyperbolic elements with sinh l a 2 sinh l b 2 sin 1 where l a l b are the translation lengths of a b respectively and is the angle between the axes to lift such a representation to a representation of 1 m we must assign c so that the relations of 1 m are satisfied since c must commute with the parabolic a b c is parabolic with the same fixed point let x denote the amount of parabolic translation of c relative to a b so if a b 1 1 0 1 then c 1 x 0 1 it turns out by a nice geometric argument that there are exactly two solutions for x x 0 or x 1 2 sech l a 2 sech l b 2 cot 44 this describes the representation variety rpar rather explicitly as the union of two ir reducible two dimensional components rt and rr the first component rt t for teichmuller consists of the obvious representations with c 1 and a b generat ing a hyperbolic punctured torus group the associated transversely hyperbolic foliations are products with two fillable singularities at and the second component rr r for regenerate describes transversely hyperbolic foliations with more interesting struc ture this component in fact its complexification is the relevant one for regenerating hyperbolic structures note that rt and rr meet transversely exactly at the locus of rectangular punctured tori cot 0 remark 6 if we identify rt with the teichmuller space t 1 1 of the punctured torus then the singular set of rpar given by rt rr is exactly the line of minima for the curves a and b in other words rt rr consists of the representations in rt where there is a relation between the differentials dl a and dl b the relevance of such a relation in the context of regeneration questions is discussed in section 3 17 of hod 86 6 0 2 regenerating 3 d structures fix a particular rectangular punctured torus 0 1 t psl 2 r r and lift 0 to 1 m by setting 0 c 1 this is the only possible lift let v be a tangent vector at 0 tangent to the component rr but transverse to rt for suitably chosen v the representation 0 v 1 m psl 2 r r is the holonomy of a robust hp structure which can be constructed from eight tetrahedra now as the variety rr is smooth the complexified variety rcr is smooth at 0 thus the zariski tangent vector iv is tangent to a path t 1 m psl 2 c which is compatible to first order with 0 v by proposition 4 the hp structure regenerates to a path of hyperbolic structures with holonomy t or alternatively this path of hyperbolic structures can be constructed directly using tetrahedra similarly the variety rr r r is smooth at 0 yielding a path of holonomies t 1 m psl 2 r r with 0 v so that proposition 4 then produces a regeneration to ads structures with holonomy t thus our hp structure is transitional actually in the ads case the representations can be constructed directly let t 1 m psl 2 r be a path with 0 v then a path t of psl 2 r r representations with 0 v is defined by t 1 2 t 1 2 t 6 0 3 an interesting flexibility phenomenon the transitional hp structure from the previous sub section with holonomy 0 v can be deformed in an interesting way by proposition 1 nearby hp structures are determined by nearby holonomy representations we consider a deformation of the form 0 v u where u is a small tangent vector at 0 tangent to the component rt and transverse to rr see figure 20 now r c par m is the union of its irreducible components r c t and rcr locally at 0 so as u and v are tangent to different components of rpar m any zariski tangent vector of the form w i v u for w real is not integrable thus the 45 rr rt u v 0 figure 20 a schematic picture of the psl 2 r representation variety rpar m the variety is the union of two irreducible two dimensional components which meet at the locus of rectangular punctured torus representations with c 1 we let 0 be one such representation with v tangent to one component and u tangent to the other deformed hp structure does not regenerate to hyperbolic structures however it does regenerate to ads structures to see this consider paths t and t with derivatives 2 v and 2 u respectively at t 0 then t 1 2 t 1 2 t gives a family of psl 2 r r representations with 0 v u v u proposition 4 now implies that the deformed hp structure regenerates to ads structures references abb
