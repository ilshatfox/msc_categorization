non orientable lagrangian cobordisms between legendrian knots orsola capovilla searle and lisa traynor abstract in the symplectization of standard contact 3 space r r 3 it is known that an orientable lagrangian cobordism between a leg endrian knot and itself also known as an orientable lagrangian endo cobordism for the legendrian knot must have genus 0 we show that any legendrian knot has a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism and that the crosscap genus of such a non orientable lagrangian en docobordism must be a positive multiple of 4 the more restrictive exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms do not exist for any exactly fillable legendrian knot but do exist for any stabilized legen drian knot moreover the relation defined by exact non orientable la grangian cobordism on the set of stabilized legendrian knots is symmet ric and defines an equivalence relation a contrast to the non symmetric relation defined by orientable lagrangian cobordisms 1 introduction smooth cobordisms are a common object of study in topology motivated by ideas in symplectic field theory 19 lagrangian cobordisms that are cylindrical over legendrian submanifolds outside a compact set have been an active area of research interest throughout this paper we will study lagrangian cobordisms in the symplectization of the standard contact r 3 namely the symplectic manifold r r 3 d et where dz ydx that co incide with the cylinders r respectively r when the r coordinate is sufficiently positive respectively negative our focus will be on non orientable lagrangian cobordisms between legendrian knots and and non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms which are non orientable lagrangian cobordisms with smooth endocobordisms in r r 3 without the lagrangian condition are abundant for any smooth knot k r 3 and an arbitrary j 0 there is a smooth 2 dimensional orientable submanifold m of genus j so that m agrees with the cylinder r k when the r coordinate lies outside an interval t t the analogous statement holds for non orientable m and crosscap genus 1 when j 0 for any legendrian knot it is easy to construct an orientable lagrangian endocobordism of genus 0 namely the trivial la grangian cylinder r in fact with the added lagrangian condition orientable lagrangian endocobordisms must be concordances 1 the number of real projective planes in a connected sum decomposition 1 ar x

orientable lagrangian endocobordisms also exist and have topologi cal restrictions theorem 1 1 for an arbitrary legendrian knot there exists a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism for of crosscap genus g if and only if g 4 z theorem 1 1 is proved in theorem 3 2 and theorem 3 3 the fact that the crosscap genus of a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism must be a positive multiple of 4 follows from a result of audin about the obstruction to the euler characteristic of closed lagrangian submanifolds in r 4 1 it is easy to construct immersed lagrangian endocobordisms the existence of the desired embedded endocobordisms follows from lagrangian surgery as developed for example by polterovich in 35 of special interest are lagrangian cobordisms that satisfy an additional exactness condition exactness is known to be quite restrictive by a foundational result of gromov 28 there are no closed exact lagrangian submanifolds in r 2 n with its standard symplectic structure the non closed trivial lagrangian cylinder r is exact and section 2 describes some general methods to construct exact lagrangian cobordisms in contrast to theorem 1 1 there are some legendrians that do not admit exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms theorem 1 2 there does not exist an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism for any legendrian knot that is exactly orientably or non orientably fillable a legendrian knot is exactly fillable if there exists an exact lagrangian cobordism that is cylindrical over at the positive end and does not inter sect t r 3 for t 0 precise definitions can be found in section 2 theorem 1 2 is proved in section 4 it follows from the seidel isomorphism which relates the topology of a filling to the linearized contact cohomology of the legendrian at the positive end theorem 1 2 implies that on the set of legendrian knots in r 3 that are exactly fillable orientably or not the rela tion defined by exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism is anti reflexive and anti symmetric see corollary 4 2 figure 6 gives some particular ex amples of legendrians that are exactly fillable and thus do not admit exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms many of these examples are maximal tb legendrian representatives of twist and torus knots in fact using the classification results of etnyre and honda 23 and etnyre ng and ve rtesi 24 we show corollary 1 3 let k be the smooth knot type of either a twist knot or a positive torus knot or a negative torus knot of the form t p 2 k for p odd and p 2 k 0 then any maximal tb legendrian representative of k does not have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 3 figure 1 does the max tb legendrian representative of m 819 have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobor dism however stabilized legendrian knots do admit exact non orientable la grangian endocobordisms a legendrian knot is said to be stabilized if after legendrian isotopy a strand contains a zig zag as shown in figure 4 theorem 1 4 for any stabilized legendrian knot and any k z there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism for of crosscap genus 4 k some legendrian knots are neither exactly fillable nor stabilized thus a natural quetion is question 1 5 if a legendrian knot is not exactly fillable and is not stabi lized does it have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism in particular does the legendrian representative of m 819 t 4 3 with maximal tb shown in figure 1 have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism the max tb version of m 819 is not exactly fillable since the upper bound on the tb invariant for all legendrian representatives of m 819 given by the kauffman polynomial is not sharp section 6 for more details and related questions given the existence of exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms for a stabilized legendrian it is natural to ask what legendrian knots can appear as a slice of such an endocobordism the parallel question for orientable lagrangian endocobordisms has been studied in 9 4 12 the non orientable version of this question is closely tied to the question of whether non orientable lagrangian cobordisms define an equivalence re lation on the set of legendrian knots by a result of chantraine 8 it is known that the relation defined on the set of legendrian knots by orientable lagrangian cobordism is not an equivalence relation since symmetry fails in fact the relation defined on the set of stabilized legendrian knots by exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism is symmetric see theorem 5 2 it is then easy to deduce theorem 1 6 on the set of stabilized legendrian knots the relation defined by exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism is an equivalence relation moreover all stabilized legendrian knots are equivalent with respect to this relation 4 o capovilla searle and l traynor 1 3 2 figure 2 the three legendrian reidemeister moves

thank the mellon mays foundation for supporting the first author with a mellon mays undergraduate fellowship this paper grew out of her thesis project 7 2 background in this section we give some basic background on legendrian and la grangian submanifolds 2 1 contact manifolds and legendrian submanifolds below is some basic background on contact manifolds and legendrian knots more infor mation can be found for example in 21 and 22 a contact manifold y is an odd dimensional manifold together with a contact structure which consists of a field of maximally non integrable tangent hyperplanes the standard contact structure on r 3 is the field p ker 0 p for 0 x y z dz ydx a legendrian link is a sub manifold of r 3 diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of circles so that for all p tp p if in addition is connected is a legendrian knot it is common to examine legendrian links from their xz projections known as their front projections a legendrian link will generically have an immersed front projection with semi cubical cusps and no vertical tan gents any such projection can be uniquely lifted to a legendrian link using y dz dx two legendrian links 0 and 1 are equivalent legendrian links if there exists a 1 parameter family of legendrian links t joining 0 and 1 in fact legendrian links 0 1 are equivalent if and only if their front projections are equivalent by planar isotopies that do not introduce vertical tangents and the legendrian reidemeister moves as shown in figure 2 every legendrian knot has a legendrian representative in fact every legendrian knot has an infinite number of different legendrian represen tatives for example figure 3 shows three different oriented legendrians that are all topologically the unknot these unknots can be distinguished non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 5 figure 3 three different legendrian unknots the one with maximal tb invariant of 1 and two others obtained by stabilizations s s figure 4 the positive negative stabilization of an ori ented knot is obtained by introducing a down an up zig zag by classical legendrian invariant numbers the thurston bennequin tb and rotation r these invariants can easily be computed from a front projection see for example 5 the two unknots in the second line of figure 3 are obtained from the one at the top by stabilization in general from an oriented legendrian one can obtain oriented legendrians s the positive negative stabilization s s is obtained by replacing a portion of a strand with a strand that contains a down up zig zag as shown in figure 4 this stabilization procedure will not change the underlying smooth knot type but will decrease the thurston bennequin number by 1 adding an up down zig zag will decrease increase the rotation number by 1 it is possible to move a zig zag to any strand of a legendrian knot 26 for any smooth knot type all legendrian representatives can be represented by a mountain range that records the possible tb and r values many examples of known and conjectured mountain ranges can be found in the legendrian knot atlas of chongchitmate and ng 11 2 2 symplectic manifolds lagrangian submanifolds and lagrangian cobordisms we will now discuss some basic concepts in symplectic ge ometry additional background can be found for example in 32 a symplectic manifold m is an even dimensional manifold together with a 2 form that is closed and non degenerate when is an exact 2 form m d is said to be an exact symplectic manifold a basic example of an exact symplectic manifold is r 4 0 dx 1 dy 1 dx 2 dy 2 the cobordisms constructed in this paper live inside the symplectic manifold that is constructed as the symplectization of r 3 0 ker 0 namely r r 3 6 o capovilla searle and l traynor with symplectic form given by d et 0 in fact the symplectization r r 3 is exactly symplectically equivalent to the standard r 4 0 see for example 6 a lagrangian submanifold l of a 4 dimensional symplectic manifold m is a 2 dimensional submanifold so that l 0 when m is an exact symplectic manifold d l is necessarily a closed 1 form when in addition l is an exact 1 form l df then l is said to be an exact lagrangian submanifold remark 2 1 there is a non exact lagrangian torus in the standard sym plectic r 4 this can be seen as the product of two embedded circles in each of the x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 planes by classical algebraic topology it fol lows that the torus is the only compact orientable surface that admits a lagrangian embedding into r 4 3 we will focus on non compact lagrangians that are cylindrical over leg endrians definition 2 1 let be legendrian links in r 3 1 a lagrangian submanifold without boundary l r r 3 is a la grangian cobordism from to if it is of the form l t l t for some t t where l t t r 3 is compact with bound ary l t t 2 a lagrangian cobordism from to is orientable resp non orientable if l is orientable resp non orientable 3 a lagrangian cobordism from to is exact if l is exact namely et 0 l df l and the primitive f is constant on the cylin drical ends there exists constants c so that f l t r 3 c f l t r 3 c a legendrian knot is exactly fillable if there exists an exact la grangian cobordism from to an important property of lagrangian cobordisms is that they can be stacked composed lemma 2 2 stacking cobordisms 17 if l 12 is an exact lagrangian cobordism from 1 to 2 and l 23 is an exact lagrangian cobordism from 2 to 3 then there exists an exact lagrangian cobordism l 13 from 1 to 3 constructions of exact lagrangian cobordisms are an active area of re search in this paper we will use the fact that there exist exact lagrangian cobordisms between legendrians related by isotopy and surgery the exis tence of exact lagrangian cobordisms from isotopy is well known see for example 20 8 17 and 6 non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 7 figure 5 orientable and non orientable legendrian surgeries lemma 2 3 exact cobordisms from isotopy suppose that and are isotopic legendrian knots then there exists an exact orientable lagrangian cobordism from to remark 2 2 in general the trace of a legendrian isotopy is not a lagrangian cobordism however it is possible to add a correction term so that it will be lagrangian more precisely let t u x t u y t u z t u t r be a legendrian isotopy so that t t u has compact support with im t u for t t and im t u for t t and let t u 0 t t u then t u t x t u y t u z t u t u is an exact lagrangian immersion if t u is sufficiently small which can be guaranteed by making t sufficiently large then t u is an exact lagrangian embedding in addition legendrians and that differ by surgery can be con nected by an exact lagrangian cobordism the 0 surgery operation can be viewed as a tangle surgery the replacement of a legendrian 0 tangle consisting of two strands with no crossings and no cusps with a legendrian tangle consisting of two strands that each have 1 cusp and no crossings see figure 5 when the strands of the 0 tangle are oppositely oriented this is an orientable surgery otherwise this is a non orientable surgery in addition by an index 1 surgery it is known that the maximal tb legendrian representative of the unknot shown at the top of figure 3 can be filled lemma 2 4 exact cobordisms from surgery 17 14 6 1 suppose that and are legendrian knots where is obtained from by orientable non orientable surgery as shown in figure 5 then there exists an exact orientable non orientable lagrangian cobor dism from to 2 suppose is the legendrian unknot with tb equal to the maximum value of 1 then there exists an exact orientable lagrangian filling of remark 2 3 by lemmas 2 3 and 2 4 to show there exists an exact la grangian cobordism from to it suffices to show that there is a string of legendrian links 0 1 n where each i 1 is ob tained from i by a single surgery as shown in figure 5 and legendrian 8 o capovilla searle and l traynor isotopy in the case where each surgery is orientable the exact lagrangian cobordism will be orientable in this case the length n of this string must be even and will agree with twice the genus of the lagrangian cobordism for more details see 5 if there is at least one non orientable surgery the ex act lagrangian cobordism will be non orientable and the length of the string agrees with the crosscap genus of the lagrangian cobordism to construct an exact lagrangian filling of it suffices to construct such a string to u where u is a trivial link of maximal tb legendrian unknots 3 constructions of non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms in this section we show that any legendrian knot has a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism with crosscap genus an arbitrary multiple of 4 we then show that it is not possible to get any other crosscap genera the strategy to show existence is to first construct an immersed orientable lagrangian cobordism and then apply lagrangian surgery to modify it so that it is embedded the following description of lagrangian surgery follows polterovich s construction 35 see also work of lalonde and sikorav 30 to state lagrangian surgery precisely we first need to explain the index of a double point suppose that x is a point of self intersection of a generic immersed oriented 2 dimensional submanifold l of r 4 then ind x 1 will denote the index of self intersection of l at x let v 1 v 2 and w 1 w 2 be positively oriented bases of the transverse tangent spaces at x then ind x 1 v 1 v 2 w 1 w 2 is a positively oriented basis of r 4 and otherwise ind x 1 by constructing a lagrangian handle in a darboux chart it is possible to remove double points of a lagrangian lemma 3 1 lagrangian surgery 35 let be a 2 dimensional manifold suppose r 4 is a lagrangian immersion and u r 4 contains a single transversal double point x of then there exists a 2 dimensional manifold which is obtained by a morse surgery on and a lagrangian immersion r 4 so that 1 im im on r 4 u 2 has no double points in u furthermore let 1 x p 1 p 2 then 1 if p 1 p 2 are in disjoint components of then is obtained from by a connect sum operation 2 if p 1 p 2 are in the same component of then a if is not oriented k b if is oriented then t when ind x 1 and k when ind x 1 where k denotes the klein bottle and t denotes the torus non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 9 we now have the necessary background to show the existence of a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism for any legendrian knot theorem 3 2 for any legendrian knot and any k z there exists a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism for of crosscap genus 4 k proof for an arbitrary legendrian knot begin with cylindrical lagrangian cobordism l r r r 3 which is a space that is symplectically equivalent to the standard r 4 as explained in remark 2 1 there exists an embedded lagrangian torus t so that t l after a suitable shift and perturbation we can assume that l and t intersect at exactly two points x 1 and x 2 where ind x 1 1 and ind x 2 1 by lemma 2 4 lagrangian surgery at x 1 results in the connected oriented immersed la grangian diffeomorphic to r s 1 t with a double point at x 2 of index 1 a second lagrangian surgery at x 2 results in a embedded non orientable lagrangian cobordism diffeomorphic to r s 1 t k and thus of cross cap genus 4 stacking these endocobordisms using lemma 2 2 produces an embedded non orientable lagrangian cobordism of crosscap genus 4 k for any k z in fact the possible crosscap genera that appeared in theorem 3 2 are all that can exist theorem 3 3 any non orientable lagrangian endocobordism in r r 3 must have crosscap genus 4 k for some k z this crosscap genus restriction is closely tied to euler characteristic ob structions for compact non orientable submanifolds that admit lagrangian embeddings in r 4 0 or equivalently in r r 3 d et lemma 3 4 audin 1 any compact non orientable lagrangian sub manifold of r r 3 has an euler characteristic divisible by 4 this result can be seen as an extension of a formula of whitney that relates the number of double points of a smooth immersion to the euler characteristic of the normal bundle of the immersion and thus of the tangent bundle of a lagrangian immersion see 1 3 remark 3 1 lemma 3 4 implies that any compact non orientable la grangian submanifold l in r r 3 has crosscap genus 2 4 j for some j 0 there are explicit constructions of compact non orientable lagrangian sub manifolds of crosscap genus 2 4 j for all j 0 27 2 it has been shown that there is no embedded lagrangian klein bottle j 0 33 39 to utilize the crosscap genus restrictions for compact lagrangians we will employ the following lemma which shows that for any lagrangian endo cobordism it is possible to construct a compact non orientable lagrangian submanifold into which we can glue the compact portion of a lagrangian endocobordism 10 o capovilla searle and l traynor lemma 3 5 for any legendrian knot r 3 any open set d r 3 containing and any t r there exists a compact non orientable la grangian submanifold l in r r 3 so that l t t d t t proof the strategy will be to construct a lagrangian immersion of the torus thought of as two finite cylinders with top and bottom circles identi fied and then apply lagrangian surgery to remove the immersion points as a first step we construct non disjoint lagrangian embeddings of two cylin ders via legendrian isotopies lemma 2 3 namely start with two disjoint copies of in d and a translated version r 3 d now for t 0 t 2 consider legendrian isotopies t of and t of that satisfy the following conditions t for all t 0 t 2 t for t 0 t 1 and then for t t 1 t 2 t is a legendrian isotopy of so that t 2 t 2 by repeating an analogous procedure for t t 2 0 we can obtain a smooth immersion of the torus into t 2 t 2 r 3 the arguments used to prove lemma 2 3 see remark 2 2 show that for sufficiently large t 2 the image of the trace of these isotopies can be perturbed to two non disjoint em bedded lagrangian cylinders that do not have any intersection points in t 1 t 1 r 3 then by applying lagrangian surgery lemma 2 4 at each double point we get a compact non orientable lagrangian submanifold l in r r 3 with the desired properties we are now ready to prove the crosscap genus restriction for arbitrary non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms proof of theorem 3 3 let c be a non orientable langrangian endocobor dism suppose c r d and c agrees with standard cylinder outside t t r 3 by lemma 3 5 there is a compact non orientable lagrangian submanifold l in r r 3 so that l t t d t t let l be the lagrangian submanifold obtained by removing the standard cylindrical portion of l in t t d and replacing it with c t t r 3 then l will be a compact non orientable lagrangian submanifold whose crosscap genus k l differs from the crosscap genus of l k l by the crosscap genus of c k c k l k l k c by lemma 3 4 there exist j j z so that k l 2 4 j and k l 2 4 j thus we find that the crosscap genus of c k c must be divisible by 4 remark 3 2 for exact lagrangian cobordisms that are constructed from isotopy and surgery lemmas 2 3 and 2 4 it is possible to show that the crosscap genus must be a multiple of 4 by an alternate argument that relies on a careful analysis of the possible changes to tb under surgery 7 non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 11 4 obstructions to exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms we will now begin to focus on exact non orientable lagrangian cobor disms in this section we will prove theorem 1 2 which states that any leg endrian knot that is exactly fillable does not have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism the proof of this theorem will involve applying the seidel isomorphism which relates the the topology of a filling to the linearized legendrian contact cohomology of the legendrian at the positive end we will then apply theorem 1 2 and give examples of maximal tb legendrian knots that do not have exact non orientable lagrangian endo cobordisms we begin with a brief description of legendrian contact homology addi tonal background information can be found for example in 22 legendrian contact homology is a floer type invariant of a legendrian submanifold that lies within eliashberg givental and hofer s symplectic field theory frame work 18 19 10 it is possible to associate to a legendrian submanifold r 3 the stable tame isomorphism class of an associative differential graded algebra dga a the algebra is freely generated by the reeb chords of and is graded using a maslov index the differential comes from counting pseudo holomorphic curves in the symplectization of r 3 for our interests we will always use z 2 coefficients legendrian contact homology namely the homology of a is a legendrian invariant of in general it is difficult to extract information directly from the legen drian contact homology an important computational technique arises from the existence of augmentations of the dga an augmentation of a is a differential algebra homomorphism a z 2 0 a graded augmentation is an augmentation so that is supported on elements of de gree 0 observe that for any legendrian there are only a finite number of augmentations given a graded augmentation one can linearize a to a finite dimensional differential graded complex a and obtain linearized contact homology denoted lch z 2 and its dual lin earized contact cohomology lch z 2 the set of all linearized co homology groups with respect to all possible graded augmentations is an invariant of if the augmenation is ungraded one can still examine the rank of the non graded linearized co homology dimlch z 2 and obtain as an invariant of the set of ranks of this total linearized co homology for all possible augmentations examining ungraded linearized co homology is not an effective invariant of the many examples of legen drians knots in the legendrian knot atlas of chongchitmate and ng 11 that have the same classical invariants yet can be distinguished through graded linearized homology none of these can be distinguished by examin ing ungraded homology however ungraded co homology will be useful in arguments below 12 o capovilla searle and l traynor ekholm 15 has shown that an exact lagrangian filling f of a legen drian submanifold r 3 induces an augmentation f of a when this filling has maslov class 0 the augmentation will be graded the following result of seidel will play a central role in showing obstruc tions to exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms a proof of this result was sketched by ekholm in 16 and given in detail in dimitroglou rizell 13 a parallel result using generating family homology is given in 38 theorem 4 1 seidel isomorphism 16 13 17 let r 3 legendrian submanifold with an exact lagrangian filling f let f denote the augmen tation induced by the filling then dimh f z 2 dimlch f z 2 if the filling f of the n dimensional legendrian has maslov class 0 then a graded version of the above equality holds dimhn f z 2 dimlch f z 2 the ungraded version of the seidel isomorphism will be used to prove that any legendrian that is exactly fillable does not have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism proof of theorem 1 2 for a contradiction suppose that there is a leg endrian knot that has an exact lagrangian filling and an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism then by stacking the endocobor disms lemma 2 2 it follows that has an infinite number of topologically distinct exact non orientable lagrangian fillings each of these exact la grangian fillings induces an augmentation since there are only a finite number of possible augmentations there must exist two topologically dis tinct fillings that induce the same augmentation however this gives a contradiction to the seidel isomorphism theorem 4 1 theorem 1 2 implies that on the set of legendrian knots in r 3 that are ex actly fillable orientably or not the relation defined by exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism is anti reflexive thus by stacking lemma 2 2 we immediately also see corollary 4 2 on the set of legendrian knots in r 3 that are exactly fillable orientably or not the relation defined by exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism is anti symmetric 1 2 2 6 1 we now apply theorem 1 2 to give examples of legendrians that do not have exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms hayden and sabloff 29 showed that every positive knot type has a legendrian rep resentative that has an exact orientable lagrangian filling in addition lipman reinoso and sabloff have shown that every 2 bridge knot and ev ery adequate knot has a legendrian representative with an exact filling 31 combining this with theorem 1 2 immediately gives non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 13 a b c d e f g figure 6 examples of legendrians that do not have ex act non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms maximal tb representatives of a m 31 t 3 2 k 2 b 31 t 3 2 k

handed twists if m 0 notice that k 0 and k 1 are unknots corollary 4 3 29 31 each positive knot 2 bridge knot and adequate knot has a legendrian representative that does not have an exact non orientable langrangian endocobordism many maximal tb representatives of low crossing have fillings orientable or not figure 6 illustrates some legendrians that can be verified to have exact lagrangian fillings see remark 2 3 many of the examples in figure 6 are legendrian representatives of twist or torus knots using theorem 1 2 together with classification results of etnyre and honda 23 and etnyre ng and ve rtesi 24 we show that all maximal tb represenatives of twist knots positive torus knots and negative torus knots of the form t p 2 k p 2 k 0 do not have exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms proof of corollary 1 3 by theorem 1 2 to show the non existence of an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism it suffices to show the ex istence of an exact lagrangian filling first consider the case where is a maximal tb representative of a twist knot whose form is shown in figure 7 etnyre ng and ve rtesi have classified all legendrian twist knots 24 every maximal tb legendrian 14 o capovilla searle and l traynor m 2 a b figure 8 any maximal tb legendrian representative of a negative twist knot km with m 2 is legendrian isotopic to one of the form in a where the box contains m 2 half twists each of form s as shown in or of form z as shown in b two surgeries produces a max tb legendrian unknot m a b figure 9 any maximal tb legendrian representative of a positive twist knot km with m 1 is legendrian isotopic to one of the form in a where the box contains m half twists each of form x as shown in b m a b figure 10 an inductive argument shows that every max tb representative of a positive twist knot has an exact la grangian filling representative of km for m 2 is legendrian isotopic to one of the form in figure 8 and every maximal tb legendrian representative of km for m 1 is legendrian isotopic to one of the form in figure 9 for a max tb representative of a negative twist knot figure 8 illustrates the two surgeries that show the existence of an exact lagrangian filling for a max tb legendrian representative of a positive twist knot the existence of an exact filling can be shown by an induction argument figure 10 a indicates surgery point when m 1 for all m 1 a maximal tb representative of km 1 can be reduced to a maximal tb representative of km by one surgery as indicated in figure 10 b next consider maximal tb legendrian representatives of a torus knot a knot that can be smoothly isotoped so that it lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in r 3 every torus knot can be specified by a pair p q of coprime integers we will use the convention that the p q torus knot t p q winds p times around a meridonal curve of the torus and q times non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 15 figure 11 surgeries that result in an exact filling of the maximal tb representative of the positive torus knot t 5 3 e n 1 b n b 2 b figure 12 the general form of a maximal tb representative of a negative torus knot t p 2 k with p 2 k 0 with k 2 and p 1 n 1 n 2 2 k e k surgeries produce a trivial legendrian link of maximal tb unknots in the longitudinal direction in fact t p q is equivalent to t q p and to t p q we will always assume that p q 2 since we are interested in non trivial torus knots etnyre and honda 23 showed there is a unique maximal tb represen tative of a positive torus knot t p q with p 0 the surgeries used in 5 theorem 4 2 show that each maximal representative is exactly fillable figure 11 illustrates the orientable surgeries for 5 3 torus knot in this sequence of surgeries one begins with surgeries on the innermost strands and then performs a legendrian isotopy so that it is possible to do a surgery on the next set of innermost strands lastly consider the case where is topologically a negative torus knot t p 2 k with p 2 k 0 in this case etnyre and honda have shown that the number of different maximal tb legendrian representations depends on the divisibility of p by 2 k if p m 2 k e 0 e 2 k there are m non oriented legendrian representatives of t p 2 k with maximal tb these different representatives with maximal tb are obtained by writing m 1 n 1 n 2 where n 1 n 2 0 and then n 1 n 2 is constructed using the form shown in figure 12 with n 1 and n 2 copies of the tangle b inserted as indicated this figure also shows k surgeries that guarantee the existence of an exact lagrangian filling some comments on obstructions to exact fillings are discussed in section 6 16 o capovilla searle and l traynor a b figure 13 via isotopy and surgeries at least one of which is non orientable it is possible to construct exact non orientable lagrangian cobordisms between a and s s b s s and s or s 5 constructions of exact non orientable lagrangian cobordisms in this section we will construct an exact non orientable lagrangian en docobordisms of crosscap genus 4 for any stabilized legendrian knot and a non orientable lagrangian cobordism between any two stabilized legen drian knots all these exact lagrangian cobordisms are constructed through isotopy and surgery see remark 2 3 central to these constructions will be the following lemma which says that with respect to either orientation on one can always introduce a pair of oppositely oriented zig zags and if one has a pair of oppositely oriented zig zags in then one can remove either element of this pair see figure 13 lemma 5 1 let be any oriented legendrian knot then there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism 1 of crosscap genus 2 between and s s 2 of crosscap genus 1 between s s and s or s remark 5 1 with non orientable cobordisms given an orientation on there is no canonical orientations for in lemma 5 1 an orientation on is chosen so that there are well defined s and s but the statement implies that can be s s s or s with either orientation proof the strategy will be to construct the desired exact non orientable la grangian cobordism via legendrian isotopy and surgeries that are performed on a portion of a strand figure 14 illustrates the isotopy and surgeries the second of which is non orientable that implies the existence of a cross cap genus 2 lagrangian cobordism between and s s figure 15 illustrates the isotopy and surgery that implies the existence of a crosscap genus 1 lagrangian cobordism between s s and non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 17 figure 14 by applying an orientable and a non orientable surgery any strand can have a pair of oppositely oriented zig zags introduced figure 15 in the presence of oppositely oriented zig zags via one non orientable surgery one of the zig zags can be removed s when the original strand is oriented from right to left or to s when the original strand is oriented from left to right 5 1 exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms in the orem 1 2 it was shown that legendrians that are exactly fillable do not have exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms however exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms do exist for stabilized knots proof of theorem 1 4 first consider the case where is the negative sta bilization of a legendrian s then by applying lemma 5 1 there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism 1 of crosscap genus 2 between and s s 2 of crosscap genus 1 between s s and s 3 of crosscap genus 1 between s s s and s stacking these cobordisms results in an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism of crosscap genus 4 additional stacking results in arbitrary multiples of crosscap genus 4 an analogous argument proves the case where is the positive stabiliza tion of a legendrian s 5 2 exact non orientable lagrangian cobordisms between sta bilized legendrians given that every stabilized legedendrian knot has a non orientable lagrangian endocobordism a natural question is what legendrian knots can appear as a slice of such an endocobordism in this section we show that any stabilized legendrian knot can appear as such a slice theorem 5 2 for smooth knot types k k let be any legendrian rep resentative of k and let be a stabilized legendrian representative of k 18 o capovilla searle and l traynor then there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between and before moving to the proof of theorem 5 2 we show that non orientable lagrangian cobordisms define an equivalence relation on the set of stabilized legendrian knots proof of theorem 1 6 let ls denote the set of all stabilized legendrian knots of any smooth knot type define the relation on ls by 1 2 if there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism from 1 to 2 reflexivity of follows from theorem 1 4 symmetry of follows from theorem 5 2 transitivity of follows from lemma 2 2 thus defines an equivalence relation moreover by theorem 5 2 we see that with respect to this equivalence relation there is only one equivalence class to prove theorem 5 2 it will be useful to first show that there is an exact non oriented lagrangian cobordism between any two stabilized legendrians of a fixed knot type proposition 5 3 let k be any smooth knot type and let be legen drian representatives of k where is stabilized then there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between and proof fix a smooth knot type k and let 1 2 be legendrian represen tatives where 2 is stabilized by results of fuchs and tabachnikov 26 we know that there exists r 1 1 r 2 2 so that s 1 s r 1 1 s 2 s r 2 2 by applying additional positive stabilizations if needed we can assume r 1 1 consider the case where 2 is the negative stabilization of some legen drian 2 s 2 by applications of lemma 5 1 there exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between 1 1 and s r 1 s r 1 1 2 sr 1 s r 1 1 and s 1 s r 1 1 and thus between s r 1 s r 1 1 and s 2 s r 2 2 3 s 2 s r 2 2 and s r 2 2 4 sr 2 2 s r 2 s 2 and s 2 2 by stacking these cobordisms lemma 2 2 we have our desired exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between 1 and 2 an analogous argu ment proves the case where 2 is the positive stabilization of some legen drian proof of theorem 5 2 the strategy here is to first show that one can con struct an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between and a sta bilized legendrian unknot 0 similarly it is possible to construct an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between and a stabilized legen drian unknot 0 we will show it is possible to reverse this sequence of surgeries and construct an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism be tween 0 and which is a stabilization of by proposition 5 3 there non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 19 exists an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between 0 and 0 and between and thus by stacking we will have the desired exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between and we first show how it is possible to construct an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism from to a legendrian unknot cf 5 let be an arbitrary stabilized legendrian knot we can assume that has at least one positive crossing by if necessary applying a legendrian reidemeister 1 move as shown in figure 16 performing an orientable or non orientable surgery near a crossing produces a crossing that can be removed through legendrian reidmeister moves perform such a surgery on every crossing in until you have obtained k disjoint stabilized legendrian unknots since has at least one positive crossing we have performed at least one non orientable surgery align the k legendrian unknots vertically and perform orientable or non orientable surgeries so that we obtain a single stabilized legendrian unknot 0 in this way we have constructed an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism between and 0 figure 16 for any legendrian knot perform a surgery near each crossing in order to get a disjoint set of legendrian unknots figure 17 surgeries used to convert to a link of legen drian unknots can be undone at the cost of additional stabilizations a similar procedure can be used to construct a sequence of surgeries from to another legnedrian unknot 0 now we show it is possible to reverse this procedure and construct a sequence of surgeries from 0 to a legendrian obtained by applying stabilizations to figure 17 illustrates how every surgery that was used to get to a legendrian unknot can be undone at the cost of adding additional zig zags into the original strands figure 18 illustrates this procedure in a particular example as outlined at the beginning at the proof these constructions prove the existence of an exact lagrangian cobordism from to 20 o capovilla searle and l traynor a b figure 18 a surgeries that give rise to an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism from the max tb version of 31 to a stabilized unknot b surgeries that give rise to an exact non orientable lagrangian cobordism from the stabilized unknot to a stabilized representative of 31 6 additional questions we end with a brief discussion of some additional questions from results above we know that exactly fillable legendrian knots do not admit exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms while stabilized legendrian knots do there are examples of legendrian knots that are neither exactly fillable nor stabilized as mentioned above ekholm 15 has shown that if is exactly fillable then there exists an ungraded augmention of a by work of sabloff 37 and independently fuchs and ishkhanov 25 we then know that there exists an ungraded ruling of then it follows by work of rutherford 36 that the kauffman bound on the maximal tb value for all legendrian representatives of the smooth knot type of is sharp thus if the kauffman bound is not sharp for the smooth knot type k then no legendrian representative of k is exactly fillable question 6 1 if is a maximal tb representative of a knot type k for which the upper bound on tb for all legendrian representatives given by the kauffman polynomial is not sharp does have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobordism the legendrian representative of m 819 mentioned in question 1 5 satisfies the hypothesis in question 6 1 a list of some additional smooth knot types where the kauffman bound is not sharp can be found in 34 section 4 there are also examples of legendrians with non maximal tb that are not stabilized for example m 10161 is a knot type where the unique maximal tb representative has a filling however there are legendrian representatives non orientable lagrangian endocobordisms 21 with non maximal tb that do not arise as a stabilization as shown in 40 figure 1 this legendrian does have an ungraded ruling question 6 2 does the non stabilized non maximal tb legendrian repre sentative of m 10161 have an exact non orientable lagrangian endocobor dism additional examples of non stabilized and non maximal tb representatives can be found in the legendrian knot atlas of chongchitmate and ng 11 there are additional questions that arise from the constructions of fillings for example it is known by results of chantraine 8 that orientable fillings realize the smooth 4 ball genus in figure 6 examples are given of non orientable lagrangian fillings of maximal tb representatives of 62 and m 62 of crosscap genus 2 and 4 the smooth 4 dimensional crosscap number of both 62 and m 62 is 1 question 6 3 does there exist a non orientable lagrangian filling of these legendrian representatives of 62 and m 62 of crosscap genus 1 references 1 m audin fibre s normal d immersions en dimension double points double d immersions lagrangiennes et plongements totalement re els comment math hel vetici 63 1988 593 623
