primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots jae choon cha abstract we address primary decomposition conjectures for knot concordance groups which predict direct sum decompositions into primary parts we show that the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots has a large subgroup for which the conjectures are true and there are infinitely many primary parts each of which has infinite rank this supports the conjectures for topologically slice knots we also prove analogues for the associated graded groups of the bipolar filtration of topologically slice knots among ingredients of the proof we use amenable l 2 signatures ozsva th szabo d invariants and ne methi s result on heegaard floer homology of seifert 3 manifolds in an appendix we present a general formulation of the notion of primary decomposition 1 introduction and main results it is a major open problem to classify knots in 3 space modulo concordance our understanding is far from complete for both topological and smooth knot concordance groups the sophistication of the smooth case beyond topological concordance is measured by the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots which has been actively investigated using modern smooth techniques in the study of knot concordance the notion of primary decomposition first ap peared in jerome levine s foundational work 34 35 briefly he constructed an al gebraic concordance group of seifert matrices and proved that it is isomorphic to the knot concordance group in high odd dimensions while it gives algebraic invariants in the classical dimension 35 he proved that a rational coefficient version of the algebraic concordance group decomposes into a direct sum of certain primary parts indexed by irreducible factors of alexander polynomials this plays a crucial role in his well known classification result that the algebraic concordance group and high odd dimensional knot concordance groups are isomorphic to z z 2 z 4 34 for the low dimensional case it is natural to ask whether the classical knot con cordance groups and related objects admit analogous primary decomposition and to study the structures via primary parts in an appendix we formulate a general no tion of primary decomposition which specializes to several specific cases including concordance and rational homology cobordism and discuss related questions we hope this is useful for future study as well the appendix also discusses known earlier results from the viewpoint of the general formulation in particular for topologi cal knot concordance there were remarkable results related to primary decomposi tion 13 14 28 30 36 in this paper we begin a detailed study of the smooth concordance group of topo logically slice knots t via primary decomposition precise statements of our results are given in sections 1 1 and 1 2 below briefly the conjectural primary decompo sitions see question 1 1 are direct sum decompositions along irreducible factors of alexander polynomials of the quotient t where is the subgroup generated by knots with unit alexander polynomials taking the quotient by is along the same lines of ignoring units for factorizations in a ring we show that the conjectures hold for a large subgroup of t and that there are infinitely many primary parts each of which has infinite rank see theorems a and b this provides evidence supporting ar x iv 1 91 0 14 62 9 v 2 m at h g t 3 0 ju n 20 21 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 2 primary decomposition conjectures and in addition reveals a rich structure in t generalizing a result of hedden livingston and ruberman 25 that t has infinite rank in proving this the essential challenge is to find irreducible polynomials t and topologically slice knots whose nontrivial linear combinations are not concordant to any knot whose alexander polynomial is relatively prime to t it appears to be hard if possible at all to do this using known smooth invariants such as those from gauge theory heegaard floer homology and khovanov homology our proof combines amenable l 2 signatures which are key ingredients of recent studies of topological con cordance with smooth information from heegaard floer homology of infinitely many branched covers of a knot it seems intriguing to study whether more recent smooth invariants are useful in understanding primary decomposition motivated from the results and approaches of this paper we also prove results which support primary decomposition conjectures for the bipolar filtration of topologically slice knots see theorems c and d below 1 1 primary decomposition for topologically slice knots in what follows we state primary decomposition conjectures and main results for t for a knot k in s 3 denote the alexander polynomial by k and regard it as an element in the laurent polynomial ring q t 1 then k is well defined up to associates recall that and q t 1 are associates if atk for some a qr 0 and k z the standard involution on q t 1 is defined by ait i ait i we say that and q t 1 are associates if is an associate of either or denote the smooth concordance class of a knot k by k recall that k t k is trivial for an irreducible in q t 1 let t k t k is an associate of k for some k 0 t k t k is relatively prime to we remark that the product in the definition of t reflects the fox milnor con dition that k is an associate of ff for some f q t 1 when k is topologically slice note that t and t are subgroups containing for every irreducible also t t and t t if and are associates primary decomposition for topologically slice knots concerns natural homomor phisms l t t and r t t t here the index of the direct sums varies over the associate classes of irreducibles that arise as the factor of an alexander polynomial of a knot the homomorphism l is defined to be the sum of the inclusions t t since k is a product of finitely many irreducibles the quotient epimorphisms t t t induce a homo morphism into the direct sum which is our r above this formulation is influenced by earlier work in the literature particularly levine 34 35 and cochran harvey and leidy 13 14 an informal remark one might regard elements in t t as primary and t t t as forgetting those coprime to or extracting the primary component of an element then the surjectivity of l means the existence of a decomposition into a sum of primary elements and the injectivity of l means the uniqueness of such a decomposition also the injectivity of r means that primary components determine an element uniquely and the surjectivity of r means that every combination of primary components is realizable primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 3 question 1 1 primary decomposition for topologically slice knots 1 left primary decomposability is l an isomorphism 2 right primary decomposability is r an isomorphism more generally if they are not isomorphisms what are their kernel and cokernel we conjecture an affirmative answer to 2 and that l is injective at the least in any case it appears to be interesting to study t and t t which we call left and right primary parts or primary factors this leads us particularly to the following 3 nontriviality of primary parts are t and t t nonzero for each irreducible that arises as the factor of an alexander polynomial of a knot more generally if they are nontrivial what are the isomorphism types of the primary parts t and t t 4 relationship of left and right primary parts is the composition t t t t an isomorphism we remark that definition a 1 in the appendix generalizes the notion of left and right primary decomposition to a broader context also regarding the relationship of question 1 1 1 and 2 see lemma a 4 in the appendix the first main result of this paper which is given as theorem a below says that there is a large subgroup of t for which the answers to the above questions are af firmative and many primary parts of t are highly nontrivial to state the result we use the following notation for a subgroup s of t and an irreducible q t 1 let s be the subgroup of k s with k a power of and s be the subgroup of k s with gcd k 1 that is s s t and s s t then one can ask question 1 1 for s in place of t let 1 1 m 1 t m m is a positive integer note that is an infinite collection of pairwise non associate irreducibles such that is an alexander polynomial of a knot theorem a there is a subgroup s in t containing which satisfies the following 1 for every s z s s z and the composition s s s s is an isomorphism 2 the inclusions s s induce an isomorphism s s 3 the surjections s s s induce an isomorphism s s s 1 2 z s s s s z t t t t l r from theorem a it follows that each of the primary parts t and t t has a subgroup isomorphic to z for all an immediate consequence is the main result of 25 that t has a subgroup isomorphic to z note that theorem a 1 implies the following theorem b for each there is an infinite collection of topologically slice knots k i i 1 with k i a power of such that any nontrivial linear combination of the k i is not smoothly concordant to any knot j with j relatively prime to indeed theorem b is equivalent to theorem a by an elementary formal argument primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 4 proof that theorem b implies theorem a suppose that theorem b holds let s be the subgroup in t which is generated by and the two parameter family k i i n given by theorem b we claim that for each s is equal to the subgroup generated by and the one parameter family k i i n to see this first observe that for irreducibles and which are not associates s s and so the composition 1 3 s s s s is zero if a linear combination j i r i k i j r i z lies in s then for each 6 the image of the linear combination in s s which is represented by i r i k i should be zero by the observation therefore r i 0 for all i and 6 by the conclusion of theorem b that the classes k i are linearly independent in s s this proves the claim fix and temporarily denote by z the free abelian group generated by the collection k i i the assignment k i 7 k i gives rise to an epimorphism z s by the claim since s is generated by k i i and k i 0 in s s for 6 the composition 1 4 z s s s s is surjective moreover by the linear independence of k i in s s 1 4 is an isomorphism from this it follows that both z s and s s s are isomorphisms this shows that theorem a 1 holds since 1 3 is zero for 6 the composition of two horizontal arrows on the top row of 1 2 is the direct sum of the isomorphisms s s s so the top row composition in 1 2 is an isomorphism also the first horizontal arrow in the top row is surjective by the definition of s from this it follows that theorem a 2 and 3 hold 1 2 primary decomposition for the bipolar filtration the method of this paper provides further information on the structure of t to discuss this we consider the bipolar filtration of t which was defined by cochran harvey and horn 11 it is a descending filtration 0 tn t 1 t 0 t where the subgroup tn consists of concordance classes of certain knots called n bipolar see definition 2 1 it is known that various modern smooth invariants vanish for knots in the subgroups t 0 and t 1 but the associated graded groups grn t tn tn 1 are nontrivial for all n 6 11 indeed the abelian group grn t is known to have infinite rank for n 0 15 and for all n 2 6 as an attempt to understand the structure of the filtration we formulate and study the primary decomposition of grn t for an n bipolar knot k denote its class in grn t by k similarly to the case of t for an irreducible element in q t 1 consider the following subgroups of grn t grn t k grn t k k for some k 0 grn t k grn t k is relatively prime to primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 5 also let grn k grn t k is trivial the injections grn t grn grn t grn and the surjections grn t grn grn t grn t induce homo morphisms nl grn t grn grn t grn nr grn t grn grn t grn t the following is an analogue of question 1 1 question 1 2 primary decomposition for the associated graded 1 is nl an isomorphism 2 is nr an isomorphism 3 are grn t grn and grn t grn t nontrivial for every irreducible that arises as a factor of an alexander polynomial of a knot 4 is the following composition an isomorphism grn t grn grn t grn grn t grn t the following result supports affirmative answers similarly to the case of t for a subgroup s in grn t let s s grn t and s s grn t recall that the collection has been defined in 1 1 above theorem c let n 2 then there is a subgroup s in grn t which contains grn such that s grn s grn s s and s grn z s s for every by the same argument as the proof that theorem a is equivalent to theorem b it is seen that theorem c is equivalent to the following statement theorem d let n 2 then for each there are infinitely many topologically slice n bipolar knots k i i 1 2 with k i a power of which are linearly independent in grn t grn t also theorem d implies theorem b indeed if a linear combination i aik i of the knots k i in theorem d is smoothly concordant to a knot l with l relatively prime to then the class l automatically lies in the subgroup tn of t since so are k i and thus l is zero in the quotient grn t grn t it follows that ai 0 for all i by theorem d therefore to obtain theorems a b and c it suffices to prove theorem d the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows sections 2 4 are devoted to the proof of theorem d in the appendix we discuss a general formulation of the notion of primary decomposition ingredients of the proof the proof of the above results uses the ideas of several results in the literature to extract obstructions to smooth concordance we combine the cheeger gromov l 2 invariants or equivalently l 2 signature defects and the ozsva th szabo d invariant defined from heegaard floer homology following the ap proach of 6 which was motivated by earlier work of cochran harvey and horn 11 the amenable signature theorem developed in 3 8 and ozsva th szabo s d invariant inequality for definite 4 manifolds 40 are among the key ingredients we develop and use a localization technique inspired by work of cochran harvey and leidy 13 14 to produce representations of the fundamental group to which our invariants are asso ciated also to compute and estimate d invariants of infinitely many branched covers primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 6 of the infinitely many topologically slice knots in theorems b and d we use ne methi s work 38 on heegaard floer homology of negative definite plumbed 3 manifolds acknowledgements the author is indebted to min hoon kim se goo kim and

partly supported by nrf grant 2019 r 1 a 3 b 2067839 finally the author thanks an anonymous referee for comments which were very helpful in improving the exposition 2 the first step of the proof of theorem d as a preliminary of the proof of theorem d we recall the definition of the bipolar filtration from 11 let m k be the zero framed surgery manifold of a knot k in s 3 definition 2 1 11 definition 5 1 let n 0 be an integer a compact connected 4 manifold v bounded by m k is an n negaton if the following are satisfied 1 the inclusion induces an isomorphism on h 1 m k h 1 v and a merid ian of k normally generates 1 v 2 there are disjointly embedded closed connected surfaces si in v which form a basis for h 2 v and have self intersection 1 or equivalently the normal bundle of si has euler class 1 3 for each i the image of 1 si lies in the nth derived subgroup 1 v n if there is an n negaton bounded by m k then k is called n negative an n positon and an n positive knot are defined by replacing 1 by 1 in condition 2 above a knot k is n bipolar if k is n positive and n negative recall that t is the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots the bipolar filtration tn n 0 of t is defined by tn k t k is n bipolar since an n 1 bipolar knot is n bipolar tn n 0 is a descending filtration it is an open problem whether n 0 tn 0 2 1 construction of a family of knots ki we start the proof of theorem d with a construction of knots which will be shown to generate the promised infinite rank free abelian subgroup fix an integer n 2 as in theorem d also fix another integer m 1 several objects we will use below depend on n m but we omit it from notation since m n is fixed in our arguments let t m t m 1 t m for each n m we will construct an infinite family of knots ki indexed by inte gers i 0 whose alexander polynomial is t t 1 the construction is similar to 6 section 2 2 see also 11 which influenced the construction of 6 and ours let r j d be the knot shown in figure 1 here j and d are knots that will be specified later for now ignore the circles j and d the knot r j d bounds an obviously seen seifert surface of genus one which consists of a 0 handle and two 1 handles in figure 1 the two 1 handles are untwisted and cross each other 2 m 1 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 7 times so s 0 m 1 m 0 is a seifert matrix we remark that 6 and 11 use the particular case of m 1 j d j d 2 m 1 figure 1 the knot r j d since ts st presents the alexander module of r j d a routine computation shows that r j d has integral alexander module 2 1 h 1 m r j d z t 1 z t 1 t z t 1 t 1 and the summands z t 1 t and z t 1 t 1 are equal to the subgroups j and d generated by the loops j and d shown in figure 1 it follows that r j d t t 1 moreover the blanchfield pairing b a a q t q t 1 on the alexander module a h 1 m r j d q t 1 has exactly two metabolizers j and d here a submodule p a is called a metabolizer if p is equal to p x a b p x 0 the above observations on r j d hold for any choice of j and d as another ingredient of the construction of the promised knots ki we will use a family of knots j ik which was given in 6 for k 0 an explicit construction of such j i 0 i is given in 6 section 4 we need that j i 0 i satisfies the following conditions j 1 j 2 and j 3 for some sequence of increasing primes pi for a knot j and an integer p let j z be the levine tristram signature function of j at s 1 c and let 2 2 j zd 1 d d 1 k 0 j e 2 k 1 d j 1 for each i j i 0 is 0 negative j 2 for each i j i 0 zpi 69 713 280 6 n 8 m 86 j 3 for i j j j 0 zpi 0 for k 0 n 2 j ik 1 is defined inductively by j ik 1 pk k j ik where pk k j i k is the satellite knot shown in the right of figure 2 the left of figure 2 shows the pattern pk in the exterior of an unknotted circle k which is a standard solid torus the companion is the knot j ik primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 8 pk k j ik figure 2 the stevedore s pattern pk k and the satellite knot pk k j i k now let ki r j i n 1 d where d wh t is the positive whitehead double of the right handed trefoil t since d is topologically slice 21 ki is topologically concordant tor j in 1 u where u is the trivial knot sincer j u is smoothly slice for any j it follows that ki is topologically slice by 6 section 2 2 lemma 2 3 property j 1 implies each ki is n negative and k positive for all k 0 since ki t t 1 it follows that the class ki lies in grn t tn t tn 1 t therefore to prove theorem d it suffices to show the following statement theorem 2 2 suppose k ri 1 aiki l ai z is a linear combination of the knots ki and a knot l with l t relatively prime to t if ai 6 0 for some i then k is not n 1 bipolar for the special case that l is a trivial knot and m 1 the conclusion of theo rem 2 2 was shown in 6 the general case of theorem 2 2 requires substantially more sophisticated ideas and methods which will be discussed in sections 3 and 4 2 2 construction of a negaton to prove theorem 2 2 by contradiction suppose the knot k is n 1 bipolar recall that ki is n bipolar the following observation will be useful the knot l in the statement of theorem 2 2 is automatically n bipolar since l is concordant to the sum of k a 1 k 1 ar 1 kr 1 and arkr and each of k and ki are n bipolar we may assume ai 6 0 for all i by removing ki when ai 0 in addition by taking k instead of k we may assume that a 1 0 under this assumption we will prove that k is not n 1 negative to derive a contradiction suppose k is n 1 negative as done in 6 section 2 3 we will construct a certain n negaton for the first summand k 1 which we will call x below since the generality of theorem 2 2 does not cause significant issues in this construction we will closely follow 6 with minor additional changes related to l use the n bipolarity of l to choose an n negaton say z l bounded by m l m l use the n bipolarity of ki choose an n negaton z i bounded by m ki m ki for each i for which ai 0 and choose n negaton z i bounded by m ki for each i for which ai 0 let v be an n 1 negaton bounded by m k there is a standard cobordism c bounded by the union of c m k and c i aim ki tm l which is associated with the connected sum expression k ri 1 aiki l c is obtained by attaching to r i 1 aim ki i tm l i n 1 handles that connects the component and then attaching n 2 handles which make meridians of the involved n 1 knots parallel where n i ai a detailed description of c can be found for instance from 17 p 113 define 2 3 x v c c c a 1 1 z 1 t i 1 ai z i t z l figure 3

m l c m k v a 1 1 ar figure 3 the construction of x the sign of m ki equals that of ai now let 2 4 p ker h 1 m k 1 q t 1 h 1 x q t 1 since x is an n negaton with n 2 p is a metabolizer of the blanchfield pairing on h 1 m k 1 q t 1 by 11 theorem 5 8 see also the statement of 6 lemma 2 5 since k 1 r j 1 n 1 d has exactly two metabolizers j and d we have the following two cases p d or p j by deriving a contradiction for each case the proof of theorem 2 2 will be completed 3 l 2 signatures and localized mixed type commutator series in this section we continue the proof of theorem 2 2 for the case p d recall that we constructed an n negaton x in 2 3 using the negatons v z l and z i to obtain a hyperbolic intersection form take the connected sum of the n 1 negaton v and b 2 v copies of cp 2 and call the result v 0 indeed by 11 proposition 5 5 v 0 is a special type of 4 manifold called an integral n 1 solution in 3 definition 3 1 which particularly has a metabolic intersection form over twisted coefficients we do not describe its definition since we do not use it directly but we will state and use its properties later for z l and z i define integral n solutions z 0 l and z 0 i by taking connected sum with copies of cp 2 in the same way repeat the construction of x but now use v 0 z 0 l and z 0 i in place of v z l and z i to obtain a 4 manifold x 0 by the proof of 6 lemma 2 4 b 2 x is equal to the sum of b 2 v b 2 z l a 1 1 b 2 z 1 and ai b 2 z i i 1 thus x 0 x b 2 x cp 2 since x is an n negaton it follows that x 0 is an integral n solution again by 11 proposition 5 5 we will attach additional pieces to x 0 to obtain a sequence of 4 manifolds essen tially following a technique first appeared in 12 see also 3 6 13 14 the notation used below is close to 3 6 consider the satellite construction j 1 k 1 pk k j 1 k due to 12 there is a standard cobordism which we denote by ek from m j 1 k 1 to m j 1 k tm pk for k 0 n 2 in section 3 1 we will use an alternative descrip tion given in figure 4 which illustrates that ek is obtained from m j 1 k 1 0 1 by attaching a 2 handle and a 3 handle start with m j 1 k 1 m pk k j 1 k attach a 2 handle along a zero framed longitude of j 1 k to obtain the second diagram and apply handle slide to obtain the last diagram which is m j 1 k m pk attach a 3 handle to obtain m j 1 k tm pk primary decomposition in the smooth concordance

by the meridian k of k since x is a negaton bounded by m k see definition 2 3 1 by a mayer vietoris argument using this it follows that h 1 xk z for all k 0 n primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 11 3 1 a localized mixed type commutator series associated with x recall from section 2 1 that p 1 denotes the first prime used in properties j 2 and j 3 and t m 1 t m let f t q t 1 f 1 6 0 gcd f t t t 1 1 obviously is a multiplicative subset let q t 1 be the localization definition 3 1 let g be a group endowed with a homomorphism g 1 x which induces an epimorphism h 1 g h 1 x for i 0 1 n 1 define subgroups pig of g inductively as follows let p 0 g g and p 1 g be the kernel of the composition g 1 x h 1 x z t let p 2 g be the kernel of the composition p 1 g p 1 g p 1 g p 1 g p 1 g p 1 g p 1 g z q h 1 g q t 1 h 1 g q t 1 1 h 1 x q t 1 1 h 1 x q t 1 1 imh 1 z 0 l q t 1 1 here imh 1 z 0 l q t 1 1 is the image of h 1 z 0 l q t 1 1 h 1 x q t 1 1 induced by the inclusion for i 2 n 1 let pi 1 g ker pig pig pig pig p ig pig pig z q h 1 g q g pig finally define pn 1 g ker png png png png png png png z zp 1 h 1 g zp 1 g p ng it is straightforward to verify inductively that pkg is a normal subgroup of g and the standard kth derived subgroup g k lies in pkg for all k we remark that the commutator series pkg k in definition 3 1 is localized at polynomials in the sense of 14 sections 3 and 4 and is of mixed coefficient type in the sense that we use both zp 1 and q see 3 section 4 1 in particular define the subgroups pi 1 xk by applying definition 3 1 to the case g 1 xk 1 x the following properties which we will state as assertions a and b are essential for our purpose let k m j 1 k be the meridian of j 1 k by the construction of xk m j 1 k is a component of xk see figure 5 and thus k represents an element in 1 xk for k n 1 for brevity let j 1 n k 1 so that the previous sentence holds for k n as well also let pn 1 n 1 r u d d so that j 1 k pk 1 k 1 j 1 k 1 holds for k n as well assertion a the class of k lies in 1 xk n k pn k 1 xk and is nontrivial in pn k 1 xk p n k 1 1 xk for all k 0 1 n in particular the class 0 is nontrivial in pn 1 x p n 1 1 x assertion b for i 1 n the inclusion induced map sends 1 z 0 l i to the subgroup pi 1 1 x 1 x in particular 1 z 0 l n maps to pn 1 1 x remark 3 2 1 analogues of assertion a for similar situations were established in earlier papers for instance in 3 4 6 12 14 we will give a proof for our case since our series pi is different notably at i 2 from those in the literature assertion b and its application are new to the knowledge of the author primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 12 2 note that both 0 and 1 z 0 l n map to the nth subgroup pn 1 x due to assertions a and b they have opposite nature in the next stage 1 z 0 l n lies in pn 1 1 x while 0 does not this will be crucial in separating the contribution of the unknown knot l from that of k 1 in the linear combination k ri 1 aiki l see section 3 2 particularly the cheeger gromov invariants in 3 3 and 3 8 in the proof of assertion a the following fact will be useful let k 1 be the zero linking longitude of j 1 k 1 which lies in e j 1 k 1 e j 1 k 1 e pk 1 t k 1 e j 1 k m j 1 k xk assertion c the inclusion xk xk 1 induces an isomorphism pi 1 xk k 1 pi 1 xk 1 for all i n k 2 consequently we have pn k 1 1 xk p n k 2 1 xk pn k 1 1 xk 1 pn k 1 1 xk 1 proof of assertion c since ek 1 is obtained by attaching a 2 handle to m j 1 k 0 1 along k 1 and then attaching a 3 handle see figure 4 xk 1 xk ek 1 is obtained from xk by the same handle attachments it follows that 1 xk 1 1 xk k 1 this shows the assertion for i 0 now to proceed by induction suppose i 1 and suppose the assertion holds for i 1 if i 1 we have the following commutative diagram with exact rows pi 1 xk p i 1 1 xk h 1 x pi 1 xk 1 p i 1 1 xk 1 h 1 x since the two rightmost horizontal arrows are to the same target h 1 x there is an induced epimorphism pi 1 xk p i 1 xk 1 and its kernel is equal to that of the epimorphism pi 1 1 xk p i 1 1 xk 1 so the the assertion holds for i 1 for i 2 replace h 1 x in the above diagram by the quotient h 1 x q t 1 1 imh 1 z 0 l q t 1 1 and apply the same argument for i 3 we have pi 1 xk p i 1 1 xk pi 1 1 xk pi 1 1 xk 1 r pi 1 xk 1 p i 1 1 xk 1 pi 1 1 xk 1 pi 1 1 xk 1 1 r where r q or zp 1 depending on i we claim that the rightmost vertical arrow is an isomorphism from the claim it follows that the assertion holds for i once again by the argument used above to show the claim let k 1 be the meridian of j 1 k 1 in the exterior e j 1 k 1 m j 1 k xk note that k 1 is different from the meridian k 1 m j 1 k 1 xk 1 used in the statement of assertion a but k 1 and k 1 are isotopic in the cobordism ek 1 the meridian k 1 is identified with the curve k 1 which lies in the commutator subgroup 1 m j 1 k 1 since 1 m j 1 k is normally generated by the meridian k k 1 lies in k 1 k 1 in 1 xk by induction it follows that k 1 lies in n n k 1 therefore the image of 1 e j 1 k 1 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 13 lies in 1 xk n k 1 since the longitude k 1 lies in 1 e j 1 k 1 1 it follows that 3 1 k 1 1 xk n k 2 since i n k 2 3 1 implies that k 1 1 xk i pi 1 1 xk 1 also by the induction hypothesis pi 1 1 xk p i 1 1 xk 1 is an epimorphism with kernel k 1 it follows that the rightmost vertical arrow in the above diagram is an isomorphism this completes the proof of the assertion proof of assertion a in the proof of assertion c we already showed that k lies in 1 xk n k this is the first part of assertion a it remains to show that k is nontrivial in p n k 1 xk p n k 1 1 xk we will use reverse induction for k n n 1 0 for k n 1 xn p 1 1 xn h 1 x by definition and the meridian n of j 1 n k 1 is a generator of h 1 x so the assertion holds for the case k n 1 let q t 1 for brevity and consider the following commutative diagram h 1 m k 1 h 1 xn 1 h 1 x 1 h 1 x 1 imh 1 z 0 l 1 h 1 xn r z 0 l 1 h 1 x r z 0 l 1 here h 1 xn 1 h 1 x 1 is an isomorphism since 1 x 1 x 0 is isomorphic to 1 xn 0 n 1 by assertion c and the longitudes 0 n 1 lie in 1 xn 2 by 3 1 the same argument shows that the bottom horizontal arrow is an isomorphism alternatively one may use mayer vietoris arguments to show that they are isomorphisms also consider the mayer vietoris sequence for x x r z 0 l m l z 0 l h 1 m l 1 h 1 x r z 0 l 1 h 1 z 0 l 1 h 1 x 1 0 we have h 1 m l 1 0 by the hypothesis that l t is relatively prime to the polynomial t it follows that the diagonal arrow on the right hand side of the above diagram is an isomorphism by our hypothesis the kernel p of j d h 1 m k 1 h 1 xn is equal to the summand d so the other summand j injects into h 1 xn since j is not annihilated by this implies that j injects into h 1 xn 1 h 1 xn 1 by the above diagram it follows that j injects into h 1 x r z 0 l 1 thus j is nontrivial in h 1 x 1 imh 1 z 0 l 1 therefore by the definition of p 2 1 xn j is nontrivial in the quotient p 1 1 xn p 2 1 xn h 1 x 1 imh 1 z 0 l 1 by assertion c p 1 1 xn p 2 1 xn p 1 1 xn 1 p 2 1 xn 1 also j is isotopic to the meridian n 1 in xn 1 it follows that n 1 is nontrivial in the quotient p 1 1 xn 1 p 2 1 xn 1 this is exactly the promised conclusion for k n 1 now suppose 0 k n 2 the induction hypothesis is that k 1 is nontrivial in the quotient pn k 1 1 xk 1 p n k 1 xk 1 to show that k is nontrivial in pn k 1 xk p n k 1 1 xk we use an argument which is essentially the same as 3 proof of theorem 4 14 which was influenced by 12 let r q if k 1 and r zp 1 if k 0 let b h 1 m j 1 k 1 r t 1 h 1 m j 1 k 1 r t 1 r t r t 1 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 14 be the classical blanchfield pairing of j 1 k 1 over r coefficients for brevity let g 1 xk 1 p n k 1 xk 1 consider the non commutative alexander module a h 1 m j 1 k 1 rg the non commutative blanchfield pairing b a a k rg is defined following 16 theorem 2 13 where k is the skew quotient field of rg for r zp 1 see also 3 section 5 in our case since 2 n k n from definition 3 1 it follows that g 1 xk 1 p n k 1 xk 1 is poly torsion free abelian ptfa and consequently rg is an ore domain due to 16 proposition 2 5 and 3 lemma 5 2 we will use the following known facts 1 the nontriviality of k 1 in p n k 1 1 xk 1 p n k 1 xk 1 g implies that a rg r t 1 h 1 m j 1 k 1 r t 1 and that b 1 x 1 y 0 if and only if b x y 0 this is due to 33 theorem 4 7 2 theorem 5 16 and 12 lemma 6 5 theorem 6 6 see also 3 theorem 5 4 2 the 4 manifold xk 1 endowed with 1 xk 1 g is a blanchfield bordism in the sense of 4 definition 4 11 due to an argument in 4 p 3270 which uses 4 theorem 4 13 the 4 manifold wk 1 in 4 plays the role of our xk 1 the only property of a blanchfield bordism we need is the following for all z in ker a h 1 xk 1 rg b z z 0 by 4 theorem 4 12 recall that e pk t k e j 1 k e j 1 k 1 m j 1 k 1 xk 1 denote a zero linking longitude of k in e pk t k m j 1 k 1 by k abusing notation if k is trivial in pn k 1 xk 1 p n k 1 1 xk 1 then by the definition of p n k 1 k 1 k lies in the kernel of a h 1 xk 1 rg by 2 from this it follows that b 1 k 1 k 0 and consequently by 1 b k k 0 since j 1 k 1 pk k j 1 k with k n 2 the alexander module h 1 m j 1 k 1 r t 1 is isomorphic to that of stevedore s knot pk which is a cyclic module generated by k it contradicts the non singularity of the classical blanchfield pairing b this shows that k is nontrivial in pn k 1 xk 1 p n k 1 1 xk 1 which is isomorphic to p n k 1 xk p n k 1 1 xk by assertion c since k is identified with k it follows that k is nontrivial in the quotient pn k 1 xk p n k 1 1 xk this completes the proof of assertion a proof of assertion b recall that assertion b says that 1 z l 0 i maps to pi 1 1 x for 1 i n to show this for i 1 observe that the composition 1 z 0 l 1 1 z 0 l 2 h 1 z 0 l z t 1 h 1 x z t 1 h 1 x q t 1 1 h 1 x q t 1 1 imh 1 z 0 l q t 1 1 is obviously zero by definition of p 2 1 x it follows that 1 z 0 l 1 maps to p 2 1 x therefore for all 1 i n 1 z 0 l i 1 z 0 l 1 i 1 maps to p 2 1 x i 1 which is a subgroup of pi 1 1 x 3 2 obstruction from cheeger gromov invariants now we will use the cheeger gromov invariant to derive a contradiction we begin with some background for a connected closed 3 manifold m and a homomorphism 1 m with arbitrary the cheeger gromov invariant 2 m r is de fined 10 the value of 2 m is preserved under composition with automorphisms of 1 m so one can view 2 m as an invariant of m equipped with the homo topy class of a map m b k 1 instead of 1 m even when m is not connected 2 m is defined for m b with additivity under disjoint union 2 m i 2 mi mi where m imi with components mi in this paper we do not use the definition of 2 m 2 given in 10 instead for our purpose the following l 2 signature defect interpretation is useful if m mi primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 15 bounds a 4 manifold w and m b factors through w then 2 m i 2 mi mi is equal to the l 2 signature defect 2 w sign 2 w sign w where sign w is the ordinary signature and sign 2 w is the l 2 signature of w over the group we note that this approach can also be used to provide an alternative definition of 2 m for arbitrary m as references see for instance 9 18 section 2 23 section 3 5 section 2 1 for our case let 1 x p n 1 1 x for a connected 3 dimensional submani fold m in x denote the composition 1 m 1 x by abusing notation then by the l 2 signature defect interpretation for 2 x we have 3 2 2 m j 10 n 2 k 0 2 m pk 2 m r u d 2 x 2 v 0 2 c 2 z 0 l i j 2 z 0 i j n 1 k 0 2 ek where the 4 manifolds z 0 i j are copies of z 0 i used in the construction of x see figure 5 the second equality is obtained by novikov additivity of l 2 signatures for instance see 16 lemma 5 9 recall that 0 is the meridian of j 1 0 in m j 1 0 by assertion a 0 is nontrivial in since j 10 lies in the subgroup pn 1 x p n 1 1 x of which is a vector space over zp 1 by definition 3 1 it follows that j 10 has order p 1 so the image of 1 m j 1 0 in under is isomorphic to zp 1 by 8 lemma 8 7 this implies that 3 3 2 m j 10 j 1 0 zp 1 where j 10 zp 1 is defined by 2 2 by the explicit universal bound for the cheeger gromov invariants given in 5 theorem 1 9 we have 3 4 2 m pk 6 69 713 280 since stevedore s knot pk has 6 crossings similarly by 5 theorem 1 9 3 5 2 m r u d 8 m 92 69 713 280 since r u d has a diagram with 8 m 92 crossings see figure 1 by 12 lemma 2 4 the following holds for each k 3 6 2 g c 0 2 g ek 0 to evaluate the terms 2 v 0 and 2 z 0 l in 3 2 we will use the following result theorem 3 3 amenable signature theorem 3 theorem 3 2 suppose that w is an integral n 1 solution bounded by the zero surgery manifold m k of a knot k suppose is a group which satisfies n 1 1 and lies in strebel s class d zp 1 in the sense of 45 or equivalently is a locally p indicable group due to 26 if 1 m k is a homomorphism which factors through 1 w and sends the meridian of k to an infinite order element in then 2 m k 2 w 0 in our case v 0 is an integral n 1 solution bounded by m k also the group lies in d zp 1 by 8 lemma 6 8 and we have n 1 1 since 1 x n 1 pn 1 1 x the meridian of k has infinite order in since surjects onto h 1 x z generated by the meridian by amenable signature theorem 3 3 it follows that 3 7 2 v 0 2 m k 0 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 16 now we will evaluate 2 z 0 l using amenable signature theorem again note z 0 l m l an important difference from the above paragraph is that the 4 manifold z 0 l is an integral n solution not n 1 so amenable signature theorem does not apply directly over since n is not necessarily trivial instead we proceed as follows note that the map 1 m l 1 z 0 l factors through 1 z 0 l 1 z 0 l n by assertion b let g be the image of 1 z 0 l 1 z 0 l n in and let 1 m l g be the map induced by since g injects into we have 2 m l 2 m l by the l 2 induction property for instance see 10 eq 2 3 now since g is a subgroup of which is in d zp 1 g is in strebel s class d zp 1 too also g n is trivial since it is the image of 1 z 0 l 1 z 0 l n the meridian l of l has infinite order in g since g surjects onto h 1 x z which l generates there fore amenable signature theorem 3 3 with n in place of n 1 applies to m l to conclude that 3 8 2 z 0 l 2 m l 2 m l 0 by 6 lemma 3 3 we may assume that each z 0 i j has the property that 2 z 0 i j is equal to either 0 or j i 0 zp 1 indeed 6 lemma 3 3 applies when every j i 0 is 0 negative it is the case by property j 1 in section 2 1 moreover by property j 3 in section 2 1 we have 3 9 2 z 0 i j 0 or j 10 zp 1 if i 1 0 if i 1 now combine 3 2 3 9 to obtain n 2 j 10 zp 1 6 n 8 m 86 69 713 280 where n is one plus the number of the 4 manifolds z 01 j such that 2 z 01 j 6 0 since n 1 it contradicts property j 2 in section 2 1 this completes the proof that p cannot be equal to d that is p must be j 4 computing and estimating d invariants in this section we will continue the proof of theorem 2 2 to reach a contradiction under the hypothesis that p j 4 1 finite cyclic covers and their d invariants we begin by applying a trick introduced in 11 which we describe below let k 1 k 0 j is a satellite knot where the pattern satisfies lk k 0 0 then the identity on e kt extends to a map e k 1 e kt e j e kt e u e k 0 which induces an isomorphism h 1 m k 1 q t 1 h 1 m k 0 q t 1 un der which we will identify the alexander modules essentially 11 lemma 8 2 says the following see also 6 lemma 5 1 if k 1 k 0 j admits a 1 negaton x 1 bounded by m k 1 and if j is unknotted by changing some positive crossings to negative then k 0 has a 1 negaton x 0 bounded by m k 0 such that the two maps h 1 m ki q t 1 h 1 xi q t 1 i 0 1 have the identical kernel in particular this applies to the satellite knot k 1 r u d d j 1 n 1 defined in section 2 1 since j 1 n 1 pn 2 n j 1 n 2 is unknot ted by changing a single positive crossing see figure 2 note that here we use that primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 17 n 2 therefore in our case the knot k 0 r u d admits a 1 negaton bounded by m k 0 say w such that 4 1 j ker h 1 m k 0 q t 1 h 1 w q t 1 we will derive a contradiction from the existence of this 1 negaton w for k 0 the next step is to pass to finite degree branched cyclic covers to which heegaard floer homology machinery applies following 6 section 5 1 let r be the r fold branched cyclic cover of s 3 k 0 the curves j and d in figure 1 represent ho mology classes in r say x 1 and x 2 h 1 r respectively the classes x 1 and x 2 are defined up to covering transformation but it will cause no problem in our ar gument due to 37 we have h 1 r h 1 m k 0 z t 1 tr 1 recall that h 1 m k 0 z t 1 is given by 2 1 from this by elementary computation it fol lows that that h 1 r z m 1 r mr z m 1 r mr and the summands are generated by x 1 and x 2 in particular r is a z 2 homology sphere for a rational homology 3 sphere y and a spinc structure t on y ozsva th and szabo defined a correction term invariant d y t using the heegaard floer chain complex 40 in case of a z 2 homology sphere y the unique spin structure determines a canonical spinc structure on y which we denote by sy and all spin c structures of y are given in the form sy c where c h 2 y and designates the action of h 2 y on the set of spinc structures for x h 1 y let x h 2 y be the poincare dual of x techniques used in 6 11 give us the following d invariant obstruction lemma 4 1 suppose m k 0 bounds a 1 negaton which satisfies 4 1 if r is suffi ciently large then d r s r k x 1 0 for all k z proof attach a 2 handle to a given 1 negaton w along the zero framed meridian of k 0 to obtain a 4 manifold which we temporarily call v note that v s 3 and the cocore of the 2 handle is a slicing disk v bounded by k 0 take the r fold branched cyclic cover of v and call it vr here the r fold branched cyclic cover is defined since using that w is a 1 negaton we see that h 1 w r z generated by a meridian of indeed if we denote by wr the r fold cyclic cover of w then vr is obtained by attaching a 2 handle to wr the 4 manifold vr is bounded by r the first key step is to relate the hypothesis p j which is associated with the infinite cyclic cover to the kernel g ker h 1 r h 1 vr associated with finite covers the following is a modified version of 6 lemma 5 2 assertion under the hypothesis that p j x 1 g for all large primes r although we do not use it we remark that the assertion implies that g x 1 since it is known that g is equal to h 1 m 1 2 m 1 r mr proof of assertion let er be the r fold cyclic cover of the exterior e k 0 for r consider the following commutative diagram h 1 m k 0 z t 1 h 1 e h 1 w h 1 w z t 1 h 1 w q t 1 h 1 er h 1 wr h 1 r h 1 vr the vertical arrows are induced by coverings and inclusions since j lies in the kernel of the composition of the top row by the hypothesis j is z torsion in h 1 w z t 1 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 18 that is a j 0 in h 1 w z t 1 for some nonzero a z by the above diagram it follows that a x 1 h 1 r lies in the kernel g of h 1 r h 1 vr suppose r is a prime not smaller than any prime factor of a under this assumption we claim that gcd a m 1 r mr 1 from this it follows that x 1 lies in g since x 1 has order m 1 r mr in h 1 r this proves the assertion modulo the proof of the claim to show the claim it suffices to show that every prime factor q of a is relatively prime to m 1 r mr it is obviously true if q m or q m 1 so suppose q divides neither m nor m 1 but q divides m 1 r mr let u m m 1 where m is an arithmetic inverse of m mod q we have ur 1 mod q by the hypothesis and uq 1 1 mod q by fermat s little theorem since r is a prime and u 6 1 mod q it follows that r q 1 this contradicts the assumption that r q this completes the proof of the claim the assertion enables us to invoke a result of cochran harvey and horn 11 theorem 6 5 which says the following if w is a 1 negaton bounded by m k 0 then d r x 0 for all x lying in g ker h 1 r h 1 vr applying this to x k x 1 the proof of lemma 4 1 is completed theorem 4 2 let m 1 is an odd integer and r 1 is an odd prime power let k be the arithmetic inverse of 2 mod m 1 r mr then d r s r kx 1 32 on the other hand lemma 4 1 says that d r s r kx 1 must be non negative this contradiction implies that the kernel p defined in 2 4 cannot be equal to j this completes the proof of theorem 2 2 for m 1 theorem 4 2 was already shown in 6 theorem 5 4 we remark that the symbol m in 6 denotes our r so in the remaining part of this paper we will assume that m 1 proof of theorem 4 2 let a and b be the 3 manifolds given by the surgery presen tations in figures 6 let yr be the connected sum of a b and r 3 copies of the lens space l 2 m 1 1 we use the orientation convention that lp 1 is the p framed surgery on the trivial knot u in s 3 then arguments in 6 section 6 1 construct a negative definite 4 manifold w with w yrt r and b 2 w 2 m 1 r 4 m 1 and con struct a spinc structure t on w such that c 1 t 2 r c 1 t r x 1 and c 1 t yr 0 indeed 6 section 6 1 is the case of m 1 we do not repeat the details here since exactly the same method works under our assumption that m 1 is odd perhaps the least obvious part is that the inverse matrix p 1 in 6 eq 6 10 should be replaced with a block matrix p 1 rij 1 i j r 1 with rij m 1 i mi m 1 r j mr j m 1 r mr 0 m 1 i j mi j 0 for i j and rij r t ji for i j m 1 a m 2 m 1 d m 2 b m 2 m 1 figure 6 the 3 manifolds a and b the box 2 m 1 represents 2 m 1 right handed full twists between vertical strands primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 19 by applying ozsva th szabo s d invariant inequality 40 theorem 9 6 to the nega tive definite 4 manifold w and by using additivity of the d invariant under connected sum we have d r t r d yr t yr c 1 t 2 b 2 w 4 d a t a d b t b r 3 d l 2 m 1 1 t l 2 m 1 1 2 mr 4 m 1 4 since c 1 t yr 0 we have t l 2 m 1 1 sl 2 m 1 1 by a d invariant formula for lens spaces given in 40 proposition 4 8 d l 2 m 1 1 sl 2 m 1 1 m 2 by lemmas 4 3 and 4 4 which we will prove below we have d a t a m 7 4 and d b t b m 2 4 combine them with the above inequality to obtain d r t r 32 observe that c 1 t r x 1 2 kx 1 c 1 s r kx 1 since 2 k 1 mod m 1 r mr and x 1 has order m 1 r mr it follows that t r s r since r is a z 2 homology sphere note that h 1 a det m 2 m 1 2 m 1 m 1 3 m 2 3 m 1 is odd so there is a unique spinc structure s of a such that c 1 s 0 lemma 4 3 for the spinc structure s on a with c 1 s 0 d a s m 7 4 for the case of b since h 1 b det m 2 m 1 2 m 1 m 2 3 m 2 2 m 1 is even there are exactly two spinc structures s of b such that c 1 s 0 lemma 4 4 if s is a spinc structure of b such that c 1 s 0 then d b s m 2 4 proof of lemma 4 3 let a be the 3 manifold obtained by m 6 surgery on the knot t d see figure 7 let y be the 3 manifold given by the last surgery diagram in figure 7 the four diagrams in figure 7 describe a cobordism from a a to y more precisely start by taking a a i attach a 2 handle to obtain a cobordism say v from a a to the second surgery diagram in figure 7 apply handle slide to change the second surgery diagram to the third observe that in the third surgery diagram the two components with framing m 6 and 0 give a s 3 summand while the two components with framing m and 2 m 7 form a link concordant to the link in the last surgery diagram which describes y it follows that there is a homology cobordism say v from the third surgery diagram to y now v v is a cobordism from a a to y we claim that v is negative definite to see this view the surgery diagram of the 3 manifold a a as a kirby diagram of a 4 manifold v 0 that is v 0 consists of one 0 handle and three 2 handles attached along the framed link diagram of a a in figure 7 we have v 0 a a the second diagram in figure 7 or equivalently the third diagram is a kirby diagram of the 4 manifold v 0 a a v the kirby diagram of v 0 has linking matrix l m 2 m 1 0 2 m 1 m 0 0 0 m 6 which has signature 1 since m 0 and the top upper 2 2 submatrix has negative determinant it follows that signv 0 1 the third diagram in figure 7 has linking matrix m 2 m 1 0 0 2 m 1 2 m 7 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 m 6 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 20 m 1 m a 2 m 1 d m 6 dta 2 handle attachment 0 m 1 m 2 m 1 d m 6 dt

1 since b 2 v 1 this proves the claim that v is negative definite since v is a homology cobordism h v v h v consequently v v is negative definite we will construct a generator of h 2 v v h 2 v and use it to describe a certain spinc structure on v v let be the core of the 2 handle of v a a and let be its attaching circle which lies in a a see the second diagram in figure 7 in which is the zero framed circle since the linking matrix l is a presentation for h 1 a a it is seen that h 1 a a z 3 m 2 3 m 1 zm 6 and 1 1 in h 1 a a so the order of in h 1 a a is 3 m 2 3 m 1 m 6 d where d gcd 3 m 2 3 m 1 m 6 indeed it can be seen that d is either 91 or 1 from this it follows that there is a 2 cycle z in a a such that z 3 m 2 3 m 1 m 6 d moreover the 2 chain e 3 m 2 3 m 1 m 6 d z is a generator of h 2 v z by a standard mayer vietoris argument for the 2 handle attachment the self intersection number e e is equal to the intersection number in a a of z and a pushoff of z say z taken along the 2 handle attachment framing which is the zero framing in figure 7 so e e is equal to the linking number of z and its pushoff in the rational homology sphere a a in addition the linking number can primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 21 be computed using the linking matrix l for instance see 7 theorem 3 1 e e lka a z z 3 m 2 3 m 1 2 m 6 2 d 2 0 1 1 l 1 0 1 1 3 m 2 3 m 1 m 6 2 m 2 3 m 1 d 2 since the factor 2 m 2 3 m 1 of the numerator is even and d is odd e e is even from this it follows that 0 h 2 v v is characteristic therefore there is a spinc structure t on v v such that c 1 t 0 by the ozsva th szabo inequality 40 theorem 9 6 we have d y t y d a t a d a t a 1 4 note that a is the m 6 surgery on the knot t d and c 1 t a 0 since c 1 t 0 by techniques of 11 p 2150 2151 and 24 appendix a d a t a d lm 6 slm 6 by ozsva th szabo s formula for lens spaces 40 proposition 4 8 we have d lm 6 slm 6 m 5 4 by lemma 4 8 which we will prove below we have d y t y 2 m 1 4 note that c 1 t y 0 since c 1 t 0 combining these with the above inequality it follows that d a s m 7 4 4 2 a quick summary of ne methi s method for seifert 3 manifolds for the reader s convenience we provide a summary of ne methi s method to compute d invariants 38 which we will use in section 4 3 we focus on the case of seifert 3 manifolds which is treated in 38 section 11 while 38 provides techniques for a larger class of certain plumbed 3 manifolds let y be a seifert 3 manifold it is well known that y admits a surgery presentation of a specific form which is shown in the left of figure 8 the associated star shaped plumbing graph which is shown in the right of figure 8 is often used to describe the 3 manifold y as the boundary of a plumbed 4 manifold x for each vertex take a disk bundle over a 2 sphere whose euler number is the integer decoration of the vertex for each edge perform 1 plumbing between the two disk bundles corresponding to the endpoints the result is a 4 manifold x with x y let be the number of branches of the star shaped graph in figure 8 in this subsection we assume that 3 and that x is negative definite we remark that not all seifert 3 manifolds y are described by a plumbing graph satisfying this assumption e 0 e 1 1 e 1 2 e 1 s e 2 1 e 2 2 e 2 s e 1 e 2 e s e 0 e 1 1 e 1 2 e 1 s 1 e 2 1 e 2 2 e 2 s 2 e 1 e 2 e s figure 8 a seifert 3 manifold and its plumbing graph we use the following notation let e 0 be the decoration of the root vertex let s be the number of non root vertices on the th branch and let e 1 e s be primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 22 the decorations of those s vertices see figure 8 we may assume that e j 2 for all j for instance see 39 let b 0 and b j h 2 x be the classes of 2 spheres corresponding to vertices with decoration e 0 and e j respectively 1 1 j s they form a basis for the free abelian group h 2 x let b 0 and b j h 2 x be basis elements hom dual to b 0 and b j with respect to these bases the intersection form h 2 x h 2 x x or its adjoint h 2 x hom h 2 x z h 2 x is given as follows b 0 b 0 e 0 b j b j e j and for b 6 b b b 1 if b b b 0 b 1 or b j b j 1 and b b 0 otherwise for 1 define a continued fraction by e 1 e s e 1 1 e 2 1 the condition e j 2 implies that 1 so we may assume 0 then a standard diagonalization process applied to the intersection form gives us a diagonal matrix whose all diagonals are easily seen to be negative possibly except one which is equal to e e 0 1 so x is negative definite if and only if e 0 the set of characteristic elements in h 2 x is defined to be char x h 2 x bj bj bj mod 2 for all j the chern class c 1 spin c x char x is bijective since h 2 x does not have any 2 torsion under the identification via c 1 the action of an element c h 2 x on spinc x is given by 7 2 c for char x spinc x in particular the action of x h 2 x on char x spinc x via h 2 x h 2 x is given by 7 2 x the chern class c 1 spin c y h 2 y is not injective in general so the standard identification of spinc structures of y is given indirectly using x we have a bijection spinc y char x 2 h 2 x here for a spinc structure spinc x char x the coset 2 h 2 x in char x 2 h 2 x corresponds to the restriction of on y essentially the bijectivity is a consequence of the fact that h 2 y is the cokernel of h 2 x h 2 x in 38 the notion of a distinguished representative is used to express a spinc structure of y instead of the original definition see section 5 especially defini tion 5 1 of 38 we will use a characterization theorem as a definition we need the following notation for 1 i j s let n i j d i j e i e j where n i j 0 and gcd n i j d i j 1 note that n 1 s d 1 s define an element k spinc x char x h 2 x by 4 2 k b 0 e 0 2 k b j e j 2 for 1 1 j s the element k is characteristic since k b 0 b 0 b 0 and k b j b j b j mod 2 in 38 k is called the canonical spinc structure we have char x k 2 h 2 x consider a class kr char x of the form 4 3 kr k 2 a 0 b 0 j a jb j primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 23 where a 0 and a j are integers let 4 4 a s 1 t 1 n t 1 s a t definition 4 5 38 corollary 11 7 the class kr in 4 3 called a distinguished representative if 0 a for all and if 4 5 0 a 0 1 ie 0 1 i a for all i 0 here x is the largest integer not greater than x to state ne methi s formula for the d invariant we need one more notation let 4 6 i i 1 t 0 a 0 1 te 0 1 t a in particular 0 0 theorem 4 6 ne methi 38 p 1038 suppose x is negative definite and 3 suppose the class kr given in 4 3 is a distinguished representative then for the spinc structure kr of y the d invariant is given by d y kr k 2 r b 2 x 4 2 min i i 0 remark 4 7 1 for each kr given by 4 3 the minimum in theorem 4 6 can be found in finite steps to see this let i i 1 i then we have i a 0 1 ie 0 1 i a 1 e i 1 a 0 1 a 1 0 if i is not smaller than r 1 a 0 1 a 1 e here we use that e is negative since x is negative definite so the minimum in theorem 4 6 can be taken over 0 i max 0 r 2 a similar argument shows that it can be determined in finite steps whether a class kr given by 4 3 satisfies definition 4 5 indeed the right hand side of 4 5 is bounded from below by 1 a ei since e 0 4 5 is satisfied for all large i and thus it suffices to check 4 5 for only finitely many i using 1 and 2 it is straightforward to write a practically efficient algorithm and computer code to find distinguished representatives of all spinc structures of y and compute the associated d invariants primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 24 4 3 d invariants of the 3 manifolds y and b let y be the 3 manifold given by the last surgery diagram in figure 7 or equivalently by the first surgery diagram in figure 9 the following lemma gives an estimate of the d invariant of y which is used to complete the proof of lemma 4 3 note that there are two spinc structures on y satisfying c 1 s 0 since h 1 y 2 m 2 3 m 1 is even lemma 4 8 if s is a spinc structure on y such that c 1 s 0 then d y s 2 m 1 4 proof the surgery diagram calculus in figure 9 shows that y is a seifert 3 manifold the last plumbing graph in figure 9 describes a plumbed 4

calculus which gives a plumbing tree for y the symbol means handle slides and elimination of compo nents with 0 framed meridians to compute the d invariant we will apply the method discussed in section 4 2 using the notation in section 4 2 denote the basis of h 2 x by b 0 b 1 1 b 1 2 m b 2 1 b 3 1 b 4 1 and the dual basis of h 2 x by b 0 b 1 1 b 1 2 m b 2 1 b 3 1 b 4 1 the intersection form h 2 x h 2 x z is computed straightforwardly from primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 25 the plumbing graph 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 m 1 2 m 4 2 m 4 also using the definition in section 4 2 it is routine to compute the following 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 2 m 1 2 m 2 1 3 1 m 1 1 so the orbifold euler number is given by e 2 2 m 2 m 1 1 2 1 3 1 m 1 m 1 2 m 1 6 m 1 2 m 1 for m 1 we have e 0 so x is negative definite we will describe two spinc structures k 1 and k 2 char x 2 h 2 x let k 1 2 b 1 2 m b 3 1 2 b 4 1 k 2 2 b 1 2 m 1 b 3 1 2 b 4 1 it is straightforward to show that k 1 and k 2 are distinguished representatives in the sense of definition 4 5 indeed in our case the canonical spinc structure described in 4 2 is given by k b 3 1 m 1 b 4 1 and k 1 is of the form 4 3 where a 0 0 a 1 1 a 1 2 m 0 0 1 a 2 1 0 a 3 1 1 a 4 1 1 by 4 4 we have a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 0 1 0 1 m 3 2 this satisfies the conditions in definition 4 5 so k 1 is a distinguished representative the class k 2 is shown to be a distinguished representative too by similar computation in this case we have a 0 0 a 1 1 a 1 2 m 0 0 1 0 a 2 1 0 a 3 1 0 a 4 1 m 2 and a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 0 2 0 0 m 2 under the adjoint h 2 x h 2 x hom h 2 x z of the intersection form of x k 1 and k 2 are respectively the images of x 1 2 b 0 2 b 1 1 2 b 1 2 m b 2 1 b 3 1 x 2 4 b 1 4 b 1 1 4 b 1 2 m 1 2 b 1 2 m 2 b 2 1 2 b 3 1 2 b 4 1 recall that char x h 2 x is identified with spinc x via c 1 and thus for a spinc structure k char x 2 h 2 x of y we have c 1 k k y so c 1 k 0 if and only if k lies in the kernel of h 2 x h 2 y or equivalently k lies in the image of h 2 x h 2 x from this observation it follows that c 1 ki 0 for i 1 2 since ki xi also k 1 6 k 2 since x 1 x 2 2 h 2 x therefore to complete the proof it suffices to show d y ki 2 m 1 4 for i 1 2 we have k 21 x 1 x 1 3 k 22 x 2 x 2 m 4 the last thing we need is the minimum of the values of i defined in 4 6 recall the notation i i 1 i from remark 4 7 assertion for both k 1 and k 2 and for all i 0 i 0 primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 26 we will provide a proof of the assertion for m 23 for m 23 the assertion is verified by direct inspection using remark 4 7 indeed the author used a computer program so we omit details for m 23 note that it suffices to use m 23 to prove the main results of this paper theorems a b c and d for the case of k 1 by remark 4 7 we have i 0 for i r where r 8 48 m 6 2 m 1 m 1 since m 23 r 10 so i 0 for i 10 for i 10 using 4 6 we have i 1 2 i 2 mi 1 2 m 1 i 2 i 1 3 i m 3 2 m 1 1 2 i i i 1 2 i 1 3 i 1 6 0 this shows the claim for k 1 for the case of k 2 we proceed in the same way we have r 7 48 m 6 2 m 1 m 1 since m 23 r 10 and thus i 0 for i 10 by remark 4 7 for 1 i 10 using 4 6 we have i 1 2 i 2 mi 1 2 m 1 i 2 i 3 i m 2 m 1 1 2 i i i 1 2 i 2 3 i 1 6 0 for i 0 a direct computation using 4 6 gives 0 1 this completes the proof of the assertion from the assertion it follows that min i i 0 0 since 0 0 so by ne methi s theorem 4 6 d y ki k 2 i 2 m 4 4 2 m 1 4 for i 1 m 4 for i 2 therefore d y ki 2 m 1 4 holds for i 1 2 now to complete the proof of theorem 2 2 it only remains to prove of lemma 4 4 which estimates d invariants of the 3 manifold b in figure 6 in the proof below we will use that b is a seifert 3 manifold as well proof of lemma 4 4 recall that b is the 3 manifold described in figure 6 let s be a spinc structure of b satisfying c 1 s 0 the goal is to show that d b s m 2 4 as we will see in what follows it will be useful to consider b instead of b that is we will show d b s m 2 4 figure 10 shows that b is a seifert 3 manifold we use the notation of section 4 2 the associated plumbed 4 manifold x has h 2 x z 2 m with basis elements b 0 b 1 1 b 1 m b 2 1 b 2 m 2 b 3 1 the associated decorations are e 0 2 e 1 j 2 for all j e 2 j 2 for all j and e 3 1 2 m 1 let b 0 b j be the dual basis elements in h 2 x since e 2 m m 1 m 2 m 1 1 2 m 1 3 m 2 2 m 1 m 2 1 2 m 1 0 the 4 manifold x is negative definite this is why we use b instead of b primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 27 m 2 b m 2 m 1 0 m 1 2 m 1 m 1 plumbing graph m 1 m 1 2 m 1 0 2 2 m 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 m 2 m figure 10 surgery diagram calculus showing that b is a seifert 3 manifold the symbol means handle slides or rolfsen twist 41 p 264 followed by elimination of a component together with a 0 framed meridian the canonical spinc structure k of x is given by k 2 m 1 b 3 1 let x 1 b 1 1 b 1 3 b 1 m b 3 1 x 2 b 2 1 b 2 3 b 2 m 2 b 3 1 and let ki xi h 2 x for i 1 2 then ki char x k 2 h 2 x so that ki char x 2 h 2 x spinc b is a spinc structure of b similarly to the proof of lemma 4 8 c 1 ki ki b 0 also k 1 6 k 2 in spinc b since x 1 x 2 2 h 2 x it follows that k 1 and k 2 are the two spinc structures of b with c 1 0 so it suffices to show that d b ki m 2 4 for i 1 2 instead of determining the values exactly we will present a simpler argument which gives the promised estimate we have k 21 x 1 x 1 3 m 2 so by ozsva th szabo s inequality 40 theorem 9 6 4 7 d b k 1 k 21 b 2 x 4 m 2 4 similarly since k 22 x 2 x 2 3 m we have 4 8 d b k 2 k 22 b 2 x 4 m 4 so we have d b ki m 2 4 for i 1 2 indeed it can be shown that the equality holds in 4 7 and 4 8 by using the technique described in section 4 2 as we did in the proof of lemma 4 8 appendix general primary decomposition the goal of this appendix is to present an abstract formulation of the notion of primary decomposition along an invariant with values in an unique factorization domain we also discuss questions in specific cases and earlier related results in the literature from our viewpoint the organization is as follows in section a 1 we describe the definition of general primary decomposition and present basic observations in section a 2 we investigate primary decomposition of extensions in sections a 3 we primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 28 discuss specializations to various knot concordance groups e g smooth topological and related filtrations in section a 4 we discuss the case of rational homology cobordism group of rational homology 3 spheres a 1 definitions and basic observations let k be an abelian monoid and is an equivalence relation on k suppose that the monoid structure on k descends to an abelian group structure on the set c k of equivalence classes denote the equivalence class of k k by k c let r be a unique factorization domain with involution r 7 r main examples are z with a trivial involution and the laurent polynomial ring q t 1 with the standard involution ait i ait i for r s r write r s if r and s in r are associates that is r us for some unit u in r we say that two irreducibles and in r are associates if either or we say that r r is self dual if r r suppose k r r 0 is a function we will denote a representative of k by k rr 0 suppose the following hold for all k k in k 1 k is self dual 2 k k k k 3 k j for some j in k such that j k in particular writing s r r r r 6 0 is self dual k s r is a homo morphism between abelian monoids of course the main example which one may keep in mind is the case that k is the monoid of knots under connected sum is concordance and k is the alexander polynomial in r q t 1 including this we will discuss various specific examples in sections a 3 and a 4 let k c k 1 for an irreducible in r let s if is self dual and s otherwise let c k c k s k for some k 0 c k c k is relatively prime to it is straightforward to verify that c c and are subgroups of c using 2 and 3 also using 1 it is seen that k c if and only if k j for some j with j lying in the multiplicative subset generated by and the units in r we have c c c and c c use s s and 1 to verify the two equalities respectively note that while k is self dual irreducible factors of k are not necessarily self dual for instance in r q t 1 we have 2 t 5 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 2 by the above definition a class k with k 2 t 5 2 t 1 lies in c for t 2 definition a 1 let p be the set of associate classes of irreducibles in r 1 we say that k is left primary decomposable if the sum l p c c of the inclusions c c is an isomorphism 2 we say that k is right primary decomposable if the surjections c c c induce an isomorphism r c p c c primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 29 since each k has finitely many irreducible factors it follows that the prod uct c p c c of the surjections c c c has image in the direct sum p c c that is r is always a well defined homomorphism we remark that taking the quotient by may be viewed as an analogue of ignoring units in the primary decomposition in a unique factorization domain for brevity when the choice of k is clearly understood from the context we will simply say that c is left or right primary decomposable from the definition it is straightforward to see that c is left primary decomposable if only if the following two conditions lp 1 and lp 2 hold more precesly lp 1 and lp 2 are respectively equivalent to the surjectivity and injectivity of l lp 1 existence for every k k there exist irreducibles 1 n and k 1 c 1 kn c n such that k k 1 kn mod lp 2 uniqueness if k 1 kn 0 mod and ki c i for some pairwise distinct 1 n p then ki 0 mod for all i the following examples illustrate that the left and right primary decomposabilities are independent of each other example a 2 let k ak bk cj dj a b c d 0 z 0 4 be the free abelian monoid generated by four generators k k j and j define on k by ak bk cj dj pk qk rj sj a b c d p q r s and let c k then c is the infinite cyclic group and k k j j is a generator fix r which has three distinct self dual irreducibles and define ak bk cj dj a b c d in particular k and j it is straightforward to verify that 1 2 and 3 are satisfied and that the subgroup is trivial we claim that c is left primary decomposable indeed it is straightforward to see that for l k l is a power of an irreducible if and only if l ak bk and thus l a b it follows that for any irreducible in r c c if and c 0 otherwise so l c c is an isomorphism on the other hand c is not right primary decomposable to see this observe that k c for all 6 since k also k j c since j since k generates c it follows that c c for all so r c c c 0 is not injective example a 3 let k c r and be as in example a 2 but define ak bk cj dj a b c d note that 1 2 and 3 are satisfied k j and is trivial first we will show that c is not left primary decomposable for l k either l 0 or l is not a power of s for any irreducible therefore c 0 for all it follows that l c 0 c is not surjective on the other hand c is right primary decomposable to prove this observe that l is relatively prime to if and only if l 0 that is c 0 also k c for 6 and j c for 6 since c is generated by k j it follows that c c for 6 therefore r c c c is an isomorphism while the above examples tell us that the bijectivity of l does not imply the bijectivity of r nor vice versa the following observations provide partial relationships between the surjectivity and injectivity of l and r primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 30 lemma a 4 1 if l is surjective then r is surjective 2 suppose r is injective then the following splitting property holds if k and j are relatively prime and k j 0 mod then k j 0 mod in particular l is injective proof 1 the homomorphism r is surjective if and only if for every given k c and p there exists j c such that j k mod c and j 0 mod c for all 6 by the surjectivity of l or equivalently lp 1 k k 1 kn mod for some ki c i where i 6 j for i 6 j if i for some i then let j ki otherwise let j 0 then since c i c whenever 6 i it follows that j has the desired property 2 suppose gcd k j 1 and k j 0 mod if an irreducible di vides j then gcd k 1 and so k 0 mod c if gcd j 1 then k k j 0 mod c so k 0 mod c for all and thus k 0 mod by the injectivity of r the same argument shows j 0 mod from this lp 2 immediately follows that is l is injective remark a 5 as seen in the last sentence of the above proof of lemma a 4 1 the composition c c c c is zero if 6 consequently the composition r l p c p c c is the orthogonal direct sum of the compositions c c c c it follows that c c c c is an isomorphism for each irreducible if and only if r l is an isomorphism consequently c c c c is an isomorphism if c is left primary decomposable and right primary decomposable recall that c is left primary decomposable if and only if lp 1 and lp 2 hold the following is a stronger variation of lp 1 lp 1 strong existence for every k k there exist irreducible factors 1 n of k and k 1 c 1 kn c n such that k k 1 kn mod definition a 6 we say that c k is strongly primary decomposable if lp 1 and lp 2 hold proposition a 7 if c is strongly primary decomposable then c is left primary de composable and right primary decomposable proof if c is strongly primary decomposable c is obviously left primary decompos able also r is surjective by lemma a 4 1 so it remains to show that r is injective suppose that k lies in c for all irreducibles the goal is to show that k we claim that the given k can be assumed to lie in c for some p to prove this first use lp 1 or the surjectivity of l to write k k 1 kn mod for some ki c i where i 6 j for i 6 j fix i we have that ki k j 6 i kj mod kj c j c i for all j 6 i and k c i it follows that ki c i since ki c i ki c for 6 i so ki lies in c for all note that it suffices to show that ki for all i to conclude that k this proves the claim now fix an irreducible suppose k c and k c for all since k c we have k j for some j k such that gcd j 1 by lp 1 j j 1 jm mod for some jk c k where the k are irreducible factors of j in particular every k is relatively prime to also k is relatively prime to primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 31 too since k divides j j which is relatively prime to so k 6 in p for all k since k j 1 jm and k c it follows that k lies in by lp 2 a 2 extensions suppose that k is as in section a 1 and a is a subgroup of c k we have a a for the submonoid a k k k a or conversely if a is a submonoid of k such that k j 0 and k a imply j a then a a is a subgroup of c let g c a be the quotient group we have g k where the equivalence relation is defined by k j if and only if k j l for some l a we will relate primary decompositions of a c and g to avoid confusion for a c and g respectively denote by a c and g their subgroups of classes represented by k with k 1 we have a c a and g c a a g c a it is straightforward to verify that the exact sequence 0 a c g 0 gives rise to an exact sequence 0 a c g 0 and induces the following exact sequences for all irreducibles in q t 1 0 a c g 0 0 a c g 0 consequently rows of the following commutative diagram are exact a 1 0 p a a p c c p g g 0 0 a a c c g g 0 0 p a a p c c p g g 0 a l c l g l a r c r g r for l and r a 1 gives rise to an exact sequence a 2 0 ker a ker c ker g coker a coker c coker g 0 by the snake lemma it follows that c is an isomorphism if and only if a is injective g is surjective and the connecting map ker g coker a is an isomorphism the following is an immediate consequence theorem a 8 the group c is left respectively right primary decomposable if both a and g are left respectively right primary decomposable theorem a 9 the group c is strongly primary decomposable if both a and g are strongly primary decomposable proof suppose a and g are strongly primary decomposable then by proposition a 7 and theorem a 8 c satisfies the uniqueness condition lp 2 so it remains to verify the strong existence condition lp 1 for c primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 32 fix k c since g satisfies lp 1 we have k j 1 jn mod c a for some j 1 c 1 jn c n where each i is an irreducible factor of k and ji is a power of s i so for some j c with j 1 we have a 3 k j 1 jn j a using property 3 choose j 1 j n such that j i ji and j i ji and let l k j 1 j n j then l a by a 3 and l k ji by 2 in particular irreducibles dividing l divides k since a satisfies lp 1 there is a decomposition l l 1 lm mod a a c where lj a j and each j is an irreducible factor of k it follows that k j 1 jn l 1 lm mod c recall that ji c i lj a j c j and i and j are factors of k so lp 1 is satisfied for the given k c a 3 knot concordance and primary decomposition algebraic concordance over q levine s work on knot concordance provides an algebraic analogue of the knot concordance group which is now called the algebraic concordance group 34 35 the algebraic concordance group over q is known to be left and right primary decomposable in our sense we describe this using blanchfield linking forms over q t 1 while levine s original papers 34 35 use seifert matrices let q t be the rational function field a q t q t 1 valued linking form is defined to be a map b v v q t q t 1 with v a finitely generated q t 1 module such that v q t 1 q t 0 which is sesquilinear and nonsingular that is b x y b y x y 7 b x is q t 1 linear for all x v and the adjoint v homq t 1 v q t q t 1 is an isomorphism let k be the monoid of q t q t 1 valued linking forms under direct sum operation and define k q t 1 by b b t where the alexander polynomial b t is defined to be the order of the torsion module v over q t 1 a linking form b is metabolic if there is a submodule p v such that p x v b x p 0 we say that b and b are witt equivalent if there are metabolic linking forms h and h such that the orthogonal sums b h and b h are isomorphic the set g of witt equivalence classes of linking forms is an abelian group under orthogonal sum 1 the conditions 1 2 and 3 stated in section a 1 hold by definition b t is trivial if and only if v is trivial it follows that the subgroup b g b 1 is trivial the following result is essentially due to levine 34 theorem a 10 levine 34 the group g is left and right primary decomposable g l g r g g indeed g is strongly primary decomposable an elegant generalization of levine s theorem a 10 to the case of the group ring of a noncommutative free group was developed in work of sheiham 43 section 3 see also 42 1 for the study of knots often the witt group of linking forms b satisfying b 1 b 1 6 0 is considered one can also consider 1 linking forms which satisfy b x y b y x instead of b x y b y x variations of theorem a 10 holds for these cases as well primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 33 algebraic concordance over z for a knot k in s 3 the blanchfield form 1 bk defined on the alexander module h 1 s 3 r k q t 1 is a linking form in the above sense we have k bk the association k 7 bk induces a homomor phism of the topological and smooth knot concordance group into g the image of this homomorphism is characterized as follows by replacing q t 1 q t with z t 1 s 1 z t 1 where s f t z t 1 f 1 1 one constructs an integral analogue of g say g z it is known that the natural map g z g is injective 34 and the subgroup g z of g is exactly the image of the concordance group of knots in s 3 a knot k such that bk 0 in g z g is said to be algebraically slice levine showed that both g and g z are isomorphic to z z 2 z 4 34 the difference of the structures of g and g z was studied in work of stoltzfus 44 among his main results it was shown that l g z g z is not surjective while it is injective due to levine s work 35 in particular g z is not left primary decomposable to the knowledge of the author it was not addressed in the literature whether g z is right primary decomposable topological knot concordance and algebraically slice knots let k be the set of isotopy classes of oriented knots in s 3 with connected sum as a monoid operation if k k k are topologically concordant write k k the set of equivalence classes ctop k is the topological knot concordance group define k q t 1 by k k t the alexander polynomial of k the assumptions 1 2 and 3 in section a 1 are standard properties of the alexander polynomial by work of freedman 21 the subgroup k ctop k 1 is trivial let atop be the topological concordance group of algebraically slice knots then since 0 atop ctop gz 0 is exact ctop is right primary decomposable if so are both atop and gz regarding left primary decomposability since g z gz is not surjective due to stoltzfus 44 top l c top ctop is not surjective by the exact sequence a 2 in particular ctop is not left primary decomposable the following appear to be interesting question a 11 1 is top l c top ctop injective 2 is ctop right primary decomposable by lemma a 4 2 an affirmative answer to question a 11 2 implies that the an swer to question a 11 1 is affirmative and that the splitting property in lemma a 4 2 holds in the literature there are related results which provide affirmative answers to the following splitting question for certain concordance invariants or obstructions if k and j have relatively prime alexander polynomials and if the invariant vanishes for k j then does the invariant vanish for each of k and j see work of s g kim 28 which addresses the case of casson gordon invariants and work of and s g kim and t kim 29 30 on l 2 signature defects these may be viewed as evidence supporting an affirmative answer to the injectivity part for top r in question a 11 2 which implies the splitting property stated in lemma a 4 2 also t kim 32 proved results related to primary decomposition structures in atop smooth concordance and topologically slice knots let k and be as above but now write k k if k and k are smoothly concordant then csm k is the smooth knot concordance group primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 34 similarly to the case of ctop the homomorphism sml c sm csm is not surjective since g z gz is not surjective so csm is not left primary decompos able question a 12 1 is sml c sm csm injective 2 is csm right primary decomposable again by lemma a 4 2 an affirmative answer to question a 12 2 implies that the answer to question a 12 1 is affimative and that the splitting property stated in lemma a 4 2 holds the smooth concordance group of topologically slice knots t is the kernel of the natural homomorphism csm ctop by theorem a 8 csm is right primary decom posable if both t and ctop are right primary decomposable question 1 1 in the introduction asks whether t is left and right primary decom posable in the sense of definition a 1 and theorem a provides supporting evidence for affirmative answers recall that the definition in section a 1 says that k t if k s k for some k 0 for topologically slice k k ff for some f q t 1 due to fox and milnor 20 from this it follows that k s k for some k 0 if and only if k for some 0 thus the definition of t in section a 1 agrees with that in section 1 1 livingston informed us that the techniques of 25 can be used to show the fol lowing there are non associate self dual irreducible polynomials 1 2 and 3 and a topologically slice knot k with k 1 2 3 2 which is not smoothly concordant to a connected sum k 1 k 2 k 3 for any knots k 1 k 2 and k 3 with ki a power of i it says that t does not satisfy the strong existence condition lp 1 this method does not provide counterexamples to the left right primary decomposability of t filtrations of the knot concordance groups for the bipolar filtration tn of t defined by cochran harvey and horn 11 question 1 2 in the introduction asks whether the associated graded grn t tn tn 1 is left and right primary decompos able in the sense of definition a 1 theorem c supports an affirmative answer by presenting a large subgroup which is left and right indeed strongly primary decom posable into infinitely many infinite rank primary parts in addition whether tn is left right primary decomposable appears to be an inter esting problem by theorems a 8 and a 9 tn is left right primary decomposable if so are both tn 1 and grn t in 16 cochran orr and teichner introduced a descending filtration 0 fn 5 fn f 1 f 0 5 f 0 ctop of the topological knot concordance group ctop a knot k represents an element of fh h 12 z 0 if k is h solvable in the sense of 16 definitions 8 5 and 8 7 question a 13 are fh and fh fh 0 5 left and or right primary decomposable once again by theorem a 8 fh is left right primary decomposable if so are both fh 0 5 and fn fh 0 5 for integers n 0 it is unknown whether fn 5 fn 1 is nontriv ial recently davis martin otto and park showed that elements in f 0 5 represented by a genus one knot are contained in f 1 19 for the other half of the associated graded fn fn 5 cochran harvey and leidy provided strong evidence which support the conjecture that the associated graded fn fn 5 is right primary decomposable for all integers n 0 13 14 indeed they proposed a highly refined primary decom position conjecture for the associated graded fn fn 5 using non commutative local izations 14 p 444 and they showed that refined primary parts reveal interesting primary decomposition in the smooth concordance group 35 structures 13 14 we remark that aforementioned earlier works of s g kim and t kim 28 29 also provide supporting evidence for the case of f 1 f 1 5 a 4 rational homology 3 spheres and primary decomposition let top q and sm q be the topological and smooth rational homology cobordism groups of rational homology 3 spheres respectively for a rational homology 3 sphere y let y h 1 y z the order of the first homology with integral coefficients the association y 7 y h 1 y satisfies conditions 1 2 and 3 so our general definition of primary decomposition applies to top q and sm q for the topological case the subgroup y topq h 1 y 0 is trivial since every integral homology 3 sphere bounds a contractible compact 4 manifold 22 sec tion 9 3 c so the left and right primary decompositions concern the homomorphisms l p top q p top q r top q p top q top q p where p varies over primes in z here the primary parts topq p is generated by z 1 p homology spheres and top q p is generated by zp homology spheres the linking form ly h 1 y h 1 y q z of a rational homology 3 sphere y gives fundamental information algebraically a q z valued linking form is a nonsingular symmetric bilinear form l a a q z with a a finite abelian group the witt group of q z valued linking forms which we denote byw q z is defined in the standard manner there is a homomorphism top q w q z which sends the class of a rational homology sphere y to the witt class of the associated linking form ly this is surjective due to 27 the following is a well known conjecture 31 p 4 conjecture a 14 the homomorphism top q w q z is an isomorphism also it is a standard fact that the witt group w q z is left and right primary decomposable indeed the strong existence condition lp 1 is also satisfied the primary part w q z p is the witt group of linking forms defined on p torsion finite abelian groups so an affirmative answer to the above conjecture implies that top is left and right primary decomposable for the smooth case the left and right primary decompositions concern the homo morphisms l p smq p smq r smq p smq sm q p where smq is the subgroup generated by the classes of integral homology 3 spheres a result of s g kim and livingston 31 proposition p 184 says that this l is not surjective and thus sm q is not left primary decomposable we have the following questions question a 15 1 is l p sm q p smq injective 2 is smq right primary decomposable by theorem a 8 smq is right primary decomposable if conjecture a 14 is true and the rational homology cobordism group of rational homology 3 spheres bounding a topological rational homology 4 ball is right primary decomposable primary decomposition in the smooth concordance
