and whitney towers in dimension 4 focusing on their fundamental groups in particular we introduce a notion of unknottedness of gropes and whitney towers in the 4 sphere we prove that various modifications of gropes and whitney towers preserve the unknottedness and do not enlarge the fundamental group we exhibit handlebody structures of the exteriors of gropes and whitney towers constructed by earlier methods of cochran teichner horn and the first author and use them to construct examples of unknotted gropes and whitney towers as an application we introduce geometric bi filtrations of knots which approximate the double sliceness in terms of unknotted gropes and whitney towers we prove that the bi filtrations do not stabilize at any stage 1 introduction in 4 dimensional topology the disk embedding problem is of primary importance since freedman s 1983 icm proceedings paper fre 84 capped gropes have been used as the most essential ingredient for disk embedding especially for the non simply connected case the book of freedman and quinn fq 90 presents beautiful grope based treat ments of foundational results in dimension 4 it is also natural to consider a closely related notion of whitney towers together with gropes cochran orr and teichner in troduced a framework of the study of knot concordance which can be viewed as the local case of the general disk embedding problem in terms of symmetric gropes and whitney towers cot 03 for links conant schneiderman and teichner developed a theory of asymmetric grope concordance and whitney tower concordance as summarized in cst 11 to obtain flat embedded disks from capped gropes the present technology e g see fq 90 ft 95 kq 00 cp 16 requires that the involved fundamental group is very roughly speaking not too large such a group is often called good the key question which is still left open is whether all groups are good the best known result is that subexponential groups and their iterated extensions and direct limits are good due to freedman and teichner ft 95 and krushkal and quinn kq 00 unknotted gropes and whitney towers in this paper motivated by the above we begin to study the structure of the exteriors of gropes and whitney towers in 4 manifolds focusing on their fundmantal groups we also present an application to double slicing of knots the following definition formulates the case of the smallest possible fundamental group definition 1 1 a sphere like capped grope or whitney tower in the 4 sphere is 1 unknotted if its complement has infinite cyclic fundamental group precise definitions of sphere like capped gropes and whitney towers are given in sec tion 2 1 for those who are familiar with the notion of properly immersed capped gropes in fq 90 we remark that we consider a more general class of capped gropes in 4 manifolds for which a cap is allowed to intersect body surfaces as well as caps sim ilarly to e g cst 14 an infinite cyclic fundamental group is the smallest possible in 1 http arxiv org abs 1612 02226 v 3 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 2 the sense that the fundamental group of every sphere like capped grope whitney tower exterior in s 4 has an infinite cyclic quotient see remark 2 6 the following observation justifies our terminology freedman showed that a flat 2 sphere s embedded in s 4 is unknotted in the classical sense if and only if 1 s 4 r s is infinite cyclic fre 84 thus an embedeed 2 sphere is unknotted if and only if it is 1 unknotted as a capped grope or whitney tower furthermore if one performs finger moves on a 2 sphere embedded in s 4 and obtains a whitney tower consisting of the resulting immersed 2 sphere together with the additional whitney disks introduced by the finger moves then the whitney tower is 1 unknotted if and only if the original embedded sphere is unknotted see lemma 2 9 we note that if a sphere like properly immersed capped grope g in s 4 has height at least 1 5 and is unknotted then for any 2 disk d contained in the base surface the disk embedding result in cp 16 theorem 3 4 tells us that the subgrope grd can be replaced with a flat embedded disk thus the grope g can be modified relative to d to a flat embedded 2 sphere modifications of whitney towers and gropes it turns out that various fundamental operations on capped gropes and whitney towers do not enlarge the fundamental group of the exterior and consequently preserve the 1 unknottedness for instance in sections 2 and 3 we show that it is the case for the following operations 1 regular homotopy of whitney towers definition 2 7 and lemma 2 9 2 taking a subtower of a whitney tower by removing whitney disks proposi tion 2 10 and corollary 2 11 3 whitney disk splitting proposition 3 4 4 symmetric and asymmetric contraction of a capped grope proposition 2 13 5 pushing an intersection down in a capped grope proposition 3 6 6 krushkal s grope splitting proposition 3 7 in sch 06 schneiderman presented fundamental procedures which transform a capped grope to a whitney tower in an arbitrary 4 manifold and vice versa concerning this we prove the following result on the exteriors theorem a schneiderman s transformation sch 06 from a whitney tower to a capped grope does not enlarge the fundamental group of the exterior and for sphere like ones in the 4 sphere it preserves the 1 unknottedness the same holds for schneiderman s transformation from a capped grope to a whitney tower in section 3 we state and prove a refined version of theorem a as theorem 3 1 analysis of grope constructions cochran and teichner ct 07 horn hor 10 and cha cha 14 b developed methods to produce annulus like symmetric gropes in s 3 i cobounded by knots in s 3 0 and s 3 1 which can be viewed as approximations of or dinary concordance together with obstructions from l 2 signatures these constructions have been used as key ingredients in revealing the rich structure of the grope and whit ney tower theory in the context of concordance e g see hor 11 cp 14 jan 17 briefly in these methods the two knots in s 3 0 and s 3 1 are related by iterated satellite constructions and annular gropes cobounded by them are constructed by first finding simpler gropes and surfaces in 3 space for companions and patterns of the satellite con structions and then stacking them in 4 space a precise formulation of this procedure is described in sections 4 1 and 4 2 see definitions 4 1 4 4 and 4 6 we present a handle decomposition of the exterior of a grope in s 3 i obtained by these methods in particular we show the following unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 3 theorem b suppose g is an annular capped grope in s 3 i cobounded by k s 3 0 and k s 3 1 which is constructed by the methods of cochran and teichner ct 07 horn hor 10 and cha cha 14 b described in sections 4 1 and 4 2 let eg and ek be the exteriors of g and k then eg has a relative handle decomposition with 2 handles only eg ek i 2 handles we state and prove a full version of theorem b in section 4 2 see in particular the orem 4 7 one can apply schneiderman s method sch 06 to convert a capped grope constructed by the methods of ct 07 hor 10 cha 14 b to a whitney tower of the same height com bining theorem b with our analysis of schneiderman s method which is used to prove theorem a it turns out that the exterior of the resulting whitney tower has a similar handle decomposition with 2 handles only application to knot double slicing we use the notion of 1 unknottedness and the above handle structure results to study double slicing of knots in terms of gropes and whitney towers recall that a knot k in s 3 is doubly slice if there is an unknotted flat 2 sphere in s 4 which intersects the standard s 3 s 4 at k that is k is a slice in s 3 of an unknotted 2 sphere in s 4 inspired from this we define a knot k in s 3 to be height m n grope slice if it is a slice of a 1 unknotted sphere like capped grope g in s 4 such that the intersections of g with the upper and lower hemispheres of s 4 have height m and n respectively here m and n are nonnegative half integers see definition 5 2 we also define a height m n whitney slice knot similarly by replacing the grope g above by a whitney tower we denote by gm n and wm n the collection of height m n grope slice knots and height m n whitney slice knots respectively each of gm n and wm n is a submonoid of the monoid of knots under connected sum and gm n and wm n are decending non increasing bi filtrations it turns out that a height m n grope slice knot is height m n whitney slice that is gm n wm n see theorem 5 3 a doubly slice knot is height m n grope slice and height m n whitney slice for all m n and therefore lies in the intersection of all gm n and wm n it turns out that previously known obstructions to knots being doubly slice are ob structions to lying in low height terms of our bi filtrations in section 7 we show that the double sliceness obstructions by gilmer livingston friedl and livingston meier gl 83 fri 04 lm 15 vanish for knots in g 4 4 or w 4 4 it is proven in stronger forms in propositions 7 2 7 4 and 7 6 our main result on the geometric bi filtrations gm n and wm n is the following theorem c let m n 3 be integers 1 there exists a family of slice knots j i i 1 2 in gm m whose arbitrary nontrivial linear combination aij i ai z is not in wm 5 m 5 2 there exists a family of knots j im n i 1 2 in gm n whose arbitrary nontrivial linear combination aij i m n ai z is not in wm 5 n wm n 5 theorem c is proven in a stronger form in theorem 6 10 since gm n wm n it follows from theorem c that both bi filtrations gm n and wm n are highly nontrivial in the proof of theorem c we give the knots j i and j im n using iterated satellite constructions the main proof consists of two parts the existence of a 1 unknotted capped grope of the given height and the non existence of a 1 unknotted whitney tower of larger height unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 4 for the existence briefly speaking we employ the methods of ct 07 hor 10 cha 14 b to produce capped gropes which slice our knots we prove that they are 1 unknotted by using handle structures given by theorem b details can be found in section 5 2 for the non existence we first relate our geometric filtrations to the solvable bi filtration which was defined by the second author kim 06 as a double slicing analog of cochran orr teichner s solvable filtration cot 03 briefly a knot k is m n solvable if there are 4 manifolds u and v bounded by the zero surgery manifold m k each of which ap proximates a slice disk exterior in terms of a certain duality property over the group ring z 1 1 n where 1 n designates the nth derived subgroup such that the union u m k v has infinite cyclic fundamental group see definition 6 4 for a precise description in section 6 1 we prove that a knot is m n solvable whenever it is height m 2 n 2 whitney slice that is wm 2 n 2 fm n see theorem 6 5 then in sections 6 2 6 4 we use the amenable signature theorem of co 12 cha 14 a and combine it with the ideas of kim 06 to extract obstructions to being m n solvable from the von neumann cheeger gromov 2 invariants of the zero surgery manifolds a corollary of the above outlined proof of theorem c is that its analog holds for the solvable bi filtration fm n in place of both gm n and wm n as well this consequence which provides infinitely many linearly independent knots in each stage of the solvable bi filtration modulo the next stages generalizes the main result of kim 06 which gives nontrivial knots in each stage of the solvable bi filtration modulo the next stages acknowledgements the authors thank patrick

discuss some basic properties 2 1 preliminaries whitney towers and gropes we begin by recalling the definitions of whitney towers and gropes readers familiar with them may skip to section 2 2 after reading our conventions given after definition 2 3 in the following definitions we will assume that the readers are familiar with the notion of framed immersions of surfaces and whitney disks for instance see fq 90 1 2 1 4 in this paper we will define and use framed gropes and whitney towers only in particular a whitney disk will always be framed as follows for a whitney disk d pairing two intersections of sheets a and b the restriction of the unique framing of d on d is equal to the framing determined by the tangential direction of a on a d and the common normal direction of b and d on b d in this paper surfaces are always orientable definition 2 1 whitney tower suppose s is a surface an s like whitney tower in a 4 manifold w is a 2 complex defined inductively as follows a properly immersed surface s s w w is an s like whitney tower in w suppose t is an s like whitney tower and d is a framed immersed whitney disk pairing two intersections of opposite signs between two sheets in t where the interior of d is allowed to transversely intersect unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 5 the interior of surfaces disks of t but is disjoint from the boundary of any surface in t then t together with d is an s like whitney tower we say that s is the base surface of t and s supports t the boundary of t is that of the base surface of t we will mostly use sphere like or disk like whitney towers we often consider symmetric whitney towers which are defined to be a whitney tower with a well defined height in the following sense this was introduced by cochran orr and teichner cot 03 we remark that the notion of order is defined for any whitney towers as in for instance cst 12 definition 2 2 height of a whitney tower suppose t is a whitney tower for sur faces disks and intersections in t the height is defined inductively as follows the height of the base surface of t is one if p is an intersection of two surfaces disks of the same height k in t then we say p has height k if a whitney disk in t pairs up two intersec tions of the same height k we say the disk has height k 1 note that the height may not be defined for some intersections and for some whitney disks let n be a positive integer we say that t is a whitney tower of height n if the following hold i for all surfaces disks in t and their intersections the height is defined and not greater than n and ii all intersections of height n are paired up by whitney disks in t we say that t is a whitney tower of height n 5 if the following hold i for all surfaces disks in t the height is defined and not greater than n 1 ii all intersections between surfaces disks of height n have well defined height and are paired up by whitney disks in t and iii each height n 1 whitney disk does not meet surfaces disks of height n but allowed to meet surfaces disks of height n and n 1 an immersed surface can be viewed as a whitney tower of height one definition 2 3 grope a capped surface is a surface together with disks attached along 2 g standard symplectic basis curves on where g is the genus of fq 90 2 1 the disks are called caps suppose s is a surface a model s like capped grope is a 2 complex defined inductively as follows a 2 complex obtained from s by replacing finitely many disjointly embedded disk in s by capped surfaces is a model s like capped grope its base surface is defined to be the surface we obtain by modifying s if g is a model s like capped grope then a 2 complex obtained by replacing a cap with a capped surface is a model s like capped grope its caps are the unmodified caps of g together with the caps of the attached capped surface its base surface is defined to be that of g the body of a model capped grope g is defined to be g with all caps removed the boundary of g is the boundary of the base surface note that a model capped grope g admits a standard embedding in r 3 composing it with r 3 r 4 g embeds in r 4 take a regular neighborhood of g r 4 and then possibly introduce finitely many plumbings between caps surfaces an embedding of the result into a 4 manifold w is called an immersed capped grope in w in this paper we assume that each intersection in an immersed capped grope always involves a cap that is there is no intersection between two sheets of body surfaces while caps are allowed to meet caps and body surfaces we remark that this differs from the notion of a properly immersed capped grope fq 90 which is defined to be an immersed capped grope whose intersections are always between caps in our case every intersection can be changed to intersections of a cap and the base surface by pushing intersections down as described in fq 90 section 2 5 see also section 3 2 of this paper unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 6 definition 2 4 height of a capped grope suppose g is a model capped grope the height of surfaces caps in g is defined inductively as follows the height of the base surface of g is one the height of a surface cap in g is k 1 if its boundary is attached to a surface of height k if all caps of g have height n 1 then we say that g is a capped grope of height n if for each dual pair of curves on the base surface a height n capped grope is attached along one of them and a height n 1 capped grope along the other then we say that g is a capped grope of height n 5 2 2 unknotted whitney towers definition 2 5 a union of spheres like whitney tower t in s 4 is 1 unknotted if 1 s 4 r t is a free group if it is the case the rank of the free group is automatically equal to the number of the base spheres in particular a sphere like whitney tower t in s 4 is 1 unknotted if 1 s 4 r t z remark 2 6 1 for every sphere like whitney tower t in s 4 the abelianization h 1 s 4 r t of 1 s 4 r t is equal to z by alexander duality in this sense for the sphere like case t is 1 unknotted if and only if the complement has the smallest fundamental group 2 definition 2 5 is a whitney tower generalization of the standard notion of an unknotted 2 sphere embedded in the 4 sphere in light of the following well known result fq 90 11 7 a a locally flat 2 sphere s embedded in s 4 is unknotted if and only if 1 s 4 r s z in other words s is unknotted as a sphere if and only if s is 1 unknotted as a whitney tower recall that a finger move fq 90 1 5 for surfaces introduces new intersections paired by an embedded whitney disk the finger move is reversed by a whitney move across the disk for a whitney tower we will consider a finger move which introduces new intersections of surfaces disks of the tower performed along an arc whose interior is disjoint from the tower as our convention the newly introduced whitney disk is added to the resulting whitney tower similarly when we apply a whitney move across an embedded whitney disk in a whitney tower we remove the whitney disk we used from the tower definition 2 7 a regular homotopy for a whitney tower is a finite sequence of ambient isotopy finger moves and whitney moves across an embedded whitney disk for brevity we use the following terminology if a b and c are subspaces of x satisfying a b c and f 1 x r a 1 x r b is a homomorphism such that fi j for the inclusions i x rc x ra and j x rc x rb then we say that f is supported by c or f extends the identity on x r c for a subcomplex k of a manifold x we denote its regular neighborhood by k and the exterior x r k by ek when x is a topological manifold k and ek are defined if a neighborhood of k admits a pl smooth structure with respect to which k is pl smooth in this paper it is always the case since we will use the following standard fact repeatedly we state it as a lemma lemma 2 8 suppose k l is a subcomplex pair embedded in an n manifold x with l k x if k l e 1 er with ei a pi cell then x ek h 1 hr with hi an n pi handle proof let k 0 l and ki l e 1 ei then ekr ek and eki 1 is obtained from eki by filling in it with ei d pi dn pi since ei eki d pi dn pi ei is an n pi handle unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 7 lemma 2 9 regular homotopy preserves unknottedness suppose t is a whitney tower obtained from another whitney tower t by a finger move in a 4 manifold w then the exterior et is obtained by attaching a 3 handle to the exterior et and thus there is an isomorphism 1 w r t 1 w r t supported by a regular neighborhood of the trace of the finger move consequently regular homotopy preserves the 1 unknotedness of whitney towers in s 4 proof consider a finger move which converts a tower t to another tower t suppose this is performed along an arc joining two interior points of surfaces disks of t see figure 1 then et et et r that is et is homeomorphic to the exterior of in et since is a 1 cell et et 3 handle by lemma 2 8 the other conclusions follow from this t t figure 1 a finger move performed along proposition 2 10 unknottedness of subtowers suppose t is a whitney tower in a 4 manifold w and let t be a whitney tower which is obtained from t by removing some whitney disks then et et handles of index 2 and consequently the inclusion induces an epimorphism of 1 w r t onto 1 w r t in addition if w s 4 and t is sphere like and 1 unknotted then t is 1 unknotted proof it suffices to consider the case that t is obtained by deleting a whitney disk d note that d is immersed and may intersect other surfaces in general view et d as a 2 complex embedded in et since et is equal to the exterior of et d in et it follows that et et handles of index 2 by lemma 2 8 therefore the inclusion induced homomorphism 1 w r t 1 w r t is surjective finally if w s 4 and t is a sphere like whitney tower which is 1 unknotted then since 1 s 4 r t z h 1 s 4 r t it follows that 1 s 4 r t z an immediate corollary is that we can lower the height of a whitney tower without losing 1 unknottedness corollary 2 11 suppose s is an immersed 2 sphere in s 4 supporting a 1 unknotted whitney tower of height h 1 2 z then for any h h s supports a 1 unknotted whitney tower of height h proof let t be the given whitney tower of height h when h n z remove whitney disks of height n by proposition 2 10 the resulting tower is 1 unknotted and has height n when h n 5 remove whitney disks of height n 1 this produces a 1 unknotted whitney tower of height n 1 and by definition it is also a tower of height n 5 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 8 2 3 unknotted capped gropes as in the whitney tower case we define the notion of unknottedness of a capped grope in terms of the fundamental group definition 2 12 a union of spheres like capped gropeg immersed in s 4 is 1 unknotted if 1 s 4 r g is a free group in particular a sphere like capped grope g in s 4 is 1 unknotted if 1 s 4 rg z analogs of proposition 2 10 and its corollary 2 11 for capped gropes can be formulated in terms of contraction suppose d 1 and d 2 are dual caps of a capped grope g that is they are attached to the same body surface say along curves intersecting at a single point following fq 90 2 3 take two parallel copies of d 1 and d 2 and attach them to a square neighborhood of the point d 1 d 2 in to obtain a disk cut along d 1 and d 2 and then attach this disk this gives a surface with genus one less than that of see the left hand side of figure 2 we call this symmetric contraction applying this to all the dual pairs of caps attached to a top stage surface we can replace the top stage surface together with its caps by a disk which may be viewed as a new cap there is an asymmetric version of the above following kq 00 forget one of the caps say d 2 cut along d 1 and attach two parallel copies of d 1 to obtain a new surface with genus one less than that of see the right hand side of figure 2 we call this operation asymmetric contraction similarly to the above a top stage surface of a capped grope can be changed to a cap by applying this repeatedly d 1 d 2 symmetric asymmetric figure 2 symmetric and asymmetric contraction proposition 2 13 unknottedness of contraction suppose g is a capped grope obtained from another capped grope g in a 4 manifold w by either asymmetric or symmetric contraction then eg eg 2 handles consequently there is an epimorphism of 1 w r g onto 1 w r g supported by a regular neighborhood of g in addition if w s 4 and g is sphere like and 1 unknotted then g is 1 unknotted proof we assert that eg is homeomorphic to the exterior el of a 2 complex l obtained by attaching k 2 cells to g where k is the number of intersections of the capsd 1 d 2 with other surfaces caps all the conclusions follow from this since eg el 2 handles by lemma 2 8 to prove the assertion for the symmetric contraction case attach to g k 2 cells which are shown in figure 3 as hatched rectangles denote the resulting complex by l briefly speaking the picture tells us that l has the same regular neighborhood as that of g and consequently the exterior of l in w is homeomorphic to that of g unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 9 figure 3 a 2 complex l with the same exterior as the initial capped grope g this is the case of k 3 that is there are three arcs represent ing other surfaces which intersect the caps the three hatched rectangles are additional 2 cells attached to the contraction in what follows we will present a formal approach for the last sentence since it will also be useful in later sections it is best described using the language of pl topology since we need to deal with complexes which are not manifolds and their regular neighborhoods definition 2 14 suppose k is a subcomplex of a simplicial complex x if is a subcomplex of x such that k dn an embedded n 1 ball in dn for some n 1 then we say that k is obtained from k by elementary cellular expansion in x and k is obtained from k by elementary cellular collapse we say that k expands cellularly to k in x and k collapses cellularly to k if there is a sequence of elementary cellular expansions in x transforming k to k when the ambient complex x is clearly understood we often omit in x the following is a standard fact for instance see rs 72 chapter 3 lemma 2 15 if k expands cellularly to k in a manifold x then the regular neighbor hoods k and k in x are isotopic in x consequently the exteriors ek and ek are homeomorphic we remark that lemma 2 15 applies to subcomplexes in a triangulable codimension zero submanifold of a topological manifold for instace in a regular neighborhood of an immersed capped grope now returning to the proof of proposition 2 13 observe that the hatched rectangles in figure 3 lie in thickened caps of g and each thickened cap of g cut along the hatched rectangles is a 3 cell it follows that l expands cellularly to g with thickened caps by lemma 2 15 it follows that el is homeomorphic to eg a similar argument can be carried out for the asymmetric case as well corollary 2 16 suppose g is a 1 unknotted sphere like capped grope of height h in s 4 h 1 2 z then for any h h there is a 1 unknotted capped grope of height h which is obtained from g by symmetric asymmetric contraction proof contract top stage surfaces repeatedly until the capped grope has the desired height the result is 1 unknotted by proposition 2 13 3 transformation between unknotted whitney towers and gropes in sch 06 schneiderman presents fundamental constructions which convert an immersed s like capped grope to an s like whitney tower immersed in a neighborhood of the capped unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 10 grope and vice versa furthermore he shows that the corresponding capped gropes and whitney towers have exactly the same intersection data which are described precisely in terms of uni trivalent trees as a corollary he shows that a capped grope of height h in a 4 manifold can be transformed to a whitney tower of height h with the same boundary sch 06 corollary 2 in this section we show that schneiderman s method preserves unknottedness as stated below theorem 3 1 1 if a capped grope g is obtained from a whitney tower t in a 4 manifold w by schneiderman s construction then eg et handles of index 2 and thus there is an epimorphism of 1 w r t onto 1 w r g supported by a regular neighborhood of t consequently if t is sphere like and 1 unknotted inw s 4 then g is 1 unknotted 2 if a whitney tower t is obtained from a capped grope g in a 4 manifold w by schneiderman s construction then et eg handles of index 2 and thus there is an epimorphism of 1 w r g onto 1 w r t supported by a regular neighborhood of g consequently if g is sphere like and 1 unknotted in w s 4 then t is 1 unknotted applying theorem 3 1 to a grope of height h we obtain the following corollary 3 2 suppose g is a 1 unknotted sphere like capped grope of height h in s 4 then in a regular neighborhood of g there is a 1 unknotted sphere like whitney tower of height h with the same boundary remark 3 3 if p is a planar surface contained in the base surface of a whitney tower t and p is disjoint from non base whitney disks then schneiderman s construction produces a capped grope g such that the base surface of g contains p and g r p is contained in a regular neighborhood of t r p conversely if p is a planar surface contained in the base surface of a capped grope g and p is disjoint from non base surfaces and caps then for the whitney tower t obtained by schneiderman s construction the base surface of t contains p and t rp is contained in a regular neighborhood of grp in particular this holds for the height h whitney tower obtained in corollary 3 2 3 1 modifications of whitney towers and unknottedness in the proof of theorem 3 1 we will use that 1 unknottedness is preserved under certain modifications of whitney towers and capped gropes which are discussed in this and next subsections splitting in sch 06 3 7 3 8 a splitting procedure was introduced to separate inter sections in a whitney tower suppose d is a whitney disk between two sheets a and b and is a properly embedded arc in d which joins a d to b d and avoids the intersection of d with other surfaces disks then a finger move on a along introduces two additional intersections between a and b and divides d into two new whitney disks see figure 4 for now ignore the disk repeated applying this splitting procedure one eventually obtains a whitney tower each of whose whitney disks is embedded and has either a single unpaired intersection or two intersections paired by another whitney disk unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 11 a b figure 4 splitting of a whitney disk proposition 3 4 suppose a whitney tower t is obtained from another whitney tower t by splitting in a 4 manifold w then et et 2 handles consequently there is an epimorphism of 1 w rt onto 1 w rt supported by a regular neighborhood of t in addition splitting changes a 1 unknotted sphere like whitney tower to a 1 unknotted whitney tower in s 4 proof let be the whitney disk shown in figure 4 which pairs the two new intersections of t introduced by the finger move let l be the union of t and the 3 dimensional trace of the finger move it is easily seen that t expands cellularly to the 3 complex l also the 2 complex t expands cellularly to l first thicken to fill in the top part of the trace of the finger move in figure 4 and then stretch it down to fill in the remaining part of the trace by lemma 2 15 it follows that the exterior et is homeomorphic to et by lemma 2 8 et et 2 handles et 2 handles tri sheet move the following modification which we call a tri sheet move in this paper was introduced in sch 06 lemma 3 6 suppose a b and c are surfaces disks in a whitney tower suppose d is a whitney disk which pairs two intersections between a and b and p is an intersection between d and c as illustrated in the left hand side of figure 5 we assume that p is the only intersection of d by splitting we may assume this for any unpaired intersection p if we denote a whitney disk between x and y by x y and denote an intersection between x and y by x y then we may write p a b c apply an isotopy of b in a regular neighborhood of d and replace d by another whitney disk d as shown in the right hand side of figure 5 this replaces p a b c by a new intersection q a b c b a c d p b a c d q figure 5 tri sheet move unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 12 proposition 3 5 if a whitney tower t is obtained from another whitney tower t by a tri sheet move in a 4 manifold w then et et and thus 1 w rt 1 w rt consequently a tri sheet move changes a 1 unknotted union of spheres like whitney tower to a 1 unknotted whitney tower in s 4 proof from figure 5 it is seen that t cellularly expands to t with thickened d by lemma 2 15 it follows that et is homeomorphic to et 3 2 modification of capped gropes and unknottedness to prove theorem 3 1 we also need the following observations on some modifications of capped gropes pushing an intersection down following fq 90 2 5 an intersection of a cap d and another non base surface cap s in an immersed capped grope can be changed to two intersections of d with the surface s to which s is attached by performing a finger move to push d off s and through s see figure 6 for now ignore the hatched rectangle repeatedly applying this we may assume that each cap intersects only the base surfaces d s s d s s figure 6 pushing an intersection down proposition 3 6 if a capped grope g is obtained from another capped grope g by pushing an intersection down in a 4 manifold w then eg eg 2 handle and thus there is an epimorphism of 1 w r g onto 1 w r g supported by a regular neighborhood of g consequently by pushing an intersection down a 1 unknotted sphere like capped grope is changed to a 1 unknotted capped grope in s 4 proof let be the disk shown in the right hand side of figure 6 and let l be the union of g and the trace of the finger move performed it is seen from figure 6 that both g and g expand cellularly to the 3 complex l by lemma 2 15 it follows that eg is homeomorphic to eg by lemma 2 8 eg eg 2 handle eg 2 handle grope splitting in kru 00 krushkal introduced an operation which splits caps and body surfaces of a grope the cap splitting is described as follows suppose d 1 and d 2 are dual caps attached to a body surface s of a capped grope immersed in a 4 manifold choose an embedded arc in d 1 which is disjoint from intersection points and joins d 1 d 2 and another point in d 1 perform tubing surgery on s along the cap d 1 is divided into two disks which can be used as caps for the new surface obtained and two parallel copies of d 2 can be used as their dual caps see figure 7 ignore the hatched rectangles i for now unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 13 d 1 d 2 s 1 2 figure 7 splitting of a cap d 1 repeatedly applying this operation one may assume that each cap has no self inter section and has at most one intersection point we may further assume that each cap has exactly one intersection point since we can apply contraction to remove a cap which has no intersection points similarly to the cap case one can split body surfaces if 1 and 2 are dual surfaces attached to a previous stage surface s in a capped grope g then apply tubing to s along an arc on 1 and attach two parallel copies of the subgrope supported by 2 if 1 has genus greater than one then by tubing along an appropriate arc 1 splits into two surfaces with genera less than that of 1 iterating this we may assume that each non base surface has genus one we call such a capped grope a dyadic capped grope in what follows we assume that a cap of a capped grope is embedded and can intersect the base surface only by pushing intersections down if necessary proposition 3 7 if a capped grope g is obtained from another capped grope g by grope splitting in a 4 manifold w then eg eg handles of index 2 and thus there is an epimorphism of 1 w r g onto 1 w r g supported by a regular neighborhood of g consequently grope splitting changes a 1 unknotted sphere like capped grope to a 1 unknotted capped grope in s 4 proof we assert that there is a 2 complex l inw which contains g as a subcomplex and expands cellularly to a 3 complex l which collapses cellularly to g from the assertion it follows that eg is homeomorphic to el by lemma 2 15 since l is obtained from g by attaching cells of dimension 2 eg el handles of index 2 this completes the proof the remaining part of this proof is devoted to showing the assertion the idea is easier to see for the case of cap splitting if we split g using a cap d 1 whose dual cap d 2 intersects other surfaces k times then it can be seen from figure 7 illustrated for k 2 that there are k 2 cells 1 k shown as hatched rectangles such that the 2 complex l g i expands cellularly to l g with thickened d 2 solid tube first expand the disk i to fill in the interior of thickened d 2 and then stretch down its bottom to fill in the solid tube it is obvious that the 3 complex l collapses cellularly to g the body surface splitting case could also be understood in a similar way but this would require a more complicated picture which does not fit into 3 space instead in what follows we present a more formal approach for both cap and body surface cases suppose 1 and 2 are dual surfaces or caps in g attached to the same body surface s and g is obtained by splitting 1 let gi be the capped subgropes supported by i for i 1 2 if i is a cap then gi is i itself each gi is embedded since the caps unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 14 are embedded and can intersect the base surface of g only let v i 3 be the solid tube used to perform tubing on s see figure 8 recall that g has two parallel copies of g 2 instead of g 2 choose a thickening g 2 i in such a way that the parallel copies are g 2 0 and g 2 1 and g 2 i v is a rectangle r of the form an interval in g 2 i in figure 8 r is shown as a hatched rectangle s g 2 i v i 3 r g 2 i v figure 8 the solid tube and thickened subgrope used for grope splitting we choose a tree k embedded in g 2 as follows for brevity for a body surface or cap s 1 dual to another body surface or cap s 2 we call the point s 1 s 2 the basepoint of s 1 and s 2 for the base surface of g 2 choose a basepoint in g 2 for each intersection p of a cap d in g 2 and a sheet in g choose an arc on d which joins p to the basepoint of d for each basepoint q of a surface cap attached to a body surface s in g 2 choose an arc on s joining q to the basepoint of s we assume that the interiors of the arcs chosen above are pairwise disjoint and are disjoint from the boundary of any surface and cap finally choose two arcs in g 2 whose intersection is the basepoint of the base surface of g 2 the union of all the above arcs is a tree k in g 2 since g 2 is embedded we regard the above arcs as an edge of k and their endpoints as vertices of k see figure 9 for an example in addition we may assume that g 2 rk i is equal to the rectangle r k g 2 figure 9 a tree k which expands cellularly to g 2 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 15 assertion 1 the tree k expands cellularly to g 2 actually it is seen from figure 9 that one can expand k to fill in the caps expand further to fill in the top stage body surfaces and continue to the lower stages to eventually fill in the whole grope g to make it rigorous we will prove a generalized statement that for any capped subgrope h in g 2 k h expands cellularly to h by an induction on the number n of surfaces caps in h assertion 1 is the case when h g 2 if n 1 then h is a cap and since h cut along k h is a disk k h expands cellularly to h suppose n 1 that is h consists of a body surface s and subgropes hi attached to s by induction hi k expands cellularly to hi thus it suffices to show that hi k s s expands cellularly to s it is true since s cut along hi k s is a disk this completes the induction and hence the proof of aseertion 1 let a be the intersection of g 2 i with sheets in the initial capped grope g we may assume that each component of a is a straight arc of the form v i g 2 i for some vertex v of k since the intersection of a cap of g 2 with a sheet is always a vertex of k let l 0 g 2 0 1 k i observe that l 0 is the 2 complex obtained from the 2 complex g 2 0 1 a by attaching 1 cells of the form v i for vertices v of k not intersecting any sheet and attaching 2 cells of the form e i for edges e of k assertion 2 the 2 complex l 0 expands cellularly to g 2 i assertion 2 follows from assertion 1 by applying the following which must be regarded as a known fact lemma 3 8 if a subcomplex k of x expands cellularly to x then the subcomplex x 0 1 k 0 1 expands cellularly to x 0 1 proof for an elementary cellular expansion of a complex k in x across an n disk such that 0 k is an n 1 disk embedded in 0 1 is an n 1 disk in x i such that 0 1 x 0 1 k 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 is an n disk embedded in 0 1 thus there is an elementary cellular expansion of x 0 1 k 0 1 across 0 1 by repeatedly applying this the desired conclusion is obtained let g be g with g 2 0 1 removed let l g l 0 and l g g 2 i v we will verify that l and l satisfy the properties promised at the beginning of the proof obviously l collapses cellularly to g see figure 8 since g 2 0 1 l 0 l is a 2 complex containing g as a subcomplex since r g 2 rk i we have g 2 i g g 2 i rr k g 2 i l 0 g l 0 see figures 8 and 9 it follows that the cellular expansion of l 0 to g 2 i in assertion 2 is indeed a cellular expansion of l g l 0 to g g 2 i since g g 2 i v v r bottom face of v is a disk see figure 8 there is a cellular expansion of g g 2 i to l across the cube v consequently l expands cellularly to l this completes the proof 3 3 proof of theorem 3 1 from whitney towers to capped gropes suppose t is a whitney tower in a 4 manifold w in sch 06 section 5 1 a capped grope g is constructed from t by first applying whitney tower splitting and then applying a sequence of tri sheet moves and the following operation unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 16 tubing on a cap suppose a dyadic capped grope immersed in a 4 manifold is given sup pose no cap has self intersections while a cap may intersect base surfaces suppose the union of caps and base surfaces supports a whitney tower disjoint from non base body surfaces we regard the union of the capped grope and the whitney tower as a 2 complex say p in particular a split grope subtower introduced in sch 06 section 4 2 is such a 2 complex we will not need its precise definition suppose d is a cap of the capped grope which has two intersections paired by a whitney disk perform tubing on d along rd and attach as new caps a meridional disk of the tube and with a collar neighborhood removed see figure 10 this gives us a new 2 complex say p which consist of a capped grope and a whitney tower d new caps figure 10 tubing on a cap d which has two intersections paired by a whitney disk observe that the above tubing operation preserves the homeomorphism type of the 2 complex exterior for from figure 10 it is seen that the new 2 complex p expands cellularly to the union p of the solid tube and the initial 2 complex p and then p collapses cellularly to p by lemma 2 15 the exterior is preserved from this and propositions 3 4 and 3 5 it follows that 1 w r g is a quotient of 1 w r t this proves theorem 3 1 1 from capped gropes to whitney towers suppose g is a capped grope in a 4 manifold w in sch 06 section 5 2 a whitney tower t is constructed from g by first pushing intersections down and applying grope splitting and then applying a sequence of tri sheet moves and the following operation surgery along a cap suppose p is a 2 complex consisting of a dyadic capped grope and a whitney tower supported by caps and base surfaces as in the case of tubing on a cap suppose d 1 and d 2 are dual caps attached to the same body surface s and d 1 intersects exactly one sheet a of the whitney tower replace the subgrope s d 1 d 2 by a cap obtained by ambient surgery on s using d 1 note that this new cap has two intersections with the sheet a which are paired by a whitney disk obtained by attaching to d 2 a band contained in d 1 as shown in figure 11 add this disk to the whitney tower this gives us a new 2 complex p which consists of the modified capped grope and the modified whitney tower although we start with a capped grope this surgery operation produces a hybrid 2 complex of a capped grope and a nontrivial whitney tower thus the use of a tri sheet move which is defined for a whitney tower makes sense in the above conversion process unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 17 a d 1 d 2 new whitney disk figure 11 surgery along a cap which intersects a sheet from figure 11 it is seen that the resulting 2 complex p expands cellularly to p with the cap d 1 thickened which then collapses cellularly to p by lemma 2 15 the homeo morphism type of the 2 complex exterior is preserved by the above surgery operation from this and propositions 3 6 and 3 7 it follows that 1 w r t is a quotient of 1 w rg this proves theorem 3 1 2 4 handle decomposition of grope exteriors in the literature constructions of gropes in a 4 manifold bounded by knots were developed for the study of concordance and related 4 dimensional equivalence relations for instance see ct 07 hor 10 cha 14 b cp 14 in this section we study the handle decomposition of the exterior of such gropes we will use this in the next sections to construct certain explicit unknotted gropes and whitney towers in s 4 4 1 satellite capped gropes and capped grope concordances we begin by presenting some definitions which appeared or are influenced by earlier papers cha 14 b ct 07 hor 10 from now on all immersed capped gropes are assumed to satisfy that each cap can intersect the base surface only push intersections down as described in section 3 2 if necessary definition 4 1 satellite capped grope cha 14 b definition 4 2 suppose l is a link in s 3 and is an unknotted simple closed curve in s 3 which is disjoint from l let e be the exterior of s 3 let be a zero linking longitude in e a satellite capped grope for l is a disk like capped grope g immersed in the 4 manifold e i such that g is bounded by 0 the body of g is disjoint from l i and the caps are transverse to l i if l is as above l may be viewed as a pattern in e d 2 s 1 for a satellite construction for a knot k by attaching e l to ek along an orientation reversing homeomorphism e ek which identifies a meridian and a zero linking longitude of with a zero linking longitude and a meridian of k respectively we obtain a satellite link in e ek s 3 we denote this link by l k or l k definition 4 2 product of satellite capped gropes suppose g e i and h e i are satellite capped gropes for l and k respectively view as a curve in ek el k the product g h of g and h is a satellite capped grope for l k described below note e e k e by an isotopy of caps of h if necessary we may assume that h e k i consists of circles of the form k t where k is a meridian of k and 0 t 1 for each k t take a copy gt of g in e t t e i and attach gt to h e k i along k t gt this gives a desired satellite capped grope for l k in e i e k e i cha 14 b proposition 4 3 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 18 the product g h is obtained by removing disjoint disks embedded in caps of h and then fill in it with copies of g it follows that if g and h have height h and k respectively then g h has height h k definition 4 3 capped grope concordance a capped grope concordance between two links l and l is a union of annuli like capped grope immersed in s 3 i such that the ith component of the base surface is cobounded by that of l 0 and that of l 1 in the literature a grope concordance without caps is often considered a grope concordance can be promoted to a capped grope concordance since s 3 i is simply connected the following is motivated by ct 07 theorem 3 8 hor 10 theorem 3 4 definition 4 4 product of a satellite capped grope and a capped grope concordance suppose g is a satellite capped grope for l and h is a capped grope concordance between two knots j and j the product g h is a capped grope concordance between l j and l j described below fix closed intervals u s 1 v 0 1 i and regard h as the annulus s 1 i with the disk u v replaced by a disk like capped grope b with b u v h s 1 i r u v u v b b s 3 i here caps of b may be plumbed with s 1 i r u v a regular neighborhood of h can be written as h s 1 d 2 i r u d 2 v s 1 d 2 b s 3 i with plumbings performed by an isotopy of l e s 1 d 2 we may assume l u d 2 u p 1 pr for some pi d 2 then l i s 1 d 2 i intersects the 4 ball u d 2 v at disks u p 1 pr v choose r parallel copies b 1 br of b such that bi u pi v and consider the capped grope l i r u p 1 pr v u pi v bi i bi in g by isotopy we may assume that caps of bi intersect s 1 d 2 i at disks of the form zj d 2 tj where zj s 1 tj 0 1 r v choose sufficiently small 0 and replace each disk zj d 2 tj in caps of bi with a copy of the satellite capped grope g in s 1 d 2 tj tj e i this gives a promised capped grope concordance g h between l j and l j similarly to the case of definition 4 2 if g and h have height h and k respectively then the product g h in definition 4 4 has height h k remark 4 5 the product operations defined above are associative precisely if gi is a satellite capped grope for ki i for i 1 2 3 then g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 1 g 2 g 3 are isotopic satellite capped gropes for k 1 1 k 2 2 k 3 3 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 3 3 also if h is a capped grope concordance between j and j then g 1 g 2 h and g 1 g 2 h are isotopic capped grope concordances between k 1 1 k 2 2 j k 1 1 k 2 2 j and k 1 1 k 2 2 j k 1 1 k 2 2 j the proofs are straightforward since we do not use this in this paper we omit details unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 19 4 2 handle structure of grope exteriors in the literature satellite capped gropes and grope concordances in a 4 manifold are often obtained by pushing capped gropes in the boundary 3 manifold for instance see ct 07 hor 10 cha 14 b cp 14 in this subsection we will investigate handle decomposition of the 4 dimensional exteriors of such capped gropes and their iterated products obtained by the constructions described in definitions 4 1 and 4 2 to state the result rigorously we use the following definitions definition 4 6 1 we say that g is a 3 d satellite capped grope for l if g is a capped grope embedded in s 3 bounded by an unknotted circle and l is a link in s 3 disjoint from the body of g and transverse to caps of g by pushing g s 3 s 3 0 into s 3 0 1 a satellite capped grope for l is obtained 2 we say that g is a 3 d capped grope concordance between two links l and l in s 3 if the following hold i l is obtained from l by replacing disjoint arcs 1 k l with arcs 1 k s 3 such that i i that is letting c lr 1 k l c 1 k ii g is an embedded union of disks like capped grope in s 3 bounded by the circles i i such that the body is disjoint from c and the caps are transverse to c note that the capped grope l 0 1 2 g 1 2 l 1 2 1 is a capped grope concordance in s 3 i between l and l we say that it is obtained by pushing g into s 3 i theorem 4 7 suppose h is a capped grope concordance which is obtained by pushing a 3 d capped grope concordance between two links j and j into s 3 i for i 1 n suppose gi is a satellite capped grope obtained by pushing a 3 d satellite capped grope for ki i into s 3 i where ki is a knot let g be the iterated product g g 1 g 2 gn h which is a capped grope concordance between k k 1 1 kn n j and k k 1 1 kn n j then the exterior eg in s 3 i has a handle decomposition eg ek i 2 handles in the proof of theorem 4 7 we will show that the conclusion holds for any choice of parenthesization for the product g 1 gn h indeed the product is well defined up to isotopy by remark 4 5 our approach may be compared with the standard methods in embedded morse the ory which is used to construct a handle decomposition of the exterior of an embedded submanifold in m i from the critical points of the submanifolds we will present an analog for the gropes in theorem 4 7 which are not submanifolds but 2 complexes near a surface stage critical level of type a first we consider a surface stage of a capped grope together with a collar neighborhood of the boundary of next stages attached to it this is explicitly described as follows suppose is a surface of genus g with connected nonempty boundary which is embedded in a 3 manifold m suppose 1 1 g g are standard symplectic basis curves on that is they are simple closed curves such that any two of them are disjoint except i i one point choose a unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 20 bicollar of 0 in m and let i 0 i 0 m i i now in the 4 manifold m i let a 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 let ea m i r a and e m r be the exteriors proposition 4 8 the 4 manifold ea has a handle decomposition ea e i 2 g 1 2 handles proof choose a regular neighborhood y in m and choose regular neighbor hoods y and y lying in the interior of y the exterior ea is homeomorphic to m i r y 0 1 3 y 1 3 2 3 y 2 3 1 fix a point on choose arcs i i 1 g on joining to i i in such a way that collapses cellularly and thus is homotopy equivalent to k i i i i see figure 12 since collapses cellularly to y is isotopic to a regular neighborhood of k 1 2 y y attaching circles figure 12 a regular neighborhood of the 2 complex from this it is seen that y r y is obtained by attaching 2 g 1 2 handles to a collar of y y r y in this case y y the attaching circles are shown in figure 12 the proof is completed by applying the following fact which we state as a lemma for later use as well unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 21 lemma 4 9 suppose y y y are compact codimension zero submanifolds in a 3 manifold m such that y y y suppose y r y is obtained from a regular neighbor hood of y r y in y by attachments of handles h p 1 1 h pk k of index pi that is there is a decomposition y y r y h p 1 1 h pk k y then the 4 manifold 4 1 w m i r y 0 1 3 y 1 3 2 3 y 2 3 1 has a handle decomposition w m r y i h p 1 1 h pk k where h pi i is a handle of index pi m r y 0 1 3 m r y 1 3 2 3 m r y 2 3 1 figure 13 the 4 manifold w in lemma 4 9 proof letwt w m 0 t for t i we will investigate howwt changes as t increases see the schematic picture in figure 13 for t 1 3 wt m r y 0 t m r y i obviously for 1 3 t 2 3 we still have wt m r y i since wt is obtained from m r y 0 t by pushing the codimension zero submanifold y r y 1 3 t into its complement this can be viewed as for instance repeatedly applying elementary cellular collapsing across the 4 balls 3 1 3 t where 3 is a 3 simplex of y r y for t 2 3 fixing t 0 1 2 2 3 we have wt wt 0 y r y 1 2 t 0 the attachment of y r y 1 2 t 0 towt along y r y 1 2 t 0 is equivalent to attach ments of handles h pi i h pi i 1 2 t 0 of index pi since y r y is obtained by attaching the handles h pi i to a collar of y r y this shows that w has the promised handle decomposition near a plumbing point critical level of type b suppose d is a 2 disk embedded in a 3 manifold m and l is a 1 submanifold in m which is disjoint from d and meets d at a single transverse intersection point in the 4 manifold m i let b l i d 0 1 2 d 1 2 let eb m i r b and el d m r l d be the exteriors proposition 4 10 the 4 manifold eb is diffeomorphic to el d i unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 22 proof we proceed similarly to the proof of proposition 4 8 let y l d be a regular neighborhood in m and choose regular neighborhoods y l and y l d which are contained in the interior of y then eb is diffeomorphic to the 4 manifold described in 4 1 of lemma 4 9 since d intersects l at one point y l and y r y is just a collar of y y r y by lemma 4 9 it follows that eb el d i without adding any handle near punctured surfaces critical levels of type r and s we also need the following two cases first we consider a horizontal punctured disk described as follows suppose is a planar surface embedded in a 3 manifold m let be a boundary component of and r we assume both and are nonempty consider the surface r 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 embedded in m i let er m i r r and e m r be the exteriors proposition 4 11 the 4 manifold er has a handle decomposition er e i k 1 2 handles where k is the number of components of the proof will be given together with that of proposition 4 12 which treats a vertical punctured sheet described as follows suppose c is a 1 submanifold in a 3 manifold m and a is an annulus embedded in m with two boundary circles 0 a 1 a such that j 0 a c is an arc and a r j is disjoint from c let j 0 ar j and c c r j j let s c 0 1 2 c a 1 2 c 1 a 1 2 1 m i note that s is homeomorphic to c i with a disk removed and embedded in m i in such a way that the boundary of the removed disk appears as a circle 1 a 1 see the schematic picture in figure 14 let es m i r s and ec m r c be the exteriors c 0 c 1 a 1 2 1 a 1 figure 14 an embedded punctured sheet proposition 4 12 the 4 manifold es has a handle decomposition es ec i 2 handle unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 23 proofs of propositions 4 11 and 4 12 since r and s are embedded submanifolds we can apply the standard embedded morse theory to obtain a handle decomposition of the exteriors e g see gs 99 proposition 6 2 1 briefly in our case a p handle of the submanifold corresponds to a p 1 handle of the exterior since r i k 1 1 handles er has a handle decomposition with k 1 2 handles as claimed since s c i 1 handle es has a handle decomposition with a 2 handle as claimed alternatively one may use lemma 4 9 similarly to the proofs of propositions 4 8 and 4 10 the attaching circles for each case are shown in figure 15 y attaching circles y c a attaching circle figure 15 regular neighborhoods of and c a we are now almost ready for the proof of theorem 4 7 for clarity in the proof we will use the following definition definition 4 13 suppose m is a 3 manifold we say that a 2 complex g in m i is abrs admissible if for some 0 t 1 tr 1 and 0 the following hold 1 g m j is an isotopy of a 1 submanifold in m for each subinterval j 0 t 1 t 1 t 2 tr 1 tr and tr 1 2 for each i g m ti ti is the disjoint union of l ti ti and a 2 complex z where l is a link in m and z is of the form of either a b r or s in propositions 4 8 4 10 4 11 and 4 12 we call each m ti a critical level of type a b r or s the following are basic observations on the abrs admissibility of capped gropes 1 for a height n satellite capped grope g in s 3 i obtained by pushing a 3 d satellite capped grope g 0 for k we may assume that g k i e i is abrs admissible for instance choose sufficiently small 0 and push a height k surface s e e 0 in g 0 to s k 1 k s k e i 1 k n for a cap c in g 0 which intersects m times k transversely let be the corresponding punctured cap that is is a planar surface contained in c such that does not intersect k and where c and are m meridional curves m i 1 i of k then push c to n n 1 n 1 n 1 n 2 a in e i where a m i 1 i n 2 n 2 i di n 2 i for a planar meridional disk di with boundary i push the remaining caps further in a similar way in this case we use types a b and r unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 24 2 we may assume that a capped grope concordance in s 3 i obtained by pushing a 3 d capped grope concordance is abrs admissible by a similar isotopy critical levels have types a b r and s 3 if g and h are satellite capped gropes for k and j such that g k i e i and h j i e i are abrs admissible then g h k j i e i is abrs admissible it is verified straghtforwardly by inspecting definition 4 2 in this case we use type r when we attach gropes to a punctured cap of another grope 4 if g is a satellite capped grope for k such that g k i e i is abrs admissible and h is an abrs admissible capped grope concordance in s 3 i then g h is an abrs admissible capped grope concordance it is verified straghtforwardly by inspecting definition 4 4 in general we need all the types a b r and s proof of theorem 4 7 repeatedly applying the above observations it follows that the given product g g 1 gn h is an abrs admissible capped grope concordance in s 3 i this is true for any choice of parenthesization of the product near each critical level s 3 ti apply one of propositions 4 8 4 10 4 11 and 4 12 to obtain 2 handles here writing g s 3 ti ti l ti ti z as in definition 4 13 we apply the proposition to z in the product el ti ti stacking them we obtain a desired handle decomposition of eg with only 2 handles added to ek i 5 knots in s 3 sliced by unknotted whitney towers and gropes 5 1 whitney tower and grope bi filtrations we begin by recalling the classical notion of doubly slice knots in what follows regard s 3 s 4 in the standard way definition 5 1 a knot k in s 3 is doubly slice if there is an unknotted flat 2 sphere embedded in s 4 which intersects s 3 transversely at k considering our whitney tower and grope generalizations of unknotted 2 spheres we are naturally led to the following generalization denote by d 4 and d 4 the upper and lower hemispheres of s 4 bounded by s 3 definition 5 2 1 we say that a knot k in s 3 is a slice of a whitney tower t in s 4 if the base sphere of t intersects s 3 transversely and k t s 3 in this case each t t d 4 is a disk like whitney tower bounded by k 2 for half integers m n 1 a knot k in s 3 is a height m n whitney slice if it is a slice of a 1 unknotted sphere like whitney tower t in s 4 such that t and t have height m and n respectively we denote by wm n the set of height m n whitney slice knots a knot k is height m whitney doubly slice if k wm m define a height m n grope slice knot and a height m grope doubly slice knot by replacing whitney towers with capped gropes denote by gm n the set of height m n grope slice knots using a seifert van kampen argument one can show that wm n and gm n are closed under connected sum that is wm n and gm n are submonoids of the monoid of knots by unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 25 propositions 2 10 and 2 13 we have wk wm n and gk gm n for k m and n therefore we obtain bi filtrations wm n and gm n of the monoid of knots which we call the whitney tower bi filtration and the grope bi filtration respectively the whitney tower and grope cases are related as follows in this context theorem 5 3 a height m n grope slice knot is height m n whitney slice that is gm n wm n proof suppose k is a slice of a 1 unknotted capped grope g in s 4 and g g d 4 and g g d 4 have height m and n respectively apply theorem 3 1 to transform g to a 1 unknotted whitney tower t since the disk like whitney towers t are obtained from the capped gropes g see remark 3 3 it follows that t and t have height m and n respectively as in corollary 3 2 5 2 construction of examples in this subsection using the results of section 4 we construct certain examples of knots which are height m n grope slice and consequently height m n whitney slice by theorem 5 3 in the next section a particular subfamily of those examples will be shown to be not doubly slice furthermore the examples will be used to exhibit the rich structure of the whitney tower and grope bi filtrations we start with the following input data fix nonnegative integersm n suppose j 0 is a knot and for each k 0 m 2 suppose kk k is a pair of a knot kk and a simple closed curve k in the exterior ekk which is unknotted in s 3 suppose the following g 1 there is a 3 d capped grope concordance of height 2 between j 0 and the unknot g 2 the knot kk is ribbon and there is a 3 d satellite capped grope of height 1 for kk k for each k we remark that there are numerous examples satisfying the above we will specify explicit choices in later sections let r be the knot 946 and let and be the curves depicted in figure 16 see hor 10 figure 7 define a knot jk 1 inductively for k 0 by jk 1 kk k jk finally define jm n r jm 1 jn 1 r jm 1 jn 1 to be the knot obtained by applying the satellite construction twice once along using jm 1 as the companion and then along using jn 1 as the companion theorem 5 4 if g 1 and g 2 hold then the knot jm n is height m 2 n 2 grope slice and consequently height m 2 n 2 whitney slice by theorem 5 3 proof let j jm n for brevity first we construct a disk like capped grope of height m 2 with boundary j in d 4 in what follows u designates a trivial knot let r r u jn 1 r jn 1 then we can view j as j r jm 1 let l 0 u and lk 1 kk k lk for k 0 let r r lm 1 jn 1 r lm 1 figure 16 depicts a 3 d satellite capped grope for r after the satellite operation along it becomes a 3 d satellite capped grope of height 1 for r push this into s 3 i to obtain a satellite capped grope which we denote by hm 1 push those given unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 26 r figure 16 the knot r 946 and 3 d satellite capped gropes bounded by and the curves and are dual to the left and right handles of the genus one seifert surface in g 1 and g 2 to obtain a height 2 capped grope concordance h between j 0 and u and a height 1 satellite capped grope hk of kk k for k 0 m 2 let p hm 1 hm 2 h 0 h this is a capped grope concordance of height m 2 between j and r by theorem 4 7 the exterior ep has a handle decomposition ep ej i 2 handles also the construction of the product see section 4 1 tells us that ej is isotopic in ep to er the same conclusion holds for a parallel of as well since each kk is ribbon and l 0 is the unknot it follows that each lk is ribbon by an induction therefore there is a ribbon concordance say q from r r lm 1 to r r u the obvious genus one seifert surface for r see figure 16 becomes a genus one seifert surface for r after the satellite operation if we cut the right band whose linking circle is the curve of the seifert surface by attaching a band r becomes a 2 component trivial link this gives us a genus zero cobordism between r and a 2 component trivial link cap off the latter to obtain a ribbon disk in d 4 for r in this paper a ribbon disk in d 4 designates a slice disk obtained by pushing an immersed ribbon disk in s 3 note that parallels of and in er are null homotopic in e identify a collar of s 3 in the upper hemisphere d 4 with s 3 0 2 so that d 4 s 3 0 2 d 4 where s 3 0 is the boundary of d 4 view p q and as subsets of s 3 0 1 s 3 1 2 and d 4 respectively let g p r q r d 4 then g is a disk like capped grope of height m 2 in d 4 with boundary j the following hold unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 27 i the exterior eg is obtained from ej i by attaching handles of index 2 ii the curves and ej are null homotopic in d 4 rg the condition i follows from that eg is obtained by stacking ep eq and e each of which has handles of index 2 only the condition ii for holds since ej is isotopic to er in ep eq and er is null homotopic in e the same argument works for as well similarly to the above construct a disk like capped grope g of height n 2 in d 4 with boundary j which satisfies the following i the exterior eg is obtained from ej i by attaching handles of index 2 ii the curves and ej are null homotopic in d 4 rg finally let g g j g in s 4 d 4 s 3 d 4 then g is a sphere like capped grope in s 4 which intersects s 3 at the knot j the only remaining thing to show is that g is 1 unknotted that is 1 s 4 rg z by seifert van kampen 1 s 4 rg 1 eg 1 ej 1 eg from i it follows that each inclusion induced map 1 ej 1 eg is surjective therefore 1 s 4 rg is a quotient of 1 ej from ii it follows that and are null homotopic in 1 s 4 rg therefore 1 s 4 r g is a quotient of 1 ej where denotes the normal subgroup generated by recall that and are identified with the meridians of jm 1 and jn 1 respectively by seifert van kampen it follows that 1 ej 1 ej im 1 ejm 1 1 ejn 1 1 er consequently 1 ej is isomorphic to 1 er which is a quotient of z since 1 er z therefore 1 s 4 r g is a quotient of z since h 1 s 4 r g z it follows that 1 s 4 rg z 6 obstructions to grope and whitney doubly slicing in this section we give examples illustrating the rich structure of the grope and whitney tower bi filtrations the main result of this section is the following theorem 6 1 1 for any integer m 3 there exists a family of slice knots j i i 1 2 such that each j i is height m grope doubly slice but any nontrivial linear combination of the j i is not height m 5 whitney doubly slice 2 for any integers m n 3 there exists a family of knots j im n i 1 2 such that each j im n is height m n grope slice but any nontrivial linear combination of the j im n is not height m 5 n whitney slice and not height m n 5 whitney slice the above theorem is proved in a stronger form in theorem 6 10 since height m n grope slice knots are height m n whitney slice theorem 5 3 it follows that both grope and whitney tower bi filtrations gm n and wm n are highly nontrivial the examples j i and j im n in theorem 6 1 will be obtained by the construction in section 5 2 theorem 5 4 will tell us the promised grope whitney sliceness to show that the examples and their linear combinations are not grope whitney slice we will first relate the grope whitney sliceness to the m n solvability stuided in kim 06 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 28 in section 6 1 and then use amenable 2 invariant techniques developed in co 12 cha 14 a cha 14 b in sections 6 2 6 3 and 6 4 6 1 m n solvable knots in kim 06 the second author introduced the notion of m n solvable knots which is a generalization of a doubly slice knot since its definition is lengthy we will first state the main result of this subsection and then describe necessary terms theorem 6 2 a height m 2 n 2 whitney slice knot is m n solvable to define an m n solvable knot we need to recall the notion of an n solvable knot defined in cot 03 from which the former was inspired for a group g and n 0 the nth derived subgroup g n is defined by g 0 g and g n g n 1 g n 1 for n 1 definition 6 3 cot 03 suppose n is a nonnegative integer m is a closed 3 manifold with h 1 m z and w is a compact spin 4 manifold with boundary m let 1 w 1 w is an n solution for m if the inclusion induces an isomorphism h 1 m h 1 w and there exist x 1 xr and y 1 yr in h 2 w z n with r 1 2 rankzh 2 w such that the intersection form and self intersection form n h 2 w z n h 2 w z n z n n h 2 w z n z n a a have values n xi xj n xi 0 and n xi yj ij for all i and j 2 w is an n 5 solution for m if w satisfies 1 and in addition the xi have lifts x i h 2 w z n 1 such that n 1 x i x j n 1 x i 0 for all i and j 3 a knot k is h solvable h 1 2 z 0 if the zero surgery m k has an h solution we denote by fn the subgroup of the concordance classes of n solvable knots since an m solvable knot is n solvable for m n the subgroups fn with n 1 2 z 0 form a descending filtration of the knot concordance group definition 6 4 kim 06 definitions 2 2 2 3 and 6 2 suppose m n 1 2 z 0 and m is a closed 3 manifold with h 1 m z 1 a pair w 1 w 2 of compact 4 manifolds wi bounded by m is an m n solution form ifw 1 is anm solution form w 2 is an n solution form and 1 w 1 m w 2 is an infinite cyclic group 2 a knot k is m n solvable if there is an m n solution w 1 w 2 for the zero surgery m k 3 we call an m m solution a double m solution we also call an m m solvable knot or 3 manifold doubly m solvable we denote by fm n the set of isotopy classes of m n solvable knots by kim 06 proposition 2 6 each fm n is a submonoid under connected sum and since an m solution for a knot k is an n solution for m n it is obvious that fk fm n for k m and n therefore fm n is a bi filtration of the monoid of knots we call it the solvable bi filtration of knots theorems 5 3 and 6 2 tell us that gm 2 n 2 wm 2 n 2 fm n due to cot 03 theorem 8 11 a height h 2 whitney tower in d 4 bounded by a knot k in s 3 can be transformed to an h solution for k here we show that this can be done in such a way that the fundamental group does not grow unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 29 theorem 6 5 suppose t is a disk like whitney tower of height h 2 in d 4 bounded by a knot k in s 3 then there is an h solutionw for k with an epimorphism 1 d 4 rt 1 w making the following diagram commute 1 s 3 rk j i 1 d 4 r t 1 w where i and j are homomorphisms induced from inclusions our construction of the h solution in theorem 6 5 is slightly different from that in cot 03 theorem 8 12 proof write h n or n 5 with n an integer the top stage disks of t have height n 2 if h n height n 3 if h n 5 for each whitney disk di of height n 2 choose a parallel copy of di in the interior of di and perform surgery on d 4 along the parallel copy using the framing induced by di let v be the 4 manifold obtained by surgery using the surgery core disk as an embedded whitney disk for the whitney circle di do whitney moves to make height n 1 whitney disks embedded in v repeating this inductively for height n 2 1 the base disk of t is changed to an embedded disk in v let w v r the exterior of in v let t 0 be the subtower of t which consists of height n 1 whitney disks and let t be the whitney tower of height n 2 in v obtained from t 0 by adding the surgery core disks as height n 2 disks by proposition 2 10 1 d 4 rt 0 is a quotient of 1 d 4 rt a seifert van kampen argument shows that 1 d 4 r t 0 1 v r t by applying lemma 2 9 repeatedly 1 v r t 1 v r it follows that 1 v r is a quotient of 1 d 4 r t we claim that w is an h solution for k the spin structure of d 4 gives rise to a spin structure onw since the base disk of t induces the zero framing on its boundary k and whitney moves do not alter this framing we have w m k the zero surgery on k in s 3 since the surgery on d 4 is performed along null homotopic curves h 2 v z 2 k where k is the number of height n 2 whitney disks di from the long exact sequence for v w it follows that h 2 w h 2 v z 2 k the union of dir collar of di and the surgery core disk bounded by di is an immersed sphere in w which we denote by si choose a clifford torus ti around one of the two intersections paired by the whitney disk di then si ti i 1 k is a basis for h 2 w a basis curve on ti is a meridian of a height n 1 disk d a clifford torus t around an intersection paired with another intersection by d meets d at one point and the basis curves of t are meridians of height n disks it follows that is a commutator of meridians of height n disks repeating the same argument inductively for height n 2 1 it follows that is an element in the nth derived subgroup n where 1 w thus the clifford torus ti lifts to the n cover of w and represents a homology class ti h 2 w z n to complete the proof we now consider the two cases of h n and h n 5 sepa rately for h n since the tori ti are framed and pairwise disjoint n ti 0 and n ti tj 0 for any i j since si meets ti at one point and disjoint from tj for j 6 i n ti sj ij for h n 5 consider the homology classes si h 2 w z n 1 since the sphere si are framed n si 0 recall that the intersections of the height n 2 disks are paired up by height n 3 disks in d 4 since the height n 3 disks are disjoint unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 30 from height n 1 disks the height n 3 disks lie in v and pair up intersections of the immersed spheres si it follows that n 1 si sj 0 for any i j as above n si tj ij now we are ready for the proof of theorem 6 2 proof of theorem 6 2 suppose a knotk in s 3 is sliced by a 1 unknotted whitney tower t in s 4 whose upper half t t d 4 and lower half t t d 4 have heightm 2 and n 2 respectively apply theorem 6 5 to t and t to obtain an m solution w and an n solution w such that 1 w and 1 w are homomorphic images of 1 d 4 r t and 1 d 4 r t respectively since z 1 s 4 r t 1 d 4 r t 1 s 3 rk 1 d 4 r t it follows that 1 w m k w 1 w 1 m k 1 w is a quotient of z since h 1 w m k w z it follows that 1 w m k w z therefore w w is an m n solution 6 2 amenable signature theorem and mixed commutator series we recall some results on the von neumann cheeger gromov 2 invariant for a closed 3 manifold and mixed commutator series in cha 14 a let m be a closed 3 manifold and 1 m g a group homomorphism suppose there is a 4 manifoldw bounded by m such that extends to 1 w g then the von neumann cheeger gromov 2 invariant associated to m is defined to be 2 m sign 2 g w sign w r where sign 2 g w and sign w denote the l 2 signature of w associated to and the ordinary signature of w respectively we refer the reader to cha 16 for more about l 2 signatures and 2 invariants the following lemma gives a universal bound on the 2 invariants lemma 6 6 cha 16 theorem 1 9 if m is the zero surgery on a knot with crossing number n then 2 m 69713280 n for all homomorphisms the following is the 2 invariant obstruction for a knot to being n 5 solvable which we will use in section 6 4 although we use the most general known term amenable group lying in d r in the statement we do not define it here precise definitions can be found from cha 14 a as well as pat 88 str 74 since we will use theorem 6 7 only for the class of groups described in lemma 6 9 below theorem 6 7 cha 14 a theorem 3 2 let k be an n 5 solvable knot let g be an amenable group lying in d r for r zp or q with g n 1 e suppose 1 m k g is a homomorphism which extends to an n 5 solution for m k and sends a meridian to an infinite order element in g then 2 m k 0 definition 6 8 cha 14 a definition 4 1 let g be a group and p r 0 r 1 be a sequence of rings with unity the p mixed coefficient commutator series pkg is defined inductively by p 0 g g and pk 1 g ker pkg pkg pkg pkg pkg pkg pkg z rk h 1 g rk g p kg unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 31 for instance if rk z for all k then p kg is the standard derived series of g that is pkg g k if rk q for all k then p kg is the rational derived series of g the lemma below immediately follows from cha 14 a lemma 4 3 lemma 6 9 let n be a positive integer and g a group let p r 0 r 1 rn with rk q for k n and rn zp for a prime p then the group g p n 1 g is amenable and lies in d zp 6 3 non triviality of the bi filtrations in this subsection we prove the following theorem 6 10 let m and n be positive integers 1 there exists a family of slice knots j i i 1 2 in gm 2 m 2 whose arbitrary non trivial linear combinations are not in fm 5 m 5 2 there exists a family of knots j im n i 1 2 in gm 2 n 2 whose arbitrary non trivial linear combinations are not in fm 5 n fm n 5 from this it follows that there are infinitely many linearly independent knots at each level of the grope whitney tower and solvable bi filtrations of knots since gm 2 n 2 wm 2 n 2 fm n by theorems 5 3 and 6 2 in particular theorem 6 1 follows immedi ately from theorem 6 10 we remark that theorem 6 10 generalizes theorem 1 1 in kim 06 proof of theorem 6 10 we will prove 2 first since fk f k we may assumem n for each i 1 construct a knot j im n as described in section 5 2 using the knot r 946 and the following choices for kk k and j 0 j i 0 in addition to g 1 and g 2 in section 5 2 suppose the following n 1 each kk has a cyclic alexander module generated by k for convenience we take the same k as kk k for all k n 2 for the knot k in n 1 above let ak be the top coefficient of the alexander polynomial of k and let ck be a constant such that 2 m k ck for all homomorphisms 1 m k g given by lemma 6 6 then j i 0 are knots obtained by lemma 6 11 below with c 0 m 1 ck and a ak lemma 6 11 jan 17 proposition 3 4 for any constants c 0 and a there exist knots j 10 j 2 0 and an increasing sequence of primes a p 1 p 2 which satisfy the following letting i e 2 1 pi a primitive pi th root of unity 1 there is a 3 d capped grope concordance of height 2 between j i 0 and the unknot 2 pi 1 r 0 ji 0 r i c 0 and 3 pj 1 r 0 ji 0 r j 0 for j i in lemma 6 11 condition 1 is needed to satisfy g 1 condition 2 is needed to make each j im n nontrivial modulo fm 5 n fm n 5 and 3 is needed to have any nontrivial linear combination of j im n not in fm 5 n fm n 5 for instance take the knot 61 stevedore s knot as k kk and take the curve shown in figure 17 as k for all k in this case ck 418279680 note that k is a ribbon knot and has a cyclic alexander module z t 1 2 t 2 5 t 2 generated by and there is a 3 d satellite capped grope of height 1 for k as in figure 17 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 32 k figure 17 the knot k 61 and a satellite capped grope proof of lemma 6 11 for each m 1 let pm be the knot in hor 10 p 756 which generalizes the knot in ct 07 figure 3 6 the levine tristram signature function pm of the knot pm is pm e 2 1 2 if m 0 if 0 m where m is uniquely determined by the conditions 0 m and cos m 2 3 m 1 2 3 m see hor 10 section 4 since m is a decreasing sequence converging to 0 there are integers mi and primes pi such that a p 1 and mi 1 2 pi mi for all i choose an integern such that n c 4 and let j i 0 be a connected sum ofn copies of pmi 1 pmi for each i then j i 0 satisfy the conditions 2 and 3 in hor 10 proposition 3 1 it is shown that in s 3 0 1 there is a capped grope concordance of height 2 between pm and the unknot in fact this capped grope concordance is a 3 d capped grope concordance see figure 5 in hor 10 from this observation one can easily see that there is a 3 d capped grope concordance of height 2 between j i 0 and the unknot now we have knots j im n which satisfy g 1 g 2 n 1 and n 2 by theorem 5 4 we have j im n gm 2 n 2 for each i let j iaij i m n ai z be a nontrivial linear combination of j im n we will show that j is neither m 5 n solvable nor m n 5 solvable we may assume that there are finitely many summands j im n and all coefficients ai are nonzero by taking j if necessary we may assume a 1 0 let c be the standard cobordism between aim j i m n andm j obtained by following the method in cot 04 p 113 let u v be an m n solution for j we define uc c m j u vc c m j v in particular uc vc ai m j im n and we seem j 1 m n as a boundary component of uc and vc recall that and are the curves in the exterior of r which are shown in figure 16 let 1 and 1 be the curves in m j 1 m n which are the images of the parallel copies of and under the satellite construction with the pattern r for r q or zp with p an odd prime we have the following h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 m r r t 1 p q unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 33 where p 1 r t 1 2 t 1 and q 1 r t 1 t 2 this can be verified by straightforward computation alternatively one may invoke proposition 6 14 which is stated in section 6 4 lemma 6 12 let r q or zp with p an odd prime let u v be an m n solution for j let uc and vc be defined as above let i h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 uc r t 1 and j h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 vc r t 1 be inclusion induced homomorphisms then either i 1 6 0 j 1 6 0 or j 1 6 0 i 1 6 0 the proof of lemma 6 12 is postponed to section 6 4 the next proposition is a crucial technical result below we use the convention that j im 0 r j im 1 unknot and j i 0 n r unknot j in 1 proposition 6 13 let m n 0 let r q or zp 1 let w be a compact 4 manifold with boundary m j let wc c m j w let inc h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 wc r t 1 be the inclusion induced homomorphism then the following hold 1 if m 1 and inc 1 6 0 then w is not an m 5 solution for j 2 if n 1 and inc 1 6 0 then w is not an n 5 solution for j we postpone the proof of proposition 6 13 to section 6 4 suppose j is m 5 n solvable via u v we apply proposition 6 13 for w u and inc i h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 uc r t 1 since u is an m 5 solution for j by proposition 6 13 1 we have i 1 0 then by lemma 6 12 we have j 1 6 0 and i 1 6 0 since i 1 6 0 by proposition 6 13 2 u is not an n 5 solution for j since m n this implies that u is not an m 5 solution for j which is a contradiction next we prove that j is not m n 5 solvable since fk f k and it has been shown that j is not m 5 n solvable we may assume m n suppose j is m n 5 solvable via u v by applying proposition 6 13 2 for w v and inc j h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 vc r t 1 we have j 1 0 then by lemma 6 12 we have i 1 6 0 then by applying proposition 6 13 2 for w u and inc i h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 uc r t 1 it follows that u is not an n 5 solution for j but since m n this contradicts that u is an m solution for j this completes the proof of theorem 6 10 2 to prove theorem 6 10 1 we use an argument similar to the proof of theorem 6 10 2 choose kk k and j i 0 as in the proof of theorem 6 10 2 let j i r j im 1 where r and j im 1 are those given and defined in section 5 2 then each j i is ribbon in particular slice since it bounds a ribbon disk say obtained by cutting the band dual to let g be a capped grope of height n 2 in d 4 bounded by j i obtained by replacing a sufficiently small disk in the interior of by a model disk like capped grope of height m 2 then there is an epimorphism 1 s 3 r j i 1 d 4 rg induced from the inclusion since and g have homeomorphic exteriors in d 4 now by theorem 5 4 and its proof where we use g d 4 instead of g d 4 we can see j i gm 2 m 2 suppose j iaij i is a nontrivial linear combination we will show that j is not doubly m 5 solvable as before we may assume that there are finitely many summands j i and all the coefficients ai are nonzero by taking j if necessary we may assume a 1 0 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 34 suppose j is doubly m 5 solvable via u v let 1 be the curve in m j 1 which is the image of a parallel copy of the curve under the satellite construction with the pattern r for r q or zp 1 let i and j be the inclusion induced homomorphisms as in the proof of the statement 2 by lemma 6 12 we have i 1 6 0 or j 1 6 0 by exchanging u and v if necessary we may assume that i 1 6 0 note that j i r j im 1 unknot j i m 0 with m 1 therefore by proposition 6 13 1 u is not an m 5 solution which is a contradiction this completes the proof of theorem 6 10 modulo the proofs of lemma 6 12 and proposition 6 13 6 4 proofs of lemma 6 12 and proposition 6 13 in this subsection we prove lemma 6 12 and proposition 6 13 for this purpose we need the following splitting result for doubly 1 solvable knots let r q or zp for a knot k the blanchfield form b h 1 m k r t 1 h 1 m k r t 1 r t r t 1 is defined bla 57 for a submodule p of h 1 m k r t 1 define p x h 1 m k r t 1 b x y 0 for all y p we say that p is self annihilating with respect to b if p p we have the following proposition proposition 6 14 kim 06 proposition 2 10 for r q and z let r q or zp let k be a knot which is doubly 1 solvable via w 1 w 2 let pi be the kernel of the inclusion induced homomorphism h 1 m k r t 1 h 1 wi r t 1 for i 1 2 then h 1 m k r t 1 p 1 p 2 as r t 1 modules and each pi is self annihilating with respect to the blanchfield form now we are ready to prove lemma 6 12 proof of lemma 6 12 recall that r q or zp using a mayer vietoris sequence we obtain h 1 c r t 1 h 1 c r t 1 h 1 c r t 1 where c m j c aim j i m n and the isomorphisms are induced by the inclu sions therefore via the isomorphisms we can considerh 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 as a submod ule of h 1 m j r t 1 using mayer vietoris sequences it follows that h 1 u r t 1 h 1 uc r t 1 and h 1 v r t 1 h 1 vc r t 1 since m n 1 u v is a double 1 solution form j therefore by proposition 6 14 h 1 m j r t 1 ker iu ker j v where i u h 1 m j r t 1 h 1 u r t 1 and jv h 1 m j r t 1 h 1 v r t 1 are inclusion induced homomorphisms suppose i 1 j 1 0 considering h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 as a submodule of h 1 m j r t 1 this implies that iu 1 j v 1 0 since h 1 m j r t 1 ker iu ker j v and 1 is a nontrivial element of h 1 m j r t 1 this is a contradiction therefore we cannot have i 1 j 1 0 with a similar reason we cannot have i 1 j 1 0 since m n 1 the knots j im n are 1 solvable let w i be a 1 solution for m j im n for each i let w ir be a copy of w i unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 35 m j 1 m n w ir w i r w i r m j im n m j i m n c m j u figure 18 the cobordism u 1 as in figure 18 we define u 1 u m j c c rm j 1 m n ai 1 w 1 r i 2 aiw i r then u 1 m j 1 m n let i 1 h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 h 1 u 1 r t 1 be the inclusion induced homomorphism since u is an m solution it is also a 1 solution using mayer vietoris sequences one can show that u 1 is a 1 solution for m j 1 m n it is known that ker i 1 is a self annihilating submodule ofh 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 cot 03 theorem 4 4 therefore ker i 1 is a proper submodule since h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 is gen erated by 1 and 1 it follows that we cannot have i 1 i 1 0 similarly we cannot have j 1 j 1 0 now suppose i 1 0 since we can have neither i 1 j 1 0 nor i 1 i 1 0 it follows j 1 6 0 and i 1 6 0 next suppose j 1 0 using similar arguments we can easily see that i 1 6 0 and j 1 6 0 suppose the remaining case i 1 6 0 and j 1 6 0 since we cannot have i 1 j 1 0 either i 1 6 0 or j 1 6 0 in either case the conclusion of the theorem holds in the proof of proposition 6 13 we will use the following fact proposition 6 15 cha 14 a proposition 4 10 suppose the arf invariant of j 0 van ishes and let jm n be the knot constructed in section 5 2 then there exist an m solution u and an n solution v for jm n satisfying the following 1 if 1 m jm n g is a homomorphism which extends to u and g is an amenable group lying in d r for some ring r with unity then 2 m jm n 2 m j 0 where 1 m j 0 zd is a surjection and d is the order of the image of the meridian of j 0 under in g m the same statement holds when u and g m are replaced by v and g n 2 for r q and zp with p an odd prime h 1 u r t 1 r t 1 2 t 1 generated by the curve 1 and h 1 v r t 1 r t 1 t 2 generated by the curve 1 the statement 1 follows immediately from cha 14 a proposition 4 10 and the state ment 2 is implicitly proven in the proof of cha 14 a proposition 4 10 now we give a proof of proposition 6 13 proof of proposition 6 13 to prove 1 we will construct a certain 4 manifold with bound ary m j 10 the building blocks for the construction are as follows 1 let u i be the m solution for m j im n given in proposition 6 15 2 let e be the exterior in d 4 of the slice disk for r r j 1 n 1 in which is null homotopic where the slice disk is obtained by cutting the band dual to unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 36 3 recallingkk 1 kk k jk let ek be the standard cobordism betweenm j 1 k m kk and m kk 1 that is letting e j 1 k denote the exterior of j 1 k

linking longitude of j ik is identified with the 0 linking longitude resp the meridian of k see chl 09 p 1429 4 let e m 1 be the standard cobordism between m j 1 m 1 m r and m j 1 m n constructed similarly to 3 noting that j 1 m n r j 1 m 1 5 let c be the standard cobordism from aim j i m n to m j as defined in the proof of theorem 6 10 let u ir be a copy of u i we define wm w m j c c rm j 1 m n ai 1 u 1 r i 2 aiu i r then wm m j 1 m n we define wm 1 wm m j 1 m n e m 1 m r e then wm 1 m j 1 m 1 finally for k m 2 m 3 0 as in figure 19 we define wk ek m j 1 k 1 wk 1 ek m j 1 k 1 ek 1 m j 1 k

the cobordism wk let p r 0 r 1 rm be a sequence of rings where rk q for 0 k m 1 and rm zp 1 then for a group g we get the p mixed coefficient commutator series pkg for k 0 1 m 1 as in definition 6 8 the following lemma is essentially due to cha 14 a theorem 4 14 lemma 6 16 cha 14 a theorem 4 14 rename j 1 m j 1 m n for brevity suppose inc 1 6 0 as in the hypothesis of proposition 6 13 1 for k 0 1 m the homomorphism k 1 wk 1 wk p m k 1 1 wk unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 37 sends the meridian of j 1 k into the abelian subgroup p m k 1 wk p m k 1 1 wk further more the image of the meridian of j 1 k under k has order p 1 if k 0 and is of infinite order if k 0 we postpone the proof of lemma 6 16 to the end of this section and finish the proof of proposition 6 13 let g 1 w 0 p m 1 1 w 0 in particular g m 1 e by lemma 6 9 the group g is amenable and lies in d zp 1 now we have the canonical homomorphism 1 w 0 g and by abuse of notation we denote by restrictions of to subspaces of w 0 for a 4 manifold x with a homomorphism 1 x g we let sg x sign 2 g x sign x the l 2 signature defect since w 0 m j 1 0 m 2 k 0 m kk using the definition of 2 invariants in section 6 2 we have 2 w 0 2 m j 10 m 2 k 0 2 m kk sg w 0 on the other hand using novikov additivity we have sg w 0 sg w sg c i bi r 1 sg u i r sg e m 1 sg e m 2 k 0 sg ek here we use the convention that m 2 k 0 2 m kk m 2 k 0 sg ek 0 if m 1 we compute each term of these equalities below 1 2 m j 10 p 1 1 r 0 j 10 r 1 0 where 1 e 2 1 p 1 and j 1 0 is the levine tristram signature function for j 10 by lemma 6 16 the image of the merid ian of j 10 under has order p 1 and in this case it is known that 2 m j 10 p 1 1 r 0 j 10 r 1 0 see cot 04 proposition 5 1 and fri 05 corollary 4 3 the last inequality follows from lemma 6 11 2 2 sg c 0 by cot 04 lemma 4 2 3 sg u 1 r is 0 or p 1 1 r 0 j 10 r 1 since g m 1 e the subgroup g m is abelian by our choice of the ring rm zp 1 the group g m is a vector space over zp 1 and hence every element in g m has order either 1 or p 1 by propo sition 6 15 sg u 1 r sg u 1 2 m j 10 where 1 m j 1 0 zp 1 is a homomorphism if is trivial then 2 m j 10 0 and otherwise 2 m j 10 p 1 1 r 0 j 10 r 1 as calculated in 1 above 4 sg u i r 0 for i 1 with the same reason in 3 we have sg u i r is 0 or p 1 1 r 0 ji 0 r 1 but by lemma 6 11 3 we have p 1 1 r 0 ji 0 r 1 0 for i 1 5 sg e 0 since e is a slice disk exterior we have h 2 e 0 there fore sign e 0 by cha 08 lemma 2 7 sign 2 g e rankzh 2 e 0 therefore sign 2 g e 0 6 sg e m 1 sg ek 0 for all k due to chl 09 lemma 2 4 from these computations we conclude that p 1 1 r 0 j 1 0 r 1 m 2 k 0 2 m kk sg w for some constant 1 unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 38 suppose w is an m 5 solution for j then by theorem 6 7 we have sg w 0 but this leads us to a contradiction since kk k for all k and by our choice of j 1 0 we have p 1 1 r 0 j 10 r 1 m 1 ck on the other hand m 2 k 0 2 m kk m 1 ck this completes the proof of the statement 1 modulo the proof of lemma 6 16 the statement 2 can be proved using arguments similar to the one for the state ment 1 now we finish the proof of proposition 6 13 by proving lemma 6 16 proof of lemma 6 16 the proof is essentially identical to the one of cha 14 a theo rem 4 14 the only difference occurs at the first step where we use e m 1 m r e instead of em 1 to construct wm 1 from wm and we only need to show that p 1 1 wm 1 p 2 1 wm 1 p 1 1 wm p 2 1 wm let w wm m j 1 m n e m 1 then using exactly the same argument as in the proof of assertion 1 in cha 14 a p 4799 one can show that 1 w 1 w 2 1 wm 1 w 2 m therefore we have p 1 1 w p 2 1 w p 1 1 wm p 2 1 wm sincewm 1 w m r e and 1 e 1 m r where denotes the sub group normally generated by by seifert van kampen we obtain 1 wm 1 1 w for the moment suppose p 2 1 w then since p 2 1 w maps into p 2 1 wm 1 we have p 1 1 w p 2 1 w p 1 1 wm 1 p 2 1 wm 1 and therefore p 1 1 wm 1 p 2 1 wm 1 p 1 1 wm p 2 1 wm therefore it suffices to show p 2 1 w note that is isotopic to 1 m j 1 m n in e m 1 and again it suffices to show 1 p 2 1 wm using mayer vietoris sequences one can show thatwm is a 1 solution for j 1 m n noting r 1 zp 1 if m 1 and q if m 1 by cot 03 theorem 4 4 it is known that ker i is a self annihilating submodule of h 1 m j 1 m n r 1 t 1 where i h 1 m j 1 m n r 1 t 1 h 1 wm r 1 t 1 is the inclusion induced homomorphism therefore ker i p 1 or ker i q 1 recall that wc c m j w and wm wc c rm j 1 m n ai 1 u 1 r i 2 aiu i r since u ir u i where u i has been obtained using proposition 6 15 we haveh 1 u i r r t 1 r t 1 2 t 1 therefore using mayer vietoris sequences one can see that the inclusion induced homomorphism h 1 wc r t 1 h 1 wm r t 1 is a surjection whose kernel is t 2 torsion since 1 is 2 t 1 torsion in h 1 m j 1 m n r t 1 and inc 1 6 0 in h 1 wc r t 1 by the hypothesis inc 1 is not contained in the kernel of the sur jection it follows that i 1 6 0 therefore ker i q 1 and hence i 1 0 since 1 wm p 1 1 wm z t the quotient group p 1 1 wm p 2 1 wm injects into h 1 wm r 1 t 1 since i 1 0 it follows that 1 0 in p 1 1 wm p 2 1 wm there fore 1 p 2 1 wm unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 39 7 bi filtrations and classical obstructions in this section we discuss relationships between our bi filtrations and previously known double sliceness obstructions we show that the double sliceness obstructions in gl 83 vanish for knots in f 2 2 and hence for knots in g 4 4 and w 4 4 we also show that the obstructions in fri 04 lm 15 vanish for knots in f 1 5 1 5 and hence for knots in g 3 5 3 5 and w 3 5 3 5 details are given below algebraic double sliceness due to sumners sum 71 a doubly slice knot has a hyperbolic seifert matrix that is a seifert matrix of the form 0 0 with the zero blocks of the same size following gl 83 we say that a knot k is algebraically doubly slice if k has a hyperbolic seifert matrix we remark that the following are equivalent 1 k has a hyperbolic seifert matrix 2 every seifert matrix of k is hyperbolic 3 k has a stably hyperbolic seifert matrix that is the orthogonal sum of a seifert matrix of k and some other hyperbolic seifert matrix is hyperbolic 4 every seifert matrix of k is stably hyperbolic 5 the blanchfield form ofk is hyperbolic that is the alexander module is an inter nal direct sum p 1 p 2 for some submodules p 1 and p 2 which are self annihilating with respect to the blanchfield form 6 the blanchfield form of k is stably hyperbolic that is the orthogonal sum of the blanchfield form of k and some other hyperbolic blanchfield form is hyperbolic the equivalence 3 6 4 seems to be a classical fact an explicit proof can be found in ors 15 equivalences 1 3 2 4 and 5 6 are recent results of orson ors 17 by proposition 6 14 with r z a doubly 1 solvable knot is algebraically doubly slice in particular our examples in theorem 6 10 are algebraically doubly slice it is known that a knot is doubly 0 solvable respectively doubly 0 5 solvable if and only if it has vanishing arf invariant respectively it is algebraically slice kim 06 corol lary 2 9 gilmer livingston obstruction in gl 83 gilmer livingston introduced obstructions for a knot to being doubly slice using the idea that a prime power fold cyclic cover of s 3 branched over a doubly slice knot embeds in s 4 to state their result we need the following notations for a space x and a homomorphism h 1 x zm where m q s for a prime q let xm denote the associated m fold cyclic cover of x and t a generator of the group of covering transfor mations let hk xm be the e 2 i m eigenspace for the action of t on hk xm c we define k xm dimhk xm and k x dimhk x zq suppose m is a closed 3 manifold and h 1 m zm is a homomorphism then there is a 4 manifold v with a homomorphism h 1 v zm such that v r m for some nonzero integer r let 1 vm be the signature of the intersection form on h 2 vm c restricted to h 2 vm we define m 1 r 1 vm 0 v where 0 v is the ordinary signature of v let n be a prime power let ln be the n fold cyclic cover of s 3 branched over a knot k which is a rational homology 3 sphere theorem 7 1 gilmer livingston obstruction gl 83 if k is a doubly slice knot then the following hold unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 40 1 h 1 l n g 1 g 2 where g 1 and g 2 are metabolizers of the linking form of l n 2 if h 1 l n zm is an epimorphism such that g 1 0 or g 2 0 then ln d 1 1 l n m d where d 1 2 dimh 1 l n zq proposition 7 2 if a knot k is doubly 2 solvable then k has vanishing gilmer livingston obstructions that is the conclusions 1 and 2 of theorem 7 1 hold proof suppose m k is doubly 2 solvable via u u let v be the 4 manifold obtained by adding a 2 handle to u n along the meridian of the preimage of k in m k n we define v in a similar fashion using u then v ln by proposition 6 14 we have h 1 m k z t 1 h 1 u z t 1 h 1 u z t 1 also each of h 1 u z t 1 is a self annihilating submodule of the blanchfield form since h 1 m k z t 1 is z torsion free so are h 1 u z t 1 by taking the quotients by the submodule generated by tn 1 it follows that h 1 l n h 1 v h 1 v and that h 1 v are metabolizers of the linking form of ln for brevity let u u and v v suppose that h 1 l n zm is an epimor phism which vanishes on h 1 v then the map factors through h 1 v denote by the homomorphism h 1 v zm now we have v l n since u is a 2 solution for r 1 2 dimh 2 u q we have surfaces xi and yi 1 i r in u whose homology classes xi and yi satisfy the conditions 1 and 2 in definition 6 3 let x j i and y j i 1 i r 1 j n be the lifts of xi and yi in v since un 2 rn we have v 1 2 rn this implies dimh 2 v q 2 rn it follows that x j i and y j i generate h 2 v q since x j i and y j i are dual to each other with respect to the intersection form on h 2 v q since the intersection form on h 2 v q vanishes on the span of x j i we have 0 v 0 it follows that l n 1 vm 0 v 1 vm since h 3 v zq h 1 v ln zq 0 we have 3 v 0 by gil 81 proposition 1 4 which states 3 vm 3 v it follows that 3 vm 0 and hence h 3 vm 0 by duality we have h 1 vm l n m h 3 vm 0 then the sequence h 2 vm h 2 vm l n m h 1 l n m h 1 vm 0 is exact therefore letting n be the nullity of the matrix for the intersection form restricted to h 2 vm we have 1 vm n 2 vm and 1 l n m n 1 vm we assert that 1 vm n 2 vm 2 rn the proof is as follows regard c as a z zm module where t a generator of the group of the covering transformations zm acts on c via multiplication by e 2 i m define h v c h c vm z zm c where the coefficient group c is twisted as above let h 2 v c h 2 v c c be the twisted intersection form since c is flat as a z zm module h v c is isomorphic to h vm z zm c note that vm is a metabelian cover of u therefore the surfaces x j i and y j i can be lifted to vm since u is a 2 solution by our choice of xi and yi we have x j i x k 0 and x j i y k ik j where 1 i k r and 1 j n let h 2 vm h 2 vm c be the intersection form on h 2 vm c restricted to h 2 vm then h 2 v c h 2 vm and x y m x y see cg 86 it follows that x j i and y j i span a 2 rn dimensional subspace of h 2 vm such that vanishes on the span of x j i which is a subspace of dimension rn moreover this 2 rn dimensional subspace has trivial intersection with the nullspace of therefore 1 vm n 2 vm 2 rn as asserted above unknotted gropes whitney towers and doubly slicing knots 41 combining the above assertion with ln 1 vm and 1 l n m n 1 vm we obtain that ln 1 l n m 2 vm 1 vm 2 rn we compute 2 vm we have vm v 1 2 rn where the first equality is due to gil 81 proposition 1 1 since is not trivial 0 vm 0 since vm is not closed k vm 0 for k 4 we have shown 3 vm 0 above and therefore 2 vm 1 vm 1 2 rn therefore we have ln 1 l n m 2 1 vm 1 since h 1 vm l n m 0 we have 1 vm 1 l n m also 1 vm 1 v 1 dimh 1 v zq 1 1 2 dimh 1 l n zq 1 d 1 where the inequality is due to gil 81 proposition 1 5 it follows that ln 1 l n m 2 min 1 l n m d 1 1 it is straightforward to verify that this is equivalent to ln d 1 1 l n m d friedl obstruction in fri 04 friedl gave double silceness obstructions using invariants he defined a collection denoted by

exist self annihilating submodules p 1 and p 2 of h 1 m k z t 1 for the blanchfield form such that 1 h 1 m k z t 1 p 1 p 2 and 2 m k 0 for any p irrk h 1 m k z t 1 z which vanishes on either p 1 or p

pi be the kernel of the map h 1 m k z t 1 h 1 wi z t 1 by proposition 6 14 each pi is a self annihilating submodule with respect to the blanchfield form and h 1 m k z t 1 p 1 p 2 therefore the conclusion 1 in theorem 7 3 holds let k be a prime power and p irrk h 1 m k z t 1 z following the notation in fri 04 suppose vanishes on either p 1 or p 2 let mk denote the k fold cyclic cover of m k

character h 1 l k zm and vanishes on pi t k 1 since wi are 1 5 solutions the casson gordon invariant k 0 see cot 03 section 9 by fri 05 proposition 5 3 we have mk 0 and hence m k 0 therefore the conclusion 2 in theorem 7 3 holds livingston meier obstruction in lm 15 livingston and meier gave double sliceness obstructions using twisted alexan der polynomials let n be a prime power and p an odd

conclusions of theorem 7 5 hold proof suppose k is doubly 1 5 solvable via u u using the same arguments as in the proof of proposition 7 2 we can show that there are subgroups gi for i 1 2 such that h
