ar x iv 1 40 8 38 86 v 1 m at h g t 1 8 a ug 2 01 4 a restriction on the alexander polynomials of l space knots david krcatovich abstract using an invariant defined by rasmussen we extend an argument given by hedden and watson which further restricts which alexander polynomials can be realized by l space knots 1 introduction in 12 ozsva th and szabo show how the filtered chain homotopy type of the knot floer complex cfk k can be used to compute the heegaard floer homology of s 3 n k the rational homology sphere obtained by doing dehn surgery along k s 3 with slope n in 11 they use this relationship to investigate which knots admit lens space surgeries using the fact that if y is a lens space y has the smallest possible heegaard floer homology 1 rank h f y h 1 y z more generally a rational homology sphere which satisfies condition 1 is called an l space so from a heegaard floer perspective a natural exten sion of the question which knots admit lens space surgeries is which knots admit l space surgeries letting a x denote the alexander grading of a homogeneous element x in cfk the following proposition is a straightforward consequence of 11 theorem 1 2 cf 4 remark 6 6 proposition 1 1 suppose k s 3 is a knot on which some positive integral surgery yields an l space then cfk k has a basis x k xk with the following properties a xi ni where n k n k 1 nk 1 nk ni n i if i k mod 2 then xi 0 if i k 1 mod 2 then xi xi 1 u ni 1 nixi 1 notice that xk is in the kernel of and not in the image so 2 xk generates h c fk k h f s 3 f by convention then m xk 0 where m is the maslov grading since u decreases m by 2 and decreases m by 1 this determines the maslov grading on all homogeneous elements of cfk k date 1 http arxiv org abs 1408 3886 v 1 2 david krcatovich ozsva th and szabo also showed 9 that the graded euler characteristic of c fk k is the symmetrized alexander polynomial of k 3 i c fk k i t i k t so a corollary to proposition 1 1 is corollary 1 2 11 corollary 1 3 if k s 3 is a knot which admits an l space surgery then 4 k t k i k 1 k i t ni for some sequence of integers n k n k 1 nk 1 nk satisfying n i ni remark 1 3 although proposition 1 1 only applies to knots which have positive l space surgeries a knot k has a negative l space surgery if and only if its mirror image k has a positive l space surgery corollary 1 2 then follows in this generality because k t k t in particular all of the nonzero coefficients of k t are 1 note that 5 nk g k k g 4 k where g is the seifert genus is the ozsva th szabo concordance invariant defined in 7 and g 4 is the smooth four genus of k the first equality follows from the knot floer homology detection of genus 8 the second follows from 2 and the third follows from the fact shown in 7 that for any knot k k g 4 k g k this was the most general restriction on the alexander polynomials of knots admitting l space surgeries in the literature until hedden and watson showed 1 proposition 1 4 3 corollary 9 if k s 3 is a knot which admits an l space surgery then k t is as described in corollary 1 2 and further nk nk 1 1 their proof hinges on an invariant defined by rasmussen and a particular inequality satisifed by this invariant roughly if large n surgery is done on an unknot and on a knot k the differences in the d invariants defined in equation 8 of the resulting manifolds are bounded above by numbers depending on g 4 k proposition 1 4 is then proved by showing that if a complex has a basis as in proposition 1 1 and nk nk 1 1 rasmussen s inequality is violated and therefore this complex cannot be the knot floer complex of any knot 1 this result was given as a corollary of a more general restriction on knot floer com plexes and was evidently already known to rasmussen alexander polynomials of l space knots 3 our aim here is to extend this argument we will introduce rasmussen s invariant and inequality in section 2 in section 3 we will show how to compute the invariant for l space knots from their alexander polynomials that is from the sequence of ni s we will then see that rasmussen s inequality places further restrictions on the ni s analogous to the restriction nk nk 1 1 as a result it will be shown that certain symmetric laurent polynomials satisfying proposition 1 4 cannot be the alexander polynomial of any l space knot theorem 1 5 suppose k s 3 is a knot which admits an l space surgery then its symmetrized alexander polynomial can be written as k t k i k 1 k i t ni for some sequence of integers n k n k 1 nk 1 nk satisfying the following ni n i if we let ri nk 2 2 i nk 1 2 i then r 1 1 and for any j k 6 j i 2 ri k i k j 2 ri as we will explain in section 3 the restriction is more easily stated in terms of a modified version of the alexander polynomial k t k t 1 t 1 it follows from corollary 1 2 that when k is a knot which admits an l space surgery k t i 0 t ai for some sequence of integers satisfying a 0 g k ai 1 ai ai i for i g k we can then rephrase theorem 1 5 as theorem 1 6 restatement of theorem 1 5 in terms of sup pose k s 3 is a knot which admits an l space surgery and ai is the decreasing sequence of integers such that k t i 0 t ai then for all 0 i g k 7 ai g k 2 i 4 david krcatovich to see the preceding theorems as generalizations of proposition 1 4 note that in the language of theorem 1 5 proposition 1 4 translates to the state ment r 1 1 in the language of theorem 1 6 it translates to a 1 g k 2 acknowledgments the author would like to thank his advisor matt hedden for explaining the proof of proposition 1 4 and for suggesting the restatement of theorem 1 5 in terms of the polynomial the author was partially supported by nsf grant dms 1150872 2 the invariant hm k a useful feature of heegaard floer theory is that its groups satisfy surgery exact triangles for example a long exact sequence between heegaard floer homology groups of manifolds which are 0 and n framed surgery along the same knot k 10 section 9 in 13 definition 7 1 rasmussen defines an invariant hm k as the rank of a particular map in such a sequence cf 1 where fr yshov introduces an instanton floer invariant h recall that if y t is a spinc rational homology sphere ozsva th and szabo define the d invariant of y t as 8 d y t min m x x im hf y t hf y t in 14 section 2 2 rasmussen shows that in the case where s 3 n k is an l space the invariant d s 3 n k sm is equal to twice hm k up to a shift which is independent of k in particular since hm unknot 0 for all m we have 9 hm k d s 3 n k sm d s 3 n unknot sm 2 the key to obtaining restrictions on l space knots is the following inequality analagous to an inequality in instanton floer homology proved by fr yshov 2 proposition 2 1 14 theorem 2 3 let k be a knot in s 3 and let g 4 k be its slice genus then hm k 0 for m g 4 k while for m g 4 k 10 hm k g 4 k m 2 note that for a knot admitting an l space surgery due to 5 we can replace g 4 k with g k and obtain 11 hm k g k m 2 it will be convenient to consider l space knots that is knots with pos itive rather than negative l space surgeries this is opposite rasmussen s point of view in 14 but note that k admits a positive l space surgery if alexander polynomials of l space knots 5 and only if its mirror image k admits a negative l space surgery accord ingly we will follow hedden and watson in defining 12 hm k d s 3 n unknot sm d s 3 n k sm 2 and recall their observation that hm k hm k finally we should note that g k g k so hm satisfies the same inequality which hm does for knots admitting l space surgeries for m g k 13 hm k g k m 2 3 values of hm for l space knots next we recall how to compute d invariants and therefore hm from cfk it was shown independently by ozsva th szabo 9 and rasmussen 13 that for large n surgery that is for n 2 g k 1 the heegaard floer homology groups hf s 3 n k are the homology groups of certain subcom plexes of cfk k up to a shift in maslov grading which is independent of k in particular if we let am denote the subcomplex consisting of elements with alexander grading less than or equal to m then hf s 3 n k sm h am up to a shift in grading 2 it follows that d s 3 n k sm max m x x a non torsion generator of h am c where c is a constant which depends on n but not on k therefore the shifted d invariant 14 d k m max m x x a non torsion generator of h am is well defined and satisfies 15 d s 3 n u sm d s 3 n k sm d u m d k m for any sufficiently large n for the unknot we have the complex cfk unknot f u where the generator has maslov grading and alexander grading equal to zero since multiplication by u lowers the alexander grading by 1 and the maslov grading by 2 d u m m m 2 here we are adopting the convention that cf and cfk contain the element 1 in f u 6 david krcatovich therefore we can rewrite inequality 13 using 15 and the above if k s 3 is an l space knot then for m g k hm k d u m d k m 2 g k m 2 1 2 d k m g k m 2 16 with inequality 16 in hand it remains to see how the values of d are determined by the alexander polynomial of an l space knot recall that the alexander polynomial is the graded euler characteristic of c fk k i c fk k i t i k t further cfk is generated by the same set as c fk over f u rather than f since u lowers the alexander grading by 1 and preserves the parity of the maslov grading i cfk k i t i i c fk k i t i 1 t 1 t 2 k t 1 t 1 k t 17 in other words k t is the graded euler characteristic of cfk k remark 3 1 if k s 3 is a knot for which k t is of the type described in corollary 1 2 then k t i 0 t ai where a 0 g k ai 1 ai and ai i for all i g k in 5 a reduced complex cfk was defined and it was shown that for an l space knot 18 cfk k f u supported in maslov grading zero since the reduced complex is filtered chain homotopy equivalent to cfk k they have the same euler char acteristic equation 18 says in particular that every generator has even alexander polynomials of l space knots 7 a 3 a 0 3 0 oo 2 oo 1 oo 0 a 1 0 2 oo 1 a 2 1 4 oo 2 oo 3 a 3 3 6 4 a 4 4 8 i cfk t 3 4 cfk t 3 4 figure 1 to the left is the knot floer complex cfk for the 3 4 torus knot which by proposition 1 1 is de termined by its alexander polynomial to the right is the reduced complex which for any l space knot is isomorphic to f u supported in maslov grading zero note that the reduced complex on the right has a generator for each gener ator colored red on the left the bottom most generator of each staircase summand maslov grading so each contributes a positive term to the euler character istic in other words if k t i 0 t ai then cfk k has one generator with alexander grading ai for each i 0 since multiplication by u is a filtered map i e it never increases the alexander grading then necessarily m ai 2 i figure 1 gives an illustration for the case of the 3 4 torus knot 3 where 19 t 3 4 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 t 3 and therefore 20 t 3 4 t t 3 1 t 1 t 3 t 4 3 it was shown by moser 6 that torus knots admit lens space hence l space surgeries 8 david krcatovich proof of theorem 1 6 first note that it is sufficient to prove the pro positon for positive surgeries see remark 1 3 so let k be an l space knot in s 3 so that k t i 0 t ai then the reduced complex cfk k consists of a single generator of al exander grading ai and maslov grading 2 i for each i 0 since the ai are strictly decreasing it follows that d as defined in 14 is given by d k m 2 min i ai m and therefore 21 d k ai 1 2 i 1 substituting these values into inequality 16 we obtain 22 i 1 g k ai 1 2 so ai g k 2 i proof of theorem 1 5 let k be an l space knot so that k t k i k 1 k it ni we have introduced the variables r r 1 rk as the gaps in the alexander polynomial the difference in the exponents of consecutive nonzero terms ri nk 2 2 i nk 1 2 i while r records only every second gap by the symmetry of t this determines the polynomial uniquely diagramatically notice that r is simply the list of horizontal lenghts of a staircase summand of cfk in order from left to right see figure 2 for the example of the 4 5 torus knot which has t 4 5 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 5 t 5 t 6 t 6 next we observe how given r to compute both sides of inequality 16 for any m with figure 2 as a guide we will focus on the values labeled mj alexander polynomials of l space knots 9 a 6 0 oo r 3 5 m 1 oo 4 oo 3 oo 2 2 r 1 oo 1 r 1 1 oo oo r 2 0 m 2 oo oo 1 oo 2 2 r 1 r 2 r 2 2 oo 3 oo 4 r 3 3 oo r 1 5 m 3 oo 6 2 r 1 r 2 r 3 7 cfk t 4 5 cfk t 4 5 figure 2 the complex cfk for the 4 5 torus knot and its reduced form cfk note that the integers r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the horizontal lengths of each staircase from left to right and by symmetry the vertical lengths from bottom to top this figure illustrates how the mj s the alexander gradings at which the reduced complex jumps are de termined by the ri s and further how the values of d k mj given in parentheses to the right are determined by the ri s in figure 2 in other words the values where we have the jumps in the reduced complex more precisely if we let mj g k j i 1 ri k i k j 2 ri we have that d k mj 2 j i 1 ri 10 david krcatovich substituting these values into inequality 16 when m mj gives 23 j i 1 ri g k g k j i 1 ri k i k j 2 ri 2 the case j 1 gives r 1 r 1 2 so since each ri is a positive integer r 1 must equal 1 substituting this into 23 gives 1 j i 2 ri 1 j i 2 ri k i k j 2 ri 2 j i 2 ri 1 j i 2 ri k i k j 2 ri 2 from which it follows that j i 2 ri k i k j 2 ri this is sufficient to prove the claim we could similarly obtain inequalities by considering values of m different from the mj but those would be no stronger and therefore provide no more restrictions on r as an example consider a knot k with k t 1 t 2 t 2 t 3 t 3 t 4 t 4 so that k t t 4 t 2 t t 2 t 4 t 5 this polynomial satisfies the restriction of proposition 1 4 but if k were an l space knot we would have g k 4 and a 2 1 this violates inequality 7 sok and its mirror image cannot admit an l space surgery alternatively this polynomial has gaps r 1 2 1 and since r 2 r 3 this violates inequality 6 in fact this completely determines which alexander polynomials are real ized by l space knots of genus less than or equal to 4 all other polynomials satisfying proposition 1 4 are realized by known l space knots r l space knot with corresponding t 1 t 2 3 1 1 t 2 5 1 1 1 t 2 7 1 2 t 3 4 2 3 cable of t 2 3 1 1 1 1 t 2 9 1 1 2
