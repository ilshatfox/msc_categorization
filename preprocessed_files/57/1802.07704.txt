rational homology 3 sphere y with quotient the 3 sphere we prove a formula for the lefschetz number of the map induced by this involution in the re duced monopole floer homology this formula is motivated by a variant of witten s conjecture relating the donaldson and seiberg witten invariants of 4 manifolds a key ingredient is a skein theoretic argument making use of an exact triangle in monopole floer homology that computes the lefschetz number in terms of the murasugi signature of the branch set and the sum of fr yshov invariants associated to spin structures on y we discuss various applications of our formula in gauge theory knot theory contact geometry and 4 dimensional topology 1 introduction the monopole floer homology defined by kronheimer and mrowka 37 using seiberg witten gauge theory is a powerful invariant of 3 manifolds which has had many important applications in low dimensional topology because of its functoriality 37 theorem 3 4 3 the monopole floer homology of a 3 manifold is acted upon by its mapping class group however the information contained in this action is not easy to extract due to the gauge theoretic nature of the theory in this paper we make some first steps towards understanding this action by calculating the lefschetz numbers of certain involutions making the 3 manifold into a double branched cover over a link in the 3 sphere our study is motivated by the calculation of lefschetz numbers in the instanton floer homology 60 and by a variant 58 conjecture b of witten s conjecture 69 relating the donaldson and seiberg witten invariants the following theorem is the main result of the paper and it comes with many interesting applications 2010 mathematics subject classification 57 r 57 57 r 58 57 m 25 57 m 27 the first author was partially

branch set a non empty link l denote by hm redpy q hm redpy q the induced map in the reduced monopole floer homology and by lefp q its lefschetz number then lef p q 2 l 16 plq s hpy sq 1 where l is the number of components of the link l and plq is its murasugi signature 50 and the last term is the sum over all the spin structures on y of the fr yshov invariants hpy sq of the spin manifold py sq in particular if the link l is a knot k in s 3 lefp q 1 8 sign pkq hpy q 2 where signpkq is the classical knot signature and hpy q is the fr yshov invariant for the unique spin structure on y we are using here the rational numbers as the coefficient ring of the monopole floer homology and we will continue doing so throughout the paper unless otherwise noted we expect that a formula similar to 1 will hold for any rational homology sphere y and a diffeomorphism y y of order n 2 in the special case when the quotient y is an integral homology sphere y 1 and the branch set is a knot k y 1 we make this expectation precise and conjecture that lef p q n py 1 q 1 8 n 1 m 0 signm npkq s hpy sq 3 where py 1 q is the casson invariant of y 1 signm npkq is the tristram levine signature of k see 60 section 6 and the last summation extends to the spinc structures s on y such that psq s the origins of this conjecture will be discussed in section 1 2 1 remark 1 1 we will be working throughout with the fr yshov invariants hpy sq which are defined via monopole homology however it is important to note that these are now known to be equivalent to the heegaard floer theory correction terms dpy sq for which many more calculations are available in particular the work of kutluhan lee and taubes 39 40 41 42 43 or alternatively the work of colin ghiggini and honda 13 14 15 and taubes 65 identifies the monopole homology and the heegaard floer homology furthermore by combining the main results of 25 26 21 the absolute q gradings in the two theories coincide 2 therefore the relation dpy sq 2 hpy sq between the fr yshov invariant and the heegaard floer correction term holds for any rational homology spheres this relation plays a role in our proof of theorem a see proposition 6 4 as well in several of the corollaries we conjecture that a version of theorem a holds for heegaard floer homology this would be established by showing that the isomorphisms cited above between the reduced floer theories are natural with respect to cobordisms so that the lefschetz numbers computed in the two theories are the same 1 1 an outline of the proof since y is the double branched cover of s 3 with branch set l we will also use the notation y plq and assume that the orientation on y is pulled back from the standard orientation of s 3 we need to show the vanishing of the link invariant plq 1 2 l 1 lef p q s hp plq sq 1 8 plq 4 for all links l with non zero determinant this is done by an inductive argument involving a skein relation between plq pl 0 q and pl 1 q where l 0 l 1 are resolutions of l at a certain crossing the skein relation for plq can be proved directly and the skein relations for the other two terms are a consequence of an exact triangle relating the monopole floer homology of plq pl 0 q and pl 1 q while the idea is straightforward there are several technical obstacles one needs to overcome first of all to understand the skein theoretic behavior the monopole lefschetz number as a rational number one needs an exact triangle with q coefficients however the original exact triangle 38 has coefficients in z 2 while one may be able to adapt the proof there by putting suitable plus and minus signs before various terms appearing in the proof keeping the signs straight is complicated and would require a significant amount of work here we follow an alternative route we show that with some extra input from homological algebra one can deduce a q coefficient exact triangle from the corresponding z 2 exact triangle using the universal coefficient theorem it is a delicate matter to define the signs involved in the maps of this new exact triangle so that they are compatible with the induced action of we need this compatibility to deduce a vanishing result for the total lefschetz number the second difficulty comes from the fact that the version of monopole floer homology that appears in the exact triangle is hmpy q and it is always infinite dimensional to discuss the lefschetz number one needs to modify hmpy q to a finite dimensional vector space by ignoring 3 all generators of sufficiently high degree however we lose the exactness of the triangle by such a truncating operation as a consequence the skein relation for plq only holds up to a universal constant c depending on certain combinatorial data including the surgery coefficients to prove that c always equals zero we start from the example of two bridge links since such links are known to have vanishing plq we can use them to show that in some cases the constant c vanishes and the actual skein relation holds with the help of this special skein relation we can produce more examples of links l with plq 0 and prove the vanishing result for c in a more general situation repeating this procedure several times we eventually produce enough examples to prove that c 0 in all possible cases after establishing the skein relation one might hope to prove plq 0 by an inductive argument however such an argument would need to avoid links with zero determinant because double branched covers of such links not being rational homology 3 spheres may have more complicated monopole floer homology unfortunately it is not clear how to reduce a general non zero determinant link to the unknot solely by resolving crossing without involving any zero determinant links to overcome this obstacle we make use of mullins s skein theory for non zero determinant links 49 following his idea we extend the inductive statement by adding another skein relation relating plq with pl q where l is obtained from l by a crossing change the relation is then established by comparing the two exact triangles arising from the triples pl l 0 l 1 q and pl l 1 l 0 q 1 2 calculations and applications theorem a can be used in several different ways in some cases for instance when y is an l space the monopole lefschetz number automatically vanishes and we obtain a direct relation between the fr yshov invariant and the murasugi signature in other cases one can use formula 1 to compute the monopole lefschetz number this lefschetz number contains important information about the action and can be used to explicitly describe the action in some cases leading to non trivial conclusions the applications we present in this paper fall into four different categories gauge theory knot theory contact geometry and 4 dimensional topology 1 2 1 an application to gauge theory let x be a closed smooth oriented 4 manifold such that h px zq h ps 1 s 3 zq and h px qq h ps 3 qq 5 4 where x is the universal abelian cover of x associated with a choice of generator forh 1 px zq z called a homology orientation on x associated with x are two gauge theoretic invariants whose definition depends on a choice of riemannian metric on x but which end up being metric independent the invariant fopxq is roughly one quarter times a signed count of anti self dual connections on the trivial sup 2 q bundle over x and the invariant swpxq is roughly a signed count of the seiberg witten monopoles over x plus an index theoretic correction term the invariant fopxq was originally defined by furuta and ohta 20 under the more restrictive hypothesis that h px zq h ps 3 z and the invariant swpxq was defined by mrowka ruberman and saveliev 48 without any assumption on x conjecture b for any closed oriented homology oriented smooth 4 manifold x satisfying condition 5 one has fopxq swpxq this conjecture is a slight generalization of 48 conjecture b it relates the donaldson and seiberg witten invariants of certain smooth 4 manifolds and therefore can be thought of as a variant of the witten conjecture 69 for manifolds with vanishing second betti number the conjecture has been verified in a number of examples 58 the following theorem which we prove in this paper provides further evidence towards it theorem c let y y be an involution on a rational homology sphere y making y into a double branched cover of s 3 with branch set a knot k and let x be the mapping torus of then fopxq swpxq 1 8 sign pkq note that our conjectural formula 3 can be interpreted as a special case of conjecture b for the mapping torus of a diffeomorphism of order n by using the splitting formula for swpxq proved in our earlier paper 44 theorem a and the calculation of fopxq for the finite order mapping tori 60 theorem 1 1 1 2 2 strongly non extendable involutions and akbulut corks in 1 akbulut con structed a smooth compact contractible 4 manifold w 1 with boundary an integral homology sphere bw 1 and an involution bw 1 bw 1 which can be extended to w 1 as a homeo morphism but not as a diffeomorphism it was the first example of what is now known as the 5 akbulut cork we improve upon this result by constructing the first known example of what we call a strongly non extendable involution the precise statement is as follows theorem d there exists a smooth involution y y on an integral homology 3 sphere y which has the following two properties 1 y bounds a smooth contractible 4 manifold and 2 can not be extended as a diffeomorphism to any z 2 homology 4 ball that y bounds one example of a strongly non extendable involution claimed by theorem d is the aforemen tioned involution bw 1 bw 1 of the original akbulut cork pw 1 q we show that does not extend to a self diffeomorphism not just of w 1 but of any homology ball that bw 1 may bound we accomplish this by computing the induced action of on the monopole floer homology zhmpbw 1 zq with the help of theorem a and the calculation of akbulut and durusoy 3 when the homology 4 ball bounded by y is contractible the involution always extends to it as a homeomorphism using this idea we give a general construction in section 8 that results in a large family of new corks it is worth mentioning that previous examples of corks were usually detected by embedding them in a closed manifold whose smooth structure is changed by the cork twist in the terminology of 7 they have an effective embedding on the other hand the corks we construct do not have an obvious effective embedding and they are detected by monopole floer homology 1 2 3 knot concordance and khovanov homology thin knots recall from 32 33 that a link l in the 3 sphere is called khovanov homology thin over f 2 if its reduced khovanov homology kh pl f 2 q is supported in a single grading such links are rather common for instance according to 46 all quasi alternating links as well as 238 of the 250 prime knots with up to 10 crossings are khovanov homology thin in follows from the spectral sequence of bloom 9 that hm redp plqq 0 if l is a khovanov homology thin link combined with theorem a this leads to the following series of corollaries the first of which confirms the conjecture of manolescu and owens 45 conjecture 1 4 corollary e for any khovanov homology thin link l with nonzero determinant one has the relation plq 8 spspinp plqq hp plq sq 6 between the murasugi signature of l and the fr yshov invariants of the double branched cover plq corollary f for a knot k in s 3 denote by lpkq the lefschetz number of the map on hm redp pkqq induced by the covering translation then lpkq is a non trivial additive concor dance invariant which vanishes on khovanov homology thin knots corollary g let cs be the smooth knot concordance group and cthin its subgroup generated by the khovanov homology thin knots then the quotient group cs cthin contains a z summand 1 2 4 the choice of sign in the monopole contact invariant for any compact contact 3 manifold py q kronheimer and mrowka 36 see also 38 defined a contact invariant py q p hmp y z 2 q as well as a pair of monopole homology classes py q p hmp y zq note that this construction results in a pair of homology classes rather than a single class when working with integer coefficients technically this happens because the seiberg witten moduli space involved in the construction does not carry a natural orientation one might hope that a canonical element can be picked in the pair py q by further analysis however we show that that is not possible with the help of theorem a we construct an involution on the brieskorn homology sphere p 2 3 7 q which preserves a certain contact structure but changes the sign of the non torsion contact invariant theorem h there exists no canonical choice of sign in the definition of py q it is worth mentioning that similar contact invariants in heegaard floer homology were defined by ozsva th and szabo 53 a version of theorem h in context of heegaard floer ho mology has been proved by honda kazez and matic 28 using an approach different from ours as discussed in remark 1 1 there exists an isomorphism between heegaard floer homology and monopole floer homology which preserves the contact invariant 13 14 15 65 however since the naturality of this isomorphism has not been established our result and that of honda kazez and matic do not imply each other 7 1 3 organization of the paper section 2 sets up the skein theory argument reducing the proof of theorem a to the key proposition 2 2 the proof of that proposition occupies sections 3 6 which form the bulk of the paper section 3 establishes a skein relation for the murasugi signature plq and section 4 sets up a surgery exact triangle with rational coefficients that will be crucial for the remainder of the argument in section 5 we show that proposition 2 2 holds up to certain universal constants c and organize the rather complicated data necessary to track spin and spinc structures through the skein theory argument section 6 studies the skein exact sequence for a large number of examples sufficient to show that the constants c vanish thereby establishing proposition 2 2 and theorem a the remainder of the paper is devoted to applications in section 7 we extend the definition of the furuta ohta invariant fo and evaluate it for the mapping torus of an involution on a rational homology sphere with homology sphere quotient this establishes theorem c we calculate the effect of a particular involution on a cork boundary in section 8 proving the non extension result theorem d corollaries e f and g of theorem a concerning the knot concordance group are established in section 9 finally section 10 proves the non canonical nature of the sign in the contact invariant theorem h acknowledgments we thank ken baker john baldwin olga plamenevskaya marco golla and youlin li for generously sharing their expertise tom mark for pointing out tosun s pa per 68 and christine lescop for an interesting discussion on mullins s approach to skein theory for the double branched cover 2 skein relations and the proof of theorem a let l be an unoriented link in s 3 and plq its double branched cover a quasi orientation of l is an orientation on each component of l modulo an overall orientation reversal the set of quasi orientations of l will be denoted by qplq turaev 66 established a natural bijective correspondence between qplq and spinp plqq the set of spin structures on plq the link l will be called ramifiable if detplq 0 or equivalently if plq is a rational homology sphere note that all knots are ramifiable given a ramifiable link l in s 3 consider the quantity plq 1 2 l 1 spspinp plqq hp plq sq 1 8 pqplq p q lefp q 8 where l is the number of components of l p q is the signature of the link l quasi oriented by hp plq sq is the fr yshov invariant of the spin manifold p plq sq and lefp q is the lefschetz number of the map hm redp plqq hm redp plqq 6 on the reduced monopole floer homology of plq induced by the covering translation plq plq that the above formula for plq matches formula 4 can be seen as follows write l k 1 y y km as a link of m l components and choose a quasi orientation p qplq recall that the murasugi signature of l is defined as plq p q 1 i j m lkpki kjq murasugi 50 proved that plq does not depend on the choice of quasi orientation hence plq can be defined alternatively as plq 1 2 m 1 pqplq p q 7 the following theorem is then equivalent to theorem a theorem 2 1 for any ramifiable link l s 3 one has plq 0 our proof of theorem 2 1 will rely on skein theory given a link l in the 3 sphere fix its planar projection and consider two resolutions of l at a crossing c as shown in figure 1 we follow here the convention of 54 psfrag replacements l l 0 l 1 figure 1 the links l 0 and l 1 are called the 0 resolution and the 1 resolution of l respectively and the triple pl l 0 l 1 q is called a skein triangle note that a skein triangle possesses a cyclic 9 symmetry for any link in pl l 0 l 1 q the other two taken in the prescribed cyclic ordering are its 0 and 1 resolutions this symmetry is best seen when the links are drawn as in figure 2 see also 35 figure 6 denote by l the link obtained by changing the crossing c in the link l psfrag replacements ll l 0 l 1 figure 2 proposition 2 2 let pl l 0 l 1 q be a skein triangle and assume that l is ramifiable then at least two of the three links l l 0 l 1 are ramifiable and in addition i if both l 0 and l 1 are ramifiable and pl 0 q pl 1 q 0 then plq 0 ii if one of the links l 0 l 1 is not ramifiable then plq pl q we will now prove theorem 2 1 assuming proposition 2 2 the proof of the proposition will then occupy section 3 through section 6 proof of theorem 2 1 the proof is a modification of the proof of 49 theorem 3 3 we will proceed by induction on the pair pcplq l q where cplq is the number of crossings in a diagram of l the case p 0 1 q is trivial the cases p 0 nq with n 2 are vacuous because unlinks with more than one component are not ramifiable next suppose that the statement has been proved for all links admitting a diagram with k or fewer crossings we want to prove it for the case pk 1 nq with n 1 first let n 1 then l is a knot admitting a diagram with k 1 crossings by changing m k crossings we can unknot l thereby obtaining a sequence of knots l l 1 l 2 lm 1 unknot where la 1 is obtained from la by a single crossing change denote by la 0 and l a 1 the two resolutions of la we have plm 1 q 0 to deduce that plaq 0 from pla 1 q 0 we will consider the following two cases 10 i both la 0 and l a 1 are ramifiable since cpl a 0 q k and cpl a 1 q k it follows from our induction hypothesis that pla 0 q pl a 1 q 0 proposition 2 2 i then implies that plaq 0 ii one of the resolutions la 0 l a 1 is not ramifiable then proposition 2 2 ii implies that plaq pla 1 q 0 and we are finished now let n 2 so that l is a multi component link admitting a diagram with k 1 crossings again change m k crossings one by one to obtain a sequence of links l l 1 l 2 lm 1 a split link where la 1 is obtained from la by a single crossing change since multi component split links are not ramifiable we can find b m such that l 1 lb are ramifiable and lb 1 is not proposition 2 2 then implies that both lb 0 and l b 1 are ramifiable since cpl b 0 q k and cplb 1 q k we conclude that pl b 0 q pl b 1 q 0 from our induction hypothesis proposition 2 2 i then implies that plbq 0 the deduction that pla 1 q 0 implies plaq 0 for all a b is exactly the same as in the n 1 case 3 skein relation for the murasugi signature let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be a skein triangle obtained by resolving a crossing c inside a ball b for any subscript j viewed as an element of z 3 t 0 1 2 u denote by sj the standard cobordism surface from lj to lj 1 inside the 4 manifold r 0 1 s s 3 obtained by adding a single 1 handle to the product surface outside of r 0 1 s b denote by wj the double branched cover of r 0 1 s s 3 with branch set sj the manifold wj is an oriented cobordism from pljq to plj 1 q it will be described as a surgery cobordism in section 4 the signature of wj can be either 0 1 or 1 lemma 3 1 let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be a skein triangle such that l 2 l 0 1 l 1 1 which is to say that the resolved crossing c is between two different components of l 2 then 2 pl 2 q pl 0 q pl 1 q signpw 1 q signpw 2 q 8 proof this can be derived from the gordon litherland 24 formula for the murasugi signature but we will follow a more self contained approach it will rely on the disjoint decomposition qpl 2 q q 0 pl 2 q yq 1 pl 2 q 11 where q 0 pl 2 q resp q 1 pl 2 q consists of the quasi orientations of l 2 which make l 0 resp l 1 into an oriented resolution for any p q 0 pl 2 q the induced quasi orientation on l 0 will be denoted by 0 this establishes a bijective correspondence q 0 pl 2 q qpl 0 q similarly for any p q 1 pl 2 q the induced quasi orientation on l 1 will be denoted by 1 p qpl 1 q this establishes a bijective correspondence q 1 pl 2 q qpl 1 q we claim that p 0 q p q signpw 2 q for any p q 0 pl 2 q and p 1 q p q signpw 1 q for any p q 1 pl 2 q these identities which are essentially due to murasugi can be verified as follows let p q 0 pl 2 q since 0 is an oriented resolution of the cobordism surface s 2 r 0 1 s s 3 is naturally oriented choose an oriented seifert surface for bd 4 and slightly push its interior into the interior of d 4 to obtain a properly embedded surface f d 4 passing to double branched covers we obtain pd 4 y pr 0 1 s s 3 q f y s 2 q pd 4 f q y pr 0 1 s s 3 s 2 q where pa bq stands for the double branched cover of a with branch set b using additivity of the signature and the fact that pr 0 1 s s 3 s 2 q w 2 we obtain signp pd 4 y pr 0 1 s s 3 q f y s 2 qq signp pd 4 f qq signpw 2 q observe that the surface f ys 2 in d 4 y pr 0 1 s s 2 q is an embedded surface with boundary 0 in t 1 u s 2 it is a classical result see for instance 30 that signp pd 4 f qq p q and signp pd 4 y pr 0 1 s s 3 q f y s 2 qq p 0 q therefore p 0 q p q signpw 2 q for any p q 0 pl 2 q the proof of the other identity is similar with these identities in place the proof of the lemma is completed as follows 2 l 2 1 pl 2 q pq 0 pl 2 q p q pq 1 pl 2 q p q 0 pqpl 0 q p p 0 q signpw 2 qq 1 pqpl 1 q p p 1 q signpw 1 qq 2 l 2 2 p pl 0 q pl 1 q signpw 1 q signpw 2 qq 12 4 an exact triangle in monopole floer homology in this section we will establish an exact triangle in the monopole floer homology with ratio nal coefficients we will also show that this triangle possesses a certain conjugation symmetry which will be instrumental in the proof of proposition 2 2 later in the paper 4 1 statement of the exact triangle let y be a compact connected oriented 3 manifold with boundary by t 2 and let 0 1 and 2 be oriented simple closed curves on by such that p 0 x 1 q p 1 x 2 q p 2 x 0 q 1 where the algebraic intersection numbers are calculated with respect to the boundary ori entation on by let f 2 be the field of two elements it follows from poincare duality that the kernel of the map h 1 pby f 2 q h 1 py f 2 q is one dimensional therefore we may assume without loss of generality that 2 is an f 2 longitude meaning that r 2 s 0 p h 1 py f 2 q while 0 and 1 are not for any j viewed as an element of z 3 t 0 1 2 u denote by yj the closed manifold obtained from y by attaching a solid torus to its boundary with meridian j and by wj the respective surgery cobordism from yj to yj 1 the cobordism wj can be obtained by attaching d 4 to the component s 3 in the boundary of the 4 manifold w 0 j pr 1 0 s yjq yt 0 u y pr 0 1 s y q yt 1 u y pr 1 2 s yj 1 q 9 lemma 4 1 the manifolds w 1 and w 2 are spin and the manifold w 0 is not proof notice that the inclusion y y 2 induces an isomorphism h 1 py 2 f 2 q h 1 py f 2 q hence any spin structure on y can be extended to a spin structure on y 2 to show that w 1 is spin start with any spin structure s on y 1 and extend s y to a spin structure on y 2 this gives a spin structure on w 01 which extends over d 4 to a spin structure on w 1 a similar argument shows that w 2 is also spin to show that w 0 is not spin we argue as follows supposew 0 has a spin structure s by the argument above s y 1 can be extended to a spin structure onw 1 glue these two spin structures together to obtain a spin structure on the manifold w 0 yy 1 w 1 this leads to a contradiction because the manifold w 0 yy 1 w 1 p w 2 q cp 2 contains an embedded sphere with self intersection number 1 13 the space of spinc structures has a natural involution which carries a spinc structure s to its conjugate s a spinc structure s is called self conjugate if c 1 psq s s vanishes for a fixed self conjugate spinc structure s 0 on y we will come up with an exact triangle involving spinc structures on the manifolds yj restricting to the spin c structure s 0 on y the usual exact triangle involving all spinc structures can be obtained by taking the direct sum of these restricted exact triangles over all possible s 0 we will set up some notation first for use in this and the following section in the six lines that follow m can be any of the manifolds y yj or wj j p z 3 and we write tor spincpmq tequivalence classes of torsion spinc structure on mu sc spincpmq tequivalence classes of self conjugate spinc structure on mu tor spincpm s 0 q ts p tor spin cpmq s y s 0 u sc spincpm s 0 q ts p sc spin cpmq s y s 0 u spincpm s 0 q ts p spin cpmq s y s 0 u and spinpm s 0 q ts p spinpmq ps y q c s 0 u with the notation ps y q c explained below remark 4 2 recall that each spin structure s on y induces a self conjugate spinc structure which we denote by sc and that each self conjugate spinc structure on y is obtained in this fashion let s 1 and s 2 be two spin structures on y then s c 1 s c 2 if and only if s 1 s 2 h for some h in the image of the coefficient map h 1 py zq h 1 py z 2 q therefore each self conjugate spinc structure on y corresponds to 2 b 1 py q spin structures a similar remark applies to the manifolds yj and wj j p z 3 our exact triangle will consist of the floer homology groups 1 hmpyj rs 0 sq spspincpyj s 0 q hmpyj sq and the maps between them induced by the cobordisms wj to ensure that the composition of any two adjacent maps is zero we need to assign an appropriate plus or minus sign to each spinc structure on wj we will accomplish this by defining an auxiliary map 1 as we mentioned in the introduction the monopole floer homology will have the rational numbers as their coefficient ring unless otherwise noted 14 jpz 3 spincpwj s 0 q f 2 10 as follows is identically zero on spincpw 2 s 0 q choose a base point s 1 p spin cpw 0 s 0 q and let ps 1 q 0 given an element of spincpw 0 s 0 q write it in the form s 1 h with h p kerph 2 pw 0 zq h 2 py zqq and let ps 1 hq hf 2 where hf 2 p kerph 2 pw 0 f 2 q h

3 psq ps q for s p spincpw 1 s 0 q and s p spin cpw 2 s 0 q and psq ps q 1 for s p spincpw 0 s 0 q proof the lemma is trivial for s p spincpw 2 s 0 q for s p spin cpw 1 s 0 q since that s s c 1 psq the difference psq ps q equals the mod 2 reduction of c 1 psq which is just the stiefel whitney class 2 pw 1 q according to lemma 4 1 the cobordism w 1 is spin hence 2 pw 1 q 0 and psq ps q the proof for s p spincpw 0 s 0 q is similar by functoriality of monopole floer homology the cobordismwj equipped with a spin c struc ture s p spincpwj s 0 q induces a map hmpwj sq hmpyj s yj q hmpyj s yj 1 q j p z 3 we will combine these maps into a single map fwj hmpyj rs 0 sq hmpyj 1 rs 0 sq defined by the formula fwj spspincpwj s 0 q p 1 q psq hmpwj sq 15 note that up to an overall sign the maps fwj are independent of the arbitrary choices of base points in the definition 10 proposition 4 4 we have fwj 1 fwj 0 for all j p z 3 proof using the composition law for the cobordism induced maps in monopole

every s p spin cpxj s 0 q can be uniquely written as s 1 s 2 with s 1 p spin cp wj 2 s 0 q and s 2 p spin cpcp 2 q let us consider a diffeomorphism of xj which takes rejs p h 2 pxjq to rejs p h 2 pxjq and restricts to the identity map on wj 2 since this diffeomorphism does not change the homology orientation and since the cobordism map in monopole floer homology is natural we obtain the identity hmpwj 1 wj s 1 s 2 q hmpwj 1 wj s 1 s 2 q note that s 2 never equals s 2 because cp 2 is not spin as a result the terms on the right hand side of 11 come in pairs the proof of the proposition will be

rejs wj and pd rejs wj 1 which we will denote by ppd rejs wj qf 2 and ppd rejs wj 1 qf 2 respectively recall that wj is obtained by attaching a 2 handle hj to i yj since 2 treated as a knot in t 1 u yj is an f 2 longitude we can find an immersed possibly non orientable surface 16 2 y with boundary 2 capping 2 off with the surface 1 hj bounded by 2 we obtain a closed surface 1 y 2 2 which generates the group kerph 2 pwj f 2 q h 2 py f 2 qq cokerph 2 py f 2 q h 2 pwj f 2 qq f 2 as a result we have ppd rejs wj qf 2 pej x p 1 y 2 2 qq pmod 2 q since 1 y 2 2 is contained in wj the 2 sphere ej in the above formula can be replaced by ej x wj which is a 2 disk dj hj the boundary of dj denoted by j 1 is the core of the solid torus yj 1 z intpy q therefore pej x p 1 y 2 2 qq pdj x 1 q which

proof of the exact triangle we already know from proposition 4 4 that the composite of any two adjacent maps is zero to complete the proof of exactness we will combine the universal coefficient theorem with the f 2 coefficient exact triangle proved in 38 before we go on with the proof we need to review some basic constructions in monopole floer homology see kronheimer mrowka 37 for details for any j p z 3 denote by copyjq resp cspyjq and c upyjq the free z modules generated by the gauge equivalence classes of irreducible monopoles resp boundary stable and boundary unstable monopoles whose associated spinc structure belongs to spincpyj s 0 q by counting points in the zero dimensional moduli spaces of monopoles on r yj we obtain a linear map boopyjq c opyjq c opyjq and its companions bospyjq b u o pyjq b u s pyjq b s upyjq b u s pyjq b s spyjq b u upyjq note that the last four maps count only reducible monopoles set qcpyjq copyjq cspyjq and define the map b pyjq qcpyjq

notations without further explanation consider the manifold with cylindrical ends w j pp 8 0 s yjq yyj wj yyj 1 pr 0 8 q yj 1 q in what follows the superscript will indicate attaching a product end to the boundary of the manifold at hand for any s p spincpwj s 0 q the count of monopoles on w j defines the map moopwj sq c opyjq c opyjq 18 and its companion maps mospwj sq m u o pwj sq m u s pwj sq m

induces the map fwj in the exact triangle as our next step we will construct an explicit null homotopy of the composite m pwj 1 q m pwjq to this end recall that the composite cobordism xj wj yyj 1 wj 1 from yj to yj 2 contains an embedded 2 sphere ej with self intersection number 1 denote by sj the boundary of a normal neighborhood of ej let qj t gt t p r u be the family of metrics on xj constructed as follows start with an arbitrary metric g 0 on xj which is a product metric near bxj yj 1 and sj and which has the property that the metric it induces on sj is close enough to the round metric to have positive scalar curvature for any t p r the metric gt is then obtained from g 0 by inserting the cylinder rt t s sj into a normal neighborhood of sj if t 0 and by inserting the cylinder r t t s yj 1 into a normal neighborhood of yj 1 if t 0 given a spinc structure s on xj we again count monopoles on the manifold x j with cylin drical ends over the whole family qj to define the map

spinc structures we obtain the map qhpxjq spspincpxj s 0 q p 1 q ps wj q ps wj 1 q qhpxj sq qcpyjq qcpyj 2 q proposition 4 7 1 one has the equality b pyj 2 q qhpxjq qhpxjq b pyjq m pwj 1 q m pwjq 13 2 the map j qcpyjq qcpyjq defined as qhpxj 1 q m pwjq m pwj 2 q qhpxjq is an anti chain map moreover the map p jqq qcpyjqq qcpyjqq induces an isomorphism in homology proof 1 we can upgrade the proof of the mod 2 version 38 proposition 5 2 of this result to the integers as follows let bj be the closed normal neighborhood of ej and zj the closure of xjzbj the family qj of metrics on xj can be completed by adding the disjoint union z j y b j at t 8 and the disjoint union w j y w j 1 at t 8 denote this new family by q j given monopoles a on yj and b on yj 2 and a spin c structure s on xj consider the parametrized moduli space mpa px j sq bqq on the manifold px j sq and construct its compactification m pa px j sq bqq by adding in broken trajectories when this moduli space is one dimensional the number of its boundary points counted with sign must be zero this gives us a boundary identity by adding these 20 boundary identities over all possible s with sign p 1 q ps wj q ps wj 1 q we obtain various summed up boundary identities for different pa bq we claim that the points in m pa px j sq bqg 8 do not contribute to these identities as explained in the proof of 38 proposition 5 2 these points always come in pairs of the form p 1 q and p 2 q where is a possibly broken solution over z j and 1 and 2 are reducible solutions over b j moreover 1 and 2 correspond to conjugate spinc structures over b j since b 2 pbjq b 1 pbjq 0 all reducible monopoles over b j are positive therefore p 1 q and p 2 q contribute to their respective boundary identities with the same sign by lemma 4 5 when we take the sum with the weights p 1 q ps wj q ps wj 1 q these contributions cancel the rest of the proof proceed exactly as in 38 proposition 5 2 in 37 lemma 26 2 3 several similar boundary identities are obtained by considering one dimensional moduli spaces of monopoles for a family of metrics parametrized by r 0 1 s as a consequence of our claim the summed up boundary identities we have here can be obtained from the identities there by removing terms corresponding to t 0 for example we have 0 spspincpxj s 0 q p 1 q ps wj 1 q ps wj qp hoo pxj sqb o opyjq b o opyj 2

a chain map follows easily from 1 according to 38 lemma 5 11 the map j b id qcpyjq b f 2 qcpyjq b f 2 induces an isomorphism in homology by the universal coefficient theorem the map q also induces an isomorphism in homology 21 the proof of theorem 4 6 is now completed by the following triangle detection lemma the mod 2 version of this lemma appears as lemma 4 2 in 54 the proof of the version at hand is essentially the same 2 lemma 4 8 for any j p z 3 let pcj bjq be a chain complex over the rationals suppose that there are chain maps fj cj cj 1 satisfying the following two conditions the composite fj 1 fj is null homotopic by a chain homotopy hj cj cj 2 with bhj hjb fj 1 fj and the map j hj 1 fj fj 2 hj cj cj which is an anti chain map by the first condition induces an isomorphism in homology then the sequence h pcjq pfjq h pcj 1 q pfj 1 q h pcj 2 q is exact 5 skein relations up to constants let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be a skein triangle obtained by resolving a crossing c of the link l l 2 as shown in figure 1 definition 5 1 the skein triangle pl 0 l 1 l 2 q will be called admissible if 1 l 2 l 0 1 l 1 1 which is equivalent to saying that the resolved crossing c is between two different components of l 2 and 2 at least one of the links l 0 l 1 and l 2 is ramifiable in section 2 we defined a link l 2 by changing the crossing c define l 0 and l 1 similarly using the cyclic symmetry as in figure 2 lemma 5 2 if pl 0 l 1 l 2 q is an admissible skein triangle then at most one of the six links l 0 l 1 l 2 l 0 l 1 l 2 is not ramifiable in particular we have three more admissible skein triangles pl 1 l 0 l 2 q pl 1 l 0 l 2 q and pl 1 l 0 l 2 q 2 a version of this lemma over the integers can be found as lemma 7 1 in 35 our sign conventions here are slightly different 22 proof by our definition of l all of the triples pl 1 l 0 l 2 q pl 1 l 0 l 2 q and pl 1 l 0 l 2 q are skein triangles now suppose that two of the links l 0 l 1 l 2 l 0 l 1 and l 2 are not ramifiable by 49 claim 3 2 these two links have to be l j and l j 1 for some j p z 3 recall that after putting suitable signs the determinants of the three links in a skein triangle add up to zero therefore from the skein triangles plj 1 lj 1 l jq and plj lj 1 l j 1 q we deduce that detpl 0 q detpl 1 q detpl 2 q since pl 0 l 1 l 2 q is a skein triangle this implies that detpl 0 q detpl 1 q detpl 2 q 0 this contradicts condition 2 of definition 5 1 let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be an admissible skein triangle and b s 3 a small ball containing the resolved crossing c denote by y the double branched cover of s 3 zb with branch set ps 3 zbqxl 2 then y is a manifold with torus boundary by definition 5 3 a boundary framing is a pair of oriented simple closed curves pm lq on by such that 1 pmx lq 1 2 rls 0 p h 1 py qq and 3 either m or l represents the zero element in h 1 py f 2 q one can easily check that a boundary framing always exists once a boundary framing pm lq is fixed we will define the following numbers the divisibility of the longitude tpy q min t a p z a 0 and a rls 0 p h 1 py zq u set spy q 0 if l represents the zero element in h 1 py f 2 q and set spy q 1 otherwise the double branched cover yj pljq j p z 3 is obtained from y by attaching a solid torus along by matching the meridian with a simple closed curve j on by we will orient the curves j by the following two conditions a p 0 x 1 q p 1 x 2 q p 2 x 0 q 1 where the algebraic intersection numbers are calculated with respect to the boundary orientation on by see ozsva th szabo 54 section 2 and b p 2 xmq 0 when spy q 0 and p 2 x lq 0 when spy q 1 this makes sense because 2 represents zero in h 1 py f 2 q by definition 5 1 1 having oriented the curves j this way we define the integers ppj qjq by the equality r js pj rms qj rls which holds in h 1 pby zq 23 definition 5 4 given a boundary framing pm lq we define the resolution data for the admis sible skein triangle pl 0 l 1 l 2 q as the six tuple ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq we should note that pp 2 q 2 q p p 0 p 1 q 0 q 1 q since r 0 s r 1 s r 2 s 0 p h 1 py zq the main goal of this section is to establish the following skein relations up to universal constants we will show later in section 6 that these universal constants actually vanish theorem 5 5 let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be an admissible skein triangle and fix a boundary framing pm lq on the boundary by of the manifold y as above then 1 if all of the links l 0 l 1 l 2 are ramifiable 2 pl 2 q pl 0 q pl 1 q cptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq 14 2 if lj is not ramifiable for some j p z 3 then lj 1 and l j 1 are all ramifiable and in addition pl j 1 q plj 1 q c j ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq and 15 pl j 1 q plj 1 q c j ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq 16 where cptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq and c j ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq are certain universal constants depending only on the resolution data 5 1 the action of covering translations we will use m to denote covering translations on various double branched covers m such as m yj or m wj lemma 5 6 let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be an admissible skein triangle then exactly one of the following two options is realized 1 if all lj are ramifiable there exists a unique n p z 3 such that pn pn 1 and in addition b 1 pyjq b 1 pwjq 0 for all j p z 3 b 2 pwn 1 q 1 b 2 pwn 1 q b 2 pwnq 0 and b 2 pwn 1 q 0 b 2 pwn 1 q b 2 pwnq 1 2 if ln is not ramifiable for some n p z 3 then b 1 pynq 1 and b 1 pyn 1 q b 1 pyn 1 q 0 24 b 1 pwjq b 2 pwjq 0 for all j p z 3 and b 2 pwn 1 q 1 and b 2 pwn 1 q b 2 pwnq 0 proof the claims about b 1 follow easily from the mayer vietoris sequence as for the b 2 claims note that the inequality pn pn 1 is equivalent to pn having an opposite sign to both pn 1 and pn 1 the result then follows from the explicit calculation of the cup product structure on h 2 pwjq in lemma 5 12 lemma 5 7 the covering translations act as follows 1 y paq a for any a p h 2 py zq 2 yjpbq b for any b p h 2 pyj zq 3 wjpcq c for any c p h 2 pwj zq 4 yjpdq d for any d p h 1 pyj zq 5 wjpeq e for any e p h 1 pwj zq 6 y psq s for any s p spin cpy q 7 yjpsq s for any s p spin cpyjq 8 xjpsq s for any s p spin cpxjq proof since h 2 py zq 0 the universal coefficient theorem provides a natural identification of h 2 py zq with the torsion part of h 1 py zq therefore to prove 1 we only need to show that acts on h 1 py zq as 1 to see this let be a loop in y which does not intersect the branch locus the image of under the covering map y s 3 zb will be called since s 3 zb is contractible there is a continuous map f d 2 s 3 zb with fpbd 2 q lift f to a map f f y where f is a double branched cover of d 2 if f pbf q equals or p q then is null homologous otherwise we have f pbf q p q which implies r s r p qs and proves 1 claim 4 can be proved similarly while 2 is just the poincare dual of 4 and 5 follows from 4 and the fact that h 1 pbwj zq h 1 pwj zq is onto we will next prove 3 under the assumption that b 1 pyjq 0 otherwise b 1 pyj 1 q 0 and the argument is similar using the mayer vietoris sequence for the decomposition of wj into i yj and the 2 handle we obtain an exact sequence 0 h 1 ps 1 d 2 zq b h 2 pwj zq i h 2 pi yj zq the maps induced by on the cohomology groups in this sequence are compatible with b and i for any element p h 2 pwj zq it follows from claim 2 that i p wjp q q 25 yjpi p qq i p q 0 therefore there exists p h 1 ps 1 d 2 zq such that b wjp q notice that bp q bp s 1 d 2 p qq wj p wjp q q wj p q b since b is injective must vanish and therefore wjp q 0 as claimed in 3 let us now turn our attention to the action of on spinc structures starting with 7 turaev 66 section 2 2 established a natural one to one correspondence between spin structures on yj and quasi orientations on lj using this correspondence one can easily see that all the spin structures on yj are invariant under yj this proves 7 for self conjugate spin c structures since any spinc structure can be written as s h with s self conjugate and h p h 2 py zq claim 7 follows from 2 to prove 6 consider s 0 s 1 y with s 1 a spin c structure on y 1 by 7 we have y ps 0 q s 0 then we express a general spin c structure as s 0 h with h p h 2 py zq and use 1 we are left with 8 take any s p spincpwjq it follows from 7 that wjpsq yj yj ps yj q s yj therefore wjpsq s h for some h p kerph 2 pwj zq h 2 pyj zqq using 3 we conclude that c 1 p wj sq c 1 psq c 1 ps q and therefore 2 h 0 however it follows from the mayer vietoris exact sequence that kerph 2 pwj zq h 2 pyj zqq is torsion free therefore h 0 and claim 8 is proved 5 2 spinc systems and their equivalence in this section we introduce the concept of a spinc system on a skein triangle and relate the spinc systems corresponding to admissible skein triangles with the same resolution data definition 5 8 let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q be a skein triangle and s 0 a fixed self conjugate spin c structure on y a spinc system sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q is the set jpz 3 pspincpwj s 0 q y spin cpyj s 0 qq endowed with the following additional structure 1 the restriction map rj j 1 spin cpwj s 0 q spin cpyj s 0 q spin cpyj 1 s 0 q for every j p z 3 2 for every s p spincpwj s 0 q with rj j 1 psq torsion the chern number c 1 psq 2 p q see 19 and 26 3 the involution wj on spin cpwj s 0 q and the involution yj on spincpyj s 0 q by lemma 5 7 these act by conjugation on the set of spinc structures definition 5 9 two spinc systems sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q and sppl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q s 1 0 q are called equiv alent if signpwjq signpw 1 jq for all j p z 3 and there exist bijections j spin cpwj s 0 q spin cpw 1 j s 1 0 q and j spin cpyj s 0 q spin cpy 1 j s 1 0 q which are compatible with the additional structures 1 2 and 3 in the obvious way we use to denote this equivalence relation theorem 5 10 let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q and pl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q be admissible skein triangles suppose that for a suitable choice of boundary framings the resolution data of pl 0 l 1 l 2 q matches that of pl 10 l 1 1 l 1 2 q then there exist disjoint decompositions sc spincpy q a 0 ya 1 and sc spin cpy 1 q a 10 ya 1 1 with the following properties a 0 a 1 and a 1 0 a 1 1 the vertical bars stand for the cardinality of a set and for i 0 1 and any s 0 p ai and s 1 0 p a 1 i we have sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q sppl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q s 1 0 q the proof of theorem 5 10 will take up the rest of this subsection the idea of the proof is straightforward we give an explicit description of the topology and the spinc structures on yj and wj in terms of the resolution data we begin by studying the algebraic topology of cobordisms wj let us consider the decom positions wj pi y q yi by d 4 and yj y yby ps 1 d 2 q the gluing map in the first decomposition which matches the decomposition 9 identifies by with the standard torus in s 3 bd 4 by sending j and j 1 to the standard meridian m and longitude l respectively the corresponding mayer vietoris exact sequences are of the form h 1 py q h 1 pby q bwj h 2 pwjq iwj h 2 py q 17 and h 1 py q h 1 ps 1 d 2 q h 1 pby q byj h 2 pyjq iyj h 2 py q 18 27 let j m and l p h 1 pby q be the poincare duals of r js rms and rls p h 1 pby q respectively the following lemma is a direct consequence of 17 and 18 lemma 5 11 there are isomorphisms ker iwj z z xp 0 tpy qqy with generators bwj pm q bwj pl q and ker iyj z z xp 0 tpy qq ppj qjqy with generators byj pm q byj pl q under which the map ker iwj ker iyj ker iyj 1 induced by the boundary inclusions is the natural projection map recall that for a cohomology class p h 2 pwjq with bwj torsion the number 2 p q is defined as follows let uj h 2 pwj bwjq h 2 pwjq be the map induced by the inclusion then there exists a non zero integer k and a cohomology class p h 2 pwj bwjq such that k ujp q we define 2 1 k 2 x rwj bwj s y 19 lemma 5 12 1 suppose that pj 0 and pj 1 0 then pbwj pam bl qq 2 a 2 pj pj 1 20 2 suppose that either pj 0 or pj 1 0 then 2 0 for any p h 2 pwjq with bwj torsion proof associated with the decomposition wj pi y q yi by d 4 is the mayer vietoris exact sequence in homology h 2 py q 0 h 2 pwjq b h 1 pby q h 1 py q from which we conclude that h 2 pwjq is a copy of z generated by the homology class r s of a surface with br s tpy qrls the surface splits as f 1 y f 2 where f 1 is an embedded surface in i y bounded by tpy q copies of l and f 2 is the seifert surface for the right handed ptpy q pj tpy q pj 1 q torus link in bd 4 from this description we see that the homological self intersection number of equals the linking number between two parallel copies of the ptpy q pj tpy q pj 1 q torus link which equals tpy q 2 pj pj 1 therefore xpd r s pd r s rwj bwj s y xujppd r sq r s y tpy q 2 pj pj 1 28 comparing this to x bwjm r s y xm br s y xm tpy qrls y tpy q we obtain uppd r sq bwjp ty pj pj 1 m kl q for some integer k whose value is of no importance to us because bwj pl q is torsion from this we deduce that pbwj pam bl qq 2 a 2 ptpy q pj pj 1 q 2 xpd r s pd r s rwj bwj s y a 2 pj pj 1 this completes the proof of 1 to prove 2 observe that the map h 2 pw qq h 2 pyj 1 qq is injective when pj 0 and that the map h 2 pw qq h 2 pyj qq is injective when pj 1 0 therefore any element with bw torsion is a torsion itself let xj wj y wj 1 be the composite cobordism from yj to yj 2 as we mentioned in the proof of the exact triangle in section 4 2 there exists an embedded 2 sphere ej xj with homological self intersection 1 it is obtained by gluing a disk d 1 wj to a disk d 2 wj 1 along bd 1 bd 2 lj 1 where lj 1 is the core of the solid torus yj 1 z inty orient ej so that lj 1 is homotopic to j 2 in yj 1 z inty also recall a decomposition xj p wj 2 q cp 2 which induces an isomorphism j j 1 h 2 pwj 2 q h 2 pcp 2 q h 2 pxjq 21 lemma 5 13 for any integers a b c denote by the image of pbwj 2 pam bl q c pd rejsq under the map j j 1 then wj bwj pam bl c jq and wj 1 bwj 1 pam bl c j 2 q proof it is a direct consequence of the naturality of the boundary map in the mayer vietoris exact sequence that j j 1 pbwj 2 pam bl q 0 q wn bwnpam bl q for n j j 1 we still need to show that j j 1 p 0 pd rejsq wj bwj p jq and j j 1 p 0 pd rejsq wj 1 bwj 1 p j 2 q 29 the poincare dual of j j 1 p 0 pd rejsq is realized by the sphere ej therefore the restriction of j j 1 p 0 bwj 2 ppd rejsq to wj equals the poincare dual of rej xwjs p h 2 pwj bwjq using the fact that ej xwj is a disk contained in the two handle d 4 wj with the boundary lj 1 one can easily verify that rej xwjs equals the poincare dual of bwjp jq this finishes the proof of the first formula the proof of the second formula is similar we will next study the spin and spinc structures on the manifolds yj and wj first define a map spinpy q h 1 pby f 2 q as follows compare with turaev 67 fix a diffeomorphism by r 2 z 2 and let x 1 x 2 be the standard coordinates on r 2 pull back the vector fields b bx 1 b bx 2 via to obtain vector fields v 1 v 2 on by any loop in by gives rise to the loop pxq p npxq v 1 pxq v 2 pxqq in the frame bundle of y where npxq is the outward normal vector at x p by we define psq to be the unique cohomology class in h 1 pby f 2 q with the property that x psq r sy 0 if and only if can be lifted to a loop in the spin bundle for s lemma 5 14 the map spinpy q h 1 pby f 2 q has the following properties 1 does not dependent on the choice of diffeomorphism 2 ps q s by for any s p spinpy q and p h 1 py f 2 q and 3 for any j p z 3 a spin structure s can be extended to yj if and only if x psq jy 1 p f 2 the extension is unique if it exists proof this is immediate from the definition of the map lemma 5 15 any s p spinpy q extends to a spin structure on y 2 and to a spin structure on one of the manifolds y 0 and y 1 but not the other for any s 0 p sc spin cpy q we have the following identity for the counts of self conjugate spinc structures 2 b 1 py 0 q sc spincpy 0 s 0 q 2 b 1 py 1 q sc spincpy 1 s 0 q 2 b 1 py 2 q sc spincpy 2 s 0 q 22 proof since the map h 1 py 2 f 2 q h 1 py f 2 q is an isomorphism any spin structure s on y can be extended to a spin structure on y 2 this implies that x psq r 0 sy x psq r 1 sy x psq r 2 sy 1 23 30 it now follows from lemma 5 14 3 that s can be extended a spin structure on exactly one of the manifolds y 0 and y 1 this finishes the proof of the first statement according to remark 4 2 a self conjugate spinc structure on yj corresponds to 2 b 1 pyjq spin structures therefore 2 b 1 pyjq sc spincpyj s 0 q spinpyj s 0 q and 22 is equivalent to spinpy 2 s 0 q spinpy 0 s 0 q spinpy 1 s 0 q which follows easily from the first statement lemma 5 16 a self conjugate spinc structure s 0 p sc spin cpy q has the following extension properties to the cobordisms wj 1 sc spincpw 0 s 0 q h 2 if tpy q is odd then sc spincpw 1 s 0 q h and sc spin cpw 2 s 0 q h 3 if tpy q is even there is a disjoint decomposition sc spincpy q a 0 ya 1 24 such that a 0 a 1 and in addition s 0 p a 0 if and only if sc spin cpw 1 s 0 q h and sc spin cpw 2 s 0 q h s 0 p a 1 if and only if sc spin cpw 1 s 0 q h and sc spin cpw 2 s 0 q h 25 proof denote by s 10 and s 2 0 the two spin structures on y corresponding to the self conjugate spinc structure s 0 on y then sc spincpwj s 0 q h if and only if spinpwj s 1 0 q h or spinpwj s 2 0 q h 26 since the cobordism wj is obtained by attaching d 4 to the manifold w 0 j along s 3 see 9 we conclude that for both k 1 and k 2 spinpwj s k 0 q h if and only if spinpyj s k 0 q h and spinpyj 1 s k 0 q h if and only if x psk 0 q r j sy x ps k 0 q r j 1 sy 1 with this understood 1 follows from lemma 5 15 since s 10 and s 2 0 correspond to the same spinc structure we can write s 10 s 2 0 p f 2 q by where f 2 is the mod 2 reduction of the 31 generator p h 1 py zq this implies that ps 10 q ps 2 0 q p f 2 q by it is not difficult to see that p f 2 q by 0 if and only if tpy q is odd therefore if tpy q is odd ps 10 q ps 2 0 q by lemma 5 15 one of s k 0 pk 1 2 q can be extended over y 0 and hence w 2 while the other one can be extended over y 1 and hence w 1 claim 2 now follows from 26 if tpy q is even ps 10 q ps 2 0 q define the sets aj ts 0 x ps k 0 q r jsy 0 for k 1 2 u j 0 1 then 24 and 25 follow directly from 23 and the equality a 0 a 1 can be verified as follows a 0 1 2 spinpy 0 q 1 4 spinpy q 1 2 spinpy 1 q a 1 remark 5 17 the disjoint decomposition sc spincpy q a 0 ya 1 of 24 with the additional properties 25 holds only for even tpy q we will extend it to the case of odd tpy q by choosing an arbitrary disjoint decomposition such that a 0 a 1 in our next step toward the proof of theorem 5 10 we will study the set of relative charac teristic vectors defined as charpwj s 0 q tc 1 psq s p spin cpwj s 0 qu to state the following set of results about this set we need to recall the maps iwj h 2 pwjq h 2 py q and bwj h 1 pby q h 2 pwjq from the mayer vietoris exact sequence 17 lemma 5 18 the set charpwj s 0 q is a coset of 2 ker iwj inside of ker iwj which can be described precisely as follows 1 suppose tpy q is odd then for any s 0 p sc spin cpy q a charpwj s 0 q 2 ker iwj for j 1 2 b charpw 0 s 0 q bw 0 pm q 2 ker iw 0 2 suppose tpy q is even and s 0 p a 0 then a charpw 2 s 0 q 2 ker iw 2 b charpw 1 s 0 q bw 1 p 2 q 2 ker iw 1 c charpw 0 s 0 q bw 0 p 0 q 2 ker iw 0 32 3 suppose tpy q is even and s 0 p a 1 then a charpw 1 s 0 q 2 ker iw 2 b charpw 2 s 0 q bw 2 p 2 q 2 ker iw 2 c charpw 0 s 0 q bw 0 p 1 q 2 ker iw 0 proof we will only prove case 2 because cases 1 and 3 are similar in case 2 we have even tpy q and s 0 p a 0 since sc spin cpw 2 s 0 q h the coset charpw 2 s 0 q must contain zero this proves a to prove b note that the image of charpw 1 s 0 q under the restriction map ker iw 1 ker iy 1 does not contain zero because sc spin cpy 1 s 0 q h while the image of charpw 1 s 0 q under the map ker iw 1 ker iy 2 contains zero because sc spin cpy 2 s 0 q h it is now not difficult to check that bw 2 p 2 q 2 ker iw 2 is the only one coset of the four satisfying these requirements this proves b case c is similar let pl 0 l 1 l 2 q and pl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q be two admissible skein triangles with the same resolution data and let us fix decompositions sc spincpy q a 0 ya 1 and sc spin cpy 1 q a 10 ya 1 1 as in lemma 5 16 and remark 5 17 combining all of the above lemmas we obtain the following result proposition 5 19 let s 0 p an and s 1 0 p a 1 n with n 0 or n 1 then there exist isomor phisms j ker iwj ker iw 1 j and j ker iyj ker iy 1 j with the following properties 1 jp q y 1 j jp yj q and j 1 p q y 1 j 1 j 1 p yj 1 q 2 for any p ker iwj with bwj torsion we have 2 p jp qq 2 3 jpcharpwj s 0 qq charpw 1 j s 1 0 q 4 let j j 1 be the isomorphism 21 and 1 j j 1 the corresponding isomorphism for the skein triangle pl 10 l 1 1 l 1 2 q then for any p ker iwj 2 and any integer k we have jp j j 1 p k pd rejsq wj q 1 j j 1 p j 2 p q k pd re 1 jsq w 1 j and j 1 p j j 1 p k pd rejsq wj 1 q 1 j j 1 p j 2 p q k pd re 1 jsq w 1 j 1 with all the necessary preparations now in place we are finally ready to prove the main result of this subsection theorem 5 10 33 proof of theorem 5 10 let a 0 a 1 a 1 0 and a 1 1 be as above and s 0 p an and s 1 0 p a 1 n for n 0 or n 1 we first pick any sw 0 p spin cpw 0 s 0 q it follows from proposition 5 19 3 that 0 pc 1 psw 0 qq p charpw 1 0 s 1 0 q and there exists sw 1 0 such that c 1 psw 1 0 q 0 pc 1 psw 0 qq denote by s the spinc structure on cp 2 with c 1 ps q pd rejs pd re 1 js and let swj psw 0 s q wj and sw 1 j psw 1 0 s q w 1 j for j 0 1 and syj swj yj and sy 1 j sw 1 j y 1 j for j 0 1 2 using proposition 5 19 4 one can show that jpc 1 pswj qq c 1 psw 1 jq and jpc 1 psyj qq c 1 psy 1 j q we now define the map j spin cpwj s 0 q spin cpw 1 j s 1 0 q by the formula jpswj hq sw 1 j jphq for h p ker iwj and the map j spin cpyj s 0 q spin cpy 1 j s 1 0 q by the formula jpsyj hq sy 1 j jphq for h p ker iyj it is not difficult to verify that j and j are compatible with the additional structures in defini tion 5 8 and that they provide the desired equivalence sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q sppl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q s 1 0 q 5 3 truncated floer homology recall that according to theorem 4 6 we have the follow ing floer exact triangle over the rationals fw 0 hmpy 1 rs 0 sq fw 1 hmpy 2 rs 0 sq fw 2 hm py 0 rs 0 sq fw 0 27 let us introduce the constants c 0 b 2 pw 2 q b 1 py 0 q c 1 b 2 pw 1 q b 1 py 2 q and c 2 0 and use them to define twisted versions of the maps j induced by the covering translations on hmpyj rs 0 sq by the formula fj p 1 q cj j hmpyj rs 0 sq hmpyj rs 0 sq lemma 5 20 the maps fj are compatible with the maps fwj in the sense that fj 1 fwj fwj fj for j p z 3 28 34 proof since the covering translation wj on wj extends the covering translations yj and yj 1 on its boundary components the functoriality of the monopole floer homology and lemma 5 7 imply that j 1 hmpwj sq p 1 qb 2 pwjq b 1 pyj 1 q hmpwj wjsq j p 1 qb 2 pwjq b 1 pyj 1 q hmpwj s q j 29 for any s p spincpwj rs 0 sq to explain the extra factor p 1 q b 2 pwjq b 1 pyj 1 q we recall that the homology orientation that is an orientation of the vector space max h 1 pwj rq i pwj rq h 1 pyj 1 rq is involved in the definition of the map hmpw q see 37 definition 3 4 1 here i pwjq stands for a maximum positive subspace for the intersection form on imph 2 pwj bwjq h 2 pwjqq by lemma 5 7 the covering translation wj acts as the negative identity on the space h 1 pwj rq i pwj rq h 1 pyj 1 rq thereby changing the homology orientation by the factor of p 1 qb 2 pwjq b 1 pwjq b 1 pyj 1 q recall that the map fwj was defined in section 4 by the formula fwj spspincpwj s 0 q p 1 q psq hmpwj sq where psq is the f 2 valued function defined in 10 therefore in order to deduce 28 from 29 we just need to check the relation b 2 pwjq b 1 pyj 1 q cj 1 cj psq ps q pmod 2 q for any s p spincpwj s 0 q for j 1 and j 2 this is immediate from proposition 4 3 for j 0 this follows from proposition 4 3 and the identity b 1 py 0 q b 1 py 1 q b 1 py 2 q b 2 pw 0 q b 2 pw 1 q b 2 pw 2 q 1 30 which is a consequence of lemma 5 6 since hmpyj rs 0 sq usually has infinite rank as a z module we will truncate it before dis cussing lefschetz numbers 35 definition 5 21 for any rational number q and j p z 3 define the truncated monopole floer homology as hm qpyj rs 0 sq s y s 0 c 1 psq torsion a q hmapyj sq s y s 0 c 1 psq non torsion hmpyj sq also define hm qpyj rs 0 sq hmpyj rs 0 sq m hm qpyj rs 0 sq we wish to find truncations of hmpyj rs 0 sq for all j p z 3 which are preserved by the maps fwj to this end recall the map tor spincpyjq r 0 2 q defined by the formula psq 1 4 pc 1 ps q 2 signpxqq pmod 2 q for any choice of smooth compact spinc manifold px s q with the spinc boundary pyj sq see 6 definition 5 22 let s p sc spincpy 2 s 0 q and choose an even integer n 0 large enough so that for each j p z 3 the following two conditions are satisfied 1 the natural map hm qpyj rs 0 sq hm redpyj rs 0 sq is surjective and 2 for any s p spincpyj s 0 q there exists a finite set ta 1 a 2 anu hmpyj sq representing a set of generators for hm redpyj sq as a quotient qru s module such that fwj paiq hm n pyj 1 rs 0 sq that this can be achieved follows from 37 lemma 25 3 1 the truncated triangle with parameter pn s q is then defined as the 3 periodic chain complex fw 0 pn s q hm n ps q op 1 qpy 1 rs 0 sq fw 1 pn s q hm n ps q op 2 qpy 2 rs 0 sq fw 2 pn s q hm n ps q op 0 qpy 0 rs 0 sq fw 0 pn s q where fwj pn s q is the restriction of fwj and opjq is defined as follows 1 if b 1 pynq 1 for some n p z 3 then opnq opn 1 q opn 1 q 0 36 2 if b 2 pwnq 1 for some n p z 3 then opn 1 q 0 opnq 1 2 and opn 1 q 1 4 note that by lemma 5 6 exactly one of these two cases occurs we denote this truncated triangle by c pn s q it is a subcomplex of the exact triangle 27 and we denote by c pn s q the quotient complex lemma 5 23 the image fwj p hm n ps q opjqpyj rs 0 sqq is contained in hm n ps q opj 1 qpyj 1 rs 0 sq and therefore the map fwjpn s q is well defined proof we will only give the proof in the case when b 1 pynq 1 for some n p z 3 since the other case is similar we will start with the map fwn 1 since b 1 pynq 1 we have n l which implies that pn 1 1 and pn 1 pn 1 pn 0 using 20 and lemma 5 6 we obtain 1 4 pc 21 psq 2 pwn 1 q 3 pwn 1 qq 1 4 p 1 2 3 q 0 for any s p spincpwn 1 rs 0 sq therefore fwn 1 decreases the absolute grading and the state ment follows from the fact that opn 1 q opn 1 q let us now consider the map fwn 1 for a given s p spin cpwn 1 s 0 q there are two possibil ities s yn is non torsion there is nothing to prove in this case because no truncation is done on hmpyn s ynq s yn is torsion since b 1 pyn 1 q 0 the restriction s bwn is torsion and the map hmpwn sq has q degree 1 4 pc 1 psq 2 2 pwnq 3 pwnqq 1 4 p 0 2 0 q 1 2 the statement follows from the fact that opnq opn 1 q 1 2 finally consider the map fwn for a given s p spin cpwn s 0 q there are again two possibilities s yn is non torsion then hmpyn s ynq hm redpyn s ynq and the statement follows from part 2 of definition 5 22 s yn is torsion as in the corresponding case for fwn 1 the map hmpwn sq has q degree 1 2 and the statement follows from the fact that opn 1 q opnq 1 2 37 note that in general neither c pn s q nor c pn s q is exact we denote their homology groups by th j pn s qu and th j pn s qu respectively the absolute z 2 grading on hmpyj rs 0 sq induces an absolute z 2 grading on these homology groups the maps fj give rise to involutions on both c pn s q and c pn s q we denote the corresponding chain maps by f j pn s q and f j pn s q we also denote the induced maps on h j pn s q and h j pn s q by respectively f j pn s q and f j pn s q with a slight abuse of language we will call all of these involutions covering invo lutions lemma 5 24 for any j p z 3 there is an isomorphism j h j pn s q h j 1 pn s q compatible with the covering involution the map j shifts the absolute z 2 grading by the same amount as the map fwj proof treat the exact triangle 27 as a chain complex with trivial homology call this chain complex c then we have a short exact sequence 0 c pn s q c c pn s q 0 and the statement follows from the long exact sequence it generates in homology next we will show that the chain complex c pn s q only depends on the equivalence class of the spinc system sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q to make this statement precise consider another admissible skein triple pl 10 l 1 1 l 1 2 q and let s 1 0 be a self conjugate spin c structure on y 1 ps 3 zb 1 q where b 1 is a small ball containing the resolved crossing we suppose that there exists an equivalence sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q sppl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q s 1 0 q provided by the maps t ju and t ju as in definition 5 9 we write s 1 jps q and choose n 1 large enough as to satisfy the conditions of definition 5 22 all of the above constructions can be repeated with pl 10 l 1 1 l 1 2 q in place of pl 0 l 1 l 2 q and pn 1 s 1 q in place of pn s q lemma 5 25 there is an isomorphism between the chain complexes c pn s q and c pn 1 s 1 q this isomorphism preserves the covering involution absolute z 2 grading and the relative q grading 38 proof the chain complex c pn s q can be explicitly described in terms of the spinc structures and their chern classes for example when b 1 pyjq 0 each s p tor spin cpyj s 0 q contributes a summand t psq zru u 1 s zru s to hm j pn s q supported in even z 2 grading the smallest q degree in this summand is given by minta a p 2 z psq a n ps q opjqu the covering involution interchanges t psq and t ps q we have a similar description for the chain maps in c pn s q the lemma can now be checked using this description and the corresponding description for c pn 1 s 1 q corollary 5 26 for each j p z 3 there exists an isomorphism h j pn 1 s 1 q h j pn s q that is compatible with the covering involution and preserves the absolute z 2 grading proof this follows by combining lemma 5 25 with lemma 5 24 lemma 5 27 the following identity holds for the lefschetz numbers on the truncated monopole floer homology lefp y 0 rs 0 s pn s qq lefp y 1 rs 0 s pn s qq lefp y 2 rs 0 s pn s qq p 1 qb 2 pw 2 q b 1 py 0 q lefpf 0 pn s qq p 1 q b 2 pw 1 q b 1 py 2 q lefpf 1 pn s qq lefpf 2 pn s qq p 1 qb 2 pw 2 q b 1 py 0 q lefpf 0 pn s q q p 1 q b 1 pw 1 q b 1 py 2 q lefpf 1 pn s q q lefpf 2 pn s q q a similar equality holds for pl 10 l 1 1 l 1 2 q proof the first equality should be clear from the definition of fj the second equality is based on the following observation by 38 proposition 2 5 the map f wj pn s q preserves the absolute z 2 grading if and only if 1 2 p pwjq pwjq b 1 pyjq b 1 pyj 1 qq 0 pmod 2 q using lemma 5 6 it is not difficult to check that this is equivalent to the condition b 2 pwjq b 1 pyj 1 q 0 pmod 2 q this is exactly when the sign before lefpf j pn s qq differs from the sign before lefpf j 1 pn s qq see 30 as a result this kind of alternating sum of the lefschetz numbers for the chain map equals the corresponding sum for the induced map on homology 39 corollary 5 28 we have the following equality of lefschetz numbers lefp y 0 rs 0 s pn s qq lefp y 1 rs 0 s pn s qq lefp y 2 rs 0 s pn s qq lefp y 1 0 rs 1 0 s pn 1 s 1 qq lefp y 1 1 rs 1 0 s pn 1 s 1 qq lefp y 1 2 rs 1 0 s pn 1 s 1 qq proof this follows from corollary 5 26 and lemma 5 27 as our next step we will study relations between the lefschetz numbers lefp yj rs 0 s pn s qq and the corresponding lefschetz numbers on the reduced floer homology definition 5 29 for any s p sc spincpyjq define the normalized lefschetz number lef pyj sq of the map redyj s hm redpyj sq hm redpyj sq as follows if b 1 pyjq 0 we let lef pyj sq lefp red yj s q hpyj sq if b 1 pyjq 1 recall that as in heegaard floer theory 52 4 2 there are two fr yshov invariants h 0 pyj sq and h 1 pyj sq see the proof of lemma 5 30 below we let lef pyj sq lefp red yj s q h 0 pyj sq h 1 pyj sq lemma 5 30 for any s p sc spincpyjq and any rational number q consider the map q yj s a q hmapyj sq a q hmapyj sq for all sufficiently large q its lefschetz number satisfies the equality lefp q yj s q 2 b 1 pyjq 1 q lef pyj sq cpb 1 pyjq q psqq 31 where cpb 1 pyjq q psqq is constant depending only on b 1 pyjq and the mod 2 reduction of q psq in q 2 z proof let us assume that b 1 pyjq 1 the case of b 1 pyjq 0 is similar and easier we have the following non canonical decomposition for hmpy sq pqru u 1 s qru sq 2 h 0 py sq pqru u 1 s qru sq 2 h 1 py sq hm redpyj sq 40 with the lower indices indicating the absolute grading of the bottom of the u tail regarding the absolute z 2 grading the first summand is supported in the even grading while the second summand is supported in the odd grading with respect to this decomposition the map yj s is given by the matrix 1 0 0 1 0 0 redyj s fi ffiffifl the action on the second summand is 1 because yj acts as negative identity on h 1 pyj rq see 37 theorem 35 1 1 therefore if q is large enough so that hm redpyj sq is supported in degree less than q we obtain lefp q yj s q q lef pyj sq tk p z 0 2 h 0 py sq 2 k qu q 2 tk p z 0 2 h 1 py sq 2 k qu q 2 clearly this number only depends on the mod 2 reduction of q 2 h 0 py sq and q 2 h 1 py sq to complete the proof we observe that psq 2 h 0 py sq p 2 z and psq 2 h 1 py sq p 2 z 1 which follows directly from the definition of the absolute grading in monopole floer homology by setting q n opjq ps q and taking the sum of the equalities 31 over all spinc structures s p sc spincpyj s 0 q we obtain the equality lefp yj rs 0 s pn s qq spsc spincpyj s 0 q lef pyj sq 2 b 1 pyjq 1 sc spincpyj s 0 q pn ps qq c 32 where c is a constant depending on b 1 pyjq opjq sc spin cpyj s 0 q and the mod 2 reduction of psq ps q for s p sc spincpyj s 0 q corollary 5 31 if sppl 0 l 1 l 2 q s 0 q sppl 1 0 l 1 1 l 1 2 q s 1 0 q then spsc spincpy 0 s 0 q lef py 0 sq spsc spincpy 1 s 0 q lef py 1 sq spsc spincpy 2 s 0 q lef py 2 sq spsc

spincpy 2 q lef py 2 sq 33 cptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq proof since b 1 pyjq b 1 py 1 j q opjq o 1 pjq sc spincpyj s 0 q sc spin cpy 1 j s 1 0 q and psq ps q p psqq ps 1 q pmod 2 q the constant c in 32 equals the corresponding constant for y 1 now we add the equalities 32 for y 0 y 1 and subtract the one for y 2 by comparing the result with the corresponding result for y 1 j and applying 22 and corollary 5 28 we finish the proof of the first claim the second claim follows easily from 1 and theorem 5 10 we are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section proof of theorem 5 5 for any ramifiable link lj it follows from formula 7 for the murasugi signature that 1 2 lj 1 spsc spincpyjq lef pyj sq 1 8 pljq pljq 34 therefore 14 follows from 33 and lemma 3 1 this proves statement 1 of theorem 5 5 the first assertion of statement 2 follows from lemma 5 2 to prove the second assertion suppose that l 2 is not ramifiable then 2 represents zero elements in both h 1 py f 2 q and h 1 py zq let ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq be the resolution data for pl 0 l 1 l 2 q then spy q 0 and pp 2 q 2 q p 0 1 q which implies that pp 1 q 1 q p p 0 q 0 1 q it follows from lemma 5 2 that pl 1 l 0 l 2 q forms an admissible skein triangle and one can check that its resolution data is ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 1 q p p 0 q 0 qq the equality 33 now reads 1 2 l 2 2 spsc spincpy 0

subtracting 33 from 35 we obtain 1 2 l 1 1 spsc spincpy 1 q lef py 1 sq spsc spincpy 1 q lef py 1 sq cptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 1 q p p 0 q 0 qq cptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq combining this with lemma 3 1 and 34 we finish the proof of 15 in the case of n 2 the proofs of 16 for n 2 and of both 15 and 16 for n 0 and n 1 are similar 6 vanishing of the universal constants in this section we will prove that the constants cptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq and c j ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq in theorem 5 5 vanish for all resolution data the cyclic symmetry of skein triangles will then imply proposition 2 2 and therefore finish the proof of theorem 2 1 definition 6 1 a six tuple pt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq where t is a positive integer s p z 2 and pj qj p z j 0 1 is called admissible is the following four conditions are satisfied 1 p 0 q 1 p 1 q 0 1 2 s 0 if t is odd 3 p 2 p 0 p 1 is even when s 0 and q 2 q 0 q 1 is even when s 1 lemma 6 2 the resolution data ptpy q spy q pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq associated with an admissible skein triangle pl 0 l 1 l 2 q as in definition 5 4 is an admissible six tuple proof this can be easily verified 1 corresponds to the requirement that p 0 x 1 q 1 2 follows from the fact that l is an f 2 longitude when tpy q is odd and 3 is true because 2 is an f 2 longitude by part 1 of definition 5 1 theorem 6 3 every admissible six tuple pt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq is the resolution data of an admissible skein triangle furthermore 1 if ppj qjq p 0 1 q for all j p z 3 then cpt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq 0 and 2 if ppj qjq p 0 1 q for some j p z 3 then c j pt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq 0 our proof of theorem 6 3 is inspired by the proof of 55 theorem 7 5 the idea is roughly as follows starting with two bridge links which are alternating and hence have vanishing we will generate sufficiently many examples of montesinos links with vanishing to cover all 43 possible admissible six tuples we will then apply theorem 5 5 to conclude that the constants in question are all zero proposition 6 4 theorem 6 3 holds for all admissible six tuples with t 1 proof observe that since t 1 is odd we automatically have s 0 by definition 6 1 so the admissible six tuples at hand are of the form p 1 0 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq with p 0 q 1 p 1 q 0 1 and even p 2 p 0 p 1 let us consider an unknot in s 3 with y s 1 d 2 and the standard boundary framing pm lq on by which has t 1 and s 0 for every j p z 3 the manifold yj obtained by the pj qj surgery on the unknot is a lens space of the form yj pljq where lj is a two bridge link the links l j are also two bridge and hence alternating it then follows from 45 theorem 1 2 and 17 lemma 3 4 combined with the relation cited in remark 1 1 between the heegaard floer and monopole correction terms that pljq pl jq 0 the result will now follow from theorem 5 5 as soon as we show that pl 0 l 1 l 2 q is an admissible skein triangle but the latter is a special case of the more general result proved below in lemma 6 6 to continue we will introduce some notation choose three distinct circle fibers in s 2 s 1 and remove their disjoint open tubular neighborhoods the resulting manifold will be called n the

between them by the formula pp 0 q 0 p 1 q 1 q p 0 q 1 p 1 q 0 38 we will say that three points in q form a triangle if the distance between any two of them is equal to 1 two triangles t 1 and t 2 are called adjacent if the intersection t 1 x t 2 consists of exactly two points lemma 6 5 for any r s t p q with pr sq 1 there exists a chain of triangles s 0 s 1 sn such that r s p s 0 t p sn and si is adjacent to si 1 for all i 0 n proof the modular group pslp 2 zq acts on the set q by linear fractional transformations a b c d p q ap bq cp dq this action preserves the distance 38 and hence sends triangles to triangles it follows from the general properties of the modular group and can also be checked directly that for any pair r s p q there exists a p pslp 2 zq such that a r 0 and a s 8 therefore we may assume without loss of generality that r 0 and s 8 observe that there are exactly two choices for the triangle s 0 with vertices 0 and 8 in one of these triangles the third vertex is 1 and in the other 1 therefore we will find a chain of triangles s 0 s 1 sn connecting 0 and 8 to t p q as soon as we find a chain of triangles 46 s 1 sn connecting 0 and 1 to t p q first suppose that the triangle s 0 has vertices 0 1 and 8 the matrix 1 1 1 0 sends 0 1 and p q into 8 0 and pp qq q respectively and turns the problem at hand into the problem of finding a chain of triangles s 1 sn connecting 0 and 8 to pp qq p this is of course the original problem with t p q replaced by t pp qq p similarly the matrix 1 0 1 1 sends 0 1 and p q into 0 8 and p pq pq respectively thereby replacing t p q by t p pq pq if the triangle s 0 has vertices 0 1 and 8 the matrices 1 1 1 0 and 1 0 1 1 can be used to replace t p q with t pp qq p and t p pp qq respectively in summary t p q can be replaced with any one of the four fractions pp qq q and p pq pq one can find a sequence of such replacements making any t p q into t 1 for which there is an obvious solution lemma 6 6 for any p q p q and any adjacent triangles tr s tu and tr s t 1 u one can find a planar projection of the link kpp q tq and a crossing c such that the two resolutions of kpp q tq at the crossing c are kpp q rq and kpp q sq and the link kpp q tq with the crossing c changed is kpp q t 1 q in particular each of the sets tkpp q rq kpp q sq kpp q tqu and tkpp q rq kpp q sq kpp q t 1 qu forms an admissible skein triangle possibly after a permutation for both skein triangles the manifold y with torus boundary is just y pp q q proof let b 3 be a 3 ball in s 3 which contains the third rational tangle in all of the montesinos links at hand identify its boundary bb 3 with the quotient pr 2 z 2 q 1 of the torus r 2 z 2 by the hyperelliptic involution the standard action of slp 2 zq on the plane r 2 induces an action of pslp 2 zq on bb 3 which permutes the points p 0 0 q p 0 1 2 q p 1 2 0 q and p 1 2 1 2 q every 47 a p pslp 2 zq gives a homeomorphism a bb 3 bb 3 which extends to a homeomorphism fa b 3 b 3 by the coning construction fa pt xq t apxq the homeomorphism fa sends a rational tangle t p q to a rational tangle t pa q which can be seen by factoring a into a product of dehn twists a q s p r 1 0 t

u by the coning construction fa extends to the exterior of b 3 resulting in a homeomorphism of s 3 this homeomorphism turns the original tangle decompositions into tangle decompositions of the form kpp q rq t 1 y t p 0 q kpp q sq t 1 y t p 8 q and tkpp q tq kpp q t 1 qu tt 1 y t p 1 q t 1 y t p 1 qu where t 1 is a certain tangle in the exterior of b 3 the conclusion of the lemma is now clear proposition 6 7 suppose the link kpr 1 r 2 r 3 q is ramifiable and 1 rj is an integer or infinity for some j then pkpr 1 r 2 r 3 qq 0 proof in this case kpr 1 r 2 r 3 q is a two bridge link and in particular it is alternating the result now follows from 45 and 17 as in the proof of proposition 6 4 proposition 6 8 for any p q r p q suppose that kpp q rq is ramifiable and theorem 6 3 holds for all admissible six tuples with t tpy pp q qq then pkpp q rqq 0 proof use formula 36 to find a positive integer k such that both kpp q 1 kq and kpp q 1 pk 1 qq are ramifiable it follows from proposition 6 7 that pkpp q 1 kq pkpp q 1 pk 1 qq 0 since p 1 k 1 pk 1 qq 1 lemma 6 5 supplies us with a chain of triangles s 0 s 1 sn such that k k 1 p s 0 r p sn and si is adjacent to si 1 for all i 0 n we claim that for any m 0 n and s p sm such that kpp q sq is ramifiable pkpp q sqq 0 48 we will proceed by induction on m first suppose that m 0 if s k or k 1 the claim follows from proposition 6 7 otherwise it follows from theorem 5 5 1 next suppose that the claim holds for m and prove it for m 1 write sm 1 ts u vu and suppose that kpp q sq is ramifiable if s p sm then the claim follows from the induction hypothesis otherwise write sm tu v wu and consider two possibilities one possibility is that both kpp q uq and kpp q vq are ramifiable then pkpp q uqq pkpp q vqq 0 by the induction hypothesis and the vanishing of pkpp q sqq follows from theorem 5 5 1 the other possibility is that one of kpp q uq and kpp q vq is not ramifiable then by theorem 5 5 2 the link kpp q wq is ramifiable and pkpp q sqq pkpp q wqq 0 by the induction hypothesis the following lemma will be helpful in computing tpy pn a b qq it uses the notation div 2 pmq max tc p n 2 c divides mu lemma 6 9 for any integer n and co prime integers a and b with b 1 py pn a b qq 1 the integer tpy pn a b qq is a divisor of n in particular tpy pn a b qq n with tpy pn a b qq n if and only there exists an integer k such that a kn and n divides k b furthermore if div 2 pnq div 2 paq then the integer tpy pn a b qq is odd proof we will use the notation y y pn a b q the homology group h 1 py zq is generated by the homology classes rx 1 s rx 2 s rx 3 s and rhs subject to the relations n rx 1 s rhs 0 a rx 2 s b rhs 0 rx 1 s rx 2 s rx 3 s 0 one can easily see that the kernel of the map h 1 pby zq h 1 py zq is generated by the homology class a bn gcdpn aq rhs na gcdpn aq rx 3 s and therefore tpy q gcd a bn gcdpn aq na gcdpn aq to prove the first statement of the lemma write n gcdpn aq n 1 and a gcdpn aq a 1 with the relatively prime n 1 and a 1 then tpy q gcd pa 1 bn 1 gcdpn aq n 1 a 1 q note that any prime p that divides the product n 1 a 1 must divide either n 1 or a 1 but not both in either case p cannot divide a 1 bn 1 because a 1 and b are relatively prime therefore all the 49 common divisors of a 1 bn 1 and gcdpn aq n 1 a 1 must also be divisors of gcdpn aq which implies that tpy q is a divisor of gcdpn aq and hence of n if tpy q n the integer n must divide gcdpn aq implying that n gcdpn aq and a kn for some integer k since n 1 1 and a 1 k the fact that n divides a 1 bn 1 is equivalent to saying that n divides k b finally suppose div 2 pnq div 2 paq then n 1 a 1 must be even if n 1 is even then a 1 is odd hence tpy q a 1 bn 1 must be odd on the other hand if a 1 is even then both n 1 and b are odd hence tpy q a 1 bn 1 must be odd proposition 6 10 theorem 6 3 holds for all admissible six tuples with t odd proof observe that since t is odd s must be zero by definition 6 1 we will proceed by induction on t the case t 1 was proved in proposition 6 4 suppose the statement holds for all odd t 1 2 n 1 and consider links of the form kp 2 n 1 p 2 n 1 q a bq an easy calculation with formula 36 shows that such a link is ramifiable if and only if a b 8 it follows from lemma 6 9 that tpy p 2 n 1 a bqq and tpy p p 2 n 1 q a bqq are divisors of 2 n 1 we claim that they can not be both 2 n 1 otherwise by lemma 6 9 again there would exist an integer k such that a p 2 n 1 qk and 2 n 1 divides both b k and b k which would contradict the assumption that a and b are co prime together with proposition 6 8 and the induction hypothesis this claim implies that pkp 2 n 1 p 2 n 1 q a bqq 0 for any a b 8 since tpy p 2 n 1 p 2 n 1 q qq 2 n 1 by lemma 6 9 all the constants cp 2 n 1 0 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq and c j p 2 n 1 0 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq must vanish by theorem 5 5 this completes the inductive step and hence the proof of the proposition proposition 6 11 suppose that kpn a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 q is ramifiable and div 2 pnq div 2 pa 2 q then pkpn a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 qq 0 proof when div 2 pnq div 2 pb 2 q the integer tpkpn a 2 b 2 qq must be odd by lemma 6 9 the result now follows from proposition 6 10 and proposition 6 8 the following simple lemma will be instrumental in completing the proof of theorem 6 3 50 lemma 6 12 for any admissible six tuple pt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq cpt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq cpt s pp 0 q 0 kp 0 q pp 1 q 1 kp 1 qq and c j pt s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq c j pt s pp 0 q 0 kp 0 q pp 1 q 1 kp 1 qq assuming the constants are defined here k can be any integer when s 0 and k can be any even integer when s 1 proof the right hand sides of the equalities in theorem 5 5 do not depend on the choice of framing therefore we can replace the framing pm lq by pm kl lq without changing the corresponding constants for this to be true k needs to be even when s 1 so that m kl is still an f 2 longitude this proves the statement of the lemma proposition 6 13 theorem 6 3 1 holds for any t proof the case of odd t was dealt with in proposition 6 10 hence we will focus on the case of t 2 n with positive n we will consider two separate cases those of s 0 and s 1 let us first suppose that s 1 it follows from the homological calculation in the proof of lemma 6 9 that the z longitude l of the manifold y p 2 n 2 n q is x 3 with divisibility 2 n while its f 2 longitude m can be chosen to be h we wish to show that cp 2 n 1 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq 0 for any admissible six tuple p 2 n 1 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq with non zero p 0 p 1 and p 2 recall that q 2 q 0 q 1 and p 2 p 0 p 1 by lemma 6 12 it suffices to show that cp 2 n 1 pp 0 q 0 kp 0 q pp 1 q 1 kp 1 qq 0 for some even integer k since m h and l x 3 the constant cp 2 n 1 pp 0 q 0 kp 0 q pp 1 q 1 kq 1 qq arises in the admissible skein triangle comprising the links lj kp 2 n 2 n pqj kpjq pjq j 0 1 2 since q 2 is even by definition 6 1 3 the integers q 0 q 1 and p 2 must be odd therefore div 2 pqj kpjq 0 div 2 p 2 nq for j 0 1 and any even k using proposition 6 11 we conclude that pl 0 q pl 1 q 0 to show that pl 2 q 0 we just need to find an even integer k such that div 2 pq 2 kp 2 q div 2 p 2 nq this can be done as follows since p 2 and 2 div 2 p 2 nq 1 are co prime there exists an obviously even k such that 2 div 2 p 2 nq 1 divides q 2 kp 2 which implies that div 2 pq 2 kp 2 q div 2 p 2 nq 51 now that we know that pljq 0 for j 0 1 2 we use theorem 5 5 and lemma 6 12 to conclude that cp 2 n 1 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq 0 let us now suppose that s 0 our argument will be similar to that in the s 1 case but with the manifold y p 4 n 4 n p 2 n 1 q q the z longitude l of this manifold is 2 x 3 h with divisibility 2 n and it also happens to be its f 2 longitude we set m x 3 as before for any admissible six tuple p 2 n 0 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq with non zerop 0 p 1 and p 2 we want to show that cp 2 n 0 pp 0 q 0 kp 0 q pp 1 q 1 kp 1 qq 0 for some integer k this constant arises in the admissible skein exact triangle with the links lj kp 4 n 4 n p 2 n 1 q ppj 2 qj 2 kpjqpqj kpjqq j 0 1 2 since p 2 n 0 pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq is an admissible six tuple p 2 is even and q 2 p 0 and p 1 are odd therefore div 2 ppj 2 qj 2 kpjq 0 div 2 p 4 nq for j 0 1 and any k using proposition 6 11 we conclude that pl 0 q pl 1 q 0 now we wish to find an integer k such that div 2 pp 2 2 q 2 2 kp 2 q div 2 p 4 nq if p 2 0 pmod 4 q this is true for any k because div 2 pp 2 2 q 2 2 kp 2 q 1 let us now assume that p 2 4 2 then p 2 2 q 2 2 kp 2 4 p p 1 q 2 q 2 kp 2 1 qq since 2 1 is odd we can choose k so that 2 div 2 p 4 nq divides p p 1 q 2 q 2 kp 2 1 qq and therefore div 2 pp 2 2 q 2 2 kp 2 q div 2 p 4 nq in either case proposition 6 11 implies that pl 2 q 0 for a properly chosen k theorem 5 5 now completes the proof lemma 6 14 suppose that n is even and the link kpn a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 q is ramifiable then pkpn a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 qq 0 proof if either a 2 or a 3 is odd this follows from proposition 6 11 hence we will focus on the case of even a 2 and a 3 since a 3 and b 3 are co prime there exist integers c 3 and d 3 such that 52 a 3 d 3 c 3 b 3 1 by replacing pc 3 d 3 q by pc 3 ka 3 d 3 kb 3 q if necessary and using 36 we may assume that the links l kpn a 2 b 2 c 3 d 3 q and l 1 kpn a 2 b 2 pa 3 c 3 q pb 3 d 3 qq are both ramifiable since c 3 is odd and a 3 is even we have plq pl 1 q 0 by proposition 6 11 after a cyclic permutation if necessary the triple pkpn a 2 b 2 b 3 a 3 q l l 1 q forms an admissible skein triangle consisting of three ramifiable links by proposition 6 13 pkpn a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 qq 0 proposition 6 15 theorem 6 3 2 holds for any t proof the case t is odd has been dealt with in proposition 6 10 so we will assume that t 2 m by lemma 6 14 all ramifiable links of the form kp 2 m 2 m p qq and kp 4 m 4 m p 2 m 1 q p qq have vanishing these links cover all possible admissible skein triangles with t 2 m therefore we can use theorem 5 5 to conclude that c n p 2 m s pp 0 q 0 q pp 1 q 1 qq equals zero as long as it is defined proposition 6 13 together with proposition 6 15 finishes the proof of theorem 6 3 7 the seiberg witten and furuta ohta invariants of mapping tori let y be the double branched cover of a knot k in an integral homology sphere y 1 the manifold y is a rational homology sphere which comes equipped with the covering translation y y the mapping torus of is the smooth 4 manifold x pr 0 1 s y q p 0 xq p 1 pxqq with the product orientation we will show in section 7 1 that x has the integral homology of s 1 s 3 and that it has a well defined invariant fopxq of the type introduced by furuta ohta 20 the following theorem is the main result of this section theorem 7 1 let py 1 q be the casson invariant of y 1 and sign pkq the signature of the knot k then fopxq 2 py 1 q 1 8 sign pkq proof of theorem c applying theorem 7 1 to the homology sphere y 1 s 3 we obtain fopxq 1 8 sign pkq 53 on the other hand using the splitting theorem 44 theorem a together with theorem a of this paper we have swpxq lefp q hpy sq 1 8 sign pkq for the unique spin structure on y this completes the proof theorem 7 1 was proved in 16 and 60 under the assumption that y is an integral homology sphere our proof here will rely on the extension of those techniques to the general case at hand 7 1 preliminaries we begin in this section with some topological preliminaries including an extension of the furuta ohta invariant fopxq to a wider class of manifolds than that in the original paper 20 the furuta ohta invariant was originally defined in 20 for smooth 4 manifolds x satisfying two conditions h px zq h ps 1 s 3 zq andh px zq h ps 3 zq where x is the universal abelian cover of x to fix the signs one needs to fix an orientation on x as well as a homology orientation i e a choice of generator of h 1 px zq the mapping tori we consider in this section provide examples of manifolds x which satisfy the first condition but not the second which can only be guaranteed if we use rational coefficients therefore we need an extension of the furuta ohta work to define fopxq in this case let x be an arbitrary smooth oriented 4 manifold such that h px zq h ps 1 s 3 zq and h px qq h ps 3 qq let m pxq be the moduli space of irreducible asd connections in a trivial sup 2 q bundle e x all such connections are necessarily flat hence we can identify m pxq with the irreducible part of the sup 2 q character variety of 1 pxq lemma 7 2 the moduli space m pxq is compact proof the spectral sequence argument of furuta ohta 20 section 4 1 works in our situa tion with little change to show that the sup 2 q character variety of 1 x has the right zariski dimension at the reducible representations and hence the set of reducibles is a single isolated component of the character variety which is obviously compact given the compactness of m pxq the definition of the furuta ohta invariant proceeds exactly as in 20 and 60 giving a well defined invariant fopxq 1 4 m pxq p q 39 54 where m pxq stands for the count of points in the possibly perturbed moduli space m pxq with the signs determined by a choice of orientation and homology orientation on x remark 7 3 the original definition of fo in 20 had a denominator of 1 2 which was replaced by the 1 4 in equation 39 in 60 to match the conjectured mod 2 equality with the rohlin invariant 20 conjecture 4 5 it is not obvious from the definition that the original fo should even be an integer although this turns out to be true 57 section 5 on the other hand theorem 7 1 makes it clear that the generalized fo invariant defined herein is not an integer since the signature of a knot can be an arbitrary even integer we conjecture that with the normalization used in this paper fopxq reduces mod 2 to the rohlin invariant of x defined as an element of q 2 z this conjecture was confirmed in 60 for the mapping tori of finite order diffeomorphisms of integral homology spheres and now the formula of theorem 7 1 reduced mod 2 implies that the conjecture is also true for all of the mapping tori x in theorem 7 1 remark 7 4 a closer examination of the argument in 20 section 4 1 shows that the following hypotheses would allow for a well defined fo invariant x has the integral homology of s 1 s 3 and for every non trivial up 1 q representation the cohomology h 1 px c q vanishes examples of such manifolds x may be obtained by surgery on a knot in s 4 whose alexander polynomial has no roots on the unit circle for instance the spin of the figure eight knot in the 3 sphere has this property as do the cappell shaneson knots 10 the latter knots are fibered with fiber t 3 and hence it is not difficult to count the irreducible sup 2 q representations of 1 pxq for example one of the cappell shaneson knots gives rise to a 3 torus fibration x over the circle with the monodromy 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 and hence has fundamental group with presentation 1 pxq xt x y z rx ys 1 ry zs 1 rx zs 1 txt 1 y tyt 1 yz tzt 1 xy a direct calculation shows that up to conjugation 1 pxq admits a unique irreducible sup 2 q representation given by t j x e 2 i 3 y z e 2 i 3 55 and that this representation gives a non degenerate point in the instanton moduli space on x therefore the generalized fo invariant of x equals 1 4 on the other hand the spin structure on the torus fiber induced from its embedding in x is the group invariant one 11 since the rohlin invariant of this spin structure equals 1 the generalized fopxq does not reduce mod 2 to the rohlin invariant of x for the rest of section 7 we will assume that x is the mapping torus of y y an involution which exhibits y as the double branched cover of an integral homology sphere y 1 with branch set a knot k lemma 7 5 the manifold x has the integral homology of s 1 s 3 proof let kptq be the alexander polynomial of the knot k normalized so that kp 1 q 1 and kpt 1 q kptq then h 1 py q is a finite group of order kp 1 q on which acts as minus identity see lemma 5 7 or 31 theorem 5 5 1 since kp 1 q is odd the fixed point set of h 1 py q h 1 py q must be zero now the natural projection x s 1 gives rise to a locally trivial bundle with fiber y the e 2 page of its leray serre spectral sequence is e 2 pq hpps 1 hqpy qq where hqpy q is the local coefficient system associated with the fiber bundle the groups e 2 pq vanish for all p 2 hence the spectral sequence collapses at its e 2 page this implies that h 1 pxq h 1 ps 1 h 0 py qq h 0 ps 1 h 1 py qq z h 0 ps 1 h 1 py qq the generator of 1 ps 1 q acts on h 1 py q as h 1 py q h 1 py q therefore h 0 ps 1 h 1 py qq fixp q 0 and hence h 1 pxq z similarly h 2 pxq h 1 ps 1 h 1 py qq h 0 ps 1 h 2 py qq 0 because fixp q 0 and h 2 py q h 1 py q 0 this completes the proof since the x r y where y is a rational homology sphere both conditions h px zq h ps 1 s 3 zq andh px zq h ps 3 zq are satisfied and the invariant fopxq is well defined by the formula 39 to prove that fopxq is given by the formula of theorem 7 1 we need to analyze the moduli spaces m pxq that go into its definition 56 7 2 equivariant theory we will first describem pxq in terms ofrpy q the sup 2 q character variety of 1 py q to this end consider the splitting rpy q t u rabpy q rirrpy q whose three components consist of the trivial representation and the conjugacy classes of abelian that is non trivial reducible and irreducible representations respectively note that is the only central representation 1 py q sup 2 q because y is a z 2 homology sphere see the proof of lemma 7 5 this decomposition is preserved by the map rpy q rpy q lemma 7 6 the involution acts as the identity on rabpy q proof up to conjugation any abelian representation 1 py q sup 2 q can be factored through a representation h 1 py q up 1 q where up 1 q stands for the group of unit complex numbers in sup 2 q since the involution acts as minus identity on h 1 py q we have 1 which is obviously a conjugate of moreover any unit quaternion u which conjugates 1 to must belong to j up 1 q because is not a central representation letr py q be the fixed point set of the involution acting onrpy qzt u rabpy q rirrpy q it follows from the above lemma that r py q rabpy q r irrpy q proposition 7 7 let i y x be the inclusion map given by the formula ipxq r 0 xs then the induced map i m pxq r py q 40 is well defined and is a one to one correspondence over rabpy q and a two to one correspon dence over r irrpy q proof the natural projectionx s 1 is a locally trivial bundle whose homotopy exact sequence 0 1 py q 1 pxq z 0 splits making 1 pxq into a semi direct product of 1 py q and z let t be a generator of z then every representation a 1 pxq sup 2 q determines and is uniquely determined by the pair p uq where u aptq and i a 1 py q sup 2 q is a representation such that u u 1 in particular the conjugacy class of is fixed by 57 if then a must be reducible hence is not in the image of i if is non trivial abelian we can conjugate it to a representation whose image is in the group of unit complex numbers in sup 2 q then is of the form i a with u aptq in the circle j up 1 q as in the proof of lemma 7 6 in particular a is irreducible and u 2 1 since any two quaternions in j up 1 q are conjugate to each other by a unit complex number the map i is a one to one correspondence over rapy q finally let be an irreducible representation with the character in r py q then there is a unit quaternion u such that u u 1 and therefore is in the image of i moreover there are exactly two different choices of u such that u u 1 because if u 1 u 1 1 u 2 u 1 2 then u 1 u 2 since is irreducible the irreducibility of also implies that u 2 1 in this case the map i is a two to one correspondence remark 7 8 it follows from the above proof that the characters in m pxq that are mapped by i to rabpy q are binary dihedral while those mapped to r irr py q are not the zariski tangent space to r py q at a point r s p r py q is the fixed point set of the map tr srpy q tr srpy q using an identification tr srpy q h 1 py ad q and the fact that u u 1 this set can be described in cohomological terms as the fixed point set of the map adu h 1 py ad q h 1 py ad q we will call r py q non degenerate if the equivariant cohomology groups h 1 py ad q fix padu h 1 py ad q h 1 py ad qq vanish for all r s p r py q the moduli space m pxq is called non degenerate if cokerpd a d a q 0 for all ras p m pxq since indpd d a q dimm pxq 0 this is equivalent to kerpd a d a q 0 and since a is flat and irreducible to simply h 1 px adaq 0 proposition 7 9 the moduli space m pxq is non degenerate if and only if r py q is non degenerate proof the group h 1 px adaq can be computed with the help of the leray serre spectral sequence of the fibration x s 1 with fiber y the e 2 page of this spectral sequence is e pq 2 h pps 1 hqpy ad qq 58 where i a and hqpy ad q is the local coefficient system associated with the fibration the groups e pq 2 vanish for all p 2 so the spectral collapses at the e 2 page and h 1 px adaq h 1 ps 1 h 0 py ad qq h 0 ps 1 h 1 py ad qq 41 the generator of 1 ps 1 q acts on the cohomology groups h py ad q as adu h py ad q h py ad q where u is such that u u 1 if is irreducible h 0 py ad q 0 and the first summand in 41 vanishes if is non trivial abelian we may assume without loss of generality that it takes values in the group up 1 q of unit complex numbers then u u 1 for some u p j up 1 q and h 0 py ad q i r as a subspace of sup 2 q with id one can easily check that adu acts as minus identity on i r hence the first summand in 41 again vanishes the second summand in 41 is the fixed point set of acting on h 1 py ad q which is the equivariant cohomology h 1 py ad q thus we conclude that h 1 px adaq h 1 py ad q which completes the proof let us assume that r py q is non degenerate for any r s p r py q its orientation will be given by p 1 qsf p q where sf p q is the mod 2 equivariant spectral flow defined in 60 section 3 4 for irreducible that definition extends word for word to abelian after one resolves the technical issue of the existence of a constant lift which we will do next let p be an sup 2 q bundle over y with a fixed trivialization and an abelian flat connection in p we are abusing notations by using the same symbol for the connection and its holonomy it follows from lemma 7 6 that admits a lift p p such that since is abelian this lift is defined uniquely up to the stabilizer of which is a copy of up 1 q in sup 2 q the lift can be written in the base fiber coordinates as px yq p pxq pxq yq for some function y sup 2 q we call it constant if there exists u p sup 2 q such that pxq u for all x p sup 2 q lemma 7 10 by changing within its gauge equivalence class one may assume that is a constant lift with u 2 1 59 proof the equation implies that p 2 q hence the gauge transformation 2 belongs to the stabilizer of the connection if x p fixp q then 2 px yq px pxq 2 yq hence pxq 2 is a unit complex number independent of x this implies that pxq itself is a unit complex number unless pxq 2 1 it is this last case that must be realized because at the level of holonomy representations 1 is conjugate to by an element u p sup 2 q with u 2 1 see the proof of lemma 7 6 since pxq 2 1 describes a single conjugacy class tr pxq 0 in sup 2 q we may assume that pxq u for all x p fixp q to finish the proof we will follow the argument of 60 section 2 2 let u p p be the constant lift upx yq p pxq u yq and consider the sop 3 q orbifold bundles p and p u over the integral homology sphere y 1 all such bundles are classified by the holonomy around the singular set in y 1 since this holonomy equals adpuq in both cases the bundles p and p u must be isomorphic with any isomorphism pulling back to a gauge transformation g p p that relates the lifts and u proposition 7 11 assuming that the moduli space r py q is non degenerate the map 40 is orientation preserving proof the proof from 60 section 3 extends to the current situation with no change 7 3 orbifold theory under the continued non degeneracy assumption we will now describe r py q in terms of orbifold representations let us consider the orbifold fundamental group v 1 py 1 kq 1 py 1 npkqq x 2 y where is a meridian of k this group can be included into the split orbifold exact sequence 1 1 y v 1 py 1 kq z 2 1 j denote by rv py 1 k sop 3 qq the character variety of irreducible sop 3 q representations of the group v 1 py 1 kq and also introduce the character variety r py sop 3 qq of irreducible repre sentations 1 y sop 3 q proposition 7 12 the pull back of representations via the map in the orbifold exact se quence gives rise to a one to one correspondence rv py 1 k sop 3 qq r py sop 3 qq 60 proof one can easily see that a representation 1 v 1 py 1 kq sop 3 q pulls back to a trivial representation 1 y sop 3 q if and only if 1 is reducible the same argument as in 16 proposition 3 3 shows that all pull back representations belong to r py sop 3 qq the inverse map for is constructed as follows given r s p r py sop 3 qq choose v p sop 3 q such that v v 1 and define a representation 1 of v 1 py 1 kq 1 y z 2 by the formula 1 pg kq pgq vk 42 if is irreducible the element v is unique hence formula 42 gives an inverse map if is non trivial abelian lift it to a up 1 q representation using the fact that y is a z 2 homology sphere the proof of lemma 7 6 then tells us that v adu for some u p j up 1 q since any two elements of j up 1 q are conjugate to each other by a unit complex number formula 42 again gives an inverse map the representations v 1 py 1 kq sop 3 q need not lift to sup 2 q representations however they lift to projective representations v 1 py 1 kq sup 2 q sending 2 to 1 the character variety of such projective representations will be denoted by rv py 1 kq and it will be oriented using the orbifold spectral flow proposition 7 13 the correspondence of proposition 7 12 gives rise to an orientation pre serving correspondence rv py 1 kq r py q which is one to one over rabpy q and two to one over r irr py q proof let us consider the adjoint representation ad sup 2 q sop 3 q and the induced maps r py q r py sop 3 qq and rv py 1 kq rv py 1 k sop 3 qq the first map is a one to one correspondence because y is a z 2 homology sphere the second map is the quotient map by the action of z 2 sending the image of the meridian to its negative the fixed points of this action are precisely the binary dihedral projective representations 1 v 1 py 1 kq sup 2 q now the proof will be finished as soon as we show that an irreducible projective representation 1 v 1 py 1 kq sup 2 q is binary dihedral if and only if its pull back representation 1 1 py q sup 2 q is abelian if 1 is abelian its image belongs to up 1 q sup 2 q and the image of 1 to its z 2 extension this extension is the binary dihedral group up 1 q y j up 1 q conversely it follows from the orbifold exact sequence that 1 y is the commutator subgroup of v 1 py 1 kq therefore if 1 is 61 binary dihedral the image of 1 must belong to the commutator subgroup of up 1 q y j up 1 q which is of course the group up 1 q since the orbifold spectral flow matches the equivariant spectral flow used to orient r py q the above correspondence is orientation preserving 7 4 perturbations in this section we will remove the assumption that r py q is non degene rate which we used until now to accomplish that we will switch from the language of rep resentations to the language of connections let p a trivialized sup 2 q bundle over y any endomorphism p p which lifts the involution induces an action on the space of connec tions apy q by pull back since any two such lifts are related by a gauge transformation this action defines a well defined action on the configuration space bpy q apy q gpy q the fixed point set of this action will be denoted by b py q the irreducible part of b py q was studied in 60 hence we will only deal with reducible connections in fact we will further restrict ourselves to constant lifts u with u 2 1 because any flat abelian connection admits such a lift see lemma 7 10 let aupy q apy q consist of all non trivial connections a such that u a a and gupy q gpy q of all gauge transformations g such that gu ug the quotient space aupy q gupy q will be denoted by bupy q the following lemma is a key to making the arguments of 60 work in the case of abelian connections lemma 7 14 the group gupy q acts on aupy q with the stabilizer t 1 u moreover the natural map bupy q b py q is a two to one correspondence to its image on the irreducible part of bupy q and a one to one correspondence on the reducible part proof for the sake of simplicity we will assume that reducible connections have their holonomy in the subgroup up 1 q of unit complex numbers in sup 2 q and that u p j up 1 q let us suppose that g a a for a connection a p aupy q and a gauge transformation g p gupy q if a is irreducible we automatically have g 1 if a is non trivial abelian then g is a complex number and the condition ug gu implies that g 1 to prove the second statement consider a connection a such that u a a and consider its gauge equivalence class in b py q it consists of all connections g a such that u g a g a since a u a we immediately conclude that u g a g u a so that ug and gu differ by an element in the stabilizer of a if a is irreducible its stabilizer consists of 1 hence ug gu the group of gauge transformations satisfying this condition contains gupy q as a subgroup of 62 index two which leads to the desired two to one correspondence if a is non trivial abelian its stabilizer consists of unit complex numbers therefore we can write ug c 2 gu with c p up 1 q or equivalently ucg cgu this provides us with a gauge transformation cg p gupy q such that pcgq a a yielding the one to one correspondence on the reducible part with this lemma in place the proof of proposition 7 7 can be re stated in gauge theoretic terms as in 60 proposition 3 1 the treatment of perturbations in our case is then essentially identical to that in 16 and 60 one important observation being that the orbifold represen tations 1 that pull back to abelian representations of 1 py q are in fact irreducible this fact is used in the proof of 16 lemma 3 8 which supplies us with sufficiently many admissible perturbations 7 5 proof of theorem 7 1 the outcome of section 7 2 and section 7 3 is that perhaps after perturbing as in section 7 4 we have two orientation preserving correspondences m pxq r py q rv py 1 kq both of which are one to one over rabpy q and two to one over r irrpy q we omit perturbations in our notations these correspondences give rise to an orientation preserving one to one correspondence between m pxq and rv py 1 kq the proof of theorem a will be complete after we express the signed count of points in rv py 1 kq in terms of the casson invariant of y 1 and the knot signature of k the character variety rv py 1 kq of projective representations 1 splits into two components corresponding to whether the square of 1 p q equals 1 or 1 let e be the exterior of the knot k then this splitting corresponds to the splitting rv py 1 kq s 0 pe sup 2 qq y s 1 2 pe sup 2 qq y s 1 pe sup 2 qq of 16 proposition 3 4 where sape sup 2 qq comprises the conjugacy classes of representations 1 x sup 2 q such that tr p q 2 cosp 2 aq according to herald 27 the signed count of points in s 0 pe sup 2 qq y s 1 pe sup 2 qq equals 4 py 1 q while the signed count of points in s 1 2 pe sup 2 qq equals 4 py 1 q 1 2 sign pkq adding up the two counts and dividing by four we obtain the desired formula fopxq 2 py 1 q 1 8 sign pkq 63 8 strongly non extendable involutions and akbulut corks a cork is a pair pw q which consists of a smooth compact contractible 4 manifoldw and an involution on its boundary that does not extend to a self diffeomorphism ofw sometimes the definition of a cork includes the hypothesis that w have a stein structure see for instance 2 definition 10 3 but we do not require this 8 1 strongly non extendable involutions figure 6 a shows the cork constructed by ak bulut 1 and figure 6 b shows the involution on its boundary this cork will be called w 1 and its boundary y 1 a b 0 0 0 b figure 6 akbulut cork w 1 and the involution on y 1 bw 1 theorem 8 1 the involution y 1 y 1 does not extend to a diffeomorphism of any smooth z 2 homology 4 ball bounded by y 1 the proof of theorem 8 1 makes use of a gluing theorem for seiberg witten invariants which we briefly summarize let px sq be a smooth closed oriented 4 manifold with a spinc structure s and b 2 pxq 1 suppose that x is decomposed as x x 1 y x 2 with b 2 px 2 q 1 let y be the oriented boundary of x 1 and consider two cobordisms m 1 from s 3 to y and m 2 from y to s 3 obtained by removing open 4 balls from x 1 and x 2 respectively let si be the induced spinc structures on mi i 1 2 and s 0 the induced spin c structure on y then we have two 64 maps in monopole homology zhm pm 1 s 1 q zhm ps 3 q zhm py s 0 q and hm pm 2 s 2 q hm ps 3 q zhm py s 0 q denote by 1 and 1 the canonical generators of hm ps 3 q and zhm ps 3 q the gluing theorem expresses the seiberg witten invariant of px sq as follows proposition 8 2 suppose that y is a rational homology sphere then sw px sq x zhm pm 1 s 1 qp 1 q hm pm 2 s 2 qp 1 q y 43 formula 43 is a slight strengthening of the formula that appears just before 37 definition 3 6 3 in that 43 holds for each spinc structure separately rather than for the sum over the spinc structures on x as would be the case for b 1 py q 0 our strengthened formula follows from the remark on 37 page 569 following the proof of proposition 27 4 1 separating the spinc structures can also be achieved using local coefficients as in 37 section 3 7 3 8 but we do not need this in our situation the following simple algebraic lemma is presumably well known lemma 8 3 let a be a 2 2 matrix with a 2 i and trpaq 2 then a i where i stands for the identity matrix proof by the cayley hamilton theorem we have that a 2 trpaq a detpaq i 0 where detpaq 1 if detpaq 1 we obtain trpaq a 0 which contradicts the invertibility of a hence detpaq 1 which implies that a i proof of theorem 8 1 we will omit the spinc structure s 0 from our notations we claim first that the action of on hm redpy 1 q is minus the identity to prove this we will combine our theorem a with a heegaard floer homology calculation by akbulut and durusoy 3 they work with a picture that is the mirror image of figure 6 a and show that hf p y 1 q tp 0 q zp 0 q zp 0 q where the first summand is a tower zru u 1 s u zru s with the lowest degree in grading 0 it follows that hf redp y 1 q zp 0 q zp 0 q and hf redpy 1 q z z with both summands of odd grading with respect to the absolute z 2 grading the parity can be checked using the formula py q phf redpy qq 1 2 dpy q 65 of 52 theorem 1 3 where py q is the casson invariant of y since py 1 q 2 see for instance 62 and dpy 1 q 0 both summands in hf redpy 1 q must have odd grading we translate this computation into the monopole homology keeping in mind the isomorphisms zhmapy q p hm 1 ap y qq phf 1 ap y qq 44 the grading shift for the first duality isomorphism is 37 proposition 28 3 4 while the second equality of the absolute q gradings is deduced from 25 29 21 now the involution makes y 1 into a double branched cover of the 3 sphere with branch set a knot k 1 s 3 as described in 57 and drawn in figure 7 the knot k 1 is obtained from the left handed p 5 6 q torus knot on six strings by adding one full left handed twist on two adjacent strings in particular the signature of k 1 is 16 using theorem a we compute trp q lefp q 1 8 signpk 1 q 2 and using lemma 8 3 conclude that i hf redpy 1 q hf redpy 1 q 45 figure 7 66 in order to compute the action of on zhmpy 1 q consider the short exact sequence in monopole homology 0 hm redpy 1 q zhm 1 py 1 q f hm 2 py 1 q 0 since hm redpy 1 q z z and hm 2 py 1 q z the group zhm 1 py 1 q must be free of rank 3 we define a splitting hm 2 py 1 q zhm 1 py 1 q of this short exact sequence by sending the canonical generator 1 p hm 2 py 1 q to the element ew zhm pm 1 s 1 qp 1 q p zhm 1 py 1 q as above where m 1 is obtained from w 1 by removing an open 4 ball using the fact that hm pm 1 s 1 q maps the canonical generator of hm 2 ps 3 q to that of hm 2 py 1 q we see that fpew q 1 for any choice of free generators te 0 e 1 u of hm redpy 1 q we have a set of free generators te 0 e 1 ew u of zhm 1 py 1 q the action of on zhm 1 py 1 q is then given by a matrix of the form 1 0 p 0 1 q 0 0 1 46 with some unknown integers p and q in what follows we will extract some information about p and q from the fact that a cork twist on w 1 changes the seiberg witten invariant of a certain closed 4 manifold there is an embedding 22 figure 9 5 see also 1 of w 1 into the blown up k 3 surface x k 3 cp 2 such that the the cork twist results in the manifold x w 1 y px intpw 1 qq with the trivial seiberg witten invariant on the other hand the blowup formula for seiberg witten invariants 19 implies that the seiberg witten invariant of x equals 1 for the spinc structure s whose first chern class is the generator ofh 2 pcp 2 q since y 1 is an integral homology sphere there is an obvious correspondence s s between spinc structures on x and x using the gluing formula 43 with x 1 w 1 and x 2 x intpw 1 q we obtain swpx sq xzhm pm 1 s 1 qp 1 q hm pm 2 s 2 qp 1 qy 1 and swpx s q x pzhm pm 1 s 1 qp 1 qq hm pm 2 s 2 qp 1 qy 0 67 if we write hm pm 2 s 2 qp 1 q ae 0 be 1 ce w with respect to the dual basis of zhm 1 py 1 q the above formulas reduce to swpx sq c 1 and swpx s q ap bq c 0 implying that ap bq 1 0 and in particular that the integers p and q are co prime therefore by a change of basis te 0 e 1 u we can turn the matrix 46 of the involution into a 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 now suppose that y 1 bounds another smooth z 2 homology 4 ball w 1 w 1 has a unique spin structure sw 1 which must be preserved by any diffeomorphism by studying the the spin manifold pw 1 sw 1 q one defines the element ew 1 p zhm 1 py 1 q by the same procedure as ew as before fpew 1 q 1 suppose that extends to a diffeomorphism on w 1 then by naturality of monopole floer homology one must have pew 1 q ew 1 but since the kernel of a i is generated by the vector p 0 1 2 q we have ew 1 p 0 c 2 cq for some integer c in particular fpew 1 q 2 c is an even integer which contradicts fpew 1 q 1 remark 8 4 we can prove the same non extension result for other involutions on homology spheres even those that are not the boundaries of contractible manifolds for example an extension 51 of taubes result 64 plus the fact 18 that p 2 3 7 q bounds a spin manifold with intersection form e 8 h implies that the homology sphere p 2 3 7 q p 2 3 7 q does not bound a smooth contractible manifold on the other hand we can construct an involution on this manifold as follows view p 2 3 7 q as the link of a singularity p 2 3 7 q tpx y zq p c 3 x 2 y 3 z 7 0 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 u and consider the involutions 0 and 1 acting on p 2 3 7 q by the formula 0 px y zq p x y zq and 1 px y zq px y z q 47 let i denote the map on hm redp p 2 3 7 q qq q induced by i i 0 1 the involution 0 is isotopic to the identity hence 0 is the identity the action of 1 is computed in section 10 below 68 as negative one suppose 0 1 extends as a diffeomorphism on some z 2 homology ball with boundary p 2 3 7 q p 2 3 7 q adding a 3 handle results in a z 2 homology cobordism w from p 2 3 7 q to itself that admits a self diffeomorphism restricting to 0 and 1 on its two boundary components by functoriality of monopole floer homology w induces trivial map on hm redp p 2 3 7 qq this contradicts the splitting formula for sw 44 theorem a and the fact that it reduces mod 2 to the rohlin invariant 48 theorem a 8 2 constructing corks starting with the cork w 1 one can construct a number of other corks by the method we describe in this subsection recall that the involution bw 1 bw 1 makes bw 1 into a double branched cover pk 1 q of the 3 sphere with branch set the knot k 1 s 3 shown in figure 7 let k be an arbitrary knot in s 3 smoothly concordant to k 1 the double branched cover of i s 3 with branch set the concordance is a z 2 homology cobordism uk from bw 1 pk 1 q to pkq the manifold wk w 1 ybw 1 uk is a smooth z 2 homology 4 ball with the natural involution k bwk bwk on its boundary given by the covering translation corollary 8 5 the involution k can be extended to wk as a homeomorphism but not as a diffeomorphism moreover if 1 pukq is normally generated by the image of 1 pbw 1 q then the manifold wk is contractible and therefore pwk kq is a cork proof the involution k extends as a homeomorphism because does to prove that k does not extend as a diffeomorphism consider the z 2 homology ball w wk y pkq p ukq with boundary y 1 where uk denotes uk with reversed orientation suppose k extends as a diffeomorphism on wk by gluing this diffeomorphism with the covering translation on uk we obtain a diffeomorphism on w that extends the involution on its boundary this contradicts theorem 8 1 examples of knots k which are concordant to k 1 and at the same time satisfy the condition of corollary 8 5 can be constructed using the technique of infection 12 choose a knot in the complement of k 1 that is unknotted in s 3 and has even linking number with k 1 let j be 69 any slice knot in s 3 denote by p q and pjq open tubular neighborhoods of the two knots then ps 3 p qq y ps 3 pjqq is diffeomorphic to s 3 provided we glue the meridian of j to the longitude of and vice versa under this diffeomorphism the knot k 1 becomes a new knot kpj q one can similarly infect the product concordance from k 1 to itself by removing i p q from i s 3 and gluing in the exterior of a concordance c i s 3 from the unknot to j see gordon 23 this gives a concordance cpj q from k 1 to kpj q writing ukpj q for the double branched cover of i s 3 with branch set cpj q we claim that ukpj q is a z 2 homology cobordism from bw 1 pk 1 q to pkpj qq whose fundamental group is normally generated by 1 p pk 1 qq to see this note that by the assumption on the linking number the preimage of the cylinder i in i pk 1 q consists of two cylinders i 1 and i 2 therefore ukpj q ppi pk 1 qq pi p 1 qq pi p 2 qqq y pi s 3 q pcq y pi s 3 q pcq in this identification the longitude for each copy of c is glued to the corresponding meridian of 1 or 2 since the bottom of c is an unknot this means that the group 1 pukpj qq computed via van kampen s theorem is normally generated by 1 p pk 1 qq and two copies of 1 ppi s 3 q pcqq but the meridians of the two copies of c which normally generate 1 ppi s 3 q pcqq are the longitudes of i 1 and i 2 since these are in 1 p pk 1 qq it follows that 1 p pk 1 qq normally generates 1 pukpj qq one can also construct concordances to which corollary 8 5 would apply by replacing a tangle in k 1 with one that is concordant to it see kirby lickorish 34 and bleiler 8 as we mentioned in the introduction the corks are usually detected with the help of an effective embedding a good example illustrating this point would be the corks constructed in 5 using a similar trick with invertible homology cobordisms however this is not how the corks in corollary 8 5 are detected there does not seem to exist an obvious effective embedding that would help detect them 8 3 a re gluing formula the above calculation of the induced action of on monopole floer homology allows us to determine the effect of cutting and gluing along the homology sphere y 1 via in a more general situation 70 theorem 8 6 let y 1 be the manifold with involution shown in figure 6 b and x a smooth closed oriented 4 manifold with b 2 pxq 1 decomposed as x x 1 y x 2 with b 2 px 2 q 1 and bx 2 y 1 let x be the manifold obtained by cutting x open along y 1 and regluing using then sw px sq p 1 qb 1 px 1 q b 2 px 1 qsw px s q proof of theorem 8 6 we wish to apply the gluing formula of section 8 1 to y y 1 note that the orientation convention for y 1 in the above theorem is opposite of that in section 8 1 the key to doing that are the following two observations 1 write mi xi intpb 4 q then the absolute z 2 grading of zhm pm 1 s 1 qp 1 q is equal to b 1 px 1 q b 2 px 1 q 1 pmod 2 q 2 the isomorphisms 44 and the formula 45 imply that acts as identity on zhmodd p y 1 q and minus identity on zhm evenp y 1 q hm redp y 1 q now if b 2 px 2 q 1 the result follows from proposition 8 2 if b 2 px 2 q 1 then both manifolds x 1 and x 2 in the splitting x x 1 yx 2 have positive b 2 and the result follows from the pairing formula 37 equation 3 22 corollary 8 7 in the situation of theorem 8 6 twisting the manifold x along y 1 via the involution can only kill the seiberg witten invariant of x when the piece bounded by y 1 is negative definite in particular if x 1 w 1 the cork twist cannot change the seiberg witten invariant of x this is perhaps more readily seen via the blow up formula for the seiberg witten invariants using the fact which is implicit in 4 that the cork twist extends over w 1 cp 2 9 knot concordance and khovanov homology thin knots in this section we prove the results in section 1 2 3 from the introduction we start with the following lemma which is presumably well known lemma 9 1 let l be a ramifiable link in the 3 sphere that is khovanov homology thin over f 2 then plq is a monopole l space over the rationals that is hm redp plq qq 0 71 proof let us fix an orientation on the link l according to bloom 9 there is a spectral sequence whose e 2 page is kh pl f 2 q and which converges to hmp plq f 2 q we refer to 9 section 8 for the definition of this tilde version of monopole floer homology in particular this implies that dimf 2 p kh pl f 2 qq dimf 2 p hm p plq f 2 qq 48 recall from 32 that the reduced khovanov cohomology categorifies the jones polynomial jl together with the khovanov homology thin condition this implies that dimf 2 p kh pl f 2 qq jlp 1 q h 1 p plq zq 49 combining 48 and 49 with the universal coefficient theorem we obtain h 1 p plq zq dimf 2 p hm p plq f 2 qq dimqp hmp plq qqq 50 by the definition of hm one has dimqp hmp plq s qqq 1 for any spinc structure s with equality holding if and only if hm redp plq s qq 0 there fore 50 implies that plq is a monopole l space over the rationals by the duality in the reduced monopole homology plq is a monopole l space over the rationals as well proof of corollary e this is a direct consequence of lemma 9 1 and theorem a proof of corollary f in the case of a knot k the murasugi signature of k equals its usual signature and the double branch cover pkq has a unique spin structure therefore theorem a reduces to the statement that lpkq 1 8 pkq hp pkqq where pkq and hp pkqq are additive concordance invariants this makes lpkq into an additive concordance invariant this invariant is non trivial for example if k is the right handed p 3 7 q torus knot pkq 8 and hp pkqq hp p 2 3 7 qq 0 hence lpkq 1 proof of corollary g this is immediate from corollary f 72 10 monopole contact invariant in this section we will prove theorem h consider the brieskorn homology sphere y p 2 3 7 q along with the involution 1 px y zq px y z q described in remark 8 4 we give y the canonical orientation as a link of singularity by combining the calculation of heegaard floer homology in 56 with the identification between heegaard floer and monopole floer homology we obtain hmpy zq hf py zq tp 0 q zp 1 q and hm redpy q hm p 1 qpy zq zp 1 q to determine the

in figure 4 either by a direct calculation or by using the formula of 63 section 7 for the knot signature in terms of the invariant we obtain pkq 8 p p 2 3 7 qq 8 theorem a then tells us that lefp q 1 8 pkq hpy q 1 and therefore hm redpy q hm redpy q is negative identity according to 68 see also 47 theorem 1 6 the manifold y admits a unique up to isotopy tight contact structure which is stein fillable and has gompf invariant 2 by applying the involution we obtain another contact structure p q since p q is also tight it must be isotopic to now suppose there is a canonical choice of the contact element p y q p hmpy zq this element is non zero and it is supported in degree p 2 q 4 1 since acts as negative identity on hm redpy q hm p 1 qpy zq we have p y q p y q p p y qq p y p qq however this contradicts the naturality of the contact invariant because p q and are isotopic references 1 s akbulut a fake compact contractible 4 manifold j differential geom 33 1991 335 356 2 4
