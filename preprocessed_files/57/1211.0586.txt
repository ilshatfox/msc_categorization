piecewise linear pl isometric embeddings of euclidean polyhedra into euclidean space a euclidean polyhedron is just a metric space p which admits a triangulation t such that each n dimensional simplex of t is affinely isometric to a simplex in en we prove that any 1 lipschitz map from an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron p into e 3 n is close to a pl isometric embedding for any 0 if we remove the condition that the map be pl then any 1 lipschitz map into e 2 n 1 can be approximated by a continuous isometric embedding these results are extended to isometric embedding theorems of spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra into euclidean space by the use of the nash kuiper c 1 isometric embedding theorem 14 and 11 finally we discuss how these results extend to various other types of polyhedra 1 history and introduction in 19 zalgaller proves that every euclidean polyhedron 1 with dimension n 2 or 3 admits a pl isometry into en this along with the nash isometric embedding theorems 14 and 15 prompted gromov in 8 to ask whether or not this result could be extended to polyhedra of arbitrary dimension answering this question in the affirmitive was krat in 10 but here she asked a more subtle question namely can any short 2 map from an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron into en be approximated by a pl isometry krat proved that this question was true in the case when n 2 and akopyan in 1 generalized krat s work to arbitrary dimensions the above results of zalgaller krat and akopyan are striking because of the equality of the dimensions involved at first glance it may even seem that these results cannot possibly be true but in 6 burago gives a good example making the dimension 2 case more intuitive his example is to use paper scissors and glue to construct your favorite 2 dimensional euclidean polyhedron 3 then set it on the floor and step on it this is a pl isometry into e 2 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the questions of krat and akopyan for the case of isometric embeddings and not merely just isometries obviously the dimension requirements will have to increase but at first glance it is not obvious by how much the dimensions must increase or even if such isometric embeddings exist as we will see in section 4 the fact that such isometric embeddings exist is essentially a corollary of akopyan s result namely we will observe the following date november 27 2013 key words and phrases differential geometry discrete geometry metric geometry euclidean polyhedra poly hedral space intrinsic isometry isometric embedding 1 in the literature a euclidean polyhedron is sometimes referred to as a polyhedral space we use the term euclidean polyhedron to be consistent with 17 21 lipschitz 3 of course not every 2 dimensional euclidean polyhedron can be constructed in this way but this example still gets the point across 1 http arxiv org abs 1211 0586 v 2 2 b minemyer corollary 1 1 akopyan let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron and let f p e 3 n 1 be a short map then f is close to a pl intrinsic 4 isometric embedding for any 0 in light of corollary 1 1 our first goal is to lower the dimension of the target euclidean space the ultimate goal would be to get the dimension all the way down to 2 n 1 the first main result of this paper uses a slight modification of akopyan s result in conjunction with a topological trick to reduce this dimension by 1 to 3 n it is then shown that if we remove the restriction that our approximate isometric embedding be pl we may lower the dimensionality of our target euclidean space all the way down to our goal of 2 n 1 these results are as follows theorem 1 2 let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron let f p en be a short map and let i i 1 be a sequence of positive real numbers fix a triangulation t of p and let v be a fixed vertex of t then 1 there exists a pl intrinsic isometric embedding h p en which is an l approximation of f within shl v provided n 3 n 2 there exists an continuous intrinsic isometric embedding h p en which is an l approximation of f within shl v provided n 2 n 1 corollary 1 3 let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron then p admits a pl intrinsic isometric embedding into e 3 n and a continuous intrinsic isometric embedding into e 2 n 1 theorem 1 2 will be proved in section 4 and all necessary terminology will be defined in sections 2 and 3 akopyan s results also hold for spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra with a slight caveat necessary for spherical polyhedra in a similar fashion the proof of theorem 1 2 2 also goes through for spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra this is part 2 below unfortunately our proof for theorem 1 2 1 does not go through perfectly it does yield a somewhat interesting analogue for the general curvature case though which is 1 below but what is neat about the general curvature case is that we can use the nash kuiper c 1 isometric embedding theorem see 14 and 11 to obtain the third part of the following theorem 1 4 let p be an n dimensional polyhedron with curvature k let f p mnk be a short map which in the case when k 0 is not surjective and let i i 1 be a sequence of positive real numbers fix a triangulation t of p and let v be a fixed vertex of t then 1 there exists a pl intrinsic isometric embedding of p into either m 2 nk m n k if k 0 or m 2 n 1 k mnk if k 0 2 there exists an continuous intrinsic isometric embedding h p mnk which is an l approximation of f within shl v provided n 2 n 1 if k 0 or n 2 n 2 if k 0 3 every n dimensional polyhedron of curvature k admits an intrinsic isometric embedding into e 2 n 2 if k 0 or into e 2 n 3 if k 0 theorem 1 4 will be proved in section 4 all of the results above apply to polyhedra which are locally finite but there are many places where mathematicians study polyhedra which are not locally finite but rather have some other sort of compactness condition one very common example is that the polyhedron has only finitely many isometry types of simplices such polyhedra are studied for example by martin bridson 4 since the spaces considered are proper geodesic metric spaces by le donne in 7 intrinsic isometries are equiv alent to the more common notion of a path isometry in any case this will be defined in section 2 isometric embeddings of polyhedra into euclidean space 3 in 4 and 5 the above results apply to these types of polyhedra as well and this is the topic of section 5 finally additional improvements on the dimension of the target space can be made for polyhedra which are highly connected these improvements will be discussed in section 6 acknowledgements the author wants to thank pedro ontaneda ross geoghegan tom farrell mladen bestvina anton petrunin and many others for helpful remarks and

triangulation 5 so that every l dimensional simplix of the triangulation is affinely isometric to a simplex in either euclidean space el if k 0 the l sphere slk of curvature k if k 0 or hyperbolic space hlk of curvature k if k 0 if k 0 we call p a euclidean polyhedron if k 0 we call p a spherical polyhedron and if k 0 we call p a hyperbolic polyhedron until section 5 we will assume that all polyhedra p admit a triangulation which is locally finite p has dimension n if the maximal dimension of any simplex of a triangulation of p is n throughout the rest of this paper mnk denotes the n dimensional model space of curvature k more precisely mnk is e n if k 0 mnk denotes s n k if k 0 and m n k denotes h n k if k 0 2 2 general position a set of points in rn is said to be in general position if no l 1 points lie on an l 1 dimensional affine subspace for any 1 l n suppose k and n are integers with k n a set of points in rn is said to be in k general position if no l 1 points lie on an l 1 dimensional affine subspace for any 1 l k analoguously if we think of snk as a subspace of r n 1 and if we think of points of snk as vectors in rn 1 whose initial point is the origin a collection of points in snk is said to be in general position if every collection of no more than n 1 points corresponds to a collection of vectors which is linearly independent we apply the same definition to points in hnk where we think of h n k as a subset of rn using the upper half plane model 6 an important lemma whose proof is contained in 9 is the following lemma 2 1 let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron with a fixed triangulation t whose vertex set is v and let f p en be a simplicial map with respect to t let f v denote the collection of images of the vertices of t if f v is in 2 n 1 general position so in particular we must have n 2 n 1 then f is an embedding corollary 2 2 corollary of the proof of lemma 2 1 let p t v f and f v be as in lemma 2 1 if f v is in 2 n general position then for all p p f st p is an embedding 7 5 all triangulations in this paper are simplicial 6 of course this doesn t preserve the metric of hn k but the metric plays no role in the definition of general position 7 where st p denotes the closed star of p with respect to the triangulation t 4 b minemyer as stated lemma 2 1 and the resulting corollary only deal with euclidean polyhedra in order to prove theorem 1 4 we will need the following analogue for spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra lemma 2 3 let p be an n dimensional polyhedron of curvature k with a fixed triangulation t whose vertex set is v and let f p mnk be a simplicial map with respect to t let f v denote the collection of images of the vertices of t if f v is in 2 n 1 general position and k 0 then f is an embedding if f v is in 2 n 2 general position and k 0 then f is an embedding corollary 2 4 corollary of the proof of lemma 2 3 let p t v f and f v be as in lemma 2 3 if f v is in 2 n general position and k 0 then for all p p f st p is an embedding if f v is in 2 n 1 general position and k 0 then for all p p f st p is an embedding we prove lemma 2 3 the resulting corollary follows directly the following proof is very similar to the euclidean case from 9 proof of lemma 2 3 let p be an n dimensional polyhedra of curvature k and let nk be either 2 n 1 if k 0 or 2 n 2 of k 0 until the end of the proof we will treat both cases the same let f p mnk be a simplicial map which maps the vertices of t to points which are in nk general position so n nk it is clear that f is an embedding when restricted to any simplex of t so suppose f is not an embedding then there exists x y p such that f x f y and thus we have that x and y are in different simplices of t let x y denote the unique simplex of t containing x y in its interior where we consider a vertex to be interior to itself let i denote the dimension of x and similarly j for y denote the vertices of x by v 0 vi and of y by w 0 wj thinking of m n k as living in r m for either m n if k 0 or m n 1 if k 0 we can treat f v 0 f vi f w 0 f wj as vectors whose initial point is the origin since f x f y we must have that this collection of i j 2 vectors is linearly dependent so we have i j 2 2 n 2 vertices whose images under f are not affinely independent if k 0 then m n 1 nk 1 2 n 2 if k 0 then m n nk 2 n 2 so in either case the images of at most 2 n 2 vertices not being in general position contradict our assumption on f therefore the map f is an embedding 2 3 pullback metrics and intrinsic isometries what follows is almost directly from 17 let x dx and y dy be metric spaces and f x y a continuous map f is short if for any two points x x x we have that dy f x f x dx x x and f is strictly short if dy f x f x dx x x for any x x x with x 6 x now given two points x x x a sequence of points x x 0 x 1 xk 1 xk x is called an chain from x to x if dx xi 1 xi for any i define pullf x x inf k i 1 dy f xi 1 f xi where the infimum is taken over all chains from x to x it is not hard to see that for any 0 pullf is almost a metric on x the only issue is that we may have pullf x x 0 for some x 6 x but pullf is clearly monotone nonincreasing with respect to so it makes sense to define the limit pullf x x lim 0 pullf x x isometric embeddings of polyhedra into euclidean space 5 where this limit may be infinite we call pullf the pullback metric for f a map f x y is an intrinsic isometry if dx x x pullf x x for all x x x in section 4 we will need the following lemma which is proved in 17 lemma 2 5 let x and y be metric spaces with x compact and let a continuous map f x y be such that sup x x x pullf x x then for any 0 there exists f 0 such that for any short map h x y satisfying dy f x h x for any x x we have that pullf x x pullh x x for any x x x 2 4 a slight modification of akopyan s result in 1 akopyan proves the following theorem theorem 2 6 akopyan let p be an n dimensional polyhedron with curvature k fix a triangu lation t of p with vertex set v and let 0 let f p mnk be a short map with n n if k 0 assume that the map f is not surjective 8 then there exists a pl intrinsic isometry h p mnk such that f x h x for all x p in order to prove theorem 1 2 1 we need a slight stronger version of this result the problem with theorem 2 6 is that the approximation is uniform across the whole polyhedron we need a relative version of this result which allows for to taper to 0 as you move away from some fixed point of the polyhedron the statement that we need is below but before we state the version of akopyan s theorem that is needed some terminology must first be introduced let p be a polyhedron and let x p fix a triangulation t of p for a vertex v the closed star of v will be denoted by st v we define st 2 v u st v st u and for any k n we recursively define stk 1 v u stk v st u then define the k th shell about x denoted by shk x recursively as 1 sh 1 x st x 2 shk x stk x stk 1 x for k 2 notice that shk x shl x for k 6 l and that i 1 sh i x p also note that stk x and shk x both depend on the triangulation that we are considering if we want to emphasize the triangulation then we will put it as a subscript so stk t x and shk t x denote the kth closed star and the kth shell of x with respect to t respectively the relative version of akopyan s theorem is as follows 8 this condition is necessary see 1 for an example 6 b minemyer theorem 2 7 relative version of akopyan s theorem let p be an n dimensional polyhedron with curvature k fix a triangulation t of p with vertex set v and let i i 1 be a sequence of positive real numbers let f p mnk be a short map with n n and fix a vertex v v if k 0 assume that the map f is not surjective then there exists a pl intrinsic isometry h p mnk such that for any l n and for any x shl v f x h x l the proof of theorem 2 7 goes through in essentially the exact the same manner as theorem 2 6 and can be found in 13 for the case when k 0 3 key lemmas the following lemma is proved in 10 for the case when k 0 the same proof goes through for arbitrary k lemma 3 1 let p be an n dimensional polyhedron with curvature k let f p mnk where n n be a short map and let 0 then f is close to a short piecewise linear map it is clear that any short map f into euclidean or hyperbolic space can be approximated by a strictly short map by fixing a point in the image of f and contracting the image of f slightly in the direction of this point one can perform a similar construction for a map into a sphere as long as the map is not surjective we just need to choose a point in the image whose antipodal point is not in the image this is why we require that the maps in theorems 2 6 and 1 2 are not surjective when k 0 the next lemma builds on the preceeding one in the case of embeddings lemma 3 2 let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron let f p en where n 2 n 1 be a short map and let 0 then f is close to a short piecewise linear embedding proof by the preceeding lemma and the comment thereafter we know that we can approximate f by a strictly short pl map h 0 with 2 accuracy let t be a triangulation of p so that h 0 is linear with respect to t recall from section 1 that we are assuming that t is locally finite let vi i 1 be an ordering of the vertices we will construct a sequence of simplicial functions with respect to t hi i 1 from p to e n in such a way that for all k the images of the first k vertices under hk are in general position hk is strictly short for all k and so that the limit converges uniformly to a short embedding h hk will be a distance no more than 2 k 1 from hk 1 and therefore h will be a distance no more than from f the construction of hk is recursive we suppose that hk 1 is defined and we use this to construct hk where we consider our short pl map h 0 to be the h 0 of this sequence let us begin the construction of hk define hk vi hk 1 vi for all i 6 k the work is to decide the value of hk vk let us first consider a single simplex of dimension l which contains the vertex vk in its boundary the intrinsic metric on p induces a quadratic form g on el associated to see 12 which is positive definite since p is a euclidean polyhedron similarly the map hk 1 induces a positive definite quadratic form gk 1 associated to and the fact that hk 1 is a strictly short map when restricted to is equivalent to g gk 1 being a positive definite quadratic form now choose some arbitrary value for hk vk and let k hk 1 vk hk vk en it is easy to see that the quadratic form induced by hk associated with is of the form gk 1 dk where the form dk 0 as k 0 then for hk to be strictly short on we need the form g gk 1 dk to be positive definite but the collection of positive definite forms on e l is open and so we can find dk close to 0 so that g gk 1 dk is positive definite isometric embeddings of polyhedra into euclidean space 7 so if we choose k small enough so that g gk 1 dk is positive definite then the map hk will be short on since p is locally finite vk is contained in m simplices so choose k to be the minimum value chosen over all m simplices then hk is strictly short on every simplex which contains vk but hk agrees with hk 1 on every simplex which does not contain vk and thus hk is srictly short over all of p to ensure that hk is close enough to hk 1 we just make sure that k 2 k 1 now we finish the construction of hk let k be defined as above then consider b hk 1 vk k the open ball of radius k centered at hk 1 vk for almost any choice of y b hk 1 vk k the collection hk v 1 hk vk 1 y will be in 2 n 1 general position so choose hk vk to be some such point this completes the construction of hk notice that the sequence hk k 1 converges uniformly and the limit will map the vertices of p into 2 n 1 general position therefore h is an embedding h will be strictly short on each simplex of p and will be close to f just as the relative version of akopyan s theorem 2 7 follows directly from the proof of the non relative case it is easy to see how to tweak the proof of lemma 3 2 to make it relative as well if using the notation of the preceeding proof the vertex vk is in sh l v we just require that k min 1 2 k 1 l 2 k 1 this proves corollary 3 3 relative version of lemma 3 2 let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron and fix a triangulation t of p and a vertex v of t let f p en where n 2 n 1 be a short map and let i i 1 be a sequence of positive numbers then there exists a short piecewise linear embedding h such that f x h x k for all x sh k v everything in lemma 3 2 and corollary 3 3 goes through for spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra as well we just need to replace lemma 2 1 with lemma 2 3 and in the case of spherical polyhedra assume that our starting map f is not surjective so that we can approximate it by a strictly short map this yields corollary 3 4 general curvature version of corollary 3 3 let p be an n dimensional polyhedron of curvature k and fix a triangulation t of p and a vertex v of t let f p en be a short map which is not surjective in the case when k 0 assume n 2 n 1 if k 0 and n 2 n 2 if n 0 and let i i 1 be a sequence of positive numbers then there exists a short piecewise linear embedding h p mnk such that f x h x l for all x sh l v 4 proof of the main theorems before proving theorem 1 2 let us first show how to prove corollary 1 1 using theorem 2 6 and lemma 3 2 proof of corollary 1 1 let f p en be a short map where n 3 n 1 by lemma 3 1 we may assume that f is strictly short and linear with respect to some triangulation t of p define f 1 p e 2 n 1 to be the first 2 n 1 coordinate functions of f and let f 2 p e n 2 n 1 to be the remaining coordinate functions notice that since n 3 n 1 n 2 n 1 n let be any simplex of t and let gf gf 1 and gf 2 denote the quadratic forms associ ated with induced by f f 1 and f 2 respectively it is shown in 12 that gf gf 1 gf 2 for all t let g be the quadratic form associated to which is induced by the intrinsic metric on p since f is strictly short we know that g gf g gf 1 gf 2 is 8 b minemyer positive definite so in particular g gf 2 is positive definite with respect to all simplices and thus yields a piecewise flat metric on p which is larger than the metric induced by f 1 therefore by lemma 3 2 we can approximate f 1 with 2 accuracy by a simplicial with respect to t embedding h 1 such that g gf 2 gh 1 is positive definite with respect to every simplex t now by akopyan s theorem 2 6 since g gh 1 is positive definite on every simplex of t we can approximate f 2 with 2 accuracy by a map h 2 such that h 2 is linear with respect to a subdivision t of t and satisfies that gh 2 g gh 1 on every simplex of t then since h 1 is linear with respect to t and t is a subdivision of t h 1 is linear with respect to t thus our desired pl isometric embedding is h h 1 h 2 p e n proof of theorem 1 2 1 let f p en be a short map where n 3 n by corollary 3 3 we may assume that f is a simplicial embedding with respect to some subdivision t of t let fi n i 1 denote the coordinate functions of f the embedding guaranteed by corollary 3 3 is not quite good enough here what we need is to approximate f by a short pl embedding f which also satisfies that the first 2 n coordinate functions of f when considered as a function into e 2 n also maps the vertices of t to points which are in general position what follows is the technical proof but the idea is rather simple what we do is one by one approximate each coordinate function fi of f with a real valued function fi in such a way that the first i coordinate functions map the vertices of t into general position when considered as a function into ei so f 1 maps no two vertices to the same number f 2 is such that the map f 1 f 2 maps no three vertices onto the same line etc to be specific what we do is approximate each real valued function fi by a real valued function fi on p in such a way that 1 each fi is linear with respect to t 2 for each 1 j n the map gj p e j defined by the first j functions fi j i 1 is strictly short and maps the vertices of t to points which are in general position 3 fj will be an k 2 n approximation of fj 1 within sh k t v for all j and k so the map f p en defined by all of the functions fi n i 1 will be k 2 close to f within shk t v and strictly short this construction is very similar to that of lemma 3 2 the construction is recursive in both the functions and the vertices so let vl l 1 be the vertex set of t and suppose that fj 1 has already been defined for some j the map f 1 will serve as f 0 and that fj has been defined on all of the vertices before some vl f 1 v 1 f 1 v 1 so there is no trouble starting the recursion note that this means that we have already defined the map gj 1 satisfying 2 above and we have defined the map gj on all of the vertices whose index is less than l consider the real interval fj vl jl fj vl jl for some jl 0 we claim that almost every point in this interval will work for the image of fj vl to see this consider the line segment in e j defined by the curve t f 1 vl fj 1 vl t for t fj vl jl fj vl jl the intersection of this line segment with an affine proper subspace a of ej is either empty a point or the whole line segment but any affine subspace a which contains the entire line segment also contains the line determined by this line segment in particular if a contains the entire line segment then a contains the point f 1 vl fj 1 vl 0 gj 1 vl 0 so if we project a onto the first j 1 coordinates we see that gj 1 vl lies on some affine subspace b of e j 1 whose dimension is 1 less than a isometric embeddings of polyhedra into euclidean space 9 now let vi 1 vim be some collection of m vertices each of whose index is less than l and consider the m 1 dimensional affine subspace span gj vi 1 gj vim e j we want to de fine fj vl so that gj vl does not lie on this affine subspace if m j 1 the only situation in which we cannot define fj vl is if span gj vi 1 gj vim contains the entire line segment f 1 vl fj 1 vl t for t fj vl jl fj vl jl but if this was the case then there would exist an m 2 dimensional affine subspace in ej 1 which contained each of the points gj 1 vi 1 gj 1 vim contradicting the inductive hypothesis that the map gj 1 mapped the vertices of t to points in ej 1 which are in general position thus for any collection of m vertices with m j 1 whose indices are less than l the affine subspace span gj vi 1 gj vim intersects the curve f 1 vl fj 1 vl t for t fj vl jl fj vl jl in at most one point since there are only finitely many such affine subspaces almost any selection for fj vl in fj vl jl fj vl jl will work to satisfy 2 clearly the map f gn will be k 2 close to f within shk t v for jl min k 4 n k 1 4 n where we are assuming that our vertex vl considered above is in sh k t v we can make sure our new map is still short at each step in the recursive procedure by an argument identical to that of lemma 3 2 so we omit it here this completes the construction of the map f notice that since n 3 n 2 n 1 the map f is a strictly short embedding which is linear with respect to t but the reason that we went through the previous construction is for the following consider the function h 1 p e 2 n defined by the first 2 n coordinate functions of f by 2 of the construction h 1 also maps the vertices of t to points in e 2 n which are in general position therefore by corollary 2 2 h 1 is an embedding when restricted to the closed star of any point of p consider the collection st p p shkt v where st p denotes the open star of p with respect to t since t is locally finite we can clearly choose a finite refinement of this collection which covers shk t v this finite collection has a lebesgue number k 0 let k denote the diagonal 9 of cl shk t v cl shk t v and let b k k denote the open neighborhood of radius k of k then b k k c is a closed subset of cl shk t v cl shk t v and is therefore compact consider the function b k k c e defined by x y f x f y en is positive over all of b k k c since k b k k then since b k k c is compact there exists k 0 such that x y k for all x y b k k c now define h 2 p e n 2 n to be the last n 2 n coordinates of f we apply theorem 2 7 to h 2 to obtain a map h 2 so that h h 1 h 2 is a linear intrinsic isometry on a subdivision t of t and with k min k 2 k 1 2 3 accuracy within shk t v then h x 6 h y for any x y b k k c and h x 6 h y for any x y b k k since h 1 is injective on the k neighborhood of every point remark after beginning the writing of this paper tom farrell showed me a paper of enrico le donne 7 in it he uses a very similar argument as the second half of the argument above in his proof of lemma 5 5 proof of theorem 1 2 2 just like the beginning of the last proof let f p en be a short map where n 2 n 1 by lemma 3 2 we may assume that f is a strictly short embedding which is linear with respect to some subdivision t of t 9 k x x x cl sh k t v and cl shk t v denotes the closure of shk t v 10 b minemyer ej 1 e gj vl fj vl jl gj vl 0 figure 1 projecting the interval about gj vl fj vl in the last coordinate onto the first j 1 coordinates in the proof of theorem 1 2 1 we will construct two sequences of pl maps fi i 1 and hi i 1 for any i we will use hi to construct fi 1 and then use fi 1 to construct hi 1 fi will be a strictly short embedding which is an ki 0 approximation of hi 1 within sh k t v and hi will be an intrinsic isometry which is a ki 0 approximation of fi within sh k t v there will exist a sequence of subdivisions t i i 1 of t such that hi and fi 1 will be linear with respect to t i our desired map will be h limi hi h will not be pl since the subdivisions of t get finer and finer as i goes to infinity the reason for the limit is because in general each fi will not be an isometry and each hi will not be an embedding but for judiciously chosen ki and k i for each i and k the limit will be an intrinsic isometric embedding which is k close to f within sh k t v for each k the following diagram shows the order in which we construct the maps along with our desired accuracy at each step here i k i k 1 and similarly for i f 1 fi 1 fi fi 1 h 1 hi 1 hi hi 1 1 2 i 1 i 1 i i i 1 i 1 i 2 we start the procedure by defining f 1 f which is a strictly short embedding we then use theorem 2 7 to define h 1 to be an intrinsic isometry which is k 1 close to f 1 within sh k t v and linear with respect to a subdivision t 1 of t assuming hi 1 is defined we use lemma 3 2 to construct a strictly short embedding fi which is k i close to hi 1 within sh k t v and linear on the same triangulation t i 1 that hi 1 is we then again invoke theorem 2 7 to construct an intrinsic isometry hi which is k i close to fi within sh k t v and linear on a subdivision t i of t i 1 if at each step i and for each k we choose k i k i k 4 i then the sequence hi i 1 will converge uniformally to a function h which is k close to f within shk t v so what is left is to show that at each step we can choose ki and k i small enough so that the limit will be an intrinsic isometric embedding isometric embeddings of polyhedra into euclidean space 11 we will use two separate tricks the trick for the intrinsic isometry is due to petrunin in 17 and the trick for the embedding is due to nash in 14 let us first show that the limit function h is an embedding enumerate the closed simplices of t in some way which is legitimate since t is locally finite then for all i n define si x y x and y are both contained in the first i simplices and f 1 x f 1 y en 2 i the set si being a closed subset of a compact space 10 is compact since fi is an embedding the function i si e defined by i x y fi x fi y obtains a minimum i 0 so by choosing ki i 4 for each k and kl k l i 4 l for all l i and for each k we ensure that any pair of points in si cannot come together in the limit eventually every pair of distinct points is contained in some si and thus the limit function h is an embedding now we consider the problem of the limit being an intrinsic isometry since pullhi x x dp x x for all i n and for all x x p we have that limi pullhi x x dp x x for any x x and it is clear that pullh x x limi pullhi x x dp x x so what we need to show is that dp x x pullh x x for any x x p just as before we enumerate the closed simplices of t in some way now we define ui to be the union of the first i simplices notice that ui is compact for all i and that i 1 ui p let gi hi ui and notice that for all x x in a connected component 11 of ui we have that pullgi x x pullhi x x so choose gi 1 i as in lemma 2 5 and choose kl k l gi 1 i 4 l for all l i and for each k we will then have that h x gi x en gi 1 i for all x ui and thus for all x x in the same component of ui we have pullh x x 1 i pullgi x x pullhi x x dp x x any two points of p are eventually in the same component of some ui which completes the proof it is easy to see how to alter the proof of theorem 1 2 to prove theorem 1 4 parts 1 and 2 the only real difference is to replace corollary 3 3 with corollary 3 4 notice that in the proof of theorem 1 2 1 the general idea is to split the original map f into two maps f 1 and f 2 f 1 is approximated by a local embedding and then f 2 is approximated by an isometry with respect to the remaining metric that is why in theorem 1 4 1 the target space is m 2 nk m n k k 0 or m 2 n 1 k mnk k 0 instead of either m 3 n k or m 3 n 1 k respectively but this problem does not occur in the proof of theorem 1 2 2 what remains is to prove theorem 1 4 3 the trick is to apply the nash kuiper c 1 isometric embedding theorem to theorem 1 4 2 namely we will use the following theorem 4 1 kuiper 11 let m be an n dimensional riemannian manifold and let f m en be a short embedding with n n 1 then f is close to a c 1 isometric embedding for any 0 on a historical note john nash in 14 proved the above statement but for n n 2 and conjectured that it may be true for n n 1 using a more controlled spiraling technique a few years later kuiper confirmed nash s conjecture and therefore the above theorem 4 1 is often referred to as the nash kuiper c 1 isometric embedding theorem 10 the product of the union of the first i closed simplices 11 if x and x are in different path components of ui then we will have that pullgi x x 0 pullhi x x 12 b minemyer obviously the n sphere of any curvature k 0 admits an smooth isometric embedding into en 1 but by the nash kuiper theorem 4 1 hyperbolic n space of any curvature k 0 admits a c 1 isometric embedding into en 1 for the original short embedding just consider the poincare disk model so to prove theorem 1 4 3 just compose the isometric embedding from theorem 1 4 2 with the isometric embedding guaranteed by the nash kuiper theorem 5 polyhedra with finitely many isometry types of simplices bridson in 4 and bridson and haefliger in 5 study metric polyhedra with piecewise constant curvature k but the metric polyhedra which they need are not locally finite so at first glance it seems that none of the results contained in this paper apply to this situation but they do impose a different sort of compactness condition namely that the polyhedron contains only finitely many isometry types of simplices what we do now is briefly discuss how we can substitute this condition for local finiteness to maintain all of the preceeding results contained within this paper as far as the proofs contained in this paper it is easy to trace back through to verify that everything still holds the first place that we used local finiteness is in the proof of lemma 3 2 when we chose k but if there are only finitely many isometry types of simplices then there are only finitely many different restrictions for k this is exactly the same situation as in the proof of theorem 1 2 1 and those are the only places where we used local finiteness what is trickier is verifying that this change in assumptions is legitimate for akopyan s theorem 2 6 and the relative version 2 7 as these theorems were used often throughout this paper akopyan s paper 1 is only available in russian 12 but an english proof of theorem 2 7 is available in 13 the proof of akopyan s theorem breaks down into three parts the first part is to construct a local projection near every face with codimension at least two the second part is to scale the composition of this projection with our given map so that this composition is strictly short the third and final step is to apply an approximation method to each simplex using a theorem due to brehm in 3 one skeleton at a time which builds up the intrinsic isometry the first two easily go through if there are finitely many isometry types of simplices the third part requires the axiom of choice since the collection of simplices may no longer be countable but this is fine and everything goes through to recap every result in this paper holds if we replace locally finite with finitely many isometry types of simplices 6 improvements for highly connected polyhedra combining results from 16 with theorem 1 2 results in the following two theorems theorem 6 1 suppose m is an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron which is also a closed m 1 connected manifold where 0 2 m n then m admits a pl isometric embedding into e 3 n m 1 theorem 6 2 suppose m is an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron which is also a compact m 1 connected manifold where 0 2 m n if either 1 m i can be embedded into r 2 n m or 2 m is m 2 connected 13 then m admits a pl isometric embedding into e 3 n m 12 as far as the author knows 13 1 connected is a vacuous condition isometric embeddings of polyhedra into euclidean
