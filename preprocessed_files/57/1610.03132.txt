riemann surfaces this smooth moduli is an infinite cover of the usual mod uli space mg of closed riemann surfaces and is identified with the schottky space of rank g the main theorem of the paper is closed riemann surfaces are uniformizable by schottky groups of hausdorff dimension less than one this work seem to be the only paper in lit erature to study question of riemann surface uniformization and its hausdorff dimension we develop new techniques of rational norm of homological marking of riemann surface and decomposition of prob ability measures to prove our result as an application of our theorem we have existence of period matrix of riemann surface in coordinates of smooth moduli space contents 1 introduction and main theorem 2 2 covering of moduli space mg 5 3 probability measures

tremal length 16 6 pants decomposition and bound of q c 20 7 proof of theorem 1 1 29 1 introduction and main theorem the main theorem of this paper is theorem 1 1 every closed riemann surface can be uniformized by a schot tky group of hausdorff dimension 1 throughout this paper rg denotes closed riemann surface of genus g a kleinian group is finitely generated and discrete subgroup of psl 2 c denote by the limit set of which is minimal closed invariant no where dense non discrete perfect subset of c we say is of hausdorff dimension d if have hausdorff dimension of d the region of discon tinuity of is c by ahlfors theorem is of finite many components and each is of analytically finite type riemann surface rank g schottky group is g generated free purely loxodromic kleinian group equivalently is schottky group if it is convex cocompact repre sentation of rank g free group fg into psl 2 c in particular h 3 is a handle body and is a riemann surface uniformization of rg by schottky group see next section for details is rg theorem 1 1 states that there exists a schottky group such that rg and d 1 the main difficulty of theorem 1 1 is the lack of relation of uniformiza tion and its hausdorff dimension in fact the question of what possible hausdorff dimensions of kleinian groups can uniformize rg has not been studied at all before there are some interesting consequences of theorem 1 1 which we will address separately in subsequent woks in this paper we will state at the end an immediate simple consequence of theorem 1 1 which implies existence of period matrix in smooth moduli coordinates 2 strategy of the proof of theorem 1 1 first we derive a criteria for handle body to be uniformizable by a classical schottky group to do so we establish an new relation between hausdorff dimension of limit set of with it s primitive elements this is done by a generalization of paradoxically decomposing 9 17 the probability mea sure on the limit set to its generators and integrate over all primitive bases from this decomposition we derive an new family of probability measures supported locally about each generators by using relations among this fam ily of probability measures we derive an lower bound on the growth of the mean primitive displacement of generating elements of we show that the mean primitive displacement growth implies upper bounds on hausdorff di mension the measure decomposition is done abstractly on cayley graph of free group in section 3 the growth estimate is done for handle body and is given in section 4 secondly that given a riemann surface rg it is identified as the confor mal boundary of infinity m of hyperbolic 3 manifold m h 3 this conformal identification is through markings on rg more precisely it is classical known fact that 3 5 we have a morphism from canonical basis with orientation of h 1 rg z into schottky space this is done by represent ing half basis of a given basis by conformal maps of c every half basis of a given canonical basis generates a subgroup of h 1 rg z the morphism es tablishes a injective corresponds of these subgroups into the schottky space we call a given half basis of a canonical basis a homological marking how ever it is completely unknown when a given point of schottky space can actually cover a point of moduli space mg we study homological markings by defining a real function q on markings of rg we call it rational norm of a marking this is defined through ratio of geodesic representative curves with the dual geodesic to the marking geodesic as the unique minimal curve we also define a conformal invariant of rg the q spectrum ofrg as the collection ofq values under variation of all markings of rg we then establish an inequality lemma 5 5 between translation length of primitive elements of the image schottky group toq this is done through the use of theory of extremal length where we use interpolation of hyperbolic metrics on planar domains next we show that there exists some marking such that q is bounded below by 2 g g log 2 g for some g 2 we call a marking such that q satis 3 fies this lower bound is positive this is done by study geodesic length ratios through elementary arcs which are part of the marking curve on pants de compositions of rg the existence proof of lemma 6 1 is by contradiction under assumption we show by computation one can always choose elemen tary arcs to construct curves for c so that q c achieve value greater than 2 g g log 2 g these computations are done on pair of pants next we show that there exists some marking such that q satisfies the lower bound inequality as in lemma 5 5 under action of stab sp 2 g z stabilizer subgroup of this is proposition 6 4 the idea is that by taken a marking provided by lemma 6 1 we can show either this marking stays positive under elementary matrices elm of stab or there must exists an other marking that have larger value of q which will be positive under elm in fact the ratio of lengths will increase under dehn twist proposition 6 4 implies that there exists a marking such that all primitive elements of the schottky group will have the desired mean displacement on the handle body this is show in proposition 6 6 finally we use these marking estimates and result on handle body haus dorff dimension estimates to finish proof of the main theorem as an imme diate

mom junlan wang 4 2 covering of moduli space mg we give here a very brief and basic introduction of jg as smooth moduli of a closed riemann surface rg see 3 15 13 25 24 for backgrounds materials and some of the details schottky group of rank g is defined as convex cocompact discrete faith ful representation of fg in psl 2 c it follows that is freely generated by purely loxodromics i g 1 this implies we can find collection of dis jointed closed topological disks di d i 1 i g in the riemann sphere h 3 c with boundary curves di i d i i by definition i are closed jordan curves in riemann sphere h 3 such that i i i and i di d i whenever there exists a set i g of generators with all i i as circles then it is called a classical schottky group with 1 g classical generators schottky space jg is defined as space of all rank g schottky groups up to conjugacy by psl 2 c by normalization we can chart jg by 3 g 3 complex parameters hence jg is 3 g 3 dimensional complex manifold the biho molomorphic auto jg group is out fg which is isomorphic to subgroup of the handle body group on the other hand jg o is not submanifold in fact it is nontrivial result due to marden that jg o is non empty and non dense set of j however it follows from a theorem of hou 16 j g o is 3 g 3 dimensional complex submanifold here j g o denotes space of classical schottky groups of hausdorff dimension let tg and modg be the techimuller space of rg and it s mapping class group respectively tg is the universal cover of jg in fact there exists subgroup mod g modg which depends on a given symplectic morphism g fg the dependence of is only up to conjugacy within modg it follows mod g is infinite index torsion free subgroup of modg since tg modg mg we have the following commutative diagram of holomorphic covers tg u f jg s mg in particular jg is infinite cover of mg hence can be considered smooth moduli of rg we end this section by restating theorem 1 1 theorem 2 1 let rg mg there exist 1 s rg of d 1 5 3 probability measures and w x on schot tky space let be a finitely generated free group with generating set we denote the collection of all generating sets by w for schottky group with chosen point x of hyperbolic space h 3 we also denote the minimal generator of with respect to x by wx dist x x g we also denote the cayley graph of with symmetric generating set s 1 by c s definition 3 1 for schottky group we define w the set of collection of all free basis of w x of at point x as w x inf w wx we call w x the mean norm of w theorem 3 2 let be a schottky group of rank g and hausdorff dimension d there exist nonatomic borel measure x on w of total mass 1 such that d log g x w w x let be schottky group suppose m 1 g is the basis of minimal translational length t j then we can estimate x w based on relations among elements of this minimal basis corollary 3 3 let be a schottky group suppose there exists 0 such that t j t i for i j m then there exists x h 3 such that d 1 log 2 1 log g w x theorem 3 2 is proved by constructing families of borel probability mea sures on the limit set these probability measures are averages over w of measures associated to elements of w we first state a decomposition lemma on c s w with respect to some chosen symmetric generating set s and word metric w note that c s w is gromov hyerbolic or hyperbolic 6 let o be quasi conformal measure which is the patterson sullivan mea sure 8 on c s w it is given by c 1 d o 1 o d o d o c d o 1 o c 0 where d o 1 o e d bo 1 o with bo 1 o the buseman func tion we normalize so that o is always taken to be probability measure on c in addition when we choose a indexing of w we denote it by j lemma 3 4 there exists borel measures o o on c w with o a probability measure and for each w we have a family of borel measures o and o 1 on c and c 0 c c c 1 c of the following properties o o o o 1 o is probability measures on c and o c 1 for each w d o d o d o d o 1 g 1 c c c d o 1 o d o 1 c d o for the proof of next lemma will be based on a generalization of culler shalen paradoxical measure decompositions for isometry groups of h 3 17 these paradoxical decomposition were first done by culler shalen 9 for the case of 2 generated cocompact kleinian group and later generalized in 17 to all free finitely generated subgroups of psl 2 c they were interested in the embedded margulis tube volume bounds lemma 3 5 there exists collection of borel measures o 1 on c such that o o is probability measure and o 1 7 o is measures of total mass 1 in addition there exists c c 1 c such that c c d o 1 o d o 1 g 1 c where c 0 c in addition we have 1 g 1 c c c d o 1 o d o 1 c d o proof let s 1 let us write every element as a reduced word w 1 wn with wj s then we have the decomposition of as 1 s i where i is the set of nontrivial elements in with inital letter by the fact that act freely on c we have c o o s v where v wo w i let v denote the collection consisting of all sets of the form s v or o s v for s s by poincare series delta mass construction lim s d v v exp s dist o v v v v exp s dist o v with c and v 17 proposition 2 5 we get a family of borel measures y v y c for each s and supp y v v c in general we need to p then o c is a probability measure on c in fact o c is the normalized patterson sullivan measure centered at point o define o v for each s by the above decomposition of c we have o c o o s but o o 0 since c v 1 1 v we have 1 v v then by quasiconformal transformation property of patterson sullivan measure we get o v 1 o c v 1 1 o 1 this implies we have d o v c d o 1 o d o v for some c c 1 c from this we get c c d o 1 o d 1 c d 1 o c 1 c d 8 since o c 1 we have one of 1 must have total weight over c of 1 2 this is one of the property two that we exploit later in next corollary to show lower bounds of o based on indexing choice of w set c c d o 1 there exists c c 1 c such that o 1 o 1 o o o c g 1 c c d o 1 satisfies our conditions proof proposition 3 4 for w define measures by o o and o o 1 by lemma 3 5 o is a probability measures on c index w i 1 i set o n 1 n n i 1 o i i o n 1 n n i 1 o i i we extend o n o n to c w trivially by setting it to be zero on w j n j note that since o j are probability measures we have for all n c w d o n 1 since o j c 1 for all j we have c d o n 1 we have the weak limit of n o and n o by construction we have o satisfies our conditions corollary 3 6 there exists a sequence of borel measures o n on c w such that support of o n is c j n j for a given index of w and o n o weakly in addition o is a probability measure so it s total weight is independent on index of w and there exists a indexing of w such that o c w 1 2 proof since o n for all n are probability measures we can easily see by our construction in the proof of proposition 3 4 that o n o is indexing independent of w 9 we can choose a indexing of w such that given i we have either i 1 i 1 is the inverse of i since o o i o 1 i we have by using this indexing o n c w o 2 c alternatively if given a index ing such that o c w 1 2 then we can replace all i with 1 i this would imply 1 n n i 1 o i c w 1 2 for large n hence we have required result 4 hausdorff dimension of handlebody take to schottky group then the parameter in lemma 3 5 is c 1 let be the limit set of which is the minimal invariant uniformly perfect closed no where dense subset of c the open invariant set c is the region of discontinuity of then d from previous section is the hausdorff dimension of which we denote by d we also have c is identified with since is convex cocompact c is quasi isometric to ch convex hull of in addition the density x 1 x is the poisson kernel on h 3 c explicitly we have 17 x 1 x d 1 cosh dist x x sinh dist x x cos 1 xx d here dist x y is the hyperbolic distance for x y h 3 hence we can proceed explicit computation of measure over we summary this in the following corollary 4 1 let be schottky group lemma 3 5 holds for c 1 and d o o given by the poisson kernel we denote x 1 x 0 for x 1 x when 1 xx 0 this is simply exp dist x x given we define is the generating set given by and this is the generating set given by shifting the original by next we will prove a lemma that will bound the mean displacement of any given at a point to that of the derivative of x with respect to some transformed measure this will provide connection between the mean displacement of with measures x 10 lemma 4 2 shifting lemma define d x d x 1 x d x 1 then there exists such that d x d x d x 1 x 0 g remark 4 3 note that d x 1 x 0 is notation for exp d dist 1 x x recall that patterson sullivan measures provides exact quasiconformal distortions under group transformation the idea of this lemma is that we want to somehow gauge the distortion created when we change the measure x under transformations more precisely we want to estimate the distor tion under nielsen transformation the point of shifting lemma is to estimate the lower bound of this distortion which states that the distortion is at least the average of overall distortion proof let 0 small define subset e x 1 xx let such that x 1 e x x 1 e x for all note that supp x 1 v 1 for we have supp x 1 supp x 1 1 supp x 1 x 1 x 1 this implies that for i 1 word start with we have x 1 e x x 1 e x for all hence we have 11 lim 0 e x d x 1 x d x 1 e x d x 1 lim 0 inf e x d x 1 x e x d x 1 e x d x 1 lim 0 inf e x d x 1 x x 1 e x e x d x 1 lim 0 inf e x d x 1 x x 1 e x g x 1 e x d x 1 x 0 g proof theorem 3 2 let n 0 be a large integer by lemma 3 4 and corollary 3 6 there exists n 0 such that w d x 1 n 1 j n 1 n d x j 1 n 1 j n j 1 n d x 1 n 1 j n j 1 n g 1 c j d x 1 x d x 1 since c 1 and c j 0 1 for all j we have 1 n g 1 j n j 1 n d x 1 x d x 1 by shifting lemma 4 2 for every j there exists j j such that j d x 1 x d x 1 j j d x 1 j d x 1 x 0 g 12 hence we have w d x 1 n g inf w d x 1 x 0 g 1 j n j j 1 n d x 1 note the above inequality holds for any chosen indexing of w and by corol lary 3 6 we can choose some indexing such that x w 1 2 how ever our shifting is indexing dependent hence we can t in general simply just bound by 1 2 unless we have some bounds on generators translation length w d x 1 n g inf w d x 1 x 0 g 1 i n ji ji 1 n d x 1 1 n g inf w d x 1 x 0 g 1 i n 1 n d x ji ji since d x 1 0 exp d dist x 1 x 1 n g inf w ed dist x 1 x g w d x by x w 1 and x w we have 1 1 n x w g inf w ed dist x 1 x g this implies that inf w ed dist x 1 x g g 1 n x w from the inequality inf w d dist x 1 x g inf w log ed dist x 1 x g and since n is arbitrarily small hence we have d log g x w w x 13 to give best possible estimate of x w we need some control of the shifting of w this shifting information is provided by the the relationship among the generators the idea is to pick the best possible indexing of w such that the shifting will remain sufficiently bounded below along the indexing corollary 4 4 let be a schottky group such that there exists x h 3 and indexing of w j j such that all shifting j j have x 1 1 2 g for j j then d 2 log g w x we can obtain an similar estimate with average bounds on x 1 as fol lows corollary 4 5 let be a schottky group such that there exists x h 3 and indexing of w j j with x 1 1 g 1 j x 1 for every j then d 2 log g w x let be schottky group suppose m 1 g is the basis of min imal translational length t j then we can estimate x j based on relations among elements of this minimal basis corollary 4 6 let be a schottky group suppose there exists 1 such that t j t i for i j m then there exists x h 3 such that d 1 log 2 1 log g w x proof for convex cocompact patterson sullivan measure is the unique d hausdorff measure this implies x g 1 is absolutely continuous to the hausdorff measure of support v g 1 by t j t i we can choose x h 3 such that x 1 k 1 2 g for some k m and the total mass of x 1 j is bounded by x 1 j x 1 i let m j j i j i 6 j be the shifted basis since m j j x 1 x 1 j we have m j x 1 x 1 k m j j x 1 x 1 k x 1 k 2 2 g 14 using the notations in the proof of theorem 3 2 since m is the minimal length generator basis we can choose an indexing of w such that 1 i n 1 n ji ji x 1 2 2 g this implies that x w 2 2 g which give the result rather than uniform bound of we can relax the condition of corollary 4 6 between ti tj arrange t i t j for i j as follows suppose tj jiti for some collection of ji 1 i j we take convention that ij 1 for i j if j is the shifting generator for m j then by replacing generator k for k j 1 if j 1 and k 2 when j 1 with its inverse in m if necessary we can assume that x 1 k 1 2 g this implies that m j x 1 2 2 g jk set supjk jk we have the following version of above corollary corollary 4 7 let be a schottky group suppose there exists ij 1 such that t j jit i i j for i j m then there exists x h 3 such that d 1 log 2 1 log g w x finally we mention couple of interesting consequences of theorem 3 2 related to injectivity radius and classical schottky groups define hc sup such that all schottky group of d is classical hc is the maximal parameter such that if have hausdorff dimension hc then is classical schottky group it follows from theorem of hou 16 such that hc exists we have next obvious corollary corollary 4 8 there exists c 0 such that any schottky group of rank g with w x c log g x w for all x h 3 is classical schottky group proof by a theorem of hou 16 there exists maximal hc 0 such that any finitely generated free kleinian with hausdorff dimension hc is classical schottky group set 1 hc completes the proof corollary 4 9 let h h 3 be hyperbolic handlebody of rank g 1 such that x w 1 2 there exists universal c 0 such that if the injectivity radius ih of h satisfies ih c log 2 g then h is uniformized by classical schottky group 15 for a hyperbolic 3 manifold m if the 1 m is not free then there is imbedded surface which would put an upper bounds on the injectivity radius hence for sufficiently large injectivity of a given hyperbolic 3 manifold the fundamental group must be free so we have the following corollary corollary 4 10 let m be a hyperbolic 3 manifold with fundamental group of rank g if im c log g x w then m is unformized by a classical schottky group 5 rational norm q of homological markings on rg and extremal length let h 1 rg z be the first homology group and denote by b 1 the set of canonical basis of h 1 rg z this is given by class i i satisfies i j i j 0 and i j ij j i ij let b 1 bh 1 be the projection to the collection of first set of g cycles i g 1 i e i j 0 half basis denote b the subgroup of h 1 rg z generated by c bh 1 we define b 1 2 to be the collection of all such subgroups b for c bh 1 there exists a bh 1 jg maps into the schottky space the map is a morphism such that maps all j j 1 j g the curves 1 g are called cut system denote c 1 g the image schottky group of c under each b subgroup of h 1 rg z generated by 1 g uniquely determines c different set of i which generates same subgroup of h 1 rg z gives same schottky group under of different set of generators which corresponds to i cut system we have injective map of b 1 2 into jg the fundamental domain of c is conformally equivalent to the planar genus zero domain rg 1 i g i for details see 3 5 we denote the region of discontinuity of the image schottky group c by c the domain c is hyperbolic planar domain with hyperbolic metric c which is the c invariant poincare metric of hyperbolic disk if r is the poincare hyperbolic metric of rg then we have holomorphic covering map s c c rg r b 1 is invariant under the symplectic group sp 2 g z let stab denote the normal subgroup of stabilizer of b the subgroup stab is generated by elements which corresponds to nielsen transformations of generators of c 16 let sp 2 g z we define the action c for c bh 1 as 1 c we also set b h 1 bh 1 stab denote elements of b h 1 by c given c i g 1 bh 1 the collection of g cycles j g 1 1 c are called dual cycles of i cycles denote this collection by d we also denote by d i to be the collection of all dual cycles to i in d i e simple closed curves in d of intersection 1 with i for any given curve rg r we denote the hyperbolic length of by this is also the hyperbolic length in 1 s c c for c bh 1 denote c i as i the i th cut system cycles c i is the hyperbolic length of the geodesic representative curve of i since rg is compact there exists a unique i d i geodesic representative curve such that i inf d i we also define the following notations c i 2 c i c i d 2 i remark 5 1 we make convention that for a c bh 1 represented by geodesics i g 1 we identify c to a basis in h 1 rg z by adjoining the i the unique geodesic cycles as i i so we speak of c as basis and element of bh 1 interchangeably through this identification definition 5 2 let c bh 1 we also define the rational norms q c i of c as the collection of all q c q c i c i d c i q c g i 1 q c i definition 5 3 we define q the q spectrum of rg as q rg q c c bh 1 note q rg is non discrete countable set next proposition is obvious proposition 5 4 q rg is conformal invariant and defines a set valued function on mg let t c i g 1 denote the collection of translation length of elements i c set t c 1 g 1 i g t c i we call t c the schottky length of c given rg a riemann surface or domain of c denote conf rg space of all conformal metric on rg locally conf rg is given by quadratic differential z dz 2 17 let be a collection of curves in rg recall the extremal length erg is given by erg sup conf rg inf 2 rg 2 note that it is simple fact that erg is conformal invariant next we will use extremal length to establish lower bounds of t c i by q c i lemma 5 5 t c i 2 q c i proof let ci c i c be the lift of c i which are jordan curves that bounds disjoint closed disks di d i such such i ci c i i d o i d c i here i is generators of c given by c as before c is the hyperbolic metric on c let i be the collection of all paths connecting ci to c i in c let ri c di d i also set r c i di d i and d c i j 6 i dj d j note that since r c c defines a hyperbolic metric on r let w be any curve in r connecting di d i let w be the c hyperbolic length of w denote u collection of all curves in ri connecting di d i choose a con formal metric hw on ri such that infu u hw u w let 0 such that the d neighborhood of d c i is d di d i choose a z smooth function of c which is approximate characteristic cut off function such that z 1 if z r 0 if x d and d 2 w d 2 c dh 2 w 1 is of negatively pinched curvature if we denote metric density by the same notation and write hyperbolic metric in conformal factors e c dz and ehw dz we have w c 1 hw is family of pinched negatively curved metric on ri first we establish bounds of q c i by extremal length eri it follows from the isoperimetric inequality for negatively pinched mani fold 2 27 we have ri w 2 ci c i w 2 18 eri i sup conf ri inf i 2 ri 2 inf i w 2 ri w 2 by isoperimetric inequality we have inf i w 2 ci c i w 2 since assuming is sufficiently small we have ci c i w ci c i c with 0 we have inf i w 2 ci c i c 2 by infu u hw u w implies all curves u in ri connecting di d i that intersects dci must have w u w let v denote curves in r connecting di d i since w is a curve in r hence we have inf i w inf v vi v w since for v r we have v w v c for sufficiently small this implies eri i infv vi v c 2 ci c i c 2 infv vi v c 2 2 ci c 2 inf d i 2 4 2 c i since can be made arbitrarily small by choose sufficiently small the last inequality implies eri i 1 4 q c i let g be the mobius transformation so that g ig 1 of fixed points 0 we have g ri ai is annulus centered at origin of radii r 2 r 1 since g eri i eai g i 1 2 log r 2 r 1 19 also note that the translation length of g ig is log r 2 r 1 i e t c i log r 2 r 1 hence by conformal invariance of eri i we have t c i 2 q c i 6 pants decomposition and bound of q c next we show the existence of homological basis which gives some lower bounds for the rational norm q c lemma 6 1 there exists c bh 1 such that q c 2 g g log g for some g 2 when g 2 and g 3 if g 2 proof we will choose c which is of relatively short length to it s i by compare arcs on pair of pants the case g 1 is trivial assume g 2 for c c denote by c 1 2 with i the non separating curves and it s dual curves intersection i j ij by i since g 2 take 1 2 1 2 then i i 1 or inverse is 1 for 1 i 2 so we can always choose c so that i i 1 for 1 i 2 hence we have q c i 2 in addition we have some g 2 for g 2 we need to decompose rg into 2 g 2 pair of pants and estimate on pant components given c bh 1 we complete c with separating curves and let p p k 1 k 2 g 2 denote the associated pants decomposition for each p k p we cut into two hexagonal pieces and we mark it by border geodesic arcs by bk gk bk ck c k ek fk g k the arcs are ak right geodesic arc bktop connector geodesic arc ck top left geodesic arc dk top right left geodesic arc ek middle connector geodesic arc fk bottom geodesic arc gk left geodesic arc conversely given any 2 g 2 pair of pants decomposition of rg there exists homological basis i i 1 i g which are not separating curves to compare homological length we use idea of elementary arcs in 7 a elementary arc e is a arc on p k with end points lie on the boundary of p k such that it intersect border geodesic arcs bk at most two points in the interior of p k by definition all border geodesic arcs in bk are elementary arcs 20 the homological curve that we will be looking for must have minimal although not necessarily zero dehn twist since by triangle inequality one can always shorten a curve by reduce its twist we want to able to show that there exists c such that i the cut curves can be made successively relatively short compare to its dual i curves the idea is that if there are no such c exists on rg then we will have an contradiction with the hyperbolicity of rg this contradiction is reached through length computations of arcs on p k to do so we will compute relative e e for different pair of e e and show that it under conditions have sufficient bounds on them these bounds will allow us to construct curves i which must satisfies lemma 6 1 of course to bound q one must keep in mind that our curve have minimal dehn twist otherwise this relative length can be made arbitrarily large or small but won t provide any meaningful bounds of q denote ak gk g k dk ck c k for 1 k 2 g 2 we make the convention that given ak and dk we set a k d k to be the other arc in the pair collection assume that the lemma is false there are several cases that we need to consider we first show that there must exists a p of rg such that there exists p k p with dk bk log 4 5 2 g lemma 6 2 assume lemma 6 1 is not true for every p there must exists some p k p such that dk bk log 4 5 2 g proof we prove by contradiction so we assume all p pants decompositions of rg have a pk such that dk bk log 4 5 2 g let 1 consider the following two cases a ak bk log 2 g for all k b there exists some k such that ak bk log 2 g case a cut pk into hexagon and it follows from hyperbolic hexagonal 10 formulas we have sinh ek sinh bk 2 cosh ak this gives ek ak sinh 1 3 bk which implies ak ek ak ak sinh 1 1 bk 21 since ak bk log 2 g and g 3 we have from the above inequality ak ek ak ak sinh 1 1 bk f note f is increasing function of and f 1 let ek be such that ek min 1 k 2 g 2 ek if k g 1 then we set 1 d 1 d 1 here dk is the cut image curve of dk so dk dk on the other hand if k g 1 then we set 1 d 2 g 2 d 2 g 2 in either case we set i 2 ei 1 2 ei for i 2 it follows from our choice of i we have the curve homotopic to i must have arcs homotopic to ai arcs now if k g 1 then set 1 2 g 2 i k ai ai and if k g 1 then we set 1 1 i k ai ai and for i 2 we also set i 2 g 2 i ai ai then it follows that we must have 1 1 1 1 1 i g 1 f f g 1 hence we have 1 i 2 g 2 2 i 2 i f g 1 2 for g 3 since lim f 1 is increasing function so there exists o such that for o we have for g 3 f 2 2 3 2 log 6 now by the fact that f g 1 2 2 g log 2 g is increasing function of g hence we have q c 2 g log 2 g for c consists of the chosen curves which is a contradiction next we consider case b log 2 g akm bkm dkm log 4 5 2 g for some km now if akm log 2 g for all the km then akm dkm akm log 4 5 2 g 1 let k m such that dk m minkm dkm here we choose as following 22 let km denote number of elements of the collection if km g 1 then we choose 1 dk m dk m 1 j 2 g 2 aj aj and j 2 ej 2 ej 1 for j 6 k from our choice of i the curve 1 must have arcs homotopic to aj curves hence 1 1 and we have 1 1 1 1 1 j 2 g 2 1 2 g 2 hence for this basis we have 1 i g q c i 2 g 2 2 since 2 g 2 2 g log 2 g 1 g 3 we have contradiction on the other hand if km g 1 then we choose in combination with case a let dk be elements of dkm such that among all curves i defined in a consist of ak ak which do not intersect dk gives k k maximal value let dk be the minimal length curve of dk then we have 1 i g 2 i 2 i 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k f g km 2 1 2 km 2 1 2 hence by previous estimates we have q c satisfies the inequality which gives contradiction now suppose that akm log 2 g for some of the m we consider this as the case c here we breakdown the case c into two subcases c 1 ak bk 1 for all k c 2 ak bk 1 some kn 23 consider c 1 in this case we have by our global condition bk dk log 4 5 2 g implies ak dk 1 log 4 5 2 g we set 1 2 g 2 jaj aj 1 dk dk where dk mink dk and we set i 2 ei 1 2 ei for i 2 choose i 2 so that i i 1 i g form a basis similarly as before we have 1 1 1 1 2 g 2 log 4 5 2 g since 2 g 2 2 2 g log 14 5 2 g 1 for g 2 and it is increasing function of g it follows that we have q c satisfies the inequality which give us a contradiction consider c 2 in this case we have akn bkn by the hyperbolic identity sinh ek sinh bk 2 cosh ak we have akn ekn akn sinh 1 cosh akn sinh akn 2 here we further subdivide into cases as c 2 akn 3 2 g c 2 akn 3 2 g for c 2 we have from the above inequality after some simple computations we have akn ekn 3 2 g 11 10 note that this inequality holds for akn 3 2 g and g 3 set 1 dk dk 1 1 j 2 g 2 aj and i e 2 i 1 e 2 i i i j 2 g 2 aj aj and i 1 j i 1 aj aj for i 6 k then by similar computations as above then show that this basis c satisfies 1 i g 2 i 2 i 4 g n 1 2 log 2 2 g 22 10 n 2 2 g 11 30 24 this inequality follows from that the maximal number of akn arcs that don t pass through d k is n 2 here n is the number of kn this implies that if n g 2 then we can always choose curves i as above so that 1 i g 2 i 2 i 22 10 g 49 30 271 30 by setting 6 10 we have 22 10 g 49 30 271 30 2 g log 2 g 1 for g 3 it follows that q c gives our contradiction case c 2 here we have akn 3 2 g note by the global condition dk bk log 4 5 2 g we also have bkn log 2 g akn we have by hexagonal hyperbolic formula cosh akn sinh akn sinh bkn cosh dkn cosh akn cosh bkn gives dkn cosh 1 cosh akn 1 cosh bkn sinh akn sinh bkn by our conditions this implies dkn cosh 1 cosh akn 1 cosh log 2 g akn sinh akn sinh log 2 g akn cosh 1 cosh 6 10 3 2 g 1 cosh log 2 g akn sinh 6 10 3 2 g sinh log 2 g akn 17 10 log 2 g by dk bk log 4 5 2 g implies that bkn 17 10 log 1 5 2 g we have bkn ekn 2 17 10 log 1 5 2 g sinh 1 cosh 6 10 3 2 g sinh 17 10 log 1 5 2 g with some computations one shows that bkn ekn 3 log 2 g 25 here we set 1 1 j 2 g 2 aj and i 2 e 2 i 1 2 e 2 i for all the i that within the collection of pkn we select the remaining curves j which are not consist of ej by construction it follows that i the geodesic curve must have arcs homotopic to ai and i i g i i 9 n 4 log 2 2 g now if n g 2 then we have q c 2 g log 2 g on the other hand if n g 2 we can then choose curves given by previous construction hence we always curves that gives our contradiction this completes our prove of the result now we establish the induction process of showing corollary 6 3 assume lemma 6 1 is false let 1 i g suppose there exists p kj for every j i such that dkj bkj log 4 5 2 g 2 j 2 then there must exists p ki p j ip kj such that dki bki log 4 5 2 g 2 i 2 proof the pants p ki p j ip kj consists of decomposition of surface of genus g i 1 it follows from lemma 6 2 there exists dki bki such that dki bki log 4 5 2 g i 1 now we can finish the proof of lemma 6 1 if the lemma is false then we choose the collection of geodesic curves on surface rg represented by i bi bi for 1 i g since the shortest geodesic i intersecting i is given by either ci c i or c i c i i e i di di hence it follows from corollary 6 3 we have that i i log 4 5 2 g 2 i 2 for 1 i g after simple computation one shows that g i 1 log 8 5 2 g 2 i 2 2 g log 2 g hence q c 4 g log g a contradiction proposition 6 4 there exists a c bh 1 such that q c 2 g g log g for all stab remark 6 5 note that under the action of we could have i permuted hence only the summation of the above inequality is preserved we call any such c satisfies the inequality positive call c invariantly positive if having property of lemma 6 4 26 proof we need to examine action on elementary curves on pants decom position note that it is enough to show it is true for generators of stab we can written elements of sp 2 g z as composition of several types of el ementary symplectic matrices for elements of stab which is subgroup generated by elementary matrices which do not intertwines the i and j basis these elementary matrix correspond to a nielsen transformation on the generators of c the idea is that take c positive which exists by lemma 6 1 by similar computations as in the proof of lemma 6 1 using elementary arcs if c is not positive then we can appropriately modify the original curve of c to a new c so that this c will only increase q under this is achieved by compare different elementary arc length as we have done previously let eij denote a elementary matrix such that eij map c into basis with i replaced by i j and j replaced by j i and rest unchanged example e 12 for g 3 of sp 6 z e 12 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 we need to consider cases on pair pants assume the statement is false and there exists l m such that j q elm c j 2 g log 2 g for all positive c it follows from the proof of lemma 6 1 it is suffice to consider l m are curves consist of elementary arcs let hlm denote the geodesic curve representation of homological class l m let flm be a class of curves which is canonical dual to hlm and non intersecting to rest of basis we denote the flm to be the geodesic representative of flm take a c provided by lemma 6 1 we will show that either this c is invariantly positive or it implies another c is invariantly positive to do so we will examine all possible cases of c we continue to use our notations and definitions given in the proof of lemma 6 1 we need to examine all possible curves given by the elm c as in the lemma 6 1 first assume that we have dk bk log 4 5 2 g for all p k note that we have some positive c since h is geodesic closed curve homotopically connects bl bm the length is bounded above by sum of these 27 curves and twice the connecting geodesic curve as in the proof of lemma 6 1 if ak bk log 2 g for all k then el em dl dm so if we set hlm bl bm then flm el em hence we have flm hlm g log 2 g and we have elm c positive on the other hand if ak bk log 2 g for some p k contains bl bm then we have a curve which consists of ak as elementary arcs and dj g log 2 g j l m we replace one of the original l with to form basis c it is obvious that c is positive for simplicity we use same notation for the geodesic representation curves for c then h have l a dehn twist around bm which trace off from ak arcs the geodesic flm consists of arcs homotopic to arcs of m l bl hence flm 1 2 m l bl this implies we have lower bound of flm bl m bl 1 hence we have elm c positive by repeat this replacement for rest of curves of c if necessary we can claim that elm c 1 l m g satisfies same inequality note that elm el m c will increase dehn twist which will increase the lower bound by twist number i e denote fl 1 m 1 ljmj be the geodesic representative of f corresponds to elim 1 eljmj c we have fl 1 m 1 ljmj bl m bl j hence we have c is invariantly positive now it follows from corollary 6 3 and lemma 6 2 that every pants de compositions have cut curves i such that i have the property of i i log 4 5 2 g 1 i g this implies that there exists a invariantly positive c from lemma 6 1 and lemma 6 4 we can prove the following inequality of the schottky length proposition 6 6 there exists c bh 1 such that t c g log g 28 proof let c be given by lemma 6 1 by lemma 5 5 we have t c i 2 q c i since iq c i 2 g g log g this implies that g i 1 t c i gg log g since t c 1 g g i 1 t c i hence the above strict inequality implies the result 7 proof of theorem 1 1 let c b h 1 for c c c is an generators set of c since c c c c and c c c w we have our next corollary proposition 7 1 let c be given by proposition 6 6 then w x g log g proof it follows from proposition 6 6 and wx c t c we have wx c g log g since c c c w by the invariant positivity result of lemma 6 4 we have wx c g log g c c hence we have w x inf c w wx c g log g proof theorem 1 1 for a rg it follows from proposition 7 1 there exists homological marking c bh 1 of rg such that c c the covering schottky group satisfies w x g log g for all h 3 hence by corollary 4 5 and corollary 4 6 and note that for such c we have 2 which implies d c 1 finally we give two obvious applications of our theorem the first appli cation corollary 7 2 address a folklore question that was originally due to bers 29 corollary 7 2 if hc 1 then for all rg mg 1 s rg have classical fiber proof assume that hc 1 so c 1 since c 1 proposition 3 2 and theorem 2 1 implies that is classical schottky group hence for rg mg 1 s rg jg o 6 therefore s jg o is surjective the second application is presentation of period matrix of rg in schottky coordinates it s well known theorem of torelli that there exists a injective map from mg into siegel s space of symmetric g g matrix over c this is given by the pmn period matrix of rg many beautiful theorems has been proved on pmn such as buser sarnak s theorem 6 states that the locus of jacobians lie in very small neighborhood of the boundary of space of principally polarized abelian varieties for large genus rg it s well known fact 4 that pmn can be represented in local coordinates of jg recall that local coordinates of jg which is 3 g 3 dimensional complex manifold are given by variables i z i z i 1 i g 1 multiplier and two fixed points respectively recall given z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 c the cross ratio is z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 z 1 z 3 z 2 z 4 z 1 z 4 z 2 z 3 let jg be generated by 1 g we denote by l the subgroup of generated by l then the following formal presentation of pmn is well known and go back to schottky himself 4 21 pmn n m log z n z m z n z m mn log n however even though pmn has been formally known for a very long time but in general as pmn is infinite sum so it is not always convergent for a arbitrary jg and it is not known in general in this respect we have our second simple application of theorem 1 1 corollary 7 3 let rg mg there exists jg such that the period matrix of pmn of rg is given by the above presentation proof the only thing needs to be verified is that pmn is convergent for some 1 s rg by theorem 2 1 we have a 1 s rg such that d 1 note that pmn is obtained as integral around canonical basis cycles of h 1 rg z of invariant holomorphic cocycles on n z n d log z z n z z n 30 it follows from the residue formula we have pmn by change of variable we have n is convergent if the poincare series n z is convergent since d 1 we have n z is convergent hence pmn exists for e mail
