taching the boundary of a disk to a circle j via a map f j with the property that there is a point v j such that f 1 v is a finite set containing at least 3 points and f maps each component of f 1 v homeomorphically onto j v theorem no generalized dunce hat is the union of two proper subpolyhedra that each have finite first homology groups this result undermines a strategy for proving that the interior of the mazur compact contractible 4 manifold m is splittable in the sense of gabai i e int m u v where u v and u v are each homeomorphic to euclidean 4 space 1 introduction an open non compact boundaryless n manifold is splittable in the sense of gabai or more briefly splittable if it is the union of two open subsets u and v such that u v and u v are homeomorphic to euclidean n space it is easily seen that euclidean n space is splittable what is not obvious is whether there exist any other splittable contractible open manifolds and whether there exist any non splittable contractible open manifolds in 2009 david gabai surprised the geometric topology community by showing that the whitehead 3 manifold is splittable g the whitehead 3 manifold is one of the fundamental examples in 3 manifold topology it is a contractible open 3 manifold that is not homeomorphic to euclidean 3 space it was discovered by j h c white head in 1935 as a fatal obstruction to his own proposed proof of the 3 dimensional poincare conjecture w gabai s observation inspired alternative proofs and gen eralizations by other topologists in grw it is proved that there exist uncount ably many topologically distinct splittable contractible open 3 manifolds and that there exist uncountably many topologically distinct non splittable contractible open 3 manifolds pete sparks in his 2014 ph d thesis s extended the study of the spit tability phenomenon to dimension 4 by constructing an uncountable family of topo logically distinct splittable contractible open 4 manifolds the question of whether there exists a non splittable contractible open 4 manifold remains unresolved the mazur 4 manifold m is a compact contractible 4 manifold with boundary whose interior is not homeomorphic to euclidean 4 space it is a fundamental object in the study of 4 dimensional manifolds it is not known whether the interior of the date 1991 mathematics subject classification primary 57 n 13 secondary 57 n 15 key words and phrases 1 http arxiv org abs 1803 00644 v 1 2 fredric ancel and pete sparks mazur 4 manifold is splittable one strategy for attacking this question relies on the fact that the mazur 4 manifold has a spine that is a dunce hat in general a subpolyhedron p of a compact piecewise linear manifold m is called a spine of m if m collapses to p the dunce hat is a 2 dimensional polyhedron that is contractible but not collapsible and according to z the mazur 4 manifold has a spine which is a dunce hat in general if a compact piecewise linear manifold has a spine that can be expressed as the union of two collapsible proper subpolyhedra that intersect in a collapsible subpolyhedron then these subpolyhedra can be thickened to give a splitting of the interior of the manifold see proposition 3 1 9 of s thus a potential strategy for proving the splittability of the interior of the mazur 4 manifold would be to exhibit the dunce hat as the union of two collapsible subpolyhedron that intersect in a collapsible subpolyhedron the theorem proved in this paper implies that this strategy can t work because the dunce hat can t be divided into two collapsible subpolyhedra so the interior of the mazur 4 manifold remains a potential candidate for a non splittable contractible open 4 manifold one might hope to prove that because the mazur 4 manifold has a spine that can t be split into two collapsible subpolyhdra then its interior is not splittable however there are obstacles to giving such a proof because the relationship between compact contractible manifolds and their spines is complex two non homeomorphic compact contractible 4 manifolds can have homeomorphic spines and a single compact con tractible 4 manifold can have two non homeomorphic spines one of which can be divided into collapsible subpolyhedra while the other can t thus for compact con tractible manifolds a spine which can t be divided into collapsible subpolyhedra does not compel a non splittable interior specifically a 4 ball whose interior is splittable has an disc spine which can obviously be divided into two collapsible subpolyhedra that intersect in a collapsible subpolyhedron and it has a dunce hat spine which ac cording to the theorem of this paper can t be divided in this fashion note that the preceding observation has the obvious consequence that the 4 ball and the mazur 4 manifold which are not homeomorphic have spines which are homeomorphic namely dunce hats we remark that in dimensions n 5 there exist splittable contractible open n manifolds besides euclidean n space the interior of every compact contractible n manifold is splittable and every davis n manifold is splittable ags however for n 5 no example of a non splittable contractible open n manifolds is known the theorem of this paper generalizes results of gst where it is shown that a specific triangulation of the original dunce hat can t be expressed as the union of two collapsible subcomplexes the original dunce hat arises when the map f j is homotopic to a homeomorphism and the set f 1 v contains exactly 3 points during the preparation of this manuscript the article bo was posted the results of bo significantly overlap the theorem of this paper but neither includes the other the techniques of bo are quite different from techniques used here furthermore the movitation for the work in bo lusternik schnirelmann category issues and the andrews curtis conjecture appears at first glance to be quite separate from the generalized dunce hats are not splittable 3 motivation for this paper the splittability of the contractible open 4 manifolds but the connection between these questions is provocative the authors thank professor craig guilbault for helpful discussions and an idea that played a key role in the proof of lemma 2 2 the theorem and constraints on its generalization definition 2 1 let be a 2 dimensional disk let j be a simple closed curve and let f j be a map suppose there is a point v j and an integer p 3 such that f 1 v is a finite set with exactly p elements and f maps each of the p components of f 1 v homeomorphically onto j v hence for each y j the set f 1 y has exactly p elements the adjunction space d f j is called a generalized dunce hat identify j with its image under the quotient map j d so that the quotient map restricted to j is the identity here and subsequently denotes disjoint union let q d denote the restriction of the quotient map j d to observe that triangulations of and j can be chosen so that is a full subcomplex of and f j is simplicial then these triangulations determine a triangulation of d so that j is a full subcomplex of d and the quotient map j d is simplicial call v the singular vertex of d and call j the singular locus of d theorem 2 2 no generalized dunce hat is the union of two proper subpolyhedra that each have finite first homology groups before proving this theorem we present a variety of evidence showing that the theorem is in some sense a best possible result we show that if the hypotheses of the theorem are weakened in two different ways then a false statement results also we show that the conclusion of the theorem can t be strengthened to rule out expressing a generalized dunce hat as the union of three proper subpolyhedra with trivial first homology first if the definition of generalized dunce hat is broadened to allow attaching maps f j for which the set f 1 v has one or two elements then it becomes possible in some cases to express the quotient space f j as the union of two proper collapsible subpolyhedra for instance if f 1 v has one element then f j is a homeomorphism and f j is a disk which can be expressed as the union of two proper subdisks if f 1 v has two elements then there are two possibilities either f j is null homotopic or it is a degree two covering map in the case that f j is null homotopic f j is the quotient space obtained from the 2 sphere by identifying a pair of points in this situation f j can also be expressed as the union of two subdisks in the case that f j is a degree two covering map then f j is a projective plane the theorem holds for the projective plane indeed a mayer vietoris sequence argument shows that the projective plane can t be expressed as the union of two proper subpolyhedra with finite first homology groups 4 fredric ancel and pete sparks second we consider the possibility of broadening the definition of generalized dunce hat by considering quotient spaces constructed by attaching a disk to a circle and al lowing more than one singular vertex the following example shows that the theorem becomes false if we allow two singular vertices example 1 there is a quotient space h g j called the jester s hat that is similar to the dunce hat but which has two singular vertices instead of one and which is the union of two proper collapsible subpolyhedra the jester s hat originates in pete sparks 2014 ph d thesis s in more detail let w 0 w 1 w 5 be six distinct points of listed in cyclic order and for 1 i 6 let ei denote the closure of the component of w 0 w 1 w 5 with endpoints wi 1 and wi where w 6 w 0 let v 0 and v 1 be two distinct points of j and let j 1 and j 2 be the closures of the two components of j v 0 v 1 let g j be a map such that g 1 v 0 w 0 w 2 w 4 g 1 v 1 w 1 w 3 w 5 g maps each of e 1 e 2 and e 3 homeomorphically onto j 1 and g maps each of e 4 e 5 and e 6 homeomorphically onto j 2 this description of g fixes g up to isotopies that preserve g w 0 w 1 w 5 then the quotient space h g j is called the jester s hat let r h denote the restriction of the quotient map j h to let l be an arc in such that l w 0 w 3 and int l int then is the union of two disks 1 and 2 where 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 l 2 e 4 e 5 e 6 l and 1 2 l hence h r 1 r 2 furthermore r 1 and r 2 are easily seen to be collapsible the map r transports a collapse of 1 onto e 1 e 2 e 3 to a collapse of r 1 onto j 1 and j 1 collapses to a point similarly r 2 collapses to j 2 which collapses to a point third the following proposition shows that the conclusion of the theorem can t be strengthened to rule out expressing a generalized dunce hat as the union of three proper subpolyhedra with trivial first homology proposition 2 3 every generalized dunce hat is the union of three proper collapsible subpolyhedra proof let d be a generalized dunce hat let j 1 and j 2 be arcs in j such that int j 1 int j 2 j and triangulate d so that j 1 and j 2 are subcomplexes for i 1 2 let ai be a simplicial neighborhood of ji in a second derived subdivision of this triangulation then ai collapses to ji which in turn collapses to a point the set d int a 1 int a 2 is a compact subset of the open disk q int hence this set is contained in the interior of a piecewise linear disk a 3 that lies in q int a 1 a 2 and a 3 are collapsible subpolyhedra of d that cover d finally the following example shows that the theorem can t be strengthened to conclude that a generalized dunce hatd can t be expressed as the union of two proper subpolyhedra a and b with the properties that the inclusion a d induces the zero homomorphism on first homology and b is collapsible example 2 there is a generalized dunce hat d f j and proper subpolyhedra a and b of d such that a b d the inclusion induced homomorphism h 1 a h 1 d is zero and b is collapsible assign an orientation to and let w 0 w 1 w 2 w 3 generalized dunce hats are not splittable 5 be four distinct points of listed in orientation preserving cyclic order and for 1 i 4 let ei denote the closure of the component of w 0 w 1 w 2 w 3 with endpoints wi 1 and wi where w 4 w 0 assign an orientation to j v let f j be a map such that f 1 v w 0 w 1 w 2 w 3 f int e 1 int e 1 j v and f int e 3 int e 3 j v are orientation preserving homeomorphisms while f int e 2 int e 2 j v and f int e 4 int e 4 j v are orientation reversing homeomorphisms let l be an arc in such that l w 0 w 2 and int l int let b 1 and b 3 be disjoint disks in l so that k 1 b 1 and k 3 b 3 are arcs in satisfying w 1 int k 1 w 3 int k 3 k 1 e 3 e 4 k 3 e 1 e 2 and f k 1 e 1 f k 1 e 2 f k 3 e 3 f k 3 e 4 let n cl b 1 b 3 then n is a regular neighborhood of l in such that n is the union of two disjoint arcs k 0 and k 2 such that w 0 int k 0 w 2 int k 2 k 0 e 2 e 3 k 2 e 1 e 4 and f k 0 e 1 f k 0 e 4 f k 2 e 2 f k 2 e 3 let a q n and b q b 1 b 3 then a and b are proper subpolyhedra of d a b b is homeomorphic to a cone over a figure eight and hence is collapsible there is a strong deformation retraction of a onto q l this deformation is constructed by beginning with a strong deformation retraction of the arc f k 0 e 1 to its endpoint v lifting this deformation to a strong deformation retraction of n onto l via conjugation by q 1 then extending the lifted deformation to a strong deformation retraction of n onto l and finally pushing down the last deformation to a strong deformation retraction of a onto q l via conjugation by q let i a d and j q l d denote inclusions since there is a strong deformation retraction of a onto q l then there is a retraction r a q l such that i is homotopic to j r in d we want to prove i h 1 a h 1 d is zero so it suffices to prove that j h 1 q l h 1 d is zero let e e 1 e 2 clearly q e f e e e d v is null homotopic rel e hence q e h 1 e e h 1 d v is zero let k l denote inclusion then q k j q l clearly k l is homotopic in rel l to a map l such that l e thus q k l d is homotopic in d rel l to q e l d thus q k q e h 1 l l h 1 d v since q e 0 it follows that j q l 0 next we will prove that j h 1 q l v h 1 d v is zero by showing that q l h 1 l l h 1 q l v is an isomorphism q l l l q l v factors as the composition of the quotient map l l l l l l and a homeomorphism l l l l q l v proposition 2 22 on page 124 of h implies that induces an isomorphism on first homology clearly induces an isomorphism on first homology hence q l h 1 l l h 1 q l v is an isomorphism and therefore j h 1 q l v h 1 d v is zero the homology long exact sequences of the pairs q l v and d v tell us that the inclusion induced homomorphisms h 1 q l h 1 q l v and h 1 d h 1 d v are isomorphisms consequently since the composition of j h 1 q l h 1 d and h 1 d h 1 d v equals the composition of h 1 q l h 1 q l v and j h 1 q l v h 1 d v then it follows that j h 1 q l h 1 d is zero 6 fredric ancel and pete sparks 3 auxiliary facts about maps between circles the results of this section are elementary facts about maps between circles for which we give elementary proofs our goal is proposition 5 which will be applied at a particular point in the proof of the theorem definitions 3 1 let f k j be a map between circles let x k if f restricts to an embedding on a connected open neighborhood of x then we call x a regular point of f a point of k which is not a regular point of f is called a singular point of f let r f denote the set of all regular points of f and let s f denote the set of all singular points of f then k r f s f definitions 3 2 let f k j be a map between oriented circles and let x r f then there is a connected open neighborhood n of x in k such that f n n j is an embedding f n n j must either preserve or reverse orientation if f n preserves orientation then we say that f is increasing at x if f n reverses orientation then we say that f is decreasing at x let r f x k f is increasing at x and let r f x k f is decreasing at x then r f r f r f note that reversing the orientation on j preserves the set r f and interchanges the sets r f and r f if f k j is a map between oriented circles observe that r f r f and r f are open subsets of k and therefore s f is a closed subset of k definition 3 3 let s r and let f s r be a function we say that f is strictly increasing if f y f z whenever y z s and y z we say that f is locally strictly increasing if every x s has an open neighborhood nx in r such that f nx s nx s r is strictly increasing the notions of strictly decreasing and locally strictly decreasing are defined similarly lemma 3 4 let s be a connected subset of r and let f s r be a function if f is locally strictly increasing then it is strictly increasing similarly if f is locally strictly decreasing then it is strictly decreasing proof assume f s r is locally strictly increasing let x y s such that x y then x y s and each z s has an open neighborhood nz in r such that f nz s nz s r is strictly increasing the open cover n nz z s of x y has a lebesgue number choose n 0 so that x n y x n 1 then for 1 i n the two points x i 1 and x i lie in an element of n and the two points x n and y lie in an element of n thus f x f x f x 2 f x n f y we conclude that f x f y thus f is strictly increasing we leave the proof of the second assertion of lemma 3 4 to the reader proposition 3 5 suppose f k j is a map between oriented circles e is a connected open subset of k and e r f then either e r f or e r f furthermore if f e is a proper subset of j then f e e j is an embedding proof since the sets e r f and e r f are disjoint relatively open subsets of e whose union is e and e is connected then one of these sets must be empty the first conclusion of the proposition follows generalized dunce hats are not splittable 7 assume f e is a proper subset of j notice that since f is regular at each point of e then f e e j is an open map hence f e is an open subset of j if e k then f e is a closed subset of j since j is connected this would imply f e j which contradicts our hypothesis we conclude that e is a proper subset of k hence there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism 0 1 e and there is an orientation preserving embedding 0 1 j such that f e 0 1 first assume e r f then the composition 1 f 0 1 0 1 is locally strictly increasing lemma 3 4 now implies that 1 f is strictly increasing thus 1 f 0 1 0 1 0 1 is injective since 0 1 e is bijective then f e e j must be injective hence f e e j is an embedding in the case that e r f reverse the orientation on j now e r f and the preceding argument shows that f e e j is an embedding definitions 3 6 suppose f k j is a map between oriented circles x k and x is an isolated point of s f then there is a connected open neighborhood e of x in k such that e x r f and e 6 k hence there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism 1 1 e such that f 0 x then e 1 0 and e 0 1 are the two components of e x proposition 3 5 implies that either e r f or e r f and either e r f or e r f if e r f and e r f we say f has a local maximum at x and if e r f and e r f we say f has a local minimum at x the following proposition shows that the remaining two possibilities either e e r f or e e r f can t occur if x s f proposition 3 7 if f k j is a map between oriented circles x k and e is an open neighborhood of x in k such that either e x r f or e x r f then x r f proof first assume e x r f let 1 1 j be an orientation preserving embedding such that 0 f x there is an orientation preserving embedding 1 1 k such that 0 x and 1 1 e thus 1 1 0 e x since f is continuous we can assume f 1 1 1 1 let g 1 f 1 1 1 1 since e x r f then g 1 0 1 0 1 1 and g 0 1 1 0 1 1 are orientation preserv ing maps therefore g 1 0 and g 0 1 are locally strictly increasing and hence strictly increasing functions by lemma 3 4 so g 1 0 and g 0 1 are injective we assert that g 1 0 1 0 for suppose there is a t 1 0 such that g t 0 choose t t 0 then 0 g t g t 1 hence g t 0 g t 1 0 1 since g is continuous at 0 then g t approaches g 0 0 as t t 0 approaches 0 from below this implies 0 cl g t 0 g t 1 a contradiction a similar argument shows g 0 1 0 1 it follows that g 1 1 1 1 is injective since g 1 f and 1 1 k is injective then f 1 1 is injective consequently x r f in the case that e x r f reverse the orientation of j then the preceding argument shows that x r f 8 fredric ancel and pete sparks if f k j is a map between oriented circles and x k has a connected open neighborhood e in k such that e x r f then there are three possible cases e x r f e x r f or one component of e x lies in r f while the other component lies in r f proposition 3 7 implies that in either of the first two cases x r f thus if x s f then the third case must hold hence we have corollary 3 8 if f k j is a map between oriented circles x k and x is an isolated point of s f then f has either a local maximum or a local minimum at x we have reached the fact about maps between circles which is the goal of this section proposition 3 9 suppose f k j is a map between oriented circles such that every singular point of f is isolated then f has only finitely many singular points and the number of points at which f has a local maximum is equal to the number of points at which f has a local minimum proof since k is compact and s f is a closed subset of k then s f is compact since each point of s f is isolated it follows that s f is a finite set suppose s f w 1 w 2 wp indexed in orientation preserving cyclic order on k let w 0 wp and for 1 i p let ei be the component of k s f r f with endpoints wi 1 and wi let e 0 ep and ep 1 e 1 observe that for 1 i p 1 proposition 3 5 implies that either ei r f or ei r f and proposition 3 7 implies that ei 1 and ei can t both lie in either r f or in r f if follows that p must be an even integer and we can assume that e 1 e 3 ep 1 r f and e 2 e 4 ep r f consequently f must have a local maximum at each point of the set w 1 w 3 wp 1 and it must have a local minimum at each point of the set w 2 w 4 wp since these two sets have the same number of elements the proposition is proved 4 auxiliary facts about components of submanifolds here we list some facts that will be used without specific citation in the proof of the theorem notation 1 we need notations that distinguish between the two types of interiors that can be associated with a manifold that is the subset of a larger topological space if a is a subset of a topological space x let clx a intrx a and frx a denote the closure interior and frontier of a in x respectively omit the subscript x in contexts where no ambiguity can arise from this omission if m is a topological manifold then from this point on let in m and m denote the manifold interior and the manifold boundary of m respectively recall that if m q are manifolds of the same dimension then invariance of domain implies that in m in q hence in this situation m q m q generalized dunce hats are not splittable 9 definition 4 1 if m q are manifolds and dim m n we call m a nice sub manifold of q if in m in q and if m q and m in m q are n 1 manifolds suppose t is a combinatorial triangulation of an n manifold m i e the link of every vertex of t is piecewise linearly homeomorphic to either a piecewise linear n 1 sphere or a piecewise linear n 1 ball let k be a subcomplex of t then regular neighborhood theory br theorem 3 6 page 231 implies that the simplicial neighborhood of k in a second derived subdivision t of t is an n dimensional nice submanifold of m notation 2 if x is a topological space let comp x denote the set of all compo nents of x proposition 4 2 suppose m q are manifolds such that in m in q then the functions c 7 clm c comp m in q comp m and d 7 d in q comp m comp m in q are inverse bijections proof it suffices to prove that these two functions are well defined and that each is a left inverse of the other first we prove that the function c 7 clm c comp m in q comp m is well defined and that the function d 7 d in q is a left inverse of c 7 clm c let c comp m in q then there is a d comp m such that c d therefore c d in q m in q d is a relatively closed subset of m and because m is locally connected a relatively open subset of m hence d is a manifold with the same dimension as m we draw two conclusions first in d is a dense subset of d and hence clm in d d second in d in m the latter statement implies in d d in m d in q since any two points of d can be joined by an arc whose interior lies in in d then it follows that d in q is a connected set now the inclusions c d in q m in q together with the facts that c is a component of m in q and d in q is connected imply that c d in q since in d d and in d in m in q then in d c d thus d clm in d clm c clm d d hence clm c d comp m and clm c in q d in q c second we prove that the function d 7 d in q comp m comp m in q is well defined and that the function c 7 clm c is a left inverse of d 7 d in q let d comp m then as noted in the previous paragraph d is both a relatively closed and a relatively open subset of m hence d in q is both a relatively closed and a relatively open subset ofm in q it was also noted in the previous paragraph that d in q is connected it follows that d in q comp m in q the argument in the previous paragraph shows that the closure in m of an element of comp m in q is the component ofm that contains it since d is the component of m that contains d in q then we conclude clm d in q d 10 fredric ancel and pete sparks 5 proof of the theorem assume that a generalized dunce hat d is the union of two proper subpolyhedra a and b each of which has a finite first homology group to guide the reader through the upcoming argument we briefly describe the eleven steps that comprise it i make a connected by adding arcs ii prove b does not contain j and choose a point b j b iii replace a by a regular neighborhood making a j a 1 dimensional subman ifold of j a j a 2 dimensional submanifold of d j and q 1 a a nice 2 dimensional submanifold of iv prove that each component of q 1 a is a disk v let e denote the set of components of a j and let f denote the set of components of a j construct a graph s in a with a vertex we in e for each e e a vertex wf in f for each f f and an edge joining we to wf if and only if q 1 we cl q 1 f 6 s is essentially the nerve of the cover n e e e f where each n e is a small regular neighborhood of e in a vi prove that a strong deformation retracts onto s and conclude that s is a tree vii show that for each f f cl f is a disk viii a is the union of cl f f f and the intersection pattern of this collection of disks is encoded by the tree s think of a as a tree of disks ix prove lemma 5 1 which says that if a disk g in d intersects j in an arc e such that v g e g and b in e in g then the inclusion map g d b induces a monomorphism on first homology x there is an e e such that b in e the remainder of the proof breaks into two cases either there are two distinct elements f 1 and f 2 of f such that e cl f 1 and e cl f 2 or there are not the second case occurs only if v in e xi in the first case we can find two subtrees t 1 and t 2 of s such that g 1 cl f f f and wf is a vertex of t 1 andg 2 cl f f f and wf is a vertex of t 2 are disks with the property that g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 e and g 1 in e g 2 in e fr a then g g 1 g 2 is a disk containing b in its interior such that g fr a b it follows that the inclusion induced map h 1 g h 1 d b factors through a finite group the latter statement contradicts the conclusion of lemma 5 1 if we choose g to be a disk in in g satisfying the hypotheses of lemma 5 1 xii in the second case we can find a single subtree t 1 of s such that g 1 cl f f f and wf is a vertex of t 1 is a disk containing b in its interior with the property that g 1 fr a b as in the previous case it follows that the inclusion induced map h 1 g h 1 d b factors through a finite group again the latter statement contradicts the conclusion of lemma 5 1 if we choose a disk g in in g which satisfies the hypotheses of lemma 5 1 generalized dunce hats are not splittable 11 if you understand these eleven steps completely read no further for everyone else we provide a detailed proof we do not initially suppose that a is connected we can make a connected by joining distinct components with arcs one fewer arcs than the number of compo nents according to the reduced mayer vietoris sequence this process doesn t alter a s first homology so we can assume a is connected neither a nor b can contain j for suppose b contains j choose a point x d b then x d j there is a point y in such that q 1 x y any retraction of y onto induces a retraction of d x onto j this retraction restricts to a retraction r of b onto j then r i idj where i j b denotes the inclusion hence the identity map h 1 j h 1 j factors through the finite group h 1 b since h 1 j z this is impossible thus b can t contain j a can t contain j for similar reasons because b doesn t contain j then we can choose a point b j b such that b 6 v since a b d then necessarily b a let t be a triangulation of d so that subcomplexes of t triangulate v a b and b and so that there is a triangulation q 1 t of that makes q d a simplicial map from q 1 t to t let t be a second derived subdivision of t then there is a second derived subdivision q 1 t of q 1 t so that q d is simplicial from q 1 t to t we enlarge a by replacing it by its simplicial neighborhood with respect to t this process replaces q 1 a by its simplicial neighborhood with respect to q 1 t then according to the remark following the definition of nice submanifold in section 4 a j is now a 1 dimensional submanifold of j and q 1 a is now a nice 2 dimensional submanifold of thus q 1 a is a 1 dimensional submanifold of and q 1 a in is a 2 dimensional submanifold of in since q maps in homeomorphically onto d j then it follows that a j a 2 dimension submanifold of d j we devote the next three paragraphs to describing the topology of a at points of a j let e denote the set of components of a j since a j is a 1 dimensional submanifold of j then each element of e is an arc in j let e e since v is a vertex of the triangulation t of d and e arises by taking a simplicial neighborhood in a second derived subdivision t of t then either v in e or v e similarly either b in e or b e recall that associated to the map f q j is an integer p 3 such that q 1 v has exactly p elements and f maps each of the p components of q 1 v homeomorphically onto j v it follows that q 1 e is the union of p disjoint arcs e 1 ep in first focus on the case in which v e in this situation q maps each ei home omorphically onto e let n be a regular neighborhood of e in a then q 1 n is a regular neighborhood of q 1 e in q 1 a since q 1 a is a nice 2 dimensional submanifold of it follows that q 1 n is the union of p disjoint disks n 1 np with ni ei for 1 i p furthermore q embeds each ni in n such that q ni q nj e for i 6 j thus n is an open book with pages q n 1 q np and binding e 12 fredric ancel and pete sparks next consider the case in which v in e then for 1 i p there is a point vi in ei such that q 1 v ei vi the set of singular points of the map q j lies in the p element set q 1 v if we orient and j then proposition 3 9 implies that the number of points at which the q j has a local maximum equals the number of points at which it has a local minimum hence if we let e and e be closures of the two components of e v then there is an integer r 0 such that 2 r p and after permuting subscripts i q maps the closure of each component of ei vi onto e for 1 i r ii q maps the closure of each component of ei vi onto e for r 1 i 2 r and iii q maps ei homeomorphically onto e for 2 r 1 i p note that if 2 r p so that f has either a local maximum or a local minimum at each point of q 1 v then f can be perturbed by homotopy on a small neighborhood of q 1 v so that its image misses v making f j homotopic to a constant map continuing our analysis in the case that v in e again let n be a regular neighborhood of e in a then q 1 n is a regular neighborhood of q 1 e in q 1 a again since q 1 a is a nice 2 dimensional submanifold of it follows that q 1 n is the union of p disjoint disks n 1 np with ni ei for 1 i p furthermore q embeds each ni ei in n e such that q ni ei q nj ej for i 6 j thus n is an open pop up book in which the pages q n 1 q nr are cones attached along one half of the binding e the pages q nr 1 q n 2 r are cones attached along the other half of the binding e and the pages q n 2 r 1 q np are disks attached along the entire binding e next we argue that each component of q 1 a is a disk we first observe that every component of q 1 a must intersect for suppose c is a component of q 1 a that is disjoint from then c and q 1 a c are disjoint closed subsets of that are mapped by q to disjoint closed subsets of d whose union is a this contradicts our earlier supposition that a is connected now suppose c is a component of q 1 a that is not a disk then c is a disk with holes and there is a component k of c that lies in and bounds a disk f in in in f q 1 a because every component of q 1 a intersects since in f is an annulus with boundary components and k and since q 1 a is a proper subset of then there is a retraction of in f onto k that maps q 1 a to a single point z k we restrict this retraction to c to obtain a retraction of c onto k that maps c to z we conjugate this retraction by q 1 to obtain a retraction of q c onto q k that maps q c j to q z this retraction extends to a retraction r of a onto q k which sends a q c in to q z then r j idq k where j q k a denotes the inclusion hence the identity map h 1 q k h 1 q k factors through the finite group h 1 a since h 1 q k z this is impossible thus each component of q 1 a must be a disk the next step of the proof is to construct a graph s in a which is a spine of a in the sense that there is a strong deformation retraction of a onto s recall that e denotes the set of components of a j and each element of e is an arc in j generalized dunce hats are not splittable 13 let f denote the set of components of a j then each f f is a 2 dimensional submanifold of d j and cl f is a compact subpolyhedron of d such that each component of cl f j is either an element of e or a subarc of an element e of e joining one endpoint of e to the point v which lies in in e s has two types of vertices i a point we in e for each e e such that we v if v in e and ii a point wf in f for each f f in other words we e e wf f f is the set of vertices of s for each f f q 1 f is a component of q 1 a in because q maps q 1 a in homeomorphically onto a j let p f cl q 1 f then proposition 4 2 implies that p f is a component of q 1 a hence p f is a nice 2 dimensional submanifold of and in particular as we argued in a previous paragraph p f is a disk furthermore q 1 wf in p f let b f p f q 1 we e e then b f is a finite subset of p f p f let k f be a cone in p f with vertex q 1 wf and base b f such that k f p f b f then q k f is a graph in cl f let s q k f f f then s is a graph in a there is a strong deformation retraction of a onto s which is constructed in several steps begin with a strong deformation retraction of a j onto we e e lift this strong deformation retraction via conjugation by q 1 to a strong deformation retraction of q 1 a j onto q 1 we e e for each f f this strong deformation retraction restricts to a strong deformation retraction of p f onto b f which in turn extends to a strong deformation retraction of p f onto k f this strong deformation retraction pushes down via conjugation by q to a strong deformation retraction of cl f onto q k f which extends the original strong deformation retraction of cl f j onto we e e cl f the union of these strong deformation retractions is a strong deformation retraction of a onto s the end of the strong deformation retraction of a onto s is a retraction map r a s then r ids where s a denotes the inclusion hence the identity map h 1 s h 1 s factors through the finite group h 1 a thus h 1 s must be a finite group it follows that since s is a graph then h 1 s 0 and s must be a tree our next goal is to show that cl f is a disk for each f f let f f q maps the disk p f onto cl f and q maps p f homeomorphically onto cl f j it remains to analyze the behavior of q on the components of p f since s is a tree then q can t identify two distinct points of b f so if x q 1 we and x q 1 w e are distinct points of b f where e and e e then we 6 w e and hence e 6 e therefore q must map distinct components of p f into distinct components of a j said another way if e e and cl f e 6 then p f contains exactly one of the p components of q 1 e and is disjoint from all the others suppose e e and cl f e 6 there are two possible cases 14 fredric ancel and pete sparks i e cl f in this case p f contains a unique component e of q 1 e and q maps e homeomorphically onto e ii e 6 cl f this case occurs only if v in e hence there is at most one e e for which cl f e 6 and e 6 cl f in this case e e cl f is the closure of one of the two components of e v again p f contains a unique component e of q 1 e furthermore there is a unique v in e such that q v v and q maps each component of e v homeomorphically onto e v in this situation we might say that q zips up e mapping the open arc in e that lies in p f to the half open arc in e v that lies in in cl f q maps p f onto cl f and q maps p f homeomorphically onto cl f j in the event that case ii doesn t occur then q maps each component of p f homeomorphically onto a corresponding component of cl f j in this situation q maps p f homeomorphically onto cl f making cl f a disk in the event that case ii occurs for only one e e for which cl f e 6 then q maps all but one of the components of p f homeomorphically onto a corresponding component of cl f j and q zips up the remaining component of p f as described above in this situation although q p f p f cl f is not a homeomorphism nonetheless q p f does not alter the topological type of p f hence cl f is also a disk in the event that case ii occurs since a is the union of the collection of disks cl f f f and the intersection pattern of cl f f f is encoded by the tree s we call a a tree of disks recall that the point b lies in j b and b 6 v hence b a and there is an e e such that b in e to complete the proof of the theorem we need lemma 5 1 if g is a disk in d which intersects j in an arc e such that v g e g and b in e in g then the inclusion map j g d b induces a monomorphism on first homology proof let g 1 and g 2 be the closures of the two components of g e then g 1 and g 2 are disks in d such that gi j e g i for i 1 2 and g 1 g 2 e for i 1 2 let g i cl q 1 g i e then g i is a disk in which q maps homeomorphically onto g i also e i g i is an arc in which is a component of q 1 e since different components of q 1 e must lie in distinct components of q 1 v then e 1 and e 2 lie in distinct components of q 1 v form a cone t in over the p point set q 1 v with vertex at a point z in such that t q 1 v t is the union of p arcs joining z to the points of q 1 v such that the interiors of the arcs lie in in and are disjoint from each other there is a homeomorphism of which fixes and pulls g 1 and g 2 off t the inverse of this homeomorphism moves t off g 1 g 2 so we can assume t is disjoint from g 1 g 2 observe that q t is the suspension of p points with poles at q z and v since e 1 and e 2 lie in distinct components of t then so do g 1 and g 2 let l 1 l 1 l 2 and l 2 be arcs of t joining z to points of q 1 v labeled so that li l i generalized dunce hats are not splittable 15 is the frontier of the component of t that contains g i for i 1 2 note that because p 3 the sets l 1 l 1 and l 2 l 2 have at most one element in common so we can assume that l 1 l 1 l 2 and l 2 are labeled so that l 1 l 2 l 2 and l 2 l 1 l 1 there is a unique retraction of q 1 b onto q 1 v which extends to a retraction r of q 1 b onto t that maps g i in e i homeomorphically onto li l i for i 1 2 r induces a retraction r of d b onto q t via conjugation by q that maps j b to v and maps the open arc g i e homeomorphically onto the open arc q li l i v for i 1 2 let c denote the wedge of two circles c 1 and c 2 which intersect in the one point set c let s q t c be a map which maps q in li homeomorphically onto ci c for i 1 2 and which maps q t in l 1 in l 2 to c h 1 c z z and there is a generating set 1 2 for h 1 c such that the subgroup of h 1 c generated by i is the image of the inclusion induced map h 1 ci h 1 c observe that s r j g i in e is homotopic rel endpoints to a map which takes g i e homeomorphically onto ci c and takes e to c thus the induced map s r j h 1 g h 1 c maps a generator of h 1 g z onto one of 1 2 or 1 2 since these elements of h 1 c are of infinite order then s r j is a monomorphism it follows that j h 1 g h 1 d x must be a monomorphism finally we come to the heart of the argument recall b j b a b 6 v and there is an e e such that b in e the vertex we of the tree s also lies in in e we is the endpoint of p different edges of s whose other endpoints are of the form wf 1 wfp where f 1 fp are distinct elements of f such that e cl fi 6 hence s we has p components whose closures we label s 1 sp so that wfi is a vertex of si for 1 i p each si is a tree that has we as an endpoint for 1 i p let ai cl f f f and wf is a vertex of si then a a 1 ap and ai aj e for i 6 j we break the remainder of the proof into two cases i either v e or v in e and there are at least two distinct elements f of f such that e cl f ii v in e but there is at most one element f of f such that e cl f case i v e or v in e and there are at least two distinct elements f of f such that e cl f in the situation that v e e cl fi for 1 i p also since ai e aj e for i 6 j then v belongs to at most one of the sets ai e therefore since p 3 we can assume that after reindexing v a 1 a 2 consequently in case i we can assume e cl f 1 e cl f 2 and either v a 1 a 2 or v in e now for i 1 2 let ti be a maximal subtree of si that contains we and has order 2 at every other vertex of ti of the form w e where e e in other words to construct ti orient the edges of si away from we include the edge from we to wfi and all the edges emanating from wfi but only one edge emanating from a vertex we that is at the terminal end of an edge emanating from wfi continue in this fashion to 16 fredric ancel and pete sparks construct ti inductively when one encounters a new vertex at the terminal end of an edge add only one outgoing edge if the vertex is of the form we e e but add all the outgoing edges if the vertex is of the form wf f f for i 1 2 let gi cl f f f and wf is a vertex of ti then fi gi ai moreover each gi is a union of finitely many disks such that the intersection of any two of the disks is either empty or an arc lying in the boundary of each and the intersection of any three distinct disks is empty thus each gi is a compact 2 manifold the strong deformation retraction of a onto s restricts to a strong deformation retraction of ai onto si which in turn restricts to a strong deformation retraction of gi onto ti thus each gi is contractible and hence is a disk clearly e is an arc in gi observe that fr a cld f f f also observe that for i 1 2 gi cld f f f and wf is a vertex of ti in e thus gi in e fr a let g g 1 g 2 since g 1 g 2 e then g is a disk g g 1 in e g 2 in e and in e in g hence g fr a since d a b and b is a closed subset of d then fr a b therefore g b furthermore either v g if v e or v in g if v in e since b in e v in g we can choose an arc e in in e v such that b in e and for i 1 2 we can choose a disk g i cl fi such that g i cl fi e hence e g 1 g 2 and g 1 g 2 e thus g i e fi therefore g g 1 g 2 is a disk in in g such that v g and b in e in g let j g d b denote the inclusion map since g in g is an annulus in d b with boundary components g and g then j is homotopic in d b to a map k g d b such that k g g hence the induced maps j h 1 g h 1 d b and k h 1 g h 1 d b are equal since g b d b then k factors through the finite group h 1 b since h 1 g z it follows that k and hence j are not monomorphisms contradicting lemma 5 1 this concludes the proof of the theorem in case i case ii v in e but there is at most one element f of f such that e cl f let e 1 and e 2 denote the closures of the two components of e v since b in e v then we can assume b in e 1 there are p distinct elements f of f such that e cl f 6 where p 3 hence in this case there is an f f such that e cl f 6 but e 6 cl f in this situation e cl f equals either e 1 or e 2 if we orient and j then one of the two outcomes e cl f e 1 and e cl f e 2 represents a local maximum of the map q j at a point of p f q 1 e while the other represents a local minimum according to proposition 3 9 the number of points at which q has local maxima equals the number of points at which it has local minima consequently since at least one of the two outcomes e cl f e 1 and e cl f e 2 occurs then both must occur therefore we can choose f 1 f such that e cl f 1 e 1 recall that p f 1 cl q 1 f 1 is a disk which q maps onto the disk cl f 1 let e p f 1 q 1 e then e is a component of q 1 e and of p f 1 which q maps onto e 1 moreover there is a unique point v in e such that q v v and q maps each component of e v homeomorphically onto e 1 v further generalized dunce hats are not splittable 17 recall that q maps p f 1 e homeomorphically onto cl f 1 e 1 and q zips up e so that q in e in e 1 v is a subset of in cl f 1 in f 1 in this situation we chose we v let s 1 be the closure of the component of s we that contains wf 1 let a 1 cl f f f and wf is a vertex of s 1 then s 1 is a tree and we is an endpoint of s 1 let t 1 be a maximal subtree of s 1 that contains we and has order 2 at every other vertex of t 1 of the form we where e e let g 1 cl f f f and wf is a vertex of t 1 since g 1 is a finite union of disks that meet in boundary arcs of each and have empty triple intersections then g 1 is a compact 2 manifold the strong deformation retraction of a onto s restricts to a strong deformation retraction of a 1 onto s 1 which in turn restricts to a strong deformation retraction of g 1 onto t 1 thus g 1 is contractible and hence is a disk we is an endpoint of the tree t 1 and the unique edge of t 1 containing we has its other endpoint at wf 1 hence cl f 1 is the only element of cl f f f and wf is a vertex of t 1 that intersects e since cl f 1 e e 1 then g 1 e e 1 thus in e 1 v in f 1 in g 1 hence b in e 1 in g 1 in this case g 1 cld f f f and wf is a vertex of t 1 hence as in the previous case g 1 fr a b choose an arc e in in e 1 such that b in e then v e for i 1 2 choose disks g i in f 1 such that g i e 1 e g i and g 1 g 2 e let g g 1 g 2 then g is a disk in in f 1 and hence in in g 1 such that v g and b in g let j g d b denote the inclusion map since g 1 in g is an annulus in d b with boundary components g and g 1 then j is homotopic in d b to a map k g d b such that k g g 1 hence the induced maps j h 1 g h 1 d b and k h 1 g h 1 d b are equal since g 1 b d b then k factors through the finite group h 1 b since h 1 g z it follows that k and hence j are not monomorphisms contradicting lemma 5 1 this concludes the proof of the theorem in
