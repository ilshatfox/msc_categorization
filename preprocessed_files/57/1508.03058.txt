name abstract the giroux correspondence and the notion of a near force free magnetic field are used to topologically characterize near force free magnetic fields which describe a variety of physical processes including plasma equi librium as a byproduct the topological characterization of force free mag netic fields associated with current carrying links as conjectured by crager and kotiuga is shown to be necessary and conditions for sufficiency are given along the way a paradox is exposed the seemingly unintuitive mathemati cal tools often associated to higher dimensional topology have their origins in three dimensional contexts but in the hands of late onset visually impaired topologists this paradox was previously exposed in the context of algorithms for the visualization of three dimensional magnetic fields for this reason the paper concludes by developing connections between mathematics and cognitive science in this specific context 1 introduction the primary mathematical result of this paper is theorem 2 16 it exploits the giroux correspondence to relate two characterizations of near force free magnetic fields in the absence of reconnection points how the author came to this result over the course of decades is independent of the presentation given here over the last three decades the finite element analysis of quasistatic electromagnetic fields has moved from scalar problems in two dimensions to vector problems in three since two dimensional plots are understood cognitively in a manner quite different from our three dimensional experience there were false starts pitfalls have been avoided with great success by letting n dimensional tools dominate algorithm development but the results can threaten our intuitive notions of visualization a term we dare not define with any precision historically it is surprising that the n dimensional mathematical results used in this paper came into being by a very curious route they originated in three dimensions but in the hand of late onset blind topologists the results were then extended to higher dimensions where we are all equally blind these surprising connections are explored in the second half of the paper and a hypothesis about this is made in the hope that it will help us reexamine the relationship between mathematics and our expectation of visualization the paper is arranged as follows 2010

textbooks interdisciplinary connections are emphasized here a unique approach is attempted in the hope of connecting with the intended audience first there are no pictures in this paper 1 second calculation and algorithms have taken a back seat in order to focus on three dimensional topological issues 2 to make topological aspects which do not depend on the choice of riemannian metric unambiguous there is an interplay between the traditional vector analysis notation of electromagnetic theory and mathematical results stated in terms of the formalism of differential forms and manifold theory vector notation obscures distinctions between 1 forms and 2 forms in three dimensions but reverting to the integral form of maxwell s equations in 3 1 dimensions resolves any ambiguity 2 the lorentz force law and twisted magnetic fields the lorentz force f j b 1 relates the magnetic force density f the current density j and the magnetic flux density b definition 2 1 consider the linear combination aj bb a force free magnetic field is a magnetic field whose lorentz force vanishes that is the above linear combination of j and b vanishes identically for some scalar function coefficients a and b a linear force free magnetic field is a magnetic field where the above linear combination of j and b vanishes identically with coefficients a and b constant remark 1 let and h defined implicitly below be the permeability and the magnetic field intensity respectively nontrivial linear force free magnetic fields are 1 unlike lagrange s magnum opus this is not because all problems have been reduced to cal culation rather the reader is encouraged to visualize the material in the manner he or she feels most comfortable the sighted can find pictures on the web and then question the extent to which such pictures help grasp the generality of the results 2 this is ironic since the subject is rooted in the use of algebraic topology in computational electromagnetics hopefully this will be appreciated as one progresses through the paper near force free magnetic fields blind 3 a popular notion in the magnetohydrodynamics literature they can result from any eigenfield of the curl operator and the quasistatic version ampere s law curlh j j b curlh h h h 0 2 we will see that the linear force free magnetic field problem has a nice variational formulation via the the eigenvalue problem for a self adjoint curl operator the bridge from force free magnetic fields or the more restrictive notion of linear force free fields to the global topological aspects is provided by what the author calls trigonometry with a twist specifically recall the most basic of trig identities 1 sin 2 cos 2 3 in the context of magnetic fields interpret this as j 2 b 2 j b 2 j b 2 4 the twist in this equation will be seen to follow from the violation of the frobe nius integrability condition remark 2 under mild hypotheses about differentiability it is a simple exercise in partial differentiation to verify the following statement if f ggradf for some functions f and g then f curlf 0 however the converse statement if f curlf 0 in r then f ggradf for some f and g is not true in general fur thermore because the constraint is quadratic there are no general global conditions on the topology of the domain r which ensure that the converse holds the general conditions depend on the topology of the field lines of f in fact one can show that for any convex region one can find an f such that f curlf 0 but f cannot be represented as ggradf 3 it turns out that if f is nonzero in a neighborhood of some point then there is a smaller neighborhood in which the converse is true this is formalized by the frobenius integrability theorem lemma 2 2 in terms of differential forms the frobenius integrability condi tion is d 0 where can be a k form on an n dimensional manifold and d is the exterior derivative hence the condition is independent of any metric notion the frobenius integrability theorem states that when the frobenius integrabil ity condition is satisfied in a an open set u containing a point p then there is a subset v of u containing p such that d for some closed 1 form for k 1 the closed form is locally exact so a coordinate calculation involving logarithmic derivatives and a translation into classical vector notation yields corollary 1 for 1 forms in 3 d euclidean space and adopting classical vector notation the frobenius integrability condition is f curlf 0 the frobenius inte grability theorem implies that when the frobenius integrability condition is satisfied in a an open set u containing a point p and f is nonvanishing on u then there is a subset v of u containing p such that f ggradf for some functions f and g remark 3 from this corollary we see that if the frobenius condition is satisfied locally by a nonvanishing vector field f then f can still be expressed in terms of a scalar potential f and one still has the notion of equipotentials but the equipo tentials are rescaled by an integrating factor g the hypothesis that f is locally 3 this is in contrast to the special case of defining a magnetic scalar potential where the con straint becomes linear and additional hypotheses about co homology groups provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the converse to be true 4 p r kotiuga nonvanishing ensures that these rescaled equipotentials are nonsingular as such these rescaled equipotentials are called the leaves of a foliation that is a foliation is the result of considering a region of space to be a stack of leaves given by the rescaled equipotentials of f in our case the level sets of the function f are locally the leaves of the foliation note that on sufficiently small neighborhoods these leaves are compact but they may not be compact globally since the functions f and g are only defined on coordinate patches yet the leaves are well defined globally 4 remark 4 when f curlf 6 0 the frobenius condition is violated the notion of rescaled equipotentials are no longer applicable there can be no foliation but a topological interpretation of this situation is crucial to further developments if f curlf 6 0 in a neighborhood of a point p then it cannot switch sign in this neighborhood if one tries to define equipotentials in infinitesimal neighborhoods of points in this neighborhood then they are nonintegrable and line up like the fins of a propeller hence f curlf measures the twisting of the vector field this notion of twisting will be key to defining near force free magnetic fields and their relation to the giroux correspondence we are now positioned to see how twisting in a well defined topological sense is related to quantities familiar from maxwell s electrodynamics consider for sim plicity ohmic conductors j e an absence of magnetizable media b h and negligible displacement currents here is the conductivity and e the electric field intensity equation 4 then becomes j e b h j b 2 2 h curlh 2 5 the l h s of eq 5 involves the densities of joule heating j e and magnetic energy b h while the r h s involves the magnitude of the lorentz force density j b and a local measure of topological twisting h curlh trigonometry with a twist says that in regions where the magnetic field and heating are nonzero one must have either a nontrivial lorentz force or twisted field lines in this paper we exploit this local identity and the notion of a confoliation to globally characterize the topology of near force free magnetic fields the notion of current helicity and the eignvalue problem for linear force free fields will play a key role definition 2 3 if we identify the magnetic field intensity as a 1 form h dr the current helicity functional associated with the magnetic field on a region r is h curlh 1 2 ir 3 h curlhdv 1 2 ir 3 d 6 remark 5 the fact that the current helicity functional when expressed in terms of differential forms depends only on the exterior derivative and the wedge product but not on the hodge star leads to important invariance properties 1 this integral is diffeomorphism invariant however in the physical interpreta tion of the current helicity it is the current which has to be identified with the 2 form d this is done via a lie derivative by contracting a vector field with the volume form as a result as a function of the current density the integral is invariant under volume preserving diffeomorphisms a lie group which we denote by diff 0 r 5 what is striking is that as a lie algebra t diff 0 r 4 note that neighborhoods where f vanishes need to be excised and in the process further global considerations can arise 5 we denote the tangent space to diff 0 r by t diff 0 r this lie algebra of infinitesimal volume preserving diffeomorphisms is precisely the space of divergence zero vector fields near force free magnetic fields blind 5 has an invariant bilinear form and it is precisely the bilinear form associated with the helicity functional this bilinear form has a conceptually satisfying topological interpretation as arnold s mean asymptotic linking number 6 2 the integral is gauge invariant in the sense that if one adds an exact 1 form to an integration by parts shows that the integral changes by a boundary term which vanishes under suitable lagrangian boundary conditions since this is independent of any riemannian metric it has interesting consequences in the context of hodge decompositions we will now see how the current helicity enables to construct linear force free fields arise as eigenfields of the curl operator by means of a variational formulation relative to the hodge inner product e f r e fdv 7 an integration by parts formula shows that curl is formally self adjoint 7 d curlc curld c r d c n ds 8 if r is a compact manifold with boundary the boundary term is a symplectic form if we impose lagrangian boundary conditions the boundary term vanishes and the curl operator becomes a self adjoint fredholm operator in some sobolev like space where the gradients have been quotiented out we then have a countable number of finite energy divergence zero eigenfields satisfying an equation of the form curlh h 9 remark 6 in terms of the current helicity functional the linear force free mag netic field problem now has variational formulation that is to find the stationary points of h curlh subject to lagrangian boundary conditions and the normaliza tion h h 1 imposed via a lagrange multiplier the eigenfield corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalue having the smallest absolute value can be interpreted as either the magnetic field which has the most twisting for a given amount of energy or the magnetic field with the least energy for a given amount of twisting remark 7 what is unexpectedly elegant is that when the helicity functional is restricted to a finite domain the diffeomorphism invariant lagrangian bound ary conditions which render the curl operator self adjoint depend only on the la grangian subspaces of the first homology group of the boundary see 11 for details even more rewarding is that all these properties have a discrete counter part under whitney form finite element discretization remark 8 by restricting the curl operator to subdomains and solving finding the eigenfunctions of the curl operator on these subdomains one can construct a global force free magnetic fields out of piecewise linear force free fields this technique will play a key role in reconciling the giroux correspondence with energy constraints specifically we plan to apply these ideas to the binding of an open book before developing a topological characterization of force free magnetic fields in terms of open books we now relate foliations to notions from electromagnetics 6 to make a precise statement boundary conditions need to be specified along with additional hypotheses in the case of r not being simply connected 7 the construction of self adjoint curl operators is the subject of another paper 11 6 p r kotiuga 2 1 cuts for magnetic scalar potentials and preferred foliations we now set the stage for confoliations and the giroux correspondence by focusing on partic ular foliations associated with maps into circles these maps have an interpretation in terms of multi valued magnetic scalar potentials which arise in the calculation of cuts for magnetic scalar potentials it turns out that the set of regular values of these maps yield foliations with compact leaves and if the map has no critical points the entire region is foliated by compact leaves to get started we need a formulation of de rham s theorems 8 9 lemma 2 4 let m be a n dimensional compact orientable manifold with possibly empty boundary and if ir or ic a field then hk m if hk m if 10 denote by c and the co homology classes associated with the co cycles c and respectively the isomorphism is given by the period map c c hk m if hk m if if 11 considered as a well defined nondegenerate bilinear pairing on co homology for pedestrians the hypothesis of mixed second partial derivatives commuting implies the following statement if f gradf for some differentiable function f on r then curlf 0 in r in the following corollary modeled on remark 2 the conditions for the existence of scalar potentials is stated in terms of the converse corollary 2 let r be any compact orientable three dimensional manifold with boundary the statement if curlf 0 in r then f gradf for some f is true whenever r is simply connected and more generally if the first homology group of the region h 1 r ir is trivial if h 1 r ir is nontrivial but all the periods of f dr vanish that is the cohomology class of is zero remark 9 when the coefficient ring is a principal ideal domain e g the integers zz we no longer have a vector space but a module and there might be torsion in computational electromagnetics and in the computation of cuts for magnetic scalar potentials one needs integer co homology groups and so we refer to a standard lemma lemma 2 5 for r any compact orientable three dimensional manifold with bound ary embedded in ir 3 all of the torsion subgroups of the co homology groups of r or r modulo its boundary when computed with coefficients in zz vanish minimal effort then produces a reformulation which is very useful for this paper 8 de rham s theorems were originally formulated as two theorems one dealing with the injec tivity of a map and the other dealing with surjectivity since the coefficient ring is a field in the lemma de rham s theorems are an isomorphism between a vector space and its dual we have not specified the space of co chains because for any reasonable choice the eilenberg steenrod axioms for a co homology theory will bail us out if we get into a trouble 9 we also avoid stating the corresponding de rham isomorphisms for relative co homology groups of m modulo boundary since the mathematical development doesn t require them except in the proof of lemma 2 6 they can arise by considering differential forms with compact supports on an open manifold with compact closure in this paper magnetic flux linking current paths are examples of relative periods near force free magnetic fields blind 7 corollary 3 for r any compact orientable three dimensional manifold with bound ary embedded in ir 3 for any co homology group of r or r modulo its boundary let be the dimension of the resulting vector space when the underlying coefficient group is ir then if the underlying coefficient group is zz the resulting abelian group is free is isomorphic to zz and forms a lattice in the vector space suppose further that r is connected with distinguished point p 0 then for any closed 1 form i e 1 cocycle with integer periods there is a well defined map from r to the unit circle in the complex plane f r s 1 given by f p exp 2 i p p 0 12 and m s 1 the homotopy classes of such maps form a group isomorphic toh 1 r zz remark 10 corollary 3 yields special foliations scalar potentials arise when the frobenius condition is satisfied trivially because curlf 0 and the periods of f dr vanish in this case the integrating factor of remark 2 disappears i e g 1 and equipotentials are compact if the periods of f dr do not vanish then there is no globally defined scalar potential however there can be a singular foliation whose leaves are compact if and only if the periods of f dr are commensurable that is the ratio of any two periods is a rational number in this case we can rescale all of the periods obtain an integer cohomology class and using the map constructed in the corollary define the leaves of the singular foliation to be the inverse images of points on the circle this observation lets us define maps into circles whose regular values form a foliation with compact leaves 10 to understand why cuts for magnetic scalar potentials are related to special foliations we will need to introduce lefschetz duality lemma 2 6 let m be a n dimensional compact connected orientable manifold with boundary m and zz the ring of integers then m has a fundamental homology class which generates hn m m zz and there is a natural isomorphisms hn k m m zz hk m zz 13 hn k m m zz h k m zz 14 these isomorphisms arise from two distinct realizations of the modules dual to hk m zz and hn k m m zz respectively one realization comes from the bi linear pairing induced by integration and the other the cup product evaluated on the fundamental class hn m m zz h n k m m zz hk m zz zz 15 remark 11 lefschetz duality being stated in terms of integer coefficients without mentioning torsion is a natural isomorphism it is valid for coefficients in any abelian group or any field if the field is ir then it applies to de rham cohomology corollary 4 let r and f p be as in corollary 3 p a regular value of f then m s 1 h 1 r zz h 2 r r zz 16 10 these maps which appeared in computational electromagnetics over a quarter century ago in the context of cuts for magnetic scalar potentials 12 are now crucial to our use of the giroux correspondence via the notion of an open book decomposition 8 p r kotiuga the isomorphisms are given by corollary 3 on the l h s and lefschetz duality on the r h s here f p 1 is an orientable embedded manifold whose relative homology class in h 2 r r zz is the lefschetz dual in h 1 r zz to the class of 1 2 i d ln f 17 thus corollary 3 and lefschetz duality lemma 2 6 allow us to give a formal definition of a cut for a magnetic scalar potential as the inverse image of a regular value of a map representing a cohomology class remark 12 if we think in terms of the exterior of a tubular neighborhood of a current carrying knot there are three very useful ways to think of a cut it enables one to use a magnetic scalar potential exterior to the cut the jump in the potential as one crosses the cut is equal to the current in the wire a surface used to compute the magnetic flux linking the current carrying knot assuming one does not have access to a vector potential a seifert surface for the knot remark 13 this formulation of the cuts problem leads to a first encounter with a blind topologist poincare assumed incorrectly that a cycle representing a ho mology class could be realized as a manifold pontryagin in a 1931 paper asked and partially answered this question in the category of differentiable manifolds he did this in knot theory where he proved the existence of an orientable embedded compact surface whose boundary is a given knot i e a seifert surface years before seifert s 1934 paper his approach was far more conceptual capable of general ization to higher dimensions and points to the pontryagin thom construction yet seifert s proof is the one found in knot theory books it is intuitive and easily presented on the page to a sighted audience yet pontryagin s approach constructs a family of cuts and the spectrum of oriented bordism a generalized cohomology theory and lays the groundwork for rene thom s fields medal in the 1950 s cuts are highly nonunique since one is free to choose any map in a homotopy class and then any regular value of the map regardless of which map we chose the inverse images of regular values form a foliation getting ambitious we can seek nice maps by putting an energy functional on the space of maps for example consider finding a solution to the variational problem of minimizing f f r gradf gradf dv 18 subject to f f 1 in r the constraint that constrains the image to s 1 for the jth cut 1 j 1 r we also fix the homotopy class of the cut 1 2 i ck grad ln f dl jk 19 here 1 k 1 r and the ck form a collection of curves representing a basis for h 1 r zz the solution to the above problem defines a harmonic map indeed the angle of the image is a harmonic function on r and readily interpretable in terms of magnetic fields 11 cuts computed in this fashion enjoy all the properties of level sets of elliptic equations but their properties are hard to articulate 12 11 algorithms for computing cuts based on the finite element method work directly with the dirichlet integral and the multi valued angle on the covering space of the circle 13 9 12 we will return to the problem of nice cuts in section 3 near force free magnetic fields blind 9 2 2 confoliations and near force free magnetic fields one way of getting a feel for contact structures and confoliations is to start locally with coordinate expressions for monte and clebsch potentials remark 14 an arbitrary vector field f does not satisfy the frobenius integrability condition suppose however we found a f that differs from f by a gradient f f gradh and we require f to satisfy the frobenius condition f curlf 0 the function h would then have to be a solution to a linear first order p d e whose coefficients depend on f once such an h is found f can be expressed in terms of two scalar functions and f can be written as f ggradf gradh 20 such a triple of functions is known asmonge potentials they exist locally under the same hypotheses as the frobenius integrability theorem and are highly non unique remark 15 monge potentials ensure that any vector field with zero divergence can be expressed locally as curlf gradg gradf here g and f are known as clebsch potentials this leads to a new type of foliation curlf foliates r the region of definition and the leaves are the curves formed locally by intersecting level sets of f and g in this way clebsch potentials parameterize flux tubes in solenoidal fields this picture is intimately tied to faraday s tubes and slices remark 16 locally monge potentials give an interesting triple product f curlf gradg gradf gradh 21 using differential forms if f dr this becomes manifestly metric invariant d dg df dh 22 definition 2 7 let be a 1 form on r a compact orientable 3 d manifold ex press the 3 form of the frobenius condition as a multiple of the volume form d mdv 23 is a contact structure if m 0 everywhere or m 0 everywhere is a confoliation if m 0 everywhere or m 0 everywhere remark 17 the intuition of behind a contact structure was given in remark 4 while the intuition of behind a foliation was given in remarks 3 and 10 naively a confoliation is part contact structure and part foliation a powerful perspective is the following confoliations are the boundary of the space of contact structures let us denote by supp f the support of a vector field f definition 2 8 let v supp b supp j the magnetic field b is a near force free field if on every connected component of v j 2 b 2 j b 24 comparing definitions 2 1 and 2 8 we have lemma 2 9 the various notions of constrained magnetic fields are related by linear force free force free near force free by definition 2 8 and equation 4 we have lemma 2 10 let b be a near force free field and suppose that 10 p r kotiuga displacement currents are negligible so that curlh j supp b supp h so that v supp h supp j then on any connected component of v h curlh is nonzero and can t change sign from remark 10 definition 2 7 and lemma 2 10 we now have lemma 2 11 with the same hypotheses as lemma 2 10 and if the sign of the current helicity density is same on each connected component of v then h defines a singular foliation in the complement of supp j h defines a contact structure on v furthermore if h is nonzero on the complement of supp j then h defines a foliation in the complement of supp j h defines a confoliation on ir 3 remark 18 lemmas 2 11 and 2 9 make clear that confoliations and the math ematical results concerning them are applicable to the topological characterization of near force free magnetic fields and other more restrictive force constraints 13 from a topological point of view what remains unsatisfying is the lack of char acterization of the leaves of the foliation in the complement of supp j we also don t have a simple characterization of the global topology of the magnetic field open book decompositions and the giroux correspondence will help resolve this 2 3 a toy inverse problems for near force free magnetic fields let s pro pose a problem which is rhetorical in the sense that our goal is not to try proving existence of solutions as a first step rather we will use it to introduce open book decompositions and the giroux correspondence in the context of near force free magnetic fields it is reasonable to expect the inverse problem to be formulated as a free boundary value problems for a system of pdes the toy problem is introduced here is an attempt to abstract the topological essence of equilibrium configurations by a reformulation in terms of knot and link theory a field with well studied and readily computable algebraic invariants remark 19 although introducing knots and links has intuitive appeal later grief can only be avoided with proper definitions and well defined concepts under stere ographic projection there is a one point compactification of ir 3 where ir 3 is identified with s 3 the unit sphere in ir 4 hence if noncompactness is an issue in subsequent developments identify ir 3 with s 3 an isotopy is a homotopy through embeddings knots are embeddings of s 1 into s 3 modulo an equivalence relation which we would like to be ambient isotopy however this equivalence relation would make knot theory trivial hence we define tame knots and links definition 2 12 an n component link is an embedding of a disjoint union of n circles into ir 3 or s 3 n 1 gives a knot a tame n component link is a link whose image is ambient isotopic to n piecewise linear curves n 1 gives a tame knot 13 these include plasmas equilibria in either controlled environments or in space here force constraints are implicit in the notion of equilibrium superconducting magnet design where the normal temperature is dependent on the magnetic field transverse to the current flow and other applications what may be surprising is that the additional hypotheses in lemma 2 11 relate to reconnection points in plasma physics near force free magnetic fields blind 11 remark 20 in subsequent developments depending on context by knots and links we will mean either tame knots and links or their ambient isotopy classes the definition of a tame knot also ensures the existence of a tubular neighborhood again depending on context when may refer to knots and links and their tubular neigh borhoods interchangeably this identification allows us to talk about current car rying knots and links without a discussion about whether this is possible with finite energy the toy inverse problem for current carrying links arrange a current carrying link so the lorentz force vanishes on it recall that a closed braid 3 is a link that can be represented in cylindrical coor dinates as a curve whose tangent vector has a positive projection on the unit vector in the circumferential direction that is a closed braid generalizes the notion of a wound coil to expose the practical implications of this toy problem consider alexander s theorem 3 lemma 2 13 any link can be represented by a closed braid remark 21 by alexander s theorem we can isotope any knot into a closed braid and so we ask what knot types produce nice force free coils crager and kotiuga conjectured that knot types of such optimal coils have equal alexander and thurston norms see 4 for some pictures suggesting that torus knots both have the desired topological properties and a close connection to the field lines as sociated to the eigenfunctions of the curl operator on the torus as we shall soon see open books are solutions to our toy problem and by the theory of the alexander polynomial 3 have the conjectured topological property remark 10 shows that for a current carrying link with commensurable cur rents the multivalued magnetic scalar potential in the exterior of the link has compact equipotentials when the link is identified with v in lemmas 2 10 2 11 we have the conditions under which we have a confoliation and a near force free magnetic field as a solution to our toy problem explicitly we have lemma 2 14 suppose the multivalued scalar potential has commensurable peri ods in the link s complement no critical points so all equipotentials are isotopic and the current forms a near force free magnetic field in some tubular neighborhood of the link then the toy problem has a solution in the form of a confoliation remark 22 in the link complement lemma 2 14 yields solutions to our toy problem as circle valued morse functions 20 which are perfect or perfect morse novikov functions in the language of space plasmas near force free magnetic fields are thus associated with the absence of reconnection points 2 4 open book decompositions and the giroux correspondence we fol low etnyre 19 for basic definitions and proofs pertaining to open book decomposi tions and the giroux correspondence definition 2 15 an open book decomposition of a compact orientable manifold m is a pair b where b is an oriented link in m called the binding of the open book 14 14 one might be tempted to call b the spine of the open book but in the context of three dimensional manifolds the spine of a manifold has a specific technical meaning and so binding is used in order to avoid confusion however since the foliation also defines a fiber bundle one must remember that b is not the base of the fiber bundle but the binding of the open book 12 p r kotiuga and is a fibration from the complement of b to s 1 such that 1 p is the interior of a compact surface p in m and p b for all p in s 1 for any p the surface p is called a page of the open book corollary 5 of lemma 2 14 under stereographic projection of euclidean space solutions to our toy inverse problem which are free of reconnection points are topologically characterized by open book decompositions of s 3 subject to positive twists on their bindings induced by the existence of a contact structure on a tubular neighborhood of the binding two results give intuition for open book decompositions as special confoliations and their relationship to the space of contact structures first the connected com ponents of the space of contact structures are contractible and confoliations which are not contact structures lie in the boundary 8 second by a result of thurston and winkelnkemper 17 every open book supports a contact structure and so are distinguished confoliations that is an open book can deformed into a contact structure within the space of confoliations the giroux correspondence refines this proposition 1 the giroux correspondence 8 for m 3 closed and oriented there is a 1 1 correspondence between oriented contact structures up to isotopy and open book decompositions up to positive stabilization remark 23 in the context of the toy inverse problem it is important to note that as one approaches a current carrying wire whose radius of curvature is huge compared to its radius the magnetic field diverges like d 1 where d is the distance to the the center of the wire this shows that a wire with vanishing radius has an infinite amount of magnetic energy per unit length hence it will be imperative to consider our toy problem and the use of the giroux correspondence in the context of finite energy constraints this is easily handled by replacing the binding of the open book by a tubular neighborhood and solving an eigenvalue problem for a self adjoint curl operator on the tubular neighborhood the lagrangian boundary conditions used to render the curl operator self adjoint are the ones that correspond to having the trace of the magnetic field correspond to a closed 1 form when pulled back to the boundary such boundary conditions are unique up to a choice of lagrangian subspace of the first homology group of the boundary of the tubular neighborhood when considered as a symplectic vector space 11 the key point to remember is that this choice of self adjoint boundary condition is tied to the positive stabilization in the giroux correspondence theorem 2 16 in the absence of reconnection points as in remark 22 the giroux correspondence of proposition 1 sets up a correspondence between solutions to the toy inverse problem as characterized by corollary 5 and near force free magnetic fields as characterized by lemma 2 11 for fixed magnetic energy by remarks 6 8 and 23 the positive stabilization of the giroux correspondence articulates the twisting of a linear force free magnetic field on a fixed tubular neighborhood of an open book s binding 3 interlude the rhetorical quest for intuitive cuts consider the dis tinction between intuitive but not computable and computable but unintuitive let g be the fundamental group of a compact orientable four manifold it is a finitely presented group whose generators and relations have a simple interpretation in near force free magnetic fields blind 13 terms of surgery yet basic questions about it are not decidable in the sense of tur ing this connection is both the basis for proving that there can be no algorithm to classify 4 manifolds up to diffeomorphism and a prime example of an algebraic structure which is intuitive but not computable on the other hand homology in any dimension is computable via the smith normal form but as pontryagin and thom showed it deals with cycles which are not necessarily interpretable in terms of manifolds homology is a prime example of something which is computable but unintuitive in 3 d poincare duality demands that cuts need to be oriented cycles but in principle little else is required these orientable cycles are computable but they are not intuitive especially as subcomplexes of a 3 d finite element mesh realizing cuts as orientable embedded manifolds by exploiting the properties of maps into circles doesn t seem to be rooted in intuition and the underlying math ematics can seem divorced from applications yet history shows otherwise hence we are challenged to understand why certain effective tools for problem solving are dismissed as unintuitive taking up this challenge will lead us to valuable insights concerning the work of late onset blind topologists consider a rhetorical question what are nice cuts seeking an answer to this rhetorical question is a game of specifying more con straints on a cut which would still make cuts easy to compute but also intuitive especially if this can be achieved with a minimal amount of computational overhead so consider three possible suggestions for what a nice cut can be 1 compact orientable embedded manifolds with boundary coembs 2 genus minimizing coembs 3 minimal area coembs some valuable insights follow from preliminary observations the disc is a cut for the textbook example of a circular planar loop and it enjoys all of these properties however textbook examples are of little use for probing the rhetorical question the algorithm based on a harmonic map into the circle proposed and implemented decades ago 13 9 ensures that the cut is a coemb and finds it in polynomial time with polynomial order quadratic in the worst case so far so good realizing cuts as embedded manifolds is not a logical necessity and so a pragmatic person may question the need to have embeddings in the first place however embedded level sets of an elliptic equation come as a by product of the algorithm and are relatively easy to visualize and understand unlike immersions unfortunately there are no conjectures about having a level set which is either genus or area minimizing given the discussion of the topological characterization of force free magnetic fields via thurston and alexander norms it would be wonderful if there were a robust algorithm to produce a cut realized as a genus minimizing coemb unfor tunately thurston et al 10 have shown that there is no polynomial time algorithm that produces a coemb of minimal genus in general we can replace the harmonic map functional by the lp norm of the magnitude of the gradient when we do this for the l 1 norm the solution gives an area minimizing current in the sense of de rham however this does not ensure that the solution is unique or an area minimizing coemb and the discretized problem leads to a linear programming problem for which no worst case polynomial time algorithm exists 14 p r kotiuga thurston and almgren 1 produced unknotted curves which bound only sur faces of high genus within their convex hulls since any minimal surface lies in the convex hull of its boundary this shows that in general one cannot expect to find a coemb which is both area minimizing and minimal genus incidentally their examples involve unknotted smooth curves with relatively small curvature from these deliberations on what a nice cut might be it is clear that in developing a general algorithm the harmonic map approach not only side steps the pitfalls of exponential time algorithms but the solution time is quadratic in the worst case and practical in practice the nonexistence of polynomial time algorithms to handle area or genus minimization reinforced the computable but unintuitive nature of this solution yet those who sought a nicer and more intuitive solution still grieve remark 24 the work on cuts as presented so far exposed us to the work of pontryagin and giroux as we wrestle with the more intuitive questions we come face to face with the work of other late onset blind geometers and topologists first the problem of area minimization leads to plateau s problem joseph plateau was a belgian solar physicist who was completely blind by the age of forty as a result of staring at the sun he lived to the age of eighty and his work on capillary forces and minimal surfaces was undertaken long after he was blind second in the process of understanding embedded and immersed cuts the problem of sphere eversion emerges 6 that is turning the sphere inside out homotopically through immersions it was bernard morin who first showed the world how to visualize the sphere eversion what was strange was that he was blind from the age of six bottom line in the quest for nice cuts the above paragraphs drops the names of four late onset blind topologists a conclusion one can draw from this explo ration is that in the process of coming up with efficient and effective algorithms to compute cuts one discovers key topologists and geometers who gave us the tools to construct and visualize cuts and force free magnetic fields pontryagin giroux plateau morin who were all blinded after the age of five and did their significant mathematical work years after they were blinded 4 mathematics evolves while embracing faustian bargains in 2 sir michael atiyah identified a type of mathematical faustian bargain in terms of giving up geometry for algebra algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician the devil says i will give you this powerful machine it will answer any question you like all you need to do is give me your soul give up geometry and you will have this marvelous machine nowadays you can think of it as a computer of course we like to have things both ways we would probably cheat on the devil pretend we are selling our soul and not give it away nevertheless the danger to our soul is there because when you pass over into algebraic calculation essentially you stop thinking you stop thinking geometrically you stop thinking about the meaning although easy to accept intellectually this became significant for the author when he corresponded with with late onset blind mathematicians in this new context the faustian bargain became one of giving up three dimensional spatial intuition for the convenience of putting arguments on the page and calculation is only one aspect of the new convenience the author was surprised to find that euclidean near force free magnetic fields blind 15 geometry was not an inspiring subject that appealed to those who would be late onset blind topologists both morin and giroux confirmed that it was math for lawyers in that there were two columns one with pictures and the statement of the the problem while one had to write out the steps of a proof in the other column although important training for writing out arguments and appreciating proofs it did little to kindle the spark of spatial geometry for these blind students 15 when morin and giroux were pressed on where they felt they had an edge over classmates in geometry class they came back with the same answer 16 conic sec tions the teacher would come to class with a wooden cone and ask the students to imagine how circles ellipses parabolas and hyperbolas arose as one intersected the cone with a plane the students would squirm and complain that the teacher should stop making the subject complicated and just draw a picture on the black board while the blind students would wonder what all the fuss was about since it was all obvious this brings us to the topological faustian bargain give up genuine spatial intuition for the convenience of the page it is clear that giroux and morin both avoided this topological faustian bargain not by choice but destiny in knot theory they avoid knot projections consider knots intrinsically sometimes as the boundary of their seifert surfaces to them knot projections are for those who compute knot invariants without soaking in the three dimensional context 17 remark 25 consider the story of sphere eversion in the context of this faustian bargain stephen smale a thesis student of raoul bott proved the result 16 at the time of smale s thesis raoul bott was an electrical engineer who had metamor phosed into an iconic topologist known for bott periodicity via the application of morse theory to the loop spaces of the classical lie groups so it is startling that bott refused to believe smale s proof because he couldn t see it not being able to find a gap in the proof bott sought strategies to prove the opposite result but to no avail finally through the clay models and careful arguments of bernard morin bott was able to see and feel the result 18 the moral is the bott ignored smale s legitimate proof of sphere eversion and exhibited uncharacteristically stubborn and simple minded behavior when he ex pected the problem to be resolved by the topological faustian bargain and it wasn t on the other hand morin did not have the any perceived advantage in succumbing to the temptation offered by the page 19 15 the author has to confess that in high school his spark for three dimensional thinking was not kindled in geometry class but in drafting class by exploded views of machine parts drawings of sections and developments but this leads us to monge and descriptive geometry 16 personal communication 17 not all projections are being trivialized here projecting four dimensions into three is natural if one wants an obvious proof that curves can be unknotted in four dimensions such a projection is in the style of the late onset visually impaired 18 see silvio levy http www geom uiuc edu docs outreach oi history html for history 19 the story doesn t end here over the decades many sphere eversion animations have been made but they are not particularly effective for visualizing smale s proof it is amazing is that morin can articulate why each one is ineffective he sits with people who find the movies ineffective and asks questions as they repeatedly watch the movies as he teaches them the material he gets a feel for what was missing in the movie 16 p r kotiuga 4 1 three groups who have avoided the topological faustian bargain it is difficult to talk about this faustian bargain since written communication and pla nar diagrams had been ingrained in our culture since well before the enlightenment mathematicians prove a new result by any means available and it is unthinkable that a mathematician would give up calculation written communication and 2 d visualization for no good reason productive mathematicians also find it a distrac tion to ask how they prove results given their nationality gender physiology or on account of some other characteristic such as a disability if one tries to identify those who avoid the topological faustian bargain one must start with groups of mathematicians whose use of spatial reasoning is not inspired by the page to begin with and identify topics that are not amenable to representation on a page the author speculates there are at least three such groups the first group consists of astronomers although astronomy is highly auto mated today with many specialists in previous centuries it was not only at the cutting edge of theoretical physics and experimental technique but also on the cut ting edge of the mathematics furthermore those on the forefront of all these fields were also the ones peering through the telescopes a planet s trajectory is a curve in a four dimensional space time a star gazing astronomer tries to make sense of the cosmos for which there is no simple model reduction yet accurate solutions to ill posed problems are required if one wants to keep track of individual bodies the following three astronomers are known primarily for their mathematical work johan friedrich pfaff his 1786 dissertation had to do with celestial mechan ics pfaff is well known mathematically for his 1812 monograph on pfaffian or differential forms he figures prominently in the theory of integrability frobe nius theorem and the history of the generalized stokes theorem two of pfaff s students are gauss and moebius carl friedrich gauss his 1799 dissertation had to do more with topology than astronomy but astronomy geodesy and terrestrial magnetism were the focus of gauss day job at least four of gauss students are trained as astronomers bessel gerling encke and von staudt and they generate almost all of gauss academic descendants gauss estimated the trajectory of ceres and developed many powerful mathematical techniques in the analysis of astronomical data gauss mentoring of geometers and topologists e g listing wichmann and riemann happened late in his career or in retirement august ferdinand moebius his 1815 dissertation was on astronomy but the theses of his students were uniformly on geometry and astronomy a moon crater and an asteroid are named after him in retirement he and j b listing discov ered the moebius band independently although he has major contributions to number theory his contributions to geometry include introduction of homogeneous coordinate into projective geometry and the moebius transformation two dimensions may suffice for a textbook explanation of kepler s contributions but subsequent developments in astronomy required much more these astronomers had a great impact on the techniques of n dimensional geometry 20 when one looks at topological aspects of gauss work e g fundamental theorem of algebra via winding numbers the gauss bonnet theorem and linking numbers it is clear that he avoided the topological faustian bargain but difficult to see how since his results often appear in final form as if on stone tablets after a trip up some mountain 20 their significant results are typically found in diaries and correspondence since crelle s jour nal the first significant mathematics journal not tied to an academy was founded in 1826 near force free magnetic fields blind 17 the second group consists of 20 th century rock climbers although rock climbing topologist conjures up many names let s focus on three james waddell alexander ii 1888 1971 21 georges de rham 1903 1990 and hassler whitney 1907 1989 we already encountered mathematical results of the first two whitney forms are well known to those in computational electromagnetics but this doesn t scratch the surface of the mathematical contributions of each each also made significant con tributions to rock climbing 22 the pressing question is what does rock climbing have to do with topology it cannot be answered here but consider the intense planning and decision making required in rock climbing to get a hint planning a climb involves local and global decisions made both in advance and on the spot path planning is crucial since descending is usually far more dangerous than ascend ing decisions are made on the fly based on both visual and tactile information getting a foothold around a corner while feet are obscured and the blood circulation in one s hands is rapidly decreasing finally life and death issues revolve around a wide variety of tiny gadgets and tying the correct knot at the right time the third group consists of late onset visually impaired topologists it is only in the third group that one can make a reasonable hypothesis about neuroplasticity 4 2 early vs late onset blind mathematicians neuroplasticity given the topological characterization of near force free magnetic fields the rhetorical search for nice cuts and the algorithms to compute them the topological faustian bar gain and those who may have evaded it we now hope to avoid aspects of intuition and conventional wisdom when considering a difficult subject one cannot sys tematically survey blind mathematicians since it would be impossible to find a statistically significant sample within a group of brilliant topologists however we are equally blind in higher dimensions 23 and there are two things one can do 1 list famous blind mathematicians to identify characteristics of topologists 2 correspond with blind topologists hoping to avoid misconceptions eight blind mathematicians are listed below 24 although statistically insignificant it exhibits excellent correlation between onset of blindness and field of research nicholas saunderson 1682 1739 cambridge university s 4 th lucasian prof newton was the 2 nd and a colleague perhaps the first to discover bayes theorem performed spectacular calculations on an abacus he developed blind from birth joseph antoine ferdinand plateau 1801 1883 see remark 24 belgian physi cist who also studied math completely blind by age 42 contributions to minimal surfaces plateau s problem and capillary action were initiated later on in life 21 alexander s chimney in rocky mountain national park co usa is named after him 22 for anecdotes about the interaction of the three climbing together see page 13 of 18 23 notions like transversality from differential topology when applied to higher dimensional spaces give us a feel for how one can do mathematics in a context where sighted and nonsighted are equally blind 24 when discussing this with david mumford years ago he suggested that notoriously short sighted topologists who seldom proof read their papers should be included on this list in particular he was thinking of henri poincare bill thurston and possibly leonhard euler indeed consid ering the evolution of three dimensional topology the names of poincare and thurston figure prominently however as we shall soon see they are different from the late onset blind plateau pontryagin morin and giroux in that their disabilities do not force them make a clean break from the faustian bargain as presented by atyiah furthermore one cannot reasonably speculate on the role of neuroplasticity in their work since they they had their eyesight at the beginning of their professional careers and they lack a distinct event that contributed to a total loss of eyesight 18 p r kotiuga louis antoine 1888 1971 was blinded at age 29 in wwi after the war henri lebesgue his thesis advisor directed him toward topology since it was suited to those who do not like to read he published on antoine s necklace in 1921 a high school math teacher by training he went to grad school and taught in a university only after losing his sight lev semenovitch pontryagin 1908 1988 many contributions to topology but also recognized for work in applied mathematics done after 1952 blinded by an explosion at age 14 he started a serious study of topology at age 19 known for pon tryagin duality solving hilbert s fifth problem for abelian groups the pontryagin thom construction see remark 13 using morse theory to compute the poincare polynomials of classical compact lie groups and pontryagin characteristic classes bernard morin 1931 see remark 25 blinded at age six known for work in low dimensional topology sphere eversions and boy s surface parameterizations abraham nemeth 1918 2013 math prof known primarily for mathematical extensions to the braille code and the math speak initiative blind from birth lawrence baggett blinded at age five known for work in harmonic analysis emmanuel giroux blind by age eleven contact geometer known for the giroux correspondence relating open books to isotopy classes of contact structures these eight mathematicians fit nicely into three groups 1 saunderson nemeth blind from birth their mathematics is mainstream and doesn t have a distinctly spatial aspect 2 pontryagin plateau morin and giroux are unique blinded after the age of five they learned their type mathematics more than five years after losing their sight the mathematics they are known for is not computational or conjectural but involves concrete geometric or topological constructions 3 antoine and baggett are analysts one is tempted to put louis antoine in the second group since he was blinded after age five but he differs from those in that group since his main research results were obtained within five years of being blinded although his work is considered topology his techniques of proof are more akin to those of an analyst than a topologist 25 being blinded at the borderline age of the late onset blind one is also tempted to put lawrence baggett in the second group but he mastered the tools of a conventional mathematician and made his mark as an analyst of these three groups the second is distinct from the first and third by the crucial role played by cross modal plasticity cross modal plasticity is a specific example of neuroplasticity and it is particularly significant in the present context one can see that the mathematicians in the second group spent well over 10 000 hours in a world where they integrated their visual systems with their other senses as they did the things that kids do and then another 10 000 hours in a world where path planning without visual input was key before obtaining major mathematical results in fewer words we might advance the following hypothesis late onset blind mathematicians with 10 000 hours of visually deprived path planning are topologists it is impossible to test this hypotheses with a statistically significant sample if progress in mathematics requires studying the masters and not their students 25 the author is grateful to bernard morin for this insight near force free magnetic fields blind 19 it behooves us appreciate the consequences of this hypothesis through a study of scarce but useful literature and of living pioneers without distracting them from their research alternatively one might find a statistically significant sample by studying situations where sighted people are distracted by their visual systems and choose to ignore them 26 to see why neuroplasticity should play a central role in the hypothesis consider more of sir michael atiyah s wisdom 2 our brains have been constructed in such a way that they are ex tremely concerned with vision vision i understand from friends who work in neurophysiology uses up something like 80 or 90 per cent of the cortex of the brain there are about 17 different centres in the brain each of which is specialised in a different part of the process of vision some parts are concerned with vertical some parts with horizontal some parts with colour or perspective and finally some parts are concerned with meaning and interpretation understanding and making sense of the world that we see is a very important part of our evolution therefore spatial intuition or spatial perception is an enormously powerful tool and that is why geometry is actually such a powerful part of mathematics not only for things that are obviously geometrical but even for things that are not we try to put them into geometrical form because that enables us to use our intuition late onset visual impairment and subsequent cross modal plasticity is key to the hypothesis because the late onset blind had the neural connections of a typical visual system which were coopted for a world of careful nonvisual task planning 27 5 conclusions and outlook the main result of the paper is theorem 2 16 it exploits the giroux correspondence to relate two characterizations of near force free magnetic fields in the absence of reconnection points one characterization is a consequence of the definition of near force free magnetic field and the other comes from the consideration of a toy inverse problem along the way we noted how leveraging results from higher dimensional topology isolates abstractions can lead to cleaner development of algorithms and that these tools often have their roots in three dimensions but in the hands of late onset blind topologists subject to an additional hypotheses pertaining to neuroplasticity this additional hypothesis is carefully developed in the context of a topological faustian bargain this research can be taken in many directions the function spaces arising from equivalence relations arising in topology yield natural roles for the calculus of variations historically this is the story of morse theory and hodge theory for cuts it was harmonic maps for sphere eversions it can be willmore energy for linear force free magnetic fields it is an eigenvalue problem for a helicity functional all these tie the finite element method to challenging problems in visualization 26 three such instances come to mind first i am grateful to douglas hofstader for pointing me to chess masters who prefer to keep track of the game by imagining the board rather than by looking at it blind chess second one could point to the practice of studying a map before embarking on a trip to a new destination and not looking at it while traveling third there are legends of geometers most notably jacob steiner who successfully taught geometry in the dark 27 path planning without visual input suggests an analogy walking with visual feedback is like driving absorbed and enslaved by a gps a person walking effectively without visual feedback is like a person who looks at a map once and drives to an unfamiliar place without a gps 20 p r kotiuga the first side lesson is heuristics and intuition invite lousy algorithms and denial about the applicability of mathematics pedagogically there s the issue of program ming environments for late onset blind stem students the use of latex and the relative merits of looking at pictures versus creating one s own pictures and models acknowledgments the author
