sigma adequate link diagrams and the tutte polynomial adam giambrone university of connecticut adam giambrone uconn edu abstract in this paper we characterize the sigma adequacy of a link diagram in two ways in terms of a certain edge subset of its tait graph and in terms of a certain product of tutte polynomials furthermore we show that the symmetrized tutte polynomial of the tait graph of a link diagram can be written as a sum of these products of tutte polynomials where the sum is over the sigma adequate states of the given link diagram using this state sum we show that the number of sigma adequate states of a link diagram is bounded above by the number of spanning trees in its associated tait graph by combining results we give a method to find all of the sigma adequate states of a link diagram finally we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a link diagram to be sigma adequate and sigma homogeneous also called homogeneously adequate with respect to a given state 1 introduction since the early years of knot theory a correspondence between link diagrams and edge signed planar graphs called tait graphs has been known to exist 20 as a means to study both links and graphs polynomial invariants have been used an important polynomial invariant of graphs introduced in 1947 is the two variable tutte polynomial 26 and an important polynomial invariant of links introduced in 1984 is the one variable jones polynomial 9 10 as shown by kauffman in 12 the jones polynomial satisfies a recursive skein relation that parallels the contraction deletion relation of the tutte polynomial deepening the connection between the jones and tutte polynomials thistlethwaite expressed the jones polynomial of an alternating link in terms of the tutte polynomial of its associated tait graph 23 and soon after kauffman extended this result to all links by defining a tutte polynomial for edge signed graphs 13 kauffman also generalized the jones polynomial to a two variable laurent polynomial that is now called the kauffman polynomial 14 using the unnormalized kauffman polynomial of a link diagram thistlethwaite 25 extracted two boundary term polynomials d t and d t called critical line polynomials in 22 and expressed each such polynomial as a product of two tutte polynomials where the tutte polynomials come from edge contractions and edge deletions of the associated tait graph from this thistlethwaite shows that a link diagram is a adequate resp b adequate if any only if the boundary term polynomial d t resp d t is nonvanishing the family of semi adequate links that is links that have either a or b adequate diagrams was introduced by lickorish and thistlethwaite 17 18 and is a very large family of links for example the family of semi adequate links has been shown to contain all alternating links all adequate links all montesinos links all positive and negative closed braids all closed 3 braids and all planar cables of the link families just mentioned 17 21 to give a sense of how frequently 1 ar x iv 1 60 7 04 24 4 v 1 m at h g t 1 4 ju l 20 16 semi adequate links occur we have that all knots with at most 10 crossings are semi adequate and all but two 11 crossing prime knots are semi adequate 22 as one would expect the family of semi adequate links has been widely studied 1 5 8 11 16 17 18 21 22 25 while many knots and links are known to be semi adequate it has been shown 17 22 25 that there exist links that are neither a nor b adequate such links are sometimes called inadequate in this paper we extend some of the results of thistlethwaite from 25 to the larger family of adequate link diagrams where denotes a fixed but arbitrary state of a link diagram to begin let d denote a checkerboard colored link diagram with associated tait graph g given that the edges of g are labeled with or and given that the crossings of d are either a resolved or b resolved according to the state we use e to denote the union of the edges of g whose corresponding crossings are a resolved and the edges of g whose corresponding crossings are b resolved given the edge subset e e g let g e denote g restricted to the edge set e and let e e g e denote the complement of the edge set e the first main result of this paper is given below theorem 1 1 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g then d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if there exists a partition e g e te of the edges of g such that the following conditions hold 1 every edge of e is contained in a cycle of g e 2 no edge of e has both endpoints on a connected component of g e to generalize the boundary term polynomials of thistlethwaite 25 we define for each state of a link diagram a polynomial d t that is a product of two tutte polynomials and that reduces to a boundary term polynomial when the state being considered is the all a state or the all b state using the polynomial d t we extend thistlethwaite s nonvanishing result to the family of adequate link diagrams theorem 1 2 let d be a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g then d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if d t 6 0 given the tutte polynomial g x y of the tait graph g associated to a checkerboard colored link diagram d call g t t the symmetrized tutte polynomial of g the third main result of this paper stated below gives a adequate state sum expansion for g t t theorem 1 3 let d be a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g then the symmetrized tutte polynomial of g can be expanded as g t t adequate states d t using this state sum we are able to bound the number of adequate states of a link diagram theorem 1 4 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g then the number of adequate states of d is bounded below by two and above by the number of spanning trees in g 2 by combining the results of theorem 1 1 theorem 1 2 and theorem 1 3 we present a method for finding all of the adequate states of a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram we highlight this method by using it to find all 20 adequate states of the standard diagram 3 of the nonalternating inadequate knot 11 n 95 next we apply the notion of partial duality as defined by chmutov in 4 to the ribbon graph associated to the black checkerboard state of a checkerboard colored link diagram in order to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a link diagram to be adequate and homogeneous also called homogeneously adequate with respect to a given state the family of links with homogeneously adequate diagrams has been studied by a number of authors 2 6 7 19 theorem 1 5 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g then d is homogeneously adequate with respect to a state if and only if there exists a partition e g e t e of the edges of g such that the following conditions hold 1 every edge of e is contained in a cycle of g e 2 no edge of e has both endpoints on a connected component of g e 3 each connected component of g e either consists entirely of edges or consists entirely of edges 4 the edges of e inside a fundamental cycle of g e either consist entirely of edges or consist entirely of edges 5 the edges of e in the unbounded region outside all of the fundamental cycles of g e either consist entirely of edges or consist entirely of edges finally we conclude the paper by modifying the method mentioned above to give a method for finding all of the homogeneously adequate states of a given link diagram as an example we show that none of the 20 adequate states of the standard diagram of the knot 11 n 95 are homogeneous thus we show that this knot diagram has no homogeneously adequate states this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide background on the tait graph as sociated to a checkerboard colored link diagram the tutte polynomial of a graph the adequacy as well as a b and semi adequacy of a link diagram and the unnormalized kauffman polyno mial and boundary term polynomials associated to a link diagram in section 3 we generalize the boundary term polynomials to the polynomials d t associated to any state of a link diagram we provide a characterization of the adequacy of a link diagram that involves edge contractions and edge deletions of the tait graph we prove theorem 1 1 theorem 1 2 theorem 1 3 and the orem 1 4 and we provide a method for finding all of the adequate states of a link diagram in section 4 we define the state ribbon graphs of a link diagram define the operation of partial duality for these ribbon graphs and build connections between the state ribbon graph perspective and the tait graph perspective for link diagrams in section 5 we introduce the families of homogeneous and homogeneously adequate link diagrams we prove theorem 1 5 and we present a method for finding all of the homogeneously adequate states of a link diagram 3 d g figure 1 an example of the bijection between a checkerboard colored link diagram d and its corresponding tait graph g 2 background in this section we present the background from graph theory and knot theory that will be used in the rest of this paper 2 1 the tait graph associated to a link diagram let d r 2 denote a diagram of a link k by replacing the crossings of d with 4 valent vertices we get the projection graph d associated to d we call d connected if d is connected from d we can form its mirror reflection denoted d by changing the crossing types of all of the crossings of d a link diagram d is called checkerboard colored if each complementary region of d which we call a region of d is shaded either black or white so that in a small neighborhood of each crossing two opposite regions are shaded black and two opposite regions are shaded white see the left side of figure 1 for an example of a checkerboard colored link diagram it is a well known result that every link diagram can be checkerboard colored definition 2 1 to a checkerboard colored link diagram d we construct the associated tait graph g as follows first we associate a vertex to each black region of d next we join a pair of distinct vertices by an edge if the two corresponding regions share a crossing of d and we join a vertex to itself if the corresponding region meets a crossing of d twice finally we label the edges with either or according to the convention displayed in the center of figure 1 what results is an edge signed planar graph g called the tait graph associated to d see figure 1 for an example of the construction of a tait graph note that the white regions of d correspond to the faces complementary regions of g also note that changing the crossing type of a single crossing of d corresponds to changing the sign of the corresponding edge of g and forming the mirror reflection d of d corresponds to changing all of the edge signs of g remark 2 1 as was first observed by tait in the late 1800 s for the case of alternating knots there is a bijection between the family of checkerboard colored link diagrams and the family of edge signed planar graphs the construction defined above gives one direction of this bijection and a medial graph construction can be used to give the reverse direction refer to 13 for more details as a special case of this bijection alternating checkerboard colored link diagrams correspond to 4 edge signed planar graphs where the edges are either all edges or all edges see the top half of figure 2 throughout this paper we will often work with reduced link diagrams definition 2 2 a link diagram d is called reduced if it contains no nugatory crossings that is crossings that meet a region of d more than once we now introduce some terminology from graph theory definition 2 3 let g be a graph an edge of g is called a loop if it joins a vertex to itself an edge e v w of g is called a multiedge if there are multiple parallel edges of g that join vertex v to vertex w an edge of g is called a bridge if deleting this edge from g increases the number of connected components a vertex of g is called a cut vertex if deleting this vertex and its incident edges from g increases the number of connected components a graph g is called nonseparable if it is connected and contains no cut vertices every graph g can be decomposed into blocks where a block is either an isolated vertex of g a bridge of g with its incident vertices a loop of g with its incident vertex or a maximally connected subgraph of g that contains no cut vertices and is neither a bridge nor a loop of g the blocks and cut vertices of a connected graph g give rise to a block decomposition of g as g g 1 g 2 gk where the gi are the blocks of g and where the gi meet at shared cut vertices of g the remark below which relates properties of a checkerboard colored link diagram to properties of its associated tait graph will be used multiple times throughout this paper remark 2 2 let d be a checkerboard colored link diagram with associated tait graph g by definition 2 1 and remark 2 1 the following statements can be shown to be true 1 the connected components of d correspond to the connected components of g 2 d is connected if and only if g is connected 3 nugatory crossings of d correspond to either bridges or loops of g 4 d is reduced contains no nugatory crossings if and only if g contains no bridges and no loops 2 2 graph operations and the tutte polynomial the graph operations of deletion and contraction with respect to both a single edge and a collection of edges will play an important role in the remainder of this paper definition 2 4 let g be a graph then for e an edge of g we use g e to denote the graph obtained from g by deleting the edge e and g e to denote the graph obtained from g by contracting the edge e our convention will be that contracting a loop is the same as deleting the loop let h e g denote a subset of the edges of g then we use g h to denote g restricted to the edges of h that is g h is the spanning subgraph of g whose vertices are the same as those of g and whose edges are the edges of h alternatively g h is the graph obtained from g by deleting the edges in the complement h e g h of the edge set h finally let g h denote the graph obtained from g by contracting the edges of h 5 a a a a b b b b aa aa bb bb figure 2 the local structure for two adjacent crossings of a checkerboard colored link diagram d left the corresponding local behavior of the black checkerboard state graph h bl center and the corresponding local behavior of the associated tait graph g right 6 the tutte polynomial of a graph is defined below definition 2 5 the tutte polynomial of a graph g denoted g x y is a two variable polynomial invariant defined recursively as follows 1 if g g 1 tg 2 t tgk is a disjoint union of k graphs then g x y g 1 x y g 2 x y gk x y 2 if g g 1 g 2 gk is a block decomposition of a connected graph g into k blocks then g x y g 1 x y g 2 x y gk x y 3 if g is nonseparable then g x y 1 if g contains no edges x g e x y if e is a bridge of g y g e x y if e is a loop of g g e x y g e x y if e is neither a bridge nor a loop of g by repeatedly applying definition 2 5 we are able to compute the tutte polynomial of the cycle graph cn with n edges proposition 2 1 cn x y x n 1 xn 2 x 2 x y recall that a graph is called planar if it can be drawn in the plane r 2 in such a way that no two edges cross each other for a planar graph the faces complementary regions are well defined we now define the planar dual of a planar graph definition 2 6 the planar dual of a planar graph g denoted g is the planar graph where the vertices of g correspond to the faces of g the faces of g correspond to the vertices of g and the edges of g correspond to the edges of g so that an edge and its planar dual intersect transversely when we overlay g with its planar dual g remark 2 3 given a planar graph g with planar dual g it can be shown that the bridges resp loops of g correspond to the loops resp bridges of g it can also be shown that contraction and deletion reverse roles under the operation of planar duality thus for e an edge of g and e the corresponding dual edge of g we have that g e g e and g e g e furthermore in the case that g is the tait graph associated to a checkerboard colored link diagram d it can be seen that changing the checkerboard coloring of d which reverses the black and white regions of d corresponds to changing from g to its planar dual g the following proposition which can be proved by applying remark 2 3 to definition 2 5 shows how the tutte polynomial behaves under the operation of planar duality proposition 2 2 if g is a planar graph with planar dual g then g x y g y x 7 b a figure 3 the a and b resolutions at a crossing of a link diagram d the a segment is colored red and the b segment is colored blue for grayscale versions of this paper the a segments will appear light gray and the b segments will appear dark gray d ha figure 4 the standard diagram d of the figure 8 knot left and its all a state graph ha right 2 3 sigma adequacy for link diagrams to define the family of adequate link diagrams we first need a precise definition of a state of a link diagram definition 2 7 let d be a link diagram we may either a resolve or b resolve a crossing of d according to figure 3 a state of d is a choice of a or b resolution at each crossing given a state of d the corresponding dual state denoted is the state where the choices of a and b resolution from the state are all reversed the all a resp all b state of d denoted a resp b is the state that results from choosing the a resolution resp b resolution at each crossing of d note that a and b are dual states given a state of a checkerboard colored link diagram we define in the remark below four types of edges of the associated tait graph remark 2 4 recall from definition 2 1 that the edges of the tait graph g associated to a checkerboard colored link digram d are labeled with either or fix a state of d since either the a or b resolution has been chosen at each crossing of d and since the crossings of d correspond to the edges of g then we can label the edges of g with either a or b therefore given a state of a checkerboard colored link digram the associated tait graph has edges that can be labeled a b a or b definition 2 8 by resolving the crossings of a link diagram d according to a state we form the trivalent state graph h that consists of a disjoint collection of state circles and a disjoint collection of state segments either a segments or b segments that are used to record the locations and types of the crossing resolutions let ha resp hb denote the state graph that arises from the all a resp all b state for an example of a link diagram and its all a state graph see figure 4 note that we may sometimes suppress the labels of a and b on the state segments of h 8 we now define what it means for a link diagram to be a b and semi adequate definition 2 9 a link diagram d is called adequate with respect to a state if its state graph h contains no state segments that connect a state circle to itself we call such a state a adequate state of d as a special case d is called a adequate resp b adequate if ha resp hb contains no state state segments that connect a state circle to itself and d is called semi adequate if it is either a or b adequate for an example of an a adequate link diagram see figure 4 note that d is a adequate if and only if its mirror reflection d is b adequate two important states of a link diagram are its checkerboard states definition 2 10 given a checkerboard colored link diagram d the black resp white checker board state of d denoted bl resp wh is the state of d where the crossings of d are resolved so that the state circles of h bl resp h wh are up to minor perturbations the boundaries of the black resp white regions of d note that bl and wh are dual states as will be shown below the black and white checkerboard states of a reduced link diagram are always adequate states proposition 2 3 every reduced link diagram d has at least two adequate states namely the black and white checkerboard states coming from a checkerboard coloring of d furthermore d is alternating if and only if the two checkerboard states bl and wh of d coincide with the all a and all b states a and b of d proof since d is reduced then by remark 2 2 and remark 2 3 neither its tait graph g nor its planar dual g contain loops by definition 2 1 definition 2 6 and definition 2 10 the vertices of g resp g correspond to the black resp white regions of d which correspond to the state circles of the black resp white checkerboard state graph h bl resp h wh moreover the edges of g resp g correspond to the crossings of d which correspond to the state segments of h bl resp h wh therefore loops of g resp g correspond to state segments of h bl resp h wh that connect a state circle to itself thus by definition 2 9 we have the first desired result the second desired result follows from considering figure 2 2 4 the kauffman and boundary term polynomials letk be an oriented link and letd be a diagram ofk with writhe w d the kauffman polynomial fk a z of k is an invariant defined by fk a z a w d d a z where d d a z is the unnormalized kauffman polynomial defined recursively as follows 1 d 1 if d is the trivial diagram of the unknot 2 d 1 a d and d 1 a 1 d where d 1 resp d 1 denotes the result of applying reidermeister move r 1 to d to increase the number of crossings of d by one and increase resp decrease w d by one 3 d is invariant under reidermeister moves r 2 and r 3 4 d satisfies the skein relation d d z d d 0 where d d d and d 0 denote the diagrams defined locally in figure 5 9 d d d d 0 figure 5 the diagrams d d d and d 0 involved in the skein relation for the unnormalized kauffman polynomial these four diagrams agree outside of the local regions depicted above let d be a link diagram with n crossings expanding d a z as d a z r s urs arzs thistlethwaite shows that urs 6 0 only if r s n theorem 4 of 24 definition 2 11 call a coefficient urs of d a z outermost if either r s n or r s n from the outermost coefficients of d a z we can construct the boundary term polynomials d t i 0 ui n i ti and d t i 0 u i n i ti in 25 thistlethwaite expresses each of the two boundary term polynomials d t and d t as a product of two tutte polynomials and shows that d t resp d t is nonvanishing if and only if d is a adequate resp b adequate proposition 2 4 theorem 1 and theorem 3 of 25 let d be a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g let e denote the set of positive edges of g and let e denote the set of negative edges of g then 1 d t g e 0 t g e t 0 and d t g e 0 t g e t 0 2 d t 6 0 if and only if d is a adequate and d t 6 0 if and only if d is b adequate 3 extending to the sigma adequate case in this section we define the polynomials d t that generalize thistlethwaite s boundary term polynomials we prove theorem 1 1 theorem 1 2 theorem 1 3 and theorem 1 4 and we provide a method for finding all of the adequate states of a link diagram 3 1 generalizing the boundary term polynomials to begin we define the polynomials that extend thistlethwaite s boundary term polynomials to every state of a link diagram definition 3 1 let d be a checkerboard colored link diagram with associated tait graph g and let be a state of d using remark 2 4 let ea denote the a edges of g let e b denote the b edges of g and let e e g denote the edge set e ea eb given the edge set e define the polynomial d t to be d t g e 0 t g e t 0 10 furthermore if we let eb denote the b edges of g and let e a denote the a edges of g then the complement e e g e of the edge set e can be defined as e eb ea note that e e where is the state dual to the state if we apply the definition of d t above to the all a and all b states of d then we get the boundary term polynomials introduced by thistlethwaite in 25 remark 3 1 by definition 3 1 if a is the all a state of a link diagram d then a d t g e a 0 t g e a t 0 g e 0 t g e t 0 d t similarly if b is the all b state of d then b d t d t in the following proposition we apply definition 3 1 to find the edge subsets e corresponding the two checkerboard states of a link diagram proposition 3 1 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g then given the black checkerboard state bl of d every edge of g is either a b edge or a a edge of g and given the white checkerboard state wh of d every edge of g is either a a edge or a b edge of g thus we have that e bl and e wh e g consequently we get that bl d t g t 0 and wh d t g 0 t proof given the tait graph g and the black checkerboard state bl remark 2 4 allows us to classify the edges of g as a b a or b edges by considering the local structure of the link diagram d the black checkerboard state graph h bl and the associated tait graph g we get that the edges of g are either b or a edges see figure 2 therefore by definition 3 1 we have that e bl since g e bl contains no edges and since g e bl g then by definition 3 1 and definition 2 5 we get that bl d t g e bl 0 t g e bl t 0 1 g t 0 g t 0 the proof for the white checkerboard state wh is similar we now establish two properties of the polynomial d t that will be used later in this paper the proposition below generalizes corollary 1 1 of 25 it should be noted that the three additional properties that appear in corollary 1 1 of 25 can also be generalized to apply to the polynomial d t proposition 3 2 let d be a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with n 1 crossings and with associated tait graph g then the polynomial d t corresponding to a state of d has the following properties 1 the coefficients of d t are nonnegative 2 d t 6 0 if and only if g e contains no bridges and g e contains no loops proof of property 1 by definition 2 5 it can be seen that the coefficients of any tutte polynomial are nonnegative hence by definition 3 1 the coefficients of d t are nonnegative proof of property 2 proceed by contraposition if g e contains a bridge then by defini tion 2 5 we have that g e 0 t 0 if g e contains a loop then by definition 2 5 we have that g e t 0 0 in either case by definition 3 1 we get that d t 0 11 proceed by contradiction assume that g e contains no bridges that g e contains no loops and that d t 0 therefore by definition 3 1 either g e 0 t 0 or g e t 0 0 suppose g e 0 t 0 then by the contrapositive of proposition 2 ii of 23 we can conclude that either g e contains a bridge or g e contains a loop since g e contains no bridges by assumption then g e contains a loop if el denotes the set of loops of g e then by definition 2 5 we have that g e 0 t t el g e el 0 t but then g e el contains neither bridges nor loops therefore by proposition 2 ii of 23 we have that g e el 0 t 6 0 which implies that g e 0 t 6 0 a contradiction the proof of the case when g e t 0 0 is similar 3 2 a tait graph perspective on sigma adequacy our goal is now to show that the adequacy of a connected checkerboard colored link diagram d can be detected from properties of the edge restricted tait graph g e and the edge contracted tait graph g e notation 3 1 for a state of a link diagram d let s d denote the number of state circles in the state graph h in the proposition below we provide an alternate definition of adequacy for a link diagram proposition 3 3 a link diagram d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if we have s d c s d where d c is the link diagram obtained from d by changing the crossing type of a single crossing c of d proof by definition 2 9 d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if its state graph h contains no state segments that connect a state circle to itself this is equivalent to the condition that every state segment s of h connects two distinct state circles of h call them c 1 and c 2 since the state segment s corresponds to a crossing call it c of d then changing the crossing type of c but not changing the state switches the local structure of the crossing resolution at c so that the new state segment call it s c now joins a state circle call it c 12 to itself therefore the condition that every state segment s of h connects two distinct state circles c 1 and c 2 of h is equivalent to the condition that s d c s d 1 where d c is the link diagram obtained from d by changing the crossing type of a single crossing c since changing the type of a single crossing of d can either increase s d by one leave s d unchanged or decrease s d by one then the equation s d c s d 1 is equivalent to the inequality s d c s d which gives the desired result we now give a state circle count for a link diagram and use it to provide a characterization of adequacy for a link diagram that uses the edge restricted and edge contracted tait graphs proposition 3 4 let d be a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with n 0 crossings and with associated tait graph g furthermore let e g denote the number of edges of g let v g denote the number of vertices of g and let k g denote the number of connected components of g then for a state of d we have the following 1 s d e g e v g e 2 k g e 2 d is adequate with respect to the state if and only if g e contains no bridges and g e contains no loops 12 c e c e figure 6 schematic for non nugatory crossings of checkerboard colored link diagrams and the associated edges in the tait graph left and the two resolutions of these non nugatory crossings and the associated local behavior of their tait graphs right proof of conclusion 1 proceed by induction on n which is both the number of crossings of d and by definition 2 1 the number of edges of g in the case when n 0 we have that d is the trivial diagram of the unknot and therefore s d 1 furthermore since e then g e g is a single isolated vertex and e g e v g e 2 k g e 0 1 2 1 1 now assume that s d e g e v g e 2 k g e for d a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with n j 0 crossings let n j 1 1 and choose an arbitrary crossing c of d which corresponds to an edge e of g case 1 suppose c is a non nugatory crossing of d by remark 2 2 this implies that e is neither a bridge nor a loop of g since there are two crossing types and two state resolutions then there are four subcases to consider by rotation we do not need to consider two separate cases for the two checkerboard colorings of d subcase 1 suppose a local neighborhood of c has the checkerboard coloring represented by the top left of figure 6 and suppose c is a resolved by the state then by remark 2 4 and definition 3 1 we have that e is a a edge of g and therefore e e let d be the link diagram formed by a resolving the crossing c and let be the state restricted to the crossings of d except c then d is a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with n 1 crossings and with associated tait graph g g e see the top right of figure 6 hence by the inductive hypothesis and the observation that g e g e e we get that s d s d e g e v g e 2 k g e e g e 1 v g e 1 2 k g e e g e v g e 2 k g e subcase 2 suppose a local neighborhood of c has the checkerboard coloring represented by the top left of figure 6 and suppose c is b resolved by the state then by remark 2 4 and definition 3 1 we have that e is a b edge of g and therefore e e let d be the link diagram formed by b resolving the crossing c and let be the state restricted to the crossings of d except c then d is a connected checkerboard colored link diagram with n 1 crossings and with associated tait graph g g e see the bottom right of figure 6 hence by the inductive hypothesis and the 13 observation that g e g e we get that s d s d e g e v g e 2 k g e e g e v g e 2 k g e subcase 3 suppose a local neighborhood of c has the checkerboard coloring represented by the bottom left of figure 6 and suppose c is a resolved by the state this subcase is very similar to subcase 2 subcase 4 suppose a local neighborhood of c has the checkerboard coloring represented by the bottom left of figure 6 and suppose c is b resolved by the state this subcase is very similar to subcase 1 case 2 suppose c is a nugatory crossing of d this case is similar to case 1 proof of conclusion 2 by proposition 3 3 d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if s d c s d where d c is the link diagram obtained from d by changing the crossing type of a single crossing c by definition 2 1 the crossing c of d corresponds to an edge e of the tait graph g and changing the crossing type of c to form d c corresponds to changing the edge sign of e let g denote the tait graph associated to d c and let e denote the edge of g corresponding to the edge e of g with its sign changed since the resolution type of c is not changed when forming d c from d then the state of d can be identified with a state call it of d c by conclusion 1 the inequality s d c s d is equivalent to the inequality e g e v g e 2 k g e e g e v g e 2 k g e 1 case 1 suppose e is a a edge of g then e e is an edge of g e while e e is not an edge of g e therefore since g e g e e then e g e v g e 2 k g e e g e 1 v g e 2 k g e e by substituting this information into inequality 1 and canceling and rearranging terms we get that k g e e k g e 1 2 since we are working with integers this inequality is equivalent to k g e e k g e 0 which is equivalent to k g e e k g e since deleting an edge either leaves the number of connected components unchanged or increases the number of connected components by one then the previous inequality is equivalent to the condition that k g e e 6 k g e 1 this says that deleting e from g e does not increase the number of connected components which means that e e does not correspond a bridge of g e case 2 suppose e is a b edge of g then e e is not an edge of g e while e e is an edge of g e therefore since g e g e e then e g e v g e 2 k g e e g e 1 v g e 2 k g e e by substituting this information into inequality 1 and canceling and rearranging terms we get that k g e e k g e 1 2 since we are working with integers this inequality is equivalent to 14 k g e e k g e 1 which is equivalent to k g e e k g e 1 since adding an edge either leaves the number of connected components unchanged or decreases the number of connected components by one then the previous inequality is equivalent to the condition that k g e e k g e 1 this says that adding e to g e decreases the number of connected components which says that e is a bridge of g e e this means that e is not contained in a cycle of g e e which means that e e does not correspond to a loop of g e case 3 suppose e is a a edge of g this case is very similar to case 2 case 4 suppose e is a b edge of g this case is very similar to case 1 since case 1 and case 4 show that g e contains no bridges and since case 2 and case 3 show that g e contains no loops then we have the desired result from proposition 3 4 we are able to prove theorem 1 1 from the introduction which gives a characterization of adequacy for a link diagram that uses only the edge restricted tait graph g e this theorem is the first main component of a method presented in section 3 5 to find all of the adequate states of a link diagram proof of theorem 1 1 by conclusion 2 of proposition 3 4 d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if g e contains no bridges and g e contains no loops since an edge of a graph is not a bridge if and only if that edge is contained in a cycle of the given graph then the condition that g e contains no bridges is equivalent to the condition that every edge of g e which can be identified with an edge in the set e e g is contained in a cycle of g e since d is reduced then by remark 2 2 g contains no loops this means that loops of g e must correspond to certain non loop edges of g since a connected component of the subgraph g e of g becomes a single vertex of g e when we contract the edges of e to form g e from g then an edge of e e g e with both endpoints on a connected component of g e becomes a loop in g e conversely since a loop of g e must come from an edge e e in a cycle of the subgraph g e e of g then e must have both endpoints on a connected component of g e therefore the condition that g e contains no loops is equivalent to the condition that no edge of e has both endpoints on a connected component of g e 3 3 generalizing thistlethwaite s nonvanishing theorem we are now ready to prove theorem 1 2 from the introduction which shows that a connected checkerboard colored link diagram d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if d t 6 0 proof of theorem 1 2 by conclusion 2 of proposition 3 4 d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if g e contains no bridges and g e contains no loops by property 2 of proposition 3 2 we have that g e contains no bridges and g e contains no loops if and only if d t 6 0 3 4 a sigma adequate state sum for the symmetrized tutte polynomial we now define the tutte polynomial that will be expressed as a adequate state sum when applied to the tait graph associated to a link diagram 15 definition 3 2 if g t t denotes the evaluation of the tutte polynomial g x y of a graph g at x y t then we call g t t the symmetrized tutte polynomial of g remark 3 2 by remark 2 3 changing the checkerboard coloring of d corresponds to changing from the associated tait graph g to its planar dual g moreover by proposition 2 2 the vari ables x and y of the tutte polynomial reverse roles under the operation of planar duality that is g x y g y x by combining these two ideas we get that the initial choice of checkerboard coloring of d has no effect on the symmetrized tutte polynomial g t t of g by restricting theorem 1 of 15 to graphs a special type of matroid and making the substi tution x y t we get the following result theorem 3 1 special case of theorem 1 of 15 the symmetrized tutte polynomial g t t of a graph g can be written as the summation g t t h e g g h 0 t g h t 0 we now prove theorem 1 3 from the introduction which shows that the symmetrized tutte polynomial of the tait graph g associated to a checkerboard colored link diagram d can be ex panded as a sum of the d t polynomials over the adequate states of d proof of theorem 1 3 let e denote an arbitrary edge of g and let c denote the corresponding crossing of d note that the and signs on the edges of g have already been determined by the choice of checkerboard coloring for d thus for each choice of edge subset h e g which also forces a choice of edge subset h e g h e g we have both a corresponding choice of state of d and a corresponding choice of edge subset e e g specifically we make the edges of h correspond to a resolved crossings of d the edges of h correspond to b resolved crossings of d the edges of h correspond to b resolved crossings of d and the edges of h correspond to a resolved crossings of d see table 1 for a depiction of this correspondence by theorem 3 1 table 1 and definition 3 1 we get that g t t h e g g h 0 t g h t 0 e e g g e 0 t g e t 0 e e g d t states d t by theorem 1 2 since d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if d t 6 0 then the summation above can be written as g t t adequate states d t from theorem 1 3 we are able to prove theorem 1 4 from the introduction which provides upper and lower bounds on the number of adequate states of a given link diagram 16 sign of edge e e h e g resolution type of crossing c e e e g yes a yes yes b yes no b no no a no table 1 a table relating subsets h e g to both states of d and subsets e e g proof of theorem 1 4 let n denote the number of adequate states of d by proposition 2 3 since the checkerboard states of d are always adequate states then we have that n 2 by the spanning tree definition of the tutte polynomial g x y we have that g t t spanning trees t of g tia t ea t where ia t denotes the internal activity of t and ea t denotes the external activity of t for more information on the spanning tree expansion of the tutte polynomial refer to 23 by theorem 1 3 we have that g t t adequate states of d d t expand g t t as a polynomial g t t amt m am 1 t m 1 a 1 t a 0 since by property 1 of proposition 3 2 the coefficients of d t are nonnegative then ai 0 for all 0 i m and no cancellation can occur in the adequate state sum expansion above since d t is a polynomial in t then it is potentially possible that each of the polynomials d t corresponding to a adequate state of d is a single monomial tia t ea t for some spanning tree t of g otherwise some of the polynomials d t are sums of monomials from the spanning tree expansion above therefore we have that n am am 1 a 1 a 0 g 1 1 where g 1 1 is the number of spanning trees of g to show that the lower bound of theorem 1 4 is sharp for diagrams of an infinite family of links we prove that the standard diagrams of the 2 n torus links for n 2 have exactly two adequate states proposition 3 5 let d be the standard diagram of the 2 n torus link for n 2 then d has exactly two adequate states namely the black and white checkerboard states bl and wh of d proof without loss of generality give d the checkerboard coloring where the unbounded region is shaded white by definition 2 1 the corresponding tait graph g is the cycle graph cn with n edges by proposition 3 1 and proposition 2 1 for the black and white checkerboard states bl and wh of d we have that bl d t cn t 0 t n 1 tn 2 t 2 t and whd t cn 0 t t since these polynomials sum to give cn t t t n 1 tn 2 t 2 2 t then by theorem 1 2 and theorem 1 3 there are exactly two adequate states of d to show that the upper bound of theorem 1 4 is sharp for diagrams of an infinite family of links we prove that the number of adequate states of the connect sum of n 1 standard diagrams of 17 the 2 2 torus link the hopf link is exactly the number of spanning trees in either of its tait graphs proposition 3 6 let d be the connect sum of n 1 standard diagrams of the 2 2 torus link the hopf link then the number of adequate states of d is exactly the number of spanning trees in a tait graph g of d proof without loss of generality give d the checkerboard coloring where the unbounded region is shaded white by definition 2 1 the corresponding tait graph g is a path of n double edges therefore by definition 2 5 we get that g t t 2 t n which gives that the number of spanning trees of g is g 1 1 2 n by figure 3 it can be seen that for d to be adequate the pair of crossings in a t 2 2 connect summand of d in a twist region of d must either be both a resolved or both b resolved the converse of this statement can also be shown to be true therefore since there are n connect summands and a choice of either both a resolutions or both b resolutions for each connect summand then there are exactly 2 n adequate states of d 3 5 a method for finding all sigma adequate states of a link diagram we now combine results to provide a method for finding all of the adequate states of a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram d step 1 construct the tait graph g associated to the checkerboard colored link diagram d step 2 look for partitions e g e t e of the edges of g that satisfy condition 1 and condition 2 of theorem 1 1 step 3 given the collection of edge partitions e g e t e from step 2 use table 1 to find the corresponding adequate states step 4 use definition 3 1 to compute the d t polynomials for the adequate states found in step 3 note that by theorem 1 2 getting that d t 6 0 will confirm that d is adequate with respect to the state step 5 use definition 2 5 to compute the symmetrized tutte polynomial g t t step 6 find the sum of the d t polynomials from step 4 and compare this to the symmetrized tutte polynomial g t t if equality is achieved then by theorem 1 2 and theorem 1 3 all of the adequate states of d have been found and confirmed if equality is not achieved return to step 2 an example of the method consider the connected reduced diagram call it d of the nonal ternating and inadequate neither a nor b adequate knot 11 n 95 from the knotinfo website 3 without loss of generality checkerboard color d so that the unbounded region of d is shaded white this is sometimes called the canonical checkerboard coloring 18 step 1 from our checkerboard coloring of d we get the tait graph g depicted on the left side of figure 7 we now break step 2 into two cases this division depends on whether or not g e consists entirely of fundamental cycles of g were a fundamental cycle of the planar graph g is the boundary of a face complementary region of g step 2 a first consider the case of theorem 1 1 where g e is a union of isolated vertices of g and fundamental cycles of g and where no edge of e has both endpoints on a connected component of g e for our labeling of the fundamental cycles of g see the center of figure 7 see table 2 for a list of the 19 collections of fundamental cycles of g with edge sets e step 2 b second consider the case of theorem 1 1 where g e is a union of isolated vertices of g and cycles of g that are not all fundamental cycles and where no edge of e has both endpoints on a connected component of g e in the case of the standard diagram d of the knot 11 n 95 there is only one such union of cycles see the right side of figure 7 step 3 a using table 1 the edge sets e from step 2 a correspond to the black checkerboard state bl the white checkerboard state wh and 17 other adequate states of d which we label as 1 2 17 as an aside the state 2 is the seifert state of d see table 2 for the list of the 19 adequate states corresponding to the edge sets e found in step 2 a step 3 b using table 1 the edge set e from step 2 b corresponds to a adequate state call it of d step 4 a using definition 3 1 we compute the polynomials d t for the 19 adequate states found in step 3 a see table 2 since d t 6 0 for each such state then we have confirmation that d is adequate with respect to each state in this collection of states step 4 b using definition 3 1 we get that d t t 4 t 3 since d t 6 0 then we have confirmation that d is adequate with respect to the state step 5 using definition 2 5 we compute the symmetrized tutte polynomial of g to be g t t 2 t 6 16 t 5 48 t 4 62 t 3 33 t 2 6 t 2 step 6 by summing the polynomials d t for the states bl wh and 1 2 17 from step 4 a see see table 2 and adding this to d t t 4 t 3 from step 4 b we get the symmetrized tutte polynomial g t t as given in equation 2 to summarize we have found and confirmed all 20 adequate states of the standard diagram d of the knot 11 n 95 the advantage of this method is that it only requires an investigation of the tait graph g to find adequate states of the link diagram d and utilizes computations of tutte polynomials for the tait graph g the edge restricted tait graphs g e and the edge contracted tait graphs g e to confirm that all of the adequate states of d have been found 19 g 6 5 4 3 2 1 figure 7 the tait graph g

corresponding polynomials d t right 20 4 applying the perspective of ribbon graphs and partial duality in this section we use work of chmutov on ribbon graphs and partial duality 4 to provide an alternate perspective on adequacy for link diagrams 4 1 ribbon graphs states and partial duality we begin by introducing the notions of ribbon graphs and partial duality as defined by chmutov in 4 definition 4 1 a ribbon graph g is a surface with boundary that consists of a vertex set v g and an edge set e g where the vertices are a collection of disks where the edges are a collection of bands and where the following conditions hold the vertices and edges intersect in a disjoint collection of line segments each such line segment is formed by the intersection of one vertex and one edge each edge contains exactly two such line segments to distinguish ribbon graphs from graphs we will often use the term vertex disk instead of vertex and edge ribbon instead of edge for examples of ribbon graphs see figure 9 and figure 10 as shown in 4 to each state of a link diagram we can associate a state ribbon graph g definition 4 2 given a state of a link diagram d we construct the corresponding state ribbon graph g as follows recall that by definition 2 8 we can use the state to construct the state graph h which consists of a disjoint collection of state circles and a disjoint collection of state segments by capping off each state circle of h with a disk in such a way that disks coming from inner circles lie above disks coming from outer circles we obtain the disjoint collection of vertex disks of g by covering each state segment of h with a planar band that deformation retracts back to the state segment we obtain the collection of edge ribbons of g it can quickly be seen that the conditions required by definition 4 1 are satisfied given the state ribbon graph g of a link diagram d we can reinterpret the adequacy of d as follows remark 4 1 by definition 2 9 we have that a link diagram d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if the state graph h contains no state segments that connect a state circle to itself since the state circles of h correspond to the vertex disks of g and since the state segments of h correspond to the edge ribbons of g then we have that d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if the state ribbon graph g associated to the state contains no loops recall that by definition 2 6 we can form the planar dual g of a planar graph g by extending the notion of planar duality to a not necessarily planar ribbon graph g we can define the geometric dual g of g by applying geometric duality to a subset call it f of the edge ribbons of a ribbon graph g we can roughly speaking form the partial dual gf of g we define one case of partial duality below see 4 for full details about geometric and partial duality 21 e v 1 v 2 e v 12 v 12 partial duality g ge figure 8 a depiction of the construction of the partial dual ge of g with respect to a non loop edge ribbon e inner vertex disk outer vertex disk figure 9 a depiction of the construction of the partial dual of the cycle ribbon graph c 4 with respect to all four of its edge ribbons the edge ribbons both before and after partial duality are shaded black while the vertex disks both before and after partial duality are shaded white we view inner vertex disks as lying above outer vertex disks in order to avoid any self intersections in the resulting ribbon graph definition 4 3 let g be a ribbon graph and let e be a non loop edge ribbon of g recall that the edge ribbon e is a four sided band and notice that two opposite sides of the edge ribbon e run along boundaries of vertex disks and the remaining two opposite sides of the edge ribbon e join the distinct vertex disk endpoints of e the partial dual of g with respect to the non loop edge ribbon e denoted ge and formed by dualizing the non loop edge ribbon e is the ribbon graph that results from reversing the roles of the pairs of opposite sides of the edge ribbon e of g see figure 8 for a local depiction of partial duality with respect to a non loop edge ribbon note that the vertex disk structure of the ribbon graph is changed by the operation of partial duality given a collection f e 1 e 2 ek of non loop edge ribbons of g the partial dual of g with respect to the collection f of non loop edge ribbons denoted gf and formed by dualizing the collection f of non loop edge ribbons is the ribbon graph that results from dualizing the edge ribbons of f all at once see figure 9 for a depiction of the construction of the partial dual of the cycle ribbon graph c 4 with respect to all four of its edge ribbons using the notion of partial duality chmutov shows that given two states of a link diagram the corresponding state ribbon graphs are partial duals of each other lemma 6 2 of 4 by applying this result to the black checkerboard state bl and any other state of a checkerboard colored link diagram d we get the following important result proposition 4 1 special case of lemma 6 2 of 4 let be a state of a checkerboard colored link diagram d and let bl denote the black checkerboard state of d then the state ribbon graph g is a partial dual of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl in particular g and g bl are partially dual with respect to the set of edge ribbons corresponding to the crossings of d where the states and bl differ from each other 22 4 2 relating the tait graph to the state ribbon graphs of a link diagram we now compare the tait graph g associated to a checkerboard colored link diagram d to the state ribbon graph g bl associated to the black checkerboard state bl of d as will be shown below these graphs encode the same information proposition 4 2 let d be a checkerboard colored link diagram with associated tait graph g let bl denote the black checkerboard state of d and let g bl denote the corresponding black checkerboard state ribbon graph then g is the spine of g bl therefore the cycles of g correspond to the cycles of g bl and the planarity of g corresponds to the planarity of g bl proof by definition 2 1 the vertices of g correspond to the black regions of d these regions correspond by considering their boundaries to the state circles of the black checkerboard state graph h bl which bound the vertex disks of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl again by definition 2 1 the edges of g correspond to the crossings of d between black regions of d these crossings correspond to the state segments of h bl which are deformation retracts of the edge ribbons of g bl thus g is the spine of g bl the remaining results follow immediately remark 4 2 for a reduced checkerboard colored link diagram d with associated tait graph g since g is the spine of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl and since d is reduced then by remark 2 2 g bl contains no loops hence by proposition 4 1 we can study the state ribbon graphs g using partial duality for collections of non loop edge ribbons of g bl definition 4 4 given a state of a reduced checkerboard colored link diagram d let e pd denote the collection of edge ribbons of g bl that must be dualized to realize g as a partial dual of g bl and let e f denote the collection of edge ribbons of g bl that are not dualized are fixed to realize g as a partial dual of g bl by remark 4 2 g bl has no loops therefore by definition 4 3 we have that g g bl e pd additionally let e pd denote the collection of edge ribbons of g that result from dualizing the edge ribbons of e pd to realize g as a partial dual of g bl and let e f denote the collection of edge ribbons of g that result from not dualizing fixing the edge ribbons of e pd to realize g as a partial dual of g bl note that the interiors of the edge ribbons of e f can be identified with the interiors of the edge ribbons of e f the endpoints of these edge ribbons however may have been changed by the operation of partial duality let g denote the tait graph associated to a checkerboard colored link diagram d and recall by definition 3 1 that e e a eb e g in the following proposition we show that the subset e e g corresponds to the subset e pd e g bl proposition 4 3 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g let be a state of d with associated state ribbon graph g and let bl denote the black checkerboard state of d with associated black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl then the edges in the subset e e g correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons in the subset e pd e g which correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons in the subset e pd e g bl as a result we also get that the edges in the subset e e g correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons in the subset e f e g which correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons in the subset e f e g bl proof given the tait graph g and the black checkerboard state bl remark 2 4 allows us to classify the edges of g as a b a or b edges since by proposition 4 2 g is 23 the spine of g bl then the edges of g and g bl must be in bijective correspondence hence by proposition 3 1 every edge ribbon of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl is either a b edge or a a edge by definition 4 4 e pd denotes the collection of edge ribbons of g bl that must be dualized to realize g as a partial dual of g bl after applying the operation of partial duality to g bl to form the state ribbon graph g the edge ribbons of e pd become either a edges or b edges of g since by definition 3 1 we have that e ea eb denotes the set of a and b edges of g corresponding to the state of d then we can see that the edges of e e g correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons of e pd e g since partial duality modifies but does not add or remove any edge ribbons then the edge ribbons of e pd e g correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons of e pd e g bl the remaining results follow immediately in the following corollary we translate theorem 1 1 from the language of the tait graph g and the edge subset e e g to the language of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl and the edge subset e pd e g bl this result follows immediately from proposition 4 2 and proposition 4 3 corollary 4 1 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and let g bl denote the black checkerboard state ribbon graph of d then d is adequate with respect to a state if and only if there exists a partition e g bl e pd t e f of the edge ribbons of g bl such that the following conditions hold 1 every edge ribbon of e pd is contained in a cycle of g bl e pd 2 no edge ribbon of e f has both endpoints on a connected component of g bl e pd in the remark below we study how partial duality affects the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl remark 4 3 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing let be a adequate state of d with associated state ribbon graph g and let bl denote the black checkerboard state of d with associated black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl then we can realize g as a partial dual of g bl in three steps step 1 first delete the edge ribbons of e f from g bl to obtain the graph g bl e pd since corollary 4 1 requires every edge ribbon of e pd to be contained in a cycle of g bl e pd for d to be adequate with respect to the state then g bl e pd consists of a union of isolated vertex disks and cycles of g bl step 2 second we apply the operation of partial duality to dualize the non loop edge ribbons of e pd and obtain the graph g e pd step 3 finally we add the edge ribbons of e f back to their original locations relabeling this collection of edge ribbons as e f and noting that the structure of the vertex disks may have been changed by the operation of partial duality see figure 10 for a depiction of the construction of the state ribbon graph g as realized as a partial dual of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl note that the corresponding connected 24 figure 10 a depiction of the construction of the state ribbon graph g as realized as a partial dual of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl the edge ribbons of e pd and e pd are shaded black while the edge ribbons of e f and e f as well as all of the vertex disks are shaded white recall that we view disks coming from inner state circles as lying above disks coming from outer state circles in order to avoid any self intersections in the resulting ribbon graph the ribbon graphs in order from left to right are g bl g bl e pd g e pd and g reduced checkerboard colored link diagram d with adequate state has been suppressed upon closer investigation the following conditions can be shown to occur during the three step partial duality process described above figure 9 and figure 10 provide useful examples 1 each isolated vertex disk of g bl e pd becomes an isolated vertex disk of g e pd which becomes a non isolated vertex disk of g 2 the inner boundary of each fundamental cycle in a connected component of g bl e pd becomes an inner vertex disk of g e pd which becomes a vertex disk of g 3 the outer boundary of each connected component of g bl e pd becomes an outer vertex disk of g e pd which becomes a vertex disk of g 4 the edge ribbons of a fundamental cycle of g bl e pd become edge ribbons of g e pd that emanate from an inner vertex disk 5 if two fundamental cycles of g bl e pd share an edge ribbon then the resulting ribbon sub graphs of g e pd share a corresponding dual edge ribbon 6 the fixed edge ribbons of e f become the fixed edge ribbons of e f where the edge ribbons of e f that are inside a fundamental cycle of g bl e pd and are incident to vertex disks of a fundamental cycle of g bl e pd become edge ribbons of e f that are incident to inner vertex disks of g e pd the edge ribbons of e f that are in the unbounded region g bl e pd and are incident to vertex disks of g bl e pd become edge ribbons of e f that are incident to outer vertex disks of g e pd 25 5 sigma homogeneous and homogeneously adequate states of a link diagram in this section we define the families of homogeneous and homogeneously adequate link diagrams we prove theorem 1 5 and we provide a method for finding all of the homogeneously adequate states of a link diagram 5 1 sigma homogeneous states of a link diagram to begin we define what it means for a link diagram to be homogeneous with respect to a state definition 5 1 let d be a link diagram and let be a state of d given that the collection of state circles of the state graphh which we will denote by s d divide the plane r 2 into complementary regions we say that d is homogeneous with respect to a state if no complementary region of s d contains both a segments and b segments we call such a state a homogeneous state of d note that the all a and all b states of d are always homogeneous states remark 5 1 it can be shown by using figure 3 that every state of an alternating link diagram d is a homogeneous state it can also be shown that given any link diagram d all of the state segments of the black resp white checkerboard state graph h bl resp h wh lie in a single complementary region of s bl d resp s wh d therefore by proposition 2 3 we can show that d is alternating if and only if both of the checkerboard states bl and wh are homogeneous states of d remark 5 2 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing let be a adequate state of d with associated state ribbon graph g and let bl denote the black checkerboard state of d with associated black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl given remark 4 3 and using figure 10 as a motivating example we can classify the nonempty complementary regions of s d as follows 1 the ribbon subgraph of g coming from a connected component of g bl e pd corresponds to a single nonempty complementary region of s d namely the single nonempty complementary region between the boundary of an outer vertex disk and a collection of boundaries of inner vertex disks 2 the ribbon subgraph of g coming from the portion of g bl e f contained inside a funda mental cycle of g bl e pd corresponds to a single nonempty complementary region of s d namely the single nonempty bounded complementary region inside the boundary of an inner vertex disk 3 the ribbon subgraph of g coming from the portion of g bl e f contained in the unbounded region of g bl e pd corresponds to a single nonempty complementary region of s d namely the single nonempty unbounded complementary region outside all of boundaries of the outer vertex disks 26 5 2 homogeneously adequate states of a link diagram we now move on to study link diagrams that are both adequate and homogeneous with respect to a state these link diagrams called homogeneously adequate link diagrams have been explored by a number of authors 2 6 7 19 definition 5 2 let d be a link diagram and let be a state of d if d is adequate and homogeneous with respect to the state then we call d homogeneously adequate with respect to the state note that an a adequate resp b adequate link diagram is homogeneously adequate with respect to the all a resp all b state a resp b we now give a characterization of when a link diagram is homogeneously adequate with respect to a state proposition 5 1 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and let g bl denote the black checkerboard state ribbon graph of d then d is homoge neously adequate with respect to a state if and only if there exists a partition e g bl e pdte f of the edge ribbons of g bl such that the following conditions hold 1 every edge ribbon of e pd is contained in a cycle of g bl e pd 2 no edge ribbon of e f has both endpoints on a connected component of g bl e pd 3 each connected component of g bl e pd has edge ribbons corresponding to crossings of d that are either all a resolved or all b resolved according to the state 4 the edge ribbons of e f inside a fundamental cycle of g bl e pd correspond to crossings of d that are either all a resolved or all b resolved according to the state 5 the edge ribbons of e f in the unbounded region outside all of the fundamental cycles of g bl e pd correspond to crossings of d that are either all a resolved or all b resolved according to the state proof conclusion 1 and conclusion 2 imply by corollary 4 1 that d is adequate with respect to the state conclusion 3 conclusion 4 and conclusion 5 imply by definition 5 1 and remark 5 2 that d is homogeneous with respect to the state since d is adequate with respect to the state then corollary 4 1 implies that con clusion 1 and conclusion 2 must hold let h denote the state graph and let g denote the state ribbon graph associated to the state of d by proposition 4 1 g can be realized as a partial dual of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl which we know to be loopless by remark 4 2 therefore we can apply partial duality to g bl using the three steps given by remark 4 3 and can by remark 5 2 classify the nonempty complementary regions of s d into three types since d is homogeneous with respect to the state then by definition 5 1 each nonempty complementary region must either contain only a segments or only b segments thus conclusion 3 conclusion 4 and conclusion 5 must hold we now rephrase proposition 5 1 changing the focus from the a and b resolutions of crossings of d to the and edge signs of the tait graph g that forms the spine of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl 27 proposition 5 2 let d be a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram with at least one crossing and with associated tait graph g let g bl denote the black checkerboard state ribbon graph of d then d is homogeneously adequate with respect to a state if and only if there exists a partition e g bl e pd te f of the edge ribbons of g bl such that the following conditions hold 1 every edge ribbon of e pd is contained in a cycle of g bl e pd 2 no edge ribbon of e f has both endpoints on a connected component of g bl e pd 3 each connected component of g bl e pd corresponds to a connected component of g e and this connected component either consists entirely of edges or consists entirely of edges 4 the edge ribbons of e f inside a fundamental cycle of g bl e pd correspond to the edges of e inside a fundamental cycle of g e and these edges either consist entirely of edges or consist entirely of edges 5 the edge ribbons of e f in the unbounded region outside all of the fundamental cycles of g bl e pd correspond to the edges of e outside all of the fundamental cycles of g e and these edges either consist entirely of edges or consist entirely of edges proof to prove this proposition it suffices to show that conclusion 3 conclusion 4 and conclusion 5 of proposition 5 1 are equivalent to the corresponding conclusions of this proposition by proposition 3 1 and proposition 4 2 given the black checkerboard state bl of d every edge of g and therefore every edge of g bl is either a b edge or a a edge therefore we have that e bl and therefore that e bl pd by proposition 4 3 the edges in the subset e e g which are either a or b edges correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons in the subset e pd e g and the edges in the subset e e g which are either b or a edges correspond bijectively to the edge ribbons in the subset e f e g this says that choosing an edge partition e g bl e pd t e f of the edge ribbons of g bl corresponds to choosing the edge ribbons of g bl that will become either a or b edge ribbons after partial duality turns g bl into g and consequently choosing the edge ribbons of g bl that will stay fixed as either b or a edge ribbons after partial duality turns g bl into g since the edge ribbons of each connected component of g bl e pd become either a or b edge ribbons then statements about a and b resolved crossings of d can be translated to statements about and edges of g and therefore g bl similarly since the edge ribbons of e f stay fixed as either b or a edge ribbons then statements about a and b resolved crossings of d can be translated to statements about and edges of g and therefore g bl we are now able to prove theorem 1 5 from the introduction proof of theorem 1 5 by applying proposition 4 2 and proposition 4 3 we are able to translate proposition 5 2 from the language of the black checkerboard state ribbon graph g bl and the edge subset e pd e g bl to the language of the tait graph g and the edge subset e e g this gives the desired result theorem 1 5 provides a way to use the tait graph g associated to a checkerboard colored link diagram d to look for all homogeneously adequate states of d 28 figure 11 the tait graph g corresponding to the canonical checkerboard coloring of the algebraic link diagram given in figure 7 of 19 all of the multiedges in the top half of the graph are edges and all of the multiedges in the bottom half of the graph are edges the right side of the graph contains as subgraphs two path graphs of length three one with all edges and one with all edges remark 5 3 in 19 ozawa claims that the algebraic link diagram given in his figure 7 call it d has no homogeneously adequate states this claim can be proved by using theorem 1 5 as follows without loss of generality give d the canonical checkerboard coloring and construct the associated tait graph g see figure 11 for a depiction of g for a contradiction suppose d has a homogeneously adequate state call it then by theorem 1 5 conclusions 1 through 5 must hold first suppose bl is the black checkerboard state then e bl and therefore g e bl contains all of the vertices of g but has no edges this violates conclusion 5 of theorem 1 5 see figure 11 now suppose 6 bl is not the black checkerboard state then e 6 and therefore g e bl contains edges by conclusions 1 and 3 of theorem 1 5 each connected component of g e must be a union of cycles all of whose edges are edges or all of whose edges are edges this means that e cannot contain any of the edges of the path subgraph of length three with all edges since there is no cycle of g with all edges that contains any of these edges see figure 11 by a similar argument e cannot contain any of the edges of the path subgraph of length three with all edges therefore the edges in these two paths of length three are forced to be contained in the unbounded region outside all of the fundamental cycles of g e this violates conclusion 5 of theorem 1 5 5 3 a method for finding all homogeneously adequate states of a link dia gram in section 3 5 we presented a method for finding all of the adequate states of a connected reduced checkerboard colored link diagram d in this section we add to this method so that all homogeneously adequate states of such a link diagram can be found steps 1 through 6 use the method from section 3 5 to find all of the adequate states of the given link diagram step 7 use conclusion 3 conclusion 4 and conclusion 5 of theorem 1 5 to determine which if any of the adequate states found above are also homogeneous with respect to the same state 29 an example of the method return to the example from section 3 5 of the diagram d of the knot 11 n 95 steps 1 through 6 in section 3 5 we found the 20 adequate states of d step 7 by applying theorem 1 5 to figure 7 we get that none of the adequate states of d are also homogeneous with respect to the given state specifically by checking through all 20 adequate states only four states satisfy conclusion 3 of theorem 1 5 these are the black checkerboard state bl and the three states 1 2 and 6 with corresponding edge subsets e forming fundamental cycles of g that bound no regions region 1 region 3 and both region 1 and region 3 respectively see table 2 in each of these four cases conclusion 4 of theorem 1 5 holds vacuously but conclusion 5 of theorem 1 5 fails therefore the standard diagram of the knot 11 n 95 has 20 adequate states but no homogeneously adequate states note that we can use theorem 1 5 to directly search for homogeneously adequate states of d while this method may be quicker the advantage to using the method of this section is that theorem 1 2 and theorem 1 3 are utilized as a means to confirm using computations of the symmetrized tutte polynomial g t t and the polynomials d t that all of the adequate states of d have been found before theorem 1 5 is utilized references 1 cody armond and dasbach the head and tail of the colored jones polynomial for adequate knots arxiv 1310 4537 to appear
