connectivity and convexity properties of the momentum map for group actions on hilbert manifolds kathleen smith doctor of philosophy graduate department of mathematics university of toronto 2013 in the early 1980 s a landmark result was obtained by atiyah and independently guillemin and sternberg the image of the momentum map for a torus action on a compact symplectic manifold is a convex polyhedron atiyah s proof makes use of the fact that level sets of the momentum map are connected these proofs work in the setting of finite dimensional compact symplectic manifolds one can ask how these results generalize a well known example of an infinite dimensional symplectic manifold with a finite dimensional torus action is the based loop group atiyah and pressley proved convexity for this example but not connectedness of level sets a proof of connectedness of level sets for the based loop group was provided by harada holm jeffrey and mare in 2006 in this thesis we study hilbert manifolds equipped with a strong symplectic structure and a finite dimensional group action preserving the strong symplectic structure we prove connectedness of regular generic level sets of the momentum map we use this to prove convexity of the image of the momentum map ii acknowledgements i would like to thank my supervisors lisa jeffrey and yael karshon for their guidance and patience over

84 bibliography 88 v chapter 1 introduction 1 chapter 1 introduction 2 in the early 1980 s atiyah 6 and independently and simultaneously guillemin and sternberg 17 arrived at a now famous finite dimensional abelian convexity result their result is theorem 1 0 1 atiyah guillemin sternberg let m be a compact connected sym plectic manifold let t be an n torus and let t m m be a hamiltonian action of t on m with momentum mapping m t let mt denote the fixed point set of then i the image mt is a finite subset of t ii m is the convex hull of mt in particular the image m is a convex polyhedron atiyah s proof of theorem 1 0 1 makes use of the following connectivity result under the same hypotheses as theorem 1 0 1 theorem 1 0 2 for every c t the level 1 c is connected or empty he deduces theorem 1 0 1 from theorem 1 0 2 over the last 30 years there has been considerable interest in various infinite dimensional hamiltonian systems namely infinite dimensional symplectic manifolds equipped with actions of finite dimensional tori for example atiyah in 6 asked whether theorem 1 0 1 could be extended in any interesting way to infinite dimensions atiyah and press ley 7 answered this question in the affirmative they proved an extension of theorem 1 0 1 for the based loop group an infinite dimensional symplectic manifold with a finite dimensional torus action before we state this result more precisely we need the following definitions let g be a compact connected and simply connected lie group fix a g invariant inner product on the lie algebra g the loop group is defined as the set of maps from chapter 1 introduction 3 s 1 to g that are of sobolev class h 1 we will denote the loop group by m 1 so m 1 h 1 s 1 g the subset g of m 1 consisting of those loops f s 1 g for which f 1 is the identity element in g is called the based loop group we refer the reader to chapter 6 for more details regarding the loop group and the based loop group atiyah and pressley in 7 prove theorem 1 0 3 let g be a compact connected and simply connected lie group with maximal torus t let g be the based loop group let r t s 1 act on g where i the rotation group s 1 acts on g by rotating the loop if g and ei s 1 0 2 then ei s s 1 and ii the maximal torus acts on g by conjugation if g and t t then t s t s t 1 note that these actions commute then the image of the momentum map is convex and it is the convex hull of the images of the fixed points remark 1 0 4 atiyah points out that the requirement that g be simply connected may be weakened to semi simple notice that g then has several connected components in this case the image of each component of g is a convex polyhedron it is the convex hull of the images corresponding to the fixed points in that particular component we will not go into the very detailed proof of theorem 1 0 3 which is specific to this example of the based loop group we do nevertheless note that atiyah and pressley in 7 remark that their theorem 1 0 3 could be proved by extending the method of proof of theorem 1 0 1 so as to cover their infinite dimensional situation they do not carry out this argument nor do they provide any hints on what might be required to do so in 2006 in 30 harada holm jeffrey and mare proved infinite dimensional analogues with respect to the based loop group g example of atiyah 7 of the well known chapter 1 introduction 4 theorem 1 0 2 result in finite dimensional symplectic geometry before we can recall these specific results we need another definition the set alg the algebraic based loop group is the subset of the based loop group g consisting of loops which have a finite fourier series when g is identified with a group of matrices the main results of 30 that we are concerned with are theorem 1 0 5 any level set of the momentum map of the t s 1 action restricted to alg is connected for regular or singular values of the momentum map theorem 1 0 6 let be the momentum map for the t s 1 action on g the level set 1 c of the momentum map is connected provided that c is a regular value remark 1 0 7 the space g being a hilbert manifold in particular has a topology theorem 1 0 6 refers to the topology of g as a hilbert manifold the subset alg of g can also be equipped with a topology theorem 1 0 5 refers to the direct limit topology on alg we direct the reader to chapter 6 for further details remark 1 0 8 the extra hypothesis that c be a regular value of the momentum map in theorem 1 0 6 is needed so that morse theoretic arguments in infinite dimensions can be used in the proof in later years mare in 28 was able to eliminate the regular value hypothesis for the momentum map mare proved that the singular level sets of for the t s 1 action on g are connected his argument works for the space of c loops and also for the space of loops of sobolev class hs for any s 1 1 0 1 thesis outline the main results of this thesis are infinite dimensional analogues of well known con nectedness and convexity results in finite dimensional symplectic geometry namely we establish an analogue of theorem 1 0 1 and theorem 1 0 2 we prove chapter 1 introduction 5 theorem 5 4 4 connectivity theorem let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with mo mentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rn r h the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c see section 4 2 then the momentum mapping satisfies a the set c rn c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rn is residual theorem 5 4 5 convexity theorem letm be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points and suppose that m is closed suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rn rh the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then the momentum mapping satisfies b the image m is convex note that the palais smale compactness condition namely condition c see section 4 2 is an important hypothesis for our connectedness and convexity theorems theorems 5 4 4 5 4 5 condition c is a compactness condition on real valued functions of class c 1 defined on a riemannian manifold modelled upon a hilbert space it is needed in order to extend morse theory to our infinite dimensional setting let us now highlight the contents of each chapter in this thesis and where appropriate briefly explain how the respective material contributes to the main thesis results the convexity theorem 5 4 5 chapter 1 introduction 6 chapter 2 background and preliminaries provides a basic review of relevant known facts and definitions from the theory of differential topology throughout this thesis our manifold m will always be a hausdorff paracompact hilbert manifold modelled on a real separable hilbert space that is m is equipped with an equivalence class of smooth meaning c atlases such that all charts take values in an infinite dimensional separable real hilbert space the purpose of chapter 3 normal forms is to extend the existing theory on local normal forms for hamiltonian group actions to infinite dimensional banach manifolds more specifically we formalize the local linearization theorem for compact group actions on banach manifolds theorem 3 1 1 originally noted by weinstein without proof in 50 we also establish a symplectic version of this local linearization theorem theorem 3 1 2 in so doing we provide a g equivariant version of moser s argument lemma 3 2 3 suitable for our goal it is the symplectic version of the local linearization theo rem that is needed later in the thesis to help prove theorem 5 1 7 which is an infinite dimensional analogue of a lemma of atiyah 6 lemma 2 2 and guillemin and sternberg 17 theorem 5 3 chapter 4 connectedness the base case introduces the notion of what it means for a riemannian metric on a hilbert manifold m to be standard near each critical point of a smooth real valued function on m suppose that we are given a complete riemannian metric g on a hilbert manifold m and let f m r be a smooth function for g to be standard near each critical point p of f means that g coincides with some riemannian metric on m whose gradient vector field is standard near each p for a complete and precise definition see definition 4 1 6 and the subsequent remark 4 1 7 with this standard hypothesis on the riemannian metric we are able to provide an alternate proof of the known global un stable manifold theorem theorem 4 2 3 which tells us that the stable and unstable sets of p are in fact manifolds however the main feature of chapter 4 is the connected levels theorem theorem 4 3 5 chapter 1 introduction 7 theorem 4 3 5 connected levels let m be a connected hilbert manifold and let f m r be a morse function that is bounded from below and none of whose critical points have index or coindex equal to 1 suppose that there exists a complete riemannian metric on m such that f satisfies condition c then the level set f 1 c m is connected for every c in r this result is interesting in its own right its proof relies on morse theoretic arguments that follow from the fact that there exists a complete riemannian metric onm for which f satisfies the palais smale condition c and such that the negative gradient field of f is standard near each critical point of f notice that theorem 4 3 5 establishes the connectivity of all level sets of f the n 1 case of the connectivity theorem theorem 5 4 5 will follow from theorem 4 3 5 details of this n 1 claim are provided in the next chapter within the proof of theorem 5 4 5 chapter 5 convexity and connectedness defines one of the main ingredients in the connectivity and convexity theorems specifically the chapter begins by defining what is meant by an almost periodic rn action on a hilbert manifold m see definitions 5 1 1 and 5 1 2 the reader may think of an almost periodic rn action as a generalization of a torus action we prove that in the presence of an almost periodic rn action on m the set of singular values of the resulting momentum map is contained in a countable union of hyperplanes theorem 5 4 1 in particular the set of regular values of the momentum map is residual in rn then the chapter ends with the statement and proof of the thesis main results the connectivity theorem 5 4 4 and convexity theorem 5 4 5 following the method of atiyah 6 the connectivity theorem is established by induction on the dimension of the almost periodic rn action on m note that in the finite dimensional convexity result theorem 1 0 1 guillemin and sternberg prove convexity but not through connectedness see 17 they do not provide any results for connectedness atiyah proves convexity using connectedness see 6 but there is a gap in his argument for connectedness this occurs in his induction step where he claims that chapter 1 introduction 8 the connectedness of the regular level sets of the momentum map implies that all level sets of the momentum map are connected by continuity a nice example to illustrate the problem is provided below example 1 0 9 let h s 2 s 1 be the map that sends x 1 x 2 x 3 7 ei x 3 this map has exactly one singular value at x 3 1 all the regular level sets are connected they are circles but the singular level set above 1 namely 0 0 1 0 0 1 is disconnected see figure 1 1 figure 1 1 singular level set of h above 1 for example 1 0 9 this by continuity matter was resolved by lerman and tolman in 25 sections 4 and 5 lastly chapter 6 illustrates that the convexity theorem reproduces known infinite dimensional convexity results for a significant example see 30 7 namely it repro duces the connectivity and convexity results with regards to the based loop group chapter 2 background and preliminaries 9 chapter 2 background and preliminaries 10 this chapter consists of two parts we review a selection of well known results and some standard definitions from the theory of differentiable manifolds differential topology and point set topology as well we declare some notational conventions the material of these sections borrows from many sources we use lang 24 palais 34 and royden 40 for basic foundational results 2 1 function analytic preliminaries letm be a hausdorff paracompact hilbert manifold modelled on a real separable hilbert space h that is m is equipped with an equivalence class of c atlases such that all charts take values in a separable real hilbert space h recall that a smooth vector field say x on m is a smooth cross section of the tangent bundle tm i e a smooth map x m tm such that x id definition 2 1 1 let m be a hilbert manifold for each x m a strongly nondegenerate inner product gx on txm is a positive definite symmetric bilinear form gx txm txm r such that the norm x gx 1 2 defines the topology of txm moreover we require that gx determine a bounded invertible operator txm txm with bounded inverse for each point in m there exists a neighbourhood d m and a chart with target a hilbert space let be a chart in m having as target a hilbert space h such that the following holds for each x d we define the operator g x h h as follows identify txm with h by the hilbert space isomorphism d x 1 h txm then g x u v g d x 1 u d x 1 v for all u v h chapter 2 background and preliminaries 11 thus x 7 g x is a map from d to the space of positive definite symmetric bounded operators on h with the operator norm if we require the map x 7 g x to be smooth with respect to the operator topology it follows that x 7 g 1 x is also smooth then we call x 7 gx a smooth riemannian metric or smooth riemannian structure on m a strong riemannian manifold m g is a manifold m equipped with a smooth riemannian metric g note that we require a strong riemannian metric on m fix one such metric on m for each x m we will denote by x the inner product in the tangent space txm remark 2 1 2 note that the topology given by the smooth riemannian metric is the given topology of m see 34 pg 311 let f m r be a smooth function on m then df tm r the differential of f is a cross section of the cotangent bundle t m of m hence there is a uniquely determined vector field f m tm the gradient of f such that dfx v v f x x for all x m v txm the reader should note that f will play a central role throughout this thesis recall that a critical point of f is a point x m such that dfx txm r satisfies dfx 0 equivalently where fx vanishes throughout this thesis let us denote the set of critical points of f by crit f i e crit f x m dfx 0 if dfx 6 0 then the point x m is called a regular point of f let c r if the level set f 1 c consists only of regular points of f then c is a regular value of f if the level set f 1 c contains at least one critical point of f then we say that c is a critical value of f definition 2 1 3 at a critical point p of f there is a uniquely determined continuous bilinear form hp f tpm tpm r the hessian of f at p such that if is any chapter 2 background and preliminaries 12 chart around p hp f u v d 2 f 1 d p u d p v where d 2 is defined below remark 2 1 4 1 suppose that h is a continuously differentiable mapping of an open set w of a hilbert space e into r then dh is a continuous mapping of w into the hilbert space l e r if that mapping is differentiable at a point x w recall that h is twice differentiable at x and the derivative of dh at x is called the second derivative of h at x and written d 2 h x this is an element of l e l e r we make the canonical identification of l e l e r with the space l e e r of continuous bilinear mappings of e e into r we recall that this is done by identifying u l e l e r with the bilinear mapping s t u s t 2 note that the hessian quadratic form in definition 2 1 3 is independent of the choice of chart moreover hp f determines a bounded operator a tpm tpm by hp f u v au v p because hp f is symmetric the operator a is self adjoint in what follows we choose a smooth riemannian metric and then identify hp f with the operator a the interpretation will be clear from the context the critical point p is called strongly nondegenerate ifa is invertible with bounded inverse henceforth we assume that f has only nondegenerate critical points definition 2 1 5 let p crit f the index coindex of p is the index coindex of the hessian hp f i e the supremum of the dimensions of all linear spaces where hp f is negative positive definite we shall denote the index of p by indexp f and the coindex by coindexp f example 2 1 6 let h be a hilbert space and let h h be closed subspaces such that h h h let x x x h and let fh h r be a smooth function defined chapter 2 background and preliminaries 13 by fh x x 2 x 2 for p 0 crit fh we see that indexp fh dim h and coindexp f h dim h 2 2 two important theorems 2 2 1 baire category theorem definition 2 2 1 let m be a topological space a set e m is said to be nowhere dense if e i e e has empty interior notice that e is nowhere dense is equivalent to m e c ec that is to say that e is nowhere dense if and only if ec has dense interior theorem 2 2 2 baire category theorem let m be a complete metric space i if vn n 1 is a sequence of dense open sets then n 1 vn is dense in m ii if en n 1 is a sequence of nowhere dense sets then m 6 n 1 en definition 2 2 3 a subset e m is of first baire category or is meager if e n 1 en where each en is nowhere dense a set f is called residual if f c is of first baire category remark 2 2 4 the reader should think of first baire category as being the topological analogue of sets of measure zero so small and residual as being the topological analogue of sets of full measure so big let us collect some facts about residual sets and meager sets let m be a complete metric space chapter 2 background and preliminaries 14 1 a set f m is residual if and only if f contains a countable intersection of open dense sets indeed if f is residual then there exist nowhere dense sets en such that f c n 1 en n 1 en taking complements of this equation yields n 1 en c f i e f contains a set of the form n 1 vn where each vn en c is an open dense subset of m 2 a countable union of sets of first baire category is of first baire category 3 if a set is of first baire category then any subset of this set also is of first baire category 4 a countable intersection of residual sets is residual remark 2 2 5 the baire category theorem 2 2 2 may now be re stated as follows ifm is a complete metric space then i all residual sets are dense in m and ii m is not of first baire category 2 2 2 existence and uniqueness theorem for odes let m be an infinite dimensional hilbert manifold modelled on a real separable hilbert space h recall that given a smooth meaning c map f m rn a point x m is called a regular point of f if the linear map dfx txm tf x rn is surjective a point x m is called a singular point of f if it is not regular a point y rn is called a singular value of f if at least one point x f 1 y is a singular point of f and chapter 2 background and preliminaries 15 is called a regular value of f if every x f 1 y is a regular point of f i e y rn is called a regular value of f if it is not a singular value for f note that if f 1 y then y is considered to be a regular value of f because the definition of regular value is vacuously true by the implicit function theorem see 24 chapter 1 5 page 19 if x is a regular point of f and y f x then there is a neighbourhood ux m of x such that ux f 1 y is a smooth submanifold of m thus if y is a regular value of f then f 1 y is a smooth submanifold of m recall that if x is a smooth vector field on m then a solution curve for x is a smooth map of an open interval a b r into x such that t x t for all t a b if 0 a b and x 0 then we call x the initial condition of the solution the next theorem is commonly called the local existence and uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations or vector fields a detailed exposition of this fundamen tal theorem is presented in chapter iv of 24 or palais 34 2 theorem 2 2 6 local existence and uniqueness for ordinary differential equations let x be a smooth vector field on an open set o in a hilbert space h given x o there is a neighbourhood u of x included in o an 0 and a smooth map u h such that 1 if x u then the map x h defined by x t x t is a solution of x with initial condition x 2 if a b h is a solution curve of x with initial condition x u then t x t for all t a b proof see palais 34 2 or lang 24 chapter iv the next result is a consequence of theorem 2 2 6 for vector fields chapter 2 background and preliminaries 16 lemma 2 2 7 let m be a hilbert manifold and let x be a smooth vector field on m for each x m there exists a unique solution curve x of x with initial condition x such that every solution curve of x with initial condition x is a restriction of x proof see palais 34 6 the solution curve x above in lemma 2 2 7 is called the maximum solution curve of x with initial condition x define m 0 and m 0 by the requirement that the domain of x is x x the function and are called respectively the positive and negative escape time functions for x definition 2 2 8 let m be a hilbert manifold let d d x x t m r x t x and for each t r let dt dt x x m x t d define d m by x t x t and t dt m by t x x t the set t is called the maximum local one parameter group generated by x or the flow generated by x theorem 2 2 9 in the set up of definition 2 2 8 d is open in m r and d m is smooth for each t r the set dt is open in m and t is a smooth diffeomorphism of dt onto d t having t as its inverse if x dt and t x ds then x dt s and t s x s t x chapter 3 normal forms 17 chapter 3 normal forms 18 the purpose of this chapter is to extend the existing theory on local normal forms for hamiltonian group actions to infinite dimensional banach manifolds more specifically we formalize the local linearization theorem for compact group actions on banach man ifolds and establish a symplectic version of this local linearization theorem in so doing we provide a g equivariant version of moser s argument suitable for our goal 3 1 statements our initial result is similar to the finite dimensional local linearization theorem for com pact group actions found in 22 in fact in 50 weinstein notes without proof that the local linearization theorem holds for smooth actions of compact groups on banach manifolds following this lead and for the sake of completeness here we state and prove the following version of the local linearization theorem theorem 3 1 1 the local linearization theorem let a compact lie group g act on a real banach manifoldm and let m be a fixed point then there exists a g equivariant dif feomorphism f from an invariant neighbourhood of the origin in tmm onto an invariant neighbourhood of m in m we shall now review some relevant definitions and notions to be used in a symplectic version of the local linearization theorem theorem 3 1 2 in the process we will point out differences from the finite dimensional case when necessary to begin we wish to call attention to the fact that there exist various definitions of differential forms and other related such concepts for example see 23 chapter viii infinite dimensional differential geometry for our purposes it is enough to use the definitions found in 24 p 61 and p 124 that is if e is a real banach space and u an open chart of e then a differential form of degree r or simply an r form on u is an r multilinear and alternating in the last r variables smooth map u e e e let lra tu denote the bundle of r multilinear continuous alternating forms on u then chapter 3 normal forms 19 lra tu is equal to u lra e thus a differential form of degree r on u is a section of lra tu and is entirely determined by the projection on the second factor l r a e the usual definition of the exterior derivative and the proof of the poincare lemma apply without modification 24 next recall that on a vector space e a bilinear form e e r is said to be weakly nondegenerate if for every v e v w 0 w e v 0 3 1 now assume e is a banach space its dual e is the space of bounded linear functionals on e recall also that defines a linear map e e u 7 u so weak nondegeneracy means ker e e 0 this is e e is injective if this map is also surjective then is said to be strongly nondegenerate in what follows we require our symplectic form to be nondegenerate in the strong sense let m be a banach manifold endowed with a closed differential 2 form which at each m in m is strongly nondegenerate as a bilinear form on tmm said in other words tmm t mm is a linear homeomorphism notice that continuity of the inverse of this map is equivalent to the openness of tmm t mm which immediately follows from the open mapping theorem as tmm t mm is surjective here theorem 3 1 2 the local linearization theorem symplectic version let a compact lie group g act on a strongly symplectic banach manifold m let m be a fixed point then there exists a g equivariant symplectomorphism f from an invariant neighbourhood of the origin in tmm onto an invariant neighbourhood of m in m 3 2 proofs the proof of theorem 3 1 1 is obtained by analogy with the finite dimensional argument we begin with a simple lemma suppose g is a compact lie group and that g acts on a banach manifold m chapter 3 normal forms 20 lemma 3 2 1 let f be a diffeomorphism from an invariant neighbourhood of m in m onto a neighbourhood of the origin in a vector space v such that f m 0 suppose that g acts on v define the g average of f as f u g g gf g 1 u dg where dg is the normalized haar measure on g then the average f is g equivariant proof let u m be an invariant neighbourhood of m and let f u v be any diffeomorphism onto a neighbourhood of the origin in v to ensure the existence of such a diffeomorphism we use that there exists a chart near m and that every open neighbourhood of m contains an invariant open neighbourhood of m let f u v given by f u g g gf g 1 u dg be its average we want to show f h u h f u h g u u consider f h u g g gf g 1 h u dg by definition of f h g g h 1 gf g 1 h u dg h g g h 1 gf h 1 g 1 u dg h g g jf j 1 u dj where j h 1 g note dg is invariant under g 7 j h f u as wanted lemma 3 2 2 let f be a diffeomorphism from an invariant neighbourhood of m in m to a neighbourhood of the origin in v tmm with the isotropy action let f be its average suppose the derivative of f at m is the identity mapping on tmm then df m tmm tmm is the identity proof let u m be an invariant neighbourhood of m and let f u tmm be any diffeomorphism onto a neighbourhood of the origin in tmm chapter 3 normal forms 21 we have for all g g g u u and g tmm tmm by definition dg m g and dg 0 g because g is a linear map and dg is also linear so the average of f is f g g g f g 1 u dg therefore df m g g d g fg 1 m dg g g dg 0 df m dg 1 m dg by the chain rule g g g df m g 1 dg by the above choice of notation and since dg 0 g g g g g 1 dg because df m identity by assumption g g dg identity proof of theorem 3 1 1 let u m be an invariant neighbourhood of m let f u tmm be any smooth map such that df m tmm tmm is the identity mapping take any g g note g acts on both u and tmm g u u and g tmm tmm let dg m g and g 0 g consider g f g 1 u tmm by construction this map is also a diffeomorphism such that its derivative atm is the identity mapping on tmm the average f u tmm which is defined by f u g g g f g 1 u dg where dg is the invariant haar measure on g is a g equivariant diffeomorphism such that df m identitytmm by lemma 3 2 1 with v tmm and lemma 3 2 2 by the inverse function theorem for banach manifolds see 24 we can invert f on a neighbourhood of m to obtain the desired diffeomorphism f as required in the paper 50 darboux s theorem for banach manifolds is explained in 51 a chapter 3 normal forms 22 remark as to how to establish an equivariant version of the darboux weinstein theorem is made to help in the analysis in the proof of theorem 3 1 2 we will need an equivariant local version of moser s theorem toward this end and using similar techniques found in 50 and 51 we will employ the next lemma lemma 3 2 3 moser s theorem let m be a banach manifold with strongly symplectic forms 0 and 1 let m be in m assume 0 and 1 coincide on tmm then there exists a neighbourhood u of m and there exists a diffeomorphism from u to an open subset of m such that 1 0 u proof denote t 1 t 0 t 1 where 0 m and 1 by the poincare lemma 24 there exists a 1 form on u such that 1 0 d observe that we can arrange for tmm 0 we now look for a smooth time dependent vector field xt m m on a neighbourhood of m with xt m 0 and xt t the main idea is to determine a family of diffeomorphisms t maps u m with t t 0 u by representing them as the flow of a family of time dependent vector fields xt on a neighbourhood of m thus we suppose that d dt t xt t 0 id 3 2 so we know t t d dt t 0 for all t t d dt t lxt t 0 where lxt is the lie derivative of t along xt t d xt d t d xt t 0 by using cartan s formula and the choice of t d d xt t 0 since t is closed by assumption xt satisfies the linear over r equation d d xt t 0 d xt t 0 chapter 3 normal forms 23 this last identity will hold if xt t 0 3 3 observe that for all t t is strongly nondegenerate at m thus there exists a neighbourhood u of m such that for all t t is strongly nondegenerate on u let t xt where t tmm t mm m t mm recall that if s 7 as is a smooth family of invertible operators then the family a 1 s of inverses is smooth so xt t 1 is a smooth and also smooth in t time dependent vector field taking values in m so for any choice of 1 form equation 3 3 can always be solved for xt therefore reading this argument backwards we see that we can always find an xt that satisfies d dt t lxt t 0 hence by integrating xt 1 and shrinking u again if necessary there exists a family t of diffeomorphisms such that 3 2 holds from this we easily deduce t t 0 u and accordingly the required conditions are satisfied let 1 that is to say there exists an isotopy u 0 1 m q t 7 t q t maps u m and 0 id with t 0 for all t 0 1 proof of theorem 3 1 2 let u m be an invariant neighbourhood of m proceeding in the same manner as the proof of theorem 3 1 1 let f u tmm be any smooth map such that df m identitytmm the average u tmm given by u g g g f g 1 u dg where dg is the haar measure on g is smooth g equivariant c f lemma 3 2 1 and satisfies d m identitytmm c f lemma 3 2 2 given a symplectic form on m let 0 m and 1 these are g invariant symplectic forms on u m notice that 0 and 1 coincide on tmm becuase 1 see 24 chapters iv and v for explicit conditions that guarantee integrability of a vector field on a banach manifold chapter 3 normal forms 24 d m idtxm consider now the family t 1 t 0 t 1 of closed 2 forms on u we can assume that t is a symplectic form for all t 0 1 by shrinking u if necessary we want a g equivariant map t u tmm such that ddt t t 0 that is we need a local equivariant moser s theorem this map is obtained by lemma 3 2 3 applied to a neighbourhood of m with an additional restriction the g equivariance of the t provided in 3 2 3 can be achieved by restricting the choice of to g invariant all of the constructions can then be made equivariantly with respect to g therefore by the inverse function theorem 24 we invert on a neighbourhood of m to get the desired symplectomorphism f chapter 4 connectedness the base case 25 chapter 4 connectedness the base case 26 we begin this chapter by collecting some facts on morse theory and gradient flows which are relevant and needed to prove the main results of this chapter the connected levels theorem theorem 4 3 5 4 1 morse functions and their gradient flows lemma 4 1 1 let h be a hilbert space and let h h be closed subspaces such that h h h let fh h r be defined by f x x x 2 x 2 then the trajectory of fh starting at x x x h is given by t 7 e 2 tx e 2 tx proof note that e 2 tx e 2 tx t 0 x it is enough to show that d dt t 0 e 2 tx e 2 tx 2 x 2 x fh x recall that the gradient vector field fhon h is defined by the property that for all x h for all v h df x v fh x v so it is enough to show that for all x v h df x v 2 x 2 x v let x x x h and v v v h then df x v df x x v v dv x 2 dv x 2 because fh x x 2 x 2 d dt t 0 x tv 2 d dt t 0 x tv 2 d dt t 0 x 2 2 t x v t 2

manifold m is called a morse function if all of its critical points are strongly nondegenerate that is for every x crit f the operator 2 f x txm txm obtained from the hessian via the riemannian metric is a linear isomorphism remark 4 1 3 1 note that whether or not a function is morse is independent of a choice of riemannian metric 2 some references in the literature have weak nondegeneracy that is the hessian hp f induces only an injective map 2 f x txm txm i e ker 2 f x 0 in their definition of a morse function in morse theory the morse lemma introduces special coordinates around a critical point we recall this fundamental lemma now for hilbert manifolds lemma 4 1 4 the morse lemma let f m r be a smooth function and let p crit f suppose that p is strongly nondegenerate then there exists an open neigh bourhood b m of p and a chart b h around p with target a hilbert space h such that p 0 and f 1 v pv 2 i p v 2 on b where p is an orthogonal projection in h to a closed subspace i e pv h and i p v h where h h h proof see palais 34 page 307 remark 4 1 5 1 it is an immediate consequence of the morse lemma that a nonde generate critical point of a smooth function say f on a hilbert manifold is isolated in crit f in particular if f is a morse function then the set crit f is discrete chapter 4 connectedness the base case 28 2 note that weak nondegeneracy does not work in this setting in fact weakly non degenerate critical points need not be isolated in crit f for example let m 2 xk r k 1 xk 2 define f h r by f x k 1 cos kxk k 4 f is smooth then 0 crit f moreover 0 is weakly nondegenerate but any neighbourhood of 0 has infinitely many critical points see 48 pg 51 for details in the morse lemma 4 1 4 the coordinate chart is called a morse chart for the function f note that the index at p equals the dimension of the range of i p and the coindex of p equals the dimension of the range of p where p is the projection from lemma 4 1 4 34 pg 303 definition 4 1 6 let x be a vector field on a manifoldm the vector field x is said to be standard near a point p inm if there exists a chart up b 0 h where b 0 is a neighbourhood of 0 in h such that p 7 0 and there exists a decomposition h h h such that intertwines the vector field near p with the vector field on h whose value at the point x x is equal to 2 x 2 x remark 4 1 7 1 let m g be a riemannian manifold and let f be a smooth function on m if there exists a neighbourhood of a point p m and a morse chart near p which is also an isometry with respect to the metric on h then the gradient vector field gf of f is standard near p we will say that the riemannian metric is standard near each critical point p of f if the gradient vector field with respect to this metric is standard near each p 2 note that the flow generated by a smooth vector field which is standard near a point p is locally conjugate to the flow generated by its linearization suppose that we are given a complete riemannian metric g on a hilbert manifold m and let f m r be a smooth real valued function on m let us collect together some basic properties of gf the negative gradient of f with respect to g chapter 4 connectedness the base case 29 1 gf has the property that gf f p 0 if and only if p crit f m therefore crit f is the set of zeros of the real valued function gf 2 the flow of the vector field gf is a one parameter group of diffeomorphisms mt dt m for t r we require that m 0 id and d mt dt m gf mt m 3 the value of f decreases along any non constant flow line t 7 mt of gf we can easily see this by rolle s theorem from the following calculation d dt f mt df mt by def of df gf mt by def of gf gf gf by def of mt gf 2 0 with equality only if p crit f that is by rolle s theorem gf f is negative off the critical set of f next we establish that a morse chart that is also an isometry intertwines the negative gradient flow on the neighbourhood with the negative gradient flow on the vector space lemma 4 1 8 let m be a hilbert manifold and let f m r be a morse function let p crit f and let up m be a neighbourhood of p let h be a hilbert space and let h h be closed subspaces such that h h h let up h be an isometry such that up b b where b h are unit balls in h respectively assume that is a morse chart let mt be the gradient flow of f on m by lemma 4 1 1 the negative gradient flow of fh x x 2 x 2 on h is ht x x e 2 tx e 2 tx then for all t r and for any m up mt 1 up mt m ht m chapter 4 connectedness the base case 30 proof let t r let m up mt 1 up up mt 1 up mt h ht mt up up h we first show that intertwines the vector field gf on m with the vector field x 7 2 x 2 x on h that is we need to show that d m gf m x 7 2 x 2 x m consider d m tmup t m h note that t m h h and that tmup tmm because up is open so d m is a bijective linear map between tmm and h it follows that d m gf m h but recall is a morse chart and that fh x x x 2 x 2 by hypothesis hence d m gf m decomposes into a positive and negative part namely d m gf m 2 x 2 x since is an isometry it follows that d m gf m x 7 2 x 2 x m as wanted next we show that intertwines the flow mt on up m with the flow ht on b b h assume that t 0 the case t 0 is similar let 0 t m be a maximal trajectory for gf such that 0 t up note that 1 up is an interval 0 t up f b b fh x 2 x 2 yyss ss ss ss ss s r chapter 4 connectedness the base case 31 the diffeomorphism takes to a maximal trajectory say in b b for x 7 2 x 2 x b b since is a diffeomorphism between up and b b that is also an isometry we have that mt m up if and only if ht m b b for all t 0 t that is the entry and exit values of f with respect to the flow m up and fh with respect to the flow h b b are the same figure 4 1 intertwining gradient flows on m consider mt an arbitrary flow line of gf on m we know by definition chapter 4 connectedness the base case 32 that d dt mt m gf mt m so we have that d dt f mt m gf f m gf m 2 this implies that f mt m is monotonically decreasing in t i e f is decreasing along non constant flow lines of gf we define the entry time of mt on up as the point t inf 0 1 up then the entry point of mt on up is x t up m similarly we define the exit time of mt on up as the point t sup t 1 up then the exit point of mt on up is y t up m from these entry exit point definitions we see that f x f y since f is decreasing along mt on h recall again that by assumption is a diffeomorphism between up and its image up b b so d m is a bijective linear map between the sets vector fields on m and vector fields on h consequently all that remains is to consider ht the corresponding flow of gf on h recall that ht x x e 2 tx e 2 tx by lemma 4 1 1 suppose that b b 1 observe that ht meets b b at the point x x 1 x x also observe that ht meets b b at the point 1 x x x x we define the entry point respectively exit point of ht with b b as follows case 1 if both x and x are nonzero then the entry point is 1 x x x x and the exit point is x x 1 x x case 2 if x 0 but x 6 0 then ht x x 0 e 2 tx therefore for large t ht never meets b b that is ht never meets b b for t 0 the entry point is 0 1 x x and there is no exit point that is ht enters b b and converges to p 0 0 b b case 3 if x 0 but x 6 0 then ht x x e 2 tx 0 so for large t the entry point of ht is 1 x x 0 and there is no exit point because ht never meets b b that is ht enters b b and converges to p 0 0 i e ht never exits for t 0 ht never meets b b that is ht never meets b b chapter 4 connectedness the base case 33 case 4 if x x 0 0 then h t x x is constant for all t r ht will either never meet b b or it will enter at the point 1 x x x x and exit at the point x x 1 x x thus fh 0 at each entry point and fh 0 at each exit point for the flow on b b consequently f 0 at each entry point and f 0 at each exit point for the flow on up hence if any trajectory on m exits up it does not return it now follows from the local existence and uniqueness results for odes see lang 24 chapter iv that our result mt m ht m holds the last lemma shows us that near each critical point of f we can always modify a riemannian metric on m so that the negative gradient vector field of f is standard near each critical point of f stated more precisely lemma 4 1 9 let m be a hilbert manifold let f m r be a morse function let g be a riemannian metric on m for each p crit f let up be a neighbourhood of p then there exists a riemannian metric g on m such that i for all p crit f there is a neighbourhood vp of p in up such that g f is standard on vp ii g coincides with g outside of p crit f up remark 4 1 10 this lemma serves as motivation for lemma 4 3 3 in section 4 3 con nected levels which gives a direct proof of a stronger result proof we can shrink up such that the up are disjoint let p crit f by the morse lemma 4 1 4 there exists a neighbourhood bp up of p and a morse chart p bp h such that p p 0 and f 1 p v pv 2 i p v 2 on p bp let p h r be a bump function that is let p be a smooth function satisfying 0 p x 1 and p x 1 near 0 and chapter 4 connectedness the base case 34 supp p x p bp let m bp and x y tmbp then define the new metric g m x y 1 p m g m x y p m xm ym m if m up g m if m 6 p crit p up where m denotes the inner product coming from h by construction this new metric g satisfies properties i and ii as wanted 4 2 stable and unstable manifolds let us start this section by reviewing some known definitions and giving some important assumptions we will then state and prove the global un stable manifold theorem 4 2 3 lastly we finish this section by examining a couple of additional results pertaining to the stable manifold definition 4 2 1 let m be a hilbert manifold let f m r and let p crit f fix a metric g on m the stable set w s p of p is defined to be the set of all points x m such that the gf trajectory mt x starting at x is defined for all t in r and lim t mt x p that is w s p x m mt x is defined for all t r and lim t mt x p the unstable set w u p of p is defined to be the set of all points x m such that the gf trajectory mt x starting at x is defined for all t in r and lim t mt x p that is w u p x m mt x is defined for all t r and lim t mt x p in the rest of this section we assume that m is a complete riemannian hilbert man ifold see below and f m r is a morse function that is bounded from below and chapter 4 connectedness the base case 35 satisfies condition c by complete we mean that m is a complete metric space in the metric induced from the riemannian metric for the reader s convenience we recall how this metric on m is defined given x and y in m we define x y inf 1 0 t dt where the infimum is over all c 1 paths 0 1 m such that 0 x and 1 y just as in the finite dimensional case one shows that is a metric onm which is consistent with the manifold topology see palais 34 9 pg 311 we recall condition c of palais and smale for f condition c palais smale condition if xn m is any sequence in m for which f xn is bounded and for which df xn 0 then xn has a convergent subsequence xnk p remark 4 2 2 1 if m is finite dimensional and compact then for any choice of rie mannian metric form the completeness the boundedness below and the condition c assumptions are automatically satisfied note also that if m is finite dimen sional but not necessarily compact then condition c for a smooth real valued function is satisfied automatically for proper maps 2 condition c is a condition on f that for many purposes can replace the compact ness of the manifold as a rule in extending finite dimensional results in differential topology to infinite dimensions we transfer the compactness condition from the space m itself to the function on m the global un stable manifold theorem theorem 4 2 3 is an important result that tells us that the sets w s p and w u p are immersed submanifolds of m that have the same codimension as the stable and unstable subspaces respectively of the linearization of f at p the proof of theorem 4 2 3 is an adaptation of the proof presented in 32 chapter 1 1 7 chapter 4 connectedness the base case 36 lemma 4 2 3 the global un stable manifold theorem letm be a hilbert manifold let f m r be a morse function and let p crit f fix a riemannian metric on m such that the negative gradient vector field of f is standard near p then w s p is a connected submanifold of m of codimension equal to indexp f and w u p is a connected submanifold of m of codimension equal to coindexp f proof let p crit f and let u m be a neighbourhood of p let mt be the negative gradient flow of f on m the local stable set of p relative to u is defined as the set w sloc p x u mt x is defined for all t 0 mt x u t 0 and lim t mt x p x u ut x is defined for all t 0 and lim t ut x p where mu is the negative gradient flow of f on u letdut be the domain of definition of u t thenw s loc p may be equivalently expressed as the set x u x dut for all t 0 and lim t ut x p similarly the local unstable set of p relative to u is defined as the set w uloc p x u ut x is defined for all t 0 and lim t ut x p x u x dut for all t 0 and lim t ut x p note that w sloc p w s p and w uloc p w u p moreover w sloc p and w uloc p are both nonempty since they each contain p let h be a hilbert space and let h h be closed subspaces such that h h h we shall identify a neighbourhood of p with a neighbourhood of 0 in h let u h be a morse chart with properties is an isometry and u b b where b h are unit balls in h respectively chapter 4 connectedness the base case 37 note that we have h x h lim t ht x 0 h x h lim t ht x 0 where ht x x 2 x 2 m u f b b h h x 2 x 2 vv r it follows that wh s p wh s 0 h and w h u p wh u 0 h the proof of this lemma requires that step 1 we must show that w sloc p respectively w u loc p is a manifold step 2 we must extend the local results of step 1 to w s p respectively w u p step 1 we wish to show that the set w sloc p is a submanifold of u by lemma 4 1 8 recall that intertwines the flow on u m with the flow on b b h more precisely u b b is a diffeomorphism such that for all t r and for any m up mt 1 up we have that mt m ht m ht x x because m x x b b e 2 tx e 2 tx by lemma 4 1 1 thus it is sufficient to show that w h s loc p b 0 chapter 4 connectedness the base case 38 r u id r b b dt dht u b b w sloc p b 0 i oo note that w h s loc p wh s p moreover recall that wh s p h and that w h s loc p w h s p u therefore w h s loc p h b b b 0 as wanted by the properties of observe that w sloc p is connected therefore w sloc p is a connected submanifold of m which contains p with codimension indexp f step 2 by using mt the negative gradient flow of f on m we wish to extend the local results of step 1 to the global stable manifolds w s p and w u p fix an x m fix a time t r suppose that mt mt 1 u u dm t is a diffeomorphism chapter 4 connectedness the base case 39 dmt m t dm t m t oo mt 1 u m t u dm t note that the set mt 1 u m is open because mt is continuous to prove step 2 it is enough to show that w s p mt 1 u is a submanifold of m open mt 1 u m t open u dm t w s p mt 1 u m t w sloc p dm t we claim that q w s p mt 1 u if and only if mt q w sloc p it will follow from the claim that the image under m of w s p mt 1 u is equal to the submanifold w sloc p u dm t in other words the set w s p inherits the structure of a manifold from that of w sloc p by the set of maps m t therefore w s p is a connected submanifold of m which contains p with codimension indexp f proof of claim let q w s p mt 1 u then q w s p and q mt 1 u this implies respectively that mt q w s p and mt q u so mt q w s p u but w s p u w sloc p this follows from the fact that all entry values of f with respect to m are bigger than all exit values this fact appeared in the proof of lemma 4 1 8 chapter 4 connectedness the base case 40 let mt q w sloc p that is q m t w sloc p however m t w s loc p mt 1 w sloc p by theorem 2 2 9 m t 1 m t mt 1 w s p u w s p mt 1 u thus q w s p mt 1 u and completing the proof of the claim it follows that w s p is a submanifold of m the analogous results for w u p follows by giving all of the same arguments as above but by considering the vector field gf instead of gf remark 4 2 4 both a local un stable manifold theorem and a global un stable manifold theorem for banach manifolds exist in the literature 32 chapter 1 43 chapters 5 and 6 these references do not assume that the vector field is standard a point in the manifold let us briefly review what is known 1 known proofs of the local un stable manifold theorem are based on methods such as the graph transform method or the orbit space method a brief description of these methods is provided below for detailed information on the so called graph transform method see 43 1987 chapter 5 the hadamard approach this so called graph transform method to proving the local un stable manifold theorem uses what is known as a graph transform this method constructs the stable and unstable manifolds as graphs over the linearized stable and unstable spaces respec tively this method is more geometrical in nature than the next liapunov perron orbit space method for detailed information on the so called orbit space method see 32 chapter 1 the liapunov perron orbit space method is another approach used to prove the local un stable manifold theorem this method in the chapter 4 connectedness the base case 41 context of ordinary differential equations deals with the integral equation formulation of the ordinary differential equations and constructs the invariant manifolds as a fixed point of an operator that is derived from the integral equation of a function whose elements have the appropriate interpretations as stable and unstable manifolds 2 a complete proof for the global un stable manifold theorem is also given in 32 chapter 1 section 1 7 this proof identifies w s p and w u p as particular images of injective immersions of manifolds note again that all of the aforemen tioned results are established for banach manifolds in particular they are true for hilbert manifolds their proofs become simpler in the hilbert manifold setting for example if m is a hilbert manifold in the global un stable manifold theorem 32 then the regularity of the norm implies that w s p and w u p are actually images of the tangent space to w s p say esp and the tangent space to w u p say eup respectively where tpm e s p eup lemma 4 2 5 let m be a riemannian hilbert manifold and f m r a morse func tion let x be a regular point for f fix a riemannian metric on m such that for every critical point p of f the negative gradient vector field of f with respect to that riemannian metric is standard near p then there exists a neighbourhood ux of x in m such that ux f 1 f x is a manifold moreover let p crit f then after possibly shrinking ux the set ux f 1 f x w s p is a submanifold of ux f 1 f x with codimension equal to indexp f this submanifold either passes through x or is empty proof by the implicit function theorem we know that there exists a neighbourhood ux of x such that ux f 1 f x is a smooth manifold and that txf 1 f x ker df x txm r let p crit f if w s p x 6 then we claim that ux f 1 f x is transverse chapter 4 connectedness the base case 42 to w s p at x hence near x by the definition of transversality it suffices to find a v txw s such that dxf v 6 0 take v gfx the negative g gradient of f at x from transversality it follows that after possibly shrinking the neighbourhood ux the set ux f 1 f x w s p is a smooth submanifold of ux f 1 f x and that the codimension of ux f 1 f x w s p in ux f 1 f x is equal to the codimension of w s p in m this codimension is equal to indexp f recall that m is a connected riemannian hilbert manifold and f m r a morse function fix a riemannian metric onm such that f is bounded from below and satisfies condition c let pi i i be the set of critical points of index equal to 0 define m 0 i i w s pi thus m 0 is the disjoint union of the open stable manifolds with index zero lemma 4 2 6 let m be a complete connected riemannian manifold and f m r a morse function that is bounded from below fix a riemannian metric on m such that f satisfies condition c and that for every critical point p of f the negative gradient vector field of f with respect to the riemannian is standard near p suppose that none of the critical points of f have index equal to 1 then the complement of m 0 is a locally finite union of submanifolds of codimension at least two remark 4 2 7 recall that a collection of subsets of a topological space is said to be locally finite if each point in the space has a neighbourhood that intersects only finitely many of the sets in the collection proof from palais 34 we know that i prop 1 pg 314 if a b r then there is at most a finite number of critical points p of f that satisfy a f p b chapter 4 connectedness the base case 43 ii prop 3 pg 321 if t x is any maximal solution curve of gf starting at the point x then t x is defined for all t 0 and lim t t x exists and is a critical point of f note that for each c r the set x m f x c is open in m because f is continuous moreover each point x m is contained in at least one of these sets thus for all c r x m f x c m rm 0 by ii x m f x c p a w s p where a crit f such that indexp f 2 and f p c by i the union is finite but recall by lemma 4 2 3 we know that codim w s p indexp f which is greater than or equal to two therefore m rm 0 is a locally finite union of submanifolds with codimension at least two lemma 4 2 8 let m be a complete connected riemannian manifold and f m r a morse function that is bounded from below fix a riemannian metric on m such that f satisfies condition c and that for every critical point p of f the negative gradient vector field of f with respect to the riemannian is standard near p suppose that none of the critical points of f have index equal to 1 then m 0 is connected proof let m 0 be as in lemma 4 2 6 recall that m 0 i iw s pi where pi i i is the set of critical points of index equal to zero lemma 4 2 6 ensures that i 6 by hypothesis no critical points of f have index equal to 1 so m c 0 is a locally finite union of submanifolds of codimension at least 2 by lemma 4 2 6 this implies that m 0 is connected we give more details for each x m there exists a neighbourhood ux of x such that ux m 0 is path connected and dense in ux this can be established by using lemma 4 2 6 and the definition of a submanifold chapter 4 connectedness the base case 44 let p q m 0 p 6 q let 0 1 m be such that 0 p and 1 q choose uxi as above i 0 n 1 such that the collection of uxi cover the path and uxi uxi 1 6 for all i and p ux 0 q uxn figure 4 2 construction of a path which avoids m c 0 it follows that for all x uxi uxi 1 m 0 is nonempty let q 0 p qn q for each i 0 n 2 choose a point qi 1 uxi uxi 1 m 0 for each i 0 n 1 we may construct a path i 1 connecting qi to qi 1 in uxi m 0 we can do so because uxi m 0 is path connected now so as to finish concatenate the i 1 to construct a path 1 2 n notice that is a path between p and q which does not intersect m c 0 by construction that is is a path in m 0 hence the open set m 0 m is path connected and so also connected remark 4 2 9 1 in the set up of lemma 4 2 8 f attains its global minimum since the critical point set of f is discrete see 34 section 15 theorem 4 corollary 2 chapter 4 connectedness the base case 45 the following notation will from here on will be used throughout this thesis from remark 4 2 9 let p 0 crit f denote the unique critical point of f with index zero and let f p 0 c 0 denote the global minimum value of f on m 4 3 connected levels let us start with a couple of technical lemmas the first lemma provides a list of properties satisfied by a metric g whose gradient vector field gf is standard near a critical point p of f lemma 4 3 1 letm be a complete connected riemannian hilbert manifold and f m r a morse function that is bounded from below and satisfies condition c let m 0 be the open stable manifold with index zero suppose that for every critical point p of f not in m 0 the riemannian metric on m is standard near p suppose that none of the critical points of f have index equal to 1 then for each x m there exists a connected neighbourhood ux of x such that i ux m 0 is open connected and dense in ux and ii if x is a regular point of f then for all c r ux m 0 f 1 c is open connected and dense in ux f 1 c proof recall that m 0 w s p 0 where p 0 crit f is the unique critical point of index zero then m 0 is open and connected by lemma 4 2 3 let x m choose a connected neighbourhood ux of x for property i let e m c 0 observe that ux m 0 ux e the ux m 0 is open because m 0 is it follows that ux m 0 is open in ux also note that e is a locally finite union of submanifolds of m of codimension 2 or more by lemma 4 2 6 hence ux m 0 ux is connected and dense in ux for property ii let c r chapter 4 connectedness the base case 46 if x is a regular point of f then ux m 0 f 1 f x and f 1 f x ux are path connected by the implicit function theorem it follows that ux m 0 f 1 f x ux f 1 f x is open in the relative topology by lemma 4 2 5 we know that the set ux m 0 f 1 f x is a smooth submanifold of ux f 1 f x with codimension equal to indexp 0 f 2 then it follows that ux m 0 f 1 f x ux f 1 f x is connected and dense because its complement has codimension at least 2 let f be a morse function on a connected riemannian manifold m let d be the distance function coming from the riemannian metric g onm note that the set crit f has no accumulation points this follows by the morse lemma 4 1 4 applied to f for each point in m there exists a neighbourhood d m and a chart with target a hilbert space let be a chart inm having as target a hilbert space h for each x d let g x h h be an operator defined as in definition 2 1 1 then each g x is an invertible linear operator that is bounded with bounded inverse recall that by lemma 4 1 9 for each critical point p crit f there exists a neighbourhood up m of p on which there is a standard metric cf remark 4 1 7 gp for each x up

2 p 3 pj for each j 1 let upj be the open ball of radius rj about pj in the distance d where rj is chosen to be sufficiently small so that rj min rpj 1 2 j and upj is contained in the domain of gpj set u j 1 upj u j 1 upj and v m r u lemma 4 3 2 v is open proof suppose not then there exists a convergent sequence xm x such that x v and xm u for all m each set upj can contain only finitely many points from the sequence xm since otherwise the limit x would lie in upj for each m find jm such that xm upjm given n since xm x there exist infinitely many m such that d x xm 12 n in particular since only finitely many xm lie in any upj there exists m such that d x xm 1 2 n and jm n since xm upjm we have d xm pjm rjm 1 2 jm 1 2 n thus d x pjm d x xm d xm pjm 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 n however the existence for each n of an element of crit f whose distance to x is less than 1 n shows that x is an accumulation point of crit f contrary to the fact that crit f has no accumulation points therefore there is no such sequence xm x and so v is open chapter 4 connectedness the base case 48 given a connected riemannian hilbert manifold m g and a morse function f on m that satisfies condition c with respect to g the next technical lemma shows us that for each critical point p of f we can modify the metric g in a neighbourhood of p so that condition c continues to hold for f with respect to this new metric on this neighbourhood lemma 4 3 3 let m be a connected hilbert manifold let f m r be a morse function and let g be a complete riemannian metric on m such that f satisfies condition c then there exist neighbourhoods up of p for each p crit f such that the up are disjoint and there exists a riemannian metric gnew on m such that i gnew is standard ii gnew coincides with g outside of up iii gnew is complete and f satisfies condition c with respect to gnew proof choose neighbourhoods up so that lemma 4 3 2 applies by lemma 4 1 9 the existence of standard metrics 4 1 7 gp on neighbourhoods of p is guaranteed as in palais 34 lemma 2 pg 311 we use similar ingredients to show that for each p crit f we can shrink up such that there exist constants ap bp 0 such that 1 bp v gp v g ap v gp for all x up for all v txm for each p choose a bump function p m r for the neighbourhood up that is let p be a smooth function with 0 p x 1 and p x 1 near p and supp p x up for x m define a new metric by chapter 4 connectedness the base case 49 gnew x 1 p x g x ap p x gp x if x up g x if x 6 p crit f up then gnew satisfies i iii by construction note that gnew is a riemannian metric because v as defined in lemma 4 3 2 is open claim 4 3 4 gnew g proof if x up then 2 gnew x 1 p x 2 g x a 2 p p x 2 gp x p x 2 g x 1 p x 2 g x p x 2 g x 1 p x p x 2 g x 2 g x and if x lies outside up for every p then gnew x gx so gnew x g x to show gnew is complete let xm be a cauchy sequence in the distance function coming from gnew by claim 4 3 4 the sequence xm is also a cauchy sequence in the distance function coming from g since m d is a complete metric space there exists y m such that xm y in the distance function d recall that convergence with respect to one of these metrics implies convergence with respect to the other because the topology induced by these two metrics is the same see 2 1 2 to show f satisfies condition c with respect to gnew let xn m be a sequence for which f xn is bounded suppose that df xn 2 gnew df xn df xn gnew 0 chapter 4 connectedness the base case 50 we wish to show that xn has a subsequence which converges to a critical point by lemma 4 3 4 df xn 2 gnew df xn 2 g and so df xn 2 g 0 the fact that f satisfies condition c with respect to g gives a subsequence xnk of xn which converges to a critical point y say xnk y again recall the fact that convergence with respect to one of these metrics implies convergence with respect to the other because the topology induced by these two metrics is the same see 2 1 2 so xn has a convergent subsequence as desired end of proof of lemma 4 3 3 we are now prepared to prove the connectivity for each level set of f theorem 4 3 5 connected levels let m be a connected hilbert manifold and let f m r be a morse function that is bounded from below and none of whose critical points have index or coindex equal to 1 suppose that there exists a complete riemannian metric on m such that f satisfies condition c then the level set f 1 c m is connected for every c in r proof by the definition of a morse function each of the critical points of f is strongly nondegenerate by the morse lemma for hilbert manifolds 34 each critical point of f on m is isolated by lemma 4 3 3 there exists a complete riemannian metric call it g on m for which f satisfies condition c and such that gf is standard near each critical point consider the vector field gf recall that f has only one critical point of index zero say p 0 moreover f attains its global minimum value c 0 f p 0 on m see remark 4 2 9 also recall that palais see chapter 4 connectedness the base case 51 34 proposition 1 pg 314 proves that if a b r then there is at most a finite number of critical points p of f satisfying a f p b hence the critical values of f are isolated and there are at most a finite number of critical points of f below any critical level since f is bounded from below by assumption let c 0 c 1 c 2 be the critical values of f let c im f such that c c 0 case i for any regular point of f in f 1 c f 1 c is connected let e m c 0 note that by lemma 4 3 1 ii any regular point in f 1 c can be connected by a continuous path in f 1 c to a point that belongs tom 0 a totally descending point of f 1 c thus following the method of bryant 10 to prove the connectedness of f 1 c it suffices to show that any two totally descending points of f 1 c can be joined by a continuous path in f 1 c let us give more details suppose that x y f 1 c are regular points of f such that x 6 y then there exist neighbourhoods ux and uy of x and y respectively that satisfy the properties of lemma 4 3 1 ii so we can choose totally descending points say x and y in f 1 c which connect to x and y in f 1 c moreover by lemma 4 3 1 i and the morse lemma 4 1 4 there exists a controlled neighbourhood u 0 of p 0 m such that for all c the set u 0 f 1 c is connected and such that u 0 m 0 we pass to the normalized gradient flow note that by palais 34 there exists a time t r such that the normalized forward downward flow lines of x and y belong to u 0 the fact that the gradient flow lines are normalized means that their speed of de scent is one and therefore level sets map to level sets we make explicit use of this fact throughout this proof more precisely let t denote the downward normalized flow there are points x t x and y t y i e x lies on the forward normalized flow line of gf through chapter 4 connectedness the base case 52 x similarly y lies on the forward normalized downward flow line of gf through y such that f x f y c and x y u 0 f 1 c since u 0 f 1 c is path connected x and y may be connected by a continuous path in u 0 f 1 c recall that there are a finite number of critical points below any level in particular there are a finite number of critical points between c and c call these points p 1 pk moreover recall that for each i 1 i k w u pi m is a submanifold with codimension equal to indexpi f by lemma 4 2 3 in particular by lemma 4 2 5 each w u pi intersects the smooth part of f 1 c transversally in submanifolds of codimension at least 2 because the coindex of f cannot equal one for any critical point consequently we may choose a path 0 1 u 0 f 1 c with 0 x and 1 y such that it is transverse to each of the unstable manifolds w u pi 1 i k we can now use the gradient flow to move this path back up to the level of f 1 c recall that t denotes the downward normalized flow let t m 7 t m be defined on an open subset u r m define an open subset ut m m t m u m so by lang 24 chapter iv theorem 2 9 for all t the map t ut u t is a diffeomorphism with inverse t note that t restricts to a diffeomorphism ut f 1 c u t f 1 c with inverse the restriction of t when t c c it then follows that for t c c the set t is an open and dense subset of f 1 c this can be arranged because from palais it follows that f 1 c r u t f 1 c f 1 c p crit f such that c f p c w u p where c is a regular value of f now x and y can be joined by a path in f 1 c as desired this proves that x and y can be joined by a path in f 1 c therefore we may conclude that f 1 c is connected for every c r in this case case ii for any critical point of f in f 1 c f 1 c is connected we first prove that f 1 c 0 is connected recall that c 0 is the global minimum value chapter 4 connectedness the base case 53 figure 4 3 f 1 c connected for any c r chapter 4 connectedness the base case 54 of f see remark 4 0 35 f p 0 c 0 we know that indexp 0 f 0 by lemma 4 2 3 the stable manifold of p 0 w s p 0 m is connected hence f 1 c 0 w s p 0 must also be connected to see this suppose that f 1 c 0 is not connected i e f 1 c 0 u v such that u v 6 and u 6 v then w s p 0 w s u w s v with both w s u w s v nonempty and not equal to each other but this means that w s p 0 is not connected a contradiction therefore f 1 c 0 is connected next note that for every singluar point in m there exists a regular point of f in the same level set such that we can connect them through a path that lies entirely within the level set then we may connect any two regular points in this level of f as in case i so as to obtain that f 1 c is connected thus is it sufficient to show that a critical point can be connected to a regular point within the level let us provide more details suppose that x f 1 c is a singular point of f by the morse lemma 4 1 4 there exists a neighbourhood ux of x and a chart such that x 0 f h x x x 2 x 2 on ux and that h h h fix such a morse chart ux b 0 h where b 0 is a neighbourhood of 0 of x with the properties is an isometry ux b b where b h are unit balls in h respectively so b b fh 1 0 x x h x 2 x 2 observe that this is homeomorphic to a cone on s 1 s 1 where s 1 are unit spheres in h respec tively note that the set b b fh 1 0 collapses at the origin to give a cone over s 1 s 1 recall that the critical points of f are isolated if we start at the origin 0 0 then tx tx 0 t 1 is the path connecting 0 0 to a regular point say x in b b fh 1 0 this implies that we can connect x to a regular point of f say x in f 1 f x in m 0 f 1 f x as desired this proves that f 1 c is connected in this case chapter 4 connectedness the base case 55 figure 4 4 cone over s 1 s 1 taken as a whole we see that the proof is complete chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 56 chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 57 in this chapter we will state and prove the main results of this thesis 5 1 almost periodic rn actions and complex struc tures definition 5 1 1 an r action on a manifold m is said to be almost periodic if there exists a torus action s 1 n m and a one parameter subgroup r s 1 n such that the r action is the composition r s 1 n m definition 5 1 2 an rn action on a manifoldm is said to be almost periodic if there exists a torus action s 1 n m and a homomorphism rn s 1 n such that the rn action is the composition rn s 1 n m remark 5 1 3 let t be the closure of the image of the homomorphism rn s 1 n definition 5 1 4 in the notation of remark 5 1 3 we define the generated torus action on m to be t with its action on m from now let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points fix a rn such that the momentum map component m r has only nondegenerate critical points i e is a morse function recall that i the critical point set of every morse component is fixed by t the generated torus action on m and conversely ii if the set of critical points of a component of is fixed by t then that component is morse let x mt the fixed point set of the generated torus action by continuity mt mr n the fixed point set of the almost periodic rn action on m note that mr n only chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 58 depends on in what follows we will show that there exists a t invariant compatible complex structure on the symplectic vector space txm we will also establish that no critical points of m r have index or coindex equal to one lemma 5 1 5 let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn suppose that this rn action has isolated fixed points let t be the torus generated by the almost periodic rn action and let p mt there exists an compatible and t invariant complex structure j on tpm we establish lemma 5 1 5 in a manner similar to weinstein 52 lecture 2 pg 8 proof by averaging over the torus t we may choose a positive t invariant inner product on tpm observe that tpm is a strongly symplectic real vector space since it is equipped with a strongly symplectic nondegenerate 2 form since and are nondegenerate u tpm 7 u t pm v tpm 7 v t pm are isomorphisms between tpm and t pm hence can be represented by some linear skew adjoint operator a tpm tpm i e u v au v for u v tpm note that a is skew adjoint with respect to because atu v u av by definition of at av u since is symmetric v u by definition of a u v since is skew symmetric au v by definition of a we wish to find a t invariant and compatible complex structure j on tpm we claim that j aat 1 a has these properties chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 59 note that aat 1 is an operator on tpm that is positive definite and symmetric with respect to by the spectral theorem we can obtain an operator aat 1 such that aat 1 2 aat 1 moreover aat 1 commutes with every operator that commutes with aat 1 see 13 chap 4 prop 4 33 page 86 in particular since a commutes with aat 1 a 2 1 aat 1 comutes with a moreover aat 1 is symmetric and positive definite let j aat 1 2 a j is orthogonal with respect to because ju jv aat 12 au aat 12 av by definition of j au aat 1 av since aat 12 is symmetric au at 1 a 1 av au at 1 v u at at 1 v u v from a skew adjoint at a we can deduce that jt j at a aat 12 at aat 12 a j a aat 1 2 t j since aat t aat aat 1 2 a t j as a and aat 12 commute jt j hence j 2 j jt because jt j aat 12 a aat 1 2 a t aat 12 aat aat 12 since aat t aat chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 60 aat aat 12 aat 12 as aat and aat 12 commute aat aat 1 id that is j is a complex structure on tpm moreover j is t invariant because is and is and compatible because ju jv aju jv by definition of a jau jv since j and a commute au v since j is orthogonal u v by definition of a u ju au ju by definition of a jau j 2 u since j is orthogonal jau u since j 2 id aatu u using definition of j in terms of a aatu u 0 for u 6 0 therefore j is a t invariant and compatible complex structure on tpm as wanted remark 5 1 6 1 the factorization aat j a equivalently j aat 1 2 a as written in the proof is known as the polar decomposition of a 2 in general as indicated in the proof the positive inner product defined by u jv aatu v is different from u v 3 this construction of j is canonical after an initial choice of riemannian metric m chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 61 we are now ready to examine a morse component of the momentum map m rn the next lemma show us that no critical points of this component have index or coindex equal to one theorem 5 1 7 let m be a strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn fix a rn such that is a morse function then none of the critical points of have index or coindex equal to 1 remark 5 1 8 this lemma is the infinite dimensional analogue of a lemma in atiyah 6 lemma 2 2 and guillemin sternberg 17 theorem 5 3 proof of lemma 5 1 7 let t be the torus generated by the almost periodic rn action on m the critical points of are the fixed points of t i e crit mt let p mt and let h be a strongly symplectic real hilbert space on which m is modelled by an appropriate choice of charts we may identify tpm with h note that different charts induce on tpm different inner products but with the same topology we will show that we may choose symplectic coordinates which linearize the action in such coordinates looks like a quadratic note in particular that the eigenspaces of the hessian of at p are even dimensional the details are as follows step 1 existence of a t invariant metric on tpm fix some riemannian metric onm choose a t invariant inner product say on tpm observe that tpm is a strongly symplectic real vector space since it is equipped with a strongly nondegenerate 2 form then can be identified with some skew adjoint operator a tpm tpm such that u v au v step 2 obtain a t invariant compatible complex structure on tpm by theorem 5 1 5 there exists a t invariant and compatible complex structure j on tpm namely j aat 1 a chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 62 step 3 obtain a j invariant orthogonal decomposition of tpm given a complex structure j tpm becomes a complex vector space where the hermi tian inner product is t invariant we may now decompose tpm into irreducible complex representations according to the weights associated with the linear isotropy representa tion of t on tpm we obtain a j invariant orthogonal decomposition tpm t z such that 0 v t z such that 0 v where each v for 0 corresponds toa non trivial character of t while the vector spact v 0 tpm t and is fixed by t note that the summands in the above decomposition of tpm are orthogonal with respect to as well as with respect to the inner product step 4 is a quadratic for each z v we claim that z 12 z 2 meaning that the hessian h z z z z by compatibility to see this note that the s 1 action on v is generated by d dt t 0 eit z ieitz t 0 iz jz let x be the vector field associated to the linearized flow on tpm that satisfies x z jz now by the local linearization theorem 3 1 2 there is a g equivariant symplectomorphism say from an invariant neighbourhood of the origin in tpm onto an invariant neighbourhood of p m it follows that d z v z v chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 63 v jz jz v p z x v in other words the momentum map is given by z t z 1 2 z 2 in a coordinate system on tpm hence all of the eigenspaces of the hessian of at any p crit are even dimensional this proves that the critical points of have even index and coindex in particular indexp and coindexp are not equal to one as wanted corollary 5 1 9 let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic r action onm with momentum map m r suppose that the r action has isolated fixed points suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that either the map or m r is bounded from below and satisfies condition c then for every c r the level set 1 c is connected or empty remark 5 1 10 note that corollary 5 1 9 is a stronger version of the main convexity theorem theorem 5 4 5 where n 1 and h 0 proof of lemma 5 1 9 we have an almost periodic r action and thus t r and t r hence the momentum mapping m r is a smooth r valued function without loss of generality suppose that is bounded from below otherwise apply the below argument to since the critical points of are nondegenerate by assumption note that is a morse function by theorem 5 1 7 none of the critical points of have index or coindex equal to 1 therefore by theorem 4 3 5 the level set 1 c is connected for every c r chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 64 5 2 rational independence and consequences definition 5 2 1 a collection of real numbers 1 n is said to be rationally inde pendent over q if the only n tuple of integers s 1 sn such that s 1 1 sn n 0 is the trivial solution in which every si 0 example 5 2 2 rationally independent 3 8 1 2 rationally dependent definition 5 2 3 let t be an n dimensional torus choose a splitting of t then t rn and ker exp zn let rn we say that 1 n has rationally independent components if the numbers 1 n are rationally independent over q remark 5 2 4 definition 5 2 3 is independent of the choice of splitting observe that if definition 5 2 3 is satisfied with respect to one splitting of t then it is satisfied with respect to every splitting of t since they differ by a linear invertible map over q definition 5 2 5 suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m let t be the n dimensional generated torus action on m where n n we say that rn has rationaly independent components with respect to the almost periodic rn action if the image of in t rn has rationally independent components t rn exp rn linear map rrrrr 99 rrrrr t rn zn the following lemma 5 2 6 shows us that if the components of rn are rationally independent then the component of satisfies the two equivalent conditions i chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 65 and ii in section 5 1 i e that is morse and its critical point set is fixed by t this result will play an important role in establishing our convexity result theorem 5 4 5 for a generic set of regular values of the momentum map cf lemma 5 3 1 moreover this lemma will illustrate another consequence of the complex structure from the prior section 5 1 when we prove that the critical point set of these components of the momentum map are themselves symplectic submanifolds of m in our case these are just points lemma 5 2 6 let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn let t be the torus generated by the almost periodic rn action for every rn let m r where be the corresponding component of the momentum map if has rationally independent components then the critical set of is equal to the fixed point set mt and crit is a symplectic submanifold of m remark 5 2 7 this lemma 5 2 6 is the almost periodic rn action analogue of the well known torus action result 29 pg 186 let m be a compact connected symplectic manifold and tn be a torus action on m with momentum map m rn then for every rn with rationally independent components the critical set of the function h m r is fixed under the tn action moreover the critical set of h is a symplectic submanifold of m proof of lemma 5 2 6 let x y t rn note that kx kx k x k x for all k z so crit kx crit x let rn such that has rationally independent components recall that if 1 2 n has rationally independent components then we can choose a lattice chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 66 zn of t such that the closure of the one parameter subgroup exp sim s r is t u 1 n said another way the set of vectors sim k for all s r and k zn form a dense set in rn then since s k s r k zn rn we may conclude that crit t t crit t but for r valued momentum maps a critical point of the momentum map is the same as a fixed point of the action therefore crit t t crit t t t fix t where fix t are the fixed points mt where mt denotes the t fixed points in m as desired we can use this to prove that crit is a symplectic manifold since mt is a discrete set it is a symplectic submanifold it then follows that crit mt is a symplectic submanifold of m 5 3 good projections in this section we use the notation fix to denote the fixed point set of the rn action whose momentum map is the function lemma 5 3 1 let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn 1 action on m with momentum map m rn 1 suppose that the rn 1 action has isolated fixed points suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn 1 such that for all rn 1 rh the component m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then there exists a projection rn 1 rn satisfying chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 67 i the rn action generated by is almost periodic and has isolated fixed points and ii there exists a hyperplane h rn such that for all rnrh the component m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c proof we first prove lemma 5 3 1 in the special case of a torus action on m that is in the case when we have a periodic rn action on m this is in preparation to set up for the almost periodic case for property i let ari rn 1 be the set of elements whose members are rationally independent in rn 1 and denote its complement by ard rn 1 i e ard r n 1 rari v rn 1 s 1 sn 1 q not all zero such that sivi 0 v rn 1 w qn 1 r 0 such that v w 0 proposition 1 let rn 1 rn write ker p suppose that there exists ari such that p i e p 0 then fix mt proof we know that mt fix so we need to show that the opposite containment holds i e show fix mt choose as in the hypothesis let x fix then 0 d x d x so im d x ker but im d x by hypothesis that is d x 0 i e d x 0 hence x fix crit then we have that crit fix mt however the inclusion is an equality because crit mt since has rationally independent components by lemma 5 2 6 thus fix mt ending the proof of proposition 1 let s p rn 1 p ard p rn 1 a p q qn 1 r 0 with q a 0 chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 68 p rn 1 p q qn 1 r 0 q rn 1 by proposition 1 in order to show that there is a projection such that the periodic rn action generated by has isolated fixed points it suffices to show that the set s has measure zero the complement of s is the union of kernels p of desired projections so if s has measure zero then its complement must be nonempty proposition 2 the set s has measure zero in rn 1 proof to prove this we will require a preliminary result let h and hi i 1 be hyperplanes in rn 1 suppose that h i 1 hi then there exists an i n such that h hi to prove this first note that h i 1 h hi suppose for contradiction that for all i we have that h hi h if h hi 6 h then h hi has measure zero in h so if there is no hi with h hi h then h is a countable union of sets of measure zero in h which means that h itself has measure zero in h this is a contradiction thus h hi for some i and this ends the proof of the preliminary result it follows that s p p q qn 1 r 0 q q qn 1 r 0 p p q by the above claim q qn 1 r 0 p p q since p cannot be a proper subset of q this is a countable union of lines this completes the proof of proposition 2 chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 69 we now generalize the preceding arguments to establish the almost periodic rn 1 action on m case let i rn 1 rn be a linear map such that the composition rn 1 rn rn zn t has dense image in t t rn exp rn 1 rn i 99 rrrrrrrrrrrr t rn zn let a ri rn 1 be the set of rationally independent elements in rn 1 that is a ri rn 1 i rn has rationally independent components let a rd rn 1 denote its complement proposition 3 let rn 1 rn write ker p suppose that there exists a ri such that p i e p 0 then fix mt proof we know that mt fix so we need to show that the opposite containment holds choose as in the hypothesis let x fix then 0 d x d x so im d x ker but im d x by hypothesis that is d x 0 i e d x 0 hence x fix crit since is a real valued function but crit mt by lemma 5 2 6 because is rationally independent thus fix crit mt ending the proof of proposition 3 by proposition 3 in order to show that there is a projection such that the almost periodic rn action generated by has isolated fixed points it suffices to show that the set a rd has measure zero in r n 1 this is sufficient because if a rd has measure zero in rn 1 then its complement a ri must be nonempty chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 70 proposition 4 the complement of the set a ri rn 1 i rn has rationally independent components has measure zero in rn 1 proof let rn 1 denote its image i by i 1 n note that a rd r n 1 r a ri rn 1 c zn r 0 such that c nj 1 cj j 0 c znr 0 rn 1 c 0 is a countable union of hyperplanes in rn 1 hence the complement of a ri has measure zero in rn 1 to summarize what we have done proposition 3 shows us that to establish i it is sufficient to show that the set a rd rn 1 has measure zero in rn 1 then by proposition 4 we know that a rd has measure zero this completes the proof of i for ii let rn 1 rn be any projection such that rn 6 h in rn 1 where i rn rn 1 choose hyperplane h 1 h the pre image of h rn h rn observe that h has dimension n 1 let h c let then the component we claim that h c chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 71 mrn 1 77 r n 1 i rn 1 rn rn r this is clear from the above diagram together with the definition of h thus by hypothesis is bounded from below and satisfies condition c but we saw that therefore ii holds as wanted end of proof of lemma 5 3 1 5 4 the connectivity and convexity theorems the next theorem theorem 5 4 1 may be of independent interest we prove that in the presence of an almost periodic rn action on m the set of singular values of the resulting momentum map is contained in a countable union of hyperplanes in particular the set of regular values of the momentum map is residual in rn it is tempting to use the sard smale theorem 44 an infinite dimensional versions of sard s theorem but we cannot in the setting of this thesis the sard smale theorem requires that the map be fredholm theorem 5 4 1 let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points then the set of singular values of is contained in a countable union of hyperplanes in particular the set of regular values of is residual in rn remark 5 4 2 we will only use that the regular values of the momentum map are residual in rn for the purpose of this thesis proof let t be the n dimensional generated torus action on m and let h t be a connected subgroup with dim h 0 note that h must be a torus let x m chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 72 note that the critical points of are exactly those points whose stabilizer has positive dimension and a connected component of the set of points with a fixed stabilizer of positive dimension gets mapped into a proper affine subspace of t rn because m is second countable it is sufficient to show that each point in m has a neighbourhood in which at most countably many stabilizers occur recall that a linear representation of a compact abelian lie group decomposes into a direct sum in the hilbert space sense of subspaces on each of which the group acts through a homomorphism to s 1 and a strictly decreasing sequence of subgroups of a compact abelian group must be finite first the fixed point set of h denoted mh coincides with that of the closure of h by continuity so we can assume that h is closed consider a connected component n of mh and x n by the local linearization theorem 3 1 1 mh is a locally finite disjoint union of closed connected submanifolds it follows that crit subtori h t mh is a countable union let j rn t observe that stabrn x j 1 h where h stabt x then by definition of the momentum map critvalues subtorih t such that j 1 h rn anddim j 1 h 0 components n ofmh n countable union note that each n is contained in an affine subspace of rn of positive codimension it follows that the complement of the set critvalues is a countable intersection of residual sets and hence residual that is the regular values of are residual chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 73 we require one last ingredient for the proof of the convexity theorem theorem 5 4 5 namely we require a lemma which makes explicit the relationship between statements an and bn below we now state and prove this result lemma 5 4 3 for every n n consider the following two statements an let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action onm with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rn r h the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then the set c rn c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rn is residual bn let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action onm with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points and suppose that m is closed suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rn r h the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then the image m rn is convex suppose that an is true for all n then bn is true for all n proof note that b 1 trivially holds for an almost periodic r action the momentum mapping m r is continuous since m is connected it follows that m r is connected m is an interval but connectedness is convexity in r therefore b 1 is true chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 74 we want to show that bn 1 is true i e we want to show that given any two distinct points in m rn 1 then the line segment joining them is also in m this proof follows the method of mcduff and salamon 29 case 1 the regular value case choose an injective matrixa r n 1 n such that good projection at rn 1 rn satisfies conditions i and ii of lemma 5 3 1 and such that c rn is a regular value of the restricted momentum map and is in the residual set of values for which the re stricted momentum map is connected consider the restricted almost periodic rn action on m this action is hamiltonian with momentum map a a t m rn m a r n 1 at rn choose x 0 m such that it is in the c level set of a notice that x 1 a c at a x c at a x 0 therefore the set 1 a c can be written in the form 1 a c x m x x 0 ker at by assumption 1 a c is connected in fact path connected let x 1 1 a c be another point in the same level set if x 1 x 0 ker at then every convex combination of x 0 and x 1 is in m we provide the details let 0 1 1 a c with 0 x 0 1 x 1 be the path connecting x 0 and x 1 observe that dim ker at 1 because a is injective by hypothesis this implies that at is surjective then t x 0 ker at for each t 0 1 hence every convex combination of x 0 and x 1 must lie in m thus completing the proof of case 1 case 2 the general case let x 0 x 1 be distinct arbitrary points in m we claim that x 0 and x 1 can be approximated arbitrarily closely by points x 0 x 1 with the property that x 1 x 0 ker at for some injective matrix a r n 1 n such chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 75 figure 5 1 that at satisfies conditions i and ii of lemma 5 3 1 with a further perturbation we may assume that at x 0 is a regular value of a and is in the residual set of values for which the level set of a is connected by applying hypothesis an to a to see this first recall that the set of regular values of is residual in rn 1 by theorem 5 4 1 but a residual set in a complete metric space such as rn 1 is dense in rn 1 it follows that the set of regular values of is dense in m by a similar argument applied to a it can be established that the set of regular values of a is dense in a m note that our assumptions imply that this restricted almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map a satisfies conditions i and ii of lemma 5 3 1 in particular a has isolated fixed points moroever note that the intersection of the image of a with the residual set described in an is dense in the momentum image now by case 1 every convex combination of x 0 and x 1 lies in m then our convexity result follows since the image of is closed by taking limits as x 0 x 0 and x 1 x 1 we obtain that 1 t x 0 t x 1 m for all 0 t 1 taken as a whole the statement bn holds our main result is the following chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 76 theorem 5 4 4 connectivity theorem let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momen tum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rn r h the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then the momentum mapping satisfies a the set c rn c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rn is residual theorem 5 4 5 convexity theorem let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action onm with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points and suppose that m is closed suppose that there exists a complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rn rh the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then the momentum mapping satisfies b the image m is convex remark 5 4 6 the convexity theorem theorem 5 4 5 applies to finite dimensional con nected symplectic manifolds but eliminates the compactness assumption in the atiyah guillemin sternberg convexity theorem 1 0 1 we are ready to prove the main result of this thesis the connectivity theorem 5 4 4 proof of theorem 5 4 4 consider the statement an let m be a connected strongly symplectic hilbert manifold suppose that we have an almost periodic rn action on m with momentum map m rn suppose that the rn action has isolated fixed points suppose that there exists a chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 77 complete invariant riemannian metric on m such that there exists a hyperplane h of rn such that for all rnrh the map m r is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c then the set c rn c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rn is residual notice that an applies to all m and every on m by lemma 5 4 3 it is sufficient to prove statement an holds for all n n we proceed by induction on n base case in the case n 1 we have an almost periodic r action and thus t r and t r hence the momentum mapping m r is a smooth r valued function by corollary 5 1 9 1 c is connected for every c r i e the set c r 1 c is connected r then the base case a 1 holds because the set c r c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected is residual induction step let k n be arbitrary assume that ak is true for all possible almost periodic rk actions on m and let 1 2 k 1 be the components of a mo mentum mapping m rk 1 satisfying the hypothesis conditions of theorem 5 4 5 we want to show that ak 1 is true we have two cases to consider 1 is reducible and 2 is irreducible we say that is said to be irreducible if the 1 forms d 1 d 2 d n 1 are linearly independent i e 1 d 1 m v n 1 d n 1 m v 0 at all points m m and all vectors v tmm if and only if 1 n 1 0 we say that is reducible otherwise if is reducible then we are finished in this case there exists an i n 1 i k 1 such that d i is a linear combination of the other 1 forms so we can drop d i and apply chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 78 our inductive hypothesis thus by the induction hypothesis the set of c rk 1 such that c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected is residual in rk 1 let us assume that is irreducible by lemma 5 3 1 there exists a projection at rk 1 rk such that the restricted momentum map satisfies all of the properties i and ii in lemma 5 3 1 fix such a projection let g c rk c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rk m r k 1 rk notice that is the momentum map of a restricted almost periodic rk action on m note that there exists a basis of rk 1 so that drops the last coordinate without loss of generality we may assume this is the standard basis let c c 1 ck 1 rk 1 consider n 11 c 1 1 k ck suppose that c is a regular value of it follows that the subset n m is a submanifold of codimension k in m by the implicit function theorem and the 1 forms d i x 1 i k are linearly independent for all x n moreover suppose that c g then n is connected by the definition of g next let us consider the restricted function k 1 n n r proposition the function k 1 n is a morse function none of whose critical points have index or coindex equal to one in n step 1 we define a function m r and show that it has nondegenerate critical points of even index and coindex in m chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 79 note that given some 1 k rk and x i x k x rk then x k i 1 i i x recall that a point x n is a critical point of k 1 n if and only if there exist some constant 1 k rk such that d k 1 x v k i 1 id i x v 0 for all v txm therefore x is a critical point on m for the function m r where 1 k 1 rk 1 that is k 1 k i 1 i i notice that is a morse function because it has nondegenerate critical points since k 1 has nondegenerate critical points and k 1 and differ only by the constant k i 1 i i thus by lemma 5 1 7 we know that no critical points of have index coindex equal to one in m step 2 show that the restricted function n is a morse function let c crit m be the critical point set of let x n we wish to demonstrate that the manifold c intersects n transversally at x i e txm txc txn this means that the 1 forms d i x txm r 1 i k remain linearly independent when restricted to the subspace txc because this would show that the dual vector space to txn txc has the same codimension as txm since the d i x 1 i k vanish on txn thus it is sufficient to prove that d i x d k x remain linearly independent on txc to begin with observe that the vector fields xi x i given by d i xi for i 1 k must all lie tangent to c we have that 0 d i x chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 80 xi x xi x x xi x xi d xi thus is constant on the level curves of i but then the hamiltonian flow of i must preserve c therefore the hamiltonian vector fields xi are tangent to c thus xi x txc for i 1 k txc is a symplectic vector space c is a symplectic submanifold of m by lemma 5 2 6 because c is a fixed point set of a torus action therefore txc is a symplectic vector space this means that x is nondegenerate on txc so for all 1 k rk with not all i zero there exists a nonzero vector v txc such that 0 6 x k i 1 ixi x v k i 1 i xi x x v k i 1 id i x v hence d i x for i 1 k are linearly independent on txc therefore c is transverse to n now the fact that txm txn txc implies that txc txn from this notice that hx the hessian of at x is nondegenerate on txn txc because txm txc txn txc and so txn txn txc txn txc chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 81 in particular this means that the restricted function n n r is a morse func tion with critical point set c n step 3 show that the function k 1 n has no critical points of index or coindex equal to one in n observe that by lemma 5 1 7 the function n has critical points of even index and coindex since n has nondegenerate critical points by step 2 it then fol lows that k 1 n has nondegenerate critical points with even index and coindex because k 1 n only differs from by a constant namely the constant k i 1 ici by definition of this completes the proof of the proposition by the proposition and by theorem 4 3 5 the level set of k 1 n is connected for every ck 1 r i e k 1 n 1 ck 1 n is connected for all ck 1 r hence 1 c n 1 k 1 ck 1 is connected for all c 1 c so the level set 1 c is connected for all c 1 g but by the induction hypothesis the set g is residual in r k this implies that the set 1 g rk 1 is residual in rk 1 because 1 g is homeomorphic to g r let g c rk 1 c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rk 1 by the definition of g the result just proven and the definition of g the set 1 g regular values of g it follows that g is residual in r k 1 proof of theorem 5 4 5 this proof follows the method of atiyah 6 where n dim rn consider the statements an and bn of lemma 5 4 3 chapter 5 convexity and connectedness 82 then the statement image of is convex holds if and only if bn holds for all n note that an holds for all n by the connectedness theorem theorem 5 4 4 it follows that bn holds for all n by lemma 5 4 3 hence the image m is convex remark 5 4 7 the results of the connectivity theorem 5 4 4 and the convexity theorem 5 4 5 also apply to finite dimensions where the manifold is not required to be compact or where the map is not required to be proper remark 5 4 8 we wonder whether the assumptions of our connectedness theorem the orem 5 4 4 imply that the image of the momentum map is closed we do not know counterexamples moreover from palais we know that for real valued functions many consequences that follow from the image being closed are true remark 5 4 9 in light of the connectivity theorem 5 4 4 and the convexity theorem 5 4 5 directions for future research could include establishing connectivity of the level set 1 c for all regular values c of the momentum map establishing connectivity of the level set 1 c for all critical values c of the momentum map generalizing the connectivity and convexity theorems so as to apply to morse bott functions developing an infinite dimensional non abelian convexity result chapter 6 example the based loop group 83 chapter 6 example the based loop group 84 the purpose of this chapter is to provide examples of theorem 5 4 5 the convexity main theorem 6 1 example the based loop group the loop group let g be a compact connected and simply connected lie group fix a g invariant inner product on the lie algebra g the loop group which we denote by m 1 is defined as the set of maps s 1 g that are sobolev class h 1 recall that a map f s 1 g is said to be sobolev class h 1 if f is absolutely continuous and f 1 f l 2 s 1 g the spacem 1 h 1 s 1 g is an infinite dimensional hilbert manifold cf 34 section 13 and 37 section 3 it carries a left invariant riemannian metric called the h 1 metric the h 1 metric is uniquely determined by its restriction to the lie algebra of m 1 which is h 1 s 1 g the tangent space at the constant loop e that is if we fix an ad g invariant metric on g then the h 1 metric is determined by e 1 2 2 0 d 1 2 2 0 d for lie m 1 h 1 s 1 g the based loop group the subset g of m 1 consisting of those loops f s 1 g for which f 1 e is the identity element in g is called the based loop group notice that g is a closed submanifold ofm 1 whose lie algebra consists of those maps f s 1 g such that f 1 0 i e t f g h 1 s 1 g g moreover the h 1 metric defined on m 1 induces a complete metric on g which we will denote by see palais 34 section 13 theorem 6 so g is a connected riemannian hilbert manifold chapter 6 example the based loop group 85 it can be seen see 7 atiyah pressley section 2 that the formula 1 2 2 0 d where h 1 s 1 g defines a skew symmetric bilinear form on h 1 s 1 g moreover is strongly nondegenerate extending by left translations gives a left invariant closed 2 form on g cf 37 7 section 4 thus g is strongly symplectic group actions on g the rotation group s 1 acts on g by rotating the loop if g and ei s 1 0 2 then ei s s 1 let t be the maximal torus of g then t acts on g by conjugation if g and t t then t s t s t 1 note that these actions commute and they are hamiltonian 37 remark 6 1 1 the action t s 1 g is a special case of an almost periodic rn action on g the resulting t s 1 momentum map g lie t s 1 t r t r is given by p e with e f 1 4 2 0 f 1 f 2 d energy functional p f prt 1 2 2 0 f 1 f g d momentum functional where prt g t is the projection onto the lie algebra of t morse theory for the components of in this subsection we discuss the fact that a certain set of components of the momentum map g t r satisfy condition c with respect to the h 1 metric note that the image of the momentum map p e lies in t r which we can identify with its dual and with rn 1 r rn choose a hyperplane h rn such chapter 6 example the based loop group 86 that h x rn x 0 x 2 xn then observe that for each rn rh the component of the momentum map may be written as f x 1 e f n i 2 xipi f where x 1 6 0 and f g the fact that for each rn rh is bounded from one side and satisfies condition c follows from 30 proposition 2 9 whose proof relies on results of 46 connectedness of level sets let us briefly review what is known about the connectivity with regards to the based loop group recall that in 30 harada holm jeffrey and mare proved that any level set of the momentum map of the t s 1 action restricted to alg is connected for regular or singular values of the momentum map 1 0 5 note that the subset alg of g could be equipped with the subspace topology induced from the inclusion alg g however alg can also be equipped with a direct limit topology induced by the grassmannian model see 30 section 2 for the algebraic loop group it turns out that the direct limit topology on alg is the appropriate topology for theorem 1 0 5 harada holm jeffrey and mare also proved in 30 that any level set of the momentum map for the t s 1 action on g is connected provided that c is a regular value of with respect to the h 1 metric 1 0 6 in 28 mare proved that the level set of 1 c of the momentum map for the t s 1 action on g is connected for singular values of his argument works for the space of c loops and also for the space of loops of sobolev class hs for any s 1 in terms of the results for this thesis the connectivity theorem 5 4 4 establishes that in the presence of an almost periodic rn action on g with momentum map the set c rn c is a regular value of and 1 c is connected rn is residual chapter 6 example the based loop group 87 convexity let r t s 1 act on g as described above in the subsection group actions on g atiyah and pressley 7 showed in theorem
