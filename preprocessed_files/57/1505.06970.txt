a combinatorial proof of the homology cobordism classification of lens spaces margaret doig and stephan wehrli abstract it follows implicitly from recent work in heegaard floer theory that lens spaces are homology cobordant exactly when they are oriented homeomorphic we pro vide a new combinatorial proof using the heegaard floer d invariants which themselves may be defined combinatorially for lens spaces introduction an integer homology cobordism between two closed oriented 3 manifolds y 1 and y 2 is a compact oriented 4 manifold w whose boundary is w y 1 y 2 such that the inclusion maps induce isomorphisms hi y 1 z hi w z hi y 2 z for all homology groups homology cobordism gives an equivalence relation there are also corresponding definitions of rational homology cobordisms and spin c rational homology cobordisms the homology cobordism classification of the lens spaces was only recently completed in 1983 gilmer and livingston demonstrated that the lens spaces l p q for prime p are homology cobordant iff they are diffeomorphic gl 83 fintushel and stern extended this result in 1988 for odd p fs 87 nicolaescu proved in 2001 that the ozsva th szabo d invariant recovers reidemeister franz torsion nic 04 section 5 which in turn recovers homeomorphism type for lens spaces by results of brody and reidemeister bro 60 rei 35 technically nicolaescu showed the ozsva th szabo theta divisor recovers the sum of the casson walker invariant and reidemeister franz torsion but the casson walker invariant of a lens space is the sum of its d invariants by a result of rasmussen ras 04 lemma 2 2 and the theta divisor is the precursor of the d invariant os in 2011 greene showed that 2 bridge links are mutants iff their branched double covers recall all lens spaces are branched double covers of 2 bridge links are homeomorphic iff the covers h f are the same gre 13 but h f recovers reidemeister franz torsion by rustamov rus theorem 3 4 there are many known cobordism invariants including some from heegaard floer homol ogy ozsva th and szabo associated the d invariants to a manifold and spin c structure which is invariant under spin c rational homology cobordism and the d invariant function on the torsor of spin c structures is likewise invariant under rational or integral homology cobor dism os 03 theorem 1 2 we provide a combinatorial proof that two lens spaces l p q 1 and l p q 2 share the same d invariant function precisely when they are oriented homeo morphic since the d invariants are defined combinatorially for lens spaces this produces a proof of the homology cobordism classification of lens spaces which is entirely combinatorial modulo the proof that the d invariants are spin c homology cobordism invariants in fact there is a proof of this invariance for lens spaces which is combinatorial except for its use of donaldson s theorem gre 13 s wehrli was partially supported by nsf grant dms 1111680 1 ar x iv 1 50 5 06 97 0 v 1 m at h g t 2 6

about d invariants and spin c structures and their be havior under homology cobordism we also define a type of relative d invariant f s n which carries all the information we need about the d invariants next we show that if spinc l p q 1 and d l p q 1 are isomorphic to spinc l p q 2 and d l p q 2 in the category of torsors and functions then q 1 q 2 or q 1 q 2 1 mod p finally we derive a more explicit description of the d invariants modulo z in the special case where p is prime notation throughout this paper let a p denote a representative of the class in the interval 0 p let a p b mean a and b are equivalent modulo p let a denote the inverse of a if it exists so aa p 1 acknowledgements thank you to the many who influenced this paper including peter horn for instigating our investigation of homology cobordism adam levine for initially drawing our attention to equation 2 and josh greene for a helpful discussion of the nature of spinc y as a torsor d invariants and spin c structures heegaard floer homology assigns several flavors of invariants including hf and hf to a closed connected oriented 3 manifold and a choice of spin c structure using a heegaard decomposition of the manifold os 04 b os 04 a the generators come with a relative z grading a spin c cobordism w s from y 1 s y 1 to y 2 s y 2 produces a map f w s cf y 1 s y 1 cf y 2 s y 2 which induces a relative grading between generators for the two manifolds 1 gr f w s x gr x c 1 s 2 2 w 3 sign w 4 for an appropriate choice of spin c manifold including a rational homology sphere with its unique spin c structure this grading shift allows a lift of the relative z grading to an absolute q grading by fixing a canonical grading for s 3 with its unique spin c structure derived from this absolute grading is the correction term or d invariant d y the min imal grading of any non torsion element in hf y inherited from hf y os 03 it is invariant under spin c rational homology cobordism if w is a rational homology cobor dism then the right side of equation 1 is 0 for both w and w the d invariants as a function on a torsor over h 2 y h 1 y is also invariant under integral homology cobordism in the following fashion proposition 2 if y 1 and y 2 are integrally homology cobordant then spin c y 1 and d y 1 are isomorphic to spinc y 2 and d y 2 in the category of torsors and functions proof let w be the 4 manifold cobordism with w y 1 y 2 spinc yi is a torsor over h 2 yi h 1 yi and spinc w s a torsor over h 2 w h 2 w w the long exact sequence for the pair w w splits 0 h 2 w w r 1 r 2 h 1 y 1 h 1 y 2 h 1 w 0 a combinatorial proof of the homology cobordism classification of lens spaces 3 where ri is the restriction map to l p qi this short sequence induces isomorphisms h 1 y 1 r 1 h 2 w w r 2 h 1 y 2 which in turn induce the required torsor isomorphism spinc y 1 r 2 r 1 1 spinc y 2 there is a z 2 z conjugation action t 7 t on the spin c structures which fixes the spin structures the restrictions maps and so also this isomorphism respect it because it is invariant under spin c homology cobordism d y 1 r 1 t d y 2 r 2 t and the functions d yi are isomorphic the lens space l p q has a pointed heegaard diagram t 2 z with a single curve and curve and exactly p intersection points one in each of the p spin c structures for example the heegaard decomposition of l 5 2 looks like 0 1 2 3 4 z we have chosen the orientation on l p q so that the manifold is p q surgery on the unknot choose an identification of spinc l p q by labelling the intersection points 0 1 p 1 from left to right across the bottom of the diagram beginning with the 0 for the bottom right corner of the domain containing the basepoint z os 03 proposition 4 8 to see the difference of two spin c structures i j h 1 l p q under this identification observe the curve which is a generator of h 1 l p q and connects i to i q along the curve and i q to i along the curve so we say i q i any other i j gives a multiple of there is a combinatorial description of the d invariants of a lens space based on the grading shift in equation 1 derived in os 03 proposition 4 8 assuming 0 q p d l p q i 1 4 2 i p 1 p q 2 4 pq d l q p i derived from this recursive formula is a more direct formula for how the d invariants change under the action ll 08 corollary 5 2 2 d l p q i q d l p q i p 1 2 i p p the spin structures are exactly the integers among the following 3 q 1 2 and p q 1 2 this result may be deduced from equation 2 the conjugation action which fixes a spin structure s must identify s n and s n and d l p q i q d l p q i q implies p 1 2 i p p 1 2 i q p or 2 i p q 1 for alternative explanations cf ue 09 p 134 or 4 margaret doig and stephan wehrli ch 15 lemma 6 1 note that both numbers in 3 are axes of symmetry and both are integers when p is even but only one is an integer and so a spin structure when p is odd in the case of two homology cobordant lens spaces l p qi proposition 2 also implies d l p q 1 s 1 a d l p q 2 r 2 r 1 1 s 1 r 2 r 1 1 a d s 2 ua for any a h 1 l p q 1 where s 1 and s 2 are chosen spin structures which are restrictions of a common spin structure onw the last equality follows because r 2 r 1 1 is an isomorphism of z pz which means it is multiplication by some unit u z pz relative d invariants let p and q be coprime with p q 0 choose a spin structure s as in 3 if p is odd this choice is forced we renormalize the d invariants of l p q by defining a function f s z pz z using this choice of spin structure f s n pd l p q s nq pd l p q s lemma 3 the function f obeys f s 0 0 f s n 1 f s n p 1 2 s nq p f s n p n 2 q if l p q 1 and l p q 2 are homology cobordant by w and if f 1 and f 2 are the corresponding functions for some compatible choice of spin structure s 1 and s 2 which restrict the same spin structure on w f 2 s 2 n f 1 s 1 nu q 2 p u 2 q 1 for some unit u z pz a cobordism between two lens spaces tells us about the torsor structure defined above proof the first two equalities follow from equation 2 and the definitions of f and s the third equality holds because f s n 1 p f s n 2 n 1 q and f s 0 p 0 the fourth follows from proposition 2 assuming that the spin structures were chosen so that r 2 r 1 1 s 1 s 2 and the last equality follows from the third and fourth proof of theorem 1 we will now prove the main theorem proof of theorem 1 by lemma 3 there is a unit u such that q 1 q and q 2 p u 2 q there is also some choice of spin structures s 1 and s 2 which are restrictions of the same spin structure on w define g z pz z such that g m f 1 s 1 mq f 2 s 2 mu q which is well defined by the definitions of fi si m and lemma 3 apply the recursive equations for fi si n from lemma 3 to f 1 s 1 mq 1 and f 2 s 2 mu q 1 to see that g satisfies the relations g m q g m p 1 2 s 1 m p a combinatorial proof of the homology cobordism classification of lens spaces 5 and g m uq g m p 1 2 s 2 mu p since the above relations must hold for all m we can compute g m uq q in two ways as g m uq u or as g m u uq since the results must be the same we get 4 s 1 m p s 2 m q u p s 2 mu p s 1 m uq p now recall that x y p x p y p if x p p y p x p y p p if x p p y p equation 4 is therefore equivalent to the condition that 5 s 1 m p p uq p s 2 mu p p uq p for all m z pz by lemma 5 below condition 5 can only be satisfied for all m z pz if either u p 1 or uq p 1 that is either q 2 q 1 or q 1 q 2 p 1 note that we did not use any information in the above proof about the explicit forms the si take merely the fact that there exist s 1 and s 2 which are restrictions of some spin structure on w in particular the parity of p is irrelevant we now address two technical lemmata required for the proof above lemma 4 let h 0 1 p 1 0 1 p 1 be a function such that h i p h 0 in if h i c i c where 2 c p 2 then h i i or h i c 1 i a few experiments will quickly convince the reader that this lemma should be true for the sake of completeness we prove proof choose p 2 n p 2 assume for the moment that c p 2 if n 1 then h 0 0 and h i i if n 1 then h 0 c 1 and h i c i 1 for any other n there will eventually be an i c with h i c for example for n 2 take i 0 c h 0 n 1 note that 0 i 0 c since c 2 and 0 h 0 ni 0 h 0 n c h 0 n 1 c n p so we may remove the p in the definition of h i 0 h i 0 h 0 ni 0 h 0 n c h 0 n c as desired similarly for n 2 take i 0 h 0 n 1 6 margaret doig and stephan wehrli now p h 0 ni 0 0 so h i 0 h 0 ni 0 p h 0 n h 0 n 1 p p n p 2 c it is easy to adjust the above proof to accommodate c p 2 the key is that some at least two and at most p 2 adjacent values of i map to the same number of adjacent values of h i the following are equivalent h i c i c 0 h i c 1 0 i c 1 p c h i p c p 1 p c i p c p 1 p c h i p c p c p 1 p c i p 1 h i c c p c i p c and h i h i c c also obeys the rule h i p h 0 in lemma 5 let f m x my p f m x my p with y and y units modulo p if f m c f m c for some 2 c p 2 then y y proof rescale m by precomposing f and f with m i i x y then h i f m i i p and h i f m i x xy y i y y p the lemma statement is equivalent to h i c h i c which is equivalent to h i c i c note that h i p h 0 in and apply lemma 4 if h i i then y y 1 or y y and x xy y 0 or x x if h i c 1 i then h 0 c 1 p x xy y and h c 1 0 p x xy y c 1 y y p c 1 c 1 y y so y p y and x p x c 1 a combinatorial proof of the homology cobordism classification of lens spaces 7 if p is prime in the special case where p is a prime we have a more precise description of the d invariants modulo z consider the reduction of f modulo p f s z pz z pz we denote by s l p q z pz the image of f theorem 6 let p be prime number and q coprime to p a if q is a quadratic residue modulo p then s l p q a z pz a is a square in z pz b if q is a quadratic non residue modulo p then s l p q a z pz a is not a square in z pz 0 in the residue case a more explicit description of the d invariants is possible corollary 7 let p be an odd prime number and q a residue coprime to p a there is only one n such that f s n 0 namely n 0 b for every a s l p q 0 there are exactly two n such that f s n a c s l p q contains exactly p 1 2 elements proof of theorem 6 since f s n p n 2 q s l p q a z pz a satisfies a p n 2 q for some n if a 0 then n 0 let m p denote the legendre symbol of m and p defined by m p 1 if m is a quadratic residue modulo p 1 if m is a quadratic non residue modulo p 0 if m is zero modulo p assume a 6 0 then the condition a p n 2 q can be written as aq p n 2 or aq p 1 since the legendre symbol is multiplicative in the first argument we can write the condition as a p q p 1 and multiplying both sides by q p we get a p q p where we have used that q p q p qq p 1 p 1 we can thus write s l p q as s l p q a z pz a 0 or ap qp 8 margaret doig and stephan wehrli proof of corollary 7 if p is prime z pz x is a unique factorization domain if p 6 2 this means every equation n 2 p aq with a 6 0 has exactly two solutions part c follows because the total number of d invariants counted with multiplicities is equal to p note that s l 2 1 z 2 z so b and c are false for p 2 references bro 60 e j brody the topological classification of
