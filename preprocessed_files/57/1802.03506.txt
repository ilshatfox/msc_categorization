graph that is cellularly em bedded on an orientable surface in this work we count the number of equivalence classes of such colorings under two relations reversing colors around a face and reversing colors around a vertex in the case of the plane this is well studied but for other surfaces the computation is more subtle while this question can be stated purely graph theoretically it has interesting applications in knot theory 1 introduction consider the following game for a connected finite graph cellularly embedded i e every face is a disk on a compact orientable surface given a coloring of the edges by two colors a finite number of two kinds of moves are allowed 1 reverse the colors of all the edges connected to some vertex and 2 reverse the colors of all the edges bounding some face the goal is to find the number of equivalence classes of colorings under these moves this problem arises in the context of knot theory given a checkerboard coloring of a link diagram lying on the sphere or more generally on a compact orientable surface a checkerboard graph of the diagram has a natural edge coloring coming from crossing data our moves on this graph correspond exactly to region crossing changes which reverse all crossings bordering some black or white region of the diagram recent work of ayaka shimizu shi 14 shows that every knot diagram on a sphere can be transformed to one of the unknot by a sequence of region crossing changes this is proven directly on the level of knot diagrams cheng zhiyun and gao hongzhu cg 12 investigate region crossing changes for links of two components using graph theory and linear algebra cheng zhiyun che 13 extends this work to links of n components giving necessary and sufficient linking number conditions for a link to lie in the same equivalence class as the unlink every graph cellularly embedded on the sphere is the checkerboard graph of a knot or link so the results of shimizu and cheng gao answer our question in the genus zero case however we will show that it also follows from previously known results the number of equivalence classes is given by the absolute value t 1 1 of the tutte polynomial t x y at x y 1 1 rr 78 when a graph arises as a checkerboard graph of a diagram of a link l the absolute value t 1 1 equals the absolute value of the jones polynomial of l at 1 the number of equivalence classes is given by

1 graph with four vertices and nine edges on a torus number of components of l moreover representatives for the equivalence classes can be read off from l for graphs on orientable surfaces of higher genus one might hope that the equivalence classes are counted by the generalization of the tutte polynomial to graphs on surfaces the bolloba s riordan tutte brt polynomial br 01 dfk 08 we will show the brt polynomial does indeed count the components of a link on a surface however it turns out that the problem of counting equivalence classes does not just depend on the genus of the surface and an evaluation of the brt polynomial of the graph instead the number of equivalence classes can be computed by finding the kernel of a certain map on homology we start with a motivating example of a graph embedded on a torus in section 2 section 3 looks at the connection between graphs and links defining a subspace of the intersection of the cycle space of the graph and its dual whose dimension is measured by the bolloba s riordan tutte polynomial in section 4 we discuss the game for plane graphs and section 5 covers the case for graphs on orientable compact surfaces of arbitrary genus we have given an intuitive description of the two moves of the game in this introduction the precise description of the moves given in the statement of theorem 4 1 is slightly more complicated in order to allow for possible loops and bridges in g note that zaslavsky zas 12 investigates a related problem for signed graphs called switching equivalence in which only one of our two moves is allowed 1 1 acknowledgement we are grateful to adam lowrance allison henrich neal stoltz fus and sergei chmutov for numerous discussions and suggestions and to dan silver for introducing us to the bicycle space 2 example we discuss the mathematics of the game in an example figure 1 shows a graph g v e with four vertices and eight edges embedded on a plane model of a torus the torus equivalence of edge bicolored graphs on surfaces 3 is obtained by identifying the top with the bottom dotted edge of the square and the left with the right dotted edge we translate the game into a problem of determining the dimension of a vector space over gf 2 z 2 z the field with two elements 0 and 1 we fix an ordering of the edges of g and hence g and use it implicitly assigning say 0 to the color blue and 1 to the color red we see that bicolorings of g are in bijection with vectors in gf 2 e given some coloring vector w gf 2 e switching colors around a vertex of g corresponds to adding a row of the incidence matrix of g to w the row vectors of the incidence matrix form a subspace u of gf 2 e of dimension v 1 see e g gr 01 lemma 14 15 1 this subspace u is called the cocycle space or cut space of g for our example graph g in figure 1 the incidence matrix i over gf 2 is i 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 since the graph has v 4 vertices the rank over gf 2 is v 1 3 any row is linearly dependent on the other rows so the cocycle space u is the subspace of gf 2 9 generated by the first three rows of i the graph has five regions in its embedding thus the dual graph g v e has five vertices the incidence matrix of the dual graph in this case is i 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 the edges in e and e are in 1 1 correspondence and thus e e here and throughout our discussion we pick the same ordering on e and e and use this when considering rows of both i and i as vectors in gf 2 e adding rows of i to a coloring vector corresponds to switching colors around faces of the graph since the dual graph has five vertices its cocycle space u is 4 dimensional any vertex and face in g are incident to either two or zero common edges this means u is orthogonal to u and thus u u the subspace u gf 2 e is called the cycle space or flow space of g the dimensions of the cycle and cocycle spaces are related e g gr 01 by the formula dimu dimu e the intersection u u is called the bicycle space of g its dimension b is given by the tutte polynomial at 1 1 rr 78 tg 1 1 2 b we give a formula for the tutte polynomial via a specialization of the bolloba s riordan tutte polynomial in the next section 4 o t dasbach and h m russell for our problem we are interested in the dimension of gf 2 9 u u since dim u u dimu dimu dimu u we need to determine the dimension of u u we know that u u and thus the space u u is a subspace of the bicycle space for our example in figure 1 the dimension of u u turns out to be 6 and hence the dimension of u u is 1 since the codimension of u u in gf 2 9 is 3 there are 23 different equivalence classes for our game the construction can be interpreted within the setting of the balanced overlaid tait bot graph e g cdr 14 mnr 17 for the graph g and its dual graph g chose a vertex v 0 in g and an adjacent vertex v 0 in g let i and i be the incidence matrices of graph g and its dual over gf 2 in the matrices we remove a row corresponding to v 0 in g and to v 0 in g we form a new matrix a by combining the rows of i and i excluding the two removed rows this matrix can be interpreted in a different way if we lay g and g on top of each other by inserting a new vertex for every intersection of an edge in g with the corresponding edge in g this forms the bot graph we remove v 0 and v 0 and all of its adjacent edges by construction we obtain a tripartite graph figure 2 gives an example the matrix a describes the adjacencies of vertices in the bot graph among the bipartition of the vertices figure 2 graph g its dual graph and the overlay graph with two vertices and their adjacent edges removed 3 the components of the medial graph of a graph on a surface consider a link projection on an orientable surface such that all faces of the projection are disks and one can color the faces of the projection with black and white in a checkerboard fashion two dual checkerboard graphs gb and gw that are embedded on the surface are constructed as follows the vertices ofgb resp gw correspond to the faces colored in black resp white and two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding faces are adjacent to a common crossing of the link projection 1 b b ww b b equivalence of edge bicolored graphs on surfaces 5 neither gb nor gw can be used to recover the original link diagram since crossing changes do not change the two checkerboard graphs however for any graph g with a cellular embedding on a surface one can construct a unique alternating link diagram dl such that g is one of the checkerboard graphs by reversing the arrow in 1 the link l is called a medial link of g and its underlying 4 valent graph is called the medial graph of g since the medial graph comes from flattening a link diagram it can be viewed as a collection of closed curves on the surface in this sense the number of components of the medial graph is well defined figure 3 gives an example where the number of components is 3 figure 3 a graph g and the alternating diagram dl of a link with three components 3 1 the bolloba s riordan tutte polynomial recall that for a graph which is cellu larly embedded on the sphere the tutte polynomial counts the number of components of the medial graph and this data provides an easy way to count equivalence classes in our game for graphs on spheres our goal in this subsection is to show the bolloba s riordan tutte brt polynomial br 01 for graphs with a cellular embedding on an orientable surface counts the number of components in the medial graph we will later show that the number of equivalence classes in our game on arbitrary surfaces unfortunately does not have a simple dependency on this count we begin with a definition of the brt polynomial let v g e g f g and k g be the number of vertices edges faces and connected components of a graph embedded on a surface the nullity n g is n g e g v g k g and the genus g g is g g 2 k g v g e g f g 2 the brt polynomial brtg x y z is defined as brtg x y z h g xk h k g yn h zg h here the sum is over all spanning subgraphs of g we slightly departed from the original definition by changing the variable from x to x 1 the relation to the tutte polynomial is given br 01 by brtg x 1 y 1 1 tg x y chmutov and pak cp 07 showed that the kauffman bracket of an alternating virtual link can be interpreted as an evaluation of the brt polynomial in dfk 08 it is shown that the jones polynomial of an arbitrary link can be seen as an evaluation of the brt 6 o t dasbach and h m russell polynomial of a graph embedded on a surface that can be constructed from a plane diagram of the link we will use those relations between link diagrams and the brt polynomial below for plane graphs it is known that the tutte polynomial determines the number of com ponents of the medial graph e g gr 01 for a graph on an arbitrary orientable surface we need the extension to the brt polynomial theorem 3 1 consider brtg x y z for a graph embedded on an orientable surface construct the link diagram dl on the surface with checkerboard graph g by reversing the arrow in 1 then the number of components c of dl is counted by the brt polynomial as brtg 2 2 1 4 2 c 1 proof as in cp 07 dfk 08 dfk 10 we consider the specialization of the brt polyno mial given by x y z a 4 1 1 a 4 1 a 2 a 2 2 recall the slight change of variables from x to x 1 from the original definition of the brt polynomial this defines a laurent polynomial dl in a and a 1 by a e g dl a 2 2 v g brtg a 4 1 1 a 4 1 a 2 a 2 2 thus dl h g ae g 2 e h a 2 a 2 f h 1 locally with respect to the link diagram dl the laurent polynomial dl has the fol lowing property cp 07 2 a a 1 and 1 we are interested in its value at a 1 we will show that if l has c components then dl a 1 1 2 c 1 where is the number of crossings in the diagram dl in particular this holds for a diagram of the unknot without crossings by induction on the number of crossings if the two strands in the link diagram on the left hand side of equation 2 are on two different components of the link then the two links on the right hand side have one component less and we verify 1 2 c 1 1 1 2 c 2 2 c 2 if the two strands on the left hand side of equation 2 are on the same component of the link then one of the links on the right handside has one component more while the other one has the same number of components this verifies 1 2 c 1 1 1 2 c 1 2 c equivalence of edge bicolored graphs on surfaces 7 3 2 example the graph on the torus in figure 1 has brt polynomial va 06 brtg x y z x 3 4 x 2 y 9 x 2 6 xy 2 36 xy 32 x 2 y 4 16 y 3 60 y 2 112 y 48 2 xy 3 8 xy 2 y 6 9 y 5 34 y 4 68 y 3 64 y 2 z we have brtg 2 2 1 4 4 therefore by theorem 3 1 the medial graph has 3 components 3 3 components of the medial graph as cycles each cycle in g or g corresponds to a unique vector in gf 2 e given such a cycle the associated vector has a 1 in the position of each edge occurring an odd number of times in the cycle and zeroes elsewhere similarly each subset of e or e will be identified with the vector in gf 2 e having a 1 in the position of an edge if and only if it is present in the subset using these two constructions we conflate the notions of cycles in g and g and subsets of e and e with their corresponding vectors in gf 2 e let k 1 kc be the components of the medial graph for g since the medial graph of a graph g equals the medial graph of its dual g the edges intersected when tracing along a component ki of the medial graph form a cycle vi in both g and g note that an edge could be intersected by a component twice and in that case the edge would appear twice in the cycle and thus would have a 0 in that edge s entry of vi gf 2 e then for i 1 c we conclude vi u u where u is the cycle space of g and u is the cycle space of g the following is a straightforward generalization from results for plane graphs see section 17 3 of gr 01 lemma 3 2 let g v e be a connected graph embedded on an oriented surface let k 1 kc be the components of the medial graph with vectors v 1 vc as above then i each edge of g occurs in an even number of the vectors vi and no proper subset of the set v 1 vc covers every edge in g an even number of times ii each vector is the sum of all of the other vectors iii the subspace p of gf 2 e generated by v 1 vc has dimension c 1 4 plane graphs the linear algebra discussed in the previous sections is particularly nice for graphs em bedded on spheres i e plane graphs since every cycle in such a graph bounds a disk it follows that u u and thus u u u u in other words for graphs on spheres u u is the bicycle space the following theorem gives an easy way to count the number of equivalence classes in our game for graphs on spheres the two moves on bicolorings described here are more complicated than the ones given in the introduction this is due to the fact that we allow our graphs to have loops and bridges theorem 4 1 let g v e be a finite connected plane graph the following two moves define an equivalence relation on the set of edge bicolorings of g two colorings 8 o t dasbach and h m russell are equivalent if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of the following two moves 1 around a vertex switch the colors of all edges with exactly one endpoint at that vertex i e all non loops adjacent to the vertex 2 around a face of the embedded graph switch all colors of the edges appearing exactly once in the boundary cycle of the face then the absolute value of the tutte polynomial evaluation t 1 1 yields the number of equivalence classes of colorings proof as in the example in section 2 the problem reduces to computing the intersection of the cycle and the cocycle spaces of g using euler characteristic the number of equiv alence classes in our game is 2 b where b e dim u u e dimu dimu dim u u 2 g dim u u where g is the genus of the surface on which the graph is embedded in the plane case then the number of equivalence classes is simply 2 b where b dim u u the row vectors of the incidence matrix for g span the cocycle space u gf 2 e which has dimension v 1 see e g gr 01 lemma 14 15 1 the cocycle space u of the dual graph g v e has dimension v 1 using euler characteristic and duality we see dimu v 1 e v 1 e dimu since dimu dimu e and u u it follows that u u and u u u u the claim follows since the dimension of the bicycle space u u is given by b where 2 b t 1 1 rr 78 given a knot diagram on an orientable surface a region crossing change rcc is the result of reversing all crossings incident to a region of the diagram shimizu shi 14 and cheng gao cg 12 study equivalence classes of planar link diagrams under the rcc oper ation their results follow as a corollary of theorem 4 1 corollary 4 2 suppose d is a c component link diagram in the plane then the number of equivalence classes of diagrams with the same shadow as d under the rcc operation is 2 c 1 in particular every knot diagram can be transformed to one of the unknot via a finite sequence of rcc moves proof given a link diagram in the plane consider either of its checkerboard graphs by theorem 3 1 the tutte polynomial of this graph specializes to t 1 1 2 c 1 and the result now follows by theorem 4 1 4 1 representatives for the equivalence classes for connected plane graphs there is a natural way of choosing representatives for the equivalence classes of the color change game using the vectors defined in section 3 3 say g v e is a finite connected plane graph with medial graph having c components in lemma 3 2 we described a c 1 dimensional space p u u in the plane setting since u u for plane graphs the spaces u u u u and p are all the same as we will see in the next section this is not true for arbitrary surfaces the vectors v 1 vc described in section 3 3 span p and by lemma 17 3 3 in gr 01 any subset of c 1 of these c vectors is a basis equivalence of edge bicolored graphs on surfaces 9 theorem 4 3 let v 1 vc 1 be the basis for the bicycle space for g described above for j 1 c 1 pick an edge ej e such that vj has a 1 in the position of ej and vk has 0 in the position of ej for all k j such a set s e 1 ec 1 can be found by lemma 17 3 2 in gr 01 then the set s forms a basis for gf 2 e u u proof by construction for each j 1 c 1 the vector ej is not perpendicular to the bicycle vj thus gr 01 ej 6 u u u u u u also by construction any linear combination c 1 j 1 jej with i gf 2 is not contained in u u either and the vectors in s are linearly independent in and form a basis for gf 2 e u u 5 graphs on orientable surfaces let g v e be a graph with a cellular embedding on an orientable surface of genus g we want to compute the number of equivalence classes of bicolorings of g under the two moves described in theorem 4 1 while the general solution to this problem is not as simple as the genus 0 case we can obtain an answer by looking at certain maps on homology since g is cellularly embedded on so is its dual graph g v e the edges in e are in 1 1 correspondence to the edges of e a face of g corresponds to a vertex v of g and is bounded by edges in e that correspond to edges in e adjacent to v assume a fixed ordering of e and the induced order on e the cocycle space u of g has dimension v 1 and the cocycle space u of g has dimension v 1 as discussed in the example in section 2 the cocycle space u is perpendicular to u so u u the dimension of u is e dimu by assumption on the euler characteristic of the surface we have v e v 2 2 g therefore the quotient space u u has dimension 2 g in fact the space u u is the first homology group h 1 gf 2 of with coefficients in the field gf 2 the map u h 1 gf 2 can be constructed as follows bcfn 16 and com pare with epp 03 chose a spanning tree t of g and a spanning tree c of g such that none of the edges of c are dual to the edges of t such a spanning tree c is called a co tree for t there are exactly 2 g edges of g that are neither in c nor dual to edges in t denote these by e 1 e 2 g for j 1 2 g let pj gf 2 e be the unique cycle in c e j then for a vector u u the image u can be expressed by bcfn 16 u p 1 u p 2 g u 10 o t dasbach and h m russell where is the inner product in gf 2 e by construction we have ker u using the same construction but switching the roles of g and g we define a map u h 1 gf 2 in this case ker u 5 1 the intersection u u as a subspace of p we once again return to the space p from section 3 3 if g has a medial graph with c components the space p is generated by the vectors v 1 vc which are the cycles in g and g traced out when traversing components of the medial graph by lemma 3 2 the space p is a subspace of u u of dimension c 1 we will give a proof of a theorem of lins richter and shank lrs 87 by adapting elegant ideas of lamey silver and williams lsw 16 theorem 5 1 lrs 87 u u p u u proof the inclusion p u u is by definition of p let u gf 2 e be in u and recall that u is the space of all cycles in the graph g thus we have 3 c u 0 for all cycles c in g if u u u then additionally 4 c u 0 for all cycles c in g as in lsw 16 this allows us to construct for u u u a pair v v v u v u of vectors in gf 2 v gf 2 v as follows fix a vertex x 0 in g and an adjacent vertex x 0 in g and assign values in gf 2 to these two vertices to simplify the notation we will denote these values by x 0 and x 0 as well to obtain an assignment to any other vertex xk in g choose a path x 0 xi xi 1 xk from x 0 to xk the value of xi 1 is determined by xi 1 xi ui where ui is the edge assignment given by u ui i 1 e see figure 4 xi 1 xi ui xi ui x i uix i ui xi ui xi x i uix i 1 2 4 3 figure 4 an edge in the graph in its dual graph and the corresponding crossing in the medial graph the assignments to vertices and faces are xi 1 xi ui x i 1 x i ui 1 3 xi x i and 2 4 xi x i ui by equation 3 these assignments to the vertices do not depend on the chosen path similarly the assignments to the vertices of g are determined by u see figure 4 the assignments to the vertices in the graph and the dual graph give us assignments to the faces of the medial graph the next step is to assign values i to the arcs of the medial equivalence of edge bicolored graphs on surfaces 11 graph by taking the sum of the values of the adjacent faces see figure 4 we see that this is well defined i e 1 3 but also that the values of the two under arcs are equal 2 4 this means that along a component of the medial graph all arcs are assigned the same value and this assignment yields an element of p the last step is to express the initial vector u as an element of p at the crossing the sum of the values assigned to the two components is 1 2 xi x i xi x i ui ui thus the sum over all crossings of the components of the link with multiplicities given by their assigned values is u recall the maps u h 1 gf 2 and u h 1 gf 2 from the beginning of this section the kernel of is u and the kernel of is u since p u u we can restrict both and to the common domain p in general if an element of u u is in the kernel of it is not necessarily in the kernel of for example in the graph depicted in figure 1 the edges e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 form a cycle both in the graph and its dual graph this cycle is in the kernel of but not the elements in p however are represented by sums of cycles which are homologous in g and g and the maps and restricted to p differ at most by a change of basis hence ker p and ker p both consist of the nulhomologous elements of p thus ker p ker p u u and we get the following theorem theorem 5 2 let g v e be a finite cellularly embedded graph on a closed orientable surface of genus g let p and be as described above with b dimker p then the number of equivalence classes in the color changing game for g on is 22 g b it is an interesting question to more directly relate these results to the study of rcc equivalence of cellularly embedded checkerboard colorable link diagrams on surfaces we conclude with an example highlighting our results 5 2 example consider the following example of a graph on six vertices and eight edges embedded on a torus e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 6 e 6 e 7 e 8 e 8 12 o t dasbach and h m russell the cocycle space u is generated by the row vectors of the incidence matrix i 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 and it has dimension 5 the cocycle space of the dual graph is generated by the row vectors of the incidence matrix of the dual graph i 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 of dimension 1 the bolloba s riordan tutte polynomial of the graph is va 06 brt x y z x 5 8 x 4 28 x 3 5 x 2 y 56 x 2 2 xy 2 20 xy 65 x y 3 z 4 y 2 z 4 y 2 26 y 36 and its value brt 2 2 1 4 8 24 1 hence the medial graph has four compo nents the vector space p of dimension 3 is generated by the vectors v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 corresponding to the cycles traced out by the four components of the medial graph these vectors are the rows of the following matrix 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 we are interested in ker p where u h 1 gf 2 for that we fix a spanning tree t of the graph say t e 1 e 3 e 4 e 5 e 7 and a co tree c in the dual graph say c e 2 thus e 6 e 8 are the edges neither in c nor dual to edges in t the unique cycle in c e 6 is e 6 and the unique cycle in c e 8 is e 8 so we obtain the following vectors p 1 and p 2 which are the row vectors of the following matrix 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 the image of the vector space p in h 1 gf 2 is determined by equivalence of edge bicolored graphs on surfaces 13 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 thus the image p is 2 dimensional since dimp 3 this implies dimker p 1 finally since ker p u u we conclude the dimension of gf 2 8 u u is e dim u u 2 g
