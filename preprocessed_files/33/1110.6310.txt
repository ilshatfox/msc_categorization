integrals involving bessel or bessel type functions the technique we propose is based on the formal reduction of these family of functions to gaussians integrals of the type in a b dx a x b n e x 2 1 can be calculated using a general procedure based on the method of generating function gf 3 multiplying both sides of eq 1 by tn n and summing up over n we find g a b n 0 tn n in e b t dx e x 2 t a x exp t 2 a 2 4 b t 2 by exploiting the gf of the two variable hermite polynomials 2 n 0 tn n hn x y e x t y t 2 hn x y n n 2 k 0 xn 2 k yk n 2 k k 3 from eq 2 we get g a b n 0 tn n hn b a 2 4 and thus in a b hn b a 2 4 4 in a recent series of papers 3 it has been proved that the bessel functions can be formally reduced to gaussians according to the following representation j x x c 2 exp c x 2 2 0 5 where c 0 1 1 6 the properties of the operator c have been extensively discussed in 3 by treating it as an ordinary constant we find for example b 0 dxj 0 x 2 7 2000 mathematics subject classification

2 1 bn b a 2 8 where we have introduced the polynomials bn x y n n 2 k 0 xn 2 k yk n 2 k k k 1 2 9 whose properties will be briefly described later as a consequence of this result for any function f x that can be written as f x m m k 0 fk x k m 10 the following identify holds dxj x f a x b x 1 2 1 m k 0 fk bk b a 2 11 it is interesting to note that the linear combination of bessel functions fn x a b n k 0 n k an k bk jn k x 12 can be written as fn x a b a x 2 c b n exp c x 2 2 0 13 and therefore according to eq 4 the following identity holds dxfn x a b 2 c 1 2 hn b a 2 4 c 0 2 n n 2 k 0 bn 2 k a 2 k 4 k n 2 k k k 1 2 14 the method illustrated is more general than it may appear and can indeed be extended to other families of bessel like functions for example the spherical bessel functions 5 jn x 2 x jn 1 2 x 15 within the present formalism can be written as jn x 2 n 1 xn c n 1 2 exp c x 2 2 0 16 by using this expression the integral bn dx jn x 17 can easily be calculated by exploiting the gf method getting b 2 n 22 n 2 n n 2 b 2 n 1 0 18 2 the struve functions are defined by the series 5 h x k 0 1 k k 3 2 k 3 2 x 2 2 k 1 19 albeit in a slightly different form even in this case we can apply the operational method and this functions can be written as h x c 1 2 1 c 1 2 2 x 2 1 1 1 c 1 c 2 x 2 2 1 0 2 0 20 where the operator c i i 1 2 acts only on i and verifies the identity 6 moreover the use of the laplace allows us to write h x c 1 2 1 c 1 2 2 x 2 1 0 ds exp s 1 c 1 c 2 x 2 2 1 0 2 0 21 that can be used to prove that for not an even integer the following identity holds 0 dxx h x 1 2 sin 2 1 1 2 1 2 22 as a final example we consider the wright bessel functions 4 w x k 0 xk k k 23 z when 0 that can formally be defined as w x c 1 exp c x 0 24 by using this expression it s easy to show that dxw x 2 1 2 25 and d 0 0 dxw x e d x 1 d e 1 d 26 where e x k 0 xk k 27 is the modified mittag leffler function 4 now let us coming back to the polynomials bn x y introduced in eq 9 these are auxiliary hermite like polynomials and their properties can be deduced from those of hermite polynomials written in umbral form for example by using the first of eq 3 and eq 24 it can be shown that the generating function is given by n 0 tn n bn x y e x tw 1 1 2 y t 2 28 it is also interesting to note that these polynomials satisfy the differential equation d y bn x y 2 x bn x y bn x 0 x n 1 2 29 3 where the derivative operator d y c y has been introduced therefore we get bn x y exp c 1 y 2 x xn 1 2 30 that taking into account the operational definition of the hermite polynomials hn x y exp y 2 x xn 31 can be easily shown to coincide with the expression given in eq 9 these polynomials can be framed within the appell family nevertheless they deserve to be studied carefully and this will be done in a next paper references 1 d babusci g dattoli and m del franco lectures on mathematical methods for physics internal report enea rt 2010 5837 2 p appell j kampe de fe rie t
