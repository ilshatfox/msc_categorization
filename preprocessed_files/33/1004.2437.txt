integrals the inte grand contains a rational function with complex poles the methods are illus trated with examples found in the classical table of integrals by i s gradshteyn and i m ryzhik 1 introduction the classical table of integrals by i gradshteyn and i m ryzhik 3 contains many entries from the family 1 1 1 0 r x log x dx where r is a rational function for instance the elementary integral 4 231 1 1 2 1 0 log x dx 1 x 2 12 is evaluated simply by expanding the integrand in a power series in 1 the first author and collaborators have presented a systematic study of integrals of the form 1 3 hn 1 b b 0 log t dt 1 t n 1 as well as the case in which the integrand has a single purely imaginary pole 1 4 hn 2 a b b 0 log t dt t 2 a 2 n 1 the work presented here deals with integrals where the rational part of the inte grand is allowed to have arbitrary complex poles 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 33 key words and phrases logarithmic integrals clausen

a posey 2 evaluations in terms of polylogarithms in this section we describe the evaluation of 2 1 g a 1 0 log x dx x 2 2 ax 1 under the assumption that the denominator has non real roots that is a 2 1 the first approach to the evaluation of g a is based on the factorization of the quartic as 2 2 x 2 2 ax 1 x r 1 x r 2 where r 1 a i 1 a 2 and r 2 a i 1 a 2 the partial fraction expansion 2 3 1 x r 1 x r 2 1 r 2 r 1 1 x r 1 1 x r 2 yields 2 4 g a 1 r 2 r 1 1 0 log x dx x r 1 1 r 2 r 1 1 0 log x dx x r 2 these integrals are computed in terms of the dilogarithm function defined by 2 5 polylog 2 x x 0 log 1 t t dt a direct calculaton shows that 2 6 log x dx x a log x log 1 x a polylog 2 x a and thus 2 7 1 0 log x dx x a polylog 2 1 a it follows that 2 8 g a 1 r 2 r 1 polylog 2 1 r 1 polylog 2 1 r 2 observe that the real integral g a appears here expressed in terms of the poly logarithm of complex arguments example 2 1 the case a 1 2 yields 2 9 1 0 log x dx x 2 x 1 i 3 polylog 2 1 i 3 2 polylog 2 1 i 3 2 the polylogarithm function is evaluated using the representation 2 10 1 i 3 2 ei 3 logarithmic integrals 3 to produce polylog 2 1 i 3 2 k 1 1 2 1 i 3 k k 2 k 1 ei k 3 k 2 k 1 cos k 3 i sin k 3 k 2 similarly polylog 2 1 i 3 2 k 1 cos k 3 i sin k 3 k 2 and it follows that 1 0 log x dx x 2 x 1 i 3 polylog 2 1 i 3 2 polylog 2 1 i 3 2 2 3 k 1 sin k 3 k 2 the function sin k 3 is periodic with period 6 and repeating values 3 2 3 2 0 3 2 3 2 0 therefore k 1 sin k 3 k 2 3 2 k 0 1 6 k 1 2 k 0 1 6 k 2 2 k 0 1 6 k 4 2 k 0 1 6 k 5 2 to evaluate these sums recall the series representatin of the polygamma function x x x given by 2 11 x 1 x k 1 x k x k differentiation yields 2 12 x k 0 1 x k 2 and we obtain k 0 1 6 k j 2 1 36 k 0 1 k j 6 2 this provides the expression 2 13 k 1 sin k 3 k 2 3 72 1 6 2 6 4 6 5 6 4 victor h moll and ronald a posey the integral 2 9 is 2 14 1 0 log x dx x 2 x 1 1 36 1 6 2 6 4 6 5 6 the identities 2 15 1 x x cot x and 2 16 2 x 1 2 x x 1 2 log

example evaluates logarithmic integrals in terms of the clausen function 2 18 cl 2 x k 1 sin kx k 2 note an identical procedure can be used to evaluate the integrals 4 233 1 4 233 3 4 233 4 in 3 given by 2 19 1 0 log x dx x 2 x 1 4 2 27 2 9 1 3 2 20 1 0 x log x dx x 2 x 1 7 2 54 1 9 1 3 and 2 21 1 0 x log x dx x 2 x 1 5 2 36 1 6 1 3 respectively logarithmic integrals 5 3 an alternative approach in this section we present an alternative evaluation for the integral 3 1 g a 1 0 log x dx x 2 2 ax 1 based on the observation that 3 2 g a lim s 0 d ds 1 0 xs dx x 2 2 ax 1 the proof discussed here is based on the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind un a defined by 3 3 un a sin n 1 t sin t where a cos t the relation with the problem at hand comes from the generating function 3 4 1 1 2 ax x 2 k

expression 3 3 for the chebyshev polynomial it follows that 3 6 1 0 log x dx x 2 2 ax 1 1 sin t k 0 sin kt k 2 cl 2 t sin t this reproduces the representation discussed in section 2 note the methods presented here give the value of 3 1 in terms of the dilogarithm function the classical values 3 7 cl 2 2 cl 2 3 2 k 0 1 k 2 k 1 2 catalan are easy to establish more sophisticated evaluations appear in 5 these are given in terms of the hurwitz zeta function 3 8 s q k 0 1 k q s 6 victor h moll and ronald a posey for instance the reader will find 3 9 cl 2 2 3 3 3 s 1 2 2 3 s 2 1 3 and 3 10 cl 2 3 3

12 1 0 x log log 1 x x 4 x 2 1 dx 12 3 6 log 2 3 log 3 8 log 12 log 1 3 but is unable to evaluate 3 13 1 0 x log log 1 x x 4 2 x 2 1 dx 8 2 7 log 4 log sin 8 8 log 1 8 4 higher powers of logarithms the method of the previous sections can be used to evaluate integrals of the form 4 1 1 0 r x logp x dx where r is a rational function the ideas are illustrated with the verification of formula 4 261

1 x 1 x 6 1 3 1 1 x 1 6 1 1 x x 2 1 3 x 1 x x 2 1 2 1 1 x x 2 gives 4 3 1 0 1 x 1 x 6 log 2 x dx 1 3 j 1 1 6 j 2 1 3 j 3 1 2 j 4 logarithmic integrals 7 evaluation of j 1 consider first 1 0 xs 1 x dx

4 8 j 2 2 k 0 uk 1 2 k 1 3 the sequence uk 1 2 is periodic of period 6 and values 1 0 1 1 0 1 therefore 4 9 j 2 2 k 1 1 6 k 1 3 2 k 1 1 6 k 3 3 2 k 1 1 6 k 4 3 2 k 1 1 6 k 5 3 this can be written as j
