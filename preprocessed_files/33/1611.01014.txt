reactorului nr 30 magurele 077125 romania november 8 2021 abstract the applications of the recent results obtained in the theory of gener alized lambert functions to the mean field theory of ferromagnetism and quantum mechanics are presented as a consequence all the predictions of the weiss theory of ferromagnetism can be explicitly and exactly formu lated in several quantum mechanical problems involving delta function potentials the solutions of the transcendental eigenvalue equations are ex pressed in terms of two parameters generalized lambert functions some others till unnoticed examples of eigenvalue equations whose solutions can be written using the lambert w function are also presented 1 introduction in a series of recent papers mezo and co workers 1 2 3 and mugnaini 4 published very interesting results concerning the generalized lambert functions similar to the lambert function w a which is defined as the solution of the transcendental equation 5 xex a 1 the generalized lambert function w t 1 t 2 tn s 1 s 2 sm a is the solution of a similar but more complicated transcendental equation 1 4 ex x t 1 x tn x s 1 x sm a 2 if the denominator respectively the nominator of the fraction in eq 2 is equal to 1 we shall denote the solutions w s 1 s 2 sm a respectively w t 1 t 2 tn a in several particular cases of generalized lambert func tions explicit series expansions formulas are obtained 1 4 they are very important for explicitly solving some transcendental equations of magnetism 1 http arxiv org abs 1611 01014 v 3 quantum mechanics hydrodynamics and of other branches of physics the ap plications in pure mathematics are also very rich in the present paper we shall make use of the solution of the equation ex x t x s a 3 which is denoted w t s a and of the equation ex x t 1 x t 2 a 4 which is denoted w t 1 t 2 a the series expansion of w t s a near the origin has the form w t s a t t n 1 l n nt n e ntan 5 where t t s 6 0 and l n is the first derivative of the n th order laguerre polynomial w t s a can also be expressed in terms of the r lambert function defined by mezo and baricz 1 as the inverse of the function xex rx with r a fixed real number denoted by wr clearly if r 0 wr becomes the w lambert function the connection between w t s a and wr can be easily obtained as theorem 3 of 1 w t s a t w a exp t a t s e t 6 as noticed by mezo and baricz 1 w t 1 t 2 tn s 1 s 2 sm a is not prop erly speaking a generalization of w in the sense that there is no particular choice of the parameters t 1 t 2 tn s 1 s 2 sm or a which can transform the generalized lambert function into the w lambert function however as just mentioned the r lambert function wr has this property by inspection of the plots of the functions entering in eq 3 it is easy to see that wr can have one two or three branches mezo and baricz 1 described rigorously the branch structure of wr and pointed out that among these branches a special role is played by w 1 e 2 x for x 4 e 2 w 1 e 2 x is continuos as everywhere on the real line but is not differentiable and w 1 e 2 4 e 2 2 7 the formula 6 must be used with a certain caution as in the definition of wr r was considered to be a fixed real number under this condition the branch structure of wr its derivative and primitive were obtained however in 6 t s and a are arbitrary real parameters so r is a real function mezo and baricz 1 also obtained the series expansion of wr x around x 0 the coefficients of the series are expressed in terms of mezo baricz polynomials m n k 1 eq 14 2 wr x x r 1 n 2 m n n 1 1 r 1 xn r 1 n n 8 let us refer now to the function w t 1 t 2 a its series expansion around a 0 is given by w t 1 t 2 a t 1 n 1 1 n n ane t 1 t 2 t 1 n bn 1 2 n t 2 t 1 9 where bn are bessel polynomials the main goal of this paper is to reveal several applications of generalized lambert functions w t s a and w t 1 t 2 a in physics mainly in ferro magnetism and quantum mechanics not yet reported in literature we shall also discuss some other transcendental equations which can be solved with the lambert w function but this possibility was not yet noticed to the best of our knowledge 2 solutions of some transcendental equations us ing lambert and generalized lambert func tions we shall study the applications in ferromagnetism and quantum mechanics of two transcendental equations tanhx bx 10 which is sometimes called weiss equation of ferromagnetism and tanhx b x 11 we shall call eq 11 the inverse weiss equation just in order to have a convenient terminology in this paper the equations 10 11 were analyzed by mezo and keady in the context of hydrodynamics they describe the phase velocity respectively the dispersion of water waves 3 eqs 7 and 5 here we shall discuss the relevance of these equations in the context of ferromagnetism and quantum mechanics weiss equation can be put in the form e 2 x x 1 b x 1 b 1 12 and has the solution x 1 2 w 2 b 2 b 1 1 b 1 2 wexp 2 b 4 b e 2 b 13 3 which can be easily obtained following the steps described in subsection 2 3 2 of 3 and applying the formula 6 similarly using the approach of subsection 2 3 1 of the same paper applied to the inverse weiss equation we find that it can be put in the form e 2 x x b x b 1 14 and has the solution x 1 2 w 2 b 2 b 1 b 1 2 w exp 2 b 4 be 2 b 15 it is also useful to mention that the solution of the equation e cx a 0 x r 16 can be expressed in terms of the lambert w function 5 x r 1 c w ce cr a 0 17 3 an outline of weiss theory of ferromagnetism asweiss theory of ferromagnetism is one of the main beneficiaries of the progress made in understanding the explicit form of generalized lambert function we shall outline it in this section following 6 a system of n particles of spin s can be in a ferromagnetic state described by the equation of state m m 0 bs s kt h m g b 18 the magnetization m depends of temperature t and of external magnetic field h m m t h 19 the saturation magnetization m 0 is m 0 m t 0 h 0 n s nsg b 20 the parameter represents the molecular field parameter introduced by pierre weiss in 1907 and bs is the brillouin function bs x 2 s 1 2 s coth 2 s 1 2 s x 1 2 s coth 1 2 s x 21 if s 1 2 b 1 2 x tanhx 22 4 in this paper we shall only discuss the case s 1 2 however the case s involving the langevin function l x b x l x involves essentially the same mathematics 3 subsection 2 2 1 coming back to the case s 1 2 let us notice that if the external field is zero h 0 eq 18 becomes m m 0 tanh s kt m 23 this equation has a non zero solution and equivalently the system has a spon taneous magnetization m 6 0 if the temperature t is under a critical value namely under the critical temperature tc given by the following relation tc n 2 4 k 24 it is convenient to introduce the reduced parameters t 0 t tc h h 2 ktc m m m 0 25 as the equation of state 18 can be written now in a simpler form m t 0 h tanh m t 0 h h t 0 26 we choose the notation t 0 instead of the usual notation t for the reduced tem perature in order to avoid any confusion with the parameter t entering in the formulas concerning the generalized lambert function w t s a the reduced magnetization in zero external field is m t 0 0 tanh m t 0 0 t 0 27 and the critical isotherm is given by the equation m 1 h tanh m 1 h h 28 it can be also written as h tanh 1 m 1 h m 1 h 29 in the critical region m h 1 as tanh 1 x 1 2 ln 1 x 1 x x 1 3 x 3 o x 5 x 1 30 we get h 1 3 m 1 h 3 h m 1 31 similarly in the absence of the magnetic field near t 0 1 putting t 0 1 27 gives 5 m tanh m t 0 tanh m 1 tanhm 1 m 1 1 3 m 3 1 3 32 or 1 t 0 1 3 m 2 m 1 t 0 1 33 the behavior of the reduced spontaneous magnetization near the reduced critical temperature tc 1 m 1 t 0 34 is typical for a mean field theory of critical phenomena 6 actually the for mulas 31 33 34 give the critical behavior of the weiss ferromagnet as the spontaneous magnetization decreases monotonically when temperature in creases its maximum value is reached at t 0 and m 0 0 1 35 4 applications of the new results concerning gen eralized lambert functions to ferromagnetism replacing in eq 10 x m t 0 t 0 b t 0 36 and using the formula 6 we get the following relations for the reduced mag netization in the absence of the magnetic field m t 0 t 0 2 w 2 t 0 2 t 0 1 1 2 n 1 l n 4 n t 0 n e 2 t 0 n 37 actually eq 37 can be directly obtained from 3 eq 7 making the re placement yc t 0 it is easy to see that the condition m 0 1 38 is fulfilled as l 1 x 1 and limt 0 0 e 2 t 0 0 due to the exponential term the series in the r h s of 37 is rapidly convergent the expression 37 of the magnetization can be also expressed in terms of the r lambert function as see eq 6 w 2 t 0 2 t 0 1 2 t 0 wexp 2 t 0 4 t 0 exp 2 t 0 39 6 figure 1 the reduced spontaneous magnetization of the weiss model in the case of critical temperature t 0 1 and the index of wr takes its critical value namely r 1 e 2 40 in this case w 2 2 1 2 w 1 e 2 4 e 2 0 41 according to eq 7 consequently according to 41 the reduced magnetiza tion at the critical temperature is zero m 1 0 42 more than this as mentioned just before eq 6 the magnetization is not differentiable in t 1 but is still continuos this behavior is compatible with the aspect of the experimental curve of reduced spontaneous magnetization at critical temperature see fig 1 if the magnetic field is non zero eq 26 can be written as tanh m t 0 h t 0 h t 0 m t 0 h t 0 h t 0 h 43 or putting 7 u m t 0 h t 0 h 44 as tanhu t 0 u h 45 or equivalently e 2 u u h 1 t 0 u h 1 t 0 1 46 according to 13 the solution of this equation is u 1 2 w 2 h 2 t 0 2 h 2 t 0 1 47 so finally we get m t 0 h t 0 2 w 2 h 2 t 0 2 h 2 t 0 1 h 48 or using eq 6 m t 0 h wexp 2 h 2 t 0 4 t 0 e 2 h 2 t 0 h 1 t 0 1 49 the critical isotherm is obtained making in the previous formula the replace ment t 0 1 m 1 h wexp 2 h 1 4 e 2 h 1 1 50 let us notice that the r lambert functions entering in eqs 39 49 50 have quite special forms wx 2 x lnx wx 2 x a lnx wx bx 51 these results are important as they allow explicit calculation of any phys ical quantity of weiss theory of ferromagnetism for s 1 2 there are very few realistic physical theories in such a situation evidently a consequence of the fact that the brillouin function b 1 2 can be inverted using generalized lam bert functions we can wonder if there is another brillouin function with this property the answer can be easily obtained if we write the brillouin function bs x as a ratio of two polynomials in exp x 2 s there is no other bs with finite s which can be inverted using the generalized lambert functions only for s the langevin function l x can be inverted as previously noted it has a somewhat more complicated form compared with 51 namely see subsection 2 2 1 of 3 and eq 6 of this paper 8 l 1 a 4 a 1 2 w a 1 a 1 exp 2 a 1 4 a 1 2 exp 2 a 1 52 so the wr function in 52 has the form wx bx see eq 51 with b 4 a 2 1 one of the tasks of the theory is to show that eq 49 is compatible with the critical behavior of a weiss ferromagnet eqs 31 34 the remark inserted just after eq 42 is a step in this direction 5 applications of lambert and generalized lam bert functions to quantum mechanics the first appearance of a lambert equation in quantum mechanics is probably a toy model for the ionizedh 2 molecule an electron moving in 1 d in the potential of two identical attractive delta functions simulating the two hydrogen nuclei protons the model was proposed by frost in 1956 7 its eigenvalue equation is a transcendental equation in c c g 1 e cr 53 with the solutions c g 1 r w rg e rg 54 which give the electron eigenenergies e 1 2 c 2 55 the plus sign corresponds to the ground state and the minus to the unique excited state the results 54 55 were obtained in 1993 by scott et al 8 we repeated this short calculation for reasons of completeness it is quite surprising that since 1993 till now the eq 53 was discussed in a large number of papers the last one being 9 see eq 16 of this paper but its connection with the lambert function remained unnoticed apparently the only exception is provided by 1 anyway we must keep in mind that the spectrum of a particle moving in 1 d in the potential of two symmetric attractive delta functions can be expressed in terms of the lambert function actually the conclusion is more general the lambert and the generalized lambert functions systematically appear in spectral problems of schroedinger equations with delta function potentials we shall illustrate this conclusion with several examples an attractive delta function situated near an impenetrable wall see for instance 10 problem 3 9 9 2 g 2 m x a 56 leads to a bound state energy condition tanh k k g k 57 with the solution k 1 2 g w geg 58 an attractive delta potential 2 g 2 m x a 59 in the middle of an infinite square well leads to 10 problem 3 11 tan kl 2 g 2 l kl 60 the case of two different delta functions 10 problem 3 11 v x 2 g 1 2 m x a 2 g 2 2 m x a 61 produces a richer physics the attractive symmetric case g 1 g 2 firstly analyzed by frost 7 was already discussed see eq 55 of this paper the case of antisymmetric potentials g 1 g 2 g leads to the following eigenvalue equation 10 problem 3 12 b ek 4 a 2 g 4 2 ag 2 k 2 ag 2 k 62 with the solution given by a generalized lambert function k w 2 ag 2 2 ag 2 4 a 2 g 4 63 the case of attractive but different delta functions was solved by mezo and keady 1 even a single attractive delta function can produce a spectrum given by a generalized lambert function namely byw t s x if the boundary conditions are less usual 11 the dirichlet boundary conditions generate an eigenvalue equation for the wave vector k similar to the weiss equation tanh ka k 64 a are parameters and the neumann boundary conditions one similar to the inverse weiss equation 10 tanh ka k 65 going further to higher dimensions let us notice that the rotational spec trum of an attractive delta shell potential see 12 eq 13 is given by an equation k 1 coth kr v 0 66 which can be solved using the lambert function k v 0 2 1 2 r w rv 0 exp rv 0 67 the most general non relativistic quantum mechanical problems involving and functions were studied from the perspective of mathematical physics by albeverio 13 finitely many point interactions in 3 d might lead to eigenvalues equations like see 13 eq 1 1 81 y e y 4 l 68 with the solutions y 4 l w e 4 l 69 both periodic delta interactions and infinitely many interactions in 1 d might produce weiss and inverse weiss equations see 13 eq 2 3 25 3 39 3 40 the physical applications cover toy models for crystals with impurities kronig penney models etc other similar applications are discussed by valluri 14 6 conclusions due to the interesting results obtained recently in the study of the general ized lambert equation the exact analytical solution of weiss equation can be explicitly written as a series expansion in this way the weiss theory of fer romagnetism becomes one of the very few cases when all the predictions of a quite realistic description of a physical system can be exactly and analytically obtained the applications of the explicit formulas obtained for the generalized lambert functions w t s a and w t 1 t 2 a to ferromagnetism and quan tum mechanics are also discussed
