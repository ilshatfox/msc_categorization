functions c z and d z of the first and second kind for complex z and the degree apply the results to the case z 1 1 and establish the connection of these results to asymptotic bessel function approximations of the functions for z 1 1 introduction a number of results are known for the asymptotic behavior of the gegenbauer functions of the first and second kinds c z and d z for the degree

and exclude the limits z 1 these cases have been of interest in recent problems for example in 4 1 in the present work we sketch the derivation of these results show that they can be extended to include the cases usually excluded we show also that the results connect smoothly for large and 1 z small to asymptotic expansions for c z and d z in terms of bessel functions thms 3 and 4 those

derivation of theorem 1 start with the following integral representation for d z for z c 0 and 2 0 2 sec 1 5 12 d x 1 2 i e 2 i c dt t 1 t z t z where the integration contour c in the t plane runs from around the point z in the positive sense and back to c z the factors t z are taken as cut in the t plane from z to along the directions defined by the lines from t 0 to t z the phases of the factors t z are defined as zero on the upper sides of the cuts for z 0 and and elsewhere by continuation in z the function c z has a similar integral representation for 0 and 2 0 2 sec 1 3 13 c z 1 2 i e 2 i c dt t 1 t z t z where the contour c i 0 i runs around the negative t axis in the positive sense in this representation the phases of the factors t z are defined separately for z 0 with in both cases the factors cut in the t plane as above from t z to 0 arg t z 2 see 2 sec 1 3 or 1 sec 3 15 2 2 in these expressions z z z 2 1 with z 2 1 cut in the z plane from z 1 to argz for z in the upper lower half plane z is in the upper lower half plane outside the unit circle while z 1 z is in the lower upper half plane inside the unit circle for z 1 1 z lie on the unit circle the singularities at z pinch the contour c for z 1 so d z has branch points at 1 and can be taken as cut from 1 to similarly the singularities at z pinch the contour c for z 1 so c z has a branch point there and can be taken as cut from 1 to in treating the asymptotic properties of c z and d z in we will take 0 and 0 the integrands in eqs 12 and 13 are then singular at t 0 z and z and smaller in magnitude between and vanish for t so there will be saddle points in the region of the singularities if the contours c or c can be distorted to run through the saddle points in the directions in which 4 loyal durand the integrands decrease most rapidly the method of steepest descents provides an estimate of the integrals this is valid provided the integrands are small on the remainder of the contour and decrease rapidly for t to determine the location of the saddle points write the integrands in eqs 13 and 12 as e t with 14 t 1 ln t ln t z ln t z and require that d dt vanish as required for a stationary point this gives the condition 15 1 t t z t z 0 for large the solutions must be close to z or z if those points are well separated the solutions to order 1 are 16 t z 1 1 o 2 1 2 in general 17 t 1 1 2 z z 2 1 1 2 1 so there are only the two saddle points t next expand the exponent function t in a taylor series around the saddle points to second order for large 18 t t 2 z 2 t t 2 near t this gives the approximation 1 2 i e 2 i z 1 1 1 ei 1 z 19 z z c dt e 1 2 2 z 2 t t 2 for the integral in the neighborhood of the saddle point at t the factors e i 1 z and z z in this expression arise from the factors t z and t z in the limit of large a similar result holds near t with a different phase t z e i z z 1 o 1 the coefficient of t t 2 in the exponential in the last factor in eq 19 has phase e 2 i where 20 arg arg z 1 2 arg with 2 arg 2 arg z and 2 arg 2 with these ranges the contour c can be distorted to run through the saddle point in the direction with arg t t 2 the exponent is then real and negative and the integration proceeds in the direction of steepest descent away from the saddle the convergence of the integral away from the saddle point is rapid for 2 z 2 1 since the exact integrand remains small on c away from the saddle point we can extend the integration on t to without changing the integral significantly complex asymptotics in for the gegenbauerfunctions c z and d z with z 1 1 5 the result of the remaining gaussian integral is just a factor i 2 z 2 2 where the factor e i from dt has been absorbed thus taking large d z 2 e 1 2 2 1 z 2 1 2 ei z 21 1 o 1 the factor in parentheses is just stirling s approximation for 1 a known factor in d z so d z 2 1 z 2 1 2 ei z 1 o 1 22 0 0 2 arg 2 0 arg z 1 in agreement with eqs 6 3 and a 5 in 2 but without the restriction on noted there this result holds in the complex z plane cut from z 1 to in the case of c z we must distinguish the cases z 0 and z 0 for z 0 the integral on the contour c reproduces the result for d z in eq 22 the integral on the c contour gives a similar result with the replacement of z by z and an extra factor e i from the phase of the factor t z e i z z 1 o 1 in the integrand for z 0 t z e 2 i z z for large and the factor ei in eq 22 from the c contour is replaced by e i the contribution from c is unchanged combining the results for the c and c integrations we find that for z 0 0 0 2 arg 2 and 0 arg z 1 c z 2 1 z 2 1 2 e i z z 1 o 1 23 2 1 z 2 1 2 e i z z 1 o 1 24 this agrees with eq a 8 in 2 and with watson s result for c z 1 sec 2 3 2 17 the earlier results for c x and d x were derived for along rays in the right half t plane with 0 arg 2 the restrictions are not necessary and the results continue to hold for arg 0 and arg 2 the result for c z must be interpreted with care since z 1 and z 1 z 1 for z 6 1 1 one of the two terms in eq 24 usually becomes exponentially small relative to the other for and should be dropped relative to the uncertainties of o 1 in the dominant term thus for with fixed z 1 and z 0 from either above or below the first discontinuous term in eq 24 becomes exponentially small and should be dropped relative to the second in fact for z 0 the saddle point at z lies inside the contour for the z integral is inaccessible and does not contribute to the final result the asymptotic estimate for c z is therefore continuous across the real axis as it should be this completes the derivation of the results in theorem 1 6 loyal durand derivation of theorem 2 the functions d x and c x on the cut x 1 1 can be defined in terms of d z for z complex by 6 d x ie i ei d x i 0 e i d x i 0 25 c x e i ei d x i 0 e i d x i 0 26 c x i 0 27 for z 1 1 take z cos 0 then z e i and z 2 1 e i 2 sin for z 0 and eqs 22 and

hold it follows from the expressions for t in eq 17 that the asymptotic limit for the saddle points that used in the calculations requires that z 2 1 furthermore the points t or z must be separated widely enough that the integration over one saddle is not influenced by the presence of the second the convergence of the saddle point integrals is determined by the coefficient in the exponential in the integral in eq 19 convergence on the right scale re quires that the distance between the points be much larger than the sum of the distances over which the saddle point integrations converge given by the scale factors 2 z 2 2 in the gaussian integrands this gives the condition 30 z z 2 sin 2 z 2 2 2 z 2 2 2 2 2 for z 1 1 so requires that 31 z 2 1 this is the same as the condition used in the derivation of t given above up to a factor for fixed large eq 31 bounds z 2 1 away from 1 the saddle points t merge for 0 z 1 and cannot be treated as independent in the steepest descent calculations which lead to the results above for z 1 the saddle points co alesce into a single saddle between t 0 and t 1 and an integration as in eq 19 with 2 reproduces the correct asymptotic limit c 1 2 1 2 for z 1 the points z pinch the contour c and the result is singular c z complex asymptotics in for the gegenbauerfunctions c z and d z with z 1 1 7 z 1 2 1 2 derivation of theorem 3 to treat the limit z 1 we use a different technique developed in 7 secs iia iib we start with the standard hypergeometric expression for c z written in a more useful form c z 2 1 2 2 f 1 2 1 2 1 z 2 32 2 1 2 1 z 2 1 2 33 2 f 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 z 2 we next introduce the barnes type representation 1 sec 2 3 3 15 for the type of hypergeometric function that appears in eq 33 and will be encountered again later 2 f 1 b 1 2 b 1 2 1 u 2 34 1 1 2 i cb ds b 1 2 s b 1 2 s b 1 2 b 1 2 s 1 s u 2 s the contour cb in the barnes representation initially runs from i to i in the s plane staying to the right of the poles of the factors b 1 2 s and b 1 2 s in the integrand and to the left of the poles of s but it can be deformed to run around the positive real axis cb 0 with the same restrictions expanding the ratios of b dependent gamma functions in the first line of eq 35 in inverse powers of b assumed large using stirling s approximation for the gamma function and writing the powers of s that appear in terms of combinations of the form 1 s s 1 s k gives a series 2 f 1 b 1 2 b 1 2 1 u 2 35 1 1 2 i cb ds s 1 s u 2 4 s 1 1 b 2 s 4 s s 1 1 3 s s 1 s 2 o 1 b 4 where u 2 b 2 u with the choice of the deformed contour cb above the integrals that remain in eq are expressible in terms of bessel functions through a barnes representa tion for the latter which uses the same contour cb 36 u 2 j u 1 2 i cb ds s s 1 u 2 4 s the first term in the series in eq gives u 2 j u after combining the factors s s 1 s k k 0 1 with s to get 1 k 1 s k 1 8 loyal durand we can shift the contour of integration to the right to run just to the left of the pole at s k 1 the replacement of s by s s k 1 then gives 1 2 i cb ds s s 1 s k s s 1 u 2 s 37 1 k 1 2 i c b ds s s k 2 u 2 4 s k 1 1 k 1 u 2 k 1 j k 1 u for the following terms with k 0 1 the use of stirling s approximation itself only an asymptotic expansion is not justified on the entire integration contour and the result from eq 35 gives only an asymptotic series for the hypergeometric function 2 f 1 b 1 2 b 1 2 1 u 2 1 u 2 38 j u 1 b 2 1 4 u 2 j 1 u u 2 2 j 2 u 1 3 u 2 3 j 3 u o 1 b 4 the use of this expression in eq 35 with b and 1 2 gives an asymptotic series for c z in powers of 1 2 with z 2 2 1 z c z 2 1 2 1 2 1 z 2 1 2 z 2 1 2 j 1 2 z 39 1 2 1 4 z 2 j 1 2 z z 2 2 j 3 2 z 1 3 z 2 3 j 5 2 z o 1 4 for large and z fixed this series is useful more generally for 1 and 1 z 1 we can obtain a closely related series using the same technique starting with eq 32 and expanding in terms of the parameter 2 2 1 4 this approach was used in 7 sec iia in our treatment of bessel function expansions complex asymptotics in for the gegenbauerfunctions c z and d z with z 1 1 9 for the associated legendre functions p j z the result is c z 2 1 2 1 2 y 2 1 2 j 1 2 y 40 1 2 2 1 2 y 2 2 j 3 2 y 1 3 y 2 3 j 5 2 y o 1 2 2 where y 2 2 1 z the series in eq 39 here obtained directly is equivalent to that obtained by expanding the powers of 2 in the coefficients and the argument of the bessel functions in eq 40 in terms of the simpler variable 2 and the prefactor 1 z 2 1 2 in powers of 1 z the difference in the leading terms is unimportant for 1 and 1 z 1 to connect this result to the asymptotic expression for c z in eq 30 for 1 we consider the case in which only the leading term in the asymptotic series in eq 39 is important the result in eq 30 is valid for 1 z 1 which requires that z 1 despite the appearance of powers of z in the correction terms this is allowed provided that the corrections to the leading term are small the bessel functions are all of the same general magnitude for z large so the term in z 3 in the second term in the series is dominant for z 1 and the condition for the the 1 2 correction to the leading term to be small is 41 1 2 z 2 3 1 z 2 3 2 1 under this condition the following terms in the series in eq 39 are also initially small for z cos on 1 z 1 this requires that be small with 2 13 in the limit of large z hankel s expansion for the bessel functions 5 sec 10 17 i gives j z 2 z cos z 1 2 2 1 o 1 z 2 42 sin z 1 2 2 4 2 1 8 z o 1 z 3 the leading term in eq 39 therefore has the asymptotic limit c z 2 1 2 1 2 1 z 2 1 2 z 2 1 2 43 2 z cos z 2 the corrections are of relative order 1 z 23 10 loyal durand expanding the leading ratio of gamma functions in terms of assumed large and expressing the result in terms of 1 1 3 we obtain c cos 2 1 1 sin cos 2 44 1 o 1 2 3 this is equivalent to the expression in eq 30 for 1 as required for the the correction terms in eq 39 to be negligible so the two expressions connect smoothly in their overlapping region of validity 1 1 1 3 to obtain an asymptotic bessel function series for d z for z 1 we use the relation 2 sec 3 5 d z 1 2 ei 1 cos 45 c z 2 2 1 z 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 c 1 2 1 z to express d z in terms of gegenbauer functions of the first kind the function c z can be approximated using the series in eq 39 the modified indices 2 1 and 1 in the second gegebauer function give so we may use the same series for this function but with the index 1 2 on the bessel functions and their coefficients replaced by 1 2 1 2 we begin with z 1 where z iz z 2 2 z 1 and z j n z 1 n z i n z with i z the modified or hyperbolic bessel function of the first kind this gives as the leading term d z 2 ei 1 1 cos 46 2 1 2 2 1 z 1 2 1 2 z 2 1 2 i 1 2 z z 2 1 1 2 z 1 2 1 2 z 2 1 2 i 1 2 z o 1 2 the higher order terms in the series are negligible for z 1 23 for the function i 1 2 z can be eliminated in terms of the macdonald function k 1 2 z through the relation 5 sec 10 27 4 47 k z 2 1 sin i z i

also be dropped to leading order and 49 d z 1 ei 1 2 z 2 1 2 k z 1 2 we obtain the asymptotic forms of the gegenbauer functions on the cut for x cos 1 using eqs 25 and 26 and the relations 50 k e i 2 z i 2 e i 2 j z iy z this gives d x 1 2 1 x 2 2 y z 51 c x 1 2 1 x 2 2 j z 52 1 2 where the uncertainties in these expressions in their range of validity are order 1 2 3 for using hankel s expansions of j z and y z for z large 5 sec 10 17 i and expressing the results in terms of with x cos z 2 1 cos 1 2 24 and 13 these relations give d cos 1 2 1 1 sin sin 2 53 c cos 1 2 1 1 sin cos 2 54 to leading

hy pergeometric functions in leading order and expanding the ratio of gamma functions in the first term for 1 this reduces in leading order to d z ei 2 1 sin 1 2 1 2 1 z 2 z 2 1 2 57 e i 2 1 z 2 1 2 j

sin 1 2 y 1 2 o 1 envy 1 2 for 0 with fixed and the envelope functions are treated in 4 sec 2 3 1 as may be seen through a comparison with eqs 51 and 52 the results of the two approaches agree for 1 with the simple approximations given here in theorems 2 4 applying in sectors in z cos for 0 and the uniform results holding for for bounded away from the bessel function expansions derived here also reproduce the first n powers of 1 z in the legendre functions properly for z 1 when the bessel functions through order n are included the pre factors and the variable in the uniform approximations are unfortu nately awkward for physical applications to scattering theory where e g 2 j j 1 1 cos j j 1 q 2 p 2 qb rather than j 1 2 is the natural variable here j is conserved angular momentum in the scattering q is the invariant momentum transfer p is the mo mentum of the particles in the center of mass system and b the impact parameter or point of closest approach in the free schro dinger equation the pre factors also disrupt the useful connection between partial wave series in legendre functions and fourier bessel transforms in the theory of particle scattering see for example 8
