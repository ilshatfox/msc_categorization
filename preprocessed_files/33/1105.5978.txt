show that its action on a constant is not zero but yields the sum of the logarithmic function and the euler mascheroni constant we discuss more general aspects concerning the logarithm of an operator for the study of the properties of the bessel functions in this note we deal with the operator l ln x 1 and establish how it acts on unity on monomials and more in general on a function we define the logarithm according to the identity lnx lim 0 x 1 x 0 0 and thus l 1 lim 0 x 1 1 2 before taking the limit we treat as a generic real number and write 1 x x 1 1 x 3 that substituted in eq 2 0 gives l 1 lim 0 1 x 1 1 4 by applying the l ho pital rule we get l 1 lim 0 x 1 lnx 1 2 1 lnx 5 where is the euler mascheroni constant the same procedure can be applied to the study of the action of the operator 1 on monomials for n integer greater than 1 we get l x n lim 0 1 n xn n 1 1 lim 0 xn n n 1 lnx n 1 2 n 1 xn n 1 lnx 6 where according to the definition of the digamma function z 2 n 1 1 n n 1

general for a function f x that can be expressed as a power series i e f x n 0 an n xn 8 by assuming that the operator and the summation commutes as a consequence of eq 6 we find l f x lnx f x n 0 an n hn x n 9 a significant consequence of the previous formula is the following identity l ln 2 x i 0 x k 0 x 10 where i 0 and k 0 are respectively the 0 th order modified bessel function and macdonald function just as a final example let us now calculate l lnx one has l lnx lim 0 x lnx lnx 11 by exploiting eq 3 it is easy to show that see also ref 1 p 103 x lnx 1 x 1 lnx 1 12 and therefore we obtain l lnx 2 lnx lnx 13 where is the riemann zeta function it is worth stressing that according to the previous discussion the operator l does not commute with the derivative itself for example as a consequence of eqs 5 and 6 one has l x xn 1 x n 0 14 this is not surprising since the fractional derivative at least according to the definition given in eq 3 displays an analogous behaviour it is also interesting to note that the operator l once acting on an entire function produces a new function with a logarithmic singularity the action of its inverse l 1 if it exists on a function with logarithmic singularities could in principle be a tool to remove these divergences further comments on this last point and on the relevant applications in the theory of renormalization will be presented elsewhere in a recent series of papers 3 4 the theory of bessel functions has been reformulated using the following notation j x c x 2 exp c x 2 2 0 15 where r 1 r 1 and the operator c is defined by the following identity c 0 16 according to this formalism the derivatives of a bessel function with respect to its index can be written as j x c x 2 exp c x 2 2 ln x 2 ln c 0 17 that faces us with the necessity of evaluating the action of the logarithm of the operator c on 0 in analogy with eq 2 we set ln c 0 lim 0 c 1 0 18 2 i e taking into account eq 16 ln c 0 lim 0 0 19 that inserted in eq 17 yields j x ln x 2 j x k 0 1 k k x 2 2 k lim 0 k k 20 from which by keeping the appropriate limit we obtain j x ln x 2 j x k 0 1 k k 1 k k 1 x 2 2 k 21 that is a well known result 2 as further example of known identity which can be derived using the same method we consider the following integral b 0 dxj x lnx 22 following the definitions 2 15 we find b c 1 2 1 2 ln 2 1 2 ln c 1 2 1 2 0 ln 2 1 2 23 that is the integral 6 771 of ref 5 for 0 one has b 0 ln 2 24 we believe that the results we have presented in this paper offer a very effective tool for treating a large body of problems in pure and applied mathematics a more systematic analysis will be presented in a forthcoming investigation acknowledgments one of us g d recognizes the warm hospitality and the financial support of the
