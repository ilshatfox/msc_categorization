ryzhik contains some integrals that can be reduced to the frullani type we present a selection of them 1 introduction the table of integrals 3 contains many evaluations of the form 1 1 0 f ax f bx x dx f 0 f ln b a expressions of this type are called frullani integrals conditions that guarantee the validity of this formula are given in 1 and 4 in particular the continuity of f and the convergence of the integral are sufficient for 1 1 to hold 2 a list of examples many of the entries in 3 are simply particular cases of 1 1 example 2 1 the evaluation of 3 434 2 in 3 2 1 0 e ax e bx x dx ln b a corresponds to the function f x e x example 2 2 the change of variables t e x in example 2 1 yields 2 2 1 0 tb 1 ta 1 ln t dt ln a b this is 4 267 8 in 3 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 33 key words and phrases integrals frullani integrals 1 http arxiv org abs 1005 2940 v 1 2 m albano t amdeberhan e beyerstedt and v moll example 2 3 a generalization of the previous example appears as entry 3 476 1 in 3 2 3 0 e vx p e ux p dx x 1 p ln u v this comes from frullani s result with a simple additional scaling example 2 4 the choice 2 4 f x e qx e px x with p q 0 satisfies f 0 and 2 5 f 0 lim x 0 e qx e px x p q then frullani s theorem yields 0 e aqx e apx ax e bqx e bpx bx dx x p q ln b a that can be written as 0 e aqx e apx a e bqx e bpx b dx x 2 p q ln b a this is entry 3 436 in 3 example 2 5 now choose 2 6 f x x 1 e x exp cex then frullani s theorem yields entry 3 329 of 3 in view of f 0 e c and f 0 0 a exp ceax 1 e ax b exp ce bx 1 e bx dx e c ln b a example 2 6 the next example uses 2 7 f x x c with c 0 to produce 2 8 0 ax c bx c x dx c ln b a this is 3 232 in 3 example 2 7 entry 4 536 2 in 3 is 2 9 0 tan 1 px tan 1 qx x dx 2 ln p q this follows directly from 1 1 by choosing f x tan 1 x frullani integrals 3 example 2 8 the function f x ln a be x gives the evaluation of entry 4 319 3 of 3 2 10 0 ln a be px ln a be qx x dx ln a a b ln p q example 2 9 the function f x ab ln 1 x x produces entry 4 297 7 of 3 2 11 0 b ln 1 ax a ln 1 bx x 2 dx ab ln b a example 2 10 entry 3 484 2 12 0 1 a qx qx 1 a px px dx x ea 1 ln q p is obtained by choosing f x 1 a x x in 1 1 example 2 11 the final example in this section corresponds to the function 2 13 f x a be x cex g he x that produces entry 3 412 1 of 3 2 14 0 a be px cepx g he px a be qx ceqx g he qx dx x a b c g h ln q p 3 a separate source of examples the list presented in this section contains integrals of frullani type that were found in volume 1 of ramanujan s notebooks 2 example 3 1 0 tan 1 ax tan 1 bx x dx 2 ln a b example 3 2 0 ln p qe ax p qe bx dx x ln 1 q p ln b a example 3 3 0 ax p ax q n bx p bx q n dx x 1 p n qn ln a b where a b p q are all positive example 3 4 0 cos ax cos bx x dx ln b a example 3 5 0 sin b a x 2 sin b a x 2 dx x 0 cos ax cos bx 2 x dx 1 2 ln b a 4 m albano t amdeberhan e beyerstedt and v moll example 3 6 0 sin px sin qx dx x 0 cos p q x cos p q x 2 x dx 1 2 ln p q p q example 3 7 the evaluation of 0 ln 1 2 n cosax n 2 1 2 n cos bx n 2 dx x ln b a ln 1 n 2 n 2 1 ln b a ln 1 1 n 2 n 2 1 is more delicate and is given in detail in the next section example 3 8 the value 0 e ax sin ax e bx sin bx x dx 0 follows directly from 1 1 since in this case f x e x sinx satisfies f f 0 0 example 3 9 0 e ax cos ax e bx cos bx x dx ln b a 4 a more delicate example entry 4 324 2 of 3 states that 4 1 0 ln 1 2 a cospx a 2 ln 1 2 a cos qx a 2 dx x 2 ln q p ln 1 a 1 a 6 1 2 ln q p ln 1 1 a a 1 or a 1 this requires a different approach since the obvious candidate for a direct application of frullani s theorem namely f x ln 1 2 a cosx a 2 does not have a limit at infinity in order to evaluate this entry start with 4 2 1 0 xydx 1 y 1 so 4 3 1 0 dy 1 0 xydx 1 0 dx 1 0 xydy 1 0 x 1 lnx dx 1 0 dy y 1 ln 2 this is now generalized for arbitrary symbols and as 4 4 0 e t e t t dt ln frullani integrals 5 to prove 4 4 make the substitution u e t that turns the integral into 1 0 u 1 u 1 lnu du 1 0 du 1 1 uwdw 1 1 dw 1 0 uwdu 1 1 dw w 1 ln now observe that 2 a cos rx 1 a 2 6 1 therefore it is legitimate to expand the logarithmic terms as infinite series using ln 1 z k

that is 4 5 0 eipx e ipx k eiqx e iqx k x dx k r 0 k r 0 e 2 r k ipx e 2 r k iqx x dx it is time to employ equation 4 4 a closer look at 4 5 shows that care must be exercised the integrals are sensitive to the parity of k more precisely the quantity 2 r k vanishes if and only if k is even and r k 2 in which case there is a zero contribution to summation otherwise the second integral in 4 5 is always equal to ln q p therefore k r 0 k r 0 e 2 r k ipx e 2 r k iqx dx x 2 k ln q p if k is odd 2 k k k 2 ln q p if k is even 6 m albano t amdeberhan e beyerstedt and v moll combining the results obtained thus far yields 4 6 i 0 ln 1 2 a cos px a 2 ln 1 2 a cos qx a 2 x dx 0 dx x k 1 1 k 1 ak cosk px cosk qx k k 1 1 k 1 ak k 2 k k r 0 k r 0 e 2 r k ipx e 2 r k iqx x dx ln q p k odd 1 k 1 ak k
