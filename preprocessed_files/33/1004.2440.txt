table of integrals by grad shteyn and rhyzik s presented 1 introduction the compilation by i s gradshteyn and i m ryzhik 6 contains about 600 pages of definite integrals some of them are quite elementary for instance 4 291 1 1 1 1 0 ln 1 x x dx 2 12 is obtained by expanding the integrand as a power series and using the value 1 2 k 1 1 k 1 k 2 2 12 the latter is reminiscent of the series 1 3 k 1 1 k 2 2 6 the reader will find in 3 many proofs of the classical evaluation 1 3 most entries in 6 appear quite formidable and their evaluation requires a variety of methods and ingenuity entry 4 229 7 1 4 2 4 ln ln tanx dx 2 ln 3 4 1 4 2 illustrates this point vardi 13 describes a good amount of mathematics involved in evaluating 1 4 the integral is first interpreted in terms of the derivative of the 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 33 key words and phrases integrals polylogarithm function the author wishes to acknowledge the partial support of nsf dms 0713836 1

computed in terms of the gamma function this is an unexpected procedure any treatise such as 6 containing large amount of information is bound to have some errors some of them are easy to fix for instance formula 3 511 8 in the sixth edition 5 reads 1 7 0 dx cosh 2 x k 0 1 k 2 k 1 the source given for this integral is formula bi 98 25 from the table by bierens de haan 2 where it appears as 1 8 0 1 et e t dt t k 0 1 k 2 k 1 the change of variable t x yields a correct version of 1 7 1 9 0 dx cosh x 2 k 0 1 k 2 k 1 it is now clear what happened a typo produced 1 7 in the latest edition of the integral table 6 the editors have decided to replace this entry with 1 10 0 dx cosh 2 x 1 the right hand side of 1 7 has been corrected the advent of computer algebra packages has not made these tables obsolete the latest version of mathematica evaluates 1 10 directly but it is unable to produce 1 9 most of the errors in 6 are of the type some parameter has been mistyped an exponent has been misplaced parameters are mistaken to be identical a common mishap is and u appearing in the same formula despite of this fact it is a remark able achievement for such an endevour the accuracy of 6 comes from the effort of many generations beginning with 9 and also including 7 11 a different type of error was found by one of the authors it turns out that entry 3 248 5 of 6 is incorrect to explain the reason for looking at any specific entry requires some background the stated entry 3 248 5 involves the rational function 1 11 x 1 4 x 2 3 1 x 2 2 an elementary proof 3 and the result says 1 12 0 dx 1 x 2 3 2 x x 1 2 2 6 the encounter begins with the evaluation of 1 13 n 0 4 a m 0 dx x 4 2 ax 2 1 m 1 in the form 1 14 n 0 4 a m 2 pm a 2 a 1 m 1 2 where pm a is a polynomial of degree m the reader will find in 1 10 details about 1 13 and properties of the coefficients of pm it is rather interesting that n 0 4 a m appears in the expansion of the double square root function 1 15 a 1 c a 1 1 2 k 1 1 k 1 k n 0 4 a k 1 ck browsing 5 on a leisure day and with double square roots in our mind formula 3 248 5 caught our attention after many failed attempts at the proof a simple nu merical integration showed that 1 12 is incorrect in spite of our inability to evaluate this integral we have produced many equivalent versions the reader is invited to ver ify that if x p x 4 2 px 2 1 then the integral in 1 12 is i 5 3 1 where 1 16 i p q 0 dx x p x q x p x q the correct value of 1 12 has eluded us the reader is surely aware that often typos or errors could have profound conse quences in a letter to larry glasser regarding 1 12 we mistyped the function x of 1 11 as 1 17 x 1 4 x 2 3 1 x 2 larry a consumated integrator replied with 3 tanh 1 2 1 2 tanh 1 where 7 3 2 7 beautiful but it does not help with 1 12 the editors of 5 have found an alternative to this quandry the latest edition 6 has no entry 3 248 5 another example of errors in 6 has been discussed in the american mathematical journal by e talvila 12 several entries starting with 3 851 1 5 1 18 0 x sin ax 2 sin 2 bx dx b 2 a 2 a cos b 2 a sin a 2 b are shown to be incorrect this time the errors are more dramatic the integrals are divergent these entries do not appear in the latest edition 6 4 t amdeberhan and v moll the website http www math tulane edu vhm table html has the goal to provide proofs and context to the entries in 6 the example chosen for the present article is taken from section 3 411 consisting of 32 entries the integrands are combi nations of rational functions of powers and exponentials and the domain of integration is the whole real line or the half line 0 there is a single exception entry 3 411 5 states that 1 19 ln 2 0 x dx 1 e x 2 12 the next section presents an elementary proof of 1 19 2 a reduction argument the expansion of the integrand in 1 19 as a geometric series yields 2 1 x 1 e x x k 1 xe kx term by term integration produces the following expressions 2 2 a 0 x dx 1 e x dx 1 2 a 2 k 1 e ak k 2 k 1 1 k 2 a k 1 e ak k the complexity of these three series decreases as one moves from left to right we now compute each term in 2 2 individually the third series integrating the geometric series k 0 xk 1 1 x yields n 1 xn n ln 1 x which is valid for x 1 evaluating at x e a gives 2 3 k 1 e ak k ln 1 e a the second series the riemann zeta function 2 4 s n 1 1 ns plays a prominent role in the evaluation of the remaining 31 entries in section 3 411 indeed the first of these 2 5 0 x 1 dx e x 1 1 is the classical integral representation for it is becoming that the special value 2 6 2 2 6 appears as the second series in 2 2 an elementary proof 5 the first series the second series in 2 2 is the only remaining part we are alluding to the function k 1 xk k 2 evaluated at x e a this is the famous polylogarithm studied by euler see the introduction to 8 for a historical perspective aside from the series representation 2 7 polylog 2 x k 1 xk k 2 there is a natural integral expression 2 8 polylog 2 x x 0 ln 1 t t dt therefore the identity 2 2 reduces to 2 9 a 0 x dx 1 e x 1 2 a 2 polylog 2 e a 2 6 a ln 1 e a and entry 3 411 5 corresponds to the special value 2 10 polylog 2 1 2 2 12 1 2 ln 2 2 equivalently 2 11 k 1 1 2 k 1 k 2 2 6 ln 2 2 euler proved the functional equation 2 12 polylog 2 x polylog 2 1 x 2 6 lnx ln 1 x for the polylogarithm function in particular the case x 1 2 gives 2 11 3 an elementary computation of the first series a series for ln 2 2 can be obtained by squaring ln 2 n 1 1 n 2 n so that ln 2 2 n 1 1 n 2 n m 1 1 m 2 m n m 1 1 nm 2 n m r 1 r 1 m 1 1 r m m 1 2 r the partial fraction decomposition 1 r m m 1 r 1 m 1 r m gives 3 1 ln 2 2 r 1 hr 1 r 2 r 1 6 t amdeberhan and v moll where hr 1 1 1 2 1 r 1 is the harmonic number therefore ln 2 2 k 1 1 2 k 1 k 2 r 1 hr 1 r 2 r 1 k 1 1 2 k 1 k 2 r 1 1 r 2 r 1 hr 1 1 r r 1 hr r 2 r 1 it remains to verify that this last series is in fact 2 the representation of the harmonic number as 3 2 hr 1 0 1 xr 1 x dx gives the desired step indeed if cr is a sequence of real numbers and is fixed then 3 3 r 1 crhr r 1 0 1 1 x r 1 1 xr cr r dx thus the function 3 4 f x r 1 crx r appears in the integral representation 3 5 r 1 crhr r 1 0 f f x 1 x dx in the present case cr 1 r 2 r 1 and f x 2 ln 1 x 2 therefore 3 6 r 1 hr r 2 r 1 1 0 2 ln 2 2 ln 1 x 2 1 x dx 2 1 0 ln 1 y y dy this last integral is computable via 1 1 and we have come full circle the technique described above in exhibiting an elementary proof of 2 11 can be applied to 3 7 n 1 hn 1 n 2 3 j borwein and d
