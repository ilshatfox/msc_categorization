various fields of analysis the drawback of such an approach is that any of its consequences should be validated by a more rigorous procedure this is indeed the case of the ramanujan master theorem 1 2 according to which if a function f x can be expanded around x 0 in a power series of the form f x n 0 n n x n 1 with 0 f 0 6 0 then 0 x 1 f x dx 2 where z is the euler s gamma function the rigorous proof of this identity has been obtained in ref 3 4 the simpler but heuristic proof is given in 5 6 it is based on setting f x n 0 c n n x n 0 e c x 0 3 with c being an umbral operator such that 7 c n 0 n 4 the theorem has been exploited in 5 6 in a generalized version to obtain in a very simple way old and new formulas for integrals and successive derivatives of bessel functions the noticeable feature emerging from such a procedure is that cylindrical bessel functions can be formally treated as functions involving the operator c for example the n th order cylindrical bessel function can be written as jn 2 x c x ne c x 2 0 n 1 1 n 5 according to the above restyling and by taking the freedom of treating c as an ordinary constant an interesting plethora of new results concerning integrals of bessel functions and their derivatives can be obtained just to give an example of how the method works we consider the integral b 0 x j 2 x e i x 2 dx 0 0 6 2 the use of eq 5 allows to treat this integral as an elementary integral of exponential type and indeed under the hypothesis 2 4 we find b 1 2 2 2 i 1 b i 2 4 7 where we have introduced the function b x k 0 k 1 2 k 1 xk k 2 x 1 2 e x 2 i 1 2 x 2 i 1 2 x 2 where i z is the modified bessel function 10 in the case 0 eq 7 gives b 0 i 2 exp i 2 4 8 in agreement with eqs 6 728 3 and 6 728 4 of 8 and eq 2 12 18 7 of 9 we consider now the struve function 10 h x k 0 1 k x 2 2 k 1 k 3 2 k 3 2 9 that can be rewritten with the umbral operator h as h x x 2 1 exp h x 2 2 0 10 with n h n 0 n 1 n 3 2 n 3 2 11 by applying our method and using the euler s reflection formula for gamma functions we find 0 h bx dx 1 b 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 b tan 2 2 re 0 b 0 12 that is formula 6 811 1 of 8 further application of eq 10 furnishes x 1 h x dx 2 h 1 2 0 2 1 13 see formula 6 813 2 of 8 it is evident that the method can easily be applied also to more complicated integrals involving the struve functions as a further evidence of the usefulness of the method we apply it to the search of close form of the following generating function g x t m n 0 tn n jmn 2 x 14 3 with the help of eq 5 it can be written as g x t m exp c x m t c x 2 0 15 if we introduce the higher m 2 order hermite polynomials 11 h m n u v n n m k 0 un mk vk n mk k 16 their generating function is 11 13 n 0 zn n h m n u v exp uz vz m 17 note that h 2 n x y i n yn 2 hn ix 2 y where hn z are conventional hermite poly nomials 10 this allows us to recast eq 15 in the operator form g x t m n 0 c n n h m n x 2 xm t 0 18 furthermore as a consequence of the definitions 5 and 16 it is possible to show that g x t m hc m 0 x 2 x mt 19 where hc m n x y k 0 1 k k n k h m k x y 20 are the so called hermite based tricomi functions 14 the correctness of the above identity has been thoroughly checked numerically we stress that its derivation with conventional means is much more involved in the same spirit we will use operational methods to evaluate various families of integrals in particular we consider the integrals of the type i x f x g t dt 21 the identity 13 g t x xf x f x g t 22 can be used to write i x g t x xf x dt 23 4 and by assuming that the integral a constant f a g t a dt exists one can express i x as i x f x x f x 24 if the function f x admits a power series expansion f x k 0 k xmk p 25 as a consequence of the identity f x x x n f n xn 26 we get i x k 0 k f mk p xmk p 27 to clarify the content of this result we choose the case g t et 2 f x jn x by using eq 26 one has jn xe t 2 dt k 0 1 k k k n x 2 2 k n 2 k n n 0 28 the above series has been proved to be convergent and the correctness of the proposed procedure has been checked numerically as a further example we consider the evaluation of the integral 21 for g t 1 t 2 1 f x x 2 e x 2 since 1 t 2 a dt a 1 2 a 29 we get exp x 2 1 t 2 2 1 t 2 2 dt k 0 x 2 k k 2 k 3 2 2 k 2 2 2 f 2 3 4 5 4 1 3 2 x 2 30 where pfq a 1 ap b 1 bq y is the generalized hypergeometric function see 9 10 let us now consider the following laplace type transform integral l x 0 e t g x t dt 31 5 also known as the borel transform the use of eq 22 leads to the operatorial identity l x x x 1 g x 32 from which under the assumption that l x can be expanded as in eq 1 as a consequence of eq 26 one obtains g x k 0 k k 2 x k 33 see chap 2 of 15 for the use of the operator x x 1 the use of borel transform is of noticeable importance in the derivation of quantum chromodynamics qcd sum rules 16 for a general introduction see 17 we will just touch on this topic and leave further developments for a forthcoming paper just to quote a few examples we note that the polynomials given in eq 16 are the borel transform of their hybrid counterpart 18 h m n x y n m k 0 xn mk yk k n mk 2 m 2 34 if we choose g x t h m n x t y and treat y as a parameter they are called hybrid because they have properties in between those of hermite and laguerre polynomials it is worth stressing that the borel transform with respect to the y variable namely choosing g yt h m n x yt is e m n x y n m k 0 xn mk yk n mk 2 corresponding to a family of truncated polynomials see 20 21 for discussions of related polynomial families furthermore for g x 1 xm 1 x 1 we find that the associated transform is the pseudo trigonometric function 19 c m 0 x where c m k x r 0 1 r xmr k mr k 0 k m 35 the following relationship can be viewed as an extension of the borel transform i x 1 0 u 1 1 u 1 f u x du re re 0 36 by using eq 22 this integral can be written in terms of the beta function as follows i x b x x f x i e in terms of the gamma function i x x x x x f x 37 6 if the function f x satisfies eq 1 one has i x n 0 n n x n 38 where n b n n 39 in conclusion in this paper we have provided a few elements proving the usefulness of formal procedures to get results encompassing various aspects of operators and of special functions other examples could be discussed to corroborate the validity of the method we believe however that the main plot of the whole technique can be quite well understood via the examples discussed here in closing we remark that the results we have obtained are at the level of sound conjectures the relevant rigorous proof of them is out of the scope of the present article there are similar techniques that kept being revived see for example 22 and references therein acknowledgements one of us g d
