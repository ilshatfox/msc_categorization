factorizing the three bases of sym metric polynomials monomial symmetric functions m x elementary sym metric polynomials e x and schur functions s x into products of uni variate polynomials 1 introduction in our recent paper 1 written together with v v mangazeev we used the lore of the quantum integrability to provide a new insight into the theory of symmetric polynomials the main result of 1 is a construction of a separation of variables for the jack polynomials we have explicitly described an integral operator sn depend ing on the parameter which maps any jack polynomial p x of n variables x 1 xn x labelled by a partition of length n into a product n j 1 q zj of univariate polynomials q z some other integral operators closely related to sn were also constructed and studied in case of the generic jack polynomials the proofs presented in 1 are quite involved and the simple underlying philosophy of the separation of variables is somewhat overshadowed by the abundant technicalities the purpose of the present paper is to provide a gentler pedagogical introduction into the subject of 1 we revise the results of 1 for the three degenerate cases of the jack polynomials corresponding to the three particular values of the parameter these are the three well known bases of symmetric polynomials monomial symmetric functions m x elementary symmetric polynomials e x and schur functions s x corresponding respectively to the values 0 and 1 of the parameter for these cases the constructions of 1 simplify drastically and we provide an independent elementary proof for each of the three cases let c x be the ring of polynomials in x 1 xn and c x sn be the corre sponding subring of symmetric polynomials the three bases m x e x and s x in the ring c x sn we are going to work with are all labelled by partitions 1 2 n n n 1 2 n 0 of length n the weight of a 1991 mathematics subject classification 33 58 f 07 c 0000 copyright holder 1 http arxiv org abs math 0501257 v 2 2 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin partition being defined as 1 1 n i 1 i the dominance partial ordering for two partitions and is defined as follows 1 2 k j 1 j k j 1 j k 1 n 1 we shall often use the notation i j i j in particular i i 1 i i 1 assuming n 1 0 so that n n 1 n for the rest of this section p x will denote a member of any of the three polynomial families in question in our analysis of the three cases we shall follow the unified plan first we describe a family of n commuting differential operators hj n j 1 whose joint eigen functions are the polynomials p x 1 3 hj hk 0 hjp hj p j 1 n with hj being the corresponding eigenvalues thus the above spectral problem puts the polynomials p x into the framework of the theory of quantum integrable systems it is convenient for our purposes to replace the standard normalization of the polynomials p x by the condition of the unit value at the special point 1 1 1 for any polynomial p x thus define the polynomial p x p x p 1 p 1 1 we introduce then the polynomial q z c z by fixing all the arguments of p x except one 1 4 q z p z 1 1 q 1 1 and the operator qz c x sn 7 c x sn c z by its eigenvectors and eigenvalues 1 5 qzp q z p the crucial point is that the operator qz which we call q operator admits a simple description in terms independent of the basis p note that by definition the operators qz commute 1 6 qz 1 qz 2 0 z 1 z 2 c we show that the polynomials q z satisfy an ordinary differential equation in z with the coefficients depending linearly on all eigenvalues hj of the operators hj the aforementioned differential equation in z bears the name separation equa tion in other words the eigenvalue q z of the q operator solves the multiparam eter spectral problem arising in the process of separation of variables therefore these univariate polynomials become separated polynomials in the unified approach to the method of separation of variables which is explained below the next step is to take the composition of n copies of the q operator qz 1 qzn and the linear functional 1 7 0 c x sn 7 c f x 7 f 1 as a consequence of the commutativity 1 6 of qz the resulting operator 1 8 sn 0 qz 1 qzn factorization of symmetric polynomials 3 acts from c x sn into c z sn and factorizes the polynomials p x 1 9 sn p x 7 n j 1 q zj into products of the univariate polynomials q z in this way the original spectral problem 1 3 gets mapped into a multiparameter spectral problem for the factorized eigenfunctions n j 1 q zj the expression 1 8 can be simplified due to the existence of additional rela tions between 0 and qz define k k 0 n 1 as 1 10 k c xk 1 xn sn k 7 c f xk 1 xn 7 f 1 1 and let n 1 we prove then that there exist operators 1 11 ak c x 1 xk sk 7 c x 1 xk 1 sk 1 c zk k 1 n such that 1 12 k 1 qzk ak k see 1 proposition 6 1 using the commutation relations 1 12 we can transform the original expression 0 qz 1 qzn for sn into a 1 1 qz 2 qzn then into a 1 a 2 2 qz 3 qzn etc and finally using n 1 into 1 13 sn a 1 a 2 an see 1 theorem 6 1 the factorization 1 13 of the operator sn exhibits a trian gularity property in the sense that each operator ak acts on k variables only applying the relations 1 12 to the polynomial p x we get a set of remarkable equalities 1 14 ak p x 1 xk 1 1 7 p x 1 xk 1 1 1 q zk note that the equalities 1 14 cannot be used to define the operators ak di rectly because the restricted polynomials p x 1 xk 1 1 are not linearly independent in the space c x 1 xk sk and consequently 1 14 contain a lot of nontrivial identities another application of the operator qz is to produce the operators raising the number of variables in the polynomials p as shown in 1 in case of generic jack polynomials the operator qz taken at z 0 can be decomposed uniquely 1 15 q 0 q 0 p into the projector p c x 1 xn sn 7 c x 1 xn 1 sn 1 1 16 f x 1 xn 7 f x 1 xn 1 0 and an operator 1 17 q 0 c x 1 xn 1 sn 1 7 c x 1 xn sn the operator q 0 can be used then to add an extra variable xn to the polyno mials p 1 n 1 1 18 q 0 p 1 n 1 x 1 xn 1 7 p 1 n 10 x 1 xn 4 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin in the next three sections the program sketched above is

symmetric in particular for the monomials xa we have qzx 1 n n j 1 zdjx 1 n n j 1 z j x q z x averaging the monomials x over the permutation group with 2 2 we recover 2 7 2 d separation of variables proposition 2 2 for the separating operator sn defined by the formula 1 8 and satisfying 1 9 for p m there exist uniquely defined operators ak satisfying the relations 1 12 proof applying the both sides of 1 12 to a polynomial f c x sn and using the formula 2 8 b for qzf and the definition 1 10 of k we obtain k 1 qzf x 1 xn 1 n f zx 1 x 2 xk 1 1 1 2 9 1 n f x 1 xk 2 zxk 1 1 1 1 n f x 1 xk 1 z 1 1 1 n f x 1 xk 1 1 1 z the last n k 1 terms are all equal due to the symmetry of f the right hand side of 2 9 has obviously the form ak k where the operator ak is described in terms of the projector operators pjk j k defined as 2 10 pjkf x 1 xn f jth xjxk kth 1 6 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin it is convenient to identify the variable zk in the target space 1 11 for ak with xk the formula for ak in terms of pjk is then 2 11 ak 1 n n k 1 k 1 j 1 pjk a 1 1 note that the formula 2 11 allows to extend the operator ak to all nonsym metric polynomials from c x it is not obvious at all that product of ak maps symmetric polynomials into symmetric nevertheless the above analysis shows that it is true using the relations 2 12 pjkplk pjk j l 1 k 1 for the projectors pjk it is easy to invert ak 2 13 a 1 k 1 n k 1 n k 1 j 1 pjk k 1 n the above inversion formula for ak seems to be a peculiarity of the monomial functions case its analogs for the generic jack polynomials are unknown 2 e lifting operator letting z 0 in 2 8 b and using the symmetry of a polynomial f c x sn we can shuffle the arguments x to obtain 2 14 q 0 f x 7 1 n n j 1 f x xj 0 1 n n j 1 f x 1 x j xn 0 the hat over xj marking the omitted argument using the formula 2 14 for q 0 and 1 15 we get the expression for the action of the operator q 0 on a polynomial f c x 1 xn 1 sn 1 2 15 q 0 f x 1 xn 1 7 1 n n j 1 f x 1 x j xn proposition 2 3 the operator q 0 defined by 2 15 acts on the basis m as follows 2 16 q 0 m 1 n 1 x 1 xn 1 7 m 1 n 10 x 1 xn proof the formula 2 15 defines q 0 for nonsymmetric polynomials from c x 1 xn 1 as well on the monomials we have q 0 x 1 1 x n 1 n 1 7 1 n n j 1 x 11 x j 1 j 1 x 0 jx j j 1 x n 1 n after having symmetrized the left hand side over sn 1 we obtain in the right hand side the average over sn hence 2 16 factorization of symmetric polynomials 7 3 factorizing the basis e x 3 a basis e x for each partition 1 n define the polynomials e x as 3 1 e x e 1 2 1 x e 2 3 2 x e n n x where ej j 1 n are elementary symmetric functions defined in 2 3 2 4 the polynomials e form a basis in c x sn see 2 noticing that ej 1 n j we introduce the normalized polynomials 3 2 e j x ej x ej 1 e x n j 1 e j x j j 1 such that e j 1 1 and e 1 1 3 b operators hj note that the polynomials e x are already given in a factorized form by the definition 3 1 the corresponding separation of variables is obtained by taking j ej x as independent variables and using the isomorphism c x sn c the substitution ej x j produces the separating linear operator 3 3 s 0 n c x sn 7 c e x 7 n j 1 j j 1 j the monomials s 0 n e are obviously the eigenfunctions of the commuting dif ferential operators dj in variables 3 4 dj j j djs 0 n e j j 1 s 0 n e j 1 n it is an easy exercise to express the operators dj in terms of the original variables x indeed using the generating function 2 4 for j and taking the logarithmic differential of the both sides one obtains 3 5 n i 1 t 1 txi dxi n j 1 tj n m 1 1 txm d j comparing the residues at the poles one gets 3 6 dxi n j 1 xj n j n m 6 i xm xi d j i 1 n then 3 7 j n i 1 xi n j n m 6 i xm xi xi j 1 n and finally 3 8 hj s 0 n 1 djs 0 n ej x n i 1 xi n j n m 6 i xm xi xi j 1 n as a consequence the operators hj mutually commute and have the functions e x as their eigenfunctions 3 9 hj hk 0 hje x j j 1 e x j 1 n 8 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin the factorizing operator sn obtained from the constructions of 1 in the limit 0 and described below is however different from s 0 n described above illus trating thus the point that a separation of variables is not unique both operators sn and s 0 n correspond to the same set of commuting differential operators hj but the separated functions and the separated equations are different 3 c q operator define the operator qz by its eigenvectors e x and eigen values 3 10 qz e 7 q z e q z e z 1 1 n j 1 e j z 1 1 j j 1 3 11 n j 1 1 z 1 n j j j 1 the polynomial q z is the unique polynomial solution of the differential equa tion 3 12 dq z dz n j 1 j j 1 z n j j q z satisfying the normalization condition q 1 1 the factorized structure of the polynomials e x and q z implies that the action of the operator qz on polynomials from c x sn is determined uniquely by its action on the elementary symmetric functions j 3 13 qz j ej x 7 1 z 1 n j j the formula 3 13 can be written in terms of the generating function 2 4 as follows 3 14 qz wn t 7 1 z 1 n t d dt wn t using the isomorphism c x sn c we observe that qz acts on a polynomial f c by substitution 3 15 qz f 1 n 7 f qz 1 qz n in fact all operators we are going to construct in this section sn ak q 0 share with qz the same property of acting on c by substitutions 3 d separation of variables the separating operator sn is defined by the formula 1 8 by virtue of 1 9 it acts on the basis e x as follows 3 16 sn e x 7 n j 1 q zj as explained above the formula 3 16 implies that the operator sn acts on c by substitutions 3 17 sn j 7 n j n i 1 1 zi 1 n j factorization of symmetric polynomials 9 note the normalization factor n j ej 1 in the right hand side theorem 3 1 for the separating operator sn defined above there exist uniquely defined operators ak satisfying the relations 1 12 and thus 1 13 proof applying the hypothetic operator equality 1 12 to the basis e x we get the system of relations 1 14 for p e the existence and uniqueness of the operators ak will be established when we prove that the overdetermined system 1 14 has a unique solution because of the factorized nature of the polynomials e x and q x it is sufficient to consider the relations 1 14 for the elementary symmetric functions ej x only the resulting equations determining the action of ak on kej are 3 18 ak kej 1 zk 1 n j k 1 ej j 1 n the system 3 18 is apparently overdetermined because it counts n equations for only k independent quantities contained in kej note that kej depend only on the variables x 1 xk to prove that the equations 3 18 are nevertheless consistent let us sum them with the factor tj and use the correspondence 3 13 3 14 to get 3 19 ak kwn t 1 zk 1 n t d dt k 1 wn t from the definition 1 10 it follows that 3 20 kwn

function in variables x 1 xk remarkably because of the cancellation of the factor 1 t n k the resulting system contains only k equations determining thus uniquely the action of ak on e k j 3 e lifting operator proposition 3 1 the operator qz taken at z 0 admits a unique factoriza tion 1 15 into the projector p 1 16 and the operator q 0 1 17 3 23 q 0 e 1 n 1 x 1 xn 1 7 e 1 n 10 x 1 xn 10 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin proof as usual it is sufficient to consider the action of the studied operators on the elementary symmetric functions ej only setting z 0 in 3 13 we get q 0 e n j 7 n j

the normalized polynomials 3 2 we get q 0 e n 1 j 7 e n j j 1 n 1 hence 3 23 4 factorizing the basis s x 4 a basis s x let n 1 n 2 0 and 4 1 1 n 1 n 1 1 n for any partition the schur function s x is defined then as the ratio of two antisymmetric polynomials 4 2 s x det x j i det x j i a x a x where 4 3 a x det x j i x 1 1 x 2 1 x n 1 x 1 2 x 2 2 x n 2 x 1 n x 2 n x n n and a x is the vandermonde determinant n x 4 4 a x det x j i n x i j xi xj note that the sign of n x differs from 1 by the factor 1 n n 1 2 in the formulas like 4 2 it is always assumed that in the expression under the det sign the index i is the number of the matrix row and j of the column lemma 4 1 the schur function evaluated at xk xn 1 is given by the formula 4 5 a s x 1 xk 1 1 1 a k x 1 xk 1 a k x 1 xk 1 k 1 n

given by induction in n k for k n the statement is obvious then set xk 1 1 in 4 5 b and expand 1 j in the kth row in powers of 1 1 1 n k 1 n k 1 the terms containing in powers n k are cancelled from the determinant by subtracting from kth row a linear combination of the lower rows as a result we get a k n k 1 ak 1 n k 1 the factor n k 1 n k 1 is cancelled then by the same factor in the expansion of the expression 4 5 c for a k in particular for k 1 we get from 4 5 the formula for the normalization factor 4 6 s 1 i j i j j i n n n 1 2 3 n 1 using 4 6 we define the normalized schur functions as s x s x s 1 so that s 1 1 4 b operators hj let c x an be the space of antisymmetric polynomials the multiplication by n x provides an isomorphism of linear spaces and the corresponding mapping of the bases 4 7 n x c x sn 7 c x an s x 7 a x see 4 2 and 4 4 the polynomials a x given by 4 3 are linear combinations of monomials x and therefore are eigenfunctions of the following commuting differential

1 from 4 5 c and n from 4 6 and cancelling the factorials we transform 4 12 into 4 13 q z n 1 z 1 n 1 a 2 z n n 1 z 1 n 1 z z a 2 z n noticing that by 4 5 b 4 14 a 2 z z 1 z 2 z n n 21 n 2 2 n 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 1 we expand the above determinant along the first row and cancelling the arising vandermonde determinants obtain 4 11 the polynomial z defined by 4 11 is a linear combination of the monomials z j j 1 n and therefore satisfies the differential equation 4 15 n j 1 z z j 0 the polynomiality of q z implies by virtue of 4 10 that the polynomial z is divisible by z 1 n 1 to verify this property directly note that the divisibility is equivalent to the relations 4 16 n j 1 kj cj 0 k 0 n 2 which taken together with the normalization condition q 1 1 expressed as 4 17 n j 1 n 1 j cj 1 follow from the identities n j 1 lj k 6 j j k l n 1 l 0 n 1 factorization of symmetric polynomials 13 which are obtained by setting t 0 in the partial fraction decomposition tl 1 n k 1 t k l n 1 n j 1 1 t j l 1 j k 6 j j k in fact the above properties can be used to characterize z proposition 4 2 the solution z to 4 15 is uniquely characterized by the conditions kz z 1 0 k 0 n 2 which ensure that the polynomial z is divisible by z 1 n 1 and by n 1 z z 1 1 which is equivalent to the normalization condition q 1 1 proof the general solution to 4 15 is n j 1 cjz j the divisibility by z 1 n 1 condition is equivalent then to the equations 4 16 and the normalization condition to the equation 4 17 solving the system of linear equations 4 16 4 17 for cj via cramer s formula we recover the unique solution 4 11 note that the differential equation 4 15 can be written also as z z n n k 1 1 khk z z n k 0 where hk ek are the eigenvalues of the operatorshk 4 9 the correspond ing differential equation for q z is 4 18 zn n k 1 1 khk z n k q z 0 z z z n 1 z 1 note that q z is the only up to a coefficient polynomial solution to 4 18 as usual we define the operator qz in c x sn through its eigenvectors s x and eigenvalues q z theorem 4 1 let z 1 and y 1 y 2 yn then for any f c x sn the value qzf y is given by the integral 4 19 qzf y n 1 z 1 n 1 n y x dx x 1 xn zy 1 yn n x f x where the integration domain x is defined by the inequalities 4 20 0 y 1 x 1 y 2 xn 1 yn xn the above formula is obtained by setting g 1 in the formula 4 2 in 1 here we present an elementary and independent proof proof from 4 20 it follows that xj yj for j 1 n hence x 1 xn y 1 yn the condition z 1 ensures then that the support of the delta function in 4 19 has a non empty intersection with the domain x since the schur functions s x form a basis in c x sn it is sufficient to verify 4 19 for f s 4 21 n 1 z 1 n 1 n y x dx x 1 xn zy 1 yn n x s x q z s y using the correspondence 4 7 of the symmetric and antisymmetric polyno mials as well as the formula 4 10 we reduce the task to verifying the equality 14 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin 4 22 x dx x 1 xn zy 1 yn a x a y z expanding the determinantal expression 4 3 for a x along the last row we get 4 23 a x n k 1 1 k nx kn detm k where the matrix m k is 4 24 m k ij x k i i 1 n 1 j 1 k n integrating 4 23 in the variable xn with the

further integration is performed independently for each row of the determinant 4 26 yi 1 yi dxi x jk 1 i y jk i 1 y jk i j k the difference jk j k is never 0 so there are no logarithms according to 4

from the formula 6 18 from 1 by setting g 1 the proof given below is basically a simplified proof of the proposition 6 1 from 1 the mismatch of signs with respect to 1 is due to a changed definition of n let us evaluate k 1 qzk in the left hand side of 1 12 using the definition 1 10 of k and the integral formula 4 19 for qz the operator k 1 sets n k 1 of the variables yj in 4 19 to the unit

due to the inequalities 4 20 the variables x 1 xn k are pinched between y s and therefore forced to tend to 1 as well which accounts for the factor k 1 in the right hand side ak k of 1 12 to calculate

sklyanin the formula 4 30 is proved by integrating independently in ui the i th row of the determinant representing n k u and using an identity similar to 4 28 collecting then all the factors and coefficients we finally get 4 29 a peculiar feature of the schur functions 1 case is a beautiful inversion formula for the operator sn theorem 4 3 the inverse of sn is the differential operator on c x sn given by the formula 4 31 s 1 n 1 n n 1 2 n 1 n n n x kn n k 1 xk 1 n 1 where kn is the differential operator 4 32 kn det d j i i j di dj di xi xi since s 1 n is a differential operator it is convenient to identify x and z variables and assume that s 1 n acts in c x sn the formula for s 1 n was mentioned in 3 without a proof and in a slightly different notation here we present a detailed derivation proof it is sufficient to verify that 4 33 s 1 n n j 1 q xj 7 s x using the formulae 4 2 for s x 4 4 for n x 4 6 for s 1 4 10 for q z and 4 11 for z we reduce the task to proving the equality 4 34 kn n i 1 xi 7 1 n n 1 2 a x n using the determinantal representation 4 32 for the operator kn we represent kn xi as the determinant of the matrix m 4 35 m j i d j i xi d j i n k 1 ckx k i n k 1 x k i ck j k the resulting expression is recognized as a product of three matrices therefore kn n i 1 xi det m j i det x j i det ci ij det j i 4 36 a x c 1 cn n to obtain 4 34 and thus conclude the proof it remains to substitute into the above formula the values of cn from 4 11 the differential operator kn appeared also in 4 though in a different context 4 e lifting operator proposition 4 3 the operator qz taken at z 0 admits a unique factoriza tion 1 15 into the projector p 1 16 and the operator q 0 1 17 4 37 q 0 s 1 n 1 x 1 xn 1 7 s 1 n 10 x 1 xn factorization of symmetric polynomials 17 for y 1 y 2 yn the value q 0 f y is given by the integral 4 38 q 0 f y 1 n 1 n 1 n y x dx n 1 x f x where x x 1 xn 1 and 4 39 x 0 y 1 x 1 y 2 xn 1 yn proof we cannot set z 0 directly in the integral 4 19 because of the re striction z 1 instead we shall use the definition of qz in terms of its eigenvectors s x and eigenvalues q z in what follows we have to be careful to distinguish the partitions of length n and n 1 let 1 n and 1 n 1 respectively 1 n and 1 n 1 where i n i i i n 1 i note that i i 1 for i 1 n 1 from 4 10 and 4 11 it follows that q 0 is nonzero only for n n 0 in this case 4 40 q 1 n 10 0 n 1 n 1 i 1 i similarly from 4 2 and 4 3 we conclude that ps does not vanish only for n 0 and 4 41 s 1 n 10 x 1 xn 1 0 s 1 n 1 x 1 xn 1 using 4 6 we get respectively for the normalized schur functions 4 42 s 1 n 10 x 1 xn 1 0 n 1 n 1 i 1 i s 1 n 1 x 1 xn 1 from the last formula together with 4 40 the factorization 1 15 and the formula 4 37 follow immediately the integral formula 4 38 can be obtained in principle by setting g 1 in the formula 7 10 from 1 and taking into account the different definition of n we provide however an independent proof it is sufficient to verify 4 38 on the basis f s x using 4 2 and 4 6 and cancelling the arising coefficients we reduce the problem to verifying the identity 4 43 x dx a x 1 n 1 n 1 i 1 i a y to prove the last identity we integrate independently in xi from yi to yi 1 each row of the determinant representing a x and then use i i 1 and a variant of the determinantal identity 4 28 5 concluding remarks we have considered three important standard bases in the linear space of symmet ric polynomials in n variables these bases have been related to the special cases of the jack polynomials which in their turn solve the famous quantum integrable system calogero sutherland model the main objective was to demonstrate the main features of the quantum separation of variables which is designed to pro duce explicit factorization and representation for the multivariate special functions through the application of suitable integral operators 18 vadim b kuznetsov and evgeny k sklyanin the method of quantum separation of variable has its counterpart in the classi cal hamiltonian mechanics which is applicable to a wide class of liouville integrable systems usually it is the classical system that gets separated in the first place followed by the problem of quantization for the three bases considered in this paper such approach is valid only for the e one because the jack s parameter is proportional to the plank constant the two other bases m and s do not have classical analogs so that the separation of variables that we have found for them in this paper is purely quantum in this paper we considered polynomials symmetric under permutation group sn or weyl group of the root system an 1 it is a challenging problem to find the factorizing operators for the bases of polynomials symmetric with respect to weyl groups corresponding to other root systems such as for example bn cn or dn 5 6 references 1 v b kuznetsov v v mangazeev and e k sklyanin q operator and factorized separa tion
