transformation states that for a function f and a b 0 the integral of f x 2 and af ax bx 1 2 over the interval 0 are the same this elementary result is used to evaluate many non elementary definite integrals most of which cannot be obtained by symbolic packages applications to probability distributions is also given 1 introduction the problem of analytic evaluations of definite integrals has been of interest to scientists for a long time the central question can be stated as follows given a class of functions f and an interval a b r express the integral of f f i b a f x dx in terms of special values of functions in an enlarged class g many methods for the evaluation of definite integrals have been developed since the early stages of integral calculus which resulted in a variety of ad hoc techniques for producing closed form expressions although a general procedure applicable to all integrals is undoubtedly unattainable it is within reason to expect a systematic cataloguing procedure for large groups of definite integrals to this effect one of the authors has instituted a project to verify all the entries in the popular table by i s gradshteyn and i m ryzhik 13 the website http www math tulane edu vhm web html pap index html contains a series of papers as a treatment to the above alluded project naturally any document containing a large number of entries such as the table 13 or the encyclopedic treatise 20 is likely to contain errors many of which arising from transcription from other tables the earliest extensive table of integrals still accessible is 2 compiled by bierens de haan who also presented in 3 a survey of the methods employed in the verification of the entries from 13 these tables form the main source for 13 the revision of integral tables

been developed for evaluating definite integrals and the goal of this paper is to present one such method popularized by schlo milch in 24 the identity 2 1 below appeared in 6 where it was called the schlo milch transform although it was used by j liouville 18 to evaluate the integral 1 1 1 0 t 1 2 1 t 1 2 dt a bt ct 2 1 and in 19 liouville quotes a letter from schlo milch in which he describes his approach to 1 1 via the formula 1 2 0 f x x dx x 1 0 f 2 y dy y to derive the reduction 1 3 0 xm 1 2 dx x x 2 m 1 1 0 y 1 2 m dy 2 y m 1 the integral 1 1 is then evaluated in terms of the beta function schlo milch also states that his method can be found in a note by a cauchy 8 published some 35 years earlier 1 in view of this historical precedence the name cauchy schlo milch adopted here seems to be more justified some illustrative examples appear in the text 21 we present here a variety of definite integrals evaluated by use of the schlo milch transform and its extensions several of the examples are not computable by the current symbolic languages for each evaluation presented in the upcoming sec tions we considered its computation using mathematica naturally the statement the integral can not be computed symbolically has to be complemented with the phrase at the present date 2 the cauchy schlo milch transformation in this section we present the basic result accompanied with initial examples further applications are discussed in the remaining sections theorem 2 1 cauchy schlo milch let a b 0 and assume that f is a continuous function for which the integrals in 2 1 are convergent then 0 f ax bx 1 2 dx 1 a 0 f y 2 dy 2 1 proof the change of variables t b ax yields i 0 f ax b x 2 dx b a 0 f at b t 2 t 2 dt the average of these two representations followed by the change of variables u ax b x completes the proof the next result is a direct consequence of theorem 2 1 1 this note is available at http gallica bnf fr ark 12148 bpt 6 k 90193 x zoom f 526 the cauchy

parameters the introduction of parameters in a definite integral provides a greater flexibility in its evaluation many classical integrals are presented in 5 as special cases of the next theorem which now appears as 3 242 2 in 13 the proof given below is in the spirit of the original observation of a cauchy theorem 4 1 let i 1 0 x 2 x 4 2 ax 2 1 c x 2 1 xb 1 dx x 2 i 2 0 x 2 x 4 2 ax 2 1 c dx x 2 i

statistical literature in generat ing flexible families of probability distributions for univariate continuous random variables baker 1 describes the use of cauchy schlo milch transformation to gen erate new probability density functions from old ones jones 14 does the same with the extended transformation of section 11 the identity 11 3 states that the total mass of f y 2 is the same as that of af ax s ax 2 for any self inverse function s and any scaling constant a 0 there are many techniques for introducing one or more parameters into a sim ple parent distribution with probability density function g to produce more so phisticated distributions one such method not generally familiar proceeds by transformation of scale defining fb x g tb x where tb x depends on the new parameter b the difficulty associated with this procedure is the validation that fb is integrable and then to explicitly provide its normalizing constant the cauchy schlo milch result in theorem 2 1 guarantees that the choice tb x x bx 1 produces from the density g of a positive random variable a new density fb also for a positive random variable via 12 1 fb x g x bx 1 this was observed by baker 1 the parameter a in 2 1 is redundant for distri bution theory work since its action as a scale parameter is well understood a must however be reintroduced for practical fitting of such distributions to data a number of general properties of distributions with density of the form fb follow some of which are i fb is r symmetric 22 about r center b i e fb bx fb bx 1 the cauchy schlo milch transformation 17 ii fb 0 0 and fb x g b x as x 0 fb x g x as x iii moment relationships follow from efb x bx 1 r eg y r and by r symmetry efb x r br 1 efb x r 2 iv if g is decreasing then fb is unimodal with mode at b v if fb is unimodal its mean and its median are both greater than its mode these properties can be found in baker 1 but only special cases of iii are pro vided amongst the most interesting distributions presented by baker is the root reciprocal inverse gaussian distribution rrig this example also discussed in mudholkar and wang 22 in the case of dispersion parameter 1 arises from 12 1 when g is the half gaussian density the rrig density is 12 2 fb x 2 eb exp 1 2 x 2 b 2 x 2 b 0 this corresponds in integral terms to 3 3 above similarly a second example presented by baker 1 section 3 4 is the distribution based on the half subbotin distribution this is directly linked to 3 5 a third example based on the half t distribution has density 12 3 f b x 2 1 2 2 1 x b x 2 1 2 b 0 the verification that f b x integrates to 1 can be done by using the integral i 3 in theorem 4 1 of course other distributions in baker 1 correspond to other integral formulae while integral formulae in this article which have non negative integrands correspond to other distributions transformation of scale densities are particularly amenable to having their skew ness assessed by the asymmetry function p 0 p 1 of critchley and jones 9 and provide relatively rare tractable examples thereof jones 14 shows that the asymmetry function associated with unimodal fb is 12 4 b p c 2 g p 4 b 4 b cg p where cg p g 1 pg 0 this shows that the cauchy schlo milch transformation of scale always results in positively skewed distributions with asymmetry functions decreasing in p which become more skew as b decreases for example for the rrig density 12 2 12 5 b p 2 b log p 2 b log p the extended cauchy schlo milch transformation described in section 11 also af fords new transformation of scale distributions as explored by jones 14 proba bility densities of the form 12 6 fs x g x s x 18 t amdeberhan m l glasser m c jones v moll r posey and d varela for decreasing onto self inverse s are described there in this situation properties i v discussed above become i fs can be defined to be s symmetric about s center x 0 since fs x fs s x here x 0 is defined by s x 0 x 0 ii fs 0 0 and fs x g s x as x 0 fs x g x as x iii moment relationships follow from efs x s x r eg y r and by s symmetry efs x r efs s x sr x a special case of the latter is that efs s x 1 iv if g is decreasing then fs is unimodal with mode at x 0 v if fs is unimodal and g is convex its mean and its median are both greater than its mode by way of example jones 14 briefly explored the half gaussian based analogue of 12 2 when s x is given by 11 4 this has probability density 12 7 fs x 2 exp 1 2 2 log 2 e x 1 the fact that 12 7 integrates to 1 is closely related to 11 6 its asymmetry function has the form 12 8 s p 1 log p 2 log cosh log p 2 like 12 5 this asymmetry function is always positive and decreases in p 12 8 increases in the cauchy schlo lmilch transformation has thus motivated and triggers a new and promising area of work in distribution theory 13 conclusions the cauchy schlo milch transformation establishes the equality of two definite integrals with integrands related in a simple manner applying this transformation to a variety of well known definite integrals yields examples that are beyond the current capabilities of symbolic languages our purpose in this paper is not only to present the many integrals considered here but also to give an exposition of the salient points of the cauhy schlo milch transformation so as to serve as motivating examples to explore further symbolic integration algorithms
