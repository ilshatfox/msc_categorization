that are related to elliptic integrals we present a systematic derivation of some of them 1 introduction elliptic integrals were at the center of analysis at the end of 19 th century the complete elliptic integral of the first kind defined by 1 1 k k 1 0 dx 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 is a function of the so called modulus k 2 the corresponding complete elliptic integral of the second kind defined by 1 2 e k 1 0 1 k 2 x 2 1 x 2 dx the total collection of complete elliptic integrals contains one more the so called complete elliptic integral of the third kind defined by 1 3 n k 1 0 dx 1 n 2 x 2 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 the complementary integrals are defined by 1 4 k k k k where k 1 k 2 is the so called complementary modulus the change of variables x sin t yields the trigonometric versions 1 5 k k 2 0 dt 1 k

for n k in general an elliptic integral is one of the form 1 6 i b a p x dx y where y 2 is a cubic or quartic polynomial in x the integral is called complete if a and b are roots of y 0 it is clear that k k is elliptic the same is true for e k written in the form 1 7 e k 1 0 1 k 2 x 2 dx 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 2 some examples in this section we offer some evaluations from 4 that follow directly from the definitions some special values are offered first the evaluations of these integrals is facilitated by legendre s relation 2 1 k k e k k k e k k k k k 2 the reader will find this identity as exercise 4 in section 2 4 of 7 example 2 1 2 2 k 1 1 4 2 2 1 4 the proof is direct the integral is 2 3 k 1 1 0 dx 1 x 4 1 4 1 0 y 3 4 1 y 1 2 dy 1 4 1 2 4 3 4 the result now follows from the symmetry rule 2 4 a 1 a sin a for the gamma function and the special value 1 2 this example appear as entry 3 166 16 in 4 entry 3 166 18 states that 2 5 1 0 x 2 dx 1 x 4 1 2 2 3 4 the proof consists of a reduction to a special value of the beta function the change of variables t x 4 gives 2 6 1 0 x 2 dx 1 x 4 1 4 1 0 t 1 4 1 t 1 2 dt this integral is 1 4 b 3 4 1 2 the simplified result is obtained as above formula 1 7 with k 1 shows that 2 7 e 1 1 0 1 x 2 1 x 4 dx elliptic integrals 3 the values given above show that 2 8 e 1 1 4 2 2 1 4 4 2 3 4 example 2 2 2 9 k 1 2 1 4 2 1 4 this appears as entry 8 129 1 in 4 this value comes from the previous example and the identity 2 10 k 1 k 1 1 k 2 k k 1 k 2 with k 1 the identity 2 10 follows by the change of variables x 7 x 1 k 2 1 x 2 in the left hand side integral the values of the modulus k for which k k is the square root of an integer are of considerable interest these are called the singular values the previous example shows that 1 2 is the simplest of them in this case 2 11 k k 1 2 1 a list of the first few values kr for which 2 12 k k kr r is given in 3 and it starts with k 2 2 1 k 3 2 3 1 4 k 4 3 2 2 k 5 1 2 5 1 3 5 3 an elementary transformation elementary manipulations can be emploted to evaluate certain entries in 4 for instance direct integration by parts on the integrals defining the functions k and e produces 3 1 1 0 x arcsin x 1 k 2 x 2 3 dx 1 k 2 2 k k k and 3 2 1 0 x arcsin x 1 k 2 x 2 dx 1 k 2 e k 2 k this last evaluation appears as entry 4 522 4 in 4 on the other hand several entries in 4 may be evaluated also by integration by parts choosing the inverse trigonometric term to be differentiated such procedure gives 4 s boettner and v moll 3 3 1 0 x arccos x dx 1 k 2 x 2 1 k 2 2 e k that appears as entry 4 522 5 3 4 1 0 x arcsin x dx k 2 k 2 x 2 1 k 2 2 e k that appears as entry 4 522 6 and finally 4 522 7 3 5 1 0 x arccos x dx k 2 k 2 x 2 1 k 2 2 k e k in this section we derive a different type of elementary transformation for integrals and use it to obtain the value of some elliptic integrals appearing in 4 lemma 3 1 let f be an odd periodic function of period a then 3 6 0 f x x dx a a 2 0 f x tan x a dx proof the result follows by splitting the integral as 0 f x x dx k 0 a 0 f x x ka dx k 0 a 2 0 f x 1 x ka 1 k 1 a x dx and using the partial fraction decomposition 3 7 tan b 2 4 b j 1 1 2 j 1 2 b 2 given as entry 1 421 1 in 4 corollary 3 1 let f be an even function with period a then 3 8 0 f x x sin x a dx a a 2 0 f x dx in particular for a 3 9 0 f x x sinx dx 2 0 f x dx proof apply the lemma to the function f x sin x a which is odd and it has period 2 a the result follows from the half angle formula 3 10 tan x 2 sinx 1 cosx and the value 3 11 a 0 f x cos x a dx 0 elliptic integrals 5 a similar results holds for odd functions these appear as entry 3 033 in 4 corollary 3 2 let f be an odd function with period a then 3 12 0 f x x sin x a dx a a 2 0 f x cos x a dx in particular for a 3 13 0 f x x sinx dx 2 0 f x cosx dx example 3 1 the function f x 1 and a in corollary 3 1 gives the classical integral 3 14 0 sinx x dx 2 this is entry 3 721 1 in 4 the reader will find in 5 6 a couple of articles by g h hardy with an evaluation of the many proofs of this identity these papers are available in volume 5 of his complete works example 3 2 entry 3 842 3 of 4 consists of four evaluations the first of which 3 15 0 sinx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x k k this follows from corollary 3 1 by choosing a and f x 1 1 k 2 sin 2 x a different proof of this evaluation is offered in section 6 below example 3 3 a second integral appearing in 3 842 3 is 3 16 0 sinx 1 k 2 cos 2 x dx x k k also follows from corollary 3 1 this is also true for entry 3 841 1 3 17 0 sinx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x e k and its companion entry 3 841 2 3 18 0 sinx 1 k 2 cos 2 x dx x e k example 3 4 the elementary method introduced here may be used to evaluate all integrals of the type 3 19 im n k 0 sinn x cosm x 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x and the companion family 3 20 jm n k 0 sinn x cosm x 1 k 2 cos 2 x dx x all entries in the sections 3 844 and 3 846 match one of these forms 6 s boettner and v moll example 3 5 many other evaluations can be produced by this method for instance 3 21 0 sinx log 1 k 2 sin 2 x 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x 2 0 log 1 k 2 sin 2 x 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx the integral on the left appears as entry 4 432 1 and the one on the right is entry 4 414 1 in 4 a proof of the identity 3 22 2 0 log 1 k 2 sin 2 x 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx k k ln k is given in example 7 2 4 some principal value integrals the method described above can be employed to evaluate some entries of 4 provided the integrals are interpreted as cauchy principal values example 4 1 the first example is 4 1 0 tanx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x k k that appears as one of the four entries in 3 842 3 of 4 let i 1 k denote the integral and introduce the notation 4 2 f x tanx 1 k 2 sin 2 x then f x is odd and it has period the principal value of the integral is given by 4 3 i 1 k lim 0 j 0 2 0 f x x dx 2 f x x j dx the substitution y x in the second integral above produces i 1 k lim 0 j 0 2 0 1 x 1 x j 1 f x dx lim 0 2 0 1 x j 1 2 x x 2 j 2 2 f x dx the series corresponds to the partial fraction expansion of the cotangent function this completes the evaluation of 4 1 the reader will note that this proof is very similar to that of lemma 3 1 the value 4 4 0 tanx 1 k 2 cos 2 x dx x k k that also appears in 3 842 3 is established using the same type of argument this completes the evaluation of the integrals in that entry of 4 elliptic integrals 7 example 4 2 entry 3 841 3 of 4 4 5 0 tanx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x e k and its companion 3 841 4 4 6 0 tanx 1 k 2 cos 2 x dx x e k can be established by the method described in the previous example 5 the hypergeometric connection the identites among elliptic integrals often make use of the series representations 5 1 k k 2 2 f 1 1 2 1 2 1 k 2 2 j 0 1 2 j 1 2 j j k 2 j j and 5 2 e k 2 2 f 1 1 2 1 2 1 k 2 2 j 0 1 2 j 1 2 j j k 2 j j where 2 f 1 is the classical hypergeometric function 5 3 2 f 1 a b c x j 0 a j b j c j j xj and 5 4 a j a a 1 a 2 a j 1 is the pochhammer symbol the value a 0 1 is adopted 6 evaluation by series expansions in this section we describe a method to evaluate many of the elliptic integrals appearing in 4 example 6 1 the first example is entry 3 842 3 6 1 0 sinx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x k k that has been evaluated in section 3 define 6 2 i 1 k 2 0 sinx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x to evaluate the integral let m k 2 and expand the integrand in power series using 6 3 d dm j sinx x 1 m sin 2 x 1 2 j sin 2 j 1 x x 1 m sin 2 x 1 2 j 8 s boettner and v moll therefore 6 4 i 1 m j 0 1 2 j mj j 0 sin 2 j 1 x x dx the remaining integral is entry 3 821 7 in 4 6 5 0 sin 2 j 1 x x dx 2 j 1 2 j 2 the value of the integral 6 1 now follows from the series representation of k k given in 5 1 proof of 6 5 start with 6 6 sin 2 j 1 x 2 2 j j 0 1 j 2 j 1 sin 2 j 2 1 x and the integral in example 3 1 in the form 6 7 0 sin x x dx 2 for 0 to obtain 6 8 0 sin 2 j 1 x x dx 22 j 1 j 0 1 j 2 j 1 it follows that 6 9 i 1 m 2 j 0 1 2 j 1 j 22 j mj j j 0 1 2 j 1 the result now follows from the next lemma lemma 6 1 let j k n then 6 10 k 0 1 j 2 j 1 1 k 2 j k proof the proof is by induction on k the case k 0 is clear the induction hypothesis is used to produce 6 11 k 0 1 2 j 1 1 k 1 2 j k 1 1 k 2 j 1 k and an elementary calculation reduces this to 1 k 2 j k this completes the proof of 6 5 second proof of 6 5 apply the identity 3 13 to the function f x sin 2 j x to obtain 6 12 0 sin 2 j 1 x x dx 2 0 sin 2 j x dx elliptic integrals 9 this last integral is the classical wallis formula given by 6 13 2 0 sin 2 j x dx 2 1 2 j j the reader will find in 1 information about this formula example 6 2 entry 3 841 1 in 4 6 14 0 sinx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx x e k is established by the same method employed above the proof starts with the expan sion of the integrand using 6 15 d dm j sinx x 1 m sin 2 x 1 2 j sin 2 j 1 x x 1 m sin 2 x 1 2 j and then identify the result with 5 2 example 6 3 entry 3 842 4 in 4 states that 6 16 i 2 k 2 0 x sinx cosx 1 k 2 sin 2 x dx k 2 k 2 e k k 2 the parameter k is the complementary modulus k 1 k 2 write m k 2 and expand the integrand in series using 6 17 d dm j x sinx cosx 1 m sin 2 x 1 2 j x sin 2 j 1 x cosx 1 m sin 2 x therefore 6 18 i 2 m j 0 1 2 j mj j 2 0 x sin 2 j 1 x cosx dx integration by parts gives 6 19 2 0 x sin 2 j 1 x cosx dx 4 j 1 1 4 j 1 b j 3 2 1 2 where 6 20 b u v 1 0 tu 1 1 t v 1 dt 2 2 0 sin 2 u 1 cos 2 v 1 d is the classical beta function it follows that 6 21 i 2 m 4 j 0 1 2 j mj j 1 1 4 j 0 1 2 j b j 3 2 1 2 mj j 1 the two series are now treated separately 10 s boettner and v moll the first sum is computed by the binomial theorem 6 22 1 x a j 0 a j j xj as 6 23 4 j 0 1 2 j mj j 1 2 1 1 m 2 m 1 1 m the second sum is 1 4 j 0 1 2 j b j 3 2 1 2 mj j 1 4 j 0 1 2 j j 3 2 j 1 j 2 mj 8 j 0 1 2 j 1 2 j mj j 1 2 m j 0 1 2 j 1 1 2 j 1 mj 1 j 1 2 m 2 f 1 1 2 1 2 1 m 1 the hypergeometric representation 5 2 and 6 21 give 6 24 i 2 m 1 m 2 m e k m as claimed 7 a small correction to a formula in gradshteyn and ryzhik in this section we present the evaluation of some elliptic integrals in 4 in par ticular a small error in formula 4 395 1 is corrected proposition 7 1 let k 1 k 2 be the complementary modulus then 7 1 0 lnx dx 1 x 2 k 2 x 2 1 2 k k ln k proof let m k 2 and use 7 2 d dm j lnx 1 x 2 m x 2 1 j 1 2 j lnx 1 x 2 m x 2 j 1 2 to expand the integrand around m 1 it follows that 7 3 0 lnx dx 1 x 2 k 2 x 2 j 0 1 j j 1 2 j 0 lnx dx 1 x 2

side of 7 1 satisfies 7 4 0 lnx dx 1 x 2 k 2 x 2 2 j 0 1 2 2 j j 2 j 1 i 0 1 2 i 1 1 m j the series expansion for the complete elliptic integral now shows that the right hand side of 7 1 is given by 1 4 lnmk 1 m 8 j 1 1 m j j j 0 1 2 2 j j 2 1 m j 8 j 0 j 1 i 0 1 j i 1 2 2 i i 2 1 m j the result follows from the identity established in the next lemma lemma 7 1 let j n define 7 5 ar 1 2 2 r r 2 then 7 6 j 1 i 0 ai j i 4 aj j 1 i 0 1 2 i 1 proof the relations 7 7 x k 1 k x k 1 k and 1 2 n k 1 2 n k 1 k 1 2 n can be used to rewrite the left hand side as j 1 i 0 1 2 2 i i 2 1 j i j 1 k 0 1 2 2 j k 1 j k 1 2 1 k 1 1 2 2 j j 2 j 1 k 0 j 2 k 1 1 2 j 2 k 1 1 k 1 12 s boettner and v moll thus the assertion of the lemma is equivalent to 7 8 j 1 k 0 j 2 k 1 1 2 j 2 k 1 1 k 1 j 1 k 0 4 2 k 1 next apply
