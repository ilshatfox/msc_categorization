authors at riskeconlab cims nyu edu abstract gait recognition is a term commonly referred to as an identification problem within the computer science field there are a variety of methods and models capable of identifying an individual based on their pattern of ambulatory locomotion by surveying the current literature on gait recognition this paper seeks to identify appropriate metrics devices and algorithms for collecting and analyzing data regarding patterns and modes of ambulatory movement across individuals furthermore this survey seeks to motivate interest in a broader scope of longitudinal analysis regarding the perturbations in gait across states i e physiological emotive and or cognitive states more broadly inferences to normal versus pathological gait patterns can be attributed based on both longitudinal and non longitudinal forms of classification this may indicate promising research directions and experimental designs such as creating algorithmic metrics for the quantification of fatigue or models for forecasting episodic disorders furthermore in conjunction with other measurements of physiological and environmental conditions pathological gait classification

within the computer science field empirical methods e g data algorithms models are employed to identify an individual based on their pattern of ambulatory locomotion 1 humans are complex and the amalgamation of variables that yield their corresponding 1 this paper specifically focuses on gait in regards to human bipedal movement gait is still a relevant metric for both animal locomotion and human quadrupedal locomotion e g crawling but that is outside of the scope of this paper ar x iv 2 01 2 14 46 5 v 1 cs l g 2 8 d ec 2 02 0 a preprint january 1 2021 quasi unique gait can be analyzed and learned research applying gait recognition methods to relevant data may have potential to yield empirical indicators with explanatory power for a variety of physiological emotive and or cognitive conditions with regard to such empirical indicators as syndromic diagnostic signals gait perturbation may be a proxy for attributing such perturbations to underlying pathological state transitions the focus of this paper is on the application of signal processing to measurable state transitions in the context of pathological gait diagnostics this paper reviews how such empirical indicators can be modeled and learned in order to classify subjects with regards to either normal 2 or pathological 3 gait with either longitudinal or non longitudinal classification methods longitudinal classification is employed to assign individual gait to a class or category based on a specified cross sectional variable observed over time whereas non longitudinal classification uses cross sectional methods to assign individuals into categories based upon a non temporal target variable 4 the more commonly studied gait recognition problem of identifying an individual based on their signature gait is an example of a normal gait non longitudinal classification problem normal gait there are a diversity of features that may be utilized to classify individuals without pathological processes related to gait including stride length frequency of steps per distance velocity pattern of regularity of steps these features can be used to classify individuals related to several conditions or states of adaptive functionality such as fatigue performance readiness fitness motor coordination etc once such accurate and reliable classification is achieved non longitudinally it can be further explored to identify individuals related to a meaningful target variable in the future as long as the data is longitudinal this type of classification can have value to specific populations such as athletes by forecasting performance or injury pathological gait the diversity of features described to classify individuals with normal gait may also be used to detect neuropathological processes such as in patients with neurologic e g parkinson s disease or psychiatric e g mania depression disorders symptoms of psychomotor retardation or agitation are considered to be well documented indicators of a variety of neurologic or psychiatric disorders bennabi vandel papaxanthis pozzo e haffen 2013 this may yield cross sectional empirical results for classifying or diagnosing neurological or psychiatric disorders and may also facilitate longitudinal classification using data sets that exhibit explanatory or predictive power regarding target variables at some future time relative to the time when the gait features were measured such longitudinal classification might improve analyses related to a patient s prognosis response to treatment or leading indicators relevant to health and safety related outcomes such as work absences psychiatric hospitalizations behavioral incidents associated with affective and cognitive impairment e g dementia delirium and emergency room incidents precipitated by fatigue conditions associated with inflammatory response to infectious agents however prior to pursuing these potential research applications it is important to obtain a reasonably thorough understanding of the underlying methods and tools required for gait recognition the methods of gait recognition can be divided into multiple steps first and foremost there is data collection which is created either from video surveillance or through biometric devices such as accelerometers and force sensors although a variety of publicly available datasets containing such data have been identified as surveyed in section 2 the sparsity of these datasets is noteworthy subsequent to data collection two stages of data transformation are typically applied section 3 describes the initial pre processing techniques this section describes the differences between pre processing video data and biometric data as well as two different approaches to feature extraction in regards to gait data model based and model free model based pre processing employs physiological anatomical and structural fundamentals regarding the dynamics of the body in order to explicitly specify a model the model free approach on the other hand employs no such prior knowledge shirke pawa shah 2014 the last step of pre processing data is dimensionality reduction which is a form of feature extraction intended to reduce the dimensionality of the data in order to remove redundancy and noise the popular reduction techniques of principal component analysis pca and linear discriminant analysis lda are surveyed at the end of section 3 once the data is processed it can be used for classification the commonly used classification techniques in the field of gait recognition are k nearest neighbors knn support vector machines svm hidden markov models hmm and neural networks nn dynamic time warping dtw is a commonly applied metric to quantify distance between time series and can be used for both classification and preprocessing section 4 of this paper will discuss these classification methods as applied to all permutations of normal vs pathological gait and longitudinal vs 2 this paper defines normal gait according to whittle 2002 as a standardized model of gait in order to assess the gait of patients this means normal is defined differently depending on the expected patient per study e g a study on elderly women will have a different definition of normal versus a study on young men 3 this paper defines pathological gait according to whittle 2002 as gait affected by some known physical or neurological condition in a manner such that it deters from normal gait 4 a target variable is a feature within the data that determines the classes categories for classification 2 a preprint january 1 2021 non longitudinal classification for the problem of gait recognition this is then followed in section 5 by potential future projects and applications in the field and concluded in section 6 2 data survey there are a variety of data sets currently available to conduct research within gait recognition applied to human bipedal locomotion several data sets that represent examples of available data are reviewed in this section according to their potential application for research on normal or pathological gait implementing either longitudinal or non longitudinal classification table one summarizes these data sets according to these categories 2 1 normal gait and non longitudinal data 2 1 1 cmu mobo this dataset was generated by the robotics institute at carnegie mellon university it consists of 25 individuals walking on a treadmill in four different ways slow fast with incline while holding a ball captured by cameras from six different angles as well as providing silhouette extracted images for each permutation for specifics on requesting this database and particular information regarding the data such as sequence length and camera specifics refer to gross shi 2001 2 1 2 usf gait baseline this is a large dataset over a terabyte of video data generated by the university of southern florida it consists of 1870 sequences from 122 participants who walked on a lawn under different circumstances nearly each participant walked with all the permutations represented in figure 1 2 1 3 casia this database is provided by the institute of automation chinese academy of sciences casia it consist of three 5 datasets a b c each of which consists of video and silhouette footage of participants walking at a variety of angles speeds and wearing items such as backpacks and coats dataset a is the smallest with 20 participants each participant has twelve sequences four for each direction 0 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the camera dataset b is substantially more meticulous as it consists of 124 subjects each of which has sequences corresponding to eleven different angles with respect to the camera furthermore subjects are monitored normally as well as while wearing a coat or carrying a bag dataset c consists of 154 participants under four different walking conditions slow fast normal and with a bag however the novelty of this dataset is that the video footage was taken at night with an infrared camera it should be noted that the silhouette extracted image sequences are publicly available for download however the full 10 gb database must be requested figure 1 s sarkar et al 2005 all permutations of the usf gait baseline data 5 there is a fourth dataset according to the casia website however it does not appear to be readily available 3 a preprint january 1 2021 2 1 4 physiobank long term dynamics physiobank 6 is a collection of physiological databases and happens to contain a variety of databases and studies in regard to gait applied to biometric time series data all of the data is publicly available but some of the files are compressed by physiobank and can only be read with their specified publicly available software this applies to both this dataset and all following physiobank datasets this dataset consists of force sensor data of ten young men average age 21 7 generated by placing a force sensor in the shoe of the participant each participant has six distinct time series data files each one hour long the difference between each file is the pace slow normal or fast and whether or not their stride was coordinated via metronome 2 2 pathological gait and non longitudinal data 2 2 1 physiobank neurodegenerative disease this appears to be the most extensive databases available on physiobank there are 64 participants that are grouped in terms of multiple neurodegenerative diseases as well as a control group the goal is to focus on stride and variation figure 2 demonstrates stride interval over time in subjects without neurologic disease and in patients with three categories of neurologic diseases parkinson s disease huntington s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a visual inspection of the patterns illustrated in this figure indicates that there may be a stride interval signature for a neurological disease which is distinct from normal gait the data consists of time series data displayed below in figure 3 as well as signal data on both the left and right foot taken from a sensor 2 2 2 physiobank parkinson s disease this specific disease is often studied in tandem with gait because of how much gait is affected by parkinson s disease this dataset consists of patients with 93 and without 73 the disorder and their gaits during a two minute walk demographic data is also available for each patient furthermore the data is generated from 8 sensors under each foot of each patient so this specific biometric is similar to that of a force plate figure 2 goldberger et al 2000 neurodegenerative disease timeseries data figure 3 goldberger et al 2000 columns correspond ing to neurodegenerative disease data 6 the list of available physiobank databases related to gait can be found here 4 https physionet org physiobank database gait a preprint january 1 2021 2 3 normal gait and longitudinal data 2 3 1 physiobank long term movement this database contains two sets of three dimensional accelerometry data from 71 elderly persons one of the data sets is recorded over three days while at home while the other is obtained from a conducted in lab minute long walk finally each participant has metadata such as age gender number of falls in the past year clinical fall risk assessment scores 2 3 2 physiobank tai chi this study collected data on 87 adults that had no prior tai chi experience versus those with at least five years referred to as experts foot switches were used as well as an acquisition monitor along the waist in order to collect the data over ten minutes of walking tai chi experts were only measured once while those inexperienced either the control group or the group learning tai chi were monitored several times during the period of the study 2 3 3 kaggle competition for gait recognition kaggle com a website dedicated to data science challenges and competitions had a competition for gait recognition based on phone data accelerometry and time for 387 participants combining to a total of 30 million samples the time is represented as the number of milliseconds since january 1 st 1970 at midnight utc 7 the accelerometry data is represented by each axis x y z in terms of gravitational force for example a phone set on the table facing upwards would be represented by the point 0 0 9 8 2 4 pathological gait and longitudinal data 2 4 1 kaggle competition for parkinson s disease similar to the kaggle competition referred to in section 2 3 3 this competition was based on phone data additionally this dataset has a control group and a group of patients with parkinson s disease each consisting of eight participants other additional information such as gps data and metadata was available for each participant table 1 descriptions of reviewed datasets for research on gait recognition 7 it should be noted that to avoid leakage in this competition some of the variables including the time variable were altered and hence is not consistent across subjects the discussion on this can be found here 5 https www kaggle com c accelerometer biometric competition discussion 5721 a preprint january 1 2021 3 data preprocessing for the problem of gait recognition the data must be cleaned first to remove extraneous information and noise then once the data has been properly cleaned it should go through two forms of feature extraction first additional relevant information and biometrics such as cadence number of steps per minute are extracted once the additional features are added to the data dimensionality reduction based feature extraction techniques should be employed in order to prepare the data for classification 3 1 noise removal every dataset has noise which will impair the performance of any classification method under most circumstances the following sections review noise removal techniques for both biometric and video data 3 1 1 biometric data biometric data often consists of both accelerometry force sensor data and patient metadata metadata can undergo feature selection whereby a subset of data columns are chosen that best represent the study in question this is commonly implemented in four ways first features with a density of null values are either removed or filled in by some convention i e average value for non null values of that feature second features with too high or too low variance are unlikely to influence the classification results and they can be removed 8 third a domain expert for the study can select the relevance of a feature or lack thereof to the study lastly the relevance of features can be computed and analyzed via feature importance algorithms 9 accelerometer and force sensor data however require more nuanced techniques this is because the noise within this data is often a specific sequencing that is irrelevant to gait or a malfunction in the data collection device consider accelerometry data generated by a cellular device suppose that a participant dropped the device this can be detected by a jolt in velocity in the downward direction followed by a sudden stop and vibration upon collision with the floor this type of biometric data can be cleaned by algorithms 10 that detect movement unrelated to gait such as extreme movement or no movement at all 3 1 2 video data silhouette extraction is the initial step to any processing of video data for gait recognition an image or video has a significant amount of extraneous information and hence it is crucial to extract the focal point of the data i e the individual moving this is an important application of dimensionality reduction as it effectively removes any and all features present in the data that are not directly related to the movement of the individual removal of the background 11 of a video feed works under the assumption that there is little to no motion in the video outside of the individual whose gait is in question since a video is a sequence of images with the same dimensions the pixels relevant to the background only change drastically when the individual moves within that localized area bouchrika nixon 2007 once the background is removed the image should be blank everywhere other than the desired silhouette sometimes this is not the case and additional noise persists morphological processing is a technique for processing geometric structures that is used to isolate that larger anatomical structure the goal for extraction shaikh saeed chaki 2014 this is computed by examining the full image with a structure often a small square this structure is placed in every possible position of the image and records the density of blank pixels in each area this analysis can then remove noise isolated from the target silhouette finally the silhouette extracted from the image can have gaps as seen in figure 6 these must be filled in order to properly represent the individual in the data it is important not to fill in the space between the arm and the body yet it is important to fill in a hole that doesn t properly represent anatomy a heuristic solution to this problem is to search 8 entropy and information gain are common tools for evaluated this variance both for removing insignificant features as well as prioritizing features with potentially substantial predictive power 9 the specificity of these algorithms are outside of the scope of this paper if there is further interest in feature importance methodology tang alelyani and liu 2014 provide a sufficient survey 10 many of these algorithms fall into the category of anomaly detection which is a topic outside of the scope of this paper further information on these techniques are surveyed by chandola banjeree and kumar 2009 11 there are a variety of different algorithms used for background subtraction that will not be surveyed in this paper a subset can be found in benezeth jodoin emile laurent rosenberg 2010 6 a preprint january 1 2021 for holes completely encompassed by the silhouette which turns out to be a sufficient solution shaikh saeed chaki 2014 once there is a proper represented silhouette for the image in question model free or model based approaches can be applied to extract features for example one can calculate stride or gait cycles 12 based on the contour bounding box around the silhouette shaikh saeed chaki 2014 3 2 feature extraction whether the data is biometric or video it is still describing the same concept an individual s gait and there are plenty of potential features relevant to gait such as stride that can be extracted from silhouettes accelerometry data force sensor data and other structural and functional data e g skeletal extraction 13 the different kinds of feature extraction methods for gait fall into two categories model based and model free 3 2 1 model based the model based approach is centered around understanding anatomical dynamics concepts and biometrics based upon this understanding can be extracted from data in order to identify and quantify gait there are a variety of different figure 4 shaikh saeed chaki 2014 image representing a silhouette pre and post morphological processing figure 5 shaikh saeed chaki 2014 image representing a silhouette pre and post boundary filling 12 this paper defines gait cycle according to whittle 2002 as the movement and time beginning from initial contact until the state of initial contact is repeated whittle gives the example of initial contact with the right foot this is the beginning of the cycle the subject then steps with their left foot and then their right foot again when the right foot contacts the floor for the second time the initial contact has repeated and this is hence the end of the cycle 13 by way of illustration and for further background on feature engineering implementing skeletal extraction see saxe 2018 7 a preprint january 1 2021 metrics all of which require knowledge of dynamics and anatomy that can be applied here some of the more common model based metrics are joint angles and anatomical segmentation while model based approaches can achieve high performance due to these complex metrics implementation can be impractical in order to extract such clear information on the dynamics of the body in a video the quality of video data must be high and this is often very difficult to obtain in real life applications shirk pawa shah 2014 bouchrika nixon 2007 consider the application of gait recognition through security footage this type of footage is not typically of high quality and hence a model based approach may not be able to identify a perpetrator accurately additionally given the considerable requirement of quality for initial information as applied to the processing and algorithms the computational cost is also high shirk pawa shah 2014 bouchrika nixon 2007 overall this approach appears to have a higher bar for both use and implementation and hence an application that is intended to be widely applicable may need to use a model free approach as it bears less of a computational cost shirk pawa shah 2014 3 2 2 model free unlike the model based approach the model free approach extracts a variety of gait relevant features from the data without any prerequisite anatomical knowledge while there are a plethora of features such as joint angle that cannot be extracted in this manner there is a substantial amount that can be extracted a common model free approach is to compute the gait energy image gei which creates a two dimensional representation of an individual s gait from a sequence of silhouette images man bhanu 2006 a simple example applied to accelerometry data is conceptualizing a potential score based on overall movement discerned from the data an example of such score is the activity index bai et al 2016 which is a quantification of the activity level of the individual the weakness of the model free approach is also the strength of the model based approach with this lack of knowledge and potential variation within data the model free approach is less robust and hence requires tailoring to specific data shirk pawa shah 2014 this creates an issue in scalability for larger applications when it comes to image data as the representation from cameras lighting etc could yield different results with the same model free analysis 3 3 dimensionality reduction prior to classification it is important to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset in order to both maximize performance and reduce overfitting 14 dimensionality reduction is a form of feature extraction but instead of generating additional features from the given data an entirely new feature space is created given that individual level gait data has such a large range of variables to look at especially when considering video data it is necessary to discern a set of features that best describes the data while there are a variety of sufficient methods capable of reducing the dimensionality of the data two commonly applied algorithms to gait recognition are principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis 3 3 1 principal component analysis pca pca is an algorithm used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction pca achieves this by finding k principal components of the data reducing the n dimensional data matrix to k dimensional 15 principal components are linearly independent vectors that form an orthonormal basis for the new k dimensional space conceptually speaking this new k dimensional matrix is a transformation into a new topological space that maximizes the variance between features in this space due to the nature of these components let m be an n dimensional data matrix first pca requires discovering the k orthonormal axes represented by wi i 1 k that correspond to the eigenvectors of the k largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix x m x x x x t n hence any row of n dimensional data can now be transformed into the concept space by finding its components by computing wt x x this will maximize the variance within the features of this space because each feature is selected based on this new orthonormal basis then the entire matrix can be mapped into this new space and handle our reduced data for the problem at hand gait recognition of note there are variants of pca e g kernel principal 14 although this importance varies depending on the robustness of the classifier and data structure 15 where k is substantially less than n often noted mathematically as k n 8 a preprint january 1 2021 component analysis kpca sparse principal component analysis spca that can be better suited to solve gait recognition problems ekinci aykut 2007 3 3 2 linear discriminant analysis lda lda like pca is a linear transformation technique for taking the n dimensional feature space and reducing its dimensionality however rather than maximizing the variance between the features lda attempts to maximize the variance between the classes under the assumption of a gaussian distribution and similar variance across variables lda can analyze the variance across the data matrix m by looking at the covariance matrix with a representative vector for each class let i be the mean corresponding to the ith class k i 1 i i i i t k and just like pca the eigenvectors corresponding to the above matrix 16 forms a linear transformation of any data row to a new k dimensional concept space designed to separate the k classes this optimization towards separation of classes via the maximization of variance within the classes is the key towards the success of lda in the current literature of gait recognition if the goal is to identify an individual the desired result is a separation as described furthermore lda can be employed as a classification technique using bayesian probability along with the distribution of classes in the labeled data which has been applied to gait recognition su liao chen 2009 4 classification as previously stated the classification problems for gait recognition can be grouped by whether they are longitudinal or not and such grouping is helpful for organizing practical research questions related to the application of gait recognition methods however both groups are mathematically similar as the main distinction between groups is the time period during which the target feature the class was measured hence regardless of which permutation of normal vs pathological gait and longitudinal vs non longitudinal classification any of the algorithms reviewed in this section can be applied to solve the problem as long as the data and problem in question fit the algorithmic requirements figure 6 goal classify the question mark is it more likely to be a red square or a green circle 9 a preprint january 1 2021 4 1 algorithms 4 1 1 k nearest neighbors knn k nearest neighbors is a classification algorithm that given any data point x for gait recognition this is the representation of an individual s gait and some number k x is classified by a majority rule based on the known classification of the k nearest data points in the training set in order to find the k nearest data points there needs to be an understanding of distance within the feature space which will be covered in section 4 2 k nearest neighbors can be improved upon by weighting neighbors based on this distance consider figure 7 as a representation of the data within the feature space knn with k 5 would classify this mark as a green circle even though it is substantially more similar to a red square however if each data point is weighted with a value based on the distance to the question mark rather than an equal weight of 1 k then the resulting classification would be a red square while knn is not the most robust algorithm it is simple to implement and useful its most common application in the gait recognition literature is as a benchmark for performance study in testing an algorithm it is quite common to compare performance to that of a basic knn model given how easy knn is to implement 4 1 2 support vector machines svm support vector machines 17 boser et al 1992 cortes vapnik 1995 are supervised learning algorithms successfully applied in many fields including gait recognition the objective of this algorithm is to discover a hyperplane of lower dimensionality that can separate data points by the largest margin in order to classify them let our data points be in the form xi yi where xi is the feature vector and yi is the binary classification associated with xi assuming that the data in question is linearly separable 18 the following must be true for the calculated support vector w where b is a bias involved for representation of the hyperplane w xi b yi 1 i however the assumption of linear separability is too strong to solve this problem the margins found can be softened 19 by introducing a hinge loss function this creates the following objective to the optimization problem of finding the w and b that generate a hyperplane that minimizes misclassification in the training data minw b j max 0 1 w xj b yj more importantly this binary classification problem can be extended to a multi classification problem either using one vs rest or one vs one methods but in the literature of gait one vs rest is the most common implementation due to computational efficiency one vs rest functions on the axis that the support vector 20 that yields the largest output is the proper classification the last aspect of svms is called a kernel and is a large contributor to why svms are so robust a kernel k is a similarity metric with the following restriction let k a a ir then f a b such that x y a k x y f x f y let s assume that there are c unique classes and n training samples where the ith training sample is written xi yi and the jth class is written cj let zij be the calculated weight of the ith training sample for cj and let yij be 1 if yi j and 0 otherwise then any unlabeled data point x can be classified as the corresponding class cj to the maximal sum in the following equation maxcj 1 n i 1 yij zij k xi x 16 there cannot be more than k eigenvectors as the matrix has at most rank k 17 for a deep overview of how svms work and the theory behind them please refer to burges tutorial 1998 18 data is considered linearly separable if there exists some hyperplane that divides the data such that the binary classifier is capable of perfect classification 19 softened here is defined as allowing for misclassification 20 a support vector here is a binary classifier described by the math above 10 a preprint january 1 2021 in general given how robust svms are with the proper data processing and kernel selection they will be a reasonable approach to almost any gait recognition problem and hence this classification algorithm is quite popular in the literature 4 1 3 hidden markov models hmm a hidden markov model theorized by leonard baum and his colleagues baum et al 1970 is a statistical model that can be used for learning this model is built upon the assumption that the system it is modeling is a markov process but with hidden states where each state is only dependent on the previous state the goal of this model is to take an input observation sequence and discern which sequence of states is most likely to have produced this observation we can more formally define these concepts as follows let s s 1 s 2 sn be the set of possible states and o o 1 o 2 om be the set of possible observations then we can model an hmm called m where m a b x a is the transition matrix defined such that a i j is the probability that in a sequence of states sj follows si b is a matrix defined such that b i j is the probability that an observation oi is produced from the state sj and x is an array defining the probability of initial states such that xi is the probability that the first hidden state is si given the problem of gait recognition we are trying to model the gait of each specific individual let mk be the model that best represents the kth subject for classification then the following function can be used to classify an observed sequence o of an unknown subject max kp o mk in order to apply this to gait recognition we must have a method for creating all models mk as well as an algorithm for evaluating the probability that an observed gait belongs to any such models evaluation of this probability for hmms is usually computed through the viterbi algorithm and the matrices a b and x can be updated via the baum welch algorithm as far as creating the proper hmm for any given individual the literature suggests the best approach is by modeling one gait cycle when walking a person takes a step with one foot and then the other this can then be represented in terms of n states where the initial state would also follow the nth state as these states are cyclical hai thuc 2015 this is under the assumption that each state can be represented by a part of a temporal gait sequence 4 1 4 neural networks nn neural networks nn are a powerful 21 set of machine learning algorithms these algorithms follow a specific structure built of layers of neurons where neurons take some value 22 and each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the succeeding layer the first layer is the input layer this layer has a neuron to correspond to each considered feature such that the data vector can be fed into the network following the input layer is a sequence of one or more layers called hidden layers let li be the ith hidden layer and li j be the value of the jth neuron in that layer during the training portion of the network 23 each neuron in the next layer will learn a weight corresponding to that specific neuron let wk j be the weight for the kth neuron in li 1 corresponding to li j then the activation of this neuron can be described as follows li 1 k f li j 1 li j wk j 21 the universal approximation theorem stated by cs ji 2001 illustrates that by a specific structure a nn can approximate any continuous function given that the solution to many machine learning problems is function approximation this is a very important claim 22 in the literature this value is called the activation 23 the most common way to train a nn is using backpropagation optimized with an algorithm like stochastic gradient descent or adam backpropogation was developed in the 1970 s and rumelhart hinton and williams 1986 were the first to display its potential for nns the details of the algorithm however are out of the scope of this paper in terms of necessity of understanding for implementation of gait recognition 11 a preprint january 1 2021 where f is some chosen activation function 24 the data flows through the hidden layers in the manner described until it hits the last layer the output layer this layer is what determines classification let s consider the problem of gait recognition if the study has n subjects then this output layer will consist of n neurons each corresponding to a specific subject the softmax activation function is then applied to this output in order to convert it to a probability distribution and hence the neuron in the output layer with the highest probability would correspond to the proper subject classification of the gait in question furthermore there are a variety of different types of nns with additional complexities implemented in their structure long short term memory lstm 25 networks have been proposed for the application of pathological gait classification e g khokhlova et al 2019 another architecture applied to gait recognition applications is the convolutional neural network cnn 26 as a generally accepted practice the application of cnns to image classification is well established krizhevsky sutskever hinton 2012 the development by gadaleta and rossi 2018 demonstrates the utility of applying cnn in conjunction with svm to accelerometry based gait recognition 4 2 dynamic time warping dtw dynamic time warping is a similarity metric employed for comparing temporal sequences 27 more specifically dtw takes two temporal sequences that follow different time frames and align them for comparison this can be applied in the field of gait recognition because it enables quantifying similarity between gaits and their cycles without worrying about precise time measurements and alignment dtw achieves this by finding a path called the warping path that aligns the two temporal sequences and assesses the cost of such a path assume two sequences x x 1 x 2 xn and y y 1 y 2 ym let d be an nxm matrix representing the potential costs of warping in the following manner d i j min d i 1 j d i j 1 d i 1 j 1 cost xi yi where cost xi yi is the cost of aligning parts of the respective sequences given this matrix the dtw algorithm finds the cheapest path using dynamic programming by starting at the end and selecting through a recursive process the cheapest path that ends at either d n 1 m d n m 1 or d n 1 m 1 the cost of this path is hence the distance between the temporal sequences in question each algorithm covered in section 4 1 requires in some way or another the comparison of feature vectors given that gait is a biometric that is described over time dtw is a similarity metric well suited for this type of comparison both knn and svm implement dtw in a similar fashion for knn it is the given distance function and for svm it is the kernel method gudmundsson runarsson sigurdsson 2008 hmms require a bit more finesse as the method used to find the best representative class is the viterbi algorithm fortunately since hmm is also a path based algorithm dtw can be enhanced edtw via hmm by extending the viterbi algorithm this is then used as a classifier and has been shown to outperform dtw when implemented as a classification technique kumar kant shachi 2013 lastly nns can be implemented such that dtw is employed as a kernel like function for learning iwana frinken uchida 2016 5 future research directions now that this paper has reviewed examples of available data sets for research on gait recognition and methods that may be applied to these data sets to enable such research this section will explore promising directions for gait recognition research by outlining an example of a research project that might be conducted within each of the four categories of normal non longitudinal normal longitudinal pathological non longitudinal and pathological longitudinal data 24 it is often best for the values of neurons to be between one and zero or one and negative one an activation function keeps the value of neurons between a desired range in a mathematically sound way in terms of the structure of nns many of these functions were reviewed and analyzed by karlik and olgac 2011 25 the lstm architecture is outside of the scope of this paper for further explanation on its relevance please refer to the conceptual overview and introduction of the lstm architecture posted by chris olah understanding lstm networks 26 a convolutional layer is designed to process the input comparably to how the brain processes visual stimuli by convolving some filter onto the input in order to attain higher specificity within the transformation of the input while the details of cnns are out of the scope of this paper lecun et al 1998 is one of the initial applications of learning cnns using a novel structure named lenet 5 for real world problems document recognition and can provide insight on the underlying structure 27 it should be noted that dtw can also be used as a classification technique as seen in switonski michalczuk josinski polanski wojciechowski 2012 however this paper will focus on its application as a similarity metric 12 https colah github io posts 2015 08 understanding lstms a preprint january 1 2021 5 1 normal gait and non longitudinal target a potential research study within this avenue of inquiry could be a gradient definition of fatigue through a progressive 28 model fatigue in this case refers to muscular depletion that renders biomechanical movement unduly difficult which is treated as a terminal state such measurement would require a quantitative scale for states of fatigue that is objectively measurable through gait there have been studies that identify fatigue by requiring participants to exercise until they achieve a state of perceived muscular depletion janssen schollhorn newell jager rost vehof 2011 the hypothesis is that gait perturbation is a proxy indicative of fatigue by which a classifier might be trainable for attributing such perturbations to fatigued state transitions in order to design a model that can view the progression of fatigue there must be a representation of an ordered sequence of fatigued states given the methods reviewed in this paper hidden markov models are the most intuitive option to explore a hmm gait cycle could be generated for each observed or measurable fatigued state transition and detecting the current fatigued state of an individual by cyclical comparison through the hmm should be sufficient to quantify their state other architectures for exploration of condition based gait signals associated with fatigue also include autoencoders as well as discrete fourier transform of accelerometer vibrations i e tremors the physiobank long term dynamics dataset contains information regarding healthy individuals moving constantly at different intensities for a full hour this dataset could be sufficient for exploring the described fatigued state model as the participants gait could reflect symptoms of fatigue 5 2 normal gait and longitudinal target the future research relevant to this section could build upon the methods defined in section 5 1 given a fatigue model that quantifies the progressive states of fatigue it is reasonable to believe that forecasting a transition to higher fatigued states is possible this specific approach could be combined with the field of injury prevention by computing a risk factor based on the speed of transitions between fatigued states yielding an injury risk model based on the hypothesis that sudden and or acute fatigued state transitions increase the likelihood for injury given the wide array of features and complexity of the problem it is likely that the best course of action is to develop some deep learning architecture utilizing the different hmms described in section 5 1 to learn about the transitions between states and the fluctuation of gait that ensues depending on said state while none of the datasets reviewed contains exhausting behavior along with information on injury the physiobank dataset for long term movement is longitudinal and has information over multiple days including potential falls of elderly participants it is reasonable to hypothesize that these falls are related to exhaustion in some form or another and hence the dataset could be sufficient for initial exploration of this research opportunity by using the methods described to assess exhaustion prior to the fall with the gait data in proximity of the fall as the chosen target variable 5 3 pathological gait and non longitudinal target a promising project within this category is the classification of a set of predefined pathologies given a training set of gait related data where pathological disorders are a feature the physiobank neurodegenerative diseases dataset or the kaggle pd dataset it is not difficult to extrapolate from this review that both a k nearest neighbors classifier and a support vector machine could be adequate classifiers for this problem if dtw techniques are employed for comparison the databases described however contain pathologies that are known to drastically alter gait it would be interesting to consider other data that is available for disorders such as mania and depression as well as inflammatory responses to infection which results in pathological gait symptomatic of fatigue that may have distinct patterns of gait to use for a classification model of these disorders this array of disorders would make such a project more comprehensive and informative as a full spectrum of gait fluctuation would be surveyed rather than just extreme fluctuation 5 4 pathological gait and longitudinal target a research pursuit within this area could follow the progressive models from sections 5 1 and 5 2 and extend the concepts onto progressive pathologies certain pathological conditions such as having legs of different lengths are constant however disorders such as depression are episodic there are time periods containing high levels of depressive symptoms and others with minimal to no depressive symptoms the ability to forecast these disabling episodes by 28 a progressive model is a model consisting of ordered states that represent an evolution of some concept in this case fatigue is modeled such that the initial state is normal while the final state is completely fatigued and there is some qualification of states in between normal and fatigued 13 a preprint january 1 2021 analyzing the progression of gait over time using data related to previous episodes using the techniques described above is a promising project given that these episodes could be described as anomalies this project falls within the area of anomaly detection within time series analysis according to singh 2017 the state of the art approach to this type of problem would be a neural network with a stacked lstm 29 architecture hence that algorithm would appear to be a good starting point unfortunately there does not appear to be publicly available data that fulfills the needs of this project but it is highly possible that data sets with relevant information may be found in non public domains other similar applications may concern neurologic disorders such as parkinson s disease which has a very explicit progression in five stages and the kaggle competition dataset referenced in section 2 4 1 could be sufficient for exploring this project on parkinson s disease accordingly this project as applied to parkinson s disease could develop tools with a potential application to forecasting depressive episodes 30 once accompanied by satisfactory data 5 5 further exploration of gait recognition for syndromic surveillance this diagnostic research agenda is also conceptually relevant for other initiatives either pending under development or in progress e g ptsd rehabilitation furthermore it complements various clinical and commercial use case applications within safety health and wellness subdomains e g first responders and high risk industrial environments workers compensation geriatric care assisted living disability accidental death and dismemberment by way of general illustration as recently as 2019 the office of naval research solicited resources and capability for basic and applied research into machine learning related to syndromic surveillance predictive adaptations to support human performance and injury prevention 31 this research solicitation encompassed the intensive physical demands in often challenging environments for field support personnel often ranging from short term high intensity load activities to more prolonged longer duration activities which might also involve sleep cycle disruption or sleep deprivation further contributing to fatigue and other environmental physiological and psychological stressors as observed throughout the current covid pandemic crisis these are conditions characteristic of challenges consistently encountered by both first responders and other essential workers preventive measures and interventions might become more actionable assisted by reliably adaptive diagnostics focused on recognition of pathological gait further conditioned on detection and analysis of other corresponding stress and fatigue indicators both external e g voice stress analysis and internal e g galvanic skin response oxidative pulse rate heart rate variability as well as ambient environmental factors e g temperature humidity the joint conditionality associated with the complexities of such syndromic surveillance and diagnostics necessitates experimental design which requires data fusion to infer indicative changes in gait associated with corresponding changes across these modalities we further envision the prospect of deploying and testing other sensing modalities e g uwb and terahertz radar sonar time reversal signal processing for gait recognition beyond wearable accelerometry or visual imagery e g rgb nir ir we contemplate at least during the calibration process systematically incorporating some form of balance sensing devices into the clinical assessments as an additional data gathering and assessment tool in conjunction with other sensory technologies e g ms kinect radar for cross validation and calibration of syndromic results by way of another related illustration the primary theme proposed by a less recent although ongoing darpa research initiative 32 is the use of data collected from cellphone sensors to enable novel algorithms that conduct passive on line and preferably real time assessment of the health and performance conditions by extracting latent physiological signals which may be weak and noisy within data to be obtained through existing mobile device sensors e g accelerometer screen microphone the stated objective of such extraction and analysis would be to diagnose current health status and identify latent or developing health disorders the stated intention of the darpa project is to develop algorithms and techniques for identifying both known indicators of physiological impairment such as disease illness and or injury and deviations from the micro behaviors that might be indicative of such impairment it is also expected that additional digital biomarkers of physiological problems could be identified during such research through the combination of big data analytics and medical ground truth with the purpose of condition based health intervention 29 lstm stands for long short term memory which is a specific recurrent neural network structure capable of understanding long term dependencies it is described in detail by singh 2017 30 it has been shown that there is a high correlation between depression and parkinson s disease shrag jahanshahi and quinn 2001 displayed this as well as demonstrated that the severity of depression increases with the severity of pd given this correlation the tools that assist in identifying the progression of parkinson s disease are likely to be helpful in approaching a similar problem with subjects diagnosed with depression 31 see onr baa special notice n 00014 19 s sn 08 32 see https research usc edu files 2017 05 hr 001117 s 0032 i 2 o wash 002 pdf 14 https

development and deployment of a mobile application that passively assesses health condition readiness both immediately and over time in order to provide a clinicians with plausible health conditions

a mobile application that passively collects and delivers relevant user sensing data to a shared longitudinal data repository such a program could involve enlisting existing or new medical cohorts managing interactions with the cohort coordinators and ensuring compliance with security and privacy requirements of said cohorts to provide suitably anonymized and aggregated data access under appropriate protections via an api or other such utility to the relevant smartphone sensor generated data collected from participating cohort subjects implementing such a clinical research protocol entails foundational technology that for a passive continuous collection of reliable physiological data from a smartphone b data analysis for identifying reliable digital biomarkers from such data and c the fusion of such digital biomarkers for achieving disease identification recognition of symptomatic precursors as well as cognitive and physiological state of readiness assessment the technical approach draws upon fields that include statistical data analytics with an anticipated emphasis on signal analysis and machine learning behavioral biometrics and epidemiological domains 33 6 conclusion this paper reviewed the literature and implementation of gait recognition within the four categories described by the permutations of normal versus pathological gait and longitudinal versus non longitudinal classification for both biometric and video data this implementation was detailed first by determining ideal preprocessing techniques on the data followed by an in depth survey of popular classification algorithms furthermore this paper presented potential research directions in each of these four categories regarding gait recognition as a classification problem as well as syndromic surveillance and inferences related to fatigue and other observable indicators inferences to normal versus pathological gait patterns can be attributed based on both longitudinal and non longitudinal forms of classification a broader scope of longitudinal analysis regarding the perturbations in gait across states i e physiological emotive and or cognitive states may indicate promising research directions and experimental designs such as creating algorithmic metrics for the quantification of fatigue or models for forecasting episodic disorders lastly in conjunction with other 33 broader issues of ethics policy and legality regarding human experimentation privacy e g hipaa gdpr and algorithmic bias although outside the scope of this paper are nonetheless relevant to gait recognition syndromic surveillance and bioinformatics by way of background as research has become formalized the academic community has developed formal definitions of human subject research
