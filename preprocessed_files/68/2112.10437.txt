online unplugged and block based cryptography in grade 10 online unplugged and block based cryptography in grade 10 michael lodi michael lodi unibo it universit di bologna bologna italy inria sophia antipolis valbonne france marco sbaraglia marco sbaraglia unibo it universit di bologna bologna italy simone martini simone martini unibo it universit di bologna bologna italy inria sophia antipolis valbonne france abstract we report our experience of an extracurricular online intervention on cryptography principles in 10 th grade this paper s first goal is to present the learning path we designed influenced by cryptogra phy core ideas rather than technical knowledge we will detail how we used snap a visual programming language to realize hands on activities programming playgrounds to experiment with cryptosys tems and their limits and interactive support for an unplugged activity on the diffie hellman key exchange the second goal is to evaluate our intervention in terms of both student perceptions and learning of core cryptography ideas the students appreciated the course and felt that despite being remote it was fun interesting and engaging they said the course helped them understand the role of cryptography cs and math in society and sparked their interest especially in cryptography and cs the third goal is to discuss what worked well and areas of improvement pedagogically remote teaching caused high instructor blindness and prevented us from giving the optimal amount of guidance during the explo ration activities with snap playgrounds making them sometimes too challenging for total programming novices on the other hand the remote unplugged diffie hellman worked well it embodies a coherent metaphor that engaged the students and made them grasp this groundbreaking protocol the students praised the activities as engaging even when challenging the final assessment showed that the core cryptography ideas were well understood keywords

activi ties and tools e g instant messaging e commerce stock exchange as recognized by 20 various frameworks e g 5 and curric ula e g the k 12 computer science framework 15 and the uk computing curriculum 8 include competencies related to cyber security some of them are more oriented on using security for personal purposes others on understanding how digital security works but they all recognize that cybersecurity skills are essential for students to be active citizens of digital society the fact that cryptography is the foundation of cybersecurity implies its scien tific and cultural value in addition novices identified cryptography as an interesting context for computer science lessons 20 p 3 however not much research has been done in teaching cryptogra phy for k 12 considering that k 12 education does not aim to train professionals but to provide lenses to understand the world and skills to act in it we consider it important to teach the fundamental principles of cryptography in a way that could be understood by novices we wanted to create a course that while short and without prerequisites would help students understand the principles of cryptography and their importance in our society to do so we de signed a learning path and two non traditional and complementary types of activity due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic we had to design the intervention as remote only in general since educational research has shown the effective ness of active and cooperative learning methodologies 24 p 304 we aimed to design meaningful concrete and interactive activi ties for students we developed cryptography playgrounds to let students know use and attack simple cryptosystems e g ceasar cipher and a remote unplugged activity to make students in pairs enact the diffie hellman key exchange we realized both types of activities with snap a visual programming language practical activities are steps of the learning path we developed around the fundamental cryptography principles our pathway includes a few meaningful systems and schemes while limiting technical knowledge in particular the need to overcome every time the limitations of these systems shapes a meaningful progression intended to support learning this paper s first goal is to present our learning path section 3 focusing on the cryptography principles and schemes as motiva tions for content progression 3 2 and the development and expe rience of snap activities i e crypto playgrounds and unplugged diffie hellman 3 3 the second goal is to evaluate our experience sections 5 and 6 regarding both the level of understanding of the fundamental concepts covered 5 1 6 1 and students satisfaction and perceived utility 5 2 the last goal is to discuss what worked and what did not section 6 1 and help cs educators adopt and adapt our pathway and practical activities 6 2 2 relatedwork in 2017 the joint task force on cybersecurity education released the curriculum guidelines for post secondary degree programs in cybersecurity 28 although they are targeted at post secondary education among the first concepts to be learned they include basic concepts in cryptography to build the base for other sections in the knowledge unit 28 p 24 in the k 12 computer science standards 7 proposed by u s computer science teachers associ ation csta and acm cybersecurity is important for all grades in particular for level 2 grades 6 8 11 14 y o the standard 2 ni 06 indicates that students should be able to encode and decode messages with various encryption methods and understand their ar x iv 2 11 2 10 43 7 v 1 cs c r 2 0 d ec 2 02 1 lodi et al different levels of complexity starting with the simplest e g cae sar cipher to the more complicated public key ciphers which are better learned through unplugged activities however a review of cybersecurity education over the last ten years of sigcse and iticse conferences 40 found that research predominantly focus es on tertiary education in the usa in addi tion very few papers specifically address cryptography our search confirmed this while some research is focused specifically on university level cryptography courses see e g 4 14 in many proposals cryptography was just one of the many parts of a cy bersecurity course or curriculum see e g 3 9 35 38 most often applied as a tool rather than explained deeply in its inner workings the use of visualization tools or interactive simulations for crypto graphic algorithms e g caesar vigen re des aes rsa sha has been proposed 33 and developed 25 31 32 showing how ciphers work their weaknesses and possible attacks sometimes these visualizations and simulations are accurate but too detailed for young students some ideas relevant to our work are using a message board to simulate a person in the middle attack on a public key cryptosystem 13 having students implement cryp tographic algorithms from classical to modern with computer algebra systems 26 helping novice developers securely use cryp tographic apis by providing them with cryptographic building blocks designed in line with the visual metaphors of block based programming languages 39 from an extensive search of various libraries we found few pa pers specifically focused on teaching basic cryptography principles to k 12 students again many proposals are in the broader context of cybersecurity curricula including some hands on cryptography activities often set in a motivating real world context for example understanding a secure mail exchange with simulations of encryp tion decryption attacks on caesar and vigen re ciphers and the rsa cryptosystem 12 a social networking platform that includes a simple activity of implementing the caesar cipher in python 43 summer camps to teach cybersecurity and computational thinking through robotics and block based programming languages with caesar and vig nere encryptions implemented in robots 18 42 some unplugged activities have been proposed the classical cs unplugged kid crypto 1 which simulates the one way function of public key cryptography with a perfect dominating set on a graph activities on symmetric transposition ciphers in the context of a scout story 29 a one day workshop to learn about classical and modern cryptosystems with paper pencil and handmade mate rials 16 unplugged activities on caesar and rail fence ciphers for a classical capture the flag cybersecurity competition 11 a phys ical simulation of the diffie hellman exchange with colors with students impersonating alice and bob mixing food coloring 10 in general hands on inquiry based cryptography and cybersecurity activities have been claimed to improve k 12 students self efficacy and problem solving skills 17 3 our course 3 1 context in italy upper secondary school lasts five years usually students start when they are 14 y o but only the first two are compulsory upper secondary level has a a variety of strands lyceums tecni cal and professional lyceums give a theoretical basis in classical scientific or artistic areas and naturally lead to university studies see 2 for a summary of the italian secondary school system the mathematical lyceum is a national experimental project it is an extra curricular afternoon supplement available to all lyceum students on a voluntary basis students participate in extra labo ratory activities to experience interdisciplinarity between mathe matics and other disciplines the project s goal is not to introduce more information but to reflect on ideas and foundations of knowl edge and to broaden cultural horizons 19 in this context we accepted the invitation from a local lyceum to organize a cryptog raphy course 15 students 5 girls and 10 boys all in their second year of lyceum ca 15 16 y o participated in the course none of them had previous programming experience the course was taught by two of the authors of this paper who are researchers in computer science education and have experience in high school teaching we held four lessons 2 h each every tuesday afternoon in february 2021 due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic the lessons were held online through the google meet platform adopted by the school 3 2 learning path we designed the intervention with the dual lens of seeing mathe matical concepts applied to cryptography and more importantly as computer scientists teaching some fundamental principles of cryp tography crucial in today s society the development of our learning path was influenced by a broader research project 21 aimed at identifying the big ideas of cryptography i e those core concepts understandable by non experts that are beacons to guide teaching and learning through interviews with experts and an open discussion with both educators and scholars 3 2 1 contents day 1 the social debate about encryption in digital communication caesar cipher encoding decoding brute force attack homework transposition vs substitution kerckhoffs principle

overcome computationally expensive 6 hybrid cryptosystems 1 motivations combine the best of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems 3 3 tools activities and methodology 3 3 1 tools used as a videoconferencing service we used google meet in general we relied on google workspace for education the platform chosen by the host school more in detail we used google classroom to share announcements learning materials and homework we used google slides to present slides and simple animations of crypto schemes and google docs to share longer texts 2 also we used google forms to i guide free exploration activities with questions ii gather homework and iii collect final evaluation answers and students feedback on the course snap 27 originally byob build your own blocks is a visual block based programming language it is an extended reimplemen tation of scratch with functions and many other features that make it suitable for a serious introduction to cs programming for high school or college students in particular we choose snap because it allows creating new blocks i e new functions unlike in scratch in snap custom blocks can return values and also hide their imple mentation i e the function body from students 3 3 2 tools created activities and methodology using snap we created a progression of playgrounds to support the hands on ac tivities these environments allow students to experiment with 1 we did not include problems here because hybrid cryptosystems were the final destination of our path 2 e g homework readings from outreach materials like singh s the code book 34 cryptosystems e g caesar cipher one time pad and their limits e g ease or difficulty of decryption the computation time required a playground is a snap project with a limited set of visible instruc tions by leveraging snap s ability to create custom blocks and hide existing ones we provided only the blocks needed to encrypt and decrypt messages and carry out possible attacks for each cryptosys tem for example to attack a caesar ciphertext using frequencies some of the blocks available in the playground were calculating frequencies in a text sorting a matrix i e letter and frequency by frequencies representing a two dimensional matrix with an histogram and a table of average frequencies in the used language fig 1 all playgrounds used during the course which follow the path outlined in 3 2 are available for exploration and use 22 through guiding questions and small coding decoding and attack challenges we invited the students to play by combining the snap blocks the explicit and shared objective was to solve the proposed task the broader goal was for the students to experience the cryptosystem and understand its operation and limitations we always tried to design activities by contextualizing them in meaningful scenarios for students for example the activities on caesar cipher involve a latin 3 text to be used for a test that a quarantined teacher wants to communicate secretly to her substitute colleague without the students being able to intercept it as the complexity of the systems increased we felt that asking students to program the algorithms albeit in the simplified way of blocks was too great a challenge for the course given that theywere novices in programming for example for the diffie hellman key exchange we thought that having an already working program that supported students in simulating the shared secret generation could suit better understanding the protocol at a high level so instead of providing a snap playground we gave students an executable only snap project i e they could not modify it nor explore its code that guided them in performing the actions of one of the two actors involved in a diffie hellman key exchange 22 there are at least two typical ways to didactically present diffie hellman see e g 41 one based on mixing colors more evocative yet simplified the other on performing the algorithm with small numbers more accurate yet complex we tried to combine these two modes to gradually move from color metaphor to mathematical functioning in particular our snap program assigns a color to each number from 0 to 99 color mixing is not done with classical additive or subtractive algorithms but is based on the actual diffie hellman calculations initially hidden to the students made between the simple numbers that in snap represent colors through this pro gram the students in pairs were able to generate a shared secret color for every couple the necessary communications between the two students i e choosing an initial shared color and exchanging the calculated color took place on the public chat which effectively represented the insecure channel since everyone could listen over it after the students experienced firsthand the high level function ing of the diffie hellman algorithm we explained the mathematical underpinnings necessary to understand its details see 3 2 1 at 3 all our lyceum students were studying latin lodi et al figure 1 attacking caesar cipher with frequencies snap playground this point we illustrated the algorithm itself through an anima tion 22 that shows the correspondence between the colors and the simple numbers representing them revealing the actual cal culations that drive the color mixing then we used other simple animations 22 of typical communication scenarios to illustrate increasingly complex concepts e g secrecy and authentication asymmetric schemes and abstract the technical details to focus on understanding the underlying cryptographic principles 4 relationship with previous work our path is aligned with csta k 12 cs standards 7 both in terms of cryptography contents and methodologies e g unplugged activities for public key cryptosystems it also covers almost all of the basic fundamental concepts of cryptography identified for tertiary education 28 pp 24 30 adapted to the age target instead of seeking completeness and depth in technical details our choice of topics was made to convey the fundamental ideas of cryptography in line with proposals by other authors see section 2 our path is driven from start to finish by a motivating and timely social problem end to end encryption in private messaging classroom activities are contextualized in situations that are meaningful to students e g secret exchange of an exam text supported by the literature sec 2 we designed hands on activ ities in which students can directly experiment with the workings and limitations of cryptosystems we faced the additional challenge of teaching the course remotely and found a successful way to de liver an unplugged activity taking advantage of the features of the new medium while maintaining the unplugged spirit see 3 3 2 compared to other proposals sec 2 which often provide ready to use software visualizations or simulations we took a first impor tant step in cracking the black box we wanted to introduce some computational thinking by asking students to program parts of the experience e g combining programming blocks to calculate and visualize letter frequencies in order to make a frequency attack 5 experience evaluation at the end of the course we asked the students to fill two google forms to get their feedback and assess their learning no marks were foreseen for these final activities both questionnaires were completed by the same 14 out of 15 students correct answers out of 43 st ud en ts 0 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 417 40 413834282621 figure 2 distribution of correct answers 5 1 learning assesment we wrote a 2000 words summary of the important ideas and con cepts covered in the course in that summary we identified 43 key passages the students had to choose between the right filling and a wrong alternative we devised for each of them we wanted the ac tivity also to be an opportunity for students to review the important contents of the course so we structured it as a narrative 4 the results were very positive out of 43 questions the mean of correct answers was 32 5 the median was 34 with a range of correct answers between 17 and 41 see the distribution of correct answers per student in fig 2 5 2 course satisfaction in this questionnaire we asked students about their learning ex perience and the perspectives the course gave them all answers were required attendance was very high out of 14 13 students followed the first lesson 12 the second 11 the third and 12 the fourth regarding the course lenght 9 students found it adequate 4 too short only 1 student found it too long about the activities most of the students found them clear in teresting useful for their preparation and for understanding the world some students felt that the activities were too difficult for their previous knowledge fig 3 when asked if they found difficulties during the course on a four point scale from never to always 1 students answered never 11 students answered sometimes and 2 students answered often most of the difficulties were related to the difficulty of the activities the timing and organization and the distance learning setting see the details in fig 4 the same student could choose more than one option 4 the english translation of the summary with the right and wrong options is available at 23 online unplugged and block based cryptography in grade

the course to a friend 1 would not for what concerns tools used see 3 3 1 and created see 3 3 2 students highly appreciated the diffie hellman activity fig 5 a and the animated slide explainations fig 5 b some students found difficulties in both homework fig 5 c and in snap playgrounds fig 5 d finally some students found working with google forms during lessons not very useful engaging or easy fig 5 e the perceived utility of the course is relevant most of the stu dents found the course useful to better understand cryptography its matter of study its role in society students also perceived to have better understood cs and math role in society while the course clearly sparked interest about cryptography in most of the students it also helped stimulating interest in cs in 2 3 of them while less than half of them felt it has increased their interest in math for a more detailed picture see fig 6 5 2 1 open comments from students all but one of the comments were positive most students remarked that the activities were interesting and fun e g i liked the fact that through snap we were able to play and experiment with cryptography comments described the lessons as well organized and engaging even remotely one student said she really appreciated the space reserved for collective discussions in each lesson many students would have liked the course to be longer one stu dent would have wanted to delve into snap programming beyond the scope and boundaries of the proposed playgrounds the only non positive comment reports difficulties in under standing and suggests more

the observations we gathered as educators and the findings of the assessments we also provide cs educators with suggestions for adoption and possible extensions 6 1 on pedagogy and intervention results the remote unplugged diffie hellman activity was received very well simulating the insecure channel through the meeting public chat was an essential metaphor to understand the key exchange in their answers students said that the activity was engaging and fun confirming our positive impressions on the spot we refer to it as remote unplugged because it has almost all the characteristics of a cs unplugged activity i e real computer science presenting fundamental cs concepts and algorithms learning by doing fun co operative stand alone resilient to student errors see 6 except that it was delivered via technological devices in this case however the devices acted as a necessary means of communication rather than being the specific tool of computer scientists in addition we believe that an interactive executable only snap project that guided the students through the steps of the diffie hellman activity made the activity more concrete and easier to follow than with pen and paper and a list of rules especially in a remote setting the snap playgrounds we carefully designed and implemented to let students play with cryptosystems through limited sets of cus tom primitives e g encoding decoding attacking were praised as engaging and useful for the easier concepts e g caesar cipher lodi et al students increase your interest in math increase your interest in cs better understand math role in society better understand cs role in society better understand what cs is about increase your interest in crypto better understand crypto role in society better understand what crypto is about understand the workings of crypto 0 14 not at all a little rather much very much figure 6 student perceptions of what the course was useful for the block based programming playgrounds worked well as a way to get hands on experience and understand the elements of a cryp tosystem some of its possible attacks and the main limits e g the computational time required however half of the students found the more advanced playgrounds difficult we believe that the setting did not help the course was held online with students we did not know in advance and mostly did not know each other coming from different classes this resulted in severe instructor blindness making it hard for us to act as facilitators and provide the students exploring the snap playgrounds with the optimal amount of guidance 36 consequently these activities were minimally guided 37 which can be too hard especially for weaker students hence our aim to teach at least the fundamental principles of the path devised see 3 2 even in the short duration of the course led us to a less open approach first of all we moved to a more guided exploration with the remote unplugged activity on the diffie hellman algorithm after that in the final phase we moved to a more traditional approach to illustrate the more advanced schemes of asymmetric cryptography yet maintaining a socratic approach with discussions and suggestions from the students we taught the fundamental mechanisms behind secrecy and authen tication through engaging animations 22 using power rangers so that actions and messages of the different actors would be ev ident through their respective colors leaving out technical and implementation details students highly appreciated the animations explicitly saying they were really helpful to understand the final assessment focused on cryptography core ideas in line with the goals of our intervention it showed very good results see 5 1 indicating that the main contents of the course were re ceived this is good for two reasons because every citizen should understand today s digital society and because it is an opportunity for orientation towards the disciplines involved the satisfaction survey confirmed the achievement of these two goals indicating that the students better understood the cryptography role in society its matter of study and increased their interest in it 6 2 suggestions for adoption and adaption to help other educators adopt and adapt our course we provide the lessons contents and the related conceptual milestones see 3 2 an imations and snap projects 22 and the final assessment text 23 from a methodological point of view we suggest giving more time ideally double for the snap programming playground activities to let all students get used to the environment and construct their knowledge by hands on exploration the level of guidance for these activities can be adjusted if the course is in presence the teacher with the help of teaching tutors if the number of students is high can get a clearer sense of the students difficulties and address them immediately while still leaving a high degree of freedom if online where it is harder to have the pulse of the students needs interme diate steps between the playgrounds can be considered with more frequent check ins and moments of realignment additional time can also be foreseen to address other important topics e g binary representation and operations as underlying mechanisms of modern symmetric block ciphers during lessons rather than just on homework so that students can benefit from teacher support in the early stages of learning having even more time learning also some of the technical aspects e g definitions of cryptosystem elements representation of and operations on binary numbers cryptography related math topics mathematical aspects of cryptographic algorithms could be another explicit goal of this kind of intervention if so formative and final assessments also need to consider these specific learning objectives looking ahead our approach has the inherent potential to pursue learning goals related to computational thinking while the snap playgrounds we developed have narrow scopes on specific cryp tosystems the proposed activities involve some programming con cepts e g sequence function composition variables lists more custom blocks can be developed as well as activities that require a more extensive use of programming e g using other fundamental elements of structured programming like conditionals and loops looking inside custom snap blocks to adapt them to specific needs from a learning programming perspective however inspecting the code of our snap playgrounds does not have the straightforward educational value it could have the student who had the curios ity would find extensive use of javascript needed to integrate the functionalities of snap and some uninteresting workarounds put in place to overcome its limitations therefore we plan to build a stack of notional machines at different levels of abstractions so that students can progressively see more details by looking inside the blocks without being overwhelmed by all the complexity at once 30
