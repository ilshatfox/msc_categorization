a x if there exists a continuous f x y such that f a f x a a space x is cleavable over y if it is cleavable over y along all a x the subject was introduced by a v arhangel ski and d b shakhmatov in 1 though it was originally termed splitting and it was in 2 that a v arhangel ski posed the main questions related to the study of cleavability question 1 when does cleavability of a space x over a hausdorff space y imply the existence of a homeomorphism from x to a subspace of y question 2 let x be an infinite compactum cleavable over a linearly ordered topological space lots is x a lots results related to these questions can be found in but are not limited to the following papers 2 3 4 it is customary in this field that if f is a continuous function then we represent the set of points on which f is not injective as mf in this paper we show that ifx is a compact space cleavable over a separable lots y such that for some continuous f x y mf is scattered then x is a lots we do so by first considering the case when x is totally disconnected section 2 and then use that result to prove it for any compact x section 3 2 totally disconnected x in this section we show that if x is a totally disconnected compact space cleav able over a separable lots y such that for some continuous f x y mf is scattered then x is a lots we do so by showing that there exists a lots y and an injective continuous function f mapping x into y as f is a closed map f must be a homeomorphism making x a closed subspace of a lots and therefore a lots itself the main results of this section is given by theo rems 2 11 and 2 17 with the rest of the section containing tools needed for the 1 http arxiv org abs 1108 3751 v 1 proofs of the aforementioned theorems the most important of these tools are lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 and we explain their importance before the statements of the lemmas proving that x is a lots when it is totally disconnected is crucial to the proof for when x is not assumed to be totally disconnected before we prove either however it is important to provide a few definitions definition 2 1 let x be a topological space and let a be a subset of x the derived set of a written as a is the set of all limit points of a definition 2 2 for ordinal numbers the th cantor bendixson deriva tive of a topological space x is defined by transfinite induction as follows x 0 x x 1 x x x for limit ordinals the smallest ordinal such that x 1 x is called the cantor bendixson rank of x written as rank x the least ordinal such that x x is called the rank of x written as rank x to clarify if we say the rank of x is 1 we mean that x is the last derived set of x of which x is an element definition 2 3 let x be a compact lots and let a x be closed we say a non empty open interval a b x a is maximal if either a and b are both elements of a or one is an element of a and the other is an endpoint of x the following proposition and theorem are from 4 and 5 respectively proposition 2 4 if x is a compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y then x is separable and first countable theorem 2 5 if x is a countable compact metric space then x is homeomor phic to a countable ordinal lemma 2 6 if x is a countable compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y then every closed a x is homeomorphic to a countable ordinal proof this follows directly from proposition 2 4 and theorem 2 5 we now have some information about any compact totally disconnected x cleavable over a separable lots y and this will help us prove the important lemmas of this section lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 however it should be explained why these lemmas are so significant we want to answer question 2 in the affirmative if we had an injective and continuous f from x to y we would have an immediate answer as f would be an embedding and since f x would be a closed subspace of a lots x would 2 be a lots as well in a very informal sense there are two reasons why we may not be able to find an injective map from x to y either the topology on x is too complicated for the elements of x to be linearly ordered or there isn t enough room in y to continuously and injectively map all of the points of x what lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 ensure is that for any single y f mf we may find a lots y and a continuous f x y with enough room to accommodate the points of f 1 y since we will be assuming mf is scattered for some f we will eventually be able to systematically repeat the method contained in lemma 2 8 to find a y that accommodates all points of mf what lemma 2 7 actually does is strategically partitions x so that when we do find a y with more room than y lemma 2 8 finds this y our function from x to y is continuous lemma 2 7 let x be a totally disconnected first countable compact t 2 space and a a countable closed subset of x such that a is homeomorphic to some countable ordinal let h a be a homeomorphism and let a x where h x for each 1 we may then find clopen sets u x such that the following are satisfied 1 for 1 6 2 where 1 2 1 u 1 u 2 2 let c be clopen then 1 c u x 1 c is clopen 3 1 u x 1 x proof we will prove this by transfinite induction on the cantor bendixson rank of the last non empty derived set of a base case let a 0 a be the last non empty derived set of a that is all elements of a are isolated in a since a is assumed to be closed we know there are finitely many elements in a and since x is totally disconnected and t 2 we know we may partition x into finitely many clopen sets each containing only one element of a these clopen sets clearly satisfy all required properties successor case it will be easiest to prove the theorem true for the case when the last non empty derived set of a has rank 1 and then use this result to prove the general successor case let the last non empty derived set of a be a 1 and without loss of generality assume there is only one element in a 1 namely x enumerate the elements of a a 1 as xn where n since x is first countable and zero dimensional we may find a countable local base for x consisting of nested clopen sets dn n such that d 0 x and such that n dn x we may also require that a x dj xk k j that is x 0 x d 1 x 0 x 1 x d 2 and so on notice that for each j cj x dj 1 x dj is a clopen set containing xj and no other elements of a a 1 furthermore n cn x x these sets cn obviously satisfy the theorem s requirements for the general successor case let the last non empty derived set of a be a 1 and without loss of generality assume that a 1 has only one element 3 x 1 if we let b a then b 1 must be the last non empty derived set we know therefore from the first part of the successor case proof that we may partition x in such a way that x x 1 n dx n where each dx n is clopen and contains exactly one element of b b 1 namely x n when we consider this clopen set with respect to a again we notice that the rank of a dx n is less than 1 and contains only one element of a x n by the inductive hypothesis we know we may partition each dx n in such a way that fits the theorem s requirements but does the collective partitioning the one in which we consider all clopen sets created from partitioning each dx n satisfy the theorem s three requirements it is obvious that this partition satisfies requirements 1 and 3 we must now check property 2 is satisfied to clarify notation consider a dx 0 this set is homeomorphic to an ordinal 1 in fact all a dx n are homeomorphic to 1 when we use the inductive hypothesis to partition dx 0 based on a dx 0 we will write the clopen subsets as u where 1 1 1 now consider dx 1 when we use the inductive hypothesis to partition dx 1 based on a dx 1 we will again write the clopen subsets as u but our will now range over 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 to generalize when we partitiondx n using the inductive hypothesis we write our clopen sets as u where n 1 n 1 1 n 1 n 1 1 1 lastly let 1 c u x 1 c the set described in requirement 2 of the theorem be labeled ec let 1 be the ordinal to which a is homeomorphic as a is closed firstly notice that a single clopen interval a 1 b is the complement of 0 a b 1 both of which are clopen as well note that a may equal 0 and if b then b 1 will be empty further if c 1 is a clopen interval then 0 c is a clopen interval lastly all clopen subsets of 1 are the union of at most finitely many clopen intervals for these three reasons to show requirement 2 is satisfied for all clopen c 1 it is sufficient to show requirement 2 of the theorem is satisfied whenever we take c 0 a for some a 1 thus let c 1 be equal to 0 a if a 0 then ec is triv ially clopen thus let a m 1 m 1 1 for some m then ec j m dx j m 1 a m 1 a 1 u x m 1 a 1 the set j m dx j is clopen as it is the finite union of clopen sets and m 1 a m 1 a 1 u x m 1 a 1 is clopen by the in ductive hypothesis therefore requirement 2 is satisfied and the successor case is proven limit case let the last non empty derived set of a have rank let n be a monotonically increasing sequence of successor ordinals converging to and without loss of generality let a x let x n be an element of a with rank n and consider b x n n x this set is closed by compactness and first countability of x since x is first countable and zero dimensional we again know that there exists a countable local base for x consisting of nested clopen sets dn n such that n dn x and such that d 0 x we may require this local base to be such that b x dx j 1 x 0 x j 4 for every j 1 notice that for each j 1 cj 1 x dj 1 x dj is a clopen set containing xj 1 and no other elements of b furthermore n cn x x since each cj 1 is a clopen set and cj 1 a has cantor bendixson rank less than rank a we may use the inductive hypothesis to partition cj 1 into sets that satisfy the requirements of the theorem now we must check that the collective partitioning satisfies for the limit case the first and third requirements are clearly met the second requirement is proven in the exact same way as it was in the successor case this completes the proof lemma 2 8 let x be a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y and f x y a continuous function such that mf is countable then for every x mf there exists a separable lots y 1 and a continuous function f 1 x y 1 such that x mf 1 and such that mf 1 mf proof we will be relying on the notation used in theorem 2 7 let x mf let y f x and let a f 1 y let be the ordinal to which a is homeomorphic where h a is a homeomorphism and enumerate the points of a to be x such that h x it does not matter for the sake of the proof which x is equal to our original x partition x as described in theorem 2 7 with u x let y 1 be with all of the isolated ordinals replaced with f u let the order on y 1 preserve the order between the ordinals and preserve the order already on f u y let g u f u y 1 be identical to f u and let h a 1 1 y 1 be such that h x the functions g and h are clearly continuous we first claim that there exists a continuous function f 1 x y 1 let f 1 be defined as f 1 x g x x u h x x a 1 first note that each f 1 u is clopen in y 1 to show this function is con tinuous let v be an open set in y 1 for every y such that y v f 1 u for some we know there exists an open set in f 11 v containing x f 1 1 y namely f 11 v f u this is true by continuity of f 1 on u if how ever for some y v y h x for some 1 then by construction we may find an ordinal such that if b f u v and c 1 f 1 x v then b c is a clopen set of ordinals this implies by property two of theorem 2 7 that b u x c x is a clopen set in x containing f 11 y x contained in f 1 1 v therefore f 1 is continuous mf 1 mf and x mf 1 since f 1 is a continuous function from a separable space x onto a lots y 1 we know y 1 must be separable we now have two powerful lemmas we may use to prove x is a lots the following two lemmas ensure that if mf is scattered in x for some continuous 5 f then the points of f mf behave in y well enough for us to systematically implement the methods contained in lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 lemma 2 9 let x be a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleavable over a totally disconnected separable lots y if there exists a continuous f x y such that mf is scattered then f mf is scattered in y proof let f x y be the continuous function such that mf is scattered and consider f mf assume for a contradiction and without loss of generality that f mf is dense in itself let y f mf and consider f 1 y this set contains an element x such that for every other x f 1 y rank x rank x the rank we are referring to here and for the rest of this proof is its rank with respect to mf since f x is totally disconnected and zero dimensional we know there exists a clopen set v 1 containing y such that f 1 v 1 does not contain any elements of mf whose rank is greater than or equal to the rank of x otherwise by continuity there would exist a point x f 1 y such that rank x rank x let y 1 f mf v 1 y and consider f 1 y 1 we again know that there exists an element x 1 f 1 y 1 such that for every other x f 1 y 1 rank x rank x 1 since f x is totally disconnected and zero dimensional we know there exists a clopen set v 2 v 1 containing y 1 such that f 1 v 2 does not contain any elements of mf whose rank is greater than or equal to the rank of x 1 note that from this process we are creating a decreasing sequence of ordinals namely the rank of each xn since this sequence must be finite we know for some step in this process we will get to the point where yj mf vj y y 1 yj 1 is such that the greatest rank of the elements in f 1 yj is 1 that is the points of f 1 yj must be isolated in mf by continuity of f and the fact that x is both limit point and sequentially compact yj must be isolated in f mf a contradiction therefore f mf must be scattered lemma 2 10 let x be a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleavable over a totally disconnected separable lots y if there exists a continuous f x y such that mf is scattered then the rank of f mf must be less than 1 proof assume for a contradiction that rank f mf 1 if rank f mf 1 just take an appropriate subspace let a be the set of elements y f x such that f mf y 1 y we know a is non empty since f x is compact furthermore a is sequentially closed and since f x is first countable a is a closed subset of f x note that a f x f mf take f x a this is open and therefore made up of the union of open intervals since f x is a compact lots we know these open intervals are maximal consider one a b such that a b f mf 6 and such that a and b are both in a since this is a non empty open interval and f x is compact and totally disconnected there exist gap points cl and cr such that a b a cl cr b assume that c b b b as cr b is a totally disconnected compact separable lots we may partition cr b into countably many disjoint clopen intervals vm m such that m vm cr b 6 now since b a we know that cr b f mf is uncountable thus for at least one m vm f mf is uncountable as well but by construction rank vm f mf 1 therefore for some rank vm f mf vm f mf vm f mf 1 is uncountable as well around each point x vm f mf vm f mf 1 we may take an open interval around x containing no other point of vm f mf vm f mf 1 thereby creating uncountably many disjoint open intervals which contradicts the fact that f x is separable thus the rank of f mf must be less than 1 we are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section note that while we are assuming y is totally disconnected for now we will be able to drop this assumption and prove the theorem holds for any separable y theorem 2 11 let x be a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleavable over a totally disconnected separable lots y if there exists a continuous f x y such that mf is scattered then x is a lots proof we will prove this by transfinite induction on the cantor bendixson rank of f mf base case if the rank of f mf is 0 then it is empty and the theorem is true vacuously it would be useful however to exhibit the proof for the case where rank f mf 1 therefore let f mf 0 be the last non empty derived set of f mf enumerate the elements of f mf as yj where j v let uj be a clopen set containing yj and no other yk for k 6 j by lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 we know we may find a lots u j and a continuous function fj f 1 uj u j such that mfj let y y with each uj replaced with u j let f j f 1 uj u j y be identical to the function fj let f x j v f 1 uj y be identical to f note that x j v f 1 uj may be empty and let g x y be defined as the following g x f x x x j v f 1 uj f j x x f 1 uj then g is continuous mg is empty and since g is an injective continuous function from x to y x is a lots successor case there are two successor cases to consider when rank f mf 1 where is a successor ordinal and when rank f mf 1 where is a limit ordinal first assume rank f mf 1 where is a successor ordinal and assume it is true that if the rank of f mf is then x is a lots since is a successor ordinal let it be equal to 1 enumerate the elements of f mf as yj where j v since f x is a totally disconnected lots we may find clopen intervals uj containing yj and no other yk for k 6 j such that f mf j v uj now consider a single uj this clopen set has only 7 one element of f mf f mf 1 label it x j enumerate the points of f mf uj x j as yj m where m since uj is also a totally dis connected compact lots we may find clopen intervals vj m uj containing yj m and no other yj k for k 6 m the rank of each vj m f mf is 1 therefore by the inductive hypothesis we may find a clopen lots v j m and find a continuous function fj m f 1 vj m v j m such that mfj m let y 1 be y with each vj m replaced with v j m we may then find a continuous function g 1 from x to y 1 such that mg 1 f 1 f mf we are now left with a situation where rank g 1 mg 1 1 therefore we know we may find a lots y 2 and a continuous function g 2 x y 2 such that mg 2 making x a lots now let rank f mf 1 where is a limit ordinal and assume we have shown that if the rank of f mf is for 1 then x is a lots enu merate the elements of f mf as yj where j v since f x is a totally disconnected lots we may find clopen intervals uj containing yj and no other yk for k 6 j such that f mf j v uj now consider uj this clopen set has only one element of f mf namely yj for some 1 we know there exists a sequence of elements yj n contained in f mf 1 f mf 2 u converging to yj since uj is a totally disconnected lots and a clopen inter val we know we may partition uj into countably many disjoint clopen intervals vj n such that yj n vj n for every n and n vj n yj uj each f mf vj n must have cantor bendixson rank less than 1 therefore we know by the inductive hypothesis that we may find a lots v j n and a contin uous function gj n f 1 vj n v j n such that mgj n let y 1 be y with each vj n replaced by v j n for every n and for every j v let g x y be equal to f on x j v uj yj j v if it is not empty and equal to gj n on each vj n then mg yj j v and we are now left with a situation in which the rank of f mg 1 therefore we know x is a lots limit case let the cantor bendixson rank of f mf be equal to where is a limit ordinal and assume we have shown that if rank f mf then x is a lots let a be the set of x f x f mf such that there exists a sequence of elements in f mf xn converging to x where sup rank xn we know that a is non empty as f x is compact first countable and therefore sequentially compact we also know from the way we have defined a that it is sequentially closed thus a is closed as in a first countable space every sequentially closed subset is closed also notice that a is nowhere dense in f x take f x a this is open and therefore made up of the union of open intervals since f x is a compact lots we know these open intervals are maximal the set f mf must be contained within x a and since f x is separable we know there may only be countably many of these maximal open intervals enumerate them as an bn where n v take a single maximal open interval am bm assume both am and bm are 8 elements of a and that the sequences that qualify am and bm to be elements of a are both contained within this open interval since this is a non empty open interval and f x is compact and totally disconnected there exist gap points cl and cr such that am bm am cl cr bm now take cr bm and let ym n be a sequence contained in cr bm f mf that converges only to bm as cr bm is a totally disconnected compact lots we may partition cr bm into clopen intervals vm n n such that vm n contains ym n and such that n vm n cr bm by construction each vm n f mf has cantor bendixson rank less than therefore by the inductive hypothesis we know there exists a lots v m n and a continuous function fm n f 1 vm n v m n such that mfm n let y 1 be y with each vm n replaced by v m n for every m v n then there exists a continuous function g 1 x y 1 composed piecewise of functions identical to fm n for all m v n such that mg 1 proving x is a lots we have now proved that x is a lots when y is totally disconnected but what if y is not totally disconnected the following lemma allows us to find a totally disconnected separable lots y that we may use instead of y in order to complete the proof of the theorem note that this lemma also looks very similar to lemma 2 8 while the statements differ only slightly they are actually exhibiting very different properties what lemma 2 8 showed is that we may enlarge y so that f is injective on more points of x lemma 2 16 shows that we may find a totally disconnected separable y and a continuous f x y such that we may implement theorem 2 11 to show x is a lots to begin we must state a new definition and three introductory theorems definition 2 12 let x be a topological space y a b a lots and let f be a continuous function from x to y we say a point y y can be separated if there exists x 1 x 2 x such that f x 1 f x 2 y a space y a yl yr b and a continuous function g x y such that if h embeds a y y b y into y in the obvious way then g x h f x when f x 6 y g x yl if x f 1 a y f 1 a y and g x yr if x f 1 y b f 1 y b for example if the double arrow space were mapped onto the unit interval 0 1 in the obvious way then every point in 0 1 can be separated the following two theorems may be found in 6 and 7 respectively theorem 2 13 every first countable compact scattered space is metrizable theorem 2 14 every uncountable compact metric space includes a closed dense in itself subspace theorem 2 15 every first countable compact scattered space is countable proof this follows from theorems 2 13 and 2 14 lemma 2 16 let x be a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y if f x y is a continuous function such that mf 9 is countable then there exists a totally disconnected separable lots y and a continuous f x y such that m f mf proof let x a b where a is perfect b is scattered and a b if a is empty then by theorems 2 15 and 2 5 we must have that x is homeomorphic to a countable ordinal then our totally disconnected separable lots y would be this countable ordinal and our f would be a homeomorphism if a is non empty then let d f x be a connected component we must have that f a d d to see this assume without loss of generality that f x is connected we will show that f a f x assume for a contradiction that f a 6 f x since a is perfect and f is continuous f a must be closed and f x f a must be non empty and open let a b be a non empty open interval contained in f x f a and let c a b be a closed interval we must have that c is uncountable since it is perfect and therefore f 1 c b is a compact first countable scattered set which is uncountable this contradicts theorem 2 15 therefore to prove this lemma it is sufficient to assume x is perfect there are three cases to consider either f x is totally disconnected already and then we have completed the proof f x is connected or f x contains a connected component if it is either of the latter two cases we will prove this by showing that if d is the set of points of f x that can be separated then d is dense in the connected components of f x without loss of generality we will assume f x c d is connected if it were not connected we could modify the proof to consider an arbitrary con nected component of f x now take x 1 x 2 mf such that f x 1 f x 2 let u 1 and u 2 be clopen sets containing x 1 and x 2 respectively such that u 2 x u 1 then both f u 1 and f u 2 are closed in f x and f x f u 1 is open therefore there exists a maximal open interval a 2 b 2 contained in f x f u 1 assume without loss of generality that b 2 f u 1 f u 2 note that b 2 may equal f x 1 sincemf is countable and this intersection is closed in f x then by theorem 2 5 f u 1 f u 2 must be homeomorphic to a countable ordinal for the sake of this example we may assume b 2 is isolated in f u 1 f u 2 otherwise we may take another element that is isolated in this intersection as b 2 is isolated in f u 1 f u 2 f x is connected and x is dense in itself this implies that there exists a maximal open subset of f x f u 2 namely b 2 c that is a 2 b 2 f x f u 1 is maximal b 2 f u 1 f u 2 and b 2 c f x f u 2 therefore b 2 can be separated first note that f mf must be dense in f x as otherwise we would have a connected subset of x a contradiction as x is totally disconnected now to see that d is dense in f x let a b be an open interval in f x and let a b a b be closed if we take x f 1 a b the topology on x to be the subset topology and f x x y as our fixed continuous function we may repeat the previous argument and find a z f x mf x a b that can be separated this implies d is dense in f x since d f mf and f mf is countable we may enumerate the points of 10 d as yn where n v let y 1 be the lots created after we have separated y 1 into y 1 l and y 1 r with f 1 x y 1 let yj 1 be the lots created after we have separated yj 1 in which y 1 l y 1 r and fj is the continuous function mapping x into yj let y be the space created after all points yj have been separated into yj l and yj r for all j v and let the order on y be such that y 1 y 2 if and only if for some m v y 1 y 2 in yk for every k m note that this relation preserves the order between those points of f x that were not separated and orders the points added during separation this is obviously a linear order let the topology on y be the linear order topology note that the space is totally disconnected since the points that can be separated are dense in f x we will now show that there exists a continuous function from x to y informally what this function will be doing is mapping fibers of points that have been separated to the appropriate places in y and mapping the fibers of points that have no been separated to where they would normally go to now formally define f let s be those elements x x such that f x maps onto a point that can be separated and let the set of points of y that were not created by separating points in y be written as t notice that t can be embedded into y let h be such an embedding let g x s y be such that g x h 1 f x let f x y be defined as f x g x x x s fj x x f 1 yj let us show this is continuous let y d e and consider d c y if c was not separated in the construction of y then f 1 d c f 1 d c which we know is open in x by continuity of f if on the other hand c was separated then let c cl then f 1 d cl f 1 d c which is again open in x if c cr then f 1 d c f 1 j d cr which we know is open in x by continuity of fj by a nearly identical argument the sets f 1 c e are open in x as well therefore f is a continuous map from x to a totally disconnected lots y it is obvious that m f mf theorem 2 17 let x be a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y if there exists a continuous f x y such that mf is scattered then x is a lots proof this follows directly from theorems 2 11 and 2 16 3 true for all x we have now shown that if x is a totally disconnected compact t 2 space cleav able over a separable lots y such that for some continuous f x y we have mf is scattered then x is a lots in order to explain how we will use 11 this result to prove that x is a lots even when it is not totally disconnected we must first state a theorem from 4 theorem 3 1 if c is a continuum cleavable over a lots y then c is home omorphic to a subspace of y and is also therefore a lots in this section we will combine the results from theorems 2 17 and 3 1 to show x is a lots that is let x be a compact t 2 space cleavable over a sepa rable lots y x is formed by a combination of trivial connected components single points and non trivial connected components we will first show that if we remove the interior of each of the non trivial connected components the result is a closed totally disconnected subspace of x which by theorem 2 17 is a lots under the subspace topology we will then use this linear order combined with the linear order on each connected component given to us by theorem 3 1 to show that the topology derived from the combined linear order on x is equivalent to the original topology on x the are two obstacles in our way however while the connected components of x may be a lots under the subspace topology we must first ensure that the interior of these connected components do not interact with the rest of the space see lemma 3 6 and second ensure that each family of connected components behaves as if x were a lots see lemma 3 7 after we have proved these properties true we show x is a lots in theorem 3 8 which is the main result of this paper we begin by citing another result from 4 and one result from 2 theorem 3 2 let x a b be a linearly ordered continuum let f be a continuous mapping of x onto a lots such that f a f b let c d be elements in x whose images are the two end points of f x then for any x x c d there exists y x x such that f x f y lemma 3 3 let a and b be disjoint subsets of a set x and let f be a family of mappings of the set x into sets y where is an infinite cardinal number and let us also assume that for every the cardinality of the set m x x a b f x f x x is not less than then there exist disjoint subsets u and v of x such that a u b v and f u f v 6 for every lemma 3 4 the space x 0 1 1 2 with the subspace topology inherited from the product 0 1 1 is not cleavable over r proof arhangel ski proved this to be true in 2 but it would useful for us to give an example as to why let s be the irrationals and let a s 0 1 4 1 4 3 4 q 3 4 1 then no continuous f x r can cleave apart a from its complement the following lemma is also well known lemma 3 5 if x is a space cleavable over a lots y then every d x is also cleavable over y 12 lemma 3 6 let x be a compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y let cn an bn n be a family of non trivial connected components of x such that the sequences an and bn both converge to x for some x x if wn is a sequence made up of elements such that wn an bn for every n then we must have that wn converges to x as well proof what this lemma is trying to show is that families of connected compo nents of x behave in the same way as if x were a lots let cn an bn n be a family of non trivial connected components of x assume for a contradiction that both an and bn converge to a single point x but some sequence wn where each wn belongs to a different connected component cn converges to a point x 6 x we will show that such an x cannot be cleavable over a separable lots y all continuous functions from x to y either cleave apart x and x or they do not of those that do cleave apart x and x if none of them were injective on each cn then by theorem 3 2 and lemma 3 3 we may construct a set a along which no continuous f x y can cleave therefore there must exist a continuous f that cleaves apart x and x and such that every f cm is injective consider f x since f cleaves apart x and x we know f x 6 f x and since y is hausdorff let v 1 and v 2 be disjoint open intervals containing f x and f x respectively by continuity of f and by assumption f x must also contain all but finitely many of the f an and f bn let j be the least element of such that f am and f bm are contained in v 1 for every m j as f is injective on each cn this implies that if f am and f bm are elements of v 1 then f cm v 1 as well therefore f cm v 1 for every m j but v 2 must contain all but finitely many of the f wm thus for every open v 1 f x and open v 2 f x v 1 v 2 6 this contradicts the fact that y is hausdorff therefore the sequence wn must converge to x lemma 3 7 let x be a compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y if c x is a non trivial connected component and x c is such that x x c x c then x must be an endpoint of c proof were x not an endpoint of c this situation would be indentical to the one described in lemma 3 4 and we know such a c and x would imply that x is actually not cleavable over y though we were assuming y to be r is lemma 3 4 and we are not assuming that in this theorem we may find a subset of y that cannot be cleaved apart from its complement for the same reason as to why the set a in lemma 3 4 could not be cleaved from its complement therefore x must be an endpoint of c up to this point we have shown that x behaves like a lots on certain subsets all that is left to do is to use these lemmas to prove that the topology on x is equivalent to a lots the following theorem is the main result of this paper theorem 3 8 let x be a compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y then x is a lots 13 proof if x is either totally disconnected or connected then we know by the orems 3 1 and 2 17 that x is a lots therefore assume x is neither totally disconnected nor connected define d x to be those elements of x that are in the interior of non trivial connected components and let c x d i first claim that c is a closed totally disconnected subset of x it is obvious by construction that c is totally disconnected to prove it is closed it is sufficient to show that c is sequentially closed asx is first countable and therefore sequential let xn be a sequence contained in c if it does not converge or contain a convergent subsequence then it is obviously sequentially closed in c now assume it does converge without loss of generality to a single point x if x belongs to a non trivial connected component then by lemma 3 7 x must be an endpoint of the connected component and therefore a member of c if x does not belong to a non trivial connected component then it belongs to c by assumption therefore c is sequentially closed and closed in x by theorem 2 17 c is a lots under the subspace topology of x we also know each connected component of x has a topology equivalent to the linear order topology thus there is a linear order on x that matches the linear orders on both c and d we claim the topology derived from this linear order on x o is equal to the original topology of x x to first show x o let u be a basic open set in x we must show for every x u there exists a basic open interval in o that is a subset of u if x u d then by theorem 3 1 we may find an open interval containing x contained in u now let x u c without loss of generality let x be the left endpoint of some non trivial connected component if it is not part of a connected component then we may modify the proof by theorem 3 1 we know we may find an element of the connected component z such that x z u now if x is isolated from the left within the linear order on x then there exists some greatest x x and thus x x z u if x is not isolated from the left then by theorem 2 17 we know there exists a y c such that y x c must be contained in u we claim y z must be contained within u assume for a contradiction that y z is not a subset u since we know y z c is contained within u the only elements preventing y z from being within u are the elements of the non trivial connected components this implies that there is a countable family of connected components cn an bn n contained within y z such that an converges to x but such that there exists a sequence of elements wn each wn contained within a different connected component which converges to a point other than x by lemma 3 6 this is impossible thus x y z u and x o to show o x it is sufficient to show that b and a are both open in x let b c such that b is without loss of generality the left endpoint of a non trivial connected component again if it is not an endpoint of some connected component we may modify the proof accordingly we will show that b is closed in x and thus x b b is open to show b is closed in x it is enough to show it is sequentally closed let xn be a sequence contained in b that converges to a single point x x is first countable and compact thus sequentially compact if x d then 14 all but finitely many points of the sequence must be contained within the same connected component to which x belongs thus if xn n b then x must be contained within b as well if however x c then assume without loss of generality it is the left endpoint of a non trivial connected component if xn is a monotonically decreasing sequence we would have the same case as when x d so x must be contained within b as well there fore assume the sequence is monotonically increasing if all but finitely many of these elements are contained within c then by theorem 2 17 we know if xn n b then x must be contained within b assume how ever that infinitely many of these elements are member of d that is they belong to non trivial connected components we know only finitely many of this sequence may belong to the same connected component otherwise there exists a subsequence that converges to a point other than x thus without loss of generality assume each member of d in this sequence belongs to a different connected component from the way we have defined the order on x we know the right end point yn of the connected component to which xn belongs will be contained within b we know this new sequence yn converges to x as well we are now left with the same situation we have just considered in which there exists a monotonically increasing sequences of elements of c converging to x therefore we know if xn n b then x must be contained within b since we have considered all types of sequences contained in b and have proven this set is sequentially closed it must therefore be closed in x this implies b is open in x by a similar argument we may show a is open in x as well thus o x implying o x and that x is a lots 4 conclusion in 2 arhangel ski stated one motivation for cleavability as a generalization of injective mappings that is if an injective map from a compact space x to a hausdorff space y gives us as much information about x as we have about y then how much can we find out about a compact x if it is cleavable over a hausdorff y as a motivating question he asks if an infinite compactum cleavable over a lots is a lots itself we have now provided a partial answer to arhangelski s question showing that if x is a compact space cleavable over a separable lots y such that there exists a continuous f x y with mf scattered then x is a lots this gives us a great amount of information about x as many papers have been written detailing properties of compact separable lots some of which can be found in 8 and 9 the following questions however still remain open question 3 let x be a compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y is x homeomorphic to a subspace of y question 4 let x be a compact t 2 space cleavable over a separable lots y must there exist a continuous f x y such that mf is countable and scattered in x 15 references 1 arkhangel ski a v and shakhmatov d b 1990 journal
