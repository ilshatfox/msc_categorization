s is an n set and a is a col lection of k subsets of s such that each t subset of s occurs exactly in elements of a then a is favorit and well studied traditional t n k combinatorial design t n and 1 see 1 3 however these finite traditional designs has been gen eralized in infinite designs in 3 also generalized designs have been introduced for the first time in 2 as a generalization of combinatorial designs in different mathematical categories like category of well ordered sets topological spaces etc we use term top design when our reference category is the category of topological spaces using the same notations as in 2 in topological spacex for nonempty subsets c d of x nonzero cardinal number and collection a of subsets of x using statements where by s t we mean s and t are homeomorphic spaces i b a b d ii b a b d x b x d iii e x e c card b a e b iv e x e c x e x c card b a e b we say a is a c x d top design of type 1 if ii and iii c x d top design of type 2 if i and iii c x d top design of type 3 if ii and iv c x d top design of type 4 if i and iv let s mention that if b x equip x with topology u x b u x u is finite then we say x is a fort space with particular point b 4 counterexample 24 one may find counterexamples regarding c 1 n n 1 0 d top designs in 2 note to the fact that 1 n n 1 0 with induced topology of r is an infinite countable fort space leads us to study other types of infinite fort spaces in the approach of top designs note 1 1 two fort spaces are homeomorph if and only if they are in one to one correspondence moreover in fort space x with particular point b infinite subset y 1 http arxiv org abs 1804 10786 v 1 2 m pourattar f ayatollah zadeh shirazi of x as subspace topology has fort topology if and only if b y all finite subsets of x are finite discrete spaces and carry fort topology structure convention 1 2 in the following text suppose x is an infinite fort space with the particular point b 2 results in top designs on x in this section we study the existence of c x d for different cs and ds lemma 2 1 for u v x with u v and x u x v we have 1 b u if and only if b v i e u b v b 2 for infinite u with card u card x and h x we have u h and x u x h if and only if card u card h and u b h b proof 1 first suppose u is infinite so v is infinite too since b is the unique limit point of any infinite subset of x u contains a limit point if and only if b u on the other hand u contains a limit point if and only if v contains a limit point which means b v in its turn now suppose u is finite thus x u is infinite and using a similar method described above we have b x u if and only if b x v which completes the proof 2 suppose card u card h and u b h b then card u b card h b thus there exists bijection f u b h b if b u then b h and f u b u h b h is a homeomorphism of discrete spaces too if b u then b h too and f u h with f u b f and f b b is a homeomorphism of infinite fort spaces u and h with particular point b so u h on the other hand if card u card h card x then card x u card x h card x also if u b h b then x u b x h b so if card u card h card x and u b h b then card x u card x h and x u b x h b which shows x u x h by the above argument use item 1 to complete the proof of 2 note that if there exists a c x d top design of type i then there exists u d with c u so card c card u card d therefore card c min card d card c card x theorem 2 2 regarding 1 st type of top designs for nonempty subsets c d of x we have a suppose b c d a 1 if c is finite then there is not any c x d top design of type 1 a 2 if c is infinite and card c card x then there exist and a c x d top design of type 1 a 3 if card c card d card x then there exist and a c x d top design of type 1 if and only if d x b b if b c d then there is not any c x d top design of type 1 c suppose b d c 1 for finite c there exist and a c x d top design of type 1 if and only if card c 2 card d top designs in the category of fort spaces 3 c 2 if c is infinite and card c min card d card c card x then there exist and a c x d top design of type 1 c 3 if card c card d card x then there exist and a c x d top design of type 1 if and only if d x proof let w e x e d x e x d by item 1 in lemma 2 1 it s evident that b d if and only if b w resp b w a 1 choose k c if a is a c x d top design of type 1 then a w and a is a c k b x d top design of type 1 too which is a contradiction since b w a 2 we have the following sub cases card c card d card x in this case by item 2 in lemma 2 1 we have w e x b card e card d using card x b card x c b for w e x c b card e card d we have card w card w it s evident that w w e 7 e c is one to one so card w card f w c f card w thus card f w c f card w since c is infinite and b c for all subset e of x with c e we have card c card e and b e so by a similar method described for c we have card f w e f card w hence w is a c x d card w top design of type 1 card c card d card x in this case by lemma 2 1 w e x b card e card d card x e card x d since card c card d and c d carry discrete topologies thus c can be embedded in d and without any loss of generality we may suppose c d by infiniteness of d at least one of the sets d c or c is infinite and card c card x card d card c card d c max card c card d c so we have max card c card d c card d c card x since 2 card d c card d c we may choose h d c with card h card d c h card d c h card d c card x let k f d h c card f b card x d and consider the following claim claim for f k we have c x f b w suppose f k so f d h c so h x f b x thus card x f b card x card d and card x d card f b card x x f b therefore x f b w also f d h c and b c show c x f b therefore k b w c b f 7 x f b is well defined and clearly one to one thus card k card b w c b card w however using card d h c card x b we have card w card e x b card e card x d b card f d h c card f card x d b card k 4 m pourattar f ayatollah zadeh shirazi which leads to card k card b w c b card w for e x with e c so b e we have d d c e w and w e x b card e card d card x e card x d using a similar method described above we have card b w e b card w thus w is a c x d card w top design of type 1 a 3 in this case if a is a c x d top design of type 1 then there exists b a with x b b since c x b which leads to d x b and w x b is a c x d 1 top design of type 1 b use the fact that if b d then for all b x with d b and x d x b we have b b and in particular c b c 1 first suppose a is a c x d top design of type 1 and d is finite then for all subsets h of x with card h card c there exists b a with h b however we may assume b h using b b we have card h card b b card d 1 hence card c 1 card d if card c 1 card d then any subset of x b with card c elements occurs in just one element of a and a s b s x b card s card c now choose a subset j of x b with card c 1 elements then infinite elements of a contain j b c which is in contradiction with 1 so card c 1 card d and card c 2 card d in order to complete the proof we have the following cases case 1 x is uncountable and d is infinite in this case choose infinite countable subset i of d b by the proof of a 2 for w b e x e d b x e x d b is a i x d b card w b top design of first type we show w is a c x d card w top design of first type consider h x with h c there exists j x b with h b j and j i so card w b card b w b h b b card b w b j b card w b therefore card b w b h b b card w b considering bijection w b w b 7 b b and b w we have card b w h b b card b w b h b b card w b card w which leads to card b w h b card w and w is a c x d card w top design of first type case 2 x d and x d are infinite countable in this case we may suppose x b pn n 1 and d p 2 n n 1 b with distinct pns let a x p 2 k 1 k s s 1 then a is a c x d 0 top design of type 1 case 3 x and d are infinite countable and x d 6 is finite in this case w is infinite countable and a c x d 0 top design of type 1 case 4 x d is infinite countable in this case w x is a c x d 1 top design of type 1 case 5 d is finite and card c 2 card d in this case card w card x since for infinite set x we have card x card pfin x where pfin x is the collection of all finite subsets of x and w is a c x d card x top design of type 1 c 2 in this case by the proof of a 2 w is a c b x d b card w top design of type 1 using b w shows that w is a c x d card w top design of type 1 too c 3 use a similar method described in the proof of a 3 top designs in the category of fort spaces 5 lemma 2 3 for nonempty subsets c d of x c can be embedded into d if and only if c is finite or b c d and card c card d proof suppose c can be embedded in d and choose e d with e c so card c card e card d if c is infinite and b c then any subset of x homeomorphic with c contains b thus b e d and b c d theorem 2 4 for nonempty subsets c d of x there exist and a c x d top design of type 2 if and only if c can be embedded into d proof if we can not embed c into d it s evident that there is not any c x d top design of type 2 conversely suppose c can be embedded in d so by lemma 2 3 card c card d and c is finite or b c d let l e x e d we have the following cases card c card d and c is finite in this case l is a c x d top design of type 2 with 1 card c card d card e x card e card d otherwise for this aim use the fact that e x c card e card d e x card e card d with e e c is bijective card c min card c card d card x and b c d in this case by theorem 2 2 there exists and c x d top design of type 1 so it is a c x d top design of type 2 too card c min card c card d card x and b c d in this case a x b d b is a c x d 1 top design of type 2 theorem 2 5 regarding 3 rd type of top designs for nonempty subsets c d of x there exist and a c x d top design of type 3 if and only if b c d card c b card d b and card x d b card x c b proof let w e x e d x e x d if a is a c x d top design of type 3 then a w and we have the following cases case 1 b c d in this case for all e a w we have b e and c 6 e thus a is not a c x d top design of type 3 case 2 card c b card d b and b c d or b c d in this case we have card c card d so we can not embed c into d and it s evident that there is not any c x d top design of type 3 case 3 card c b card d b b d c in this case for all b a b b and card c card c b card d b card b b so c 6 b b and c 6 b so a is not a c x d top design of type 3 case 4 card x d b card x c b in this case for all e w we have card x e b card x c b thus x e b 6 x c b and c 6 e so there is not any c x d top design of type 3 considering the above cases b c d card c b card d b and card x d b card x c b conversely suppose b c d card c b card d b and card x d b card x c b then w is a c x d top design of type 3 for 6 m pourattar f ayatollah zadeh shirazi card e w c e note that for f x with f c and x f x c the map e w f e e w c e e 7 e f c is bijective theorem 2 6 for nonempty subsets c d of x there exist and a c x d top design of type 4 if and only if c can be embedded into d proof if c can be embedded into d then there exist 0 and a c x d top design of type 2 like a by theorem 2 4 so a is a c x d top design of type 4 too conversely it s evident that if a is a top design of type i for i 1 2 3 4 then there exists e a with c e using e d leads us to the fact that ccan be embedded into d theorem 2 7 for nonempty subsets c d ofx the following statements are equiv alent there is not any c x d top design of type 2 there is not any c x d top design of type 4 c is infinite and b c d or card c card d c can not be embedded into d proof theorems 2 4 2 6 and lemma 2 3 acknowledgement the authors
