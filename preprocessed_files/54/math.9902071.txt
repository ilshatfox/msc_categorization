space if x is scattered of cantor bendixson rank and is homeomorphic to each of its subspaces of same rank we answer a question of steprans by constructing a countable toronto space for each we also construct consistent examples of countable toronto spaces for each 1 1 introduction for a space x let x 0 x let x 1 be the non isolated points of x and for a limit let x x x is scattered if x for some in this case we call the least such the cantor bendixson rank r x of x the set x x 1 i e the isolated points of x is called the th level of x the so called toronto problem posed by j steprans s asks if there is an uncountable non discrete hausdorff space x which is homeomorphic to each of its uncountable subspaces such a space if it exists is called a toronto space according to the folklore a toronto space must be scattered of cantor bendixson rank 1 and hereditarily separable in particular each level must be countable the toronto problem is still unsettled though it is known that there are no toronto spaces under ch or under pfa if regularity is assumed taking a cue from the structure of a toronto space steprans calls a space x an toronto space if x is scattered of rank and x is homeomorphic to each of its subspaces of the same rank for example a convergent sequence is 2 toronto steprans asks if there is an toronto space and mentions that it is unknown if there is an toronto space for any 3 the main result of this paper is that there is a countable toronto space for any and there are consistent examples of countable toronto spaces for each 1 given a filter f on let f be all x such that x f 6 for every f f f is said to be homogeneous if for any x f the restriction of the filter f to x is isomorphic to f let us also denote by f the filter on generated by sets of the form f f f we will show in section 2 that if there is a homogeneous filter f on which is isomorphic to the filter f on 2 then there is an toronto space for every if f has a certain additional property see theorem 2 11 then there is an toronto space for every 1 in section 3 we describe in zfc a filter f which is homogeneous and isomor phic to f thus there are countable toronto spaces in zfc for every this filter does not have the additional property required to build countable toronto spaces for 1 in section 4 we show that it is consistent for there research of the first author partially supported by nsf dms 9704849 typeset by ams tex 1 http arxiv org abs math 9902071 v 1 2 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore to be a filter having also the additional property and hence consistent for there to be countable toronto spaces for every 1 we don t know if such filters i e having the additional property exist in zfc or if there can be countable toronto spaces in zfc for 1 our construction also produces consistent toronto spaces for 1 and 1 1 albeit with uncountable levels we don t know if there can be an 1 toronto space with countable levels in section 5 we show that a very natural construction of spaces from a filter which is somewhat different from our construction in section 2 cannot produce toronto spaces for 4 though it does give other 3 toronto spaces in zfc 2 toronto spaces from the filter given a filter f on we will define corresponding scattered spaces t an ordinal of rank t will be countable iff 1 most other properties of the spaces t will depend on properties of the filter f we will show theorem 2 10 that if f is homogeneous and isomorphic to the filter f then t is an toronto space for if f has an additional property see theorem 2 11 then t is toronto for all 1 if xn n is a sequence of disjoint spaces and f is a filter on let xn n f denote the space whose set is n xn such that each xn is a clopen subspace and a neighborhood of has the form n f xn where f f if f is a filter on a set a then xa a a f is defined similarly let t 0 be the empty space and t 1 a single point space let t 1 n t n f if is a limit ordinal and t has been defined for all let t t clearly t is scattered of rank and is countable iff 1 to verify other properties of the spaces t given properties of the filter f it will be helpful to establish some general facts about the f construction lemma 2 1 if w xn n f then w n w xn 6 f proof clear lemma 2 2 if hn xn yn is a homeomorphism for each n then the map h xn n f yn n f defined by h and h x hn x for x xn is a homeomorphism proof that h is a bijection and continous at every point except possibly is clear it follows from lemma 2 1 that w h w thus h is also continuous at the proof that h 1 is continuous is similar thus h is a homeomorphism lemma 2 3 for each a xn n f xn n a f a xn n a f a proof that the obvious mapping is a homeomorphism follows easily from lemma 2 1 noting that b f iff either b a f or b a f another straightforward application of lemma 2 1 shows countable toronto spaces 3 lemma 2 4 for spaces xn and yn n we have xn yn n f xn n f yn n f lemma 2 5 if f is homogeneous then for any a f we have xn n f yn zn n f where yn n is a re indexing of xn n a and zn xn for n a while zn for n a proof by homogeneity xn n a f a is homeomorphic to yn n f for some re indexing yn n of xn n a also it is clear that xn n a f a is homeomorphic to zn n f where the zn s are as given in the statement of the lemma the lemma now follows by applying lemma 2 3 the above remarks and lemma 2 4 lemma 2 6 if f is homogenous and not the co finite filter then t is homeo morphic to every topological sum of t and countably many t for proof the result is obvious for t 0 and t 1 suppose it holds for all if is a limit ordinal then t is by definition the topological sum of the t s for and the result follows easily from the induction hypothesis suppose is a successor say 1 and consider t n xn where each xn is homeomorphic to some t n n note that f homogenous and not the co finite filter implies that t is homeomorphic the topological sum of itself and countably many copies yn n of t now t n xn t n yn n xn t n xn yn by the induction hypothesis each xn yn is homeomorphic to one or two copies of t and the result follows lemma 2 7 for any filter f on and disjoint spaces xn m n m xn m n m 2 f m xn m n f proof note that for a 2 a f 1 a f now it is easy to use lemma 2 1 to verify that the obvious mapping is a homeomorphism the next lemma shows that if in the definition of t 1 each copy n t of t is replaced by the sum of finitely many or countably infinitely many copies of t the result is homeomorphic to t 1 provided f has the stated properties lemma 2 8 if f is homogeneous and isomorphic to f then n t n f m kn n m t n f where 0 kn proof let a n n kn then a f by the assumptions on f f a is isomorphic to f and f use an isomorphism between f a and f to constuct the natural bijection between the spaces then use b f a 1 b f to show via lemma 2 1 that this bijection is a homeomorphism 4 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore lemma 2 9 suppose f is homogeneous and isomorphic to f if a f then xn n f m y m n n f where y mn n m is a reshuffling of the xi s and for each n m y mn xi for some i a proof we have xn n f xn n a f a xn n a f a m w m n n f zn n f where the wmn s are a reindexing of the xn s n a and the zn are as is lemma 2 5 the first homeomorphism exists by lemma 2 3 and the second follows from f being homogeneous and isomorphic to f and lemma 2 7 now by lemma 2 4 the latter quotient space is homeomorphic to zn m w m n n f finally for each n let y mn m be a reindexing of zn w m n m theorem 2 10 if f is homogeneous and isomorphic to f then tn is a countable n toronto space for every n and any subspace of tn of rank j n is homeomorphic to a topological sum of countably many copies of tj proof clearly the theorem holds for n 1 also if it holds for all n it is easy to check that it holds for n since t is just the topological sum of the tn s n we will complete the proof by showing that the theorem holds for n k 1 given it holds for n k where k to this end let x be a subspace of tk 1 if is either not in x or is an isolated point of x it is easy to use the induction hypothesis to verify the conclusion of the theorem so suppose is a limit point of x let xn x n tk note that x xn n f let j 0 k be maximal such that n r xn j 0 f then there is f 0 f such that j 0 max r xn n f 0 and a 0 n f 0 r xn j 0 f let n 0 be the clopen neighborhood n f 0 xn of in x note n 0 xn n f 0 f by homogeneity and lemma 2 5 n 0 is homeomorphic to yn zn n f where yn n is a re indexing of xn n a 0 and each zn is either or xm for some m f 0 a by the induction hypothesis since r zn r yn j 0 each yn zn is a topological sum of countably many copies of tj 0 so by lemma 2 8 n 0 is homeomorphic to tj 0 1 let n 1 x n 0 by the induction hypothesis n 1 is homeomorphic to a topological sum of countably many copies of tj 1 for some j 1 k of course x n 0 n 1 if j 0 k which happens iff r x k 1 then n 0 and by lemma 2 6 x are homeomorphic to tk 1 if j 0 k then by lemma 2 6 x is homeomorphic to a topological sum of countably many copies of tmax j 0 1 j 1 that completes the proof theorem 2 11 suppose f is homogeneous and isomorphic to f and satisfies whenever f is unbounded on every f f there is some a f such that f a is finite to one then t is a countable toronto space for every 1 and any subspace of t of rank is homeomorphic to a topological sum of countably many copies of t proof theorem 2 10 shows this theorem holds for suppose it holds for all where 1 and consider x t if is a limit then t t by the induction hypothesis each subspace x t ofx is homeomorphic to the topological sum of copies of t for some countable toronto spaces 5 now one can use lemma 2 6 to split up or group these t s in the appropriate way to show that x tr x if r x is a limit ordinal and is homeomorphic to the sum of countably many copies of tr x otherwise it remains to verify the theorem in case is a successor say 1 as in the proof of the theorem 2 10 we may suppose that is a limit point of x in which case x xn n f where xn x n t let n r xn and let be minimal such that for some f 0 f sup n n f 0 let a n f 0 n if a f let a 0 a if a 6 f then we may assume a i e n for each n f 0 note that therefore is a limit ordinal let n n be increasing with supremum define f such that f n m iff m n m 1 by minimality of f is unbounded on every f f by there is a 0 f a 0 f 0 such that f a 0 is finite to one thus whether a f or not we have an a 0 f a 0 f 0 such that sup n n b for every infinite b a 0 let n 0 be the clopen neighborhood n f 0 xn of in x by homogeneity and lemma 2 9 n 0 zn n f where each zn is a topological sum of xm s m f 0 with m a 0 infinitely often thus r zn for all n by the induction hypothesis zn is homeomorphic to a topological sum of countably many copies of t hence by lemma 2 8 n 0 t 1 the proof is now completed as in theorem 2 10 we now show that the condition is necessary for t 1 to be 1 toronto theorem 2 12 suppose f is a filter on which fails to satisfy condition of thereom 2 11 then t 1 is not 1 toronto proof recall t 1 n t n f suppose t 1 is 1 toronto and let f be such that f f for every f f we will show that f a is finite to one for some a f to this end let x n tf n n f then x is homeomorphic to a subspace of t 1 and it follows from the fact that f f for every f f that r x 1 so there must exist a homeomorphism h t 1 x for k let bk n h k t n tf n 6 since r t we must have f bk thus we can choose nk bk such that f n 0 f n 1 now pick xk h k t nk tf nk note that cl h 1 xk k it follows that a nk k is in f since f is one to one on a that completes the proof theorem 2 13 if f satisfies the conditions of theorem 2 11 then t 1 and t 1 1 are 1 toronto and 1 1 toronto respectively albeit with uncountable levels however t 1 2 is not 1 2 toronto proof that t 1 is 1 toronto follows just like the limit case of the proof of the preceding theorem now consider a subspace x of t 1 1 of rank 1 1 and let xn x n t 1 then for f many n s r xn 1 and for such n xn t 1 now use lemmas 2 5 and 2 8 as in theorem 2 10 to complete the proof that x t 1 1 thus t 1 1 is 1 1 toronto 6 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore let y be the subspace of t 1 1 consisting of only its isolated points and the point note that every neighborhood of in y is uncountable it follows that t 1 2 has a subspace z of rank 1 2 with a point at level 1 every neighborhood of which is uncountable but every level 1 point of t 1 2 has a countable neighborhood thus z 6 t 1 2 and so t 1 2 is not 1 2 toronto 3 the zfc filter in this section we will define a homogeneous filter f on such that f is iso morphic to f it will be more convenient for our purposes to actually define the filter on the countable ordinal n n the filter f is the collection of all a such that the order type of a is less than note that the f positive subsets of are simply those which have order type theorem 3 1 f is homogeneous and isomorphic to f proof notice that if x is in f and x is an order isomorphism then is also an isomorphism between f x and f thus f is homogenous to see that f is isomorphic to f recall that the ordinal is the order type of the set equiped with the lexicographical order it is easy to see that n 1 n let be an order isomorphism between with the reverse lexicographical order and define f to be the preimage of f under it now suffices to show that f is equal to f it should be clear that f contains f if a is in f then define a 0 to be the union of all e a such that e 1 e where is the projection onto the first coordinate notice that a 0 is also in f since if the complement of a has order type then the complement of a 0 has order type at most since a 0 must be in f and since 1 a 0 a 0 a a 0 is in f and we are finished corollary 3 2 there are in zfc n toronto spaces for every n proof immediate from theorems 3 1 and 2 10 unfortunately this filter does not produce toronto spaces for by the orem 2 12 and proposition 3 3 let f be the filter of theorem 3 1 then f does not satisfy condition of theorem 2 11 proof define f by f k iff k k 1 if the restriction of f to a set a is finite to one clearly a has order type and hence is not in f in the next section we will show that at least there are consistent examples of filters satisfying all the conditions of theorem 2 11 4 the consistent filter the purpose of this section is to prove the following countable toronto spaces 7 theorem 4 1 if zfc is consistent then it is consistent with zfc that there is a filter f on satisfying i f is homogeneous ii f is isomorphic to the filter f on 2 iii whenever f is unbounded on every f f then there is some a f such that f a is finite to one the starting point for our construction is the following observation suppose fe fe 1 e 0 1 are subbases for filters on such that whenever h and k are disjoint finite subsets of 1 and hfe kfe is non empty then it is infinite and so is the corresponding set using f 1 e then there is a natural centered poset p forcing f 0 and f 1 to be isomorphic namely p consists of all pairs p p hp where p is a finite one to one function from to and hp 1 declare q p if q p hq hp and for each hp we have n f 0 q n f 1 whenever n dom q p this forcing adds a function t such that t f 0 f 1 for every 1 and it is easy to see that such a function t is an isomorphism call a pair of filters having subbases as above a good pair any pair of filters generated by 1 sized independent families is a good pair our naive idea to start with a filter f on generated by an independent family a a 1 consisting of 1 many cohen reals then force it to be isomorphic to the filter f on 2 which is generated by the independent family a a a and finally iterate the type of poset described in the previous paragraph 1 times we start with a model of ch to force f to be homogeneous note that for any infinite subset x of in the ground model the restriction of a to x is still an independent family the problem one runs into however is that this is not true for many subsets x added by the forcings for example if some infinite set x is added which is almost contained in every member of a then the restriction of f to x is the cofinite filter and then there is no hope of making f homogeneous so we must in particular show sets like this are not added in fact we show that for any subset x of added at some stage of the iteration if x f then there is some 1 such that the restriction of a to x is an independent family by lemma 4 2 below this turns out to be enough for f and its restriction to x to be a good pair of filters witnessed by the subbase na n a for f and its restriction to x for f x and so they can be forced to be isomorphic forcing notation follows kunen ku in particular fn x y denotes the set of all functions from a finite subset of x into y for a we let a 1 a and a 0 a lemma 4 2 let a a 1 be an independent family of subsets of and let f be the filter generated by a given fn 1 2 let l dom a suppose the following holds x x f 1 x l 6 for all fn 1 2 to express the property in words one might say it means that the restriction of a to any member of f is eventually independent 8 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore then for every x f there exists 1 and a finite to one such that n a n a l x 6 for all n and fn 1 2 proof let x f let m be a countable elementary submodel containing a x and a function y 7 y 1 witnessing the hypothesized property let m 1 construct a finite to one fuction such that for each n 1 n 6 x na as follows let 0 1 note that a m for each and y for each y m f hence we can inductively choose a finite subset 1 n of containing 1 i where i is least such that i 6 j n 1 j 2 k x na we claim that this and have the desired properties to see this fix n let zn na na x and let fn 1 2 we need to show zn l 6 choose 1 n x na let 0 since fn 1 x na we have 6 x na l x na a l x na na l zn l now we describe the posets that will be used in the iteration let f be the filter generated by an independent family a a 1 let x f let 1 and let be a finite to one function satisfying the conclusion of lemma 4 2 let q a x be the poset consisting of all p p f p np such that a p is a finite one to one function from to x b f p 1 c np define q p iff q p f q f p nq np and i n dom q p f p n a q n a ii n dom q p k np n k a q n k a lemma 4 3 the poset q q a x is centered and if g is a q generic filter then t p p g is a bijection from to x such that t a a x for all and t na x na for all n in particular t witnesses that in v g f is isomorphic to its restriction to x proof clearly any two conditions p and q for which p q are compatible and so the poset is centered let g be a q generic filter first we show that for each k the subset of q consisting of all p with k dom p is dense to this end suppose k 6 dom p let f p 2 be such that k a 1 let n n p be maximal such that k na by the property of the set na na l x infinite so we can choose a natural number k in this set which is not in ran p let q p k k f q f p and nq np then q p by a similar argument for each k x the set of all p with k ran p is dense it follows that t x is a bijection we now prove that t is an isomorphism between f and f x by showing that 1 t a x a for every and 2 t na x naa for each n countable toronto spaces 9 to see 1 fix there is p g with f p let k 6 dom p there is q g with q p and k q then k a q k a t k a similarly if k x ran p then k a t 1 k a it follows that t a dom p x a ran p now for 2 fix n there is p g with n np let k 6 dom p there is q g with q p and k q then k na q k naa t k naa the analogous statement is true for k x ran p it follows that t na dom p x naa ran p it follows that the bijections t and t 1 map elements of f to elements of its restriction to x and vice versa so t witnesses that these two filters are isomor phic now we define the poset q 1 a forcing f to be isomorphic to the filter f on 2 let p p f p be in q 1 a iff a p is a finite one to one function from to 2 b f p 1 define q p iff q p f q f p and n dom q p f p n a q n a lemma 4 4 the poset q 1 a is centered and if g is a q 1 a generic filter then t p p g is a bijection from to 2 such that t a a for all 1 in particular t witnesses that in v g f is isomorphic to f proof note that the collection a 1 which generates the filter on 2 is an independent family thus lemma 4 4 follows by a proof similar to and somewhat shorter than since the complication of the finite to one function is not involved here that of lemma 4 3 now we describe the iteration which is a finite support iteration p 1 of q 1 let the ground model v satisfy ch let q 0 fn 1 2 i e q 0 is the poset for adding 1 many cohen reals if g 0 is q 0 generic and 1 let a n g 0 n 1 then a a 1 is an independent family in v g 0 let q 1 be a q 0 name for the forcing q 1 a of lemma 4 4 each q for 1 will be a name for a forcing q a x as in lemma 4 3 forcing f and its restriction to x to be isomorphic since v ch and each poset in the iteration is ccc and has size 1 it follows that the final model satisfies ch and we can arrange the x s to include names for every x f in the final model thus in the end f will be homogeneous and thanks to q 1 will be isomorphic to f it turns out nothing more need be done to obtain the additional property iii of theorem 4 1 however a problem with the above simple outline is that given that x f in v p in order to continue the iteration we must show that there is forced to be some 1 and finite to one function such that q a x exists i e the conclusion of lemma 4 2 is satisfied so we must show that p forces the hypothesis of lemma 4 2 to establish notation let us describe the iteration more precisely we will often abuse notation by letting sets be names for themselves when this should cause no confusion but we will also use x to denote a name for x when we want to emphasize that we are talking about names 10 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore first note that w o l o g we can think of members of the iteration as having the form p p p 1 f p 1 p f p n p dp where i p fn 1 2 ii p 1 is a finite one to one function from to 2 and f p 1 1 iii dp 1 2 iv for each dp p is a finite one to one function from to f p 1 and np further there is a sequence x 1 1 of names such that v x f 1 is finite to one and x satisfy the conclusion of lemma 4 2 and for each dp vi p p q a x in particular this implies vii p ran p x and f p 1 as indicated above we can also assume that viii 1 x f 1 x x let us also make the following simple but useful observation if we change p by extending p and doing nothing else we get a stronger condintion it follows that p n a p n a n 1 p in order to show that an iteration as described above actually exists we need to show that in v p any x f satisfies the hypothesis of lemma 4 2 then if at stage we are given some x f we can conclude that there is a 1 and finite to one such that x and satisfy the conclusion of lemma 4 2 and thus continue the iteration as described first we show roughly speaking that in v p members of f are not contained in an orbit of finitely many of the previously added isomorphisms t x 1 and t 1 2 this will be needed later to show that we are free enough to extend conditions to force things we want to force let t be a collection of one to one functions from to or to 2 and let k we say that o t k is the orbit of k under t if i whenever t t t and n o t k then t n and t 1 n if defined are in o t k ii whenever t t t 2 and n o t k then 1 t n o t k and t 1 n j o t k for all j iii o t k is the smallest set containing k and satisfying conditions i and ii above note that n o t k iff there is a finite sequence n 0 n 1 nl of natural numbers such that n 0 k and nl n and a finite sequence t 0 t 1 tl of members of t such that for each i l either ni 1 ti ni ni ti 1 ni 1 ni 1 1 ti ni or ni 1 ti 1 ni 1 lemma 4 5 let t 1 2 be the bijection added by the first coordinate i e by q 1 of the forcing p and for 1 let t be that added by the th countable toronto spaces 11 coordinate let t be a finite subset of t 0 then for each k o t k 6 f proof suppose not then for some p p p o t k f we assume p has the form described above and we may also assume p t t e where e choose 1 such that no n is in dom p and p for each dp such exists by ccc let k be greater than k and any integer mentioned in p or the p s 1 d p let p be obtained from p by adding i 0 to p for each i k and adding to each f p 1 d p it is easy to check that p is a condition stronger than p since p o t k f there are q p and m k such that q m o t k a by extending q if necessary we may assume that there is a sequence n 0 n 1 nl of integers and a sequence 0 1 l e such that this sequence of integers and the sequence of members of t corresponding to the i s witness that m o t k i e n 0 k nl m etc see the discussion of o t k prior to the statement of this lemma we may also assume that q hence q decides whether or not ni a for all i l and if e g q t i ni ni 1 then q i ni ni 1 the following claim contradicts q m a proving the lemma claim for each i l q ni 6 a proof of claim since p k 0 n 0 k and q p we have q n 0 6 a suppose the claim is false and let i l be least such that q ni 1 a suppose e g that i 1 and 1 q 1 ni ni 1 all other cases which we omit are similar note that q ni 1 a and q p implies that ni 1 is not mentioned by p 1 and so not by p 1 either thus ni 6 dom p 1 but now q p and f p 1 imply q 1 ni a q 1 ni a ni 1 a but by our choice of i q ni 6 a and ni 1 a contradiction the following lemma shows that under certain circumstances and for certain values of and m we are free to extend two compatible conditions so that m is forced to be in a or not as we wish lemma 4 6 let 1 let q p and letm be a countable elementary submodel containing q and p let p p be compatible with q we don t require p m however let l be greater than any integer mentioned by p i e greater than any np d p or anything in the domain or range of p or of any p let t t d p 1 where t is the isomorphism added by the th coordinate of the forcing suppose the following hold i dq dp ii for each dp 1 q p and f q f p m iii for each dp nq n p iv for each dp q decides 1 i for each i n p i e there are finite sets k q i of ordinals i n p such that q 1 i k q i v q m k l o t k then whenever fn 1 m 2 there is a condition s p q such that s m for all dom proof since q and p are compatible by hypothesis we can choose r q p such that r decides whether or not n a whenever 1 n appears in the domain or range of some q for d p 1 12 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore and 2 f q 1 f q k q i d p i np let o o r dp 1 m note that o contains m and is finite it would have to be contained the union of m and the finite set of integers mentioned in the domain and range of the r s also o l since r m 6 k l o t k fix fn 1 m 2 we need to show that there is a condition s p q such that s m for all dom to this end first let fn 1 2 be such that 3 dom dom r dom o 4 n if dom and n o 5 n r n otherwise now let s q 1 f q 1 f p 1 q f q f p n q dq by 4 above s if it is a condition forces what we want it remains to prove that s is a condition extending both q and p note that q p since 6 r q p 7 r outside of dom o 8 dom dom q recall q m and dom 1 m and 9 o l so s can be thought of as q with q extended the f q s enlarged but the q s left the same also recall f q f p m for every d p 1 so f s f q 1 m this is needed to show s f s 1 it easily follows that s is a condition and s q it remains to prove that s p from i iii and the definition of s we have the necessary containments and s q so what we need to show is that s forces a n dom q p f p n a q n a b n dom q p k n p n k a q n k a for each dp and c n dom q 1 p 1 f p 1 n a q 1 n a proof of a let n dom q p f p where d p since q n r n by the definition of o we have n o q n o so if n is in dom o then so is q n and by 4 above s 1 forces n a 1 q n a on the other hand if n is not in dom o neither is q n and so and r agree on these two values since r p and n dom r p we must have r n a q n a so hence s forces this too proof of c this proof is virtually the same as for a putting 1 and putting 1 q 1 n in place of q n proof of b let n dom q p and k n by iv and since r s q r s k i k k q i countable toronto spaces 13 since q m and dom m we have dom i k k q i by the definition of r r decides the values of n and q n for any i k k q i and by definition s 1 decides these values the same way it follows that r n k a s n k a and r q n k a s q n k a now since r forces n k a q n k a since n dom r p and r p so does s and we are done the next lemma shows that the hypothesis of lemma 4 2 is satisfied with respect to the independent family a added by the first factor lemma 4 7 let 1 suppose x f then there exists 1 such that x l 6 for every fn 1 2 where l dom a proof if not then for each 1 there is p p and fn 1 2 such that p x l say p 1 f 1 f n d we may assume i the s form a delta system with root ii d such that d d for all iii for all d 1 there is such that for all and for all d there is n such that n n for all iv for all d 1 the f s form a system with root f let p 1 f 1 f n d let us write q p if containment holds on each coordinate i e q q 1 1 etc note that this does not necessarily imply that q p in the sense of the poset p let m be a countable elementary submodel containing p x p etc choose 1 m such that for each d 1 f f dom m let l be greater than any integer mentioned by p i e greater than any n d 1 or anything in the domain or range of or of any let t t d 1 where t is the isomorphism added by the th coordinate of the forcing since x f by lemma 4 5 there are r p and m such that r m x k l o t k consider a maximal antichain of conditions q p such that a q m x k l o t k b for each d 1 q decides 1 i for each i n i e there are finite sets k q i of ordinals i n such that q 1 i k q i 14 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore any such maximal antichain must contain a condition compatible with r by ccc and elementarity of m there is such a such a maximal antichain in m and hence we can choose a q p in m satisfying a and b which is compatible with r note that the conditions of lemma 4 6 are satisfied for this q with p p and so there is s p q with s m for all dom then s m x l this contradicts p x l which completes the proof at this point we can see that the iteration can be continued as claimed with q 1 forcing f to be isomorphic to its restriction to x since each x f in the final model is named by some x 1 f is homogeneous in v p 1 the forcing q 1 assures us that f is isomorphic to f it remains to prove that f also satisfies condition iii in theorem 4 1 let us note that any subset i of which appears by stage 1 1 and is in f in v p remains in f in v p 1 since for each finite h 1 the statement i h a 6 is absolute for transitive models of set theory therefore since any f in the final model appears in some initial stage it suffices to prove that condition iii holds at every stage 1 1 so suppose f and f f f f is unbounded let m be a countable elementary submodel containing p f let m 1 0 1 let tk t l l k 1 l let a by induction on k 1 we can define for each k conditions a m p and i j such that a a f i j and i l a l m o t m b i n i and j n j c da l l 1 l d for each da na and there is a 1 such that a e for each da for each i a decides the value of 1 i f for each da 1 dom a g f a 1 l l and for each d f a l l a l m 1 h a a l for each l j a n n is a maximal antichain below a note that a and b can be obtained because f is forced to be unbounded on every f f then c g can be obtained simply by extending as necessary so given that a has been defined there is a maximal antichain of conditions below a satisfying a g and by ccc there is one in m hence h and j can be obtained as well note that for any p generic g there is a unique h with ah n g for each n so there a corresponding set i ih n n in v g by a and b f g is strictly increasing on i let i be a p name for i it remains to prove that i f suppose not then there is some p p and finite subset h of 1 such that p i h a countable toronto spaces 15 note that there is some a compatible with p for of any prescribed length so we can choose a compatible with p so that k is greater than any integer mentioned in p l l l d p h m f p m d p then from l and a we have m a i h m a by c and l we have n da dp by k n f and compatibility we have o for each dp 1 a p by d g l and compatibility we have p for each dp 1 f a f p m and n a n p for each d p it follows from a e k n o and p that the conditions of lemma 4 6 are satisfied for this p with q a m i and l so there exists s a p with s i 1 for each h m then by m and s a we have s i i h a this contradicts s p and completes the proof of theorem 4 1 we wish to remark here that there is a theorem of w h woodin w which suggests that the continuum hypothesis implies that a filter with the properties given in theorem 4 1 exists in particular he has shown that if is a 21 sentence i e a sentence of the form f p q 1 x 1 qkxk f x 1 xk where qi is a quantifier over the reals and is a quantifier free formula then provided that certain large cardinals exist a supercompact is sufficient if can be forced to be true then it holds in any forcing extension satisfying the continuum hypothesis it is not difficult to show that the existence of a filter with the properties of theorem 4 1 is a statement of this form if the existence of such a filter were not a consequence of the continuum hypothesis then this would be of independent interest 5 concluding remarks the topology of our spaces t are determined by the filter f on and by the f construction for defining the neighborhoods of the point which we added to the countably many copies n t n of t in order to construct t 1 from t a different natural way of defining the topology of t 1 is to declare n to be a neighborhood of iff n and n contains a neighborhood of the point n of maximal rank in n t for f many n let t be the spaces obtained by defining them inductively this way i e just like the t s but using this finer neighborhood base for then t 2 is the same as t 2 i e it s homeomorphic to the space f with the set of isolated points and a neighborhood of f having the form f f f f but t 3 is different in particular the restriction of the neighborhood filter of to the isolated points is isomorphic to the filter f 2 on 2 defined by f 2 a 2 n m n m a f f a filter f is said to be idempotent if it is isomorphic to f 2 the following result shows that while the t construction does yield a 3 toronto space in zfc iff f is an ultrafilter t is never an toronto space if 4 16 gary gruenhage and j tatch moore theorem 5 1 let f be a filter on and let t an ordinal be the spaces defined as above then a t 3 is a 3 toronto space iff f is an ultrafilter b t is not an toronto space if 4 proof a we can consider t 3 as the set 1 where is the set of isolated points each n has a neighborhood base of sets of the form n f f f and a neighborhood of consists of together with neighborhoods of n for f many n suppose f is an ultrafilter and x t 3 has rank 3 then for f many n it must be the case that there are fn f such that n fn x now using the easily verified fact that any ultrafilter is homogeneous it is not difficult to prove that x t 3 suppose on the other hand that f is not an ultrafilter let a be such that a a f let x t 3 a then x has rank 3 but the subset a of x is a set of isolated points whose only limit point in x is while in t 3 any set of isolated points clustering at must also have cluster points of the form n so x is not homeomorphic to t 3 b let 4 and consider removing the level one points from a neighborhood of some level 2 point of t by the discussion preceding the theorem in the resulting subspace this level 2 point of t becomes a level one point with a neighborhood filter isomorphic to f 2 thus it must be the case that f is an idempotent filter frol ik showed in f that no ultrafilter is idempotent so f is not an ultrafilter note that any set of isolated points of t which has a limit point at level 2 must also have a limit point at level 1 but using an idea from the proof of part a we see that there is a subspace of t of rank which fails to have this property hence t is not toronto remark an idempotent filter on has been constructed in zfc by m kate tov ka and a homogeneous one also in zfc by j steprans unpublished note the latter result answers a question
