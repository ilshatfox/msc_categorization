de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding abstract de vries duality yields a dual equivalence between the category of compact hausdorff spaces and a category of complete boolean algebras with a proximity relation on them known as de vries algebras we extend de vries duality to completely regular spaces by replacing the category of de vries algebras with certain extensions of de vries algebras this is done by first formulating a duality between compactifications and de vries extensions and then specializing to the extensions that correspond to stone c ech compactifications 1 introduction as fundamental objects of study in topology completely regular spaces have a long and interesting history it is a celebrated result of tychonoff that a space is completely regular iff it is homeomorphic to a subspace of a compact hausdorff space and hence admits a compactification see e g 6 secs 3 2 and 3 5 a well known theorem of smirnov asserts that compactifications of a completely regular space x can be described internally by means of proximities on x compatible with the topology on x see e g 10 sec 7 proximities are binary relations on the powerset of x satisfying certain natural axioms including a point separation axiom see e g 10 sec 3 it was shown by de vries 4 that they can alternatively be described as binary relations on the regular open subsets of x satisfying the same axioms with the notable exception that the point separation axiom is replaced by the point free axiom asserting that the proximity relation is approximating on the one hand this yields an alternative proof of smirnov s theorem on the other hand it provides an algebraic description of the category khaus of compact hausdorff spaces by establishing that khaus is dually equivalent to the category of complete boolean algebras with a proximity relation on them known as de vries algebras our goal in this article is to extend de vries duality from the setting of compact hausdorff spaces to that of compactifications of completely regular spaces this we do by introducing a category comp whose objects are compactifications e x y where x is a completely regular space y is compact hausdorff and e is a dense embedding for compactifications e x y and e x y a morphism in this category is given by pairs f g

be isomorphic in comp but not equivalent in the classical sense interestingly however equivalence and isomorphism do coincide for the stone c ech compactfication see theorem 3 3 our interest in the category comp is that it allows more flexibility than the classical situation in that we can vary the base space x of a compactification rather than just its target y one of our main results theorem 5 9 is that just as the category khaus has via de vries duality as its algebraic counterpart the category dev of de vries algebras and de vries morphisms the category comp has as its algebraic counterpart a category whose objects are certain de vries morphisms in the category dev much of the work in this article involves axiomatizing these dual morphisms and showing that the proposed framework does indeed yield a dual equivalence of categories to formalize this idea we naturally rely on de vries duality but more is required given a compactification e x y since y is an object in khaus de vries duality produces a corresponding de vries algebra ro y where ro y is the complete boolean algebra of regular open subsets of y and is the canonical proximity on ro y see section 2 for details to deal in turn with x observe that even though x need not be in khaus we can still view the complete boolean algebra ro x as a de vries algebra by pulling back via e 1 the proximity on ro y to a proximity y on ro x thus a first candidate for an algebraic dual to e x y is the pullback map e 1 ro y ro x y however this idea is too coarse to be useful the pullback map is actually a boolean algebra isomorphism see lemma 4 1 which thus collapses information about x moreover the de vries dual of ro x y is y not x consequently a double application of de vries duality to the base space and its target falls short of what we want these obstacles suggest a different approach is needed our way of dealing with this is to continue to use de vries duality to deal with the targets y and y of the compactifications e x y and e x y but to work with tarski duality for complete and atomic boolean algebras when dealing with the base spaces x and x in other words the algebraic dual we propose for e x y is e 1 ro y x where x is the powerset of x an additional subtlety here is that e 1 need not be a homomorphism of boolean algebras but this causes no difficulty in our setting since it is a morphism in the category of de vries algebras to develop this idea into a functor we define a category deve consisting of what we call de vries extensions these are 1 1 de vries morphisms a b of de vries algebras a and b such that a is join meet dense in b and b is a complete and atomic boolean algebra whose proximity is given by the partial order on b see section 4 with morphisms de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 3 of de vries extensions defined in an obvious way we obtain the category deve and we prove in theorem 5 9 that khaus is dually equivalent to deve implicit in this dual equivalence is an algebraic axiomatization of the de vries morphisms that arise as e 1 ro y x for some compactification e x y focusing next on completely regular spaces rather than their compactifications we also obtain a duality for these spaces and in so doing extend de vries duality and tarksi duality from the category khaus and the category of discrete spaces respectively to the category of completely regular spaces this is done by first observing that the category of completely regular spaces can be identified as a full subcategory of the category of compactifications by considering stone c ech compactifications we prove that dually these correspond to maximal de vries extensions thus yielding a duality for completely regular spaces that generalizes de vries duality and tarski duality see remark 5 10 the article is organized as follows in section 2 we recall de vries algebras and de vries duality in section 3 we recall some classical facts about compactifications and introduce the category comp of compactifications in section 4 after recalling tarski duality we introduce de vries extensions and the category deve of de vries extensions in section 5 we prove that comp and deve are dually equivalent thus generalizing de vries and tarski dualities finally in section 6 we define maximal de vries extensions and prove that under the duality result of section 5 they correspond to stone c ech compactifications from this we derive that the category creg of completely regular spaces is dually equivalent to the full subcategory mdeve of deve consisting of maximal de vries extensions in the followup paper 3 we illustrate the utility of our point of view by showing how to obtain algebraic counterparts of normal and locally compact hausdorff spaces in the form of de vries extensions that are subject to additional axioms which encode the desired topological property as a further application we show that a duality for locally compact hausdorff spaces due to dimov 5 can be obtained from our perspective 2 de vries duality let khaus be the category of compact hausdorff spaces and continuous maps in 4 de vries described a category dual to khaus the objects of this category are now known as de vries algebras and its morphisms as de vries morphisms in this section we briefly review de vries duality and refer the interested reader to 4 ch i for more details definition 2 1 1 a binary relation on a boolean algebra a is a de vries proximity provided it satisfies the following axioms dv 1 1 1 dv 2 a b implies a b dv 3 a b c d implies a d dv 4 a b c implies a b c 4 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding dv 5 a b implies b a dv 6 a b implies there is c such that a c b dv 7 b 0 implies there is a 0 such that a b 2 a de vries algebra is a pair a a where a is a complete boolean algebra and is a de vries proximity on a remark 2 2 it follows from the definition that 0 0 and a b c implies a b c in addition the axiom dv 7 can equivalently be stated as b a a a b and asserts that the proximity is approximating definition 2 3 a map a b between de vries algebras is a de vries morphism provided m 1 0 0 m 2 a b a b m 3 a b implies a b m 4 b a a b remark 2 4 each de vries morphism satisfies 1 1 1 2 a a 3 a a 4 a b implies a b thus is a bounded meet semilattice homomorphism that preserves however does not preserve join or negation in general axiom m 3 is equivalent to the following axiom a 1 b 1 and a 2 b 2 imply a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 2 lem 2 2 function composition of two de vries morphisms need not be a de vries morphism because it need not satisfy m 4 to repair this the composition of two de vries morphisms 1 a 1 a 2 and 2 a 2 a 3 is defined by 2 1 b 2 1 a a b with this composition de vries algebras and de vries morphisms form a category definition 2 5 let dev be the category of de vries algebras and de vries morphisms where composition is defined as above remark 2 6 1 as pointed out in remark 2 4 a de vries morphism is not a boolean homomorphism in general nevertheless isomorphisms in dev are boolean isomorphisms which preserve and reflect proximity 2 while composition in dev is not function composition in general if 1 a 1 a 2 and 2 a 2 a 3 are de vries morphisms such that 2 is a complete boolean homomor phism then it follows from the definition of that 2 1 2 1 we will use this throughout the paper de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 5 by de vries duality khaus is dually equivalent to dev we briefly describe the functors that yield this dual equivalence for x khaus let x ro x where ro x is the complete boolean algebra of regular open subsets of x and is the canonical proximity on ro x the boolean operations on ro x are given by iui int cl iui iui int iui u int x u and the canonical proximity is given by u v iff cl u v then x dev if f x y is a continuous map then f y x is given by f u int cl f 1 u we have that f is a de vries morphism this yields a contravariant functor khaus dev to define a contravariant functor dev khaus let a dev for s a let s a a b a for some b s we call a filter f of a round if f f an end is a maximal proper round filter let ya be the set of ends of a for a a let a a x ya a x define a topology on ya by letting a a a a a a be a basis for the topology the space ya is compact hausdorff and a a ro ya is a de vries isomorphism if a a is a de vries morphism we define ya ya by y 1 y then is continuous this yields a contravariant functor dev khaus as we already pointed out a a a is a de vries isomorphism moreover x x x is a homeomorphism where x u x x u therefore 1 dev and 1 khaus are natural isomorphisms thus we arrive at de vries duality theorem 2 7 de vries duality the functors and give a dual equivalence between khaus and dev 3 compactifications our goal is to extend de vries duality from compact hausdorff spaces to completely regular spaces this we do by utilizing the theory of compactifications of completely regular spaces see e g 6 ch 3 5 we recall that a compactification of a completely regular space x is a pair y e where y is a compact hausdorff space and e x y is an embedding such that the image e x is dense in y 6 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding suppose that e x y and e x y are compactifications as usual we write e e provided there is a continuous map f y y with f e e x e e y f y the relation is reflexive and transitive two compactifications e and e are equivalent if e e and e e it is well known that e and e are equivalent iff there is a homeomorphism f y y with f e e the equivalence classes of compactifications of x form a poset whose largest element is the stone c ech compactification s x x in the classical setting one considers compactifications of a fixed base space x for our purposes we need to vary the base space the proof of the following proposition is straightforward proposition 3 1 there is a category comp whose objects are compactifications e x y and whose morphisms are pairs f g of continuous maps such that the following diagram commutes x e f y g x e y the composition of two morphisms f 1 g 1 and f 2 g 2 is defined to be f 2 f 1 g 2 g 1 x 1 e 1 f 2 f 1 f 1 y 1 g 1 g 2 g 1 x 2 e 2 f 2 y 2 g 2 x 3 e 3 y 3 it is straightforward to see that a morphism f g in comp is an isomorphism iff both f and g are homeomorphisms from this it follows that equivalent compactifications of x are isomorphic in comp the converse is not true in general as the following example shows example 3 2 let x be the set n of natural numbers equipped with the discrete topology and let e x y be the two point compactification of x where y is the disjoint union of the one point compactifications of 2 n and 2 n 1 and e is the inclusion map thus y n e o where cly 2 n 2 n e and cly 2 n 1 2 n 1 o define f x x as follows let f be the identity on 4 n and 4 n 1 and for n 0 set f 4 n 2 4 n 3 and f 4 n 3 4 n 2 see the diagram de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 then f is a homeomorphism with f 2 n 4 n 4 n 3 and f 2 n 1 4 n 1 4 n 2 let e x y be the two point compactification of x where y is the disjoint union of the one point compactifications of f 2 n and f 2 n 1 and e x y is the inclusion map then y n 1 2 where 1 is a limit point of f 2 n and 2 is a limit point of f 2 n 1 define g y y by g n f n for each n n g e 1 and g o 2 a straightforward argument shows that g is a homeomorphism and the following diagram is commutative x e f y g x e y therefore f g is an isomorphism in comp on the other hand we show that e and e are not equivalent suppose that there is a homeomorphism h y y with h e e x e e y h y let a 4 n 4 n 3 f 2 n then cly a a e o because e is a limit point of 4 n and o is a limit point of 4 n 3 since h is a homeomorphism extending the identity on x we have h cly a cly a however a f 2 n so cly a a 1 while h cly a a 1 2 this contradiction shows that there is no homeomorphism h with h e e and hence e and e are not equivalent on the other hand if a compactification is equivalent to the stone c ech compactification then the two compactifications are isomorphic in comp theorem 3 3 let e x y be a compactification if e is isomorphic to s x x in comp then e is equivalent to s proof by hypothesis there is an isomorphism f g in comp yielding the following commu tative diagram x e f y g x s x 8 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding this means that both f and g are homeomorphisms by the universal mapping property for see e g 6 thm 3 6 1 there is f x x with f s s f x s f x f x s x note that f is a homeomorphism since is a functor see e g 8 sec iv 2 1 and f is a homeomorphism let h g 1 f x y then h x y is a homeomorphism x s e x h y moreover h s g 1 f s g 1 s f g 1 g e e thus e x y is equivalent to s x x 4 de vries extensions in this section we introduce the concept of a de vries extension which is the main concept of this article to motivate the definition let e x y be a compactification of a completely regular space x since y is compact hausdorff by de vries duality we can associate with y the de vries algebra ro y although x is not necessarily compact it would be natural to work with the complete boolean algebra ro x of regular open subsets of x however as the next lemma shows ro x is isomorphic to ro y lemma 4 1 let e x y be a compactification then e 1 ro y ro x is a boolean isomorphism proof to simplify notation we view x as a dense subspace of y then the map e 1 sends v to v x since x is dense in y if v is open in y then we have cly v x cly v claim 4 2 if u is regular open in x then u inty cly u x proof of the claim set v inty cly u since u is open in x we may write u w x for some open set w in y as x is dense in y we have cly u cly w therefore w inty cly u v this yields u v x on the other hand clx u cly u x v x thus v x intx clx u u consequently v x u and so the claim is verified we next show that if v ro y then v x ro x for let u intx clx v x then u ro x and v x u we have u intx clx v x clx v x cly v de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 9 therefore cly u cly v thus w inty cly u inty cly v v now w x u by claim 4 2 therefore v x u w x v x and so u v x yielding that v x ro x thus e 1 ro y ro x is well defined and it is onto by claim 4 2 to see e 1 is 1 1 let v be regular open in y then v inty cly v inty cly v x therefore if v w ro y with v x w x then this formula shows v w thus e 1 is a bijection it clearly preserves order and this formula shows that it also reflects order consequently e 1 is an order isomorphism hence a boolean isomorphism instead of working with ro x we will work with the powerset x of x and will utilize tarski duality between the category caba of complete and atomic boolean algebras with complete boolean homomorphisms and the category set of sets and functions if x is a set then x is a complete and atomic boolean algebra and if f x y is a function then f 1 y x is a complete boolean homomorphism this yields a contravariant functor set caba going backwards for a complete and atomic boolean algebra b let xb be the set of atoms of b and for a complete boolean homomorphism b 1 b 2 let xb 2 xb 1 be given by x b b 1 x b it is well known that is a well defined function yielding a contravariant functor caba set for each set x we have a natural isomorphism x x x x given by x x x for each x x and for each b caba we have a natural isomorphism b b xb given by b b x xb x b theorem 4 3 tarski duality the functors described above give a dual equivalence between set and caba for each complete boolean algebra a the pair a a is a de vries algebra of a special kind such de vries algebras are called extremally disconnected in 1 since they correspond to extremally disconnected compact hausdorff spaces therefore the pair x is an extremally disconnected de vries algebra which in addition is an atomic boolean algebra thus each compactification e x y gives rise to the de vries algebra ro y the atomic extremally disconnected de vries algebra x and the map e 1 ro y x notation 4 4 let e x y be a compactification in the remainder of this paper we write ro y for the de vries algebra ro y and x for the atomic extremally disconnected de vries algebra x theorem 4 5 let e x y be a compactification then e 1 ro y x is a 1 1 de vries morphism such that each element of x is a join of meets from e 1 ro y proof we first show that e 1 is a de vries morphism obviously e 1 so m 1 holds since binary meet in ro y is intersection it is clear that m 2 holds suppose u v ro y with u v then cly u v so y v y cly u inty y u therefore e 1 y v e 1 inty y u and so x e 1 inty y u x e 1 y v e 1 v thus m 3 10 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding holds if u ro y then since y is compact hausdorff u v ro y cly v u so e 1 u e 1 v v u consequently m 4 holds and hence e 1 is a de vries morphism by lemma 4 1 e 1 is 1 1 finally the atoms of x are the singletons because x is regular if x x then x is the intersection of all regular open subsets of x containing x by lemma 4 1 they are of the form e 1 u with u ro y since each element in x is a union of singletons x is a join of meets from e 1 ro y theorem 4 5 motivates definition 4 8 below in order to formulate it succinctly we require the following definition definition 4 6 let a b be a de vries morphism 1 we say a is join meet dense in b if each element of b is a join of meets from a 2 we say a is meet join dense in b if each element of b is a meet of joins from a remark 4 7 let a b be a de vries morphism with b an atomic extremally discon nected de vries algebra 1 a is join meet dense in b iff each atom of b is a meet from b 2 a is meet join dense in b iff each coatom of b is a join from b 3 a is join meet dense in b iff a is meet join dense in b to see the left to right implication suppose that a is join meet dense in b let x b be a coatom then x is an atom so x c c a x c by 1 this yields x c c a x c let c a with x c since is a de vries morphism c a a c because x is an atom there is a c with x a we have a a c so c a also since x a we see that a a x thus x a x a and so x is a join from a applying 2 then gives that a is meet join dense in b the right to left implication follows from a similar argument we are ready for the main definition of this article definition 4 8 let a be a de vries algebra and b b an atomic extremally discon nected de vries algebra a de vries extension is a 1 1 de vries morphism a b such that a is join meet dense in b proposition 4 9 there is a category deve whose objects are de vries extensions and whose morphisms are pairs where is a de vries morphism is a complete boolean homo morphism and a b a b de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 11 the composition of two morphisms 1 1 and 2 2 is defined to be 2 1 2 1 a 1 2 1 1 1 b 1 1 2 1 a 2 2 2 b 2 2 a 3 3 b 3 proof since both and are associative operations it follows that composition in deve is a well defined associative operation and so it is straightforward to see that deve is a category remark 4 10 let be a morphism in deve between de vries extensions a b and a b by remark 2 6 2 thus the equation says that the first diagram in the statement of proposition 4 9 is a commutative diagram in dev the complete boolean homomorphism is an instance of a special type of de vries morphism studied by fedorchuk see 7 or 1 sec 3 5 dual equivalence of comp and deve this section is dedicated to proving that comp and deve are dually equivalent we begin by defining a functor e comp deve as follows if e x y is an object in comp we define its image under e as the de vries extension e 1 ro y x for a morphism f g in comp x e f y g x e y we define e f g as the pair g f 1 ro y g e 1 x f 1 ro y e 1 x proposition 5 1 e comp deve is a contravariant functor proof by theorem 4 5 for each object e x y in comp we have e e is an object in deve let f g be a morphism in comp by de vries duality g is a de vries morphism 12 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding and it is clear that f 1 is a complete boolean homomorphism to see that the diagram ro y g e 1 x f 1 ro y e 1 x commutes let u ro y since f 1 is a complete boolean homomorphism f 1 e 1 f 1 e 1 see remark 4 10 as e f g e we have f 1 e 1 u f 1 e 1 u e f 1 u g e 1 u e 1 g 1 u on the other hand e 1 g u e 1 g v v u from v u it follows that cl v u so int e 1 g 1 cl v e 1 g 1 u because e and g are continuous e 1 g v e 1 int cl g 1 v is contained in int e 1 g 1 cl v thus e 1 g v e 1 g 1 u so e 1 g u e 1 g 1 u conversely x e 1 g 1 u implies ge x u so there is v u with ge x v therefore x e 1 g 1 v e 1 int cl g 1 v e 1 g v and so e 1 g 1 u e 1 g u this shows that e 1 g 1 u e 1 g u and so f 1 e 1 u e 1 g u thus the diagram commutes and hence e f g is a morphism in deve it is elementary to see that e sends identity morphisms to identity morphisms given the composable morphisms in comp in the following diagram x 1 e 1 f f 1 y 1 g 1 g x 2 e 2 f 2 y 2 g 2 x 3 e 3 y 3 where f f 2 f 1 and g g 2 g 1 we obtain the diagram ro y 3 g g 2 e 3 1 x 3 f 12 f 1 ro y 2 g 1 e 2 1 x 2 f 11 ro y 1 e 11 x 1 since f f 2 f 1 we have f 1 f 11 f 12 also by de vries duality g g 1 g 2 therefore the diagram commutes and so e f 2 g 2 f 1 g 1 e f 1 g 1 e f 2 g 2 thus e is a contravariant functor de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 13 we next wish to define a functor c deve comp which requires some preparation if b is an extremally disconnected de vries algebra then the proximity is so ends of b are simply ultrafilters of b and hence yb is the stone space of b definition 5 2 for an atomic extremally disconnected de vries algebra b let xb be the set of atoms of b we identify an atom b with the principal ultrafilter b of b and view xb as a subset of yb lemma 5 3 suppose a b is a de vries morphism with b an atomic extremally disconnected de vries algebra for each a a and each atom b b the following are equivalent 1 b a 2 a b 3 b 1 a proof 1 2 suppose that b a since is a de vries morphism a x x a so b x x a as b is an atom there is x with x a and b x thus a b 2 3 if a b then b a so b 1 a 3 1 if b 1 a then a b 1 b so there is x with x a and b x therefore b x a lemma 5 4 let a and b be de vries algebras with b atomic and extremally disconnected and let a b be a 1 1 de vries morphism then is a de vries extension iff the restriction of yb ya to xb is 1 1 proof suppose that is a de vries extension let b c be atoms of b by remark 4 7 1 each of b and c are meets from a therefore there is a a with b a and c a by lemma 5 3 a b and a c thus is 1 1 on xb conversely suppose that is 1 1 on xb let b be an atom of b and let d a b a then b d if b d there is an atom c b with c d therefore c a for each a with b a which implies that b c by lemma 5 3 since b and c are ends we get b c and so b c since is 1 1 this is a contradiction thus d b and so b is a meet from a thus a is join meet dense in b by remark 4 7 1 and hence is a de vries extension definition 5 5 for a de vries extension a b define a topology on xb as the least topology making xb ya continuous remark 5 6 following usual terminology we will refer to the topological space xb as xb when there is no danger of confusion about which topology we are using theorem 5 7 if a b is a de vries extension then xb is completely regular and xb ya is a compactification 14 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding proof by lemma 5 4 xb ya is 1 1 therefore xb is homeomorphic to xb by definition 5 5 and so xb is completely regular since is 1 1 yb ya is onto and xb is dense in yb because b is atomic thus xb is dense in ya and hence xb ya is a compactification we are ready to define the functor c deve comp if a b is an object in deve we define its image under c to be the compactification xb ya for a morphism in deve a b a b we define c as the pair where is the tarski dual of and is the de vries dual of xb ya xb ya if is the de vries dual of then it is straightforward to see that b b for each atom b of b this together with and de vries duality yield that so c is a morphism in comp proposition 5 8 c deve comp is a contravariant functor proof by theorem 5 7 if a b is an object in deve then c is an object in comp and a morphism in deve yields a morphism in comp by the discussion above from the description of how c acts on morphisms it is clear that c sends identity morphisms to identity morphisms given a pair 1 1 2 2 of composable morphisms a 1 1 1 2 1 b 1 1 2 1 a 2 2 2 b 2 2 a 3 3 b 3 de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 15 c yields the following diagram xb 3 3 2 1 2 ya 3 2 1 2 ww xb 2 2 1 ya 2 1 xb 1 1 ya 1 by de vries duality 1 2 2 1 and 2 1 1 2 by tarski duality therefore c 2 2 1 1 c 1 1 c 2 2 thus c is a contravariant functor theorem 5 9 the functors e and c yield a dual equivalence between comp and deve proof propositions 5 1 and 5 8 show that e and c are contravariant functors we first show that ce is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on comp the functor e sends e x y to e 1 ro y x then c sends this de vries extension to e 1 x x yro y we have the following diagram x e x y y x x e 1 yro y the map y is a homeomorphism by de vries duality and x is a bijection by tarski duality the map e 1 sends x to u ro y e x u so the diagram is easily seen to be commutative therefore x is also a homeomorphism by the definition of the topology on x x let f g be a morphism in comp x e f y g x e y then e f g g f 1 and so ce f g c g f 1 f 1 g thus we have another morphism in comp x x e 1 f 1 yro y g x x e 1 yro y 16 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding we define a natural transformation p from the identity functor to ce as follows for a compactification e x y we set pe x y since x and y are homeomorphisms pe is an isomorphism in comp we have the following diagram x x e 1 f 1 yro y g x x 66 f e y g y 66 x x e 1 yro y x e x 66 y y 66 the front and back faces of this cube are commutative since f g and ce f g are mor phisms in comp the top and bottom faces are commutative since pe and pe are morphisms in comp the left face is commutative by tarski duality and the right face is commutative by de vries duality thus p is a natural isomorphism we next show that ec is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on deve given a de vries extension a b the functor c sends it to xb ya this is then sent by e to 1 ro ya xb we have the following diagram a a b b ro ya 1 xb the map a is a de vries isomorphism by de vries duality and b is an isomorphism by tarski duality to see that the diagram commutes b b b a a b b a a b on the other hand 1 a b 1 a a a b we have b a x xb x a by lemma 5 3 this is equal to 1 a a thus the diagram commutes and so a b is a morphism in deve we define a natural transformation q from the identity functor to ec as follows for a de vries extension a b we set q a b a morphism in deve since a and b are isomorphisms q is an isomorphism in deve de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 17 to show naturality let be a morphism in deve a b a b we have the following diagram ro ya 1 xb 1 a a 66 b b 66 ro ya 1 xb a a 66 b b 66 the front and back faces of this cube are commutative because and ec are morphisms in deve the top and bottom faces are commutative because q and q are morphisms in deve the left face is commutative by de vries duality and the right face is commutative by tarski duality therefore q is a natural isomorphism thus e and c yield a dual equivalence between comp and deve the use of both de vries and tarski dualities was critical in the proof of theorem 5 9 in the next remark we indicate how these two dualities can be viewed as special cases of our duality remark 5 10 1 if x khaus then the identity x x is the only compactification of x the corresponding de vries extension isro x x in 3 sec 5 we will characterize such extensions and we will show that dev is equivalent to a full subcategory of deve it is also straightforward that khaus is equivalent to a full subcategory of comp this leads to the following commutative diagram where the functors khaus dev are those of de vries duality and those between comp and deve are e and c khaus oo dev comp oo deve consequently the duality of theorem 5 9 is an extension of de vries duality 18 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding 2 there is a full and faithful functor set comp which sends x to the stone c ech compactification s x x where x is viewed as a discrete space since x is extremally disconnected ro x is isomorphic to the boolean algebra of clopen subsets of x which in turn is isomorphic to x therefore the de vries extension s 1 ro x x is an isomorphism of boolean algebras there is also a full and faithful functor caba deve which sends b to the identity map b b thus set is equivalent to a full subcategory of comp caba is equivalent to a full subcategory of deve and the following diagram is commutative where the functors set caba are those of tarski duality set oo caba comp oo deve consequently the duality of theorem 5 9 is an extension of tarski duality 6 maximal de vries extensions and stone c ech compactifications in this final section we introduce maximal de vries extensions and prove that they cor respond to stone c ech compactifications from this we derive that the category creg of completely regular spaces and continuous maps is dually equivalent to the full subcategory mdeve of deve consisting of maximal extensions let x e e y f y be a commutative diagram of compactifications of x the functor e sends this diagram to the commutative diagram ro y f e 1 x ro y e 1 99 by lemma 4 1 e 1 ro y ro x e 1 ro y this motivates the following definition definition 6 1 we call two de vries extensions a b and c b compatible if a c lemma 6 2 two de vries extensions a b and c b are compatible iff the topologies and on xb given in definition 5 5 are equal de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 19 proof first suppose that a b and c b are compatible so a c by definition is the least topology making xb ya continuous and is the least topology making xb yc continuous since a is a basis for the topology on ya we have that 1 a is a basis for and similarly 1 c is a basis for therefore it is sufficient to show that 1 a 1 c but this follows from a c by lemma 5 3 for the converse suppose that by lemma 4 1 1 ro ya ro xb and 1 ro yc ro xb are boolean isomorphisms by de vries duality a ro ya and c ro yc therefore since we have 1 a 1 c by lemma 5 3 a c so a b and c b are compatible definition 6 3 1 we say that a de vries extension a b is maximal provided for every compatible de vries extension c b there is a de vries morphism c a such that a b c 2 let mdeve be the full subcategory of deve consisting of maximal de vries extensions theorem 6 4 let e x y be a compactification and let s x x be the stone c ech compactification of x then the following conditions are equivalent 1 the de vries extension e 1 ro y x is maximal 2 e is isomorphic to s in comp 3 e is equivalent to s proof 1 2 first suppose that e 1 ro y x is a maximal de vries extension by theorem 4 5 the stone c ech compactification s x x yields a de vries extension s 1 ro x x by lemma 4 1 e 1 ro y ro x s 1 ro x therefore e 1 and s 1 are compatible so by maximality of e 1 there is a de vries morphism ro x ro y such that e 1 s 1 ro y e 1 x ro x ff s 1 99 20 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding since the stone c ech compactification is the largest compactification we also have a con tinuous map f x y such that f s e x s e x f y this induces a commutative diagram in dev ro x s 1 x ro y f ff e 1 from this it follows that f are inverses of each other in dev therefore f ro y ro x is an isomorphism thus by de vries duality f x y is a homeomorphism and hence idx f is an isomorphism from e x y to s x x 2 3 this follows from theorem 3 3 3 1 suppose that e x y is equivalent to s x x then there is a home omorphism f x y such that f s e but then f ro y ro x is an isomorphism such that s 1 f e 1 let c x be a de vries extension compati ble with e 1 ro y x then is compatible with s 1 ro x x so by lemma 6 2 the topology on x is and hence x yc is a compactification therefore there is a continuous g x yc such that g s x s x g yc this yields a commutative diagram in dev ro x s 1 x c g c dd since f ro y ro x is an isomorphism such that s 1 f e 1 this in turn induces a commutative diagram in dev ro y e 1 x c f 1 g c cc de vries duality for compactifications and completely regular spaces 21 thus e 1 ro y x is a maximal de vries extension remark 6 5 due to theorem 5 9 we can equivalently formulate theorem 6 4 in terms of de vries extensions as follows let a b be a de vries extension then the following are equivalent 1 is maximal 2 xb ya is isomorphic in comp to the stone c ech compactification s xb xb 3 is equivalent to the stone c ech compactification s theorem 6 4 motivates the following definition definition 6 6 let scomp be the full subcategory of comp consisting of stone c ech com patifications theorem 5 9 and remark 6 5 immediately yield the following theorem 6 7 there is a dual equivalence between mdeve and scomp proposition 6 8 there is an equivalence between creg and scomp proof define b creg scomp by sending a completely regular space x to the stone c ech compactification sx x x and a continuous map f x y to f f x sx f x f y sy y the universal mapping property of shows that this diagram is commutative so f f is a morphism in comp if f x y and g y z are morphisms in creg then since creg khaus is a functor b g f g f g f g f g f g g f f b g b f which shows that b preserves composition because it is clear that b sends identity maps to identity maps b is a functor it is obvious that b is faithful to see that b is full let f g be a morphism between stone c ech compactifications x sx f x g y sy y then g is a continuous map satisfying g sx sy f since f satisfies f sx sy f we have that g and f agree on the dense subspace sx x of x and so g f therefore f g b f showing that b is full thus creg is equivalent to scomp 9 thm iv 4 1 22 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding we are ready to generalize de vries duality to the category creg of completely regular spaces and continuous maps theorem 6 9 there is a dual equivalence between creg and mdeve proof this follows from theorem 6 7 and proposition 6 8 in the sequel 3 we will show how to use theorems 5 9 and 6 9 to characterize such topological properties as normality and local compactness in terms of de vries extensions that are subject to additional axioms references 1 g
