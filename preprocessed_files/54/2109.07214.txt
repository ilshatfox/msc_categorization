ar x iv 2 10 9 07 21 4 v 2 m at h g n 2 5 n ov 2 02 1 on homogeneity of cantor cubes e shchepin and v valov abstract we discuss the question of extending homeomorphism between closed subsets of the cantor cube d it is established that any homeomorphism between two closed negligible subset of d can be extended to an autohomeomorphism of d 1 introduction knaster reichbach 4 established the following theorem see also 9 for other types of zero dimensional separable metric spaces let x and y be compact perfect zero dimensional metric spaces and let p and k be closed nowhere dense subsets of x and y respectively if f is a homeomorphism between p and k then there exists a homeomorphism between x and y extending f if we omit the metrizability condition in the knaster reichbach s theorem then the conclusion is not anymore true in order to obtain a correct generalization of the theorem first of all it is necessary to find the correct analogue of the condition nowhere dense moreover the perfectness condition can be formulated as the nowhere density of the points such an analogue is the following concept of negligibility a sub set of a topological space is called negligible if it does not contain a non empty intersection of a family of open sets such that the cardinal ity of the family is less than the weight of the space note that for metric compacta the condition of nowhere density is equivalent to the condition of negligibility now we able to present a generalization of the knaster reichbach s theorem theorem 1 1 let x and y be compact zero dimensional absolute extensors for 0 dimensional spaces of the same weight with negligible 2020 mathematics subject classification primary 54 c 20 54 f 45 secondary 54 b 10 54 d 30 key words and phrases candor

points and let p and k be closed negligible subsets of x and y respec tively if f is a homeomorphism between p and k then there exists a homeomorphism between x and y extending f this theorem for metric compacta turns into knaster reichbach s theorem because every metric compact is an absolute extensor in di mension 0 in general it is very difficult to avoid the condition of being an absolute extensor in dimension 0 because before you can continue homeomorphisms you need to be able to continue at least continuous maps since the condition of the negligibility of a point in a compactum is equivalent to having a character at that point equal to the weight of the compactum then theorem 1 from 10 allows us to assert that the compacta x and y in theorem 1 1 are homeomorphic to the cantor cube d where is the weight of x and y therefore the above theorem can be obtained from the following special case of its own theorem 1 2 let f be a homeomorphism between closed negligible subsets p and k of d then f can be extended to a homeomorphism on d since every subset of the weight less than the weight of the entire space is negligible the following consequence follows from the formu lated theorem corollary 1 3 if p k are closed subsets of d both of weight then every homeomorphism between p and k can be extended to home omorphism on d actually we prove a more general version of theorem 1 2 see the orem 4 1 below 2 some preliminary results anywhere below by a homeomorphism we always mean a surjective homeomorphism we need a more precise notion of negligibility for a space x a subset p x and an infinite cardinal we denote by p the interior of p in x i e the set all x p such that there exists a g subset k of x with x k p if is finite then p is the ordinary interior of p and it is denoted by p 0 if there exists 0 with p is empty for all we say that p is negligible in x let x a x be a product of spaces and b a if p x then pb denotes b p where b x b x is the projection on homogeneity of cantor cubes 3 proposition 2 1 let x a x be a product of compact metric spaces p and k be closed subsets of x and f p k be a homeo morphism then for any countable set c a there is a countable set b a and a homeomorphism fb pb kb such that c b and b f fb b proof obviously this is true for a countable set a so we suppose a is uncountable let g k p be the inverse of f using that any continuous function on x depends on countably many coordinates 8 we construct by induction a sequence of countable sets b n a and maps fn pb n 1 kb n and gn kb n 1 pb n such that b 1 c and b n b n 1 b n f fn b n 1 b n g gn b n 1 then b n 1 b n is countable and there exist maps fb pb kb and gb kb pb with b f fb b and b g gb b then fb is a homeomorphism between pb and kb in the situation of proposition 2 1 a subset b a is called f admissible if there exists a homeomorphism fb pb kb with b f fb b it easily seen that arbitrary union of f admissible sets is also f admissible in 6 negligible sets were considered under the name g sets by 6 lemma 6 if x is a product of metric compacta then f is negligible in x if and only if the character f x of f in x is recall that f x is the smallest cardinality such that there is an open family u in x of cardinality with the following property every neighborhood of f in x contains an element of u next lemma is a modification of 6 theorem 2 lemma 2 2 let x a x be a product of compact metric spaces and p be a closed set in x suppose c a is a set of cardinality such that z xa c p is negligible in z xa c for every z pc then pa c 6 xa c proof indeed otherwise we may assume that the projection a c re stricted on p is an irreducible map onto xa c and denote this map by f consequently f z xa c p xa c z xa c p p for every z pc on the other hand z xa c p p z pc so f z xa c p xa c that accord ing to 6 lemma 6 contradicts the fact that f z xa c p is negligible in xa c 4 e shchepin and v valov corollary 2 3 let x a x be a product of compact metric spaces and p be a closed negligible set in x if c a is a set of cardinality then there is a set b a containing c such that b c is countable and b c p is nowhere dense in xb c if in addition f p k is a homeomorphism with k x and c is f admissible then we can assume that b is also f admissible proof since p is a negligible set in x so are the sets p z z xa c p for all z pc this implies that each a c p z is negligible in xa c indeed otherwise a c p z would con tain a closed g set in xa c for some z pc and because z xa c is g set in x where is the cardinality of c p z contains a g subset of x with max a contradiction therefore we can apply lemma 2 2 countably many times to construct by induction a disjoint sequence cn of finite subsets of a c such that c 1 a c cn 1 a k nc ck cn p 6 xcn for all n then b n 1 c cn is the required set if f p k is a homeo morphism and c is f admissible then for every a fix a countable f admissible set b containing see proposition 2 1 next using lemma 2 2 we construct a disjoint sequence cn of finite sets with c 1 a c cn 1 a k nc c k where c k ck b cn p 6 xcn for all n then b n 1 c c n is f admissible and satisfies the required con ditions 3 homeomorphisms on product spaces for any space x let h x denote the set of all homeomorphisms on x equipped with the compact open topology in this section we prove that h x where x is a product of compact metric spaces is an absolute extensor for compact 0 dimensional spaces our proof uses the technique developed in 5 proposition 3 1 let k h x be a lindelo f subset where x a x is a product of compact metric spaces with a then a can be covered by a family of sets a such that for every we have a b if is a limit ordinal a a 1 and a 1 a is countable for all on homogeneity of cantor cubes 5 for every f k there is f h xa with a f f a proof in case a is countable we take a a for all suppose a is uncountable and let b a be a countable set take a sequence of open covers un n 1 of xb such that diam un 1 n for all n since xb is metrizable and x is compact the compact open topology on the function space c x xb coincides with the limitation topology 11 recall that 1 u c x xb is open with respect to the limitation topology if for every f u there is v cov xb such that u contains the set b f v g c x xb g is v close to f here cov xb is the family of all open covers of xb and g is v close f provided for any x x there is v v containing both points f x and g x in particular every b f v contains a neighborhood b f v of f there exists a natural map pb h x c x xb pb h b h which is continuous when both h x and c x xb carry the compact open topology claim 3 2 there is a countable set b a containing b such that for every f k there exist f b g b c x b xb with b f f b b and b f 1 g b b since for each n the family b b f un f k is an open cover of pb k there is a sequence fni i 1 h x such that b b fni un i 1 covers pb k similarly there exists sequences gni i 1 h x n 1 such that b b gni un i 1 cov ers pb k 1 where k 1 f 1 f k as in the proof of proposition 2 1 there is a countable set b containing b and corre sponding to each n sequences ni i 1 c x b xb and ni i 1 c x b xb such that b fni ni b and b gni ni b for all n i then for every f k there exist two sequences nin n 1 c x b xb and nin n 1 c x b xb such that b f is un close to nin b and b f 1 is un close to nin b for each n the last condition implies that the sequence nin n 1 uniformly converges to a map f b c x b xb and b f f b b the sequence nin n 1 also converges uniformly to a map g b c x b xb and b f 1 g b b claim 3 3 for every countable set b a there is a countable set b a containing b such that for every f k there exist homeo morphisms f b g b h x b with b f f b b and b f 1 g b b indeed using the notations from claim 3 2 we construct an increas ing sequence b n of countable subsets of a such that b 0 b and 6 e shchepin and v valov b n b n 1 for every n 1 let b n 1 b n then for every f k there exist sequences fn and gn satisfying the following conditions fn gn c xb n xb n 1 b n 1 f fn b n and b n 1 f 1 gn b n the last two conditions imply that if f k then for every x y x with b x b y we have b f x b f y and b f 1 x b f 1 y therefore there exist homeomorphisms f b g b h x b satisfying the required conditions now for every take a countable set a satisfying the hypotheses of claim 3 3 with b let a if is a limit ordinal and a a 1 otherwise since for every a and f k there exist f g h x with f f and f 1 g we have a f x a f y and a f 1 x a f 1 y for any pair x y x with a x a y this yields a homeomorphism f h xa such that a f f a next theorem is an analogue of mednikov s result 5 corollary 3 stating that h 0 1 a is an absolute extensor for compact spaces theorem 3 4 let x a x be a product of compact metric spaces then h x is an absolute extensor for zero dimensional com pact spaces proof suppose y is a 0 dimensional compact space and g p h x be a map where p is closed in y if a is countable then h x is a complete separable metric space so we can consider h x as a closed subset of l 2 and find a continuous extension g y l 2 of g by the well known factorization theorem there is a metric 0 dimensional compactum y 0 and a maps g 0 y 0 l 2 and h y y 0 with g g 0 h then p 0 h p is a closed subset of y 0 since y 0 is 0 dimensional there is a retraction r y 0 p 0 finally the composition g 0 p 0 r h is a map from y to h x extending g assume a is an uncountable set of cardinality then a can be covered by a family a satisfying the hypotheses of proposition 3 1 with k g p then for every and f k we have a 1 a f 1 f a 1 a denote by h x the subspace of h x consisting of all f with the following property for every there is f h xa such that f on homogeneity of cantor cubes 7 and f 1 satisfy therefore k h x so it suffice to show that h x is an absolute extensor for 0 dimensional compacta since xa 1 xa xa 1 a the map f 1 is of the form f 1 x y f x g x y where x xa and y xa 1 a and g is a map from xa 1 into xa 1 a such that for any x xa the map g x g x y g x y is a homeomorphism on xa a therefore by 3 theorem 3 4 9 the correspondence g g is a homeomorphism between c xa h xa a and the subset of c xa 1 xa 1 a consisting of all g such that for each x xa the map g x belongs to h xa a hence the correspon dence f g f 1 provides a homeomorphism between the spaces c xa h xa a and h xa 1 where h xa 1 consists of all homeomorphisms f 1 on xa 1 satisfying equality this means that there is one to one correspondence between h x and the product h xa 0 c xa h xa 1 a this cor respondence is a homeomorphism when all function spaces carry the compact open topology it remains to show that each multiple in this product is an absolute extensor for 0 dimensional compacta this is true forh xa 0 because a 0 is countable let s prove that each c xa h xa 1 a is also an absolute extensor for 0 dimensional compacta to this end take a pair l z of 0 dimensional compacta and a map from l to c xa h xa 1 a since h xa 1 a is a separa ble complete metric space and xa is a compactum of weight c xa h xa 1 a is a complete metric space of weight so c xa h xa 1 a can be embedded in l 2 and can be extended to a map z l 2 because the image z is a metric compactum we can repeat the arguments from the first paragraph of our proof and obtain an extension z c xa h xa 1 a of everywhere below by c we denote the cantor set corollary 3 5 let p and k be proper closed subsets of ca and f be a homeomorphism between p and k suppose there exist a proper subset b a and a homeomorphism fb between pb and kb such that p pb c a b and k kb c a b fb b b f fb can be extended to a homeomorphism f b h c b then f can be extended to a homeomorphism f h ca proof since fb b b f f is of the form f x y fb x h x y with x y pb c a b such that for each x pb the map x defined 8 e shchepin and v valov by x y h x y belongs to h c a b so we have a map pb h ca b see 3 theorem 3 4 9 by theorem 3 4 we can extend to a map cb h ca b and define h ca ca b h x y x y where x y cb ca b finally f x y f b h x y provides a homeomorphism in h ca extending f 4 extending homeomorphisms in this section we prove the following generalization of theorem 1 2 theorem 4 1 let f be a homeomorphism between closed negligible subsets p and k of d with such that p p and k k then f can be extended to a homeomorphism on d lemma 4 2 let x y be 0 dimensional paracompact spaces and c be the cantor set suppose p x c k y c are closed sets such that x p x y k y and the sets c x c p and c y c k are nowhere dense in c for all x x and y y let f p k and g x y be homeomorphisms with g x y f then f can be extended to a homeomorphism f x c y c such that g x y f proof for any x x let x be the set of all h h c such that f x c g x h c for all c 1 x x p since for every x x the restriction f 1 x x p is a homeomorphism between the nowhere dense subsets 1 x x p and 1 y g x k of c by 4 there is hx h c extending f 1 x x p hence x 6 moreover the sets x are closed inh c equipped with the compact open topology so we have a set valued map x h c one can show that if admits a continuous selection x h c then the map f x c y c defined by f x c g x x c is the required homeomorphism extending f therefore according to michael s 7 zero dimensional selection theorem it suffices to show that is lower semi continuous to prove that let x x be a fixed point and h x w where w is open in h c we can assume that w is of the form h h c h ui vi i 1 2 k where ui k i 1 is a clopen disjoint cover of x c and vi k i 1 is a disjoint clopen cover of g x c we extend the sets ui and vi to clopen sets u i x c and v i y c such that 1 u i o x ui and v i g o x vi where o x is a clopen neighborhood of x in x 2 o x can be chosen so small that f u i p v i k on homogeneity of cantor cubes 9 we are going to show that for every x o x there exists hx x w we fix such x and observe that all sets u i x u i x c and v i x v i g x c are compact and perfect moreover p i x u i x p and k i x v i k are nowhere dense sets in u i x and v i x respectively and f x i f u i x p is a homeomor phism between p i x and k i x for every i hence by 4 there exist homeomorphisms f xi u i x v i x extending f x i because u i x k i 1 and v i x k i 1 are disjoint clopen covers of 1 x x and 1 y g x re spectively the homeomorphisms f xi i 1 2 k provide a homeomor phism h x between 1 x x and 1 y g x extending f 1 x x p then the equality hx c h x x c c c defines a homeomorphism from h c with hx x w therefore is lower semi continuous proof of theorem 4 1 we identify d with da where a is a set of cardinality we first consider the case when we already observed that the theorem is true when a is countable so let a be uncountable and consider two copies of da ca one containing p and the other containing k each of the open sets c a p and ca k contains dense functionally open sets say v p and v k and choose a countable set c a such that 1 c c v p v p and 1 c c v k v k hence pb and kb are nowhere dense subsets of cb for any set b a containing c next using corollary 2 3 we can cover a by an increasing family a and find homeomorphisms f pa ka satisfying the following conditions 3 a a if is a limit ordinal and the cardinality of each a is less than 4 a 1 a is countable and c a for all 5 a f f a 6 a 1 a p and a 1 a k are nowhere dense sets in c a 1 a it remains to prove that each f can be extended to a homeomor phism f h c a such that 7 a 1 a f 1 f a 1 a the proof is by transfinite induction the first extension f 1 exists by 4 because pa 1 and ka 1 are nowhere dense subsets of c a 1 if f is already defined for all where is a limit ordinal then item 3 implies the existence of f therefore we need only to define f 1 provided f exists 10 e shchepin and v valov to this end consider the spaces x pa and y ka the sets p pa 1 x c a 1 a k ka 1 y c a 1 a and the homeomorphisms f 1 f for any x x and y y let p x p x ca 1 a and k y k y ca 1 a item 6 yields that a 1 a p x and a 1 a k y are nowhere dense sets in ca 1 a for every x pa and y ka therefore by lemma 4 2 the homeomorphism f 1 can be extended to a fiberwise homeomorphism f 1 pa c a 1 a ka c a 1 a finally by corollary 3 5 there is a homeomorphism f 1 h c a 1 satisfying condition 7 suppose now that p and k are negligible in ca and then a is uncountable and p p k k so by 2 there is a set b a of cardinality with p 1 b pb and k 1 b kb according to proposition 2 1 we can assume that b is f admissible so there exists a homeomorphism fb pb kb with b f fb b moreover the sets pb and kb are negligible in c b hence by the already established case of theorem 4 1 fb can be extended to a homeomorphism f b h c b then corollary 3 5 implies the existence of a homeomorphism f h ca extending
