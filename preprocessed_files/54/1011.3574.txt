ar x iv 1 01 1 35 74 v 2 m at h g n 6 d ec 2 01 0 core compactness and diagonality in spaces of open sets francis jordan and fr d ric mynard abstract we investigate when the space ox of open subsets of a topological space x endowed with the scott topology is core compact such conditions turn out to be related to infraconsonance of x which in turn is characterized in terms of coincidence of the scott topology of ox ox with the product of the scott topologies of ox at x x on the other hand we characterize diagonality of ox endowed with the scott convergence and show that this space can be diagonal without being pretopological new examples are provided to clarify the relationship between pretopologicity topologicity and diagonality of this important convergence space 1 introduction definitions and notations concerning convergence structures follow 1 and are gathered as an appendix at the end of these notes if x is a topological space we denote by ox the set of its open subsets ordered by inclusion it is a complete lattice in which the scott convergence in the sense of for instance 9 is given by 1 1 u limf u f f int o f o where f is a filter on ox and its topological modification the scott topology has open sets composed of compact families 1 ox can be identified with the set c x of continuous functions from x to the sierpi ski space because the indicator function of a x is contin uous if and only if a is open via this identification the convergence 1 1 coincides with the continuous convergence x on c x and its topological modification t x coincides with the scott topology on the other hand for a general convergence space x the underly ing set of x can still be identified with the collection ox of open subsets of x or tx but the characterization 1 1 of convergence in x when interpreted as a convergence on ox needs to be modified recall that a family s of subsets of a convergence space x is a cover 1 see the appendix for definitions 1 http arxiv org abs 1011 3574 v 2 2 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard if every convergent filter on x contains an element of the family s in general u lim x f if the family o f o f f is a cover of u for the induced convergence given a convergence space x it is known e g 19 6 that the following are equivalent y t x y x ty 1 2 t x x x t x 1 3 x t x 1 4 let us call a convergence space x satisfying this condition t dual in the case where x is topological the latter is well known to be equiva lent to core compactness of x e g 11 18 recall that a topological space x is core compact if for every x and o o x there is u o x such that every open cover of o has a finite subfamily that covers u in 6 a convergence space is called core compact if whenever x limf there is g f with x limg and for every g g there is g g such that g is compact at g a convergence space is called t core compact if whenever x limf and u otx x there is f f that is compact at u it is shown in 6 that 1 5 x is core compact x is t dual x is t core compact the three notions clearly coincide if x is topological however so far it was not known whether they do in general at the end of the paper we provide examples example 22 and example 23 showing that none of the arrows can be reversed for general convergence spaces it was observed in 10 that if x is topological then so is x therefore x is then t core compact which makes x for x topo logical but not core compact a natural candidate to distinguish core compactness from t core compactness this however fails in view of proposition 1 below in the next section we also investigate under what condition t x that is ox with the scott topology is core compact this question while natural in itself is motivated by its connection with the now recently solved problem 7 problem 1 2 of finding a completely regular infraconsonant topological space that is not consonant see section 3 for definitions we observe in section 3 that x is infraconsonant whenever t x is core compact and we prove more generally that x is infraconsonant if and only if the scott topology on ox ox for the product order coincides with the product of the scott topologies at the point x x theorem 13 infracon sonance was introduced while studying the isbell topology on the set of real valued continuous functions over a topological space in fact core compactness 3 a completely regular space x is infraconsonant if and only if the is bell topology on the set of real valued continuous functions on x is a group topology 5 corollary 4 6 on the other hand the fact that the scott topology on the product does not coincide in general with the product of the scott topologies has been at the origin of a number of problems and errors e g 9 p 197 therefore theorem 13 provides new motivations to investigate infraconsonance in section 4 we show that for a topological space x despite the fact that x is topological whenever it is pretopological x does not need to be diagonal in general diagonality of x is characterized in terms of a variant of core compactness that do not need to coincide with core compactness 2 core compactness of ox as x can be identified with ox for any convergence space x the space x has as underlying set the set of scott open subsets of ox that is if x is topological the set x of openly isotone compact families on x note that the family u a x u a u ox forms a subbase for a topology on x called stone topology as observed in 8 proposition 5 2 when x is topological the con vergence x is based in filters of the form 2 1 o p o p p p where p is an ideal subbase of open subsets of x that is such that there is p p with q p 0 q p whenever p 0 is a finite subfamily of p more precisely for every filter f on x with u lim x f there is an open cover p of u that forms an ideal subbase such that u lim x o p and o p f note also that 2 2 a b a lim x b for every a and b in x in particular if o is x open a o and a b x then b o proposition 1 if x is topological then x is core compact so that x is topological more specifically x can be identified with the space x with the stone topology 4 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard proof let u lim x o p for an ideal subbase p of open subsets of x then for each p p the set o p is a compact subset of x because p lim x o p indeed p int o o p o u is x open for each u ox indeed if a u lim x f then b f b f f is a cover of a in the sense of convergence so that there is f f with b f b u because u lim x u a in other words f u so that u f conversely if o is x open and a o there is u a such that u o otherwise for each u a there is b x with u b and b o in that case u b x u b b o 6 for all u a note also that in view of 2 2 bu bv u v whenever bu u and bv v therefore i i u i ui a card i is a filter base generating a filter f this filter converges to a in x to show that we need to see that b u b u a is a cover of a for x in view of the form 2 1 of a base for x it is enough to show that if u 0 a and p is an ideal subbase of open subsets of x covering u 0 then there is a a with b a b o p because u 0 p p p and a is a compact family there is a finite subfamily p 0 of p such that p p 0 p a since p is an ideal subbase there is p p a then o p b p b which concludes the proof that a lim x f on the other hand o f which contradicts the fact that o is open for x in order to investigate when t x that is ox with the scott topology is core compact we will need notions and results from 6 the concrete endofunctor epit of the category of convergence spaces and continuous maps is defined on objects by epit x i t x where i x x is defined by i x f f x in view of 6 theorem 3 1 2 3 w epit x t x w where x w have the same underlying set in particular x is t dual if and only if x epit x a convergence space x is epitopological if i x x is initial in the category conv of convergence spaces and continuous maps epitopologies form a reflective subcat egory epi of conv and the concrete reflector is given on objects by epix i x because epix x we assume from now on that every space is epitopological observe that a topological space is epitopological note that if x is t dual then epix x core compactness 5 is topological therefore in contrast to proposition 1 x is not t dual if x is not topological proposition 2 let x be an epitopological space then x is topological if and only if x is t dual note also that epix epit x and that epit epi epit so that epit restricts to an expansive endofunctor of epi by iterat ing this functor we obtain the coreflector on t dual epitopologies more precisely if f is an expansive concrete endofunctor of c we define the transfinite sequence of functors f by f 1 f and f x f f x for each epitopological space x there is x such that epi x t x epi x 1 t x dtx proposition 3 the class of t dual epitopologies is concretely core flective in epi and the coreflector is dt proof the class of t dual convergences is closed under infima because i i xi z i i xi z indeed if each xi is t dual then i i xi i i xi i i t xi t i i xi t i i xi and i i xi is t dual the functor epit is expansive on epi and therefore so is dt moreover dtx is t dual for each epitopological space x because dtx epi x 1 t x t epi x t x t dtx therefore for each epitopological space x there exists the coarsest t dual convergence x finer than x by definition x x dtx then x x and x is topological so that x t x but epit x is the coarsest convergence with this property therefore epit x x epit x and dtx x proposition 4 if x is a core compact topological space so is t x proof under these assumptions x t x and x is t dual by proposition 1 therefore t x is a core compact topology 6 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard however if x is a non topological t dual convergence space 2 then x t x is not core compact by proposition 2 in other words we have proposition 5 if x is t dual then x is topological if and only if x t x is core compact in particular dtx is topological if and only if dtx is core com pact theorem 6 if x tdtx then t x is core compact if and only if x is a core compact topological space proof we already know that if x is a core compact topological space then x t x and that x is core compact by proposition 1 conversely if t x is core compact then t x is topological so that epit x is topological under our assumptions we have x tdtx t epit x epit x so that x is t dual therefore x t x is core compact and in view of proposition 2 x is topological and t dual hence a core compact topological space note that at least among hausdorff topological spaces theorem 6 generalizes 16 corollary 3 6 that states that if x is first countable then x is core compact if and only if t x is core compact indeed the locally compact coreflection kx of a hausdorff topological space is t dual so that dtx kx hence if x is a hausdorff topological k space that is x tkx in particular a first countable space then x tdtx we will see in the next section that similarly if x is a consonant topological space then t x is core compact if and only if x is locally compact problem 7 are there completely regular non locally compact topo logical spaces x such that t x is core compact of course in view of the observations above such a space cannot be a k space or consonant 3 core compact dual consonance and infraconsonance a topological space is consonant 4 if every scott open subset a of ox is compactly generated that is there are compact subsets ki i i of 2 such convergences exist take for a instance a non locally compact hausdorff regular topological k space then x tkhx but x khx so that khx is non topological core compactness 7 x such that a i i o ki a space is infraconsonant 7 if for every scott open subset a of ox there is a scott open set c such that c c a where c c c d c d c the notion s importance stems from theorem 8 below if the set c x y of continuous functions from x to y is equipped with the isbell topology 3 we denote it c x y while ck x y denotes c x y endowed with the compact open topology note that c x t x theorem 8 5 let x be a completely regular topological space the following are equivalent 1 x is infraconsonant 2 addition is jointly continuous at the zero function in c x r 3 c x r is a topological vector space 4 t x t x t x is jointly continuous on the other hand if x is consonant then c x r ck x r so that consonance provides an obvious sufficient condition for c x r to be a topological vector space hence theorem 8 becomes truly inter esting if completely regular examples of infraconsonant non consonant spaces can be provided 7 problem 1 2 the first author recently ob tained the first example of this kind the following results show that a space answering positively problem 7 would necessarily be infracon sonant and non consonant and might provide an avenue to construct new examples theorem 9 if x is topological and t x is core compact then x is infraconsonant proof 7 lemma 3 3 shows the equivalence between 1 and 4 in theorem 8 and that the implication 4 1 does not require any separation therefore it is enough to show that t x t x t x is continuous since x is topological x is t dual by propo sition 1 in view of 1 2 t x x x t x so that t x x t x t x if t x is core compact hence t dual then t x t x t x t x so that 3 1 t x x t x t x 3 whose sub basic open sets are given by a u f c x y a a f a u where a ranges over openly isotone compact families on x and u ranges over open subsets of y 8 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard therefore the continuity of x x x implies that of t x x t x because t is a functor and in view of 3 1 that of t x t x t x theorem 10 let x be a topological space if ck x is core compact then x is locally compact proof if x is not locally compact then ck x x e g 18 2 19 so that there is u 0 ox with u 0 lim x nk u 0 therefore there is x 0 u 0 such that x 0 int v o k v whenever k is a compact subset of x with k u 0 in other words for each such k and for each u o x 0 there is vu o k and xu u vu then ck x is not core compact at u 0 indeed there is u 0 o x 0 such that for every compact set k with k u 0 the k open set o k is not relatively compact in o x 0 to see that consider the cover s o xu u o x 0 of o x 0 no finite subfamily of s covers o k because for any finite choice of u 1 un in o x 0 we have w i ni 1 vui o k but w i n i 1 o xui note that a hausdorff topological space x is locally compact if and only if it is core compact and that the scott open filter topology on o x then coincides with ck x e g 9 lemma ii 1 19 hence theorem 10 could also be deduced for the hausdorff case from 16 corollary 3 6 corollary 11 if x is a consonant topological space such that t x is core compact then x is locally compact 4 scott topology of the product versus product of scott topologies we now turn to a new characterization of infraconsonance which motivates further the systematic investigation of the notion proposition 12 t x 2 is the scott topology on ox ox theorem 13 a space x is infraconsonant if and only if the prod uct t x 2 of the scott topologies on ox and the scott topology t x 2 on the product ox ox coincide at x x lemma 14 a subset s of ox ox is x 2 open if and only if 1 s s that is if u v s and u u v v then u v s core compactness 9 2 s is coordinatewise compact that is i i oi j j vj s i 0 i j 0 j i i 0 oi j j 0 vj s proof assume s is x 2 open and let u v s and u u v v then u v lim x 2 u v so that u v s assume now that i i oi j j vj s then o i f oi f i is a filter base for a filter on ox such that i i oi lim x and o j d vj d j is a filter base for a filter on ox such that j j vj lim x hence s because s is x 2 open therefore there are finite subsets i 0 of i and j 0 of j such that o i i 0 oi o j j 0 vj s so that i i 0 oi j j 0 vj s conversely assume that s satisfies the two conditions of the lemma and u v s lim x 2 since u g int g g g and v h int h h h we have by the first condition that g int g g g h int h h h s by the second condi tion there are g 1 gk and h 1 hn such that k i 1 int g gi g n j 1 int h hj h s therefore int g k i 1 gi g int h n j 1 hj h s so that k i 1 gi n j 1 hj s and s proof of proposition 12 in view of lemma 14 every x 2 open sub set of ox ox is scott open conversely consider a scott open subset s of ox ox we only have to check that s statisfies the second condition in lemma 14 let i i oi j j vj s the set d i i 0 oi j j 0 vj i 0 i j 0 j is a directed subset of ox ox for the coordinatewise inclusion order whose supremum is i i oi j j vj as s is scott open there are finite subsets i 0 of i and j 0 of j such that i i 0 oi j j 0 vj s lemma 15 if a x then sa u v ox ox u v a is x 2 open 10 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard proof let i i oi j j vj sa then i i oi j j vj i j i j oi vj a by compactness of a there is a finite subset i 0 of i and a finite subset j 0 of j such that i j i 0 j 0 oi vj a so that i i 0 oi j j 0 vj sa in view of lemma 14 sa is x 2 open lemma 16 if s is x 2 open then s ox u v u v s is a compact family on x proof if u v i i oi for some u v s then i i oi i i oi s so that in view of lemma 14 there is a finite subset i 0 of i such that i i 0 oi i i 0 oi s hence i i 0 oi s proof of theorem 13 suppose that x is infraconsonant note that t x 2 t x 2 is always true so that we only have to prove the reverse inequality at x x consider an x 2 open neighbor hood s of x x by lemma 16 the family s is compact by infraconsonance there is c x with c c s note that c c s because if c 1 c 2 c c then c 1 c 2 s so that c 1 c 2 u v for some u v s and therefore c 1 c 2 s conversely assume that n x 2 x x nt x 2 x x and let a x by lemma 15 sa n x 2 x x so that sa nt x 2 x x in other words there are families b and c in x such that b c sa in particular d b c belongs to x and satisfies d d sa by definition of sa we have that d d a and x is infraconsonant 5 topologicity pretopologicity and diagonality of x a convergence space x is diagonal if for every selection s x fx with x limx s x for all x x and every filter f with x 0 limx f the filter 5 1 s f f f x f s x converges to x 0 if this property only holds when f is additionally principal we say that x is f 1 diagonal of course every topology is diagonal in fact a convergence is topological if and only if it is both pretopological and diagonal e g 3 core compactness 11 in order to compare our condition for diagonality of x with core compactness we first rephrase the condition of core compactness lemma 17 a topological space is core compact if and only if for every x x every u o x and every family h of filters on x we have 5 2 h h adhh u x adh h h h proof if x is core compact then there is v o x which is rel atively compact in u if adhh u for every h h then u h h clh c so that by relative compactness of v in u there is for each h h a set hh h with v clhh then h hhh h h h but h h hh v so that x adh h hh conversely if 5 2 is true consider the family h h fx adhh u in view of 5 2 x adh h h h so that there is v o x such that v h hh now v is relatively compact in u because any filter than meshes with v cannot be in h and has therefore adherence point in u recall that x p x if and only if x is t core compact and that if x is topological x is topological whenever it is pretopo logical while the latest follows for instance from the results of 6 it seems difficult to find an elementary argument in the literature which is why we include the following proposition which also illustrates the usefulness of lemma 17 proposition 18 if x is topological and x is pretopological then x is topological proof we will show that under these assumptions x satisfies 5 2 let x x and u o x let h be a family of filters satisfying the hypothesis of 5 2 let h h consider the filter base h o x cl h h h on x since adh h u it follows that u limh since x is pretopological u lim h h h in particular there exist for each h h a hh h such that x int h h o x cl hh int h h x cl hh int x h h cl hh x cl h h hh thus x adh h h h 12 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard in other words if x is pretopological it is also diagonal provided that x is topological we will see that even if x is topological x is not always diagonal moreover it can be diagonal without being pre topological examples 20 and 21 and pretopological but not diagonal example 23 when x is no longer assumed to be topological we call a topological space injectively core compact if for every x x and u o x the conclusion of 5 2 holds for every family h of filters such that there is an injection h o u satisfying adhh h for each h h as such a family h clearly satisfies the premise of 5 2 every core compact space is in particular injectively core compact theorem 19 let x be a topological space the following are equiva lent 1 x is injectively core compact 2 x is diagonal 3 x is f 1 diagonal proof 1 2 let s ox fox be a selection for x and let u lim x f if x u there is f f such that x int o f o v note that f o v for each o f consider the filter ho on x generated by clx w s w c s s o because o lim x s o we have that adhx ho o because x is injectively core compact and h ho o f satisfies the required condition with ho o we conclude that x adhx o f ho in other words there is h o f ho such that x clx h that is x intx h c therefore for each o f there is so s o such that x int o f int w so w int w o f so w in other words there is f f and m o f s o such that x intx w m w that is u lim x s f 2 3 is clear 3 1 suppose x is not injectively core com pact then there is x x u o x and a family h of filters on x with an injective map h o u such that h adhx h for each h h but x adhx h h h define a relation on h by h 1 h 2 provided that the collections cl h h h 1 and cl h h h 2 both generate the same filter clearly is an equiv alance relation let h h be such that h contains exactly one element of each equivalance class of for each h h let h be the filter with base cl h h h let j h h h define j o u so that j h where h h is such that j h it is easily checked that is injective since core compactness 13 adh h adh h for every h h we have j adh j it is also easy to check that x adh j j j for each j j the filter j generated on ox by the filter base ox x j j j converges to j consider now the subset j of o u ox and the selection s ox fox defined by s j j for each j j and s o o for o j this is indeed a well defined selection because is injective notice that u lim x j because j o u let l s j we may pick from each j j a closed set jj j such that j j ox x jj l let v be an open neighborhood of x since x adhx j j j and j j jj j j j there is an j 0 j such that v jj 0 6 since v 6 x jj 0 and x jj 0 ox x jj 0 l v 6 ox x jj 0 since ox x jj 0 l v 6 l since v was an arbitrary neighborhood of x x 6 int l thus u s j therefore x is not f 1 diagonal a cardinal number is regular if a union of less than many sets of cardinality less than has cardinality less than a strong limit cardinal is a cardinal for which card 2 a whenever card a a strongly inaccessible cardinal is a regular strong limit cardinal uncountable strongly inaccessible cardinals cannot be proved to exist within zfc though their existence is not known to be inconsistent with zfc let us denote by the assumption that such a cardinal exist example 20 a hausdorff space x such that x is diagonal but not pretopological under assume that is a uncountable strong limit cardinal let x be the subspace of endowed with the order topology obtained by removing all the limit ordinals but since x is a non locally compact hausdorff topological space x is not pretopological to show that x is injectively core compact we only need to consider x and u o in the definition because is the only non isolated point of x let h be a family of filters on x admitting an injective map h o u such that adhh h for each h h let be the least element of u for each h h there is hh h such that hh so that card h moreover cardh cardo u 2 since is a strong limit cardinal cardh since is regular h h hh so that adh h hh we do not know if the existence of large cardinals is necessary for the construction of a hausdorff space x such that x is diagonal and not pretopological however we can construct in zfc a t 0 space x such that x is diagonal and not pretopological 14 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard example 21 a t 0 space x such that x is diagonal but not pre topological let z stand for integers c be the cardinality of the con tinuum and c be the cardinal successor of c let be a point that is not in c z and x c z for each n c z define s n k and n k for each c let t k and k z topologize x by declar ing all sets of the form t and s n to be sub basic open sets we show that x is not core compact at let u be a neighborhood of there is an such that t u notice that t 1 s 0 n n z is a cover of x but no finite subcollection covers t thus x is not core compact at in particular x is not pretopological let n x let u be an open neighborhood of n since n u it follows from the way we chose our sub base that t n u since n has a minimal open neighborhood x is core compact at n let v be an open neighborhood of there is an such that t v let u x be an open superset of v for every n z u c n 6 for each n z define n min n u notice that n n u c n and n since each open superset of v will determine a unique sequence n n z it follows that the open supersets of v can injectively be mapped into the countable sequences on z since z has cardinality at most c z has at most c many countable sequences thus v has most c many supersets let v be an open neighborhood of h be a collection of filters and h ox v be an injection such that adh h h for every h h since v has at most c many open supersets h c let h h since adhh there is an h c such that adh h t h let suph h h 1 c it is easy to check that adh h hh t thus x is injectively core compact at since x is injectively core compact at each point x is diagonal by theorem 19 example 22 a t dual convergence space that is not core compact consider a partition an n of the set of free ultrafilters on satisfying the condition that for every infinite subset s of and every n there is u an with s u let m mn n be disjoint from and let x m define on x the finest convergence in which lim mn m for all n and each free ultrafilter u on converges to mn and mn only where n is defined by u an claim x is not core compact core compactness 15 proof let mn m and u an pick s s u and k 6 n for every u u there is w ak such that u w but limw mk is disjoint from s claim x is t core compact and therefore x is pretopological proof for each mn m the set m is included in every open set containing mn because mn k lim mk if u is a non trivial con vergent ultrafilter in x then limu mn for some n for any s u s is infinite and any free ultrafilter w on s belongs to one of the element ak of the partition so that limw mk intersects m and therefore any open set containing mn claim x is diagonal proof let s ox fox be a selection for x and let u lim x f now f f f is a convergence cover of u let x u and d be a filter on x such that x limd there is an f f and a d d such that d f v assume x in which case d x in particular x o for every o f for every o f there is a to s o such that x to now x o f to s f so o f to x d assume x m in this case m o 6 for all o f and by definition of the convergence on x m o for all o f since o lim x s o and m o there is s s o such that x s and since each element of s is open m s if there is no s s o such that o s then the filter h generated by o s s s o s s 0 is non degenerate notice that it is not free for otherwise there would be an n and u an with u h but mn limu o and there would be s s o such that s u which is not possible therefore there is y s s o o s which contradicts o lim x s o hence there is s 0 s o such that o s 0 now d f o f so in particular o f so d thus j j s f is a cover of u and x is diagonal therefore x is pretopological and diagonal hence topological and x is t dual example 23 a convergence space that is t core compact but not t dual let m be any topological space such that m is not diago nal and l be a countably infinite set disjoint from m let x m l we now make x into a convergence space define x lim x for each x x for each x m define x lim f whenever f is the cofinite filter on l or a filter that that converges to x in m with its topology for x l define x lim x note that any non empty 16 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard open subset o of x that intersects m contains all but finitely many points of l claim x is pretopological proof let o x and p be a family of filters on x such that o limp for every p p suppose x o l for every p p there is a pp p such that x pp so p p pp x suppose that x o m and f is such that x limf we show that for each p p there is a qp p such that o qp suppose to the contrary that o 6 p for every p p there is a p 0 p such that x p 0 consider the filter h on l generated by the filter base o l p p p and p p 0 we show that h is not a free filter otherwise h is finer than the cofinite filter on l and therefore x limh since p p p is a convergence cover of o and x limh there is a h h and a p p such that h p since o l p h we have h o l p h so h is not free and there is l h this contradicts the fact that p p p is in particular a set theoretic cover of o l now o p pqp so that p pqp f because o is open and therefore belongs to f hence j j p pp is a convergence cover of o and o lim p pp that is x is pretopological claim x is not diagonal proof since m is not diagonal there is by theorem 19 an x m and a open neighborhood j m of x and a family h of filters on m and an injection h om j such that adhm h h for each h h and x adhm h h h by our definition of we have that x adh h hh let u h hh be an ultrafilter on m such that x lim u define h ot j by h l h notice that j l lim x h h h since m is closed in x we have adhm h adh h adht h for each h h so that the collection x clt h h h is an ideal cover of h let eh be the filter on x that is gen erated by the collection o x clt h h h then h lim x eh for each h h and the collection eh h h is a selec tion for h h h pick eh eh for each h h by definition of eh there is for each h an hh h we may assume hh m such that o x clt hh eh so eh o x clt hh x clt hh x hh now h h eh h h eh h h x hh x h h hh core compactness 17 since h h hh h hh h h hh u hence h heh u thus e e h h eh is not a convergence cover of j l hence j l lim x h h eh therefore x is not even f 1 diagonal 6 appendix convergence spaces a family a of subsets of a set x is called isotone if b a whenever a a and a b we denote by a the smallest isotone family containing a that is the collection of subsets of x that contain an element of a if a and b are two families of subsets of x we say that b is finer than a in symbols a b if for every a a there is b b such that b a of course if a and b are isotone then a b a b this defines a partial order on isotone families in particular on the set fx of filters on x every family f i of filters on x admits an infimum i f i f i f f f on the other hand the supremum even of a pair of filters may fail to exist we call grill of a the collection a h x a a h a 6 it is easy to see that a a if and only if a is isotone in particular f f f if f is a filter we say that two families a and b of subsets of x mesh in symbols a b if a b equivalently if b a the supremum of two filters f and g exists if and only if they mesh in which case f g f g f f g g an infinite family f i of filters has a supremum i f if pairwise suprema exist and for every i there is i with f f f a convergence on a set x is a relation between x and the set fx of filters on x denoted x lim f whenever x and f are in relation satisfying that x lim x for every x x and lim f lim g whenever f g the pair x is called a convergence space a function f x y between two convergence space is contin uous if x lim f f x lim f f where f f is the filter f f f f on y if and are two convergences on the same set x we say that is finer than in symbols if lim f lim f for every f fx this defines a partial order on the set of convergence structures on x which defines a complete lattice for which supremum i i i and infimum i i i of a 18 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard family i i i of convergences are defined by lim i i i f i i lim i f lim i i i f i i lim i f every topology can be identified with a convergence in which x limf if f n x where n x is the neighborhood filter of x for this topology a convergence obtained this way is called topological moreover a function f x y between two topological spaces is continuous in the usual topological sense if and only if it is continuous in the sense of convergence on the other hand every convergence determines a topology in the following way a subset c of a conver gence space x is closed if lim f c for every filter f on x with c f a subset o is open if its complement is closed that is if o f whenever lim f o 6 the collection of open subsets for a convergence is a topology t on x called topological modification of the topology t is the finest topological convergence coarser than if f x y is continuous so is f x t y t in other words t is a concrete endofunctor of the category conv of convergence spaces and continuous maps continuity induces canonical notions of subspace convergence prod uct convergence and quotient convergence namely if f x y and y carries a convergence there is the coarsest convergence on x mak ing f continuous to y it is denoted f and called initial con vergence for f and for instance if s x and x is a convergence space the induced convergence by on s is by definition i where i is the inclusion map of s into x similarly if xi i i i is a family of convergence space then the product convergence i i i on the carte sian product i ixi is the coarsest convergence making each projection pj i ixi xj continuous in other words i i i i ip i i in the case of a product of two factors x and y we write for the product convergence on x y dually if f x y and x is a convergence space there is the finest convergence on y making f continuous from x it is denoted f and called final convergence for f and if f x y is a surjection the associated quotient convergence on y is f note that if is a topology the quotient topology is not f but tf the functor t is a reflector in other words the subcategory top of conv formed by topological spaces and continuous maps is closed under initial constructions note however that the functor t does not commute with initial constructions in particular t t t core compactness 19 but the reverse inequality is genrally not true similarly if i s x is an inclusion map i t t i but the reverse inequal ity may not hold a convergence is pretopological or a pretopology if lim i f i lim f of course every topology is a pre topology but not conversely for any convergence there is the finest pretopology p coarser than moreover x limp f if and only if f v x where v x x lim f f is called vicinity filter of x the subcategory prtop of conv formed by pretopological spaces and continuous maps is reflective closed under initial constructions moreover in contrast with topologies the reflector p commutes with subspaces however like t it does not commute with products the adherence adh f of a filter f on a convergence space x is by definition adh f h f lim h u u f lim u where ux denotes the set of ultrafilters on x and u f denotes the set of ultrafilters on x finer than the filter f we write adh a for adh a note that in a convergence space adh may not be idempo tent on subsets of a in fact a pretopology is a topology if and only if adh is idempotent on subsets we reserve the notations cl and int to topological closure and interior operators a family a of subsets of x is compact at a family b for if f a adh f b we call a family compact if it is compact at itself in particular a subset a of x is compact if a is compact and compact at b x if a is compact at b given a class d of filters a convergence is called based in d or d based if for every convergent filter f say x limf there is a filter d d with d f and x limd a convergence is called locally compact if every convergent filter contains a compact set and hereditarily locally compact if it is based in filters with a filter base composed of compact sets for every convergence there is the coarsest locally compact con vergence k that is finer than and the coarsest hereditarily locally compact convergence kh that is finer than both k and kh are concrete endofunctors of conv that are also coreflectors if a x and x is a convergence space then o a denotes the collection of open subsets of x that contain a and if a is a family of subsets of x then o a a ao a a family is called openly isotone if a o a note that in a topological space x an openly 20 francis jordan and fr d ric mynard isotone family a of open subsets of x is compact if and only if when ever i i oi a and each oi is open there is a finite subset j of i such that i j oi a if x and y are two convergence spaces c x y or c deonte the set of continuous maps from x to y the coarsest conver gence on c x y making the evaluation map e x c x y y e x f f x jointly continuous is called continuous convergence and denoted x y or explicitely f lim x y f x x g fx x lim g f x lim e
