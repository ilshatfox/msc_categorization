almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin abstract the hurwitz problem asks which ramification data are realizable i e appear as the ramification type of a covering we use dessins d enfant to show that families of genus 1 regular ramification data with small changes are realizable with the exception of four families which were recently shown to be nonrealizable a similar description holds in the case of genus 0 ramification data 1 introduction a central goal in algebra topology and geometry is describing maps using simple combinatorial data in the equivalent categories of topological coverings branched coverings f r s of compact connected orientable 1 riemann surfaces and algebraic morphisms of smooth projective curves each map has a fundamental invariant called its ramification type the latter is the multiset of ramification multisets ef q q f 1 p where p runs over branch points of f for example the ramification type of the map p 1 p 1 given by x 2 is 2 2 where p 1 p 1 c is the complex projective line or equivalently the 2 dimensional real sphere the hurwitz existence problem is a classical question in the theory of coverings which seeks to classify under which conditions such combinatorial data arises from a covering since the problem remains open only in the case of coverings of s p 1 we shall henceforth restrict to this case an obvious necessary condition for such data is that it is consistent with the riemann hurwitz formula namely a tuple e of nontrivial partitions e 1 er of n is called a ramification data if 1 ge 1 n 1 2 r i 1 e ei e 1 is a nonnegative integer the integers n ge r are called the degree genus and number of branch points of e respectively the hurwitz problem then asks which ramification data are realizable as the ramification type of a covering of p 1 the case of ramification data of high genus is relatively well understood namely if e is a ramification data of degree n and genus at least n 1 2 then e is realizable by edmonds kulkarni stong 5 moreover in view of recent computations zheng suggests 17 that every ramification type of genus at least 3 and degree at least 5 is realizable in genus 2 the only infinite family of nonrealizable ramification types found so far is 2 2 2 3 5 2 where 2 denote that all remaining elements in the multiset equal 2 moreover the nonoccuring genus 1 ramification data in zheng s 17 table 3 are all almost regular that is almost all entries in each multiset are equal such patterns can also be identified among the genus 0 ramification data in 17 table 2 we consider families of almost regular ramification data in the most subtle case where the ram ification data is of genus is 0 or 1 that is where the covering space is either p 1 or a torus here a family t ti i n of ramification data with r branch points is called almost regular of type k 1 kr and error 2 at most if there exist a tuple aj of positive integers different from kj for each j 1 r such that each ti is of the form a 1 k 1 ar k r with degree tending to infinity 1 the hurwitz problem for nonorientable riemann surfaces reduces to the orientable case 5 proposition 2 7 2 note that there are many possible definitions of error such as the one defined by taking i j e ti j e kj 1 ar x iv 1 70 9 06 86 9 v 2 m at h g t 2 1 s ep 2 01 7 2 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin and such that the sum r j 1 a aj a for example the ramification data 2 2 2 14 4 2 are almost galois of type 2 2 2 2 with error at most 8 the ramification type of galois coverings is regular that is almost regular with error 0 the ramification types of genus 0 galois coverings were already known to klein 9 and the ramification types of genus 1 galois coverings are well known to be regular of type 2 2 2 2 or 3 3 3 or 2 4 4 or 2 3 6 particular families 3 of almost regular ramification data of the latter four types have been well studied notably pascali petronio 14 theorems 0 4 0 5 0 6 give necessary and sufficient arithmetic conditions on the degrees of the genus 0 ramification data 1 1 2 1 4 1 4 2 1 3 1 3 1 3 and 3 1 2 1 3 1 6 to be realizable moreover the realizability of many almost regular families of the above types was also proved in the classification of monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of low genus see 6 11 12 on the other hand recently do zieve 18 showed that the genus 1 ramification data a 1 3 2 2 2 2 is nonrealizable and conjectured the nonrealizability of the following data b 2 4 3 3 3 c 2 3 5 4 4 d 2 3 5 7 6 see section 5 for another proof of the nonrealizability of type a a simple proof of this conjecture was given by corvaja zannier 3 and a proof can also be derived from izmestiev kusner rote springborn sullivan 4 8 in this paper we give a method of extending realizations of small degree ramification data to realizations of families of almost regular ramification data these imply that with the exception of the above four families all families of genus 1 almost regular ramification data with some bounded error are realizable in contrast with the genus 0 situation discussed above theorem 1 1 let t be a family of almost regular genus 1 ramification data of type k 1 kr error at most where ti is not one of the above exceptional types a d for i n then all but finitely many members of t are realizable if 6 or if k 1 kr 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 and 10 moreover our method allows gluing together realizations of almost regular families of ramifi cation data into families with arbitrary amount of changes with bounded entries for families of almost regular ramification data of type 2 2 2 2 this gives theorem 1 2 every family of almost regular ramification data of genus 1 of the form 1 k 1 3 m 1 2 1 k 2 3 m 2 2 1 k 3 3 m 3 2 1 k 4 3 m 4 2 with fixed ki mi n 0 i 1 4 except for the type 1 3 2 2 2 2 is realizable in all sufficiently large degrees the hurwitz problem can be viewed as combinatorial in nature but the tools used in its study are diverse coming from group theory topology and geometry we use a mix of these techniques with a focus around dessins d enfant given a ramification data e of genus g and three branch points a dessin for e is a bicolored nondirected graph on a genus g surface where the multisets of valencies of white vertices black vertices and faces correspond to the three multisets of e see section 2 1 for the definition of the valency of a face and the definition in the case of more than three branch points the central example here is that of dessins corresponding to families of regular ramification data of types 3 3 3 2 4 4 2 3 6 or 2 2 2 2 which are regular tilings of the torus by hexagons or squares called regular dessins cf section 2 2 it is well known that the the realizability of a ramification data is equivalent to the existence of a dessin for that data thus by making an absolutely bounded number of changes to each member in a family of regular dessins ci i n such as adding or removing an edge or an isolated vertex one obtains a family of dessins whose corresponding ramification type is almost regular we call such families of dessins almost regular this transition from regular to almost regular families of 3 many authors consider a generalized almost regular ramification where one of the multisets has an absolutely bounded amount of entries such as n 2 n 2 2 2 cf 15 13 4 the results in 8 imply that types b d are nonrealizable but do not apply to a almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 3 dessins is a special case of what will be referred to as local changes later see definition 2 2 to prove theorem 1 1 we first realize a single ramification type ti as a dessin ci for i n we then show that the changes made to obtain ci from a regular tiling can also be made to a regular dessin with an arbitrary sufficiently large number of hexagons or squares so that all tj of sufficiently large degree are realizable and in fact by a family of almost regular dessins this yields a stronger version of theorem 1 1 stated explicitly in theorem 3 6 to prove theorem 1 2 we show that the constructed almost regular dessins can be glued together this suggests that furthermore the answer to the following question is positive question 1 3 is every family of almost regular ramification data of genus 1 different from types a d above with arbitrary error realizable in all sufficiently large degrees 5 are such families realizable by families of almost regular dessins our proof of theorem 1 1 implies that the answer is positive for families with error 6 or families of type 2 2 2 2 or 3 3 3 with error 10 theorem 1 2 gives further evidence for a positive answer where is arbitrary but the entries are bounded we note that our methods can be used to prove similar results for larger errors or larger uniform bounds on the entries but new methods are required to answer this question entirely similarly we prove the following partial analogue for genus 0 coverings theorem 1 4 with the exception 6 of 2 1 3 2 2 6 every family of almost regular ramification data of genus 0 with 6 is realizable in infinitely many degrees moreover for families of type 2 2 2 2 or 3 3 3 the same assertion holds with 10 in genus 0 we use the weaker notion of quasi local changes which allows the error to grow within a family linearly with the degree and replace families of regular dessins on the torus by families of regular spherical type which are quotients of regular dessins by symmetries of the torus see section 6 the outline of the paper is as follows we first give some background information on dessins next we explain our theory of almost regular dessins and local changes then we prove the above results first for genus 1 and then genus 0 acknowledgements we thank nir lazorovich for the help in proving lemma 3 4 and konstantin golubyev for helpful discussions we thank michael zieve for introducing the composition obstruc tion used in conjecture 6 3 and other helpful discussions this work is partially supported by the israel science foundation grant no 577 15 and the united states israel binational science foundation grant no 2014173 2 preliminaries 2 1 dessins we give a very brief introduction into standard results on coverings and dessins for more see e g 10 let f r p 1 be a degree n covering of compact connected riemann surfaces with ordered branch point set s p 1 pr and without loss of generality assume pr let p 0 p 1 s choose paths i from p 0 to pi for i 1 r 1 ordered counter clockwise the union of i i 1 r 1 is called a star tree cf 10 section 6 1 a dessin for f is the inverse image f 1 viewed as a vertex colored graph on r with vertex set f 1 s p 0 and f as a coloring function on the vertices that is we add the label i to each vertex whose image under f is pi for i 1 r 1 we follow convention and leave out the color p 0 in drawings classically the term dessin is often restricted to the case r 3 with s 0 1 and 0 1 described 5 by the expression all degrees we always mean all degrees which are compatible with the congruence conditions prescribed by the ramification type 6 the nonrealizability of 2 1 3 2 2 6 has already been proved by zieve 4 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin in the introduction two dessins d 1 and d 2 with the same branch point set or more generally two colored graphs on surfaces r 1 and r 2 are equivalent if there exists an orientation preserving homeomorphism r 1 r 2 under which d 1 and d 2 are isomorphic as colored graphs with this equivalence relation the choice of paths from p 0 to pi does not matter the graph theoretical information given by a dessin embedded in a surface r encodes all rel evant information about the underlying covering f in fact this information together with the branch point set determines the covering up to isomorphism in particular the ramification type of f can be recovered from the dessin namely for any given branch point pi i 1 r 1 the corresponding partition in the ramification type of f is simply the multiset of vertex degrees of points in f 1 pi in the dessin similarly for the last branch point pr vertex degrees should be replaced by degrees of faces in the dessin where the degree of a face is defined as the number of vertices of any given label which are adjacent to the face note that every face has the same number of vertices of each label the hurwitz existence problem is therefore equivalent to an existence problem of dessins with a given corresponding ramification type we conclude by noting that the graph theoretical structure of a dessin is of course independent of the position of the branch points in p 1 and that choosing a different ordering of the branch point set p 1 pr used for the definition of a dessin corresponds to a duality of graphs switching vertex colors and possibly interchanging faces and vertices of a certain label to answer existence questions we may choose any ordering of the partitions in a given ramification type 2 2 almost regular families of dessins and local changes a regular ramification data is a ramification data containing only a single entry up to multiplicity in each multiset a regular dessin is a dessin whose ramification type is regular in particular any dessin corre sponding to a galois covering is a regular dessin the riemann hurwitz formula implies that there are four genus 1 regular ramification data 2 4 2 2 3 6 2 4 and 3 3 where the exponent denotes the number of occurrences of a tuple in the ramification data these are realized in figure 1 below as regular tilings on a torus that is as a quotient of one of the regular tilings of the plane with specified colorings here we identify the top and bottom as well as left and right sides of the square to get a torus in the usual way we note that 6 proposition 5 1 1 implies that every dessin with regular ramification type 7 is equivalent to a tiling of r by regular hexagons as in section 1 we consider only almost regular families ti i n whose irregular entries are the same for all i and the higher degree members of this family are obtained by adding regular entries remark 2 1 the results in this paper hold more general for the following definition of almost regular ramification data call a family t ti i n of ramification data with r branch points of generalized almost regular of type k 1 kr of error at most if deg ti as i and the sum of errors r j 1 i j is at most for every i n where the error i j is the sum of irregular entries in ti j different from kj for j 1 r there is no loss of generality in restricting to our definition since for a given the number of almost regular ramification types of a fixed degree with error at most is bounded by a constant independent of the degree of the ramification type we may then restrict to suitable subfamilies all of whose members have the same irregular entries a change to a dessin consists of adding or removing an edge connecting a preimage of some branch point to a preimage of the base point or an isolated vertex of any color definition 2 2 local changes to families of dessins let ci i n and di i n be two families of dessins on a surface r all with the same set of branch points we say that ci i is realizable as local changes to di i if there exists a constant c n such that for all i n applying at most c changes to ci gives a dessin equivalent to di if in addition di i is a family of regular dessins we call ci i a family of almost regular dessins 7 in 6 two dessins or more generally normal graphs with the same ramification type are called combinatorially equivalent and for regular ramification data this is shown to imply topological equivalence almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 5 a 232 416 416 b 236 324 612 c 212 212 212 212 d 312 312 312 figure 1 the 4 regular types of dessins on a torus figure 2 shows a family of dessins realizable as local changes to 2 2 2 2 the following figure 2 212 212 1 1 211 4 210 lemma shows that definition 2 2 is independent of the choice of base graph 6 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin lemma 2 3 let fi i n and gi i n be two families of coverings from a surface x to p 1 with the same branch point set p 1 pr p 1 let s p 1 be a star tree passing through p 1 pr 1 and let s be a graph on p 1 with vertices p 1 pr 1 pr denote the dessins ci f 1 i s and c i f 1 i s respectively di g 1 i s and d i g 1 i s for i n if di i is obtained via local changes from ci i then also d i i is obtained via local changes from c i i 8 proof at first fix i n and let ni be the degree of fi then ci consists of copies of s glued together at some of the ramification points of fi label the copies of s by sj for j ii if qj k sj denotes the preimage of pk under fi for k 1 r 1 then the homotopy lifting property implies that in the preimage of s under fi the vertices qj 1 qj r 1 are connected by a graph isomorphic via fi to s for j ii thus the graph c i is obtained by replacing each sj with a copy s j of s for j ii note that the gluing of the copies s j j ji in c i is done at the same vertices as the gluing of the copies sj j ii in ci analogously the same holds for di and d i denote the copies of s and s in di and d i by tj and t j for j ji respectively since by assumption di i is obtained via local changes from ci i there exist subsets i i ii and j i ji such that the cardinalities of ii i i and ji j i are bounded by a constant independent of i and an isomorphism i between the subgraph j iisj and the subgraph j j itj for every i n since c i and d i are obtained from ci and di respectively by replacing copies of s with copies of s the isomorphism i induces an isomorphism i between the subgraph j i i s j and the subgraph j j i t j for every i n as the number of vertices and edges in the complement of these subgraphs is bounded by a constant independent of i c i i and d i i differ by local changes note that if the family ci i of dessins is realizable as local changes to a family di i then the corresponding ramification types differ by an absolutely bounded amount of entries as these correspond to the degrees of vertices and faces in particular if ci i is a family of almost regular dessins then also the family of ramification types of ci i is almost regular the converse of this simple observation can be seen as the second part of question 1 3 3 proofs of the main results for g 1 3 1 reduction arguments here we review some elementary techniques to reduce existence of certain ramification types to other types 3 1 1 composition composition of a degree n covering f r p 1 with a non constant degree d rational function g p 1 p 1 yields a degree nd covering g f r p 1 for example the regular ramification type 2 k 32 k 3 6 k 3 may be realized by composing a covering of ramification type 3 k 3 3 and suitable choice of branch points with a covering of ramification type 2 2 as follows let f t p 1 be a covering from the torus to the sphere of ramification type 3 k 3 3 and branch point set 1 1 define g p 1 p 1 by x 7 x 2 the branch points of g are 0 and and the only preimages of these are also 0 and respectively multiplicativity of ramification indices then shows that the branch points of g f are 0 1 and and its ramification type is 2 k 32 k 3 6 k 3 composition with rational function preserves local changes in the sense of definition 2 2 lemma 3 1 let fi i n and gi i n be two families of coverings r p 1 with the same branch point set let h p 1 p 1 a covering let ci di c i d i be the dessins corresponding to fi gi h fi h gi respectively for i n if ci i is obtained by local changes from di i then c i i is obtained by local changes from d i i n 8 of course local changes between arbitrary families of colored graphs are to be defined exactly as for families of dessins in definition 2 2 almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 7 proof let s s 1 sk be the set of finite branch points of h fi for i n and t h 1 s let s p 1 be a star through s then c i is equivalent and hence can be replaced by the preimage under fi of the graph g h 1 s with vertex set t similarly d i can be replaced by the preimage under gi of g since ci i is obtained by local changes from di i lemma 2 3 implies that the family of colored graphs f 1 i g i n are obtained by local changes from g 1 i g 3 1 2 a simple example of a local change in addition to the the technique of composing maps existence of certain ramification data can be obtained by preforming certain moves on realizable ramification data an example is the following lemma which changes only certain entries of a ramification data we denote by aj a multiset of entries in the j th partition lemma 3 2 let r 3 let t be the ramification data a a 1 b a 2 a 3 a 4 assume d is a dessin with ramification type t in which there exists a vertex of degree a and label 1 adjacent to a vertex of degree b and label 2 then the following ramification data is realizable t k a k a 1 b k a 2 1 k a 3 1 k ar for every k n furthermore if an infinite family of ramification data ti i n is realizable by a family of almost regular dessins then the same holds for the corresponding family of ramification data t k i i n proof replace a line connecting the two vertices of degree a and b by the the construction in figure 3 this increases the degree of those two vertices by k each furthermore k vertices of degree 1 are added for each other vertex color and similarly k faces of degree 1 are added figure 3 adding k faces of degree 1 and k degree 1 vertices the second claim follows since the transition from ti to t k i with the above construction adds only a bounded number of edges and vertices 3 2 a method for local changes to dessins on the torus the following proposition is our main tool to form dessins on a torus from a single dessin with suitable properties we first introduce terminology related to tilings of the plane with regular polygons let a be the 2 dimensional plane tiled with polygons of diameter bounded from below a subset d of polygons is called a disk of radius r if it consists of all polygons of graph distance at most r from a single polygon called the center of the disk here the distance of two polygons is the minimal number of polygons on a path connecting the centers of the polygons consider the induced tiling on the torus obtained from quotienting a by a lattice with generators the longitude and meridian of the torus the parallelogram p formed by longitude and meridian is the fundamental domain for the torus if a disk of polygons of radius r is completely contained in the inside of the fundamental domain then the induced graph on the torus contains a disk of radius r a family of graphs di i n on a torus contains disks of arbitrary radius if for every r n there exists i 0 n such that di contains a disk of radius r for all i i 0 8 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin proposition 3 3 let c 0 be a constant there exists a constant r r c depending only on c with the following property let ti i n be a family of almost regular genus 1 ramification data if there exist k n and a dessin ck for tk which is obtained by at most c changes to a regular dessin containing a disk of radius r then with the exception of finitely many terms the family ti i is realizable by local changes to a family of regular dessins containing disks of arbitrary large radius our strategy is to remove part of the regular tiling and replace it with an almost regular tiling without changing the rest of the tiles to do so we show there exists a tiling of the torus consisting of any sufficiently large number of hexagons and containing disks of arbitrary large radius the proof is carried out with hexagons but also applies to squares lemma 3 4 given n n the torus can be tiled by a regular dessin consisting of n hexagons moreover for all r n and sufficiently large n compared to r there is such tiling containing a disk of radius r proof we want to show that we can quotient a hexagon tiling of the plane by a parallelogram lattice containing the centers of n hexagons to obtain a tiling of the torus with n hexagons which contains a disk of radius r if n is sufficiently large begin with a tiling of the plane by hexagons consider the short exact sequence 1 z 2 z 2 z n 1 finding a parallelogram containing the centers of n hexagons is equivalent to finding a map z 2 z 2 of determinant n to get a disk of radius r inside the parallelogram for all sufficiently large n it suffices to have side lengths tending to infinity and angle bounded away from 0 there are three cases if n a 2 is a square we use the parallelogram spanned by the columns of the matrix a 00 a and the angle between the column vectors is a right angle if n is not a square choose a such that a 2 n a 1 2 then either a 2 or a 1 2 is nearer to n choose k such that either k n a 2 a or k a 1 2 n a in the latter case use the matrix a 1 k 1 a 1 this matrix has determinant n the length of the column vectors is at least a n 1 the angle between the column vectors has cosine a 1 k a 1 a 1 2 1 a 1 2 k 2 k 1 2 a 1 k 1 2 0 1 where the last inequality holds for a 10 since the result is clearly bounded away from 1 the angle is bounded away from 0 in the case where k n a 2 use the matrix a 1 k 1 a 1 and a similar but simpler computation yields that cosine of the angle is bounded by 1 2 and hence the angle is bounded away from 0 picking the parallelogram this way gives a tiling of the torus by n hexagons and if n is sufficiently large a parallelogram which contains a disk of radius r proof of proposition 3 3 let dk be a regular dessin on the torus which without loss of generality contains a disk of radius r consisting of regular polygons and assume that ck is a dessin of ramification type tk which is obtained from dk by at most c changes note that these changes can only affect a bounded number of polygons in dk depending only on c consider the fundamental domain p for dk in the plane if r is sufficiently large in comparison to c then there exists some parallel to the longitude which intersects none of the polygons affected by the above changes analogously for the meridian that is we may assume without loss by translating p that none of the changes affect polygons which intersect the meridian or longitude of p we can thus extend the tiling of our fundamental domain to a tiling of the plane which matches a tiling by regular polygons outside of this fundamental domain now choose r n sufficiently large e g such that in the extended tiling above there is a disk of polygons of radius r which contains the complete fundamental domain p in its interior by almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 9 lemma 3 4 for any sufficiently large i n we can tile the torus by a regular dessin consisting of exactly i hexagons resp squares containing a disk of polygons of radius at least r we remove hexagons resp squares within the radius r sub disk and replace them by the same changes as for the dessin ck since this always requires only the fixed number c of changes we obtain a dessin ci of ramification type ti for all sufficiently large i and such that the family ci i arises as c changes to a family of regular dessins containing disks of arbitrary large radius cf figure 2 a key observation for the proof of our main results is that under the assumptions on ti i n the implication of proposition 3 3 is also compatible with composition of maps as made precise in lemma 3 5 below note the iterative nature of this lemma which will be made use of in the reduction arguments in the following section lemma 3 5 let fi i n and gi i n be families of coverings t p 1 with gi i n galois let di i n be a family of regular dessins for gi i n which contains disks of arbitrary radius and assume the dessins ci i n for fi i n are obtained by local changes to di i n let tj j n be a family of genus 1 almost regular ramification data and h p 1 p 1 a fixed covering such that the ramification types of h fi i n are contained in tj j n then tj j n are realizable in every sufficiently large degree by a family of almost regular dessins c j j n 9 furthermore the family c j j n is obtained by local changes to a family of regular dessins con taining disks of arbitrary radius proof at first fix i n we first note that by multiplicativity of ramification indices since the ramification types of the family h fi are almost regular of genus 1 the ramification types of the family h gi are regular of genus 1 assume ci and di are drawn as preimages of some star tree s p 1 once again via topological deformation di can be assumed to correspond to a tiling of the plane by regular polygons quotiented by a lattice let pi be a fundamental domain of this lattice next choose a star tree s p 1 passing through all but one branch point of h fi let c i and d i be the corresponding dessins for h fi and h gi respectively so c i is the preimage f 1 i h 1 s with the appropriate vertex coloring note d i again yields a regular tiling of the torus by lemma 2 3 and as in the proof of lemma 3 1 we can replace the dessins ci i resp di i of fi i resp gi i by the preimages under fi i resp gi i of g h 1 s so that c i i are obtained by local changes to d i i it remains to show the assertion for all members of the family tj j and not only those corre sponding to ramification types of h fi i to do so it suffices to show that the family d i i contains disks of arbitrarily large radius and apply proposition 3 3 with sufficiently large r to obtain this we claim that the number of polygons in each neighborhood on t of a vertex in d i differs from the number of polygons in di by at most a constant factor depending only on h and independent of i n indeed as shown in the proof of lemma 2 3 the graph di is obtained by gluing copies of s together at the preimages of branch points in a certain way and d i is obtained from di by replacing each such copy of s by a copy of g h 1 s and gluing together at the same preimages moreover when a given copy of the star s around a vertex q 0 on the torus is replaced by a copy of g then the edges of g may intersect only edges from that copy of s and vice versa in particular every side of a polygon in di is contained in at most a constant amount d 1 of polygons in d i where d 1 is a constant depending only on h and independent of i n since both di and d i are tilings either by hexagons or by squares it follows that any disk of polygons of radius r in di contains a disk of polygons of radius at least r d 2 in d i where d 2 is a constant depending only on h and independent of i n since by assumption di i contain disks of arbitrary large radius this implies that d i i contains disks of arbitrary large radius 9 we emphasize here that we obtain a statement for all sufficiently large degrees of some family of ramification types and not only for those degrees which correspond to a decomposable covering h fi 10 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin let c be an absolute constant such that c i is obtained from d i i by at most c changes and let r c be the constant from proposition 3 3 since d i i contains disks of arbitrary large radius there exists k n such that d k contains a disk of radius at least r c thus we can apply proposition 3 3 to realize all ramification data tj j of sufficiently large degree by local changes to regular dessins which contain disks of arbitrary large radius 3 3 proof of theorem 1 1 we now come to the proof of theorem 1 1 in fact we prove the following stronger version for families of almost regular dessins theorem 3 6 let ti i n be a family of almost regular genus 1 ramification data of type k 1 kr error at most where ti is not one of four exceptional types a d for i n then all but finitely many members of ti i are realizable if 6 or if k 1 kr 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 and 10 moreover the realizations can be chosen to be families of almost regular dessins proof a

that nr really ought to stand for no reduction given as it may be possible to reduce types in a different way than we have done here first we show existence of all ramification types marked nr for each ramification data we draw a dessin we use two essentially different approaches for drawings most families are drawn as part of a changed regular tiling so it clear how to extend them to larger tilings containing disks of arbitrary radius proposition 3 3 then implies the existence of almost regular dessins of arbitrary sufficiently large degree for each ramification data with such

2 3 3 1 5 3 non existence of types marked ne is shown is section 5 we next show the existence of all the types marked r by reducing to types marked nr thereby completing the proof of theorem 3 6 the data 5 26 32 is reduced by lemma 3 2 applied with k 1 for the rest of the cases marked r we use lemma 3 1 case 15 is reduced to case 2 as follows let g be the genus 0 covering of the sphere given by x 7 x 2 and let f be a covering with ramification type 1 5 3 3 3 and branch points e g 1 1 in this order then the composition g f has branch points 0 1 and ramification type 2 1 5 3 6 since the first type has already almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 13 been realized in all degrees divisible by 3 this argument yields realizability of the second type in all degrees divisible by 6 which is all possible degrees for all other cases in which we apply lemma 3 1 we reduce to families of dessins which contain disks of arbitrary large radius existence for types with at least two occurrences of the partition 2 are reduced as follows let g be the genus 0 covering of the sphere given by x 7 x 2 and let f be a covering with ramification type that we reduce to and assume its branch points are 1 1 1 1 in this order then the composition g f has two branch points 0 and with all ramification indices equal to 2 whereas two branch points the two branch points 1 1 resp 1 1 of f merge into one branch point of g f by lemma 3 5 the reduced ramification data are realizable in all sufficiently large degrees similarly the other reductions via lemma 3 1 are given in the above tables are obtained by composing families of covering f realized by dessins containing disks of arbitrary radius with the genus 0 covering g given either by x 7 x 2 or x 7 x 3 3 4 almost regular families with bounded ramification indices the next lemma shows realizations by almost regular dessins can be combined it is an ingredient in the proof of theorem 1 2 which is an existence argument for almost regular genus 1 types whose ramification indices are all bounded from above by 3 lemma 3 7 suppose the families of ramification data aj e j bj e j j 1 r are realizable by almost regular dessins containing disks of arbitrarily large radius then the family aj bj e j j 1 r is realizable by almost regular dessins containing disks of arbitrary large radius proof the same proof as in proposition 3 3 applies only here in sufficiently large degrees both the changes for t 1 and t 2 can be applied simultaneously in a non overlapping manner to a regular torus tiling which then results in the type t proof of theorem 1 2 below we show existence in infinitely many degrees since all families of dessins of type 2 2 2 2 constructed above either by drawing or by reduction arguments contain disks of arbitrary radius proposition 3 3 implies the existence of almost regular dessins in all suffi ciently large degrees let t 1 k 1 3 m 1 2 1 k 2 3 m 2 2 1 k 3 3 m 3 2 1 k 4 3 m 4 2 be a family of almost regular ramifi cation data since such families with error at most 10 are realizable by theorem 1 1 we can assume that t is almost regular with error 10 the idea of the following proof is to split the type t into two halves in the following way set t 1 1 a 1 3 b 1 2 1 a 2 3 b 2 2 1 a 3 3 b 3 2 1 a 4 3 b 4 2 t 2 1 c 1 3 d 1 2 1 c 2 3 d 2 2 1 c 3 3 d 3 2 1 c 4 3 d 4 2 with integers ai bi ci di such that ai ci ki and bi di mi for each i 1 4 and such that 4 i 1 ai 4 i 1 bi the last equality ensures that t 1 and t 2 are again of genus 1 if we can now show that the families t 1 and t 2 are realizable by almost regular dessins containing disks of arbitrary large radius then by lemma 3 7 the assertion follows for the type t now if we can choose the two types t 1 and t 2 such that 2 t 1 and t 2 are different from 2 4 and 1 3 2 2 3 then the assertion follows by induction on the error if t is of even degree so that ki mi is even for all i then up to permuting the partitions of t we can assume one of the following a k 1 m 1 2 b k 1 1 and m 1 2 c mi 1 for all i 1 4 14 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin we treat these cases separately in case a define t 1 and t 2 via a 1 b 1 2 ai bi 0 for all i 2 3 4 thus forcing c 1 k 1 2 d 1 m 1 2 ci ki and di mi for all i 2 3 4 assuming the error is 10 this leads to data t 1 t 2 as desired in 2 unless or t is one of 1 1 3 33 2 2 3 or 2 12 32 2 1 3 2 2 2 in those two cases t 2 would become a non existent type in case b because of even degree and genus 1 we have ki 2 for some i 2 3 4 without loss for i 2 define t 1 and t 2 by b 1 2 a 2 and ai bj 0 otherwise this works unless t was one of 3 1 33 2 12 2 2 2 4 32 2 13 3 2 2 2 or 5 32 2 12 2 1 3 2 2 in case c note that the condition 4 i 1 ki 4 i 1 mi together with even degree leave only two types with error 10 namely 1 3 2 3 2 and 1 3 2 4 the latter one can be split into 1 3 2 2 2 2 and 2 2 1 3 2 2 the type 6 1 3 2 3 2 cannot be split and is therefore another exception next assume t is of odd degree so ki mi is odd for all i and in particular every partition in t must contain at least one odd entry then up to permuting the partitions in t one of the following holds d k 1 k 2 1 and m 3 m 4 1 e m 2 m 3 m 4 0 f k 2 k 3 k 4 0 in case d set a 1 a 2 b 3 b 4 1 and ai bj 0 otherwise this works except when t is one of 7 12 3 2 1 2 3 2 2 and 8 1 2 2 3 2 1 32 2 in case e note that k 2 k 3 k 4 1 and hence m 1 3 set a 2 a 3 a 4 1 b 1 3 and ai bj 0 otherwise this succeeds unless t is one of 9 1 2 3 33 2 or 10 1 2 3 1 34 2 finally case f can be treated just like case e with the roles of entries equal to 1 and equal to 3 exchanged the exceptional cases here are then exactly 11 3 2 3 13 2 and 12 3 2 3 14 3 2 it therefore suffices to deal with the total of 12 above exceptional types firstly the six types 5 32 2 12 2 1 3 2 2 6 1 3 2 3 2 9 1 2 3 33 2 10 1 2 3 1 34 2 11 3 2 3 13 2 12 3 2 3 14 3 2 are drawn in at the end of the proof the following types on the right arise via appropriate composition of genus zero and genus one types by lemma 3 1 5 3 32 2 12 2 1 3 2 2 1 33 2 12 2 2 2 3 1 1 33 2 12 2 2 2 13 33 2 2 3 6 2 1 3 2 3 2 12 32 2 1 3 2 2 2 11 4 3 2 3 13 2 32 2 13 3 2 2 2 in the first reduction 5 3 we compose a genus 1 covering f with the ramification type on the left with a degree 2 genus 0 covering g of ramification type 2 2 with the following conditions the two points of ramification structure 12 2 and 2 for f lie in a common fiber of g same for the two points of ramification structure 32 2 and 1 3 2 the two ramified points of g do not ramify further under f for 3 1 we compose the genus zero ramification type 2 2 in the obvious way with the genus one type on the left a similar composition works in the other two reductions note that for these four reductions we make use of proposition 3 3 and lemma 3 5 to apply these it suffices to note that the genus 1 families were realized by almost regular dessins containing disks of arbitrary radius types 7 8 arise from the types on the left via lemma 3 2 with k 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 32 2 1 2 2 3 2 1 32 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 1 3 2 12 3 2 1 2 3 2 2 the dessins that follow complete the proof for the 12 exceptional types and hence the theorem almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 15 type 6 1 3 2 3 2 type 5 32 2 12 2 1 3 2 2 type 11 3 2 3 13 2 type 9 1 2 3 33 2 type 12 3 2 3 14 3 2 type 10 1 2 3 1 34 2 16 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin 4 realizability of almost regular ramification data on a sphere in this section we prove theorem 1 4 but first we note several differences from the genus 1 case firstly families of almost regular ramification data of genus zero are in general not realizable in all degrees see section 1 in particular it should be noted that the argument of proposition 3 3 ensuring existence in all sufficiently large degrees does not apply here secondly the notion of regular ramification types is not of use here since as a consequence of the riemann hurwitz formula there are no infinite families of regular ramification data in genus zero we therefore provide a pure existence result theorem 1 4 for the case of genus 0 see however the appendix where we develop terminology generalizing the notions of regular dessins and of local changes and give some evidence for strengthening of theorem 1 4 proof of theorem 1 4 a straightforward calculation shows that all of the genus 0 almost regular ramification data satisfying the riemann hurwitz formula with 10 from the types 3 3 or 2 4 or with 6 from 2 3 6 or 2 4 4 are

label nr for no reduction given and ne for non existent almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 17 for all types marked nr see the drawings in the pdf companion it is easy to see that all of them can be drawn iteratively in infinitely many degrees by adding rings of hexagons around the middle the reduction arguments indicated above are carried out as in section 3 3 here a reduction to a family that has already been realized in infinitely many degrees yields the same result for the family marked r with the exception of types 12 36 49 52 where the reduction is via lemma 3 2 the reductions are all done by composing with a genus 0 covering we carry out two of the reductions deserving special attention explicitly firstly the type 30 can be obtained in the following way let h p 1 p 1 be defined by x 7 x 2 x 1 this covering has ramification type 2 1 2 1 3 denote by ai j the unique preimage of the i th branch point of h with multiplicity j for 1 i j 2 let g be a covering of ramification type 2 2 3 1 1 6 whose branch points in this order are a 1 1 a 2 2 and a 2 1 then h g has ramification type 2 1 1 4 6 3 secondly lemma 3 2 yields type 52 from type 45 by adding an edge between a vertex of degree 2 and an adjacent one of degree 1 to make sure that there are two such adjacent vertices it suffices to observe that if all vertices of degree 1 were connected to each other they would form their own connected component contradicting that the whole dessin is connected finally we show that the type 2 1 3 2 2 6 is nonrealizable this argument was also previ ously used by zieve to show the nonrealizability of this type we first claim that this ramification type has to correspond to a decomposable covering indeed call p 1 p 2 p 3 the points over which we have ramification 2 1 3 2 2 6 respectively by lemma 9 1 1 in 11 the function has to factor through a degree 2 function with ramification 2 2 over p 1 p 3 proving the claim however since there is no way to split 1 3 among the two preimages of p 2 this ramification data does not occur for decomposable coverings either we conclude this section by noting that as the error is increased one can construct infinitely many almost regular families of spherical ramification types which are not realizable using the same lemma 9 1 1 in 11 as above compare once again with the situation in genus 1 where conjecturally there are only four exceptional families furthermore we expect that as we allow more than six changes to 2 3 6 and 2 4 4 types there will be more ramification types which are realizable only as quasi local changes 5 proofs of nonexistence of almost regular ramification types on a torus in this section we prove following genus 1 ramification types are not realizable 3 3 2 4 3 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 4 3 5 4 2 3 5 7 6 note the last two on this list have 7 but they are shown not to exist in 8 so we include them here for completeness corjava and zannier 3 have provided a non existence argument for the first type the proof uses a counting argument for divisor classes in the picard group of an elliptic curve the next argument shows nonexistence of 2 3 1 3 2 proven independently by do zieve 18 theorem 5 1 the ramification type 2 3 1 3 2 is not realizable in any degree proof since every dessin is induced by a covering it suffices to prove the following statement let n 4 be an even integer there are no permutations 1 4 sn such that all of the following hold a 1 is of cycle type 1 2 3 b 2 4 are all of cycle type 2 c 1 4 1 18 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin assume that such 1 4 exist by c we have 1 2 3 4 1 so 1 2 and 3 4 have the same cycle type we will investigate this cycle type first by looking at 3 and 4 and then by looking at 1 and 2 firstly note that when investigating the cycles of a product xy we can treat each orbit of the group x y separately because every orbit of the latter group is of course a union of orbits of the cyclic group generated by xy x y i e a union of cycles of xy now 3 4 is a product of two fixed point free involutions restrict the action of 3 4 to one of its orbits denote the images of x 3 4 on this orbit by x of course 3 and 4 are still fixed point free involutions note also that 3 4 is transitive but a transitive group generated by two involutions is a dihedral group d 2 k of order 2 k for some k n and the fact that the involutions act without fixed points forces the product 3 4 to have exactly two cycles of length k this last claim is of course easy to see in a purely combinatorial way but can also be shown elegantly using dessins as a special case of riemann hurwitz formula the element 3 4 has to have exactly two cycles and the genus of 3 4 3 4 1 is then zero no other choice for 3 4 would make this genus a non negative integer the corresponding dessin is then a connected planar graph with all vertices of degree 2 i e a circle therefore the two faces have the same degree k the above shows that every cycle length of 1 2 occurs an even number of times we now investigate the orbits of u 1 2 without loss of generality assume that the 3 cycle of 1 is 1 2 3 and the fixed point is 4 first note that all orbits of u are of even length since these orbits are unions of cycles of 2 and the latter has only cycles of length 2 and are unions of cycles of 1 in particular 1 2 3 and 4 have to be contained in the same orbit of u denote this orbit by o the image of 1 on o is then still of cycle type 1 2 3 and the image of 2 is still of type 2 as above denote images by x and note that u acts transitively the riemann hurwitz formula then forces 1 2 to have exactly two cycles and the tuple 1 2 1 2 1 is of genus zero by the riemann hurwitz formula but now there are only two cases each of which will lead to a contradiction i 1 2 has two cycles of the same length k we then obtain a planar dessin of type 1 2 3 2 k k however such a dessin does not exist see e g 13 lemma 4 7 ii 1 2 has two cycles of different lengths k 1 6 k 2 but note that on all other orbits of u except for o 1 and 2 both act as fixed point free involutions so by the same argument as above every cycle length of 1 2 in the action on any of these orbits occurs an even number of times adding the one missing orbit o we find that the cycle length k 1 and of course also k 2 occurs an odd number of times in 1 2 but we showed above that all cycle lengths of 1 2 occur an even number of times this contradiction ends the proof for geometric insight we summarize the proof of 8 for nonexistence of 3 3 2 4 3 the same idea may be used to proved nonexistence of 2 4 3 5 4 and 2 3 5 7 6 let t be a torus with a hexagonal tiling we put an equilateral metric on t by declaring that every edge has length 1 and every hexagon is a euclidean regular hexagon if there were a 3 3 2 4 3 tiling of the torus it would be a regular tiling of hexagons with three hexagons meeting at each vertex except at two special vertices one with two hexagons meeting and one with 4 hexagons this would induce a euclidean metric with exactly two cone singularities in which every point has a neighborhood either isometric to an open subset of the euclidean plane or to the apex of a euclidean cone almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 19 in 8 a contradiction is obtained by studying the holonomy groups of such metrics and proving the holonomy theorem which states that in a euclidean cone metric with two cone points of cur vature 2 n the holonomy group h contains the cyclic group cn of order n as a proper subgroup cn h the holonomy group of a surface m with euclidean cone metric is generated by 1 m together with loops around each of the cone points it is shown in 8 that any hexangulation of m with vertices that can be two colored has holonomy group that is a subgroup of c 3 we can also see this by looking at the developing map into the euclidean plane and noticing that the tiling has a 3 symmetry however the assumptions on the extra vertices of 3 3 2 4 3 imply c 3 is a proper subgroup of the holonomy group c 3 which is a contradiction the idea of the proof of the holonomy theorem is to find additional loops in 1 m by pushing paths into the digon formed by the geodesics between the two cone points this argument works only for types which have changes only in one partition as this condition is necessary to define a euclidean cone metric remark 5 2 any tiling of the torus gives an infinite tiling of the plane as the torus is a quotient of the plane to extend a tiling on the torus with local changes to a tiling of the plane with the same local changes fill in the rest of the lattice outside the fundamental domain with a tiling of regular hexagons or squares however dress 4 has proved there are small changes to hexagon and square tilings which tile the plane but not the torus for example it is possible to tile the plane with four edges meeting at every vertex with a tiling of all squares except one pentagon and one triangle as shown above such a tiling of ramification type 2 4 3 5 4 is not possible on the torus 6 appendix quasi local changes and stability in permutations section 4 contains a pure existence result for almost regular ramification types of genus 0 it is natural to try to prove a local changes property as well as in theorem 3 6 to do so we first have to generalize the notion of regular dessins 6 1 regular spherical types as quotients of a regular type on a torus for any degree n covering f p 1 p 1 of ramification type s 1 sr where the si are partitions of n let g be the galois closure of f i e the unique galois covering g of minimal degree factoring as g f h for some covering h we call the ramification type s 1 sr a regular spherical type if g is of one of the four regular ramification types of genus one it is well known that for a galois covering all ramification indices over one given branch point pi are the same and in the above scenario are in fact equal to lcm si lcm ei 1 ei j where ei 1 ei j is the partition si a regular spherical ramification type is a special case of an almost regular ramification type with this background we can rephrase our above notion of regular ramification types lemma 6 1 assume that a covering f p 1 p 1 of ramification type s 1 sr exists then the following are equivalent i this type is a regular ramification type with galois closure of ramification type k 1 k r one of 2 4 3 3 2 4 2 or 2 3 6 ii for all i lcm si ki iii there is a galois covering g t p 1 from the torus to the sphere and a subgroup u of the corresponding galois group such that f t u p 1 is the induced map on the quotient space note that our definition of regular spherical ramification types is a natural analog of regular ramification types in genus 1 namely by the riemann hurwitz formula the coverings from the torus to the sphere whose galois closure is still of genus 1 are exactly those of regular ramification type 20 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin figure 13 regular 2 2 2 2 and 3 3 3 spherical dessins examples there are several different regular spherical types which may be drawn in non graph isomorphic ways e g 1 2 4 14 2 2 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 are all of the regular almost regular types 2 2 2 2 they can also be constructed more geometri cally consider the 2 tiling of the torus this tiling has a 2 symmetry the symmetry matches that of an individual hexagon the two points of each color are opposite each other this symme try corresponds to a deck transformation of order two on the universal cover which is a tiling of the plane depending on the number of hexagons in the original torus tiling the quotient by this 2 symmetry is one of the three possible regular spherical tilings for 2 4 similarly we can see the regular spherical tilings for the other types also as quotients by a symmetry the 3 3 tiling has a quotient by a 3 symmetry to give a regular spherical dessin see figure 13 the 2 3 6 tiling has a quotient by a 6 symmetry and the 2 4 4 tiling has a quotient by a 4 symmetry to give the respective regular spherical dessins with this view point we want to see the ramification data as changes to these regular spherical types however we must suitably generalize our notion of local changes 6 2 quasi local changes below we generalize the notion of local changes definition 6 2 quasi local changes let ci i n and di i n be two families of dessins on a surface r all with the same set of branch points let ni be the degree of the covering associated to ci and mi be the degree of the covering associated to di assume that ni mi we say that ci i is realizable as quasi local changes to di i if ci can be transformed into di with ki n changes where limi ki ni 0 question 6 3 assume that a family of almost regular ramification types of genus zero is realizable is it then true that it is realizable as quasi local changes to a family of dessins of regular spherical type we found question 6 3 to have a positive answer for all of the ramification types with the restrictions of theorem 1 4 in fact it is not difficult to verify from our drawings that all the 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 and 2 4 4 almost regular types in that theorem are still realizable as local almost regular dessins d enfant on a torus and sphere 21 changes to a regular spherical dessin however computational evidence suggests that the latter is no longer true for all 2 3 6 almost regular types and in particular not for the type 2 2 3 1 1 6 in trying to answer question 6 3 it may be useful to note that our reduction lemmas 3 1 and 3 2 still remain true with the same proofs after replacing the notion of local changes by quasi local changes 6 3 stability in permutations to give some more evidence why it is reasonable to expect ques tion 6 3 as well as question 1 3 to have a positive answer and in particular to justify the above notion of quasi local changes we relate them to a purely group theoretical conjecture by arzhantseva and paunescu 1 recall the following which is a version of the well known riemann existence theorem proposition 6 4 let e e 1 er be a ramification data where the ei are partitions of n then e occurs as the ramification type of a covering of p 1 if and only if there exist permutations 1 r sn with the following properties i the cycle type of i is given by the partition ei for all i 1 r ii 1 r 1 iii the group generated by 1 r is a transitive subgroup of sn due to the natural correspondence of dessins and tuples of permutations the definition of local or quasi local changes for families of dessins has a natural analog for tuples of permutations this notion is closely related to an existing notion of stability in permutations definition 6 5 stability let fm a 1 am be the free group of m generators and r fm a finite set for r and elements x 1 xm of some group h denote by x 1 xm the image under the unique homomorphism fm h with ai 7 xi permutations p 1 pm sn are called a solution of r if p 1 pm 1 for all r they are called a solution of r if dh p 1 pm 1 for all r where dh denotes the normalized hamming distance in sn i e dh p q x 1 x n p x 6 q x n the system r is called stable in permutations if 0 0 n n for every solution p 1 pm sn to r there exists a solution p 1 p m sn to r such that dh pi p i for all i 1 m the group g fm r is called stable if r is stable as noted in 1 this definition is independent of the choice of the set r of relators for a group g the notion of stability can be viewed as a group theoretical analog of our notion of quasi local changes for dessins in the case of regular dessins of genus 1 the associated permutation tuples as in proposition 6 4 are of orders 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 4 4 or 2 3 6 one may then ask whether for a family of almost regular dessins the associated permutation tuples are close in the sense of definition 6 5 to some permutation tuples of the above orders therefore the groups we are interested in are the groups 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 4 4 and 2 3 6 where k 1 kr a 1 ar akii 1 for i 1 r the structure of these four groups is well known they all have a normal subgroup isomorphic to z 2 and with cyclic quotient group of order 2 3 4 and 6 in the respective cases in particular all these groups are polycyclic by finite and therefore residually finite and solvable and therefore amenable it follows that all these groups along with all their quotients are weakly stable in the sense of 1 def 7 1 see theorem 1 1 of that paper it is conjectured in that paper that a group all of whose quotients are weakly stable is in fact stable 1 conjecture 1 2 under this conjecture the above groups would indeed all be stable this would then imply that for any family of dessins of almost regular ramification type say close to a regular type k 1 k r it is possible to transform the corresponding permutation tuple into a tuple 1 r with ord i ki for all i 1 r with quasi local changes in the sense of definition 6 5 note however that this notion for permutation tuples is still slightly weaker than our notion of quasi local changes for families of dessins in particular the group 1 r need 22 joachim ko nig arielle leitner and danny neftin not be transitive and if it is transitive then the genus of the corresponding dessin need not be the same as the genus
