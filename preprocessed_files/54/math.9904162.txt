understand the inverse limit of copies of 0 1 with open bonding maps we prove that for any two knaster continua k 1 and k 2 there are 2 0 distinct homotopy types of maps of k 1 onto k 2 that map the endpoint of k 1 to the endpoint of k 2 1 introduction let r denote the set of real numbers and let i denote the interval 0 1 for any real number t let t denote the greatest integer less than or equal to t let v r i be defined by the formula v t t t if t is even t 1 t if t is odd for each positive integer n let gn i i be defined by the formula gn t v nt observe that gn stretches n times and then folds the resulting interval 0 n onto 0 1 the map g 2 is the very well known roof top map for any two positive integers m and n gm gn gmn consequently gn and gm commute see for example 8 proposition 2 2 let n n 1 n 2 be a sequence of integers 1 consider the inverse sequence i gn 1 i gn 2 i gn 3 i gn 4 by the knaster continuum associated with the sequence n we will understand the inverse limit of observe that the same knaster continuum can be associated with two different sequences for example the inverse limit does not change if we replace n by n 1 n 2 nj 1 nj 1 1 nj 2 however it should be noted here that there are 2 0 topologically distinct knaster continua 2 see also 14 for a knaster continuum k let e denote the endpoint 0 0 by i we will understand the projection of k onto the i th

associated with the sequence n we will understand the inverse limit of s 1 g n 1 s 1 g n 2 s 1 g n 3 s 1 g n 4 we will use e to denote 1 1 note that the same letter e is used here to denote different objects 0 0 in different knaster continua and 1 1 in different solenoids for instance if f is a map between two knaster continua k 1 and k 2 then the equality f e e means that f maps the endpoint 0 0 of k 1 to the endpoint 0 0 of k 2 knaster continua and solenoids are the simplest examples of indecomposable continua they appear naturally as attractors of dynamical systems see for ex ample 1 and 7 the goal of this paper is to study homotopy classes of maps between knaster continua it follows from 12 see also 4 and 10 that each map between two knaster continua is homotopic to a map induced from a commutative diagram hopotopy classes of maps between knaster continua coincide therefore with those of the induced map the easy examples of commutative diagrams could be constructed by using the commutativity of gn and gm we will first consider such examples let m m 1 m 2 be another sequence of positive integers suppose k 0 k 1 k 2 is the third sequence of positive integers such that ki 1 ni miki for each positive integer i then the following diagram commutes i gn 1 i gn 2 i gn 3 i gn 4 gk 0 y gk 1 y gk 2 y gk 3 y i gm 1 i gm 2 i gm 3 i gm 4 let k 1 and k 2 be knaster continua associated with the sequences n and m respectively observe that the diagram induces a continuous map f k 1 k 2 note that if x x 0 x 1 x 2 then f x gk 0 x 0 gk 1 x 1 gk 2 x 2 we will say that a map g k 1 k 2 is naturally induced if there are sequences j 0 j 1 j 2 and i 0 i 1 i 2 such that 0 j 0 j 1 j 2 and g x gi 0 xj 0 gi 1 xj 1 gi 2 xj 2 the map induced by the diagram is an example of a naturally induced map in the general case the vertical arrows in the diagram may be replaced by diagonal ones the following proposition is a simple consequence of the definition proposition 1 1 suppose k 1 and k 2 are knaster continua associated with the se quences n 1 n 2 and m 1 m 2 respectively let i 0 i 1 and j 0 j 1 be two sequences of non negative integers with j 0 j 1 j 2 let g k 1 k 2 be the naturally induced map defined by g x gi 0 xj 0 gi 1 xj 1 gi 2 xj 2 for each x x 0 x 1 x 2 k 1 then ik i 0 nj 0 1 nj 0 2 njk m 1 m 2 mk for each positive integer k homotopy classes of maps between knaster continua 3 corollary 1 2 suppose k 1 and k 2 are two knaster continua and 0 denote the projection of k 2 onto the 0 th factor in the inverse sequence defining k 2 let g and f be two naturally induced maps between of k 1 into k 2 such that 0 g 0 f then g f corollary 1 3 the set of naturally induced maps between two knaster continua is countable the notion of naturally induced maps may be introduced for solenoids suppose 1 and 2 are solenoids associated with the sequences n and m respectively we will say that a map g 1 2 is naturally induced if there are sequences j 0 j 1 j 2 and i 0 i 1 i 2 such that 0 j 0 j 1 j 2 and g x g i 0 xj 0 g i 1 xj 1 g i 2 xj 2 the statements corresponding to 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 are true for solenoids observe that any naturally induced map either between two knaster continua or between two solenoids maps e to e suppose f is a map with the property that f e e must f be homotopic to a naturally induced map in case of solenoids the answer is positive the following proposition follows from 13 5 and 6 see also 9 proposition 3 proposition 1 4 suppose f is a map of a solenoid 1 into a solenoid 2 such that that f e e then f is homotopic to a naturally induced map a similar statement for knaster continua would be false for instance any knaster continuum k 1 can be always mapped onto any knaster continuum k 2 see 11 on the other hand there is no naturally induced maps of k 1 of k 2 if the sequences defining k 1 and k 2 have different prime factors see proposition 1 1 it follows from proposition 1 4 that there is only countably many homotopy classes of maps between solenoids mapping e into e one could expect the corre sponding theorem for knaster continua since the mapping structure of solenoids is usually richer after all any solenoid can be mapped onto any knaster continuum but there is no continuous map of a chainable continuum onto a solenoid we will show however that in case of knaster continua there are uncountably many ho motopy types of maps mapping the endpoint of the domain onto the endpoint of the range more precisely we will prove the following theorem theorem 1 5 for any knaster continua k 1 and k 2 there are 2 0 distinct ho motopy types of maps f k 1 k 2 such that f e e it should be noted here that the maps in the above theorem cannot be replaced by homeomorphisms even in the case where k 1 k 2 it follows from 3 theorem 3 3 p 53 that there is only countably many homotopy types of homeomorphisms of any knaster continuum onto itself 2 constructing maps between knaster continua we will prove theorem 1 5 by defining 2 0 maps of k 1 onto k 2 induced by commutative diagrams we will construct the vertical arrows f 0 f 1 f 2 one by one we will start from f 0 equal to the identity on i we will then use lemma 2 1 repeatedly to define f 1 f 2 in many different ways the figure depicts the graphs of three maps f 1 such that f 0 g 7 g 3 f 1 similar maps will be used in lemma 2 1 4 piotr minc figure lemma 2 1 let m n and q be positive integers such that m 2 q n suppose f 0 is a map of i onto itself then for each i 0 1 q 1 there is a map f 1 i i such that 1 f 1 0 0 if f 0 0 0 2 f 0 gn gm f 1 3 f 1 0 i q 0 1 m 4 f 1 i q i 1 q i and 5 f 1 i 1 q 1 m 1 m 1 proof of 2 1 let k be the least non negative integer such that k n i q since m 2 q n it follows that k m 1 n i 1 q and consequently k n k m 1 n i q i 1 q let a b i be such that f 0 a 0 and f 0 b 1 since gn maps each of the intervals k j n k j 1 n onto i for each j 0 m there is a point tj k j n k j 1 n such that gn tj a if j is even and gn tj b if j is odd define f 1 by f 1 t 1 m f 0 gn t for 0 t t 1 j 1 f 0 gn t for an odd j 1 m 1 and tj t tj 1 j f 0 gn t for an even j 2 m 1 and tj t tj 1 m 1 f 0 gn t for tm t 1 if m is odd m f 0 gn t for tm t 1 if m is even one can verify that so defined f 1 has the required properties use the equality gm x v mx to verify 2 construction of ft let k 1 and k 2 be the knaster continua associated with sequences n 1 n 2 and m 1 m 2 respectively observe that k 1 does not change if the sequence n 1 n 2 is replaced by a sequence of products of finite blocks of consecutive elements of its elements so we may assume that mj 2 j

that conditions 1 5 follow from the corresponding conditions in the lemma let f t k 1 k 2 be the function induced by the sequence f t 0 f t 1 f t 2 the following proposition is a simple consequence of the construction proposition 2 2 for each t i f t is a continuous map of k 1 onto k 2 such that f t e e proposition 2 3 suppose t s i and t 6 s then f t is not homotopic to f s proof of 2 3 suppose f t is homotopic to f s for some t s i such that t s let h k 1 i k 2 be the homotopy between f t and f s consider the homotopy h 0 h k 1 i i where 0 denote the projection of k 2 onto the 0 th factor in the inverse sequence defining k 2 by compactness there is a sequence of numbers z 0 0 z 1 z 1 z 1 such that the set h x zk 1 zk does not contain i for each x k 1 and k 1 let j be an integer such that m 1 m 2 mj 1 and 3 j s t since 2 j nj there is an integer q such that i t j 1 j 2 q nj i t j 2 j by condition 5 of the construction of f t we have that i f tj 2 q nj mj 1 mj 1 since 3 j s t and t i t j j i t j 1 j we have that i t j 3 j s since s i s j j i s j 1 j it follows that i t j 2 j i s j j and consequently 2 q nj 0 i s j j by condition 3 of the construction of f s we have that ii f sj 2 q

k 1 onto the j th factor in the inverse sequence defining k 1 similarly let j denote the projection of k 2 onto the j th factor in the inverse sequence defining k 2 take a point y k 1 such that j y 2
