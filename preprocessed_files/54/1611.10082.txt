alan dow klaas pieter hart and jan van mill alan dow celebrated his 60 th birthday on the 5 th of december 2014 by flying to ithaca ny to undergo a conference in honour of that birthday this article is an attempt to present an overview of alan s many contributions to general and set theoretic topology 1 elementarity one of the many gifts from alan to set theoretic topology is the use of elementar ity for a while this was even known as dow s method of elementary submodels but alan would be was and still is the first to protest that the lo wenheim skolem theorem predates him by a few decades we have for the longest time been familiar with recursive constructions where often beforehand a sequence of situations sets is set up and during the construction witnesses to bad things will be eliminated or witnesses to good things will be em braced in the end we consider such a situation and realize that it was basically dealt with during the construction a very good example is the pol shapirovski proof of arhangel ski s theorem on the cardinality of compact first countable spaces what set theorists realised was that one can reduce the length of such proofs considerably by an application of the lo wenheim skolem theorem to a model of enough set theory its proof is the ultimate closing off argument where one deals with all possible situations in one go even ones that will never occur in your problem at hand but and this is where this method gets its power you will certainly have dealt with every eventuality related to your problem basically what is left is to perform what would have been the final step of your old recursive argument this requires some familiarity with first order logic and model theory so that you know how far you can go with your arguments but the time spent learning that will pay itself back handsomely in time saved later date 30 11 2016 11 22 10 cet 1991 mathematics subject classification 03 e 54 1 ar x iv 1 61 1 10 08 2 v 1 m at h g n 3 0 n ov 2 01 6 2 k p hart and j van mill a good place to start learning this is alan s first introduction 7 which has an elementary proof of arhangel ski s theorem that one should put next to the pol shapirovski argument to see difference between the standard and the elementarity mindset a later survey 14 gives more applications of the latter 2 remote points if x is completely regular then it is dense in x so every point of x lies close to x however some points lie closer to x than others one can formulate degrees of closeness by stipulating that the point belongs to the closure of a topologically small subset of x thus for example p x is near if p cl d for some closed and discrete subset of x other variants can be obtained by using relatively discrete subsets scattered subsets and nowhere dense sets the negation of the last notion has proved to be very fruitful call p x a remote point of x if p cl a for all nowhere dense subsets of x remote points were introduced by fine and gillman in 1962 who proved that the continuum hypothesis abbreviated ch implies that the real line r has a remote point actually their proof applies to every separable and non pseudocompact space around 1980 van douwen and independently chae and smith proved in zfc that every non pseudocompact space with countable weight has remote points that there are spaces without remote points was demonstrated by van douwen and van mill in 1982 alan took over the research on remote points completely leaving absolutely nothing for his competitors see 1 3 5 6 8 20 28 36 he became the world s expert on remote points he substantially improved the results of van douwen and chae and smith by showing that every non pseudocompact ccc space of weight at most 1 has a remote point and that under ch the bound 1 is not optimal the fruits of remote points are manifold the points themselves were used in honest proofs of non homogeneity of certain c ech stone remainders for example q is extremally disconnected at each remote point but not at other points the techniques developed and used for their construction have found many applications too alan s proof that 2 has remote points gave new insight in the structure of the partial order that adds cohen reals a remote point seen as a clopen filter on 2 takes big bites out of dense open sets and these bites combine to form approximations of generic filters called endowments by some these endowments were crucial in a cohen real proof of the consistency of the normal moore space conjecture 10 11 we must also mention that alan showed that the result of fine and gillman needs extra assumptions in the side by side sacks model there is a non pseudocompact separable space without remote points 8 3 n and r the c ech stone compactification n of the discrete space of natural numbers n is alan s favorite space just like the space of rational numbers q was eric van douwen s favorite space alan s work concentrates on the construction of spe cial ultrafilters on n such as weak p points cozero accessible points bow tie points certain finite to one maps defined on n or n n n and closed subsets of n although alan can be thought of as a set theorist his thinking is topological he is interested in those set theoretical aspects of n that shed light on topological questions he demonstrated his n talents already quite early in his career in 13 he gave an overview of certain aspects of n that is still valuable today his proof presented there that there are 2 c rudin keisler incomparable ultrafilters on n is the best one around alan dow 3 the space n contains many copies of itself if d is any countable discrete subset of n then its closure is a topological copy of n hence the space n contains many topological copies of itself as well this prompted eric van douwen to ask whether there is a copy of n in n that is not of the form cld d for some countable discrete subset d of n such a copy of n is called nontrivial under various assumptions nontrivial copies of n exist but what about such copies in zfc this longstanding open problem which was thought to be beyond reach by experts was solved in the affirmative by alan in 34 in 17 he showed with hart that the open coloring axiom implies that the stone space of the measure algebra is not a continuous image of n which contra dicts an earlier result of frankiewicz and gutek alan s work related to van douwen spaces 22 24 26 gives answers to very natural problems on spaces that are con tinuous images of n or n under finite to one mappings one of alan s favourite results about n is the existence of a tree base for n so naturally he would investigate the possible structure of these 9 as well as employ them in the study of the absolute of n 4 16 the latter paper ties in with another c ech stone compactification that has been the beneficiary of alan s interest r as with n it is mostly r or rather one of its halves h whose structure we would like to clear up h 0 one thing to do is look for parallels between n and h take a known result on n and reformulate it to take into account that h is a continuum sometimes this works as in 18 there is a complete parallel version of parovic enko s theorem every continuum of weight 1 or less is a continuous image of h and thus under ch the continua of weight c or less are exactly the continuous images of h the parallel also extends in the negative direction many examples of non images of n have a connected counterpart sometimes the parallel breaks down every separable compact space is clearly a continuous image of n but there is a separable continuum that consistenly is not a continuous image of h see 27 one parallel is still unresolved is every perfectly normal continuum a continuous image of h for the longest time we knew of only a few i e finitely many distinct subcon tinua of h just recently that number was raised to the maximum possible 2 c if ch does not hold then this follows from results on ultrapowers of linear orders 30 the construction of such a family in case ch does hold is more involved 35 4 convergence another recurring theme in alan s work is that of convergence in particular as related to the closure operation we all know that in a first countable space a point belongs to the closure of a set if and only if there is a sequence in that set that converges to the point if one puts universal quantifiers in front of point and set then one obtains the definition of fre chet urysohn spaces if one allows for well ordered sequences of arbitrary length then one defines radial spaces a weakening of the fre chet urysohn property sequentiality states that a set is closed iff it contains all limits of converging sequences whose terms belong to the set allowing for well ordered sequences of arbitrary length will define pseudo radial spaces finally a space is countably tight or has countable tightness if cla clb b a 0 holds for every subset a of the space the question whether compact spaces of countable tightness are sequential is known as the moore mro wka problem after balogh showed that pfa implies a yes answer alan established its outright consistency and more 12 later he showed that it is even consistent that compact spaces of countable tightness and weight 1 are fre chet urysohn 15 4 k p hart and j van mill the sequential closure clsa of a set a in a topological space is equal to the set of limits of all converging sequences with terms in a constant sequences ensure a clsa in a frechet urysohn space we have cla clsa for all subsets in a sequential space one obtains cla after iterating cls at most 1 many times the sequential order of a space is the minimum ordinal such that all closures are reached in at most steps under ch there are compact sequential spaces of all possible sequential orders without ch much less is known in 21 alan constructed an example from b c of compact space of scattered height and sequential order 5 and later he showed under pfa that the known constructions would not yield spaces of order higher than 31 efimov s problem may also be put under the heading of convergence it asks whether every compact hausdorff space contains a non trivial converging sequence of a copy of n fedorchuk s compact s space from is a particularly strong counterexample hereditarily separable and without converging sequences the consistency of a positive answer seems to be getting a more and more remote possibility not least because of examples that alan co constructed there is one if cf s 0 s and 2 s 2 c hold 23 and also one if b c 32 with shelah the latter example helps settle another problem on convergence does every com pact hausdorff space contain a converging sequence or a converging 1 sequence hus ek as n contains a sequence of the latter type this question can be seen as a weakening of efimov s problem that it really is a weakening follows from results in 33 in various models including the standard model for b c compact spaces without converging 1 sequences are first countable 5 mad families a look at some of the papers cited above will show that one of alan s tools of choice is a maximal almost disjoint mad family they are also objects of study in their own right a family a of countably infinite subsets of a set x is almost disjoint if any two distinct elements have a finite intersection and a mad family is maximal among such families with respect to inclusion one topologizes x a by making the points of x isolated and by letting the basic neighbourhoods of a a be the sets of the form a a f where f is finite the resulting space denoted x a can have many striking properties alan s interest has been in the c ech stone remainders of such spaces especially in the case a is maximal and x n mro wka showed that this remainder can be a singleton and alan and jerry vaughan investigated what happens for uncountable x in 29 one of the results that gave alan great satisfaction deals with representable algebras or their duals representable spaces these are the zero dimensional compact spaces that can occur as n a for some mad family a baumgartner and weese initiated the study of these and proved that as one is wont to expect all is well under the assumption of ch one gets the compact zero dimensional spaces of weight c or less in 19 in a veritable tour de force alan and his student jinyuan zhou presented a consistent example of a mad family d with two points a and b in n d such that the quotient of the remainder obtained by identifying just the points a and b is not of the form n a for any mad family a references 1 alan dow some separable spaces and remote points canad j math 34 1982 no 6 1378 1389 doi 10 4153 cjm 1982 096 6 mr 678677 84 b 54010 2 remote points in large products
