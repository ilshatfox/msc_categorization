that every fixed point theorem on g metric respectively partial metric spaces implies a fixed point result on partial metric respec tively gp metric spaces our results generalized and unify several fixed point theorems in the context of partial metric spaces and gp metric spaces in the literature 1 introduction and basic observations matthews a computer scientists who is an expert on semantics introduced the notion of partial metric spaces in 1992 21 then this concept was studied by many authors for example see 1 3 4 5 7 9 16 20 24 let x be a non empty set a partial metric is a function p x x 0 such that p 1 x y if and only if p x x p x y p y y for all x y x p 2 p x x p x y for all x y x small self distances p 3 p x y p y x for all x y x symmetry p 4 p x z p x y p y z p y y for all x y z x triangularity the pair x p is called a partial metric space also each partial metric p on x generates a t 0 topology p on x with a base of the family of open p balls bp x x x 0 where bp x y x p x y p x x 7 21 22 if p is a partial metric on x then ps x x 0 defined by ps x y 2 p x y p x x p y y is a metric on x let x p be a partial metric space a sequence xn n 1 in x converges to x x if limn p xn x p x x 21 also xn n 1 is called a cauchy sequence whenever limn m p xn xm exists and is finite a partial metric space x p is said to be complete whenever every cauchy sequence xn n 1 in x converges to a point x x with respect to p that is limn m p xn xm p x x lemma 1 1 see 22 let x p be a partial metric space then 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 54 e 35 54 e 99 secondary 54 h 25

sequence in x p if and only if xn n 1 is a cauchy sequence in the metric space x ps 2 x p is complete if and only if the metric space x ps is complete 2 remarks on g metric spaces and fixed points theorems mustafa and sims 23 introduced a new structure of generalized metric spaces which are called g metric spaces to develop and introduce a new fixed point theory for various mappings in this new structure in this section a new connection between partial metric and g metric spaces are established and then we show that any fixed point theorem on g metric spaces implies a fixed point result on partial metric spaces first we recall some definitions of g metric spaces and some properties of theirs let x be a non empty set and g x x x 0 be a function satisfying the following conditions g 1 if x y z then g x y z 0 g 2 g x x y 0 for all x y x with x 6 y g 3 g x x y g x y z for all x y z x with z 6 y g 4 g x y z g p x z y where p is a permutation of x y z x symmetry in all three variables g 5 g x y z g x a a g a y z for all x y z a x rectangle inequality then the function g is called a g metric on x and the pair x g is called a g metric space let xn n 1 be a sequence in x xn n 1 is called a g convergent sequence to x x if for any 0 there is k n such that for all n m k g x xn xm 23 xn n 1 is a g cauchy sequence if for any 0 there is k n such that for all n m l k g xn xm xl 23 x g is said to be g complete if every g cauchy sequence in x is g convergent in x 23 proposition 2 1 see 23 let x g be a g metric space and let xn n 1 be a sequence in x then the following are equivalent 1 the sequence xn n 1 is g cauchy 2 g xn xm xm 0 as n m definition 2 2 see 23 a g metric space x g is said to be symmetric if g x y y g y x x for all x y x 2 1 remarks on gp metric and partial metric spaces and fixed points results 3 example 1 let x s be the set of sequences over a non empty set s the function g x x x 0 defined by g x y z max 2 sup i i j i xj yj 2 sup i i j i yj zj 2 sup i i j i xj zj for all x y z x is a g metric on x such that x g is symmetric we note that g is a generalization of the well known baire metric see 15 22 for more details example 2 see 2 let x 0 and g x y z max x y max x z max y z x y z for all x y z x 2 2 then x g is a g metric space and it is symmetric example 2 leads us to the following result proposition 2 3 let x p be a partial metric space and gp x y z p x y p y z p x z p x x p y y p z z for all x y z x 2 3 then x gp is a g metric space which is symmetric proof the arguments are straightforward as an illustration we prove g 2 if gp x y y 0 then gp x y y p s x y 2 p x y p x x p y y 0 thus x y since x ps is a metric space lemma 2 4 let x p be a partial metric space then the following statements hold a a sequence xn n 1 in x p is cauchy if and only if it is g cauchy in its associated g metric space x gp b x p is complete if and only if its associated g metric space x gp is g complete moreover limn m gp x xn xm 0 p x x limn m p xn xm limn p xn xn limn p x xn proof a let xn n 1 be a cauchy sequence in x p then by propositions 2 1 and 2 3 it is easily seen that xn n 1 is a g cauchy sequence in the g metric space x gp conversely suppose that xn n 1 is a g cauchy sequence in x gp and 0 is given then there exists n 0 n such that 1 4 gp xm xm xn for all n m n 0 and so gp xn xn xn 0 p xn 0 xn 0 2 p xn xn 0 p xn xn p xn xn by p 2 consequently the sequence p xn xn is bounded in r and so there exists a real number say a such that a subsequence p xnk xnk is convergent to a i e 4 m r ahmadi zand and h golvardi yazdy limk p xnk xnk a first we claim that p xn xn is a cauchy sequence in r if n m n 0 then gp xm xm xn 2 p xm xn p xm xm p xn xn p xm xm p xn xn by p 2 which implies that p xn xn p xm xm gp xm xm xn gp xn xn xm thus p xn xn p xm xm 2 for all n m n 0 and so limn p xn xn a thus for any 0 there exists n such that p xk xk a and gp xn xm xm for all k n and so 2 p xn xm a gp xn xm xm p xm xm p xn xn 2 a gp xn xm xm p xm xm a p xn xn a 3 for all n m n hence limn m p xn xm a and so xn n 1 is a cauchy sequence in x p b every g metric space x g which is symmetric induces a metric dg on x given by dg x y g x y y for all x y x moreover x g is g complete if and only if x dg is complete it is easily seen that dgp x y p s x y for all x y x by lemma 1 1 x p is complete if and only if the metric space x ps is complete and so the g metric space x gp is g complete if and only if x p is complete by the equality 2 3 and p 2 limn m gp x xn xm 0 if and only if p x x limn p x xn limn m p xn xm p xn xn and limm p x xm p xm xm and these are equivalent to p x x limn m p xn xm limn p xn xn limn p x xn remark 1 haghi et al 12 13 showed that some of fixed point theorems in partial metric spaces can be obtained from metric spaces from proposition 2 3 and lemma 2 4 it follows that some new fixed point results on partial metric spaces are immediate consequences of the existing fixed point theorems on g metric spaces and so they are not real generalizations as a model example we consider the following result of karapinar and agarwal 18 remarks on gp metric and partial metric spaces and fixed points results 5 theorem 2 5 see 18 let x g be a g metric space if x g is g complete and t x x is a mapping satisfying g tx t 2 x t y g x tx y g x tx y for all x y x 2 4 where 0 0 is a continuous mapping with 1 0 0 then t has a unique fixed point we show that the following fixed point theorem on partial metric spaces is obtained by the above results theorem 2 6 let x p be a complete partial metric space if t x x is a mapping and the following condition holds then t has a unique fixed point p tx t 2 x p tx t y p t 2 x t y p t 2 x t 2 x p ty t y p x tx p x y p tx y p x x p y y p x tx p x y p tx y p x x p y y p tx tx for all x y x where 0 0 is a continuous mapping with 1 0 0 proof let x gp be the g metric space defined in proposition 2 3 since x p is com plete then by lemma 2 4 x gp is g complete therefore t has a unique fixed point since all conditions of theorem 2 5 hold for the g metric space x gp 3 remarks on gp metric spaces and fixed points theorems zand and nezhad 1 recently introduced gp metric spaces which are a generalization of the notions of partial metric spaces and g metric spaces which are symmetric in this section we show that every fixed point theorem on a partial metric space implies a fixed point result on its associated gp metric space following zand and nezhad 1 the notion of gp metric space is given as follows let x be a non empty set and gp x x x 0 be a function satisfying the following conditions gp 1 0 gp x x x gp x x y gp x y z for all x y z x gp 2 gp x y z gp p x z y where p is a permutation of x y z x symmetry in all three variables gp 3 gp x y z gp x a a gp a y z gp a a a for all x y z a x rectangle inequality gp 4 x y z if gp x y z gp x x x gp y y y gp z z z for all x y z x 6 m r ahmadi zand and h golvardi yazdy then the function gp is called a gp metric on x and the pair x gp is called a gp metric space by gp 1 and gp 2 every gp metric space x gp is symmetric that is gp x y y gp y x x for all x y x 3 1 an open ball for x gp is a set of the form gp x 0 y x gp x 0 y y gp x 0 x 0 x 0 for each x x and 0 also these open balls form a base for a topology gp on x let x gp and y gp 1 be two gp metric spaces a function f x gp y gp 1 is said to be gp continuous if for any 0 and x 0 x there exists 0 such that f gp x 0 gp 1 f x 0 1 lemma 3 1 see 5 let x gp be a gp metric space then gp x x y 0 for all x y x with x 6 y definition 3 2 see 1 let x gp be a gp metric space and let xn n 1 be a sequence in x i xn n 1 is called a gp cauchy sequence if limn m gp xn xm xm exists and finite ii x gp is said to be gp complete if every gp cauchy sequence yn n 1 converges to a point x x such that gp x x x limn m gp yn ym ym lemma 3 3 see 1 let x gp be a gp metric space and xn n 1 gp convergent se quence to x x then xn n 1 is a gp cauchy sequence and limn m gp x xn xm gp x x x we will use the following definition of a gp convergent sequence in a gp metric space definition 3 4 see 2 a sequence xn n 1 in a gp metric space x gp is called a gp convergent sequence to x x if gp x x x limn gp xn xn xn limn gp x x xn the following theorem is needed in this paper theorem 3 5 2 let x gp be a gp metric space then the function gp x y z is jointly continuous in all three of its variables the proof of the following result is straightforward remarks on gp metric and partial metric spaces and fixed points results 7 proposition 3 6 every gp metric space x gp defines a partial metric space x pgp where pgp x y gp x y y for all x y x 3 2 the following result is a direct consequence of proposition 3 6 and the above definitions corollary 3 7 1 a sequence xn n 1 is a gp cauchy sequence in a gp metric space x gp if and only if it is a cauchy sequence in its associated partial metric space x pgp 2 a gp metric space x gp is gp complete if and only if its associated partial metric space x pgp is complete by propositions 2 3 and 3 6 we have the following result theorem 3 8 every gp metric space x gp defines a g metric space x ggp which is symmetric where ggp x y z gp x y y gp x z z gp y z z gp x x x gp y y y gp z z z for all x y z x corollary 3 9 let x gp be a gp metric space and let x ggp be its associated g metric space then the following conditions hold 1 a sequence is gp cauchy in x gp if and only if it is a g cauchy sequence in x ggp 2 x gp is gp complete if and only if x ggp is g complete moreover limn m ggp x xn xm 0 gp x x x limn gp x xn xn limn m gp xn xm xm limn gp xn xn xn remark 2 from proposition 3 6 and corollary 3 7 it follows that a fixed point theorem on partial metric spaces implies a fixed point theorem on gp metric spaces and so by theorem 3 8 and corollary 3 9 from every fixed point theorem on g metric spaces a fixed point result on gp metric spaces can be obtained for instance let x p be a complete partial metric space x 0 be a lower semi continuous function and t a self mapping onx such that p x tx x tx for all x x in 2011 karapinar proved that the self mapping t called a caristi map on x p has a fixed point 17 thus by the karapinar result the following fixed point theorem on gp metric spaces can be obtained 8 m r ahmadi zand and h golvardi yazdy theorem 3 10 let x gp be a gp metric space x 0 be a lower semi continuous function and t a self mapping on x such that gp x tx tx x tx for all x x if x gp is gp complete then the self mapping t has a fixed point proof by proposition 3 6 and corollary 3 7 x pgp is a complete partial metric space where pgp x y gp x y y for all x y x 3 3 thus by hypothesis pgp x tx x tx for all x x the karapinar result mentioned above completes the proof finally we present a new fixed point theorem on gp metric spaces such that this theorem can not be obtained from the well known fixed point results by the above techniques we will start with the following definition definition 3 11 let x gp be a gp metric space and let x x 0 be a map if t x gp x gp is a gp continuous function and xn is a gp convergent sequence to x x such that the following implication holds limn m gp xn xm t xm gp x x x x tx limm inf xm t xm supn 1 infm n xm t xm then the function is called a t lower semi continuous t l s c on x x moreover if for all x x the following inequality holds gp x tx t 2 x x tx tx t 2 x 3 4 then t is called a caristi map on x gp now we give a generalization of theorem 3 10 theorem 3 12 let x x 0 t x x be two maps and let x gp be a gp metric space which is gp complete if is a t l s c function on x x and t is a caristi map on x gp then t has a fixed point in x proof for x in x let a x and a x denote the following sets a x z x gp x z t z x tx z t z 3 5 a x inf z t z z a x 3 6 remarks on gp metric and partial metric spaces and fixed points results 9 by 3 4 tx a x and so a x 6 z a x implies that 0 x z t z x tx a sequence xn n 1 can be constructed in the following way x 1 x xn 1 a xn such that xn 1 t xn 1 a xn 1 n n n 3 7 for every n n one can easily observe that gp xn xn 1 t xn 1 xn t xn xn 1 t xn 1 3 8 a xn xn 1 t xn 1 a xn 1 n and so xn t xn is a decreasing sequence of non negative real numbers thus the se quence xn t xn is convergent to a real number l and so by 3 8 we have l limn xn t xn limn a xn 3 9 by 3 9 for each k n there exists nk n such that xn t xn l 1 k for all n nk 3 10 since xn t xn is a decreasing sequence we have l xm t xm xn t xn l 1 k for all m n nk and so xn t xn xm t xm 1 k for all m n nk 3 11 by gp 3 gp 1 and 3 8 the following inequalities hold gp xn xn 2 t xn 2 gp xn xn 1 xn 1 gp xn 1 xn 2 t xn 2 gp xn 1 xn 1 xn 1 gp xn xn 1 t xn 1 gp xn 1 xn 2 t xn 2 xn t xn xn 1 t xn 1 xn 1 t xn 1 xn 2 t xn 2 xn t xn xn 2 t xn 2 similar to the above calculations we have the following inequalities gp xn xn 3 t xn 3 gp xn xn 2 xn 2 gp xn 2 xn 3 t xn 3 gp xn 2 xn 2 xn 2 gp xn xn 2 t xn 2 gp xn 2 xn 3 t xn 3 xn t xn xn 2 t xn 2 xn 2 t xn 2 xn 3 t xn 3 xn t xn xn 3 t xn 3 10 m r ahmadi zand and h golvardi yazdy by a simple induction the following inequality holds gp xn xm t xm xn t xn xm t xm for all m n 3 12 by theorem 3 8 and gp 1 we have ggp xn xm xm 2 gp xn xm xm 2 gp xn xm t xm 3 13 since the sequence xn t xn is convergent the right hand side of 3 12 tends to zero and so gp xn xm t xm tends to zero as n m thus by 3 13 xn n 1 is g cauchy in the g metric space x ggp since x gp is gp complete then by corollary 3 9 its associated g metric space x ggp is g complete thus there is z 0 x such that the sequence xn n 1 is g convergent to z 0 x and so by corollary 3 9 gp z 0 z 0 z 0 limn gp z 0 xn xn limn m gp xn xm xm limn m gp xn xm t xm 0 3 14 thus xn n 1 is gp convergent to z 0 and gp z 0 z 0 z 0 limn m gp xn xm t xm and so by 3 9 z 0 t z 0 limm inf xm t xm l since is t l s c therefore the inequality 3 12 and theorem 3 5 imply that z 0 t z 0 limm inf xm t xm limm inf xn t xn gp xn xm t xm xn t xn gp xn z 0 t z 0 3 15 therefore 3 5 implies that z 0 a xn for all n n and so by 3 9 l limn a xn z 0 t z 0 thus l z 0 t z 0 by gp 3 gp 1 and 3 12 the following inequalities hold 0 gp xn t z 0 t 2 z 0 gp xn z 0 z 0 gp z 0 t z 0 t 2 z 0 gp z 0 z 0 z 0 gp xn z 0 t z 0 gp z 0 t z 0 t 2 z 0 xn t xn z 0 t z 0 z 0 t z 0 tz 0 t 2 z 0 xn t xn tz 0 t 2 z 0 3 16 clearly tz 0 t 2 z 0 xn t xn for all n n and so tz 0 t 2 z 0 l by 3 9 by 3 5 and 3 16 tz 0 a xn for all n n which implies that a xn tz 0 t 2 z 0 for all n n and so l tz 0 t 2 z 0 by 3 9 hence z 0 t z 0 l tz 0 t 2 z 0 since t is a caristi map on x gp we have gp z 0 t z 0 t 2 z 0 0 regarding lemma 3 3 tz 0 t 2 z 0 z 0 which completes the proof remarks on gp metric and partial metric spaces and fixed points results 11 example 3 let x 0 and gp x y z max x y z then x gp is a gp metric space 1 suppose t x x such that tx x 2 for all x x and t s x x 0 such that t s 2 t s then gp x tx t 2 x max x x 2 x 4 x and x tx tx t 2 x 3 x 2 therefore by theorem 3 12 t has a fixed point notice that x 0 is the fixed point of t references 1 m r ahmadi zand a dehghan nezhad a generalization of partial metric spaces j contemp appl math vol 1 2011 86 93 2 m r ahmadi zand h
