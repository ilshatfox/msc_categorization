category of compact hausdorff spaces is dually equiv alent to the category of de vries algebras in our recent article we have extended de vries duality to completely regular spaces by generalizing de vries algebras to de vries extensions to illustrate the utility of this point of view we show how to use this new duality to obtain algebraic counterparts of normal and locally compact hausdorff spaces in the form of de vries extensions that are subject to additional axioms which encode the desired topological property this in particular yields a different perspective on de vries duality as a further application we show that a duality for locally compact hausdorff spaces due to dimov can be obtained from our approach 1 introduction it is a well known theorem of smirnov that compactifications of a completely regular space x can be described internally by means of proximities on x compatible with the topology on x see e g 9 sec 7 where a proximity is a binary relation on the powerset of x satisfying certain natural axioms including a point separation axiom see e g 9 sec 3 de vries takes this further in 2 by axiomatizing the proximities on the complete boolean algebra of regular open subsets of x that correspond to compactifications of x in de vries work the point separation axiom is replaced by the point free axiom asserting that the proximity relation is approximating this point free axiom decouples the proximity from the underlying space and yields what is known today as a de vries algebra a complete boolean algebra with a binary relation satisfying all of the axioms of a proximity except the point separation axiom which is replaced by de vries point free axiom de vries showed that this axiomatization can be used to give an algebraic description of the category khaus of compact hausdorff spaces more formally the category khaus is dually equivalent to the category dev of de vries algebras in 1 we extended de vries duality to completely regular spaces by generalizing the notion of a de vries algebra to that of a de vries extension while de vries duality alone is not enough to deal with completely regular spaces and de vries extensions we show in 1 that de vries duality together with tarski duality for complete and atomic boolean algebras provides an appropriate framework for dealing with completely regular spaces in fact the methods

1804 04303 v 1 2 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding in 1 yield a dual equivalence between the category of de vries extensions and the category of compactifications of completely regular spaces that extends both de vries duality and tarski duality the de vries extensions corresponding to stone c ech compactifications are axiomatized in 1 as maximal de vries extensions this in turn yields a dual equivalence between the category of completely regular spaces and the category of maximal de vries extensions thereby providing an algebraic counterpart to completely regular spaces it is noted in 1 that discrete spaces can be viewed algebraically as trivial de vries ex tensions the interpretation of more interesting classes of completely regular spaces is not as straightforward in this article we continue our work begun in 1 by giving algebraic interpretations of normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces within our framework of de vries extensions on a technical level this involves for a compactification e x y of a completely regular space x a close analysis of the corresponding de vries extension e 1 ro y x where ro y is the complete boolean algebra of regular open sets of y and x is the powerset of x some of the main results of the current paper involve determining which algebraic properties of the map e 1 reflect the normality and local compactness of x with these characterizations we obtain dual equivalences between the categories of such spaces and the appropriate full subcategories of the category of de vries extensions the article is organized as follows in section 2 we recall all the necessary background about de vries algebras de vries extensions and maximal de vries extensions in section 3 we introduce normal de vries extensions and show that every normal de vries extension is maximal this allows us to view normal de vries extensions as a full subcategory ndeve of the category mdeve of maximal de vries extensions we prove that ndeve is dually equivalent to the category norm of normal spaces in section 4 we introduce locally compact de vries extensions while not every locally compact de vries extension is maximal we prove that lkhaus is dually equivalent to the full subcategory ldeve of mdeve consisting of locally compact de vries extensions in section 5 we introduce compact de vries extensions since every compact de vries extension is maximal we view compact de vries extensions as a full subcategory cdeve of mdeve we prove that cdeve is equivalent to dev and hence dually equivalent to khaus this gives another perspective on de vries duality in section 6 we introduce minimal de vries extensions and show that non compact minimal de vries extensions correspond to one point compactifications of non compact locally compact hausdorff spaces while we do not make use of it directly we are motivated in our treatment of local com pactness by leader s generalization in 7 of a proximity relation to that of a local proximity relation a generalization that yields a description of the local compactifications of a com pletely regular space by means of local proximity relations compatible with the topology recently dimov 3 has recast leader s work in a setting similar to de vries algebras and obtained a duality theorem for the category lkhaus of locally compact hausdorff spaces de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 3 that generalizes de vries duality in section 7 we show that dimov s duality for lkhaus can be derived as a consequence of our duality for lkhaus 2 de vries extensions in this preliminary section we recall de vries algebras de vries extensions and maximal de vries extensions by de vries duality 2 de vries algebras provide an algebraic counterpart of compact hausdorff spaces by the duality developed in 1 de vries extensions provide an algebraic counterpart of compactifications of completely regular spaces under this duality maximal de vries extensions correspond to stone c ech compactifications thus yielding a duality for completely regular spaces that generalizes de vries duality for compact hausdorff spaces 2 1 de vries algebras and compact hausdorff spaces we start by recalling de vries algebras and de vries morphisms definition 2 1 1 a de vries algebra is a pair a a where a is a complete boolean algebra and is a binary relation on a satisfying the following axioms dv 1 1 1 dv 2 a b implies a b dv 3 a b c d implies a d dv 4 a b c implies a b c dv 5 a b implies b a dv 6 a b implies there is c such that a c b dv 7 b a a a b 2 a de vries morphism is a map a b between de vries algebras satisfying the following axioms m 1 0 0 m 2 a b a b m 3 a b implies a b m 4 b a a b de vries algebras and de vries morphisms form a category dev where the composition of two de vries morphisms 1 a 1 a 2 and 2 a 2 a 3 is defined by 2 1 b 2 1 a a b de vries algebras arise naturally from compact hausdorff spaces if x is a compact hausdorff space then the pair x ro x is a de vries algebra where ro x is the complete boolean algebra of regular open subsets of x and is the canonical proximity relation on ro x given by u v iff cl u v 4 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding similarly de vries morphisms arise naturally from continuous maps between compact haus dorff spaces if f x y is such a map then f ro y ro x is a de vries morphism where f is given by f u int cl f 1 u this defines a contravariant functor khaus dev to define a contravariant functor dev khaus let a be a de vries algebra for s a let s a a b a for some b s and s a a a b for some b s a filter f of a is round if f f similarly an ideal i of a is round if i i an end of a is a maximal proper round filter let ya be the set of ends of a for a a set a a x ya a x and define a topology on ya by letting a a a a a a be a basis for the topology then ya is compact hausdorff and we set a ya for a de vries morphism a a define ya ya by y 1 y then is a well defined continuous map yielding a contravariant functor dev khaus we have that a a a is a de vries isomorphism and x x x is a homeomorphism where x u x x u therefore 1 dev and 1 khaus are natural isomorphisms thus we arrive at de vries duality theorem 2 2 de vries 2 khaus is dually equivalent to dev 2 2 de vries extensions and compactifications we next generalize de vries algebras to de vries extensions 1 for this we will utilize tarski duality between the category caba of complete and atomic boolean algebras with complete boolean homomorphisms and the category set of sets and functions if x is a set then x is a complete and atomic boolean algebra and if f x y is a function then f 1 y x is a complete boolean homomorphism this yields a contravariant functor set caba going backwards for a complete and atomic boolean algebra b let xb be the set of atoms of b and for a complete boolean homomorphism b 1 b 2 let xb 2 xb 1 be given by x b b 1 x b it is well known that is a well defined function yielding a contravariant functor caba set for each set x we have a natural isomorphism x x x x given by x x x for each x x and for each b caba we have a natural isomorphism b b xb given by b b x xb x b definition 2 3 1 a de vries algebra a a is extremally disconnected if a b iff a b de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 5 2 a de vries algebra a a is atomic if a is atomic as a boolean algebra 3 a de vries extension is a 1 1 de vries morphism a b such that a is a de vries algebra b is an atomic extremally disconnected de vries algebra and a is join meet dense 1 in b a morphism between de vries extensions a b and a b is a pair where a a is a de vries morphism b b is a complete boolean homomorphism and a b a b since is a complete boolean homomorphism and b b are extremally disconnected is a de vries morphism and hence if is a morphism in deve then the diagram above commutes in dev see 1 rems 2 6 4 10 the composition of two morphisms 1 1 and 2 2 is defined as 2 1 2 1 a 1 2 1 1 1 b 1 1 2 1 a 2 2 2 b 2 2 a 3 3 b 3 it is straightforward to see that de vries extensions with morphisms between them form a category which we denote deve de vries extensions arise naturally from compactifications of completely regular spaces let e x y be a compactification of a completely regular space x then ro y is a de vries algebra the powerset x is an atomic extremally disconnected de vries algebra and the pullback map e 1 ro y x is a de vries extension let comp be the category whose objects are compactifications e x y and whose morphisms are pairs f g of continuous maps such that the following diagram commutes x e f y g x e y 1 that is each element of b is a join of meets of elements of a this is equivalent to each element of b being a meet of joins of elements of a see 1 rem 4 7 6 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding the composition of two morphisms f 1 g 1 and f 2 g 2 in comp is f 2 f 1 g 2 g 1 x 1 e 1 f 2 f 1 f 1 y 1 g 1 g 2 g 1 x 2 e 2 f 2 y 2 g 2 x 3 e 3 y 3 for a morphism f g in comp the pair g f 1 is a morphism in deve where g is the de vries dual of g ro y g e 1 x f 1 ro y e 1 x this yields a contravariant functor e comp deve to define a contravariant functor c deve comp let a b be a de vries extension let xb be the set of atoms of b for b xb we have b is an ultrafilter of b and we define xb ya by b 1 b we can view xb as a subset of yb by sending b to b then we can think of as the restriction to xb of the de vries dual yb ya by 1 lem 5 4 is 1 1 let be the least topology on xb making continuous by 1 thm 5 7 xb a is a compactification for a morphism in deve a b a b the pair is a morphism in comp xb ya xb ya where is the de vries dual of and is the tarski dual of this yields a contravariant functor c deve comp and the functors e and c establish a dual equivalence between comp and deve theorem 2 4 1 thm 5 9 comp is dually equivalent to deve de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 7 2 3 maximal de vries extensions stone c ech compactifications and completely regular spaces we next turn to maximal de vries extensions definition 2 5 1 we call two de vries extensions a b and c b compatible if a c 2 we say that a de vries extension a b is maximal provided for every compatible de vries extension c b there is a de vries morphism c a such that a b c 3 let mdeve be the full subcategory of deve consisting of maximal de vries extensions remark 2 6 let a b and c b be compatible de vries extensions since and are 1 1 with the same image we have a bijection 1 c a with inverse 1 a c because and are both 1 1 and meet preserving they are both order preserving and order reflecting so and its inverse are poset isomorphisms hence boolean isomorphisms theorem 2 7 1 thm 6 4 if e x y is a compactification then the associated de vries extension e 1 ro y x is maximal iff e x y is isomorphic in comp to the stone c ech compactification s x x remark 2 8 equivalent compactifications e x y and e x y are isomorphic in comp but the converse is not true in general 1 ex 3 2 however if e is the stone c ech compactification ofx then e is equivalent to e iff e is isomorphic to e in comp 1 thm 3 3 let creg be the category of completely regular spaces and continuous maps sending a completely regular space x to its stone c ech compactification s x x yields an equivalence between creg and the full subcategory of comp consisting of stone c ech com pactifications since stone c ech compactifications dually correspond to maximal de vries extensions we arrive at the following duality theorem which generalizes de vries duality to completely regular spaces theorem 2 9 1 thm 6 9 creg is dually equivalent to mdeve 2 4 additional properties of de vries algebras and de vries extensions we con clude this preliminary section by recalling some basic facts about de vries algebras and de vries extensions that we will use subsequently we start with de vries algebras lemma 2 10 let a be a de vries algebra and ya its dual compact hausdorff space 1 there is an isomorphism between the lattice of round filters of a ordered by reverse inclusion and the lattice of round ideals ordered by inclusion given by f a a a f for a round filter f and i a a a i for a round ideal i 8 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding 2 there is an isomorphism between the lattice of round filters of a and the lattice of closed subsets of ya given by f a a a f and c a a c a a 3 there is an isomorphism between the lattice of round ideals of a and the lattice of open subsets of ya given by i a a a i and u a a cl a a u the proof of lemma 2 10 1 is straightforward that of lemma 2 10 2 is given in 2 thm 1 3 12 and lemma 2 10 3 is proved similarly the proof of the next lemma is also straightforward and we skip it lemma 2 11 let a a be a de vries morphism 1 if a a then a a 2 if i is an ideal of a a 1 an i x a and x a 1 an then there is b i b a 1 an such that x b the next two lemmas are about de vries extensions lemma 2 12 1 lem 4 1 let e x y be a compactification of a completely regular space x if e 1 ro y x is the corresponding de vries extension then the image of e 1 is ro x and e 1 is a boolean isomorphism from ro y to ro x lemma 2 13 let a b be a de vries extension 1 1 lem 5 3 if a a and b xb then b a iff b a 2 1 lem 6 2 if c b is another de vries extension then and are compatible iff they induce the same topology on xb 3 normal de vries extensions in this section we introduce normal de vries extensions and show that every normal de vries extension is maximal we prove that the dual equivalence of theorem 2 9 between creg and mdeve restricts to a dual equivalence between the full subcategory norm of creg consisting of normal spaces and the full subcategory ndeve of mdeve consisting of normal de vries extensions definition 3 1 1 we call a de vries extension a b normal provided the following axiom holds if f is a round filter and i a round ideal of a with f i then there are a b a such that a b f a and b i 2 let ndeve be the full subcategory of deve consisting of normal de vries extensions it is a well known theorem see e g 4 cor 3 6 4 that a compactification e x y of a normal space is equivalent to the stone c ech compactification s x x iff disjoint closed de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 9 sets in x have disjoint closures in y we next prove an algebraic version of this result by characterizing normal de vries extensions theorem 3 2 let e x y be a compactification then the associated de vries extension e 1 ro y x is normal iff x is normal and e is isomorphic to the stone c ech compactification s x x of x in particular x is normal iff s 1 ro x x is a normal de vries extension proof first suppose thatx is normal and e is isomorphic to the stone c ech compactification s x x to simplify notation we identify e with s and view x as a dense subspace of x then s 1 w w x let f be a round filter and i a round ideal of ro x with s 1 f s 1 i we have s 1 f f x c is closed in x s 1 i i x u is open in x and c u let d x u then d is closed and c d using that x is normal twice there are v 1 v 2 ro x with c v 1 d v 2 and clx v 1 clx v 2 by lemma 2 12 there are w 1 w 2 ro x with wi x vi by 4 cor 3 6 4 cl x v 1 cl x v 2 so since x is dense in x we have cl x w 1 cl x w 2 therefore cl x w 1 x cl x w 2 since w 2 is regular open cl x w 2 is regular closed so w 3 x cl w w 2 is regular open and w 1 w 3 we have c v 1 w 1 x and w 3 x x x cl x w 2 x cl x w 2 x cl x w 2 x x clx v 2 x v 2 u therefore we have found w 1 w 3 with s 1 f w 1 and w 3 s 1 i this proves that s 1 ro x x is a normal de vries extension conversely suppose that e 1 ro y x is a normal de vries extension by 4 cor 3 6 4 to show that x is normal and e is isomorphic to the stone c ech compactification of x it is sufficient to show that if c and d are disjoint closed sets of x then cly c cly d let u x d then c u set v inty u y x by lemma 2 10 there is a round filter f of ro y with f cly c and a round ideal i of ro y with i v therefore e 1 f cly c x c and e 1 i v x u since e 1 ro y x is a normal de vries extension there are w 1 w 2 ro y with w 1 w 2 c w 1 x and w 2 x u then cly w 1 w 2 since c w 1 x w 1 we see that cly c cly w 1 w 2 also w 2 x u so w 2 u y x since w 2 is open in y it follows that w 2 inty u y x v therefore cly c v so cly c y v finally y v y inty u y x cly x u cly d consequently cly c cly d this finishes the proof corollary 3 3 let a b be a normal de vries extension then is maximal proof this follows from theorems 2 7 and 3 2 10 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding remark 3 4 using theorem 2 4 we can phrase theorem 3 2 dually as follows a de vries extension a b is normal iff xb is normal and the corresponding compactification xb ya is isomorphic to the stone c ech compactification of xb let norm be the full subcategory of creg consisting of normal spaces putting theo rems 2 9 and 3 2 together yields the following duality theorem for normal spaces theorem 3 5 there is a dual equivalence between norm and ndeve 4 locally compact de vries extensions in this section we introduce locally compact de vries extensions unlike normal de vries extensions locally compact de vries extensions do not have to be maximal we prove that the category ldeve of locally compact maximal de vries extensions is dually equivalent to the category lkhaus of locally compact hausdorff spaces let e x y be a compactification and e 1 ro y x the corresponding de vries extension for u ro y we have e 1 u x e 1 inty y u x e 1 y cly u x x e 1 cly u e 1 cly u therefore e 1 u is a closed subset of x for it to be compact since e 1 ro y ro x by lemma 2 12 if e 1 u e 1 vi i i with vi ro y then there is a finite j i with e 1 u e 1 vi i j this motivates the following definition definition 4 1 let a b be a de vries extension 1 we call a a compact provided a s for some s a implies that there is a finite t s with a t 2 let i a a a is compact lemma 4 2 if a b is a de vries extension then i is an ideal of a proof first 0 i because 0 1 1 0 is clearly compact so i is nonempty next let a i and b a suppose that b s for some s a then a 1 b b s b so there is a finite t s with a t b since b a we have b a so b t which shows that b i finally let a b i suppose a b s then a b a b s therefore there are finite t t s with a t and b t thus a b t t yielding that a b i this completes the proof that i is an ideal of a theorem 4 3 let a b be a de vries extension then the following are equivalent 1 xb is locally compact 2 for each b a we have b a a i a b de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 11 3 i is a round ideal with i 1 proof 1 2 suppose that xb is locally compact the de vries extension a b is isomorphic to 1 ro ya xb under this isomorphism i corresponds to i i 1 to simplify notation we view xb as a dense subspace of ya let v ro ya then the map 1 sends v to v xb so v xb is the union of those u ro xb for which clxb u v xb and is compact since clxb u is compact clxb u is closed in ya thus clya u clxb u by lemma 2 12 u w xb for some w ro ya because xb is dense in ya we have clya w clya u which yields clya w v xb v therefore w v moreover as clya w xb clya w clxb u is compact w i thus v xb is the union of w xb for w i and w v which yields 2 2 3 by lemma 4 2 i is an ideal by 2 1 a a i so 1 i to see that i is round let a i then a 1 i since a is compact there are a 1 an i with a a 1 an by lemma 2 11 there is b i with a b by 2 b c c i c b so repeating the above argument with 1 replaced by b yields c b with a c thus a a c so a c and hence a b since b i this shows that i is round 3 1 since i is a round ideal by lemma 2 10 it corresponds to the open subset u a a i of ya claim 4 4 if u a a i then u xb proof of the claim let b be an atom of b since i 1 and b is an atom there is a i with b a by lemma 2 13 1 b a thus xb u for the reverse inclusion let y u then there is c i with c y suppose y 0 then 1 a a y since y is a round filter c y implies there is a y with a c so a c and hence c a therefore 1 a a y and so c a a y as c i and y is closed under finite meets there is a y with c a therefore a a c yielding a c thus a c 0 which is false since a c y consequently y 0 and hence there is an atom b with b y this implies that y 1 b and since y is round y 1 b b because y is an end we have equality and so y xb this completes the proof that xb u from the claim we see that xb is open in ya which implies that xb is locally compact definition 4 5 we call a de vries extension a b locally compact provided b a a i a b for all b a remark 4 6 by theorem 2 4 we can phrase theorem 4 3 dually as follows let e x y be a compactification and let e 1 ro y x be the corresponding de vries extension then the following are equivalent 12 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding 1 x is locally compact 2 is locally compact 3 the ideal i is round and i x in particular x is locally compact iff s 1 ro x x is a locally compact de vries extension we next show that not every locally compact de vries extension is maximal example 4 7 let x be the set of natural numbers equipped with the discrete topology and let c x x be the one point compactification of x 4 thm 3 5 11 by remark 4 6 the de vries extension c 1 ro y x is locally compact however since c is not iso morphic to the stone c ech compactification of x the de vries extension c 1 is not maximal by 1 thm 6 4 definition 4 8 1 let ldeve be the full subcategory of mdeve consisting of locally compact maximal de vries extensions 2 let lkhaus be the full subcategory of creg consisting of locally compact spaces theorem 4 9 there is a dual equivalence between lkhaus and ldeve proof apply theorems 2 9 and 4 3 another duality for lkhaus was obtained by dimov 3 in section 6 we will show how to derive dimov s duality from theorem 4 9 5 compact de vries extensions in this section we introduce compact de vries extensions and prove that the category of compact de vries extensions is dually equivalent to the category of compact hausdorff spaces this yields that the category of compact de vries extensions is equivalent to the category of de vries algebras we give a direct proof of this equivalence thus providing a different perspective on de vries duality definition 5 1 1 we call a de vries extension a b compact provided the following axiom holds if f is a round filter and i a round ideal of a with f i then f i 2 let cdeve be the full subcategory of deve consisting of compact de vries extensions remark 5 2 every compact de vries extension is normal to see this let a b be a compact de vries extension f a round filter and i a round ideal of a with f i then there is a f i since i is round there is b i with a b therefore f a and b i thus is normal consequently cdeve is a full subcategory of ndeve and hence also of mdeve theorem 5 3 for a de vries extension a b the following are equivalent de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 13 1 is a compact de vries extension 2 xb is compact 3 i a proof 1 2 let x be an end of a if x 0 then for f x and i 0 1 implies that 0 x which is false therefore there is an atom b of b with b x this means x 1 b and so x 1 b since 1 b is a round filter and x is an end we obtain x 1 b and so x b thus xb ya and hence xb is compact 2 3 suppose that xb is compact since is isomorphic to 1 ro ya xb and 1 ya xb is compact we see that 1 i so i a 3 1 suppose that i a let f be a round filter and i a round ideal of a with f i then f i 1 we show that f i let j c a c f since f is a round filter j is a round ideal we show that f j since f is round b f implies that there is a f with a b then a a b therefore f a a f a a f c c j j from this equality we have 1 j i since 1 i there are a 1 an j and b 1 bm i with 1 a 1 an b 1 bm let a a 1 an and b b 1 bm then a j b i a 1 an a and b 1 bm b therefore 1 a b and so a b 1 which gives a b this implies a b so a i because a j we have a f and hence a f i thus a b is a compact de vries extension remark 5 4 by theorem 2 4 we can phrase theorem 5 3 dually as follows let e x y be a compactification and let e 1 ro y x be the corresponding de vries extension then the following are equivalent 1 x is compact 2 is compact 3 i ro y in particular x is compact iff s 1 ro x x is a compact de vries extension since khaus is a full subcategory of creg we may interpret it as a full subcategory of comp this interpretation sends a compact hausdorff space x to the compactification x x theorem 5 5 cdeve is dually equivalent to khaus proof by remark 5 2 cdeve is a full subcategory of mdeve the result then follows from theorems 2 9 and 5 3 this together with de vries duality yields that cdeve is equivalent dev we give a direct proof of this result which provides a different perspective on de vries duality 14 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding theorem 5 6 cdeve is equivalent to dev proof define a functor d dev cdeve as follows if a is a de vries algebra then a a ya is a de vries extension which is compact by theorem 5 3 and we set d a a to define d on morphisms for a de vries morphism a a consider the diagram a a ya 1 a a ya for a a we have 1 a a y ya a y y ya c a c y also a a a c c a since a c y ya c y and in ya is union we see that 1 a a therefore 1 is a morphism in deve and we set d 1 it is clear that d sends identity morphisms to identity morphisms if a a and a a are morphisms in dev then d 1 since 1 1 1 1 we see that d 1 1 1 1 thus d is a functor since d 1 it is clear that d is faithful to see that d is full let be a morphism between a a ya and a a ya then a a if a a then as we saw above a a a a 1 a a therefore since a a is join meet dense in ya and 1 are both complete boolean homomorphisms we conclude that 1 thus 1 d and hence d is full let a b be a compact extension then xb is compact by theorem 5 3 so xb ya is a homeomorphism therefore is isomorphic to a a ya thus d dev cdeve is an equivalence of categories 8 thm iv 4 1 6 one point compactifications and minimal de vries extensions in this section we give an algebraic description of the one point compactification of a non compact locally compact hausdorff space by introducing the concept of a minimal de vries extension as we pointed out in remark 2 8 a compactification e x y is equivalent to the stone c ech compactification s x x iff e is isomorphic to s in comp we next show that if x is non compact locally compact then a corresponding result holds for the one point compactification of x lemma 6 1 let x be a non compact locally compact hausdorff space and let e x y be a compactification if e is isomorphic to the one point compactification c x x in comp then e and c are equivalent de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 15 proof by hypothesis there is an isomorphism f g between e and c which means the following diagram is commutative x e f y g x c x write x c x we claim that y e x 1 since g is onto there is w y with g w then w e x since c x let y y with y w then g y since g is 1 1 therefore there is x x with g y c x since f is onto there is x x with x f x therefore g y c f x g e x since g is 1 1 y e x this proves y e x w yielding the claim define h y x by h e x c x if x x and h w this is well defined since e is 1 1 note that h e c follows immediately from the definition we prove that h is a homeomorphism let v be open in x first suppose that v then v is open in c x so v c u for some open set u of x as h is 1 1 and h e c we see that that h 1 v h 1 c u e u this is open in y since u is open in x and e x is open in y next suppose that v then v c u with u open in x and x u compact by the previous case we see that h 1 v w e u furthermore y h 1 v e x e u e x u since x u is compact e x u is compact and so it is closed in y thus h 1 v is open in y this completes the proof that h is continuous because it is a bijection between compact hausdorff spaces it is a homeomorphism thus e x y and c x x are equivalent as compactifications of x definition 6 2 we say that a de vries extension a b is minimal provided for every compatible de vries extension c b there is a de vries morphism a c such that a b c theorem 6 3 for a de vries extension a b the following are equivalent 1 is minimal but not compact 2 xb is non compact locally compact and xb ya is isomorphic to the one point compactification of xb 3 xb is non compact locally compact and is equivalent to the one point compactifi cation of xb 4 i is an end ideal with i 1 proof 1 3 since is not compact xb is non compact by theorem 5 3 let e xb z be a compactification then e 1 ro z xb is a de vries extension as b b 16 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding xb is a boolean isomorphism 1 b e 1 ro z b is a de vries extension which is compatible with by lemma 2 13 2 since is minimal there is a de vries morphism a ro z with by de vries duality induces a continuous map z ya making the following diagram commute xb e z ya therefore xb ya is the least compactification of xb thus xb is locally compact and xb ya is equivalent to the one point compactification of xb by 4 thm 3 5 12 2 3 the implication follows by lemma 6 1 and the implication is clear 2 4 by theorems 4 3 and 5 3 i is a proper round ideal with i 1 claim 4 4 shows that the open subset of ya corresponding to i is xb because this set is the complement of a single point we see that i is an end ideal 4 2 since i is an end ideal claim 4 4 shows that ya xb is a single point therefore xb is non compact locally compact and xb ya is isomorphic to the one point compactification of xb 3 1 by theorem 5 3 is not compact let c b be a compatible extension then the topology on xb induced by is the same as that induced by and by 4 thm 3 5 11 there is a continuous map f yc ya making the following diagram commute xb yc f ya by de vries duality there is a de vries morphism a c with f since the functor e comp deve is faithful and hence is a minimal de vries extension remark 6 4 using theorem 2 4 we can phrase theorem 6 3 as follows let e x y be a compactification and let e 1 ro y x be the corresponding de vries extension then the following are equivalent 1 x is non compact locally compact and e x y is isomorphic to the one point compactification of x 2 x is non compact locally compact and e x y is equivalent to the one point compactification of x 3 is minimal but not compact 4 i is an end ideal with i x remark 6 5 let a b be a de vries extension 1 if a b is compact then every compatible de vries extension is isomorphic to to see this let c b be compatible with by lemma 2 13 2 the topology on de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 17 xb inherited from is the same as that inherited from because is compact the space xb is compact by theorem 5 3 consequently the embeddings xb ya and xb yc are both homeomorphisms and so and are isomorphic in comp as we see from the following diagram xb ya 1 xb yc by theorem 2 4 it follows that and are isomorphic 2 we show that is both maximal and minimal iff xb is almost compact where we recall see e g 5 p 95 that a completely regular space x is almost compact provided x x 1 first suppose that is not compact by theorem 5 3 xb is non compact therefore by 1 thm 6 4 and theorem 6 3 is both maximal and minimal iff xb is almost compact next suppose that is compact then xb is compact also by 1 each compatible de vries extension is isomorphic to which implies that is both maximal and minimal consequently is both maximal and minimal iff xb is almost compact 7 dimov duality for lkhaus in theorem 4 9 we proved that lkhaus is dually equivalent to ldeve in 3 thm 3 12 dimov proved that lkhaus is dually equivalent to a category we denote by dim below it follows that there is an equivalence between ldeve and dim lkhaus 99 yytt tt tt tt t ff dim oo ldeve in this section we give a direct proof for why ldeve and dim are equivalent thus obtaining dimov duality as a consequence of theorem 4 9 definition 7 1 a dimov algebra is a triple d a i where a is a complete boolean algebra is a binary relation on a satisfying dv 1 dv 5 of definition 2 1 and i is an ideal of a satisfying i 1 if a i and a b then there is c i with a c b i 2 if a c b c for all c i then a b i 3 if b 0 then there is 0 a i with a b remark 7 2 in 3 dimov worked with contact relations and the resulting contact alge bras the two relations and are dual to each other a b iff a b the axioms in terms of are given in 3 def 2 1 and it is straightforward to see that they are equivalent to axioms dv 1 dv 5 for axioms i 1 and i 3 are the same as the axioms dimov gives 18 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding in 3 def 2 9 our axiom i 2 is slightly different from the corresponding axiom of dimov which can be phrased in the language of as follows if a b c for all c i then a b clearly i 2 implies for the converse suppose that holds and a c b c for all c i let d i for each c i we have a d a d a c a c d since c d i by assumption a c d b c d since b c d b c we have a d b c for all c i by dv 3 thus implies a d b since this is true for all d i by dv 5 b a d for all d i applying again yields b a so a b by dv 5 this shows that we can replace by i 2 above definition 7 3 a map d d between dimov algebras is a dimov morphism if satisfies axioms m 1 and m 2 of definition 2 1 together with d 3 if a b then a b d 4 if c i then there is a i with c a d 5 b a a i a b similar to the de vries setting the composition of two dimov morphisms 1 and 2 is given by 2 1 b 2 1 a a i a b like dev with this composition dimov algebras and dimov morphisms form a category see 3 prop 4 24 which we denote by dim remark 7 4 in dimov s original definition 3 def 3 8 a weaker version of axiom d 3 is used if a i and a b then a b but it follows from 3 lem 4 19 that the two axioms are equivalent dimov s proof isn t point free we give an alternative pointfree proof suppose holds to see that d 3 holds let a b to show that a b by i 2 it is sufficient to prove that a c b c for each c i let c i by d 4 there is d i with c d and so a c a d claim 7 5 if a a is a meet preserving function between boolean algebras then a d a d for all a d a proof of the claim we have d a a d a a d a d a d a d a a d a d 0 a d a d thus the claim holds de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 19 by claim 7 5 a d a d but since d i we have a d i so yields a d b so a c a d a d b b c for each c i thus a b lemma 7 6 suppose that a b is a locally compact de vries extension define on a by a b iff a c b c for all c i 1 if a b then a b 2 if a b then a b 3 if a i and a b then a b proof 1 if c i then a c a b b c so a c b c and hence a b 2 for each c i we have a c b c so a c b c by claim 7 5 we have a c a c we show that b c b c to see this b c b so we obtain b c b b c b b c c b b c c b b c b c therefore a c b c thus a b c 0 for all c i since is locally compact c c i 1 by theorem 4 3 consequently 0 a b c c i a b c c i a b therefore a b 0 and so a b 3 by 2 a b since is locally compact b c c i c b because a is compact applying lemma 2 11 to the ideal i b yields c i with a c and c b as a a and is an embedding we have a c so a b we define d ldeve dim as follows for a locally compact de vries extension a b let d a i where a is the underlying complete boolean algebra of a and is defined by a b iff a c b c for all c i as in the statement of lemma 7 6 and if is a morphism in ldeve let d proposition 7 7 d ldeve dim is a covariant functor proof let a b be a locally compact de vries extension we show that d dim for this we first show that satisfies dv 1 dv 5 dv 1 is clear 20 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding dv 2 if a b then a c b c for all c i this implies a c b c and so a b c 0 for all c i since is locally compact i 1 because is an embedding the last equality implies i 1 therefore a b 0 so a b dv 3 if a b c d then for all e i we have a e b e c e d e thus a d dv 4 suppose that a b c then a e b e c e for all e i thus a e b c e for all e i so a b c dv 5 if a b then a c b c for all c i therefore b c a c for all c i thus b a we next show that i satisfies i 1 i 3 i 1 let a i and a b then a b by lemma 7 6 2 since is locally com pact we have b c c i c b because a is compact applying lemma 2 11 to i b yields c i with c b and a c repeating this argument with b replaced by c yields d i with d c and a d since a a we see that a d c so a c b thus a c b by lemma 7 6 1 i 2 if a c b c for all c i then a c i so a c b c for all c i by lemma 7 6 3 thus a b i 3 suppose b 0 then b 0 since is an embedding therefore as b a a i a b there is 0 a i with a b by lemma 7 6 1 a b this shows that d dim and hence d is well defined on objects to see that d is well defined on morphisms let be a morphism between locally compact de vries extensions a b and a b a b a b we show that d d is a morphism in dim since is a de vries morphism it satisfies m 1 and m 2 suppose a i with a b then a b by lemma 7 6 3 so a b this implies a b by lemma 7 6 1 so d 3 holds to verify d 4 we point out that if b i then b b a a i a b therefore b b i a a i but b b i b b i 1 1 so if c i then c a a i since c is compact and i is an ideal there is a i with c a as is an embedding and c c we conclude that c a thus d 4 holds for d 5 since i 1 d 4 implies that 1 a a i let b a then b b a a i a b a i c c i c b de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 21 now if c i with c b then c a a c by m 4 for a with a c we have a i and a c by lemma 7 6 1 thus b a a i a b and so d 5 holds it follows that d is a morphism in dim it is clear that d preserves identity maps to see that d preserves composition let 1 1 and 2 2 be composable morphisms in ldeve their composition is 1 2 1 2 we have shown above that 1 2 is then a morphism of dim therefore by d 5 1 2 b 1 2 a a i a b on the other hand by the definition of the composition 1 2 in dim 1 2 b 1 2 a a i a b by lemma 7 6 for a i we have a b iff a b therefore since 1 2 a 1 2 a we get 1 2 b 1 2 b however by definition of 1 2 b 1 2 a a b which gives the reverse inequality therefore 1 2 1 2 which shows that d preserves composition thus d is a covariant functor our goal is to see that d is an equivalence for this we need to produce for a dimov algebra d a maximal locally compact de vries extension let d a i be a dimov algebra the construction in the following definition is well known in pointfree topology see e g 6 p 126 or 10 p 90 definition 7 8 we define on d by a b iff there is a family cp p q 0 1 with a c 0 c 1 b and cp cq for each p q we call the sequence cp an interpolating sequence witnessing a b recall see e g 10 p 90 that a binary relation r is said to be interpolating if arb implies there is c with arc and crb it is standard to see that is the largest interpolating relation contained in remark 7 9 suppose that d is a dimov algebra and is given as in definition 7 8 if a b and a i then repeated use of i 1 shows that a b in order to prove theorem 7 11 we require the following characterization of compactifi cations of a completely regular space 2 thm 2 2 4 which is de vries pointfree version of smirnov s theorem if x is a completely regular space define on ro x by u v if cl u v if is a proximity on ro x we say that is compatible with the topology if is contained in and v u ro x w ro x u w v for each open set v theorem 7 10 de vries let x be a completely regular space there is an order isomor phism between the poset of inequivalent compactifications of x and the poset of proximities on ro x compatible with the topology 22 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding theorem 7 11 let d a i be a dimov algebra the relation defined in defini tion 7 8 is a de vries proximity and i is a round ideal of the de vries algebra a a moreover if x is the open subspace of ya corresponding to i then x is locally compact and dense in ya and the inclusion map e x ya is isomorphic to the stone c ech com pactification of x furthermore if a x is the locally compact de vries extension corresponding to e then i i proof we first show that is a de vries proximity dv 1 the constant sequence 1 is an interpolating sequence so 1 1 dv 2 if a b and cp is an interpolating sequence then c 0 c 1 so c 0 c 1 thus a b dv 3 if a b c d and ep is an interpolating sequence witnessing b c then it is clear that ep is also an interpolating sequence witnessing a d dv 4 let a b c and let dp ep be interpolating sequences witnessing a b and a c respectively set fp dp eq then fp is an interpolating sequence witnessing a b c dv 5 let a b and cp be an interpolating sequence set dp c 1 p then a c 0 and c 1 b yield b d 0 and d 1 a moreover if p q then 1 q 1 p so c 1 q c 1 p therefore dp c 1 p c 1 q dq thus dq is an interpolating sequence witnessing b a dv 6 let a b and let cp be an interpolating sequence set c c 1 2 if dp cp 2 and ep c 1 p 2 then it is well known and straightforward to see that dp is an interpolating sequence witnessing a c and ep is an interpolating sequence witnessing c b dv 7 if b 0 then there is 0 a i with a b thus a b by a repeated use of i 1 this proves that a is a de vries algebra we next show i is a round ideal of a let a i since a 1 by i 1 there is b i with a b 1 therefore a b this shows that i is round in addition i 1 since otherwise i 0 so by i 3 there is 0 a i with a i thus a i i yielding a 0 the obtained contradiction proves that i 1 since i is a round ideal by lemma 2 10 i corresponds to the open subset x a a i of ya as i 1 from i intya clya x it follows that x is dense in ya since x is an open subset of ya it is locally compact and since x is dense the inclusion map e x ya is a compactification of x consider the locally compact de vries extension a x corresponding to e x ya and given by a a x we show that i i let a i since x a a i we have a x because i is round this implies that clya a x but clya a ya a so ya a x thus a x a x a because ya a x we see that a ya a clya a since clya a is a compact subset of x we conclude that a i conversely let a i then x a is a compact subset of x since x b b i we have a a x a b b i as x a is compact and i is an ideal there is b i with a b because x is dense in ya we have clya a clya a x clya a clya b since i is a round ideal there is c i with clya b c therefore a c so a c and hence a i thus i i de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 23 we finish the proof by showing that e is the stone c ech compactification of x by a dual argument to that in remark 7 2 we have a b iff a c b for all c i if a i then a b implies a b by remark 7 9 in the following we will identify a with ro ya and write y ya we have u v u w v for all w i u w v for all w i cly u w v for all w i cly u w w i v we claim that cly u w w i clx u x to see this we first recall that since i is round and i x if w i there is w i with w w and so cly w w x therefore cly w is a closed subset of x and so cly w clx w from this observation the inclusion is clear for the reverse inclusion let x clx u x by definition of x there is w i with x w if v is an open neighborhood of x then as x clx u x and v w is an open neighborhood of x we have u x v w so u w v thus x cly u w this verifies the claim we have therefore shown that u v iff clx u x v x by lemma 2 12 the map u u x is a boolean isomorphism from ro y to ro x this allows us to move to the relation on ro x which we also denote by given by u v iff clx u v similarly we can move to a proximity on ro x by a standard urysohn argument is the largest proximity on ro x contained in by theorem 7 10 the proximity corresponds to the largest compactification of x and so e x ya is the stone c ech compactification of x this completes the proof theorem 7 12 the categories ldeve and dim are equivalent proof by proposition 7 7 we have a covariant functor d ldeve dim by 8 thm iv 4 1 it is sufficient to show that each object of dim is isomorphic to the d image of an object of ldeve and that d is full and faithful let d a i dim by theorem 7 11 we have a locally compact extension a x with i i the functor d sends this extension to a i where is defined in the statement of lemma 7 6 we show that if a b then a c a b b c so a c b c for each c i since a c i we have a c b c by remark 7 9 thus a b conversely suppose that a b then a c b c for all c i therefore a c b c by the definition of thus a b by i 2 this proves that d d to see that d is faithful since d for each morphism of ldeve it suffices to show that if and are morphisms between a b and a b then 24 g bezhanishvili p j morandi b olberding a b a b we have since both are equal to both and are complete boolean homomorphisms since a is join meet dense in b it follows that this shows that d is faithful finally to see that d is full for each morphism d d in dim we need to produce a morphism in ldeve using the construction of theorem 7 11 we have locally compact de vries extensions a x and a x with i i and i i we first show that a a is a de vries morphism clearly m 1 and m 2 hold to prove m 3 suppose that a b then there is an interpolating sequence cp witnessing a b for each p q since cp cq we have cp cq by d 3 set d 0 c 0 and dp cp if p 0 then p q implies dp dq as dp cp moreover a c 0 d 0 consequently a b finally for m 4 let b a then b a a i a b however if a i and a b then a b by remark 7 9 therefore b a a b and so m 4 holds thus is a de vries morphism we next show that x x if x x then there is b i with x b x by d 4 there is a i with b a since i is round there is c i with a c we have b x so a x therefore a 1 x and so c 1 x x thus x c x as desired the restriction of to x is then a well defined function x x and so there is a complete boolean homomorphism x x given by s 1 s for each s x a x a x to see that is a morphism in ldeve we must show that let b a then b b x 1 b x x x b x x x a b a x on the other hand b a a b now for a b we have a a x x x a x therefore as the join in x is union b x x a b a x b de vries duality for normal spaces and locally compact hausdorff spaces 25 this shows that is a morphism in ldeve since d we conclude that d is full this completes the proof that d is part of a category equivalence between ldeve and dim references 1 g bezhanishvili p j
