coordinate process and ft the canonical filtration of w completed with respect to w is a brownian motion under set f a bounded from above measurable function from w to r in 5 dupuis and ellis prove that loge e f inf e f h 1 1 where the infimum is taken over the probability measures on w which are absolutely continuous with respect to and the relative entropy h is equal to e d d log d d in 1 boue and dupuis use it to derive the variational formulation loge e f inf u e f w u 1 2 1 0 u s 2 ds 1 2 where the infimum is taken over l 2 functions from w to h whose density is adapted to ft this variational formulation is useful to derive large deviation asymptotics as laplace principles for small noise diffusions for instance this result was later extended by budhiraja and dupuis to hilbert space valued brownian motions in 2 and then by zhang to abstract wiener spaces in 19 using the framework developed by u stu nel and zakai in 16 the pre kopa leindler theorem first formulation was given by pre kopa in 12 and arose in stochastic programming where a lot of non linear optimization problems require concavity in 8 huu hariya uses the variational formulation to retrieve a pre kopa leindler theorem for wiener space similar to the formulation of u stu nel and feyel in 7 with log concave measures other functional inequalities can be derived from 1 2 see for instance lehec in 10 the bounded from above hypothesis in 1 2 was weakened significantly by u stu nel in 18 it was replaced with the condition e fe f and the existence of conjugate integers p and q such that f lp e f lq these relaxed hypothesis pave the way to new applications the possibility of using unbounded functions is primordial in dabrowski s application of 1 2 to free entropy in 4 u stu nel s approach is routed in the study of the perturbations of the identity of w which is the co ordinate process and their invertibility the question of the invertibility of an adapted perturbation of the identity is linked to the representability of measures and was put to light by the celebrated example of tsirelson 15 u stu nel proved that if u l 2 h has an adapted density iw u is a s invertible if and only if h iw u 1 2 e u 2 h if u satisfies the hypothesis of girsanov theorem this gives a criteria of existence of strong solutions to some stochastic differential equations indeed u stu nel proves in 17 that if such a iw u in invertible its inverse v is a strong solution to the stochastic differential equation dv t u t v dt dw t to prove 1 2 with the integrability conditions specified above u stu nel uses the fact that h c 1 shifts meaning shifts that are a s fre chet differentiable on h with a a s continuous on h fre chet derivative are a s invertible and that shifts can be approached with h c 1 shifts using the ornstein uhlenbeck semigroup a general framework for variational calculus on wiener space 3 in 9 we give a variational formulation similar as 1 2 for diffusions which are solutions of stochastic differential equations while lowering the integrability hypothesis on f this paper also focus on the invertibility of certain perturbations of the identity that are not affine shifts since the measure considered is not the same however contrary to what u stu nel does in 18 we do not approach f to derive invertible shift from those approached functions we write e f e e f as the wick exponential of some v and then approach v to obtain shifts that generate invertible perturbations of the identity our method relies on the fact that we have a girsanov like change of variable formula with the perturbations of the identity with relatiowith respect to a particular brownian motion it does not use any tool that is specific to gaussian measures two questions arise from this can this method be applied to other measures and can invertibility results be linked to the existence of strong solutions for some stochastic differential equations this paper presents a general framework to be able to similarly derive a variational formulation for loge e f for a large class of measures we give a set of conditions so that a set of processes wu can act as perturbations of w and allow a girsanov like change of variable with respect to a brownian motion at first we want to have a minimal setting to be able to compute the variational formula and we just consider the u whose density is a s bounded and we prove that loge e f inf u e f wu 1 2 u 2 h where the infimum is just taken over the u with a s bounded density thus providing a clearer description of the infimum the integrability hypothesis over f remain the same as in the case of a diffusion in a second time we study the possibilities to expand the domain over which the infimum is taken for both variational calculus results mainly concerning the attainability of the infimum and invertibility results indeed we prove that once again wu is invertible if and only if h wu 1 2 e u 2 h and in case of invertibility its inverse is of the form w v furthermore the invertibility of wu can be related to the existence of strong solutions of stochastic differential equations in certain cases if wu can be written w wu with wu l 0 h having an adapted density and is invertible its inverse w v verify dw v t wu t w vdt w t we also prove a pre kopa leindler theorem onw for the measure however the convexity hypothesis seem very restrictive we apply this framework to various examples first we retrieve the case of the image measure of a diffusion of 9 and then we study the case of the image measure of a brownian bridge a loop measure and finally the image measure of a set of diffusing particles the behaving of diffusing particles satisfying a differential stochastic system was studied by ce pa and lepingle in 3 and rogers and shi in 14 we focus on the case where the stochastic differential system the particles 4 ke vin hartmann z 1 zn verify is of the form z 1 t z 1 0 b 1 t b t 0 z 1 s ds ct j 1 n 1 t 0 ds z 1 s zj s zn t zn 0 bn t b t 0 zn s ds ct j 1 n n t 0 ds zn s zj s where b 1 bn is a r n valued brownian motion and 2 2 which guarantee there is no collision 2 framework set n in we denotew c 0 1 rn the canonicalwiener space h 0 h s ds h l 2 0 1 the associated cameron martin space and w t is the coordinate process we assume that w is equipped with a probability measure the filtration of a process m will be denoted fmt the filtration of w will be simply denoted ft except if stated otherwise every filtration considered is completed with respect to we denote for p r l p a h u l p h u is ft adapted and d u l 0 a h u is d dt a s bounded if m is a martingale and v has a density whose stochastic integral with respect to m is well defined we will denote mv 1 0 v s dm s we also denote the wick exponential as follow mv exp 1 0 v s dm s 1 2 1 0 v s 2 d m s and for p 0 we denote gp m u l p a h e mu 1 we assume there exists a family of processes wu u d and a brownian motion which verify the following conditions i is a brownian motion whose canonical filtration is identical to the canonical filtration of w t ii w 0 w iii for every u d the law of wu under u is the same as the law of w under where u is defined by d u d u iv for every u d wu u v for every u v d w u w v w v u w v a s a general framework for variational calculus on wiener space 5 remark clearly d l a h so if u d e u 1 and u which was defined in condition iii is indeed a probability measure condition iii can be written as follow proposition 1 set u d for every bounded measurable function f we have e f e f w u u next proposition ensures that the compositions written in iv and v are well defined proposition 2 set u d we have wu proof set f cb w bounded and measurable we have using proposition 1 ewu u f e u f w u e f w u u e f so wu u since u we have wu u wu which conclude the proof 3 invertibility results 3 1 first results definition 1 a measurable map u w w is said to be a s left invertible if and only if u and there exists a measurable map v w w such that v u iw a s a measurable map u w w is said to be a s right invertible if and only if there exists a measurable map v w w such that v and u v iw a s proposition 3 set u v w w measurable maps such that v u iw a s and v then u v iw u a s so if u we also have u v iw a s in that case we will say that u is a s invertible and we also have v proof there exists a w such that a 1 and for every w a v u w w consider such a set a we have eu 1 u v w w e 1 u v u w u w e 1 u v u w u w 1 w a e 1 u v u w u w 1 w a e 1 u w u w 1 w a 1 now assume that u is a s invertible set a f 1 such that v a 0 we have 1 a v 0 a s and since u we have 1 a v 0 u a s finally a e 1 a e 1 a v u which concludes the proof 6 ke vin hartmann theorem 1 set u d and assume there exists a measurable map v w w such that v wu iw a s denote v u v then w u v iw a s v d and v w v a s moreover we have dwu d v dw v d u proof set f cb w we have e f v e f v w u u e f u so v and dv d u since wu the first assertion comes from proposition 3 clearly v l 0 h since u d there exists n in such that d dt a s u s w n since v we have d dt a s v s w n finally let us prove that v is adapted we have a s v wu u v wu u hence v wu is adapted set a l 2 d dt an adapted process we have e u 1 0 v s wua s wuds e 1 0 v s a s ds e 1 0 e v s fs a s ds e u 1 0 e v s fs w ua s wuds so e v s fs w u v s wu ds d a s which implies e v s fs v s ds d a s since wu we have w v wu wu v w u w 0 iw a s and v w v wu v w v a s finally set f cb w e f w u e f w u w v v e f v e f w v e f w v wu u e f u which gives the final assertion a general framework for variational calculus on wiener space 7 remark set u d wu is a s invertible if and only if it is a s left invertible 3 2 entropic characterisation of the invertibility of wu in this section we prove that the process wu is left invertible if and only if the kinetic energy of the perturbation u is equal to the relative entropy of wu proposition 4 set u d we have h wu 1 2 e u 2 h proof set g cb w and denote l dwu d we have e g w u e gl e g w ul wu u hence l wue u f wu 1 1 a s and h wu e l logl ewu logl e logl w u e loge u f wu 1 e log u 1 2 e u 2 h the proof gives the following additional result corollary 1 for u d we have l wue u f wu 1 1 now comes the criteria theorem 2 set u d then wu is a s invertible if and only if h wu 1 2 e u 2 h proof assume that the inequality hold we still denote l dw u d and as in last proof we have a s l wue u f wu 1 1 using jensen inequality we have a s 0 logl wu loge u f wu 1 logl wu e log u f wu 1 8 ke vin hartmann and 0 e logl w u e log u h wu 1 2 e u 2 h 0 so 0 logl wu loge u f wu 1 logl wu e log u f wu 1 and loge u f wu 1 e log u f wu 1 the strict concavity of the function log gives e u f wu 1 u finally we have 3 3 l wu u 1 since is a brownian motion there exists v l 0 a h such that l v we apply the logarithm to 3 3 to get 0 v w u 1 2 v wu h u 1 2 u h we have v w u 1 0 v s wud s v wu u h so finally we have 3 4 0 v w u u 1 2 v wu u 2 h according to girsanov theorem v is a wu brownian motion so e l logl ewu logl ewu 1 0 v s d s 1 2 1 0 v s 2 ds 1 2 ewu 1 0 v s 2 ds 1 2 e v wu 2 h so v wu l 2 a h and we can take the expectation with respect to in 3 4 to obtain u v w u 0 a s which implies v d so a s w v wu wu v w u w 0 iw a general framework for variational calculus on wiener space 9 conversely assume that wu admits an inverse v and set v u v according to theorem 1 v d and w v v a s once again denote l dw u d we know that l v observe that logl wu 1 0 v s d s 1 2 1 0 v s 2 ds wu log u so finally h wu e l logl e logl w u e log u 1 2 e u 2 h the proof gives the following additional result corollary 2 set u d such that wu is a s left invertible we have l wu u 1 the following corollary is an immediate consequence of theorems 1 and 2 corollary 3 set u d we have h wu 1 2 e u 2 h if and only if there exists v d such that w v wu wu w v iw a s definition 2 we define di as di u d wu is a s

dwun d log dwun d d d log d d in l 1 dwun d log d d d d log d d in l 1 10 ke vin hartmann proof denote l d d eventually sequentializing afterward we have to prove that for any 0 there exists u di such that e dwu d log dwu d l 1 logl 1 e dwu d logl 1 l 1 logl 1 the proof is divided in six steps step 1 we approximate l with a density that is both lower bounded and upper bounded denote n min l n ln n

ln logl l logl and the lebesgue theorem ensures that ln logl converges to ln logl in l 1 so there exists n 0 in such that e ln 0 logln 0 l logl e ln 0 logl l logl ln 0 a 1 a log ln 0 a 1 a converges a s to ln 0 logln 0 when a converges to 0 set a 0 1 we have ln 0 a 1 a log ln 0 a 1 a ln 0 a 1 a log ln 0 a 1 a 1 ln 0 1 ln 0 a 1 a log ln 0 a 1 a 1 ln 0 1 e 11 ln 0 1 ln 0 logln 0 1 ln 0 1 e 1 ln 0 logln 0 a general framework for variational calculus on wiener space 11 so the lebesgue theorem ensures that ln 0 a 1 a log ln 0 a 1 a converges to ln 0 logln 0 in l 1 simi larly ln 0 a 1 a logl converges a s to ln 0 logl and ln 0 a 1 a logl ln 0 1 logl and the lebesgue theorem ensures that ln 0 a 1 a logl converges to ln 0 logl in l 1 and there exists a 0 1 such that e ln 0 a 1 a log ln 0 a

1 2 t 0 s 2 ds with l 0 a h step 2 we prove that l 2 h set tn inf t 0 1 t 0 s 2 ds n tn is a sequence of stopping times which increases stationarily toward 1 we have using m 1 0 s m s d s e m t tn 1 2 e t tn 0 s 2 m s 2 ds d 2 e t tn 0 s 2 ds so e t tn 0 s 2 ds 1 d 2 e m t tn 1 2 2 d 2 1 d 2 hence passing to the limit e 1 0 s 2 ds step 3 we approximate with an element of l h define n t w r w 7 t 0

logmn 1 max e 1 d logd mn 1 logl d logl so the lebesgue theorem ensures that mn 1 logmn 1 converges to m 1 logm 1 in l 1 and mn 1 logl converges to m 1 logl in l 1 and there exists n in such that mn 1 logmn 1 m 1 logm 1 mn 1 logl m 1 logl step 4 we approximate n with an element of d define n m t w 0 1 w 7 t 0 max min n s w m m ds and m n m t exp t 0 n m s d s 1 2 t 0 n m s 2 ds mn m 1 logmn m 1 and mn m 1 logl converges respectively tomn 1 logmn 1 andmn 1 logl in probability to prove that mn m 1 logmn m 1 is uniformly integrable it is sufficient to prove it is bounded in any lp set p 1 e m n m 1

have for any 0 d ds a s s m i e d similarly as before n 1 logn 1 converges in probability to mn m 1 logmn m 1 and n 1 is bounded in every lp hence n 1 logn 1 is uniformly integrable and converges in l

prove that w is a s left invertible and is the solution to our problem set a w such that a 1 and for every w a w w w w and set w 1 w 2 a such that w w 1 w w 2 we have w w 1 w w 2 w 1 0 s w 1 ds w 2 0 s w 2 ds for any s 0 s w 1 s w 2 being adapted to filtration f s it implies that for s 0 2 s 0 r w 1 ds s 0 r w 2 ds 14 ke vin hartmann and s w 1 s w 2 an easy iteration shows that w 1 w 2 since and w have the same filtrations and is a s path continuous we can write w t t s s 0 t q a s for every t 0 1 with a measurable function from r qq to r see 11 consequently we can write w t t 0 1 q t t 0 1 q a

q w 1 and w 2 are continuous and coincide on 0 1 q so they are equal w is a s injective and so a s left invertible its inverse is of the form w v with v d and we have dw v d l n 1 so w v and w v w w w

we still denote the wiener measure on w set a irn we denote a the measure on w such that for any bounded measurable function f we have e a f e f w 1 a a can also be defined as follow let ea be the dirac measure in a ea w 1 is a positive wiener distributions hence it defines a radon measure a on w then a 1 2 n a we recall the definition of a brownian bridge definition 6 set g q a probability space an a brownian bridge x under a probability q is a path continuous gaussian process such that eq x t at and cov x s x t s t st id proposition 8 w is an a brownian bridge under a and the process a defined as a t w t at t 0 w s as 1 s ds is a brownian motion under a and the filtrations of a and w completed with respect to a are equal moreover we have w t at 1 t t 0 d a s 1 s proof it is easy to verify that the process z given by z t w t at tw 1 is an a brownian bridge under and is independent of w 1 if f is a bounded continuous function on w we have e f z e f z w 1 a e f w w 1 a e f w 1 a e a f e a f w a general framework for variational calculus on wiener space 25 so w is indeed an a brownian bridge under a now consider the process x given by x t 1 t w t 1 t at it is easy again to verify that x is a brownian bridge under now consider m 0 dw s 1 s m is a continuous martingale under and mi mj t ij t 0 ds 1 s 2 ij t 1 t so the dubins schwartz theorem ensures that m and w 1 have the same distribution under so x and x have the same distribution where x is given by x t 1 t t 0 dw s 1 s at w t t 0 x s as 1 s ds at the last equality coming from ito s formula w is a brownian motion under and the law of x w under is the same as the law of w a under a so a t t 0 1 is a brownian motion under a we recall that the filtrations we are considering are all completed with respect to a from the expression of a we have clearly for any t 0 1 f a t f w t furthermore s 7 1 1 s being lipschitz on any 0 t with t 1 w is the strong solution of a stochastic differential equation relative to a and we have for any t 1 fwt f a t w being a a s path continuous we have t 1 fwt f w 1 on the other hand since a t t 0 1 is a brownian motion a t t 0 1 is bounded by 1 so a t converges a a s and in l 2 a r n denote a 1 the limit for s 0 1 we have cov a s a t lim t 1 cov a s a t s t so t 1 f a t f a 1 a t t 0 1 is a a brownian motion and a and w have the same filtration the following

that every filtration we consider here is completed with respect to l the fact that lp t t 0 1 is a brownian motion is direct consequence of proposition 10 and the expression of lp gives that for t 1 f lp t f w t on the other hand for t 1 since s 7 h s x h s x is lipschitz on 0 t and x 7 h s x h s x is lipschitz on x irn x k for any k 0 so w is the strong solution of a stochastic differential
