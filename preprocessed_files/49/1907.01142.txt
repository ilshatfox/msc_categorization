fields e g medical imaging 22 computer graphics 11 8 industry 4 and preservation of cultural heritage 16 a fundamental step is to reconstruct a surface from a 3 d scanned point cloud data 1 denoted as d rm for m 2 or 3 such as in figure 1 a b c figure 1 test point clouds a five fold circle 200 points b jar 2100 points c torus 2000 points we focus on reconstructing an m dimensional manifold a curve in r 2 or a surface in r 3 from the point cloud d we assume only the point locations are given and no other geometrical information such as normal vectors at each point are known we explore fast algorithms for minimizing the following energy proposed in 38 ep d x p dx 1 p 1 where d x miny d x y is the distance from any point x rm to d p is a positive integer and dx is the surface area element

18 poisson reconstruction 20 5 24 21 14 we use the level set method as in 15 37 38 the level set formulation allows topological changes and self intersection during the evolution 29 28 and gain popularity in many applications 12 36 31 just to mention a few we represent the surface as a zero level set of rm 1 r 1 0 x rm x 0 there are various related works on surface reconstruction from point cloud data a con vection model proposed in 37 a data driven logarithmic prior for noisy data in 33 using surface tension to enrich the euler lagrange equations in 17 and using principal component analysis to reconstruct curves embedded in sub manifolds in 27 a semi implicit scheme is introduced in 34 to simulate the curvature and surface diffusion motion of the interface in 25 the authors defined the surface via a collection of anisotropic gaussians centered at each entry of the input point cloud and used tvg l 1 model 7 for minimization a similar strat egy addresses an 0 gradient regularization model proposed in 23 some models incorporate additional information in 26 the authors proposed a novel variational model consisting of the distance the normal and the smoothness term euler s elastica model is incorporated for surface reconstruction in 32 where graph cuts algorithm is used the model in 15 extends the active contours segmentation model to 3 d and implicitly allows controlling the curvature of the level set function in this paper we explore fast algorithms to minimize the weighted minimum surface energy 1 for p 1 and 2 we propose a semi implicit method sim to relax the time step constraint for p 2 and an augmented lagrangian method alm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers admm approach for p 1 these algorithms minimize the weighted minimal surface energy 1 with high accuracy and superior efficiency we analyze the behavior of alm in terms of parameter choices and explore its connection to sim various numerical experiments are presented to discuss the effects of the algorithms we organize this paper as follows in section 2 we present the two methods sim and alm and explore their connection numerical experiments are presented in section 3 and effects of the parameters are discussed in subsection 3 3 we conclude our paper in section 4 2 proposed algorithms let rm m 2 or 3 denote a bounded domain containing the given m dimensional point cloud data d using the level set formulation for the d weighted minimum surface energy 1 can be rewritten as ep d x p dx 1 p 2 here x is the dirac delta function which takes when x 0 and 0 elsewhere compared to 1 this integral is defined on which makes the computation flexible and free from explicitly tracking we use p 2 for sim introduced in section 2 1 and p 1 for alm in section 2 2 in general p 2 is a natural choice since it provides better stability and efficiency for a semi implicit type pde based method for alm we explore p 1 to take advantage of an aspect of fast algorithm in admm setting such as shrinkage similarly to the case in 3 visually the numerical results of surface reconstruction are similar for p 1 or p 2 see section 3 2 2 1 semi implicit method sim to minimize e 2 we introduce a gradient flow based semi implicit method to minimize e 2 d x 2 dx 1 2 3 following 38 the first variation of e 2 with respect to is characterized as a functional e 2 v 1 2 d 2 x dx 1 2 d 2 x v dx for any test function v from the sobolev space h 1 minimizing 3 is equivalent to finding the critical point such that e 2 v 0 v h 1 this is associated with solving the following initial value problem t f d d 2 x x 0 0 4 where 0 is an initial guess for the unknown and f d 1 2 d 2 x dx 1 2 the steady state solution of 4 gives a minimizer of e 2 here the delta function is realized as the derivative of the one dimensional heaviside function h r 0 1 we adopt the smooth approximation of h as in 6 h h 1 2 arctan and h 2 2 5 with 0 as the smoothness parameter then f is approximated by its smoothed version f expressed as f d 1 2 2 2 d 2 x 2 2 dx 1 2 we add a stabilizing diffusive term for 0 on both sides of the pde in 4 to consolidate the computation similarly to 34 t f d d 2 x 6 employing a semi implicit scheme we solve from 6 by iteratively updating n 1 using n via the following equation n 1 t n 1 n t n f d n d 2 x n n 7 where t is the time step this equation can be efficiently solved by the fast fourier transform fft denoting the discrete fourier transform by f and its inverse by f 1 we have f i 1 j e 2 1 i 1 mf i j f i j 1 e 2 1 j 1 nf i j accordingly the discrete fourier transform of is f i j 2 cos 1 i 1 m 2 cos 1 j 1 n 4 f i j 3 here the coefficient in front of f i j represents the diagonalized discrete laplacian operator in the frequency domain let g 1 be the right side of 7 then the solution n 1 i j of 7 is computed via n 1 i j f 1 f g 1 i j 1 t 2 cos 1 i 1 n 2 cos 1 j 1 n 4 8 as for the stopping criterion we exploit the mean relative change of the weighted minimum surface energy 1 at the nth iteration the algorithm terminates if e kn 1 e k n e kn 10 4 where e kn 1 k n i n k ep i 9 here the quantity e kn represents the average of the energy values computed from the n k th to the nth iteration for some k n k 1 we fix k 10 and set p 2 for sim we summarize the main steps of sim in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 sim for the weighted minimum surface 3 initialization d 0 and n 0 while the stopping criterion 9 with p 2 is greater than 10 4 do update n 1 from n solving 8 update n n 1 end output n such that n 0 approximates 0 2 2 augmented lagrangian method alm to minimize e 1 in this section we present an augmented lagrangian based method to minimize the weighted minimum surface energy 2 for p 1 i e e 1 d x dx 10 for the non differentiable term in 10 we utilize the variable splitting and introduce an auxiliary variable p we rephrase the minimization of e 1 as a constrained optimization problem p arg min p d p 2 2 dx subject to p 11 here we replace by its smooth approximation h as in 5 to solve problem 11 we formulate the augmented lagrangian function l p r d p 2 2 dx r 2 p 2 dx p dx 12 where r 0 is a scalar penalty parameter and rm 1 rm 1 represents the lagrangian multiplier minimizing 12 amounts to considering the following saddle point problem find p r rm 1 rm 1 s t l p r l p r l p r p r rm 1 rm 1 13 4 given n pn and n for n 0 1 2 the n 1 th iteration of an admm type algorithm for 13 consists of solving a series of sub problems n 1 arg min l pn n r 14 pn 1 arg min p l n 1 p n r 15 n 1 n r pn 1 n 1 16 each sub problem can be solved efficiently first we find the minimizer of the sub problem 14 by solving its euler lagrange equation r n 1 2 d pn n 2 n 2 2 rpn n 17 following 3 we introduce a frozen coefficient term for 0 on both sides of 17 to stabilize the computation thus 14 is solved using the following equation n 1 r n 1 n 2 d pn n 2 n 2 2 rpn n 18 here is the laplacian operator and we solve this via fft similar to 8 for sim thus the sub problem is solved via n 1 i j f 1 f g 2 i j r 2 cos 1 i 1 n 2 cos 1 j 1 n 4 19 second the p sub problem 15 is equivalent to a weighted total variation tv mini mization whose solution admits a closed form expression using the shrinkage operator 35 explicitly the updated pn 1 is computed via pn 1 max 0 1 d 2 n 1 2 r n 1 n n 1 n r 20 finally the lagrangian multiplier is updated by 16 the stopping criterion for the alm iteration is the same as that for sim 9 but with p 1 we summarize the main steps of alm in algorithm 2 algorithm 2 alm for the weighted minimum surface 10 initialization d 0 p 0 0 and n 0 while the stopping criterion 9 with p 1 is greater than 10 4 do update n 1 arg min l pn n r via 19 update pn 1 arg minp l n 1 p n r via 20 update n 1 n r pn 1 n 1 update n n 1 end output n such that n 0 approximates 0 2 3 connection between sim and alm algorithms note that both sim and alm involve solving elliptic pdes of the form a b g 21 5 figure 2 the cpu time s of alm until convergence for the five fold circle point cloud in figure 1 a here r 1 and varies from 0 05 to 0 5 the connection between sim and alm indicates that large slows down alm in this graph as increases the time required to reach the convergence increases for some constants a b 0 and a function g defined on for sim it is equation 7 1 t a n 1 b n 1 n t n f d n d 2 x n n g and for alm it is equation 18 a n 1 r b n 1 n 2 d pn n 2 n 2 2 rpn n g we remark interesting connections between sim and alm first both methods have sta bilizing terms but in different positions on the left side of 21 for sim it is while for alm it is second relating the coefficients of 1 t in sim gives insight to the effect of in alm in general a large slows down the convergence of alm while a small accelerates it as the effect of 1 t on sim figure 2 shows convergence behaviors of alm for different using the five fold circle point cloud in figure 1 a it displays the cpu time in seconds for r 1 1 and varying from 0 05 to 0 5 note that as increases the time required to reach the convergence increases almost quadratically at first then stays around the same level third the correspondence between b in sim and b r in alm allows another interpretation of the parameter r in alm in sim a large smears the solution and avoids discontinuities or sharp corners and for alm large r also allows to pass through fine details figure 7 in section 3 presents more details where we experiment with different r and values for the five fold circle point cloud shown in figure 1 a 3 numerical implementations experiments and effects of pa rameters in this section we describe the implementation details and present numerical experiments for both sim and alm we vary from 0 5 to 1 for sim we use t 500 when d is in 2 d we set 0 1 and 0 01 for 3 d for alm ranges from 0 05 to 1 and r from 0 5 to 2 the code is written in matlab and executed without additional machine support e g

under windows os the contours and isosurfaces are displayed using matlab visualization engine no post processing e g smoothing or sharpening is applied 3 1 implementation details we illustrate the details for planar point clouds i e d r 2 and the extension to r 3 is straightforward let the computational domain 0 m 0 n m n 0 be discretized by a cartesian grid with x y 1 for any function u or a vector field v v 1 v 2 defined on we use ui j or u i j to denote u i x i y we use the usual backward and forward finite difference schemes 1 ui j ui j ui 1 j 1 i m u 1 j um j i 1 1 ui j ui 1 j ui j 1 i m 1 u 1 j um j i m 2 ui j ui j ui j 1 1 j n ui 1 ui n j 1 2 ui j ui j 1 ui j 1 j n 1 ui 1 ui n j n the gradient divergence and the laplacian operators are approximated as follows ui j 1 ui j 1 ui j

eikonal equation d 1 in d x 0 for x d 22 and discretizing 22 via the lax friedrich scheme leads to an updating formula dn 1 i j 1 2 1 dni j dni 1 j d n i 1 j 2 dni j 1 d n i j 1 2 23 we solve 23 using the fast sweeping method 19 with complexity o g for g grid points keeping n to be a signed distance function during the iteration improves the stability of level set based algorithms we reinitialize n at the nth iteration by solving the following pde sign 1 0 x 0 n 24 here subscript represents artificial time and partial derivative and sign r 1 0 1 is the sign function in practice n being a signed distance function near 0 level set is important thus it is sufficient to solve 24 for a few steps we fix 10 steps of reinitialization throughout this paper 3 2 numerical experiments of 2 d and 3 d point clouds the first experiment figure 3 is reconstruction of planar curves from 2 d point clouds confined within a square 0 100 2 r 2 we generate the data using four different shapes a triangle an ellipse a square whose corners are missing and a five fold circle for these cases we use a centered circle with radius 30 as the initial guess shown in figure 3 a figure 3 b and c display the given d as well as the curves identified by sim and alm with r 1 5 respectively both methods produce comparably accurate results in the triangle example corners get as 7 figure 3 the test point clouds triangle with 150 number of points ellipse with 100 points square with 80 points and five fold circle with 200 points a the top row identical initial condition applied to sim and alm for different d b the middle row the results obtained by sim c the bottom row the results obtained by alm using r 1 5 both methods give compatible results close as the approximated delta function with parameter allows for both methods the ellipse and square results fit very closely to the given point clouds for the five fold circle there is a slight difference in how the curve fits the edges yet the results are very compatible table 1 shows the cpu time in seconds for sim alm using r 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 and the explicit method in 38 with t 20 on the same data sets with proper choices of r alm outperforms the other methods in terms of computational efficiency sim is stable without any dependency on the choice of parameters and its run times are comparable to the best performances of alm in most cases both methods are faster than the explicit method in all the examples and computational efficiency is similar between alm and sim object alm r 0 5 alm r 1 alm r 1 5 alm r 2 sim 38 triangle 1 45 1 31 1 48 1

in 38 with t 20 for the point cloud data sets in figure 3 both sim and alm shows fast convergence the second set of experiments reconstruct surface from the point cloud d in 3 d a jar in figure 1 b and a torus in figure 1 c within 0 50 3 in figure 4 we show the reconstructed surfaces using sim and alm a portion of the given point cloud is superposed for validation in each case both methods successfully capture the overall shapes and non convex features of the jar as well as the torus there are only slight differences in the reconstruction between using sim with p 2 and using alm with p 1 table 2 shows the efficiency of sim and alm compared to the explicit method in 38 for the experiments in figure 4 thanks to the semi implicit scheme t can be large and we used 8 a b c d figure 4 the

time step t 20 to maintain the stability the improvement of run time in alm is carefully controlled by the parameters r and we choose r 1 3 0 5 and 0 6 for both cases both sim and alm efficiently

of figure 4 both sim and alm show fast convergence the third set of examples show the effect of the distance function d notice that the weighted minimal surface energy 1 is mainly driven by the distance function d that is the given point cloud d determines the landscape of d which affects the behavior of the level set during the evolution figure 5 shows the evolution using alm applied to different subsets of point clouds sampled from the same bunny face shape the densities of the point cloud vary for the three different regions the face with n 1 points the head with n 2 points and each ear with n 3 points figure 5 a shows the given point cloud for n 1 n 2 n 3 20 10 20 with the 0 level set of n at 15 th iteration b for n 1 n 2 n 3 50 10 20 at 18 th iteration and c for n 1 n 2 n 3 20 10 40 at 20 th iteration these three curves eventually degenerate to a point d for n 1 n 2 n 3 50 10 40 and shows the converged solution in a c denser parts of the point cloud attract the curve with stronger forces the sparser parts of the point cloud fail to lock the curve then the energy model 2 drives curves to have short lengths i e the level set tends to shrink in d with a more balanced distribution of points the curve converges to correct shape 9 figure 5 the effect of the distance function for varying density point clouds the face with n 1 points the head with n 2 points and each ear with n 3 points a the given point cloud is with n 1 n 2 n 3 20 10 20 and shows the 0 level set of n at 15 th iteration b n 1 n 2 n 3 50 10 20 and shows 18 th iteration and c n 1 n 2 n 3 20 10 40 and shows 20 th iteration these three curves eventually degenerate to a point d is with n 1 n 2 n 3 50 10 40 and shows the converged solution the potential energy 1 is mainly driven by the distance function d which affects the level set evolution the fourth set of examples demonstrate the robustness of alm and sim against noise figure 6 shows the reconstructed curves from clean and noisy data a c are results of alm and d f are results of sim a and d in the first column show results obtained from the clean data which has 200 points sampled from a three fold circle gaussian noise with standard deviation 1 is added to both x and y coordinates to generate noisy point cloud in the second column b and e to show the differences the third column superposes both results reconstructed from clean and noisy point clouds both alm and sim provide compatible results for the noisy data although the reconstructed curves show some oscillation they are very close to the solutions using the clean data respectively 3 3 choice of parameters for alm and its effects the proposed alm has one parameter r and the model 2 uses the delta function where the smoothness parameter is added to stabilize the computation both parameters have straightforward effects on the level set evolution from 17 for example consider a set of points within a thin band around the 0 level set of n denoted by b x 2 3 n x 2 3 by the continuity of n there exist y and z b such that n y 3 and n z 3 these values are the minimum and maximum of the function h x 2 x 2 x 2 2 respectively at these points 17 takes the following forms n 1 9 d pn 8 3 2 r pn n r at y 9 d pn 8 3 2 r pn n r at z 25 the first terms in the right hand side of 25 show that with a smaller there are less number of points in b but influence from d is stronger with a larger d affects more number of points in b but the influence becomes weaker varying r also modifies the effect of d while the size of b is not changed we also find that interacts with r and effectively modifies the shape of the level set figure 7 shows the results for alm using different combinations of r and on the five fold circle point cloud in figure 1 a for a fixed r increasing makes the approximated delta function smoother consequently narrow and elongated shapes are omitted and the reconstructed curve becomes more convex for a fixed larger r loses more details as discussed in subsection 2 3 the speed of convergence varies for different combinations of r and when the choices are reasonable the algorithm converges fast within 2 seconds when both r and are large results are not as good and the convergences are slow 10 a b c 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 10

alm and d f sim the first column shows the reconstructed curves from clean data and the second column the reconstructions from noisy data the third column shows the comparison between the two reconstructed curves in first two columns figure 7 results by alm with different r and for each column from top to bottom 1 1 5 2 and for each row from left to right r 0 5 0 8 1 2 increasing renders the curve less sharp and more convex increasing r induces a stronger diffusion effect on n 11 another observation comes from 20 for any point x and n 0 if the following value qn r n r n n 1 2 d n 3 r n n 1 is positive then pn x 0 and d has no direct effect on 18 at x in the next iteration regarding qn r as a quadratic polynomial in terms of parameterized by r the sign of qn r depends on the sign of n x and the sign of its discriminant computed via discqn d 2 4 n 4 2 r n n 1 2 the sign of n x is related to the position of x relative to the 0 level set the sign of discqn is determined by comparing the length of a vector difference r n n 1 with the quan tity d 4 n 2 by the projection theorem r n n 1 2 is bounded below by n n 1 2 proj n n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 i e the squared residual of orthogonal projection of n 1 onto n therefore we can decide the sign of discqn using r via the following cases 1 when d 2 4 n 4 2 n for any r 0 discqn 0 2 when d 2 4 n 4 2 n a if r rnu or r r n l then discq n 0 b if max 0 rnl r r n u then discq n 0 here rnu proj n n 1 d 2 4 n 4 2 n n and rnl proj n n 1 d 2 4 n 4 2 n n when n x 0 qn concaves upwards and qn 0 r 0 for any r if discqn 0 qn is positive for all and d has no effect on level set evolution if discqn 0 qn is positive for outside the interval bounded by two roots of qn i e 0 d discqn 2 n r n n 1 or d discqn 2 n r n n 1 when n x 0 qn concaves downwards and qn 0 r 0 for any r in this case qn is never positive either discqn 0 i e no roots or discqn 0 but both roots are negative notice that the bounds rnl and r n u are closely related to the ratio d n 2 which contributes to the adaptive behavior of alm for example for a point x where n x 0 when n x is close to 0 but d x 0 rnl 0 and r n u becomes extremely large thus for a moderate value of r d has strong influence on the evolution of the level set near x and swiftly moves the curve towards the point cloud for a point x which is close to both d and n 0 the level set evolution becomes more stringent about the minimization of the energy 10 figure 8 illustrates this effect for the five fold circle point cloud in figure 1 a with r 2 and 1 figure 8 shows a discqn b rnu c r n l and d the region where d effects the level set evolution the figures are for iterations n 2 3 4 7 8 10 11 13 and 38 converged the region inside n 0 always experiences the influence of d as described above figure 8 a shows that the region outside n 0 is mostly blue indicating discqn 0 hence for almost every point outside the 0 level set as long as rnl r r n u the landscape of d has strong effects on the evolution in b and c observe that high values of rnu only concentrate near the 0 level set while rnl remains relatively small in the whole domain thus the influence of d is strong near n 0 d displays the white regions where d explicitly guides the level set evolution and the black regions where d has no direct effect these results show that although alm evolves the level set globally it ignores the effects of d when evolving the regions far away from the level sets and it utilizes d to refine the local structures for the regions of the level sets close to d 12 a b c d figure 8 a discqn b rnu c r n l at certain iterations d the region in white where d explicitly guides the level set evolution by alm the distance function d refines the local structures and it is only active near n 0 this partially explains the efficiency of alm 13 4 conclusion we propose two fast algorithms sim and alm to reconstruct m dimensional manifold from un structured point clouds by minimizing the weighted minimum surface energy 2 sim improves the computational efficiency by relaxing the constraint on the time step using a semi implicit scheme alm follows an augmented lagrangian approach and solves the problem by an admm type algorithm numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms are superior at the computational speed and both of them produce accurate results theoretically we demonstrate the delicate interaction among parameters involved in alm and show the connections between sim and alm this explains the behaviors of alm from the perspective of sim
