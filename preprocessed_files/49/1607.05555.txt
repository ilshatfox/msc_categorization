density in l 2 also denote the wiener measure w the coordinate process and ft the canonical filtration of w completed with respect to w is a brownian motion under set f a bounded from above measurable function from w 1 http arxiv org abs 1607 05555 v 3 2 ke vin hartmann to r in 5 dupuis and ellis prove that loge e f inf e f h 1 1 where the infimum is taken over the probability measures on w which are absolutely continuous with respect to and the relative entropy h is equal to e d d log d d in 1 boue and dupuis use it to derive the variational formulation loge e f inf u e f w u 1 2 1 0 u s 2 ds 1 2 where the infimum is taken over l 2 functions from w to h whose density is adapted to ft this variational formulation is useful to derive large deviation asymptotics as laplace principles for small noise diffusions for instance this result was later extended by budhiraja and dupuis to hilbert space valued brownian motions in 2 and then by zhang to abstract wiener space in 21 using the framework developed by u stu nel and zakai in 18 the pre kopa leindler theorem first formulation was given by pre kopa in 14 and arose in stochastic programming where a lot of non linear optimization problems require concavity in 8 huu hariya uses the variational formulation to retrieve a pre kopa leindler theorem for wiener space similar to the formulation of u stu nel in 7 with log concave measures other functional inequalities can be derived from 1 2 see for instance lehec in 12 the bounded from above hypothesis in 1 2 was weakened significantly by u stu nel in 20 it was replaced with the condition e fe f and the existence of conjugate integers p and q such that f lp e f lq these relaxed hypothesis pave the way to new applications the possibility of using unbounded functions is primordial in dabrowski s application of 1 2 to free entropy in 4 u stu nel s approach is routed in the study of the perturbations of the identity of w which is the co ordinate process and their invertibility the question of the invertibility of an adapted perturbation of the identity is linked to the representability of measures and was put to light by the celebrated example of tsirelson 17 u stu nel proved that if u l 2 h and its density is adapted iw u is a s invertible if and only if h iw u 1 2 e u 2 h to prove 1 2 with the integrability conditions specified above u stu nel uses the fact that h c 1 shifts meaning shifts that are a s fre chet differentiable on h with a a s continuous on h fre chet derivative are a s invertible and that shifts can be approached with h c 1 shifts using the ornstein uhlenbeck semigroup in 9 we give a variational formulation similar as 1 2 for diffusions solutions of stochastic differential equations while lowering the integrability hypothesis on f in 10 we present a general framework to be able to similarly derive a variational formulation for loge e f for a large class of measures without increasing the integrability hypothesis on f we give a set of conditions so that a set of processes wu can act as perturbations of w and allow a girsanov like change of variable with respect to a brownian motion we write e f e e f as the variational calculus on wiener space with respect to conditional expectations 3 wick exponential of some v and then approach v to obtain invertible perturbations of the identity hyndman and wang proved in 11 that loge e f ft inf e f ft e log d d ft 1 3 where the infimum is taken over the probability measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to and verify e d d ft 1 they link it to forward backward stochastic differential equations and apply it to various pricing problems for zero coupon bonds the relation 1 3 obtained for a deterministic time t is very similar to 1 1 so three questions arise naturally can we obtain a relation similar to 1 2 for the conditional expectation can we extend it to other measures with the framework we developed in our third paper and finally are these relations still valid if we substitute t with a stopping time our paper answers affirmatively to these three questions we keep the notations from our 10 and we prove that loge e f f inf e f f e d d log d d f 1 4 loge e f f inf u e f wu 1 2 u 2 h f 1 5 in 1 4 we assume that e fe f and the infimum is taken over the probability measures on w which are absolutely continuous with respect to and such that e d d ft 1 in 1 5 the infimum is taken over the u from w to h with adapted density which are in l 2 and such that 1 t u t 0 and we assume that e fe f and that there exists two conjugate integers p and q such that f lp and e f lq observe that we had to increase the integrability hypothesis on f from what we had for the non conditional case in fact the integrability hypothesis on f here are the same as in 20 finally we discuss the attainability of the infimum in 1 5 and we obtain a analog of pre kopa leindler type theorem for the conditional expectation with respect to however similarly as in 10 the convexity hypothesis seem quite restrictive 2 framework set n in we denotew c 0 1 rn the canonicalwiener space h 0 h s ds h l 2 0 1 the associated cameron martin space and w is the coordinate process we denote ft its filtration set a stopping time we assume that w is equipped with a probability measure for p 0 we denote lpa h u l p h u is ft adapted and d u l 0 a h u is d dt a s bounded for t 0 1 we define t u l 0 a h 7 0 h s 1 s tds 4 ke vin hartmann similarly we define u l 0 a h 7 0 h s 1 s ds i u l 0 a h 7 0 h s 1 s ds notice that d d i d d and define d i d the filtration of a process m will be denoted fmt the filtration of w will be simply denoted ft except if stated otherwise every filtration considered is completed with respect to if m is a martingale and v has a density whose stochastic integral with respect to m is well defined we will denote mv 1 0 v s dm s we also denote the wick exponential as follow mv exp 1 0 v s dm s 1 2 1 0 v s 2 d m s and for p 0 we denote gp m u l p a h e mu 1 we assume there exists a family of adapted processes wu u d and a brownian motion which verify the following conditions i is a brownian motion whose canonical filtration is identical to the canonical filtration of w ii w 0 w iii for every u d the law of wu under u is the same as the law of w under where u is defined by d u d u iv for every u d wu u v for every u v d wu w v w v u w v a s vi for every u d wu s s 1 w u s s 1 remark clearly d l a h so if u d e u 1 and u which was defined in condition iii is indeed a probability measure condition iii can be written as follow proposition 1 set u d for every bounded measurable function f we have e f e f w u u variational calculus on wiener space with respect to conditional expectations 5 next proposition ensures that the compositions written in iv and v are well defined proposition 2 set u d we have wu proof set f cb w bounded and measurable we have using proposition 1 ewu u f e u f w u e f w u u e f so wu u since we have wu wu which conclude the proof definition 1 set d a subset of g 0 such that the map u d 7 w u can be extended to d while verifying the following conditions i d d g 2 ii for any u d wu is adapted iii for every u d the law of wu under u is the same as the law of w under where u is defined by d d iv for every u d wu u v for every u v d such that v u w v d wu w v w v u w v a s vi there exists d such that d d l 0 a h d d g 2 and for every u d such that the equation u v wu has a solution in g 0 this equation has a solution in d vii for every u d such that u d wu s s

proof of the second assertion is the same as the case u d 6 ke vin hartmann definition 2 we define d as d d i l 0 a h 3 conditional expectation results we need the abstract bayes formula for a stopping time lemma 1 set a probability measure on w f such that denote l d d for every measurable f w r we have e f f e fl f e l f proof we can assume f is positive denote for s 0 1 l s e l fs the martingale stopping theorem gives l e l f set a f we need to prove that e 1 al e f f e 1 ae fl f we have e 1 al e f f e f 1 al e f f e f 1 ae f f e 1 ae f f e 1 af e 1 afl e 1 ae fl f proposition 4 set u d and f l 0 an f measurable function then a s f wu f w u consequently if u d we have a s f wu f proof for s 0 1 we have s wu s u s s su s s w su variational calculus on wiener space with respect to conditional expectations 7 consequently for h h sh w u sh w su and h w u h w u denote l 2 f f l 2 f is f measurable sh s 0 1 being a closed martingale we have e h f h since and w have the same filtration the vector space generated by h h h is dense in l 2 g l 2 7 e g f being a continuous surjection from l 2 to l 2 f the vector space generated by h h h is dense in l 2 f we denote e this vector space assume that f is bounded there exists fn e in which converges to f a s since wu and w u fn w u converges a s to f wu and fn w u converges a s to f w u which ensures the result in this case finally if f is only supposed to be f measurable there exists a sequence of bounded f measurable functions which converges to f and we proceed as above proposition 5 set l a density on w f such that l 0 a s denote m s e l fs and set v l 0 a h such that m s sv then the two following propositions are equivalent i v 0 a s ii e l f 1 a s proof the direct implication is trivial conversely m is a martingale with unit expectation and since m s 1 s 0 m r v r d r we have m 1 0 m r v r 2 dr proposition ii gives m s 1 s 1 0 a s so m 1 s s 1 0 a s l 0 so a s m s 0 for any s 0 1 and we have proposition i lemma 2 set u d and denote l dw u d we have e l f 1 consequently for any f l 1 wu we have ewu f f e f w u f e fl f 8 ke vin hartmann proof set b f we have e 1 bl e 1 b w u e 1 b w u e 1 b then the second assertion is a direct consequence of bayes formula 4 invertibility results definition 3 a measurable map u w w is said to be a s left invertible if and only if u and there exists a measurable map v w w such that v u iw a s a measurable map u w w is said to be a s right invertible if and only if there exists a measurable map v w w such that v and u v iw a s proposition 6 set u v w w measurable maps such that v u iw a s and v then u v iw u a s so if u we also have u v iw a s in that case we will say that u is a s invertible and we also have v proof see 10 proposition 7 set u d l 2 a h if w u is a s left invertible then there exists v d such that a s w v wu wu w v iw and dwu d v dw v d u proof everything is already known from 10 except the fact that v 0 this arises from the relation v s u s w v now we recall two very useful lemmas see 10 for the proof lemma 3 set u d l 2 a h and denote l dw u d we have a s l wue u fw u 1 1 theorem 1 set u d l 2 a h and denote l dw u d then wu is a s left invertible if and only if e l logl 1 2 e u 2 h moreover if wu is a s left invertible we have a s l wu u 1 now we give the results relative to the invertibility of wu when u 0 variational calculus on wiener space with respect to conditional expectations 9 proposition 8 set u d l 2 a h and denote l dw u d we have a s e l logl f 1 2 e u 2 h f proof we have wu s s 1 w s s 1 hence f f w u f w u 1 consequently using lemma 3 and jensen inequality we have e l logl f e logl w u f e loge u fw u 1 f e e log u fw u 1 f e log u f 1 2 e u 2 h f theorem 2 set u d l 2 a h and denote l dw u d then wu is a s left invertible if and only if a s e l logl f 1 2 e u 2 h f proof assume that the equality holds taking the expectation we have e l logl 1 2 e u 2 h so according to theorem 1 wu is a s left invertible conversely using again theorem 1 we have l wu u 1 so since u 0 e l logl f e logl w u f e log u f 1 2 e u 2 h f definition 4 we denote di u d wu is a s invertible di d d i 10 ke vin hartmann 5 approximation of absolutely continuous measures theorem 3 if is such that there exists p 1 such that d d lp and a s e d d f 1 there exists un di in such that dwun d d d in l p proof eventually sequentializing afterward we have to prove that for any 0 there exists u di such that dwu d d d lp the proof is divided in six steps step 1 we approximate d d with a density that is both lower and upper bounded denote l s e d d fs and for n in tn inf s 0 1 l s n l 1 d d and l being a closed martingale ltn is still a closed martingale which converges in l 1 to l tn e l 1 ftn so e l tn f e l tn 1 f ltn l tn e l 1 f tn e e l 1 f f tn 1 furthermore since l is a closed martingale e l 1 ftn n in is also a closed martingale so is uniformly integrable l tn converges to l 1 a s and jensen inequality gives 0 l tn p e l 1 ftn p e l 1 p ftn so l tn p is uniformly integrable and l tn converges in l p to l 1 so there exists n 0 in such that l tn 0 l 1 lr l tn 0 a 1 a converges a s to l tn 0 when a converges to 0 set a 0 1 we have 0 l tn 0 a 1 a l tn 0 1 variational calculus on wiener space with respect to conditional expectations 11 l tn 0 1 l p so according to the lebesgue theorem l tn 0 a 1 a converges to l tn 0 in l p and there exists a 0 1 such that l tn 0 a 1 a l tn 0 lp l tn 0 a 1 a is both lower bounded and upper bounded in l denote these bounds respectively d and d denote m s e l tn 0 a 1 a fs we can write m exp 0 r d r 1 2 0 r 2 dr with i l 0 a h since e m 1 f e ltn 0 f a 1 a 1 step 2 we prove that i l 2 a h set sn inf s 0 1 s 0 r 2 dr n sn is a sequence of stopping times which increases stationarily toward 1 we have using m 1 0 r m r d r e m s sn 1 2 e s sn 0 r 2 m r 2 dr d 2 e s sn 0 r 2 dr so e s sn 0 r 2 dr 1 d 2 e m s sn 1 2 2 d 2 1 d 2 hence passing to the limit e 1 0 r 2 dr step 3 we approximate with an element of i l a h define n s w 0 1 w 7 s 0 r w 1 0 sn r w dr and mn s exp s 0 n r d r 1 2 s 0 n r 2 dr n i l h and mn 1 e m 1 fsn so m n 1 n in is a closed martingale since m is one hence it converges a s to m 1 and it is uniformly integrable jensen inequality gives 0 mn 1 p e m 1 fsn p e m 1 p fsn 12 ke vin hartmann so mn 1 r is uniformly integrable and mn 1 converges to m 1 in lp consequently there exists n in such that mn 1 m 1 lp step 4 we approximate n with an element of d define n m s w 0 1 w 7 s 0 max min n r w m m dr and m n m s exp s 0 n m r d s 1 2 s 0 n m r 2 dr m n d and m n m 1 and converges to mn 1 in probability to prove that mn m 1 p is uniformly integrable it is sufficient to prove that mn m 1 is bounded in every lq with q 1 set q

mn m 1 m in converges to mn 1 in l p and there exists some m 0 such that mn m 1 mn 1 lp step 5 we approximate n m with a retarded shift so that w is a s invertible for a given 0 set s w 0 1 w 7 s 0 n m r 1 r ds and n s exp s 0 r d r 1 2 s 0 r 2 dr clearly d and n m in l 2 h when 0 which ensures that n 1 0 converges to mn m 1 in probability as in step 4 n 1 0 is bounded in every lq and so n 1 p 0 is uniformly integrable and n 1 0 converges to mn m 1 in lp there exists 0 such that n 1 mn m 1 lp variational calculus on wiener space with respect to conditional expectations 13 using triangular

set a w such that a 1 and for every w a w w w w and set w 1 w 2 a such that w w 1 w w 2 we have w w 1 w w 2 w 1 0 s w 1 ds w 2 0 s w 2 ds for any s 0 s w 1 s w 2 being adapted to filtration f s it implies that for s 0 2 s 0 r w 1 ds s 0 r w 2 ds and s w 1 s w 2 an easy iteration shows that w 1 w 2 since and w have the same filtrations and is a s path continuous we can write w t t s s 0 t q a s for every t 0 1 with t a measurable function from r q to r see 13 consequently we can write w t t 0 1 q t t 0 1 q a s with a measurable function from rq to rq denote a a w w w t w t 0 1 q t w t 0 1 q a 1 set w 1 w 2 a such that w w 1 w w 2 we have w 1 w 2 so w t w 1 t 0 1 q w t w 2 t 0 1 q w 1 t t 0 1 q w 2 t t 0 1 q w 1 and w 2 are continuous and coincide on 0 1 q so they are equal w is a s injective and so a s left invertible its inverse is of the form w v with v d and we have dw v d l n 1 so w v and w v w w w v a s 14 ke vin hartmann corollary 1 if is such that there exists q p 1 such

when n goes to infinity we have a s e ln logln f e d 0 d log d 0 d f and since f log d 0 d loge e f f a s e fln f e f d 0 d f so finally when n goes to infinity a s e f wun 1 2 un 2 h f e 0 f e d 0 d

bayes formula we only need to prove the case d 1 i e with the convention log and log 0 we denote a log a b log b c log c we begin with the case where there exists m m 0 such that we have a s m a b c m set s 0 1 for h k h we have a w sh 1 s k exp 1 2 sh 1 s k 2 h b wh exp 1 2 h 2 h s c w k exp 1 2 k 2 h 1 s so for u 1 u 2 d i a w su 1 1 s u 2 exp 1 2 su 1 1 s u 2 2 h b wh exp 1 2 h 2 h s c w k exp 1
