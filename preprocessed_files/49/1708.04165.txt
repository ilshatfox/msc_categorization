measures as new tools to study the asymptotic behaviour of sequences of pairs uj duj j for uj j bv r m under weak convergence these tools are then used to prove an integral representation theorem for the relaxation of the functional f u 7 f x u x u x dx u w 1 1 r m r d open to the space bv rm lower semicontinuity results of this type were first obtained by fonseca mu ller arch ration mech anal 123 1993 1 49 and later improved by a number of authors but our theorem is valid under more natural essentially optimal hypotheses than those currently present in the literature requiring principally that f be carathe odory and quasiconvex in the final variable the key idea is that liftings provide the right way of localising f in the x and u variables simultaneously under weak convergence as a consequence we are able to implement an optimal measure theoretic blow up procedure 1 introduction finding an integral representation for the relaxation f of the functional f u f x u x u x dx u w 1 1 rm rd open d m 1 1 to the space bv rm of functions of bounded variation where f rm rm d 0 has linear growth in the last variable is of great importance in the calculus of variations defined by the formula f u inf lim inf j f uj uj j w 1 1 rm and uj u bv r m where for the moment we do not specify the notion of convergence with respect to which f is computed the relaxation is the greatest functional on bv r m which is both less than or equal to f on w 1 1 rm and lower semicontinuous with respect to over bv rm from a theoretical point of view identifying f is a necessary step in the application of the direct method to minimisation problems with linear growth indeed if f is coercive minimising sequences for f are merely bounded in the non reflexive space w 1 1 rm and can only be expected to converge weakly in bv rm since candidate minimisers are only guaranteed to exist in this larger space there is a need to find a faithful extension of f to bv rm to which the direct method can be applied if they exist minimisers in bv rm of this extension of f can then be seen as weak solutions to the original minimisation problem over w 1 1 rm from the perspective of applications if f x y a g x y h x y a then the cauchy schwarz inequality implies that computing f provides a usually optimal lower bound for the limit of the sequence of singular perturbations e u 1 g x u x 2 dx h x u x u x 2 dx 2 which arise in a vast number of phase transition problems from the physical sciences 9 12 20 24 27 35 40 in this context minimisers of f can be seen as physically reasonable solutions to the highly non unique problem of minimising the coarse grain energy g x u x 2 dx which take into account the fact that transitions between phases should have an energetic cost 1 http arxiv org abs 1708 04165 v 3 2 filip rindler and giles shaw the first general solution to the relaxation problem was provided by fonseca mu ller in 22 see also ambrosio dal maso 6 for the u independent case motivated by problems in the theory of phase transitions the authors showed that if f is quasiconvex in the final variable satisfies g x y a f x y a cg x y 1 a for some g c rm 0 and strong localisation hypotheses see below hold then the relaxation of f with respect to the strong l 1 convergence in bv rm is given by f u f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x 3 where f is the recession function of f defined by f x y a lim supt t 1 f x y ta and kf u x inf 1 d 1 bd f x y y dy c bd rm bd u x if y nu x 0 is the surface energy density associated with f here d m 1 and we have used the usual decomposition du uld dsu dsu u u nuh d 1 ju d cu for the derivative du of a function u bv rm see for example 7 fonseca mu ller s result later improved in the subsequent papers 15 21 makes use of the blow up method to obtain a lower bound for f if uj j w 1 1 rm is such that f uj j is bounded then upon passing to a subsequence f x uj x uj x l d j must converge weakly inm to some radon measure next one computes lower bounds for the radon nikodym derivatives d dld d d dcu d dhd 1 ju via estimates of the form d dld x 0 lim inf r 0 lim j 1 rd 1 d b x 0 r f x uj x uj x dx 4 to obtain the inequality in 3 it suffices to bound the right hand side of 4 from below by f x 0 u x 0 u x 0 and to obtain analogous results for d dcu and d dhd 1 ju the authors of 22 achieve this by noting that the partial coercivity property g x y a f x y a cg x y 1 a combined with the rescaling in r of each uj allows for uj j to be replaced by a rescaled and truncated sequence wj j which is crucially weakly and l convergent in bv bd rm to a blow up limit z 7 u x 0 z fonseca mu ller s result confirms that as in the case for problems posed over w 1 p rm for p 1 quasiconvexity is still the right qualitative condition to require for variational problems with linear growth however it has been an open question as to whether the x y localisation hypotheses which have been used until now both for the results in 22 and for the substantial later improvements in 21 are truly necessary for 3 to hold up to an error which grows linearly in a these assumptions state that f must be such that f x 0 y 0 a f x y a whenever x y is sufficiently close to x 0 y 0 and that f x 0 y a f x y a uniformly in y for x 0 x sufficiently small it is known in the case of superlinear growth that for f to be weakly lower semicontinuous over w 1 p rm f need only be quasiconvex in the final variable carathe odory and satisfy the growth bound 0 f x y a c 1 a p for the situation where f has linear growth and the task is to find the relaxation of f to bv rm a short overview of available results is as follows in the scalar valued case where m 1 dal maso 17 obtained the scalar counterpart to 3 the term over ju admits a simpler form under the assumption of coercivity for the general liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 3 case where f f x y a if no coercivity is required of f the task of finding the l 1 relaxation f 1 is highly non trivial and involves the regularity of f in the x variable see for instance 5 in the vector valued case aviles and giga used the theory of currents to obtain 3 under the assumption that f is continuous convex in the final variable coercive and also satisfies a specific isotropy property see 10 11 the situation where f is quasiconvex in the final variable is harder the case where f is independent of both x and u was settled by ambrosio and dal maso 6 and kristensen together with the first author obtained 3 under just the assumption that f f x a is u independent carathe odory and such that f exists 31 for the u dependent case where f f x y a and f is quasiconvex in the final variable the only available results are the original identification in 22 due to fonseca and mu ller later improvements in 14 15 and finally the most recent results in fonseca and leoni 21 roughly these results require in addition to quasiconvexity that f is borel such that f exists and that for every x 0 y 0 r m and 0 there exists 0 such that x x 0 y y 0 implies f x 0 y 0 a f x y a 1 f x y a for all a r m d and that x x 0 implies f x 0 y a f x y a 1 f x y a for all y a rm rm d reasoning by analogy with the cases where f has superlinear growth over w 1 p rm or where f has linear growth and either m 1 so that f r rd r or f is u independent so that f f x a the implication is that 3 should hold under just the assumptions that f be quasiconvex in the final variable and possesses sufficient growth and regularity to ensure that the right hand side of 3 is well defined over bv rm this result is essentially our theorem a below to avoid the use of extraneous hypotheses we must pass from limj f x uj x uj x to limj f x 0 u x 0 uj x in 4 using only the behaviour of the sequence uj j rather than any special properties of the integrand in order to do this we must improve our understanding of the behaviour of weakly convergent sequences in bv rm particularly under the blow up rescaling x 7 x x 0 r these are much more poorly behaved than weakly convergent sequences in w 1 p rm for p 1 thanks to interactions between uj j and duj j in the limit as j see example 3 10 in the reflexive sobolev case powerful truncation techniques 23 30 mean that these interactions can be neglected in the sequence under consideration but no such tools are available in bv rm when m 1 the main contributions of this paper are the development of a new theory for understanding weakly convergent sequences and blow up procedures in bv rm together with the use of this theory to provide a new proof for the integral representation of the weak relaxation f of f to bv rm under weaker hypotheses this representation is valid for carathe odory integrands and does not require the x y localisation properties of f which have previously been used theorem a let f rm rm d r where d 2 and m 1 be such that i f is a carathe odory function whose recession function f exists in the sense of defini tion 2 8 and satisfies f 0 ii f satisfies a growth bound of the form c 1 y p h a f x y a c 1 y d d 1 a 5 for some c 0 p 1 d d 1 h c rm d satisfying h 0 and for all x y a rm rm d iii f x y q is quasiconvex for every x y rm then the sequential weak relaxation of f to bv rm is given by f u f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x 4 filip rindler and giles shaw the hypotheses of theorem a are essentially the optimal conditions under which f is guaranteed to be finite over all of bv rm and this result consequently identifies the exten sion of f to bv rm for the purposes of the direct method whenever such an extension is well defined theorem a can therefore be seen as a bv version of the optimal sobolev lower semicontinuity theorems obtained by acerbi fusco 1 and marcellini 33 example 2 9 below shows that unlike in the case where f f x a does not depend explicitly on u see 31 the positivity assumption f 0 is necessary for f to be finite and for a general integral formula to hold in fact assuming f 0 alone without also requiring the lower bound in ii is not enough see example 2 14 the situation here is subtle and ii can be improved slightly to a bound that is truly sharp in this regard at the expense of a more complicated statement see definition 2 13 and theorem 6 7 the hypotheses of theorem a are valid in situations where the x y localisation hypotheses used in 22 21 do not hold and also where partial coercivity fails for example the function f x y a 1 y 1 y 1 x a defined on bd rm rm d which violates h 4 and equa tion 1 15 in 22 and 21 respectively and functions of the form f x y a b x y a where b x y c rm rm d is bounded a b is the usual frobenius inner product between matrices and q denotes the positive part we emphasise that our f is the relaxation of f to bv r m with respect to sequential weak convergence whereas the relaxation of interest from the perspective of some applications and the one which is the subject of the earlier works works 22 8 15 21 11 is f 1 the relaxation of f with respect to strong l 1 rm convergence in bv rm in the absence of coercivity f 1 might be strictly less than f but it is always the case that f in these applications is partially coercive in the sense that g x y a f x y a cg x y 1 a for some continuous g rm 0 and c 0 in these circumstances it is therefore reasonable to expect that the problem of computing f 1 reduces to that of computing f locally in regions of r m where g x y 0 and this is in fact the strategy followed in previous works and so our work opens the possibility of new progress in this area indeed in the sequel to this paper 39 we use theorem a to derive an integral representation for f 1 valid under improved hypotheses on the integrand f theorem a assumes that f exists in a stronger sense than has been classically required in the literature see definition 2 8 where only the upper recession function f is used in fact the other properties required of f in 21 imply that their f must exist in the sense of definition 2 8 at every point of continuity for f that f must be lower semicontinuous and such that f q y q is continuous in x a for every y rm our proof of the lower semicontinuity component of theorem a is based on the idea of understanding joint limits for pairs uj duj j under weak convergence as objects in the graph space rm rather than solely in to do this we develop a theory of liftings ideas of this type were first introduced by jung jerrard in 28 which replaces functions u bv rm by graph like measures u gru du m r m rm d where gru x 7 x u x is the graph map of u using a reshetnyak type perspective construction the functional f can be generalised to one defined on the space of liftings the key point is that working in this more general setting means that we can think of sequences f x uj x uj x j as converging weakly to radon measures in m rm rather than merely in m this allows us to estimate f more precisely from below by computing radon nikodym derivatives at points x u x rm with respect to the total variation of the elementary lifting u rather than merely at points x with respect to the derivative du in order to carry out these computations we lay out a framework of generalized young measures associated to liftings under weak convergence that allows us to freeze the u variable for a wide class of functionals with linear growth by employing robust tools from geometric measure theory in particular we use a new type of besicovitch derivation theorem which allows us to differentiate in rm with liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 5 respect to graphical measures of the form gru m using very general families of sets b x r b y r rm see the discussion which precedes theorem 5 1 the idea of understanding the joint weak limits of sequences of pairs uj uj j by considering instead objects defined over the graph space rm has of course been explored before this strategy is successfully followed in 17 to identify f in the case m 1 and for m 1 with f coercive convex and isotropic in the final variable currents are used to identify f in 10 11 more generally graph like objects have been widely used to better understand nonlinear functionals in the calculus of variations and geometric measure theory in the context of currents in particular cartesian currents and varifolds 4 19 18 3 25 26 34 liftings seem to be situated at a sweet spot between the usual techniques of the calculus of variations and the higher abstractions of geometric analysis admitting a simple yet surprisingly powerful calculus which appears to be well suited for functionals of this type we hope that this tool will prove to be useful in a variety of related problems the final step in the proof of theorem a is to show that the lower bound for f obtained via our theory of liftings is optimal this is equivalent to constructing weak approximate recovery sequences u j c rm for f and 0 which are such that u u and lim sup j f u j f u perhaps surprisingly example 6 1 demonstrates that it is not always possible to construct genuine weak recovery sequences which satisfy uj u and lim j f uj f u even for f continuous and convex in the final variable in contrast to the u independent cases where f f x a or the scalar valued case where u r it can occur in the absence of coer civity that f admits a global minimiser for which no weakly convergent minimising sequence exists nevertheless we are able to construct approximate recovery sequences for f using a novel cut and paste technique based around the rectifiability of the measure kf u h d 1 ju combined with young measure techniques this paper is organised as follows after notation is established and preliminary results and concepts are introduced in section 2 liftings are defined and their theory developed in section 3 we prove a structure theorem establish the convergence and compactness properties of liftings and we show how f can be extended to a functional fl defined on the space of liftings in section 4 we develop a theory of young measures associated to liftings including representation and compactness theorems section 5 introduces tangent young measures and their associated jensen inequalities which together suffice to implement an optimal weak blow up procedure and deduce the lower semicontinuity component of theorem a finally in section 6 we construct approximate recovery sequences for f before combining these with the results section 5 to state and prove theorem 6 7 which is a slightly more general version of theorem a acknowledgements the authors would like to thank irene fonseca jan kristensen and neshan wickramasekera for several helpful discussions related to this paper

boundary the unit sphere respectively the open ball of radius r centred at x rk is b x r although we will sometimes write bk x r if the dimension of the ambient space needs to be emphasised for clarity the volume of the unit ball in rk will be denoted by k l k bk where lk is the usual k dimensional lebesgue measure we will write rm d for the space ofm d 6 filip rindler and giles shaw real valued matrices and idrm for the identity matrix living in r m m the map rm denotes the projection x y x and t x 0 r rd rd t x 0 r y 0 s rd rm rd rm represent the homotheties x 7 x x 0 r and x y 7 x x

rm and c rm consisting only of the functions satisfying u u x dx 0 are denoted by bv r m and c r m respectively we shall use the notation u when the domain of integration might not be clear from context as well as the abbreviation u x r u b x r we shall sometimes use subscripts for clarity when taking the gradient with respect to a partial set of variables that is if f f x y c 1 rm then xf x 1 f x 2 f xdf and yf y 1 f y 2 f ymf 2 1 measure theory for a separable locally convex metric space x the space of vector valued radon measures on x taking values in a normed vector space v will be written as m x v or just m x if v r the cone of positive radon measures on x is m x and the set of elements m x v whose total variation is a probability measure is m 1 x v the notation j will denote the usual weak convergence of measures and we recall that j is said to converge to strictly if j and in addition j x x given a map t from x to another separable locally convex metric space y the pushforward operator t m x v m y v is defined by t t c 0 y if t is continuous and proper then t is continuous when m x v and m y v are equipped with their respective weak or strict topologies we omit the proof of the following simple lemma lemma 2 1 let m x v m x satisfy and let t x y be a continuous injective map then it holds that dt dt t d d and t t given a function f x v r which is positively one homogeneous in the final variable that is f x ta tf x a for all t 0 and a v and a measure m x v we shall use the abbreviated notation x f x x f x d d x d x 6 we note that if t x y is an injection then applying lemma 2 1 to t and t lets us deduce y f y t y f y dt d t y d t y y f y dt dt y dt y x f t x d d x d x x f t x 7 if is a measure on x y then we recall that the disintegration of measures theorem see theorem 2 28 in 7 allows us to decompose as the generalised product where is the pushforward of onto x and is a almost everywhere defined parametrised measure here is defined uniquely via e f e x f d x for all borel subsets e x and f y liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 7 for k 0 the k dimensional hausdorff outer measure on rd is written as hk and if a b rd is a borel set satisfying hk a its restriction hk a to a defined by hk a q hk q a is a finite radon measure a set a rm is said to be countably h k rectifiable if there exists a sequence of lipschitz functions fi r k rd i n such that hk a i 1 fi r k 0 and hk rectifiable if in addition hk a we say that m rd v is a k rectifiable measure if there exists a countably hk rectifiable set a rd and a borel function f a v such that fhk a with a assumed to be countably hk rectifiable we can define the radon nikodym derivative for any m rd with respect to hk a given for hk almost every x a by d dhk a x lim r 0 b x r kr k 8 the function d dhk a is a radon nikodym derivative in the sense that d dhk a hk a is a k rectifiable measure and that we can decompose d dhk a hk a s where s satisfies d dhk a hk a s in analogy with the usual lebesgue radon nikodym decomposition a measure m rd v is said to be admit a k dimensional approximate tangent space at x 0 if there exists an unoriented k dimensional hyperplane r d and v such that r kt x 0 r h k bd strictly in m bd v as r 0 the existence of approximate tangent spaces characterises the class of rectifiable measures in the sense that m rd v possesses a k dimensional approximate tangent space at almost every x 0 r d if and only if is k rectifiable see theorem 2 83 in 7 the column wise divergence of a measure m rm rm d written as div or is an rd row vector valued distribution on rm defined by duality via the formula rm y d y rm y d y for all c c r m lemma 2 2 any m rm rm d satisfying div 0 column wise is non atomic that is a 0 for every a rm proof let g c 10 r m be arbitrary defining g y 1 g a y a for r we therefore have that 0 g div supp g g y d y noting that g a g a and g g we can let so that 1 supp g g 1 a g a pointwise before using the dominated convergence theorem to deduce g a a 0 by varying g a through rm we see that a 0 as required 2 2 bv functions given a function u bv rm we recall the mutually singular de composition du ld dcu dju of the derivative du where dcu hd 1 dju is absolutely continuous with respect to hd 1 ju and ju is the countably h d 1 rectifiable jump set of u each u bv rm admits a precise representative u rm which is defined hd 1 almost everywhere in ju the jump interpolant associated to u is then the function 8 filip rindler and giles shaw u 0 1 rm defined up to a choice of orientation nu for the jump set ju of u for hd 1 almost every x by u x u x 1 u x if x ju u x otherwise 9 the need to fix a choice of orientation for ju in order to properly define u is obviated by the fact that u will only appear in expressions of the form 1 0 u x d which are invariant of our choice of nu given the precise representative of a function u bv rm the function associated to its graph is denoted by gru x 7 x u x if is a measure on satisfying both hd 1 and ju 0 we will usually take du ju its pushforward under gr u then still makes sense as the radon measure gru on r m a sequence uj j bv r m is said to converge strictly to u bv rm if uj u in l 1 rm and duj du strictly in m r m d as j we say that uj converges area strictly to u if uj u in l 1 rm and in addition 1 uj x 2 dx d suj 1 u x 2 dx dsu as j it is the case that area strict convergence implies strict convergence in bv rm and that strict convergence implies weak convergence that none of these notions of convergence coincide follows from considering the sequence uj j bv 1 1 given by uj x x a j sin jx for some a 6 0 fixed this sequence converges weakly to the function x 7 x for any a r 0 strictly if and only if a 1 but since the function z 7 1 z 2 is strictly convex away from 0 never area strictly smooth functions are area strictly and hence strictly dense in bv rm indeed if u bv rm and u 0 is a family of radially symmetric mollifications of u then it holds that u u area strictly as 0 if rd is such that is lipschitz and compact then the trace onto of a function u bv rm is denoted by u l 1 rm the trace map u 7 u is norm bounded from bv rm to l 1 rm and is continuous with respect to strict convergence see theorem 3 88 in 7 if u v bv rm are such that u v then we shall sometimes simply say that u v on the following proposition a proof for which can be found in the appendix of 32 or lemma b 1 of 13 in the case of a lipschitz domain states that we can even require that smooth area strictly convergent approximating sequences satisfy the trace equality uj u proposition 2 3 for every u bv rm there exists a sequence uj j c rm with the property that uj u area strictly in bv r m as j and uj u moreover if u l rm we can assume that uj j c l rm and if u l rm then we can also require that supj uj l u l theorem 2 4 blowing up bv functions let u bv rm and write as the disjoint union du ju cu nu and du as the mutually singular sum du uld dju dcu uld du du d ju du ju d cu du cu where du denotes the set of points at which u is approximately differentiable ju denotes the set of jump points of u cu denotes the set of points where u is approximately continuous but liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 9 not approximately differentiable and nu satisfies du nu h d 1 nu 0 for r 0 and x du cu ju define u r bv bd rm by ur z cr u x rz u x r r cr 1 if x du r if x ju rd du b x r if x cu then the following trichotomy relative to ld du holds i for ld almost every x ur u x q strongly in bv bd rm as r 0 ii for hd 1 almost every x ju ur 1 2 u x u x if z nu x 0 u x u x if z nu x 0 strictly in bv bd rm as r 0 iii for dcu almost every x and for any sequence rn 0 the sequence u rn rn contains a subsequence which converges weakly in bv bd rm to a non constant limit function of the form x q x ddcu d dcu x x x 10 where bv 1 1 r is non constant and increasing moreover if urn n is a sequence converging weakly in this fashion then for any 0 there exists 1 1 such that the sequence u rn n converges strictly in bv b d rm to a limit of the form described by 10 in all three situations we denote limr u r or limn u rn by u 0 if the base blow up point x needs to be specified explicitly to avoid ambiguity then we shall write urx u rn x and u 0 x proof for points x du ju the conclusion of theorem 2 4 follows directly from the ap proximate continuity of u at ld almost every x and the existence of the jump triple u u nu for h d 1 almost every x ju for points x cu the weak precompactness of sequences urn n follows from the fact that u rn bd 0 and du rn bd 1 combined with the weak compactness of bounded sets in bv bd rm the representation of u 0 is non trivial and can only be obtained through the use of alberti s rank one theorem see theorem 3 95 in 2 it remains for us to show that given a weakly convergent sequence urn u and 0 we can always find 1 1 such that u rn n is strictly convergent in bv b d rm first note that we can assume that durn du 0 in m bd since see for instance theo rem 2 44 in 7 for arbitrary m rm d it is always true that tan x d d x tan x for almost every x now let 1 1 be such that du 0 bd 0 and du 0 bd 0 this implies that durn bd du 0 bd and hence that durn bd du 0 bd strictly since du rn du b x 0 rn du b x 0 rn t 0 du rn bd and du b x 0 rn du b x 0 rn 1 durn bd 1 du 0 bd as n we therefore see that du rn 1 du 0 bd t 0 du 0 bd strictly in bv bd rm as n 10 filip rindler and giles shaw as required for x ju the function u 0 gives a vertically recentered description of the behaviour of u near x it will be convenient to have a compact notation for also describing this behaviour when u is not recentered definition 2 5 for x ju define u bv bd rm by u z u x if z nu x 0 u x if z nu x 0 if the choice of base point x ju needs to be emphasised for clarity we shall write u x this definition is independent of the choice of orientation u u nu and for h d 1 almost every x ju the rescaled function u x r q converges strictly to u as r 0 the following proposition was first proved in 38 proposition 2 6 let rd be a domain with lipschitz boundary and assume that d 1 then the embedding bv rm l d d 1 rm is continuous when bv rm is equipped with the topology of strict convergence theorem 2 7 the chain rule in bv let u bv rm and let f c 1 rm rk be lipschitz it follows that v f u bv rk and that dv 1 0 f u x d du f u uld f u dcu f u f u nuh d 1 ju 2 3 integrands and compactified spaces definition 2 8 recession functions for f rm rm d r define the recession function f rm rm d r of f by f x y a lim x yk ak x y a tk f xk yk tkak tk whenever the right hand side exists for every x y a rm rm d independently of the order in which the limits of the individual sequences xk k yk k r m ak k r m d tk k 0 are taken and of the sequences used the definition of f implies that whenever it exists it must be continuous the following example demonstrates that the assumption in theorem a that f 0 cannot be relaxed independently of the other requirements on f example 2 9 define f c r 2 r 2 by f y a y 2 1 y 2 a 1 so that f f and let vk j w 1 1 1 1 r 2 be given by vj k x k 1 cos jx sin jx if x 0 2 j 0 otherwise for each fixed k it is clear that vj k 0 in bv 1 1 r 2 as j we can also see however that lim j 1 1 f vj k vj k dx lim j kj 2 j 0 k sin jx 1 k sin jx sin jx dx k 2 0 sin z 2 1 k sin z dz as k liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 11 it therefore follows that f 0 moreover for u c 1 bv 1 1 r 2 we can repeat the procedure above with uj k u vj k in place of vj k to obtain f on bv 1 1 r 2 defining v j k bv 1 1 2 r 2 by v j k x y vj k x since theorem a is only stated for d 1 and noting both that v 0 in bv 1 1 2 r 2 and 1 1 2 f v j k v j k dx 1 1 f vj k vj k dx we see that the conclusion of theorem a cannot hold for f and that no general integral formula is possible in this case not every function f rm d r with linear growth possesses a recession function in the sense of definition 2 8 as simple examples show this even holds for quasiconvex functions see 37 the upper recession function defined by f a lim sup t f ta t however always exist in r and is often denoted by f in the literature if f does exist in the sense of definition 2 8 then it is clear that f f define the sphere compactification rm of rm to be the locally convex metric space given by the disjoint union rm rm bm bm e e bm endowed with the metric induced by the bijection i rm bm i y y 1 y if y rm e if y e bm that is d rm y w i y i w and we have that f r m r is continuous if and only if f i 1 bm r is continuous the space m rm is now abstractly defined as the dual of c rm and can also be understood in terms of more familiar spaces of measures as follows m rm if and only if there exist m rm and m bm such that e e rm x e bm x e e bm for every borel subset e rm a function f defined on rm rm d admits a canonical extension h defined on the partially compactified space rm rm d where h is defined by h x y a f x y a for x y a rm rm d lim xj yj aj x y a f xj yj aj for x y a b m rm d 11 whenever the limit appearing in 11 exists independently of our choice of convergent sequence xj yj aj j r m rm d this method of extension is canonical in the sense that f c rm rm d occurs as the restriction f g rm rm d for some g c r m rm d if and only if g h given c rm we extend the addition operator y 7 y c continuously from rm to rm in this way by setting y c y c if y rm y if y bm 12 12 filip rindler and giles shaw definition 2 10 a function f c rm rm d is a member of e rm if there exists a function gf c r m bm d which is such that f x y a 1 a gf x y a 1 a for x y a rm rm d we see that f e rm implies f x y a c 1 a with c gf for all x y a rm rm d and that the recession function f exists in addition both f and f admit extensions to c rm rm d in the sense of 11 note however that as the example f y a exp y a 2 a demonstrates the existence of continuous extensions for f and f does not guarantee that f e rm for this to be the case we must also require that h x y a lim j f xj yj tjaj tj for x y a bm rm d 13 for any sequences xj yj aj j r m rm d tj j 0 such that xj yj aj x y a and tj where h is the extension of f to rm rm d given by 11 for f e rm this limit always exists by virtue of the continuity of gf at points x y a rm bm d our interest in integrands which admit extensions to rm rm d stems from the fact that in order to compute limits of the form lim j f x uj x uj x dx 14 for weakly convergent sequences uj j w 1 1 rm it is necessary that the extension h of f exists in some sense this can be seen by considering sequences of the form uj x j d 1 u jx where u cc r d rm is fixed which are such that uj x on supp uj l d it turns out see example 2 14 below in conjunction with proposition 4 18 that it is not sufficient to require that this extension exists as the limit 11 with f f on the other hand the requirement that h exist in the sense of the limit 13 is clearly stronger than necessary since it precludes us from considering any integrands which are unbounded in y such as f x y a y for which we can compute representation definition 2 11 below provides the optimal existence requirement for an extension of f from the perspective of computing 14 for as wide a class of integrands f as possible definition 2 11 given f rm rm d r define the extended recession function f rm rm d r of f by f x y a lim xj yj aj x y a tj yj d d 1 o tj f xj yj tjaj tj 15 whenever the right hand side exists for every x y a rm rm d independently of which sequences tj and xj yj aj j r m rm d are used provided that the constraint yj d d 1 o tj is satisfied that is lim sup j yj d d 1 tj the definition of f implies that whenever it exists f is continuous and also that f exists and satisfies f f rm rm d thanks to the existence of the limit 13 we see that f exists for all f e rm liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 13 lemma 2 12 let f rm rm d be such that f exists and f 0 then for any 0 and k rm there exists r 0 such that a r implies f x y a 1 a for all x y k if f is such that f exists with f 0 then for any 0 and k 0 there exists r 0 such that a r implies f x y a 1 a for all x and y rm satisfying y d d 1 k 1 a proof to prove the first statement assume for a contradiction that there exists a sequence of points xk yk ak k k r m d such that ak and f xk yk ak 1 ak for some fixed 0 by passing to a subsequence we can assume that xk yk x y in k and that a k ak 1 ak converges to some limit b b m d and tk 1 ak taking the limit in f xk yk ak 1 ak t 1 k f xk yk tka k we would then have that f x y b a contradiction to prove the second statement we proceed similarly by assuming that there exists a sequence of points xj yj aj j r m rm d such that aj yj d d 1 k 1 aj and f x y a 1 a letting tj 1 aj and passing to a subsequence we can assume that xj yj aj 1 aj j converges to some limit x y b r m bm d since yj d d 1 ktj the definition of f then implies that 0 f x y b limj f xj yj tjaj 1 aj tj which gives us the required contradiction definition 2 13 representation integrands a function f rm rm d r is said to be a member of r rm if f is carathe odory and its recession function f exists we shall primarily be interested in the following subsets of r rm defined by the growth bounds which are understood to hold uniformly in their respective parameters for all x y a rm rm d satisfied by their members f rl rm if there exists an exponent p 1 d d 1 and a constant c 0 such that f x y a c 1 y p a f rw rm if there exists c 0 and a function h rl rm with h 0 for which h exists and satisfies h 0 such that h x y a f x y a c 1 y d d 1 a 16 the classes rl rm and rw rm are named as such because they represent the largest classes of integrands to which we will refer whilst making statements about liftings and weakly convergent bv functions in particular the conclusion of theorem a also holds for all f rw rm the following example demonstrates that the lower bound which we require for members of rw rm is optimal in the sense that theorem a does not hold if we merely assume that f rm rm d r satisfies f x y a c 1 a is such that f exists with f 0 and is quasiconvex or even convex in the final variable example 2 14 for d 2 fix e bd 1 and let u w 1 1 c 0 b d bd 1 e 1 0 be a homeomorphism which can be extended continuously to a map defined on bd by setting u bd 0 for example we can take u to be the composition w 1 v of the dilation map v x bd x 1 x with the inverse of the stereographic projection w bd 1 e 1 0 r d it follows that x 7 u x u x is a homeomorphism between bd and the upper hemisphere y bd 1 y e 0 as u is not constant there exists c 0 b d r d 1 d such that bd u x x dx 0 14 filip rindler and giles shaw since bd 0 we can define the zero homogeneous function b c r d 1 r d 1 d by b y u u 1 y y if y e 0 u u 1 y y if y e 0 0 if y e 0 by construction we have that b satisfies bd u x b u x dx bd u x x dx 0 since the function b is zero homogeneous and u x 6 0 for x bd for every x bd it holds that s u x b su x s u x b u x sd d 1 u x d d 1 for all s sufficiently large we can therefore find s 1 such that if we define u w 1 1 c 0 b d rd 1 by u x su x it holds that u x u x d d 1 u x b u x dx 0 17 now define f rd 1 r d 1 d r by f x y a y d d 1 log a b y y d d 1 1 if a b y y d d 1 a b y if a b y y d d 1 where a b i j aijbij denotes the frobenius product defined on matrices in r d 1 d note that f c rd 1 r d 1 d satisfies f y a 2 b a and is such that f exists and is given by the formula f y a 0 if a b y 0 a b y if a b y 0 in particular f 0 on rd 1 r d 1 d we also note that whilst f extends continuously to a non negative function defined on all of rd 1 r d 1 d in the sense of 11 with f f f does not exist according to definition 2 11 finally we claim that f y q is convex on r d 1 d for every y rd 1 this follows from the fact that the function t 7 a log t a 1 if t a t if t a is convex on r for each fixed a 0 and that the map a 7 a b y is linear next define the functional f w 1 1 bd rd 1 r by f u bd f u x u x dx and for each r 0 1 define ur w 1 1 c 0 b d rd 1 by ur x r 1 du x r if x r 0 if x r using the change of variables z x r the fact that limr 0 r log r 1 0 and the zero homogeneity of b we can compute lim r 0 f ur u z b u z u z d d 1 u z b u z dz liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 15 u z b u z u z d d 1 u z d d 1 dz by virtue of 17 then we have that limr 0 f ur 0 it is easy to see that ur 0 in bv bd rd 1 as r 0 and so we deduce that f 0 0 in fact by replacing u with k u repeating the procedure above and then letting k we can even see that f 0 on the other hand since f y 0 0 for all y rd 1 and f 0 on rd 1 r d 1 d the integral functional given in the statement of theorem a must be non negative at u 0 hence the conclusion of theorem a cannot hold for the integrand f defined above 2 4 functionals and surface energies for f r rm we define the extended func tional f bv rm r by f u f x u x u x dx 1 0 f x u x ddsu d dsu x d d dsu x 18 where u is the jump interpolant defined above by 9 this choice of extension for f to bv rm is different to the one discussed in section 1 where f is extended to bv rm by f and is used for technical reasons whilst the method of extension for f by relaxation is the right choice from the point of view of seeking existence of minimisers f is not continuous with respect to any convergence with respect to which c rm is dense in bv rm see example 6 1 and hence not an ideal functional to work with with respect to analysis in bv rm by contrast for integrands f rw r m which need not be quasiconvex in the final variable theorem 2 15 below states that f as defined by 18 is the area strictly continuous extension of u 7 f x u x u x dx from w 1 1 rm and even c rm to bv rm proposition 2 3 therefore implies that theorem a can equivalently be seen as identifying the weak relaxation of this continuously extended f from bv rm to bv rm which is the approach that we take in what follows theorem 2 15 let rd be a bounded domain with lipschitz boundary and let f r r m satisfy the growth bound f x y a c 1 y d d 1 a for all x y a rm rm d 19 then the functional f bv rm r is area strictly continuous theorem 2 15 is proved under slightly more general hypotheses in theorem 5 2 of 38 given u bv rm and x ju define the class of functions au x by au x c l bd rm u x on b d 20 where u x is as given in definition 2 5 for f r r m and u bv rm the surface energy density kf u is defined for x ju via kf u x inf 1 d 1 bd f x z z dz au x 21 lemma 2 16 below shows that kf u is always h d 1 measurable and hence that the integral ju kf u x dh d 1 x is always well defined for every u bv rm lemma 2 16 if f r rm then kf u is h d 1 ju measurable and equal h d 1 ju almost everywhere to an upper semicontinuous function 16 filip rindler and giles shaw proof first fix a triple u u nu ju r m rm bd such that nu orients ju and u u are the one sided jump limits of u with respect to nu fix also 0 the triple u u nu is borel and hence dju measurable and so lusin s theorem implies that there exists a compact set k ju such that d ju ju k and u u nu is continuous when restricted to k let x k and xj j k be such that xj x for each j n let rj b d bd be a rotation mapping nu x to nu xj such that rj idrd as j and let sj r m rm be a sequence of linear maps mapping u x to u xj and u x to u xj such that sj idrm as j such a choice of rj j sj j is possible by the fact that x xj k now for 0 let au x be such that 1 d 1 bd f x z z dz kf u x define j c bd rm by j z sj rjz and note that j au xj by the convergence properties assumed of rj and sj we have that j strictly in bv b d rm as j next define j m r m rm d by j xj jl d b d x l d b d it can easily be seen that j converges strictly in m b d rm rm d to as j using reshetnyak s continuity theorem and the positive one homogeneity of f we therefore deduce bd f xj j z j z dz b rm f z y d j d j z y d j z y b rm f z y d d z y d z y bd f x z z dz as j by our choice of and the boundary condition satisfied by each j we therefore have that kf u x lim j 1 d 1 bd f xj j z j z dz lim sup j kf u xj it follows from the arbitrariness of x k and 0 that kf u is upper semicontinuous when restricted to k finally define f ju 0 by f x kf u x if x k otherwise and note that f inf 0 f is equal tokf u at d ju almost every x ju and henceh d 1 ju almost every x ju the conclusion now follows from the fact that the pointwise infimum of a collection of upper semicontinuous functions is upper semicontinuous and hence measurable corollary 2 17 if f r rm satisfies f 0 and u bv rm is such that ju kf u x dh d 1 x then kf u h d 1 ju m is a d 1 rectifiable measure proof this follows directly from lemma 2 16 combined with the discussion about rectifiability in section 2 1 liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 17 3 liftings in this section we develop a theory of liftings in turn we investigate their functional ana lytic properties their relationship to bv functions a structure theorem some blow up results and a discussion of how integral functionals over bv rm can be represented in terms of liftings two separate spaces are introduced the space of liftings l rm and the space of approximable liftings al rm l rm the space l rm is larger than strictly necessary for our purposes but has good compactness properties and is sufficiently well behaved that working in this setting of extra generality allows for a cleaner presentation of most of the results described here and in sections 4 and 5 the exceptions to this rule is the jensen inequal ities for f derived in theorems 5 3 and 5 5 section 5 2 for which we must work within the more restrictive class al rm the assumption that rd with d 2 is used in this paper only in proposition 2 6 and the young measure theory developed in section 4 consequently the results presented here are also valid for domains r 3 1 functional analysis and the structure theorem definition 3 1 a lifting is a measure m rm rm d for which there exists a function u bv r m such that the chain rule formula x x u x dx rm y x y d x y 0 for all c 1 0 r m 22 holds the space of all liftings is denoted by l rm weak convergence of liftings in l r m means weak convergence of the liftings in considered as measures in m rm rm d definition 3 1 was first given by jung jerrard in 28 where the authors initiated the study of elementary liftings which they refer to as minimal liftings introduced below in definition 3 5 this paper also contains the first proofs of lemma 3 2 and proposition 3 15 below our proofs for these results are new and in the case of proposition 3 15 are obtained as a corollary of the structure theorem theorem 3 11 which does not feature in 28 the following lemma implies that each l rm is associated to a unique u bv r m satisfying 22 we shall refer to this u as the barycentre of writing u lemma 3 2 if l rm satisfies 22 then it holds that du in m r m d and du in m in particular if l rm then the element u bv r m with respect to which verifies 22 is unique proof let x y f x y where f c 0 is arbitrary so that x y f y f idrm now let r r 0 c 1 c r m be a family of cut off functions satisfying 1 b 0 r r 1 b 0 3 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 as r setting r x y r y x y we see that r c 0 r m supr r and r pointwise as r the chain rule 22 then implies that x r x u x dx rm y r x y d x y 0 letting r and using the dominated convergence theorem we therefore obtain 0 f x u x dx rm f x idrm d x y f x u x dx f x d x 18 filip rindler and giles shaw hence after an integration by parts f x ddu x f x d x for all f c 1 0 which implies the first result for a b we can now compute a a r m sup h 0 bh bh b r d rm is a partition of a rm sup h 0 ah r m ah b r d is a partition of a sup h 0 du ah ah b r d is a partition of a du a from which it follows that du as desired lemma 3 3 compactness for l let j j l r m be such that supj j r m then there exists a subsequence jk k j j and a limit l r m such that jk in m rm rm d and jk in bv r m moreover the map 7 is sequentially weakly continuous from l rm to bv r m and the space l rm is sequentially weakly closed proof lemma 3 2 implies that j j is bounded in bv r m whenever j j is bounded in m rm rm d if j j l r m satisfies supj j r m we can therefore use the sequential weak compactness of bounded sets in m rm rm d and bv r m to pass to a subsequence jk k j j converging weakly in m r m rm d to a limit and such that jk u for some u bv r m taking the limit in 22 as j and using the dominated convergence theorem it follows that the pair u satisfies 22 and hence that l rm with u the space l rm is therefore sequentially weakly closed to see that 7 is sequentially weak continuous note that if j j l r m is such that j in l rm as j then j j must be uniformly bounded in m r m the preceding discussion therefore implies that upon passing to a further subsequence j u for some u bv r m passing to the limit again in 22 we find that u and so since this argument can be applied to any subsequence of j j we reach the desired conclusion corollary 3 4 if j in l rm then gr j ld gr ld strictly in m 1 r m proof since weak convergence in bv rm implies strong l 1 rm convergence lemma 3 3 implies that j in l 1 rm whenever j in l rm using the dominated convergence theorem we therefore deduce that for any cb r m x y d gr j l d x y x j x dx x x dx x y d gr ld x y as j which is what was to be shown liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 19 definition 3 5 elementary liftings given u bv r m the elementary lifting u l rm associated to u is defined by u du ddu d du 1 0 u d that is u 1 0 x u x d ddu x for all c 0 r m where u is the jump interpolant defined in section 2 that u l rm follows from the chain rule for bv functions if u bv rm and c 10 r m then the composition gru q u q is an element of bv satisfying gru 0 by stokes theorem this implies dd gru x gru n x dh d 1 x 0 where n is the inwards pointing normal orientation vector for applying the chain rule theorem 2 7 to gru and writing x y we see that d gru 1 0 gru d d gru 1 0 q u q d id rd l d du q u q id rd u l d q u q 0 dcu 1 0 q u q d 0 dju x q u q l d y q u q u q l d y q u q d cu 1 0 y q u q d dju integrating over with respect to x we deduce x x u x dx rm y x y d u x y 0 as required remark 3 6 we note here that 22 and definition 3 5 both make sense for u bv rm rather than just bv r m and m rm rm d and could be used to define lift ings associated to arbitrary bv functions the downside for this extra generality is that the barycentre 0 of the zero lifting is no longer unique and more importantly that the control supj j r m no longer enforces supj j bv as a result the map 7 is no longer continuous and lemma 3 3 is no longer true instead the discussion surrounding 27 in section 3 4 shows how the behaviour of arbitrary weakly convergent sequences in bv rm can be described in terms of liftings as we have chosen to define them definition 3 7 approximable liftings a lifting is said to be approximable if it arises as the weak limit of a sequence of elementary liftings the space of all approximable liftings is denoted by al rm al rm l rm w lim uj for some uj j bv r m note that despite being defined as a sequential closure it is an open question as to whether al rm is either sequentially weakly closed or weakly closed since weak topologies are not in general metrizable on unbounded sets example 3 8 demonstrates that in the one dimensional case at least the inclusion al rm l rm is strict 20 filip rindler and giles shaw example 3 8 there exists l 1 1 r 2 such that al 1 1 r 2 consequently al 1 1 r 2 and l 1 1 r 2 do not coincide proof first we claim that any al 1 1 r 2 must satisfy supp 1 1 b 0 r for some r 0 to see this let uj j bv 1 1 r 2 be such that uj in m 1 1 r 2 r 2 since the sequence uj j is norm bounded in bv 1 1 r 2 the one dimensional sobolev em bedding theorem implies that supj uj letting r 0 be such that uj r for all j n we see that for all c 0 1 1 r 2 satisfying 1 1 b 0 r 0 x y d uj x y 1 1 1 0 x u j x d ddu x 0 letting j we deduce x y d x y 0 for all c 0 1 1 r 2 with 1 1 b 0 r 0 and hence that 1 1 r 2 b 0 r 0 which implies supp 1 1 b 0 r as required next define k m 1 1 r 2 r 2 for each k n by x y d k x y k 2 0 0 k cos z sin z sin z cos z dz clearly supp k 0 b 0 k k 1 1 r 2 2 k and since y x y d k x y k 2 0 y 0 k cos z sin z sin z cos z dz 2 0 0 k cos q sin q z dz 0 k cos 2 sin 2 0 k cos 0 sin 0 0 for every c 10 1 1 r 2 we have that k l 1 1 r 2 with k 0 for each k defining i k k 3 k 23 we have that m 1 1 r 2 r 2 with 0 b 0 k 2 k 2 0 for each k moreover since the sum 23 is strongly convergent in m 1 1 r 2 r 2 we see that y x y d x y lim n n k 1 y x y d k x y 0 for every c 10 1 1 r 2 which implies that l 1 1 r 2 with 0 since 0 b 0 k 0 for every k n however this implies that supp 6 1 1 b 0 r for any r 0 and so 6 al 1 1 r 2 the following is a direct corollary of lemma 3 3 combined with definition 3 7 corollary 3 9 lifting generation from bv let uj j bv r m be a bounded sequence with uj u in bv r m then there exists a non relabelled subsequence and a limit al rm with u such that uj in al rm liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 21 example 3 10 below demonstrates how non elementary liftings can arise as weak limits of sequences of elementary liftings and shows that this phenomenon gives rise to behaviour for integrands which is very different to the u independent and scalar valued cases example 3 10 define uj j w 1 1 1 1 r 2 by uj x 1 0 1 1 0 x cos jx sin jx 1 0 j x 1 0 1 j 1 x 1 j 2 1 0 0 1 and note that uj u 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 in bv 1 1 r 2 by passing to a non relabelled subsequence if necessary we can assume that uj for some al 1 1 r 2 with u 0 let cc 1 1 0 0 1 be such that t s 1 for t s 1 2 1 2 0 2 and define c 0 r 2 by x y x y y 2 1 2 we can compute for j 4 1 1 r 2 x y d uj x y j j 0 cos jx 2 j sin jx 1 j 2 1 2 sin jx cos jx dx thus lim j 1 1 r 2 x y d uj x y 0 cos z sin z 2 1 2 sin z cos z dz and so by the construction of 1 1 r 2 x y d 0 however we also see that 1 1 r 2 x y d u 0 x y 1 0 2 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 d 1 0 4 2 4 2 2 0 d 6 0 from which we can conclude that 6 u 0 3 2 the structure theorem we now investigate the structure of liftings l rm and in particular how a general lifting must relate to the elementary lifting u where u it is clear that u l rm with u u whenever m rm rm d satisfies divy 0 column wise divergence since divy 0 implies that f x yg y d x y 0 for all f c 0 and g c 1 0 r m it turns out that every l rm can be written in this form theorem 3 11 structure theorem for liftings if l rm with u then admits the following decomposition into mutually singular measures u ju r m gs moreover gs m rm rm d satisfies divy gs dju nu u u u u and it is graph singular with respect to u in the sense that gs is singular with respect to all measures of the form gru where m satisfies both h d 1 and ju 0 22 filip rindler and giles shaw proof since and u both satisfy the chain rule 22 we can test with functions of the form f g for f c 10 g c 1 0 r m to obtain xf x g u x dx rm f x yg y d u x y 0 and xf x g u x dx rm f x yg y d x y 0 taking the difference of these two equations then leads us to the identity rm f x yg y d u x y 0 for all f c 1 0 g c 1 0 r m now write u and disintegrate u for some weakly measurable parametrised measure 7 m 1 rm rm d so that f x rm yg y d x y d x 0 for every f c 10 and g c 1 0 r m varying f through a countable dense subset of c 0 we deduce rm yg y d x y 0 for almost every x since g c 10 r m was arbitrary it follows that divy x 0 column wise divergence for almost every x and hence that divy u 0 defining gs u ju r m we therefore immediately obtain from the definition of u that divy gs divy u ju r m dju divy ddju d dju 1 0 u d 24 abbreviating x ddju d dju x 1 0 u x d we can compute for almost every x g divy x g ddju d dju x 1 0 u x d 1 0 g u x ddju d dju x d 1 0 g u x d u x u x u x u x nu x 1 0 g u x d u x u x nu x u x u x 1 0 d d g u x d nu x u x u x g u x g u x u x u x nu x which implies divy ddju d dju x 1 0 u x d nu x u x u x u x u x and hence that divy gs dju nu u u u u as required liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 23 to show that gs is graph singular with respect to u we argue as follows let m satisfy hd 1 ju 0 and let e be a set such that e the precise representative u x is defined for all x e and e ju by lemma 2 2 x u x 0 for almost every x and so since e ju gs gru e u gru e e x u x d x 0 because gru gr u e gru r m it follows that gs and gru charge disjoint sets which suffices to prove the claim since u ju r m gru ul d dcu is a u graphical measure we therefore also deduce that u ju r m gs as required as we have discussed no more can be said about the structure of l rm beyond the conclusion of theorem 3 11 in general but a lot more can be said for the special cases where either m 1 or du for u corollary 3 12 every lifting l r is elementary u for some u bv r proof if m 1 then the operators divy and y coincide and so 24 now states y gs y u ju r disintegrating gs u ju r gs u ju r we therefore have that y x 0 for gs u ju r almost every x since any distribution whose gradient vanishes must be constant it must follow that x cxl 1 for some constant cx r d as x m 1 r rd is a finite measure however we see that cx 0 and hence that gs u ju r m it then follows from theorem 3 11 that u ju r gs u as required if du lemma 3 2 implies that a r m du a u a rm for any borel set a theorem 3 11 then yields u a rm a rm u a ju r m gs a rm in particular if a ju then u a ju r m u a rm and we deduce gs a rm 0 for all borel sets a ju thus gs ju r m and hence ju r m u ju r m gs dju disintegrating gs dju for some weakly dju measurable parametrised measure m 1 rm rm d we see that the second part of theorem 3 11 now reads divy x nu x u x u x u x u x for d ju almost every x ju 25 lemmas 3 13 and 3 14 below which are special cases of theorems 5 3 and d 1 respectively from 16 and for which simplified proofs can be found in 38 show that since x r m 1 the identity 25 in fact forces rm g y d x y 1 0 g u x ddu d du x d and hence that u 24 filip rindler and giles shaw lemma 3 13 let a b rm with a 6 b c bd and m 1 rm rm d be such that div c b a b a in m r m rd then a b rm where a b denotes the closed straight line segment between a and b lemma 3 14 let a b rm with a 6 b and let m rm rm d be such that div 0 and rm a b 0 then 0 applying lemma 3 13 to x and then applying lemma 3 14 to the measure x ddu d du x 1 0 u x d we therefore arrive at the following proposition proposition 3 15 let l rm with u be minimal in the sense that rm du then must be elementary u in particular if uj u in bv r m strictly then uj u strictly in l r m proof it remains only to show the second statement this follows from the fact that the strict convergence of uj to u implies that limj uj r m du thus for any non relabelled subsequence converging to a limit we can apply lemma 3 2 and the lower semi continuity of the total variation on open sets to deduce that du rm du it follows that u and since this argument can be applied to any subsequence of uj j that the entire sequence converges uj u 3 3 rescaled liftings and tangent liftings lemma 3 16 rescaled liftings let l rm and for r 0 and x 0 d c j let t x 0 r s b x 0 r r m bd rm be the homothety given by t x 0 r s x x 0 r s y x 0 r r where x 0 r b x 0 r x dx defining the measure r s m bd rm rm d by r s s rd t x 0 r s we have that r s l bd rm with r s z s x 0 rz x 0 r r gr r s l d b d 1 rd t x 0 r s gr l d b x 0 r and r s bd rm s rd b x 0 r r m in addition r s al bd rm if al rm and u r s s cr u r where ur and cr are defined as in theorem 2 4 in the special case where s cr

such that u rn u 0 and u rn u 0 strictly as n proof combine theorem 2 4 with proposition 3 15 3 4 perspective constructions and integral representations given an integrand f r rm define the corresponding perspective integrand pf rm rm d r r by pf x y a t t f x y t 1 a if t 0 f x y a if t 0 similarly the perspective measure p m rm rm d r of a lifting l rm is defined by p gr l d note that pf is positively one homogeneous in the a t argument corollary 3 4 implies that p j p if j in l rm and letting gr l d s be the radon nikodym decomposition of with respect to gr ld that d d gr ld follows from theorem 3 11 we also see that p admits the following decomposition with respect to gr ld p 1 gr ld s 0 thus p j p strictly in m r m rm d r if and only if j and j x 2 1 dx s j r m x 2 1 dx s rm as j note that this holds for uj j and u whenever uj u area strictly in bv r m recalling the notation introduced in 6 in section 2 we see that these perspective construc tions permit the

measures and lower semicontinuity 27 we therefore recover f u fl u for u bv r m for a general element u bv rm we can still write f u rm pf x y u p u u u u x dx 27 lemma 3 18 below and proposition 4 18 in the next section imply that whenever uj j is a sequence converging weakly to u in bv rm we can expect that lim j rm pf x y uj p uj uj rm pf x y u p uj uj 0 for a large class of integrands f and so for these we can gain a complete understanding of the functional f on all of bv rm by considering fl on l r m lemma 3 18 if f e rm j j l r m is a bounded sequence and cj j r m is such that cj c as j then lim j rm pf x y cj p j rm pf x y c p j 0 proof we claim first that f e rm implies that pf c rm rm d r the continuity of pf at points x y a t rm rm d r 0 is clear from the continuity of f whereas continuity at points x y a 0 for x y a rm rm d follows directly from the definition of pf combined with the fact that f exists in the stronger sense that the limit 13 always returns f as noted in

measures are compactness tools associated to weakly convergent sequences j j l r m whose purpose is to allow us to compute the limiting behaviour of sequences pf x y p j j for as large a class of integrands f as possible simultaneously crucially every bounded sequence j j l r m can upon passing to a non relabelled subsequence be assumed to generate a young measure with the key property that lim j pf x y p j f for all f e rm where the duality product f is defined below in section 4 1 together with the localisation principles developed in section 5 the theory developed in this section will lead to a proof of the lower semicontinuity component of theorem a the plan for this section is as follows first in section 4 1 young measures over rm with target space rm d are defined abstractly the elementary young measures associated to 28 filip rindler and giles shaw elements of l rm are then introduced as are the concepts of young measure convergence generation and the duality product q q section 4 2 is concerned with the proof of the young measure compactness theorem theorem 4 13 which shows that any bounded sequence j j l r m possesses a subsequence generating a young measure section 4 3 then introduces several techniques for manipulating young measures and finally section 4 4 proves that young measures can be also used to gain insight into limj pf x y p j for integrands f from the larger class r rm 4 1 young measures in what follows we will make use of the compactified space rm r m bm and the associated spaces of continuous functions and measures introduced and discussed in section 2 definition 4 1 generalised young measures an rm rm d young measure is a quadruple such that 1 m rm satisfies l d and m rm 2 rm m 1 rm d and rm m 1 bm d are parametrised measures which are weakly measurable with respect to and respectively that is x y 7 x y a is measurable for every borel set a r m d and x y 7 x y b is measurable for every borel set b bm d 3 x y 7 q x y l 1 rm 4 satisfies the poincare condition rm y d d 1 d x y md rm q x y d x y r m d d 1 28 where md inf du u bv r m and u ld d 1 1 we denote the set of all rm rm d young measures by y rm rm d when there is no risk of confusion we will usually abbreviate this to y we shall refer to and as the reference and concentration measures of respectively and as the regular and singular oscillation measures of recall from definition 2 10 that e rm is defined to be the set of functions f c r m rm d for which there exists gf c r m bm d satisfying f x y a 1 a gf x y a 1 a under the duality product f rm f x y q x y d x y rm f x y q x y d x y 29 for f e rm young measures can be seen as continuous linear functionals on e rm whilst conditions 1 2 and 3 are natural from the point of ensuring that 29 is well defined for integrands f e rm 4 is a technical condition used in the proofs of corol lary 4 11 and proposition 4 18 to ensure that the sequence of measures j j n is tight in m rm whenever the sequence j j n y r m rm d converges in the sense of definition 4 3 below definition 4 2 elementary young measures given a lifting l rm the elementary young measure y rm rm d associated to is defined by gr l d x y x s x y d s d s x y where s gr l d gr d c gs liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 29 is the lebesgue singular part of if l rm it follows that we have the representation pf p f for f e rm note that if u is an elementary lifting and u is the elementary young measure associated to u then d su 1 0 u d x y p x p x ddsu d dsu x so that f u pf p u f u definition 4 3 young measure convergence we say that a sequence j j y r m rm d weakly converges to y rm rm d as j written j if f j f as j for every f e rm if y is such that j for some sequence of elementary young measures associated to j j l r m then we simply write j y saying that j j generates equivalently j j generates if and only if lim j pf x y p j f for all f e rm definition 4 4 young measure mass the young measure mass y of an element y rm rm d is defined by y 1 q where 1 q e rm denotes the function x y a 7 a the set of young measures y rm rm d is not a linear space and so q y cannot be a norm in the technical sense of being positively homogeneous and subadditive nevertheless q y bounded sequences in y r m rm d share the same compactness properties as norm bounded sequences in banach spaces we note that the poincare condition 28 can now be rephrased as rm y d d 1 d x y d 1 d md y definition 4 5 ly the space ly rm y rm rm d is defined to be the weak sequential closure of the set of elementary young measures associated to liftings that is ly rm if and only if there exists a sequence j j l r m such that j y definition 4 6 the space aly rm ly rm is defined to be the weak sequential closure of the set of elementary young measures associated to elementary liftings that is aly rm if and only if there exists a sequence uj j l r m such that uj y since the convergence y preserves more information than weak convergence in the space of liftings we can show that aly rm is sequentially closed under weak convergence in y rm rm d even though it is not known whether al rm is sequentially weakly closed in m rm rm d lemma 4 7 the spaces ly rm and aly rm are closed under weak young measure convergence 30 filip rindler and giles shaw proof since 1 q e rm j in y implies that j y y thus if j j ly r m is a mass bounded sequence such that j in y we can assume that each j is the limit of a sequence k j k n of elementary young measures associated either to liftings in the case ly rm or elementary liftings in the case aly rm satisfying supk k j y 1 j y 2 y we can then use a diagonal argument to extract a sequence kj j j of elementary young measures which generates let ly rm and j j l r m be such that j y testing with integrands f x y a x y a e rm for c 0 r m we see that j j is a weakly convergent sequence in m rm rm d whose limit we denote by since rm x y d x y id it follows that is determined solely by independently of the choice of generating sequence j j and that the following definition is coherent definition 4 8 the barycentre of a young measure y rm rm d is the measure m rm rm d defined by id for all c 0 r m for elements ly rm if and u we will use the notation j k u clearly if is the elementary young measure associated to l rm then it is also clear that l rm whenever ly rm and that al rm whenever aly rm it follows immediately that j in l rm whenever j in ly rm note that it need not be the case that aly rm if al rm the following corollary is now a direct consequence of corollary 3 4 combined with the identity 1 x y d x y for c 0 r m corollary 4 9 if ly rm then gr j k ld 4 2 duality and compactness for f e rm let gf c r m bm d be such that f x y a 1 a gf x y a 1 a according to definition 2 10 define the linear operator s e rm c rm bm d by sf gf and note that s admits an inverse s 1 c rm bm d e rm given by s 1 g x y a 1 a g x y a 1 a for x y a rm rm d 30 it follows that s is a linear isomorphism between e rm and c rm bm d and so e rm can be given the structure of a banach space by setting f e sf c rm bm d we therefore have that s 1 hereafter denoted by s is itself an isometric isomorphism between e rm and m rm bm d via the riesz representation theorem in liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 31 particular note that if y rm rm d then y 1 1 q s 1 1 q s rm bm d ds x y b s rm bm d 31 for all y with s and s so defined the duality product between young measures y r m d rm d and integrands f e rm can be understood in terms of a more familiar integral product between measures and continuous functions f rm bm d sf x y b ds x y b 32 given f rl rm or f rw rm we can define sf rm bm d r by analogy via sf x y b 1 b f x y b 1 b if x y b rm bm d f x y b if x y b rm bm d so defined sf is always carathe odory on rm bm d and is continuous at each point x y b rm bm d moreover if f is continuous and satisfies f x y a c 1 a then it is clear that sf cb r m bm d proposition 4 10 the set s y rm rm d consists precisely of those measures m rm bm d that satisfy the conditions bm bm d 0 33 rm bm d 1 b y d d 1 d x y b d 1 d md rm bm d 34 where md is as given in definition 4 1 and for which there exists m rm with l d such that rm bm d 1 b x y d x y b rm x y d x y 35 for every c 0 r m proof first we will show that for any y rm rm d s satisfies the given conditions since sf 0 if and only if f 0 and f 0 for f 0 we have that s m rm bm d to see that s satisfies 35 with note that for c 0 r m the function x y a x y is contained in e rm with 0 and that s x y b 1 b x y every x y satisfies x y r m d 1 and so it follows that rm bm d 1 b x y ds x y b rm x y q x y d x y x y d 36 since l d this condition is verified conditions 33 and 34 follow directly from the definition of the construction of s and the poincare inequality 28 now let m rm bm d satisfy conditions 33 34 and 35 it remains to show that s y rm rm d by the disintegration of measures theorem we can write where m rm is the pushforward of onto rm and rm m 1 bm d is weakly measurable let p s be the radon nikodym decomposition 32 filip rindler and giles shaw of with respect to since c 0 r m m rm and 36 is true for arbitrary c 0 r m this implies that 1 b x y s 1 p x y 1 b x y 37 in m rm by construction however s and charge disjoint sets this implies that both sides of 37 must be the zero measure it follows that 1 b x y 0 for s almost every x y rm and hence that for s almost every x y rm x y bm d x y b m d for f e rm we may therefore write sf x y q x y p x y sf x y q x y sf x y q x y s p x y bm d sf x y b d x y b bm d sf x y b d x y b x y b m d p x y bm d sf x y b d x y b s the above decomposition combined with the fact that x y b m d 1 s almost everywhere suggests that we construct the relevant young measure by defining as follows h x y p x y bm d sh x y b d x y b sh x y bm d h x y b d x y b x y b m d 38 it is clear that x y x y and inherit positivity from x y and from 37 we see that p x y 1 b x y 1 for a e x y r m and so since by definition 1 x y p x 1 b x y we have that x y m 1 rm d since it is defined as an average x y is also a probability measure for almost every x y r m that x y q x y l 1 rm follows from the definition of s applied to the integrand f x y a 1 a the desired weak measurability properties for and follow from the definition of p and the fact that is weakly measurable finally the poincare inequality 28 follows directly from condition 34 corollary 4 11 the set s y rm rm d is sequentially weakly closed in m rm bm d proof it suffices to show that conditions 33 and 34 and 35 from proposition 4 10 are se quentially weakly closed this is immediate for condition 35 since the functions x y a x y for c 0 r m are elements of the predual of m rm bm d now let j j y r m rm d and m rm bm d be such that s j in m rm bm d the condition bm bm d 0 is satisfied if and only if the sequence s j j is tight in m r m bm d rm bm d this fails to be the case only if there exists 0 0 1 and a sequence of radii rj such that lim sup j s j y rj b m d the poincare inequality 34 for j implies md s j r m bm d liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 33 y rj bm d 1 b y d d 1 ds j x y b d 1 d we would therefore obtain md lim sup j s j r m bm d md lim sup j 1 r d d 1 j d 1 d contradicting the fact that s j j must be a norm bounded sequence in m r m bm d by the uniform boundedness theorem finally since the function rm bm d 0 given by x y b 1 b y d d 1 if y b rm bm d 0 otherwise is lower semicontinuous it follows see for instance proposition 1 62 in 7 that lim inf j s j lim j md s j r m bm d d d 1 md rm bm d d d 1 and that condition 34 is therefore satisfied as a consequence of proposition 4 10 combined with the usual density results for tensor products of continuous functions over a product domain the following lemma is now immediate lemma 4 12 there exists a countable family of products k hk k n e r m where k c r m and hk c r m d such that if for a mass bounded sequence j j y rm rm d it holds that lim j k hk j k hk for each k n then j theorem 4 13 sequential compactness iny if a sequence j j y r m rm d satisfies sup j j y then there exists a young measure y rm rm d and a subsequence jk k j j such that jk as k proof note that by 31 for y rm rm d it holds that y s rm bm d which implies that j j y r m rm d is uniformly q y bounded if and only if s j j is uniformly norm bounded in m rm bm d the result now follows from the sequential weak closure of s y rm rm d in m rm bm d combined with the banach alaoglu theorem corollary 4 14 let j j l r m satisfy supj j r m then upon passing to a non relabelled subsequence there exists a young measure ly rm such that j y and j 34 filip rindler and giles shaw proof observe that if is the elementary young measure associated to a lifting l rm y rm q x y d x y rm q x y d x y x dx s rm rm where s is the lebesgue singular part of introduced in definition 4 2 it follows that the sequence of elementary young measures j j is bounded in y r m rm d and so we can combine theorem 4 13 with lemma 4 7 to achieve the desired result 4 3 manipulating young measures the following theorem will be of great importance in the computation of tangent young measures in section 5 theorem 4 15 restriction theorem for ly let ly rm or aly rm then the restricted young measure rm defined by rm r m is also a member of ly rm or rm aly rm note that the definition of rm is equivalent to the statement that for all f e rm f rm rm f x y q x y d x y rm f x y q x y d x y proof let j j l r m be such that j y for each r n let r c 1 rm rm be an injective function such that r 2 r r y y for y b 0 r r is bounded independently of r and r y 0 as y it suffices for example to take r y fr y y y where fr t t if 0 t r r 2 exp r t r if t r for each j r n define crj r j x dx c r 0 r j k x dx and denote by trj r m rm the map given by trj x y x r y c r j now define rj m r m rm d by rj t r j r j so that rm x y d rj x y rm trj x y r y d j x y c 0 r m in particular for every c 0 b 0 r rm x y d rj x y rm x y crj d j x y by the chain rule combined with the fact that yt r j r we have y t r j x y y t r j x y r y which implies rm y x y d r j x y rm y t r j x y d j x y liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 35 x t r j x j x dx x x r j x c r j dx we therefore see that rj l r m with rj r j c r j and x r j t r j x j from which we get gr rj ld trj gr j ld and hence that p rj t r j arp j where ar y r y 0 0 1 since each trj r m rm is injective because each r is injective lemma 2 1 implies that darp j d arp j dp rj d p rj trj and p r j t r j arp j for f e rm we can therefore compute pf x y p rj pf x y dp rj d p rj x y d p rj x y pf trj x y dp rj d p rj trj x y d arp j x y pf trj x y darp j d arp j x y d

tr 0 x y r y a since tr 0 can be extended continuously to r m by setting tr 0 x e x 2 re for x e bm and r can be continuously extended to r m by setting r e 0 for all e bm the fact that f e rm implies that f r e r m for each r 0 with f r x y a f tr 0 x y r y a if x y a r m rm d 0 if x y a bm rm d since trj x y t r 0 x y 0 c r j c r 0 and c r j c r 0 for each r 0 as j we can use the fact that j y in combination with lemma 3 18 and our previous calculation to deduce that lim j pf x y p rj lim j pf r x y c r j c r 0 p j lim j pf r x y p j f r 36 filip rindler and giles shaw since this limit holds for all f e rm it follows from definition 4 3 and theorem 4 13 that each sequence rj j l r m generates a young measure r ly rm defined via f r f r for all f e rm since f r b m bm d 0 for every r 0 and f r f f r f pointwise in rm rm d as r the dominated convergence theorem note that each f r is dominated by the integrable function sf 1 a lets us deduce lim r f r lim r f r lim r rm f r x y d x y rm f r x y d x y rm f x y d x y rm f x y d x y it follows then that the family r r 0 ly r m converges as r to a young measure 0 ly r m satisfying f 0 rm f x y d x y rm f x y d x y for all f e r m from which it is apparent that 0 r m as required that membership ofaly rm is preserved follows from the fact that u rj r u x c r j lemma 4 16 if aly rm then admits a generating sequence uj j with uj j c r m proof let vj j bv r m be such that vj y and let h fk k e r m be a countable collection of functions which determines young measure convergence as given in lemma 4 12 by the area strict density of c bd rm in bv rm ensured by proposition 2 3 combined with theorem 2 15 we can find a bv bounded sequence uj j c r m which satisfies pfk x y p vj pfk x y p uj 1 j for all k j it follows that fk lim j pfk x y p uj 0 for each k n which upon making use of the density property of h implies that uj generates as required lemma 4 17 let aly rm satisfy r m 0 then there exist sequences uj j c r m cj j r m with uj y and limj cj 0 satisfying uj j k cj proof invoking lemma 4 16 let vj j c r m be such that vj y from proposi tion 2 3 we know that there exists a sequence wj j c r m such that wj j k for each j n and wj j k area strictly in bv r m for 0 let k c c 0 1 be such that k x 1 if dist x 2 k 0 if dist x 1 k and define ukj j k c r m by ukj 1 k wj kvj c k j liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 37 where ckj is the constant which ensures that ukj x dx 0 for sufficiently large j we have that dukj dwj dvj k wj vj l 1 2 dj k dvj k wj vj l 1 and wj vj l 1 wj j k l 1 vj j k l 1 0 as j it follows that du k j j k is uniformly bounded in m rm rm d in k and j subject to the constraint j jk for some increasing sequence jk k n note that u k j satisfies u k j j k c k j and ckj k x wj x vj x wj x dx k x wj x vj x dx which implies ckj l d 1 wj vj l 1 hence c k j 0 as j uniformly in k for f e rm with sf 1 we can then compute pf x y p ukj pf x y p vj 2 ld dwj dvj x dist x 2 k for every j k n taking the limit as j we obtain lim j pf x y p ukj pf x y p vj 2 ld dj k x dist x 2 k since 0 the right hand side of this expression must converge to 0 as k and we can therefore use a diagonal argument to find a sequence jk k such that u k jk k generates and ckjk 0 since u k jk j k c k jk this suffices to prove the lemma 4 4 extended representation all of the results obtained so far in this section have helped us to understand limj pf x y p j when f e r m however the integrands f which are of interest for the applications that we have in mind are not members of e rm only of r rm in particular the requirement that both f and f extend continuously to rm rm d is too strong to be satisfied by any integrand which is unbounded in the middle variable if ly rm satisfies b m 0 and we assume just that f rw rm then the duality product f rm f x y q x y d x y rm f x y q x y d x y is still well defined in r for the singular part this follows from the fact that is a positive measure and that f is positive and continuous for the regular part this follows from gr j k l d and j k bv rm indeed the fact that f is carathe odory and satisfies f x y a c 1 y d d 1 a the weak measurability of the parametrised measure and the poincare condition 28 together imply that the map x y 7 f x y q x y is measurable and integrable similarly if f rw rm is such that f exists then f rm f x y q x y d x y rm f x y q x y d x y is also well defined even if b m 0 38 filip rindler and giles shaw proposition 4 18 and corollary 4 19 below show that knowledge of allows us to say something meaningful about limj pf x y p j for a very large class of integrands f and at the same time that this limiting behaviour does not change if f is replaced by a perturbation f q q cj q where cj j r m is a convergent sequence as a consequence the limiting behaviour of f uj j for any f and any weakly convergent sequence in bv rm can be understood in terms of the young measures generated by sequences uj uj j al r m proposition 4 18 extended representation let ly rm j j l r m be such that j y and let cj j r m be such that cj 0 r m let f rl rm i if b m 0 so that rm where rm is as described in theorem 4 15 we have that lim j pf x y cj p j f rm f d x y rm f d x y 39 ii if instead b m 0 and we assume in addition that f exists according to definition 2 11 we also have that lim j pf x y cj p j f rm f d x y rm f d x y 40 proof we shall prove 39 and 40 simultaneously step 1 assume first that f rm rm d r is carathe odory and satisfies f x y a c for all x y a rm rm d and some fixed c 0 by the scorza dragoni theorem there exists a compact set k such that l d k and f k r m rm d is continuous by the tietze extension theorem we can find a continuous function g c rm rm d which restricts to f on k r m rm d and such that g is bounded and that g f since g e rm with g f 0 lemma 3 18 together with corollary 4 9 lets us deduce lim j rm pg x y cj p j g g x j k x q x j k x dx by the construction of g however we see that rm p g f x y cj p j 2 k f dx for all j n and that the same estimate holds for rm p g f x y p letting 0 we obtain lim j rm pf x y cj p j f and so both 39 and 40 hold step 2 now assume that f rm rm d r is carathe odory and satisfies f x y a c for all x y a rm rm d and some fixed c 0 for k 0 let k cc r m 0 1 be such that k y 1 for y k define fk r m rm d r by fk x y a k y f x y a if x y a r m rm d 0 if x y a bm rm d liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 39 and note that each fk satisfies the hypotheses of step 1 since fk f pointwise in r m r m d as k and f 0 the dominated convergence theorem lets us deduce lim k fk lim k fk x j k x q x j k x dx f x j k x q x j k x dx f and since step 1 implies lim j pfk x y cj p j fk we therefore deduce limj pf x y cj p j f limk limj pf x y cj p j fk lim k limj p f fk x y cj p j now fix 0 and let r 0 be large enough that c 1 r recalling the map s e rm c rm bm d introduced in section 4 2 together with s s 1 the inverse of its adjoint we see that proposition 4 10 implies s bm bm d 0 and so by the outer regularity of radon measures there exists k 0 such that s rm b 0 k 1 b 0 r 1 r 2 since s j s in m rm bm d we must therefore have that s j ak r

ii combined with the fact that f r b m rm d 0 implies fr fr r m we have that lim j pfr x y cj p j fr fr r m the positivity of f and the monotone convergence theorem then imply that lim inf j pf x y cj

converges weakly to a limit as r 0 the primary tools in identifying this limit for x 0 du cu are theorem 3 17 which guarantees the strict convergence of the rescaled liftings ur r 0 and the graphical besicovitch derivation theorem theorem 5 1 introduced below we note that the usual version of the besicovitch derivation theorem and its generalisation the morse derivation theorem see 36 and also theorems 2 22 and 5 52 in 7 cannot be used in this situation since the aspect ratio crr 1 r 1 cr corresponding to the scaling present in 50 which due to the need to apply theorem 3 17 cannot be modified will converge to 0 for x cu the following theorem demonstrates that provided the denominator is a graphical measure derivatives of measures can be computed using families of sets which are very different to the usual decreasing cylinders b x r b y r so long as the family is sufficiently well behaved according to the differentiating measure liftings young measures and lower

and y x r u x as r 0 it follows that f is a fine cover for e and so by the vitali besicovitch covering theorem there exists a countable disjoint subfamily of f which we write as f for some disjoint subcollection f f that covers almost all of e we therefore have that t e t b f b b f b a first letting 0 and then using the outer regularity of to approximate gru e with a sequence of open sets we obtain t e gru e 48 filip rindler and giles shaw since gru z 0 also gru e 0 and if e was such that gru e e 0 then t 0 a contradiction it follows that f x 0 for almost every x and hence that lim r 0 b

using theorem 5 1 we can prove that the behaviour of graphical measures under general homotheties is stable under multiplication by integrable functions lemma 5 2 let m rm be a u graphical measure on

combined with 62 let us deduce that that f f z w u q x 0 w d x 0 z w for every f e bd rm which is positively one homogeneous in the final variable since we have already noted that we must have z w 0 an application of theorem 4 15 to ensure that bd b m 0 leaves us with the desired conclusion that aly bd rm if aly bd rm follows again from the closedness of aly bd rm recall lemma 4 7 in ly bd rm under weak young measure convergence 58 filip rindler and giles shaw remark 5 6 note that the proofs of theorems 5 3 and 5 4 imply the following result let ly rm with j k u then for ld dcu almost every x du cu whenever rn 0 is a sequence such that urn n converges strictly to u 0 in bv bd rm and rncrn 0 as n note that these conditions hold for every sequence rn 0 if x du the rescaled sequence

rank one theorem 2 ddu d du x is a rank one matrix so we have obtained that the barycentre id x u x of the probability measure x u x is a rank one matrix as the recession function of a quasiconvex

sequences to show that the lower bound obtained in theorem 5 10 for f is attained the recovery sequences in this section are constructed globally without making use of the de giorgi letta theorem to localise around points x du cu ju we therefore do not require the existence of a finite du ld absolutely continuous measure which dominates f example 6 1 below demonstrates the existence of a continuous integrand f rw rm which is convex in the final variable and whose associated weak relaxation f attains a global minimum at 0 yet which does not possess any weakly convergent minimising sequences in the full vector valued u dependent case we can thus only expect to find recovery sequences which converge in the strong l 1 rm topology we must therefore find a way of construct ing approximate recovery sequences uj j c rm such that uj u in bv rm and limj f uj f u for each 0 example 6 1 recovery sequences can be badly behaved let u bv 1 1 r 2 be given by u x 0 0 if x 0 0 1 if x 0 and for j 4 define the sequence uj w 1 1 r r 2 by uj x j 2 x 0 1 0 1 j x j j x 1 j 1 1 j 2 j x j j 2 x 2 j 1 1 2 j 3 j x 62 filip rindler and giles shaw 0 1 1 3 j x so that duj 1 1 2 j 1 and uj u pointwise almost everywhere as j let f rw 1 1 r 2 be given by f x y a y a y 1 y 2 y 2 1 y 2 1 y 2 2 e y 1 and also define ukj k w 1 1 1 1 r 2 by ukj x uj kx we can see that dukj 1 1 duj 1 1 and w lim k ukj u for each fixed j by a change of coordinates it is also clear that lim j lim k 1 1 f x ukj x u k j x dx lim j 1 1 uj x uj x dx 0 which demonstrates that f u 0 and that kf u 0 now assume that vj j w 1 1 1 1 r 2 is such that vj u we will show that lim inf j 1 1 f x vj x vj x dx 0 by the sobolev embedding theorem in one dimension it holds that supj vj which implies that for some 0 lim j 1 1 vj

combined with corollary 3 12 lets us deduce that wj wj w w by reshetnyak s lower semicontinuity theorem then it holds that lim j 1 1 wj x 1 wj x 1 wj x 2 wj x dx y w 1 y w 1 y w 2 d w w x y 1 0 w 0 1

x vj x dx 0 for any sequence vj j w 1 1 1 1 r 2 such that vj u it follows that u is a global minimiser for f possessing no weakly convergent recovery sequences this is in stark contrast to the situations where either f is u independent see 31 where recovery sequences can always be found which converge area strictly in bv rm or vj j converges weakly in w 1 p rm for some p 1 where recovery sequences can be found which converge strongly in w 1 p 6 1 surface energies in order to construct approximate recovery sequences we first consider the crucial surface part lemma 6 2 let f rw rm and u

se quences for f finally allowing us to complete the proof of theorem a theorem 6 4 approximate recovery sequences let u bv rm and f rw rm be such that f x y q is quasiconvex for every x y rm for any 0 there exists a sequence uj j c rm such that uj u in bv rm and limj f uj f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x proof step 1 assume first that f rw rm and that f satisfies c a f x y a c a for some choice of constants c c 0 let uj j bv r m be the sequence provided 70 filip rindler and giles shaw by proposition 6 3 such that lim j f x uj x uj x dx 1 0 f x u x ddsuj d dsuj x d d dsuj x f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x 69 since f is assumed to be coercive uj j is a bounded sequence in bv r m and so upon passing to a nonrelabelled subsequence we can assume that uj uj y for some aly rm with j k u u which by virtue of corollary 4 19 satisfies f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x lim j f x uj x uj x dx 1 0 f x u j x ddsuj d dsuj x d d dsuj x f q q u q r m theorem 4 15 implies that rm aly rm and so since j rm k u u from lemma 4 16 we get that there exists a sequence vj j bv c rm converging weakly to u u and which is such that vj y rm proposition 4 18 i applied to f rm and vj j together with theorem 5 10 applied to vj u j therefore yield f q q u q r m lim j f x vj x u vj x dx f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x it follows that f q q u q r m f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x and so we can assume b m 0 by testing with integrands h for cc r m and h cc r m d we see that the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of uj to u implies that x u x u x for almost every x define h f f and repeating the construction used in step 4 of the proof of proposi tion 4 18 define hk r l rm by hk x y a 1 1 y k y kd d 1 y d d 1 1 y d d 1 a h x y a liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 71 proposition 4 18 i combined with the fact that we can assume b m 0 implies that lim j hk x uj x uj x dx rm hk x y u q x y d x y hk x u x u x dx for every k n since h x y a hk x y a c 1 y k y y d d 1 kd d 1 and the sequence uj j is d d 1 uniformly integrable for any 0 there exists k n such that k k implies limj h x uj x uj x dx lim j hk x uj x uj x dx lim j c uj x k y d d 1 kd d 1 dx thus lim j h x uj x uj x dx lim k hk x u x u x dx h x u x u x dx 70 adding equations 69 and 70 we obtain lim j f uj f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x an application of theorem 2 15 together with the area strict density of c rm in bv rm to each f uj combined with a diagonal argument now leaves us with the desired result in the case where f is coercive step 2 now assume just that f rw rm and define f r w rm by f x y a f x y a a clearly f f pointwise as 0 and so by the monotone convergence theorem we have that f x u x u x dx f x u x u x dx and f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x as 0 since f f we have that kf u kf u and in fact it holds that kf u kf u pointwise as 0 this follows from the estimate lim 0 kf u x 0 lim 0 f x 0 y y dy f x 0 y y dy kf u x 0 for any au x 0 such that f x 0 y y dy kf u x 0 thus ju kf u x dh d 1 x ju kf u x dh d 1 x as 0 72 filip rindler and giles shaw defining f bv r m 0 by f u f x u x u x dx 1 0 f x u x ddsu d dsu x d d dsu x we therefore have that f u f u as 0 for every u bv r m for each fixed 0 step 1 implies that there exists a sequence u j j c rm with u j u in bv rm and lim j f u j f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x since f is quasiconvex in the final variable theorem 5 10 implies that f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x lim inf j f u j for every 0 thus f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x lim 0 lim inf j f u j lim 0 lim j f u j lim 0 f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x which leads us to conclude lim 0 lim inf j f u j f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x for any 0 we can therefore find a fixed 0 such that u j u in bv rm and lim j f u j f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x which suffices to prove the claim liftings young measures and lower semicontinuity 73 remark 6 5 interestingly theorem 5 10 is used in the proof of theorem 6 4 which implies that we are only able to construct approximate recovery sequences for f when f is quasiconvex in the final variable as a side remark the existence of l 1 convergent recovery sequences now follows directly from theorem 6 4 combined with a diagonal argument corollary 6 6 l 1 recovery sequences let u bv rm and let f rw rm be such that f x y q is quasiconvex for every x y rm then there exists a sequence uj j c rm such that uj u in l 1 rm and lim j f uj f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x 6 4 relaxation combining the results of sections 5 and 6 we can finally complete the proof of theorem a stated in section 1 theorem 6 7 theorem a let f rw rm be such that f x y q is quasiconvex for every x y rm the bv weak relaxation of the functional f bv rm r f u f x u x u x dx f x u x ddsu d dsu x d d dsu x is given by f u f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x proof recalling the definition of f we see that theorem 5 10 implies f u f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x on the other hand for 0 arbitrary theorem 6 4 guarantees the existence of a sequence uj j bv r m such that uj u and f u lim sup j f uj f x u x u x dx f x u x ddcu d dcu x d dcu x ju kf u x dh d 1 x f u and so the desired conclusion follows 7 compliance with ethical standards funding g s s contribution to this work forms part of their
