wxs 27 psu edu march 29 2022 abstract the paper introduces a pde model for the growth of a tree stem or a vine the equations describe the elongation due to cell growth and the response to gravity and to external obstacles an additional term accounts for the tendency of a vine to curl around branches of other plants when obstacles are present the model takes the form of a differential inclusion with unilateral constraints at each time t a cone of admissible reactions is determined by the minimization of an elastic deformation energy the main theorem shows that local solutions exist and can be prolonged globally in time except when a specific breakdown configuration is reached approximate solutions are constructed by an operator splitting technique some numerical simulations are provided at the end of the paper 1 introduction we consider a simple mathematical model describing how the stem of a plant grows and how it reacts to external constraints such as branches of other plants at each time t the stem is described by a curve t in 3 dimensional space the model takes into account the linear elongation due to cell growth and the upward bending as a response to gravity in the case of vines an additional term accounts for the tendency to curl around branches of other plants from a theoretical perspective the main challenge comes from the presence of external ob stacles resulting in a number of unilateral constraints ultimately this yields a differential inclusion on a closed subset of h 2 0 t r 3 we remark that most of the literature on differential inclusions with constraints is concerned with the case where the cone of admis sible reactions produced by the possibly moving obstacle is perpendicular to its boundary 4 5 6 7 in moreau s sweeping process this assumption plays an essential role in the proof of existence and continuous dependence of solutions in our model at a time when part of the stem touches the obstacle the evolution is governed by the minimization of an instan taneous elastic deformation energy subject to the external constraints as a consequence the cone of admissible velocities determined by the obstacle s reaction can be very different 1 ar x iv 1 70 1 06 68 0 v 1 m at h o c 2 3 ja n 20 17 from the normal cone in certain breakdown configurations as shown in fig 4 this cone of admissible reactions actually happens to be tangent our main result theorem 1 in section 3 establishes the local existence of solutions to the growth model with obstacles these solutions can be extended globally in time provided that a specific breakdown configuration is never reached as already mentioned since the cone of admissible reactions is not a normal cone the uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions is a difficult problem that requires a substantially different approach from 4 5 6 7 a detailed analysis of this issue will appear in the forthcoming paper 3 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the basic model and derives an evolution equation satisfied by the growing curve if obstacles are present this takes the form of a differential inclusion in the space h 2 0 t r 3 this is supplemented by unilateral constraints requiring that at all times the curve t remains outside a given set in section 3 we give a definition of solution and state the main existence theorem namely solutions exist locally in time and can be prolonged up to the first time when a breakdown configuration is reached a precise definition of these bad configurations is given at 3 9 3 10 and illustrated in fig 3 in essence this happens when the tip of the stem touches the obstacle perpendicularly and all the portions of the stem that do not touch the obstacle are straight segments the existence of solutions is proved in sections 4 and 5 constructing a sequence of approxi mations by an operator splitting technique each time step involves a regular evolution operator modeling the linear growth and the bending in response to gravity possibly including also the curling of vines around branches of other plants a singular operator accounting for the obstacle reaction much of the analytical work is carried out in section 4 where we introduce a push out operator and derive some key a priori estimates section 5 completes the proof of the main theorem this is based on a compactness argument which yields a convergent subsequence of approximate solutions in section 6 we briefly describe how our results can be extended to more general models including the case where the elastic energies associated with twisting and bending of the stem come with different coefficients finally section 7 presents some numerical simulations in the case of one or two obstacles in two space dimensions the code used for these simulations can be downloaded at 9 2 the basic model we assume that new cells are generated at the tip of the stem then they grow in size at time t 0 the length of the cells born during the time interval s s ds is measured by d 1 e t s ds 2 1 for some constant 0 the total length of the stem is thus l t t 0 1 e t s ds t 1 e t 2 2 2 at any given time t the stem will be described by a curve s 7 p t s in 3 dimensional space for s 0 t the point p t s describes the position at time t of the cell born at time s in addition we denote by k t s the unit tangent vector to the stem at the point p t s so that k t s ps t s ps t s ps t s s p t s 2 3 the above implies p t s s 0 1 e t k t d 2 4 we shall always assume that the curvature vanishes at the tip of the stem so that s k t s s t 0 2 5 our description of the growing stem takes into account i the upward bending as a response to gravity ii an additional bending in case of a vine clinging to branches of other plants iii the reaction produced by obstacles iv the linear elongation without loss of generality one can assume that p t 0 0 r 3 most of our analysis will be concerned with the limit case where so that d d and 2 4 simplifies to p t s s 0 k t d 2 6 as shown in section 6 all results can be extended to the case 0 with only minor changes in the proofs 2 1 response to gravity to model the response to gravity we assume that if a portion of the stem is not vertical a local change in the curvature will be produced affecting the position of the upper section of the stem more precisely let e 1 e 2 e 3 be the standard orthonormal basis in r 3 with e 3 oriented in the upward direction at every point p t 0 t consider the cross product t k t e 3 the change in the position of points on the stem in response to gravity is described by see fig 1 t p t s s 0 e t k t e 3 p t s p t d f 1 t s 2 7 3 e 3 e 1 e 2 k 0 e 3 p 0 p t s p t t p t t figure 1 left at any point p p t along the stem if the tangent vector k is not vertical consider the plane spanned by k and e 3 then the change in curvature of the stem at p produces a slight rotation of all points p t s with s t the angular velocity is given by the vector right at a given time t the curve p t is parameterized by s 0 t it is convenient to prolong this curve by adding a segment of length t t at its tip dotted line possibly entering inside the obstacle this yields an evolution equation on a fixed functional space h 2 0 t r 3 differentiating w r t s one obtains t k t s s 0 e t k t e 3 d k t s g 1 t s 2 8 notice that in the above integrands 0 is a constant measuring the strength of the response while e t s is a stiffness factor it accounts for the fact that older parts of the stem are more rigid and hence they bend more slowly t k t e 3 is an angular velocity determined by the response to gravity at the point p t this affects the upper portion of the stem i e all points p t s with s t 2 2 clinging to obstacles some plants rather than growing in the vertical direction prefer to curl around branches of other plants to model this behavior we assume that the stem can feel the presence of an obstacle within a distance 0 this triggers a local change of the curvature in the appropriate direction more precisely let r 3 be a bounded open set whose closure does not contain the origin and whose boundary is a surface with c 3 regularity let r 7 0 1 be a smooth function such that 0 0 s 0 for x 0 0 0 2 9 4 t s 0 s s 0 p t s k t s k figure 2 left the function in 2 9 center points on the stem at a distance 0 from feel the presence of the obstacle and produce an increase of curvature in the appropriate direction for some constants 0 0 0 for x r 3 we then set x d x the bending of the stem around the obstacle can now be described by t p t s s 0 e t p t k t p t s p t d f 2 t s 2 10 as before a differentiation w r t s yields t k t s s 0 e t p t k t d k t s g 2 t s 2 11 2 3 unilateral constraints finally we seek to model a family of admissible reactions produced by an obstacle which guarantee that the stem will never penetrate inside as a preliminary consider a stem which partly lies inside the open region call x d x if x d x if x 2 12 the signed distance of a point x r 3 to the boundary let s 0 t be fixed if p t s 0 consider the problem of bending the stem so that the point p t s is pushed out of the obstacle calling r 3 a rotation vector at the point p t in first approxi mation the displacement of the point p t s on the stem is computed by p t s p t s s 0 p t s p t d 2 13 we seek a function which minimizes the elastic deformation energy e 1 2 s 0 e t 2 d 2 14 5 subject to p t s p t s p t s p t s 0 2 15 here the factor e t accounts for the fact that older sections of the stem are stiffer and offer more resistance to bending inserting 2 13 in 2 15 we obtain p t s s 0 p t s p t d p t s 0 2 16 to derive necessary conditions for optimality consider a family of perturbations differentiating w r t at 0 we obtain s 0 e t d p t s s 0 p t s p t d 0 2 17 where the constant is a suitable lagrange multiplier using the property of the mixed product a b c b c a one obtains s 0 e t d s 0 p t s p t s p t d 0 2 18 since 2 18 must hold for all perturbations this implies e t p t s p t s p t 2 19 for some constant r and all 0 s imposing the boundary condition 2 15 we conclude e t p t s p t s p t 2 20 where the constant is determined by the identity 2 15 namely p t s s 0 e t p t s p t s p t p t s p t d p t s 0 2 21 using the vector identities a b c c a b c b a 2 22 b b c c b c 2 b 2 c 2 2 23 and recalling that p t s 0 from 2 21 we obtain s 0 e t p t s 2 p t s p t 2 p t s p t s p t 2 d 1 p t s 0 2 24 6 notice that the integral in 2 24 vanishes only if the vector p t s is parallel to all vectors p t s p t examples of these bad configurations are shown in figure 3 right next assume that at a given time t the stem lies entirely outside the obstacle but part of it touches the boundary call t s 0 t p t s 2 25 the set where the stem touches the obstacle for s t let n t s be the unit outer normal to the boundary at the point p t s motivated by the previous analysis we define the cone of admissible velocities produced by the obstacle reaction to be the set of velocity fields t v 0 t 7 r 3 there exists a positive measure supported on t such that v s s 0 e t t n t s p t s p t d s p t s p t d 2 26 note that for every s t the reaction produced by the obstacle can yield a deformation of the stem given by pt t s s 0 p t s p t d where by 2 20 s e t n t s p t s p t for some s 0 integrating over all points s t with arbitrary choices of the factor s 0 we obtain 2 26 remark 1 one may adopt a more accurate model where the bending and twisting of the stem are penalized in different ways more precisely at each point p t one may split the rotation vector into a component parallel to k t twisting and a component perpendicular to k t bending twist bend where twist k t k t bend twist the energy functional e in 2 14 can then be replaced by e 1 2 s 0 e t c 1 twist 2 c 2 bend 2 d 2 27 for suitable constants c 1 c 2 when c 1 c 2 this is equivalent to 2 14 7 2 4 summary of the equations taking into account all terms i iii the evolution of the stem in the presence of obstacles can be described by pt t s f 1 t s f 2 t s v t s 2 28 here f 1 f 2 are the integral terms defined at 2 7 2 10 while v t t is an admissible reaction in the cone defined at 2 26 the equation 2 28 needs to be solved on a domain of the form d t s t t 0 s 0 t 2 29 with initial and boundary conditions p t 0 s p s s 0 t 0 2 30 pss t s s t 0 t t 0 2 31 and the constraint p t s for all t s d 2 32 recalling 2 6 one obtains an equivalent evolution equation for the unit tangent vector k namely kt t s g 1 t s g 2 t s h t s 2 33 here g 1 g 2 are the integral terms defined at 2 8 2 11 respectively moreover h t is any element of the admissible cone t h 0 t 7 r 3 there exists a positive measure supported on t such that h s s 0 t e t n t s p t s p t d s d k t s 2 34 the equation 2 33 should be solved on the domain d in 2 29 with initial and boundary conditions k t 0 s k s s 0 t 0 2 35 ks t s s t 0 t t 0 2 36 2 5 the two dimensional case in the planar case n 2 the evolution equation for the growing stem takes a simpler form for any vector v v 1 v 2 let v v 2 v 1 be the perpendicular vector obtained by a 8 counterclockwise rotation of 2 setting k k 1 k 2 the equations 2 33 can be written as kt t s s 0 e t k 1 t d k t s s 0 e t p t k t d k t s s 0 t e t n t s p t s p t d s d k t s 2 37 here is any positive measure supported on the contact set t in 2 25 as before for s t we denote by n t s the unit outer normal to at the boundary point p t s 3 statement of the main results at each time t the position of the stem is described by a map p t from 0 t into r 3 of course the domain of this map grows with time it is convenient to reformulate our model as an evolution problem on a functional space independent of t for this purpose we fix t t 0 and consider the hilbert sobolev space h 2 0 t r 3 any function p t h 2 0 t r 3 will be canonically extended to h 2 0 t r 3 by setting see fig 1 right p t s p t t s t ps t t for s t t 3 1 notice that the above extension is well defined because p t and ps t are continuous functions in all of the following analysis we shall study functions defined on a domain of the form dt t s 0 s t t t 0 t 3 2 and extended to the rectangle t 0 t 0 t as in 3 1 in particular the partial derivative ps t s will be constant for s t t this will already account for the boundary condition 2 31 adopting the notation a b min a b we thus consider an evolution problem on the space h 2 0 t r 3 having the more general form pt t s s t 0 t p t ps t p t s p t d v t s 3 3 here s 0 t r r r 3 r 3 7 r 3 is a smooth function and v t is an admissible velocity field produced by the constraint reaction more precisely given the configuration p t of the stem at time t the cone of admissible velocities is defined as t w 0 t 7 r 3 there exists a positive measure supported on the coincidence set t in 2 25 such that for every s 0 t one has w s s 0 e t t n t s p t s p t d s p t s p t d 3 4 9 remark 2 in view of 2 7 and 2 10 we can write the evolution equation 2 28 in the form 3 3 by taking t p k e t k e 3 p k 3 5 before stating our main existence theorem we introduce a precise definition of solution definition 1 we say that a function p p t s defined for t s t 0 t 0 t is a solution to the equation 3 3 3 4 with initial and boundary conditions 2 30 2 32 if the following holds i the map t 7 p t is lipschitz continuous from t 0 t into h 2 0 t r 3 ii for every t s one has p t s p t 0 s t t 0 s t 0 p ps p s p d d t 0 v s d 3 6 where each v is an element of the cone defined as in 3 4 iii the initial conditions hold p t 0 s p s if s 0 t 0 p t 0 s t 0 p t 0 if s t 0 t 3 7 iv the pointwise constraints hold p t s for all t t 0 t s 0 t 3 8 bad badgood good figure 3 for the two initial configurations on the left the constrained growth equation 2 28 admits a unique solution the two configurations on the right satisfy the condition b in such cases the cauchy problem is ill posed given an initial data p t 0 s p s our main result states local existence of solutions locally in time as long as the following breakdown configuration is not attained see fig 3 10 b the tip of the stem touches the obstacle perpendicularly namely p t 0 p s t 0 n p t 0 3 9 moreover p ss s 0 for all s 0 t such that p s 3 10 here n p denotes the unit outer normal to at a boundary point p our main result shows that the equations of growth with obstacle admit a solution in the sense of definition 1 moreover this solution can be prolonged in time until a breakdown configuration is reached as described in b theorem 1 existence of solutions let in 3 3 be a c 2 function and let r 3 be a bounded open set with c 2 boundary at time t 0 consider the initial data 2 30 where the curve s 7 p s is in h 2 0 t 0 r 3 and satisfies p 0 0 p s 1 p s for all s 0 t 0 3 11 moreover assume that the condition b does not hold then there exists t t 0 such that the equations 3 3 3 4 with initial and boundary condi tions 2 30 2 32 admit at least one solution for t t 0 t either i the solution is globally defined for all times t t 0 or ii the solution can be extended a maximal time interval 0 t where p t satisfies all conditions in b remark 3 from an abstract point of view our evolution problem has the form d dt u t u t u t 3 12 where u t p t a h 2 0 t r 3 here a is the set of admissible configurations satisfying the constraint 3 8 while u is the cone of admissible velocities defined as in 3 4 if u were the inward pointing normal cone to a at u then for any two solutions u 1 u 2 one could expect an estimate of the type d dt u 1 t u 2 t h 2 c u 1 t u 2 t h 2 3 13 by gronwall s lemma this would imply the uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions on the initial data 4 5 6 7 unfortunately in the present setting the cone u determined by the constraint reaction is not at all perpendicular to the boundary of the admissible set see fig 4 for this reason the well posedness of the cauchy problem for the growing stem with obstacles is a delicate issue which will be separately addressed in the forthcoming paper 3 11 a 1 3 2 1 2 3 figure 4 right the abstract evolution equation 3 12 in general the cone of constraint reactions is not perpendicular to the boundary of the set a of admissible configurations for a stem 3 which satisfies all conditions in b the corresponding cone 3 is tangent to a 4 a push out operator consider a curve 0 h 2 0 t 0 r 3 parameterized by arc length more precisely assume that 0 0 0 r 3 0 s 1 0 s for all s 0 t 0 4 1 moreover assume that not all of the following conditions hold 0 t 0 0 t 0 n 0 t 0 4 2 0 s 0 for all s 0 t 0 such that 0 s 4 3 given t t 0 we can extend 0 to a map 0 t 7 r 3 by setting 0 s 0 t 0 0 t 0 s t 0 for all s t 0 t 4 4 for a fixed radius 0 and t t 0 consider the tube v h 2 0 t r 3 around 0 defined by v h 2 0 t r 3 0 0 0 0 0 s 1 for all s 0 t t 0 s 0 s 2 ds 4 5 given a curve h 2 0 t r 3 and a function l 2 0 t r 3 we define the rotated curve as s s s 0 s d 4 6 notice that in general the map s 7 s is not an arc length parameterization of however for l 2 small we have s 2 s s 0 d s s s 0 d s 1 s 0 d s 2 1 o 1 2 l 2 4 7 12 next consider a curve v and a subinterval 0 t 0 t if s for some s 0 t we wish to push outside but bending the curve as little as possible this leads to the constrained optimization problem minimize j t 0 e t s s 2 ds 4 8 subject to s for all s 0 t 4 9 notice that here we allow s for t s t before proving the existence of a minimizer we prove that there exists at least one angular velocity that pushes every point of the curve away from the obstacle this will be achieved by the first two lemmas in the following is the euclidean inner product in r 3 while x denotes the signed distance of point x to as in 2 12 lemma 1 let 0 be as in 4 1 then there exist t t 0 0 and a constant c 0 such that the following holds extend 0 as in 4 4 and let v as in 4 5 assume v h 2 0 t r 3 with v 0 v 0 0 v s s 0 for all s 0 t 4 10 then there exist a unique angular velocity field l 2 0 t r 3 such that l 2 c 0 v h 2 4 11 s s 0 for all s 0 t 4 12 v s s 0 s d for all s 0 t 4 13 proof 1 by the initial conditions in 4 10 differentiating 4 13 we see that satisfies 4 13 if and only if v s s 0 d s for all s 0 t 4 14 2 next consider a family of orthonormal frames e 1 s e 2 s e 3 s with e 1 s s for all s 0 t we shall determine two scalar functions 2 3 0 t 7 r such that the vector function s 2 s e 2 s 3 s e 3 s satisfies 4 13 using the orthogonality assumption in 4 10 we obtain two scalar functions z 2 z 3 such that v s z 2 s e 2 s z 3 s e 3 s s 0 2 e 2 3 e 3 d e 1 s 4 15 projecting along e 2 s we obtain z 2 s s 0 e 2 e 1 s e 2 s 2 d s 0 e 3 e 1 s e 2 s 3 d 13 by a property of the triple product this is equivalent to z 2 s s 0 e 2 e 3 s 2 e 3 e 3 s 3 d 4 16 similarly projecting along e 3 s we obtain z 3 s s 0 e 2 e 2 s 2 e 3 e 2 s 3 d 4 17 observing that all quantities v zi i ei in 4 15 are functions in h 1 we can differentiate one more time and obtain the linear system of volterra integral equations 3 s z 2 s s 0 e 2 e 3 s 2 e 3 e 3 s 3 d 2 s z 3 s s 0 e 2 e 2 s 2 e 3 e 2 s 3 d 4 18 3 the unique solution to the system 4 18 can be obtained by a standard fixed point argument adopting vector notation set u 2 3 z z 2 z 3 then 4 18 can be written as u s z s s 0 b s u d p u s 4 19 where the matrix b s has norm b s 2 e 2 s 2 e 3 s b s we claim that the operator p defined at 4 19 is a strict contraction on the space l 1 0 t r 2 with equivalent norm u t 0 exp 4 s 0 b d u s ds indeed for any u 1 u 2 l 1 an integration by parts yields p u 1 p u 2 t 0 exp 4 s 0 b d b s s 0 u 1 u 2 d ds t 0 1 4 exp 4 s 0 b d u 1 u 2 ds 1 4 exp 4 t 0 b d t 0 u 1 u 2 d ds 1 2 t 0 exp 4 s 0 b d u 1 u 2 ds 1 2 u 1 u 2 ds by the contraction mapping principle the equation 4 19 has a unique solution in l 1 0 t r 2 in addition we have u l 1 c 1 z l 1 c 2 z l 2 4 20 14 for some constants c 1 c 2 depending on t and on the function b in turn this implies u 2 l 2 2 z 2 l 2 2 t 0 b 2 s s 0 u d 2 ds 2 z 2 l 2 2 b 2 l 2 u 2 l 1 2 2 b 2 l 2 c 22 z 2 l 2 4 21 4 returning to the original variables we see that z l 2 o 1 v h 2 on the other hand b l 2 o 1 h 2 is uniformly bounded as ranges in v this completes the proof of 4 11 remark 4 in the above proof the uniqueness of the function was achieved by imposing the orthogonality condition 4 12 without this restriction infinitely many solutions are possible for example if s e 0 for all s 0 t and is a solution then s s s e 0 is another solution for any scalar function the next lemma shows that if a stem is not close to a bad configuration described in b then it can be pushed away from the obstacle by a small rotation lemma 2 assume that the initial curve 0 0 t 0 7 r 3 satisfies 4 1 but it does not satisfy simultaneously all conditions in 4 2 4 3 then there exist t t 0 0 and a constant c 0 such that the following holds assume t t 0 t and consider any curve v as in 4 5 then there exists 0 t 7 r 3 with l 2 c 0 4 22 such that for every s 0 t such that s one has s 0 s d s 1 4 23 proof let w c 2 r 3 r 3 be a function which satisfies w x x if x 0 0 if x 2 0 4 24 since we are assuming that the boundary is c 3 such a function exists provided that 0 0 is chosen sufficiently small three cases will be considered case 1 either 0 t 0 or else t 0 and t 0 n t 0 0 see fig 5 left in this case we define v s 2 w s 4 25 15 n s t n s n figure 5 the three cases considered in the proof of lemma 2 v s v s s 0 v d s 4 26 observing that s v s 0 for all s 0 t 4 27 by lemma 1 we can find l 2 0 t such that 4 11 4 13 hold to prove 4 23 we first observe that s 0 v d s 0 v d t 0 dd 2 w d 2 t w c 2 4 28 we also recall that by assumption 0 s n 0 s 0 for all s 0 t 0 such that 0 s for any given 0 0 choosing 0 sufficiently small we achieve the implication s 2 s s 0 4 29 for all s 0 t choosing 0 4 t 0 w c 2 1 if s by 4 28 and 4 29 we now have s 0 s d s v s s 2 s s s 0 v d s s 2 2 t w c 2 0 1 4 30 case 2 0 t 0 and 1 0 t 0 n 0 t 0 0 in other words the tip of the stem touches the obstacle but is neither tangent nor perpendicular to the boundary see fig 5 center 16 by choosing 0 sufficiently small we can find 0 1 2 such that s 2 0 if s t 1 t 2 0 if s t 2 t 1 4 31 and moreover for some 1 0 1 2 1 s s 0 for s t 1 t consider the function v s 2 w s if s 0 t 1 c 2 w s if s t 1 t 4 32 where c 2 is a suitably large constant whose precise value will be determined later since w s 0 for s t 2 t 1 the function v has the same regularity as with this choice of v we then define v s as in 4 26 we claim that 4 23 holds indeed for s 0 t 1 the estimates 4 29 4 30 remain valid to handle the case s t 1 t we begin with the estimate s t 1 d d w d s t 1 w d s w s t t 1 d 1 2 1 1 1 4 33 we used here the fact that w t 1 0 and that 1 0 is a constant depending only on 0 while 1 can be rendered as arbitrarily small by choosing 0 small enough using the above estimate one obtains s 0 s d s v s s c 2 s s t 1 0 v d s s s t 1 v d s s c 2 2 t w c 2 0 c 2 1 1 1 4 34 provided that c 2 was chosen sufficiently large as before since 4 27 holds by lemma 1 we can find l 2 0 t such that 4 11 4 13 hold case 3 0 t 0 and t 0 n 0 t 0 hence the tip of the stem touches the obstacle perpendicularly fig 5 right define w as in 4 24 by assumption 4 2 fails by choosing 0 small enough we can thus find 0 a b t 0 such that a 6 b s 2 for all s a b 4 35 17 in turn we can find a smooth function z r 7 r 3 supported on a b such that b a s z s ds 1 4 36 then we set v s 2 w s c 3 z s 4 37 for some constant c 3 large enough finally we define v as in 4 26 as in the previous cases by the identity 4 27 we can use lemma 1 and obtain a function l 2 0 t such that 4 11 4 13 hold it remains to prove that 4 23 holds provided that 0 was chosen sufficiently small indeed if 0 is small enough we can find 0 1 2 such that 4 31 holds and moreover 1 s s 1 2 for s t 1 t for s 0 t 1 for 0 small we again have the bound in 4 29 hence s 0 s d s v s s 2 s s s 0 v d s s 2 c 0 1 4 38 notice that here c is a constant that depends only on 0 while 0 0 can be rendered arbitrarily small by choosing 0 small enough finally when s t 1 t we have s 0 s d s v s s 2 s s s 0 v d s s 2 a 0 s b v d s s b a v d s s 2 a 0 s b v d c 3 b a z d s s 2 c c 3 2 4 39 we observe that here the constant c depends only on 0 while c 3 can be chosen sufficiently large so that the right hand side of 4 39 is 1 this completes the proof remark 5 if all conditions 4 2 4 3 hold then the conclusion of lemma 2 can fail for example assume that 0 is a segment with 0 t 0 and 0 s e 0 n t 0 for all 18 s 0 t 0 then there is no field of angular velocities which satisfies 4 23 at s t 0 indeed in this case for every one has t 0 0 0 t 0 0 d t 0 t 0 0 t 0 e 0 d e 0 0 given a curve 0 t 7 r 3 and t 0 t we introduce the quantity e t sup d s s 0 t s 4 40 measuring the maximum depth at which the initial portion of i e for s 0 t penetrates inside the obstacle lemma 3 for a given path 0 0 t 0 7 r 3 assume that at least one of the conditions in 4 2 4 3 fails then there exist t t 0 and 0 such that the following holds for every v and t 0 t the problem 4 8 4 9 has a unique solution moreover for some constant c 0 one has the estimate l 2 2 c 0 e t 4 41 for some constant c 0 independent of v proof 1 by choosing t t 0 and 0 small enough for any v an application of lemma 2 yields the existence of some angular velocity such that 4 22 4 23 hold for some uniform constant c 0 set 2 e t then by choosing 0 small enough we obtain s for all s 0 t 2 now take a minimizing sequence n n 1 by the previous analysis we can assume that n 2 c 0 e t 4 42 for all n 1 moreover it is not restrictive to assume that n s 0 for t s t we then extract a subsequence that converges weakly in l 2 0 t say n clearly lim inf n n 2 c 0 e t hence achieves the minimum finally the condition s for all s 0 t follows by the uniform convergence of the sequence n on 0 t 19 3 to prove uniqueness consider two minimizers 1 6 2 and set 1 2 2 observe that 2 i 2 1 4 1 2 2 i 1 2 4 43 if lies entirely outside the obstacle we already reach a contradiction in general the definition 4 6 implies that s 1 s 2 s 2 is the midpoint of a segment with vertices outside observe that for every s 0 t one has 1 s 2 s o 1 1 2 o 1 e t since the boundary is smooth we conclude e t o 1 e 2 by the argument used in lemma 3 we can construct a perturbation with o 1 1 2 2 l o 1 e 2 t such that s for all s 0 t we now reach a contradiction by observing that 2 2 o 1 1 2 2 l i 2 14 1 2 2 o 1 1 2 2 i 2 provided that is sufficiently small the next lemma derives some necessary conditions for optimality and provides a useful rep resentation of the minimizing function lemma 4 in the same setting as lemma 3 let be a minimizer for the problem 4 8 4 9 then choosing 0 small enough the following holds for all s 0 t one has s t s t e t s s d s d 4 44 where is a positive measure supported on the contact set s 0 t s proof 1 calling the signed distance from the boundary as in 2 12 the mini mization 4 8 4 9 can be reformulated as a standard problem of optimal control with state constraints here is the control function the state of the system is y s y 1 y 2 y 3 s r 3 3 1 with dynamics y 1 s s y 2 s s y 1 s s y 3 s 1 2 e s s 2 y 1 0 0 y 2 0 0 y 3 0 0 4 45 and the cost function is g y 3 t e ty 3 t 20 here y 2 s s indeed an integration by parts yields y 2 s s s 0 0 s ds d s s 0 s d the state constraint is y 2 s 0 for all s 0 t 4 46 necessary conditions for optimality are provided in 10 theorem 9 5 1 namely there exists a lagrange multiplier 0 an absolutely continuous adjoint vector p p 1 p 2 p 3 and a non negative radon measure not all identically zero such that the following holds i the vector p provides a carathe odory solution to the linear cauchy problem on 0 t p 1 s q 2 s s p 2 s 0 p 3 s 0 p 1 t 0 q 2 t 0 p 3 t e t 4 47 where q 2 s p 2 s 0 s y 2 d if 0 s t p 2 t 0 t y 2 d if s t ii for a e s 0 t one has the optimality condition p 1 s s 1 2 e sp 3 s s 2 sup r 3 p 1 s 1 2 e sp 3 s 2 4 48 iii the positive measure is supported on the region where the curve touches the obstacle supp s 0 t y 2 s 0 4 49 2 we claim that if at least one of the conditions 4 8 4 9 is not satisfied then the above necessary conditions hold with 1 indeed assume on the contrary that 0 then the optimality condition 4 48 can be satisfied only if p 1 s 0 in turn this implies p 1 s s t d s 0 for all s 0 t 4 50 furthermore since p and cannot all be zero this implies 6 0 now consider the integral t 0 d 21 where 0 is a control which satisfies 4 22 and 4 23 and is a measure satisfying the necessary conditions taking the first variation w r t one obtains d d t 0 d 0 t 0 0 d d t 0 t d d t 0 0 d t d d t 0 0 d p 1 d 0 4 51 on the other hand integrating with respect to on 0 t it follows from equation 4 23 that d d t 0 d 0 0 t 0 which is a contradiction this proves that 1 3 by the previous step the necessary conditions are satisfied with 1 in particular from the conditions ii iii it follows that p 1 s t s t s d s d while s e t s p 1 s t s t e t s s d s d this concludes the proof the above construction allows us to define a nonlinear push out operator p as follows for convenience given an angular velocity r 3 we shall denote by r the 3 3 rotation matrix r ea k 0 ak k a 0 3 2 3 0 1 2 1 0 4 52 notice that for every v r 3 the image r v is the value at time t 1 of the solution to v t v t v 0 v next given h 2 0 t r 3 let be the minimizer for the corresponding problem 4 8 4 9 using the the notation 4 52 then define p s s 0 r 0 d d 4 53 here r is the rotation operator defined as in 4 52 the difference is still o 1 2 l 2 but it may be easier to estimate the difference p h 2 we refer to p as the push out operator 22 remark 6 in general p 6 therefore it may not be true that p s for all s 0 t however the two curves are very close indeed differentiating 4 6 we obtain s s s 0 d s r s 0 d s o 1 2 l 1 4 54 therefore s p s o 1 2 l 1 0 t o 1 2 l 2 0 t 4 55 in particular by 4 41 the curve p can penetrate inside the obstacle at most by the amount e p o 1 2 l 2 c e 2 4 56 for some uniform constant c 5 proof of theorem 1 1 differentiating 3 3 w r t s one obtains an equation for the tangent vector k t h 1 0 t r 3 after an integration w r t t this can be written as k t s k t 0 s t 0 s 0 p k d k s d t t 0 h s d 5 1 here p t s is given by 2 6 while h is an element of the cone h 0 t 7 r 3 there exists a positive measure supported on the contact set 0 in 2 25 such that for every s 0 t one has h s s 0 e n s p s p d s d k s 5 2 this integral equation should be solved for t s t 0 t 0 t for some t t 0 with initial data k t 0 s k s p s if s 0 t 0 p t 0 if s t 0 t 5 3 notice that kt t s is always perpendicular to k t s therefore k t s 1 for all t s moreover since t 0 t every element h t t is constant for s t t by 5 1 this confirms that k t is constant for s t t 2 to construct a sequence of approximate solutions we use an operator splitting approxi mation scheme let 0 p be the curve of initial data as in 4 5 consider a small neighborhood v of 0 for which the conclusions of lemmas 1 3 hold fix a time step 0 and set tk t 0 k assume that the approximate solution k k t s has been constructed for all times t 0 tk 1 and s 0 t to extend the solution on the next time interval tk 1 tk we proceed as follows 23 first we construct an approximate solution of the problem without obstacle recalling the notation introduced at 4 52 for a rotation matrix we define k t s r t tk 1 s tk 1 0 tk 1 p tk 1 k tk 1 d k tk 1 s 5 4 for t tk 1 tk and s 0 t taking t tk the above construction produces a curve s 7 s p tk s s 0 k t d in general the physically meaningful portion of this curve s p tk s s 0 tk 5 5 may well partly lie inside the obstacle using the push out operator 4 53 we then replace p tk by a new curve by setting p tk s p p tk s s 0 r 0 k d ps tk d s 0 t 5 6 equivalently k tk s r s 0 k d k tk s 5 7 as in lemma 3 here k is the unique minimizer for the problem 4 8 4 9 with 0 tk 7 r 3 as in 5 5 according to lemma 4 we have the representation k s e tk s tk s tk k s d k s ps tk d 5 8 where k is a positive measure supported on the contact set k s 0 tk k t s 5 9 applying fubini s theorem one can exchange the order of integration in 5 8 and obtain k s e tk s tk s k s s s ps tk d d k s e tk s tk s k s p tk s p tk s d k s 5 10 by 4 41 and 4 56 as long as the approximation remains inside the neighborhood v there exists a constant c 3 such that recalling the definition 4 40 one has k l 2 0 tk c 3 e tk p tk 5 11 e tk p tk c 3 e 2 tk p tk 5 12 moreover the depth at which the curve p tk penetrates the obstacle is estimated by e tk p tk e tk 1 p tk 1 c 4 5 13 24 for some constant c 4 for every 0 sufficiently small the above estimates 5 12 5 13 yield the implication e tk 1 p tk 1 e tk p tk by assumption the initial condition lies outside the obstacle i e e tk p t 0 0 5 14 by induction for all 0 small enough and all k 1 we thus conclude e tk p tk 5 15 in turn by 5 11 5 12 this implies an estimate of the form k l 2 0 tk c 5 5 16 3 we claim that for every 0 and k 1 the total mass of the positive measure k in 5 8 is bounded by k k 0 tk c 6 5 17 for some constant c 6 independent of k indeed 4 41 implies p tk s k s o 1 k l 1 o 1 taking 0 tk 7 r 3 as in 5 5 and integrating the left hand side of 4 23 w r t the measure k we obtain k 0 tk 0 tk s 0 p tk s p tk d p tk s d k s tk 0 tk p tk s k s p tk s p tk d k s d tk 0 tk k s p tk s p tk d k s d tk 0 c k d t 0 k d c l 1 k l 2 k l 2 5 18 for some constant c independent of k by 4 22 we have l 1 0 tk tk l 2 0 tk t c 0 while 4 41 implies k l 1 k l 2 o 1 choosing 0 small enough so that c l 1 1 2 from 5 18 we deduce 1 2 k l 2 k l 2 o 1 this yields the estimate 5 17 25 using 5 17 in 5 10 we can refine the estimate 5 16 and conclude that k l 0 tk c 9 5 19 for some constant c 9 independent of k 4 by the previous arguments for every time step 0 sufficiently small we obtain a piece wise continuous approximate solution k k t s defined for s 0 t and t t 0 t here t is the supremum of all times for which the corresponding curve p s s 0 k d remains in the neighborhood v we now observe that for every 0 small enough and k 1 as long as the approximation p t remains inside v one has k t k t h 1 0 tk 1 c 7 t t for all t t tk 1 tk 5 20 k tk k tk h 1 0 tk c 7 5 21 for some constant c 7 independent of k indeed the first estimate is an immediate conse quence of the boundedness of the second estimate follows from 5 16 as long as the approximations remain inside v the bounds 5 20 5 21 imply an estimate of the form k t k h 1 0 t c 8 t 5 22 for some constant c 8 and all t since by construction p t 0 0 k t 0 k 0 for all t 0 from 5 22 we deduce p tk v for all t 0 t 5 23 for some t 0 independent of thanks to the above estimates we conclude that for 0 sufficiently small all the approx imations k k t s are well defined to achieve the convergence of a subsequence two observations are in order as maps from t 0 t into h 1 0 t all functions t 7 k t have uniformly bounded total variation for every t consider the difference of the partial derivatives w t s s k t s s k s then for every t t 0 t the map s 7 w t s is uniformly lipschitz continuous indeed this is because i the integral in 5 4 is uniformly bounded for all k and ii the function k in 5 7 satisfies the uniform bound 5 19 as a consequence all functions k t remain within a fixed compact subset k h 1 0 t r 3 26 thanks to the above properties we can thus extract a subsequence n 0 and achieve the h 1 convergence k n t k t uniformly for t t 0 t 5 in this step we study the convergence of the measures k for any fixed 0 let be the positive measure on t 0 t r whose restriction to tk 1 tk r coincides with the product l k here l denotes the lebesgue measure in other words for every subinterval a b tk 1 tk and every open set v r we have a b v b a 1 k v 5 24 in view of the uniform bound 5 18 we can extract a weakly convergent subsequence so that more precisely see 1 there exists a measurable family of uniformly bounded positive measures t t 0 t such that for every continuous function r 2 7 r one has lim 0 t 0 t s d t s t 0 t s d t s t 0 t s d t s dt 5 25 for each 0 and t 0 t we define t s 0 t k s supp k 5 26 where k is the unique index such that t tk 1 tk k 1 k by 4 55 5 16 and 5 22 it follows that k t s p t s uniformly on dt now fix any 0 and consider the set v t s 0 t d p t s in view of the uniform convergence k k and p p as 0 it follows that t v t for all 0 sufficiently small by the weak convergence one has supp t lim sup 0 t v t for any 0 and t 0 t since 0 was arbitrary this implies supp t t s 0 t p t s 5 27 for all t 0 t 6 we complete the proof by showing that k provides the desired solution by 5 15 letting 0 it is clear that p t s for all t 0 t and s 0 t it remains to prove that for every t t 0 t the identity 5 1 holds with h s s 0 e n s p s p d s d k s s 0 e p s p s p d s d k s 5 28 here t 0 t is the family of measures constructed in step 5 27 the identity 5 1 will be obtained by taking the limit as 0 of the identities 5 4 and 5 7 satisfied by k by the previous analysis as 0 we have k t s k t s p t s s 0 k t d s 0 k t d p t s 5 29 uniformly for t s t 0 t 0 t to handle the right hand side of 5 1 we start with matrix estimate i a 1 an v ea 1 eanv o 1 i ai 2 v which implies as a special case v 1 n v r 1 r n v o 1 i i 2 v 5 30 using the notation t k t 0 k k t max k 0 t k t in view of 5 30 we can write k t s k t 0 s lim 0 k t k 0 tk s 0 t k p t k k t k d k t k s lim 0 k t k 0 tk s e t k s p t k s p t k 1 s p t k 1 s d k s k tk s 5 31 by the uniform convergence 5 29 and the smoothness of the function the first term on the right hand side of 5 31 converges to the corresponding term in 5 1 moreover recalling 5 24 and using the weak convergence we conclude that the second term on the right hand side of 5 31 converges to the corresponding term in 5 1 this completes the proof 6 more general models all previous results can be extended to the case where 0 so that all sections of the stem undergo a linear elongation exponentially decreasing in time in addition following remark 1 one can also consider deformations which minimize the more general deforma tion energy 2 27 where the twist and bending components are given different weights we describe below the minor differences in the analysis required by these extensions when the unit tangent vector k to the stem is given by 2 3 and the formula 2 6 is replaced by 2 4 the evolution of k t s is still described by 5 1 replacing 3 5 with t p k 1 e t e t k e 3 p k 6 1 28 next we derive the appropriate replacements for the cones in 3 4 and in 5 2 as in 2 3 call k t the unit tangent vector to the curve p t at the point given any vector function we define the orthogonal decomposition twist bend where twist k t bend k t denote the components parallel and orthogonal to the vector k t respectively consider the constrained optimization problem minimize e 1 2 s 0 1 e t e t c 1 twist 2 c 2 bend 2 d 6 2 subject to the constraint p t s s 0 1 e t p t s p t d p t s 0 6 3 to derive the appropriate necessary conditions consider a family of perturbations of the form twist bend twist bend arguing as in 2 17 we differentiate e w r t at 0 and eventually obtain s 0 1 e t e t c 1 twist twist c 2 bend bend d s 0 1 e t p t s p t s p t d 6 4 for some lagrange multiplier notice that by orthogonality the inner products satisfy twist twist twist bend bend bend since the relation 6 4 holds true for every perturbation one obtains c 1 twist c 2 bend e t p t s p t s p t 6 5 projecting the above equation on the subspaces parallel and perpendicular to k t respec tively with obvious meaning of notation we finally obtain twist c 1 e t p t s p t s p t twist bend c 2 e t p t s p t s p t bend 6 6 in place of 2 26 the cone of admissible velocities can now be defined as t v 0 t 7 r 3 there exists a positive measure supported on t such that v s s 0 1 e t e t t n t s c 1 p t s p t twist n t s c 2 p t s p t bend d s p t s p t d 6 7 29 accordingly the cone in 5 2 is now replaced by h 0 t 7 r 3 there exists a positive measure supported on such that h s s 0 1 e t e t t n t s c 1 p t s p t twist n t s c 2 p t s p t bend d s d k t s d 6 8 all the previous arguments can be applied to this more general situation with minor changes 7 numerical
