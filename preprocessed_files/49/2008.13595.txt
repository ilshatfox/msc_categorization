spaces of functions converging at infinity in particular spaces of continuous functions lebesgue spaces and sequence spaces in each framework we show versions of riesz s representation theorem keywords riesz s representation theorem banach space dual space 1 motivation the need of continuous functions converging at infinity arose in our considerations of infinite horizon optimal control problems in 3 in this framework the methods of convex optimization led to challenges hidden deep inside the complex theory as an illustration consider the constraint k t t 0 k s ds k t 0 k t k for all t 0 then the continuous trajectory x k k satisfies the inequality x t 0 on 0 iff 1 x belongs to the cone k z c 0 r z t 0 for all t 0 2 the inequality f x sup t 0 x t 0 holds thereby f is convex on c 0 r the particular space c 0 0 r of continuous functions vanishing at infinity provides a riesz representation theorem including the regular signed borel measures on 0 cf 2 but in this framework the following degenerations arising 1 the cone k z c 0 0 r z t 0 for all t 0 possesses an empty interior let z k with z t 0 on 0 and consider the sequence zn t z t t 6 2 n 1 2 n 1 z t 2 z 2 n t 2 n 1 2 n 1 t t 2 n 1 2 n 1 then zn z 0 as n and zn 6 k for all n hence in the space c 0 0 r the interior of k and the origin cannot be separated by the hahn banach separation theorem for convex sets therefore the basic tool in convex optimization cannot be applied 1 http arxiv org abs 2008 13595 v 1 2 in the space c 0 0 r the subdifferential of f x sup t 0 x t delivers in x 0 the set of all non negative regular borel measures on 0 with the non strict attribute 1 indeed by definition of f 0 we obtain in the space c 0 r r the inequalities sup t r x t 0 x t d t sup t r x t inf t r x t this shows 0 and 1 moreover for any function z c 0 0 r with z t 0 on 0 the subdifferential f z x f 0 f z x z delivers 0 sup t 0 z t 0 z t d t 0 but 0 may lead to the degenerated case of trivial lagrange multipliers in 3 we proposed to consider the space of continuous functions converging at infinity then the optimization methods require a riesz representation theorem as a path to riesz representation theorem in the space of continuous functions converging at infinity one may use a compactification of 0 e g by t s s 1 s s 0 the inverse mapping s t t 1 t maps 0 1 onto 0 then the transformation generating the additional weight 1 1 s 2 therefore a riesz s representation theorem achieved by transformation of 0 1 onto 0 depends on the particularly chosen transformation in the subsequent sections we provide a transformation free statement of the riesz s representation theorem our approach follows the methods of functional analysis 2 basic notations and definitions throughout this preprint we make frequently use of the notations r 0 r 0 r r thereby r denotes the affinely extended real number system obtained from the real number system r by adding the elements and by the continuous mapping x x 1 x the extended real number line r is homeomorphic to the interval 1 1 hence r is an open and compact subset of r a set u is a neighborhood of if and only if it contains a set x x a for some real number a neighborhoods of can be defined analogously definition 2 1 a let i r the borel algebra b i on i consists of all open subsets of i b the borel algebra b r on r consists of all sets b a e with a b r and e c the borel algebra b r on r consists of all sets b a e with a b r and e definition 2 2 a borel measure defined on the borel algebra b i i r is regular if a sup b b a b compact and measurable and a inf c c a copen and measurable for any a b i 2 let be a signed measure on r and let the system ei of measureable sets ei be a countable parti tion of r as stated in rudin 2 in the case of r the absolute convergence of the series i 1 ei is now part of the requirements of a signed measure on r let be a signed regular borel measure on b r let and are signed measures concentrated at t and t respectively since r is open and compact a signed borel measure on b r is regular if and only if possesses the representation definition 2 3 a let i r m i denotes the set of signed regular borel measures on b i b by m r we denote the set of the signed regular borel measures on b r any m r has the unique representation where m r and is a signed regular borel measure concentrated at t c by m r we denote the set of the signed regular borel measures on b r any m r has the unique representation where m r and where and are signed regular borel measure concentrated at t and t respectively in the definitions 2 1 and 2 3 we introduced the objects b i the borel algebra on i r m i the set of regular signed borel measures on b i in the subsequent sections the following banach spaces are of our interest clim r r n the space of continuous functions converging at infinity section 4 clim r r n the space of continuous functions converging at t section 4 lp lim r r n lebesgue spaces of functions converging in measure at infinity section 5 lp lim r r n lebesgue spaces of functions converging in measure at t section 5 w 1 p lim r r n sobolev spaces of functions converging in measure at infinity section 6 p lim spaces of convergent sequences section 6 definition 2 4 a we say x r r n converges at infinity to a rn if for every 0 there exists n 0 such that x t a for all t n then we write lim t x t a b we say x r r n converges in lebesgue measure at infinity to a rn if for every 0 lim n t n x t a 0 the limit is denoted by lim t x t definition 2 5 let x y be banach spaces let x y be linear and continuous a the set im y y x y x x denotes the range of b the set ker x x x 0 is the kernel of c ker x x x x 0 for all x ker denotes the annihilator of ker d the adjoint operator y x of is the linear operator defined by y x y x for all x x and y y e the set im x x x y y y denotes the range of 3 3 basic concepts in the subsequent sections we achieve different versions of riesz representation theorem in spaces of functions converging at infinity our basic tool is the closed range theorem cf 4 theorem 3 1 closed range theorem let x y be banach spaces let x y be linear and continuous then has a closed range in y if and only if ker im in this section we outline the specific concepts where the first concept concerns the functions on r while the second concept aims continuous functions on r throughout this section let x 0 be a given banach space of mappings x 0 r r n with norm x 0 x be the space of all x r r n which possesses a unique representation x t x 0 t a on r where x 0 x 0 and a r n x be equipped with a p norm e g x p x x 0 p x 0 a p if 1 p and x x x 0 x 0 a if p then x becomes a banach space first scheme the subsequent result provides directly the versions of riesz representation theorem in banach spaces x where x 0 is c 0 r r n lp r r n or p with 1 p lemma 3 2 any continuous linear functional x on x can be uniquely represented in the form x x x 0 x a t a x x 0 x 0 x 0 r n proof any x x has the unique representation x x 0 a with x 0 x 0 and a r n consider the linear mapping with x x 0 which maps x onto x 0 then ker consists of all x x with x 0 0 by definition of x is continuous let x x we denote by i the value of the functional x at the vector valued function whose i th component is identical 1 and whose remaining components are identically zero now we consider the functional x 1 x defined by the formula x 1 x x x t a x t x 0 t a 1 n obviously x 1 ker by theorem 3 1 there exists a functional x 0 x 0 with x 1 x 0 that means the equation x 1 x x 0 x x 0 x x 0 x 0 holds for all x x consequently for x x we obtain the representation x x x 1 x t a x 0 x 0 t a x 0 x a t a finally the uniqueness of this representation can be verified directly second scheme our consideration of functions x on r bases on a splitting argument each x can be uniquely split into the parts on the positive and negative real axis by x 1 t x 2 t x t x t t r in the particular case of continuous functions we have to preserve the continuity at t 0 and determine the splitting by x 1 t x 2 t x t x 0 x t x 0 t r according to the latter splitting we introduce the subspace y y x y 0 0 of x therefore any y y possesses the representation y t x 0 t a with x 0 x 0 a r n and with the additional attribute y 0 0 then the splitting leads to a mapping which maps onto the product y y thus we have to provide a representation formula on y 4 lemma 3 3 any continuous linear functional y on y can be uniquely represented in the form y y x 0 y a y x 0 x 0 x 0 proof we consider the linear mapping y y a which maps the space y onto x 0 since any y y possesses the representation y t x 0 t a with x 0 x 0 a r n the inequality y a x x 0 x 0 x 0 x 0 a y x holds on y therefore is continuous moreover ker 0 let y y by theorem 3 1 there exists a functional x 0 x 0 with y x 0 this shows y y x 0 y x 0 y a the uniqueness of this representation can be verified directly 4 spaces of continuous functions converging at infinity we consider the space clim r r n of continuous vector functions converging at infinity clim r r n x c r r n lim t x t a rn exists x r r n x t x 0 t a x 0 c 0 r r n a rn in the considerations in the previous section we equipped the space x with a p norm but in the fra mework of the space clim r r n the norms x and x x x 0 a differ therefore we have to show the equivalence of both norms on clim r r n lemma 4 1 on clim r r n the norms x and x x x 0 a are equivalent proof by definition any x clim r r n possesses the unique representation x x 0 a with x 0 c 0 r r n and a rn since x t a as t the inequality x a holds let x 0 a then we obtain immediately x x 2 x in the case a x 0 there exists 0 1 with a x 0 it follows x x 0 a max x 0 a a min 0 1 max 1 x 0 1 2 x 0 consequently the inequalities x x x 3 x hold on clim r r n in the following we make use of the notation x lim t x t instead of the vector a rn lemma 4 2 riesz s representation theorem on clim r r n any continuous linear functional x on clim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x 0 x t x d t tx 0 x 0 t d t tx where 1 n is a vector of measures 1 n m r cf 2 and r n proof the representation formula follows directly from lemma 3 2 with x 0 c 0 r r n in lemma 4 2 let t 0 d t and then the riesz s representation theorem on clim r r n becomes the equivalent form 5 lemma 4 3 any continuous linear functional x on clim r r n can be uniquely represented by x x 0 x t d t where 1 n is a vector of signed regular borel measures 1 n m r now we consider the space clim r r n which we define by clim r r n x c r rn lim t x t x lim t x t x exist since we have to take into account both limits x and x the previous approach to the space clim r r n is not applicable therefore we will make use of the splitting argument lemma 4 4 riesz s representation theorem on clim r r n any continuous linear functional x on clim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x x t d t t 1 x t 2 x where is a vector of signed regular borel measures on r and 1 2 r n or equivalently in the form x x x t d t where 1 n is a vector of signed regular borel measures 1 n m r proof let y clim r r n be the subspace y y clim r r n y 0 0 we split x clim r r n into x 1 x 2 by x 1 t x 2 t x t x 0 x t x 0 with t r the operator x x 1 x 2 maps the space clim r r n onto the product y y the mapping is linear and continuous and ker consists of all constant functions x clim r r n as in the proof of lemma 4 2 we define the vector and consider x 1 c lim r r n defined by the formula x 1 x x x tx obviously x 1 ker by theorem 3 1 there exists a functional y y 1 y 2 y y with x 1 y that means the equation x 1 x y x y x y 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 holds for all x clim r r n the functions x 1 x 2 y possessing the limits lim t x 1 t lim t x t x 0 x x 0 lim t x 2 t lim t x t x 0 x x 0 then lemma 3 3 yields the representations y 1 x 1 0 x 1 t x 1 d 1 t 0 x t x d 1 t y 2 x 2 0 x 2 t x 2 d 2 t 0 x t x d 2 t where 1 2 are vectors of signed regular borel measures on r by definition of x 1 we obtain x x 0 x t x d 1 t 0 x t x d 2 t tx finally we determine 1 2 1 and by 1 0 d 1 t 2 0 d 2 t 1 t 1 t 1 2 then the representation formula in lemma 4 4 is shown 6 5 lebesgue spaces of functions converging at infinity throughout this section let 1 p and let q determined by 1 p 1 q 1 if p 1 and q if p 1 since the representation of x x in section 3 has to be unique the parameter p must be restricted to p for an introduction of the lebesgue spaces lp r r n cf 4 we consider the lebesgue space lp lim r r n defined by lp lim r r n x r r n x t x 0 t a x 0 lp r r n a rn the space lp lim r r n is equipped with the norm x p lp lim x 0 p lp a p furthermore any x lp lim r r n possesses at infinity a limit we write x lim t x t a lemma 5 1 let 1 p any x l p lim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x 0 y t x t x dt tx y lq r r n rn proof the representation formula follows directly from lemma 3 2 with x 0 lp r r n now we consider the lebesgue space lp lim r r n which we define by lp lim r r n x r rn x t x 0 t a 1 on r x t x 0 t a 2 on r x 0 lp r r n a 1 a 2 r n lp lim r r n is equipped with the norm x p lp lim x p lp a 1 p a 2 p moreover we deter mine the limits x a 1 and x a 2 lemma 5 2 let 1 p any x l p lim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x y t x t dt t 1 x t 2 x y lq r r n 1 2 r n proof any x lp lim r r n can be split into x 1 x 2 lp lim r r n by x x 1 x 2 x 1 t x 2 t x t x t t r the operator maps the space lp lim r r n onto lp lim r r n lp lim r r n moreover is linear and continuous and ker 0 by theorem 3 1 any x l p lim r r n possesses the representation x x y x y x y 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 y 2 l p lim r r n that means there are unique 1 2 r n and y 1 y 2 lq r r n with y 1 x 1 0 y 1 t x 1 t x 1 dt t 1 x 1 0 y 1 t x t x dt t 1 x y 2 x 2 0 y 2 t x 2 t x 2 dt t 2 x 2 0 y 2 t x t x dt t 2 x finally the representation formula follows by the determination of y by y t y 1 t on r and y t y 2 t on r and of 1 2 by 1 1 0 y t dt 2 2 0 y t dt 7 6 remarks spaces of continuous functions the introduction of the space clim r r n were motivated by degenerations in the convex optimization on r in this context we note 1 the interior of the cone k z clim r r z t 0 for all t r is non empty and containing any x clim r r with max t r x t 0 2 we consider f x max t r x t by definition of f 0 we obtain in the space clim r r max t r x t 0 x t d t max t r x t min t r x t this shows that the subdifferential of f consists in x 0 of those and only those non negative borel measures m r which satisfy 1 lebesgue spaces the introduction of the spaces lp lim r r n and the lemma 5 1 deliver a if 1 p the spaces lp lim r r n are reflexive banach spaces and y lq r r n and rn in lemma 5 1 determine z y lq lim r r n b the space l 2 lim r r n is a separable hilbert space c any x l 2 lim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x 0 a with x 0 a l 2 r r n rn let x y l 2 lim r r n with x x 0 a y y 0 b then the inner product in the space l 2 lim r r n has the form x y l 2 lim x 0 a y 0 b l 2 lim x 0 y 0 l 2 a t b d let 0 1 be an orthonormal basis in l 2 r r the introduction of l 2 lim r r leads to the system 0 1 0 0 1 0 which is an orthonormal basis in l 2 lim r r e in the application of hilbert space methods in the frame work of the space l 2 lim r r the splitting concept suggests to split x l 2 lim r r into x 1 x 2 and to consider the fourier series expansions of x 1 x 2 l 2 lim r r separately sequence spaces let 1 p we determine the sequence space p lim by x p lim x xn n n xn x 0 n a x 0 x 0 n n n p a r x p p lim x 0 p p a p the elements of the spaces p lim are convergent sequences lemma 6 1 let 1 p any x p lim can be uniquely represented in form x x n n yn xn a a n n ynx 0 n a y q r proof the first scheme in section 3 holds if we consider mappings from n to rn therefore the representation formula follows directly from lemma 3 2 with x 0 p 8 sobolev spaces let 1 p and let q determined by 1 p 1 q 1 if p 1 and q if p 1 for an introduction of sobolev spaces w 1 p r r n we refer to 4 we consider the sobolev space w 1 p lim r r n defined by w 1 p lim r r n x r r n x t x 0 t a x 0 w 1 p r r n a rn we equip the space w 1 p lim r r n with the norm x p w 1 p lim x p w 1 p a p furthermore x w 1 p lim r r n possesses at infinity the limit x lim t x t a lemma 6 2 let 1 p any x w 1 p lim r r n can be uniquely represented in the form x x x 0 x x tx x 0 w 1 p r r n rn proof the assertion follows directly by lemma 3 2
