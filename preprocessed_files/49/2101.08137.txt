introduces a novel epidemiological model that simultaneously considers multiple viral strains reinfections due to waning immunity response over time and an optimal control formulation this enables us to derive optimal mitigation strate gies over a prescribed time horizon under a more realistic framework that does not imply perennial immunity and a single strain although these can also be derived as particular cases of our formulation the model also allows estimation of the number of infections over time in the absence of mitigation strategies under any number of viral strains we validate our approach in the light of the covid 19 epidemic and present a number of experiments to shed light on the overall behaviour under one or preprint submitted to elsevier january 21 2021 ar x iv 2 10 1 08

respiratory syndrome coron avirus 2 sars cov 2 is believed to have appeared at the end of 2019 in wuhan china rodriguez morales et al 2020 this new highly transmissi ble virus spread rapidly around the world causing significant loss of life and possibly long lasting economic consequences the significance of the epidemic prompted a large amount of literature and highlighted the need for compre hensive models combining epidemiology and decision support to help shape public policy see for example the influential work by ferguson et al 2020 many mathematical models and data analytic tools have been proposed to un derstand the evolution of the covid 19 pandemic throughout the world gen erally based on classical epidemiological models bacaer 2011 kermack et al 1927 for example ferguson et al 2020 promoted non pharmaceutical in terventions and flaxman et al 2020 evaluated the effect of such measures in europe later tarrataca et al 2021 evaluated the effectiveness of long term corresponding

the possibility of reinfection or multiple viral strains similarly these possibilities were also disregarded in investiga tions of optimal strategies to exit lock down which also did not consider the possibility of multiple waves of infection rawson et al 2020 ruktanonchai et al 2020 also essential to shape public policy and prevention and treatment strategies is a thorough understanding of the mechanism of the pandemic this includes the genomics mapping of viral strains callaway 2020 korber et al 2020 which when carried out in brazil revealed more than 100 viral strains of covid 19 resende et al 2020 vieira et al 2021 voloch et al 2020 three of which managed to survive such a reduction in genetic diversity has been attributed to the social isolation measures in that country candido et al 2020 distinct strains have also been recently identified in the united kingdom kirby 2021 and south africa tegally et al 2020 which have rapidly spread around the globe further studies are needed to properly assess the mortality rate of these new variants but the uk strain is already believed to be around 60 to 70 more transmissible than the original variant another important challenge to modellers is that the immune response to covid 19 is not uniform long et al 2020 may reportedly wane over time dan et al 2021 edridge et al 2020 seow et al 2020 and reinfection is possible bonifacio et al 2020 tillett et al 2021 furthermore the same patient may be infected by different strains of the virus nonaka et al 2021 to et al 2020 overbaugh 2020 argues that a thorough understanding of reinfection is essential for understanding the spread of the disease whereas dawood 2020 foretells future global challenges to contain epidemics with reinfection from a more operational standpoint a recent work made use of available databases and the classical sir susceptible infected recovered 3 framework to estimate the number of covid 19 reinfections from empirical data mcmahon and robb 2020 although covid 19 reinfection and multiple viral strains have received in creased attention in the literature mathematical modelling that incorporates these characteristics is still scarce khyar and allali 2020 searched for sta bility conditions within a general two strain model and assessed the effect of a quarantine strategy to curb covid 19 spread in morocco more generally viral reinfection is often studied with emphasis on stability conditions and disease free equilibrium e g frid et al 2003 in particular etbaigha et al 2018 proposed a seir susceptible exposed infected removed model for swine influenza and analysed the effect of prescribed vaccination strategies finally a simpler sir model is employed in fudolig and howard 2020 to study the dynamics of two viral strains considering that the second strain ap pears after the first strain reaches equilibrium in general whilst these models examine long term stability they do not incorporate decision support tools and optimisation to support decision making optimal control approaches have been proposed to promote compromises between covid 19 infection levels and economic consequences of non pharmaceutical interventions bursac et al 2020 kant ner and koprucki 2020 perkins and espan a 2020 the control mechanism may consist of a proportional reduction in the infection levels kantner and koprucki 2020 perkins and espan a 2020 or include quarantine isolation and public health education bursac et al 2020 even though these mod els do not account for reinfection and multiple viral strains they do provide interesting insights perhaps the most interesting insight is that high levels of control are needed from the beginning to preserve healthcare systems and leverage control options late in the epidemics perkins and espan a 2020 this is consistent with the empirical results in tarrataca et al 2021 4 whereas models considering multiple viral strains are rare one can still find in the literature optimal control approaches based on classical epidemiological models for two viral strains bentaleb et al 2020 gubar et al 2017 these are general epidemiological models i e not specifically tailored for a given epidemic that do not consider reinfection a limiting feature of the model of bentaleb et al 2020 however is that it relies on a curative treatment in contrast the discrete network based model of gubar et al 2017 relies on individual control measures to be applied separately to each of the two strains to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to simultaneously consider multiple viral strains reinfection and optimal control amongst the novel con tributions of this work we generalise the preceding literature bentaleb et al 2020 gubar et al 2017 khyar and allali 2020 by considering not only two but any number of viral strains based on the seir framework the model innovates by accounting for the loss of immunity over time and contemplating the possibility of reinfection which has the potential to considerably increase the infection levels over time finally we propose a novel optimal control ap proach whereby a proportional reduction of the infection rate by mitigation measures such as non pharmaceutical interventions incurs an exponentially increasing cost we argue that this approach is more realistic than assuming linear or quadratic costs e g bursac et al 2020 perkins and espan a 2020 once it has become clear that reduction in transmission is increasingly difficult to obtain and therefore increasingly more costly once mitigating measures are already in place the proposed approach seeks for a compromise between the overall number of deaths and the intervention costs over a prescribed horizon in addition to the methodological innovations we also contribute by providing a more realistic framework for epidemic modelling that avoids the sometimes optimistic assumptions of perennial immunity and a single viral strain the framework also includes an optimal control formulation that enables the deci sion makers to clearly define the compromises between loss of life and economic 5 consequences over a prolonged time horizon the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the multi strain model with reinfection and section 3 analyses its equilibrium points and the reproductive number section 4 proposes a novel optimal con trol formulation for the multi strain model which is solved to derive the opti mal control strategy over a prescribed time horizon section 5 features a series of experiments designed to illustrate the system s behaviour in the presence of one and two strains and with insufficient mitigation measures furthermore it also derives and interprets optimal control strategies over a two year horizon under distinct mitigation costs finally section 6 concludes the paper 2 proposed mathematical model let v 1 n be the set of virus strains circulating in the population and let j v denote a particular strain for each j v and time t 0 let sj t ej t ij t and rj t respectively denote the number of susceptible exposed infected and removed recovered and immune individuals in the population at time t in addition p t denotes the total population at time t 0 the susceptible population sj t includes all individuals that are not immune strain j v at time t 0 and therefore can catch the disease in turn ej t comprises all individuals that have been recently contaminated by strain j but are currently in the latency period and therefore have not yet manifested the disease and become infectious finally ij t counts all individuals that have caught and manifested the strain j and are still suffering from it whereas rj t denotes the total number of individuals that are recovered and immune to strain j at time t 6 the proposed multi strain model follows eq 1 5 below p t n j 1 jij 1 sj t p t ej t ij t rj t 2 e j t 1 u t jsj t ij t jej t 3 i j t jej t j j ij t 4 r j t jij t jrj t 5 where sj 0 p 0 j v for

consider the dynamics of a given strain j v observe from eq 3 that sus ceptible individuals can contract this strain when in contact with a contagious carrier belonging to the infected population the rate of infection is j 0 and u t 0 1 emulates the lock down effect at time t 0 u t 1 indi cates 100 effective mitigating measures and u t 0 represents the absence of non pharmaceutical interventions whereas u t 0 1 indicates partially effective measures to limit the spread of the disease the first term in the right 7 hand side of 3 represents the formerly susceptible individuals that have just been infected whereas the second term indicates the exposed individuals that have just manifested the once latent disease the latter enter the infected compartment in the right hand side of eq 4 the second term in the right hand side of 4 represents infected individuals that recover at rate j 0 or die at rate j 0 finally each newly recovered individual moves to the removed compartment first term of the right hand side of 5 the second term in the right hand side of 5 represents the loss of immunity over time finally eq 2 keeps track of the individuals that are currently susceptible to strain j

days 1 u t mitigation lock down effect at time t 3 the equilibrium points to simplify our analysis in this section we assume a constant control i e u t u 0 1 t 0 a simple inspection to the system of equations 8 1 5 yields s j t 1 u jsj t ij t jrj t n i 1 i 6 j iii t 6 hence it is not hard to verify that the trivial equilibrium point is the infection free point with ej ij rj 0 sj sj 0 p 0 7 to calculate the non trivial equilibrium we start with the case of two strains below theorem 1 suppose v 2 then besides the trivial equilibrium point in eq 7 the system has a non trivial equilibrium point with i 1 0 proof since v 2 we have exactly two roots one of which is the trivial equilibrium for the non trivial equilibrium we must have i 1 6 0 and i 2 6 0 hence by equalling the left hand side of 1 5 to zero we obtain s 1 s 1 1 1 1 u 1 s 1 s 2 2 2 1 u 2 e 1 e 1 1 1 2 i 2 1 1 e 2 e 2 2 2 i 2 2 i 1 i 1 2 i 2 1 i 2 i 2 r 1 r 1 1 2 i 2 1 1 r 2 r 2 2 i 2 2 since all coefficients are positive it follows that i 1 0 from theorem 1 it follows that the non trivial equilibrium point of a two strain model is biologically infeasible and therefore of no practical interest theorem 2 below generalises this result for multiple strains i e v 2 theorem 2 suppose v n 2 then besides the trivial equilibrium point in eq 7 the system has a non trivial equilibrium point with ij 0 j 9 1 n proof making the left hand side of eq 4 equal to zero yields ej j j j ij replacing this result in eq 3 we obtain 0 1 u jsjij jej 1 u jsjij j j ij 0 ij 1 u jsj j j therefore either ij 0 or sj j j 1 u j now substituting the latter equality in 6 and making the derivative nil we have 0 1 u jsjij jrj n i 1 i 6 j iii 1 u j j j 1 u j ij jrj n i 1 i 6 j iii 0 j j ij jrj n i 1 i 6 j iii 0 jij jrj n i 1 iii eq 5 0 n i 1 iii since j 0 j for the last equality to hold we must have either ij 0 j 0 1 n or ij 0 for at least one j 1 n theorem 2 therefore implies that the non trivial equilibrium point is biologi cally infeasible and of no practical use for any number of different strains in the remainder of this paper we will only consider biologically feasible solu tions 10 3 1 stability considering that only the trivial equilibrium points are of biological interest this section analyses the stability solely with respect to these points the system 1 5 has a dimension 4 n 1 consequently the jacobian matrix associated with the system and applied to the trivial equilibrium is of order 4 n 1 2 it has n 1 null eigenvalues and n eigenvalues equal to j j 1 n the remaining 2 n eigenvalues are given by 1 2 j j j 1 2 4 1 u j j sj j j j 2 1 2 j j j 1 2 4 1 u j j sj j j j 2 to prove stability we need to show that the real part of the eigenvalues are negative therefore it suffices to show that 1 2 j j j 1 2 4 1 u j j sj j j j 2 0 since this implies that the remaining eigenvalues will also be negative the expression above holds if 4 1 u j j sj j j j 2 j j j 4 1 u j j sj j j j 2 j j j 2 4 1 u j j sj j j j 2 j j j 2 1 u j sj j j from the latter inequality we can define the reproduction number r 0 max j 1 n 1 u j sj j j 8 we can say that the trivial equilibrium point without infection is locally asymptotically stable if r 0 1 hence eq 8 implies a minimum level of 11 constant lock down effect u 0 1 to stabilise the system observe that since the lock down effect applies to all viral strains it suffices to stabilise the system with respect to the most transmissible strain in the next section we expand the analysis to search for time varying lock down effects with a view to optimising the long term cost of non pharmaceutical lock down interventions 4 optimal lock down strategies to control the spread of the disease in the population the proposed strategy considers an isolation level of the population u t t 0 at any time t to account for the time varying control let us rewrite the system of equations 1 6 as follows p t n j 1 jij 9 s j t 1 u t jsj t ij t jrj t n i 1 i 6 j iii 10 e j t 1 u t jsj t ij t jej t 11 i j t jej t j j ij t 12 r j t jij t jrj t 13 to find a meaningful trade off between the cost of the control i e lock down measures or non pharmaceutical interventions and the cost of elevated infec tion levels to the healthcare system and the population in general we define the following functional cost j p u c 1 p ec 2 u 0 u 1 14 where c 1 0 and c 2 0 are scalar parameters 12 recall that in the revised formulation eq 9 13 u t 0 indicates no lock down and u t 1 corresponds to full lock down observe that the cost in 14 grows with the population size and decreases as a function of the control u while increasing u decreases the functional it also implies a decrease in the number of infections and therefore deaths and less deaths imply in an increased total population thus increasing the functional observe also that the cost of control increases exponentially in the feasible interval 0 1 to mimic the fact that extra mitigation measures tend to become increasingly costly let u t t 0 t u t 0 1 be a feasible lockdown strategy and let denote the set of all feasible strategies for each control strategy let j t 0 j p s u s ds 15 denote the overall cost of the strategy the optimal control problem then becomes maximise j subject to 9 13 16 the overall objective in 16 is to minimise the number of deaths over time which is equivalent to maximising the population whilst also accounting for the cost of lock down measures represented by the negative term in 14 4 1 solution of the optimal control problem the solve 16 we make use of pontryagin s maximum principe bryson and ho 1970 kirk 1970 pontryagin et al 1962 firstly we need to formulate 13 the hamiltonian function of our optimal control problem given by h c 1 p ec 2 u p p n j 1 sj s j n j 1 ej e j n j 1 ij i j n j 1 rj r j u 17 in the above equation p represents the co state variable corresponding to the original variable p similarly the subscript of the remaining co state variables indicates the corresponding original variable in addition 0 is a penalty multiplier added to ensure that u 0 at optimality we must have u 0 by deriving the hamiltonian with respect to the original variables in 9 13 we obtain adjoint system of equations with respect to the co state variables d p dt h p c 1 d sj dt h sj sj ej 1 u jij d ej dt h ej j ej ij d ij dt h ij sj ej 1 u jsj ij j j rj j p j j n i 1 i 6 j si d rj dt h rj j rj sj with transversality conditions p t sj t ej t ij t rj t 0 j 1 n theorem 3 the solution to the optimal control problem in 16 yields u max 0 1 c 2 ln 1 c 2 n j 1 sjij j sj ej 18 proof the optimal solution u must satisfy h u c 2 ec 2 u n j 1 sjij j sj ej 0 14 thus isolating u we obtain c 2 e c 2 u n j 1 sjij j sj ej ec 2 u n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 c 2 u ln n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 u 1 c 2 ln n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 if u 0 we necessarily have 0 since u 0 consequently the optimal control can be expressed as u 1 c 2 ln n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 19 but if u 0 then u 1 c 2 ln n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 0 ln n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 0 which considering the properties of the logarithm function yields n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 1 n j 1 sjij j sj ej c 2 c 2 n j 1 sjij j sj ej 0 the inequality above holds true because by definition u 0 and 0 the case where 0 was already explored in eq 19 hence the expression below summarises the optimal control results u max 0 1 c 2 ln 1 c 2 n j 1 sjij j sj ej 15 5 numerical experiments in order to better understand the long term behaviour of the system 1 5 we performed a simple experiment with a single virus strain which we will call experiment 1 the parameters for this experiment are based on tarrataca et al 2021 and appear in table 2 below note that experiment 1 does not consider any lock down effect which means that u t 0 t 0 table 2 parameters for experiment 1 parameter value 1 2 41 10 9 1 1 7 days 1 1 1 21 days 1 1 1 90 days 1 1 1 152 10 5 days 1 u t 1 0 initial conditions s 0 217 106 e 0 252 i 0 2 r 0 1 figure 2 depicts the results for experiment 1 and provides some insight into the long term behaviour of the system with constant reinfection for ease of interpretation the population levels are shown as a proportion of the initial population p 0 in this and all the remaining figures notice that the shares of susceptible exposed infected and removed currently immune individuals reach a sort of long term equilibrium for the specific parameters the per centage of susceptible individuals stabilises just short of 10 whereas around 5 of the individuals will be exposed i e in the latency period in the equilibrium furthermore the level of infection in equilibrium is around 15 whereas around 60 of the population will be intermittently immune to the virus in the long term notice also that the number of deaths continues to increase over time we speculate that the level upon which the removed population stabilises in 16 figure 2 dynamic behaviour of a single strain experiment 1 figure 2 provides some insight into the required levels of herd immunity for a given virus strain in addition the percentage of the population that is infected in the long term in the example around 15 of the population at any given time provides an insight into the burden of the epidemic on the health system this level coupled with the estimated number of cumulative deaths may be used to inform healthcare policies in the long term whereas the percentage of cumulative deaths is not to be viewed as an attempt to estimate such a level given the uncertainty in the parameters and their variation around the world it is provided here to offer some insights into the cumulative effect of the epidemic in the overall health of the population figure 3 illustrates the results for two viral strains experiment 2 with the second appearing 180 days after the first by second strain here we mean the first virus mutation that is sufficiently distinct as to not be affected by antibod ies from previous strain in this experiment we assume that the parameters of the second strain are similar to those of the first considering that the two strains are similar the result in figure 3 is quite intuitive we observe that the second strain is simply a delayed version of the first outbreak which makes sense given the similar parameters the important feature here is that the second strain will add to the burden on the healthcare 17 figure 3 dynamic behaviour of two strains experiment 2 system thereby increasing the levels of contamination and eventually doubling the burden notice however that at the peak of the second strain most of the infections will be from this strain before the system eventually stabilises observe also the significant reduction of the population which evinces a sig nificant increase in deaths with respect to the single strain results we argue that this should be considered to inform the decision makers indeed strate gies to prevent different strains from entering a given territory by enforcing testing upon arrival can be an important part of mitigation policies inspired by the second strain reported in britain which is believe to be up to 70 more transmissible than the first strain the third experiment experiment 3 replicates experiment 2 but considering a more transmissible second strain with 2 1 7 1 figure 4 depicts the results one can notice that as the second strain peaks most of the new infections will be caused by this strain as expected one can also notice higher levels of mortality for the second strain and a higher level of overall transmission of this strain as the system stabilises 18 figure 4 dynamic behaviour of two strains with second strain 70 more transmis sible experiment 3 5 1 optimal mitigation strategies this section provides insights into the effect of the optimal control policy derived in theorem 3 into the dynamics of the system over a two year horizon to simplify the results and facilitate the interpretation we introduce a series of experiments with a single viral strain this relies on the results of section 3 1 and eq 8 which show that a control able to stabilise the most transmissible strain will also stabilise the remaining strains hence an optimal policy derived for the single most transmissible strain can also be relied upon to stabilise the remaining strains we consider six sets of cost parameters c 1 and c 2 for the functional in eq 14 in the current experiment which is labeled experiment 4 the parameters are described below case a b c d e f c 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 c 2 ln p 0 0 9 ln p 0 0 8 ln p 0 0 7 ln p 0 0 6 ln p 0 0 5 ln p 0 cases a to f emulate a sequence of decreasing costs of mitigation measures to 19 provide an insight into the change in the optimal control as a function of such decrease in figure 5 which depicts the results for case a one can notice that the optimal control stabilises around mitigating measures with a reduction of 50 in transmission after approximately four months the measures are slowly relaxed to yield a 37 5 mitigation that produces a surge in infections to respond to this surge the mitigation is then restored to about 40 and this level is decreased very slowly in the remaining horizon as the system stabilises figure 5 optimal control policy for case a case b introduces a small decrease in the cost of mitigation measures and one can see in figure 6 that this results in an increase in the mitigation measures it is also noteworthy that the overall behaviour of the mitigation measures u t follows the same pattern as in the previous experiment we also observe the same trends and overall behaviour of the mitigation mea sures in cases c and d see figures 7 8 however as c 2 is decreased we observe higher levels of mitigation measures over time in addition we can also observe that the relaxation of the mitigation measures is delayed with the increase of c 2 when the cost of mitigation is sufficiently decreased we observe that the mitigation measures tend to stabilise at a given level over the entire planning 20 figure 6 optimal control policy for case b figure 7 optimal control policy for case c horizon this happens in cases e and f depicted in figures 9 and 10 below the difference in these cases is that the mitigation levels stabilise around 80 for case e while reaching around 88 in case f to sum up the results illustrate the sensitivity of the model with respect to the perceived costs of mitigation measures it is clear that different parameters may lead to highly distinct levels of infection and consequently overall deaths furthermore in line with the results in perkins and espan a 2020 we observe that large levels of control are needed from the outset to contain the infection 21 figure 8 optimal control policy for case d figure 9 optimal control policy for case e levels and therefore preserve a wide range of feasible control measures as time elapses on the other hand if control measures are delayed the burden on the healthcare system grows so rapidly that the decision makers may be left with no option but a full lock down to curb the infection levels tarrataca et al 2021 22 figure 10 optimal control policy for case f 6 concluding remarks this paper proposed a novel modelling framework based on the classical seir model that considers multiple viral strains reinfections and optimal control we validated the framework in the light of the covid 19 epidemic the results are interpretable robust and highlight a very intuitive result namely that it is possible to contain the epidemic by focusing on the most transmissible strain the results show that in the absence of mitigating measures an epidemic with a single viral strain and reinfection will reach an equilibrium after the peak of infections whilst real world data suggest that the peak is not manageable by any healthcare system in the world it is evident that even the equilibrium may imply levels of infection that will challenge healthcare resources in many regions of the world the results also suggest that with insufficient mitigation measures an epi demic with a second wave includes a second peak of infections that is higher than the first if the second strain is as transmissible as the first this is because the second peak combines infections from both strains moreover the num ber of deaths increases considerably in the presence of the second strain in 23 view of the second covid 19 strain in the uk we also simulated a scenario where the second strain is 70 more transmissible than the first this causes a larger and sharper peak in the second wave in which the majority of cases will belong to the second strain not just because it is more transmissible but also because it peaks when the first strain had already stabilised the results are consistent with the reports of the second strain in the uk and in the state of amazonas brazil where the second wave caused an explosive increase in new cases as well as a complete depletion of healthcare resources finally we propose and solve an optimal control problem to derive optimal mitigation measures whilst considering that the cost of mitigation measures grows exponentially as a function of the mitigation effort because controlling the single most transmissible strain suffices we derived optimal control strate gies for a single strain to facilitate the interpretation of the results consis tently with previous literature our findings suggest that an early relaxation of lockdown measures causes a sharp increase in the number of new cases which in turn will lead to the need for more restrictive measures as expected the optimal levels of isolation are very sensitive to the mitigation costs with lower costs resulting in higher levels of restrictive measures furthermore only persistently high levels of mitigation measures are capable of containing the epidemic in the long term which suggests that an efficient deployment of mass vaccination is the single most effective way out of the current epidemic acknowledgements this study was partly supported by the brazilian research council cnpq under grant 311075 2018 5 and by coordenac a o de aperfeic
