federation university mt helen victoria 3353 australia abstract a unified model is addressed for general optimization problems in multi scale com plex systems based on necessary conditions and basic principles in physics the canonical duality triality theory is presented in a precise way to include traditional duality theo ries and popular methods as special applications two conjectures on np hardness are discussed which should play important roles for correctly understanding and efficiently solving challenging real world problems applications are illustrated for both nonconvex continuous optimization and mixed integer nonlinear programming misunderstandings and confusion on some basic concepts such as objectivity nonlinearity lagrangian and lagrange multiplier method are discussed and classified breakthrough from recent false challenges by c za linescu and his co workers are addressed this paper will bridge a significant gap between optimization and multi disciplinary fields of applied math and computational sciences keywords multi scale modeling properly posed problem nonlinearity objectivity canonical duality triality gap function global optimization np hardness 1 introduction and motivation general problems in mathematical optimization are usually formulated in the following form min f x s t g x 0 1 where the unknown x rn is a vector f x rn r is the so called objective function 1 and g x gj x rn rm is a vector valued constraint function it must be emphasized that different from the basic concept of objectivity in continuum physics and nonlinear analysis the objective function used extensively in optimization literature is allowed to be any arbitrarily given function even the linear function therefore this mathematical problem is artificial although it enables one to model a very wide range of problems it comes at a price many global optimization problems are considered to be np hard without detailed information on these arbitrarily given functions it is impossible to have a powerful theory for solving the general nonconvex problem 1 canonical duality triality is a newly developed and continuously improved methodologi cal theory this theory comprises mainly 1 a canonical transformation which is a versatile methodology that can be used to model complex systems within a unified framework 2 a complementary dual principle which can be used to formulate a perfect dual problem with a unified analytic solution and 3 a triality theory which can identify both global and local ex trema and to develop effective canonical dual algorithms for solving real world problems in both 1 this terminology is used mainly in english literature the function f x is called the target function in chinese and japanese literature 1 http arxiv org abs 1605 05534 v 3 continuous and discrete systems this theory was developed from gao and strang s original work on nonconvex variational boundary value problems in large deformation mechanics 2 it was shown in gao s book 1 and in the recent articles 5 42 that both the external penalty and lagrange multiplier methods are special applications of the canonical duality theory in convex optimization it is now understood that this theory reveals an intrinsic multi scale du ality pattern in complex systems many popular theories and powerful methods in nonconvex analysis global optimization and computational science can be unified within the framework of the canonical duality triality theory indeed it is easy to show that the popular semi definite programming sdp methods in global optimization and the half quadratic regularization in image processing are naturally covered by the canonical duality theory 41 53 71 mathematics and mechanics have been complementary partners since the newton times many fundamental ideas concepts and mathematical methods extensively used in calculus of variations and optimization are originally developed from mechanics it is known that the classical lagrangian duality theory and the associated lagrange multiplier method were de veloped by lagrange in analytical mechanics 50 the modern concepts of super potential and sub differential in convex analysis were proposed by j j moreau from frictional mechanics 57 however as v i arnold indicated 17 in the middle of the twentieth century it was at tempted to divide physics and mathematics the consequences turned out to be catastrophic indeed the canonical duality theory was developed from some fundamental concepts of objectivity and work conjugate principle in continuum physics due to the existing gap between nonlinear analysis mechanics and optimization this theory has been mistakenly challenged by m voisei c za linescu and his former student in a set of more than 12 papers although knowledgeable scholars can easily understand the conceptual mistakes in these challenges the large number of so called counterexamples and false conclusions generated negative impacts to the communities therefore it is necessary to have a formal response to the recent paper by za linescu 69 instead of directly responding all these challenges one by one this paper presents the canonical duality theory in a systematical way from a unified modeling basic assumptions to the theory method and applications the methodology conjectures and responses are important for understanding not only this unconventional theory but also many challenging problems in complex systems a hope to bridge the existing gap between the mathematical optimization and the interdisciplinary fields of mathematical physics is author s main goal of this paper 2 multi scale modeling and properly posed problems the canonical duality theory was developed from gao and strang s work on minimum potential energy principle for solving the following variational problem in large deformation theory 2 p 0 min u w du f u u uc 2 where the unknown u x is a function in a differentiable manifold u over a field f ua u r is an external energy d ua w is a linear differential operator which assigns each configuration u to an internal variable w du in different scale the real valued function w wa w r is the so called internal or stored energy in ua the geometrical constraints such as boundary and initial conditions are pre described for each given problem while wa 2 contains certain physical constitutive constraints of the system the feasible set uc u ua du wa is known as the kinetically admissible space in nonlinear field theory 2 1 objectivity subjectivity and well posed problem objectivity is a basic concept in mathematical modeling and nonlinear analysis 1 20 21 55 let r be a special orthogonal group i e r r if and only if rt r 1 and detr 1 a mathematical definition was given in gao s book definition 6 1 2 1 definition 1 objectivity a set wa is said to be objective if rw wa w wa r r a real valued function w wa r is said to be objective if w rw w w w wa r r 3 lemma 1 a real valued function w w is objective if and only if there exists a real valued function e such that w w wtw geometrically speaking an objective function is rotational symmetry which should be a so n invariant in n dimensional euclidean space physically an objective function doesn t depend on observers because of noether s theorem 2 rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law see section 6 1 2 1 therefore the objectivity is essential for any real world mathematical models it was emphasized by p ciarlet that the objectivity is not an assumption but an axiom 20 indeed the objectivity is also known as the axiom of frame invariance 18 in gao and strang s work the internal energy w w must be an objective function such that its variation ga teaux derivative w w is the so called constitutive duality law which depends only on the intrinsic property of the system dually the external energy f u can be called the subjective function 32 which depends on each problem such that its variation is governed by the action reaction duality law u f u u a system is conservative if the action is independent of the reaction therefore the subjective function must be linear on its domain ua and by riesz representation theorem we should have f u u u where the bilinear form u u u u r puts u and u in duality together u w du f u is called the total potential and the minimum potential energy principle leads to the general variational problem 2 from the point view of linguistics if we consider f u as a subject w w as an object and the operation as a predicate then u forms a grammatically correct sentence 3 the criticality condition u 0 leads to the equilibrium equation a u d w du u 4 where d w a u is an adjoint operator of d and a uc u is called equilibrium operator the triality structure se u u a forms an elementary system in gao s book chapter 4 3 1 this abstract form covers most well known equilibrium problems in real world applications ranging from mathematical physics in continuous analysis to mathematical programming in discrete systems see the celebrate text by gil strang 66 particularly if 2 i e every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law 3 by the facts that object subject is a duality pair in a noun or pronoun space which is dual to a verb space the multi level duality pattern object subject predicate is called triality which is essential for languages and sciences 3 w w is quadratic such that 2 w w h then the operator a xc x is linear and can be written in the triality form a d hd which appears extensively in mathematical physics optimization and linear systems 1 66 clearly any convex quadratic function w du is objective due to the cholesky decomposition a 0 in operations research the decision variable is usually a vector u rn if it represents the products of a manufacture company its dual variable u rn can be considered as market price or demands so the external energy f u u u ut u in this system is the total income of the company the products are produced by workers w d rm and d rm n is a matrix due to the cooperation workers are paid by salary w w therefore the internal energy w w in this example is the cost which could be an objective function not necessary since the company is a man made system thus u w du f u is the total cost or target and the minimization problem min leads to the equilibrium equation dt w du u which is an algebraic equation in rn according to the action reaction duality in physics if there is no action or demand i e u 0 the system has non reaction i e u 0 dually for any given non trivial input a real world problem should have at least one non trivial solution definition 2 properly and well posed problems a problem is called properly posed if for any given non trivial input it has at least one non trivial solution it is called well posed if the solution is unique clearly this definition is more general than hadamard s well posed problems in dynamical systems since the continuity condition is not required physically speaking any real world problems should be well posed since all natural phenomena exist uniquely but practically it is difficult to model a real world problem precisely therefore properly posed problems are allowed for the canonical duality theory this definition is important for understanding the triality theory and np hard problems 2 2 nonconvex analysis and boundary value problems for static systems the unknown of a mixed boundary value problem is a vector valued function u x ua u c rm u x u x u rd d 3 m 1 u t and the input is u f x x t x x t 2 in this case the external energy is f u u u u f d t u t d in nonlinear analysis d is a gradient like partial differential operator and w du wa lp rm d is a two point tensor field 1 over the internal energy w w is defined by w w u x w d 5 where u x w wa r is the stored energy density the system is space homogeneous if u u w thus w w is objective if and only if u x w is objective on an objective set wa by the facts that w du is a two point tensor which is not considered as a strain measure but the right cauchy green tensor c wtw is an objective strain tensor there must exists a function c such that w w c in nonlinear elasticity the function c is usually convex and the duality c c is invertible i e hill s work conjugate 4 principle 1 these basic truths in continuum physics laid a foundation for the canonical duality theory by finite element method the domain is divided into m elements e such that the unknown function is piecewisely discretized by u x ne x e x e thus the nonconvex variational problem 2 can be numerically reformulated in a global optimization problem min w d f xc 6 where e is the discretized unknown u x d is a generalized high order matrix depending on the interpolation ne x and xc is a convex constraint set including the boundary conditions the canonical dual finite element method was first proposed in 1996 22 powerful applications have been given recently in engineering and sciences 47 62 2 3 lagrangian mechanics and initial value problems in lagrange mechanics 50 51 the unknown u t ua c 1 rn is a vector field over a time domain r its components ui t i 1 n are known as the lagrangian coordinates its dual variable u is the action vector function in rn denoted by f t the external energy f u u u u t f t dt while the internal energy w du is the so called action w du l t u u dt l t u u t u 7 where du 1 t u u u is a vector valued mapping t is the kinetic energy density u is the potential density and l t u is the lagrangian density together u w du f u is called the total action this standard form holds from the classical newton mechanics to quantum field theory 4 its stationary condition leads to the well known euler lagrange equation a u d w du 1 t l u u t u t u uu t u f 8 the system is called time homogeneous if l l u u in general the kinetic energy t must be an objective function of the velocity 5 vk x k u of each particle xk xk u r 3 k 1 k while the potential density u depends on each problem for newtonian mechanics we have u t x t and t v 1 2 m v 2 is quadratic if u 0 the equilibrium equation a u mx t f includes the newton second law f mx and the third law f f the first law v x v 0 holds only if f 0 in this case the system has either a trivial solution x 0 or infinitely many solutions x t v 0 t x 0 depending on the initial conditions in ua this simple fact in elementary physics plays a key role in understanding the canonical duality theory and np hard problems in global optimization by using the methods of finite difference and least squares 41 52 the general nonlinear dynamical system 8 can also be formulated as the same global optimization problem 6 where ui tk is the lagrangian coordinates ui i 1 n at each discretized time tk k 1 m d is a finite difference matrix and xc is a convex constraint set including the initial condition 52 by the canonical duality theory an intrinsic relation between chaos in nonlinear dynamics and np hardness in global optimization was revealed recently in 52 4 see wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki lagrangian mechanics 5 the objectivity of t v is also called the isotropy in lagrange mechanics since v is a vector see 51 5 https en wikipedia org wiki lagrangian mechanics 2 4 mono bi dualities and duality gap lagrangian duality was developed from lagrange mechanics since 1788 50 where the kinetic energy t v k 1 2 mk vk 2 is a quadratic objective function for convex static systems or dynamical systems but u u 0 the stored energy w wa r is convex and its legendre conjugate w w w w w w is uniquely defined on w a thus by w du du w the total potential u can be written in the lagrangian form 6 l ua w a r l u du w u f u d f w 9 where u ua can be viewed as a lagrange multiplier for the equilibrium equation d f u a in linear elasticity l u is the well known hellinger reissner complementary energy 1 let sc w a d f be the so called statically admissible space then the lagrangian dual of the general problem p 0 is given by 1 p 0 max w sc 10 and the saddle lagrangian leads to a well known min max duality in convex static systems min u uc u min u ua max w a l u max w a min u ua l u max sc 11 this one to one duality is the so called themono duality in chapter 1 1 or the complementary dual variational principle in continuum physics in finite elasticity the lagrangian dual is also known as the levison zubov principle however this principle holds only for convex problems for convex hamiltonian systems the action w du in 7 is a d c difference of convex functional and the lagrangian has its standard form in lagrangian mechanics see chapter 2 5 2 1 with u q t and p l q p q p t p u q dt q f 12 where q ua c 1 rn is the lagrange coordinate and p sa c rn is the momen tum in this case the lagrangian is a bi concave functional on ua sa but the hamiltonian h q p dq p l q p is convex 7 the total action and its canonical dual are 1 q max l q p p v a t q u q dt q f q uc 13 d p max l q p q ua u p t p dt p sc 14 although both of them are d c functionals the duality between the kinetic energy t q and the potential u q leads to a so called bi duality first presented in author s book chapter 2 1 min q min d p max q max d p 15 the mathematical proofs of this theory were given in chapter 2 6 1 for convex hamiltonian systems and in corollary 5 3 6 1 for nonconvex programming problems this bi duality 6 in physics literature the same notation l is used for both action l u u and the lagrangian l u p since both represent the same physical quantity 7 this is the reason that instead of the lagrangian the hamiltonian is extensively used in dynamics 6 revealed not only an interesting dynamical extremum principle in periodic motion but also an important truth in convex hamiltonian systems see page 77 1 the least action principle is incorrect for any periodic motion it holds only for linear potential u q 8 in real world problems the stored energy w w is usually nonconvex in order to model complex phenomena its complementary energy can t be determined uniquely by the legendre transformation although its fenchel conjugatew w a r can be uniquely defined the fenchel moreau dual problem p 0 max w sc 16 is not considered as a complementary dual problem due to fenchel young inequality min u u uc max sc 17 and min u max 6 0 is the well known duality gap this duality gap is intrin sic to all lagrange fenchel moreau types duality problems since the linear operator d can t change the nonconvexity of w du it turns out that the existence of a pure stress based complementary dual principle has been a well known debate in nonlinear elasticity for more than fifty years 54 remark 1 lagrange multiplier law strictly speaking the lagrange multiplier method can be used mainly for equilibrium constraint in sc and the lagrange multiplier must be the solution to the primal problem see section 1 5 2 1 the equilibrium equation d f must be an invariant under certain coordinates transformation say the law of angular mo mentum conservation which is guaranteed by the objectivity of the stored energy w du in continuum mechanics see definition 6 1 2 1 or by the isotropy of the kinetic energy t u in lagrangian mechanics 51 specifically the equilibrium equation for newtonian mechanics is an invariant under the calilean transformation while for einstein s special relativity the ory the equilibrium equation d f is an invariant under the lorentz transformation for linear equilibrium equation the quadratic w w is naturally an objective function for convex systems unfortunately since the concept of the objectivity is misused in mathematical opti mization and the notation of the euclidian coordinate x xi is used as the unknown the lagrange multiplier method and augmented methods have been mistakenly used for solving general nonconvex optimization problems which produces many artificial duality gaps 5 3 unified problem and canonical duality triality theory in this section we simply restrict our discussion in finite dimensional space x its element x could be a vector a matrix or a tensor 9 in this case the linear operator d is a 8 this truth is not known to many people in physics only in a footnote of the celebrated book section 1 2 51 landau and lifshitz pointed out that the least action principle holds only for a sufficient small of time interval not for the whole trajectory of the system 9 tensor is a geometrical object in mathematics and physics which is defined as a multi dimensional array satisfying a transformation law see https en wikipedia org wiki tensor a tensor must be independent of a particular choice of coordinate system frame invariance but this terminology has been also misused recent years in optimization literature such that any multi dimensional array of data is called tensor 7 https en wikipedia org wiki tensor generalized matrix 10 d x w and w is a generalized matrix space equipped with a natural norm w let xa x be a convex subset and x a be its dual set such that for any given input f x a the subjective function f 0 xa then the multi scale optimization problem 6 can be re proposed as p min w d f xc 18 where xc xa d wa although the objectivity is necessary for real world modeling the numerical discretization ofw du could lead to a complicated functionw d which may not be objective in w d also in operations research many challenging problems are artificially proposed thus the objectivity required in gao and strang s work on nonlinear elasticity has been relaxed by the canonical duality since 2000 26 3 1 canonical transformation and gap function in the canonical duality theory a real valued function ea e r is said to be canonical if the duality relation ea e a e is bijective the canonical duality is a funda mental principle in sciences and oriental philosophy which underlies all natural phenomena therefore instead of the objectivity in continuum physics a generalized objective function w w is used in the canonical duality theory under the following assumption assumption 1 for a given w wa r there exists a canonical measure wa ea and a canonical function ea r such that the following conditions hold a 1 1 positivity w w 0 w wa a 1 2 canonicality w w w w wa and either a 1 3 coercivity limw w as w or a 1 3 boundness wa is bounded generally speaking the conditions a 1 1 and a 1 2 are necessary for any real world problems while a 1 3 and a 1 3 depend mainly on the magnitude of the input f x a usually the coercivity is for small f within the system s capacity such as elasticity and the boundness is for big f beyond the system s capacity such as plasticity 24 let d xa ea be the so called geometrically admissible operator the canonicality w d is also called the canonical transformation in the canonical duality theory let e e r be the bilinear form which puts e and e in duality by a 1 2 we have xc xa ea and the problem p can be equivalently reformulated in the following canonical form p min f xc 19 by the facts that the canonical duality is a universal principle in nature and the canonical measure is not necessarily to be objective the canonical transformation holds for general problems and the problem p can be used to model general complex systems the criticality condition of p is governed by the fundamental principle of virtual work t t f xc 20 10 a generalized matrixd d i j is a multi dimensional array but not necessary to satisfy a transformation law so it is not a tensor in order to avoid confusion it can be called a tentrix 8 where t represents a generalized ga teaux or directional derivative of its adjoint t is called the balance operator c and c ea e a is a canonical dual or constitutive operator the strong form of this virtual work principle is called the canonical equilibrium equation a t c f 21 a system governed by this equation is called a canonical system and is denoted as see chapter 4 1 sa x x e e c definition 3 classification of nonlinearities the system sa is called geometrically non linear resp linear if the geometrical operator xa ea is nonlinear resp linear the system is called physically or constitutively nonlinear resp linear if the canonical dual operator c ea e a is nonlinear resp linear the systems is called fully nonlinear resp linear if it is both geometrically and physically nonlinear resp linear both geometrical and physics nonlinearities are basic concepts in nonlinear field theory the mathematical definition was first given by the author in 2000 under the canonical transforma tion 26 a diagrammatic representation of this canonical system is shown in figure 1 a c t c t c ea xa e a x a figure 1 diagrammatic representation for a canonical system this diagram shows a symmetry broken in the canonical equilibrium equation i e instead of the balance operator t is adjoined with t it was discovered by gao and strang 2 that by introducing a complementary operator c t this locally broken symmetry is recovered by a so called complementary gap function gap c 22 which plays a key role in global optimization and the triality theory clearly if d is linear then gap 0 thus the following statement is important to understand complexity only the geometrical nonlinearity leads to nonconvexity in optimization bifurcation in anal ysis chaos in dynamics and np hard problems in complex systems 3 2 complementary dual principle and analytical solution for a given canonical function ea r its conjugate e a r can be uniquely defined by the legendre transforation 9 sta ea 23 where sta f x stands for finding the stationary value of f on x and the following canonical duality relations hold on ea e a 24 if the canonical function is convex and lower semi continuous the ga teaux derivative should be replaced by the sub differential and is replaced by the fenchel conjugate sup ea in this case 24 is replaced by the generalized canonical duality ea e a 25 if the convex set ea contains inequality constrains then 25 includes all the internal kkt conditions 5 24 in this sense a kkt point of the canonical form is a generalized critical point of by the complementarity the canonical form of can be equivalently written in gao and strang s total complementary function xa e a r 2 f 26 then the canonical dual function d sc r can be obtained by the canonical dual trans formation d sta xa g ap 27 where g ap sta f xa which is defined on the canonical dual feasible space sc e a t f xa clearly sc 6 if p is properly posed theorem 1 complementary dual principle 1 the pair is a critical point of if and only if is a critical point of and is a critical point of d moreover d 28 proof the criticality condition 0 leads to the following canonical equations t f 29 the theorem is proved by the canonical duality 24 and the definition of d theorem 1 shows a one to one correspondence of the critical points between the primal function and its canonical dual in large deformation theory this theorem solved the fifty year old open problem on complementary variational principle and is known as the gao principle in literature 54 in real world applications the geometrical operator is usually quadratic homogeneous i e 2 r in this case we have 2 t 2 c and gap f 1 2 g f 30 where g 2 gap then the canonical dual function d can written explicitly as d g f xa 1 2 g f f 31 where g represents a generalized inverse of g 10 theorem 2 analytical solution form 1 if sc is a critical point of d then g f 32 is a critical point of and d dually if xc is a critical point of it must be in the form of 32 for a critical point sc of d this unified analytical solution form holds not only for general global optimization problems in finite dimensional systems but also for a large class of nonlinear boundary initial value problems in nonconvex analysis and dynamic systems 40 3 3 triality theory and np hard criterion definition 4 degenerate and non degenerate critical points morse function let xc be a critical point of a real valued function xc r is called degenerate res non degenerate if the hessian matrix of is singular resp non singular at the function xc r is called a morse function if it has no degenerate critical points theorem 3 triality theory 26 suppose that ea r is convex is a non degenerate critical point of and xo so is a neighborhood 11 of if s c sc g 0 then min xc max s c d d 33 if s c sc g 0 then we have either max xo max so d d 34 or if dim dim d min xo min so d d 35 the statement 33 is the so called canonical min max duality which can be proved easily by gao and strang s work in 1989 2 clearly s c if and only if gap 0 x this duality theory shows that the gao strang gap function provides a global optimum criterion the statements 34 and 35 are called the canonical double max and double min dualities respectively which can be used to find local extremum solutions the triality theory shows that the nonconvex minimization problem p is canonically dual to the following maximum stationary problem pd max sta d s c 36 11 the neighborhood xo of means that on which is the only critical point see page 140 1 11 theorem 4 existence and uniqueness criteria 31 for a properly posed p if the canonical function ea r is convex ints c 6 and lim 0 d 0 o s c s c 37 then pd has at least one solution s c and g f is a solution to p the solution is unique if h g 0 proof under the required conditions d s c r is convex and coercive and ints c 6 therefore pd has at least one solution if h 0 then d s c r is strictly concave and pd has a unique solution this theorem shows that if ints c 6 the nonconvex problem p is canonically dual to pd which can be solved easily otherwise the problem p is canonically dual to the following minimal stationary problem i e to find a global minimum stationary value of d on sc ps min sta d sc 38 which could be really np hard since d is nonconvex on the nonconvex set sc therefore a conjecture was proposed in 30 conjecture 1 criterion of np hardness a properly posed problem p is np hard if and only if int s c the triality theory was discovered by the author during his research on post buckling of a large deformed elastic beam in 1996 23 where the primal variable u x is a displacement vector in r 2 and x is a canonical dual stress also in r 2 therefore the triality theory was correctly proposed in nonconvex analysis which provides for the first time a complete set of solutions to the post buckling problem physically the global minimizer u x represents a stable buckled beam configuration happened naturally the local minimizer is an unstable buckled state happened occationally while the local maximizer is the unbuckled beam state mathematical proof of the triality theory was given in 1 for one d nonconvex variational problems theorem 2 6 2 and for finite dimensional optimization problems theorem 5 3 6 and corollary 5 3 1 in 2002 the author discovered some countexamples to the canonical double min duality when dim 6 dim d and this statement was removed from the triality theory see remark 1 in 27 and remark for theorem 3 in 28 recently the author and his co workers proved that the canonical double min duality holds weakly when dim 6 dim d 4 19 59 it was also discovered by using the canonical dual finite element method that the local minimum solutions in nonconvex mechanics are very sensitive not only to the input and boundary conditions of a given system but also to such artificial conditions as the numerical discretization and computational precision etc the triality theory provides a precise mathematical tool for studying and understanding complicated natural phenomena the canonical duality triality theory has been successfully used for solving a wide class problems in both global optimization and nonconvex analysis 41 including certain challenging problems in nonlinear pdes and large deformation mechanics 33 4 applications in complex systems applications to nonconvex constrained global optimization have been discussed in 5 42 this section presents applications to two general global optimization problems 12 4 1 unconstrained nonconvex optimization problem p min m s 1 s s f xc 39 where the canonical measures s s could be either a scalar or a generalized matrix k k are any given canonical functions such as polynomial exponential logarithm and their compositions etc for example if xc rn and w d i i 1 2 i tqi j j 1 2 j 1 2 tqj j 2 k k k exp 1 2 tqk l 1 2 tq log 1 2 tq 40 where qs are positive definite matrices to allow the cholesky decomposition qs dts ds for all s i j k l and s s are physical constants which could be either positive or negative under assumption 1 this general function includes naturally the so called d c functions i e difference of convex functions by using the canonical measure s 1 2 i tqi 1 2 tqr ea rp rq p dim i q dim j dimk diml where r q x rq xi 0 i 1 q w w can be written in the canonical form i i i j j 1 2 j

given physical constants and the input f such that s c 6 the canonical dual problem pd has at least one solution s c rq and g f xc rn is a global minimum solution to p if n q the problem pd can be much easier than p 13 4 2 mixed integer nonlinear programming minlp the decision variable for minlp is y z ya za where ya is a continuous variable set and za is a set of integers it was shown in 60 that for any given integer set za there exists a linear transformation dz za z 1 n thus based on the unified model 18 a general minlp problem can be proposed as pmi min y z w dyy dzz y s z t y z yc zc 42 where f s t is a given input d dyy dzz wy z is a multi scale operator and yc y ya dyy wy zc z za dzz z in ya certain linear constraints are given since the set z is bounded by assumption 1 either w wy r is coercive or wy is bounded this general problem pmi covers many real world applications including the so called fixed cost problem 43 it must be emphasized that the integer constraint wz dzz z is a constitutive condition governed by the physical property of the system it must be relaxed by the canonicality let z z dzz dzz ez rn 43 where x y xiyi n is the hadamard product in rn thus the integer constraint in z can be relaxed naturally by the canonical function 0 if e otherwise where e 1 n 30 therefore the canonical form of pmi is min y z y z z z y s z t y yc 44 since the canonical function is convex semi continuous its fenchel conjugate is sup rn e if 0 otherwise the generalized canonical duality relations 25 are 0 e e 0 45 the complementarity shows that the canonical integer constraint e can be naturally relaxed by the 0 in continuous space thus if is a quadratic homogenous operator and the canonical function is convex on ea the canonical dual to pmi is pdmi max d 1 2 g f f e s c 46 where g depends on the quadratic operators and z z s c is a convex open set s c e a rn g 0 0 47 the canonical duality triality theory has be used successfully for solving mixed integer programming problems 39 43 particularly for the quadratic integer programming problem pqi min x 1 2 xtqx xt f x 1 1 n 48 14 we have s c rn g q 2 diag 0 0 and pdqi max d 1 2 ft g f et s c 49 which can be solved easily if ints c 6 otherwise pqi could be np hard since s c is an open set which is a conjecture proposed in 30 in this case pqi is canonically dual to an unconstrained nonsmooth nonconvex minimization problem 31 4 3 relation with sdp programming now let us show the relation between the canonical duality theory and the popular semi definite programming relaxation theorem 5 suppose that es r is convex and e a is a solution of the problem psd min g s t g f ft 2 g 0 e a g r 50 then g f is a global minimum solution to the nonconvex problem p proof the problem pd can be equivalently written in the following problem see 71 min g g g ap g 0 e a 51 then by using the schur complement lemma 70 this problem is equivalent to psd the theorem is proved by the triality theory it was proved 39 that for the same problem pqi if we use different geometrical operator x xxt ea rn n t 0 rank 1 ii 1 i 1 n and the associated canonical function 1 2 q 0 if ea otherwise where tr t we should obtain the same canonical dual problem pdqi particularly if f 0 then pqi is a typical linear semi definite programming min 1 2 q s t ea since ea is not bounded and there is no input this problem is not properly posed which could have either no solution or multiple solutions for a given indefinite q qt 4 4 relation to reformulation linearization convexification technique the reformulation linearization convexification technique rlt proposed by h sherali and c h tuncbilek 64 is one well known novel approach for efficiently solving general polynomial programming problems the key idea of this technique is also to introduce a geometrically nonlinear operator x such that the higher order polynomial objectw x can be reduced to a lower order polynomial particularly for the quadratic minimization problems with linear inequality constraints in xa pq min x 1 2 xtqx xt f x xa 52 15 by choosing the quadratic transformation x x x ea rn n i e ij xixj 1 i j n 53 where represents the kronecker product avoiding symmetric terms i e ij ji the quadratic object w w can be reformulated as the following first level rlt linear relaxation w x 1 2 xtqx 1 2 n k 1 qkk kk n 1 k 1 n l k 1 qkl kl 54 the linear can be considered as a special canonical function since is a constant and 0 is uniquely defined thus using to replace w x and considering as an independent variable the problem pq can be relaxed by the following rlt linear program prlt min x f x xa ea 55 based on this rlt linear program a branch and bound algorithm was designed 65 it is proved that if x solves prlt then its objective value yields a lower bound of pq and x provides an upper bound for pq moreover if x x x then x solves pq this technique has been significantly adapted along with supporting approximation proce dures to solve a variety of more general nonconvex constrained optimization problems having polynomial or more general factorable objective and constraint functions 63 by the fact that for any symmetric q there exists d rn m such that q dthd with h hkk 1 hkl 0 k 6 l rm m the canonicality condition 54 can be simplified as w dx 1 2 dx th dx 1 2 m k 1 hkk kk x dx dx rm m 56 clearly if the scale m n the problem prlt will be much easier than the problems using the geometrically nonlinear operator x x moreover if we using the lagrange multiplier e a rm m x 0 x rn to relax the ignored geometrical condition x in prlt the problem pq can be equivalently relaxed as p min x max x x x f x xa ea e a 57 thus if x is a solution to p then x should be a solution to pq by using the sequential canonical quadratic transformation x p 1 x see chapter 4 1 this technique can be used for solving general global optimization problems 5 symmetry np hardness and perturbation methods the concept of symmetry is closely related to the duality and in certain sense can be viewed as a geometric duality mathematically symmetry means invariance under transformation by the canonicality the object w w possesses naturally certain symmetry if the subject f 0 then w d and p should have either a trivial solution or 16 multiple solutions due to the symmetry in this case d is concave and by the triality theory its critical point s c is a global maximizer g f 0 is the biggest local maximizer of while the global minimizers must be for those s c such that d min detg 0 sc clearly this nonconvex constrained concave minimization problem could be really np hard therefore many well known np hard problems in computer science and global optimization are not well posed problems such as the max cut problem which is a special case of quadratic integer programming problem pqi due to the symmetry q qt and f 0 its canonical dual problem has multiple solutions on the boundary of s c the problem is considered as np complete even if qij 1 for all edges strictly speaking this is not a real world problem but only a geometrical model without sufficient geometrical constraints in xa the graph is not physically fixed and any rigid motion is possible however by adding a linear perturbation f 6 0 this problem can be solved efficiently by the canonical duality theory 67 also it was proved by the author 31 39 that the general quadratic integer problem pqi has a unique solution as long as the input f 6 0 is big enough these results show that the subjective function plays an essential role for symmetry breaking to leads a well posed problem to explain the theory and understand the np hard problems let us consider a simple problem in rn min x 1 2 1 2 x 2 2 xt f x rn 58 where 0 are given parameters let x 1 2 x 2 r the canonical dual function is d 1 2 1 f 2 1 2 1 2 59 which is defined on sc r 6 0 iff f 0 the criticality condition d 0 leads to a canonical dual equation 1 2 1 2 f 2 60 this cubic equation has at most three real solutions satisfying 1 0 2 3 and corre spondingly xi f i are three critical points of x by the fact that 1 s a r 0 x 1 is a global minimizer of p x while for 2 3 s a r 0 x 2 and x 3 are local min for n 1 and local max of x respectively see fig 2 a 4 2 2 4 6 4 2 2 4 6 4 2 2 4 6 4 2 2 4 6 4 2 2 4 10 5 5 10 a f 0 5 b f 0 c f 2 0 figure 2 graphs of x solid and d dashed 1 2 if we let f 0 the graph of x is symmetric i e the so called double well potential or the mexican hat for n 2 28 with infinite number of global minimizers satisfying x 2 2 17 in this case the canonical dual d 1 2 1 2 is strictly concave with only one critical point local maximizer 3 0 the corresponding solution x 3 f 3 0 is a local maximizer by the canonical dual equation 60 we have 1 2 0 located on the boundary of s a which corresponding to the two global minimizers x 1 2 2 for n 1 see fig 1 b if we let f 2 then the graph of x is quasi convex with only one critical point in this case 60 has only one solution 1 s c see fig 1 c conjecture 2 for any given properly posed problem p under the assumption 1 there exists a constant fc 0 such that pd has a unique solution in s c as long as f fc this conjecture shows that any properly posed problems are not np hard if the input f is big enough generally speaking most np hard problems have multiple solutions located either on the boundary or the outside of s c therefore a quadratic perturbation method can be suggested as k 1 2 k k 2 1 2 g k f k 1 2 k k k where k 0 k k 1 2 are perturbation parameters g k g ki and f k f k k thus the original canonical dual feasible space s c can be enlarged to s k sc g k 0 such that a perturbed canonical dual problem can be proposed as pdk max min k xa s k 61 based on this problem a canonical primal dual algorithm has been developed with successful applications for solving sensor network optimization problems 61 and chaotic dynamics 52 6 challenges and breakthrough now let us turn our attention to the most recent challenges from c za linescu who claimed in the beginning of his new paper 69 we believe one of the main aims of 5 is to question our counter examples in 7 6 8 9 10 11 12 15 16 13 14 readers can easily verify this false assertion by checking the first version 12 of 5 although the canonical duality triality theory has been repeatedly challenged by za linescu with two co workers in the 11 papers 6 14 and the author has been invited by journal editors to write responses he didn t do it as the mistakes in these papers are so basic and should be easily understood by experts in the communities also the author believes that the truth needs no defending the only half paragraph of comments on these false challenges added in the revision of 5 was based on the reviewers comments however even these added comments are considered by za linescu as one of main aims of 5 indeed za linescu has been fully alarmed on all author s recent papers and anxious to against any comments on his basic mistakes see 68 unfortunately without correct motivation and necessary knowledge for understanding the canonical duality theory more mistakes have been produced both ethically and mathematically 12 posted at http arxiv org abs 1310 2014 18 http arxiv org abs 1310 2014 6 1 mathematical mistakes za linescu s first aim in 69 is to point out a false assertion a not convincing proof a non adequate application of a result of the paper several inconsistencies the so called false assertion discovered by za linescu is only a sentence in author s paper 5 i e any convex quadratic function is objective by using a counterexample w u v u 2 2 v 2 za linescu proved that this assertion is false however it was written clearly in 5 equation 2 on page 3 that the objective function must be in the form of w du if we simply let d diag 1 2 and w d u v t u 2 v t then w w w 2 is truly an objective function in r 2 this basic mistake shows that za linescu works only on the one scale artificial optimization problem 1 and dose not understand the multi scale modeling of 2 a foundation not only for the canonical duality theory but also for entitle applied mathematics beautifully presented in g strang s textbook 66 from the first chapter of linear algebra to the last content on optimization 13 in the same section za linescu complained that the definition 6 1 2 of objective function in 1 is not clear at least because wa does not seem to be an objective set this complain shows that za linescu is confused about the difference between optimization in xa rn and nonlinear analysis in continuous space wa lp rd where x is not an unknown and as discussed in section 2 3 of this paper the stored energy w w u x w d is objective iff the stored energy density u x w is an objective function of w wa by any numerical approximation x will be disappeared such that u x w uk w and w w k uk w regarding the so called not convincing proof serious researcher should provide either a convincing proof or a disproof rather than a complaint note that the canonical dual variables 0 and 1 are in two different levers scales with totally different physical units 14 it is completely wrong to consider 0 1 as one vector and to discuss the concavity of 1 x on s a the condition s a is convex in theorem 2 5 should be understood in the way that s a is convex in 0 and 1 respectively as emphasized in remark 1 5 thus the proof of theorem 2 given in 5 is indeed convincing by simply using the classical saddle min max duality for x 0 and x 1 respectively regarding the non adequate application it is easy to check x 1 is a global minimizer since 1 1 s a and s a r r 0 q 0 is convex in and for any given q r thus example 1 is indeed an adequate application of theorem 2 in 5 dually za linescu s modified stored energy function w dx 1 2 x 2 in 69 is totally artificial against the basic law in current physics and assumption a 1 1 a 1 3 it is not surprise to have ints a which is the case for many artificially produced np hard problems the several inconsistencies discovered by za linescu proved the triality in the mathematical modeling p 0 i e the subjective function f u u u is necessary for any real world problems including the paper writing in physics the input u could be defects white noise or random dislocation and charges etc see 34 although there are many such inconsistencies and even mistakes in his publications including 1 2 the author never write any erratum as he has been busy in search natural beauty but realized that nothing is perfect in this real world 13 mit s online teaching project was started from gil strang s this textbook 14 let us consider example 1 in 5 if the unit for x is the meter m and for q is kg m then the units for the lagrange multiplier dual to the constraint g x 1 2 1 2 x 2 d 2 e should be kg m 3 and for canonical dual to x 1 2 x 2 should be kg m respectively so that each terms in 1 x make physical sense 19 indeed readers can easily find many typos and inconsistencies in za linescu s papers especially in his current short paper 69 6 2 non mathematical mistakes za linescu s second aim in 69 is quibbling about the basic mistakes in their false challenges published in 6 14 the author believes that by now serious researchers should have a clear understanding on the canonical duality triality theory its history and unified applications to multidisciplinary fields so he has no intention to argue with za linescu on tedious issues but to point out some hidden truths in the arguments and ethical mistakes made in 69 a in section 2 a za linescu wrote it is not possible to find a word containing bjective in gao strangs paper 2 so we have not any reason to guess that w has to be objective and f to be subjective in fact d y gao introduced 11 years later the notion objective function in his book 1 and also refers to a book by p g ciarlet published in 2013 objectivity is a basic concept in continuum physics and is usually discussed in the beginning of textbooks say page 8 in 55 published in 1983 any one who ever took a graduate course of nonlinear field theory should know that the stored energy w must be objective therefore most research papers don t mention this basic requirement except some review survey articles on interdisciplinary topics say 18 p g ciarlet s new book 2013 on nonlinear analysis 21 is based on his well known book on nonlinear elasticity published in 1988 in which this basic requirement is called the axiom of objectivity see page 101 20 the mathematical definition of the objectivity given in author s book definition 6 1 2 1 is based on axiom 3 3 1 in 20 which is correct and clear for any mathematicians who know the difference between the coordinates t x and the lagrangian coordinates u t x in gao strang s paper the geometrical constraint in ua is relaxed by the indicator ua u 0 if u ua if u ua such that the subjective function is written as the external super potential f u u u ua u see equation 85 in 2 it is a common sense that the minimum potential energy principle holds only for the so called dead loading systems i e the input u f u is independent of the output u thus the external energy f u must be linear on its effective domain otherwise the system is not conservative and the traditional variational method can t be applied in order to solve such problems a so called rate variational method was proposed by gao and onat in 1990 38 however m d voisei and c za linescu oppositely choose piecewise linear function w and quadratic function f as counterexamples to against gao and strang s paper with six conclusions including 10 about the complementary gap function one can conclude that it is useless at least in the current context the hope for reading an optimization theory with diverse applications is ruined clearly this is a duality mistake za linescu continues in a with we didn t find any mention about objective function with the meaning from 1 definition 6 1 2 until 2010 in gao s articles that is before submitting all our papers on gao s works however in his open letter to the author 15 za linescu wrote in 2006 i proposed my former student r strugariu to study your theory z 2 g 27 may 2008 some time ago i bought your book mentioned below and i began to read it clearly za linescu indeed read the book 1 before 2010 where the objective function is mathematically defined this contradiction proves that za linescu does not tell the truth in the arguments 15 za linescu 2012 open letter to david yang gao version 1 posted on his university web page 20 b za linescu wrote in b indeed we proved that practically all statements called triality theorem in gao s papers published before 2010 are false as discussed in section 3 3 the triality theorem was correctly proposed in 1997 from a post buckling problem where dim dim d 23 mathematical proof was given in 2000 25 for nonconvex variational problems generalization to global optimization was made in 2000 sooner in 2002 27 28 the author discovered that the double min duality does not hold in its strong form if dim 6 dim d but the triality theorem was still presented correctly in the either or form since the double max duality is always true careful readers can find immediately that instead of the original paper 25 its applications 36 37 were challenged and the three key papers 23 27 28 were never cited by za linescu and his co workers in 6 14 it is now necessary to exam how they proved the false of the triality theorem among the 11 papers 6 14 seven of them against the triality theorem in global opti mization the so called proof is mainly a set of counterexamples in 7 8 11 14 16 with dim 6 dim d which is exactly the additional condition discovered by the author in 27 28 this should be the only reason why 27 28 were not cited by these people one counterexample in 9 is the case that s c so voisei and za linescu concluded the con sideration of the function is useless at least for the problem studied in 46 16 however it was proved in 58 that by simply using a line perturbation f 6 0 this so called counterex ample can be solved nicely by the triality theorem to obtain all global optimal solutions the rest papers 6 10 12 13 challenged the triality theory in nonconvex analysis as dis cussed above counterexamples in 6 are simply using linear w and nonlinear f to against gao strang s paper 2 it is very interesting to point out that instead of arguing the mathe matical proof given in 25 voisei and za linescu challenged gao and ogden s papers 36 37 which are applications of 25 by using a thorough analysis and a convention 0 0 0 in measure theory they proved in 12 13 that the main result in triality theory is false and if 6 0 i e f 6 0 the canonical dual d is not well defined unfortunately they don t know a basic truth guaranteed by the canonical duality theory i e if f 6 0 then 0 can never happen see equation 60 otherwise newton s third law will be violated therefore d is indeed well defined also the constitutive law for phase transitions in continuum mechanics holds only at the scale about 10 3 m even the quantum mechanics can t reach the scale of zero measure therefore their papers 12 13 were rejected however voisei and za linescu couldn t understand their basic mistakes and had serious arguments with editors of these two decent mathematical physics journals 17 the most funny mistake ever made by za linescu and his co workers could be the one in their paper 6 published in a dynamical systems journal as it is known that the bi duality was first proposed and proved by the author for convex hamiltonian systems 1 where the lagrangian must be in its standard form l q p i e equation 12 in lagrangian mechanics instead of finding any possible mistakes in author s proof strugariu voisei and za linescu created an artificial lagrangian l x y 1 2 x 2 1 2 y 2 a x b y equation 1 in 6 16 the reference 46 is 3 in 9 17 see comments and links posted on http arxiv org abs 1202 3515 and http arxiv org abs 1101 3534 21 http arxiv org abs 1202 3515 http arxiv org abs 1101 3534 by using this lagrangian as well as the associated total action and its legendre dual f x max l x y y y 1 2 x 2 1 2 1 a x 2 b 2 x x g y max l x y x x 1 2 y 2 1 2 1 b y 2 a 2 y y they produced a series of very strange counterexamples to against the bi duality theory in con vex hamiltonian systems and the triality theory in geometrically nonlinear systems presented respectively by the author in chapters 2 and 3 1 they claimed because our counter examples are very simple using quadratic functions defined on whole hilbert even finite dimensional spaces it is difficult to reinforce the hypotheses of the above mentioned results in order to keep the same conclusions and not obtain trivialities clearly the quadratic function l x y is totally irrelevant to the lagrangian l q p in lagrangian mechanics and gao s book 1 without the differential operator d t the quadratic d c function f x or g y is defined on one scale space x or y and is unbounded therefore it s critical point does not produce any motion this basic mistake shows that these people don t have basic knowledge not only in lagrangian mechanics vibration produced by the duality between the kinetic energy t tu and the potential energy u u but also in d c programming unconstrained quadratic d c programming does not make any sense 49 it also shows that these people even don t know what the lagrangian coordinate is otherwise they would never use a time independent vector x rn as an unknown in dynamical systems and za linescu wouldn t complain the definition of the objectivity given in 1 moreover the triality theory was developed from geometrically nonlinear systems where the geometrical operator u must be nonlinear in order to have canonicality condition a 1 2 and the triality theory see 26 by the fact that only the geometrical nonlinearity can produce multiple local minimizers this is the reason why this terminology was emphasized in the title of gao strang s paper 2 however in 6 strugariu voisei and za linescu choose either a null u 0 example 3 4 or a linear u a u b example 3 5 as counterexamples to prove the false of the triality these mistakes show that these people really don t understand both the geometrical nonlinearity and the triality theorem even more since there is neither input in l x y nor initial boundary conditions in x all counterexamples they produced are simply not problems but only artificial models since they don t follow the basic roles in mathematical modeling such as the objectivity symmetry conservation and constitutive laws etc these artificial models are very strange and even ugly see examples 3 3 4 2 4 4 6 all these conceptual mistakes show that za linescu and his two co workers don t know what they are doing without understanding the title geometrical nonlinearity of 2 and the basic contents objectivity stored energy and external energy in nonlinear analysis they published the paper 10 in applicable analysis to against gao strang s work in nonlinear analysis without necessary knowledge of lagrangian mechanics they published the paper 6 in discrete continuous dynamical systems a to challenge gao s book on convex hamiltonian systems readers are suggested to check the special issues of these two journals to understand why these papers can be published c za linescu wrote in c i ask the authors of 5 to give precise references where our counter examples can be found in gao s works or elsewhere otherwise the statement these so called counterexamples are not new which were first discovered by gao is a calumny 22 all these counter examples are simply using the condition dim 6 dim d to against the double min duality indeed such a type of counter examples is too simple i e the double well problem 58 with n 2 which can be found easily in author s book 1 and many articles say 25 26 27 29 precisely example 5 1 in 27 and example 2 14 in 28 are the counter examples first discovered by the author in 2003 so it was written clearly in remark 1 on page 481 27 and remark of theorem 3 on page 288 28 that the double min duality 35 holds under certain additional conditions it has been proved either in author s book 1 or in recent papers 3 4 19 45 that dim dim d is the only condition for the double min duality anyone who knows the logic will surely understand the counterexamples discovered by gao in 2003 must be the same type as those listed in 6 14 by za linescu et al the only reason why the author didn t write down specifically the condition dim 6 dim d in 27 28 is that he was not sure if there is any other conditions so he was prefer to leave this uncertainty as an open problem to readers which is author s philosophy as the old saying hidden harmony is stronger than the explicit one serious researchers may ask why such simple duplicated counter examples can be published repeatedly in the international journals without citing 27 28 as za linescu indicated in his open letter the author is indeed one of three reviewers for his paper 11 and gao s papers 27 28 were pointed out in all the three reviewers reports 18 unfortunately voice and za linescu still refuse to cite these two key papers in their revision 11 but simply deleted the similar sentence a correction of this theory is impossible without falling into trivia as they conclude in 6 since 2012 the author and his co workers proved that even if dim 6 dim d the double min duality still holds weakly in a beautiful symmetrical form 19 45 59 za linescu knows these progress at least the paper 4 so his own statement in 69 indeed we proved that practically all statements called triality theorem in gao s papers published before 2010 are false is truly a calumny d in d za linescu wrote indeed we never cited gao s papers 6 7 19 the simple reason is that we learned about the so called open problem from gao s paper 6 see footnote 4 from 2 reports on our paper 11 received on 06 05 2010 at that moment 06 05 2010 all the 11 papers were already submitted as we know that za linescu has begun interesting in the canonical duality theory at least from 2006 at that time the author published a very few papers in optimization journals it is difficult to believe that za linescu didn t read 27 before to criticize this theory indeed any people if they simply check 14 should know immediately that this paper by voisei and za linescu was submitted to the journal on 27 4 2011 i e almost one year after that moment 06 05 2010 also the author is a reviewer both 27 28 were mentioned in the report but neither 27 nor 28 was cited by these people this contradiction shows again that za linescu does not tell the truth in 69 so there is no need to continue this discussion all the conceptual and mathematical mistakes in this set of published rejected papers 6 14 by za linescu and his two co workers show a significant gap between their thorough mathematics and the applicable mathematics that the canonical duality triality is based on 18 the author thanks these two reviewers for forwarding their reports the second reviewer indicated specifi cally the remark 1 in gao s paper 27 and he recommended these people to present their counter examples more as examples the third reviewer wrote clearly but counterexamples had already been discovered by gao in his earlier paper 19 i e gao s paper 27 28 23 as v i arnold concluded in his address 17 a teacher of mathematics who has not got to grips with at least some of the volumes of the course by landau and lifshitz will then become a relict like the one nowadays who does not know the difference between an open and a closed set 7 conclusions based on necessary conditions and basic laws in physics a unified multi scale global optimiza tion problem is proposed in the canonical form w d f f 62 the object w depends only on the model and w w 0 w wa is necessary w should be an objective function for physical systems but it is not necessary for artificial systems such as management manufacturing processes and numerical simulations etc the subject f depends on each properly posed problem and must satisfy f 0 together with necessary geometrical constraints for the output xa and equilibrium conditions for the input f x a the geometrical nonlinearity of is necessary for nonconvexity in global optimization bifurcation in nonlinear analysis chaos in dynamics and np hardness in computer science developed from large deformation nonconvex analysis mechanics the canonical duality triality is a precise mathematical theory with solid foundation in physics and natural root in philosophy so it is naturally related to the traditional theories and powerful methods in global optimization and nonlinear analysis by the fact that the canonical duality is a universal law of nature this theory can be used not only to model real world problems but also for solving a wide class of challenging problems in multi scale complex systems the conjectures proposed in this paper can be used for understanding and clarifying np hard problems both the linear operator d and the geometrical admissible operator can be generalized to the composition forms d dn d 1 m m 1 1 63 in order to model high order multi scale problems see chapter 4 1 and 29 47 48 in the set of 12 6 14 69 papers m d voisei c za linescu and his former stu dent r strugariu have made either mathematical mistakes failed to correctly understand the canonical duality triality theory and basic concepts in physics and nonlinear analysis or ethic mistakes repeatedly using the same condition dim 6 dim d as counter examples to against the double min duality without citing author s original papers 27 28 wherein this condition was first discovered the mathematical mistakes show a huge gap between mathe matical optimization and nonlinear analysis mechanics it is author s hope that by reading this paper the readers can have a clear understanding not only on the canonical duality triality theory and its potential applications in multidisciplinary fields but also on the generalized duality triality principle and its role in modeling understanding real world problems acknowledgements the author should express his sincerely appreciation to his co workers students and colleagues for their understanding excellent collaborations and constant supports for developing an unconventional theory in different fields especially during the very difficult time caused by the false challenges valuable comments and advices from professor hanif 24 sherali at virginia tech and professor shu cherng fang at north carolina state university are highly appreciated
