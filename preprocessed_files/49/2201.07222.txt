avoidance of the lavrentiev gap for one dimensional non autonomous functionals with state constraints carlo mariconda january 20 2022 keywords regularity lipschitz minimizing sequence approximation radial convexity control effective domain extended valued gap abstract let f y t t l s y s y s ds be a positive functional the en ergy unnecessarily autonomous defined on the space of sobolev func tions w 1 p t t rn p 1 we consider the problem of minimizing f among the functions y that possibly satisfy one or both end point condi tions in many applications where the lack of regularity or convexity or growth conditions does not ensure the existence of a minimizer of f it is important to be able to approximate the value of the infimum of f via a sequence of lipschitz functions satisfying the given boundary conditions sometimes even with some polynomial coercive and convex lagrangians in the velocity variable thus ensuring the existence of a minimizer in the given sobolev space this is not achievable this fact is know as the lavren tiev phenomenon the paper deals on the avoidance of the lavrentiev phe nomenon under the validity of a further given state constraint of

rn with f y we give a constructive recipe for building a sequence yh h of lipschitz reparametrizations of y sharing with y the same boundary condition s that converge in energy to f y with respect to previous literature on the subject we distinguish the case of just one end point condition from that of both enlarge the class of lagrangians that satisfy the sufficient conditions and show that yh h converge also in w 1 p to y moreover the results apply also to ex tended valued lagrangians whose effective domain is bounded the results gives new clues even when the lagrangian is autonomous i e of the form l s y y y y the paper follows two recent papers 23 24 of the author on the subject 1 introduction we consider here a one dimensional vectorial functional of the calculus of varia tions f y t t l s y s y s ds defined on the space of sobolev functions w 1 p i rn on i t t with val ues in rn for some p 1 in the paper the lagrangian l s y u is borel and is assumed to have values in 0 following the terminology of control theory we will refer to s as to the time variable to y as to the state variable and to u as to the velocity variable unless there is a minimizer it may be desirable to approximate the infimum of the energy f through a se quence of values f yh along a sequence yh h of lipschitz functions that pos sibly share some desired boundary values and constraints though the lips chitz functions are dense in w 1 p i rn unless some a priori growth assump tions from above are satisfied this approximation is not always possible this fact is summarized saying that the lavrentiev phenomenon occurs of course the gap does not occur if the minimizers exist and are lipschitz we refer the interested reader to 18 17 19 11 12 26 6 conditions ensuring the non occurrence of the phenomenon other than lipschitz regularity of the minimizers were established by alberti and serra cassano in 1 in the autonomous case i e l s y u l y u where they showed that for the problem with one end point condition the phenomenon does not occur under a suitable local bound edness condition when the lagrangian is non autonomous the gap may occur though being quite rare if l is coercive see 32 even with innocent looking avoidance of the gap 3 lagrangians like in mania s 22 problem minf y 1 0 y 3 s 2 y 6 ds y w 1 1 i y 0 0 y 1 1 several results concerning the non autonomous case are present in the literature see 20 29 31 but require some additional regularity of the lagrangian on the state variable not present in the autonomous case as carlson shows in 10 many do actually derive from angell cesari property d introduced in 16 an extension of 1 theorem 2 4 for non autonomous lagrangians of the form l s y u s y u s y without requiring further regularity on the state or velocity variables of was recently provided by the author in 24 where it is pointed out that the conditions that ensure the non occurrence of the gap for problems with just one end point condition may even in the autonomous case not be sufficient for those with both end point conditions the difficulty of preserv ing the boundary condition was noticed also in the multidimensional setting see 8 27 28 in this situation 24 theorem 3 1 introduces a new sufficient condi tion conjectured by alberti covering mostly the case of real valued lagrangians or when the effective domain of i e the set where is finite contains an un bounded rectangle another direction was followed by cellina and his collaborators ferriero mar chini treu zagatti in 14 12 for non autonomous problems and in 13 with marchini for lagrangians of the form l s y u y u s y under an ad ditional convexity hypothesis on u 7 y u continuity of here given y w 1 p i rn with f y the convexity assumption on allows to build a sequence of lipschitz reparametrizations yh h of y with the desired end point conditions yh t y t yh t y t and such that lim suph f yh f y in particular since yh i y i for all h the sequence preserves possible state con straints this reparametrizations technique was the key tool in 23 to establish the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for the problem with two end point constraints followed in 23 corollary 5 7 for non autonomous lagrangians l s y u s y u assuming in the real valued case a local lipschitz condition named s by many authors on s 7 s y u property s is known to be a sufficient condition for the validity of the du bois reymond equation we refer to 15 for the smooth case to 17 for the nonsmooth convex case under weak growth assumptions to 4 6 by bettiol and the author in the general case avoidance of the gap 4 radial convexity on in the velocity variable i e convexity of 0 r 7 s y ru the role of radial convexity in lipschitz regularity was shown by the author jointly with treu in 26 for the autonomous case with bettiol in 4 6 5 in the general case and for some optimal control problems a suitable local boundedness conditions a linear growth condition from below of the form s y u u d 0 in the extended valued case the same conclusion was obtained under the addi tional requirement that the limit of at the boundary of the domain is giving new light in the case where the effective domain of is bounded the above condition s and the local boundedness condition are essential to establish the non occurrence of the gap the emphasis in 23 was given to establish not only the non occurrence of the gap but even the existence of equi lipschitz minimiz ing sequences with some uniformity in the initial time and datum assuming a very mild growth condition from below introduced by clarke in 17 in view of the results of 24 some questions concerning the results of 23 arise 1 may one extend the results of 23 to the class of lagrangians of the form s y u s y considered in 24 with alone satisfying s notice that this class il strictly larger than the one of functions s y u satisfying s for instance l s y u s y u s y with s 0 1 y u r s y u u 2 s y s does not satisfy s but does 2 which of the conditions formulated in 23 corollary 5 7 are really needed for the one end point condition problem 3 can the reparametrization argument work used in the proof of 23 theo rem 5 1 be adapted for the more general class of lagrangians considered in 24 is radial convexity w r t the velocity variable sufficient for the purpose 4 can one get rid of the growth assumptions from below needed in 23 all of the above questions have an answer in theorem 3 2 and corollary 3 6 in particular the answer to questions 1 2 and 3 are positive moreover with respect avoidance of the gap 5 to 23 we weaken a local boundedness condition in the spirit of 7 proposition 3 15 and show that a linear growth from below see 2 8 is just a desirable though unnecessary option moreover it turns out that the limit condition on at the boundary of the domain is not needed for the one end point condition problem a new fact with respect to the previous literature 13 12 23 based on the reparametrization method is given y w 1 p i rn the convergence of the built lipschitz approximating sequences yh h not only in energy but also in w 1 p norm to y the method is constructive in example 5 1 we show how to build an explicit suitable lipschitz approximating sequence following the recipe of the proof of theorem 3 2 a discussion on the choice of alternative distance like functions other than the euclidean one is outlined in 2 7 in order to include a more ample class of extended valued lagrangians 2 notation and basic assumptions 2 1 basic assumptions let p 1 the functional f sometimes referred as to the energy is defined by y w 1 p i rn f y i l s y s y s ds where l s y v is of the form l s y v s y v s y basic assumptions we assume the following conditions i t t is a closed bounded interval of r i rn rn 0 s y u 7 s y u n 1 is borel measurable i rn 0 is borel the effective domain of given by dom s y u i rn rn s y u is of the form dom i d with d rn rn avoidance of the gap 6 2 2 notation we introduce the main recurring notation the euclidean norm of x rn is denoted by x the lebesgue measure of a subset a of i t t is a no confusion may occur with the euclidean norm if y i rn we denote by y i its image by y its sup norm and by y p its norm in lp i rn the complement of a set a in rn is denoted by ac the characteristic function of a set a is a if x r we denote by x its positive part by x its negative part lip i rn y i rn y lipschitz if n 1 we simply write lip i for p 1 w 1 p i rn y i rn y y lp i rn if n 1 we simply write w 1 p i 2 3 two variational problems we shall consider different variational problems associated to the functional f with different end point conditions and or state constraints let x y rn and s rn we define if x s we set sx y w 1 p i rn y t x y i s and the corresponding variational problem minimize f y y sx psx whenever inf psx if x y s we set sx y y w 1 p i rn y t x y t y y i s and the corresponding variational problem minimize f y y sx y psx y whenever inf psx y avoidance of the gap 7 for the problems with one end point constraint there is no privilege in considering the initial condition y t x instead of the final one y t y any result obtained here for the above variational problems can be reformulated for a final end point prescribed variational problems with the same set of assumptions 2 4 lavrentiev gap at a function and lavrentiev phenomenon in this paper we consider different boundary data for the same integral functional definition 2 1 lavrentiev gap at y w 1 p i rn let y w 1 p i rn be such that f y and let sx s x y we say that the lavrentiev gap does not occur at y for the variational problem corresponding to if there exists a sequence yh h n of functions in lip i r n satisfying 1 h n yh 2 lim sup h f yh f y 3 yh y in w 1 p i rn we say that the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for the variational prob lem corresponding to if inf y w 1 p i rn y f y inf y lip i rn y f y remark 2 2 gap and phenomenon condition 2 in definition 2 1 is less restrictive than the one that is usually considered i e that lim h f yh f y we believe that this one here is more appropriate to describe the lavrentiev gap let y w 1 p i rn the non occurrence of the phenomenon at y en sures that given 0 there is a lipschitz function y satisfying the same boundary data and or constraints such that f y f y if l s y is convex for all s y i rn and l s is lower semicontinuous the non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap at y implies the convergence of yh h to y in energy i e lim h f yh f y indeed in that case f is weakly lower semicontinuous avoidance of the gap 8 of course the non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap along a minimizing sequence implies the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for the same variational problem the following celebrated example motivates the need to distinguish problems with just one end point condition from problems with both end points conditions example 2 3 mania s example 22 consider the problem of minimizing f y 1 0 y 3 s 2 y 6 ds y w 1 1 i y 0 0 y 1 1 p 0 1 then y s s 1 3 is a minimizer and f y 0 not only y is not lipschitz it turns out see 9 4 3 that the lavrentiev phenomenon occurs i e 0 minf f y inf f y y lip 0 1 y 0 0 y 1 1 however as it is noticed in 9 the situation changes drastically if one allows to vary the initial boundary condition along the sequence yh h indeed it turns out that the sequence yh h where each yh is obtained by truncating y at 1 h h n 1 as follows yh s 1 h 1 3 if s 0 1 h s 1 3 otherwise is a sequence of lipschitz functions satisfying yh 1 y 1 1 f yh f y yh y in w 1 1 0 1 therefore no lavrentiev phenomenon occurs for the variational problem minf y 1 0 y 3 s 2 y 6 ds y w 1 1 i y 1 1 2 5 condition s we consider the following local lipschitz condition s on the first variable of condition s for every k 0 of rn there are 0 l 1 t t 0 satisfying for a e s i s 2 z v s 1 z v s z v v p s s 2 s 1 whenever s 1 s 2 s s i z bk v rn s z v dom avoidance of the gap 9 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 figure 1 the function yh remark 2 4 condition s is fulfilled if y u is autonomous in the smooth setting condition s ensures the validity of the erdmann du bois reymond edbr condition in this more general framework it plays a key role in lipschitz regularity under slow growth conditions 17 6 23 and ensures the validity of the edbr for real valued lagrangians 4 6 2 6 structure assumptions we require here some additional structure assumptions on structure assumptions geometry of the effective domain of for every z rn the set v rn z v d is strictly star shaped on the variable u w r t the origin i e z v d 0 r 1 z rv d radial convexity of in the velocity variable for a e s i for all z v rn rn 0 r 7 s z rv is convex ac remark 2 5 assumption ac implies that for every s z v dom there is a convex subdifferential for 0 r 7 s z rv at r 1 namely a real number avoidance of the gap 10 q s z v such that r 0 s z rv s z v q s z v r 1 we shall denote by r s z rv r 1 the set of these subdifferentials i e the con vex subgradient of 0 r 7 s z rv at r 1 it is easy to realize see for instance 30 4 that assumption ac is equivalent at every s z v dom of the convexity of the map 0 7 s z v in this case if p s z v s z v 1 we have 0 s z v s z v p s z v 1 2 1 notice that in the smooth case p s z v s z v v v s z v 2 7 distance like functions and the compatibility condition d in all the paper one can replace a distance like function with the euclidean dis tance diste and condition d with the requirement that dom is open in i rn rn it might be convenient however to consider other functions than diste a distance like function is a positive function that behaves like the euclidean dis tance on pairs of i rn rn having the same two first components definition 2 6 distance like function dist let w be the subset of pairs of elements of i rn rn whose two first components coincides a distance like function is a function dist with values in 0 defined on a suitable symmetric subset of pairs of i rn rn containingw that coincides with the euclidean distance onw i e for all s z i rn and v 1 v 2 rn dist s z v 1 s z v 2 v 2 v 1 for all s z v i rn rn and a i rn rn we set dist s z v a inf dist s z v a avoidance of the gap 11 here are some examples of distance like functions example 2 7 u distance euclidean distance and infinity distance we shall denote by diste the usual euclidean distance in i rn rn distu is the function defined on the pairs of points i s z vi i rn rn i 1 2 with the same first two components by distu 1 2 v 2 v 1 remark 2 8 a distance like function is not necessarily a distance on i rn rn for instance distu is not a distance definition 2 9 well inside dom for dist we say that a subset a of dom is well inside dom w r t a distance like function dist if it is contained in s y u dom dist s y u dom c for a suitable 0 example 2 10 let us examine the property that a set a is well inside dom for the distance like functions dist e u introduced in example 2 7 if e the above means that for all s y u a the open ball of radius in i rn rn and center in s y u is contained in dom if u the above means that s y u a 0 r s y u ru dom if any subset of dom even dom itself is well inside dom notice that if s y u dom then diste dom l c distu dom l c 2 2 thus ifmdist is the class of sets that are well inside dom w r t dist e u we have mdiste mdistu 2 3 example 2 11 the inclusions 2 3 are strict in general let be autonomous and dom y u r 2 y 1 then the set y u r 2 y 1 u 1 is well inside dom w r t to distu but not w r t diste avoidance of the gap 12 example 2 12 let in i r r a i b 1 0 0 2 then for all s i diste s 0 1 a c 0 distu s 0 1 a c 1 we shall impose the following compatibility condition with the effective do main of condition d a distance like function dist satisfies d if for all s z v dom and 0 there exists v v with s z v dom dist s z v dom c 0 remark 2 13 of course condition d is satisfied if s z v dom dist s z v dom c 0 example 2 14 let us consider condition d for the distance like functions in troduced in example 2 7 regarding the euclidean distance diste condition d is satisfied if dom is open in i rn rn if dist distu defined above condition d is satisfied whenever for all s z v dom there are v v and 0 such that v v 0 for every s z v dom c indeed in this case distu s z v dom c inf v v s z v dom c if n 1 taking into account the fact that dom is star shaped in the last variable it is enough to check that dist s z 0 dom c 0 when ever s z 0 dom indeed if s z v dom and v 6 0 then s z v dom and distu s z v dom c min v v v 0 for all v in the relative interior of the segment joining 0 to v 2 8 a useful option linear growth from below for the following additional linear growth from below on is not assumed in the main results however its validity allows to weaken some of the hypotheses of corollary 3 6 below avoidance of the gap 13 there are 0 and d 0 satisfying for a e s 0 t and every z rn v rn s z v v d g lemma 2 15 24 let y w 1 p i rn be such that f y assume that fulfills g and that the infimum of along the graph of y is strictly positive i e py there is my 0 such that s z my for all s i z y i then y 1 f y my d t t my 3 non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap phenomenon for psx and p s x y we assume that the infima of both problem psx and p s x y is finite i e that each of them has at least an admissible trajectory 3 1 non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap the results of this section make use of the following notion of limit definition 3 1 let dist be a distance like function and g i rn we write that lim dist s z v dom c 0 s z v unif w r t s z g if for all r 0 there exists 0 such that for all s z v dom dist s z v dom c s z g s z v r theorem 3 2 non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap for p sx and p s x y at y w 1 p i rn let y w 1 p i rn be such that s y s y s s y s l 1 i and let b f y let dist be a distance like function satisfying d in addition to the basic assumptions and the structure assumptions on suppose avoidance of the gap 14 by is bounded on i y i cy z is continuous for every z y i bwy there is 0 0 such that is bounded on i y i b 0 dom b y there is y 1 t t such that is bounded on the subsets of i y i b that are well inside dom w r t dist moreover assume that s y y l 1 i then 1 there is no lavrentiev gap for psx at y 2 in addition assume py there is my 0 such that s z my for all s i z y i and that either is real valued or ly lim dist s z v dom c 0 s z v unif w r t s z i y i there is no lavrentiev gap for psx y at y remark 3 3 notice that in theorem 3 2 the integrability of s y y is satisfied if satisfies condition py indeed if my on i y i then t t s y s y s ds 1 my f y remark 3 4 choice of a suitable distance like function the choice of a distance like function relies on the need of the validity of condition d or ly and of b y assume that distj is a distance like function defined on a set of triples wj of i rn rn j 1 2 with s y u dom dist 1 s y u dom c dist 2 s y u dom c this is the situation for instance if dist 1 distu and dist 2 diste since from 2 3 the sets that are well inside dom w r t dist 2 are well inside dom w r t dist 1 the validity of hypothesis b y w r t dist 1 implies its validity with dist 2 avoidance of the gap 15 since from 2 2 for any s z v dom and 0 dist 2 s z v dom c dist 1 s z v dom c 3 1 then the validity of d for dist 2 implies its validity for dist 1 analogously from 3 1 it follows that the validity of hypothesis ly w r t dist 2 implies its validity w r t dist 1 in particular there is no way to find a distance like function for which ly is fulfilled if the later is not valid w r t distu in particular for any distance like function dist we have distu s y u dom c dist s y u dom c therefore the validity of b y w r t distu implies its validity w r t dist and if d resp ly does not hold w r t distu then the property does not hold w r t dist remark 3 5 the conclusions of 24 theorem 3 1 are those of theorem 3 2 when s rn the two theorems do essentially share a same set of assumptions concerning the function concerning both assume assumption s which is not technical the celebrated example by ball and mizel in 2 exhibits a positive lagrangian s y y that is a polynomial superlinear and convex in y thus satisfying all the assumptions of claim 2 of theorem 3 2 except condition s for which the lavrentiev phenomenon occurs for some suitable initial and end boundary data however instead of conditions bwy and b y it is assumed in 24 theorem 3 1 that by there is 0 0 such that is bounded on i oy b 0 and moreover for the two end point conditions problem instead of ly it is assumed in 24 theorem 3 1 that uy there is an open subset uy of y i such that for all r 0 is bounded on i uy br hypothesis bwy in theorem 3 2 is less restrictive than hypothesis by of 24 theorem 3 1 and does no more imply that the effective domain avoidance of the gap 16 y u y i n 0 y u n 0 l 0 y i figure 2 the effective domain of an autonomous lagrangian y y n 1 dist diste and the validity of the assumptions in theorem 3 2 a

on y i b 0 dom darker region and there is y 1 t t such that is bounded on the relatively compact subsets of y i b dom e g the dotted region it is also required that dom is star shaped w r t 0 in the last variable of contains a rectangle of the form i y i b 0 as a counterpart theorem 3 2 requires the additional hypothesis b y figure 1 illustrates the various assumptions in the case of an autonomous lagrangian with 1 hypothesis uy implies that is finite on the infinite strip i uy rn functions whose effective domain is bounded cannot be considered for the two end point conditions problems in 24 theorem 3 1 if dist diste hypothesis b y and condition d are satisfied if dom is open in i y i rn and is bounded on the relatively compact subsets of dom contained in i y i rn hypothesis ly in claim 2 of theorem 3 2 implies the validity of condi tion d when is allowed to take the value ly is not merely a technical assumption in the absence of ly the lavrentiev phenomenon may occur see example 5 1 avoidance of the gap 17 3 2 non occorrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon corollary 3 6 non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for p sx and for p sx y let dist be a distance like function satisfying d in addition to the basic assumptions and the structure assumptions on suppose moreover that for all k 0 the following hypotheses hold b is bounded on i bk c z is continuous for every z bk p there is m 0 such that s z m for all s i z rn bw there is 0 0 such that is bounded on i bk b 0 dom b for all 0 is bounded on the bounded subsets of i bk b that are well inside dom w r t dist then 1 the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for psx 2 assume in addition that either is real valued or for all k 0 l lim dist s z v dom c 0 s z v unif w r t s i z bk the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for psx y 3 if in addition to the assumptions satisfies p and fulfills g the conclusions of claims 1 2 hold whenever hypotheses b c bw b and l are satisfied for just one value of k k 0 where k 0 x inf p m d t t m p psx p s x y and just one value of 0 with 0 inf p m d t t m t t p psx p s x y avoidance of the gap 18 proof we prove claim 2 and the part of claim 3 concerning problem psx y the other parts of corollary 3 6 follow with obvious changes let yj j be a minimiz ing sequence for psx y such that j n f yj inf psx y 1 j 1 fix j n the hypotheses of corollary 3 6 with k yj i imply the validity of those of theorem 3 2 with y replaced by yj its application yields yj lip i rn satisfying the desired boundary conditions and state constraints and moreover f yj f yj 1 j 1 inf psx y 2 j 1 if satisfies p and satisfies g then from lemma 2 15 for each j n we have yj 1 f yj m d t t m we may assume in the proof of claim 2 that j is big enough in such a way that f yj m d t t m t t inf psx y 2 j 1 m d t t m t t 0 2 j 1 m t t and yj x yj 1 x inf psx y 2 j 1 m d t t m k 0 2 j 1 m k so that yj i bk the claim follows remark 3 7 as noticed in 24 the assumption m 0 in claim 2 of corollary 3 6 cannot be weakened to 0 in general indeed mania s ex ample 2 3 shows that the lavrentiev phenomenon with prescribed initial and end conditions may occur when 0 is allowed to take the value 0 even when is autonomous avoidance of the gap 19 remark 3 8 when s rn the conclusions of corollary 3 6 are those of 24 corollary 3 6 the hypotheses concerning do almost overlap whereas the requirements on differ quite a lot indeed in 24 corollary 3 6 it is required that b for all k 0 there is 0 0 such that is bounded on i bk b 0 and for the two end point conditions problem that is real valued and u for all k r 0 is bounded on i bk br it appears that the hypotheses of corollary 3 6 are more suitable than those of 24 corollary 3 6 to deal with extended valued lagrangians and allow functions that possess a bounded effective domain indeed hypothesis bw in corollary 3 6 is of course fulfilled if b of 24 corol lary 3 6 holds however it is satisfied if just is real valued and bounded on the bounded subsets of dom hypothesis b is of course equivalent to the fact that is bounded on the bounded subsets that are well inside dom claim 3 of corollary 3 6 motivates the formulation in terms of k and differently from hypothesis u of 24 corollary 3 6 condition l in corollary 3 6 does not force to be real valued many of the assumptions of corollary 3 6 are satisfied for real valued con tinuous lagrangians it is worth writing explicitly the result in this case the main novelty with respect to claim 2 in 24 corollary 3 6 is the presence of the state constraint in the variational problem at the price of radial convexity in the velocity variable corollary 3 9 non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for p sx y real valued case suppose in addition to the basic assumptions and the radial convexity ac of s z that are real valued and is continuous and stictly positive is bounded on bounded sets then the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for for psx y avoidance of the gap 20 4 proof of the main result the proof of theorem 3 2 follows the lines of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 where the attention was more focused on the construction of a equi lipschitz minimizing sequence with some uniformity with respect to the initial time and datum we will emphasize the the new points which are condition b y is new and arises from 7 see lemma 4 1 below it weak ens the condition b in 23 proposition 4 24 since the latter requires that i bk b dom the presence of the function the convergence yh y in w 1 1 i rn claim 1 of theorem 3 2 and claim 1 of corollary 3 6 are new even in the autonomous case with 1 and s y u l y u 4 1 a fundamental lemma the proof of theorem 3 2 relies on the following result lemma 4 1 7 24 let k be a bounded set and let dist be a distance like function assume that a there is 0 such that is bounded on the subsets of 0 t k b that are well inside dom w r t dist b there is 0 0 such that is bounded on 0 t k b 0 dom let for any s z v dom p s z v s z v 1 then i p is bounded on the bounded subsets of i k b that are well inside dom w r t dist ii for all 0 inf s i z k v s z v dom dist s z v dom c p s z v avoidance of the gap 21 iii there is 0 0 such that sup s i z k v 0 s z v dom p s z v the proof of lemma 4 1 follows narrowly the arguments given in 23 lemma 4 18 proposition 4 24 and the new arguments involved in 7 proposition 3 15 in a different framework we give the full details due to its importance in the proof of theorem 3 2 for the convenience of the reader proof we will use the fact that p s z v s z v q s z v for some q s z v r s z ru r 1 i let s z v dom and q s z v s z ru 1 suppose that for some 0 z k v and dist s z v dom c the fact that dist is a distance like function implies that dist s z v 2 v dom c 2 assuming that r s z ru r 1 6 we obtain s z v 2 v s z v 2 q s z v the boundedness assumption of implies that q s z v is bounded above by a constant depending only on and similarly from s z v 2 v s z v 2 c q s z v we deduce an upper bound for q ii the set s z v dom z k v dist s z v dom c is contained in 0 t k b and is well inside dom the claim follows immediately from i iii let s z v dom with z k and v 0 v u the assumption that dom is star shaped in the control variable implies that s z 0 v v dom avoidance of the gap 22 and thus s z 0 v v s z v q s z v 0 v 1 from which we deduce that s z v q s z v s z 0 v v 0 v q s z v 4 1 the assumptions imply that s z 0 v v c 1 k 0 for some constantc 1 k 0 depending only on k 0 we now provide un upper bound for q s z v since s z 0 2 v v dom then s z 0 2 v v s z v q s z v 0 2 v 1 4 2 so that the fact that is bounded from below by d gives q s z v 1 1 0 2 v s z 0 2 v v s z v 2 s z 0 2 v v d c 2 k 0 4 3 for some constant c 2 k 0 depending only on k and 0 it follows from 4 2 4 3 that the right hand side of 4 1 is bounded above by a constant depending only on k and 0 4 2 change of variables and approximations we shall often make use of the following change of variables formula for lebesgue integrals proposition 4 2 change of variables for lebesgue integrals 3 corollary 3 16 let f 0 be measurable and i i be bijective absolutely continuous with 0 on i then for every a i f l 1 a f l 1 1 a and a f s ds 1 a f d avoidance of the gap 23 the following approximation argument will be used in the sequel lemma 4 3 let f l 1 i and be a sequence of bijiective absolutely continuous functions i i with for all n 0 on i lipschitz inverse bounded t t uniformly then f f in l 1 i proof consider a sequence gm m of smooth functions on i such that gm f in l 1 i for each m in n we have f f 1 f gm 1 gm gm 1 gm f 1 clearly for each m we have gm gm uniformly as moreover from proposition 4 2 the change of variable s gives f

that for all 0 otherwise there is 0 such that y s a e on i and the conclusion of theorem 3 2 follows trivially ii choice of there is 0 in such a way that for all 0 indeed it follows easily from step i that the set s i y s is non negligible so that s y s y s dom and y s for s on a non negligible subset z of i here condition d plays its role for any s z we have dist s y s v dom c 0 for some v y s therefore there is a non negligible subset z of z and 0 such that for a e s z dist s y s y s dom c y s it follows from hypotheses bwy b y and lemma 4 1 that there is 0 0 such that 0 0 r 0 r v for any

which we obtain the estimate 0 i t t f y my t t as therefore i t t as the claim follows v let 0 be as in claim ii there are b 0 1 0 1 and a subset of with t t such that for a e s s y s y s dom y s dist s y s y s dom c see step vi of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 it is a consequence of step iv it is essential here that the chosen distance like function dist acts as the euclidean one on the pairs ofw avoidance of the gap 26 vi for every 0 define s s i y s s y s 1 ds then s 0 0 y 1 0 as indeed s s y s ds y 1 vii choice of 0 of and definition of taking into account claim vi we choose max 0 in such a way that y 1 min 1 t t 2 1 y 4 4 let m sup s z s i z y i notice that for each 0 0 let where is as in step v and set 2 1 y s y y 1 y pp we choose is large enough in such a way that y 1 m y 1 m 0 2 4 5 from now on we set choose a measurable subset of such that 1 this is possible since from 4 4 and step v 1 t t t viii s is negligible this follows as in step x of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 avoidance of the gap 27 ix the change of variable we introduce the following absolutely continuous change of variable i r defined by t t for a e i y if s if 1 otherwise as in step xi of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 is strictly increasing and i i is bijective let us denote by its inverse which is absolutely continuous and lipschitz with 1 x set for all s t t y s y s 4 6 then y w 1 p t t rn satisfies the boundary conditions thus proving a of the initial claim of the proof this follows exactly as in step xii of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 xi y wn 1 t t rn and y is bounded indeed for all s t t y s y s y s if s s y s if s y s otherwise since y s a e out of s it turns out from the fact that that y s max xii the following estimate holds t t s 1 ds 2 this follows exactly as in step xiv of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 avoidance of the gap 28 xiii since s s y s pointwise from hypothesis cy and the fact that s y y l 1 i we may choose big enough in such a way that t t s y y y s y ds 2 4 7 xiv a e in y y y y 1 4 8 this goes exactly as in step vii of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 xv estimate of f y in terms of t t y y y d we have f y t t s y y s y ds 4 9 taking into account 4 20 the change of variables s i yields in what follows for brevity we omit the argument of the functions t t s y y s y ds t t y y y d js j j 1 4 10 where we set js s y y y y y d j y y y d j 1 i s y y y d the main ingredient here is the subgradient inequality 2 1 applied as follows for every s z v dom and 0 such that s z v dom we have 0 s z v s z v p s z v 1 avoidance of the gap 29 estimate of js js s y y y d m 4 11 following step xv of the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 a e in s we obtain y y y y y y y 1 4 12 notice in view of the proof of claim 1 that the validity of 4 12 does not depend on steps iv v and thus it does not rely on hypothesis ly or on hypothesis py or on the fact that is supposed to be real valued we deduce from 4 12 that a e in s y y y y y y y y y 1 m whence 4 11 estimate of j since and 1 it is immediate from 4 8 of step xiv that j y y y d 1 m y y y d m 4 13 therefore from 4 9 4 10 4 11 and 4 13 we deduce the required estimate f y js j j 1 t t y y y d m 4 14 xvi estimate of t t y y y d t t y y y d t t y y y d m 2 4 15 avoidance of the gap 30 indeed a e on i we have y y y q 1 q 2 y y y where q 1 y y y y y y q 2 y y y y y y it follows from 4 7 that t t q 2 d 2 condition s with k y and step

the fact that from step xi 0 see lemma 4 3 d y y p d 2 p 1 p 1 y p d y p ds 4 18 since 0 as then y p d 0 and as moreover from steps vi vii 1 ds d 1 y 1 1 0 as it follows from 4 18 that d 0 as s d s y

deduce from 4 17 that t t y y p ds 0 which concludes the proof of theorem 3 2 proof of claim 1 the proof differs slightly from that of claim 2 as in the proof of 24 theorem 3 1 the change of variables maps t t onto a bigger interval i containing i and i i as more precisely referring to the proof of claim 2 of theorem 3 2 we do not need here to introduce the parameter and its related properties formulated in steps iii iv v whose validity depend on the extra assumptions py ly or on the fact that is real valued we just sketch the proof focusing on the slight differences we keep steps i ii i ii we skip steps iii iv v we set defined in step ii and i we keep step vi and in step vii we choose in such a way that y 1 2 1 y we set step viii now states that s is negligible avoidance of the gap 33 ix the change of variable we introduce the following absolutely continuous change of variable i r defined by t t for a e i y if s 1 otherwise again is strictly increasing but now since 1 on i i is an interval containing i we denote by the restriction of the inverse of to i is absolutely continuous and lipschitz moreover i i and i i as x set for all s t t y s y s 4 20 then y w 1 p t t rn satisfies the boundary condition y t x notice that y s y s y s if s s y s otherwise the new fact is that now y t y t y t x but y t y t y t for some t t so that it may happen that y t 6 y t we now proceed as in the proof of claim 2 without considering the estimate for j in step xv and of d in step xvii since i i we need a little more care in the estimates in the last steps the change of variable being now s with i i xv instead of 4 10 we obtain t t s y y s y ds i y y y d xvi instead of 4 15 one gets t t y y y d i y y y d m 2 avoidance of the gap 34 xvii therefore 4 16 is now f y i s y y s y ds m 2 f y m 2 xviii similar arguments apply to the proof of the convergence of y to y in l 1 i taking into account that 4 17 becomes t t y y p ds t t y y p ds i y y p d i s d s d where stands for y y p remark 4 4 in the case of a final end point constraint instead of the initial one claim 1 of theorem 3 2 may be obtained by slightly modifying step xi of the proof indeed it is enough to define t t for a e i y if s 1 otherwise remark 4 5 in the case of one end point constraint or if is real valued the proof of theorem 3 2 is constructive indeed in the first case the approximating functions y are defined by y y where is defined in step ix and depends just on y and the set s s i y s for problems with both end point constraints and real valued lagrangians once chosen and as in step v it is enough to choose a subset nu of as in step vii i e in such a way that 1 s y s ds one then defines the reparametrization as in step ix and proceeds as above some explicit approximating sequences qe built in example 5 1 and example 5 2 avoidance of the gap 35 5 examples 5 1 autonomous case the next examples concern the autonomous case i e z v and 1 example 5 1 below shows that hypothesis ly is essential for the

value and condition ly is not fulfilled w r t distu and thus w r t any other distance like function see remark 3 4 c claim there is no lavrentiev phenomenon for f with the end point constraint z 1 1 the validity of claim 1 of theorem 3 2 implies the non occurrence avoidance of the gap 37 of the lavrentiev phenomenon for the associated variational problems with just one end point constraint either z 0 y 0 0 or z 1 y 1 1 but not both we point out that this conclusion could not be obtained as a consequence of 24 theorem 3 1 since hypothesis by is violated here indeed z v takes the value if z 0 1 d construction of a family of lipschitz approximating competitors with the end point constraint z 1 1 we illustrate here the construction of the almost bet ter lipschitz competitor y y that is carried on in the proof of theorem 3 2 for the problem with final constraint z 1 1 we assume for simplicity that y is strictly increasing as is the case of y s 1 1 s let be big enough and let t 0 1 is such that y t following step ix of the proof of theorem 3 2 the change of variable 0 1 r is defined by 1 1 for a e 0 1 y if t 1 1 otherwise therefore we have 1 y 1 if t 1 t t otherwise with t 1 y t 1 notice that 0 t t 0 since 1 on t 1 let 0 1 be such that 0 namely t t the inverse of restricted to 0 1 is thus defined by s y 1 1 1 s if s t 1 s t t if s 0 t then 0 1 1 the function y y is thus defined

of the proof of theorem 3 2 in order to build a lipschitz sequence y with prescribed initial datum y 0 0 we will then study the sequence f y fix 2 following step ix we define 0 0 0 1 y if y 1 otherwise thus we obtain 0 1 1 3 if 0 0 1 3 3 2 0 1 3 0 if 0 1 avoidance of the gap 39 notice that as expected 1 1 0 1 3 0 1 1 3 2 1 3 1 3 1 the inverse of restricted to 0 1 is thus defined for all s

further developments and questions remark 6 1 1 the proof of theorem 3 2 relies on the fact that for some y 1 t t 0 and p s z v r s z rv r 1 inf s i z y i v s z v dom dist s z v dom c p s z v 6 1 and

in view of lemma 4 1 hypotheses bwy and b y provide a sufficient condition for the validity of 6 1 6 2 can they be weakened 2 following the proof of 23 theorem 5 1 it appears that the conclusion of theorem 3 2 is still valid by replacing the radial convexity condition ac on the last variable of with the existence at any point s z v dom of the partial derivative dv s z v of with respect to v in this case one has to replace the selection p s z v of r s z rv r 1 with l s z v dv s z v which equals l s z v v v s z v if v 7 s z v is of class c 1 in this framework however 6 1 6 2 do not follow for free as in the convex case one has to add some further regularity conditions on w r t the last variable e g that v 7 s z v is uniformly lipschitz for s z v in bounded sets that are well inside the domain see 23 propo sition 4 17 are there some other sufficient conditions other than radial convexity or differentiability that guarantee the validity of condition mtb in some suitable form 3 the conclusions of the paper may be easily extended to lagrangians of the form m i 1 i s z v i s z assuming that each pair i i satisfies the assumptions for and as in 23 for optimal control problems with controlled linear dynamics of the form z b z v under some suitable as sumption on the function b the non occurrence of the gap at an admissible pair y u means here that the energy at y u may be
