non occurrence of gap for one dimensional non autonomous functionals carlo mariconda january 19 2022 keywords regularity lipschitz minimizing sequence approximation abstract let f y t t l s y s y s ds be a positive functional unneces sarily autonomous defined on the space w 1 p t t rn p 1 of sobolev functions possibly with prescribed one or two end point conditions it is important especially for the applications to be able to approximate the in fimum of f with the values of f along a sequence of lipschitz functions satisfying the same boundary condition s sometimes this is not possible i e the so called lavrentiev phenomenon occurs this is the case of the innocent like mania s lagrangian l s y y y 3 s 2 y 6 and bound ary data y 0 0 y 1 1 nevertheless in this situation the gap does not occur with just the end point condition y 1 1 the paper focuses about the different set of conditions needed to avoid the gap for problems with just one or with both end point conditions under minimal assumptions on the possibly extended valued lagrangian we ensure the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon with just one end point condition we intro duce an additional hypothesis satisfied when the lagrangian is bounded on bounded sets in order to ensure the validity of both end point conditions yh t y t yh t y t the result gives some new light even in the autonomous case carlo mariconda

dimensional vectorial functional of the calculus of varia tions f y t t l s y s y s ds defined on the space of sobolev functions w 1 p i rn on i t t with values in rn for some p 1 in the paper the lagrangian l s y u is borel and is assumed to have values in 0 following the terminology of con trol theory we will refer to s as to the time variable to y as to the state variable and to u as to the velocity variable the space of absolutely continuous functions provides the correct framework in order to find a minimizer of f tonelli s the orem ensures its existence for any given boundary data when l s is lower semicontinuous l has a superlinear growth and l s y is convex in order to approximate the value of the infimum of f e g by means of numerical methods one may be tempted to approximate in the space of absolutely continuous func tions a given minimizer y w 1 p i rn with a sequence of lipschitz functions yh h sharing the same boundary data of y in such a way that lim h f yh f y it turns out however that this may not be possible we say that in this case that the lavrentiev phenomenon occurs this is the case for instance for the innocent looking mania s 18 problem minf y 1 0 y 3 s 2 y 6 ds y w 1 1 i y 0 0 y 1 1 described in example 2 3 clearly the minimum is obtained for y s s 1 3 however it can be shown that there is 0 such that f z whenever z 0 1 r is lipschitz and z 0 y 0 0 z 1 y 1 1 as it is pointed out in 5 it is interesting to note that things change drastically if one allows the approximating sequence to have a different initial datum indeed the sequence yh s 1 h 1 3 if s 0 1 h t 1 3 otherwise converges to y and f yh f y another celebrated example due to ball and mizel is provided with a polynomial lagrangian in s y u that satisfies tonelli s existence conditions non occurrence of gap 3 when a minimizer exists a way to exclude the lavrentiev phenomenon is to provide conditions that ensure the lipschitz continuity of the minimizer itself in the autonomous case it turns out starting from the work 13 of clarke and vin ter up to its refinement by dal maso and frankowska 14 that the hypotheses of tonelli s existence theorem even without convexity provide lipschitzianity of the minimizers actually weaker growth conditions than superlinearity ensure both existence and lipschitzianity we refer to the pioneer work 12 of f clarke and to the subsequent papers of cellina and his school see 9 7 20 in the non autonomous case there are functionals satisfying tonelli s condition whose min imizers are not lipschitz or worse that exhibit the lavrentiev phenomenon con dition s an additional local lipschitz continuity assumption on the first time variable of thus always satisfied in the autonomous case formulated in 2 5 is enough to ensure lipschitzianity this fact was established by clarke in 12 and generalized by bettiol and mariconda in 3 property s is known to be a sufficient condition for the validity of the du bois reymond equation we refer to 10 for the smooth case to 12 for the nonsmooth convex case under weak growth assumptions to 2 3 by bettiol and the author in the general case many functionals arising from applications do not fulfill however known ex istence criteria and the previous regularity approach may thus not be pursued in this case looking for the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon is even more challenging and interesting this is easy if one requires some nat ural growth assumptions from above and continuous lagrangians our interest is therefore devoted to lagrangians that possibly violate these assumption here again the autonomous case stands on its own alberti and serra cassano in 1 theorem 2 4 state that if l s y u y u is just borel and satisfies k 0 0 0 is bounded on bk b 0 b then given y w 1 p i rn such that y y l 1 i rn there is a sequence yh h of lipschitz functions converging to y inw 1 p i rn and such that i yh i y and yh t y t for all h we say in this case that there is no lavrentiev gap at y here and below br denotes the closed ball of center the origin and radius r in rn for the initial prescribed datum the violation of assumption b may lead to the occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon as shown in example 3 5 though 1 remark 2 8 conjectures that the result does still hold for the vari ational problem with both end point conditions the proof of 1 theorem 2 4 actually holds for just one end point condition example 3 4 alberti personal communication shows that this is not just a technical issue the importance of the boundary datum and the difficulty of preserving it was noticed exploring the non occurrence of gap 4 recent literature also in the multidimensional case by bousquet treu and mari conda in 4 21 22 in the non autonomous case the examples see mania s show that some addi tional conditions have to be added to the author s knowledge starting from lavrentiev himself in 15 most of the criteria for the avoidance of the lavrentiev phenomenon require that is locally lipschitz or ho lder continuous in the state variable see 16 23 24 as was pointed out by carlson in 6 many of them can actually be obtained as a consequence of a property introduced by l cesari and t s angell in 11 there are however few exceptions the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon was established for two end point conditions without the above regularity hypotheses on the state variable by cellina ferriero and marchini in 8 for a class of real valued lagrangians of the form l s y u y u s y assuming the continuity of y u s y m 0 thus excluding mania s lagrangian and the convexity of u 7 y u notice that the lagrangian in mania s example is the product of y u u 6 with s y y s 3 2 but takes the value 0 along the minimizer mariconda in 19 for a general class of lagrangians s y u assuming the local lipschitz condition s on the time variable s radial convexity in the ve locity variable and a linear growth from below in the velocity variable it is important to notice that condition s for is not an option the lack of its va lidity may lead to the lavrentiev phenomenon as in ball mizel example in the extended valued case it is assumed moreover that tends with some uni formity to as the distance to the boundary of the effective domain dom i e the set where is finite tends to 0 as in 1 the lack of regularity of the lagrangian is compensated by some local boundedness condition includ ing b the main results these were the main motivations for this paper 1 is it true as suggested by 1 remark 2 8 that the lavrentiev phenomenon for the two end point conditions problem does not occur in the case of a real valued autonomous lagrangian that is bounded on bounded sets 2 find a set of assumptions possibly smaller than those presented in 19 or non occurrence of gap 5 8 that guarantee even in the autonomous case the non occurrence of the phenomenon for the two end points conditions problem 3 find sufficient conditions for the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phe nomenon with just one end point condition for non autonomous lagrangians the main results give actually some light on the problems and apply to the wider class of lagrangians of the form l s y u s y u s y 0 1 1 with different sets of hypotheses for and for all of the results in the pa per assume condition s just on s 7 s y u and the continuity of y 7 s y notice that this class il strictly larger than the one of functions of the form l s y u s y u satisfying s for instance l s y u s y u s y with s 0 1 y u r s y u u 2 s y s does not satisfy s but does in section 3 extend the result of alberti serra cassano 1 theorem 2 4 to the wider class of lagrangians 1 1 for the varia tional problem with just one end point constraint min f y y w 1 p i rn y t x rn px corollary 3 6 shows the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon once other than condition b obviously adapted to the non autonomous case satis fies condition s regarding it is enough that for all k 0 b is bounded on i bk c z is continuous for every z bk p inf 0 the above gives an answer to question 3 concerning question 2 we show that give y w 1 p i rn such that f y there is no lavrentiev gap for the two end point conditions problem once one assumes moreover that uy there is an open subset uy of y i such that for all r 0 is bounded on i uy br non occurrence of gap 6 hypothesis uy was conjectured by alberti in a personal communication for the autonomous case as shown in example 3 4 its lack may lead to a gap notice that hypothesis uy subsumes the fact that is real valued on an infinite strip thus in order to be satisfied for any admissible trajectory y we require in corollary 3 6 that is bounded on bounded sets and thus a fortiori that is not extended valued this gives in any case a reassuring positive answer to question 1 confirming the statement in 1 remark 2 8 when 1 the conclusions of theorem 3 1 and corollary 3 6 do not overlap with those obtained in 19 corollary 6 7 for the same kind of lagrangians some extra hypotheses assumed there e g the radial convexity assumption on 0 r 7 s z rv reveals to be more suitable for extended valued lagrangians and allow to deal with state constraints out or reach with the methods of the present paper a word on the proof the proof of theorem 3 1 follows the path of that of 1 theorem 2 4 given y w 1 p i rn such that f y we build a sequence yh h of lipschitz functions satisfying the required boundary conditions state constraints and 1 lim h f yh f y 2 yh y in w 1 p i rn we begin by considering a standard approximating sequence zh h of lipschitz functions such that z h y everywhere except at most an open subset ah whose measure tends to 0 as m we then reparametrize each zh i e we set yh zh h for a suitable lipschitz injective function h i i a delicate point here is that in general b and the assumptions for alone do not ensure that h i i this is the point where for the two end point conditions problem hypothesis uy plays a role allowing to build a suitable change of variables h satisfying h t t and h t in such a way that yh zh h fulfills the required properties non occurrence of gap 7 2 notation and basic assumptions 2 1 basic assumptions let p 1 the functional f sometimes referred as to the energy is defined by y w 1 p i rn f y i l s y s y s ds where l s y v is of the form l s y v s y v s y basic assumptions we assume the following conditions i t t is a closed bounded interval of r i rn rn 0 s y u 7 s y u n 1 is borel measurable i rn 0 is borel the effective domain of given by dom s y u i rn rn s y u is of the form dom i d with d rn rn 2 2 notation we introduce the main recurring notation the euclidean norm of x rn is denoted by x the lebesgue measure of a subset a of i t t is a no confusion may occur with the euclidean norm if y i rn we denote by y i its image by y its sup norm and by y p its norm in lp i rn the complement of a set a in rn is denoted by ac the characteristic function of a set a is a if x r we denote by x its positive part by x its negative part non occurrence of gap 8 lip i rn y i rn y lipschitz if n 1 we simply write lip i for p 1 w 1 p i rn y i rn y y lp i rn if n 1 we simply write w 1 p i 2 3 two variational problems we shall consider different variational problems associated to the functional f with different end point conditions and or state constraints let x y rn we define x y w 1 p i rn y t x and the corresponding variational problem minimize f y y x px whenever inf px x y y w 1 p i rn y t x y t y and the corresponding variational problem minimize f y y x y px y whenever inf px y there is no privilege in considering the initial condition y t x instead of the final one y t y for the one end point conditions problem any result obtained here can be reformulated for a final end point condition variational problem with the same set of assumptions 2 4 lavrentiev gap at a function and lavrentiev phenomenon in this paper we consider different boundary data for the same integral functional definition 2 1 lavrentiev gap at y w 1 p i rn let y w 1 p i rn be such that f y and let x x y we say that the lavrentiev gap does not occur at y for the variational problem corresponding to if there exists a sequence yh h n of functions in lip i r n satisfying 1 h n yh non occurrence of gap 9 2 lim sup h f yh f y 3 yh y in w 1 p i rn we say that the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for the variational prob lem corresponding to if inf y w 1 p i rn y f y inf y lip i rn y f y remark 2 2 gap and phenomenon let y w 1 p i rn the non occurrence of the phenomenon at y en sures that given 0 there is a lipschitz function y satisfying the same boundary data and or constraints such that f y f y if l s y is convex for all s y i rn and l s is lower semicontinuous the non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap at y implies the convergence of yh h to y in energy i e lim h f yh f y indeed in that case f is weakly lower semicontinuous of course the non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap along a minimizing sequence implies the non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for the same variational problem the following celebrated example motivates the need to distinguish problems with just one end point condition from problems with both end points conditions example 2 3 mania s example 18 consider the problem of minimizing f y 1 0 y 3 s 2 y 6 ds y w 1 1 i y 0 0 y 1 1 p 0 1 then y s s 1 3 is a minimizer and f y 0 not only y is not lipschitz it turns out see 5 4 3 that the lavrentiev phenomenon occurs i e 0 minf f y inf f y y lip 0 1 y 0 0 y 1 1 however as it is noticed in 5 the situation changes drastically if one allows to vary the initial boundary condition along the sequence yh h indeed it turns non occurrence of gap 10 out that the sequence yh h where each yh is obtained by truncating y at 1 h h n 1 as follows yh s 1 h 1 3 if s 0 1 h s 1 3 otherwise is a sequence of lipschitz functions satisfying 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 figure 1 the function yh yh 1 y 1 1 f yh f y yh y in w 1 1 0 1 therefore no lavrentiev phenomenon occurs for the variational problem minf y 1 0 y 3 s 2 y 6 ds y w 1 1 i y 1 1 2 5 condition s we consider the following local lipschitz condition s on the first variable of condition s for every k 0 of rn there are 0 l 1 t t 0 satisfying for a e s i s 2 z v s 1 z v s z v v p s s 2 s 1 whenever s 1 s 2 s s i z bk v rn s z v dom non occurrence of gap 11 remark 2 4 condition s is fulfilled if y u is autonomous in the smooth setting condition s ensures the validity of the erdmann du bois reymond edbr condition in this more general framework it plays a key role in lipschitz regularity under slow growth conditions 12 3 19 and ensures the validity of the edbr for real valued lagrangians 2 3 2 6 a useful option linear growth from below for the following additional linear growth from below on is not assumed in the main results however its validity allows to weaken some of the hypotheses of corollary 3 6 below there are 0 and d 0 satisfying for a e s 0 t and every z rn v rn s z v v d g lemma 2 5 let y w 1 p i rn be such that f y assume that fulfills g and that the infimum of along the graph of y is strictly positive i e py there is my 0 such that s z my for all s i z y i then y 1 f y my d t t my proof from p and g we obtain f y t t s y s y s s y s ds my t t s y s y s ds my t t y s ds my d t t proving that t t y s ds f y my d t t my non occurrence of gap 12 3 non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap phenomenon for px and for px y let x rn we consider here problems px px y 3 1 nonoccurrence of the lavrentiev gap theorem 3 1 below extends 1 theorem 2 4 to nonautonomous lagrangians indeed if s y u y u then condition s is fulfilled theorem 3 1 non occurrence of the lavrentiev gap for px and for px y at y w 1 p i rn assume that satisfies condition s and let y w 1 p t t rn be such that s y s y s s y s l 1 t t moreover suppose that there is a neighbourhood oy of y i in rn such that by is bounded on i oy cy z is continuous for all z y i by there is 0 0 such that is bounded on i oy b 0 moreover assume that s y y l 1 i then 1 there is no lavrentiev gap for px at y 2 assuming moreover that uy there is an open subset uy of y i such that for all r 0 is bounded on i uy br then there is no lavrentiev gap for px y at y remark 3 2 notice that in theorem 3 1 the integrability of s y y is satisfied if for instance satisfies condition py formulated in lemma 2 5 indeed if my on i y i then t t s y s y s ds 1 my f y non occurrence of gap 13 mania example 2 3 shows that the integrability of s y y is not a techni cal matter for the problem with two and as shown below even one end point condition example 3 3 consider mania s example 2 3 the lagrangian may be written as l s y u y 3 s 2 u 6 u s y s y y 3 s 2 u u 6 consider the minimizer y s s 1 3 all of the assumptions of theorem 3 1 are satisfied except the integrability of y notice also that vanishes along s y s see remark 3 2 as a matter of fact the lavrentiev gap occurs at y for the variational problem with just initial prescribed datum minf z 1 0 z 3 s 2 z 6 ds z 0 0 indeed if yh is a sequence of lipschitz functions that converges to y in w 1 1 then yh 1 is definitely in any given neighborhood of y 1 1 say in 3 4 3 2 the arguments of 5 4 3 show that there is 0 such that f yh for h big enough 3 2 examples the next examples concern the autonomous case i e z v and 1 example 3 4 below shows that hypothesis uy is essential for the validity of claim 2 in theorem 3 1 when is extended valued it is a slight modification of an example by g alberti personal communication example 3 4 occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon in an autonomous con vex and l s c problem with both endpoint constraints let y w 1 1 0 1 r be such that y is of class c 1 in 0 1 y 0 0 y 1 1 y 0 on 0 1 y 1 lim s 1 y s such a function exists e g y s 1 1 s s 0 1 for every z 0 1 set q z y y 1 z let for s y v 0 1 r r s z v 0 if z 0 1 and v q z or z 0 1 otherwise 1 non occurrence of gap 14 and set f z 1 0 s z s z s ds for every z w 1 1 0 1 r clearly 0 5 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 0 5 10 15 y u figure 2 the domain of s in example 3 4 f y minf 0 notice that is autonomous is lower semicontinuous on r 2 and s z is convex for all z r is bounded on r r y 0 y 0 takes the value on every set of the form 0 1 a b r thus satisfy all the assumptions of claim 1 in theorem 3 1 in particular there is no lavrentiev gap at y and thus phenomenon for the problem with just one end point condition either y 0 0 or y 1 1 however condition uy is not fulfilled claim f z for every lipschitz z 0 1 r satisfying z 0 0 z 1 1 indeed assume the contrary let z be such a function and suppose f z non occurrence of gap 15 let 0 t 1 t 2 1 be such that z t 1 0 z t 2 1 and z t 1 t 2 0 1 since f z then z s q z s a e on t 1 t 2 3 1 notice that since lim s 1 q z s and z is bounded then necessarily 3 1 is strict on a non negligible set it follows that t 2 t 1 z s q z s ds t 2 t 1 ds t 2 t 1 1 however the change of variable z s which is justified for instance by the chain rule 17 theorem 1 74 gives t 2 t 1 z s q z s ds 1 0 1 q d 1 0 1 y y 1 d y 1 1 0 y y d 1 a contradiction proving the claim the violation of condition by in theorem 3 1 may cause the occurrence of the phenomenon even for one point constraint problems example 3 5 occurrence of the phenomenon in autonomous scalar problems with one endpoint constraint let y and q be as in example 3 4 assume moreover that y c 2 and y 0 on 0 1 define for s z v 0 1 r r s z v 0 if z i 0 1 and v q z otherwise and set f z 1 0 s z s z s ds for every z w 1 1 0 1 r notice that is autonomous lower semicontinuous and s z is convex for every z r the lagrangian here is of the form s z z s z with 1 clearly satisfies the required assumptions of theorem 3 1 and inf 0 whereas takes non occurrence of gap 16 0 5 0 5 1 0 1 5 y u figure 3 the domain of in example 3 5 the on every rectangle i y i b 0 and thus violates by in theorem 3 1 claim the lavrentiev phenomenon occurs for f with the end point condition z 1 1 clearly s y y 0 a e in 0 1 so that f y minf 0 however f z for every lipschitz function z satisfying z 1 1 indeed let z be a lipschitz function on 0 1 satisfying z 1 1 letm 0 be such that z m a e on 0 1 and t 0 1 be such that y t m since y t 1 z 1 there is by continuity 0 such that s 1 1 y t z s then s z s z s on 1 1 indeed if s 1 1 the mono tonicity of y implies z s m y t y y 1 z s q z s whence z s z s it follows that f z 3 3 nonoccurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon we immediately obtain a sufficient condition for the non occurrence of the lavren tiev gap the hypotheses of corollary 3 6 ensure that the conditions of theo rem 3 1 are satisfied for every y w 1 p i rn with f y non occurrence of gap 17 corollary 3 6 non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for px as sume the validity of the basic assumptions and moreover that for all k 0 b is bounded on i bk c z is continuous for every z bk p there is mk 0 such that s z mk for all s i z bk b there is 0 0 such that is bounded on i bk b 0 then 1 the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for px 2 if is real valued and u for all r 0 is bounded on i bk br then the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for px y 3 if in addition to the assumptions fulfills g and inf m 0 the conclusions of claims 1 2 hold whenever hypotheses b c b are satisfied for just one value of k k 0 where k 0 x inf px m d t t m 3 2 proof 1 let yh h be a minimizing sequence for px such that h n f yh inf px 1 h 1 fix h n and choose k kh 0 in such a way that bkh contains a neighbor hood of yh i the validity of hypotheses b b c implies that of byh byh cyh with oh bkh and that of pyh by applying theorem 3 1 we obtain the existence of yh lip i rn satisfying the boundary condition yh t x and f yh f yh 1 h 1 inf px 2 h 1 non occurrence of gap 18 the claim follows 2 consider a minimizing sequence yh for px y such that h n f yh inf px y 1 h 1 notice that for each h n the validity of hypothesis u implies that of uyh we proceed as in claim 1 3 if p and g hold from lemma 2 5 we may assume in the proof of claims 1 and 2 that yh x yh 1 x f yh m d t t m x inf px 1 h 1 m d t t m k once h h 0 with 1 h 0 1 m k k 0 we can thus take for all h h 0 kh k in remaining part of the proof the conclusion follows remark 3 7 here are some comments concerning the assumptions of theo rem 3 1 and corollary 3 6 hypothesis b is required in 1 theorem 2 4 for autonomous lagrangians of the form l s y u y u the validity of b resp of c for every k 0 is of course equivalent to the fact that is bounded on bounded sets resp that z is continu ous for every z rn claim 3 of corollary 3 6 explains the choice of the apparently naive formulation of the assumptions the validity of b for every k 0 implies that is bounded in i rn 0 as shown in corollary 3 6 this inconvenient is encompassed if satisfies g hypothesis uy implies that the effective domain of contains the un bounded strip i uy rn hypothesis u forces to be real valued or if g holds at least real valued on i bk 0 rn where k 0 is given by 3 2 non occurrence of gap 19 in the real valued continuous case many of the assumptions of corollary 3 6 are satisfied whenever si bounded on bounded sets corollary 3 8 non occurrence of the lavrentiev phenomenon for px real valued case assume the validity of the basic assumptions and moreover that is real valued bounded on bounded sets and that is continuous and strictly positive then the lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur for px y 4 proof of theorem 3 1 lemma 4 1 is a slight modification of 1 lemma 2 6 lemma 4 1 let gh h be a sequence of functions in l 1 i 0 converging to g l 1 i a e in i and eh h be a sequence of measurable subsets of i such that i eh 0 then eh gh ds i g ds proof possibly passing to a subsequence we may assume that the characteristic functions of eh converge to 1 a e in i fatou s lemma then yields lim inf h eh gh ds i g ds moreover since gh 0 andeh i for every h we have that eh gh ds i gh ds and fatou s lemma gives lim sup h eh gh ds lim sup h i gh ds i g ds which concludes the proof proof of theorem 3 1 proof of claim 1 the first steps of the proof follow the path of the proof of 1 theorem 2 4 which are recalled and adapted to the more general lagrangian considered here i it follows from assumptions by and by that there are m 0 0 and a neighbourhood oy of y i such that s z u m s z m whenever z oy u 0 4 1 non occurrence of gap 20 ii for every h n there are a lipschitz function zh i rn

measure more precisely satisfying h 2 ah z h s 0 1 1 ds for each h big enough define h as follows h t t h 1 in i ah h z h 0 1 in ah 1 2 in h v from iv we now have t t h s ds i ah h ah z h s 0 1 ds h 2 i ah h h 2 ah h 2 i thus h i i is bijective non occurrence of gap 24 vii let h be the inverse of h define yh zh h then yh is lipschitz yh t y t and y h z h h h y h in i h ah h 0 z h h z h h z h h in h ah 2 z h h 2 y h in h h as in claim 1 it turns out that yh h converges to y in w 1 p i rn indeed it follows from the proof of claim 1 that i h h y h y p ds 0 it remains to prove that y h y lp h h 0 since y on h we have h y h y p ds 2 p h y h p ds 2 p h y s p ds 2 p h 2 p y h p ds 2 p h y s p ds 22 p p h 2 p h y s p ds 0 since h is absolutely continuous and h h 0 proving the claim we may thus assume as in the proof of claim 1 that yh i oy for every h big enough viii it remains to show that f yh h converges to f y as h we write f yh i h ah h ds p 1 h h ah ds p 2 h h h ds p 3 h where here stands for s yh y h s yh as in the proof of claim 1 we get p 1 h f y p 2 h 0 non occurrence of gap 25 it remains to prove that p 3 h 0 since h 1 2 on h the change of variables s gives p 3 h h h s yh y h s yh ds h h s y h y h h s y h ds 1 2 h h y 2 y h y d now for a e on h y uy and 2 y 2 hypotheses uy and by imply that h y 2 y h y is bounded on h the conclusion follows remark 4 2 notice that in the proof of claim 1 of theorem 3 1 every element of the sequence zh h satisfies the boundary conditions zh t y t zh t y t however since h 1 on t t it may happen that h t t and this yields h t t as a consequence yh t zh h t may differ from zh t y t in presence of a final end point condition of the form y t y instead of a initial one the proof goes as above replacing the definition of the change of variables h by h t t h 1 in i ah z h 0 1 in ah acknowledgments i warmly thank giovanni alberti for the mail exchange we had during the prepara tion of the paper and for providing the construction of
