introduction the present paper is devoted to degenerate electron plasma behaviour research analysis of processes taking place in plasma under effect of ex ternal electric field plasma waves oscillations with various types of condi tions of electron reflection from the boundary has important significance today in connection with problems of such intensively developing fields as microelectronics and nanotechnologies 1 6 1 natafmf yandex ru 2 avlatyshev mail ru 3 yushkanov inbox ru http arxiv org abs 1103 2549 v 1 2 the concept of plasma appeared in the works of tonks and langmuir for the first time see 7 9 the concept of plasma frequency was introduced in the same works and first questions of plasma oscillations were considered there however in these works equation for the electric field was considered separately from the kinetic equation a a vlasov 10 for the first time introduced the concept of self consistent electric field and added the corresponding item to the kinetic equation now equations describing plasma behaviour consist of anchor system of equations of maxwell and boltzmann the problem of electron plasma oscillations was considered by a a vlasov 10 by means of solution of the kinetic equation which included self consistent electric field l d landau 11 had supposed that outside of the half space contain ing degenerate plasma external electromagnetic field causing oscillations in plasma is situated by this landau has formulated a boundary condi tion on the plasma boundary after that the problem of plasma oscillation turns out to be formulated correctly as a boundary problem of mathemat ical physics in 11 l d landau has solved analytically by fourier series the prob lem of collisionless plasma behaviour in a half space situated in external longitudinal perpendicular to the surface electric field in conditions of specular reflection of electrons from the boundary further the problem of electron plasma oscillations was considered by many authors full analytical solution of the problem is given in the works 12 and 13 this problem has important significance in the theory of plasma see for instance 2 14 and the references in these works and also 15 16 the problem of plasma oscillations with diffuse boundary condition was considered in the works 17 18 by method of integral transformations in the works 19 20 general asymptotic analysis of electric field behaviour at the large distance from the surface was carried out in the work 19 particular significance of plasma behaviour analysis close to plasma reso nance was shown and in the same work 19 it was stated that plasma 3 behaviour in this case for conditions of specular and diffuse electron scat tering on the surface differs substantially in the works 21 and 22 general questions of this problem solvability were considered but diffuse boundary conditions were taken into account in the work 22 structure of discrete spectrum in dependence of parameters of the problem was analyzed the detailed analysis of the solution in general case in the works mentioned above hasn t been carried out conside ring the complex character of this solution the present work is a continuation of electron plasma behaviour in external longitudinal alternating electric field research 21 26 in the present paper the linearized problem of half space plasma oscil lations in external alternating electric field is solved analytically specu lar accommodative boundary conditions for electron reflection from the boundary are considered in 24 26 diffuse boundary conditions were considered the coefficients of continuous and discrete spectra of the problem are obtained in the present work which allows us to derive expressions for electron distribution function at the boundary of conductive medium and electric field in explicit form to reveal the dependence of this expressions on normal momentum accommodation coefficient and to show that in the case when normal electron momentum accommodation coefficient equals to zero electron distribution function and electric field are expressed by known formulas obtained earlier in 12 13 the present work is a continuation of our work 27 in which questions of plasma waves reflection from the plane boundary bounding degenerate plasma were considered let us note that questions of plasma oscillations are also considered in nonlinear statement see for instance the work 28 29 2 problem statement let degenerate plasma occupy a half space x 0 we take system of equations describing plasma behaviour as a kinetic

the fermi surface which is supposed to be spherical we assume that external electric field outside the plasma is perpendi cular to the plasma boundary and changes according to the following law e 0 exp i t 5 then one can consider that self consistent electric field e r t inside plasma has one x component and changes only lengthwise the axis x e ex x t 0 0 under this configuration the electric field is perpendicular to the boun dary of plasma which is situated in the plane x 0 we will linearize the local equilibrium fermi dirac distribution feq in regard to the undisturbed distribution f 0

the linearization of the equations 1 1 1 3 with the help of 1 4 we obtain the following system of equations f 1 t vx f 1 x f 1 x v t ef e eex x t vx ef x t ef 1 5 ex x t x 8 e 2 3 f 1 x v t d 3 p 1 6 from the law of preservation of number of particles feqd f fd f we find ef x t ef ef e d 3 p f 1 d 3 p 1 7 from the equation 1 5 it is seen that we should search for the function f 1 in the form proportional to the delta function f 1 ef ef e h x t vx v 1 8 6 the system of equations 1 5 and 1 6 with the help of 1 7 and 1 8 can be transformed to the following form h t vf h x h x t evf ef ex x t 2 1 1 h x t d ex x t x 16 2 eefm 2 vf 2 3 1 1 h x t d further we introduce dimensionless function e x t evf ef ex x t and pass to dimensionless coordinate x 1 x l where l vf is the mean free path of electrons and we introduce dimensionless time t 1 t we obtain the following system of equations h t 1 h x 1 h x 1 t 1 e x 1 t 1 1 2 1 1 h x 1 t 1 d 1 9 e x 1 t 1 x 1 3 2 p 2 2 1 1 h x 1 t 1 d 1 10 here p is the electron langmuir frequency of plasma oscillations 2 p 4 e 2 n m n is the numerical density concentration m is the electron mass we used the following well known relation for degenerate plasma for the derivation of the equations 1 9 and 1 10 vfm 3 3 2 n let k to be a dimensional wave number and let us introduce dimension less wave number k 1 k vf p then kx k 1 x 1 where p we introduce the quantity 1 7 3 boundary conditions statement let us outline the time variable of the functionsh x 1 t 1 and e x 1 t 1 assuming h x 1 t 1 e i 1 t 1 h x 1 2 1 e x 1 t 1 e i 1 t 1 e x 1 2 2 the system of equations 1 9 and 1 10 in this case will be transformed to the following form h x 1 1 i 1 h x 1 e x 1 1 2 1 1 h x 1 d 2 3 de x 1 dx 1 3 2 p 2 2 1 1 h x 1 d 2 4 further instead of x 1 t 1 we write x t we rewrite the system of equations 2 3 and 2 4 in the form h x z 0 h x e x 1 2 1 1 h x d 2 5 de x dx 3 2 2 1 1 h x d 2 6 here z 0 1 i 1 1 1 i we consider the external electric field outside the plasma is perpendi cular to the plasma boundary and changes according to the following law e 0 exp i t this means that for the field inside plasma on the plasma boundary the following condition is satisfied e 0 e 0 2 7 8 the non flowing condition for the particle electric current flow through the plasma boundary means that 1 1 h 0 d 0 2 8 in the kinetic theory for the description of the surface properties the accommodation coefficients are used often tangential momentum and energy accommodation coefficients are the most used for the problem considered the normal electron momentum accommodation under the scat tering on the surface has the most important significance the normal momentum accommodation coefficient is defined by the following relation p pi pr pi ps 0 6 p 6 1 2 9 where pi and pr are the flows of normal to the surface momentum of incoming to the boundary and reflected from it electrons pi 0 1 2 h 0 d 2 10 pr 1 0 2 h 0 d 2 11 quantity ps is the normal momentum flow for electrons reflected from the surface which are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the wall ps 1 0 2 hs d 2 12 where the function hs as 0 1 is the equilibrium distribution function of the corresponding electrons this function is to satisfy the condition similar to the non flowing condition 0 1 h 0 d 1 0 hs d 0 2 13 9 we are going to consider the relation between the normal momentum accommodation coefficient p and the diffuseness coefficient q for the case of specular and diffuse boundary conditions which are written in the follo wing form h 0 1 q h 0 as 0 1 2 14 here q is the diffuseness coefficient 0 6 q 6 1 as is the quantity determined from the non flowing condition from the non flowing condition we derive 1 1 h 0 d 0 1 h 0 d 1 0 h 0 d 0 in the second integral we replace the integrand according to the right hand side of the specular diffuse boundary condition 2 14 after that using the obvious change of integration variable we obtain that as 2 q 0 1 h 0 d let us use the boundary condition 2 13 using the analogous to the preceded line of reasoning we get as 2 0 1 h 0 d from the two last equations we find that as qas 2 15 further we find the difference between two flows pi pr 0 1 2 h 0 d 1 0 2 h 0 d in the second integral we use the boundary condition 2 14 again with the help of 2 15 we obtain that pi pr q 0 1 2 h 0 d 1 0 2 asd 10 q 0 1 2 h 0 d q 1 0 2 asd qpi qps substituting the expressions obtained to the definition of the normal mo mentum accommodation coefficient we have p pi pr pi ps qpi qps pi ps q thus for specular diffuse boundary conditions normal momentum accommodation coefficient p coincides with the diffuseness coefficient q equally with the specular diffuse boundary conditions another vari ants of boundary conditions are used in kinetic theory as well in particular accommodation boundary conditions are used widely they are divided into two types diffuse accommodative and specular accommodative boundary conditions see 30 we consider specular accommodative boundary conditions for the function h this conditions will be written in the following form h 0 h 0 a 0 a 1 0 1 2 16 if in 2 16 we assume a 0 a 1 0 then specular accommodative boundary conditions pass into pure specular boundary conditions coefficients a 1 and a 2 can be derived from the non flowing condition and the definition of the normal electron momentum accommodation coef ficient the problem statement is completed now the problem consists in find ing of such solution of the system of equations 2 5 and 2 6 which sat isfies the boundary conditions 2 7 2 13 further with the use of the solution of the problem it is required to built the profiles of the distribu tion function of the electrons moving to the plasma surface and profile of the electric field 4 the relation between flows and boundary conditions 11 first of all let us find expression which relates the constants a 0 a 1 from the boundary condition 2 16 to carry this out we will use the condition of non flowing 2 12 of the particle flow through the plasma boundary which we will write as a sum of two flows n 0 1 0 h 0 d 0 1 h 0 d 0 after evident substitution of the variable in the second integral we ob tain n 0 1 0 h 0 h 0 d 0 taking into account the relation 2 16 we obtain that a 0 2 3 a 1 with the help of this relation we can rewrite the condition 2 16 in the following form h 0 h 0 a 1 2 3 0 1 3 1 we consider the momentum flow of the electrons which are moving to the boundary according to 3 1 we have pi pr 1 36 a 1 3 2 it is easy to see further that ps as 3 3 3 with the help of the formulas 3 2 and 3 3 we will rewrite the definition of the accommodation coefficient 2 9 in the form ppr p as 3 a 1 36 1 p 0 3 4 let us consider the condition 2 13 we rewrite it in the following form as 2 0 1 h 0 d 0 12 from this condition we obtain as 2 0 1 h 0 d 2 1 0 h 0 d using the condition 3 1 we then get as 2 1 0 h 0 d 3 5 now with the help of the second equality from 2 16 and 3 5 we rewrite the relation 3 4 in the integral form p 1 0 2 2 3 h 0 d 1 36 1 p a 1 3 6 now the boundary problem consists of the equations 2 5 and 2 6 and boundary conditions 2 7 3 1 and 3 6 5 separation of variables and characteristic system application of the general fourier method of the separation of variables in several steps results in the following substitution 31 h x exp z 0 x 4 1 e x exp z 0 x e 4 2 where is the spectrum parameter or the parameter of separation which is complex in general we substitute the equalities 4 1 and 4 2 into the equations 2 5 and 2 6 we obtain the following characteristic system of equations z 0 e 2 1 1 d 4 3 13 e 3 2 z 0 2 1 1 d 4 4 let us introduce the designations p 1 1 21 2 z 0 3 c z 0 2 1 2 z 20 3 1 3 i 1 2 z 0 1 i 1 substituting the integral from the equation 4 4 into 4 3 we come to the following system of equations e z 0 21 4 5 21 e 2 1 1 d 4 6 here 21 2 3 i 1 3 solution of the system 4 5 and 4 6 depends essentially on the condi tion whether the spectrum parameter belongs to the interval 1 1 in connection with this the interval 1 1 we will call as continuous spectrum of the characteristic system let the parameter 1 1 then from the equations 4 5 and 4 6 in the class of general functions we will find eigenfunction corresponding to the continuous spectrum f e z 0 4 7 where f p 21 c 4 8 in the equation 4 8 x is the delta function of dirac the symbol px 1 means the principal value of the integral under integrating of the 14 expression x 1 the function z is called as dispersion function of the problem z 1 z c 1 1 21 z z d 4 9 functions 4 8 are called eigenfunction of the continuous spectrum since the spectrum parameter fills out the continuum 1 1 compactly the eigensolutions of the given problem can be found from the equalities 4 7 the dispersion function z we express in the terms of the case dis persion function 31 z 1 1 z 0 1 z 0 1 z 2 21 c z where c z 1 z 2 1 1 d z 1 2 1 1 d z is the case dispersion function 31 the boundary values of the dispersion function from above and below the cut interval 1 1 we define in the following way lim 0 0 i 1 1 the boundary values of the dispersion function from above and below the cut are calculated according to the sokhotzky formulas i 2 21 z 0 21 2 1 1 from where i 21 z 0 21 2 2 1 1 where 1 2 21 z 0 1 1 21 2 d 15 and the integral in this equality is understood as singular in terms of the principal value by cauchy besides that the function can be repre sented in the following form 1 1 z 0 1 z 0 1 2 21 c c 1 2 ln 1 1 6 eigenfunctions of the discrete spectrum according to the definition the discrete spectrum of the characteristic equation is a set of zeroes of the dispersion equation z z 0 5 1 we start to search zeroes of the equation 5 1 let us take laurent series of the dispersion function z 2 z 2 4 z 4 z 1 5 2 here 1 1 z 0 1 3 z 0 2 1 2 1 z 0 1 3 1 5 21 4 1 z 0 1 5 1 7 21 we express these parameters through the parameters and 2 i i 1 i 2 2 9 5 i 1 i 15 1 i 2 4 15 7 i 1 i 35 1 i 2 it is easy seen that the dispersion function 4 9 in collisional plasma i e when 0 in the infinity has the value which doesn t equal to zero 6 0 16 hence the dispersion equation has infinity as a zero i to which the discrete eigensolutions of the given system correspond h x z 0 e x 1 this solution is naturally called as mode of drude it describes the volume conductivity of metal considered by drude see for example 32 let us consider the question of the plasma mode existence in details we find finite complex zeroes of the dispersion function we use the principle of argument we take the contour see fig 1 r which is passed in the positive direction and which bounds the biconnected domain dr this contour consists of the circumference r z z r r 1 0 and the contour which includes the cut 1 1 and stands at the distance of from it let us note that the dispersion function has not any poles in the domain dr then according to the principle of argument the number 33 of zeroes n in the domain dr equals to n 1 2 i d ln z considering the limit in this equality when 0 and taking into ac count that the dispersion function is analytic in the neighbourhood of the infinity we obtain that n 1 2 i 1 1 d ln 1 2 i 1 1 d ln 1 2 i 1 1 d ln 17 x y r 1 dr r z 1 o 1 fig 1 18 so we obtained that n 1 2 i 1 1 d ln we divide this integral into two integrals by segments 1 0 and 0 1 in the first integral by the segment 1 0 we carry out replacement of variable taking into account that we obtain that n 1 2 i 1 1 d ln 1 i 1 0 d ln 1 arg 1 0 5 3 here under symbol argg arg we understand the regular branch of the argument fixed in zero with the condition argg 0 0 we consider the curve z z g 0 6 6 1 where g it is obvious that g 0 1 lim 1 g 1 consequently according to 5 3 the number of values n equals to doubled number of turns of the curve around the point of origin i e n 2 g where g ind 0 1 g is the index of the function g thus the number of zeroes of the dispersion function which are situated in complex plane outside of the segment 1 1 of the real axis equals 19 to doubled index of the function g calculated on the semi segment 0 1 let us single real and imaginary parts of the function g out at first we represent the function g in the form g z 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 is 2 1 2 z 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 is 2 1 2 where s 2 1 1 z 0 1 z 0 1 2 21 c and c 1 2 ln 1 1 is the dispersion function of case calculated on the cut i e in the interval 1 1 taking into account that z 0 1 i i 1 21 c 3 2 3 i 1 3 z 0 1 2 1 1 2 3 i 1 3 we obtain g p iq p iq where p 1 2 0 2 3 2 1 s q 1 1 0 s 2 3 2 now we can easily single real and imaginary parts of the function g out g g 1 g i g 2 g here g p 2 q 2 1 2 0 3 2 2 20 1 s 2 1 1 0 s 3 2 2 2 g 1 p p q q 1 2 0 3 2 2 2 2 1 2 s 2 1 0 2 3 2 2 2 s 2 g 2 p q p q 2 s 1 2 3 2 2 0 3 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 0 we consider see fig 2 the curve l which is defined in implicit form by the following parametric equations l g 1 0 g 2 0 0 1 and which lays in the plane of the parameters of the problem and when passing through this curve the index of the function g at the positive semi segment 0 1 changes stepwise from the equation g 2 0 we find 1 2 0 3 2 2 3 2 2 0 5 4 now from the equation g 1 0 with the help of 5 4 we find that l 2 5 5 where l 2 3 2 s 2 0 s 2 1 0 2 substituting 5 5 into 5 4 we obtain 1 l 1 5 6 where l 1 3 2 s 2 0 1 0 2 0 s 2 1 0 2 functions 5 5 and 5 6 determine the curve l which is the border if the domain d we designate the external area to the domain as d in 21 0 1 2 3 1 0 1 2 3 d d l l fig 2 explicit parametrical form see fig 2 as in the work 34 we can prove that if d then g ind 0 1 g 1 the curve l encircles the point of origin once and if d then g ind 0 1 g 0 the curve l doesn t encircle the point of origin we note that in the work 34 the method of analysis of boundary regime when l was developed from the expression 3 2 one can see that the number of zeroes of the dispersion function equals to two if d and equals to zero if d since the dispersion function is even its zeroes differ from each other by sign we designate these zeroes as following 0 by 0 we take the zero which satisfies the condition re 0 0 the following solution corresponds to the zero 0 h 0 x exp z 0 x 0 e 2 z 0 0 2 1 0 5 7 22 e 0 x exp z 0 x 0 e 2 5 8 from the equalities 5 7 and 5 8 it follows that the following solution corresponds to zero 0 h 0 x exp z 0 x 0 e 1 z 0 0 2 1 0 5 9 e 0 x exp z 0 x 0 e 1 5 10 this solution is naturally called as mode of debay this is plasma mode in the case of low frequencies it describes well known screening of debay 3 the external field penetrates into plasma on the depth of rd rd is the raduis of debay when the external field frequencies are close to langmuir frequencies the mode of debay describes plasma oscillations see for instance 3 32 7 expansion in the terms of eigen functions we will seek for the solution of the system of equations 2 5 and 2 6 with boundary conditions 3 1 3 6 and 2 7 in the form of linear combi nation of discrete eigen solutions of the characteristic system and integral taken over continuous spectrum of the system let us prove that the following theorem is true theorem 7 1 system of equations 2 5 and 2 6 with boundary con ditions 3 1 3 6 and 2 7 has a unique solution which can be presented as an expansion by eigen functions of the characteristic system h x e z 0 e 0 z 0 0 2 1 0 exp z 0 x 0 1 z 0 1 0 exp z 0 x f e d 6 1 e x e e 0 exp z 0 x 1 0 exp z 0 x e d 6 2 23 here e 0 and e is unknown coefficients corresponding to the discrete spectrum e 0 is the amplitude of debay e 1 is the amplitude of drude e is unknown function which is called as coefficient of discrete spect rum when d in expansions 6 1 and 6 2 we should take e 0 0 then from 6 1 and 6 2 we obtain h x e z 0 1 z 0 1 0 exp z 0 x f e d 6 1 e x e 1 0 exp z 0 x e d 6 2 further we will consider the following case d our purpose is to find the coefficient of the continuous spectrum coeffi cients of the discrete spectrum and to built expressions for electron distri bution function at the plasma surface and electric field proof we substitute the expression 6 1 into the boundary condition 3 1 we obtain the following equation in the interval 0 1 2 e z 0 e 0 z 0 0 1 z 0 1 0 f f e d a 1 2 3 6 3 where the following designation is introduced 0 21 0 0 21 0 0 extending the function e into the interval 1 0 evenly so that e e and extending the equation into the interval 1 1 un evenly we transform the equation 6 3 to the form 2 e z 0 e 0 z 0 0 1 z 0 1 1 f e d 24 a 1 2 3 sign 6 4 we substitute the eigen functions of the continuous spectrum into the equation 6 4 we obtain the singular integral equation with the cauchy kernel in the interval 1 1 2 e e 0 0 1 1 21 e d 2 21 z 0 e z 0 a 1 2 3 z 0 a 1 sign 6 5 8 solution of the singular equation we introduce the auxiliary function m z 1 1 z 21 z e d 7 1 the boundary values of which on the real axis above and below it are related by the sohotzky formulas m m 2 i 2 21 e 7 2 m m 2 m 1 1 7 3 where m 1 1 21 e d and the singular integral in this equality is understood as singular in the sense of principal value of cauchy with the help of the equalities 7 2 and 7 3 and the similar equalities for the dispersion and auxiliary functions we reduce the equation 6 5 to the boundary condition of the problem of determination of analytic function by its jump on the contour m 2 e e 0 0 z 0 a 1 25 m 2 e e 0 0 z 0 a 1 2 i 3 21 z 0 z 0 a 1 2 1 2 sign 1 1 this equation has general solution see 33 z m z e 0 z 2 e z 0 z 0 a 1 z 2 3 z 0 a 1 2 21 z 0 1 1 2 21 sign z d c 1 z where c 1 is an arbitrary constant let us introduce auxiliary function t z 1 2 21 z 0 1 1 2 21 sign z d then the general solution will be written in the form z m z e 0 0 z 2 e z

the infinity we get that c 1 2 e z 0 a 1 now we eliminate the poles of the solution 7 4 in the points 0 we single out items which contain polar singularity in the points z 0 in the right hand side of the solution 7 4 e 0 0 z 2 1 0 z c 1 z 2 3 z 0 a 1 t z z 26 and e 0 0 z 2 1 0 z c 1 z 2 3 z 0 a 1 t z z from the last two relations one can see that poles in the points z 0 can be eliminated by one equality since the functions which compose the general solution are uneven z 0 a 1 e 0 0 2 1 2 0 2 e 0 2 3 t 0 0 7 5 we find the coefficient of the continuous spectra from the sohotzky formula 7 2 e 1 2 i 2 21 m m 7 6 we substitute the expansion 6 1 for the function h x into the inte gral boundary condition 3 6 we derive the following equation 1 36 e e 0 m 0 1 0 m e d 1 36 z 0 a 1 1 p p 7 7 we introduced the following designations in 7 7 m 0 1 0 2 2 3 f 0 d and m 1 0 2 2 3 f d the difference between boundary values of the auxiliary function m z from the expression 7 6 can be found with the help of the general solution 7 4 e 1 2 i 2 21 2 3 z 0 a 1 t t 27 2 e z 0 a 1 1 1 7 8 let us note that when passing the positive part of the cut 0 1 the functions t z and z make jumps which differs from each other only by sign indeed let us represent the formula for t z in the following form t z 1 2 21 z 0 1 0 2 21 1 z 1 z d z 21 z 0 1 0 2 21 2 z 2 d or t z z 2 21 z 0 1 0 2 21 1 z 1 z d z 21 z 0

coefficient e 0 is determined according to 8 7 the coefficient of the con tinuous spectrum e is determined according to 8 8 the constant a 1 is determined from 8 9 finding of the coefficients of discrete and con tinuous spectra of the expansions 6 1 and 6 2 completes the proving of existence of this expansions uniqueness of the solution in the form of ex pansions 6 1 and 6 2 can be proved easily with the use of contraposition method 10 conclusion in the present work new boundary conditions for the questions of plasma oscillations in half space degenerate plasma were proposed these bound ary conditions are naturally called as specular accommodative conditions such boundary conditions are most adequate for the problems of normal propagation of plasma waves perpendicular to the boundary since ac commodation coefficient under such boundary conditions is normal elec tron momentum accommodation coefficient in the present paper the analytical solution of the problem of plasma os cillations in half space degenerate plasma with accommodation of electron normal momentum the coefficients of the discrete and continuous spectra of the problem are found in explicit form references 1
