brunel university london uk september 10 2021 abstract a non linear history dependent cohesive zone model of crack propagation in linear elastic and visco elastic materials is presented the viscoelasticity is described by a linear volterra integral operator in time the normal stress on the cohesive zone satisfies the history de pendent yield condition given by a non linear abel type integral operator the crack starts propagating breaking the cohesive zone when the crack tip opening reaches a prescribed crit ical value a numerical algorithm for computing the evolution of the crack and cohesive zone in time is discussed along with some numerical results keywords cohesive zone time dependent fracture abel integral equation viscoelasticity 1 introduction the cohesive zone cz in a material is the area between two separating but still sufficiently close surfaces ahead of the crack tip see the shaded region in fig 1 q c a 0 a c q figure 1 cohesive zone the cohesive forces at the cohesive zones pull the cz faces together while the external load applied to the body on the contrary causes the crack faces and cz faces to move further apart and layal hakim brunel ac uk sergey mikhailov brunel ac uk correponding author 1 http arxiv org abs 1403 3708 v 1 the crack to propagate when the crack propagates the cohesive forces vanish at the points where the opening reaches a critical value and these points become the crack surface points while the new material points where the history dependent normalised equivalent stress reaches a critical value join the cz so the cz is practically attached to the crack tip ahead of the crack and moves with the crack keeping the normalised equivalent stress finite in the body one of the most popular cz models for elasto perfectly plastic materials is the leonov panasyuk dugdale lpd model see 6 12 in the lpd model the maximal normal stress in the cohesive zones is constant and equals to the material yield stress y some gener alisations of this model to visco elastic materials have been developed in 8 section 6 2 3 an approximate solution for the lpd model for a linear visco elastic bulk material with constant y on the cohesive zone is presented paper 25 dealt with penny shaped crack in a linear visco elastic bulk material with the ideally rigid plasticity on the cohesive zone where the yield modulus depends on the cz tip stain history in 24 an energy approach was implemented to the cz model with constant stress on the cohesive failure zone in a non linear visco elastic bulk material while in 14 with an exponential dependence of the cz stress on the displacement jump in a linear visco elastic bulk material the cz models with non constant cz stress are sometimes associated with the barenblatt cz model 2 3 4 also described e g in 8 section 5 3 the three main components of the the lpd type cz models are i the constitutive equations in the bulk of the material ii the constitutive equations in the cz iii the criterion for the cz to break i e for the crack to propagate the model presented in this paper is an extension of the lpd model to linear visco elastic ma terials with non linear history dependent constitutive equations in the cz the history dependent cz models can be traced back to 25 but unlike that paper the history dependence in our paper is given by a recently developed normalised equivalent stress 21 based on the durability diagram of the material while the yield condition relates locally with the stress history of considered cz points instead of being approximated by the history at the cz tip only the crack starts propa gating when the crack tip opening reaches a critical value as in the classical lpd model our aim is to find the time evolution of the cz before the crack starts propagating the delay time otherwise known as initiation time after which the crack will start to propagate and to study the further time evolution of the crack and the cz some preliminary results on this model were published in 10 to obtain the solutions some numerical algorithms were implemented to solve the obtained nonlinear integro differential problem and the order of the solution convergence is analysed 2 problem formulation following 21 let us introduce at any material point the normalised history dependent equivalent stress t b 0 t 0 t b 1 d 1 0 t 0 t 1 d 1 1 where is the maximum of the principal stresses and t denotes time the parameters 0 0 and b 0 are material constants in the assumed power type relation t 0 b 2 between the rupture time t and the constant uniaxial tensile stress applied to a sample without cracks the parameter 0 is a material constant in the nonlinear accumulation rule for durability under variable load see 21 to simplify further formulas we also introduce the notation b as shown in 21 the accumulation rule based on 1 becomes equivalent to the robinson rule of linear summation of the partial life times when b i e 1 we will replace the classical lpd cz yield stress condition yield with the history dependent condition t 1 2 while in the rest the bulk of the material the strength non yield condition should be satisfied t 1 note that relations 1 2 were implemented in 20 and 9 to solve a similar crack propagation problem without cz i e it was assumed that when condition 2 is reached at a point this point becomes part of the crack however such approach appeared to be inapplicable for b 2 while for many structural materials this parameter is in the range between 5 and 15 in this paper a cz approach is developed instead in order to cover the larger range of b values relevant to structural materials in the cz approach when condition 2 is reached at a point this point becomes not yet part of the crack as in 20 and 9 but part of the cz to became part of the crack another condition on the cz opening should be satisfied as proved further in section 7 1 the cz defined by 1 2 can exist only if 0 1 i e 0 b note that in all examples considered in 21 where these parameters were calculated by fitting the creep durability experimental data it was found that 0 b i e 0 1 thus we will further consider from this interval only let the problem geometry be as in fig 1 i e the crack occupies the interval a t a t and the cz occupies the intervals c t a t and a t c t in an infinite linearly elastic or visco elastic plane loaded at infinity by a traction q in the direction normal to the crack which is constant in x applied at the time t 0 and kept constant in time thereafter the initial cz is absent i e the cz tip coordinates coincide with the crack tip coordinates which are prescribed c 0 a 0 a 0 while the functions c t and a t for time t 0 are to be found let x y be coordinates in the cartesian frame with the origin in the centre of the crack and the x axis directed along the crack assuming that x y y x 0 is non negative and is the maximal component of the stress tensor ahead of the crack the cz condition 2 1 at a point x on the cz at time t can be rewritten as t t c x x t 1 d 0 t c x 0 x t 1 d 3 for t t c x and a t x c t here t c x denotes the time when the point x joined the cz equation 3 is an inhomogeneous linear volterra integral equation of the abel type with unknown function x t for t t c x let us first consider the case of linear elastic constitutive equations for the bulk of the material applying the results by muskhelishvili see 22 section 120 we have for the stresses ahead of the cz in the elastic material x t x x 2 c 2 t q 2 c t a t c 2 t 2 x 2 2 t d 4 3 for x c t as one can see from 4 x t has generally a square root singularity as x tends to the cz tip c the stress intensity factor k at this singularity can be obtained by multiplying the stress in equation 4 by x c t and taking the limit as x tends to c t which yields k t c t 2 q 2 c t a t t c 2 t 2 d a sufficient condition for the normalised equivalent stress to have no such singularity at the cz tip is that the stress given by 4 does not have it either while the necessary condition for the latter is that the stress intensity factor k is zero there to simplify the equations we will employ the following normalisations t t t x x a 0 a t a t t a 0 c t c t t a 0 x t x a 0 t t q k c t k c a 0 t t q a 0 5 where t t q q 0 b denotes the fracture time for an infinite plane without a crack under the same load q then we obtain the following normalised principle equations for the considered problem a the cz condition 2 in the form t tc x x t 1 d 1 tc x 0 x t 1 d for a t x c t t tc x 6 b the expression for the stress ahead of the cz x t x x 2 c 2 t 1 2 c t a t c 2 t 2 x 2 2 t d for x c t 7 c the zero stress intensity factor k c t 0 for t 0 where k c t c t 2 2 c t c t a t t c 2 t 2 d 8 3 cohesive zone growth for the stationary crack in this section we will consider the stationary stage when a t a 0 1 and only the cz grows with time our aim here is to find the cz tip position c t this stage is followed later by the crack propagation stage considered in the next sections 3 1 numerical method on the stationary crack stage let us introduce a time mesh with nodes ti ih for i 0 1 2 3 n where h 1 n is a time increment and tn 1 at each time step ti we use the secant method to find the roots c ti ci of the equation k ci ti 0 as follows 4 1 take 2 initial approximations ci 1 and ci 2 for c ti 2 obtain k 1 k ci 1 ti and k 2 k ci 2 ti using equation 8 in order to evaluate the integral in 8 c ti a 0 1 c 2 ti 2 ti d 9 we piece wise linearly interpolate ti in on the cz over the points c tk k 0 1 2 i to obtain c ti ti we use the abel integral equation 6 with zero left hand side which reduces the equation to the following one ti 0 c ti ti 1 d 1 by explicit integration of the piece wise linear interpolant of the function c ti in over the time instants tj j 0 1 2 i including the unknown value c ti ti we obtain the linear algebraic equation for the latter which has the solution c

closer look at the cz tip near t all the graphs illustrate fast numerical convergence of the obtained results except the graphs in fig 6 for the stress at the cohesive zone tip in more details the convergence in these and the following graphs is analysed in section 6 4 crack tip opening we will first consider the case when the bulk of the material is linearly elastic and then convert the obtained solution to the case of linear visco elastic materials using the so called volterra principle using the representations by muskhelishvili see 22 section 120 it can be deduced that in the linearly elastic isotropic homogeneous plane with a crack the normal displacement jump at a point x on the crack or cz shore is u e x t u q e x t u e x t x c t where u q e x t q 1 2 0 c t 2 x 2 u e x t 1 2 0 c t a t t x c t d and x c ln 2 c 2 2 x 2 2 c 2 x 2 c 2 2 2 c 2 2 x 2 2 c 2 x 2 c 2 2 in the above expressions 3 4 under the plain strain condition while 3 1 under the plain stress condition 0 e 0 2 1 is the shear modulus where e 0 and denote young s modulus of elasticity and poisson s ratio respectively then the displacement jump at the crack tip that we call the crack tip opening for elastic material is given by the formula e t u e a t t 1 2 0 q c 2 t a 2 t 1 c t a t t a t c t d 18 using the space and time normalisations given in equation 5 as well as the following normalisation 8 ue x t 2 0 1 q u e x a 0 tt a 0 e t 2 0 1 q e t t a 0 19 we obtain ue x t c 2 t x 2 1 c t a t t x c t d e t ue a t t c 2 t a 2 t 1 c t a t t a t c t d 20 to obtain the crack tip opening in the visco elastic case we will implement the so called volterra principle according to which we have to replace the elastic constants 0 and in the elastic solution by the corresponding visco elastic operators to arrive at the visco elastic solution although this approach does not always bring a visco elastic solution for the problems with moving boundaries it is possible to show cf 23 that this approach leads to a visco elastic solution for the plane symmetric problem with a straight propagating crack this means that for the visco elastic problem we can directly use the results by muskhelishvili for the stress representation given in equation 4 since they do not include the elastic constants at all for simplicity we will consider the visco elastic material with constant purely elastic poisson s ratio and thus the parameter then to obtain the crack opening in the visco elastic case we have to replace 1 0 in 18 by the second kind volterra integral operator 1 defined as 1 t 1 0 t t 0 j t d where the creep function j is known and j is its derivative while 0 is the instant shear modulus hence the visco elastic crack tip opening becomes v t u v a t t 1 0 u e a t t e t t 0 j t u e a t d 21 in our numerical examples we use the creep function of a standard linear solid j t 0 e t 22 here the material parameters and are respectively the relaxation time and the viscosity of the visco elastic material such visco elastic models satisfactorily describe some polymers e g pmma also known as plexiglas for j in the form 22 after employing the normalised parameters v t 2 0 v t t 1 a 0 q t m 0 t

replaced with tc a t since ue x 0 when tc x 9 in the numerical examples for the visco elastic case we used values m 5 and 1 which are of the order of the ones for pmma see section 7 4 the graphs in

comparison of the crack tip opening vs time t for elastic and visco elastic cases 5 crack propagation stage we have so far assumed that the crack is stationary and only the cz is growing ahead of the crack however the crack will start to propagate when the crack tip opening reaches a critical value c which is considered as a material constant the crack and cz tip will not necessarily propagate at the same rate i e the crack length can vary assuming that the external load q is applied at time t 0 the time instant when the crack tip opening reaches a critical value and the crack starts propagating will be referred to as the fracture delay time sometimes also named as the fracture initiation time t d similar to 5 19 and 23 we employ the following normalised parameters td t d t c 2 0 1 q c a 0 25 the crack tip opening ti satisfies equation e t c t td 26 for the purely elastic case or equation v t c t td 27 for the visco elastic case where e ti and v ti are given by 20 and 24 respectively 5 1 numerical algorithm on the propagating crack stage the first aim in the crack propagation stage is to find the delay time td solving equations 26 or 27 by the secant method while a td 1 and the corresponding value of c td is obtained by setting the stress intensity factor to zero and applying secant iterations as explained in section 3 1 then to calculate the crack length and the cz length at t td we use the uniform time mesh with time steps ti td i h where h is the step size and implement the secant method to solve equation 26 in the elastic case or 27 in the visco elastic case for a ti to do this we need c ti at each iteration which is obtained using the secant method to solve equation k c ti ti 0 for c ti where the stress intensity factor k c t is given by 8 further details on the algorithm are given below 11 5 1 1 initial approximations note that we take the following 2 initial approximations for ai a ti ai 1 cm c tm and ai 2 cm 1 c tm 1 the index m is chosen so that the signs of e ti c for the elastic case or v ti c for the visco elastic case are different for ai ai 1 and ai ai 2 at the start of crack growth we begin with ai 1 a 0 c 0 and ai 2 c 1 the advantage of choosing previous cz tip positions cm as initial approximations for ai is that we already know the stress history at these points since they were computed in the previous time steps 5 1 2 computing the stress at a crack tip position further during the secant iterations to obtain ai we will need to compute the stress ai ti for cases when ai does not equal to the previous cm values this stress value will be used for the integration while calculating k ci ti and e ti by 8 and 20 respectively note that we cannot directly use the solution given by 11 to solve equation 6 with x ai cm ai cm 1 since it needs tc ai which approximate calculation can be time consuming instead we first find cm ti and cm 1 ti by 11 and then employ the following linear interpolant to approximate ai ti ai ti cm ti cm 1 ti cm ti cm 1 cm ai cm cm ai cm 1 5 1 3 calculating the visco elastic crack tip opening the crack tip opening in the visco elastic case is given by equation 24 however when an approximation for ai is a previous value of c i e ai cm then the integration over in equation 24 is from tm to t ti however when ai 6 c tm the time instant when ai became part of the cz tc ai is unknown and to avoid a time consuming calculation of tc ai we implement the following approach we replace tc ai with tm where cm ai cm 1 but take into account that ue ai tm 0 the integral over will be evaluated by piecewise linearly interpolating ue ai between tk and tk 1 for k m m 1 i 1 thus the integral would be written as i 1 k m tk 1 tk e ti ue ai d where ue ai ue ai tk ue ai tk 1 ue ai tk tk 1 tk tk tk tk 1 and the first non zero ue ai tk is for k m 1 when cm ai cm 1 during implementation of the algorithm we come across the step i where ai will exceed ci 1 and for decreasing cz length we will have ai ci 1 in all the steps which follow thus for these steps only 1 previous value of c namely ci 1 can be taken as an initial approximation of ai to avoid this effect we will modify the algorithm by fixing ai ci 1 and computing the corresponding ti and ci by solving equation 26 in the elastic case or 27 in the visco elastic case setting the crack tip opening displacement equal to the critical crack tip opening and k ci ti 0 setting the stress intensity factor to 0 respectively 12 5 2 numerical results for the propagating crack choosing pmma as a reference material see section 7 4 we used

solution obtained for the step size h hn n 1 2 n and yn y yn denote the corresponding absolute error when the exact value are unknown we will use aitken s extrapolation technique also known as the aitken 2 process see for example 1 section 2 6 to accelerate the convergence and obtain a good approximation to the exact solution it gives an approximation ya of the exact solution y based on 3 consecutive terms of a convergent sequence ya y n y n 2 y n 1 2 y n 2 y n 1 y n 2 28 consequently the approximate error will be taken as n ya yn we assume that there exists a constant c such that n ch

parameters 7 1 material parameter range of cz model applicability to analyse the range of b for which the cz model based on conditions 1 2 can exist let us first remark that if 1 then d dt t 1 b 0 1 t t which means that t is a strictly growing function for any t when t 0 particularly if the cohesive condition 2 is reached at some point x in time t c x it can not stay at larger times t t c x unless x t 0 but if x t 0 for t tc x this means that the point x belongs to the crack rather than to the cz that is the cz can not exist at 1 which corresponds to the robinson damage linear accumulation rule instead the robinson damage linear accumulation rule implies the crack propagation without the cohesive zone which as follows from 19 20 9 is possible only if 0 b 2 in the local approach although the neuber novozhilov type non local approach extends the applicability range to arbitrary b 0 similarly if 1 then d dt t 0 1 t t 0 t 2 d 0 which also prevents for the cz condition 2 to hold at any time t t c x after the condition had been reached at a time t c x even if x t 0 for t t c x thus the cz model defined by 1 2 is applicable only if 0 1 i e 0 b note that the material parameters obtained in 21 by fitting experimental data for several structural materials satisfy these conditions 7 2 analytical solution of the abel type equation in the cohesive zone to obtain the stresses in the cz we have to solve the abel type linear integral equation 6 for x t at t tc when x is known at 0 tc x at its right hand side to this end we have the following important assertion see for example 7 theorem 1 2 1 theorem 1 if f t is absolutely continuous on tc t 1 then the abel type integral equation t tc g t 1 d f t t tc t 1 0 1 has a unique solution g in l 1 tc t 1 which is given by formula g sin d d tc f t t dt 29 integrating by parts expression 29 can be written as g sin f tc tc tc f t t dt 30 for equation 6 f t 1 tc 0 x t 1 d moreover we know that f tc 0 when tc 0 since the condition 1 see equation 6 is satisfied at t tc 0 finally x g at tc 22 7 3 continuity of x t in t let us now analyse the behaviour of the numerical solution of 6 for x t as t tc x 0 and prove that if we take the piece wise approximation of the function x t in t tc x over the time instants tj j 0 1 2 k we obtain continuity of x t at t tc x also from the right i e when t tc x 0 indeed from the first equality in 11 where tk tc x we have lim t tc x 0 x t lim t tc x 0 1 sin k j 1 x tj 1 v tj 1 t tc x v tj t tc x 1 x tj x tj 1 tj tj 1 w tj 1 t tc x w tj t tc x tj tj 1 v tj t tc x 31 in the above formula only v y t tc x and w y t tc x depend on t moreover since 0 from 12 and 15 we have for any t v tc t tc csc w tc t tc 0 for the case when y 6 tc we have lim t tc 0 v y t tc lim t tc 0 csc 1 tc y t y 2 f 1 1 tc y t y csc 1 1 1 csc 1 csc 0 lim t tc 0 w y t tc lim t tc 0 csc t y 1 1 tc y 1 t y 2 f 1 1 2 tc y t y csc tc y 1 1 tc y 2 1 csc tc y tc y csc 0 where we have used that 2 f 1 a b c 1 c c a b c a c b as well as other properties of the gamma function such as z 1 z z and 1 z z csc z consequently in equation 31 the summation over j yields lim t tc x 0 x t 1 sin csc x tk 1 1 x tc x x tk 1 tc x tk 1 tc x tk 1 csc x tc x therefore lim t tc x 0 x t x tc x for 0 1 23 7 4 material parameters used in the numerical examples we used in this paper the material parameters close to the ones for pmma for the

96 hr m 5 and 1 we took the critical crack opening displacement c 0 0016 mm cf 5 section 10 3 2 and references therein under the plane stress condition 3 1 1 96 and by 25 we obtain c 0 238 for q 51 6 mpa and for the initial crack length a 0 0 1 mm 8 concluding remarks a novel non linear history dependent cohesive zone model of crack propagation in linearly elastic and visco elastic materials which is a history dependent modification of the leonov panasyuk dugdale model was introduced in the paper the normal stress on the cohesive zone satisfies the history dependent yield condition given in terms of the normalised history dependent equivalent stress 1 which is a non linear abel type integral operator implemented before in 21 as a global material strength condition the viscoelasticity is described by a linear volterra integral operator in time the crack starts propagating breaking the cohesive zone when the crack tip opening reaches a prescribed critical value a numerical algorithm for computing the evolution of the crack and cohesive zone in time is discussed along with some numerical results as was shown in the paper the cz model is applicable only if material parameters b and of the history dependent yield condition based on the power type durability diagram are such that b 0 0 b this particularly implies that the cz model is not applicable for the robinson type yield condition based on the power type durability diagram the cz model was employed in the plane problem for a single straight crack in an infinite elastic or visco elastic plane under a homogeneous traction normal to the crack direction applied to the plane at infinity at time zero and kept constant in time thereafter the numerical results have shown that for both elastic and visco elastic materials there exists a fracture delay time td since a remote constant load is applied during which the cohesive zone grows while the crack does not for the growing crack stage t td the crack growth rate increases while the cz length decreases with time it appeared that in the elastic case for some material parameters there is an unstable crack growth at the onset of crack propagation followed by stable crack growth it also causes a jump decrease in the cz length followed by a continuous cz length evolution however for other material parameters no crack instability was detected for the elastic case implying the stable crack propagation at the visco elastic case the crack propagation was stable for all considered parameters the time when the cz length decreases to zero seems to coincide with the time when the crack length becomes infinite and can be associated with the complete rupture of the body the rupture time for the visco elastic case is slightly smaller than that for the purely elastic case implementing different mesh sizes we observed that the solution normally converges with the mesh refinement and we analysed the convergence rates an exception is the very slow if at all convergence of the cz tip stress for some material parameters which may be a manifestation of a cz tip stress singularity at some range of parameters b and although the square root 24 singularity has been eliminated in the model by the requirement that the corresponding stress intensity factor at the cz tip is zero a singularity of a different order can be still present there however this needs a careful analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper the results presented in the paper particularly show that the the normalised history dependent equivalent stress 1 is well suitable not only for better approximation of the experimental creep strength data see 21 but can also be successfully used for numerical solution of some non stationary problems for bodies under inhomogeneous variable stresses as shown in 18 the cohesive zone model approach can be also interpreted as a particular non local approach cf 16 17 in this sense the cz model in history dependent materials presented in this paper is related to another non local approach based on the neuber novozhilov type stress averaging ahead of the crack under creep or fatigue loading 19 20 references 1 atkinson k e an introduction to
