are soliton hierarchies introduced by terng to find higher flows of the generalized sine gordon equation twisted o j j o j o j hierarchies are among the most important classes of twisted hierarchies in this paper interesting first and higher flows of twisted o j j o j o j hierarchies are explicitly derived the associated submanifold geometry is investigated and a unified treatment of the inverse scattering theory is provided 1 introduction the interaction between differential geometry and partial differential equations has been studied since the 19 th century and it can be found in the works of lie darboux goursat bianchi ba cklund and e cartan one of the best known examples is the correspondence between surfaces of constant negative gaussian curvature and the solutions of the sine gordon equation the generalized sine gordon equation gsge 25 26 o n 1 1 xj ki kjfij fii 0 i 6 j 1 2 xjfij xifji k 6 i j fikfjk 1 i 1 j i 6 j 1 3 xkfij fikfkj i j k distinct 1 4 where 1 i j k n defined by the gauss codazzi equation for n dimensional sub manifolds in r 2 n 1 with constant sectional curvature 1 is a natural multidimensional differential geometic generalization of the sine gordon equation 1 http arxiv org abs 1103 6077 v 1 the gsge has ba cklund transformations permutability formula 26 28 a lax pair and an inverse scattering theory 1 recently via a lie algebra splitting approach terng in troduced twisted u and twisted u k hierarchies twisted hierarchies on symmetric spaces 27 and showed that the gsge can be interpreted as the 1 dimensional system of the twisted o n n o n o n hierarchy as a result she obtained all higher commuting flows of the gsge there are rich intertwined analytic algebraic and geometric structures of these twisted hierarchies twisted o j j o j o j hierarchies are among the most important classes of twisted hierarchies which contains the twisted o n n o n o n hierarchy j i as a special case and possesses prototypical analytic algebraic and geometric structures of twisted hierarchies for instance the associated lax pairs of the twisted o j j o j o j hierarchy are laurent poly nomials in the spectral variable therefore the eigenfunctions depend on x as and we need to renormalize the eigenfunctions in solving the inverse scattering problem the renormalization process breaks the symmetries thus a proper gauge is needed to re construct the symmetries and the potentials inspired by the result of 1 we reconstruct the symmetry via solving an exterior product partial differential system which is derived from the associated 1 dimensional system on the other hand in the study of the submanifold geometry associated with twisted hierarchies besides the case j i mentioned above 26 25 1 we discover that the 1 dimensional systems of the twisted o j j o j o j hierarchy j i 1 n 1 describe the geometry of n dimensional time like submanifolds of constant positive sectional curvature in r 2 n 11 therefore rather than the space like submanifolds associated with the generating equation introduced by tenenblat 10 24 the time like submanifolds interpret the geometry of soliton equations and can be tackled via an inverse scattering method in this respect twisted o j j o j o j flows are more intimate with the gsge or the sine gordon equation finally many interesting soliton hierarchies can be constructed from splittings of loop algebras fixed by involutions or automorphisms 2 12 29 28 this observation moti vates the classification theory of integrable systems via different representations and possible reductions 20 13 21 22 19 the set up of the correspondence between the reduction groups and the inverse scattering theory then becomes an important issue for mathemati cians 16 15 17 since the twisted o j j o j o j hierarchies are integrable equations induced by two involutions 0 1 1 on the loop group in the symmetric space o j j o j o j our work provides a complete inverse scattering theory of integrable systems with the reduction group given by the dihedral group d 2 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define the twisted o j j o j o j hierarchies via splittings of loop algebras and compute explicit examples which include a new 4 th order partial differential system 2 19 2 20 section 3 is devoted to the investigation of the associated submanifold geometry in particular we prove that the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system twisted by 1 with j i 1 n 1 is the gauss codazzi equation for an n dimensional time like submanifold of constant sectional curvature 1 in r 2 n 11 and derive a ba cklund transformation theory for the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system in section 4 we solve the direct problem by constructing special eigenfunctions which corre 2 spond to global twisted flows with nice decaying properties and regularities and extracting the scattering data section 5 and 6 are devoted to the reconstruction of the flows from scattering data in particular by studying the riemann hilbert problem of the twisted o j j o j o j flows eigenfunctions with arbitrary poles and multiplicity are constructed for j i and eigenfunctions with small purely continuous scattering data are derived for j 6 i the cauchy problems of twisted flows and the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system are solved in section 7 2 the twisted o j j o j o j hierarchy to define

generalize the definition of twisted hierarchies by analogy 3 the 1 dimensional system we discuss associated submanifold geometry of twisted o j j o j o j flows a 1 dimensional system is constructed by putting all first flows together in a soliton hierarchy many 1 dimensional systems are the gauss codazzi equations for submanifolds in space forms or symmetric spaces with special geometric properties for instance the gauss codazzi equa tions for isothermic surfaces in r 3 is the 1 dimensional system of the o 4 1 o 3 o 1 1 hierarchy 11 6 7 other interesting examples can be found in 27 similarly for the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system one has definition 3 1 the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system twisted by 1 is the com patibility condition of xi mjai 1 m 1 xj mjaj

dxi dxi ii n 2 n i 1 ia 1 i a i dxi dxien 1 3 12 11 where diag 1 2 n diag 1 1 1 i 1 n 1 j then the gauss codazzi equation and the structure equation is the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system 3

3 24 where u n i 1 uidxi a o 1 n 1 so 3 23 implies that the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system is equivalent to the flatness condition d 0 3 25 on the other hand by 3 24 the flatness condition

theorem 3 1 reduces the proof to showing the existence of such n dimensional subman ifolds note theorem 7 2 of section 7 implies that the 1 dimensional twisted o j j o j o j system 3 1 with b ai vi defined by 3 13 can be solved in r n by theorem 3 1 we then conclude the solvability of the gauss codazzi equation of such submanifolds therefore a modifed version of the bonnet theorem yields the existence of a time like n dimensional submanifold m of constant sectional curvature 1 in r 2 n 11 local coordinates x 1 x 2 xn on a neighborhood of p m and parallel normal frames en 1 e 2 n 1 with the first and second fundamental forms 3 12 we remark that the correspondence between the sinh gordon equation and the positive constant gaussian curvature time like surface in r 31 has been established by chern 8 in the following theorem we construct a riccati type ba cklund transformation analogous to 3 10 of the generalized sinh gordon equation 3 14 3 17 moreover we linearize the ba

orthogonal projections of gl n c to the 0 eigenspaces of rej 1 2 j j moreover the characteristic curve of 4 1 is defined by a c the image of 0 is non empty 17 definition 4 2 we call a 0 d d 0 a principal oblique direction if w 1 w for 1 n and the 2 n real numbers w 1 wn are distinct with d diag w 1 wn 1 one can verify that if a is a principal oblique direction then a ir s 1 let us label the components of c a as 1 re 0 1 re 0 d 1 re 0 d 1 re 0 note permutaion matrices do not commute with 1 hence it is natural to consider the following example definition 4 3 we call a 0 d d 0 an oblique direction if the 2 n real numbers w 1 wn are distinct here d diag w 1 wn one can verify that if a is an oblique direction then a ir s 1 1 s s rv s 1 r where r r w 1 w 6 1 and s is the number of w such that w w 1 let us label the components of c a as r r 1 re 0 r r 1 re 0 d 1 r 1 1 r re 0 d 1 r 1 1 r re 0 for 0 s here we assume r 0 1 r 1 rs rs 1 restricted to the case of q 0 and a is a principal oblique direction the direct problem is solved by 1 5 after a diagonalization process of 4 1 theorem 4 1 let a a a constant oblique direction b x k 0 v x s 0 if b 1 l 1 1 l v l 1 then there exists a bounded set z c such that z c a is discrete in c a and for c a there exists uniquely a solution m x of 4 3 satisfying m is bounded for each c a z 4 6 m x 1 as x for each c a z 4 7 m x is meromorphic in c a with poles at z 4 8 m x b x uniformly as 4 9 and m x l 0 4 10 m x 1 m x 1 4 11 18 proof step 1 small data problem in this step we assume that q l 1 1 for 1 where q is defined by 4 5 thus for x r we can find m x which satisfies the integral equation m x 1 x e x y j 0 q y m y dy x e x y j q y m y dy one can also verify that m x satisfies 4 4 4 6 4 10 for x r m x 1 as x or m x is holomorphic in and has a continuous extension to a from define m x b x m x if x r 1 b x m x 1 if x r d 4 12 using the 1 symmetry and the unique solvability of 4 3 we then prove the theorem provided q l 1 1 i e when the potentials b v satisfy b 1 l 1 1 l v l 1 c 1 step 2 large data problem we induce on the least integer n 0 such that q l 1 2 n note that the eigenfunc tion of 4 4 corresponding to a translate

tend to 1 as 4 16 let us define s 1 0 0 for 4 17 one can adapt the argument in 14 to factorize s 1 l 1 u 1 4 18 19 where 0 u u 0 4 19 0 l l 0 4 20 0 4 21 for and u l are meromorphic in with poles at z

exj 1 u x x 0 x exj 1 l x x 0 4 24 and m x by 4 12 then we complete the theorem by properties 4 12 4 24 corollary 4 1 let a a a constant oblique direction b x k 0 v x s 0 b 1 l 1 1 l v l 1 if the set

components 0 1 2 3 and from d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 and denote by m the limits from the other components then m x m x e x a 1 1 a v ex a 1 1 a for a 4 26 proof a refined argument of the proof of theorem 4 1 can derive the factorization of m x on r the jump condition 4 26 comes from the limits m defined by 4 2 exist on a m satisfy the same equation 4 4 and the operator x j is a derivation definition 4 4 if the assumption in corollary 4 1 holds then u v is called the asso ciated scattering data of the potential b v definition 4 5 let p be the matrix satisfying that p 1 j p is a diagonal matrix with decreasing entries and p lim n p n n 0 1 2 d 0 d 1 note that p is constant on each component of c a theorem 4 2 let a a a constant oblique direction suppose b x k 0 v x s 0 and their derivatives are rapidly decreasing as x if the set z in theorem 4 1 is a finite set contained in c a then for the scattering data u v we have the analytical constraints v i is o n as 0 and o n as for n 0 4 27 the product of limits of v from each component arranged clockwisely 4 28 is i at each intersection of a u are rational in holomorphic in c 4 29 u tend to 0 as 4 30 the algebraic constraints 0 u u 0 4 31 j

proof properties 4 29 4 31 have been shown in corollary 4 1 the analytic constraints 4 27 and 4 28 can be deduced from the results of 4 note 4 10 implies j m x j m x 1 m x mt x 0 m x m x 4 38 together with the the uniqueness of the factorization of m x on r we derive the reality conditions 4 32 4 33 similarly 4 26 implies j m x j j ex a 1 1 a v e x a 1 1 a m x j m x ex a 1 1 a v e x a 1 1 a m x for a hence m x 1 e x a 1 1 a j v j ex a 1 1 a m x 1 m x t ex a 1 1 a v e x a 1 1 a m x t for a by 4 38 so 4 35 is proved on the other hand applying 0 to both sides of 4 26 and using 4 38 we obtain m x m x e x a 1 1 a 0 v e x a 1 1 a for a hence we justify 4 36 finally 4 37 is proved by applying 1 to both sides of 4 26 and using 4 11 instead to prove 4 34 we compute d k p 1 v p d k p 1 m 1 m 0 p d k p

0 1 n 1 replacing 1 by i defined in remark 1 we can solve the associated direct problem by analogy 5 the inverse scattering problem i the goal of the inverse problem is to find the potential b v for a given scattering data u v usually we try to reverse the process in the direct problem however there exists 22 technical difficulties to find m since the boundary value of m is b x as hence it is impossible for us to pose the riemann hilbert problem for m we will adopt the approach of 23 to construct a normalized eigenfunction m x prescribing the given scattering data u v with boundary value 1 at infinity in this section then we will try to find a gauge which transforms m into a solution m x of 4 3 in next section we note in 1 5 they solve the inverse problem for the twisted o n n o n o n system with u admitting only simple poles theorem 5 1 let q 0 and a a suppose u v satisfies 4 27 4 37 then there exists uniquely an m x l 0 satisfying k x m x i l k 2 a for k k and tends to 0 uniformly as x 5 1 m x x e xj 1 u x x 0 1 x e xj 1 l x x 0 2 x e xj 1 u x x 0 d 3 x e xj 1 l x x 0 d 4 5 2 and m x m x e x a 1 1 a v ex a 1 1 a for a 5 3 here x and x are holomorphic and uniformly bounded 5 4 x and x tend to 1 as 5 5 are meromorphic and tend to 1 as 5 6 0 l l 0 5 7 0 5 8 for x and x are holomorphic and uniformly bounded 5 9 for d and l are rational in holomorphic in c 5 10 l tends to 0 as 5 11 1 u 1 1 u 0 1 1 u 1 5 12 1 l 1 0 1 1 l 0 1 1 l 1 0 5 13 1 0 1 1 5 14 proof step 1 x 0 c a define u by 5 12 let u u u d 5 15 23 and u the limits on a from 0 1 2 3 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 define w 1 u v 1 u 1 for a 5 16 then to show 1 3 in 5 2 and the statement about in 5 4 5 5 is equivalent to solving the following riemann hilbert problem with purely continuous scattering data f x f x e x a 1 1 a w ex a 1 1 a for a 5 17 f is holomorphic in c a f x 1 as 5 18 and setting f x x x d to solve the above riemann hilbert problem one can apply the method 10 in 4 to prove its fredholm property so the solvability is reduced to showing that the homogeneous solution is trivial let g x f x f x and f satisfies 5 17 is holomorphic in c a and tends to 0 as hence if w w a 5 19 then for a g x f x f x f x f x e x a 1 1 a w e x a 1 1 a f x exjw f x f x f x g x so g 0 by the liouville s theorem moreover the positivity condition 5 19 implies f 0 for ir hence f 0 by holomorphicy to prove the claim 5 19 we note that the algebraic constraints 4 32 4 33 4 35 and 4 36 of the scattering data imply v v 1 u 1 u 1 5 20 using these reality conditions and the definition of w we can derive 5 19 step 2 construction of l l we first solve the scalar riemann hilbert problems for the entries of a matrix is meromorphic in c a 1 as 5 21 0 5 22 p 1 p k p 1 p k d 2 n k 1 p 1 v p d 2 n k p 1 v p 5 23 zeros of p 1 p k poles of the k 1 th column of p 1 up 5 24 poles of p 1 p k poles of the k th column of p 1 up 5 25 24 here p is defined by definition 4 5 f k denotes the k th entry of the diagonal part of f for 1 k 2 n then and are constructed by d 5 26 to construct l l by 4 34 5 22 and 5 23 one can factorize v 1 l 1 1 1 l 5 27 n l n 0 l 0 n l n 0 l 0 on a here n n 0 1 2 3 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 by theorem 5 2 of 23 we can have the extensions l 0 r 0 satisfying 1 l 1 1 r 1 l on a 5 28 n r n 0 r 0 n l n 0 l 0 on o 5 29 r is holomorphic on o meromorphic on o c 5 30 l is holomorphic on o c rational on o 5 31 here o is the component of 0 1 2 3 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 which contains n n hence 5 27 5 28 imply v 1 1 l 1 r 1 l 5 32 where is defined by 5 26 r 1 r 1 1 r l l o l o 5 33 finally l l are defined by l l l d 5 34 step 3 x 0 c a having contructed l l one can adopt the scheme of step 1 to find and more precisely let 1 l v 1 1 l 1 for a then to show 2 4 in 5 2 and the statement about in 5 4 5 5 is equivalent to solving the following riemann hilbert problem with purely continuous scattering data f x f x e x a 1 1 a ex a 1 1 a for a 5 35 f is holomorphic in c a f x 1 as 5 36 25 and setting f x x x d as above the solvability can be reduced to showing a 5 37 and it can be implied by the reality conditions v v 1 1 l 1 l 1 5 38 the reality condition v v follows from the algebraic constraints 4 35 4 36 moreover by v v 5 27 we have v 1 l 1 1 l 1 together with 4 34 we conclude 1 satisfies 5 23 so there is no jump across a for on the other hand by 5 24 4 32 and 4 33 zeros of p 1 1 p k zeros of p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 p p k zeros of p 1 p 1 2 n k 1 poles of the 2 n k th column of p u p poles of the k 1 th column of p 1 u p zeros of p 1 p k similarly 5 25 4 32 and 4 33 imply poles of p 1 1 p k poles of p 1 p k thus the liouville s theorem implies 1 and 1 l 1 l 1 finally 1 l 0 1 l 0 1 5 39 by v v 5 27 5 28 5 30 5 31 and the liouville s theorem so 1 l 1 l 1 comes from 5 33 5 39 and 1 step 4 proof of m x l 0 let w be defined by 5 16 then j w j w 1 w w t 5 40 0 w w 1 5 41 by 4 32 4 33 4 35 and 4 36 therefore one can reverse the process in the proof of theorem 4 2 to show j m x j m x 1 m x m t x 0 m x m x 5 42 26 so m x l 0 for x 0 as for x 0 note the formula 1 4 5 42 and the unique factorization properties imply j 1 l j 1 l 1 l l t 0 l l j j 1 t 0 therefore using the above argument one can justify m x l 0 for x 0 step 5 proof of 5 13 and 5 14 the strategy of the proof is analogous to that of showing 5 38 by 4 35 4 37 5 27 we have v 1 1 l 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 l 1 1 5 43 thus 1 satisfies 5 23 by 4 34 and 1 1 has no jump across a on the other hand by 5 24 5 12 for c a zeros of p 1 1 1 p k zeros of p 1 1 p 1 p 1 1 1 p 1 p 1 1 p k zeros of p 1 1 1 p 1 k poles of the k 1 th column of p 1 1 u 1 p 1 poles of the k 1 th column of p 1 1 1 u p 1 poles of the k 1 th column of p 1 u p zeros of p 1 p k here we have use the diagonal property of p 1 1 p 1 similarly poles of p 1 1 1 p k poles of p 1 p k can be justified by 5 25 5 12 thus the liouville s theorem implies 1 1 1 is a constant hence we prove 5 14 by a normalization furthermore 1 l 1 are equal to l up to a constant by 5 43 so 5 13 follows by 5 28 5 30 5 31 5 33 and 5 14 the analytic constraints 5 1 can be deduced from the results of 4 27 theorem 5 2 let q 6 0 and a a suppose v satisfies 4 27 4 28 4 34 4 37 and v 1 l 1 then there exists uniquely an m x l 0 satisfying m x m x e x a 1 1 a v ex a 1 1 a for a 5 44 m is holomorphic in c a m x 1 as 5 45 k x m x i l k 2 a for k k and tends to 0 uniformly 5 46 as x proof if q 6 0 then the positivity conditions 5 19 5 37 fail in step 1 and step 3 however the riemann hilbert problems 5 17 5 18 5 21 5 23 and 5 35 5 36 with u 0 l 0 in step 1 3 can be solved under the small data constraint v 1 l 2 1 remark 4 we remark that if l l are contructed by corollary 4 1 and define by 5 26 5 34 then 5 21 5 25 5 32 are valid by adapting the argument in the proof of theorem 4 6 and 4 7 in 23 6 the inverse scattering problem ii we adapt the argument in 1 to complete the process of reconstructing the operator 4 1 in this section that is we need to find a proper gauge b x k 0 which transforms m x to the eigenfunction m x of 4 3 write a 0 d d 0 and d diag w 1 wn define x x 1 xn x w 1 wn 6 1 x n i 1 xiai ai are defined by 3 2 6 2 m x m x a m x 6 3 lemma 6 1 suppose m x is derived by theorem 5 1 or 5 2 then m xj m aj 1 1 aj 1 1 aj bj x m cj x m 6 4 with bj x p 0 c cj x k 0 c 6 5 proof we are going to show that xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 is holomorphic on c 0 and bounded at hence 6 4 follows immediately from the asymptotic expansions m x 1 k 1 mk x k as 6 6 m x k 0 m k x k as 0 6 7 and the conditions 6 5 come from xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 l 0 by using m l 0 aj 1 1 aj l 0 5 1 and 5 46 28 if x

x 0 using 2 3 4 in 5 2 and the same argument we will derive similar formula on other com ponents so xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 is regular on c a by the properties of and in theorem 5 1 besides by 5 3 5 44 we derive xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m e x 1 1 x v e x 1 1 x 1 m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m e x 1 1 x v e x 1 1 x 1 m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 therefore xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 is continuous at a the uniform bound edness of xj ad aj 1 1 aj m m 1 at can be seen by 6 6 lemma 6 2 the compatibility conditions of 6 4 are xjci xicj ci cj bi aj bj ai 6 8 29 proof taking the derivative xi of 6 4 we have xi xjm m ai 1 1 ai aj 1 1 aj 1 1 ai bi m cim aj 1 1 aj 1 bj xi cj xi m 1 1 aj bj cj m ai 1 1 ai 1 1 aj bj cj 1

used ai cj m ai 1 1 ai aj 1 1 aj are symmetric with respect to i j which follow from 6 9 therefore the compatibility conditions of 6 4 are 6 8 lemma 6 3 suppose either of the assumption in theorem 5 1 or 5 2 holds then there exists b x k 0 c 6 10 such that b x w 1 wn 1 as x 6 11 bcjb 1 jb b 1 s 0 for j 6 12 proof by 6 8 and 6 5 to prove 6 10 and 6 12 we need only to show bj ai s 0 i 6 j 6 13 30 first of all let us claim m x 1 m 1 0 m x 1 6 14 here m 0 is defined by 6 7 the assertion can be proved by the liouville s theorem and conditions 4 37 5 3 5 12 5 14 and 5 2 therefore taking the limits of 6 14 at 0 we derive m 0 1 m 0 1 6 15 note m 0 k 0 by m x l 0 hence m 0 f 1 0 0 f 2 with fi o j 6 16 and o j x gln c jx jx jxtjx 1 combining 6 15 and 6 16 we have f 21 1 therefore the minimal polynomial of f 1 must be a divisor of 2 1 if j i then 6 16 implies f 1 is always diagonalizable if j 6 i and v 1 l 2 1 by continuity f 1 is diagonalizable too hence the minimal polynomial of f 1 must be 1 therefore we conclude m 0 k 0 6 17 now let us equate the 1 terms of 6 4 at 0 we obtain m 0 1 aj bjm 0 0 6 18 plugging 6 17 into 6 18 and solving for bj one can justify 6 13 theorem 6 1 suppose either of the assumption in theorem 5 1 or 5 2 holds let x b x m x e x 1 1 x 6 19 here x x x m satisfy 6 1 6 3 then x bab 1 1 1 bab 1 v with b x b x w 1 wn k 0 c v x wj bcjb 1 jb b 1 x w 1 wn s 0 c 6

wjbj b 1 wj bcjb 1 jb b 1 bab 1 1 b n j 1 wjbj b 1 v 6 21 with v wj bcjb 1 jb b 1 s 0 by lemma 6 3 the proof reduces to showing the 1 b n j 1 wjbj b 1 bab 1 define a n j 1 wjbajb 1 dxj 6 22 b n j 1

defined in remark 1 we can solve the associated inverse problem by analogy 32 7 the cauchy problem theorem 7 1 let a a a be constant oblique directions b 0 x k 0 v 0 x s 0 suppose b 0 1 v 0 and their

then the cauchy problem of the twisted flow x bab 1 v 1 bab 1 1 t 2 j 1 s 1 qs s q 0 2 j 1 s 1 1 qs s 0 b x 0 b 0 v x 0 v 0 admits a smooth solution for x r t 0 here qs x t 0 s 2 j 1 are defined by 2
