we extend the classification of solvable lie algebras with abelian nilradicals to classify solvable leibniz algebras which are one dimensional extensions of abelian nilradicals 1 introduction leibniz algebras were defined by loday in 1993 12 13 recently there has been a trend to show how various results from lie algebras extend to leibniz algebras 1 3 16 in particular there has been interest in extending classifications of certain classes of lie algebras to classifications of corresponding leibniz algebras 2 4 5 8 9 11 some of the classifications of lie algebras come from placing certain restrictions on the nilradical 7 15 17 18 several authors have been able to extend these results to leibniz algebras or show similar results for leibniz algebras with certain restrictions on the nilradical 5 8 9 10 11 in praticular ndogmo and winternitz 15 study solvable lie algebras with abelian nilradicals the goal of this paper is to utilize the results of 15 to develop similar results in the leibniz setting we construct a general classification theorem for solvable leibniz algebras with abelian nil radicals over c furthermore we discuss the case of 1 dimensional extensions then provide an explicit classification of all 1 dimensional extensions of 1 2 and 3 dimensional abelian nilradicals in 6 can ete and khudoyberdiyev classify all non nilpotent 4 dimensional leib niz algebras over c our classification recovers their result for 4 dimensional algebras with 3 dimensional abelian nilradicals we also develop some results on 2 dimensional extensions of abelian nilradicals specifically we show that all 4 dimensional solvable leibniz algebras with 2 dimensional abelian nilradicals are in fact lie algebras 1 http arxiv org abs 1409 0936 v 3 2 preliminaries a leibniz algebra l is a vector space over a field which we will take to be c or r with a bilinear operation which we will call multiplication defined by x y which satisfies the jacobi identity 1 x y z x y z y x z for all x y z l in other words lx left multiplication by x is a derivation some authors choose to impose this property on rx right multiplication by x instead such an algebra is called a right leibniz algebra but we will consider only left leibniz algebras which satisfy 1 l is a lie algebra if additionally x y y x the derived series of a leibniz lie algebra l is defined by l 1 l l l n 1 l n l n for n 1 l is called solvable if l n 0 for some n the lower central series of l is defined by l 2 l l ln 1 l ln for n 1 l is called nilpotent if ln 0 for some n it should be noted that if l is nilpotent then l must be solvable the nilradical of l is defined to be the unique maximal nilpotent ideal of l denoted by nilrad l it is a classical result that if l is solvable then l 2 l l nilrad l from 14 we have that dim nilrad l 1 2 dim l an abelian lie algebra a r is the r dimensional lie algebra with basis n 1 n 2 nr and multiplication 2 ni nj 0 i j 1 2 r the left annihilator or left normalizer of a leibniz algebra l is the ideal ann l x l x y 0 y l note that the elements x x and x y y x are in ann l for all x y l because of 1 2 an element x in a leibniz algebra l is nilpotent if both lx n rx n 0 for some n in other words for all y in l x x x y 0 y x x x a set of matrices x is called linearly nilindependent if no non zero linear combination of them is nilpotent in other words if x f 1 c x then xn 0 implies that c 0 for all a set of elements of a leibniz algebra l is called linearly nilindependent if no non zero linear combination of them is a nilpotent element of l 3 classification let a r be the r dimensional abelian lie algebra over the field f c or r with basis n 1 nr and products given by 2 by appending the basis of a r with s linearly nilin dependent elements x 1 xs we construct an n dimensional solvable leibniz algebra l r s where n r s in doing so we create a leibniz algebra whose nilradical is a r henceforth we shall only consider such l r s that are indecomposable as in 15 we have the following constraints on r s and n 3 n r s n 2 r n 1 let l be a finite dimensional solvable non nilpotent leibniz algebra over the field f of characteristic zero subject to 3 let l have an r dimensional abelian nilradical namely nilrad l a r for l we may choose the basis n 1 nr x 1 xs where n 1 nr a r and x 1 xs l a r in general the bracket relations for elements in a r are defined by ni nj 0 ni nj a r letting n n 1 n 2 nr t then the left and 3 right bracket relations of elements x are defined for 1 s n 2 by x n l n l f r r n x r n r f r r 4 a x x j nj j f 4 b since l 2 nilrad l a r note that we are employing einstein notation in 4 b summing over all j the classification of these leibniz algebras l r s is equivalent to the classification of the matrices l and r and the constants j the jacobi identities for the triples x x ni x ni x ni x x for 1 s and 1 i r yield respectively l ijl jk l ijl jk nk 0 r ijl jk l ijr jk nk 0 r ijr jk r ijl jk nk 0 unlike the lie case these give nontrivial relations for s 1 or when s 1 by the linear nilindependence of the nk we have the following relations on the matrices l and r l l 0 5 a l r 0 5 b r l r 0 5 c where 5 c utilizes 5 b the jacobi identity for the triple x x x for 1 s gives us 6 j l jk j r jk j l jk 0 4 summed over j again we do not require to be distinct which in particular gives nontrivial relations for s 1 equivalently since x x ann l we have j r jk 0 1 s and again we are summing over index j lemma 3 1 let l be a leibniz algebra with abelian nilradical with elements defined by 4 a and 4 b and denote 1 r then ns r t for all 1 s proof recall that for leibniz algebra l x y y x ann l x y l hence x x x x ann l 1 s in particular x x x x x 0 which implies that i i r ij 0 where here we are summing over all i 1 r additionally this is true for all j 1 r and all 1 s thus tr 0 which implies that r t 0 therefore ns r t what is more if then it immediately follows that ns r t as well it is advisable to note that lemma 3 1 does not imply that or need be nontrivial elements of ns r t in an effort to simplify matrices l and r and constants j we employ several trans formations which leave bracket relations 2 invariant namely redefine the elements of nilrad l n sn s gl r f r sr s 1 l sl s 1 7 5 redefine the elements of the extension 8 x x j nj j f redefine the extension by linear combinations of x 9 x gx x gl s f where x x 1 x 2 xs t the matrix s used in 7 is simply required to be invertible to preserve 2 so we may choose s to be the appropriate permutation matrix which transforms r 1 into jordan canonical form therefore the classification of leibniz algebras l r s with abelian nilradical will rely primarily on classes defined by the jordan canonical form of the r r matrix r 1 unfortunately it cannot be guaranteed that the same s will also transform l 1 or r or l 1 into jordan canonical form these matrices however will be determined by other constraints for example note that if r 1 has no zero eigenvalues then r 1 1 exists and so by 5 c r l for all 1 s observe that in 9 for the special case of a 1 dimensional extension of a r the matrix g will be a scalar note that 8 leaves ns r t and the matrices l and r invariant but it will have an effect on k that is 10 k k jr jk jl jk k 1 r in the special case where we see that 10 appears as k k j r jk l jk implying that we cannot use 8 to manipulate when r l for 1 s this is of particular value in the s 1 case as it implies that we may not change 11 k k when r 1 l 1 6 4 1 dimensional extensions of a r we will explore the non lie leibniz algebras whose abelian nilradical a r is extended by a single semisimple element x in this case we have a specialized version of the previous result lemma 3 1 as well as a general classification theorem for non lie leibniz algebras l r 1 throughout this section we will assume that r is transformed by 7 into jordan canonical form which places the eigenvalues of r on its diagonal note that at least one of these eigenvalues must be nonzero or else x would act nilpotently on a r from the right once this transformation is complete we will reorder the basis elements of a r such that any jordan blocks associated with zero eigenvalues are moved to the bottom right corner of r we do this reordering in such a way so as to preserve each jordan block lastly we perform transformation 9 since s 1 g is any nonzero scalar of our choosing let g 1 1 where 1 is the first eigenvalue of r associated with the nilradical basis element n 1 this ensures that r 11 1 putting the result back in jordan form preserves the 1 s off the main diagonal lemma 4 1 let l r 1 be a leibniz algebra that is a 1 dimensional extension of an r dimensional abelian nilradical with elements defined by 4 a and 4 b and denote 1 r t then 1 ns rt and 2 rij 6 0 implies that i 0 proof statement 1 follows directly from lemma 3 1 in the case of a 1 dimensional exten sion for statement 2 recall that we may choose the appropriate permutation matrix s which transforms r into jordan canonical form by conjugation once this transformation is applied r consists of jordan blocks with each nonzero column of r either having a single nonzero entry or two nonzero entries suppose that column j has a single nonzero entry in row i then by 6 we know that i 0 7 suppose now that column j has two nonzero entries then these entries must be rjj and rj 1 j since they are components of j an m m jordan block associated with the eigenvalue 6 0 hence i j or j 1 so there is a smallest integer p m such that the j p column of r has a single nonzero entry namely r j p j p the first nonzero entry of j and hence j p 0 now consider the j p 1 column of r which must have two nonzero entries r j p j p 1 and r j p 1 j p 1 by 6 it must be the case that r j p j p 1 j p r j p 1 j p 1 j p 1 0 since j p 0 and r j p 1 j p 1 6 0 then j p 1 0 an iteration of this process will yield that j 1 j 0 so i 0 as needed lemma 4 2 let l r 1 be a solvable leibniz algebra that is a 1 dimensional extension by xof an r dimensional abelian nilradical a r if the matrix r which defines the right action of x on a r is nonsingular then l r 1 is a lie algebra proof if r is nonsingular then r 1 exists so by 5 c r l furthermore since we may use 7 to transform r into its jordan canonical form then the diagonal of r will consist of its eigenvalues nonsingular matrices have only nonzero eigenvalues thus by lemma 4 1 i 0 for all i 1 r therefore l r 1 is a lie algebra theorem 4 3 let l be an r 1 dimensional solvable non nilpotent leibniz algebra over the field f of characteristic zero with r let l have the r dimensional abelian nilradical namely nilrad l a r and let l be subject to 3 we may choose the basis of l to be n 1 nr x where n 1 nr a r and x l a r the bracket relations for elements in a r are defined by ni nj 0 ni nj a r letting n n 1 n 2 nr t then the left and right bracket relations of x are defined by x n ln l f r r n x rn r f r r 11 a x x jnj j f such that ns r t 11 b 8 where 1 r t we will specifically describe in detail l r 1 in the cases of r 1 2 3 4 1 leibniz algebras l 1 1 of non lie type for l 1 1 n x the products are n x rn x n ln and x x n with r l f by lemma 4 2 we see that if r 6 0 then l 1 1 is a lie algebra suppose then that r 0 implying that l 6 0 else x nilrad l 1 1 thus using 9 with g l 1 we obtain the algebra described in table 5 3 note that since r 0 there is no restriction placed on these algebras are classified in section 1 of table 5 3 4 2 leibniz algebras l 2 1 of non lie type for r 2 the only two jordan canonical forms are 1 0 0 2 12 a 1 1 0 1 12 b where 1 and 2 are eigenvalues of the matrix r that we are transforming where 1 and 2 are not necessarily distinct by lemma 4 2 r must be singular this leaves us with three possibilities for r 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 2 1 case 1 r 0 since r 0 7 leaves r invariant the zero matrix is always in jordan form and so can be used to put l in jordan form instead so l will be of form 12 a or 12 b if the diagonals of l are zero 1 2 0 then l is nilpotent hence so is l which contradicts nilrad l a 2 9 using 9 we can transform 1 to 1 in either case so l is one of 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 where 2 can be zero note that if 1 0 and 2 6 0 then we must first switch the basis elements n 1 and n 2 now applying 8 with the appropriate choice of makes 1 2 0 except when 0 in which case 1 0 and 2 is free these algebras are classified in section 2 of table 5 3 4 2 2 case 2 r 1 0 0 0 using 9 with g 1 1 we can further simplify this matrix to r 1 0 0 0 applying relations 5 b and 5 c we find that the matrix l is of the form l 1 0 0 a if a 0 then 10 implies that 8 leaves invariant so 1 and 2 are free however if 1 2 0 then l is lie if a 6 0 then an appropriate choice of makes 2 0 but r 11 l 11 so 10 implies that 8 leaves 1 invariant these algebras are classified in section 2 of table 5 3 4 2 3 case 3 r 0 1 0 0 applying relations 5 b and 5 c we find that the matrix l is of the form l 0 a 0 0 thus r and l are both nilpotent hence so is x which contradicts nilrad l a 2 therefore we find no permissible algebras in this case 4 3 leibniz algebras l 3 1 of non lie type solvable leibniz algebras l 3 1 of non lie type are 1 dimensional extensions of a 3 dimensional abelian nilradical similar to the previous section we begin classification by first considering the possible jordan canonical forms for 3 3 matrices again we arrange the eigenvalues so that the non zero eigenvalues if there are any come before zero eigenvalues the possible jordan canonical forms that 10 matrix r may take are as follows 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 14 a 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 14 b 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 14 c where 1 2 and 3 are not necessarily distinct as before by lemma 4 2 r must be singular this means that we can force at least one i to be zero if 1 6 0 then once we perform transformation 9 with g 1 1 the leading eigenvalue becomes 1 putting the result back in jordan form the following possibilities for r remain 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 14 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 15 where a 6 0 f 4 3 1 case 1 r 0 as before since r 0 we can use 8 to put l in jordan form if l is nilpotent one of the matrices in 14 then x is nilpotent which contradicts nilrad l a 3 thus we can assume l 11 6 0 and we can use 9 to make l 11 1 this means that 11 l can be written in the form of one of the matrices in 14 a 14 b or 14 c with 1 1 the resulting algebras are classified in table 5 3 4 3 2 case 2 r 0 1 0 0 using relations 5 b and 5 c we have that matrix l is of the form l 0 a b 0 0 0 0 c d if d 0 then l 3 0 and x is nilpotent which is a contradiction on the contrary if d 6 0 then ln 33 6 0 for all n so x is not nilpotent thus since d 6 0 we can use 8 to make d 1 if c 6 0 then we can use 7 with s 1 1 1 c to make c 1 note that we can use 8 to make 1 0 and unless a 1 and c 0 we can also make 2 0 the resulting algebras are classified in table 5 3 4 3 3 case 3 r 0 1 0 1 0 relations 5 b and 5 c give that matrix l is of the form l 0 1 a 0 0 1 0 0 0 thus both r and l are nilpotent hence so is x which contradicts nilrad l a 3 thus we find no new algebras in this case just as in section 4 2 3 4 3 4 case 4 r 1 0 0 using relations 5 b and 5 c we find that the matrix l is of the form l 1 a b c d at this point we can change the basis of span n 2 n 3 to put 12 a b c d in jordan form this leaves us with two possibilities for l 1 a b 1 a 1 a where a and b are not necessarily distinct if a or b is nonzero then by 10 an appropriate choice of in 8 will make the corresponding be zero additionally if a 0 in the second case choosing 2 3 makes 3 0 if a b 0 in the first case l r then our only constraint on is that 1 2 and 3 are not all zero or else l is lie however in this case we are free to interchange n 2 and n 3 hence 2 and 3 so we can assume 2 3 the resulting algebras are classified in table 5 3 4 3 5 case 5 r 1 a 0 here we assume a 6 0 using relations 5 b and 5 c we find that the matrix l is of the form l 1 a b if b 6 0 we can use 8 to make 3 0 but since r 11 l 11 r 22 l 22 0 by 10 we can not force 1 or 2 to be zero nor 3 if b 0 the resulting algebras are classified in table 5 3 4 3 6 case 6 r 1 1 1 0 using relations 5 b and 5 c we find that the matrix l is of the form l 1 1 1 a if a 6 0 we can use 8 to make 3 0 but by 10 we can not make 1 or 2 be zero the resulting algebras are classified in table 5 3 13 4 3 7 case 7 r 1 0 1 0 using relations 5 b and 5 c we find that the matrix l is of the form l 1 0 a 0 if a 6 1 we can use 8 to make 3 0 but by 10 we can not make 1 or 2 or 3 if a 1 be zero the resulting algebras are classified in table 5 3 5 2 dimensional extensions of a 2 the case of l r s which are r s dimensional leibniz algebras with an r dimensional abelian nilradical seems significantly more complex when s 1 this is also true in the lie case as seen in 15 so we narrow our focus to the case of 2 dimensional extensions of 2 dimensional abelian nilradicals the leibniz algebra l 2 2 has basis x 1 x 2 n 1 n 2 satisfying relations 2 4 a and 4 b as before we may select s so that r 1 is transformed into jordan canonical form therefore r 1 will be of the form 12 a or 12 b once r 1 is determined the structure of r 2 can likewise be determined based on other restrictions namely 5 a 5 b and 5 c in particular 5 c guarantees that if r 1 is nonsingular then r 1 l 1 and r 2 l 2 5 1 r 1 not diagonal we first consider r 1 of the form 12 b in this case since 1 6 0 r 1 is nonsingular by 5 c this implies that r 1 l 1 and r 2 l 2 so by 5 a we have 0 r 1 r 2 this implies that r 2 must be of the following form r 11 r 12 0 r 11 by our requirement for nilindipendence it must be true that 1 6 0 and r 11 6 0 however if 1 6 0 and r 11 6 0 then r 1 and r 2 will not be nilindependent so there are no leibniz algebras l 2 2 defined by r 1 of the form 12 b 14 5 2 r 1 diagonal we now consider r 1 of the form 12 a note here that since at least one of 1 or 2 must be nonzero we will specify that 1 6 0 due to the freedom of 2 we further divide such algebras into three cases 1 2 6 0 and 2 6 1 2 2 1 3 2 0 5 2 1 case 1 suppose that 2 6 0 and 2 6 1 then r 1 is invertible and we have that r 1 l 1 and r 2 l 2 by 5 c then by 5 a and since 1 6 2 r 2 is a diagonal matrix that is the products of x 1 and x 2 on a 2 are defined respectively by the matrices r 1 1 0 0 2 l 1 and r 2 1 0 0 2 l 2 where we are denoting r 11 by 1 and r 22 by 2 for ease of notation since 1 6 2 and x 1 x 2 are nilindependent using 9 we can take a linear combination of x 1 x 2 so that r 1 1 0 0 0 l 1 and r 2 0 0 0 1 l 2 applying lemma 3 1 we find that 0 for all therefore the solvable leibniz algebra l 2 2 with products of x 1 defined by the above assumptions on r 1 is also isomorphic to a lie algebra 5 2 2 case 2 suppose 2 1 6 0 then r 1 is invertible so by 5 c r 1 l 1 and r 2 l 2 since r 1 is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix we can use 7 to put r 2 in jordan form and r 1 will be left invariant then r 2 will be of form 12 a or 12 b but if r 2 11 r 2 22 then r 1 and r 2 will not be nilindependent a contradiction hence r 2 is a diagonal matrix with r 2 11 6 r 2 22 so either r 2 or r 2 plus a multiple of r 1 will have 15 r 2 11 and r 2 22 6 0 so we obtain an algebra from case 1 by interchanging r 1 and r 2 thus we find no new leibniz algebras in this case 5 2 3 case 3 suppose 2 0 then 5 b implies that l 1 and l 2 are diagonal applying 5 c with 2 1 we find that r 2 is upper triangular since r 1 and r 2 are nilinde pendent this implies that r 2 22 6 0 applying 5 c with other choices of and we find that r 1 l 1 and r 2 l 2 and r 2 is diagonal again either r 2 or r 2 plus a multiple of r 1 will have r 2 11 and r 2 22 6 0 so we obtain an algebra from case 1 and find no new leibniz algebras in this case 5 3 general result for solvable leibniz algebras l 2 2 by the allowable transfor mations 7 and 9 with the arguments given in 5 1 and 5 2 we have a general result on all solvable leibniz algebras of type l 2 2 theorem 5 1 all solvable leibniz algebras l 2 2 2 dimensional extensions of a 2 dimensional abelian nilradical are also lie algebras acknowledgements this work was completed as part of a undergraduate independent
