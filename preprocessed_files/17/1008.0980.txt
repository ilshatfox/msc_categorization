the relations between the feigin loktev conjecture on the dimension of graded tensor products of g t modules the kirillov reshetikhin conjecture the combinatorial m n conjecture their proofs for all simple lie algebras and a pentagon of identities which results from the proof keywords fusion products kr modules dedicated to t miwa on the occasion of his 60 th birthday 1 introduction this paper reviews work which followed 1 3 the author s fruitful collabora tion with t miwa and colleagues 4 5 this work was inspired by the work of feigin and loktev on fusion products 6 the series of results described here finally culminated in a proof 2 3 of the feigin loktev conjecture con cerning the graded character of the non level restricted fusion product in the case of special modules known as kirillov reshetikhin modules the purpose of this article is to make clear the sequence of connections and relations between the various results which lead to the proof the fusion product character first appeared in the 80 s in the work on the completeness conjecture for bethe ansatz states 7 for the general ized heisenberg models the completeness conjecture is one version of what later became known as the kirillov reshetikhin conjecture and involves the first appearance of an object called the generalized kostka polynomial the generalized kostka number gives the decomposition coefficients of tensor products of kr modules into irreducible components although much work was later published on the subject the conjecture in its original combina http arxiv org abs 1008 0980 v 1 october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 2 torial form counting solutions of the bethe equations was only proved to be true in special cases in other cases a similar but not manifestly positive formula 8 10 was shown to hold the key to proving both the kirillov reshetikhin conjecture and the feigin loktev conjecture is a combinatorial identity the equality of two polynomials in q one written as an alternating sum and the other as a sum of positive terms the deeper meaning of this identity remains myste rious but its proof 3 using purely combinatorial means finally implies several equalities proving the conjectures above for any simple lie algebras 1 1 the objects of interest we describe several objects and relations between their dimensions section 2 contains a fuller discussion of several of these as necessary 1 1 1 kirillov reshetikhin modules these are finite dimensional modules of the quantum affine algebra uq g or the yangian y g let g be a simple lie algebra of rank r with car tan matrix c consider the irreducible finite dimensional g module v with a highest weight which is a non negative multiple of a fundamen tal weight the yangian y g contains g as a subalgebra the irreducible y g module induced from v is called a kirillov reshetikhin module 7 it is finite dimensional and its g highest weight is that of v in the case where g an it is equal to v as a g module in other cases the restriction to a g module may or may not be irreducible but in that case v is always a component in the decomposition with multiplicity 1 and with the highest weight equivalently one may consider kirillov reshetikhin modules for the quantum affine algebra uq g and their similar decomposition into uq g modules 11 these are also referred to as kr modules we denote the kr modules by kr m where 1 r and m is a positive integer these have a g highest weight of the form m where is a fundamental weight of g the parameter is a complex number which is called the spectral parameter 1 1 2 chari s graded g t modules these are modules of the current algebra g t defined as a quotient of u n t by an ideal generated by relations 11 see equations 12 11 october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 3 the relations are the q 1 limits of the similar relations which hold in the quantum case for kirillov reshetikhin modules these modules also have a g highest weight equal to a multiple of one of the fundamental weights of g as in the quantum algebra case we denote this module by c m where the highest weight is again m 1 1 3 decomposition of tensor products we observe that by general deformation arguments the dimension of kr modules is bounded from above by that of chari s modules more precisely the decomposition coefficients of the kr modules and therefore their tensor products at generic values of the spectral parameters into irreducible g modules are bounded from above by those of chari s modules that is choose a sequence of non negative integers n n m 1 r m 0 and consider the multiplicities my n and m g t n defined by my n dimhomg mkr n m m v where v is the irreducible highest weight g module with highest weight and m g t n dimhomg mc n m m v here we omitted the dependence of the modules on the spectral parameter we assume that all spectral parameters are taken at generic values with respect to each other then we have the first inequality my n m g t n 1 which simply follows by general deformation arguments both are defined as quotients by some ideal and the ideal in the limit q 1 may be smaller than that for generic values of q 1 1 4 the combinatorial kr conjecture the m sum formula this is a conjecture that my n is equal to the number of bethe vectors the generalized inhomogeneous heisenberg spin chain has a hilbert space which is equal by definition to the tensor product of yangian modules hn m kr n m m october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 4 again the modules are taken at generic values of the spectral parameters that is pairwise not separated by an integer note that the model is also well defined for any other finite dimensional y g modules but no bethe ansatz solution is known generically this model has a bethe ansatz solution the completeness conjecture of kirillov and reshetikhin 7 states that there is a bethe vector for each g highest weight vector in hn in particular there is an explicit formula for the number of bethe vectors and in fact the authors wrote down a graded formula which we now know has a direct interpretation as a grading by the linearized energy function of the model although at the time the meaning of the refinement was unknown for the g highest weight the multiplicity is the number m n obtained as the q 1 limit of the following grading endowed formula 7 m n q m qq m n i m i p i m i q 2 where the sum is taken over the non negative integers m m i 1 r i 1 such that i m i m where m are integers fixed by the zero weight condition c m i n i 3 being the coefficient of in the weight note that this sum has only a finite number of non vanishing terms let us define b i j sign c min c j c i then the vacancy numbers p i are defined as p i i min i j n j bm i 4 and the quadratic form q m n is q m n 1 2 m p 5 the q binomial coefficient is defined as usual and in the limit q 1 becomes the usual binomial coefficient in particular the sum is taken over the restricted set of integers m such that p j 0 this provides a formula for the tensor multiplicities my n it was proved in several special cases using combinatorial means 7 12 16 in general a sim ilar but not equivalent formula was known to be true as explined below october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 5 1 1 5 the hkoty n sum formula for general lie algebras and for generic kr modules the following formula was conjectured 8 my n lim q 1 n n q 6 where n n q is a modified form of the formula 2 obtained by simply removing the restriction p j 0 both the usual and the q binomial coef ficients are defined when p j 0 but they carry a sign in that case the authors conjectured after extensive testing that all terms coming from sets m such that p j 0 for some j cancel so that m n q n n q 7 the conjecture 6 holds provided that the so called q system 7 is sat isfied by the characters of kr modules it was shown by nakajima for simply laced algebras 9 and hernandez for all other lie algebras 17 that the q characters of kr modules satisfy the more general t system 18 from which the q system follows hence equation 6 had achieved the status of a theorem 1 1 6 feigin loktev fusion products the feigin loktev fusion product is a graded g t module 6 which is a refine ment of the usual tensor product of g module cyclic finite dimensional one chooses a finite dimensional cyclic g module v from which one induces an action of the current algebra g t localized at some complex number more specifically one defines a graded tensor product by choosing n g modules vi each with a cyclic vector vi localized at n distinct points in cp one then defines the fusion product as the associated graded space of the filtered space generated by the action of u g t on the tensor product of cyclic vectors with the grading defined by degree in t this is a graded space and the graded components are g modules feigin and loktev conjectured that the fusion product as a graded space is independent of the localization parameters for sufficiently well behaved g modules moreover they conjectured a relation between the graded co efficients of the g module v in the fusion product and the generalized kostka polynomials 19 this conjecture was proved for sl 2 in 5 and in greater generality in several other works in particular in 2 we proved the following inequality using techniques generalized from 5 let f n be the fusion product of the modules c m with october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 6 multiplicity n m this is a graded space we define the q dimension to be the hilbert polynomial of the graded space then q dimhomg f n v m n q 8 where m n is the fermionic formula of kirillov and reshetikhin for the number of bethe vectors in the generalized inhomogeneous heisenberg spin chain corresponding to kr modules kr m with the same multiplicities remark 1 1 the inequality in 8 arises from the following sequence of maps one may completely characterize the dual space of functions of the fusion product in terms of symmetric functions with certain zeros and poles we do this in section 3 actual calculation of the hilbert polynomial of this space requires another injective mapping into another filtered space whose hilbert polynomial is the polynomial m n q we do not prove the surjectivity of the map resulting in the inequality in equation 8 moreover the space f n is the associated graded space of the tensor product of chari modules which are defined as a quotient of u g t by a certain ideal again by a general deformation argument we have that dimhomg c n i i v dimhomg f n v note that the sum on the right hand side of equation 8 is manifestly positive and therefore if in the q 1 limit it is equal to the tensor product multiplicity then we have the equality of graded spaces also since the left hand side has a dimension which is greater than or equal to the tensor product multiplicity by the deformation argument 1 2 a pentagon of identities we have a sequence of identities and inequalities homg m c n m m v homg f n v m n final step homuq g m kr n m m v n n the final step remaining in this pentagon was to prove the conjec tured identity 7 the proof turns all the inequalities in the pentagon october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 7 to equalities this conjecture was proven by combinatorial means 3 for all simple lie algebras therefore this provides a proof of the completeness problem in the bethe ansatz known as the kirillov reshetikhin conjecture as well as the feigin loktev conjecture for the cases of kirillov reshetikhin conjecture 1 3 plan of the paper in the following sections we will summarize the proof 2 of the inequality 8 and the proof of the m n conjecture 3 in section 2 we give a definition of the feigin loktev fusion product of chari s modules in section 3 we summarize the proof of the inequality 8 which is obtained via a functional realization of the multiplicity space following the ideas of b feigin in section 4 we explain the combinatorial proof of the m n conjecture 3 2 definitions here we add some details to the definitions of the representation theoretical objects which are important in the theorems below let g be a simple lie algebra of rank r and cartan matrix c let g t g c t be the corresponding lie algebra of polynomials in t with coefficients in g 2 1 finite dimensional g t modules and the fusion action given a complex number any g module v can be extended to a g t module evaluation module v with t evaluated at the generators x n x tn x g act on v v as x n v nxv the dimension of the evaluation module is the same as that of v if v is irreducible as a g module so is v more generally given a g t module v the g t module localized at v is the module on which g t acts by expansion in the local parameter t t if v v then x n v x t nv j n j jx n j v where x n x t and x n acts on v v in the same way that x n acts on v v another way to write this is in terms of generating functions for any october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 8 x g x z n z x n z n 1 then if c x n 1 2 i z z nx z dz 9 we will also need to be able to localize modules at infinity in that case x n 1 2 i z z nx z dz 1 2 i z 0 zn 2 x z 1 dz 10 an evaluation module v is a special case of a localized module on which the positive modes x n with n 0 and x g act trivially let v be a cyclic g t module with cyclic vector v then v is endowed with a g equivariant grading inherited from the grading of u u g t the filtred components of v are f n u nv where u n is the subspace of homogeneous degree in t bounded by n the grading on v is the associated graded space of this filtration n 0 f n f n 1 as the filtration is g equivariant the graded components are g modules 2 2 chari s kr modules of g t a special case of the construction described in the previous subsection is given as follows consider g t modules with a highest weight m m 0 and a fundamental g weight defined as the cyclic module generated by a highest weight vector v with relations x n v 0 if x n and n 0 h n v n 0 mv f n v 0 if n 11 f 0 m 1 v 0 12 we refer to these modules as c m 11 their graded version has been previously considered by chari and moura 20 the graded components of the associated graded space corresponding to the filtration by homogeneous degree are of course g modules except in the case of g ar these modules are not necessarily irre ducible under restriction to the action of g however c m does have a highest weight component isomorphic to the g module v m which october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 9 appears with multiplicity 1 all other components having a smaller highest weights in the total ordering it has not been directly proven except in special cases that these mod ules have the same g decomposition as the yangian kr modules but this theorem will follow from the proof of the feigin loktev conjecture below 2 3 fusion products and the fegin loktev conjecture consider a set of cyclic g t modules v 1 1 vn n localized at pair wise distinct points in c 1 n denote the chosen cyclic vector of vi i by vi if vi i are finite dimensional so is the space u g t v 1 vn moreover it has a finite filtration by homogeneous degree in t the feigin loktev fusion product 6 is the associated graded space of this filtration we denote the fusion product by f v as the grading of f v is g equivariant the graded components are g modules the graded multiplicity of the irreducible g module v in the fusion product is a certain polyno mial generating function for the multiplicities in the graded components the feigin loktev conjecture is that this polynomial is independent of the localization parameters i for sufficiently well behaved g modules and that in the case that vi are kr modules the graded multiplicity of v is equal to the m sum formula 2 the equality was proven for sl 2 modules in 5 and for symmetric power representations of sln in 21 in this paper we consider only fusion products of kr modules they are generated by the highest weight vector v localized at and the relations are those in 12 let v v 1 vn be a collection of kr modules of g t localized at distinct complex numbers 1 n we parametrize the collection v by their highest weights n n j 1 r j 0 meaning that in v there are exactly n j kr modules with highest weight j we call this fusion product f n 3 functional realization of fusion spaces we make use of the fact that g t g therefore given a g t module v we can consider the integrable modules induced at some fixed integer level k we choose k to be sufficiently large so that the tensor products we consider below have a decomposition determined by the littelwood richardson rule rather than the verlinde rule we choose integrable g modules since they have the property that they are completely reducible note that smaller values of k are also of interest and computing the graded fusion product at finite k is still an open problem for the most part october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 10 consider the action of products of generating functions of elements of the affine algebra g on the tensor product of highest weight vectors vi of kr modules localized at distinct points i we use the generating fuctions f t n z f n t n 1 where f is the element of n corresponding to the simple root we define f n hom f n v where n parametrizes the set of kr modules in the fusion product the dual space of f n is the associated graded space of c n consisting of all correlation functions the form u f 1 t 1 f m tm v 1 vn 13 here m 0 and 1 m i m r where ir 1 r the action of the currents is the fusion action of the previous section the vector u is the lowest weight vector of the module v localized at dual to the highest weight module localized at 0 with g highest weight this space has a filtration by the homogeneous degree in tj and its associated graded space is the graded multiplicity space of the g module v in the fusion product f n 3 1 characterization of functions in c n we now fix and n and characterize functions in the space c n according to their symmetry pole and zero structure 2 1 zero weight condition the correlation function 13 is g invariant therefore it must have total g weight equal to 0 which means that 0 j c m j j jn j 1 r 14 where this fixes m 1 m r for convenience we rename the variables to keep track of the root of the generating function in which they appear thus we have functions in the variables t 1 tm t i ir 1 i m where m is the number of generators with root note that the space c n is the direct sum of spaces of the with fixed m m 1 m r 2 pole structure functions in c n have at most a simple pole when t i t j if c 0 this is due to the relations in the algebra which in the language of generating functions means that f t f u f t t u non singular terms we are therefore led to define the less singular function g t for each f t c n g t c 0 i j t i t j f t f t c n 15 october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 11 3 symmetry the function g t is symmetric under the exchange t i t j this is due to the fact that f t 1 f t 2 0 4 serre condition let be simple roots such that c 0 and define m 1 c then there is a serre relation in g hence a corresponding relation in g of the form ad f m f 0 in generat ing function language f t 1 f t m t t 1 has no singularity when all the variables are set equal to each other this implies that the function g t of 15 has the following vanishing property g t t 1 t m t 1 0 this cancels out the pole which would otherwise appear in the function f t 5 degree restriction as u is a lowest weight vector of the module localized at infinity positive currents f n with n 0 act on it trivially the action is given by taking the contour integral at infinity see equation 10 or equivalently a residue taken at 0 that is there should be no residue when integrating tn 2 f t 1 with n 0 at t 0 this gives a degree restriction on the function f t c n for each of the variables deg t i f t 2 6 poles at i the relation 11 implies that f t c n may have a simple pole at t i j only if the highest weight of the module localized at j is a multiple of in accordance with the equation 9 otherwise f n iv i 0 if n 0 moreover we have 7 integrability condition we assume each module vk has high est weight k k the relation 12 requires that g 2 t j k t j k k g t has the following vanishing property g 2 t t 1 t k 1 k 0 these conditions characterize the space c n completely the only dif ficulty is to compute its hilbert polynomial this is done by introducing another filtration on the space of functions the idea for such a filtration was first introduced by feigin and stoyanovsky 22 october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 12 3 2 filtration of the space of functions let 1 r where is a partition of m let m a denote the number of parts of equal to a thus a am a m fix a standard tableau for each partition the result is independent of the choice of tableaux and when we discuss a partition below we always refer to the fixed tableau and define the evaluation map ev c n m 1 m r h where h is the space of functions in several variables one variable for each row of each partition in the evaluation map is defined as follows if the letter i appears in the jth row of length a in then ev t i u a j this is extended by linearity to c n we order multipartitions lexicographically and define ker ev this gives a finite filtration of c n with if we consider the image of the graded components ker ev under the evaluation map ev again this is a space of functions isomorphic to a subspace of h let us denote its image by h its characterization is as follows 1 symmetry functions in are symmetric in the variables t 1 t m for each the full symmetry is lost under the eval uation map but the functions are still symmetric with respect to the variables labeled by rows of the same length in that is they are symmetric with respect to the exchange of variables u a 1 u a m a for each a 2 functions in are in the kernel of any evaluation ev with which means that functions in the image vanish whenever we set the variables corresponding to different rows of the same partition equal to each other in fact one can prove that lemma 3 1 functions in h have a factor u a j u a k 2 min a b for all j k 3 pole structure and serre condition the pole at t i t j when c 0 together with the vanishing condition of g t which follows from from the serre relation implies that functions in h have a pole of order at most min c b c a whenever u a i u b j inherited from conditions 1 and 3 of the previous subsection october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 13 4 poles at j the pole at t i j in case vj has highest weight propor tional to together with the integrability of that module translate to the following statement for f h there is a pole of order at most min a at u a i j if vj has a highest weight equal to j we define j 1 if the highest weight of vj is a multiple of and j 0 otherwise 5 degree restriction functions in h have a degree in u a j which is bounded from above by 2 a we do not know that these are all the conditions on functions in h the map ev is injective by definition but not necessarily surjective how ever we can compute the hilbert polynomial of the space f defined by the conditions above which gives an upper bound on the hilbert polynomial of h to summarize we know that f u f has the form a i 6 b j u a i u b j min a b f 0 u a i j u a i j j min j a a i b j c 0 u a i u b j min c b c a where f 0 u is a polynomial in u symmetric under the exchange u a i u a j of degree such that deg u a j f u 2 a to compute the hilbert polynomial we set all j 0 so that the function above is homogeneous in u that is we compute the hilbert polynomial of the associated graded space it is very important to note that the values of j do not affect the value of the hilbert polynomial that is there is no change in the q dimensions of the space when we take the associated graded space the degree in u a j of the prefactor of f 0 u is 2 a p a where p a is defined in equation 4 moreover the overall homogeneous degree of the prefactor is q m n as defined in equation 5 the hilbert polynomial of the space of symmetric functions in m variables of degree less than or equal october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 14 to p is the q binomial coefficient m p m q m p i 1 1 qi m i 1 1 qi p i 1 1 qi therefore the hilbert polynomial of f is qq m n j m j p j m j q which is the upper bound at each degree in q of the hilbert polynomial of h since it is a polynomial with positive coefficients summing over the graded components there follows the main theorem theorem 3 1 2 the hilbert polynomial of c n which is the feigin loktev fusion product of kr modules is bounded from above by m n q defined in equation 2 4 proof of the m n conjecture in this section we explain the proof 3 of the identity 7 for ease of read ability we explain the technique explicitly for the lie algebra sl 2 and then state the key ingredients necessary in the generalization to arbitrary lie algebras the only difficulty in this generalization is the rapid proliferation of indices 4 1 the case of sl 2 as explained in the introduction one need only prove the m n identity only for the case q 1 for the pentagon of identities to hold due to the positivity of the m sum in the case of sl 2 we drop the root superscript in the vacancy numbers p i and so forth fix n n 1 nk z k and an sl 2 highest weight 1 with z consider the following generating function z k n x 0 x 1 m nk x q 0 1 x q 1 0 k i 1 mi qi mi 16 here we have defined qi k j i 1 j i 2 mj nj i 0 october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 15 in particular notice that when q 0 0 qi pi for all i 0 the binomial coefficient is defined as usual m p m m p m p this is well defined for both negative and positive values of p and when p 0 it has an overall sign 1 m this n sum can be obtained from this generating function as follows first here and below we note that in the n and m sums mj 0 if j k in 2 however all the identities we prove are valid under this restriction since only a finite number of the mj make a non trivial contribution to the summation 2 one can take k at the end of the day with no loss of generality second in both the n and m sums there is a weight restriction restriction on the m summation this is equivalent to setting q 0 or alternatively considering only the constant term in x 1 in the generating function expression we do not restrict the sum to pi 0 yet but in the m and n sums the variable x 0 must be set to 1 lemma 4 1 there is a recursion relation z k n 1 nk x 0 x 1 xn 1 21 x 0 x 2 z k 1 n 2 nk x 1 x 2 where xi are solutions of the a 1 q system or cluster algebra mutation 23 with arbitrary boundary conditions xi 1 xi 1 x 2 i 1 i z proof the variable m 1 is not part of the expression for q 1 so we can perform the summation over m 1 using the identity m 1 0 x 2 m 11 m 1 q 1 m 1 x 21 x 21 1 q 1 1 x 21 x 0 x 2 q 1 1 where we have used the q system in the second equality we separate out the dependence on m 1 in the summand and note that 2 qi qi 1 2 mi ni qi 1 moreover if we denote by q j i the function qi with arguments being of the last j i variables in the list m 1 mk so that q k i qi then q k 1 i q k i 1 or q k 1 i 1 q k i october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 16 we have z k n 1 nk x 0 x 1 m 1 mk x q 0 1 x q 1 0 k j 1 mj qj mj m 2 mk x q 1 0 j 2 mj qj mj x n 1 q 2 2 q 1 1 m 1 x 2 m 11

k 1 on q 0 q 1 means we take these variables as defined for the k 1 variables with indices 2 k using the lemma by induction we see that the generating function factorizes z k n x 0 x 1 x 1 x 1 k x 0 x 1 k 1 k i 1 xnii 17 in particular z k n x 0 x 1 z p 1 0 n 1 np x 0 x 1 z k p 1 np 1 nk xp 1 xp 18 we are interested in the constant term in x 1 in z k n x 0 x 1 we use the factorization lemma for the first factor and the definition via summation for the second factor z k n x 0 x 1 x 1 xp 1 x 0 xp p 1 j 1 x nj j mp mk x qp 1 p x qp p 1 k j p mj qj mj 19 suppose we restrict the summation in the second factor to qp 0 only moreover we are interested in the generating function when x 0 1 in this case all xi are polynomials in x 1 chebyshev polynomials of the second type terms in the summation in which qp 1 0 are therefore products of polynomials in x 1 since there are no factors of xi in the denominator in this case moreover there is an overall factor of x 1 so that there is no constant term in x 1 in this case thus october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 17 lemma 4 2 if the summation over mp mk in 19 is restricted to qp 0 then only terms with qp 1 0 contribute to the constant term in x 1 when x 0 1 we use an induction argument where the base step is clear qk to conclude that the only terms which contribute to the constant term in x 1 are terms from the restricted summation qi 0 i 0 when q 0 0 this is the n m identity since qi pi in that case 4 2 the simply laced case this case is a straightforward generalization of the sl 2 case a we now define the generating function z k n x 0 x 1 m x q 1 0 x q 0 1 j m j q j m j as is the norm when x and q represent vectors indexed by the same set we write xq for the product over the components here r 1 n n j ir j ik the summation is over m m j ir j ik non negative integers and we define q i k j i 1 ir j i c m j n j when q 0 0 for all this corresponds to the weight restriction 3 in the m and n sums and in that case q i p i if i 0 we have now 2 r variables x 0 x 1 0 xr 0 and x 1 x 1 1 xr 1 the generating function is related to the m or n sums when we evaluate the sum at x 0 1 and consider the constant term in x 1 following the steps outlined for sl 2 we derive a recursion relation for the generating function z k n x 0 x 1 x 2 n 11 x 0 x 2 z k 1 n k 1 x 1 x 2 where n k 1 is n with n 1 0 here we have defined x i to be the solutions of the following system x i 1 x i 1 x 2 i c 1 x i abelow we have two sets of indices for x n etc when we write x 0 we mean the collection of r elements x 1 0 xr 0 and so forth october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 18 this is called the q system for the simply laced lie algebra g provided we set the initial conditions x 0 1 otherwise it is a cluster algebra muta tion 23 and therefore under these special initial conditions all its solutions are polynomials in the variables x 1 24 we again repeat the arguments of the previous section to factorize the generating function z k n x 0 x 1 x 1 x 1 k x 0 x 1 k 1 k j 1 x n j j from which we deduce that z k n x 0 x 1 x 1 xp 1 x 0 xp p 1 j 1 x nj j m p x qp 1 p x qp p 1 k j p mj qj qj here m p are the last k p 1 components of the list m 1 mk a bino mial coefficient with vector entries is notation for the product of binomial coefficients over the components suppose we restrict the summation to m p such that q p 0 for some and such that q p 1 0 for the same we look for a contribution to the constant term in x 1 all xi are polynomials in x 1 after evaluation at x 0 1 for all terms with q p 0 do not have a factor x p in the denominator and are therefore polynomials in x i for several i and fixed one can show that 6 x 1 p has no negative powers of x 1 see 3 lemma 4 8 therefore we have a polynomial in x 1 with an overall power of x 1 hence there is no constant term in x 1 we repeat this argument for each and inductively for each p starting from p k until we get lemma 4 3 there is no contribution to the constant term in x 1 in the summation from terms with q j 0 for any p j hence from terms with p j 0 when we consider the terms with q 0 0 this implies that m n for the simply laced lie algebras 4 3 the non simply laced case this case is less elegantly derived as it requires the introduction of even more variables in the generating function and each case must be treated separately nevertheless the argument goes through in the same more involved manner in the process we must define the set of variables which october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim

algebra with cartan matrix c and it is known to be satisfied by the characters x i of the kr modules kr i if x 1 is the character of the fundamental module we find in the k limit that theorem 4 1 3 for any simple lie algebra and a dominant weight n a vector in zr k m n n n 5 summary prior to the work described in the previous section it was known that for any simple lie algebra the multiplicity of the uq g module with g highest weight in the tensor product of kirillov reshetikhin modules is the n sum formula this followed theorems of hatayama et al 8 and nakajima s theorem about the q characters for t systems corresponding to simply laced lie algebras 9 as well as the extension by hernandez for other algebras 10 we now have all the equalities in the pentagon of identities that is since we have proven that m n we have proven also the following corollary 5 1 the multiplicity of the g module v in the tensor product of chari s kr modules of g t is equal to the multiplicity of the uq g module with g highest weight in the corresponding tensor product of uq g of kirillov reshetikhin type corollary 5 2 the hilbert polynomial of the graded multiplicity space of v in the feigin loktev fusion product is the fermionic m sum gen eralized kostka polynomials in the case of an this is the feigin loktev conjecture corollary 5 3 the bethe integer sets parametrizing bethe vectors in the generalized heisenberg model as solved by kirillov and reshetikhin are in bijection with vectors in the hilbert space of the model and therefore the completeness conjecture holds october 11 2018 21 38 wspc proceedings trim size 9 in x 6 in fusionreview 20 we should remark that although it is well known that not all bethe states come from the so called string hypothesis in these models nevertheless this gives a good counting of the states the proof described in the previous section shows that the vanishing of the non positive components of the n sum formula is due to the fact that the solutions of the q system with the kr boundary condition are polynomials in the initial data x 1 this fact is clear once one refers to the theorem that the solutions x n with n 0 are characters of kr modules which are in the grothendieck group generated by x 1 1 xr 1 the characters of the r fundamental representations however these facts are not immediately obvious without resorting to the proven theorems on the subject the cluster algebra formulation of the q system gives an en tirely combinatorial interpretation for this fact 23 24 the polynomiality property is quite general for a much larger class of cluster algebras under even more general boundary conditions which give a certain vanishing of the numerators 24 for example the same property holds for the t systems 6
