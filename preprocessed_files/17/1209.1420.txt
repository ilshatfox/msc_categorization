an algebra 50 vi abstract lattice filtrations for g 2 of a p adic field by paul tokorcheck in this work we aim to describe in significant detail certain filtrations and sequences of lattices inside of the split octonion algebra o when o is constructed over the field qp there are several reasons why one would like to consider such lattice filtrations not the least of which is the connec tion that they have to certain filtrations of subgroups of the automorphism group g 2 aut o it is an eventual goal to try to uncover previously unknown supercuspidal representa tions of g 2 by examining representations of the subgroups making up these subgroup filtrations which are known as moy prasad filtrations when g 2 is constructed over qp each of the filtration subgroups will be compact and open and normal in the previous subgroup in the filtration so that the respective quotients are all finite groups a basic strategy then is to identify representa tions of these finite quotients extend them to representations of the filtration subgroups and then induce them to representations of the whole group g 2 to understand the lattice filtrations that identify the moy prasad filtration subgroups the work of w t gan and j k yu in 7 is indispensable in their article they draw connec tions between certain lattice filtrations octonion orders maximinorante norms and points in the bruhat tits building b g 2 their main idea was to use the norm preserving quadratic form in herent in o along with the natural 8 dimensional representation of g 2 aut o to create a canonical embedding of the building into b so o since the latter building had been previ ously described as the set of maximinorante norms on o they arrived at an explicit description of b g 2 in terms of certain maximinorante norms and orders in o the present work then attempts to describe all of these structures in detail beginning with general composition algebras and the construction of the group g 2 then we will construct the bruhat tits building b g 2 via the coroot lattice of type g 2 though we will mainly concern ourselves only with the standard apartment in b g 2 finally we will define our lattice filtrations and draw the connections between them and points b g 2 outlined in 7 which will reveal the action of the group g 2 on its own building along the way we identify many important structures and facts about the group itself vii preface this document contains the entire content of the author s ph d dissertation written at uc santa cruz and submitted on 14 june 2012 though the title page

patience i am very lucky to have been his student x part i part i general fields 1 chapter 1 introduction in part i we will review the general theory of composition algebras over a field k and their k algebra automorphisms composition algebras come in several different shapes and sizes but we generally refer to those of dimension 8 as octionion or cayley algebras this will lead us to an initial definition definition 1 0 1 if o is an octonion algebra over a field k the group g 2 o is the group of k algebra automorphisms of o however the nomenclature we use implies that when constructed over the field k c the group g 2 should be associated to the exceptional complex semi simple lie algebra g 2 a priori this connection is far from obvious we deal with this connection in chapters 4 and 5 where we first describe the chevalley construction of a group of lie type from a lie algebra and then identify particular automorphisms of our octonion algebra which act as the chevalley generators of the group these associations between automorphisms and chevalley elements will later allow us to describe other structures in g 2 very explicitly we will also be able to calculate certain structure constants for g 2 by specifying a choice and ordering of the generators though we will later take k to be the local non archimedean field k qp the results discussed in part i are more general therefore we may take k to be any field of characteristic not equal to 2 2 chapter 2 composition algebras and the octonions 2 1 objects taking k to be an arbitrary field of characteristic not 2 we use standard notation from vector calculus namely the symbols and k will denote the standard unit vectors in k 3 while and will denote the usual dot product and cross product we begin with a preliminary definition definition 2 1 1 a composition algebra v is a unital k algebra 1 which is further endowed with a quadratic form n v k with the following properties a n is multiplicative b n is nondegenerate that is the associated symmetric bilinear form b is nondegenerate where b is defined by b v w 1 2 n v w n v n w the quadratic form n is called the norm of the composition algebra v 2 1 we do not require v to be either commutative or associative 2 though term norm in this context is standard we point out that n is not a norm in the analytic sense of a normed vector space in fact since n maps into an arbitrary field k which will not be ordered in general concepts such as positive definite or triangle inequality are unlikely to have any meaning in our context conversely the standard norms placed on vector spaces are generally not quadratic 3 the nondegenerate quadratic form n places quite a bit of structure on v for example the bilinear form b can be used to define orthogonality in v in the sense that v w v are called orthogonal if b v w 0 the quadratic form n also leads to the following structures definition 2 1 2 let v be a composition algebra with norm n then we have also a trace defined on v v by t v n v 1 n v n 1 2 b v 1 and an involution defined on v v by v t v 1 v lemma 2 1 1 we have the following facts about the identity a n 1 1 b b 1 1 12 n 2 1 2 n 1 1 2 4 n 1 2 n 1 1 c t 1 2 b 1 1 2 d 1 t 1 1 1 1 proof all statements follow directly from the definitions we next justify the terminology used in our last definition and verify a few other facts lemma 2 1 2 let v be any composition algebra then for all v w v a both the trace and involution are linear b the subalgebra of v fixed by the involution is equal to k 1 c t v 1 v v d v v e vw w v f b v w 1 2 t vw b vw 1 g n v 1 vv h v 2 t v v n v 1 0 proof all statements and their proofs can be found in either 11 or 20 4 looking carefully at lemma 2 1 2 we see that all of the other structures n t and b can be described solely in terms of the involution however it is still necessary for the resulting n and b to satisfy the properties of definition 2 1 1 if v is to be considered a composition algebra we now describe a number of examples of compositions algebras a the field k itself is a composition algebra of dimension 1 with quadratic form n v v 2 trace given by t v 2 v and trivial involution this norm is clearly multiplicative and nondegenerate b the vector space k k is an two dimensional k algebra under component wise multiplica tion with identity 1 1 1 the norm form n is given by n a b ab which is again multiplicative and non degenerate making this a composition algebra the trace is given by t a b a b and the involution is given by a b b a note that this algebra is both associative and commutative c perhaps the most well known composition algebra is the algebra of 2 2 matrices over a field k mat 2 k here n is given by the determinant which gives rise to the usual trace and involution on mat 2 k a b c d d b c a it is well known that the determinant is multiplicative for non degeneracy note that for v w mat 2 k b v w 1 2 det v w det v det w 0 implies that det v w det v det w but since the determinant is not an additive homomorphism for this to be true for all v mat 2 k we have w 0 necessarily therefore mat 2 k is a composition algebra and all the appropriate relations are satisfied between these structures note that this algebra is associative but not commutative d zorn s octonions 22 o are given as a set by o a v w d a d k and v w k 3 addition in this set is defined in the regular way entry wise and it also has a multiplica tion given by a v w d a v a v w w v d w 5 the identity is the usual 1 1 0 0 1 and o is also equipped with a necessary norm which is analogous to the determinant in mat 2 k n a v w d ad v w it follows directly from definition 3 that the trace t on o is the usual trace defined as the sum of the diagonal entries and the involution is a v w d d v w a showing that this quadratic norm form determinant is multiplicative is straightforward and requires only the identity v w v w v w showing that n is nondegenerate is similar to example c b a v w d 0 implies that n a v w d n a v w d n which implies that a d v w 0 this will be true for arbitrary a d k and v w k 3 if and only if 0 k and 0 k 3 the algebra o is therefore a composition algebra note that this algebra is neither associative nor commutative however it is alternative in the sense of the definition below definition 2 1 3 a k algebra v is called alternative if for all v w v we have v vw vv w v ww vw w v wv vw v equivalently v is alternative if for all v w v the subalgebra generated by v and w is associative definition 2 1 4 a composition algebra is called split if it contains zero divisors otherwise it is called non split 6 since it is not difficult to find zero divisors in each of the examples 2 4 above they are all examples of split composition algebras however there are examples of composition alge bras which are not split such as the field c of complex numbers hamilton s quaternions h or graves octonions og all of which are normed division algebras and may be constructed using the cayley dickson construction from k r 2 2 morphisms definition 2 2 1 let v n and v n be two composition algebras we call f v n v n a morphism of composition algebras if it is a morphism of algebras from v to v which additionally preserves the norm form n n f v n v v v while this is a perfectly fine definition we can also prove that this is always the case any morphism of algebras will necessarily preserve n as outlined in the following theorem theorem 2 2 1 let v n and v n be two composition algebras and f v n v n be a morphism of composition algebras then n f v n v for all v v proof with the hypotheses of our theorem we choose v v suppose first that v k 1 v in this case f as an algebra morphism acts trivially on v and in both v and v the norm of v is just n v vv v 2 thus f preserves the norm in this case suppose now that v k 1 examine the ideal i p k x p v 0 v note that i contains no nonzero elements of deg p 1 else v k 1 since k x is a pid i pv for some monic polynomial pv k x in fact by lemma 2 h the characteristic polynomial v 2 t v v n v 1 is in i and this must be the unique polynomial equal to pv else you could subtract the two monic polynomials and the result would be linear in i if we apply the algebra morphism f to pv we find that f 0 f v 2 t v v n v 1 f v 2 t v f v n v 1 0 therefore n v is also the constant term of the characteristic polynomial of f v v and our statement follows therefore morphisms of algebras and morphisms of composition algebras are equiva lent concepts and the category of composition algebras and their morphisms is actually a full subcategory of the k algebras 7 now it happens that the examples of split composition algebras listed in section 2 1 are each embedded in the next as composition algebras k k k mat 2 k o for example we have the diagonal embedding 1 v 7 v v of k into k k the other diagonal embedding of k k into mat 2 k may be given by 2 a b 7 a 0 0 b since 1 must preserve the identity but must also be linear 1 is unique however the embedding 2 is not unique nor are the embeddings mat 2 k o in the latter case we may choose any unit vector u k 3 i e having u u 1 to yield an embedding 3 a b c d 7 a b u c u d it is easily verified that all of these maps are injective algebra morphisms and hence they preserve the respective forms n in the last map we will often choose u to be equal to one of the standard basis vectors or k when necessary we will specify our choice of embedding by writing mat 2 k mat 2 k k mat 2 k as appropriate 2 3 generating and decomposing composition algebras the goal of this section is to describe how a composition algebra can be decomposed into a composition algebra of smaller dimension and its orthogonal complement we will use this decomposition later to describe certain automorphisms of o whose action is defined by the choice of decomposition a secondary goal is to classify all possible composition algebras by their dimension and by whether or not they are split this will help clarify the question of which g 2 we refer to at any given time toward these ends we will describe how to generate a new composition algebra from an given one using a variation of the cayley dickson construction as always we will refer to our set of examples for insight let v n be any composition algebra with its usual structure given by the norm form n we form the space w v vl where at this point l is simply a formal variable for any nonzero k multiplication in w is given by 11 a bl c dl ac db da bc l 8 note that in our previous examples of split composition algebras we have taken 1 if we take 1 this is simply the familiar caley dickson construction which can be used with k r to construct the normed division algebras c h and og proposition 2 3 1 the map a bl 7 a bl defines an involution on w proof the map clearly has order two and is k linear since a is linear on v we also have a bl c dl a bl c dl a c db da bc l ca bd bc da l ca bd bc da l ca bd bc da l c dl a bl we often write a bl a bl but note that there are two distinct involutions present in this expression one on v and one on w thus if we associate v a bl w b 0 the involutions on v and w will coincide definition 2 3 1 we define a norm form nw w ww for all w w and therefore a trace tw and bilinear form bw constructed as we described previously it is immediate that nw is multiplicative as nw vw vwvw vww v vnw w v nw w vv nw v nw w however at this point we do not yet know that the associated bw is non degenerate in fact this will not always be the case and thus algebras w constructed in this way may or may not be composition algebras nevertheless we collect here a number of facts about w which we will have occasion to use later we will neglect the subscript on our maps n b or t when the context is clear lemma 2 3 1 for all a v we have al la proof let v w be arbitrary we have that n v 1 vv 1 which we can linearize v as v a b and n a b 1 a b a b 1 aa ab ba bb 1 9 implies that 2 b a b 1 ab 1 ba 1 therefore if we choose a to be from v and b l then b a l 0 and l l and 0 al 1 la 1 lemma 2 3 2 for all a b v we have that ab l b al and l ab lb a proof let v w w be arbitrary using the same arguments as the last lemma we use the alter native property of w to write n v w vv w v vw which we can linearize as v c d and n c d w c d c d w c d cw dw c cw c dw d cw d dw cc w c dw d cw dd w implies that 2 b c d w c dw d cw now we can again choose c w v and d l so that 0 2 b c l w c lw l cw c lw l cw c wl cw l which implies that c wl wc l our statement follows and the second statement is obtained by taking conjugates of the first lemma 2 3 3 we have the following identities on the element l w a l 2 b bl bl for every b v 10 c tw bl bl bl 0 d nw bl blbl blbl bbl 2 nv b proof all are immediate from the definitions and previous lemmas lemma 2 3 4 suppose that w is a composition algebra i e that bw is nondegenerate associate v a bl w b 0 and vl a bl w a 0 then vl v proof for a v and bl vl we have bw a bl n a bl n a n bl a bl a bl aa nv b a bl a bl aa nv b aa b b ba ba l aa nv b 0 therefore vl v now suppose that w v write w a bl v w then bw w v bw a bl v bw a v bw bl v bw a v and this last expression equals zero if and only if a 0 by nondegeneracy of bw therefore vl v from these considerations when the constructed w is a composition algebra we may write w v vl and this sum is both direct and orthogonal however we have not yet determined the conditions under which nw will be nondegenerate the following theorem was originally proven by a hurwitz in 9 in the case of the normed division algebras over r but has since been extended to include arbitrary fields theorem 2 3 1 all composition algebras are obtained by repeated doubling starting from k 1 composition algebras of dimension 1 or 2 are commutative and associative those of dimension 4 are associative but not commutative and those of dimension 8 are alternative but neither commutative nor associative the constructed norm nw on w will be nondegenerate if and only if v was associative therefore the possible dimensions of a composition algebra are 1 2 4 and 8 proof for general fields proofs of these statements may be found in either 11 13 or 20 11 with this result for a fixed field k we may now refer to composition algebras of di mension 2 as quadratic k algebras and denote them by k composition algebras of dimension 4 as quaternion k algebras and denote them by b and composition algebras of dimension 8 as cayley or octonion k algebras and denote them by c we will continue to refer to general composition algebras as either v or w in our examples of split composition algebras we see that k k can indeed be decom posed in this way given a b k k we can write a b a b 2 a b 2 a b 2 a b 2 1 1 the splitting element l in this case is 1 1 and we can check that for all a b k and corre sponding a a b b 1 k k k b a a b b 1 1 1 2 t a a b b 1 2 t a a b b 1 2 t ab ab 1 2 ab ab 0 therefore the two images v vl are indeed orthogonal also we may associate k k with its image the diagonal matrices in mat 2 k and have the following decomposition a b c d a 0 0 d b 0 0 c 0 1 1 0 the splitting element here is l 0 1 1 0 finally we examine the algebra o here the splitting element will depend on the choice of embedding and for our three chosen embeddings with u equal to either or k we use respectively the splitting elements j 0 0 k 0 k k 0 i 0 0 again the images mat 2 k and mat 2 k j are orthogonal and respectively for the other choices of embedding explicitly an element of o may be decomposed in any of the following 12 ways a v 1 v 2 v 3 w 1 w 2 w 3 d a v 1 w 1 d v 2 w 3 v 3 w 2 0 0 2 1 a v 2 w 2 d v 3 w 1 v 1 w 3 0 k k 0 2 2 a v 3 k w 3 k d v 1 w 2 k v 2 k w 1 0 0 2 3 these decompositions will be used extensively in later computations 13 chapter 3 automorphisms of the split octonion algebra 3 1 generalities now the we have defined the split octonion algebra o we shift our focus to its auto morphism group aut o it will be assumed that any composition subalgebras of o that are mentioned here are precisely those split algebras described in our previous examples we remind the reader that k may be any field of char k 6 2 definition 3 1 1 let w be a composition algebra and v be a composition subalgebra of w we will use aut w v to denote the set of k algebra automorphisms of w which act trivially on v it is clear that these form a subgroup of the group aut w however since the composition algebras v w will not be fields in general we will not refer to these as galois groups despite the similarities in notation and definition 1 note that any automorphism of any composition algebra w is unital and linear and thus preserves the embedded copy of k w therefore we can write aut w k or aut w interchangeably without loss of meaning in order to understand the fairly complicated group aut o k aut o it is helpful to consider some of its more notable subgroups we list a few important subgroups below and describe how they arise to save on notation we will denote by g t the transpose inverse of a matrix g there will be nothing lost by this abbreviation since these two operations commute 1 these groups are referred to in this way in 11 and some other sources 14 3 2 a subgroup isomorphic to sl 3 k we begin with a definition the claims of which will be verified in the following proposi tions definition 3 2 1 the group sl 3 k is embedded in aut o k via the morphism sl 3 k aut o k where for g sl 3 k the element g is defined by g a v w d a g v g t w d proposition 3 2 1 the maps g o o are automorphisms for each g sl 3 k proof it is easily verified that each g is linear and invertibility follows from g itself being invertible to show that g is multiplicative we first note that given any two vectors v w k 3 and any invertible matrix g gl 3 k we have g v g t w g v t g t w vtgt g t w vt w v w it is less obvious though still true that under the same conditions one has g v g w det g g t v w however in our case we assume g sl 3 k so the above determinant is equal to one armed with these facts we now verify that g a v w d g a g v g t w d g g t a g v g t ag g v g t w g t g t w g t g v g d g t w g a v g a v w g t w v d w g a v w d 15 proposition 3 2 2 the map is an injective morphism of groups proof this verification is elementary and requires only the the fact that matrix inversion and transposition commute we can easily see that the action of leaves the diagonal entries of an octonion element unchanged which means that for k k k o we have that sl 3 k aut o k in fact we can do better proposition 3 2 3 fix a tower of composition algebras satisfying k k b c the image sl 3 k in aut o is equal to aut o k proof a proof of this may be found on pages 71 72 of 11 3 3 some subgroups isomorphic to sl 2 k in this definition we begin with the particular embedding mat 2 k o which corresponds to a choice of decomposition of v o as v a b j as discussed in section 2 3 we will discuss the other embeddings of mat 2 k into o later on definition 3 3 1 for the choice of embedding we have a related embedding of groups sl 2 k aut o k where g is defined in the following way after decomposing v o into v a b j with a b mat 2 k apply the element g g a b j a gb j proposition 3 3 1 the maps g o o are automorphisms for each g sl 2 k proof again it is easily verified that g is linear and invertibility follows from g itself being invertible that it is also multiplicative depends upon the fact that g sl 2 k and det g 1 for 16 in such a case the involution on mat 2 k mat 2 k corresponds to inversion g g 1 therefore g a bl c dl g ac db da bc l ac db g da bc l ac d g 1 g b g da g bc l ac dg gb gd a gb c l ac gd gb gd a gb c l a gb l c gd l g a bl g c dl proposition 3 3 2 the map is an isomorphism of groups sl 2 k aut o mat 2 k proof since the matrices a b g all associate is a homomorphism of groups from sl 2 k aut o it is obvious that the map has trivial kernel also from the definition of the element g acts only on the second component of the decomposed a bl and therefore acts trivially on the image mat 2 k in o therefore sl 2 k aut o mat 2 k conversely let aut o mat 2 k we already have that o mat 2 k mat 2 k l for some element l mat 2 k with n l 6 0 since algebra automorphisms pre serve norms and thus orthogonal subspaces maps mat 2 k mat 2 k l into itself and therefore l ul for some u mat 2 k in fact n l n l n ul n u n l implies that n u 1 therefore for a bl o a bl a b l a b ul a ub l the last equality in the above follows from lemma 2 3 2 recall that this definition began with a choice of decomposition a bl in the sense of the last section likewise we can start with any embedding of mat 2 k into o and end up with a similarly defined embedding of sl 2 k into aut o all of the verifications we have just performed can also be verified for other embeddings in this way each embedding of mat 2 k into o will yield a distinct copy of sl 2 into aut o 17 3 4 some other subgroups isomorphic to sl 2 k for each embedding of mat 2 k into o we now describe another distinct way of embed ding sl 2 k into aut o again we describe the construction with respect to the embedding though there is no reason to prefer this choice definition 3 4 1 for the choice of embedding we have a related embedding of groups sl 2 k aut o k here after decomposing an element v o into v a b j with a b mat 2 k as before we apply the element g in a different way g a b j gag 1 bg 1 j that sl 2 k aut o k and that is an injective morphism of groups are both verifications very similar to those of section 3 3 again all verifications hold regardless of the choice of initial decomposition unlike the previous cases however we note that g will act trivially on a mat 2 k for all g sl 2 k if and only if a is a scalar matrix thus the automorphisms constructed in this way all preserve the field k or rather its isomorphic copy in o after all they are linear but do not preserve k or any copy of mat 2 k and this copy of sl 2 k is not subgroup of the form aut w v as described before 3 5 matters of notation while the embedding of sl 3 k into g 2 was relatively straightforward the various em beddings of sl 2 k required us to make a number of choices we wish to create a notation for these associated automorphisms that will be even more descriptive and be consistent with nota tion that we will use in later chapters first note that so long as only one choice of embedding mat 2 k o is used composition of the automorphisms of type and will simply correspond to matrix multiplication since all of the involved matrices will be part of the same embedded copy of mat 2 k o and will associate second we note that sl 2 k is generated by matrices of the form 1 x 0 1 and 1 0 y 1 with x y k therefore each embedded copy sl 2 aut o is likewise generated by those automorphisms of o which act by these matrices that is by the automorphisms 18 1 x 0 1 and 1 0 y 1 with x y k each embedded copy of sl 2 is also generated by the automorphisms analogous to these definition 3 5 1 we will denote the following embeddings of the additive group k into the multiplicative group sl 2 k as follows e s 7 1 s 0 1 and e s 7 1 0 s 1 so for a fixed mat 2 k o we consolidate all of our notation by defining the following maps from additive group k to the group aut o e e e e defined by a composition of injective morphisms the maps above are all themselves injective morphisms from the additive group k to the group aut o and there are 12 such maps as an example with x k the automorphism s acts on an element a bk o as x a bk 1 0 s 1 a 1 0 s 1 b 1 0 s 1 0 k k 0 it is precisely these automorphisms s and t for s t k that will act as our chevalley generators in the remaining chapters the automorphisms g corresponding to the sl 3 k subgroup will make a significant contribution as well 19 chapter 4 chevalley groups 4 1 background historically the identification of many abstract simple groups was done via a careful consideration of simple complex lie groups for example if one defines the group sl 2 c to be the group of two by two matrices of determinant one then the field c may be easily replaced by any field or commutative ring with identity without alteration of the definition but this strategy requires one to construct and study each simple lie group individually moreover many other groups which were known at least formally to exist via an association to a lie algebra or root system failed to admit such a simple definition theoretically all such algebraic groups can be considered as subgroups of gln satisfying some polynomial conditions on the entries though the size of n and the nature of the polynomial conditions proved to be elusive at the time of chevalley s work in 4 only the exceptional group g 2 had admitted 1 such an identification the strength of chevalley s construction is that it allows us to study all groups which arise from an abstract root system simultaneously regardless of their association to any particular lie algebra or field in its basic form this construction will begin with a root system and then identify a set of generators for the group which are in families corresponding to the roots in the root diagram one then imposes a set of relations on these generators which will yield the desired group structure these relations are explicitly described in 21 from which the main part of this section is taken a group constructed in this manner will be called a chevalley group our goal in this chapter is to justify the use of the name g 2 for aut o by identifying the 1 the group g 2 was treated for the first time in 5 and 6 in chevalley s introduction of 4 he states that he has himself applied this method to the groups f 4 e 6 and e 7 in an unedited and unpublished work 20 generators of aut o established in the last section with the chevalley generators coming from the root diagram of the lie algebra g 2 and then verifying that our generators satisfy the needed chevalley relations 4 2 abstract root systems to define a chevalley group g we require only an abstract reduced root system we therefore proceed with a few definitions definition 4 2 1 14 let e be a finite dimensional real inner product space with inner product and norm squared 2 an abstract reduced root system in e is a finite set of nonzero elements of e such that a spans e b if and are in then 2 2 is an integer c for each the reflection s 2 2 is also a root in d for each if n then n 1 we may choose a decomposition of into positive and negative roots the way that we choose this decomposition is unimportant so long as the positive roots satisfy the following properties a for any nonzero exactly one of and is positive b the sum of positive roots is positive when it is a root at all then among the positive roots we can find the set of simple roots which are defined by the property that if then cannot be written for definition 4 2 2 let w denote the weyl group of isometries of e generated by the elements s from root axiom c which reflect a root across the hyperplane orthogonal to in e definition 4 2 3 an abstract root system is said to be reduced if implies 2 after making some choice of simple roots 1 2 n here n dim e we define the factors aij 2 i j i 2 21 from the root axiom b we are guaranteed that aij z then the cartan matrix of with respect to is defined to be the n n matrix a aij although this matrix will depend not only on our choice of simple roots but also on their enumeration distinct choices will lead to matrices which are conjugate by some permutation matrix the combinatorial properties imposed on the entries of this matrix by the root axioms lead to the classification of all such cartan matrices and to the notion of the dynkin diagram the classification of all dynkin diagrams and therefore all abstract reduced root systems is well known and can be found in references such as 8 or 14 4 3 the chevalley construction we build our chevalley group g g k from a root system and a field k the chevalley generators of g will each be elements of the form e t parameterized by t k and from these basic generators one can also construct the following secondary elements definition 4 3 1 for t k define w t e t e t 1 e t h t w t w 1 having these generators and group elements we describe the relations which define the group g taken from 21 pg 66 a the e are each homomorphisms from the additive group of k into g that is e s t e s e t for all s t k b if with 6 0 then e t e s ei j nijs itj where the product is taken over all strictly positive integers i j z such that i j and the nij are each integers depending on but not on s t c each h is multiplicative in k i e h s h t h st for all s t k though g is presently only an abstract group devoid of any topological or geometric properties the relations just given still impart a significant amount of structure onto the group for example one can show that structure constants nij described in b will be equal to either 22 1 2 or 3 for any initial or choice of there is great deal more theory which comes directly from the chevalley construction alone the best treatments of which can be found in 4 and 21 from our generators we define the following subgroups definition 4 3 2 16 if g g k is a chevalley group constructed as we have just described then t h t n w t where and t k then t g is called the cartan subgroup of g the subgroup n will also play a role as evidenced by the following proposition proposition 4 3 1 let t and n be as described above and w be the weyl group of described in definition 13 then a t is normal in n b the map n w that sends w t to the reflection s induces an isomorphism of n t with w proof proof of this may be found in 21 lemma 22 4 4 when more is known though the theory of abstract chevalley groups is extensive quite a bit more can be said if we associate to the root system its appropriate lie group or lie algebra for example at the end of the last section we were able to define the subgroup t and the weyl group n t of g g without any topological references whatsoever of course in the case that k c and g is a semisimple complex lie group t will be the familiar maximal torus of g and its lie algebra will be a cartan subalgebra of g these considerations are unnecessary in the abstract case but in this setting one often considers the roots to be homomorphisms defined on such a maximal torus we will describe these homomorphism in chapter 7 where we define the coroot system in the case that a root system can be identified with a well known algebraic group g then we might identify known generators of g which are in correspondence with our chevalley generators e t describing the precise correspondence between various generators and roots 23 usually involves some sometimes lengthy calculation a simple example of such an identification is described in section 4 5 on the other hand if one attaches to the root system its appropriate semisimple complex lie algebra g there is an explicit connection of the root to the generator e via the exponential map one can choose a root space decomposition g h g with a suitable choice of root vectors e from their respective root spaces that satisfy certain algebraic properties chevalley showed in 4 that such a basis h e of g appropriately called a chevalley basis always exists one can then formally exponentiate each basis element e against an invariant t to arrive at elements e t exp tx which will necessarily satisfy the chevalley group relations and thus generate 2 the group g this group g is precisely the chevalley group corresponding to g since t is an invariant which can be taken from any field this approach is general we will discuss this exponentiation strategy in more detail in chapter 5 4 5 an example the group sl 2 k can be constructed from rank one root diagram having two roots which is shown in figure 4 1 along with its single line of reflection however we have already discussed in section 3 5 two generators of sl 2 k when considered as group of matrices therefore we can make the association for t k e t 1 t 0 1 e t 1 0 t 1 figure 4 1 the root diagram of type a 1 2 this is true so long as k is algebraically closed or we generate the simply connected form the latter will be true in our case 24 from these generators we calculate that w t e t e t 1 e t 1 t 0 1 1 0 t 1 1 1 t 0 1 0 t t 1 0 h t w t w 1 0 t t 1 0 0 1 1 0 t 0 0 t 1 note that the chevalley relations a and c are easily verified while relation b is trivial in this case we see that the h t indeed generate the maximal torus of diagonal matrices in sl 2 k we can also calculate that w n t z 2 z which corresponds to our intuition from the root diagram a 1 one may consult 16 for a similar discussion of the group sp 4 k corresponding to the root system c 2 in our next chapter we will make an identification of chevalley generators e t to automorphisms in aut o though in this case it will not be so obvious that our choices of automorphisms actually generate this entire automorphism group we will therefore need to apply some extra argument 25 chapter 5 chevalley generators of g 2 5 1 background and strategy as mentioned in section 4 4 one strategy for identifying chevalley generators of a chevalley group g is to first identify a chevalley basis of the corresponding lie algebra g for us with g g 2 we can allow a choice of simple roots with the short root as shown in figure 5 1 and a corresponding root space decomposition figure 5 1 the root diagram of type g 2 definition 5 1 1 a chevalley basis for the lie algebra g g 2 is a basis b h h e which satisfies the following axioms 26 a h h 0 b h e 2 e and h x 2 e c e e ah bh where a b d e e 0 if 6 0 and e if 6 0 and and r is the integer occurring in the string through given by r q then e e r 1 e exponentiating each basis element e will give group elements e t exp t e in gchev 2 and exponentiating the chevalley basis relations will show that the e t necessarily satisfy the chevalley group relations examples of this construction can be found in either 4 or 21 however in our case we already have candidates for our chevalley generators the and automorphisms and we will soon show directly that they satisfy the chevalley group relations therefore we would like to use a slightly reversed argument we will rather describe a specific lie algebra g of cartan type g 2 and a basis of this algebra such that when our basis is exponentiated it gives precisely our automorphisms and since we will have verified the chevalley group relations our choice of basis will necessarily be a chevalley basis in g and our and automorphisms will generate a chevalley group of type g 2 to summarize we will have the following structures a a lie algebra g 2 b a chevalley basis b of g 2 c the chevalley group g 2 generated from exponentiated chevalley basis elements d the automorphism group aut o e the subgroup g aut o generated by the automorphisms and our arguments will show that g g 2 the fact that g is actually all of aut o will be addressed using a result of george seligman from 17 seligman uses as g 2 the algebra of derivations of o and therefore we will follow suit 27 5 2 associations and verifications we note again that the root diagram of type g 2 shows 12 roots 6 long and 6 short similarly we also have the 12 maps of type and each of which are homomorphisms from the additive group k into the group aut o therefore we can identify each with a long root in and each with a short root this identification is shown in figure 5 2 we should note that the relative associations are precise once a choice of association is made between the two simple roots and particular automorphisms the rest follow necessarily k k k k k k k k k k k k figure 5 2 the association of the automorphisms of o to the roots of g 2 proposition 5 2 1 the automorphisms and as placed in figure 5 2 satisfy the chevalley group relations proof first each automorphism and is a homomorphism from the additive group of k to the multiplicative group of aut o by definition 3 5 1 according to the third chevalley relation we wish to show that the automorphisms corresponding to the h are multiplicative since w and h are defined in terms of a single the associated automorphisms will be built using a single choice of embedding of mat 2 k into o therefore composition of the involved automorphisms just corresponds to multiplication of the involved matrices moreover all matrices involved will associate with each other for example if e then w t corresponds to an automorphism which acts on an 28 element of o split with respect to w t a bj a e t e t 1 e t b j a 1 t 0 1 1 0 t 1 1 1 t 0 1 b j a 0 t t 1 0 b j likewise in this case h will correspond to an action by a matrix of the form h t a bj w t w 1 a bj a 0 t t 1 0 0 0 b j a t 0 0 t 1 b j again since a single root is fixed in the chevalley definition of h the action of the corresponding automorphism will always be with respect to a diagonal matrix in sl 2 k therefore actions of h s h t and h st will be identical the computations necessary to verify the second chevalley relation and identify the necessary nij are given in appendices a and b completing our proof for now denote by g aut o the group generated by our and though we have not yet proven that these automorphisms actually generate all of aut o we still have a valid definition of the subgroup t g generated by t h t t k this leads us to the following proposition proposition 5 2 2 let ts be the maximal torus of diagonal matrices in sl 3 k then the image ts aut o is equal to t h t t k g proof since is an morphism of groups the image ts can be generated by the two elements t t 1 1 and 1 t t 1 29 for t k it is then an easy calculation that h k t k t t 1 a v w d a v 3 w 3 d t t 1 v 1 w 2 v 2 w 1 0 0 a tv 1 t 1 v 2 v 3 t 1 w 1 tw 2 w 3 d t t 1 1 a v w d and likewise that as automorphisms 1 t t 1 t t 1 h t therefore ts t conversely while the subgroup t is defined to be generated by the h for it may actually be generated by a smaller subset of these h for example it is immediate from the definitions that h t h t 1 h t h t 1 h k t h k t 1 also from the above considerations we can show that h k t h t t t 1 1 1 t t 1 t 1 t 1 h t for the toral elements corresponding to short roots we calculate h t t t 1 a v w d t t 1 a v 1 w 1 d t 1 t v 2 w 3 v 3 w 2 t 1 t 0 0 a t 2 v 1 t 1 v 2 t 1 v 3 t 2 w 1 tw 2 tw 3 d t 1 t 1 t t 1 1 a v w d h t h k t a v w d in this way all h may be generated from different combinations of the h or equivalently by the image ts therefore t ts and our statement follows 30 5 3 the algebra of derivations of o our next task is to specify a lie algebra of cartan type g 2 and identify an appropriate chevalley basis of that algebra toward this we make the following definition definition 5 3 1 we denote by dero the set of derivations on o that is the set of k linear opera tors d o o satisfying for all x y o d xy xd y d x y it is elementary to show that dero is closed under commutation d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 and thus dero is a lie algebra over k in 10 n jacobson begins with this definition and proves that dero is a simple 14 dimensional lie algebra of cartan type g 2 in fact this statement can be extended to any field of characteristic not 2 or 3 c f 17 theorem 5 another portion of seligman s work proves the following proposition 5 3 1 17 let char k 6 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 and o be the octonion algebra constructed over k then the representation aut o aut dero g 7 d 7 g 1 dg is an isomorphism of groups definition 5 3 2 let ad denote the adjoint representation of dero ad dero end dero d 7 d and by the simplicity of dero this is faithful definition 5 3 3 let dernil o d dero ad d is nilpotent we then define the exponential map into the automorphism group of dero exp dernilo aut dero d 7 exp t ad d where exp is defined by exp x k 0 xk k where the sum terminates as x is assumed to be ad nilpotent 31 this gives us a diagram which describes the relationships we have so far der nil o exp aut dero aut o now suppose that b h h e is a chevalley basis of g 2 if the ephi are ad nilpotent as will be the case for us then we exponentiate our basis elements and define e t exp t ad e aut dero in this case we have the following theorem theorem 5 3 1 17 let char k 6 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 and o be the octonion algebra constructed over k let g 2 aut dero be the group generated by all automorphisms of dero of the form e t exp t ad e where e runs through all the root vectors relative to all standard cartan subalgebras of dero then g 2 coincides with the full automorphism group aut dero and therefore g 2 aut dero aut o we note that seligman proves this theorem by describing an explicit chevalley basis of dero and exponentiating that specific basis also 17 does not explicitly describe any individual automorphisms in aut o we will be choosing our own basis for dero but by 21 page 6 any chevalley basis of dero is unique up to some sign changes and automorphisms of dero so seligman s results will still be valid for our choices 5 4 a chevalley basis of dero according to our last theorem we are left to show that our automorphisms and are of the required form for some chevalley basis elements e in which case we will have that g g 2 aut o we do this by taking the algebraic derivative of each of the automorphisms we have we begin with the long roots automorphisms define e end o by e x lim t 0 t x x t that is for each u k we have x a blu and e u a blu lim t 0 u t x x t lim t 0 1 t 0 t 0 0 b lu 0 1 0 0 b lu 32 likewise for e u end o we have e u a blu 0 0 1 0 b lu next we apply the same operation to the short roots using the same definitions e x lim t 0 t x x t again for each u k and x a blu we have e u a blu lim t 0 u t x x t lim t 0 1 t 1 t 0 1 aij 1 t 0 1 aij bij 0 t 0 0 lu lim t 0 1 t 1 t 0 1 aij aij 1 t 0 1 1 t 0 1 bij 0 t 0 0 lu lim t 0 1 t ta 21 ta 22 ta 11 0 ta 21 1 t 0 1 bij 0 t 0 0 lu lim t 0 a 21 a 22 a 11 0 a 21 1 t 0 1 bij 0 1 0 0 lu a 21 a 22 a 11 0 a 21 bij 0 1 0 0 lu 0 1 0 0 aij bij 0 1 0 0 lu in this expression the square brackets denote the commutator bracket likewise for e u end o we have e u a blu 0 0 1 0 aij bij 0 0 1 0 lu these define a set e it can be checked directly that each of these e is are derivations and nilpotent with e 2 0 so for any other d dero ad e 3 d ad e 2 e d de ad e 2 e de 0 thus each ad e 3 0 and e is ad nilpotent it is also clear that the e exponentiate to our original octonion automorphisms for the two simple roots and k in define h e e and h e e proposition 5 4 1 the combined set b h h e defines a chevalley basis of dero 33 proof the chevalley group relations can be recovered by the chevalley basis relations via expo nentiation and vice versa via differentiation therefore the elements e will satisfy the relevant chevalley basis relations while h h were constructed in order to satisfy their needed relations now let b be any other chevalley basis for dero we have a lie algebra morphism f b b which maps basis elements to corresponding basis elements and this map is injective as dero is simple therefore b is linearly independent and our statement follows 34 part ii part ii local fields 35 chapter 6 introduction in part ii we discuss certain structures in g 2 that arise only when it is constructed over a local non archimedean field in particular we will take k qp though many results will be true in a more general context we will assume that the reader is familiar with basic notions related to local non archimedean fields if not 18 or 19 are standard references one important fact about g 2 constructed over qp is the following from 1 theorem 6 0 1 for k qp any octonion algebra o constructed over k will necessarily be split therefore there is only one possible octonion algebra over k qp up to isomorphism therefore in our case we need only consider the split form of g 2 we continue to follow the work of bruhat and tits in chapter 7 where we construct the standard apartment of the bruhat tits building b g 2 based on our previous choices of maximal torus and root systems though the building itself is a larger structure most of our work will be focused within the apartment itself in chapter 8 we define octonion orders lattice filtrations and sequences and valuations on o the narrative there will follow along very closely with 7 and our attempt will be to place their work in a more concrete setting using the explicit automorphisms we now have 36 chapter 7 construction of the standard apartment 7 1 coroots and the coroot diagram we again let be the root system used in the chevalley construction of our group g 2 we will choose as simple roots and k and the set of positive roots corresponding to this choice we begin by describing the purely abstract coroot system definition 7 1 1 from each root define the corresponding coroot 2 2 2 these coroots will also form an abstract root system of the same rank as which we will call the dual root system or coroot system and denote it by since each coroot is just a scaled root the angle between our simple coroots is equal to that of the simple roots it is also easy to see that the coroot corresponding to a short root will be long and the coroot corresponding to a long root will be short the coroot system for our group g 2 is shown in figure 7 1 with the simple coroots labeled in the setting of algebraic groups we often like to consider our coroots to to be homo morphisms from k t where t is some maximal torus of the group luckily we already have homomorphisms of this type namely the h described in the chevalley construction and which generate such a subgroup t therefore we can define the action of on k to be equal to that of h for each root h k t 37 figure 7 1 the coroot diagram of g 2 in the same setting we would also like to consider our roots themselves to be homomor phisms t k for each this association is a bit more complex proposition 7 1 1 for each pair of roots we have the following identity of chevalley elements where u t k h t e u h t 1 e t 2 u this defines a map on generators h t 7 t 2 which then extends to a homomorphism t k proof we refer the reader to 21 lemmas 19 and 20 and their proofs definition 7 1 2 1 for t t we denote by x t the group of characters from t k generated by the roots and by x t the group of cocharacters from k t generated by the coroots we next establish a connection between the roots and coroots it is well known or easily calculated that the root system of type g 2 has cartan matrix a 2 3 1 2 we use these cartan integers to make the following definiton definition 7 1 3 for the simple roots in the g 2 diagram define the pairings 2 2 2 1 2 3 2 2 1 we use this definition as our group g 2 is simply connected and adjoint 38 these identifications extend to a non symmetric bilinear pairing between and to close this section we remind ourselves that each coroot is simply a re scaled root so that an explicit connection between roots and coroots can be seen from comparing the root and coroot diagrams seeing that the highest long root 3 2 lies at the same relative angle as the coroot 2 should lead us to believe the identity 3 2 2 indeed we can verify these connections algebraically by using the following relation proposition 7 1 2 let and s w be the reflection of through the hyperplane orthogonal to in the root diagram then s proof recall that the coroots have exactly the same relative angles as the roots they are built from so from the definition of s root axiom c we have s 2 the definition of completes the identity now suppose that is any root then negative roots and coroots coincide s 2 and therefore s likewise for our long and short respectively simple roots s 1 therefore since the reflection of across the hyperplane orthogonal to is 3 3 s 39 then we can use the last fact to show that s 3 3 3 3 2 2 since the reflection of 3 across the hyperplane orthogonal to is 3 2 3 2 s 3 2 working in this way we can calculate all of the following identities 3 2 2 3 3 3 2 2 again since for all roots this gives the coroot corresponding to every root 7 2 affine roots the apartment and hyperplanes definition 7 2 1 with t h t and the corresponding choice of roots and coroots we define the affine apartment a to be the full coroot space a e x t r from this definition alone the apartment of any rank two coroot system of any cartan type will be identical however there is much substructure on a that will serve to distinguish between such apartments toward this we make some new definitions definition 7 2 2 let and n z we define a new affine functional on a n a r x 7 x n 40 and define h n x a n x 0 x a x n because is bilinear this zero locus n 1 0 forms an affine subspace of codi mension 1 in the plane of coroots for example consider the hyperplane h since 2 the coroot will not lie in h however we do have 2 2 2 2 1 0 since this pairing is bilinear we also know that 2 2 0 and this is enough to determine the hyperplane h a shown in figure 7 2 h figure 7 2 a hyperplane corresponding to 41 likewise since 1 we have that lies in the hyperplane h 1 we also have that 2 1 1 therefore the coroot also lies in the hyperplane h 1 again since our pairing is bilinear any linear combination of these two coroots will also lie in our hyperplane in figure 7 3 we display a number of hyperplanes corresponding to the root h 2 h 1 h 0 h 1 h 2 figure 7 3 the hyperplanes corresponding to we use the same strategy to identify hyperplanes h n corresponding to the other simple root these hyperplanes are shown in figure 7 4 below note that the coroot lies on the hyperplane h 2 as expected and that the origin is again contained in the hyperplane h 0 42 h 2 h 1 h 0 h 1 h 2 h 2 h 1 h 0 h 1 h 2 figure 7 4 the hyperplanes corresponding to in figure 7 5 we show the hyperplanes corresponding to the non simple root 3 note that according to our calculations in section 7 1 or by comparing the root and coroot dia grams we have 3 we find that 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 1 3 2 2 as we should expect the remainder of the h 3 n hyperplanes are labeled as well 43 h 2 h 1 h 0 h 1 h 2 h 2 h 1 h 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 2 h 3 1 h 3 0 h 3 1 h 3 2 figure 7 5 the hyperplanes corresponding to 3 after all hyperplanes h n for all 12 roots have been positively identified we see in figure 7 6 that the standard affine apartment is divided up into infinitely many 30 60 90 triangles each of which is called a chamber of the apartment for purposes of later identification we will refer to the vertices that connect edges at an incidence angle of 30 as type 1 points vertices which have incidence angles of 90 will be called type 2 points and those that have incidence angles of 60 will be called type 3 points recall that the construction of this apartment was contingent on a choice of maximal torus t g or equivalently from a choice of chevalley generators e for an alternate choice of torus will yield a distinct apartment though the two will have identical structures these 44 figure 7 6 the standard apartment of g 2 distinct apartments can be glued together along the hyperplane edges and the greater structure thus obtained is known as the bruhat tits building b g 2 of g 2 however in this current work we have already made a steadfast choice of chevalley generators so we will have little need of this larger structure for now and will focus on the affine apartment obtained from our choices 45 chapter 8 lattice filtrations and octonion orders 8 1 lattices and orders in o for the current section we will briefly step away from our discussion of roots coroots and the affine apartment we outline here some general definitions and facts about octonion orders in the sense of 7 we will quickly return to our affine apartment at the end of section 8 2 also for the first time the discrete valuation of the field k qp will come into play therefore in this section and for the remainder of this paper the field over which we work will be fixed with k qp and the uniformizer p 6 2 definition 8 1 1 a lattice in o is a finitely generated zp submodule of o such that qp o an order in o is a zp lattice which is also a unital subring definition 8 1 2 a lattice filtration in o is a set of lattices r r r totally ordered with respect to containment satisfying the following axioms a r r o b r r 0 c if r s r and r s then r s d if r r then s r s r 46 definition 8 1 3 let r be a lattice filtration in o for any r r we take r r s s the jumps of the lattice r are the real numbers r r for which r 6 r definition 8 1 4 a lattice filtration is called a lattice sequence if for every r r we have r 1 p r we should note that a given lattice sequence r may or may not have lattices inter mediate to r and r 1 p r however there will be finitely many jumps in the filtration between 0 and 1 let ji r such that 0 j 1 j 2 jr 1 1 and we have containments p j 1 p 0 jr 1 j 2 j 1 0 p 1 jr 1 the maximum number of intermediate lattices for a given sequence is called the rank of the sequence as an example we may consider the standard lattice o zp of octonion elements with purely integer entries this is certainly a zp module of o which after extending scalars is equal to o but it is also closed under multiplication and contains the identity therefore it is an order in o we may also define the individual lattices of a lattice filtration with r r by r p r o p r zp note that r is a lattice sequence by definition for r 0 each of these lattices will be an order in o but not so for negative r also because of the discrete valuation on qp the jumps of this lattice filtration will occur precisely at r z we will refer to r as the standard lattice sequence proposition 8 1 1 let be the following lattice in o pa 1 zp pa 2 zp p a 3 zp p a 4 zp pa 5 zp p a 6 zp p a 7 zp pa 8 zp that is the ith entry of an element in this lattice should have valuation at minimum ai then is an order 47 in o if and only if all of the following relations are satisfied a 2 a 3 a 7 a 2 a 5 0 a 1 a 8 0 a 2 a 4 a 6 a 3 a 6 0 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 4 a 7 0 a 5 a 6 a 4 a 5 a 7 a 3 a 6 a 7 a 2 proof we begin with the last condition that a 1 a 8 0 for to be an order it must first contain the identity which forces a 1 and a 8 to be nonpositive furthermore if a 1 0 then by performing the multiplication 2 pa 1 zp pa 2 zp p a 3 zp p a 4 zp pa 5 zp p a 6 zp p a 7 zp pa 8 zp 2 we see that the upper left entry of the product will be in p 2 a 1 zp p a 2 a 5 zp p a 3 a 6 zp p a 4 a 7 zp since 2 a 1 a 1 this is not contained in p a 1 zp for any values of the remaining exponents therefore is not closed under multiplication and is not an order in o the lower right entry of the product can also be examined to show that a 8 0 now suppose that a 1 a 8 0 therefore 1 o and we check to see when is closed under multiplication by performing the multiplication 2 we will examine each entry of this product individually in the upper left entry we find zp p a 2 a 5 zp p a 3 a 6 zp p a 4 a 7 zp which will be contained in zp so long as a 2 a 5 a 3 a 6 a 4 a 7 are all nonnegative this gives us three more of our relations and computing the lower right entry will yield the same result next computing the upper right vector entry we find pa 2 zp p a 3 zp p a 4 zp pa 2 zp p a 3 zp p a 4 zp pa 6 a 7 zp p a 5 a 7 zp p a 5 a 6 zp this will be contained in if and only if a 6 a 7 a 2 a 5 a 7 a 3 and a 5 a 6 a 4 which gives us three more of our relations the final three relations can be found be examining the lower left vector entry in the same way 48 it is clear from this argument that our standard lattice sequence r satisfies all of these relations trivially it is also clear that writing out octonion elements in this way is notationally cumbersome we introduce some new notation to help definition 8 1 5 we will use the following notation to describe the relevant lattices in o a 2 a 3 a 4 a 1 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 pa 1 zp pa 2 zp p a 3 zp p a 4 zp pa 5 zp p a 6 zp p a 7 zp pa 8 zp if the diagonal valuations are absent they are to be interpreted as zeros likewise we will denote lattice filtrations in o indexed by r r by r a 2 a 3 a 4 a 1 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 p r a 2 a 3 a 4 a 1 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 r r a 2 r a 3 r a 4 r a 1 r a 5 r a 6 r a 7 r a 8 r r r once again due to the fact that k qp has a discrete valuation all of these lattice filtrations are also lattice sequences the individual lattices in the sequence may or may not be orders based on whether or not the indices satisfy the relations in proposition 8 1 1 definition 8 1 6 given a lattice in o as defined above the dual lattice associated to is defined to be x o t xy zp y proposition 8 1 2 let be a lattice in o a 2 a 3 a 4 a 1 a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 then a 5 a 6 a 7 a 8 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 1 proof we perform a simple calculation on the level of sets to determine the octonion elements which satisfy this condition set pd 1 zp pd 2 zp p d 3 zp p d 4 zp pd 5 zp p d 6 zp p d 7 zp pd 8 zp then we multiply writing our vectors as columns for convenience pd 1 zp pd 2 zp pd 3 zp pd 4 zp pd 5 zp pd 6 zp pd 7 zp pd 8 zp pa 1 zp pa 2 zp pa 3 zp pa 4 zp pa 5 zp pa 6 zp pa 7 zp pa 8 zp 49 since we are only concerned with the trace of this product we only consider its diagonal entries for the upper left entry we find that pd 1 a 1 zp p d 2 a 5 zp p d 3 a 6 zp p d 4 a 7 zp which will be in zp for all element of precisely when d 1 a 1 d 3 a 6 d 2 a 5 d 4 a 7 likewise the lower right entry will yield pd 5 a 2 zp p d 6 a 3 zp p d 7 a 4 zp p d 8 a 8 zp which will be in zp for all element of precisely when d 5 a 2 d 7 a 4 d 6 a 3 d 8 a 8 translating this result to the notation we have defined gives us the desired result 8 2 maximinorante algebra valuations in a general context let v be any unital k algebra with k a local non archimedean field we would like to extend our regular valuation val k z to a valuation on all of v denoted also by val in such a way that the two valuations coincide on k v definition 8 2 1 7 let v be any unital k algebra with k a local non archimedean field a valuation 1 on v is a map val v r such that for all v w v a val v w inf val v val w b val av val a val v for all a k c val v if and only if v 0 we call val an algebra valuation if it additionally satisfies d val v w val v val w 1 in 7 these maps are called a norm on v since we will work with composition algebras which already have a norm n we will avoid this term in the current context 50 we reiterate that in expression b the valuation on a is the regular valuation defined on k while the valuation on v and av is the one defined on v since the k algebra that we would like to discuss is also a composition algebra with a quadratic norm n and an associated nondegenerate bilinear form b we give some adjectives to describe the relationship between these structures definition 8 2 2 7 let v n be a composition algebra over k with char k 6 2 we say that an algebra valuation val on v minorizes n and b if for all v w v val b v w val v val w among valuations we say that val 1 val 2 if val 1 v val 2 v for all v v thus if val is a maximal element in the set of algebra valuations minorizing n and b we say that val is maximinorante proposition 8 2 1 there is a bijection between the set of valuations val on o and the set of lattice sequences on o proof given a valuation val o r we construct the individual lattices val r x o val x r since val p val p val 1 val we have that val r 1 x o val x r 1 p val r and this is indeed a lattice sequence in o conversely let r be a lattice sequence and let x o let x be the smallest with respect to containment in the lattice sequence member of r containing x and let val x r note that since 0 o is contained in every lattice of every sequence there is no such smallest member of r which contains it and from this we get condition c of the definition of algebra valuations condition b follows from the fact that for x o and a r we have ax a x finally for condition a let x y o then in the sequence r we may assume without loss of generality that x y and val x val y then since y contains both x and y and thus x y and x y is the smallest such lattice we have x y y therefore val x y inf val x val y given the above bijection we find that the definitions of this chapter are all connected via the following important theorem 51 theorem 8 2 1 7 theorem 7 3 there is a bijection between the points in the building b g of g aut o and the set of maximinorante algebra valuations for o n in this bijection the type 1 points of b g correspond to those algebra valuations which take values in val k which in turn correspond to maximal orders in o we now have several different but related structures maximinorante algebra valuations on o certain lattice sequences and orders in o and points in our apartment a theorem 8 2 1 establishes a direct connection between these objects and will allow us to label our apartment a in significant detail 8 3 orders of type 1 by theorem 8 2 1 the type 1 points are in bijection with the maximal orders in o we will denote the set of maximal orders by v 1 and we describe some of these maximal orders below we recall that sl 3 k g 2 acts on octonion elements by the map as defined in section 3 2 therefore it also acts on lattices in o in particular consider the following toral elements of ts sl 3 k g p 0 0 0 p 1 0 0 0 1 and g t g 1 p 1 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 1 applying the associated automorphism g to the standard lattice sequence gives the following result g zp g z 3 p g t z 3 p zp zp p zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp p zp zp zp 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 proposition 8 3 1 the lattice 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 is a maximal order in o proof it is easily checked that satisfies the properties of proposition 8 1 1 in particular the sum of each column in the matrix of valuations is equal to zero any lattice containing must have an decreased valuation in at least one entry which would cause the relevant sum to become negative in which case the lattice in question would not be an order 52 note that there are six orders total which are analogous to this one each produced by an analogous toral element h p where p is the uniformizer and ranges over the six long roots associated to the six short coroots these h p can be interpreted as acting by automorphisms via the matrices p 0 0 0 p 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 p 1 p 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 p and their inverses the six maximal orders created by these toral elements are identified in yellow in figure 8 2 in this way the torus of sl 3 k which is equal to the torus t in g 2 by proposition 5 2 2 and the same torus used to identify the coroot lattice and the apartment acts on its apartment by translation more specifically t acts transitively on the type 1 vertices of a 53 figure 8 1 the highlighted area of the apartment 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 figure 8 2 maximal orders associated to the vertices of type 1 54 while the conditions given by gan and yu have been sufficient to determine the maximal orders associated to each of our type 1 vertices according to theorem 8 2 1 there are also lattice sequences resp maximinorante valuations associated to each of these points of a creating a lattice sequence from each of our type 1 orders is straightforward by noting that p 2 p p 1 p 2 this construction is independent of the type 1 maximal order that we choose to start from now that we have a lattice sequence identified with each we also have an associated algebra valuation as defined in proposition 8 2 1 for each x a val 1 x sup r r x r in this case we have identified all our structures by first starting with a maximal order in o constructing a lattice sequence and then identifying an algebra valuation val 1 constructed from that lattice sequence for later points in a we will need to do this in a reverse order by first defining an algebra valuation and then constructing our lattice sequence when that occurs it will be useful for us to have a more detailed description of val 1 toward that end we choose a standard basis s b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 for o as an 8 dimensional k vector space with b 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 b 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 b 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 b 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 b 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 b 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 b 4 1 0 0 0 b 4 0 0 0 1 for each maximal order define an intermediate function depending on v 1 s z on these basis elements and extend to scalar multiples using the identity v 1 aibi val ai v 1 bi finally define our valuation val 1 x min i v 1 aibi for x aibi o for example given the lattice sequence constructed from the order 1 1 0 1 1 0 we define the intermediate function v 1 bi 0 if i 4 3 1 if i 2 1 1 if i 1 2 8 1 55 then for any lattice element x 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 we have that val 1 x min i v 1 aibi min i val ai v 1 bi min val a 1 1 val a 2 1 val a 1 1 val a 2 1 val a 3 val a 4 0 likewise for any lattice element x 2 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 we have that val 1 x min i v 1 aibi min i val ai v 1 bi min val a 1 1 val a 2 1 val a 1 1 val a 2 1 val a 3 val a 4 2 as another example given the lattice sequence constructed from the order 0 1 1 0 1 1 we define a distinct intermediate function v 1 bi 0 if i 4 1 1 if i 2 3 1 if i 3 2 this will define another algebra valuation consistent with this new type 1 vertex as a final example for the standard lattice sequence r we can simply take v 1 bi 0 for all bi in which case our valuation becomes val 1 x min val ai this defines an algebra valuation unique to the origin of a it is easily verified that these algebra valuations are consistent with those that we have defined formally in proposition 8 2 1 and satisfy all the needed properties and necessary relations to their respective lattice sequences other analogous algebra valuations may be identified for the lattice sequences corresponding to any other type 1 point in a 8 4 orders of type 2 with regard to the type 2 vertices of the apartment a we use the following proposition which is a restatement of lemma 9 4 and theorem 9 14 of 7 56 proposition 8 4 1 7 let v 2 be the set of orders in o satisfying a p 1 b 2 p 1 then v 2 is in bijection with the set of vertices of type 2 in b g 2 let 1 v 1 and 2 v 2 let x 1 be the type 1 vertex in b g 2 associated to 1 x 2 be the type 2 vertex associated to 2 then x 1 is incident to x 2 if and only if 2 1 proposition 8 4 2 let be the following lattice in o 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 then is a type 2 order in o i e it satisfies the conditions of proposition 8 4 1 proof that is an order is easily checked by verifying the conditions of proposition 8 1 1 we also have 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 and clearly 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 so condition a is satisfied next we calculate 2 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp zp zp zp zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp zp zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp p 1 zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp p 1 zp 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 in this case we have that 2 p 1 so condition b is also satisfied and is a type 2 order in o since this order is contained in both the standard lattice sequence and also in the sequence 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 the vertex associated to it in a is incident to both of the associated 57 vertices of the other two but there is only one such vertex in the building labeled in red in figure 8 2 there will likewise be five more orders of a similar form which we also identify in red and place in their appropriate positions in figure 8 3 the type 1 vertices continue to be shown in yellow for reference 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 figure 8 3 octonion orders associated to the vertices of type 2 in this case we define our related structures by first defining algebra valuations corre sponding to each of these type 2 points using our geometric intuition from a and noting that each type 2 vertex lies in between two type 1 vertices we can define the relevant valuation by averaging the two type 1 valuations following with our previous examples take 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 and for our chosen basis b of o take the intermediate function v 2 bi 1 2 v 1 bi with the v 1 defined in 8 1 of the last section that is v 2 bi 0 if i 4 3 1 2 if i 2 1 1 2 if i 1 2 58 we use this to find the valuation of several octonion elements for a lattice element x 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 we have val 2 x min val a 1 1 2 val a 2 1 2 val a 1 1 2 val a 2 1 2 val a 3 val a 4 min 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 for a lattice element x 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 we have val 2 x min val a 1 1 2 val a 2 1 2 val a 1 1 2 val a 2 1 2 val a 3 val a 4 min 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 1 2 for a lattice element x p 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 we have val 2 x min val a 1 1 2 val a 2 1 2 val a 1 1 2 val a 2 1 2 val a 3 val a 4 min 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 this valuation leads us to the lattice sequence p 1 p p again algebra valuations and lattice sequences for all type 2 vertices can be found in this way 8 5 orders of type 3 next we turn to the vertices of type 3 in a again the following proposition is a restatement of lemma 9 12 and theorem 9 14 of 7 proposition 8 5 1 7 let v 3 be the set of orders in o satisfying a p 1 b m p 2 is a self dual lattice 59 then v 3 is in bijection with the set of vertices of type 3 in b g 2 take 1 v 1 2 v 2 and 3 v 3 let xi be the type i vertex in b g 2 associated to i then a x 1 is incident to x 3 if and only if 3 1 b x 2 is incident to x 3 if and only if 3 2 corollary 8 5 1 the triangle formed in b g 2 by x 1 x 2 x 3 is a chamber if and only if 3 2 1 to identify these type 3 orders it is best to use the incidence condition described in the above proposition that is a type 3 order must simultaneously be contained in each of the orders which have associated vertices incident to its vertex for example we may examine the vertex marked in blue from figure 8 2 it should be contained in and also in each of the following orders 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 it should also be contained in a sixth as yet unidentified type 2 order but the information we have so far is sufficient to determine that our type 3 lattice must be the following 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 proposition 8 5 2 let be the following lattice in o 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 then is a type 3 order in o i e it satisfies the conditions of proposition 8 5 1 proof just as in the type 2 case we may check that is an order by verifying the conditions of proposition 8 1 1 next in this case 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 so clearly 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 60 so condition a is satisfied with an aim to producing m we calculate 2 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp zp zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp p 1 zp p 2 zp p 1 zp p 1 zp zp p 1 zp p 1 zp 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 therefore we have that m p 2 p 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 thus m is self dual and condition b is also satisfied so is a type 3 order in o by applying this method of detecting a type 3 order based on the surrounding already identified orders we can obtain all the type 3 orders we list those nearest to the origin in blue in figure 8 4 once more we define algebra valuations corresponding to the type 3 vertices this time we note that each type 3 vertex lies at the barycenter of a triangle created by three type 1 vertices and therefore we define the relevant valuation by averaging over the three type 1 valuations to use the work of our examples in section 8 3 we take 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 and for 61 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 figure 8 4 octonion orders associated to the vertices of type 3 our chosen basis b of o take the intermediate function v 3 bi as follows v 3 b 1 1 3 1 0 0 1 3 v 3 b 1 1 3 1 0 0 1 3 v 3 b 2 1 3 1 1 0 2 3 v 3 b 2 1 3 1 1 0 2 3 v 3 b 3 1 3 0 1 0 1 3 v 3 b 3 1 3 0 1 0 1 3 v 3 b 4 1 3 0 0 0 0 v 3 b 4 1 3 0 0 0 0 we again use this to find the valuation of several octonion elements for a lattice element x 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 we have val 3 x min 1 1 3 2 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 2 3 1 3 0 0 0 for a lattice element x m 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 we have val 3 x min 1 3 2 3 1 1 3 1 3 2 3 1 1 3 0 0 1 3 62 for a lattice element x 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 we have val 3 x min 1 3 2 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 2 3 1 3 1 0 0 2 3 for a lattice element x p 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 we have val 3 x min 1 3 2 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 2 3 1 3 1 1 1 1 this valuation leads us to the lattice sequence p 1 m p pm p once again algebra valuations and lattice sequences for all type 3 vertices can be found in this way 8 6 other points in a we conclude this chapter by identifying the algebra valuations and lattice sequences corresponding to a few points in the apartment which do not lie on vertices in figure 8 5 the points that we will address are marked in orange and green starting with the point in orange we note that it is at the barycenter of a triangle formed by and two type 3 vertices therefore we can use the averaging strategy we have already employed to construct a new algebra valuation corresponding to that point however it will be simpler for us to note that the point also lies two thirds of the distance from to a type 2 vertex that we have already identified therefore for each bi b we can take v 4 bi 2 3 v 2 bi where v 2 was defined in section 8 4 more explicitly v 2 bi 0 if i 4 3 1 3 if i 2 1 1 3 if i 1 2 again our new valuation will be val 4 x min v 4 aibi for x aibi o now we work backwards to find the lattices which will make up our associated lattice sequence let val 4 0 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 63 figure 8 5 other octonion orders in a be the octonion order identified to our point in a and corresponding to the r 0 index in our desired lattice sequence then we should have that val 4 x 0 for all x val 4 0 recall that each i is an integer therefore for min 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 0 the lowest valuations we may have are 1 2 1 with the rest equal to zero our order is now identified as val 4 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 we note that the next jump in our lattice sequence occurs at val 4 1 3 which we may identify in a similar way by considering min 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 1 3 in this case we find that val 4 1 3 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 the following jump in our lattice sequence occurs at val 4 2 3 which we again identify min 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 3 64 in this case we find that val 4 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 finally we identify val 4 0 min 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 1 in this case we find that val 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 p val 4 0 therefore we obtain the lattice sequence corresponding to our orange point in a 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 finally we tackle the point labeled in green in figure 8 5 which we notice lie halfway between and the type 3 vertex that we identified in section 8 5 1 therefore we set v 5 bi 1 2 v 3 bi where v 3 was defined in section 8 5 1 explicitly v 5 b 1 1 6 v 5 b 1 1 6 v 5 b 2 1 3 v 5 b 2 1 3 v 5 b 3 1 6 v 5 b 3 1 6 v 5 b 4 0 v 5 b 4 0 again our new valuation will be val 5 x min v 5 aibi for x aibi o we again work backwards to find the lattices which will make up our associated lattice sequence again let val 5 0 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 be the octonion order identified to our green point in a and corresponding to the r 0 index in our desired lattice sequence then since min 1 1 6 2 1 3 3 1 6 1 1 6 2 1 3 3 1 6 4 0 the lowest valuations we may have are 1 2 3 1 and the rest are equal to zero our order is now identified as val 5 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 65 the next jump in our lattice sequence occurs at val 4 1 6 which we identify by considering min 1 1 6 2 1 3 3 1 6 1 1 6 2 1 3 3 1 6 4 1 6 in this case we find that val 5 1 6 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 we spare the reader the remaining arguments to show that the following lattices make up the rest of our lattice sequence val 5 1 3 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 val 5 1 2 val 5 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 val 5 5 6 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 val 5 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 p val 5 0 these lattices now form the lattice sequence associated to the green point in our
