fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 florencia orosz hunziker abstract let f 25 be the family of irreducible lowest weight modules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 which are not isomorphic to verma modules let l 25 0 be the virasoro vertex operator algebra of central charge 25 we prove that the fusion rules for the l 25 0 modules in f 25 are in correspondence with the tensor rules for the irreducible finite dimensional representations of sl 2 c extending the known correspondence between modules for the virasoro algebras of dual central charges 1 and 25 1 introduction in 1990 in their important paper ff feigin and fuchs described the structure of verma modules for the virasoro algebra and the homomorphisms between them they stated the projection formulas for singular vectors on the density modules and described the duality between the category of verma modules with central charge c and the category of verma modules with central charge 26 c for c c in particular they established an anti equivalence of additive categories between the category of verma modules for v irc 1 and the verma modules for v irc 25 which assigns the verma module of central charge 1 and lowest weight h m 1 h to the verma module of central charge 25 and lowest weight 1 h m 25 1 h and reverses morphisms on the other hand segal on his 1981 paper se noted a correspondence between the finite dimensional irreducible representations of sl 2 c and certain representations of the virasoro algebra of central charge 1 by a dual pair type of argument later frenkel and zhu proved in fz that for c c l c 0 the irreducible quotient of the verma module m c 0 has a vertex algebra operator algebra structure and that the irreducible quotient of m c h l c h is an l c 0 module for h c the vertex algebra version of the decomposition noted in se was proved by dong and griess in dg in his doctorate thesis s styrkas used the dual pair decomposition of segal to state an antiequivalence of tensor categories between the category of irreducible finite dimensional modules for sl 2 c and the semisimple tensor category generated by the irreducible l 1 0 modules which are not verma modules i e the modules of the from l 1 n 2 4 for n 0 milas independently proved in m that the fusion rules for the irreducible non verma l 1 0 modules coincide with the tensor rules of the irreducible finite dimensional representations of sl 2 c more recently mcrae proved in mc using the fusion rules from m 1 ar x iv 1 81 0 03 16 0 v 2 m at h q a 3 o ct 2 01 9 2 fusion rules that the semisimple category generated by the l 1 0 modules l 1 m 2 4 for m 0 is equivalent to the tensor structure of finite dimensional irreducible sl 2 c modules modified by a 3 cocycle in this work following the methods in m and fz 2 together with results in z l w we show that the fusion rules for the non verma irreducible modules for the virasoro algebra l 25 0 are the same as the tensor rules for the finite dimensional irreducible representations of sl 2 c our main result is theorem 1 1 let m n 0 then dim i l 25 1 r 2 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 2 4 1 if r m n m n 2 m n 0 otherwise the fact that the fusion rules for this distinguished family of l 25 0 modules coincide with those of sl 2 c generalizes the existing duality between the represen tations for l 1 0 and l 25 0 namely our result shows that the relation between the virasoro algebras of central charge 1 and 25 is deeper than simply a duality of additive categories as illustrated in figures 1 and 2 below l 25 0 l 1 0 sl 2 c figure 1 dualities between sl 2 c and the virasoro vertex alge bras of central charges 1 and 25 l 25 1 n 2 2 4 l 1 n 2 4 vn figure 2 correspondence of modules in the dualities between rep resentations of l 25 0 l 1 0 and sl 2 c our theorem suggests that this equivalence can be extended to an equivalence of semisimple tensor categories this tensor category equivalence will be described in a future paper in m 1 and ma logarithmic extensions of intertwining operators between the l 1 0 modules were studied and this technique can be adapted to the case of central charge 25 with the aim of applying the logarithmic tensor product theory hlz to the category cl 25 0 moreover in light of the corresponding feigin fuchs duality d it is an interesting question to explore whether this equivalence of fusion rules and tensor categories holds for general w algebras aknowledgements the author would like to thank igor frenkel for suggesting the study of the case of the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 the author would fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 3 also like to thank igor frenkel jinwei yang antun milas and gregg zuckerman for

rank of v moreover the action of the virasoro algebra is compatible with the gradation and the action of t namely l 0 v nv wtv v for n z v vn and l 1 t the conformal dimension of an operator y a z is m if a vm namely an vl vl m n 1 definition 2 5 a module w for a vertex operator algebra v is a q graded vector space w n q wn where for w wn we write wtw n 2 4 such that dim wn for n q and wn 0 for n

weak module w for a vertex algebra v satisfies all the axioms of a v module except possibly 2 4 2 5 or 2 6 fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 7 definition 2 7 flm let v be a vertex operator algebra and let w be a v module the contragredient module w n q hom wn c has the following v module structure y w a z f w f yw exl 1 x 2 l 0 a z 1 w for a v f w m w where denotes the usual paring between a vector space and its dual vector space definition 2 8 a vertex algebra v is called simple if it is irreducible as a v module definition 2 9 a vertex algebra v is rational if it has finitely many non isomorphic irreducible modules and every finitely generated module is a direct sum of irre ducibles 2 2 1 the vertex algebra l c 0 for c c we first define the v ir module mc as mc u v ir u v ir cc where v ir n 1 cln cc v ir n 2 cln where cc c 10 is one dimenensional and its v ir module structure is given by ln 10 0 for n 1 and c 10 c 10 given the linear isomorphism mc u v ir we use this identification to denote elements of mc the vertex operator algebra structure in mc is given by a gradation wt l n 1 l n 2 l nk 10 k i 1 ni n 1 n 2 nk 2 b vacuum vector 0 10 c translation

we write y z n z nz n 1 then n 1 ln using the description of singular vectors for all verma modules given by feigin and fuchs ff we have the following result which determines the vertex algebra structure of l c 0 for c c lemma 2 11 let cp q 1 6 p q 2 pq then i l c 0 mc if and only if c 6 cp q for any p q 2 p q 1 ii l cp q 0 mcp q vp q where vp q denotes the only up to scalar singular vector in mcp q and vp q denotes the submodule generated by this singular vector therefore l c 0 has a vertex algebra structure given by that onmc when c 6 cp q or by the quotient vertex algebra structure on mc vp q when c cp q remark 2 12 it was conjectured in fz and proved in w that the vertex virasoro algebra l c 0 is rational if and only if c cp q for p q 2 and p q 1 in particular this implies that l 25 0 is an irrational virasoro vertex algebra we will show in this work that as in the case of l 1 0 l 25 0 admits a natural distinguished family of countably many irreducibles it was proved in fz that m c h is an l c 0 module with yw y 2 2 2 the zhu algebra and intertwining operators we need to recall some defini tions and results from z and fz following the exposition from w if v is a vertex operator algebra zhu proved with a slightly modified formula as explained in remark 2 20 that v has an algebra structure with the bilinear map determined by a b resz y a z 1 z wta z b for homogeneous a and for all b v also recall that if o v is defined as the linear span of elements of the form resz y a z 1 z wta z 2 b for a b v with a homogeneous then o v v is a two sided ideal with the algebra strucute given by definition 2 13 z the zhu algebra of v is defined as a v v o v a v is a unitary associative algebra for any vertex operator algebra v and is in its center we will denote by a the projection on a v of an element a v if fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 9 w is a v module we define the a v module a w with the analogous formulas first we set the following left and right action of v on w by a w resz y a z 1 z wta z w w a resz y a z 1 z wta 1 z w for any homogenous a v and w w next we let o w be the subspace of w linearly spanned by all elements of the form resz y a z 1 z wta z 2 w for homogenous a v and w w finally we define a w w o w it was proved in fz that a w is an a v bimodule lemma 2 14 z 1 let v be a vertex operator algebra and let w be a lowest weight v module with lowest weight h and with l 0 weight decomposition w n 0 w n h define w n w h n and call w n the degree n subspace of w then w 0 is a natural a v module with the action determined by the fact that a acts on w 0 by 1 degaawta 1 for any homogeneous a v lemma 2 15 z let v be a vertex operator algebra let w 1 be a submodule of the v module w then a w w 1 a w w 1 where w 1 denotes the image of w 1 under the projection w a w for later use we recall the definition of intertwining operators definition 2 16 fhl let w 1 w 2 and w 3 be a triple of modules for a vertex operator algebra v an intertwining operator y of type w 3 w 1 w 2 is a map y w 1 w 2 w 3 z that satisfies the following properties 1 truncation for any wi wi i 1 2 w 1 nw 2 0 for n 0 2 l 1 derivative for any w 1 w 1 y l 1 w 1 z d dz y w 1 z 3 jacobi identity in hom w 1 w 2 w 3 x y z we have z 1 x y z yw 3 u x y w 1 y z 1 y x z y w 1 y yw 2 u x y 1 x z y y yw 1 u z w 1 y 10 fusion rules for u v and w 1 w 1 we denote the space of all the intertwining operators of the type w 3 w 1 w 2 by i w 3 w 1 w 2 we recall the following important result due to fz and refined in l 1 l 2 lemma 2 17 let v be a vertex operator algebra and let w 1 w 2 and w 3 be lowest weight v modules if w 3 is irreducible then dim i w 3 w 1 w 2 dim homa v a w 1 a v w 2 0 w 3 0 finally we mention the following lemma which will be useful in future computa tions its proof appears in hl and l 1 lemma 2 18 let wi for i 1 2 3 be lowest weight modules for a vertex operator algebra v then dim i w 3 w 1 w 2 dim i w 3 w 2 w 1 dim i w 2 w 1 w 3 definition 2 19 l 2 let v be a vertex operator algebra let v v c t t 1 and d l 1 1 1 d dt then the lie algebra of v is g v v dv with bracket determined by a m b n i 0 m i aib m n i where we denote a m a tm dv if we set dega m wta m 1 then we have a triangular decomposition g v g v g v 0 g v if u is a g v 0 module then we define l 2 f u ind u g u g v g v 0 u where g v acts by 0 we define f u f u j u where j u denotes the intersection of all the kernels of all g v homomorphisms from f u to weak mod ules remark 2 20 in the original definition of the zhu algebra z the product is given by a b resz y a z 1 z wta z b for homogeneous a and for all b v while o v is defined as the linear span of the elements of the form resz y a z 1 z wta z 2 b fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 11 in this case an element a a v v o v acts on the top level of a module w as awta 1 for homogeneous a v and everything in section 2 2 2 works in a parallel way we work with the slightly modified formula presented in section 2 2 2 for convenience in the computations 3 the fusion rules for l 25 0 consider the vertex operator algebra l 25 0 and let us denote by f 25 its dis tinguished family of irreducible modules which are not verma modules namely f 25 l 25 1 n 2 4 n 2 remark 3 1 note that l 25 1 and l 25 1 1 4 are irreducible verma modules and therefore they do not belong in f 25 let m n r 2 we want to describe the space of intertwining operators i l 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 from the irreducibility of the non equivalent l 25 0 modules l 25 1 n 2 4 n 2 it follows that dim i l 25 1 k 2 4 l 25 0 l 25 1 n 2 4 1 if k n 0 otherwise which together with lemma 2 18 implies that dim i l 25 1 k 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 l 25 0 1 if k n 0 otherwise therefore we assume that m n 3 from now on we want to use lemma 2 17 to bound the fusion rules we first recall the a v structure in the case of the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 from fz and w we know that lemma 3 2 if l 25 0 is the conformal vector l 210 then there exists an isomorphism of associative algebras a l 25 0 c y 3 1 n 7 yn 3 2 where l 2 l 1 10 moreover as shown in fz we have the following description of the c y module structure for the module a w 25 h for any h c lemma 3 3 as a c y module a m 25 h c x y 3 3 12 fusion rules the isomorphism is given by c x y a m 25 h xnym 7 l 2 2 l 1 l 0 n m 1 h in this isomorphism the lowest weight vector is identified with 1 c x y and the actions left and right actions of c y are described by y p x y xp x y p x y y yp x y 3 4 for p x y c x y we are interested in hom a l 25 1 m 2 4 c y l 25 1 n 2 4 0 l 1 1 r 2 4 0 so we first analyze a m 25 1 m 2 4 c y l 25 1 n 2 4 0 it is easy to see that as a c y module l 25 1 n 2 4 0 c 1 n 2 4 3 5 where we identify the image of the lowest weight vector 1 1 n 2 4 with 1 and have that y 1 1 n 2 4 1 we recall the following important results lemma 3 4 z in the quotient space a l 25 0 l 25 0 o l 25 0 l 1 l 0 v 0 3 6 for any v l 25 0 lemma 3 5 w in a l 25 0 we have that for n 1 v l 25 0 l n v n 1 l 2 l 1 l 0 v 3 7 using the method described by milas in m we get the following lemma 3 6 in a m 25 1 m 2 4 c y l 25 1 n 2 4 0 l j 1 l jk v 1 m 2 4 k r 1 jr 1 n 2 4 y r k v 1 m 2 4 3 8 k r 1 jr 1 n 2 4 x r k v 1 m 2 4 3 9 where r k jr 1 jk 1 m 2 4 fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 13 proof by 3 4 it is clear that the right hand side of 3 8 and 3 9 are equivalent so it is enough to prove that 3 8 holds we prove it by induction on k if k 1 then we have that l j v 1 m 2 4 l j v 1 m 2 4 1 3 10 next using lemma 3 5 together with 3 2 3 10 and 3 5 we have that l j v 1 m 2 4 v 1 m 2 4 j 1 y l 0 1 3 11 v 1 m 2 4 j 1 n 2 4 y l 0 1 j 1 n 2 4 y l 0 v 1 m 2 4 1 3 12 j 1 n 2 4 y 1 m 2 4 v 1

following the analysis m we note that the term in the right hand side of 3 8 coincides with p j 1 jk where l j 1 l jk wo p j 1 jk wj 1 jk 3 15 if we fix n 2 4 1 and 2 n 2 4 m 2 4 x for d the density module as in definition 2 1 2 next we apply the theory of singular vectors from section 2 1 3 tom 25 1 m 2 4 from the work of feigin and fuchs ff we know that for each m 2 there is a singular vector vm 1 in m 25 1 m 2 4 of weight 1 m 2 4 m 1 such that if vm 1 denotes the submodule generated by vm 1 then m 25 1 m 2 4 vm 1 l 25 1 m 2 4 note that in this case t 1 p m 1 q 1 1 in the 14 fusion rules notation of section 2 1 3 and 2 2 becomes f 2 m 1 1 n 2 4 1 2 m 2 n 2 4 x 1 m 2 2 l m 2 2 2 m 2 n 2 4 x am 1 1 l 0 2 m 2 n 2 4 x am 1 1 l 0 4 l 2 ln 2 we have that am 1 1 l 0 m 2 1 l m 2 l 1 m 2 2 1 l

virasoro algebra of central charge 25 15 where we denote lm n m n 2 m n 4 m n 2 3 17 remark 3 7 the central charge c 25 for the virasoro vertex operator algebra is fundamental to obtaining the simplified formulas for the projection of singular vectors on density modules this central charge which corresponds to t 1 in our computations is what allows us to get formula 3 16 note that the dual central charge c 1 corresponds to t 1 and that the singular vector formulas become simplified only for both of these dual values of t we get the following result lemma 3 8 let n m 3 then as an a l 25

c x y c y c 1 n 2 4 3 19 now using projection formula for the singular vector in v 1 m 1 on dn 2 4 1 2 n 2 4 m 2 4 x that we obtained in 3 16 we see that for m 3 v 1 m 1 w 0 i lm n x 1 i 2 4 wm 1 3 20 next using lemma 2 15 together with 3 19 and 3 15 we obtain that a l 25 1 m 2 4 a l 25 0 l 25 1 n 2 4 0 c x i lm n x 1 i 2 4 in particular it follows from lemma 3 8 that if m n 3 then a l 25 1 m 2 4 a

replacing f m 25 1 n 2 4 0 with m 25 1 n 2 4 and f m 25 1 r 2 4 0 with m 25 1 r 2 4 following the argument in l 2 we obtain an intertwining operator of type m 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 m 25 1 n 2 4 3 21 that we denote by y 1 the contragradient module m 25 1 r 2 4 is not irreducible so it is not of lowest weight type so we have that l 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 r 2 4 m 25 1 r 2 4 namely if f 0 hom m 25 1 r 2 4

obtained of type m 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 m 25 1 n 2 4 we first prove the following lemma 3 10 let m n r 3 with m n r and let y 1 be the intertwining operator obtained in 3 21 let v 1 n 2 4 be the

coefficients in 3 23 coincide with the coefficients in 3 9 if we replace x with 1 r 2 4 and exchange the roles of 1 n 2 4 and 1 m 2 4 therefore we have that 18 fusion rules 1 25 1 r 2 4 y 1 125 1 m 2 4 z v 1 n 2 4 0 if and only if the corresponding projection in a l 25 1 n 2 4 a 25 0 l 25 1 m 2 4 0 vanishes we know from 3 18 with the roles of m and n exchanged that a l 25 1 n 2 4 a 25 0 l 25 1 m 2 4 0 c x i lm n x 1 i 2 4 since m n we have that ln m lm n by hypothesis a priory r lm n but using that r n we have that r ln m therefore we have that the projection in a l 25 1 n 2 4 a 25 0 l 25 1 m 2 4 0 vanishes which implies that 3 22 holds proposition 3 11 let 3 m n r let r lm n and let y 1 be the intertwining operator obtained in 3 21 then w 3 y 1 w 1 x w 2 0 for any w 1 l 25 1 m 2 4 w 2 m 25 1 n 2 2 4 m 25 1 n 2 4 and w 3 m 25 1 r 2 4 m 25 1 r 2 4 proof it follows from the jacobi identity together lemma 3 10 let y 1 be the operator defined by y 1 w 1 x w 2 y 1 w 1 x 1 n w 2 3 24 where n m 25 1 n 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 is the canonical projection then y 1 is a non trivial intertwining operator of type m 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 next we use that i m 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 i l 25 1 n 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 m 25 1 r 2 4 3 25 by our assumption 3 m n r and r lm n so that m n 2 r m n 2 it follows that r m 2 n r m 2 namely n lr m let y 2 l 25 1 n 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 m 25 1 r 2 4 be the image of y 1 under the isomorphism 3 25 let u 3 l 25 1 n 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 and let u 1 l 25 1 m 2 4 then for the fusion rules for the virasoro algebra of central charge 25 19 lowest weight vector 1 1 r 2 4 m 25 1 r 2 4 we have that u 3 y 2 125 1 m 2 4 x l j 1 l jk 11 r 2 4 k i 1 x ji 1 d dx 1 ji x ji 1 m 2 4 u 3 y 2 125 1 m 2 4 x 1 1 r 2 4 k i 1 x ji 1 d dx 1 ji x ji 1 m 2 4 dx m 2 4 r

depends on y 2 which we may assume to be equal to 1 note that again the coefficients in 3 26 coincide with the coefficients in 3 9 if we replace x with 1 n 2 4 and exchange the roles of 1 r 2 4 and 1 m 2 4 therefore if we denote by v 1 r 2 4 the singular vector generating the maximal submodule in m 25 1 r 2 4 we have that 1 25 1 n 2 4 y 2 125 1 m 2 4 z v 1 r 2 4 0 if and only if the corresponding projection in a l 25 1 r 2 4 a 25 0 l 25 1 m 2 4 0 vanishes we know from 3 18 that a l 25 1 r 2 4 a 25 0 l 25 1 m 2 4 0 c x i lr m x 1 i 2 4 since by hypothesis n lr m it is clear that u 3 y 2 u 1 x v 1 r 2 4 0 for any u 3 l 25 1 n 2 4 and u 1 l 25 1 m 2 4 hence if we denote the canonical projection by r m 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 r 2 4 and define for u 1 l 25 1 m 2 4 u 2 l 25 1 r 2 4 y 2 u 1 x u 2 y 2 u 1 x 1 r u 2 we obtain a non trivial intertwining operator y 2 of type l 25 1 n 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 l 25 1 r 2 4 20 fusion rules finally if y 3 is the image of y 2 under the isomorphism in 3 25 then y 3 i l 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 is a non trivial intertwining operator if instead 3 m r n using an analogous argument and the fact that r ln m we end up with an intertwining operator y 2 of type l 25 1 r 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 4 using lemma 2 18 proposition 3 9 together with the discussion above we obtain the following result theorem 3 12 let m n 0 then dim i l 25 1 r 2 2 4 l 25 1 m 2 2 4 l 25 1 n 2 2 4 1 if r m n m n 2 m n 0 otherwise remark 3 13 as we mentioned in remark 3 7 the central charge c 25 was critical to obtaining the correspondence of fusion rules for the family f 25 of l 25 0 modules and for the irreducible finite dimensional sl 2 c modules the singular vector formulas become simplified when t 1 and t 1 in 2 1 which correspond to dual the central charges c 1
