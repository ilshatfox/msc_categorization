disruption of supernovae and would be direct collapsars john middleditch university of california retired dated december 4 2020 abstract the speed of an intensity pattern of polarization currents on a circle induced within a star by its rotating magnetized core will exceed the speed of light for a sufficiently large star and or rapid rotation and will in turn generate focused electromagnetic beams which disrupt them upon core collapse within such a star the emergence of these beams will concentrate near the two rotational poles driving jets of matter into material previously ejected via the same excitation mechanism acting through the pre core collapse rotation of its magnetized stellar core s this interpenetration of material light days in extent from the progenitor produces a significant fraction of the total supernova luminosity and the magnitude and time of maximum of this contribution both vary with the progenitor s rotational orientation the net effect is to render supernovae unusable as standard candles without further detailed understanding leaving no firm basis at this time to favor any cosmology including those involving dark energy thus we are not now nor have we ever been in an era of precision cosmology nor are we likely to be anytime soon mass loss induced through the same mechanism also keeps aggregates of gas and plasma in the early universe or at any other epoch from forming the billion solar mass stars which have been suggested to produce billion solar mass black holes via direct collapse but can also provide a signature to predict core collapse some months in advance we examine this mechanism through pulsar emission via polarization currents in which the emission power from any coaxial annulus of plasma decays only as 1 distance for two exactly opposite rotational latitudes given by arccos c v where c is the speed of light and v c is the speed of the rotating excitation we investigate why this effect results from circularly supraluminal excitations as well as providing a discussion of and further evidence for the effect in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey 1 ar x iv 1 91 0 03 78 9 v 8 as tr o ph h e 3 d ec 2 02 0 i introduction an obliquely magnetized neutron star with an angular velocity of radians s will excite polarization currents in the surrounding plasma at projected radius r with a circumfer ential pattern which for r c exceeds the speed of light the model 1 7 of pulsar emission which takes such supraluminally excited polarization currents into account is the only model thus far to predict the observed emission bands and their increasing spacing with radio frequency 8 in the ghz spectrum of the crab pulsar interpulse in addition to matching its observed spectrum out to the ray over 15 orders of magnitude see also 9 this model also predicts that the emitted power will obey a 1 distance law for two opposite spin latitudes on the sky which approach at large distances arccos c v where c is the speed of light and v r c is the velocity of the update of the circumferential polarization current pattern at these latitudes the curve of the observer time as a function of source time is cubic i e there is a point of inflection for one periodic value of observer time where extended ranges of source times map onto any small interval centered at these observer times fig 2 of 2 as a result a single very sharp peak appears 10 in the observer s pulse profile when near that time phase see the lowermost curve in fig 1 thus for any given pulsar 12 observers can tell when they are at or near one of these two favored latitudes by the pulse profiles that they record at more equatorial latitudes the single pulse splits into two separate pulses while at more polar latitudes the single

then to the half of that sample whose pulse widths are less than 3 of their pulse periods eral discussion of supraluminal excitations and focused beams and their effects on pulsars supernovae the sun hercules x 1 and other objects section x concludes ii old and new evidence evidence for this effect in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey 14 was first presented in 2009 but a more recent attempt by another group 15 to duplicate the results based roughly on the same maximum likelihood method mlm 16 employed in 2009 failed to find the effect the stepwise mlm does not rely on a simple functional form for the luminosity 4 fig 3 from 11 left lower horizontal axis the cumulative populations of 497 pulsars from the parkes multibeam survey with pulse widths less than 3 of their periods which fall into binned distances with centers between 2 and 11 kpc plotted against the log of the product of their 1400 mhz fluxes and their ne 2001 distances from 19 and 20 the spread of the different flux times distance products at a given population fraction diminishes as their components become more luminous and less detection limited indicating a 1 distance law right upper horizontal axis the same for a synthetic population of pulsars whose fluxes obey the inverse square law and the spread in the flux times distance products does not diminish but would collapse for flux times distance squared products the two families of curves are both in order of increasing distance from left to right at a population fraction of 0 2 5 function l but instead iteratively determines k for the k th equal step in luminosity it defines the logarithm of the likelihood function by the logarithm of the sum over all sources of the logarithms of the k every time a source falls into the k th luminosity bin minus the sum over all sources of logarithms of a sum over all j for all the j th luminosity bins above the minimum luminosity defined by an unspecified function of the redshift of the source the inner kernel of this subtracted term is also multiplied by the width of all the steps in luminosity l for dimensional consistency a constraint is also added with a lagrange multiplier needless to say the adaptation of such a method more appropriate to clusters of sources than to pulsars within the milky way disk is non trivial this more recent study of 15 included only the half of those pulsars in the sample with pulse profiles whose peak widths were greater than 3 of their pulse periods 17 unlike those in the bottom curve in fig 1 and in doing so used pulsars for which there was no expectation of a 1 distance law the 2009 study only excluded these after submission the results for this restricted sample of 497 pulsars were much more dramatic as can be seen in fig 2 a good guess as to the source of the disagreement is the difference in the number of bins chosen with the smaller number being more desirable to show the effect in a limited data set as can be seen in fig 3 where cumulative populations were made for eight different subsets over a factor of four in distance meanwhile it is far more important to establish the validity of the violation of the inverse square law independently of the binning issues of the mlm if need be the sets from fig 3 used in the mlm method will likely reproduce the result of fig 2 it is actually easy to show that the narrow pulse profile restricted sample trends toward a 1 distance law as the pulsar fluxes times distances increase above the detection limited values below 2 mjy kpc see fig 3 while the mjy kpc spread of the curves of the actual data sample at the left trends toward zero at high mjy kpc population fraction a signature of a 1 distance law the synthetic sample at right formulated from an inverse square law retains its spread of 0 6 a factor of 4 between 2 5 and 10 kpc since it would require multiplication by another factor of distance to collapse the population is dense enough fig 4 so that its upper cutoff orange dashed line on a log flux log distance graph follows a numerical slope of 1 well and a slope of 2 poorly lying below above the steeper black line at small large distances the black arrows show that the inverse square law line does not cut through the same fraction of the luminosity function 6 fig 4 a contour plot of 577 pulsars from the parkes multibeam pulsar survey whose pulse profiles consist of a single sharp peak with a half width in time less than 3 4 of the period f 0 w 50 34 the numerical slope of the two parallel dashed lines red and orange is 1 corresponding to a 1 distance law while that of the steeper dashed line black is 2 corresponding to an inverse square law the arrows show what the span of the luminosity function would be if the opposite pairs were appropriately centered which the red arrow pairs are slope of 1 and the black pairs are not slope of 2 in the way that the 1 distance law red arrows does well this conclusion is susceptible to having larger populations near one of the two extremes of distance as opposed to mid distances but this is clearly not the case however as the densest part s of the distribution 7 fig 5 a similar contour plot of 407 cepheid variables the numerical slope of the mostly upper dashed line red is 1 corresponding to a 1 distance law while that of the steeper line black is 2 corresponding to an inverse square law the cepheids actually track slightly steeper with distance than a power law of 2 a sign of interstellar extinction are located at mid distances indeed it is remarkable how well this distribution s upper boundary follows a 1 distance law in spite of it not having been corrected for its denser population at mid distances by its very nature fig 3 does not suffer from this problem we can check this contour plotting method on other objects which are known to follow an inverse square law by analyzing its response to the cepheids in our galaxy named after the variable star cephei the fourth brightest star in the constellation cepheus 8 the king the cepheids are massive stars whose period of variability has a near linear relationship to their luminosity thus once we know the interstellar extinction along the line of sight to the particular cepheid see e g 21 we can infer its distance from the difference between its absolute and apparent magnitudes figure 5 confirms the contour plot reflects an inverse square law for the cepheids iii how and why the inverse square law is violated supraluminal excitations may result in a focusing of an increasing extended interval of source time onto a small interval of observer time provided the excitation is accelerated 22 any circular excitation of constant speed is always accelerated toward the center of its circle see fig 6 if there is to be any focusing of such a supraluminal excitation a point source polarization current traveling in a circle the focus must lie on the cone whose apex coincides with the source with its axis and opening colinear with the instantaneous direction of motion and whose half angle is given by arccos c v where c is the speed of light in whatever medium and v is the speed of the excitation this opening angle is the compliment arcsin c v of that of the usual cerenkov cone for convenience we will label this as the virtual cerenkov cone or vcc any temporal information in a part of the source that travels toward the observer at the speed of light and with zero acceleration collapses onto a single arrival time as can be seen in fig 7 the projected separation of the sources along the line of excitation is preserved in the outgoing wave but the lessening distance penalty for perpendicular offset reduces the difference in their arrival times at increasingly greater distance the same mechanism for acoustic waves is responsible for the sonic boom centripetal acceleration of the sources toward the center of a circle will always for the right radius do better than the sonic boom as we will see below on the other hand if the observer is not on the vcc of the excitation the effects of many nearby sources on the path of excitation will arrive at different times no matter what the distance the virtual cerenkov cone of circular motion at r times the wave speed in the medium will always have a point tangent to the smaller concentric circle with a radius rlc where the angular motion of radians per second corresponds to exactly the wave speed or rlc c for electromagnetic radiation extension of this circle in the directions of its 9 fig 6 the geometry of circularly supraluminal motion the instantaneous velocity of r times the wave speed of light or some other propagating wave is in the x direction at point a x y z 0 r 0 the variable measures the clockwise angle along the circle of radius r the virtual cerenkov cone whose axis is parallel to the x axis but displaced in y by r is viewed from above the x y plane of the graph so that its edges form the upper line from point a and the lower line from a to b on the circle where the rotation of angle due to the motion on the r circle is exactly the wave speed i e the light cylinder when extended normal to the x y plane the dashed line at y 1 r is the projection onto the x y plane of the hyperbolic path of the cusp generated by the supraluminally updated polarization currents near point a normals becomes the light cylinder for convenience we will use dimensions so that rlc 1 the actual units may be re established by multiplying the constants including 10 fig 7 lower frame as in fig 6 the geometry of circularly supraluminal motion the instantaneous velocity is clockwise in the x direction at the top of the outer colored circle with minor major tick marks every 3 15 degrees upper frame the color coded contributions of polarization currents in the outer circle annulus of the lower frame for a pulsar with a period of 2 to the observer time vs source time curve which is also plotted in fig 10 in green functions of r by powers of rlc to make their units consistent within each equation with those of the powers of the variables x y and or z each of which has units of length with the help of fig 8 which has a tangent point on the r 1 circle at 21 5 11 fig 8 a series of nine huygen s wavelets produced by an excitation ending at the left part of a circular path pentagon having moved clockwise at five times the wave speed around the circle the sources from 10 h 20 m to 1 o clock an 80 span highlighted by the orange arc all contribute to the focus just past 2 o clock on the circle of radius 1 arccos 1 5 11 537 10 from the point at 11 hr 40 min being 20 min short of 12 hr we can see that the tangent point b in fig 6 30 for r 2 on the small circle is likely the first point of the focus curve we are seeking if we start with a point a on the x y plane at 0 r in fig 6 where the supraluminal excitation is traveling at rc in the x direction 12 i e rotating clockwise the vcc appears in profile with its axis parallel to the x axis this cone is tangent to the light cylinder at point b x y z 1 1 r 2 1 r 0 1 and in consequence the line from a to b coincides with the lower edge of the vcc the equation for this line is y r 2 1 x r 2 and we will need it to relate an arbitrary point at x y to the right of point b in fig 6 to the hyperbola on the vcc at the given y value in order to solve for its z values given the y value the x solution to eq 2 xo is the x fiducial in the equation for the corresponding hyperbola on the vcc which returns the value for z z r 2 1 x 2 xo 2 xo r y r 2 1 3 in order to find the exact path which will mark the location of the cusp focus on the vcc or confirm that it is an hyperbola we must compute the distance from a point on the r circle near a to the cusp focus point on the vcc as a function of x and y for a range of angles fig 6 on the r circle and test for a function that changes by only a small fraction of a light radian over a large range in of up to a radian which is exactly what we need to get many source times mapped into one or a limited range of observer time thus starting at an arbitrary point on the r circle near a at phase or r sin r cos 0 and computing the distance to near point b or 1 1 r 2 1 r 0 we get x y rx 2 2 rx sin 2 ry 1 cos 1 2 4 we notice that terms in y 2 and others that do not multiply trigonometric functions of have vanished leaving a simple y dependence for the factor 1 cos by removing a factor of rx from the square root and after using the binomial expansion for the 1 2 power we get rx 1 sin rx ry rx 2 1 cos 1 2 2 higher terms 5 where the represents the grouped terms following the initial 1 a factor of 1 4 from the binomial expansion coefficient has been absorbed by the choice of when squared 13 the first term rx after multiplying through the parenthesis to the 1 represents the macroscopic distance to the location of the beam focus the sin in the next term expands in radians initially to i e the distance is less for higher positive values which advance any excitation near point a in fig 6 to higher x toward the right and the observer beam focus this cancels the delay of the source rotation on the r circle on which motion toward positive costs time allowing many source points on the r circle to nearly simultaneously affect one observer point however since eq 5 is an approximation an error in this linear term in with a magnitude which is inversely proportional to distance is always present and in consequence prevents any signal from becoming infinite while producing the 1 distance law the next term in the expansion of the sin is 3 6 this cubic term has been mentioned above and its slow departure from 0 near 0 would lead to an infinite response at one particular observer time for every cycle if it were not for the residual linear term in we can see how the infinity would be generated by estimating the response at the observer position which is how much source time essentially in radians gets mapped into a small interval of observer time in effect the response is the derivative of source time as a function of observer time if high then a large interval of source time maps onto a small interval of observer time our f 3 6 as shown by the bottom curve in the left hand frame of fig 1 however is the observer time as a function of source time the inverse of the function we need we must turn the function on its side as fig 1 suggests thus we need the derivative of f f 6 f 1 3 6 differentiating we get f f 21 3 3 f 2 3 7 which is infinite for f 0 continuing there are more terms from the 1 cos of which the lowest one is when multiplied by the leading rx ry 2 rx 2 8 and a similar term 2 2 rx 9 14 comes from the part of the sin term in the 1 2 2 continuation of the binomial expansion if y 1 r the same value as the y for point b these terms cancel completely and permanently if y stays at 1 r as do the factors which do not multiply functions of thus the focus which starts at y 1 r at point b is always at y 1 r the next higher term in also comes from two contributions and for y 1 r after multiplying through by the leading rx amounts to 4 8 rx 10 which because it is a higher power than the cubic and decreases with distance is not important since the y value for the path of the focused beam remains at 1 r out to infinity the equation for the focused beam on the vcc is an hyperbola which is simple to express z r 2 1 x 2 1 1 r 2 y 1 r 11 figure 9 plots these curves in z x for r 1 1 to 5 0 we can see how an error in the linear term in call it where is the small angular value from fig 6 affects the pulse profiles when included in the contributions as has been done in fig 10 for a distance of 200 with 0 05 at this distance and dropping as 1 distance for the remaining 400 and 600 the peak heights of the pulse profiles of this figure do in fact represent a 1 distance law the actual value for the linear error coefficient multiplying is orders of magnitude smaller and numerically challenging to compute at sufficiently high resolution to show the effect as we will see in fig 11 no matter how small this effect however it will produce a 1 distance law with no distance law incorporated into the three sum curves in the right hand frame of fig 10 the more distant red lowermost peak is 0 5 logarithmic units higher than the blue uppermost peak which is three times closer exactly compensating an inverse square law when applied to a 1 distance law as long as the sampling over observer time is kept sufficiently fine and that over source time is done likewise to maintain a sufficiently large sample to produce the pulse profiles in the right hand frame there is no contribution too small to produce this effect again because the pulse profiles are otherwise infinitely narrow sixteen million plus points were needed across the vertical of the right hand frame in f fig 10 to reveal the 1 distance law for a modulation of 0 001 20 40 60 or for 15 fig 9 curves of the path of the cusp plotted in the z x plane for r 1 1 to 5 0 in steps of 0 1 distances of 20 000 40 000 and 60 000 half as many points led to an effect which matched the 1 distance law poorly whereas twice as many points led to a quantitatively excellent fit calculations were also done for a pulsar of period 2 at distances of 200 400 and 600 down to source time range of 10 ns and increments 10 15 s and an observer time range of a small fraction of 10 25 s by fine adjusting the distances by parts per 10 billion the centering effects of the peaks could be dithered although the responses at distances of 600 and 400 were essentially a dead heat after compensating for the inverse square law the response at 200 was down by 22 the first noticeable manifestation of an inverse 16 fig 10 observer time as a function of source time curves for a simulation of a pulsar with a period of 2 and plasma at r 5 for three different distances 200 top two blue curves 400 middle green curves and 600 radians bottom two red curves with the inverse square dependence removed unlike fig 6 a coordinate system where 0 corresponds to the x axis has been used hence the flat sections of the curves occur at 1 5 the three straight lines plot the product for the three distances where has been arbitrarily set to 0 05 at 200 and drops as 1 distance as does that defined in fig 6 the topmost and bottommost curves represent the sum of the original curves and the lines the same holds for the middle curve only with a smaller offset to the sum curve this curve is also plotted in figure 7 17 fig 11 observer time as a function of source time curves for an actual pulsar with a period of 2 and plasma at r 5 for three different distances 2 000 top blue curve 4 000 middle green curve and 6 000 radians bottom red curve and as with figure 10 the inverse square dependence removed unlike fig 6 a coordinate system where 0 corresponds to the x axis has been used hence the flat sections of the curves occur at 1 5 square law violation by contrast the result of calculations done with distances of 20 40 and 60 produced the strongest signal removing the inverse square dependence at the smallest distance 20 with a factor of fifty decrease in source time range for the 100 s of s calculations and a similar factor of 10 000 in observer time the 10 31 s resolution of this time in the 128 bit double precision becomes apparent 18 when doing these calculations it was important to use an observer time resolution sufficiently small to prevent contributions of one distance splitting into two neighboring pulse profile bins which caused the results to vary much more widely when adjusted the small observer time range of the actual peaks would almost always fall into a single bin with the pattern of a fixed number of adjacent empty bins between those with continuous content persisting for hundreds of consecutive bins further calculations were done for distances of 2 000 4 000 and 6 000 the source time resolution was 2 2 10 14 s and the observer time resolution was 1 9 10 31 s and the effects shown in fig 11 are much more robust producing about half on average but more for the example plotted of the logarithmic difference needed for a 1 distance law calculations were also done for distances of 20 000 40 000 and 60 000 with no real increase in the range of responses likely due to the larger distance range causing the observer time to hit the double precision limit for coarser resolutions the full effective timing advance delay of the focused beam at distance f as a func tion of at increasing distances becomes the sum of all terms f 3 6 constant 12 and the constant is absorbed into the macroscopic distance this relation can be rewritten as a standard cubic equation 3 6 6 f 0 13 which has the standard solution 3 f 8 3 9 f 2 1 2 1 3 3 f 8 3 9 f 2 1 2 1 3 14 to get the maximum peak height we differentiate this wrt f and set f 0 the result is f f 0 1 15 thus if with an increase in distance the slope of the linear term in decreases by the same relative measure then in consequence a greater range of the r circle contributes to the same narrow width of the pulse starting with a very small range of contribution in this can continue until almost two radians of the r circle contribute when the changing polarization limits further contributions see section v even when this happens the same range of contributes to an increasingly narrow pulse width in observer time as distance 19 increases so although the pulse height is restricted beyond this point to an inverse square law the narrowing of the pulse represents that much more energy from its increasing range of fourier components thus the energy of the pulse still obeys a 1 distance law this is known as focusing in time more quantitatively if we let represent a small interval distance within the pulse profile that the observer sees then there will be some limit which represents the contribution of source from the r circle whose energy falls within that for the observer limit 3 6 limit in radians 16 multiplying this equation by rlc restores the original units of distance as in the first term of eq 4 the square root of distance squared then dividing by c converts this into an equation involving time it can then be converted into radians by multiplying by the rotation frequency these three factors cancel exactly by definition so eq 16 involves radians and needs no conversion given that 3 6 is small we get limit the resulting pulse profile will be a single sharp peak of a certain narrow width at least until limit approaches 6 1 3 setting the two contributions equal we get an equation for in terms of 6 3 2 which gives the upper limit to above which the further contributions of source on the r circle will be limited unless and hence are reduced so that the 1 distance response can continue for greater ranges we will continue to explore this in section vii iv further considerations the equation for now that we know y 1 r and z x r is x r r sin x 2 r cos 1 r 2 r 2 1 x 2 1 1 r 2 1 2 17 if we differentiate this wrt time and set to 0 it simplifies drastically to x r 0 xr 18 and if we use the fact that d dt c it follows that dx dt c r 19 20 and this is even true on average between x 0 and 1 1 r 2 the velocity of the focus on the other hand is infinite and diverging in the z direction at z 0 and becomes finite at z 6 0 but remains greater than c even if ever so slightly for the rest of its path to infinity causality is not violated since the path is not a straight line also because the path of the focus is not radial from the contributing currents on the r circle the elements making up the focus represent parts of their spherical emission which change continuously as the focus moves outward but although these paths also curve over toward x once z is no longer 0 the progressive narrowing of the vcc s caused by the extreme deceleration prevents any secondary focus from forming the focus we ve discussed is the only focus for circularly supraluminal excitation we can derive the distance scale of change for the angle not restricted to the x y plane by taking the cross product of the vector to the source of excitations 0 r 0 with the vector x 1 r r r 2 1 x 2 1 1 r 2 and then dividing by the moduli of the two vectors namely r and rx respectively this quotient will yield the value of cos which for great distances will be slightly less than unity the cross product is r r 2 1 x 2 1 1 r 2 0 rx and the quotient is cos 1 1 x 2 1 1 r 2 2 20 at great distances we can estimate r 1 r where rx 21 as we might have guessed so far we have discussed the situation involving just a moving point source of emission whereas in the real world volume sources are involved and issues such as plasma screening rear their ugly heads however pulsars really do obey the 1 distance law we ve discussed here so there must be some way that pulsar emission can act like a lot of point sources possibly by field lines bunching together as suggested by 23 temporal structure as short as 0 4 ns 8 has been observed in the giant pulses of the crab pulsar yielding a range in timescale close to 80 million 33 ms 0 4 ns however we will see in section vii evidence for a range close to the square of this factor 21 v polarization the polarization of all sharp pulsar peaks observed in the universe swings from nearly 2 to 2 across the pulse or vice versa see e g fig 2 of 24 and this can be understood from figs 6 and 7 as the source time of the pulse moves across a macroscopic range for any given electric field element in the x y plane v with components vx vy 0 there is a polarization field w wx wy wz for the direction x y z which has to be perpendicular to and lie in the v plane so we have w 0 and w v 0 there is a penalty for the angle between v and w which is just the dot product between the two once w has been determined as described below for a radial electric field v cos sin in a right handed coordinate system with 0 for the x axis and using w 0 to substitute for wx we get wz wy z vx vy y x vx y vy z 2 x x 22 by using wx 2 wy 2 wz 2 1 all three components of w are determined for an azimuthal electric field v sin cos when substituting for wy we get the same equation with subscripts x and y exchanged the loci of these w s in the plane of the y direction and that perpendicular to the x z asymptote z r 2 1 x are simple to describe the results for both the radial and azimuthal cases are shown in fig 12 polarization offsets with magnitudes inversely proportional to distance are present in both orientations more importantly however is the fact that the angle of polarization swings drastically during the period of maximum response as is both predicted and observed although the residual offset of the points from 0 2 0 in the lower frame and the residual slope of the curves in the upper frame approaches 0 a residual slope does persist in the linear parts of the curves in the lower frame in addition when constructing a closer ns scale source time counterpart to fig 10 points at distances of 10 20 and 30 would have to be retarded in phase by 0 02122 0 03183 and 0 06364 radians respectively in order to have their inflections coincide on the ns scale with 1 5 an effect presumably due to approximation errors and or higher order than cubic terms of the expansion of observer time in powers of which also have a 1 distance dependence 22 fig 12 the x and y offsets from the z axis for a unit vector derived from the cross product of the polarization vector with at phase 3 2 in a right handed coordinate system i e approaching for a pulsar with a period of 2 seconds and plasma at r 5 for distances of 20 40 and 60 light radians loci for polarizations resulting from an electric field vector of cos sin radial and sin cos azimuthal are plotted in the bottom and top frames the color coding of the loci is the same as for fig 7 finally the dot products of the polarization vectors with their 0 as in fig 6 counterparts are shown in fig 13 which confirms they rotate as time progresses as well 23 as small differences between distances and electric field orientations in addition fig 13 confirms the above statement that the points of inflection in observer time as a function of source time occur at slightly different phases at different distances fig 13 the dot products of polarizations resulting from radial and azimuthal electrical field vectors on an annulus at r 5 with their counterparts at 0 using the convention of fig 6 for distances of 20 40 and 60 right frame a close up of a small section of the curve in the left frame with the three radial dot product paths offset up by 0 01 these two figures show at least for the r 5 case that the polarization vector has significant components of rotation other than the overall rotation with phase at 0 as in fig 6 for azimuthal and radial surface electric fields with a rate which is inversely proportional to 24 vi implications for known pulsars and supernovae a pulsars at least half of all known pulsars those whose pulse profiles consist of a single sharp pulse of width less than 3 of their periods have been discovered because their rotation axes are oriented nearly perpendicular to the line of sight to the earth isolated neutron stars must gravitationally concentrate interstellar plasma in order to emit radiation via cyclotron emission and or strong plasma turbulence mostly in a location outside of the light cylinder because this region marks the beginning of supraluminally generated focused radiation and the place in this region where plasma is most highly concentrated is just outside the light cylinder for isolated pulsars this emission occurs at 11 25 r 1 cos 4 1 00244 this means that the speed of the excitation v is just slightly greater than the speed of light c so that arcsin c v is almost 90 the cones of favored emission are very open and the favored emission is very nearly equatorial this may have observational consequences for example no sustained central source has been detected in any nearby modern sn except 1986 j and by now even that source does not appear to be consistent with a strongly magnetized pulsar remnant 26 it is also the only one viewed in the center of an edge on galaxy ngc 0891 if the rotation axis of any pulsar remnant is perpendicular to the ngc 0891 galactic plane then we are close to its favored direction of its emission 4 raising the possibility that the visibility of the central source in 1986 j is not entirely fortuitous the larger the star the more likely its angular momentum aligns with that of its host galaxy and all the more so for binary mergers the implications of a 1 distance law for pulsar emission even restricted to exactly two opposite spin latitudes are far reaching to coin a phrase it is responsible for the continued success of a long string of pulsar searches made over the last several decades it may be responsible for the utraluminous pulsed x ray source found in ngc 5907 27 although currently no radio pulsar has been discovered in any galaxy beyond the large and small magellanic clouds the square kilometer array may change that 28 the nearby galaxy in andromeda m 31 and another nearby spiral m 33 may yield many pulsars each however we are not there yet and care must be taken when making estimates of how far 25 fig 14 the 1400 mhz fluxes of the 577 parkes multibeam pulsars with pulse fwhma 0 034 cycles when placed at the distance to m 31 778 kpc assuming that all obey a strict 1 distance law and ignoring their individual placings in the milky way the dashed line at the left represents the approximate limit of the nrao green bank telescope for m 31 and that of the arecibo 300 meter dish for another spiral galaxy m 33 at 900 kpc at 41 declination m 31 is out of reach from arecibo but like m 33 makes a good target for fast 31 we can go presently for example 29 determined that if the most luminous pulsar in the galaxy psr b 1302 64 were placed in m 31 it would need to be five times as luminous in order to be detected in a survey using the 12 25 meter antennae of the westerbork synthesis radio array since m 31 at 778 kpc is 64 35 times farther away than b 1302 is from the earth 12 kpc it can be inferred that b 1302 was robustly detected at 13 times 26 the threshold level of the survey however b 1302 is only the most luminous pulsar assuming that its flux obeys an inverse square law within the milky way with a 571 ms period and a pulse width 30 of 19 ms b 1302 is almost certainly near a 1 distance law and thus its luminosity is overestimated figure 14 plots what the 1400 mhz fluxes would be at the 778 kpc to m 31 for the 577 parkes multibeam pulsars whose pulse fwhm is less than 0 034 cycles so that b 1302 64 is included on this graph the flux of b 1302 at m 31 is only 25 jy lower than 21 other pulsars 32 with 310 1 8 mjy at 4 5 778 kpc the sharply pulsed 0 018 b 1641 45 is the clear winner at m 31 the bulk of the population lies between 1 and 10 jy for the magellanic clouds themselves the 59 7 kpc distant small cloud has four known pulsars with pulse widths of 0 0300 0 0216 0 0189 and 0 0138 cycles while the 49 7 kpc distant large cloud has 12 with two young strongly magnetized pulsars at 62 x rays only so far and 20 hz both of which were discovered in the x ray band it also has 10 more exclusively radio pulsars with pulse widths of 0 0818 0 0326 and 0 0246 cycles and the remaining seven with still narrower peaks like the smc a narrower sample than the the full pksmb lending support to the pulsar model under discussion 2 33 the 20 hz pulsar in the lmc b 0540 69 3 has a double peak spanning one third of a cycle see the middle pulse profile in fig 1 characteristic of a viewpoint which is more equatorial than optimum 4 the shock s of the chandra image of this pulsar appear as a straight line 34 35 consistent with our view being extremely close to equatorial again lending support to the supraluminal excitation model of pulsar emission the 62 hz pulsar in the lmc j 0537 6910 36 has a marginally narrow pulse 0 1 cycles which appears to be a close double thus our view is farther from the equatorial than it is for b 0540 and closer to optimum its nearly aligned magnetic field is drifting toward its spin equator by about a meter per year but the field strength rather than effective dipole is what matters for cyclotron radiation in the case of j 0537 its field is still strong enough at its close in light cylinder to produce x rays but few optical photons because the cyclotron process can not produce subharmonics still another test that the model passes and few others do similar strongly magnetized pulsars such as that in the crab nebula 30 hz may drive winds which move material through positions of favored supraluminal excitations relative to an observer the chandra image of the shocks near the crab pulsar 25 35 show an ellipticity 27 consistent with our view being 29 off the rotational plane an orientation which would produce the weakest top pulse profile shown in fig 1 i e the interpulse the very sharp main pulse a 1 1 ms fwhm could be the result of emission from the wind where its material passes through the favored location at r 1 cos 29 1 143 the absence of the ghz emission bands seen in the interpulse is consistent with the less homogeneous environment from which this feature must arise finally the pulse profiles recorded for the periodic 2 14 ms signal 37 38 from sn 1987 a were rarely anywhere near as sharp as are at least half of all radio pulsars with the smallest pulse widths at no less than 10 thus it was difficult to reconcile this pulsation with a real source at 49 7 kpc with a violation of the inverse square law apparently ruled out the answer in this case is that an otherwise sharp pulse is broadened by the phase variation of the precession for which there is evidence in all of the results sufficiently significant to reveal it b supernova disruption the 1 distance law is essential to pulsar driven supernova disruption the progenitor star radii are in the range of 1 40 000 light periods 2 rlc c whether white dwarf white dwarf or blue supergiant core merger 500 hz pulsars or solitary red supergiant 50 hz pulsars see fig 15 annuli of polarization currents close to the poles as well as annuli at all but the smallest radii deeper from the poles all contribute to beams which are concentrated at the poles thus the jets driven from this radiation are polar emerge within minutes of core collapse and can be collimated to a high degree 11 easily one part in 10 000 see figs 15 and 16 and still more for larger stars making this one of the most anisotropic known processes in the universe the advantage in 1 r 3 dipole strength for the near axially induced smaller radius r more equatorially erupting beams over the less axial larger r more polar beams is not as great as might be expected the contributions to the latter grow larger with r are boosted by a centripetal acceleration which also grows with r and are focused onto the smaller polar rather than the larger equatorial regions in the end the excitations beams to both regions must propagate out of the stellar core and at least the rest of the stellar radius with the 28 fig 15 the emergence locations x y near the northern rotational pole for the 2 655 focused beams which fall within the x 3 5 y 3 5 radians of the frame out of 3 930 annuli of po larization currents within a post core collapse star of 400 000 radians diameter a 19 08 million km radius for a 500 hz pulsar and a 190 8 million km radius for a 50 hz pulsar the annuli are spaced in polar depth and radius by about 1 000 radians phase lag has been accounted for making the azimuthal locations for the emergences essentially random the o symbols mark the emergences from annuli in the stellar northern hemisphere and x symbols for those from annuli in its southern hemisphere paths from the annuli of greater radii avoiding more and more of the stellar core as they penetrate to the poles thus a plot of the number of beam emergences vs colatitude upper frame of fig 16 may be a decent measure of anisotropy although no adjustment has been made for the differing stellar densities at the locations of the polarization currents however pulsar precession 29 fig 16 lower frame left hand vertical scale the percentage of 3 930 cusp emergences red histogrammed in steps of 0 1 radians projected polar radius lower frame right hand vertical scale the cumulative fraction of emergences cyan vs projected polar radius upper frame left hand vertical scale the log of the number of cusp emergences at all azimuths per degree of colatitude upper horizontal scale the highest resolution of 0 01 degrees corresponds to 35 radians in the horizontal scale of the lower frame 37 and 38 limits the effective anisotropy to about a factor of 100 arguably even less than the collimation r 210 implied by bright spot 2 of 39 which was roughly the same physical size but much more distant from sn 1987 a for stars with circumstellar material a meandering pencil beam cuts through this gas producing copious amounts of radiation 30 along the way the amount of radiation produced may be comparable to that which emerges from the poles this is not unexpected considering the sn 1987 a mystery spot or bright spot 1 a feature observed on days 30 and 38 by 40 and day 50 by 41 to be consistent in magnitude 6 of the optical flux of the sn proper position angle 194 and with a reasonable extrapolation offset 45 60 and 74 milli arc seconds or a few light weeks south by southeast of the sn proper and its anisotropy 42 visible in the remnant now for the last few decades for large stars either the core merger process within the common envelope 43 or the reduction of the core s moment of inertia through progressive nucleosynthesis initiates 44 this anisotropy even before core collapse early spectra of sn 1987 a indicate bright sources underlying diffuse material not unlike glowing pyrotechnic embers viewed through intervening smoke much but certainly not all of this underlying luminosity must come from the visible south pole the rest must originate from the effect of the polar jets penetrating their overlaying circumstellar material which given the 9 day delay fig 3 of 11 and the 75 orientation indicates such material at locations light weeks above the poles following a small 1 day increase at day 7 8 due to the uv flash hitting but not penetrat ing deeply into the circumstellar material the luminosity from the jet penetration continues to ramp up beyond day 9 following an additional small spike at day 20 most prominently in u r and i when what remains of the uv flash breaks out into a relative clearing a decrement occurs over days 20 to 21 when the particle jet enters the same clearing the lu minosity then continues to ramp up after after this one day delay with almost the same slope more supra polar material figure 3 of 11 shows that by day 25 this luminosity ramp was only a magnitude fainter than the minimum of mv 4 5 at day 6 8 since the ramp back extrapolates 11 to the same value at day 7 8 as the minimum at day 6 8 it appears that the stellar luminosity is not rapidly increasing at that time due for example to production of 56 ni nor would it also be expected to increase due to the disruption mechanism acting on the south pole since precession will dominate any tiny changes expected in the beam jet collimation with time thus as much as 28 of the total sn 1987 a luminosity at day 25 was due to polar jets s beams s interacting with circumstellar material light weeks away from the star the luminosity continues to rise progressively more slowly to a peak and turns over after 31 day 86 45 when much of the circumpolar material has been driven away so that less of this was engaged by the jet s by this time the v flux had increased by a factor of 5 4 so although the mystery spot at days 30 38 and 50 amounts to only 8 of the total light in h it may be that diffuse or out of band h luminosity from the jet polar circumstellar material is still greater not until day 120 when the slope break occurs indicating 56 co decay can we be sure that the luminosity of the star proper totally dominates the early details did not show up in the b band because the flux was still falling from the uv flash until day 20 but after that follows the v curve closely this means that much of the luminosity near the peak of the sn 1987 a light curve was due to the jet s penetrating the circumstellar material a flux whose intensity and its time of maximum will both vary with the angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight to the earth the circumstellar material expelled by sne ia progenitors will differ slower than the 0 957 c of that in sn 1987 a and perhaps with less of an initial gap mean depth than 1 5 2 5 light weeks but given that these are also merging binaries as was sn 1987 a that material will still be out there as polarization measurements confirm 46 even though the rate of 56 ni production will be greater in general the light curves peak earlier so the interaction flux will still be an important fraction of the total and may actually equal or exceed the relative fraction in sn 1987 a because of the higher atomic numbers of c and o thus using these objects as standard candles is likely to be an exercise in futility unless we can observe the early development as proposed in 43 in many such nearby sne and somehow find observables still measurable in the distant sample that can unravel all the key parameters vii distance effects in pulsars grbs and agn jets for isolated pulsars from earlier emission occurs just outside of the light cylinder at r 1 cos 4 1 00244 thus the scale of decrease of is 0 0048 and its scale of decline for a 1 hz pulsar with a 47 700 km rlc is 232 km the spin rates of the 14 exclusively radio pulsars in the magellanic clouds range from 0 55 to 4 1 hz the implication of such pulsars in the lmc and smc at 50 and 60 kpc which the 1 distance law would place between 3 2 to 20 4 jy at the distance to m 31 and not that far from the middle of the distribution shown in fig 14 is that the scaling with is still unrestricted by limit over a factor of 32 6 6 1015 in distance for gamma ray burst afterglows r 100 000 times rlc amounts to 107 km for blue supergiants and 108 km for red supergiants but maybe only r 100 or 104 km for mergers of two white dwarfs a possible source of short gamma ray bursts and their afterglows to see grb afterglows from these processes at 4 gpc the scaling with must hold up for a factor of 1 3 1015 for red giants ten times that for blue supergiants and 10 million times that for white dwarf mergers see fig 17 fig 17 left vertical scale the log of the angle from fig 3 as a function of the log distance bottom horizontal scales and the log of the angle right vertical scale representing the upper limit for 1 10 and 100 hz isolated pulsars and disruption of red 50 hz or blue 500 hz supergiants whose cores have collapsed to neutron stars 33 assuming grb afterglows are pulsars because of their long persistence and apparent 1 distance law it is not unreasonable to think that scaling with will hold to another factor of 10 in distance from 55 kpc to the 778 kpc of m 31 and the 898 kpc to m 33 and that pulsars will be detected in these even if the sampling in time is not fine enough to exploit any pulse narrowing see three paragraphs below another conclusion which can be drawn from all this is that can be immeasurably small figure 17 shows the values for 1 10 and 100 hz isolated pulsars and the red and blue supergiants which produce grbs and afterglows from their supernovae from fig 17 and some work with a straightedge we can see that the limiting pulse width of a 1 hz pulsar at 100 pc is 10 20 radians or 1 6 10 21 s this rate is consistent with 1 ns after 4 900 km and 20 ns at one characteristic distance for the decrease of 232 km when the coherent range does reach limit and then the distance increases by some factor decreasing by the same factor the range of phases which fall below the limiting 3 6 curve falls by a factor of from our discussion near the end of section iii we learned that the more limited source phase range has made the resulting pulse a factor of narrower which represents more energy by the same factor because of the increased bandwidth of the fourier components of the narrower pulse and sensible detection algorithms can exploit this so even here the effective distance law is still better than inverse square while for less distant sources every factor increase in distance causes that much more source within the same small time range thus the 1 distance law applies an interesting possibility is the observation of crab like optical pulsars at great distances calculating rlc r 1 r for a 25 hz pulsar which produces a sharp pulse by pushing material through a typical observer inclination determined r of 2 3 1 155 or 60 30 off the rotational plane gives a scaling length for of 551 km it takes 5 6 1010 of these to make just one parsec thus is 30 5 6 1010 9 3 10 12 radians and 7 10 17 radians or a whopping 1 3 a at rlc or 4 3 10 19 s at this point quantum effects may take over for all emission wavelengths longer than very soft x rays including the radio through the ultraviolet if a rotating magnetized body can drag its magnetic field supraluminally across plasma so can an orbiting magnetized body near a the supermassive black hole in an agn and certainly any orbiting binary system the focused radiation which first moves in the z 34 direction recall that z r 2 1 x 2 1 1 r 2 for x 1 1 r 2 a small value starts completely vertically is ideal for forming jets perpendicular to the orbital plane thin accretion disk such jets will not be nearly as highly collimated as pulsar driven jets but the observational constraints only demand 1 part in 100 collimation and the occasional magnetic field line advected into the jet from material in the accretion disk since magnetic field lines can not thread into uncharged black holes they must somehow adjust when two of them are co orbiting prior to merging in a manner that ordinary matter can not mimic thus it is possible that this situation will also result magnetic fields moving supraluminally across matter whose excitations may drive strong jets perpendicular to any surrounding large accretion disks this process may have caused the strong jets visible near m 87 and within the seyfert 2 galaxies in ngc 5128 centaurus a and cygnus a clusters and hercules a at the same time an extragalactic black hole acquisition within m 87 and centaurus cygnus and hercules a would also have taken any objects which previously had been quietly orbiting either black hole and scattered them to the four winds there is also the systematic difference in the velocities of the nearby companion star populations left over from the merger of two host galaxies containing the black holes as well as the kinetic energy deposited by either black hole due to dynamical friction all of these effects would result in a mass estimate exaggerated by a factor of thousands it is possible that all such estimates for black holes in the billions of solar masses have been the result of companion black hole acquisition the strong linear relation 47 between host galaxy mass and the misattributed virial black hole mass follows trivially thus there is no longer any problem of the time needed to form such massive objects simply because they are not that massive at best in the few tens of millions of solar masses easily possible to build from globular cluster black holes of a few million solar masses each the recent 48 49 image of the black hole in m 87 is likely to be a large region between the two orbiting black holes 336 au diameter for 20 arc s in m 87 that has been cleared of stars and luminous material by the periodic gravitational disturbance rather than any event horizon large enough to be resolved 35 viii other supraluminal excitations grbs and redshifts many if not all transient events in the distant universe including outbursts of agns and qsos on timescales of days to months generally accepted as black hole driven to fast radio bursts on timescales of milliseconds are likely a result of one type of supraluminal excitation or another and violate the inverse square law in certain directions relieving the need for the extreme amounts of associated energy gamma ray bursts which last up to 100 seconds may result from supernova core collapse and a linearly accelerated supraluminal excitation the vcc s on the path become increasingly open intersecting with previous vcc s and generating focused beams in a ring around the direction of motion this occurs in a volume of circumstellar gas a dozen light days distant d and is due to a beam collimated to about half a degree or so producing a delay range of d 2 2 50 s 50 however the afterglows of gamma ray bursts many of which can last for hours could consist at least partially and at some time when there is plasma at the right radius pulsar emission 11 since about half of all swift gamma ray bursts are known to have afterglows then at least half of grb progenitors leave pulsars behind and at most half are black hole producing events of those events which produce pulsars the ones due to core merger supernovae could possibly be used to derive the redshift as 500 hz may be a standard candle in initial spin frequency for such objects because there is always too much orbital angular momentum in the merger process so the spin rate is set by the branching of the maclaurin and jacoby solutions 51 the optical signature of the neutron star neutron star ns ns merger in ngc 4993 gw 170817 was still detectable four days after the event though several magnitudes fainter more likely indicating an outburst of some sort see e g 52 and references therein it may be possible that the rapid rotation involved in ns ns mergers along with a remnant magnetic field produce supraluminal excitations which may drive much of the observed outburst phenomena gravitational supraluminal excitations of matter dense enough to in turn radiate strong focused gravitational waves might be possible in ns ns and even black hole ns mergers 36 ix general discussion a pulsars we have presented evidence that at lesat half of all parkes radio pulsars have been discovered because we are close to a favored orientation nearly perpendicular to the rotation axes where their radiated power diminishes only as the first power of distance and have calculated the onset of this effect in one instance confirming a long predicted effect 1 4 observationally the effect holds for these pulsars at distances up to 10 kpc given the limited time resolution of almost all radio data this can not be due to just the same energy concentrated into narrower and narrower pulses instead out to some range of distances more energy is concentrated into the same pulse width interestingly the strongest optical pulsations from sn 1987 a observed during 1993 6 feb 53 and 27 aug at the 49 7 kpc distance to the lmc amounted 37 38 to a full 16 magnitude 20 5 of the mv 18 5 central star which persisted from about 1992 1995 such pulsations correspond to an azimuth range of 60 if this central source is entirely due to the pulsar and more if only partly so this implies not coincidentally that the pulsar was as bright as it could get during the two observations lending further support to the pulsar model discussed in this work but not for strongly magnetized pulsars such as the crab b supernovae the effects of focused beams resulting from supraluminal excitations are still generally unappreciated by the scientific community accounting for these in the early stages of supernova disruption yields results that are highly anisotropic but which are limited in collimation to 100 to 1 at best due to pulsar precession 37 38 and further limited because supraluminally induced polarization currents though dominant producing 0 62 1051 ergs 0 62 foe from a 500 467 5 hz spin rate drop is not the only disruption mechanism there is also the production of 56 ni and its decay through positron emission to 56 co in addition to the more obvious effects of anisotropy we have from 11 and consider ations of this in section vi b a considerable fraction of the maximum apparent luminos ity of sne is due to polar jets propagating through and at the same time bunching up circumstellar polar ejected material this material is about a light week and a half distant 37 though closer and possibly brighter for c o stars due to the high atomic numbers in the jets and target material this time varying contribution to the apparent luminosity depends on and is variably delayed due to the orientation angle of the pulsar rotational axis it has also already been a decade and a half since critical observations were made of local sne ia which were clearly below the width luminosity relation by nearly an order of magnitude 54 with none lying above it and more than a dozen years since observers gave up on using them in that way 55 correcting just a few such objects in a distant sample could easily wipe out the 28 effect in luminosity go on to overwhelm any reasonable correction for malmquist bias the last best hope that less luminous distant sne were due to a real effect and still provide enough excess luminosity to imply a gravitationally induced deceleration in the universe for m 0 99 the reality might be worse with many more sne ia lying under the width luminosity relation by a lesser degree in the end this is a textbook example of systematic biases in the measurement in this case of supernova luminosity the initial local sample of sne ia from 56 was determined by serendipity only the very bright ones detected one way or another were available then the automated searches came online and those in the distant sample were anomalously dim it took almost another decade to augment the local sample and some of these were drastically dimmer than would be expected on the basis of the width luminosity relation thus it is clear that were they not so luminous sne would be the last objects in the universe anyone would want to use as standard candles but they are that luminous and fortunately the very circumstellar material that complicates their use as standard candles may allow observation of many more relatively nearby sne from before their instant of core collapse bright source 2 in sn 1987 a was very likely 43 due to material ejected from the poles some months prior to core collapse and was bright enough to detect in progenitors out to a few mpc and so these can serve as predictors of core collapse a thorough study of a few relatively nearby sne ia just might lead to telltale details in these that can also be measured in distant sne which can be used to determine the rotational orientation as well as the physical properties of the circumstellar material and the kinematics of the jets so in the end after some hard work sne ia might actually be usable as standard candles but for now the so called standard model of cosmology with m 0 04 dm 0 24 38 and de 0 72 has no particular advantage over any other dogma given its discrediting by both observation 15 years ago and now calculation and should be avoided also because of the baggage of dark energy and dark matter that comes with it indeed there is no firm evidence for either other than effects due to non viriality and or viriality attributed to the wrong mass for the latter there is also the problem of early star formation for low fractions of m which can be alleviated in bounce models with high m along with the problems of light elements surviving the associated nucleosynthesis and uniformity at the same time without invoking inflation more baggage the early formation of clusters and their high kinetics can be explained by pulsar driven jets 11 still students are being led down a primrose path of bad science exploiting sne for cosmology 57 without first understanding 58 them ignorance of the implications of sn 1987 a as advanced in 11 and 59 years before and prejudice some favoring a radical cosmology with a fervor that would shame the most zealous religious fanatic by now a second or third generation of mentors in part perhaps due to the persistence of supporting grants which should be replaced by others which are much more generic in nature misunderstanding the nature of core collapse sne by everyone particularly by those ex perts on the spectra and light curves of sne consulted to render judgement on an individual sn ia which did not fit the pattern of anomalously dim ia s to disqualify an offending candidate is not the best way to produce objective science this may be the reason why the distribution of luminosities of qualified sne ia is not consistent with any known cosmology 60 the issue of thermonuclear sne ia was raised nearly a half century ago 61 and persists even today however wolf rayet stars with merging cores massing 1 4 m or more as happened within sk 69 202 will undergo core collapse and become sn ia s themselves thereby ruining the sample no matter if thermonuclear sn ia s should they exist can by themselves be used as standard candles c the sun closer to home it may be possible that the 5 minute oscillations in the sun 62 also spo radically mimic a circularly supraluminal excitation the circumference of the sun is 14 7 light sec so supraluminal excitations are possible for any harmonic number above 20 in these p waves which in an already magnetized body have an electromagnetic consequence 39 harmonics exist well above 60 which would imply r values at 3 or above the more inter mediate harmonics may put the initial focus close to or just underneath the solar surface possibly causing flares and or coronal mass ejections and possibly even 63 superflares the highest harmonics can not dominate or many of the flares and ejections would be po lar whether the existence of such excitations will effect our estimates of tc its 15 million k core temperature remains to be determined but if it does the result may cast doubt on the existence of neutrino masses flavor oscillations d hercules x 1 parts of the twisted tilted accretion disk around this 1 24 s x ray pulsar will be illumi nated by the pulsed x ray flux thus producing supraluminal excitations which may have resulted in very high energy pulsed radiation 64 67 observed in 1986 and upshifted in pulsed frequency by some 0 16 three times the maximum gain of the pulsar from doppler shift detailed discussion of this is too long to include here e other effects the mechanism of focused radiation may also be important to gamma ray bursts and their afterglows agn jets neutron star mergers and most if not all other transient events in the distant universe but to actually calculate these things to the end of the universe a greater range of precision in computation 256 bits will be necessary until that time no calculation of supernovae or any other large object involving supraluminal excitations and their resulting focused beams will be possible a few more orders of magnitude may be achieved for the supernova problem by iterating to find the minimum slope of the observer time as an indicator rather than fine raster source times and histogramming the resulting observer times as plotted in fig 11 though this latter is visually more dramatic the search for effects of physics beyond the standard model continues but it is clear that the effects of supraluminal excitations are real but were never considered until very recently responsible for many effects in the distant universe and should themselves be considered as additions to the standard model of physics 40 x conclusion focused beams produced by supraluminally undpated polarization currents driven by the neutron star pulsar remnant are the dominant disruption mechanism for most if not all supernovae about a decade down the road this back to back dual particle accelerator runs through all of the stellar material nearly all progenitor stars are large enough so that the beam emergences cluster around the rotational poles producing polar jets the jets will crash into material ejected previously by the same mechanism acting through the increasing stellar core rotation rate producing a significant contribution to the total sn luminosity which varies strongly with rotational orientation the timing of this contribution also varies by several days again according to the rotational orientation to the observer they will not be useful as standard candles anytime soon but there is some hope that sne can be understood in sufficient detail 43 to change this until then they provide no constraint on cosmological constants because the mechanism discussed here dominates the disruption of sne all previous calculations which successfully disrupted progenitors without accounting for it are now em barrassingly incorrect and will have to be modified to accommodate this new understanding of reality in addition nearly all solitary progenitor stars spend their lives burning to heavier and heavier elements in their cores and in consequence the moments of inertia of their mag netized cores will also fall and their rotation will speed up during their lifespans thus the same mechanism that later disrupts sn progenitors will cause material ejection in all sufficiently large stars before core collapse if that happens it will also disrupt would be direct collapse stars long before they achieve masses anywhere close to a billion solar since there is no way to produce billion solar mass black holes in the lifetime of the universe galaxies with jets and black holes thought to weigh in the billions of solar such as m 87 and centaurus cygnus and hercules a are likely the result of binary few million solar mass black holes the result of mergers and capture by dynamical friction else where are the few million solar mass black hole binaries and how would they appear agn jets likely do not originate directly from their black holes but rather from supra luminal excitations in the surrounding disk material in turn produced by magnetic fields moving supraluminally due to orbiting magnetic bodies and or time varying gravitational 41 fields from most likely two orbiting black holes with masses in the millions of solar in order to calculate these effects well to the ends of the universe computers will have to be much more precise possibly using as many as 256
