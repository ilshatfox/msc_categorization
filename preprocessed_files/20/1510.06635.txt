institute of computer science cze stochowa university of technology al armii krajowej 17 42 200 cze stochowa poland recently introduced model of magnetic hysteresis was extended into set of the following features frequency pick of induction and temperature of specimen group theoretical classification of hys teresis loops sets is presented an effect analogous to the zeeman splitting has been revealed in the set of the all hysteresis loops i introduction recently new mathematical model of hysteresis loop has been derived 1 this model consists in extantion of tanh by extanding the base of exp function into an arbitrary positive number tanh a b c d x ax b x cx d x 1 where a b c d are arbitrary positive numbers in this paper we consider only a symmetric model a b c d which lead to the following forms for the apper and and the lower sections of hysteresis loop as well as for the initial magnetization curve mf x m 0 f x mg x m 0 g x 2 where f x ax b x cx d x 3 g x ax b x cx d x 4 is a model parameter depending on xmax mp x m 0 p x x 0 xmax 5 where m 0 is magnetization corresponding to saturation expressed in tesla t x 0 xmax x h h where h is magnetic field h is a parameter of the magnetic field dimension a m 1 to be determined xmax is determined by an uncertainity relation 1 p x function is of the following form p x ax b x cx d x 6 where is modeling parameter of the order 2 in the presented paper we extend this approach into dependence of magnetization on the frequency f and the induction s pick bm of periodic exciting wave as well as the temperature t of specimens the f dependence of hysteresis loop has been derived by jiles in 2 his model provides a relatively simple way of predicting changes in the hysteresis curves as a result of eddy currents at different frequencies however this model requires solutions of ordinary differential equation in our approach we apply phenomenological model of the hysteresis loop possessing the free parameter a which will be widen to a positively determined function of f recently relevant progress has been achieved in subject of temperature dependence of the hysteresis loop 3 the presented model consists mainly of a preisach operator with a continuous preisach weight function which is written down as a function of temperature very often an investigator or a designer of magnetic materials is interested in dependence of hysteresis on the three parameters f bm t together therefore we assume that the base a is a positive determined function of the three variables a a f bm t crucial role in the solution of the mentioned above problems will play scaling 4 5 6 the reasons for creation such phenomenological models are automated design and the convenience as well as computational efficiency 7 http arxiv org abs 1510 06635 v 1 2 ii widening of hysteresis loop scaling on f bm and t parameter space scaling of magnetization hysteresis loop introduced in 1 represents a relation between the two loops let the upper section of hysteresis loop and the lower one are of the forms given by 2 3 and 4 respectively let us consider symmetric case defined by a b c d then the considered loop model is invariant both with respect to scaling and gauge transformation represented by and parameters respectively the complete transformation has to be performed for the both sections of the hysteresis loop 1 let us assume that there exist real numbers r 2 such that r and r the following relations hold mf x m 0 a x a a x a a x a a x a mg x m 0 a x a a x a a x a a x a 7 let us assume ap 1 then the relations 7 after simple evaluations take the following form mf x m 0 an a p x a p x a p x a p x mg x m 0 an a p x a p x a p x a p x 8 where n p 1 and p r 0 now we are ready to introduce f bm and t as independent variables of the considered model let us assume that the base a is a function of these independent variables a a f bm t 9 which satisfy assumptions for the homogeneous function in general sense let there exist r 4 such that r the following relation holds a f bm t a f bm t 10 basing on experience of many researches in applying the scaling we assume that the following substitution for b 1 m 11 then the expression for a f bm t after simple evaluations takes the following form a f bm t b m b b m f b m t 12 where b is an arbitrary function of the two variables 13 all parameters in 8 n m 0 p and ones in 12 b and must be determined from an experimental data by introducing new transformstion represented by we have extent the symmetry group of the loops space to the three parameters one g g g g 14 ii 1 modeling of b function in this subsection we present an example model of the b b m f b m t function applying the idea presented in 6 we factorize the considered function in the following way b b m f b m t f b m f b m t 15 3 where f and have to be model for f we select a power series whereas for the pade approximant has been chosen 8 f f b m 0 1 f b m k f b m k 16 basing on some computer experiments we have selected for the following pade approximant 8 0 1 2 1 3 4 1 z 17 where t b m and t is measured temperature in c and z are tuning parameters i are pade expansion coefficients iii conclusions in this paper we have widen the simple model of magnetic hysteresis on the set of the following features frequency pick of induction and temperature dependence by generalization of the base a to the homogenous function of the three variables we considered the two cases first we have opened new possibility for description of influence of frequency and temperature on the hysteresis phenomena however this achievement is conditional we have assumed that a f bm t is a homogeneous function in general sense but this need not to be so however if in an individual case one prove by using experimental data that a f bm t is a homogenous function 5 then the scaling 10 holds and this can be applied in modeling in the second case we considered a const as we have shown in the case each value of a 0 constitutes orbit in g defined by semi direct product of multiplicative and additive subgroups g and g respectively each element of g relates the two loops this relation is equivalence one and introduces division of the loops space however if an extension of a to a function a f bm t obeys the scaling then each two bases can be related by an element of g therefore in this case all loops are equivalent and all of them constitute one orbit decreasing symmetry from g to g we reveal splitting of the one lops set into infinite number of subsets 1 k z
