geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups michael mihalik and steve tschantz abstract if is the cayley graph of a gromov hyperbolic group then it is a fundamental fact that quasi geodesics in are tracked by geodesics let w s be a finitely generated coxeter system and w s the cayley graph of w s for general coxeter groups not all quasi geodesic rays in are tracked by geodesics in this paper we clas sify the quasi geodesic rays that are tracked by geodesics as corol laries we show that if w acts geometrically on a cat 0 space x then cat 0 geodesics in x are tracked by cayley graph geodesics where the cayley graph is equivariantly placed in x and for any a s the special subgroup a is quasi convex in x we also show that if g is an element of infinite order for w s then the subgroup g is tracked by a cayley geodesic in w s in analogy with the corresponding result for word hyperbolic groups 1 introduction suppose g is a group with finite generating set a and g a is the cayley graph of g with respect to a if g is word hyperbolic then any quasi geodesic in is tracked by a geodesic see sh the corresponding result for cat 0 groups is not true our main goal in this paper is to classify the quasi geodesics in the cayley graph of a finitely generated coxeter system that are tracked by geodesics we define a bracket number for a cayley path in terms of the wall crossings of the path and our main theorem is that a quasi geodesic ray or line is tracked by a geodesic iff the bracket number of the ray line is bounded our principal corollary to this theorem states that if w s is a finitely generated coxeter system and w acts geometrically on a cat 0 space x then the cat 0 geodesics of x are tracked by w s cayley geodesics in x if x is the davis complex for w s or even if w acts as a reflection group on x the proof of the corollary is straightforward unfortunately the reflection group argument has no analogue when w does not act as a reflection group on x the principal corollary directly implies that if a s then the special subgroup a is quasi convex in x if a group g acts geometrically on a cat 0 space x and one is inter ested in the asymptotic properties of x it is a considerable advantage to know that cat 0 geodesics in x are tracked by cayley geodesics clearly date october 30 2018 key words and phrases cat 0 group coxeter group quasi geodesic 1 ar x

highlighted in mrt where local connectivity of boundaries of right angled coxeter groups are analyzed the work of b bowditch and g swarup see s imply that 1 ended word hyperbolic groups have locally connected boundary one can easily see from our tracking results that any 1 ended hyperbolic coxeter group has locally connected boundary 2 coxeter preliminaries we use m davis book d as a general coxeter group reference for this section a coxeter system is a pair w s where s is a generating set for the group w and w has presentation s sisj m i j for all si sj s where m i j 1 2 m i j 1 iff i j so all generators are order 2 and m i j m j i if m i j the element sisj is of infinite order and the relation sisj is left out of the presentation a reflection in w is a conjugate of an element of s if w w and s s then the edge labeled s in the cayley graph w s at the vertex w is mapped to itself by the reflection wsw 1 so that the vertices w and ws are interchanged i e the edge is reflected across its midpoint the set of edges in each fixed set wise by a reflection is a wall of the walls of partition the edges of into disjoint sets notationally we write a wall q as e where e is any edge of the wall q and we define q to be the union of the edges of q in an edge e with say label t s belongs to a wall q corresponding to the reflection wsw 1 iff a vertex of e is wq where qtq 1 s the closure of the compliment of a wall in has exactly two components which are interchanged by the reflection called the sides of the wall two walls are parallel if all edges of one are on the same side of the other if two walls are not parallel then they cross the following theorem due to b brink and r howlett see theorem 2 8 of brh is a fundamental result concerning the wall structure of theorem 2 1 parallel wall theorem suppose w s is a finitely gen erated coxeter system and w s the cayley graph of w with respect to s for each positive integer n there is a constant p n such that the following holds given a wall q and a point p in such that the distance from p to q is at least p n then there exist n distinct pairwise parallel walls which separate q from p for a path in and vertex t of let the bracket number of t in be the number of walls q such that there is an edge of q on either side of t in denote the bracket number of t in as b t if is a subpath of the bracket number of in is the maximum of the numbers b t for all vertices t of denote this number b call b b the bracket number of geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 3 3 wall computations if is an edge path in the cayley graph with consecutive vertices a v 0 v 1 vn b then an l approximation to is an edge path in connecting a and b of the form 1 n where for all i i is geodesic connecting wi 1 to wi and wi is within l of vi the points wi are called approximation points lemma 3 1 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system is an edge path in the cayley graph w s connecting a and b and is an l approximation of then the bracket number b is bounded by a constant only depending on b l and constants independent of the choice of proof let the consecutive vertices of be a v 0 v 1 vn b the ap proximation vertices of be a w 0 w 1 wm b so that d wi vi l for all i and i be the geodesic subpath of connecting wi 1 to wi then 1 m if x is a vertex of i and b x is large then as each edge belongs to exactly one wall there is a wall q that brackets x on that is far from x and hence far from vi hence it suffices to bound the distance between vi and a wall q that brackets x on the parallel wall theorem implies this distance is large iff there is a large set q of mutually parallel walls that separate q from vi so it suffices to bound the size of the set q of walls that separate q from x say j i k such that ej and ek are edges of j and k respectively and each of ej ek belongs to the wall q see figure 1 a b vj 1 vj wj 1 wj vi 1 vi wi 1 wi vk 1 vk wk 1 wk j i k ej ekx figure 1 a path j that begins at the end point of ej follows j to wj and then travels geodesically from wj to vj has length 3 l if j i is the subpath of from vj to vi then the path j j i must cross each wall of q similarly define a path from ek to vi which also crosses each wall of q then at most 6 l walls of q do not bracket vi on this bounds the size of q by 6 l b lemma 3 2 suppose w s is a coxeter system and e 1 en is a geodesic edge path connecting vertices a and b in w s such that does not cross the wall q if e 0 is an edge at a and en 1 an edge at b such that e 0 and en 1 belong to the wall q then each vertex of is within p 1 of q where p is the function of theorem 2 1 in particular if v is a vertex of and v the reflection of v across q then d v v 2 p 1 1 4 michael mihalik and steve tschantz proof otherwise there is a wall q separating a vertex v of from q hence there is an edge of between a and v that belongs to q and an edge of between v and b that belongs to q this is impossible as is geodesic proposition 3 3 suppose w s is a coxeter system and is an edge path of w s connecting a and b then there is an l approximation to such that each vertex of is on a geodesic connecting a and b and such that l 2 p 1 1 b proof let the consecutive vertices of be a v 0 vn b for 0 i n we choose an approximation point wi for vi as follows let i be the geodesic from a to vi and i the geodesic from vi to b each wall of i i is crossed exactly once or twice the number of walls crossed twice by i i is ni 1 2 d a vi d vi b d a b b let e be the last edge of i belonging to a wall which is crossed twice by i i and d the edge of i in the same wall as e see figure 2 a b e d vi vi i i figure 2 the segment of i i between e and d is geodesic considering the reflection of this segment across the wall containing e and d equivalently delete e and d from i i then we see that v i the reflection of vi is within 2 p 1 1 of vi lemma 3 2 and the distance from v i to a respectively b is less than that of vi to a respectively b hence 1 2 d a v i d v i b d a b ni and a geodesic from a to v i followed by a geodesic from v i to b crosses at most ni 1 walls twice continuing as above at most ni b such reflections are needed to move vi to a point wi on a geodesic between a and b and so d wi vi 2 p 1 1 b it remains to see that each vertex of a geodesic connecting wi and wi 1 belongs to a geodesic connecting a and b consider the edge path i i i where i is a geodesic connecting a to wi i is a geodesic connecting wi to wi 1 and i is a geodesic connecting wi 1 to b the paths i and i only cross walls crossed by some equivalently any geodesic connecting a to b if a vertex v of i is not on a geodesic connecting a and b then there is a wall r separating v from some equivalently every geodesic connecting a and b as r separates v from a and i does not cross r i must cross r between geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 5 wi and v similarly i must cross r between v and wi 1 this is impossible as i is geodesic if is an edge path in connecting the vertices a and b then each wall separating a and b is crossed an odd number of times by and each wall not separating a and b is crossed and even number of times by if two edges of belong to the same wall then they may be deleted to obtain another path from a to b i e if edges e and d of belong to the same wall q and is the segment of between e and d then e d can be replaced in by where is the reflection of across q to obtain a shorter path connecting a and b if is a geodesic connecting a and b then the walls separating a and b are the walls determined by the edges of so the walls separating a and b are in 1 1 correspondence with the edges of some any geodesic connecting a and b the following observations are straightforward lemma 3 4 suppose is an edge path in connecting the vertices a and b such that each vertex of is on a geodesic connecting a and b then i each edge of belongs to a wall that separates a from b ii each wall crossed by is crossed an odd number of times and iii if c and d are vertices of then any wall separating c and d also separates a and b the next result is a slightly more sophisticated version of lemma 3 2 lemma 3 5 suppose is a geodesic edge path in connecting the vertices a and b v is a vertex of and a and b are each within distance a of q for some wall q then v is within distance 2 a 2 p 1 1 p 1 of q proof let a respectively b be a vertex of q within a of a respectively b and on the same side of q as is a respectively b let respectively be a geodesic from a to a respectively b to b case 1 the geodesic does not cross q in this case the path 0 does not cross q since a and a a sequence of at most 2 a deletions the first in the path 0 determines a geodesic connecting a to b which does not cross q each deletion is taken so that if e and d are the deleted edges then the subpath determined by e or d along with the subpath between e and d is geodesic if e 1 and d 1 are the first such deletion edges so e 1 and d 1 are edges of 0 then let 1 be obtained from 0 by deleting e 1 and d 1 if v is not between e 1 and d 1 then v is a vertex of 0 if v is between e 1 and d 1 then v 1 the reflection of v across the wall e 1 d 1 is within 2 p 1 1 of v by lemma 3 2 note that the hypotheses of lemma 3 2 are satisfied since we require condition in any case 1 contains a vertex v 1 within 2 p 1 1 of v if e 2 and d 2 are deleting edges of 1 satisfying then let 2 by obtained from 1 by deleting e 2 and d 2 lemma 3 2 implies 2 contains a vertex v 2 within 6 michael mihalik and steve tschantz 2 p 1 1 of v 1 and so within 2 2 p 1 1 of v inductively after k 2 a deletions we obtain a geodesic k connecting a and b and k contains a vertex vk within k 2 p 1 1 of v note that k does not cross q by lemma 3 2 vk is within p 1 of q so that v is within 2 a 2 p 1 1 p 1 of q this completes case 1 case 2 suppose crosses q say the edge e of between v and b belongs to q repeat the case 1 argument with 0 replaced by where is the subsegment of from a to the initial point of e similarly if e q is an edge of between a and v note that in both case 2 scenarios at most a deletions are required to straighten to a geodesic so the bound is reduced to a 2 p 1 1 p 1 4 tracking quasi geodesics we are interested in quasi geodesic edge paths in an edge path in is a continuous map 0 n such that n z and for each non negative integer k maps the interval k k 1 isometrically to an edge of similarly if 0 then is called a ray and if then is called a line an edge path is a quasi geodesic if for each pair of integers s and t s t d s t if and are edge paths then is k tracked by if each vertex of is within k of a vertex of lemma 4 1 for i 1 2 suppose i is a i i quasi geodesic edge path in 1 is k tracked by 2 and 1 0 is within k of 2 0 assume both 1 and 2 are bi infinite or both are rays or both are finite length and the terminal points of 1 and 2 are within k of one another then 2 is 2 2 k 1 2 k tracked by 1 proof since each vertex of 1 is within k of a vertex of 2 we may define an integer function a such that for each integer i in the domain of 1 1 i is within k of 2 a i we take a 0 0 and if i has ni edges then a n 1 n 2 the first two inequalities follow from the definitions and the third follows from the first two 1 a m i a m 2 2 2 k d 2 a m i 2 a m 2 k d 1 m i 1 m d 2 a m i 2 a m 2 k a m i a m 2 k 2 i 1 1 d 1 m i 1 m i 3 i 1 1 2 k a m i a m geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 7 2 d 1 m i 1 m 2 k 2 i 2 k 2 2 the inequality a i 1 a i 2 2 k 1 2 implies if k is between a i and a i 1 for some i then 2 k is within 2 2 k 1 2 k of 1 i in the case 1 and 2 are finite the condition that terminal points are within k of one another so that a n 1 n 2 implies that every integer in the domain of 2 is between a i and a i 1 for some i and this case is finished if 1 and 2 are rays then a i is non negative and equation 3 with m 0 implies a i is arbitrarily large for large i and again every integer in the domain of 2 is between a i and a i 1 for some i if 1 and 2 are bi infinite then the a i may be positive or negative and again by 3 for large i ai is large and limi a i and limi a i it remains to see limi a i 6 limi a i equality is impossible since otherwise for every large positive integer i a i would be between a j and a j 1 for some depending on i large positive integer j but equation 3 implies a j and a j 1 are relatively close and a i and a j are far apart proposition 4 2 suppose is a quasi geodesic edge path ray in and is tracked by a geodesic then has bounded bracket number proof assume that is a quasi geodesic suppose is a geodesic such that each vertex of is within l of a vertex of for each integer n 0 choose an integer a n such that d n a n l we assume that a 0 0 the next two equations follow from the definitions and the third follows from the first two a n 2 l d n 0 a n 2 l n d n 0 n n 2 l a n n 2 l claim 4 3 suppose k is an integer larger than 4 l 1 then for any integer n a n k a n proof note that if m n 4 l then a m n 2 l a n so if k 4 l 1 and a n k a n then there is a last integer k 1 4 l 1 such that a n k 1 a n then see figure 3 a n k 1 1 a n a n k 1 8 michael mihalik and steve tschantz ei di a ti 1 a n a ui v n figure 3 since d n k 1 n k 1 1 1 for all n and d i a i l for all i we have d a n k 1 a n k 1 1 2 l 1 but as a n is between a n k 1 and a n k 1 1 on the geodesic d a n a n k 1 1 2 l 1 then d n n k 1 1 4 l 1 but d n n k 1 1 1 k 1 1 4 l 1 the desired contradiction so the claim is proved now suppose v n is a vertex of with bracket number at least 2 4 l 1 2 k then by the pigeon hole principal there are k distinct walls q 1 qk such that for each i 1 k there is an edge ei of preceding v and an edge di of following v such that ei and di belong to the wall qi the subpath of between ei and di does not cross qi ei is not one of the 4 l 1 edges of immediately preceding v and di is not one of the 4 l 1 edges of immediately following v i e ei ti ti 1 where ti 1 n 4 l 1 and di ui ui 1 where ui n 4 l 1 see figure 4 geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 9 a n k a n a

x note that c is independent of vertex in hence k c 2 l 2 p 1 1 p 1 bounding the bracket number of a vertex of 5 proof of main theorem in order to prove the main theorem we need two results one due to b brink and r howlett brh and a second due to r p dilworth di theorem 5 1 brink howlett suppose w s is a finitely generated cox eter system and w s is the cayley graph of w with respect to s there is a bound f w s on the number of mutually crossing walls of dilworth s theorem requires several definitions if a is a partially ordered set a set with reflexive antisymmetric and transitive binary relation on a then any two elements x and y are comparable if either x y or y x otherwise they are in incomparable a subset c of a is a chain when every pair of points in c is a comparable pair a subset b of a is called an anitchain when every pair of points in b is an incomparable pair the number of points in a maximal antichain is called the width of a theorem 5 2 dilworth if a is a partially ordered set of width w then a can be partitioned into w chains suppose x and y are vertices of w s and w x y is the set of walls that separate x and y we partially order w x y by saying p q if either p q or p and q are parallel and p separates x from q note that p and q are parallel walls of w x y iff they are comparable hence p and q are incomparable iff they cross by proposition 5 1 the width of w x y is f w s applying dilworth s theorem we have 10 michael mihalik and steve tschantz proposition 5 3 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system and w s is the cayley graph of w with respect to s for any vertices x and y of the walls separating x and y can be partitioned into at most f w s chains where any two walls in the same chain are parallel say a path is geodesic with respect to a set of walls if the path crosses each wall of the set either 0 or 1 times the following lemma is clear lemma 5 4 suppose is an edge path in and is geodesic with respect to the set of parallel walls q if a subpath of is replaced by a geodesic edge path then the resulting edge path is geodesic with respect to q theorem 5 5 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system is a quasi geodesic edge path from a to b in the cayley graph w s then there is an integer k depending only on and the bracket number b of and a geodesic connecting a and b such that is k tracked by proof the proof is a double induction argument by proposition 5 3 the walls separating a and b can be partitioned into at most f sets q 1 qa where two walls in the same set are parallel the outside induction is on the number a f of sets of walls separating a and b the fact that a is bounded by f is critical to the argument that follows note that if a 1 then all walls separating a and b are parallel in this case the walls separating a and b are ordered as q 1 qm where for i j k qj separates qi from qk hence there is a unique geodesic edge path connecting a and b and crosses q 1 then q 2 by proposition 3 3 the path is approximated by a path such that each vertex of is on a geodesic connecting a and b the path only crosses the walls separating a and b see lemma 3 4 and in this case is geodesic modulo backtracking eliminating backtracking on produces each vertex of is a vertex of and the basis case is complete assume the statement of the theorem is true if a the number of sets of walls separating a and b is less than or equal to m 1 suppose there are m sets of walls q 1 qm separating a and b by proposition 3 3 we may assume every vertex of is on a geodesic connecting a and b so that only crosses walls separating a and b and crosses each such wall an odd number of times the second induction is on n m the number of sets of walls qi such that is not geodesic with respect to qi if n 0 then is geodesic assume the statement of the theorem is true for n k 1 when the number of sets of walls separating a and b is m assume the qi are arranged so that is geodesic with respect to qi for k 1 i m write as e 1 en with consecutive vertices a a 1 an b let i be the first integer such that ei is an edge of a wall of qk and for some j i ej and ei are in the same wall q now assume j is the largest integer such that ej q since crosses q an odd number of times the path i j ei ej 1 from ai to aj crosses q an even number of times a geodesic i j connecting ai to aj does not cross q since all walls of qk are geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 11 parallel to one another i j does not cross a wall of qk hence ai and aj are not separated by a wall of qk by proposition 3 3 i j is close to i j a quasi geodesic edge path connecting ai to aj such that each vertex of i j is on a geodesic connecting ai to aj by lemma 3 4 each wall separating ai and aj also separates a and b and the number of sets of walls separating ai and aj is less than m by outside induction there is a geodesic i j connecting ai and aj which tracks i j and therefore tracks i j replace i j by i j the resulting path 1 crosses q exactly once at ej the walls of qk are ordered as q 1 q 2 so that if i j then qi separates a from qj and qj separates qi from b a wall of qk preceding q in this ordering is not crossed by 1 after ej hence if q qk is the set of walls of qk preceding q and including q then 1 is geodesic with respect to q and by lemma 5 4 1 is geodesic with respect to each set qi for i k suppose ek is the first edge of 1 such that ek is an edge of a wall q of qk and for some l k el q then ek follows ej on 1 and if we assume el is the last edge of 1 in q then as above ek el 1 can be replaced by a geodesic close to ek el 1 continuing the resulting path is geodesic with respect to qk and by induction the theorem follows note that the bound f for on the number of sets of parallel walls are necessary to partition the set of walls separating two points a and b of limits the total number of times the induction steps are carried out to arrive at a geodesic 6 consequences of the main theorem corollary 6 1 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system and w s is the cayley graph of w with respect to s any infinite or bi infinite quasi geodesic edge path with bounded bracket number b is k tracked by an edge path geodesic where k is a constant only depending on b and s proof the proof is a standard local finiteness argument in both the infinite and bi infinite case we give the bi infinite case write as the edge path e 1 e 0 e 1 in let vi be the initial point of ei by theorem 5 5 there is a geodesic n which k tracks n e n en note that every vertex of n is within 2 k of a vertex of for each positive integer n some vertex xn of n is within k of v 0 hence there is an infinite number of xn that are equal of this infinite subcollection of xn infinitely many have the same pair of edges one preceding and one following xn on n of this infinite collection of xn there is an infinite subcollection that have the same four edges the two preceding and the two following xn being exactly the same continuing we have a bi infinite geodesic and each vertex of is within 2 k of a vertex of as is a quasi geodesic lemma 4 1 implies each point of is within 4 k 1 2 k of the next result follows directly from proposition 4 2 and corollary 6 1 12 michael mihalik and steve tschantz corollary 6 2 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system and w s is the cayley graph of w with respect to s then a quasi geodesic edge path ray in is tracked by a geodesic iff it has bounded bracket number a metric space x d is a called a geodesic metric space if every pair of points are joined by a geodesic it is proper if for any x x the ball of radius r about x is compact for all positive numbers r a group w acts geometrically on a space if the action is properly discontinuous co compact and by isometries let x d be a proper complete geodesic metric space if m abc is a geodesic triangle in x then we consider m abc in e 2 a triangle with the same side lengths and call this a comparison triangle then we say x satisfies the cat 0 inequality if given m abc in x then for any comparison triangle and any two points p q on m abc the corresponding points p q on the comparison triangle satisfy d p q d p q if x d is a cat 0 space then the following basic properties hold 1 the distance function d x x r is convex 2 x has unique geodesic segments between points 3 x is contractible for details see bh suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system w s is the cayley graph of w with respect to s and w acts geometrically on a cat 0 space x define x x to have as vertices the orbit wx and cat 0 geodesic edge connecting w 1 x and w 2 x for wi w when there is s s such that w 1 s w 2 there is a proper w equivariant map px x so that px maps the identity vertex of to x intuitively the next result says that when a coxeter group acts geomet rically on a cat 0 space cat 0 geodesics are tracked by cayley graph geodesics this result generalizes the right angled version of the same result in mrt corollary 6 3 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system and w s is the cayley graph of w with respect to s and w acts geometrically on the proper cat 0 space x if x is a point of x not fixed by any element of w and x is the copy of at x then any cat 0 geodesic ray in x is tracked by a cayley graph geodesic in x proof for a given cat 0 geodesic we find a cayley graph geodesic such that px tracks it suffices to find k and b such that any finite cat 0 geodesic is k tracked by a cayley quasi geodesic with bracket number b since w acts co compactly on x there is an integer k 1 such that every point of x is within k 1 of the orbit wx for each integer 0 1 n such that n is less that or equal to the length of choose a point vix of wx within k 1 of i let i be a geodesic geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 13 connecting vi to vi 1 and be the edge path 0 1 since the map px x is quasi isometric there are numbers and such that any such is a quasi geodesic in and numbers d and dx such that the length of any i is less than or equal to d in and every point of such a px i is within dx of i in x certainly every point of is within k k 1 1 of px i px v vk 1 xvj 1 x d e figure 5 hence it suffices to bound the bracket number of such a if v is a vertex of i and e and d are edges of preceding and following v respectively such that e and d belong to the same wall q of then e is an edge of j and d is an edge of k where j i k the mid points e of px e and d of px d are fixed in x and x by the reflection rq w for the wall q as are the mid points of e and d in hence the geodesic in x connecting d and e is fixed by rq now d respectively e is within dx of j 1 respectively k 1 and px v is within dx of i by the cat 0 inequality for quadrilaterals in particular for the quadrilateral determined by d e j 1 and k 1 i is within dx of a point of the x geodesic connecting d to e and hence i is within dx of a fixed point of rq see figure 5 since the action of w on x is properly discontinuous there is a bound b on the number of reflections rq such that rq does not take the ball of radius dx centered at v i x equivalently centered at any x x off of itself hence there cannot be more than b walls bracketing the vertex v of remark 6 4 note that the above proof is valid even when w does not act co compactly on the cat 0 space x as long as the cat 0 geodesic remains a bounded distance from x for some x the following result answers a question posed by k ruane corollary 6 5 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter group acting geometrically on the cat 0 space x for x x let x be the copy of the cayley graph of w s in x with w equivariant map px w s x then for each subset a s the subgroup a is quasi convex in x i e px a is quasi convex in x proof let k be the tracking constant from corollary 6 3 suppose a 1 a 2 a and is a cat 0 geodesic in x from px a 1 to px a 2 let be a x 14 michael mihalik and steve tschantz edge path geodesic which k tracks i e there is a w s geodesic from a 1 to a 2 such that px since ai a the edge labels of are all in a this means all vertices of are in a and so the image of is within k of px a the next result says that elements of infinite order in a coxeter group are tracked by geodesics in the standard cayley graph corollary 6 6 suppose w s is a finitely generated coxeter system and g w is an element of infinite order then in the cayley graph w s the elements g 2 g 1 1 g g 2 are tracked by a cayley graph geodesic proof by g moussong mo all finitely generated coxeter groups are cat 0 let x be any cat 0 space such that w acts geometrically on x the min set of g contains a geodesic line l that is invariant under the action of g let x be any point in x and x the copy of w s in x at x let be an s geodesic for g observe that the edge path line lg in x determined by positive and negative iterates of at x is a bounded distance from l the proof of corollary 6 3 shows that lg is a quasi geodesic with bounded bracket number and so by corollary 6 1 is tracked by a cayley graph geodesic one of the fundamental asymptotic results for word hyperbolic groups is that 1 ended word hyperbolic groups have locally connected boundary this result follows from a long program of results by several authors notably b bowditch and concluded by g swarup s to give a feeling for the reach of our results we outline an elementary proof of this fact for coxeter groups corollary 6 7 if w is a 1 ended word hyperbolic coxeter group then the boundary of w is locally connected proof we use an elementary form of a construction of a filter in mrt where a partial classification of right angled coxeter groups with locally connected boundaries is produced suppose w acts geometrically on the cat 0 space x with base point x let x be the copy of the cayley graph of w s at x in x with proper w equivariant map px w s x suppose r and s are close geodesic rays in x with r 0 s 0 x choose edge path geodesics r and s at the identity vertex of w s such that px r and px s k track r and s respectively since r and s are close in x we may assume that r and s have long initial segments with close terminal points for simplicity we assume these initial segments agree if y is the last vertex of this common initial segment say the edge of r following y has label a 1 and the edge of s following y has lablel b 1 the presentation diagram w s of w s has vertex set s and an edge labeled m i j between distinct vertices si sj if m i j 6 since w is 1 ended no subset a of s with a a finite group separates see corollary 16 of mt the set b of s elements that label edges at y with end points closer to than y is to generates a finite subgroup of w the set of vertices of corresponding to b does not separate and b does not geodesically tracking quasi geodesic paths for coxeter groups 15 contain a 1 or b 1 hence there is an edge path in from a 1 to b 1 avoiding b let the consecutive vertices of this path be a 1 v 1 v 2 vn b 1 if q i i 1 is the finite order of vivi 1 then the relation vi vi 1 q i i 1 determines a loop at y such that the two half loops at y making up this loop extend the cayley geodesic from to y consider the subgraph f 1 of determined by the edge paths r s and the edge loops for each vivi 1 each vi determines an edge of f 1 with label vi beginning at y at the end point of this edge there are two edges of f 1 that extend a cayley geodesic from to y build a set of loops as with a 1 and b 1 for each of these pairs of edges then f 2 is f 1 union all new loops continuing we build a 1 ended subgraph f i 1 fi of such that for each vertex v of f not on the common overlap of r and s there is a cayley geodesic from to v in f which passes through y we claim that l the limit set of px f is a small connected set containing r and s and so x is locally connected certainly r and s are in l since f is 1 ended and px is proper l is connected if v is a vertex of f then there is a cayley geodesic v from to v which passes through y for all but finitely many v if z l then let z 1 z 2 be a sequence of vertices of f such that px zi converges to z the cat 0 geodesic from x to px zi is k tracked by a cayley geodesic i in x as w is word hyperbolic the cayley geodesics px vi and i with the same end points must fellow travel for a fixed constant in particular each i must pass close to px y and so z is close to both r and s in x w references bh m r bridson a haefliger metric spaces of non positive curvature grundl math wiss vol 319 springer
