f h homeomorphims generating a faithful bs 1 n action on a closed surface s that is hfh 1 fn for some n 2 according to gl after replacing f by a suitable iterate if necessary we can assume that there exists a minimal set of the action included in fix f here we suppose that f and h are c 1 in neighbourhood of and any point x admits an h unstable manifold wu x using bonatti s techniques we prove that either there exists an integer n such that wu x is included in fix fn or there is a lower bound for the norm of the differential of h only depending on n and the riemannian metric on s combining last statement with a result of agx we show that any faithful action of bs 1 n on s with h a pseudo anosov homeomorphism has a finite orbit as a consequence there is no faithful c 1 action of bs 1 n

which play an important role in combinatorial group theory geometric group theory and dynamical systems in this paper we will focus on dynamical aspects dynamic of baumslag solitar groups in dimension 1 is well understood for actions of baumslag solitar groups on the circle burslem and wilkinson bw gave a classification up to conjugacy of real analytic actions in gl 2 the authors gave a classification up to semi conjugacy of c 1 actions recently bonatti monteverde navas and rivas bmnr generalized these results proving a classification up to conjugacy of c 1 actions the question of existence of global fixed points or finite orbits for group actions on surfaces has been extensively studied and one can consider that the abelian case is now well understood in 1964 in the context of

vectors fields have a common singularity in 1989 bonatti bo proved that two suffi ciently c 1 close to identity commuting diffeomorphisms of the 2 sphere have a common fixed point in 2008 franks handel and parwani fhp proved that an abelian group of c 1 diffeomorphisms isotopic to identity of s has a global fixed point where s is a closed surface of genus at least 2 it is natural to ask what are the algebraic conditions for the existence of a global fixed point in pl plante extended lima s result for nilpotent lie groups and exhibited solvable lie groups acting without global fixed point on surfaces in hw hirsch and weinstein showed that every analytic action of a connected super soluble lie group on a non zero euler characteristic compact surface has a fixed point for fixed points of local actions by lie groups on surfaces we refer to hirsch s survey see hi 1 and hi 2 in ddf druck fang and firmo proved a discrete version of plante s result on nilpo tent groups of diffeomorphisms of the 2 sphere very recently firmo and ribo n gave topological conditions to insure the existence of finite orbits for nilpotent groups of c 1 diffeomorphisms of the 2 torus see fr in some sense solvable baumslag solitar groups bs 1 n represent the next discrete step they are non nilpotent discrete subgroups of the supersoluble lie group a consisting in homeomorphisms of the real line having the form x 7 ax b a 0 b r and therefore are metabelian 2 step solvable in this direction a mccarthy in mcc proved that the trivial bs 1 n action on a compact manifold does not admit c 1 faithful perturbations before stating our results we give some definitions and properties let n n n 2 the solvable baumslag solitar group bs 1 n is defined by bs 1 n a b aba 1 bn it is well known that bs 1 n can be represented as the subgroup of a generated by the two affine maps f 0 x x 1 and h 0 x nx where f 0 b and h 0 a in what follows we will always denote by f h an action of bs 1 n on a surface meaning that the homeomorphisms f and h satisfy h f h 1 fn one can easily check the following properties h fk h 1 fnk fk n for any k z so fk h is also an action of bs 1 n hk f h k fn k for any k n h k fn k hk f for any k n as consequence we have that h k fixf h k fix fn k fix f for any k n in gl the authors of this paper exhibited actions of baumslag solitar groups on t 2 without finite orbit this construction extends on any compact surface and proved the following bs actions on surfaces 3 theorem let f 0 h be two homeomorphims generating a faithful action of bs 1 n on s there exists a positive integer n such that f fn 0 satisfies f is isotopic to identity f h generate a faithful action of bs 1 n on s and fixf 6 and contains a minimal set for f h that is also a minimal set for h the first point is stated in gl for s t 2 for closed orientable surface of genus greater than 1 it is a consequence of the fact that the mapping class group of s does not contain distortion element according to flm and f is a distortion element a corollary of this theorem is that there is no minimal actions of bs 1 n on closed orientable surfaces according to last theorem we may assume without loss of generality that f is isotopic to identity and fix f is not empty in agx alonso guelman xavier proved that theorem let f h be an action of bs 1 n on a closed surface s where f is isotopic to the identity and h is a pseudo anosov homeomorphism with stretch factor n then f id we will now fix some definitions notations and recall some properties that will be used notations let s be a closed connected oriented surface embedded in the 3 dimensionnal euclidean space r 3 endowed with the usual norm denoted by the distance in s associated to the induced riemannian metric is denoted by d the injectivity radius of the exponential map associated to d is denoted by the open 2 ball centered at x with radius r with respect to d is denoted by br x or br for the case that we don t need to specify the center remark in what follows we always assume that radius of balls are strictly less than let f s s be a map definition let be an f invariant compact set we say that f is c 1 if f is c 1 on a neighborhood w of in s suppose that f is c 1 on an open set w of s notations let x w we will denote by df x dxf txs r 3 the differential at x of f considered as a map f s r 3 df x dxf txs tf x s the differential at x of f considered as a map f s s and dxf sup dxf v v tx v 1 we set s f w sup dxf x w 4 nancy guelman and isabelle liousse definitions the c 1 norm of f on a subset v of w is defined by f v sup x v f x dxf we say that f is c 1 close to identity on v if f id v we define v f x s f id x dx f id note that this defi nition implies that f is c 1 at x for any x v f properties there is a constant cs 1 such that for all x y br w with r one has 1 x y d x y cs x y 2 d f x f y s f br d x y theorem 1 let f h be two homeomorphisms generating a faithful action of bs 1 n on s be a minimal set of f h included in fixf and f h are c 1 1 any point x in is an f elliptic fixed point in the sense that eigenvalues of dxf are roots of unit more precisely there exists a positive integer n such that the eigenvalue of dxf n is 1 for any x 2 moreover for all 0 there exists 0 and a c 1 diffeomorphism f f h such that f h generate a faithful action of bs 1 n on s and fixf fix f n where n is given by previous item f id b where b is the union of balls of center in and radius in other words b v f more precisely f is either f n or some nk root of fn thus following mc carthy mcc we can adapt bonatti s tools bo for estimating the norm of the differential of h more precisely we prove theorem 2 let f h and as in theorem 1 let w be a neighborhood of such that f and h are in c 1 on w suppose that any point x has an h unstable manifold w u x then either 1 there exists n n such that w u x fixfn for all x or 2 s h w n cs assumption we refer to fm for the definition and properties of pseudo anosov home omorphisms and we always assume that a pseudo anosov homeomorphism is a c 1 diffeomorphism except at finitely many points the singularities of the stable and unstable foliations using the result of agx we obtain as a corollary corollary 1 any faithful action f h of bs 1 n on s where f is a c 1 diffeomorphism and h is a pseudo anosov homeomorphism has a finite orbit moreover this finite orbit is contained in the set of singularities of h bs actions on surfaces 5 since any pseudo anosov homeomorphism of the torus has no singularities then corollary 2 there is no faithful action f h of bs 1 n on the torus where f is a c 1 diffeomorphism and h is a pseudo anosov homeomorphism 2 proof of theorem 1 proof of item 1 let f and as in theorem 1 and x 0 since is also an h minimal set the h orbit of x 0 is recurrent then there exists a subsequence nk nk such that h nk x 0 x 0 from hnk f h nk fn nk we deduce that dhnk f h nk x 0 df h nk x 0 dh nk x 0 df nnk x 0 moreover the points x 0 and h nk x 0 are fixed by f and dh nk x 0 1 dhnk h nk x 0 then dh nk x 0 1 df h nk x 0 dh nk x 0 df x 0 nnk so df h nk x 0 and df x 0 nnk have same eigenvalues let us denote by resp k the maximum modulus of eigenvalues of df x 0 resp df h nk x 0 and resp k the minimum modulus of eigenvalues of df x 0 resp df h nk x 0 hence k n nk and k n nk as f is c 1 and h nk x 0 x 0 then df h nk x 0 df x 0 therefore k and k consequently 1 and eigenvalues of df x 0 have modulus 1 suppose that is infinite this means that x 0 is not isolated in fixf we are going to prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of df x 0 by contradiction suppose that 1 is not an eigenvalue of df x 0 let us introduce local coordinates near x 0 the map f f id is locally invertible by the inverse function theorem more precisely there exist neighborhoods u of x 0 and v of f x 0 0 0 such that f u v is a diffeomorphism hence f 1 0 0 x 0 which means that x 0 is the unique fixed point of f in u this contradicts the fact that x 0 is not isolated in fix f consequently if is infinite 1 is the unique eigenvalue of df x since f is isotopic to identity it is also orientation preserving and 1 can not be an eigenvalue of df x for any x if is finite there exists p such that hp x 0 x 0 as df x 0 and df h p x 0 np df x 0 np are conjugate eigenvalues of df x 0 are roots of unity thus there exists a positive integer n such that eigenvalues of dfn x 0 are 1 as df n h j x 0 and dfn x 0 nj are conjugate we get that eigenvalues of dfn h j x 0 are 1 since h j x 0 j n we get that eigenvalues of df n x are 1 for any x proof of item 2 we begin by proving 6 nancy guelman and isabelle liousse lemma 2 1 there exists a positive integer n such that either dfn x id for any x or dfn x 6 id for any x proof of lemma 2 1 let x 0 ifdf n x 0 id as df n h p x 0 and df n x 0 np are conjugate we get that dfn h p x 0 id for any p n since h p x 0 p n is dense in we get that dfn x id for any x we can now prove item 2 fix 0 n given by item 1 we set f fn the action of f fn h on s is an action of the baumslag solitar group bs 1 n let x 0 case 1 df x 0 id by lemma 2 1 for all x df x id and we can find an open ball br x contained in v f we claim that min rx x 0 where rx is the greater number such that br x v f indeed suppose that there exists a sequence xp such that rxp 0 without loss of generality we can suppose that xp w by proposition 2 1 w and df w id for p sufficiently large xp b rw 2 w and then rp rw 2 that is a contradiction hence the neighborhood of is contained in v f and we conclude by setting f f case 2 df x 0 6 id by lemma 2 1 df x 6 id for all x we can choose in a continuously way an orthonormal basis on each txs x b where b is a small open ball centered at x 0 according to item 1 and lemma 2 1 for all x b the matrix ofdf x also denoted by df x is conjugate to 1 1 0 1 by some matrix ax that depends continuously on x so norms of ax are uniformly bounded on b let denote f k h k f hk as f is isotopic to identity and has fixed points its conjugate f k is isotopic to identity and has fixed points one can check that 1 f k is a n k root of f that is f n k k h k f hk n k h k f n k hk f 2 f k h generate a faithful action of bs 1 n on s that is h f k h 1 h k 1 f hk 1 h k h f h 1 hk h k f n hk f n k 3 fix f k fix f since h k fix f fix f and 4 fix f k as fix f and h k let x b since f and f k commute the matrices 1 1 0 1 axdf x a 1 x and axdf k x a 1 x commute this implies that axdf k x a 1 x is upper triangular but df x and df k x are conjugate by dh k x so axdf k x a 1 x has a unique eigenvalue 1 then it is of the form 1 0 1 finally 1 1 0 1 axdf x a 1 x axdf k x a 1 x nk 1 0 1 nk 1 nk 0 1 and then 1 nk bs actions on surfaces 7 therefore dx f k id a 1 x 0 1 nk 0 0 ax since the norms of the ax are uniformly bounded on b and we choose orthonormal basis for tangent spaces we can find an integer k such that supx b dx f k id is strictly less than for any k k hence for any x 0 we can find an open ball br x 0 contained in v f k therefore by compactness of there is a positive uniform radius such that the neighborhood of is contained in v f k we conclude by setting f f k this ends the proof of theorem 1 3 proof of theorem 2 3 1 flow like properties in this subsection we will prove a local version of bonatti flow like properties for c 1 closed to identity diffeomorphisms proposition 3 1 given n n for all 0 1 there exists n 0 such that fn y y n f y y f y y for any f homeo s 0 m and y s satisfying y b x 0 and bm x 0 v n f where x 0 fix f and m 1 3 cs n 1 remark 1 note that bm x 0 v n f means that f is c 1 and n c 1 close to identity on bm x 0 proof let 0 1 be given proceed using induction on k 1 n the k 1 case is trivial choose 1 min m 4 n 1 2 let k 1 n 1 we suppose that 0 1 there exists k such that for f homeo s x 0 fix f and 0 m such that bm x 0 v k f we have fk y y k f y y f y y y b x 0 we have to estimate fk 1 y y k 1 f y y fk 1 y y k 1 f y y f id fk y f id y fk y y k f y y we choose k 1 k 2 then we get that fk y y k f y y 2 f y y for all y b x 0 and bm x 0 v k 1 f to bound the first term we first show that fk y bm x 0 provided that y b x 0 and bm x 0 v k 1 f indeed d fk y x 0 d x 0 y d f k y y d x 0 y cs f k y y d x 0 y cs k 2 f y y by inductive hypothesis moreover 8 nancy guelman and isabelle liousse f y y f y f x 0 x 0 y f b x 0 d x 0 y d x 0 y f b x 0 1 since b x 0 v k 1 f and k 1 1 we have f b x 0 2 and therefore we get f y y 3 finally d fk y x 0 1 3 cs n 1 that is f k y bm x 0 the first term can be bounded as follows f id fk y f id y f id bm x 0 f k y y f id bm x 0 k 2 f y y by inductive hypothesis then f id fk y f id y k 2 k 2 f y y moreover k 2 k 2 k 2 k k 2 2 k 4 n 4 by the choice of 1 and the fact that the k can be chosen to be decreasing in k and in such a way that given k n one has k k for 0 finally we can bound the first term by 2 f y y and therefore one has fk 1 y y k 1 f y y f y y for all y b x 0 and bm x 0 v k 1 f corollary 3 given n n n 1 there exists 0 such that for any 0 m and f homeo s such that bm x 0 v f any f n fixed point y b x 0 is fixed by f where x 0 fix f and m is defined as in proposition 3 1 proof by proposition 3 1 for 1 there exists n 1 0 such that fn y y n f y y f y y for any f homeo s x 0 fix f y b x 0 and bm x 0 v f then fn y y n 1 f y y therefore if y is fn fixed we have that y is f fixed 3 2 proof of theorem 2 the key tool of proof of theorem 2 is the following proposition 3 2 let 0 m let h f and w as in theorem 2 verifying that for any x y with d x y one has d f x f y 2 b and f b are contained in w any point of admits an h unstable manifold let 0 1 such that f id bm n where n and m are given by proposition 3 1 i e bm v n f if s h w n cs then there exists r 0 such that for any x w uloc x br x fix f bs actions on surfaces 9 proof let x 0 there exists p 0 p 0 x 0 such that for all y w u loc x 0 b x 0 one has d h p x 0 h p y for any p p 0 note that a p 0 1 j 0 hj b h j x 0 is a non empty open set that contains x 0 then it intersects w u loc x in an open arc containing x 0 more precisely by hyperbolicity there exists a constant c c h such that b c x 0 w uloc x 0 h j w uloc h j x 0 b h j x 0 j n then b c x 0 w u loc x 0 a from now we will denote r c and w uloc x 0 br x 0 by wr x 0 first we prove that any point y wr x 0 is f periodic let y wr x 0 it is easy to check that for all p n h p y b h p x 0 indeed if p p 0 we have d h p x 0 h p y by definition of p 0 and if p p 0 by definition of r and a we have that y hp b h p x 0 if f y y in particular y is f periodic if f y 6 y there exists some l l y such that h l y is close enough to h l x 0 fixf to ensure that f h l y h l y f y y therefore there exists some p p y l such that f h p 1 y h p 1 y f h p y h p y indeed by contradiction let us denote yj h j y for j n we would have f y y f y 1 y 1 f yl yl f y y notice that as h p 1 y b h p 1 x 0 we have that d yp 1 f yp 1 d yp 1 h p 1 x 0 d f yp 1 h p 1 x 0 d f yp 1 f h p 1 x 0 since yp 1 and f yp 1 are in w one has d h f yp 1 h yp 1 s h w d f yp 1 yp 1 we adapt mccarthy s argument fn yp yp hfh 1 yp yp d hfh 1 yp yp d hf yp 1 h yp 1 s h w d f yp 1 yp 1 s h w cs f yp 1 yp 1 s h w cs f yp yp since yp b h p x 0 and bm h p x 0 v n f we can apply proposition 3 1 to obtain fn yp yp n f yp yp and consequently n f yp yp s h w cs f yp yp therefore either n s h w cs that contradicts the hypothesis or f yp yp 0 which implies that yp h p y is f fixed then y is fn p fixed hence we have proven that any point y wr x 0 is f periodic now we will prove that any point y wr x 0 is f fixed 10 nancy guelman and isabelle liousse by contradiction let y wr x 0 fixf and p 0 be the smallest integer such that y is fn p 0 fixed point since fix fn p hp fix f we have that p 0 is the smallest integer such that h p 0 y is in fix f by definition of p 0 we have that h p 0 1 y is in fix fn fix f and by definition of r and a h p 0 1 y b h p 0 1 x 0 this is impossible according to corollary 3 end of the proof of theorem 2 let 0 and n given by proposition 3 1 suppose that s h w n cs by theorem 1 there exists 0 and f f n such that f id bm n and f h generate a faithful action of bs 1 n on s and fix f by proposition 3 2 there exists r such that for all x wr x fix f let x 0 we are going to prove that w u x 0 fixf by contradiction suppose that w u x 0 is not contained in fix f therefore there exists a segment a b in w u x 0 and c a b such that a c fix f and c b is disjoint of fix f let p be an integer such that h p c b br h p x 0 w u h p x 0 fix f hence c b fix fn p we have proven that there exists a segment a b in w u x 0 and c a b such that a c fix f and c b fix f np fix f the set c np 1 k 0 f k a b is a f invariant continuum one can check that main theorem of wea applies then all but a finite number of points in c have the same least period so all but a finite number of points in a b are fixed by f this is a contradiction finally we have proved that given 0 either s h w n cs or w u x 0 fix f fix fn therefore if w u x 0 is not included in fix f n then for any 0 s h w n cs let converges to 0 then if w u x 0 is not included in fix f n then s h w n cs 4 proof of corollary 1 in this section we prove that any baumslag solitar action with a pseudo anosov ele ment has a finite orbit let f h be a faithful action of bs 1 n on s we suppose that h is pseudo anosov homeomorphism we have already noted that we can assume that f admits fixed points let k n f and hk generate a faithful action of bs 1 nk and there is a minimal subset k of this action that is included in fix f as h k is a pseudo anosov homeomorphism of s any point admits an hk unstable manifold note that for all k n hk is c 1 on s except at the set of singularities of h suppose that the compact set fix f is disjoint from then there exists a neighbor hood w of fix f and of k for any k n such that f and h k are c 1 on w moreover s hk w sup dxh k x w cw k for any k n see e g fm hence we can apply theorem 2 to f and hk and we obtain that either 1 there exists n n such that w u x fixfn for all x k or bs actions on surfaces 11 2 s hk w n k cs in the first case as hk is pseudo anosov homeomorphism there exists x k such that the hk unstable manifold of x is dense in s and therefore fix fn s hence fn id and the action is not faithful consequently it holds that s hk w n k cs for all k n finally this implies that n according to agx n and therefore n n but this is not possible we conclude that fix f 6 as is a finite h invariant set we deduce that the action has a finite orbit references agx j alonso n guelman j xavier actions of
