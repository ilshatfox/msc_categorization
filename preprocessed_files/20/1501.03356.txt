nt keywords spin 2 condensates gross pitaevskii equation spin textile of the ground state stability of the ground state i introduction since the success of trapping cold atoms via optical trap 1 the study of condensates of atoms with nonzero spin is a hot topic there are numerous literatures dedicated to the study of the ground state g s for spin 2 condensates the g s was found to have three phases namely the ferro phase polar phase and cyclic phase depending on the features of the interaction 2 4 on the other hand it has been revealed that the total hamiltonian of the spin 2 systems is associated with the u 5 so 5 so 3 symmetry 5 6 since there are elegant theory dealing with this symmetry it is worthy to derive a generalized gross pitaevskii gp equation adapted to the u 5 so 5 so 3 symmetry since the solutions of this equation could provide the details of the low lying states we believe that the understanding to the spin 2 condensates could be thereby enriched we consider the case that the magnetic field b 0 the symmetry adapted gp equation is derived firstly then by solving the gp equation both the spin textiles and the spatial wave functions of the low lying states can be known the emphasis is placed on the g s since the stability of the g s is affected by its environment in addition to the g s itself special effort is made to study the environment namely the width of the gap the energy difference between the first excited state and the g s and the level density in the neighborhood of the g s this is a topic less studied before besides the degeneracy of the g s is an important feature which is also studied in this paper the total magnetization m corresponding author stsbcg mail sysu edu cn is considered as being conserved which depends on how the system is experimentally prepared the influence of m on the spin textiles and the degeneracy of the g s is found to be great after we have obtained the spatial wave functions physical quantities related to the spatial degrees of free dom can be known in particular we have calculated the root mean square radius rrms since rrms is an ob servable theoretical results and experimental data can be compared with each other this is a notable way to check the theory the gp equation will be firstly solved analyt ically under the thomas fermi approximation tfa a number of formulae relating the physical quantities have been thereby obtained and the underlying physics can be understood in an analytical way then strict numeri cal calculations are performed to check the validity of the tfa ii inherent symmetry and the gross pitaevskii equation a condensate with n spin 2 neutral atoms trapped by an isotropic harmonic potential 1 2 m 2 r 2 is considered in which the spin orbit coupling is assumed to be weak it is further assumed that the trap is not so weak say 100 s 1 and the spin dependent interaction is weak so that the spin modes are much lower than and sepa rated from the spatially excited modes this is the basic assumption of this paper in other words the following results hold only for the systems adapted to this assump tion in this case a group of excited states distinct in their spin modes would emerge in the neighborhood of the g s in each of these states including the g s all the particles have a common spatial wave function which http arxiv org abs 1501 03356 v 1 2 is most advantageous to binding and adapted to a spe cific spin textile thus one of these states with a specific spin mode can be in general written as n j 1 rj 1 where is the common spatial wave function and is a total spin state which is now unknown if the particles did not fall into the same state but have some of them getting excited the total energy would be thereby higher the group totally form a band which is called the ground band the states not in the ground band will contain various spatially excited modes and will not be studied in this paper when and m are used as units for energy and length where m is the mass and is given at the one of 87 rb the total hamiltonian is h i h i i j vij 2 where h i 1 2 2 i 12 r 2 i vij ri rj s gsp ij s p ijs ms i j sms i j sms i is the spin state of the i th particle and the two spins of i and j are coupled to the combined spin s and its z component ms s 0 2 or 4 obviously p ij s is the projector onto the s channel gs is the strength related to the scattering length of the s channel we introduce an operator defined in the total spin space as v i j s gsp ij s it has been proved that v is a linear combination of a set of casimir opera tors belonging to a chain of nested algebra as u 5 so 5 so 3 5 6 consequently the eigenstates and the eigenenergies of v can be exactly known as v e vs 3 now represents a group of quantum numbers v ntri s and m where s and m are the total spin and its z component and ntri will be explained below and vntrism is the related eigenstate for convenience m 0 is assumed when two spins are coupled to zero they form a sin glet pair pair ij i j 0 when three spins are coupled to zero they form a triplet and can be approx imately denoted as tri 0 this notation is ex act when n 7 in the triplet every pair of spins are coupled to 2 it turns out that the singlet pair and triplet are basic building blocks an eigenstate may con tain npair singlet pairs and ntri triplets the quantum number v n 2 npair is named the seniority which is the number of particles not in the singlet pairs the number of particles neither in the pairs nor the triplets is nfree n 2 npair 3 ntri the total spin s is con tributed by them it has been proved that when npair ntri s and m are given the totally symmetric eigen state vntrism is unique the four quantum numbers are bound by the following conditions i nfree 0 ii nfree s 2 nfree iii s 2 nfree 1 is not allowed and of course iv m s 5 8 let us define g 04 g 0 g 4 g 24 g 2 g 4 and g 024 1 3 g 0 g 2 g 4 then the eigenenergy associated with is 5 e vs a 1 n a 2 n n 4 gvv v 3 gss s 1 4 where gv 7 g 04 10 g 24 70 gs g 24 14 a 1 11 15 g 04 142 g 24 5 2 g 024 and a 2 115 g 04 1 42 g 24 1 2 g 024 note that e vs does not depend on ntri implying that the levels might be degenerate as shown below 8 inserting eq 1 into the schro dinger equation we have n j 2 rj h e n j 1 rj 0 5 where the integration covers all the degrees of freedom except r 1 from this equation and making use of eq 3 it is straight forward to obtain the symmetry adapted gp equation for the normalized r 1 as h 2 n e vs 0 6 where is the chemical potential after solving eq 6 we can obtain the total energy e n vtot where vtot 4 dr e vs is the total interaction energy the whole spectrum of the ground band can be obtained from the set e obviously this equation is a general ization of the one for spin 1 condensates given in ref 9 it is also a more accurate version for the one given as eq 74 in ref 4 in which the spin dependent interac tion has been neglected iii thomas fermi approximation since n is usually large eq 6 can be solved by using the tfa neglecting the kinetic term in eq 6 when and are used as units the normalized tfa solution is 15 8 r 3 0 1 r r 0 2 and r 20 2 where r 0 15 2 n e vs 1 5 7 is the tf radius from this solution we can obtain the root mean square radius rrms r 2 1 2 3 7 r 0 and the total energy e 1 7 3257 27 2 1 5 n 3 5 e vs 2 5 5 6 nr 2 rms 8 thus the total energy is directly related to the size mea sured by rrms when n is large we know from eq 4 that e vs is proportional to n 2 accordingly rrms n 1 5 and e 3 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 51000 53000 55000 57000 59000 61000 5 43 2 1 ba cyclic ferro polar ferro ferro iii n m d ii m 2 m 1 e gs h i n 2 n 1 fig 1 color on line the ground state energy egs in versus n 12000 and 300 s 1 are assumed the same in the following figures except specified the total magneti zation is given at five cases as m 0 1000 n 2 n 1000 and 2 n respectively for the curves 1 to 5 there are three regions of separated by a tan 1 7 n m 2 3 10 n m 2 2 and b tan 1 7 10 marked by the two vertical dotted lines in each region the g s has its specific v s d marked in the region where d is the degeneracy in region i egs is m independent in i and ii the g s is not degenerate d 1 in iii the degeneracy depends on m seriously for the curves 1 to 5 d 1 167 2001 167 and 1 respectively n 7 5 thus the size increases with n very slowly but e increases with n faster than linearly on the other hand it is noted that in the units of and all the strengths gs where is the magni tude of i e s 1 therefore e vs when independent units are used the size is described by rrms 2 5 i e a stronger trap leads to a smaller size similarly one can prove that the chemical poten tial 6 5 and the total energy e 6 5 thus the total energy will increase with a little faster than linearly iv ground state and its phase it is obvious from eq 4 that which pair of v and s is more advantageous to binding depends on the com petition between gv and gs which depend on g 04 and g 24 and they are considered as variable therefore we introduce a variable parameter to manifest the com petition in the units of and the strengths are assumed as g 04 u 1 2 cos g 24 u 1 2 sin g 024 2 5 u 1 2 and u 10 3 for a comparison the realistic strengths for 87 rb are g 24 0 28 u 1 2 g 04 0 41 u 1 2 and g 024 2 39 u 1 2 in fact it has been shown previously that the phase of the g s depends on 2 4 under the tfa the ground state energy egs is just the lowest e given by eqs 8 and 4 although e does not directly depend on m the condition s m restricts the possible choice of s and egs is thereby af fected egs versus with m given at five values are shown in fig 1 there are two critical points a tan 1 7 n m 2 3 10 n m 2 2 and b tan 1 7 10 5 when goes through either a or b a phase transition will occur this phenomenon was found as early as in 2000 by using the mean field theory in which a tan 1 7 10 and the same b were found 2 the present more accurate result will tend to the old one when n is large when is in 0 a i e in region i the g s does not depend on m and will have v s d n 2 n 1 where d is the degeneracy of the state since all the spins align along a common direction in this g s it is in the ferro phase 2 4 when is in a b i e in region ii the g s de pends on m and will have v s d m 2 m 1 since v m 2 and s m all the m 2 unpaired spins must align along a common direction so that the total spin can be maximized i e s can be equal m thus each g s in region ii is a mixture of a group of aligned spins together with the n m 2 2 singlet pairs namely a mixture of ferro phase and polar phase when m 0 v s d 0 0 1 thus it is in pure polar phase we have assumed that n is even otherwise s 2 when m is larger more spins are in the ferro phase and accordingly egs gets higher as shown in the figure when m 2 n v s d n 2 n 1 and the g s is in pure ferro phase when is in b 2 i e in region iii the g s de pends also on m and has v s d n m d note that these g s have v n therefore they do not con tain any singlet pairs but the spins in triplets are al lowed it is recalled that in regions i and ii the g s has s 2 v it implies that all the unpaired spins must be aligned and therefore there is no room for the triplets whereas in iii the number of triplets ntri can have dif ferent choices in a specific domain under the constraints of symmetry given in points i to iv in the paragraph above eq 4 while those spins not in the triplets are coupled to s m this leads to the degeneracy of the g s 8 when m 0 the g s has s 0 and therefore nfree 0 point ii thus all the particles are in the triplets i e in a pure cyclic phase and henceforth d 1 we have assumed that n is a multiple of 3 to simplify the discussion when m 2 n the g s has s 2 n and therefore nfree n thus neither the pairs nor the triplets emerge i e in a pure ferro phase and hence forth d 1 also when m is neither 0 nor 2 n the g s is in general degenerate in particular when m n nfree can be ranged from m 2 to m each step is 3 in this case the degeneracy d is maximized the curve 3 in iii has d 2001 the appearance of highly degenerate g s in the region iii is a notable feature it is reminded that the polar phase is composed of s 0 pairs therefore when g 0 is less positive than g 2 and g 4 the g s will prefer this phase the cyclic phase is composed of s 0 triplets in which every pair of spins must be coupled to s 2 therefore when g 2 is less 4 positive the g s will prefer this phase while the ferro phase is composed of aligned spins in which every two must be coupled to s 4 therefore when g 4 is less positive the g s will prefer this phase thus the phase transitions manifested above reflects the competition of the interactions of the three s channels the competition depends on m because the least number of spins that must be aligned is determined by m when m 2 n is given the ferro phase is the only choice disregarding how the interaction is as shown by the uppermost curve in fig 1 when n is sufficiently large the terms 1 n can be neglected then we have e vs a 2 gv 4 gs n 2 n 2 1 6 cos sin 1 25 u 1 2 9 from this formula we know that e vs has a minimum at 4 and a maximum at 5 4 where e vs 15 2 4 12 2 n 2 u 1 2 since the total energy is proportional to n 3 5 e vs 2 5 as shown in eq 8 with n 12000 and our parameters the minimum at 4 has egs 51612 and the maximum at 5 4 has egs 60125 this explains the origin of the dip and the highest peak in fig 1 since the root mean square radius is an observable it is desirable to study rrms so that the theory can be checked via experimental measurement according to eq 7 rrms is proportional to egs 1 2 thus the vari ation of rrms versus with the minimum and maximum is predicted in particular when 4 5 4 and the unit is replaced by m the minimum maximum in fig 1 is associated with rrms 3 53 3 81 m in region ii and iii it is predicted that the increase of m would lead to the increase of the size this is also a point to be checked v stability of the ground state it is believed that the stability of the g s is assured by the gap egap namely the energy difference between the first excited state and the g s the former has its v s slightly different from that of the g s vg sg and can be easily obtained from eq 4 an example of egap is shown in fig 2 note that when m 2 n v s n 2 n is the only choice no choice other than n 2 n is allowed thus under m conservation there are no excited spin modes hence in order to show the gap for a very large m the curve 5 in fig 2 is not given as m 2 n but m 2 n 4 fig 2 has the following features i since eq 4 manifests that the energy is nearly v 2 and s 2 the gap would be in general large if both vg and sg are large in this case a small deviation in v s will cause a great change in energy whereas if one of them is zero the gap would be much lower in region i the g s is in the ferro phase with vg sg n 2 n therefore the gap is very high and accordingly 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 iiiiii ba e ga p h 5 4 3 21 fig 2 color on line the energy gap egap in versus the parameters are the same as in fig 1 except that the curve 5 has m 2 n 4 instead of m 2 n the g s is very stable in the ferro phase in ii and iii the upmost curve in fig 2 has m 2 n 4 accordingly vg sg n 2 2 n 4 and n 2 n 4 respectively since they are also large the gap is also high when m 2 n 4 the g s is very close to be in ferro phase and therefore is stable however when m decreases the stability reduces in particular when m 0 vg sg 0 0 and n 0 in ii and iii respectively in this case egap 0 00012 was found in both ii and iii as shown by the lowest curve in fig 2 thus the g s in polar and cyclic phases with a small m are highly unstable ii egap in every region appears as a peak namely in the middle part it is higher but very low when is close to the borders for fig 2 the g s in i has v s n 2 n while the first excited state has v s n 2 n 2 if 0 4722 thus the excitation from n 2 n to n 2 n 2 is caused by a change in s however when 0 accordingly gs 0 therefore the gap is zero on the other hand the first excited state has v s n 2 2 n 4 when 0 4722 a from eq 4 we know the gap e n 2 n e n 2 2 n 4 4 70 7 n 1 2 g 04 10 n 2 g 24 10 one can prove that the gap is zero when a tan 1 7 n 1 2 10 n 2 since a is extremely close to a this explains the decline of the gap when a based on eq 4 the decline of the peak in ii and iii can be similarly explained thus in the neighborhoods of the borders the g s is highly unstable in addition to the gap another factor that could af fect the stability of the g s is the level density in the neighborhood of the lowest level this density can be calculated based on eq 8 as an example the num ber of levels with excitation energy 0 1 is given in table i in which seven choices of and four choices of 5 m are chosen the other parameters are the same as in fig 1 if the degeneracy of a level is d then the number contributed by this level is d table i the number of levels lower than 0 1 versus m and a and b denote the borders 0 01 the first column gives the region of region number of levels m 0 m n m 2 n 4 i 4 1 1 1 i a 4 4 2 ii

low lying states is rather diffuse together with the big gap both factors assure the stability of the g s when the number 1 as shown in the second row there is no excited states lower than 0 1 ii when is in region ii and m is very small i e in or close to the polar phase the density is extremely dense together with the very small gap both factors lead to a highly unstable g s this situation can be greatly improved when m gets larger iii when is in region iii and m is not very large say m n the low lying spectrum is also dense but not as dense as in the polar phase note that when m is not close to 0 or 2 n say 0 05 2 n m 0 95 2 n it has been mentioned that the states in cyclic phase could be highly degenerate the great degeneracy contributes to the level density substantially say in the last row of table i the number 2001 arises completely from the degeneracy of the g s vi numerical solutions of the symmetry adapted gp equation by making use of the tfa we have obtained analytical solutions thereby the related physics can be understood in an analytical way in order to evaluate the accuracy of the tfa the equation with the kinetic energy included is solved numerically and the results are given below for a comparison firstly we found that the curves for egs from the numerical solutions as a whole is an upward shift of those plotted in fig 1 it implies that the amount of total kinetic energies contained in various states with very different spin textiles are similar and the egs given under the tfa are correct when n 12000 except the omission of the kinetic energy the shift is about 3 5 103 thus the kinetic energy is about 6 of the total energy in our cases secondly we found that the curves for egap from the numerical solutions overlap the curves from tfa plotted in fig 2 it implies that the amount of kinetic energies contained in the g s and in the first excited state is similar thus the spin excitation does not remarkably affect the spatial motion table ii

4 c are very close to straight lines the rrms from tfa are given inside the parentheses and are smaller from the table we know that the tfa leads to a 8 reduction of the rrms if n 1200 or a 2 reduction of the rrms if n 12000 nonethe less the two features found previously under the tfa re main unchanged namely i when the g s is not in the ferro phase a larger m leads to a larger size ii when the g s is in the ferro phase a or m 2 n the size is minimized when 4 and is maximized when 5 4 it has been predicted based on the tfa that rrms n 1 5 to check this relation log 10 rrms from the numeri cal solutions are plotted in fig 3 versus log 10 n in 3 a to 3 c the curves are not exactly straight lines their slopes depend on n and are plotted in 3 d to 3 f respectively disregarding m and

log 10 the slopes of the curves tend to 2 5 when increases as predicted vii summary the generalized gp equation adapted to the u 5 so 5 so 3 symmetry has been derived for spin 2 condensates this equation has been solved analytically under the tfa and by strict numerical calculation it was found that the tfa is applicable if n is large say n 104 the emphasis is placed on the g s based on a rigorous treatment of the spin degrees of freedom the detailed spin textiles i e the ferro polar and cyclic phases and their mixing are explained in a many body way and thus the underlying physics can be understood beyond the mean field theory besides the variation of the spin textiles versus m in regions ii and iii is no table note that the factors affecting the stability of the g s such as the gap and the neighboring level density together with the degeneracy of the g s itself are less touched in existing literatures these factors are studied in detail in this paper the great difference in the sta bility and degeneracy caused by varying which marks the features of the interaction and m is notable this is true even when varies within a region i e the g s remains in the same phase we believe that the effect of these factors would be serious when the temperature is very low since rrms is an observable efforts have also been made to clarify the relation between rrms and n and this provides a way for checking the theories with experimental data acknowledgments the project is supported by the national basic re search program of china under the grant 10874249 1 j stenger et al
