which asked whether it is the case that if h and k are isomorphic subgroups of a finite solvable group g and h is maximal in g then k is also maximal this continues work begun in 1 by i m isaacs and the second author we prove here that if newman s question has a negative answer for the triple g h k ie h is maximal in g but the isomorphic subgroup k is not then p 3 and for q 5 p we have oq h oq k oq g and newman s question also has a negative answer for the triple g h k where g g oq g etc furthermore we prove that g has a homo morphic image g such that newman s question has a negative answer for the triple g h k while f g f h and f k are all q groups and o 2 3 h involves qd q as an application we prove that if g is a finite solvable group such that h and k are isomorphic subgroups of g with h maximal and k not maximal with g h g k a power of the prime p then p 3 and a hall 2 3 subgroup l of h necessarily involves s 3 a 4 and a non abelian group of order 8 in fact l involves at least one of s 4 or qd 3 in particular l is neither 2 closed nor 3 closed 1 http arxiv org abs 1809 08821 v 1 1 introduction in this note we make further remarks on a question of moshe newman which asked whether it is the case that if h and k are isomorphic subgroups of a finite solvable group g and h is maximal in g then k is also maximal this continues work begun in 1 where it was proved that this is true if h either has abelian sylow 2 subgroups or a sylow tower and it was noted in theorem 3 of that paper that in a minimal counterexample g we have op g 1 where g h is a power of the prime p 2 notation assumed background and prelim inary results recall that a finite group l is said to be involved in the finite group g if there is a subgroup h of g and a normal subgroup k of g such that h k l we will make frequent use of the first lemma throughout lemma 1 let x be a finite solvable group and be a set of primes let t be a finite group and let y be a hall subgroup of x then t is involved in x if and only if t is involved in y proof it is clear that t is involved in x if t is involved in y we prove the opposite implication by induction on x suppose that u v are subgroups of x with v u and u v t then t is certainly involved in u if u x then t is involved in a hall subgroup of u by induction but any hall subgroup of u is conjugate to a subgroup of y so that t is involved in y hence we may suppose that u x and that v x with x v t let m be a minimal normal subgroup of x contained in v then m is either a group or a group now t u m v m so that t is involved in x m by induction t is involved in the hall subgroup ym m of x m if m is a group then y m is a hall subgroup of x m and we are done since we already remarked that t is involved in y m if m is a group then ym m y so t is involved in y and the proof of the lemma is complete let r be a prime the group qd r is the semi direct product of the natural module for sl 2 r with sl 2 r note that qd r r 3 r 2 1 and that qd 2 is isomorphic to the symmetric group s 4 note also that qd 3 is a 2 3 group we recall that qd r is solvable if and only if r 5 in this note the more elementary fact that qd r has at least three prime divisors when r 3 usually suffices for our purposes for r 1 and r 1 can t both be powers of 2 when r is a prime greater than 3 using lemma 1 we note that if qd r is involved in a solvable group x then r 5 and qd r is involved in a hall 2 3 subgroup of x 2 using theorems of stellmacher and glauberman and lemma 1 for each finite r group r there is a characteristic subgroup w r of r which is non trivial whenever r is non trivial such that whenever x is a finite solvable group with sylow r subgroup r then we have x or x nx w r and furthermore or x w r is characteristic in x unless perhaps r 5 and qd r is involved in a hall 2 3 subgroup of x when r is odd we may take w r zj r when n is an integer we let n denote the set of prime divisors of n we will make frequent use of the following easy lemma lemma 2 let x be a finite solvable group and be a set of primes let y be a subgroup of x with x y then o y o x proof let u be a hall subgroup of x containing o y since y contains a hall subgroup of x we have x y u uy now we have o x x xu x y y u y o y as claimed corollary 3 let x be a finite solvable group and y be a subgroup of x whose index is a power of the prime s let r be a prime divisor of x different from s then o r s y and o r s x have a common sylow r subgroup proof by lemma 2 applied with r s we have o r s y o r s x note that y contains a sylow r subgroup of x so that y certainly contains a sylow r subgroup r of o r s x now r y o r s x y o r s y so that o r s y contains a sylow r subgroup of o r s x on the other hand since o r s y o r s x a sylow r subgroup of o r s y is contained in some sylow r subgroup of o r s x 3 statement and proof of theorem a theorem a let h be a maximal subgroup of the finite solvable group g and suppose that g h pa where p is a prime and a is a positive integer let k be a subgroup of g which is isomorphic to h suppose that k is not maximal in g then p 3 and for q 5 p we have oq h oq g oq k and for g g oq g etc h and k are isomorphic subgroups of g with h maximal and k not maximal proof let h k be an isomorphism 3 we proceed by induction on g note that if n is a invariant normal subgroup of h then n n h k and then n h k g then induces an isomorphism between h n and k n and h n is maximal in g n but k n is not maximal in g n using theorem 3 of 1 and lemma 2 we may conclude that op g 1 for if not then we have op g op g h by the former result and both op h op g and op k op g by the latter then we have op g op h and op h op k op g since op g op h op k we have op g op g so we may apply the argument above with op g in the role of n we may suppose by induction that the theorem holds for the triple g n h n k n then p 3 since g n h n g h and we note that g oq g g n oq g n for q 5 p hence the theorem holds for g in this case thus we may suppose that op g 1 since op g 1 and by lemma 2 op h op g we see that f h is a p group as is the isomorphic group f k also there is a prime r 6 p such that or h 6 1 suppose first that r 3 then by lemma 1 we have o r p h o r p g and likewise o r p k o r p g furthermore by corollary 3 we may suppose possibly after replacing k by a conjugate that o r p h o r p g and o r p k all have a common sylow r subgroup say s since op h op k op g 1 we see that w s is characteristic in each of o r p h o r p k and o r p g where w s is the glauberman stellmacher characteristic subgroup of s for note that o r p g does not in volve qd 2 or qd 3 since r 3 and likewise for o r p h and o r p k thus w s g furthermore o r p h o r p k 4 and composing with an inner automorphism ofk if necessary we may suppose that s s in which case w s w s then induces an isomorphism between h w s and k w s by induction the theorem holds for g w s in particular p 3 and setting q 5 p we see that w s is a q group and that the theorem therefore holds for g hence we may suppose that f h is a q group for some prime q 3 if p 6 5 q we may argue as above that w t is normal in each of o q p h o q p g and o q p k where t is a common sylow q subgroup of o q p h o q p g and o q p k this time o q p g does not involve qd 2 or qd 3 since p 3 but that leads to a contradiction since the theorem holds for g w t and then we see that g h g w t h w t is either a power of 2 or power of 3 so p 3 contrary to current assumptions now we may suppose that p 3 and that f h is a q group where q 5 p since g h is a power of p and op g 1 we have f g h so that f g f h and f g is a q group since h k we also see that f k is a q group the proof of theorem a is complete 4 statement and proof of theorem b and some consequences theorem b let h be a maximal subgroup of the finite solvable group g and suppose that g h pa where p 3 is a prime and a is a positive integer let k be a subgroup of g which is isomorphic to h suppose that k is not maximal in g and that f h f k and f g are all q groups where q 5 p let q be a sylow q subgroup of h then g has a homomorphic image g such that h and k the respective images of h and k are isomorphic subgroups of g with h maximal and k not maximal and with f h f k and f g all q groups furthermore o 2 3 h involves qd q and no non identity characteristic subgroup of q is normal in h proof let h k be the isomorphism as before we may and do suppose that q q composing with an inner automorphism of k if necessary using theorem a we may suppose that there is no non trivial invariant normal subgroup of h for otherwise if 1 6 n h is invariant and chosen of maximal order subject to these conditions then n n h k so n h k g and induces an isomorphism between h n and k n by theorem a we have oq h n oq g n oq k n 1 5 by the maximal choice of n hence f h n f k n and f g n are all q groups and the theorem holds for g n by induction so it holds for g suppose now that o 2 3 h does not involve qd q then as before q contains a common sylow q subgroup t of o 2 3 h o 2 3 k and o 2 3 g such that w t h and w t w t contradicting the fact that there is no non trivial invariant normal subgroup of h hence o 2 3 h involves qd q if there is a non identity characteristic subgroup s of q which is normal in h then we have s s since q q again contradicting the fact that no non trivial invariant normal subgroup of h the proof of theorem b is complete we may combine theorems a and b to deduce corollary c let g be a finite solvable group and h k be isomorphic subgroups of g such that h is maximal but k is not and with g h pa for some prime p and positive integer a suppose with no loss of generality that h k contains a hall p subgroup of g this is just a matter of replacing k by a conjugate if necessary then p 3 let h k be an isomorphism chosen so that q q for a sylow q subgroup q of h where q 5 p this can be achieved by composing with an inner automorphism of k if necessary let c be the unique maximal invariant normal subgroup of g which is contained in h k and let g g c etc then f h f k and f g are all q groups also qd q is involved in o 2 3 h and no non identity characteristic subgroup of q is normal in h proof the proofs of theorems a and b show that unless g itself can play the role of g there is a non identity invariant normal subgroupn of g contained in both h and k such that h n and k n are isomorphic with h n maximal in g n and k n not maximal in that case since n c we may suppose that the theorem holds in g n by induction and then it holds in g corollary d let g be a finite solvable group containing isomorphic subgroups h and k such that h is maximal in g but k is not then g h g k is a power of a prime p 3 and a hall 2 3 subgroup l of h involves qd q where q 5 p in particular l involves s 3 a 4 and a non abelian group of order 8 so that l is neither 2 closed nor 2 nilpotent references 1 isaacs i m robinson g r isomorphic subgroups of
