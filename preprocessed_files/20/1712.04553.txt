maxdim of some simple groups liu tianyue and r keith dennis 1 introduction there are various generalizations of the concept of dimension for vector spaces in finite group theory in this paper we are primarily concerned with three of them namely m g maxdim g and i g definition 1 1 a list of subgroups h 1 hn are said to be in general position if for all i 1 n j 6 i hj j hj i maxdim g of a finite group g is defined as the maximal size of a list of g s maximal subgroups in general position ii m g is defined as the maximal size of an irredundant generating sequence in g iii i g is defined as the maximal size of an irredundant sequence in g the basic relation between those group invariants is captured by the following theorem theorem 1 2 for a finite group g m g maxdim g i g maxdim m and i can also be defined using the subgroup lattice for a set n with n elements the power set p n has a partial order induced by inclusion we shall call a poset t a tower with dimension n if it is isomorphic to p n and call the pre images of n i element sets in p n the i th level of the tower in this context we can see that the following proposition holds proposition 1 i i g is the dimension of the largest tower embeddable in the subgroup lattice of g ii maxdim g is the dimension of the largest tower embeddable in the sub group lattice of g so that all first level elements of the tower are maximal subgroups that is for a first level element s a s a s or a g iii m g is the dimension of the largest tower embeddable in the subgroup lattice of g so that the join of all n 1 th level elements of the tower is g and all n 1 th level elements are the joins of the n th level element and cyclic before we proceed to the results on the maxdim of simple groups we shall state some useful lemma here lemma 1 3 m g max i m m is maximal subgroup of g 1 i g max m g max i m m is maximal subgroup of g date july 2017 1 ar x iv 1 71 2 04 55 3 v 1 m at h g r 1 2 d ec 2 01 7 2 liu tianyue and r keith dennis 2 the suzuki groups in this section we compute m and maxdim for some suzuki groups of lie type the main result was almost implied by a proof in the thesis of whiston although he did not state the claim in his paper proposition 2 if q is a prime power of 2 then suz q has maxdim m 3 proof to prove the proposition we need to use the following theorem of suzuki 6 theorem 2 1 suz q acts 2 transitively on q 2 1 points the maximal subgroups of suz q fall in one of the conjugacy classes listed below i stabilizers of a point eq eq cq 1 ii stabilizers of a two point subset d 2 q 1 iii cq 2 q 1 c 4 iv cq 2 q 1 c 4 v suz q 0 when q q r 0 r is a prime number and q 0 is not 2 the general strategy behind the proof of prop 1 is to show on one hand since suzuki groups do not satisfy the b properties m 3 on the other hand the structure of the maximal subgroups does not allow maxdim to exceed 3 we shall prove the upper bound for maxdim by inspecting the intersections of those maximal subgroups proposition 3 q is an odd power of 2 a b are maximal subgroups of suz q the intersection i a b is 1 both a b are of type iii or iv then i is a subgroup of c 4 2 a is of type ii and b of type iii or iv then i is a subgroup of c 2 3 a is of type i and b of type iii or iv then i is a subgroup of c 4 4 both a b are of type ii then i is a subgroup of c 2 5 both a b are of type i then i is isomorphic to cq 1 6 a is of type i and b of type ii then i is isomorphic to either cq 1 or a subgroup of c 2 to prove claim 1 4 we need the following lemma proposition 4 if f cnob g cmob are distinct maximal in simple group s gcd b m gcd b n 1 then the intersection i f g is isomorphic to a common subgroup of h and h where h b and h b proof assume there is a nontrivial x cn lying inside the intersection i then x cm and vice versa because any other element in g would have order dividing b while as an element of cn the order of x cannot divide anything relatively prime to n on one hand if we assume cn is not contained in the intersection then there must be a nontrivial element z cn i since g is maximal in s s g z but z and x lie in the same cyclic group cn so z x z 1 x moreover by the cyclicity of cm x is normal in g that is to say g x g 1 x for any finite word g using z and elements in g thus x must be a proper normal subgroup of s which contradicts s being a simple group if cm is not contained in the intersection we yield the same contradiction maxdim of some simple groups 3 on the other hand if cn cm i then the normalizer of k cn cm must contain both f and g so s ns k also contradicting the simplicity of s thus the intersection i must intersect trivially with cn or cm write elements in f as ordered pairs since i intersects cn trivially for any y b there is at most 1 element x y i so the homomorphism x y 7 y is injective similarly the homomorphism x y g 7 y b is also injective i is isomorphic to a common subgroup of b and b thus since both q 1 and q 2 q 1 are odd we have that gcd q 2 q 1 4 1 implies claim 1 gcd q 1 4 gcd q 2 q 1 2 1 implies claim 2 and gcd q 1 2 1 implies claim 4 claim 3 follows from whiston s result namely since gcd 4 q 2 q 1 q 2 q 1 4 the order of the intersection must divide 4 6 however a klein four group cannot be embedded into a subgroup of type iii or iv so the intersection must be a subgroup of c 4 the intersection of two distinct point stabilizers say stab a and stab b is equivalent to the stabilizer of a in the pair stabilizer stab a b the orbit of a in stab a b is a b so by the orbit stabilizer theorem the intersection of stab a and stab b has index 2 in dihedral group stab a b d 2 q 1 thus the intersection is cyclic of order q 1 and claim 5 is proven if i is the intersection of stab a and stab u v then there are two cases if a u v then i stab u stab v cq 1 if a u v then we need the following lemma of huppert and blackburn 1 proposition 5 any nontrivial element of suz q has at most 2 fixed points that is to say the intersection of any three point stabilizer must be trivial if a u v then since stab u stab v stab a has index at most 2 in i stab a stab u v i must be a subgroup of c 2 and claim 6 holds since any subgroup of c 4 or c 2 has i 1 a length 4 list lof maximal subgroups in general position must include no subgroup of type iii or iv at most 1 subgroup of type ii and at most 3 point stabilizers since 3 fold intersection of point stabilizers is trivial they cannot coexist with another dihedral group in the list so there cannot be a such a length 4 list l that is to say 3 m maxdim 3 3 the suzuki tower the suzuki tower is a family of five simple groups psl 2 7 psu 3 3 j 2 g 2 4 suz here j 2 is the hall janko group g 2 4 is an exceptional group of lie type and suz is the sporadic suzuki group each of them act transitively on a distance transitive graph denoted by 1 to 5 respectively moreover for i 1 2 3 4 i are the local subgraphs of i 1 that is to say for any vertex v i 1 the subgraph induced by v s neighbors is i when the groups in the suzuki tower acts as automorphisms of these graphs the vertex stabilizers are isomorphic to the group one level beneath it in the tower 7 using these information and some knowledge on the structure of 1 we can give an inductive argument to bound the maxdim of these groups from below proposition 6 the maxdim of psu 3 3 j 2 g 2 4 and suz are greater or equal to 4 5 6 and 7 respectively proof as mentioned by brouwer 1 is the co heawood graph on 14 vertices which is the point line non incidence graph of the fano plane in other words it is the 4 liu tianyue and r keith dennis figure 1 heawood graph distance 3 graph of the heawood graph in figure 1 3 psl 2 7 acts on it with rank 4 and the stabilizer of a vertex v 3 e g the one labeled with a square in figure 1 is s 4 which has vertex orbit size 1 4 6 3 the 6 orbit corresponds to the vertices at distance 2 with v 3 stabilizing another point in v 3 s neighborhood those vertices labeled with circles in figure 1 gives s 3 and stabilizing a point in the 6 orbit yields the klein 4 group c 2 c 2 stabilizing 2 points in v 3 s neighborhood would result in c 2 because the one vertex stabilizer s 4 acts on the four neighbors as the permutation group s 4 notice that v 3 s neighbors are at distance 2 with each other in the co heawood graph now to bound maxdim of a suzuki tower group at level i i 1 we can pick an arbitrary vertex vi 2 first then we keep picking vertices in the common neighbor hood of previously picked vertices until the common neighborhood becomes the co heawood graph since each time we add a new point the common neighborhood induces a graph one level beneath the previous graph in the tower we should have collected i 1 vertices so far pick a vertex in the co heawood graph and denote it v 3 then pick two more vertices in v 3 s neighborhood and denote them by v 2 v 1 i claim that the point stabilizers of v 1 vi 2 in i are maximal subgroups in general position the intersection of all those point stabilizers is the same as the point wise stabilizer of v 1 v 2 and v 3 in the co heawood graph so it must be c 2 meanwhile the subgraph of i induced by v 1 vi 2 is a complete i 2 graph with one edge removed and its subgraphs induced on any i 1 vertices are complete i 1 graphs with or without an edge removed if the subgraph on i 1 vertices is a complete graph then the intersection of corresponding stabilizers is isomorphic to s 3 i e the stabilizer of a vertex and one of its neighbor in the co heawood graph otherwise the instersection of point stabilizers must be c 2 c 2 which is the point wise stabilizer of two vertices at distance 2 in the co heawood graph in either case the i 1 fold intersections contains the overall intersection properly thus by definition the i 2 point stabilizer are in general position remark 3 1 we actually can prove a stronger result here namely the lower bounds for maxdim are the lower bonds form as well let v 1 vi 2 be picked as maxdim of some simple groups 5 mentioned above and denote the two neighbors of v 3 not in the list by a and b then there are two elements in the point wise stabilizer stab v 3 vi 2 s 4 so that a 7 b b 7 v 1 v 1 7 a v 2 7 v 2 and a 7 v 2 v 2 7 a b 7 b v 1 7 v 1 and generates an s 4 which is exactly the point wise stabilizer stab v 3 vi 2 thus if we pick any 3 i 2 so that j k 6 j stab vk k stab vk then since for all j 2 stab vj vi 2 is maximal in stab vj 1 vi 2 we know that l 3 i 2 generates the entire group since sequence l certifies a list of maximal subgroups in general position it must be irredundant so we know m i 2 for the group at level i in particular since the intersection of the point stabilizers is c 2 applying a lemma of keith dennis tells us psu 3 3 and j 2 fails the replacement property remark 3 2 the lower bounds of maxdim are strict for psu 3 3 and j 2 which has been checked computationally 4 the mathieu groups in this section we give a computer aided proof for the maxdim of mathieu groups proposition 7 the maxdim of m 11 m 12 m 22 m 23 m 24 are 5 6 6 6 and 7 respectively proof maxdim for m 11 and m 12 has already been calculated by brooks 2 m 22 m 23 m 24 can be defined as automorphism groups of steiner systems a steiner system a b v is a set s on v points with a collection of subsets b called blocks so that any block in b contains exactly b points and any a points are contained in exactly one block 7 in this section we shall utilize the axioms of steiner systems to prove our claim on maxdim we know that m 24 is the automorphism group of the unique steiner 5 8 24 system and is 5 transitive on the 24 points m 23 is the stabilizer of a point in m 24 as will be shown later we can find a list of 7 point stabilizers in m 24 that are in general position if stab a 1 stab a 7 are in general position in m 24 then stab a 1 stab a 2 stab a 1 stab a 7 are in general position in stab a 1 m 23 since m 23 is 4 transitive on 23 points point stabilizers are maximal in m 23 thus stab a 1 stab a 2 stab a 1 stab a 7 is a list of maximal subgroups in general position so maxdim m 23 6 applying the same argument to m 22 the point stabilizer in m 23 we know that maxdim m 22 5 however as suggested by sophie le s computational results for m 22 there is a way to construct a longer list of maximal subgroups in general position pick 2 points a b in steiner 5 8 24 system the 22 points leftover together with the blocks that contain a b form a steiner 3 6 22 system pick 3 points 1 2 3 in the 22 points a block o 1 of s 5 8 24 that contains a b 1 2 another block o 2 that contains a b 3 and intersect the first block at only 2 points a b and a third block o 3 that contains a 1 2 3 and intersect both b 1 and b 2 at 4 point sets it turns out that m stab a stab b m 22 and m stab 1 m stab 2 m stab 3 m stab b 1 m stab b 2 m stab b 3 are maximal in m and are in general position sophie le has checked computationally thatmaxdim m 22 maxdim m 23 6 6 liu tianyue and r keith dennis in a steiner 5 8 24 system a block is termed as an octad the stabilizer of an octad in m 24 is c 4 2 a 8 where a 8 permutes the 8 points in the octad and each involution in c 42 moves all 16 points outside the octad and stabilizes the points inside the octad 5 thus we can use point stabilizers again to give a lower bound of maxdim pick an octad in the steiner system then pick 6 points a 1 a 6 inside the block and one point a 7 outside the block the stabilizers of them are then in general position we shall prove this by showing that on one hand the point wise stabilizer of the 7 points is trivial and on the other hand point wise stabilizers of any 6 points are either c 3 or c 4 2 since any five points determine a unique octad a sixth point can either sit inside or outside the octad let the stabilizer of that octad be denoted o e a where e e 16 is elementary abelian of order 16 and a a 8 is alternating on 8 points let a o a 8 be the projection onto the permutation group of points in the octad e e 16 o be the injection from the normal subgroup a a 8 o be the splitting homomorphism and the point wise stabilizer of 6 points be denoted as i if the sixth point sits inside the octad then since any involution in the normal subgroup e stabilizes the points in the octad 1 e i e 16 since the nontrivial permutation on two points is odd a i must be trivial thus i e 16 if the sixth point sits outside the octad then all involutions in e cannot be contained in i and there is a permutation p in a 8 that shuffles the three points left over in the octad since o is a split extension a p is an order 3 element in i since a i c 3 1 e i is trivial i must be isomorphic to c 3 in either case six fold intersections of point stabilizers are non trivial however if r is the intersection of all 7 point stabilizers then 1 e r a r 1 so r must be trivial thus the point stabilizers are in general position and maxdim m 24 7 to obtain an upper bound we checked computationally that all maximal sub groups of m 24 have i 6 except the dyad groups m 22 2 the octad groups c 42 a 8 and the trio groups c 62 psl 3 2 s 3 all of which have i 7 thus i m 24 8 and if there is a length 8 list l of maximal subgroups in general position then only dyad octad and trio subgroups may occur in that list the dyad subgroup is the stabilizer of a two point set i e a dyad since m 24 is 5 transitive the intersection of two dyad groups falls into two conjugacy classes if the dyads intersect then the intersection is isomorphic to psl 3 4 and if the dyads are disjoint then the intersection is isomorphic to c 52 a 5 c 2 c 2 both of them have i 5 so they cannot be in a length 8 list of maximal subgroups in general position that is in a length 8 list l there can be at most 1 dyad stabilizer in the following paragraphs the high transitivity of m 24 will be used extensively to show that beside the potential dyad stabilizer we can use at most 2 octad stabilizers and 4 trio stabilizers thus l cannot exist lemma 4 1 had there been a length 8 list l of maximal subgroups in general position then octad stabilizers can appear at most twice in l proof two distinct octads in the steiner 5 8 24 system s 5 8 24 may be disjoint or intersect at a set of size 2 or 4 any pair of octads that intersect at a 2 set are congruent to one another pair under the action of m 24 to see this we can denote the 2 point intersections in each pair a b and a b respectively the octads involved in each pair shall be denoted o 1 o 2 and o 1 o 2 then using the 5 transitivity of m 24 we can find an element 1 that sends a to a and b to b the point wise stabilizer of a and b is m 22 a group of automorphisms of maxdim of some simple groups 7 the steiner 3 6 22 system induced by fixing a b in s 5 8 24 as brouwer mentioned if we construct a m 22 graph by connecting the 6 point blocks a steiner 3 6 22 system when they are disjoint then m 22 would act edge transitively on the graph 3 that is to say since the 6 point blocks are constructed by removing a b from the 77 octads in s 5 8 24 containing a b there is an element 2 in the point wise stabilizer of a and b that maps 1 o 1 to o 1 and 1 o 2 to o 2 thus 1 2 maps one pair of octad to the other pair and it implies that stab o 1 resp stab o 2 can be mapped to stab o 1 resp stab o 2 under conjugation by 1 2 as a consequence we only need to check one pair of octad stabilizers to know the intersection of any pair stab o 1 stab o 2 where o 1 o 2 2 it turns out that the intersection is isomorphic to s 6 which has i 5 thus in l two octad stabilizers must have their octads either disjoint or intersecting at a 4 point set moreover if an octad is split into a 4 2 2 partition by the blocks of a trio i e a partition of the 24 points into 3 octads then the intersection of the octad stabilizer with the trio stabilizer is c 2 c 2 a 4 2 which has i 4 so they cannot coexist in l as in the previous case by using transitivity we only need to check one example in order to cover the entire case indeed every octad trio pair with this pattern of intersection are congruent to each other under the action of m 24 so the intersections of their stabilizers are all isomorphic this claimed can be inferred from the 2 1 1 transitivity of the trio group 5 to prove the claim denote the octad trio pairs as o t resp o t and the 3 octad blocks in t as o 1 o 2 o 3 resp o 1 through o 3 where o 1 o 4 let a 1 a 2 resp a 1 a 2 be the two points in o o 2 resp o o 2 and a 3 resp a 3 be in o o 1 resp o o 1 a 4 resp a 4 be in o o 3 resp o o 3 since all trio groups are conjugate to each other there is a 1 that maps trio t to t since a trio group acts as s 3 on its three octads there is an element 2 that maps octad 1 o 1 to o 1 and 1 o 2 to o 2 since the trio group is 2 1 1 transitive after stabilizing each octad in the trio individually there is a 3 that takes 2 1 ai to a i now we have 3 2 1 o o 2 o o 2 a 1 a 2 if 3 2 1 o o 3 o o 3 then since o o 2 o 3 a 3 determines a unique octad we have 3 2 1 o o if not then i 3 2 1 o o 3 o o 3 must have only 1 element to ensure that o 3 2 1 o is less than 5 but in that case the symmetric difference octad o o 1 would intersect 3 2 1 o in a 6 point set 3 2 1 o a 3 a 1 a 2 a 4 contradiction thus 3 2 1 o o and 3 2 1 maps the first octad trio pair to the second if three octad stabilizers are in general position then their octads cannot be mutually disjoint for by stabilizing two disjoint octads we automatically stabilize the third one thus there must be a pair of octad stabilizers intersecting at a tetrad i e 4 point set they will be denoted o 1 and o 2 in s 5 8 24 stabilizing a tetrad implies stabilizing a sextet i e a partition of the 24 points into 6 tetrads the tetrads in the sextet would be denoted as tet 1 t et 6 where tet 1 o 1 o 2 tet 2 o 1 o 2 and tet 3 o 2 o 1 adding a third octad stabilizer into the list either preserves the tetrads in the sextet or refines them however the third octad o 3 must not intersect any tetrad in odd number of points if o 3 teti 1 for some i then since whenever i 6 j teti tetj is octad and the intersection of any two distinct octads cannot have size other than 0 2 or 4 o 3 tetj 1 or 3 for all i 6 j because of the pigeon hole principal we can then consider only the case where o 3 teti 3 for some i without loss of generality if o 3 teti 3 for 8 liu tianyue and r keith dennis some i then o 3 tetj 1 for all i 6 j since we need o 3 o 1 o 3 o 2 4 i must be 1 but then we have stabilized 2 points inside and 1 point outside o 1 namely we have stabilized tet 1 o 3 tet 2 o 3 and tet 3 o 3 thus the intersection of such three octad stabilizers must be isomorphic to a subgroup of a 6 and by the flatness of alternating groups it has i 4 4 if we want the list l to have length 8 any three elements of it must have an intersection with i 5 so o 3 teti 2 or 4 for all i if the third octad o 3 splits one of the tetrads into two dyads then it must split tet 1 t et 3 as well as one more tetrad tet 4 into dyads this is because the 8 points in o 3 must be split into 4 dyads so it must intersect with o 1 o 2 since it must not intersect o 1 or o 2 in only 2 points its intersection with tet 1 t et 3 must all have size 2 moreover the sextet induced by o 3 o 1 consists of tetrads that their intersection with tet 1 t et 6 could only have size 0 or 2 let the tetrads in this sextet be denoted as tet 1 t et 6 where tet 1 o 1 o 3 tet 2 o 1 o 3 and tet 3 o 3 o 1 the tetrad containing tet 3 o 3 shall be denoted as tet 4 we know tet 4 tet 3 o 3 tet 4 o 3 because otherwise since there is an i that tet i tet 5 tet 6 tet 4 tet i tet 5 tet 6 would have cardinality 6 which is impossible therefore tet 5 tet 6 tet 5 tet 6 now we shall show that stab o 1 stab o 2 stab o 3 16 using those information pick a point p in tet 5 tet 5 and another point q in tet 4 tet 4 and denote stab p stab q stab o 1 stab o 2 stab o 3 by i under the action of stab o 1 stab o 2 stab o 3 q can only be map to the other point in tet 4 tet 4 and p can only be mapped to points in the octad tet 5 tet 6 so i must have index less than 16 in stab o 1 stab o 2 stab o 3 but i must be trivial for by stabilizing p we have stabilized all 12 dyads that are the intersections of teti tet j therefore every nontrivial element in i must be involutions since we have stabilized an octad tet 5 tet 6 i must act as an even permutation on the octad if there is a nontrivial element in i then it must permute the two points in tet 5 tet 5 or the two points in tet 5 tet 5 in fact they must permute both of them simultaneously to ensure that is an even permutation on both tet 4 tet 5 and tet 4 tet 6 as a result must stabilize the two points in tet 6 tet 6 and tet 3 tet 3 and move the points in tet 4 tet 3 but an involution in m 24 moves either 16 or 24 points 5 so must move every point in o 1 thus its action on tet 1 tet 4 is an odd permutation contradiction since i i is less than the number of prime factors in i i i 4 so we must avoid this pattern as well as a consequence if three octad stabilizers are in general position then their pairwise intersections must have cardinality 4 so o 3 is the union of two tetrads in tet 1 t et 6 we can add at most one more octad stabilizer into the list for four octad stabilizers in general position would have stabilized all six tetrads individually meanwhile we can add at most one trio stabilizer into the list this is because on one hand if the octads inside the trio are all unions of tetrads in tet 1 t et 6 then tet 5 tet 6 must be in different octads so adding that trio stabilizer stabilizes all the 6 tetrads and no more such trio stabilizers can be added on the other hand we can consider the case where one of the three octads in trio o 1 o 2 o 3 say o 1 intersect with a tetrad at a set of cardinality 2 or 3 intersecting with a tetrad at one point implies intersecting with another one at a set of cardinality 3 so without loss of generality we can omit the discussion of that case if o 1 teti 3 then to ensure the intersection of o 1 with o 1 o 2 o 3 all maxdim of some simple groups 9 have cardinality 0 or 4 we must have i 1 and tet 1 o 3 but if we denote the octad containing tet 1 o 1 as o 2 then o 2 tet 2 and o 2 tet 3 must all have cardinality 3 to ensure that o 2 o 1 o 2 o 2 4 so o 2 tet 2 tet 3 6 contradiction if o 1 teti 2 then again using the same pigeon hole argument we can infer that o 1 teti o 2 teti 2 for i 1 2 3 4 where tet 4 o 3 but then an arbitrary element in the intersection of stab o 1 stab o 2 and the trio stabilizer would not be able to move an element in o 3 outside so the three octad stabilizers and the trio stabilizer are not in general position therefore the only trio stabilizers that can be added in consist of octads that are unions of tetrads in tet 1 t et 6 thus if there are three octad stabilizers in the list l then we can add at most 1 dyad stabilizer 1 octad stabilizer and 1 trio stabilizer into the list actually at most 1 octad stabilizer or 1 trio stabilizer along with a potential dyad stabilizer which means the list has size less than 8 it then follows immediately that we can use at most two octad stabilizers in l lemma 4 2 had there been a length 8 list l of maximal subgroups in general position then trio stabilizers can appear at most 4 times in l proof let us pick a trio o 1 o 2 o 3 in the steiner system a second trio q 1 q 2 q 3 may intersect with the first trio in one of the following four ways i all of q 1 q 2 q 3 are split into 4 2 2 partitions ii q 1 q 2 are split into 4 2 2 partitions and q 3 is split into two tetrads iii all of q 1 q 2 q 3 are split into tetrads iv q 1 overlaps with o 1 and q 2 q 3 are split into tetrads in this section we shall denote a pair of trios as trio 1 o 1 o 2 o 3 t rio 2 q 1 q 2 q 3 and in the case we are discussing more than one pairs the second pair as trio 1 o 1 o 2 o 3 t rio 2 q 1 q 2 q 3 the intersection of the two trio stabilizers shall be denoted as i trio 1 t rio 2 let the type i pairs be considered the first assume without loss of generality that o i q i o i q i 4 for i 1 2 3 since o i q i can only be mapped to o j q j for i j 1 2 3 i trio 1 t rio 2 acts as a subgroup of s 3 on o i q i i 1 2 3 o i q i o j q j cannot be octads in order to ensure that q i o i o j q j o j has order less than 5 so if we find the stabilizers stab sex 1 resp stab sex 2 of the sextet containing o 1 q 1 resp o 2 q 2 then stab sex 1 stab sex 2 i trio 1 t rio 2 which is the stabilizer of each o i q i must have index less than 6 in i trio 1 t rio 2 let the tetrads in sex 1 be denoted as tet 1 t et 6 we know that teti o 2 q 2 can only be 0 1 or 2 to ensure q 1 o 1 teti o 2 2 or 4 but if there is no i that teti o 2 q 2 1 then there must be two tetrads so that teti tetj o 2 q 2 o 3 q 3 in order to ensure that o 1 q 1 teti q 2 o 1 q 1 tetj q 2 4 in that case o 2 q 2 o 3 q 3 forms an octad which is impossible thus both o 2 q 2 and o 3 q 3 are split into blocks of size 2 1 1 by tetrads in sex 1 in particular there is a tetrad tet 4 that intersect both o 2 q 2 and o 3 q 3 at 2 sets and two tetrads tet 5 t et 6 that intersect both o 2 q 2 and o 3 q 3 at a single point pick one point p tet 4 o 2 q 2 and another point q tet 5 o 2 q 2 then stab p stab q stab sex 1 stab sex 2 i trio 1 t rio 2 must be trivial for by doing so we have stabilized an octad o 2 6 points inside p q o 2 tet 4 p o 2 q 2 tet 6 o 2 tet 5 q o 2 tet 6 q 2 and 10 liu tianyue and r keith dennis one point outside say o 3 q 2 tet 5 the octad since p can only possibly be mapped to the other point in o 2 tet 4 p and q can only be mapped to the point in o 2 q 2 tet 6 by elements in stab sex 1 stab sex 2 i trio 1 t rio 2 the trivial group must have index less than or equal to 24 in i trio 1 t rio 2 but then i trio 1 t rio 2 cannot have more than 4 prime factors so i i trio 1 t rio 2 4 such a pair of trios stabilizers cannot appear in a list of length 8 a pair of trio stabilizers of type ii cannot appear either in fact if trio 1 t rio 2 and trio 1 t rio 2 are such trio pairs then we can show that i trio 1 t rio 2 is conjugate to i trio 1 t rio 2 assume without loss of generality that o 1 q 3 resp o 1 q 3 are split into two tetrads denoteo 1 q 1 o 1 q 1 q 1 o 1 q 2 o 1 as tet 1 t et 4 and their counterparts in the other pair of trios as tet 1 t et 4 those tetrads must be in the same sextet moreover the two tetrads left over in tet 1 t et 6 must split both o 2 q 3 and o 3 q 3 in to dyads pick p 1 p 4 so that p 1 q 1 o 1 tet 3 p 2 p 3 q 3 o 2 tet 5 and p 4 q 3 o 2 tet 6 pick p 1 p 4 in a similar way for the other pair of trios since all sextet stabilizers are conjugate to each other and a sextet stabilizer is transitive on the 6 tetrads there is in element m 24 that maps teti to tet i since as conway mentioned the stabilizer of every tetrad in a sextet stabilizer is still 2 1 1 0 0 0 transitive 5 there must be a that fixes each tetrad and maps pi to p i now we have q i q i and o 1 o 1 if o 2 6 o 2 then o 2 o 2 p 1 p 4 therefore o 2 o 3 q 3 1 but if we consider the sextet induced by o 3 q 3 then we know there is an octad consisting of 4 points in o 1 and the 4 points in o 3 q 3 that octad would then intersect o 2 at a single point which is not possible thus o 2 o 2 and maps the first pair of trios to the second pair checking an instance we know that in this case i trio 1 t rio 2 must be isomor phic to d 8 d 8 which has i 4 and we can therefore eliminate all trio stabilizer pairs of this type for type iii pairs we know that o 1 o 2 o 3 q 1 q 2 q 3 are all unions of tetrads in a particular sextet a third trio may either consist of unions of tetrads in that particular sextet or contain an octad intersecting one of the tetrads at a 2 point set otherwise if there is an octad intersecting a tetrad in a 1 point set or 3 point set then that octad must be partitioned into blocks of size 3 1 1 1 1 1 thus it must intersect one of the octads in trio 1 or trio 2 in a 2 point set therefore we can no longer obtain a length 8 list in the end but if the third trio contains an octad intersecting one of the tetrads at a 2 point set say tet 1 o 1 q 1 then it must intersect tet 2 o 1 q 1 t et 3 q 1 o 1 at 2 point sets let o 2 be the octad containing tet 3 and q 2 be the octad containing tet 2 then the octad in the third trio must intersect both tet 4 q 2 tet 2 t et 5 o 2 tet 3 at 2 point sets which is impossible we only have 8 points in an octad thus the third trio must consist of unions of tetrads in the sextet induced by teti that is to say the intersection of all trio stabilizers in the current list must contain the stabilizer of each individual tetrads in teti which is proven by conway to be isomorphic to c 62 c 3 if we take o i as vertices and q i as edges then we can construct a triangle by attaching an edge to two vertices if their corresponding structures satisfies q i o j o k to say that the action of i trio 1 t rio 2 on the 6 tetrads preserves the octads is just saying that it acts as automorphisms of that triangle therefore we can see that i trio 1 t rio 2 acts as s subgroup of d 6 s 3 on those tetrads and it implies that the index of c 62 c 3 in i trio 1 t rio 2 has less than maxdim of some simple groups 11 or equal to 2 prime factors thus if in our list of length 8 there are trio 1 t rio 2 of type iii then besides them we can add at most 2 more trio stabilizers into our list now we shall consider the last case that each pair of trio stabilizers in our list is of type iv let trio 1 t rio 2 be one of such a pair o 3 q 3 and the sextet induced by o 1 q 1 be denoted as teti if we introduce a third trio trio 3 r 1 r 2 r 3 then there are two cases in the first one all octads in trio 3 are unions of tetrads in teti in the second case there is an octad in trio 3 that intersect one of the tetrads at a 2 point set using the same argument as before we can ignore the case where an octad in trio 3 intersect one of the tetrads at a 1 point or 3 point set to finish our proof we shall start with the first case if o 3 q 3 r 3 then i trio 1 t rio 2 would be contained in the intersection of three trio stabilizers to see this we can use tet 1 o 1 q 1 t et 2 o 1 q 2 t et 3 o 2 q 1 t et 4 o 2 q 2 as vertices and construct an edge colored rectangle where the edges correspond to the octads containing a pair of tetrads in tet 1 t et 4 and they are colored according to whether they belong to trio 1 or trio 2 elements in i trio 1 t rio 2 are exactly those elements in m 23 that act as automorphisms of the rectangle and elements in i trio 1 t rio 2 t rio 3 are those elements preserving the diagonals as well but an automorphism of that colored triangle would automatically preserve the diagonals soi trio 1 t rio 2 i trio 1 t rio 2 t rio 3 the trio stabilizers are not in general position therefore the octad shared by trio 1 t rio 3 must be either o 1 or o 2 on the other hand the octad shared by trio 2 t rio 3 must be either q 1 or q 2 so trio 3 contains one of o 1 o 2 and one of q 1 q 2 at the same time which is impossible thus we cannot add in a trio 3 that has type iv intersections with both trio 1 and trio 2 while keeping the stabilizers in general position without letting the octads in trio 3 split the tetrads but in the second case if there is an octad r 1 intersecting one of the tetrads at a 2 point set then that octad must split one of tet 1 t et 4 into dyads since that octad is not equal to any octad in trio 1 t rio 2 all of its intersections with octads in trio 1 t rio 2 need to have 4 points so that octad must be split into 4 dyads by the 4 tetrads tet 1 t et 4 as a consequence r 3 o 3 q 3 if we want to introduce a fourth trio p 1 p 2 p 3 that follows this pattern then p 1 p 2 must split all the dyads outside p 3 o 3 q 3 r 3 for otherwise by observing the action of three fold intersections on dyads we know that the 4 fold intersection is the same as a 3 fold intersection using the same argument of inspecting the action of 4 fold intersection on the intersection of those dyads again we can show that there is no hope to introduce a trio 5 with its stabilizer in general position with the first 4 stabilizers in this case therefore we can use at most 4 trio stabilizers in the list since in our list we can use at most 1 dyad stabilizer 2 octad stabilizers and 4 trio stabilizers the length of our list cannot be 8 so maxdim m 24 7 5 the higman sims group and mclaughlin group in this section we utilize the fact that maxdim m 22 6 to give a lower bound for the maxdim of two sporadic simple groups hs and mcl proposition 8 maxdim hs 6 and maxdim mcl 6 proof both the higman sims group and the mclaughlin group can be defined in terms of automorphisms of strongly regular graphs as mentioned by brouwer 12 liu tianyue and r keith dennis the higman sims graph has a 1 22 77 construction take the points and blocks in s 3 6 22 as vertices and add in an extra vertex v connect v to all points of s 3 6 22 connect a point to a block if the point is in the block connect two blocks if they are mutually disjoint and keep points mutually unconnected then we get a strongly regular graph of parameter 100 22 0 6 which is the higman sims graph 3 a stabilizer m of vertices in hs is isomorphic tom 22 each point resp block stabilizer in m 22 then correspond to vertex stabilizers from the 22 orbit resp 77 orbit of m it turns out that if we construct s 3 6 22 from s 5 8 24 by stabilizing 2 points then all stabilizers in m 22 of those structures on s 3 6 22 induced by octads containing only one of the 2 points correspond to the intersections of m with the maximal subgroups in one of the conjugacy classes of psu 3 5 in hs 3 thus we can pick 6 maximal subgroups in general position in m as described before and lift them to 5 vertex stabilizers and a psu 3 5 in hs and the result list would be a length 6 list of maximal subgroups in general position for hs this is not the only way to find 6 maximal subgroups in general position in hs in particular if we pick 5 vertices in higman sims graph that induces a pentagon and another vertex not adjacent to any of them then their point stabilizers are in general position as mentioned by brouwer again the mclaughlin graph has a 22 77 176 con struction pick 2 points a b in steiner 5 8 24 system there are 22 points p leftover 77 octads o incident to both a b and 176 octads q incident to a but not b take p o q as vertices connect p to o if p is not in o connect p to q if p is in q connect o to o if their intersection is a b connect q to q if their intersection has 2 points and connect o to q if their intersection has size 4 then we get a strongly regular graph of parameter 275 112 30 56 which is the mclaughlin graph 3 the stabilizer of a 22 77 176 partition is a maximal subgroup m of mcl isomorphic to m 22 by the construction of the graph we can pick 3 vertices from the 22 orbit 2 vertices from the 77 orbit and 1 point from the 176 orbit such that the relation between their corresponding structures are exactly the same as those corresponding to the length 6 general position sequence in m 22 described above their stabilizers in m are therefore in general position since each vertex stabilizer in m can be lifted to a maximal subgroup in mcl we have found a list of maximal subgroups in general position so maxdim mcl 6 remark 5 1 the 176 octads q incident to a but not b resp to b but not a are the points resp quadrics in higman geometry 3 6 remarks remark 6 1 by looking at intersections of point stabilizers we can show that maxdim spn q n and maxdim un q n as brouwer pointed out the symplectic groups and unitary groups act on strongly regular graphs however this lower bound is usually not idealistic every group with maxdim m observed so far has i maxdim as well is it necessarily true for all groups with maxdim m in particular does it contradict the following conjecture of shareshian maxdim of some simple groups 13 conjecture 1 shareshian any open interval of a subgroup lattice of some finite group is has the same homotopy as a wedge of spheres references 1 n blackburn b huppert finite groups vol iii grundlehren der
