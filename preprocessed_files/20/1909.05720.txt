computable bi orderable group that does not have a computable bi ordering 2 there exists a bi orderable two generated recursively presented solvable group with undecid able word problem both of the groups can be found among two generated solvable groups of derived length 3 1 answers a question posed by downey and kurtz 2 answers a question posed by bludov and glass in kourovka notebook one of the technical tools used to obtain the main results is a computational exten sion of an embedding theorem of b neumann that was studied by the author earlier in this paper we also compliment that result and derive new corollaries that might be of independent interest 1 main results a presentationg x r of a countable group is called recursively enumerated if the setsx and r x x 1 are recursively enumerated or equivalently if the set u x x 1 u g 1 is recursively enumerated it is said that g x is a computable group with respect to the recursively enumerated generating set x if the set u x x 1 u g 1 is recursive the concept of computable groups was introduced by rabin 8 and mal cev 6 finitely generated groups that are computable with respect to a finite generating set are called groups with decidable word problem a well known property of groups with decidable 1 http arxiv org abs 1909 05720 v 2 word problem is that decidability of the word problem does not depend on the choice of finite generating set hence it is an intrinsic property of the group this is in contrast with the general case of countable groups when the property of being computable depends on the choice of the generating set to formulate the first main theorem we introduce the following definition which is a weaker form of left and bi orderings on groups definition 1 p order for a given group g we say that a binary relation on g is a p order if it is antisymmetric i e g h and h g imply g h 1 g implies g 1 1 1 g implies 1 gn for any n n if a group g possesses a p order relation then we say that g is p orderable let us recall that g is a left orderable group if there exists a liner order on g that is invariant under the left multiplication if in addition the order on g is also invariant under the right multiplication then the group g is called bi oderable note that left and bi orders on groups are p order relations definition 2 the linear order on g x is said to be computable with respect to the generating set x x 1 x 2 if the set u v x x 1 x x 1 u v is recursive our next main result is the following theorem 1 there exists a two generated bi orderable computable group that does not embed in any countable group with a computable p order relation moreover can be chosen to be a solvable group of derived length 3 the question of downey and kurtz asked in 2 as question 6 12 ii is as follows is every computable orderable group isomorphic to computably orderable group 2 for the case of left orderable groups a negative answer was recently obtained by harrison trainor in 4 however as the author mentioned in the abstract of 4 the more general case of bi orderable groups is left as open from theorem 1 we immediately get the answer to the question of downey and kurtz for the general case of bi orderable groups corollary 1 there exists a computable bi orderable group g which does not have a pre sentation with computable bi order g can be chosen to be two generated solvable group of derived length 3 in 1 bludov and glass showed that every left orderable computable group embeds into a finitely presentable left orderable group with decidable word problem the combination of these two results with theorem 1 immediately leads to yet another strengthening of the result of harrison trainor as follows corollary 2 there exists a finitely presentable left orderable group with decidable word problem without computable left order addressing the question of downey and kurtz solomon showed in 11 that for the class of abelian groups i e for solvable groups of derived length 1 the answer to the question is positive i e every bi orderable computable abelian group possesses a presentation with computable bi order this result in combination with corollary 1 leads to the following question question 1 is it true that every computable metabelian bi orderable group possesses a pre sentation with computable bi order in kourovka notebook 5 question 17 28 bludov and glass asked the following question is there a solvable left orderable group with undecidable word problem the next theorem answers this question theorem 2 there exists a two generated recursively presented bi orderable solvable group of derived length 3 with undecidable word problem 3 1 1 computability and group embeddings the main technical tool of our paper is the following embedding theorem which in a weaker form and using a slightly different language can be found in 3 and is based on a modified version of b neumann s construction from 7 theorem 3 let h x be a group with countable generating set x x 1 x 2 then there exists an embedding x h g into a two generated group g f c such that the following takes place a there exists a computable map x i 7 f 1 s 1 such that x represents the element x xi in g b if h is a solvable group of derived length l then g is a solvable group of derived length l 2 c g has a recursive presentation if and only if h has a recursive presentation with respect to the generating set x d g has decidable word problem if and only if h is computable with respect to the gener ating set x e if h is a computable group with respect to the generating set x then the membership problem for the subgroup x h g is decidable i e there exists an algorithm that for any g g decides whether or not g x h f if h is left or bi orderable then so is g and g continues the order on h moreover if with respect to the generating set x there is a computable order on h then g has a computable order as well that continues the order on h g there exist n 1 n 2 g such that x h n 1 n 2 g hence x h is a subnor mal subgroup of g remark 1 we would like to mention that the computational properties of the embedding x essentially depend on the choice of the generating set x in fact in applications in theorems 1 and 2 theorem 3 is applied on groups isomorphic to i 1 zi where zi are copies of z 4 if not particular presentations of i 1 zi then the corresponding embeddings would not lead to desired computational properties the next corollaries follow straightforwardly from theorem 3 corollary 3 a countable group h is computable if and only if it is a subnormal subgroup of a finitely generated group with decidable word problem such that the membership problem for the subgroup h is decidable in the large group corollary 4 a countable group h has a computable left or bi ordering if and only if it is a subnormal subgroup of a finitely generated group with computable left or bi order respectively such that the membership problem for the subgroup h is decidable in the large group moreover for any fixed computable order on h we can assume that the large group continues the order on h remark 2 for a group h both the properties of being computable and having computable left or bi orders depends on the presentation of the group one of the noteworthy aspects of corollaries 3 and 4 is that they reformulate these computability properties for h in terms that do not depend on the presentation of the group 2 proof of theorem 1 lemma 2 1 let g be a finitely generated group with decidable word problem then g has a presentation with computable p left or bi order if and only if that order is computable with respect to any finite generating set proof let us assume that g x x x 11 x 1 2 such that for a given p left or bi order g on g the set u v x x u g v is recursive then by corollary 4 there exists a two generated group h a b such that g h h has order h that continues the order g and is computable and the membership problem for g h is decidable now let us assume that g is also generated by a finite set s s 11 s 1 n let u 1 u 2 un a 1 b 1 be such that they represent the elements s 1 sn in g let s x be the map induces by s 1 7 u 1 sn 7 un then for any w 1 w 2 s 5 w 1 g w 2 is equivalent to w 1 h w 2 therefore since h is a computable order we get that u v s s u g v is recursive as well since s is an arbitrarily chosen generating set one direction of the lemma is proved the other direction is trivial lemma 2 2 if a finitely generated group has a computable p order then the induced p order on any finitely generated subgroup is also computable proof indeed let g s be a finitely generated group with a computable p order relation g i e the set u s s 1 1 g u is recursive let h x g x be a finitely generated subgroup of g with the induced p order relation h i e for h 1 h 2 h h 1 h h 2 if and only if h 1 g h 2 then h is a computable relation with respect to the generating set x because every word w x x 1 can be computably rewritten as a word v s s 1 such that w and v represent the same element of h the last observation means that recursiveness of u s s 1 1 g u implies recursiveness of u x x 1 1 h u let us fix a recursively enumerable and recursively inseparable pair m n of subsets of n for the existence of such a pair see 10 9 let m m 1 m 2 and n n 1 n 2 such that the enumerations are recursive let p p 1 p 2 be the set of primes listed in its natural order now let us consider the abelian group a i 1 zi given by the presentation a ai i 1 2 ai aj 1 a 2 ni a pi 2 ni 1 a 2 mi a pi 2 mi 1 i j n 1 lemma 2 3 the presentation 1 is computable proof indeed any element of a can be presented as a finite length word in the alphabet a 11 a 2 2 which on its own turn can be computationally transformed into another reduced word representing the same element which is of the form a 1 i 1 a 2 i 2 a n in 2 where i 1 if this word is not empty and it represents the trivial element then it must contain a subword of one of the following forms a 2 nia pi 2 ni 1 1 or a 2 mia pi 2 mi 1 1 since the set of primes is recursive and m and n are recursively enumerated the set of subwords 6 a 2 nia pi 2 ni 1 1 a 2 mia pi 2 mi 1 1 i n is recursive hence they can be computationally detected therefore in order to check whether or not a word of the form 2 represents a trivial element of the group a we can simply find the mentioned subwords and remove them until this procedure can not be continued since it is a computable procedure the presentation 1 is computable now let g be the group obtained after embedding the group a into a two generated group according to the embedding from theorem 3 we consider the embedding with respect to the presentation 1 let the embedding be a g by the properties of the embedding of theorem 3 g x 1 y 1 will have decidable word problem part d will be bi orderable part f and will be solvable of derived length 3 part b however below we show that g does not possess any computable p order with respect to any presentation first note that by lemma 2 1 if g is a computable preorder on g with respect to some presentation then it is a computable p order with respect to the generating set x 1 y 1 i e the set o u v x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 u g v is recursive it follows from part a of theorem 3 that there exist a computable map n x 1 y 1 such that i ui x 1 y 1 is a word representing the element ai g therefore the set l n n u 2 n g 1 u 2 n 1 g 1 or 1 g u 2 n 1 g u 2 n 1 is recursive as well however since g is a p order relation we have that n l and m l we get to a contradiction with the assumption that the pair m n is recur sively inseparable therefore g does not possess a computable p order with respect to any presentation now let us show that the group g cannot be embedded into a countable group with a presentation possessing a computable p order indeed by contradiction assume that h is a countable group with a computable preorder h in which g is embedded it follows from theorem 3 and lemma 2 1 that without loss of generality we can assume that h is 7 finitely generated and the computability of h is with respect to any finite generating set however since g does not have any computable p order by lemma 2 2 we immediately reach a contradiction 3 proof of theorem 2 let us fix a recursively enumerated non recursive set n n 1 n 2 let us consider the following presentation of the group i 1 zi a ai i 1 2 ai aj 1 a 2 ni a 2 ni 1 i j n 3 since n is recursively enumerable the presentation 3 is recursive however since a 2 n a 2 n 1 is equivalent to n n and n is not recursive we get that 3 is not computable now let a be embedded into a two generated group g according to theorem 3 then g is solvable of derived length 3 and is bi orderable by part c of theorem 3 g is recursively presentable by part d the word problem in g is undecidable 4 proof of theorem 3 the proof of theorem 3 uses the embedding construction described in 3 moreover the proof is in a way a commentary on the proof of the main theorem from 3 there are also differences in notations compared with the exposition from 3 for example the embedding x described below is the embedding from 3 the map f defined below is c in 3 fi is b i etc let us recall the definition of wreath product given two groups a and b the base subgroup ab is the set of functions from b to a with pointwise multiplication and the group b acts on ab from the left by automorphisms such that for f ab and b b the resulting function bf is given by bf x f xb x b for the convenience we will denote bf by f b definition 4 1 the wreath product awrb is defined as a semidirect product ab b with the multiplication f 1 b 1 f 2 b 2 f 1 f b 1 2 b 1 b 2 for all f 1 f 2 a b b 1 b 2 b 8 let h x where x x 1 x 2 be the initial group in order to construct the group from g of theorem 3 first we will describe an embedding of the group h into a subgroup l of the full wreath product h z where z is an infinite cyclic group generated by z as follows define the functions fi z h i 1 2 as fi z n xi if n 0 1 otherwise note that z fi z n zfiz 1 f 1 i z n xi if n 0 1 otherwise 4 denote l z f 1 f 2 h z since xi 7 fi i n embeds h into l we can conclude with the following observation 4 1 the group l is computable with respect to the generating set z f 1 f 2 h z if and only if h had decidable word problem if we regard the maps fi z h as elements of the wreath product h z then it follows from 4 that the following observation takes place observation 4 2 the map xi 7 z fi i n induces an isomorphism between h and z fi i n l the next step is to embed the group l into a two generated subgroup g f s of the full wreath product l s h z s where s is another infinite cyclic group generated by s as follows define the function f s l as f sn z if n 1 fi if n 2 i i n 1 otherwise then f f s 2 i 1 sn ff s 2 i 1 f 1 f s 2 i 1 sn z fi if n 1 1 otherwise 9 therefore by observation 4 2 the map xi 7 f f s 2 i 1 induces an embedding of the group h into g f s l s thereby we are ready to define the embedding x h g as the one induced by the map xi 7 f f s 2 i 1 i n since this map is computable it implies part a of theorem 3 also part b of theorem 3 follows from the observation that g is a subgroup of h z s note that the final group g depends on the initial choice and enumeration of the gener ating set of h this property is of essential importance for our applications as the initial group h that we consider in applications is isomorphic to i zi and only for its particular presentation it leads to the desirable computational properties for the end group g note that every word w from f 1 s 1 can be computationally rewritten in the form w f s 1 1 f s 2 2 f s n ns 5 where i i i 1 n are some integers such that w represents the same element of g as w lemma 4 1 lemma 4 3 the word w from 5 represents the trivial element in g if and only if the following conditions take place 0 f s 1 1 f s 2 2 f s n n regarded as a map s l takes trivial values on each point s where ranges from 3 max 1 n to 3 max 1 n j bi j 0 for i 1 n where bi k 1 n j i note that for each z f s s l is computable because for every z we have f s s f s s f i if 2 i i n z if 1 1 otherwise therefore lemma 4 1 implies that the word problem in g can be computationally reduced to the computability property of the group l with respect to the generating set z f 1 f 2 this observation combined with observation 4 1 implies part d of theorem 3 moreover it 10 implies that if g has recursive presentation then so does l with respect to l z f 1 f 2 hence by observation 4 1 also h with respect to x combined with the fact that x is a computable map it also implies the inverse thus part c of theorem 3 is confirmed as well proof of part e of theorem 3 is based on the following two lemmas from 3 we refer to 3 for more details lemma 4 2 lemma 6 3 the word w from 5 represents an element from x h if and only if 0 f s 1 1 f s 2 2 f s n n regarded as a map s l takes trivial values on each point s where 6 1 and ranges from 3 max 1 n to 3 max 1 n j bi j 0 for i 1 n where bi k 1 n j i and f s 1 1 f s 2 2 f s n n s z fi i n lemma 4 3 lemma 7 3 f fz 1 1 1 fz 2 2 2 fz m m mz l belongs to z fi i n l if and only if 0 and f z 1 f z 2 f z 0 1 where 0 max 1 m part f of theorem 3 is a direct consequence of the following lemma lemma 4 4 let k be a finitely generated subgroup of a wreath product a b of two left or bi orderable groups such that for each f ab and b b fb k implies that supp f is well orderable with respect to an order on b then the group k is correspondingly left or bi orderable moreover if k has decidable word problem a and b possess computable orders a and b respectively and the set f 1 b f 2 b k k f 1 x 0 a f 2 x 0 x 0 min x supp f 1 f 1 2 is recursive then k has a computable order 11 proof define f 1 b 1 k f 2 b 2 if either b 1 b b 2 or b 1 b 2 and f 1 6 f 2 and f 1 x 0 a f 2 x 0 where x 0 min x supp f 1 f 1 2 it is straightforward to show that the order k is a bi order in case a and b are bi orders on a and b respectively see 7 for details the case for left orders can be shown identically proof of the second statement as for the first part define f 1 b 1 k f 2 b 2 if either b 1 b b 2 or b 1 b 2 and f 1 6 f 2 and f 1 x 0 a f 2 x 0 where x 0 min x supp f 1 f 1 2 therefore since k and b are computable and by our assumption f 1 b f 2 b k k f 1 x 0 a f 2 x 0 x 0 min x supp f 1 f 1 2 is recursive we get that k is a computable order now part f of theorem 3 follows from lemma 4 4 and the observation that the groups l h z and correspondingly g f s l s satisfy the assumptions from lemma 4 4 finally for part e of theorem 3 note that we have x h f f s 2 i 1 i n f f jf s 2 i 1 f j i j n f s i i n f s g therefore one can take n 1 f f jf s 2 i 1 f j i j n and n 2 f s i i n acknowledgements i would like to thank markus steenbock for many motivating conver sations the paper was written during my
