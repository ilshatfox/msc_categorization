transitive permutation group a fundamental object for studying its higher transitivity properties is the permutation action of its isotropy subgroup we reverse this relationship and introduce a universal construction of infinite permutation groups that takes as input a given system of imprimitivity for its isotropy subgroup this produces vast families of kaleidoscopic groups we investigate their algebraic properties such as simplicity and oligomorphy their ho mological properties such as acyclicity or contrariwise large schur mul tipliers their topological properties such as unique polishability our construction is carried out within the framework of homeomor phism groups of topological dendrites 1 introduction ces effets de prisme se modifient l infini suivant la place que l on occupe ne vous semble t il pas que nous sommes pench s sur l ouverture d un immense kal idoscope jules verne le pays des fourrures consider an arbitrary permutation group sym n of a finite or countable set of n elements where 3 n from this data we con struct canonically a primitive permutation group of an infinite countable set the kaleidoscopic group k this construction is particularly well suited to explore the worlds that open up between primitivity and double primitivity for instance k is often doubly transitive but never triply transitive the principle behind this exploration is that the functor 7 k shifts the attention one level deeper into the action namely to the action of a point stabilizer k x upon the complement of that point x more pre cisely the construction is such that k x admits a system of imprimitivity isomorphic to the initial permutation group here are a first few properties of the functor 7 k defined in this text date january 2018 b d is supported in part by french projects anr 14 ce 25 0004 gamme and anr 16 ce 40 0022 01 agira 1 http arxiv org abs 1801 09787 v 1 2 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek theorem 1 1 i the abstract group k is simple and uniformly perfect ii the permutation group k is always primitive it is doubly transitive if and only if is transitive iii the permutation group k is never doubly primitive its point stabilizers admit a system of imprimitivity isomorphic to and decompose as permuta tional wreath product over remark 1 2 in i uniform perfectness means that every element is the product of a uniformly bounded number of commutators we shall show that this number can be taken to be 3 in order to appreciate the diversity of kaleidoscopic groups it is natural to ask how much k depends upon this question can be asked for the permutation groups or for the underlying abstract groups an interme diate level is to consider the groups endowed with the polish topology of pointwise convergence we obtain the strongest possible answer under a discreteness assump tion on which is a void assumption unless n theorem 1 3 suppose that the groups sym n and sym n are discrete which is automatic when n n then k and k are non isomorphic even as abstract groups unless n n and as permutation groups in particular even the trivial group 1 gives rise to countably many non isomorphic simple primitive permutation groups k 1 y n where n 0 n 1 another family of examples is the regular permutation group y associated to an arbitrary countable group this produces a continuum of non isomorphic kaleidoscopic groups of very high descriptive complexity by 25 our kaleidoscopic groups are constructed as homeomorphisms of den drites that is of locally connected continua containing no simple closed curve these topological spaces arise naturally in many contexts for in stance some appear as julia sets 19 4 or as a realization of a berkovich line 15 a general dendrite x contains three types of points x x accord ing to the number of components of the complement x x this number is at most countable and coincides with the menger urysohn order of x in x if the complement x x remains connected x is an end if x separates x into two components it is a regular point otherwise x belongs to the set br x of branch points kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 3 the set of branch points is at most countable and provides us with a natural representation homeo x sym br x into the polish group of permutations of br x when x has no free arcs i e when br x is arc wise dense in x this representation is a topological group isomorphism onto its image see 10 2 4 we shall focus on certain universal dendrites dn namely the waz ewski dendrite of order 3 n this dendrite is characterized up to homeo morphism by the following properties dn is not reduced to a single point every branch point of dn has order n dn has no free arcs consider now an arbitrary subgroup g homeo dn on the one hand g is a permutation group of the countable set br dn on the other hand for any x br dn the stabilizer gx projects to a permutation group gx of the n element set of components x 0 dn x in particular provided the permutation group g is transitive on branch points the permutation groups gx x as x br dn varies are isomor phic so g determines a well defined isomorphism type of a permutation group sym n one thus obtains a functor which produces from a branch point transitive g homeo dn a permutation group n the permutation group n is called the local action of g the kaleidoscopic construction aims at reversing the functor g 7 n thus we start with a permutation group of the set n we seek a canon ical subgroup k homeo dn up to conjugation whose stabilizers k x act on x like acts on n this requires an identification of each x with n that is a coloring given a coloring we can define a subgroup of homeo dn by postulating that the coloring is only locally changed by ele ments of in close analogy to the definition proposed by burger mozes 2 for tree automorphisms in order for this construction to be well defined and canonical it turns out that we cannot use just any coloring we shall need kaleidoscopic col orings defined by the following requirement given any two points x 6 y and any two colors i 6 j there is a branch point separating x from y at which the component of x has color i and the component of y has color j we shall prove that kaleidoscopic colorings are unique up to homeomor phisms which ensures that k is well defined as an isomorphism type of permutation groups it may not be obvious at first that kaleidoscopic colorings exist at all but in fact much more is true we shall see that they form a dense g in the space of all colorings this makes the construction generic and hence canonical 4 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek we now turn to further properties of the kaleidoscopic functor 7 k recall that a permutation group is oligomorphic if for all k n the diago nal action on k tuples has finitely many orbits this condition is of course automatic for sym n if n but it is a very interesting property for infinite permutation groups 3 such as for instance k theorem 1 4 the permutation group k is oligomorphic if and only if is oligomorphic we have already stated that k is always a perfect group equiva lently that the homology h 1 k z vanishes this raises the question of higher homological finiteness properties starting with the schur mul tiplier h 2 k z interestingly the situation now depends on for instance the full symmetric group sym corresponds to k homeo d and the latter has no homology at all theorem 1 5 the group homeo d is acyclic that is the homology groups hn homeo d z vanish for all n 0 in contrast there are many situations where k has a non trivial schur multiplier following p neumann 22 a permutation group is called gen erously transitive if it can transpose any pair of points we shall further say that an action is semi generous if it decomposes into two orthogonal orbits that are both generously transitive recalling that two actions are or thogonal if the diagonal action on the product is transitive as soon as we are not in these situations we obtain non trivial cohomol ogy h 2 and indeed also non trivial bounded cohomology h 2 b theorem 1 6 suppose that the permutation group is neither generous nor semi generous then k admits a cocycle which determines a non trivial class in h 2 k z and in h 2 b k z moreover these classes remain non trivial when viewed as r valued cohomology classes this shows that kaleidoscopic groups despite their dendritic nature should not be considered as one dimensional objects in any strict sense since k is perfect the universal coefficient theorem allows us to de duce that the schur multiplier is often non trivial corollary 1 7 suppose that the permutation group is neither generous nor semi generous then the schur multiplier h 2 k z is non trivial indeed non torsion furthermore in the particular case of trivial local actions we obtain kalei doscopic groups with large schur multipliers the case n of the next statement is in stark contrast to the acyclicity result of theorem 1 5 corollary 1 8 the schur multiplier of the kaleidoscopic group k 1 y n has rank at least n 1 n 2 2 kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 5 we shall see in section 9 that the restriction on semi generosity in the orem 1 6 is in fact the exact condition needed for our method of proof to work when n however when n we will give an example of a generously transitive permutation group whose associated kaleidoscopic group has non trivial schur multiplier providing even more contrast to the acyclicity of theorem 1 5 we exhibit in corollary 9 13 a kaleidoscopic group with non trivial homology in every even degree as mentioned above there is a natural topology on the group k since it is constructed as a subgroup of the polish group sym br x this topology turns k into a polish group exactly when it is closed we know precisely when the latter happens theorem 1 9 the group k is closed in sym br x if and only if is closed in sym n which is automatic when n there are moreover many cases where this is the only possible structure of a polish group on the abstract group k theorem 1 10 if is discrete in sym n then there is a unique topology on k for which it is a polish group the discreteness assumption is automatic when n and it is also satisfied for example in the continuum of examples arising from regular actions y as mentioned above reflecting again the similarity with the groups constructed by burger mozes 2 we also obtain a universal property under the strong but neces sary hypothesis of double transitivity theorem 1 11 for 3 n let g homeo dn be a subgroup which is transitive on branch points and y n be the isomorphism type of its local action if is doubly transitive then g is contained in k for a suitable kaleidoscopic coloring location of the proofs theorem 1 1 is a patchwork simplicity is proved in theorem 6 3 and uniform perfectness in theorem 6 4 transitivity prop erties can be found in corollary 5 6 and theorem 5 7 the wreath product structure of stabilizers is recorded in corollary 7 5 regarding non isomorphisms theorem 1 3 is ensured by theorem 7 10 the characterization of oligomorphy is theorem 5 9 all non vanishing results for co homology are in section 9 the acyclicity of homeo d is theorem 10 1 the characterization of polishness of k is proposi tion 5 3 the uniqueness of the topology is proved in theorem 7 6 univer sality of k is

abusively denotes both the first infinite ordinal and its cardinal for n n we set n m n m n and define sym n to be the symmetric group of n endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence this topology is discrete when n 6 we further write n k n n n k when k n for any set x and k n we denote by x k xk the subset of distinct k tuples given a group g acting on a set x and y x we write g y for the pointwise stabilizer of y in g 2 b background on dendrites a topological space x is called a dendrite if it is a locally connected continuum containing no simple closed curve a variety of other equivalent characterizations can be found in 21 10 to which we refer for detailed background a fundamental property of dendrites is that the intersection of any two connected subsets of x remains connected it follows that every non empty subset y x is contained in a unique minimal closed connected subset of x this subset is itself a dendrite and we denote it by y when y contains just two points x y we also write x y for this sub dendrite which is a topological arc unless x y any two distinct points of x are thus joined by a unique arc and we write x y for x y x y when no confusion with the pair x y is to be feared that points are connected by unique arcs gives rise to a canonical ternary relation b x y z defined by b x y z y x z the relation b x y z is called the betweeness relation equivalently we say that y separates x and z given a point x in a dendrite x we use the shorthand x 0 x x kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 7 for the space of components of the complement of x this is always an at most countable set and its cardinal coincides with the menger urysohn or der of x in x the point x is called an end point a regular point or a branch point according to whether this order is one two or at least three the cor responding subsets of x are denoted respectively by ends x reg x and br x the set br x is at most countable when x is not reduced to a point the set reg x is arc wise dense and we have x ends x for any x 6 y in x we denote by ux y the component of x that contains y one can organise the union of all x into a bundle over x see 7 in 9 but we shall be more interested here in the branch bundle x of x defined to be the union of all x when x ranges over the branch points of x only that is x x br x x the set x is countable and we shall not endow it with any topology since the smallest sub dendrite containing a finite union of points or arcs is the topological realization of a finite tree a number of familiar combinatorial concepts and arguments can be adapted to such finite col lections for a finite set f d we say that distinct f g f are adjacent if f g f given any three distinct points x y z x we define the center x y z of x y z as the unique point in x y y z z x a subset of x will be called center closed if it contains the center of any three distinct points in it the following lemma can be immediately reduced to a corresponding statement about finite trees which is elementary lemma 2 1 let f x be a finite subset and let c be the collection of the centers of all triples of distinct points in f then the finite set f c is center closed given a sub dendrite y x there exists a canonical continuous retrac tion r x y called the first point map satisfying r x x y r x for all x x lemma 2 2 if y f for a non empty compact subset f br x then r x br x for all x y proof since y is itself a dendrite we can consider ends y we have that ends y f by 9 lemma 2 3 applied to y and hence ends y br x it remains only to consider the case where r x lies inside an arc of y and we conclude that it is a branch point of x since r x x y r x 2 c patchwork one reason for the flexibility of dendrite groups is that it is possible to patch together homeomorphisms an example of such a state ment is 10 lemma 2 9 and we shall need the following strengthening of that lemma lemma 2 3 let u be a family of disjoint open subsets of a dendrite x for each u u let fu be a homeomorphism of x which is the identity outside u then 8 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek the map f x x given by fu on each u u and the identity elsewhere is a homeomorphism since lemma 2 3 does not seem to reduce immediately to 10 lemma 2 9 which assumes the sets u are connected we give a full proof proof since f is well defined and bijective it suffices to prove sequential continuity suppose for a contradiction that there is a sequence xn converg ing to some x with f xn not converging to f x by extracting we can assume that f xn converges to some y 6 f x we can further assume that each xn belongs to some un u since otherwise y x f x each u u contains xn for at most finitely many indices n since otherwise y fu x f x in particular x cannot belong to any u and thus it is fixed by all fu the same reasoning shows that y is also fixed by all fu and thus the arc x y is preserved by all fu in particular the first point map r x x y is fu equivariant we define x n r xn and y n r f xn and note that these sequences converge to x and y respectively let z be any point separating x and y since the various u u are disjoint we have z un when n is large enough thus z is fun fixed for such n we have moreover x n x z and y n z y for n large using equivariance we have fun x x n x y n this however is impossible since the latter arc contains the fixed point z but the former does not 2 d universal dendrites for every n n 3 there exists a dendrite dn the waz ewski dendrite of order n with the following properties a dn is not reduced to a single point b every branch point of dn has order n and c br dn is arc wise dense in dn these properties determine dn uniquely up to homeomorphisms and moreover dn is universal in the sense that every dendrite whose points all have order n can be embedded into dn we refer again to 21 10 the original construction of d is due to waz ewski 27 28 the uniqueness of dn is proved in a more general setting in 7 6 2 the topology of the homeomorphism group of waz ewski dendrites is given by the permutation topology on branch points indeed the map homeo dn sym br dn is a topological group isomorphism onto its image see 10 proposition 2 4 we shall often appeal to this fact implicitly as a consequence we can obtain homeomorphisms between sub dendrites of dn by considering branch points recall that for any dendrite x the be tweeness relation b x y z holds if and only if y x z observe that a dendrite has no free arc if and only if any two distinct points are separated by some branch point proposition 2 4 let x y be dendrites without free arc if g br x br y is a bijection that preserves the betweeness relation then there is a homeomorphism h x y extending g kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 9 proof given b br x we have an equivalence relation on br x b by declaring that points not separated by b are equivalent in other words the equivalence classes are the sets of branch points in some connected component of x b since g preserves the betweeness relation it in tertwines this relation with the corresponding relation induced by g b on br y g b this allows us to define a map g x y this map is a bijection and its restriction to b is also a bijection onto g b now for x x we define h x c g c where c ranges over all components c x that contain x by compactness this intersection is non empty as soon as any finite sub intersection is non empty this is the case because if c 1 cn contain x they also contain some branch point b and thus g c 1 g cn contains g b moreover this intersection is reduced to a point because any two distinct points are separated by some branch point the map h x y is thus well defined and by construction coincides with g on br x it has an inverse namely the map constructed in the same way with respect to g 1 it remains to show that h is continuous or equivalently open by con struction it maps connected components of complement of points to con nected components of complement of points since these open sets gener ate the topology 10 2 10 we conclude that h is open 3 defining kaleidoscopic groups 3 a colorings definition 3 1 a coloring of the dendrite dn is a map c d n n such that the restriction c x at any branch point x br dn is a bijection c x x n we define cx x x n by cx y c ux y where ux y is the element of x that contains y we often abuse notation and also write cx for c x since cx is constant on the components x under the product topology n d n is a polish space since d n is count able the set of colorings c n d n is easily verified to be a g set so that it is a polish space under the subspace topology see for instance 16 thm 3 11 when n is finite c is in fact closed definition 3 2 a coloring of dn is kaleidoscopic if for all distinct x y br dn and all distinct i j n there is z x y br dn such that cz x i and cz y j in the following picture open alcoves depict the two components uz x and uz y respectively colored with i and j 10 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek z x y i j it is not immediately obvious that kaleidoscopic colorings exist but much more is in fact true they are generic proposition 3 3 for any n n 3 the set of kaleidoscopic colorings is a dense g in the space of all colorings proof since the set of branch points is countable it suffices by baire s the orem to show that for any branch points x 6 y and colors i 6 j the set of colorings for which there is z such that cz x i and cz y j is open and dense it is open because for every z in x y br dn the conditions cz x i and cz y j are open by definition of the pointwise conver gence topology the density follows from the fact that the set x y br dn is infinite we now argue that all kaleidoscopic colorings differ by an element of homeo dn seeing g homeo dn as acting on d n we prove the follow ing stronger statement because it will be needed later in this text theorem 3 4 let n n 3 x y be dendrites homeomorphic to dn and c and d be kaleidoscopic colorings of x and y respectively then there exists a homeomor phism h x y such that d h c furthermore let e 0 e 1 x be distinct end points and likewise f 0 f 1 y let x e 0 e 1 and y f 0 f 1 be branch points with cx ei dy fi for i 0 1 then h can be chosen such that h ei fi for i 0 1 and such that h x y the proof will use the back and forth technique similar to 7 6 2 we start by recording the following classical example of this technique con tained in 7 lemma 6 1 lemma 3 5 let aj bj be sequences of countable dense subsets of the interval 0 1 where j ranges over a finite or countable index set suppose that all aj are pairwise disjoint and likewise for the bj then there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism g of 0 1 such that g aj bj for all j given any distinct points x x in a dendrite homeomorphic to dn a col oring c defines a partition of the set of branch points z in x x according to the pair of values cz x cz x if c is kaleidoscopic then each block of this partition is dense in the arc x x moreover the value cz remains constant on z x and on z x therefore lemma 3 5 implies the follow ing lemma 3 6 let x y c and d be as in theorem 3 4 given any distinct x x x and distinct y y y there is a homeomorphism g x x y y with g x kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 11 y sending x x br x onto y y br y and such that dg z g t cz t holds for all z x x br x and all t x x z proof of theorem 3 4 we shall construct inductively two increasing sequences of sub dendrites xm x and ym y and homeomorphisms gm xm ym such that gm 1 extends gm such that gm maps xm br x onto ym br y and such that d gm c on xm first extend e 0 e 1 and f 0 f 1 to dense sequences ei i n in ends x and fi i n in ends y recall that the end points are dense in dn 6 2 3 for the base case m 0 let x 0 x y 0 y and g 0 x 7 y the inductive step when xm ym and gm are already constructed de pends on the parity of m we start with m even let j 0 be the small est index for which ej xm and define xm 1 xm ej the image xm of ej under the first point retraction x xm is a branch point of x since by construction all xm are spanned by x and end points the image ym gm xm is thus a branch point of y as well by the induction hypoth esis the color at x of elements of xm coincides with the corresponding color at y of their image in ym therefore since ej has a color not seen in xm from x there is a component at y not meeting ym of that same color by density of fi i n we can choose an index j with f j in that component we define ym 1 ym f j and extend gm to a homeomorphism gm 1 by applying lemma 3 6 to the arcs xm ej and ym f j notice that gm 1 does indeed preserve the colorings on the whole of xm 1 and ym 1 for instance the color of any element of xm seen from a branch point in xm ej is simply the color of xm the case of m odd is identical after exchanging x with y and replacing gm by its inverse the inductive construction is complete the increasing union of all xm contains in particular the entire sequence ei i n thanks to all even steps this implies that it contains all branch points of x the corresponding statement holds for the union of all ym therefore proposition 2 4 shows that the bijection g between these unions obtained from the maps gm extends to a homeomorphism h with the de sired properties 3 b kaleidoscopic groups definition 3 7 let c be a coloring of dn the local action of g homeo dn at x br dn is the element c g x of sym n defined by the cocycle c homeo dn br dn sym n c g x cg x g c 1 x wherein g is considered both as a map on dn and on d n in particular we record the corresponding cocycle properties for g h homeo dn and x br dn c gh x c g hx c h x and c g x 1 c g 1 g x 12 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek definition 3 8 let c be a coloring of dn for n n 3 for any permutation group sym n the group with local action is defined to be kc g homeo dn x br dn c g x when c is a kaleidoscopic coloring we call kc a kaleidoscopic group with local action we emphasize that this construction depends on as a permutation group of n rather than as an abstract group for instance the special case of the trivial group 1 is far from trivial as will be seen below note that kc 1 is exactly the subgroup of homeo dn that preserves the color ing and kc sym n is actually homeo dn when necessary we shall highlight the fact that stands for a permutation group by using notations such as kc y n for instance kc 1 y n the group kc also depends on the coloring c but for kaleidoscopic colorings the dependence disappears as demonstrated by the following consequence of theorem 3 4 corollary 3 9 for dn with n n 3 and sym n if c and d are kalei doscopic colorings of dn then kc and kd are conjugate by an element of homeo dn the isomorphism type of a kaleidoscopic group and of its action on the dendrite is thus independent of the choice of a kaleidoscopic coloring we therefore suppress the subscript and simply write k we stress that whenever we write k we mean the group kd for some kalei doscopic coloring d when we consider the local action for an element g k at some x br dn we also suppress the coloring and sim ply write g x proof of corollary 3 9 by theorem 3 4 we may find h homeo dn such that d h c consider hgh 1 hkc h 1 we see that d hgh 1 h v dhg v hgh 1 d 1 h v d h g v g d h 1 v cg v g c 1 v writing out the commutative diagram makes the previous equalities clear since c g v we deduce that d hgh 1 h v therefore hkc h 1 kd the converse inclusion follows by the same argument using that c h 1 d remark 3 10 let s n 3 one can define analogously colorings c of waz ewski dendrites ds by coloring connected components around a point of order n s with colors in n by fixing a local group n for each n s we can define also a group kc n n s such that for any point x of order kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 13 n c g x n we will not investigate this more general setting in the present text 4 assembling homeomorphisms in this section we show how to use theorem 3 4 to build homeomor phisms of dn while simultaneously controlling the local action 4 a colorful patchwork our first result gives sufficient conditions under which a family of homeomorphisms between subsets of a dendrite may be patched together into a homeomorphism of the dendrite our primary result here is a mild adaption of 10 lemma 2 9 suppose that d is a dendrite and f d is finite and center closed for each a f let a f c a c f for a b d distinct set ca b ua b ub a definition 4 1 the set f a f a f cx y x y f adjacent is called the set of components determined by f each element of f is a path connected open subset of d and is disjoint from f less trivially f is exactly the collection of connected components of d f we are now prepared to prove the desired patchwork lemma this result follows similarly to 10 lemma 2 9 we give a proof for completeness definition 4 2 for r and s finite subsets of a dendrite and f r s a bijection we say that f is a partial dendrite morphism if f respects be tweeness and f carries branch points to branch points regular points to regular points and end points to end points lemma 4 3 cf 10 lemma 2 9 for d a dendrite suppose that r and s are finite center closed subsets of d and f r s is a partial dendrite morphism suppose further the following a for each a r there is a homeomorphism ha a r b s such that b s and ha r f and b every b s equals im ha s for some unique a r then the map h d d defined by h x ha x when x a r with a r is a homeomorphism of d such that h r f proof the map h is a well defined bijection since r r is a partition it thus suffices to show that h is continuous fix a compatible metric d for d and suppose that xj x if infinitely many terms xnj of the sequence lie in some a r then x a a r as a is open a tail of the sequence lies in a for suitably large n we thus have h xn ha xn and furthermore ha xn ha x h x we conclude that h xn h x let us then suppose that each a r contains only finitely many terms of the sequence xj j n it follows that x f let ai i n list r and 14 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek bi i n list s say that hi ai r bi s and take min d x f f f x fix 0 2 we recall the diameter of any sequence of disjoint connected subsets of a dendrite must tend to zero see e g 29 v 2 6 thus there is n such that diam ai diam bi for all i n taking n perhaps larger we may also assume that d xj x for all j n since each ai only contains finitely many terms of the sequence xj j n we may find m n such that xj ai j for some i j n for every j m for any a r such that x a d a x so we additionally have that x ai j for every j m since hi j is homeomorphism h x hi j x lies in bi j therefore d h xj h x diam bi j for all j m we deduce that h xj h x the map h is thus continuous 4 b back and forth all over again to produce the homeomorphisms be tween connected components required for lemma 4 3 we can rely on the orem 3 4 as follows corollary 4 4 let c be a kaleidoscopic coloring of dn for some n n 3 choose a b dn and components a a b b then there is a homeomorphism g a a b b such that for all x a br dn and z a a distinct cx z cg x g z holds proof the characterization of dn up to homeomorphisms recalled in sec tion 2 d shows that both a a and b b are homeomorphic to dn moreover a is an end of a a and b is an end of b b therefore the statement follows from theorem 3 4 given two points a b of a dendrite recall that ca b denotes ua b ub a a variation on the previous statement is needed to build homeomorphisms between sets of the form ca b corollary 4 5 let c be a kaleidoscopic coloring of dn for some n n 3 choose two distinct pairs of points a 0 a 1 dn and b 0 b 1 dn then there is a homeo morphism g ca 0 a 1 a 0 a 1 cb 0 b 1 b 0 b 1 such that g ai bi and such that for all x ca 0 a 1 br dn and z ca 0 a 1 a 0 a 1 distinct cx z cg x g z holds proof again both ca 0 a 1 a 0 a 1 and cb 0 b 1 b 0 b 1 are homeomorphic to dn and we can apply theorem 3 4 5 first properties in this section we establish basic topological and permutation group theoretic properties of kaleidoscopic groups kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 15 5 a local splitting given a coloring c of dn and x br dn where n n 3 it will be convenient to introduce the map x homeo dn sym n g 7 c g x by definition if sym n we have kc x br dn 1 x we stress that the map x is not a group homomorphism however the restriction of x to the stabilizer of x in homeo dn is a homomorphism when the coloring c is kaleidoscopic more can be said proposition 5 1 for each x br dn the map x restricted to the stabilizer k x yields a split surjective homomorphism k x moreover the sec tion k x can be chosen to be uniformly continuous for the uniform struc tures of point wise convergence on n and on br dn respectively proof fix x br dn and let ai i n enumerate x such that c ai i for each i n corollary 4 4 supplies a homeomorphism hi a 0 x ai x such that hi x x and cw z chi w hi z for all w z a 0 distinct given and i n we thus have a homeomorphism h i h 1 i ai x a i x since is a permutation of n the conditions of lemma 4 3 are satisfied by the collection of maps h i h 1 i i n we therefore obtain a homeomor phism g of dn defined by g y h i h 1 i y where i is such that y ai furthermore g fixes x and c g w if w x 1 otherwise in particular g belongs to k and one verifies readily that 7 g is a homomorphism we now turn to the uniform continuity statement if we want the map g to fix a finite subset f br dn it suffices that fixes a large enough finite subset of n to ensure that g is the identity on all the components of x that contain elements of f x 5 b topology lemma 5 2 let c be a coloring of dn where n n 3 for each x br dn the map x is continuous on homeo dn proof given finite sequences r r 1 ri and s s 1 si in n let or s be the set of maps g sym n such that g rj sj for 1 j i recall that the topology on sym n has a basis consisting of the sets or s when n is finite this topology is discrete 16 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek fix now r and s as above if the set 1 x or s is empty it is trivially open otherwise choose g 1 x or s and for each rj select wj br dn such that cx wj rj define f wj 1 j i x whenever h belongs to the point wise stabilizer homeo dn f we have c gh x c g x c h x for each color rj it follows that c gh x rj si and hence g homeo dn f 1 x or s since homeo dn f is open we conclude that 1 x or s contains a neigh borhood of g so x is continuous we now identify exactly when k is a polish group under the sub space topology recall that this is equivalent to k being a g in the polish group sym br dn which in turn is equivalent to being closed see 16 theorem 3 11 and exercise 9 6 proposition 5 3 let sym n with n n 3 then k is closed in homeo dn if and only if is a closed subgroup of sym n proof fix a kaleidoscopic coloring c for dn and set g kc suppose first that is a closed subgroup and let v br dn by lemma 5 2 v is continuous so 1 v is closed since g v br dn 1 v we conclude that g is closed conversely suppose that g is closed fix x br dn and let 7 g be a splitting gx as in proposition 5 1 the uniform continuity statement implies that 7 g extends to the closure of while ranging in gx since g and hence also gx is complete however this map gx is a splitting of gx and hence as desired remark 5 4 in view of proposition 5 3 a natural question arises does k admit a polish group topology if and only if is closed 5 c transitivity a group action g y x is called doubly transitive if for any two pairs of distinct elements x y and x y of x there is g g such that g x x and g y y proposition 5 5 for n n 3 the group k 1 y n acts transitively on br dn and it acts doubly transitively on ends dn and on reg dn proof theorem 3 4 shows that k 1 y n acts doubly transitively on ends dn let x y and x y be two pairs of distinct regular points and let us de compose dn x y into the connected components determined by x y that is dn x y ux cx y uy where cx y ux y uy x ux is the unique element of x disjoint from y and uy is the unique element of y disjoint from x similarly we write dn x y ux cx y uy appealing to corollary 4 4 there is a color preserving homeomorphism kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 17 hx ux x y ux x y such that hx x x and hx y y a second application of corollary 4 4 gives a color preserving homeomor phism hy uy x y uy x y such that hy x x and hy y y finally corollary 4 5 gives a color preserving homeomorphism k cx y x y cx y x y such that k x x and k y y by lemma 4 3 we can patch together these homeomorphisms to get a global homeomor phism f that preserves the coloring and such that f x x and f y y this proves that k 1 y n acts doubly transitively on reg dn turning to branch points let a b br dn for each a a there is exactly one b b such that c a c b corollary 4 4 supplies a home omorphism ga a a b b such that ga a b and cx z cga x ga z for all x z a a distinct the family of maps ga a a satisfies the conditions of lemma 4 3 so we can patch together these home omorphisms to get a global homeomorphism g it follows that g is an ele ment of k 1 y n and we conclude that k 1 y n acts transitively on br dn since k contains k 1 y n for any sym n we immediately obtain the following corollary corollary 5 6 for n n 3 and sym n the group k acts transi tively on br dn and it acts doubly transitively on ends dn and on reg dn in particular k has uncountable index in k where ends dn reg dn one naturally asks when the action k y br dn is doubly transitive our next theorem characterizes when this phenomenon occurs theorem 5 7 say that n n 3 and sym n then y n transitively if and only if k acts doubly transitively on br dn proof fix x 6 y br dn and x 6 y br dn and choose x and y in such x cx y cx y and y cy x cy x for each i n and z br dn let us denote by uz i z the component such that c uz i i for i 6 cx y corollary 4 4 supplies a color preserving homeomorphism fx i ux i x y ux x i x y such that fx i x x and fx i y y similarly for i 6 cy x we obtain a color preserving homomorphism fy i uy i uy y i such that fy i x x and fy i y y finally corol lary 4 5 provides a color preserving map fx y cx y x y cx y x y that sends x to x and y to y by lemma 4 3 we can patch together these homeomorphisms to get a global homeomorphism f of dn sending x to x y to y such that c f x x c f y y and c f z id for any z 6 x y we deduce that f k and thus k acts doubly transi tively on br dn the converse is immediate 18 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek 5 d oligomorphy for a group g acting on a set x the diagonal action of g on xk with k 1 is defined by g x 1 xk g x 1 g xk the orbits of the diagonal action of homeo dn on br dn k are completely determined by the combinatorial tree that is formed from the elements of the k tuple see proposition 6 1 in 10 the following result describes orbits of the diagonal action of k on br dn k here one has to consider not only the type of tree generated but also the orbits of diagonal action of on n m for 1 m k lemma 5 8 let c be a kaleidoscopic coloring of dn and say that r x 1 xk br dn and r x 1 x k br dn are center closed subsets such that there is a partial dendrite morphism f r r with f xi x i there is then g k such that g xi x i for all i if and only if for all i there is i such that i cxi xj cx i x j for all j 6 i proof the condition of the existence of the elements i is clearly necessary let us prove it also sufficient let r be the components determined by r and r be the components determined by r recall that x i r is the collection of components of dn xi disjoint from r for each xi r and a x i r let b x i r be such that i c a c b such an element exists by the properties of i corollary 4 4 gives a homeomorphism ha a r b r extending f such that cy z cha y ha z for all y z a distinct for each xi xj r adjacent we apply corollary 4 5 to obtain a homeomorphism gi j cxi xj r cx i x j r extending f such that cy z cgi j y gi j z for all y z cxi xj distinct one verifies that the collection of homeomorphisms ha and gi j as a ranges over a x i r for 1 i k and i j range over all 1 i j k such that xi and xj are adjacent satisfy the hypotheses of lemma 4 3 we thus obtain g homeo dn which extends all maps ha and gi j as well as f furthermore c g v i if v xi 1 otherwise therefore g k and g is the desired element an action g y x is oligomorphic if for any k n the diagonal action g y xk has finitely many orbits it was proved in 9 proposition 12 1 that the action homeo dn of br dn is oligomorphic as explained therein this follows essentially from the statement given above as lemma 4 3 re lying on our description of orbits of the action k y br dn k we char acterize when the kaleidoscopic groups act oligomorphically theorem 5 9 for any sym n closed and n n 3 k acts oligomor phically on br dn if and only of y n oligomorphically in particular k is oligomorphic for all sym n with n finite kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 19 proof assume first that y n is oligomorphic the action of homeo dn on br dn is oligomorphic so it suffices to show that any homeo dn orbit in br dn k splits into finitely many k orbits for any k 1 since any finite set of branch points can be embedded into some finite center closed set of branch points it suffices to prove that a homeo dn orbit of any center closed element in br dn k splits into finitely many k orbits in view of lemma 5 8 the k orbit inside its homeo dn orbit is parametrized by the orbits of y n i where i is the number of ele ments of x i that meet x 1 xk since y n is oligomorphic there are finitely many such orbits and thus the homeo dn orbit of x 1 xk splits into finitely k orbits we conclude that k acts oligomorphi cally on br dn conversely fix x 0 br dn and choose yi br dn such that cx 0 yi i for all i n since k acts oligomorphically on br dn there are only finitely many orbits under the partial action of k on x 0 yi 1 yik ij n furthermore g x 0 yi 1 yik x 0 yj 1 yjk implies that jl g x 0 il the group thus acts on n k with finitely many orbits we conclude that y n oligomorphically 5 e primitivity recall that an action on a set x is called primitive if it is transitive and does not preserve any non trivial equivalence relation on x the trivial relations being x x and the diagonal x x transitivity is in fact automatic unless x consists of two points which will never occur in our setting thus an action with x 6 2 fails to be primitive exactly when there is an invariant partition of x into at least two blocks of at least two points such a partition is called a system of imprimitivity recall further that primitivity is equivalent to being transitive with max imal point stabilizers next recall that the action g y x is doubly transitive if the stabilizer gx acts transitively on x x for any point x in the same way the action g y x is doubly primitive if gx acts primitively on x x theorem 5 10 for any n n 3 and any sym n the group k acts primitively on br dn proof it suffices to prove the theorem for trivial since k 1 k let thus g k 1 be a subgroup strictly containing k 1 x for some branch point x we need to prove g k 1 there is g g such that y g x 6 x now k 1 y gk 1 xg 1 is also a subgroup of g it thus suffices to show that any h k 1 is a product of elements of k 1 x k 1 y g 20 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek let z h x we can assume z 6 x it is either the case that ux z ux y or uy x uy z as the proofs are the same we assume the for mer holds choose w 1 br dn x y such that cz x cw 1 x this is possible because c is kaleidoscopic by lemma 5 8 there is h 1 k 1 x such that h 1 z w 1 this is where the assumption that ux z ux y is applied we next take w 2 br dn x y such that cw 2 y cw 1 y but cw 2 x 6 cx y applying again lemma 5 8 there is h 2 k 1 y such that h 2 w 1 w 2 we then choose w 3 br dn x y such that cw 3 y cx y and cw 3 x cw 2 x this is possible because cw 2 x 6 cx y as before we obtain h 3 k 1 x such that h 3 w 2 w 3 the branch point w 3 is now such that cw 3 y cx y there is thus h 4 k 1 y such that h 4 w 3 x below is a possible configuration the cj are the colors of the components which are depicted by open alcoves and c 3 6 c 0 x y z w 3 w 1 w 2 c 3 c 1 c 3 c 1 c 0 c 2 c 2 c 0 we deduce that h 4 h 3 h 2 h 1 h x x with hi k 1 x k 1 y for each i it follows that h g as claimed since the actions of k on ends dn and reg dn are doubly transi tive by proposition 5 5 theorem 5 10 completes the proof of the following corollary corollary 5 11 for n n 3 and sym n k acts primitively on each of br dn ends dn and reg dn 5 f fixed points and sets we conclude this section by noting several easy lemmas for later use lemma 5 12 say that n n 3 f br dn is finite and center closed and let sym n setting g k every x dn f has an infinite orbit under g f in particular the fixed point set of g f is exactly f proof fix c a kaleidoscopic coloring of dn and observe that it suffices to prove the lemma for 1 fix x dn f as the arguments are similar we consider the case that x is a branch point let f be the components determined by f and say that x is in some component a f the component a is either an element of f f for some f f or a cx y for some adjacent x y f as the cases are similar let us suppose that a cx y and fix a a since c is kaleidoscopic there are infinitely many a a br dn such that c a x ca x and kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 21 ca y ca y for any such a lemma 5 8 supplies g g f such that g a a the orbit of a under g f is thus infinite lemma 5 13 say that n n 3 x y dn are distinct and sym n setting g k the only arc invariant under gx gy is x y proof suppose z z is an arc invariant under the action of gx gy the element z thus has a finite orbit under the action of gx gy in view of lemma 5 12 we deduce that z z x y lemma 5 14 say that n n 3 x y z br dn are distinct and sym n setting g k the fixed point set of g x y z is exactly x y z x y z proof any g homeo dn fixing x y and z also fixes their center x y z since the finite set x y z x y z is center closed the lemma is now a consequence of lemma 5 12 6 simplicity and uniform perfectness the aim of this section is to prove the simplicity of all k we stress that there is no assumption at all on for the dendrite dn a coloring c and x br dn recall that ux i denotes the element of x with color i lemma 6 1 let n n 3 sym n and y z br dn be distinct for any x 1 x 2 y z such that cx 1 y cx 2 y and cx 1 z cx 2 z and for any family of homeomorphisms fi ux 1 i ux 2 i for i n cx 1 y cx 1 z there is h homeo dn such that h is trivial on dn cx 1 x 2 h x 1 x 2 h x 1 h ux 1 i fi for any i n cx 1 y cx 1 z and h x 1 for any x i n cx 1 y cx 1 x ux 1 i x 1 proof let r y z x 1 and s y z x 2 and let f r s by y 7 y z 7 z and x 1 7 x 2 this map is a partial dendrite map for each u y r z r we define ku u r u s to be the identity map for cy x 1 and cx 1 z corollary 4 5 supplies homeomorphisms hy cy x 1 r cy x 2 s and hz cx 1 z cx 2 z that preserve the coloring at all branch points w cy x 1 and v cx 1 z respectively extending each fi so that they extend f the collection of maps hy hz ku fi meet the hypotheses of lemma 4 3 we thereby obtain a homeomorphism h of dn and one verifies that h has the desired properties proposition 6 2 for n n 3 and sym n k is generated by point wise stabilizers of components more precisely for every g k there are g 1 g 2 and g 3 in k such that g g 1 g 2 g 3 and each gi pointwise stabilizes some component ai d n 22 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek proof fix g k we aim to write g as a finite product of elements in k each fixing pointwise some component let x be a branch point of dn that is not fixed by g first case ug x g 2 x g ux g x 6 ug x x recall that uy z is the element of y containing z the following diagram illustrates this case the open alcoves depict the connected components x g x y z ux g x ug x g 2 x ug x x ux g 1 x set i c ux g x and j c ux g 1 x note that i 6 j fix branch points y ux g 1 x and z ug x g 2 x the element g sends ux g 1 x to ug x x and ux g x to ug x g 2 x therefore g x cx y cg x y and g x cx z cg x z the branch points x g x are elements of z y so we are in a position to apply lemma 6 1 with g x and fk g ux k where k n i j we thereby obtain h homeo dn such that h is trivial outside cy z h x g x and h x g x h ux k g ux k for k n i j and h v 1 for any v k n i j ux k x by construction all h v are trivial or coincide with some g v 1 and thus they belong to hence h k and fixes pointwise a com ponent moreover l h 1 g fixes pointwise the component ux k for any k 6 i j as g hl the lemma is proved in this case second case g ux g x ug x x let v x ux g x and choose y v let w g x g v ug x x and choose z w the following diagram illustrates this case x g x y z ux g x ug x x v g v w as the coloring is kaleidoscopic we may find w y x such that cw z cg x z and cw y cg x y it then follows from lemma 6 1 then there is h k 1 such that kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 23 hg x w and h is trivial outside cy z we deduce further that hg ux hg x 6 uhg x x indeed uhg x x uhg x z h ug x z h w 6 hg v but hg ux hg x hg ux y hg v the element hg is in k and satisfies the condition of the first case so we may write hg g 1 g 2 such that g 1 and g 2 are elements of k that fix a component hence g h 1 g 1 g 2 and as h also fixes a component the lemma is verified in this case an arc x y dn is called austro boreal for a homeomorphism g homeo dn if fix g x y x y where fix g is the collection of fixed points of g in dn a subgroup h homeo dn is called dendro minimal if the smallest h invariant sub dendrite of dn is dn theorem 6 3 for n n 3 and sym n k is simple as an abstract group proof let n be a non trivial normal subgroup of k the action of k on br dn is transitive so k is dendro minimal by 10 lemma 4 3 n is also dendro minimal in view of proposition 6 2 it suffices to show that every g k fixing pointwise a component y of dn x for some x dn belongs to n fix such a g k and let y x be the component fixed by g from 9 theorem 10 5 n contains an element n admitting an austro boreal arc i y z lemma 5 8 ensures that we can assume upon conju gating n that i lies in y and that the image b of x under the first point map to i is some branch point in the interior of i the action of n on i y z is free by definition of austro boreal arcs for each t i we may then define ht nkgn k t nkb for some k 0 1 otherwise for each t i let xt a t ut y ut z a the set xt is exactly the collection of v dn t such that r v t where r is the first point map onto i the function ht is a homeomorphism of dn trivial outside xt appealing to lemma 2 3 there is h homeo dn such that h fixes i and h xt ht for all t i one checks further that for any v br dn h v is trivial or coincides with nkgn k v and thus h k an easy computation shows that h n acts trivially except on xb and on xb it acts like g we thus deduce that g h n and so g n 24 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek a simple group is in particular perfect thus each of its elements is a product of commutators this does not mean of course that every element is a commutator a group is called uniformly perfect if there is an integer k such that every element is a product of k commutators the smallest such integer k for a given element is called its commutator length from the proof of theorem 6 3 we obtain the following theorem 6 4 the group k is uniformly perfect more precisely every ele ment is the product of three commutators proof in the proof of theorem 6 3 we may take n to be k itself so any g k fixing pointwise a component is a commutator thanks to proposition 6 2 any element of k is the product of at most three elements each pointwise fixing some component hence every element of k is the product of three commutators 7 isomorphism types this section investigates to what extent the isomorphism type of k depends on in particular we obtain a continuum of non isomorphic kaleidoscopic groups along the way we show that many kaleidoscopic groups have a unique polish topology 7 a unique polish topology throughout this subsection we fix some n n 3 consider a closed subgroup g homeo dn a branch point x br dn and a component u x the rigid stabilizer of u in g is defined to be ristg u g g g y y for all y u the rigid stabilizer of x in g is defined to be ristg x ristg v v x by proposition 5 3 we may consider rigid stabilizers for k with closed lemma 7 1 for sym n closed and g k the rigid stabilizer ristg x is isomorphic to the direct product of the rigid stabilizers of the com ponents v x proof the restriction to components yields an injective continuous homo morphism ristg x v x ristg v it remains to show the homomorphism is also surjective let vi be an enumeration of the components at x and consider any se quence hi ristg vi the elements hi patch together to form a homeo morphism h of dn via lemma 2 3 given any j n denote by gj the home omorphism obtained by patching together hi for i j and the identity on vi when i j the element gj has all its local actions in and gj ristg x kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 25 furthermore gj converges to h pointwise hence h ristg x and the map in question is surjective we now describe the centralizer zg in g of rigid stabilizers lemma 7 2 let sym n be closed and g k for any x br dn and v x zg ristg v g v proof fix c a kaleidoscopic coloring of dn set l zg ristg v and sup pose toward a contradiction that some h l acts non trivially on v say that v v is a branch point such that h v 6 v letting r be the first point map onto v x we have two cases 1 r h v v x and 2 r h v v x the first case is easier than and similar to the second case so we shall only address case 2 for case 2 set z r h v take y v such that v y z and find w y z v such that cw y cv y and cw z cv z for each i n cw y cw z corollary 4 4 supplies a homeomorphism fi uw i uv i that preserves the coloring we now apply lemma 6 1 for 1 v w z y and the family fi this yields g k 1 y n such that g acts trivially on dn cy z and g w v the element g is an element of ristg v and fixes h v on the other hand h commutes with g hence h v gh v hg v h w this is absurd since w 6 v and thus h fixes v we conclude that zg ristg v g v the converse inclusion is immediate corollary 7 3 let sym n be closed and g k for any x br dn and v x ristg v u x v zg ristg u we can now establish the relationship between the stabilizer and the rigid stabilizer of a branch point lemma 7 4 let sym n be closed and g k for any x br dn there is a closed subgroup x gx such that x by g 7 g x is an isomorphism x normalizes ristg x and gx ristg x x in view of lemma 7 1 we conclude corollary 7 5 the stabilizer gx is isomorphic to the permutational wreath prod uct v x ristg v proof of lemma 7 4 the group x is provided by proposition 5 1 which more over ensures that the canonical morphism x obtained from lemma 5 2 is an isomorphism of topological groups 26 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek that x normalizes ristg x is immediate from the construction of x given in the proof of proposition 5 1 it thus remains only to show that every element h gx lies in ristg x x upon multiplying by an element of x we can assume that h fixes each v x setwise by restricting to each v we thus obtain an element in the product v x ristg v the proof of lemma 7 1 shows that h belong to ristg x it now follows that k has a unique polish topology for discrete theorem 7 6 if sym n is discrete then k has a unique polish group topology proof suppose is polish topology on g k and fix x br dn for u x corollary 7 3 implies that ristg u is an intersection of cen tralizers as centralizers are always closed ristg u is closed in the topology the subgroup zg ristg u is also closed in the topology so l ristg u zg ristg u is an analytic set indeed l is the image of the closed set ristg u zg ristg u under the multiplication map which is continuous furthermore ristg x l so by lemma 7 4 l has countable index recalling that analytic sets are measurable in the sense of baire 16 theorem 21 6 it follows that l is open in the topology 16 theorem 9 9 hence gx is open in the topology and refines the usual topology on k on the other hand a polish group does not admit any properly refining polish group topology because every continuous and bi jective homomorphism between polish groups is an isomorphism of topo logical groups see e g 11 theorem 2 1 we conclude that is in fact equal to the usual group topology 7 b isomorphic groups our next few lemmas consider setwise invariant arcs we stress that an element setwise stabilizing an arc can reverse the orientation lemma 7 7 let n n 3 and g homeo dn suppose that g fixes an arc x y setwise and fixes setwise no proper sub arc x y x y if h homeo dn normalizes g then h fixes x y setwise proof the arc h x h y is also invariant under the action of g letting r be the first point map onto x y the arc r h x r h y is a sub arc or point of x y that is invariant under g and as no proper such arc or point exists we may assume without loss of generality that r h x x and r h y y the geodesic h x x does not contain h y since x r h x 6 r h y y we conclude that h x x x y y h y h x h y on the other hand h x h y contains no proper sub arc invariant under the action of g since x y does not hence h x h y x y the arc x y is thus fixed setwise by h kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 27 lemma 7 8 for m n n 3 suppose that sym n and sym m are discrete groups set g k and h k and suppose that g h is an isomorphism of polish groups for any v br dn one of the following hold 1 there is an arc x y such that gv fixes x y setwise and fixes setwise no proper sub arc of x y or 2 gv hw for some w br dm proof let v gv be as given by lemma 7 4 let us write ristg v i n li where li ristg uv i and uv i is the element of v with color i by 9 corollary 4 6 some li fixes a point or a pair of points suppose first that some li fixes a point without loss of generality we assume that l 0 fixes a point let x 0 dm be the fixed point set of l 0 for j 6 0 we may find y br dn uv 0 such that uy j uv 0 since the coloring is kaleidoscopic the group k 1 acts transitively on br dn so there is g k 1 g such that g v y it follows that g uv j uy j and therefore gljg 1 l 0 the group lj thus fixes g 1 x 0 we conclude that every lj fixes some element of dm applying 9 lemma 2 11 ristg v has a fixed point let y be the fixed point set of ristg v lemma 7 4 ensures that ristg v is of countable index in h so ristg v is open in h there is thus a finite set of branch points z such that h z ristg v h y appealing to lemma 5 12 it is the case that y z so y is finite the image v normalizes ristg v so v fixes y setwise the group gv ristg v v therefore setwise fixes y applying 9 propo sition 3 2 gv acts elementarily on dm if gv fixes a point w then gv hw since gv is a maximal subgroup of g via theorem 5 10 in view of corollary 5 6 we deduce further that w is a branch point since gv has countable index in h so claim 2 holds otherwise gv setwise stabilizes some arc x y up to passing to a sub arc we may assume that gv fixes x y setwise and fixes setwise no proper sub arc x y x y hence claim 1 holds suppose next that no li fixes a point without loss of generality l 0 fixes an arc x y setwise and we may assume further that l 0 setwise stabilizes no proper sub arc of x y in view of lemma 7 7 x y is in fact invariant under the action of ristg v and x y contains no proper set wise invariant sub arc the group v normalizes ristg v so by a second application of lemma 7 7 x y is invariant under the action of gv the arc x y also contains no proper setwise invariant sub arc so claim 2 holds we now eliminate case 1 of the previous lemma lemma 7 9 for m n n 3 suppose that sym n and sym m are discrete groups set g k and h k and suppose that g h 28 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek is an isomorphism of polish groups for any v br dn there is w br dm such that gv hw proof via lemma 7 8 either gv hw for some w br dm or gv h x y for some x 6 y in dm suppose toward a contradiction the latter case holds note that since g acts on br dn transitively the latter case holds for all v br dm the group gv is maximal in g by theorem 5 10 so gv h x y in view of lemma 5 8 we may find h g such that h x y x y with x y x y setting g v v we infer that gv h x y the arcs x y and x y are disjoint so there is z br dm such that h x y h x y hz applying lemma 7 8 to 1 h g we see that 1 hz equals gw or is contained in g w w the reductio hypothesis excludes the former case and we deduce that 1 hz g w w on the other hand 1 h x y h x y gv gv 1 hz g w w so lemma 5 13 implies that w w v v we conclude that h x y h x y is of index at most two in hz and this is absurd theorem 7 10 for m n n 3 suppose that sym n and sym m are discrete groups then the following are equivalent 1 n m as permutation groups 2 k k as abstract groups 3 k k as polish groups 4 there is a homeomorphism dn dm and kaleidoscopic colorings c and d such that kc 1 kd proof the equivalence of 2 and 3 is given by theorem 7 6 for 1 implies 3 suppose that n m as permutation groups so n m say that f n n is a bijection giving the isomorphism n n as permutation groups let c be a kaleidoscopic coloring and form kc we obtain a second kaleidoscopic coloring d f c and for all g homeo dn and v br dn d g v f cg v g c 1 v f 1 we deduce that d g v if and only if c g v it now follows that kc kd hence k k as polish groups kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 29 for 4 implies 1 suppose 4 holds and observe that n m fixing v br dn we have the following commutative diagram for all g kc v n c 1 v c g v v g v d v g 1 n d g 1 v n c 1 v v v d v n we observe additionally that all maps in the diagram are bijections hence f d v c 1 v n n is a bijection and moreover f c g v f 1 d g 1 v for all g kc v lemma 7 4 ensures that c g v can take any value in so f f 1 the same argument considering f 1 shows conversely that f f 1 we conclude that n is isomorphic to n as permutation groups we finally argue for 3 implies 4 the most difficult of the implications fix c a kaleidoscopic coloring of dn and d a kaleidoscopic coloring of dm set g kc and h kd and suppose that g h is an iso morphism of polish groups in view of lemma 7 9 for each v br dn there is some w br dm such that gv hw we thus have a map br dn br dm such that gv h v and it follows that this map is a bijection we now argue that respects the betweeness relation take v 6 v in br dn and suppose that w v v is a branch point we may find v br dn such that w v v v via lemma 5 14 the fixed point set of h v v v is exactly v v v v v v on the other hand h v v v h w so w v v v v v v the only possible value for w is v v v we conclude that w v v and therefore respects the betweeness relation applying proposition 2 4 there is a homeomorphism dn dm such that br dn so in particular n m taking g g and v br dn h g v gg v ggvg 1 g gv g 1 h g v as point fixators fix exactly one point we conclude that g v g v therefore g v 1 g v for all branch points v as the branch points are dense we deduce that 1 g g so g g 1 for all g g that is to say g 1 h as there is a continuum of non isomorphic discrete permutation groups we obtain a large family of non isomorphic polish groups 30 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek corollary 7 11 there is a continuum of non isomorphic kaleidoscopic groups we also obtain an interesting countable family of non isomorphic groups corollary 7 12 for n 6 m in n 3 the kaleidoscopic groups k 1 y n and k 1 y m are non isomorphic 8 universality as noted previously one inspiration for the present work is the burger mozes universal group for a regular tree tn with n n 3 see 2 3 an important feature of the burger mozes universal groups is their univer sality property 2 proposition 3 2 2 it turns out that the kaleidoscopic groups enjoy a universality property analogous with the one enjoyed by the burger mozes universal groups theorem 8 1 for n n 3 if g homeo dn is transitive on branch points and has doubly transitive local action y n then g kc for some kaleido scopic coloring c proof let xk k n enumerate br dn fix d x 0 n a bijection we now recursively define a coloring c on every y for y xk where xk is a collection of branch points containing x 0 xk such that for each x xk there is g g with g x x 0 and cx dx 0 g the base case is immediate we define cx 0 dx 0 suppose we have defined c on y for each y xk form z xk xk 1 our coloring c may already be defined on x k 1 if not define cxk 1 cx 0 gk 1 for some gk 1 g such that gk 1 xk 1 x 0 for each adjacent pair v w z and i 6 j in n choose a distinct y v w br dn let h g be such that h y x 0 since gy acts doubly transitively on y we may find k gy such that cx 0 hk uy v i and cx 0 hk uy w j put cy cx 0 hk our coloring c is now defined on xk 1 defined to be z along with all of the elements y and for each x xk 1 there is g g such that cx d g our recursive definition is complete so we obtain c a coloring of dn this coloring is moreover kaleidoscopic and for each xi there is gi g such that gi xi x 0 and cxi d gi the elements gi furthermore have a trivial local action at xi c gi xi cx 0 gi cxi 1 d gi g 1 i d 1 1 take an arbitrary h g and xi br dn and say h xi xj the element gjhg 1 i is in g and it fixes x 0 therefore c gjhg 1 i x 0 where is the local action of g x 0 on x 0 on the other hand c gjhg 1 i x 0 c gj xj c h x 0 c g 1 i xi c h xi kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 31 we thus deduce that c h z for all h g and branch points z thus g kc our next result shows a doubly transitive group ensures any coloring c of the dendrite dn produces the kaleidoscopic group k see 5 propo sition 2 8 for the analogous statement for burger mozes universal groups theorem 8 2 say that n n 3 and sym n is doubly transitive if c is any coloring of dn then kc k proof let xk k n enumerate br dn we now recursively define a kaleido scopic coloring d on every y for y xk where xk is a collection of branch points containing x 0 xk for the base case we set dx 0 cx 0 suppose we have defined d on y for each y xk form z xk xk 1 our coloring d may already be defined on x k 1 if not define dxk 1 cxk 1 for each adjacent pair v w z and i 6 j in n choose a distinct y v w br dn since acts doubly transitively on n we may find such that cy uy v i and cy uy w j put dy cy our coloring d is now defined on xk 1 defined to be z along with all of the elements y our recursive definition is complete so we obtain d a coloring of dn and this coloring is kaleidoscopic for each element g kd and x br dn we have d g x dg x g dx 1 cg x g c 1 x where and are some elements of it now follows that c g x hence kd kc the converse inclusion is similar theorem 8 2 fails if is not doubly transitive example 8 3 fix two distinct end points and of d 3 let c be a color ing such that for every branch point z cz 1 and cz 0 suppose c is additionally such that for all z br dn cz 0 one checks that kc z 3 z does not transitively on pairs of endpoints on the other hand corollary 5 6 shows that any kaleidoscopic group acts tran sitively on pairs of endpoints hence kc z 3 z is not a kaleidoscopic group 9 cohomology and generosity this section exposes how to obtain cohomology for a kaleidoscopic group k y n out of information of cohomological type about the local per mutation group y n 32 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek 9 a preliminaries on cohomology recall the homogeneous model for general cocycles on an arbitrary set e with values in an abelian group a which will be a z or a r in the applications below given q n a q cochain is any map eq 1 a the q cochain is called alternating if any permutation of its variables only modifies its value by multiplying it with the sign of the permutation the homogeneous coboundary of is the q 1 cochain d defined by omitting variables as follows d x 0 xq 1 q 1 j 0 1 j x j finally a cocycle is an element of the kernel of d when no further assump tion is made every cocycle is a coboundary for instance given any p e one checks that a cocycle satisfies d when is defined by 9 i x 0 xq 1 p x 0 xq 1 one of the ways to realize the cohomology hq g a of a group g is as the quotient of the g invariant q cocycles on e g by the coboundaries of g invariant q 1 cochains when a is divisible e g a r one can equivalently use alternating cocycles and coboundaries the bounded cohomology is obtained by restricting both cocycles and coboundaries to be bounded maps it therefore comes with a natural com parison map to usual cohomology although this map is induced by the inclusion of cochains it is in general not injective nor surjective at the level of cohomology 9 b a local to global procedure for cocycles the basic construction of this section is as follows fix a kaleidoscopic coloring c of dn given a invariant alternating 2 cocycle n 3 a we define a map ends dn 3 a ca ca ca and distinct with center a 0 otherwise proposition 9 1 the map is a k invariant alternating 2 cocycle proof the issue in checking that d vanishes on 4 tuples of ends comes from the fact that the definition of depends on the center of a triple whilst there is in general no single center for four points as for invariance and al ternation these properties follow by construction using the corresponding properties of consider thus four ends we can assume that they are pairwise distinct since otherwise the above issue does not arise for the same rea son we can assume that the tree spanned in dn by these ends has two inner nodes of degree three rather than one of degree four these being the only possibilities for a tree with four leaves finally upon permuting the variables which we can do since is alternating we are reduced to the kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 33 situation where the center a of coincides with the center of and the center b 6 a of coincides with the center of a b it follows that the colorings at a of and coincide therefore we have likewise the coloring at b shows that these two equalities imply indeed the cocycle equation 0 that was to be established recall that a cocycle that is invariant for a group acting transitively on the set where the cocycle is defined yields canonically a cohomology class for that group although this cohomology class could be trivial even if the cocycle is not the coboundary of an invariant cochain on that set con cretely keeping the notation above the corresponding invariant cocycle on k 3 can be defined by g 0 g 1 g 2 7 g 0 g 1 g 2 where is an arbitrary element of ends dn the transitivity assumption implies that the cohomology class of this cocycle does not depend on the choice of our source of non trivial cohomology classes is the following result we emphasize that the boundedness assumption on is needed in the proof although of course it is automatically satisfied for n theorem 9 2 let a z or a r and suppose that n 3 a is a non zero bounded alternating invariant cocycle then determines a non trivial bounded cohomology class in h 2 b k a which remains non trivial in the usual cohomology h 2 k a remark 9 3 we emphasize that is not assumed to be cohomologically non trivial as invariant cocycle indeed we shall notably apply theo rem 9 2 to coboundaries of invariant cochains proof of theorem 9 2 it suffices to prove the formally stronger statement with a r moreover it suffices to show that the class of in bounded cohomol ogy is non trivial indeed the uniform perfectness of k established in 34 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek theorem 6 4 above implies that the natural map h 2 b k r h 2 k r is injective see e g corollary 2 11 in 18 in fact we shall prove the following stronger statement let be any countable subgroup of k if the action on dn is dendro minimal then the pull back of our class to h 2 b r is non trivial to verify that this statement indeed implies the non vanishing in h 2 b k r it suffices to observe that such a countable group exists any dense countable subgroup will do since k acts transitively on branch points proposi tion 5 5 and thus is dendro minimal to prove the statement for we recall from 8 in 9 that there exists a non singular measure space b together with a measurable equivariant map b ends dn such that the action on b is amenable in zim mer s sense and such that the diagonal action on b 2 is ergodic we fur ther recall that the cocycle b 3 r defined by precomposition with realizes the class in h 2 b r under con sideration see e g 7 5 3 and 7 2 6 in 20 now the ergodicity of b 2 im plies that defines a non vanishing class in h 2 b r unless itself vanishes almost everywhere since any alternating invariant measurable map b 2 r as needed for coboundaries must vanish it thus remains to show that does not vanish almost everywhere to this end pick any branch point a the fact that is not identically zero on n 3 implies that there are three components x y z a such that 6 0 for all end points x y z consider the measure on dn which is the image under of the given measure on b it remains only to observe that this measure is non zero on x y and z this is the case because these components are open the class of the measure is preserved by and acts minimally on dn by 9 lemma 4 4 and remark 4 7 9 c generosity we recall a definition due to p neumann 22 definition 9 4 an action of group g on some set is generously transitive if for any x y in the set there is g g such that g x y and g y x remark 9 5 generous transitivity implies transitivity and is implied by double transitivity the action of a cyclic group of order 3 on itself shows that it is not the same as transitivity and the action of the dihedral group of a square on the vertices of that square shows that it is not the same as double transitivity moreover generous transitivity is unrelated to primitivity the action of z pz on itself is primitive but not generous when p 6 2 is prime and the above mentioned action of the dihedral group of a square is generous but not primitive kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 35 we further recall that two actions of a given group are called orthogonal if the diagonal action on the product is transitive we shall say that an action is semi generous if it decomposes into two orthogonal orbits that are both generously transitive it turns out that a rather natural property in character theory for finite permutation groups is equivalent to being either generous or semi generous see proposition 8 4 in 22 exactly this disjunction appears also in the fol lowing result proposition 9 6 the following are equivalent for a permutation group y n with n n 3 i the permutation group y n is neither generous nor semi generous ii there exists a non zero coboundary of a bounded alternating invariant map n 2 r iii there exists a non zero coboundary of an alternating invariant map n 2 0 1 proof the main point is the implication i iii since y n is not gen erous we can choose p q in n such that in n 2 the orbits p q and q p are disjoint define the map n 2 0 1 by declaring that 1 on p q that 1 on q p and that 0 elsewhere it suf fices to show that upon possibly changing our choice of p q and changing accordingly there exist x y z in n such that the relation 9 ii x y x z z y does not hold the coboundary is then d suppose thus that 9 ii always holds and consider the oriented graph on n defined by p q the relation 9 ii applied to x y p q shows that every z n either receives an edge from p or originates an edge to q but not both this defines a invariant partition q p of n with p p and q q moreover the definition of our graph shows that the stabilizer of p acts transitively on q and the stabilizer of q transitively on p it follows that p and q are orthogonal sets since y n is not semi generous at least one of these two orbits is not generous we now modify our choices by taking p q in that orbit and redefining accordingly this time the relation 9 ii must be violated because otherwise the same argument would provide a invariant partition of the chosen orbit which is absurd this establishes i iii since iii ii is trivial it remains only to justify ii i if were gen erous then there would be no non zero alternating invariant function on n 2 at all if on the other hand were semi generous then there would be a one dimensional space of such functions but they would automatically satisfy 9 ii everywhere combining proposition 9 6 with theorem 9 2 via proposition 9 1 we con clude 36 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek corollary 9 7 suppose that the permutation group y n is neither gener ous nor semi generous then k admits a cocycle with values in 0 1 2 which determines a non trivial class in h 2 k z and in h 2 b k z more over these two classes remain non trivial when viewed as r valued cohomology classes 9 d more cohomology the methods introduced above give more than just non vanishing since the correspondence 7 of proposition 9 1 is additive we can reformulate theorem 9 2 as follows corollary 9 8 let a z or a r and denote by z 2 alt b n a the group of bounded alternating invariant 2 cocycles on n then the maps z 2 alt b n a h 2 b k a h 2 k a are injective as a first application we can give a quantitative estimate on the size of the second cohomology of kaleidoscopic groups by counting arguments that are particularly simple in the case where is trivial the triangular number below is to be read as in the case n corollary 9 9 for n n 3 the image of h 2 b k 1 y n z in the ordinary cohomology h 2 k 1 y n r spans a space of dimension at least n 1 n 2 2 this result implies corollary 1 8 from the introduction thanks to the uni versal coefficient theorem proof by corollary 9 8 it suffices to compute the rank of z 2 alt b n z sup pose n since there is no equivariance condition every cocycle in that group is the coboundary of an alternating map n 2 z as follows e g from equation 9 i the group of such maps has rank n 2 n n 1 2 on the other hand the kernel of the coboundary map 7 d which parametrizes z 2 alt b n z consists exactly of the image of all maps n z again by an application of equation 9 i this image is the quotient of n z by the kernel consisting of constant maps and hence has rank n 1 we conclude that z 2 alt b n z has rank n n 1 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 2 as claimed the case n is a simpler version of the same argument remark 9 10 the reader might have noticed that all applications so far have used only cocycles on n that are coboundaries in other words we used cocycles that are trivial for the cohomology of and constructed non trivial cohomology for k in fact this is unavoidable when working with n indeed in that case any cocycle is the coboundary of an invariant r valued cochain this can be seen by averaging the equation 9 i over all p n kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 37 therefore proposition 9 6 shows that the condition barring generosity and semi generosity provides the exact setting where our construction can work for n turning to n there are situations where y n has interesting non trivial bounded cohomology this allows us to produce cohomology classes even for some examples of kaleidoscopic groups associated to gen erously transitive local actions example 9 11 suppose that preserves a cyclic order on n and denote by n 3 0 1 the corresponding cyclic order cocycle see e g 13 then one checks that the resulting cocycle for k is nothing else than the cyclic order cocycle associated to a natural cyclic order on ends dn defined by the cyclic order on n via the given coloring consider the concrete example of sln q acting on the projective line over q thus we identify with this projective line then theo rem 9 2 produces in particular a non trivial class in h 2 k r on the other hand the local action y is doubly transitive hence in particu lar generously transitive this example can be extended to a larger group giving us access to non trivial cohomology in arbitrarily high degrees corollary 9 12 let t y be the action of thompson s circle group t on the dyadic points of the circle then the cyclic order cocycle determines a class in h 2 b k t y z such that the images of the cup product n are non trivial in h 2 nb k t y z and in h 2 n k t y z for all n we refer to 4 for a description of the group t and of its action proof we choose a lifting t k t y as provided by the wreath product structure of corollary 7 5 this is moreover a lifting of permutation groups so that the corresponding restriction maps h k t y z h t z send to the class determined by the order cocycle for t y the latter is known to have non zero cup powers in h 2 n t z for all n by th or me d in 14 therefore the statement follows from the naturality of the cup product with respect to the maps and to the comparison maps h b k t y z h k t y z in fact the reference 14 cited above proves non vanishing in h 2 n t q therefore corollary 9 12 holds also with rational coefficients which allows us to apply the universal coefficient theorem and deduce 38 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek corollary 9 13 the homology h 2 n k t y z is non trivial for all n 10 acyclicity a group g is called acyclic if its homology hn g z vanishes for all n 0 this implies the cohomology hn g z and hn g r vanishes for all n 0 thanks to the universal coefficient theorem the main result of this section is the following theorem 10 1 the homeomorphism group of the universal waz ewski dendrite d is acyclic this theorem and its corollary below stand in contrast to the non vanishing results of section 9 corollary 10 2 let g be the homeomorphism group of d then the bounded cohomology h 2 b g z and h 2 b g r both vanish remark 10 3 once again all these co homological statements regard g as an abstract group proof of corollary 10 2 a general fact for any group is that in order to de duce the vanishing of h 2 b r from the vanishing of h 2 r it suffices to know that the group is uniformly perfect see e g corollary 2 11 in 18 therefore by theorem 6 4 we conclude that h 2 b g r vanishes turning to z valued bounded cohomology the long exact coefficient sequence see e g proposition 1 1 in 12 shows that it is sufficient to know that h 1 g r z vanishes which is the case since g is perfect the proof of theorem 10 1 uses the tree like structure of the dendrite to reduce the problem to the stabilizers of finite sets of branch points using techniques from algebraic topology the simplest case is the stabilizer of a single point where we will leverage ideas that go back to mather 17 wagoner 26 and segal 24 to prove the following theorem 10 4 the stabilizer of a branch point in the homeomorphism group of d is acyclic the proof of theorem 10 4 will be a variation on the arguments provided by de la harpe and mcduff in 8 for their proof that sym is acyclic to gether with an additional topological ingredient because this stabilizer is a full permutational wreath product of sym with a group of homeomor phisms it will be more involved to treat the stabilizers of other finite sets the key case is the following theorem 10 5 the pointwise stabilizer of two distinct end points in the homeo morphism group of d is acyclic turning to the proofs we begin with the stabilizer of two end points kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 39 proof of theorem 10 5 the proof is in two steps the first is a variation on 23 and the second follows faithfully 8 therefore we shall use a notation compatible with the case of linear groups considered in 8 and urge the reader to have a copy of 23 and especially of 8 at hand we start with the set up for the two steps fix once and for all distinct end points d we consider the first point map r d and identify for notational convenience with r a dashed line will refer to a closed subset d r of the form d k z xk yk subject to the following properties limk xk and xk yk xk 1 for all k we denote by gr standing for grass mannian the collection of all pre images s r 1 d where d is some dashed line notice that s is closed in d finally a flag is an infi nite nested sequence f s 1 s 2 s 3 of elements si gr such that each si 1 is contained in the interior of si let g be the pointwise stabilizer of in homeo d the group g acts on gr and on the set of flags given a flag f we consider the subgroup g consisting of all g g that fix pointwise si for some i depending on g the first step is to prove that the group g which depends of f is acyclic to this end we shall apply a modified version of theorem 1 8 in 23 which establishes the acyclicity of a certain type of homeomor phism group of a space x in our case the group is g and the space is x d the assumptions of theorem 1 8 in 23 are phrased in terms of a given directed family of open subsets u of x in our case this family is the increasing sequence of all u x si as i 1 varies the assumptions postulated in 23 are of two kinds the first is an admissibility assumption definition 1 6 loc cit which in our case holds thanks to the patchwork lemma lemma 2 3 above this admissibility is required in 23 with respect only to sequences of open sets converging to a point but we emphasize that in our case this convergence is not needed because lemma 2 3 does not require it as an assumption specifically the admissibility is used in order to apply lemma 1 4 in 23 which in our case is subsumed by lemma 2 3 above the second assumption in 23 amounts to the following for any u x si as above there should be g g such that all images g j u are disjoint as j 0 and such that gj u converges to a point in x as j for the reasons discussed above we can dispense of the condition that gj u converges to a point then the existence of g follows by another application of lemma 2 3 more precisely if di k z xi k yi k and di 1 k z xi 1 k yi 1 k are the dashed lines corresponding to si and si 1 we can patch together a homeomorphism g that fixes di 1 pointwise but satisfies xi k 1 g yi k xi 1 k 1 40 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek for all k this implies indeed that the open arc gj 1 yi k g j 1 xi k 1 lies above the arc gj yi k g j xi k 1 for all j 0 and k z taking care of our second modified assumption therefore g is acyclic we turn to the second part of the proof which consists in showing that g itself is acyclic by analyzing its action on the set of all flags here we follow faithfully section 3 of 8 that reference was written in the context of linear groups but in such a way that it can be adapted to a number of other settings as illustrated in section 4 loc cit in our case the adaptation is as follows for two elements s s gr the notation s s must be read as s s which is equivalent to the disjointness of the corresponding dashed lines the notation s s must be read as s s with this inter pretation almost all the arguments from 8 3 can be repeated identically with one exception lemma 8 loc cit is proved using infinite direct sums of elements of gr this device is not available in our context therefore we must provide another proof and hence state the lemma the statement reduces immediately following the reduction of lemma 7 to lemma 6 in that reference to this given flags f 1 fp with fm sm 1 sm 2 sm 3 there exists flags f m s m 1 s m 2 s m 3 such that s m i sm i and s m i s n i for all 1 m 6 n p and all i 1 in order to prove this statement we shall use the condition limk xk that we imposed on dashed lines let thus k z xm k ym k be the dashed line corresponding to sm 1 the convergence condition allows us to define s m 1 simply by skipping the arcs indexed by sufficiently many k to ensure that the remaining arcs renumbered as x m k y m k succeed to each other cyclically as m varies specifically we can skip indices depending on m so that we have y m k x m 1 k 1 m p and y p k x 1 k for all k it follows that all sm 1 are pairwise disjoint a fortiori all sm i are pairwise disjoint for any given i proving the statement we now consider the easier case of stabilizers of single points proof of theorem 10 4 this proof is a simpler version of the proof of the orem 10 5 for two reasons on the one hand the first step will be a di rect application of theorem 1 8 in 23 without modifications on the other hand the second step can follow 8 3 more closely than for theorem 10 5 because the equivalent of infinite direct sums in gr will be available therefore since we went into all necessary details in the proof of theo rem 10 5 we can this time indicate only the changes in the set up let thus g be the stabilizer in homeo d of a given branch point x consider the collection gr of moieties s of x that is of subsets s x that are simultane ously infinite and with infinite complement define this time gr to be the collection of subsets s d given by s s with s gr a flag shall kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 41 refer to a nested sequence f s 1 s 2 of elements of gr such that si 1 si is infinite for all i 2 and such that si we choose some flag f and denote by g the group of elements fixing pointwise some si now the assumptions of theorem 1 8 in 23 hold unchanged for the group g acting on x d x likewise all arguments from section 3 in 8 can be adapted usually simplified to work in this setting much like it is done for sym in 8 4 at this point the general case follows corollary 10 6 let f be a non empty finite set of branch points in d then the pointwise stabilizer of f in homeo d is acyclic proof we consider the tree f as a graph without discarding possible ver tices of degree two let v 1 be the number of its vertices and e 0 the number of its edges we claim that the pointwise stabilizer of f can be decomposed as the direct product of v copies of the stabilizer of a branch point and of e copies of the stabilizer of two distinct end points this then implies the statement of the corollary because the k nneth theorem re duces it to a combination of theorems 10 5 and 10 4 to prove the claim observe that the various restrictions to the compo nents of d determined by f yields an injective homomorphism from the pointwise stabilizer of f to the product of v copies of the stabilizer of a branch point and of e copies of the stabilizer of two distinct end points the fact that this homomorphism is surjective follows from the patchwork statement of lemma 2 3 proof of theorem 10 1 by general homological principles the acyclicity of g homeo d follows if we find an exact sequence of z g modules 10 iii 0 z m 0 m 1 m 2 such that i the homology hp g mq vanishes for all p 1 and all q 0 and ii the sequence of co invariants 10 iv 0 z h 0 g m 0 h 0 g m 1 h 0 g m 2 remains exact indeed this follows e g immediately from considering the spectral sequence with first tableau hp g mq we implement this strategy using a method introduced in 1 for bounded cohomology as follows let lq br d q 1 be the set of q 1 tuples of branch points that lie on a common arc which depends of course of the tuple we consider the z g modules mq z lq and define boundary maps q mq mq 1 by the familiar formula q q j 0 1 j q j where q j discards the jth variable the augmentation map m 0 z is the sum mation of coefficients we prove the theorem by establishing that the z g modules mq satisfy all required properties we first justify that the sequence 10 iii is exact to this end we recall the following completely formal basic fact because we need its explicit proof 42 b duchesne n monod and p wesolek let x be any set and consider the contractible full chain complex on x given in degree q by z xq 1 let a b x be distinct points and define the map f x x by f a b and f x x if x 6 a then a homotopy between the identity and the corresponding chain map fq on z xq 1 is given by the maps hq q r 0 1 rhq r z x q 1 z xq 2 where hq r is defined on x xq 1 by f x 0 f xr 1 a b xr 1 xq if xr a and hq r x 0 if xr 6 a we now consider a cycle c mq and proceed to show that it is the boundary of an element of mq 1 consider the finite tree spanned in d by all tuples in the support of c we consider every element of every such tuple as a node of the tree even if it has degree two let now a be a leaf of this tree and b the unique node adjacent to a if the tree is reduced to a the statement is trivial applying the above homotopy with x br d we see that every term that appears is still in the chain complex m because of the choice of a and b indeed if a tuple of c lies on an arc and contains a then adding b to the tuple still remains on an arc therefore c is bounding modulo mq 1 to another cycle c whose associated tree has strictly less nodes the statement now follows by induction next we establish property i for q given there are only finitely many g orbits in lq described completely by topological configuration of q 1 points on an arc see proposition 6 1 in 10 therefore mq is isomorphic as a z g module to a finite sum of modules of the type z g h for subgroups h g more precisely h is the pointwise stabilizer of q 1 not necessar ily distinct branch points by eckmann shapiro induction we have hp g z g h hp h z the latter vanishes for all p 0 by corollary 10 6 as required finally we turn to property ii and examine the sequence 10 iv the co invariant module h 0 g mq is the free z module z lq g on the set of g orbits in lq we describe more precisely the orbit set lq g using propo sition 6 1 in 10 namely it can be identified to the finite set of all config urations i e marked homeomorphism classes of q 1 numbered points spanning a possibly degenerate arc we keep in mind that no orientation is prescribed since g can reverse arcs by contrast the set cq of configura tions on an oriented arc forms just an infinite simplex so that the sequence 10 v 0 z z c 0 z c 1 z c 2 is exact moreover since lq g is the quotient of cq by an action of z 2 we can identify h 0 g mq with the corresponding h 0 z 2 z cq therefore kaleidoscopic groups permutations and dendrites 43 we shall establish property ii by showing that the sequence 10 vi h 0 z 2 z cq h 0 z 2 z cq 1 is exact at all q 0 to this end consider the spectral sequence whose first tableau is e 1 p q hp z 2 z cq since 10 v is exact this spectral sequence abuts to h z 2 z fix some p 0 for any q the unique fixed point in cq the configuration where all points coincide gives an inclusion z z cq of z z 2 modules this inclusion induces an isomorphism hp z 2 z hp z 2 z cq for all q 0 because the complement of z in z cq is a free z z 2 module recalling p 6 0 moreover these isomorphisms intertwine the differential e 1 p q e 1 p q 1 to a map hp z 2 z hp z 2 z which is the zero map when q is odd and the identity when q 2 is even indeed the fixed point in cq has q 1 identical coordinates it follows that e 2 p q vanishes for all p q 1 and that e 2 p 0 is isomorphic to hp z 2 z for all p since this is the
