that a definition of cs e given by aschbacher has a simple interpretation from which one can deduce existence and strong closure very easily we also appeal to a result of gross to give a new proof that there is a unique fusion system cf e on cs e 1 introduction let p be prime by a normal pair s f t e of saturated fusion systems we will mean that f is a saturated fusion system on a finite p group s and e is a normal subsystem of f on t 6 s the centralizer fusion system cf e was first considered by aschbacher in 5 chapter 6 and is a fusion system of index a power of p in cf t on cs e the largest subgroup x of cs t with the property that e cf x while this definition is natural and easy to state the proof of uniqueness is rather technical and relies on several of the tools developed in 4 and earlier chapters of 5 the purpose of this note is twofold firstly we show that cs e may be regarded as the centralizer of a linking system of e where existence uniqueness and strong closure follow almost trivially secondly we apply aschbacher s characterization of cs e as an intersection of local subsystem centralizers in order to give a new proof of the existence of cf e 1 1 main results and structure of the paper recall that a p local finite group is a triple s f l where s is a finite p group f is a saturated fusion system on s and l is a linking system associated to f see 6 definition iii 4 4 when s f t e is a weakly normal pair of fusion systems and l 0 l are the associated linking systems l 0 is weakly normal in l if a certain pair of conditions hold mirroring the weak normality conditions for fusion systems 6 definition iii 4 12 this definition naturally gives rise to the concept of a weakly normal pair s f l t e l 0 of p local finite groups we prove the following result in 3 which may be regarded as a generalization of 1 lemma 1 14 theorem a let s f l t e l 0 be a weakly normal pair of p local finite groups then cs e fits into an exact sequence 1 cs e autl t aut i typ l 0 outltyp l 0 1 in particular cs e is a well defined strongly f closed subgroup of s the definitions of autl t aut i typ l 0 and out l typ l 0 are all provided or ref erenced in 3 a remarkable feature of theorem a is that in contrast to the corresponding result of 5 chapter 6 for fusion systems the proof is very short and follows quickly from the definitions 1 http arxiv org abs 1402 4981 v 3 2 j semeraro our next main result presented in 4 is a new proof of the existence of the fusion system centralizer cf e recall that that the hyperfocal subgroup hyp f of a saturated fusion system f has the property that whenever hyp f 6 r 6 s there is a unique saturated subsystem fr of f on r contained in f at index a power of p see 7 theorem 4 3 we use this fact to prove the following theorem b let s f t e be a normal pair of saturated fusion systems then hyp cf t 6 cs e 6 cs t in particular there is a unique saturated subsystem cf e on cs e contained in cf t at index a power of p for theorem b we appeal to the characterization of cs e as an intersection of subsystem centralizers and combine this with an observation of gross in 11 in 5 we discuss some topics for future work focussing mainly on a conjectured generalization of glauberman s celebrated z theorem 2 background 2 1 group theory standard notation and terminology from finite group theory which can be found in any good text on the subject e g 3 will be adopted we collect some particularly important notions for future reference recall that for a group g op g respectively op g is the smallest normal subgroup h of g with g h a p respectively p group similarly op g respectively op g is the largest normal p respectively p subgroup of g we say that g has a normal p complement if op g op g a subgroup h of g is g centric if cg h 6 h when op g 1 g is p constrained if there exists a normal g centric p subgroup of g 2 2 fusion systems we assume the reader is familiar with the basic definitions and terminology associated with fusion systems which can be found in either of the two recent texts on this subject 6 9 in particular we assume a working knowledge of saturation and alperin s fusion theorem together with definitions and results concerning important subsystems such as f normalizers and f centralizers of subgroups and various examples of normal subsystems 2 3 linking systems for an introduction to the theory of abstract linking sys tems including a definition and some of its basic consequences we refer the reader to 6 iii 4 1 an alternative viewpoint which avoids the categorical definition is presented in 8 2 a proof that these two viewpoints are equivalent can be found in 8 appendix a 3 centralizers of linking systems in this section we shall adopt the notation and terminology of 6 iii 4 let f be a saturated fusion system on a finite p group s for the definition of a linking system associated to f see 6 definition 4 1 if s f t e is a weakly normal pair of fusion systems and l 0 and l are linking systems associated to e and f respectively then 6 definition 4 12 explains what it means for l 0 to be weakly normal in l we begin by describing how l acts on l 0 by conjugation centralizers of subsystems of fusion systems 3 recall the definitions of isotypical autityp l and outtyp l given in 6 iii 4 3 we construct a conjugation map 3 1 autl t 7 c autityp l 0 as follows for each autl t let c c l 0 be the functor from l 0 to itself defined by setting p c p p for p ob l 0 and c p p 1 q q homl 0 p q for each homl 0 p q note that both of the functors and act on the left as is conventional while we let c act on the right so that 3 1 defines a group homomorphism note also that the above construction makes implicit use of the fact that l 0 is weakly normal in l we make the following observation lemma 3 1 let s f l t e l 0 be a weakly normal pair of p local finite groups then c l 0 aut i typ l 0 for each autl t proof by 6 proposition 4 3 a applied to l q p q q p p q p for each p q ob l 0 so that c clearly sends inclusions to inclusions to see that c is isotypical note that for each p ob l 0 and g p p g p p p p p g by axiom c for l 6 definition 4 1 thus p g c p g as needed next we generalize the set outtyp l 0 to define an object dependent on a weakly normal pair of p local finite groups definition 3 2 let s f l t e l 0 be a weakly normal pair of p local finite groups two isotypical equivalences are l naturally isomorphic if for each r ob l 0 there exists r homl r r such that for all homl 0 r r the diagram r r r y y r r r commutes let outltyp l 0 denote the set of equivalence classes of auttyp l 0 under l natural isomorphism notice that l natural isomorphism is a coarser equivalence relation than that of natural isomorphism thus one has a natural map outtyp l 0 out l typ l 0 we will need one more definition before we can state and prove theorem a definition 3 3 let s f t e be a weakly normal pair of fusion systems then cs e g s e cf g we now prove theorem a which may be regarded as a generalization of 1 lemma 1 14 a 4 j semeraro theorem 3 4 let s f l t e l 0 be a weakly normal pair of p local finite groups the sequence 1 cs e s autl t 7 c autityp l 0 out l typ l 0 is exact in particular cs e is a strongly f closed subgroup of s proof by 6 lemma iii 4 9 autityp l 0 is a group and so cs e is a group provided the sequence is exact first we show that the natural homomorphism from autityp l 0 to out l typ l 0 is onto this amounts to showing that each auttyp l 0 is l naturally isomorphic to an isotypical equivalence which sends inclu sions to inclusions but 6 lemma iii 4 9 implies that any such is l 0 naturally isomorphic to an isotypical equivalence establishing the claim now suppose that autityp l 0 is in the kernel of the natural map from autityp l 0 to out l typ l 0 then is l naturally isomorphic to the identity functor and so for each p ob l 0 there are p isol p p and for each homl 0 p q p q since is isotypical tp t p so that p t p p and this shows that is given by conjugation by t autl t conversely if autl t then c is l naturally isomorphic to the identity functor idl 0 via the set of maps p p p ob l 0 next we show that for each autl t c idl 0 if and only if s cs e if c idl 0 then since 1 t g t g for all g s we must have idt by axiom c for l 6 definition 4 1 and the fact that t is injective hence by axiom a 2 for l there is some a cs t such that t a now for each p q ob l 0 and morl 0 p q q a p a so that by 6 proposition 4 3 b there is some morl p a q a such that p q note that a cs t 6 cs p by axiom c for l again and the injectivity of a a hence each morphism in e extends to one which fixes a and a cs e conversely if s a for some a cs e then ca is the identity on ob l 0 and each mor l 0 extends to some with a a by axiom c for l commutes with s a and we have c hence c idl 0 as required it remains to prove that cs e is strongly f closed let a cs e and choose any subgroup p and morphism homf p s with a p let homl p s be such that and note that by axiom c for l we have 1 p a s a this implies that c s a c 1 idl 0 c idl 0 since c p a idl 0 and a cs e as needed we end this section with an example which shows that theorem a does not hold for weakly normal pairs of fusion systems example 3 5 let h h 1 h 2 h 3 with hi a 4 for 1 6 i 6 3 be a direct product of three copies of the alternating group on 4 letters for 1 6 i 6 3 let si syl 2 hi so that s s 1 s 2 s 3 syl 2 h and let xi xi be a group of order 3 which acts on si in such a way that hi si xi for each i set x x 1 x 2 x 1 x 3 c 3 c 3 g sx and define f fs g f 1 fs 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 x 1 x 2 and f 2 fs 1 s 3 s 1 s 3 x 1 x 3 centralizers of subsystems of fusion systems 5 clearlyfi is normal in f for i 1 2 and hence the fusion system e f 1 f 2 on s 1 whose morphisms consist of those in both f 1 and f 2 is an f invariant subsystem on s 1 intersections of f invariant subsystems are f invariant furthermore e fs 1 h 1 so e is saturated and hence weakly normal however e is not normal in f to see this let aute s 1 be the map induced by conjugation by x 1 so that extends to maps 1 cx 1 x 2 and 2 cx 1 x 3 autf s observe that i does not act trivially on cs s 1 z s 1 s s 1 s 2 s 3 for i 1 2 proving the claim now for i 2 3 e cf si f 4 i fsi si but e is not contained in cf s 2 s 3 fs s hence there is no unique maximal subgroup of s which centralizes e and hence no weakly normal pair of linking systems associated to f e by theorem a 4 centralizers of fusion systems in order to introduce aschbacher s local characterization of cs e we first intro duce local subsystems for fusion systems in this section s f t e is always assumed to be a normal pair of saturated fusion systems definition 4 1 let u be a fully f normalized t centric subgroup of t and let x 6 cs t define ux uxcs ux and let d u x n k f ux where k autf ux ux autf ux the reader will readily check that d u 1 is exactly the fusion system d u described in 9 definition 8 37 the next result which is a summary of 5 lemma 6 3 may be regarded as a generalization of 9 lemma 8 38 at least in the case where u is t centric lemma 4 2 let u be a fully f normalized t centric subgroup of t and let x 6 cs t if ux is fully nf u normalized then the following hold a ns ux d u x nt u ne u is a normal pair of constrained fu sion systems realized by a normal pair g u x h u x of finite groups b h u h u 1 is a subgroup of g u x and cs h u cs h u x proof a is 5 lemma 6 3 3 while b is 5 lemma 6 3 5 it turns out that one can formulate cs e as an intersection of centralizers of the h u as the next result describes theorem 4 3 let u be the set of all fully f normalized t centric subgroups of s then cs e autf tcs t u u cs h u furthermore cs e is a strongly f closed subgroup of s proof this is shown in 5 chapter 6 6 j semeraro 4 1 existence of cf e a definition of cf e due to aschbacher has already appeared in chapter 6 of 5 and the results in this section rely on some of the machinery developed there our approach does not however use the theory of normal maps see 4 7 instead we rely on a group theoretic result which is a corollary to the following theorem of gross in 11 theorem 4 4 let g be a p constrained finite group with sylow p subgroup s assume that op g 1 and write c caut g s aut g s ids then c has a normal p complement proof this follows from 1 and 2 in 11 5 if g is a p constrained mini mal counterexample to the lemma 1 and 2 imply that op g 1 where the minimality of g is applied with the respect to the groups z z g and cg m m with m z op g this supplies the required contradiction note that the assumption p 2 is not used anywhere in either of these two steps corollary 4 5 let t 6 s be finite p groups and g h be a normal pair of p constrained finite groups with sylow p subgroup s t if op g 1 then op cg t s 6 cg h proof let cautg h t be the image of cg t under the natural map cg t autg h theorem 4 4 implies that cautg h t has a normal p complement in particular op cautg h t is a p group since op cg t s cg h cg h 6 o p cg t cg h cg h 6 o p cg t cg h and this latter group is a p group we must have op cg t s 6 cg h as needed recall the definition of the hyperfocal subgroup of a saturated fusion system definition 4 6 for any saturated fusion system f over a finite p group s the hyperfocal subgroup hyp f of f is given by hyp f g 1 g g p 6 s op autf p as an immediate consequence of the hyperfocal subgroup theorem 7 theorem 4 3 and 4 theorem 1 we obtain hyp cf t 6 cs e whenever s f t e is a pair of constrained fusion systems in particular there is a saturated fusion system cf e on cs e contained in cf t by 6 theorem i 7 4 in this case our goal is to prove this in the case where e and f are not constrained we will achieve this by combining corollary 4 5 with theorem 4 3 first we need a definition definition 4 7 for each x 6 cs t a chain of subgroups c u u u 0 u 1 un t is strongly f x normalized if ui 1 nt ui ui is fully f normalized and uix is fully nf ui normalized for each 0 6 i n centralizers of subsystems of fusion systems 7 observe that strongly f 1 normalized is exactly what aschbacher calls strongly f normalized in 5 chapter 1 we thus seek a generalization of 5 1 1 1 in other words under suitable conditions we would like to assert that each u 6 t is f conjugate to a subgroupw which affords a strongly f x normalized chain c w for this we need another lemma of aschbacher which says among other things that local subsystems behave well under taking normalizers write u for the set of all fully f normalized t centric subgroups of t lemma 4 8 let x 6 cs t and u u be such that ux is fully nf u normalized and define q nt u there exists homf ns q s with the following properties a u q u xu is fully nf u normalized and xq is fully nf q normalized b extends to a map g u x g u x with the property that ng q x u ng u x q and nh q x u nh u x q proof this follows from parts 6 7 and 8 of 5 lemma 6 6 3 where we observe that the condition x cs e is never used following 5 notation 6 8 for each u u and x 6 cs t for which ux is fully nf u normalized define c u x cg u x nt u and k u x o p c u x we next present a slight simplification of 5 6 10 which shows that we can pass p local information between elements of u lemma 4 9 let x 6 cs t and u u be such that c u u u 0 u 1 un t is a strongly f x normalized chain for each 0 6 j n there exists an isomor phism j ng uj x uj 1 ng uj 1 x uj with 4 1 c uj x j n c t x and k uj x j n k t x proof for each 0 6 j 6 n 1 the isomorphism j is the isomorphism of lemma 4 8 b applied with u uj and q uj 1 it remains to prove that 4 1 holds writing gj g uj x hj h uj x cj c uj x and kj k uj x we have cj j uj 1 6 cj j hj 1 6 chj 1 uj 1 z uj 1 so that cj j 6 cj 1 since kj j 6 cgj uj 1 j also kj j 6 kj 1 conversely cj 1 1 j and kj 1 1 j both centralize uj 1 which implies that cj j cj 1 and kj j kj 1 this completes the proof corollary 4 10 let x 6 cs t and u u be such that xu is fully nf u normalized then there exists homf u s such that c u is strongly f x normalized 8 j semeraro proof assuming the lemma is false let u be a counterexample with n t u as small as possible and write q nt u since t is fully f normalized and xt is fully nf t normalized by assumption when n 1 we see that n 1 by lemma 4 8 a there is some homf ns q s such that u q u and xu and xq are fully nf u and nf q normalized respectively furthermore by 4 1 in lemma 4 9 above x 6 cs t 6 cs q 6 cs q cs t by induction c q is strongly f x normalized and hence so is c u contradicting the minimal choice of n from definition 4 6 we have the following result concerning the hyperfocal sub group of cf t proposition 4 11 for each u u hyp cf t 6 cns u h u proof let x 6 cs t and o p autcf t x it suffices to show that x 6 cns u h u by corollary 4 10 there exists homf ns q s such that c u is strongly f x normalized with q nt u if x 6 cns u h u then x x 1 6 cns u h u 1 cns u h u thus on replacing u x by u x if necessary we may assume that c u is strongly f x normalized suppose we have shown that 4 2 op autcf t x autk t x x then sincex 6 ns uj for each 0 6 j 6 n lemma 4 9 implies that autk t x x autk u x x and x 6 hyp cd u x nt u now the hyperfocal subgroup theorem 7 theorem 4 3 implies that this latter group is equal toop cg u x nt u ns ux which is contained in cs h u x by corollary 4 5 since cs h u x cs h u 1 cs h u by lemma 4 2 b the result follows it thus remains to prove 4 2 clearly autk t x x 6 o p autcf t x by definition conversely each p automorphism autcf t x extends to a morphism autf cs xt xt which fixes t note that xt is fully nf t normalized which we may assume is also of p order thus cg for some g k t x and op autcf t x 6 autk t x x as required corollary 4 12 hyp cf t 6 cs e proof this follows immediately from theorem 4 3 and proposition 4 11 provided hyp cf t is left invariant by elements of autf tcs t but such elements clearly normalize op autcf t p for each p 6 cs t as needed theorem 4 13 let t 6 s be finite p groups and s f t e be a normal pair of saturated fusion systems there is a unique saturated subsystem cf e on cs e contained in cf t at index a power of p centralizers of subsystems of fusion systems 9 proof this follows from corollary 4 12 and 6 theorem i 7 4 5 open questions the z theorem of glauberman 10 theorem 1 which has since been shown to hold for all primes 2 theorem 1 has the following elementary statement for fusion systems theorem 5 1 let g be a finite group with s sylp g if op g 1 then z fs g z g currently when p is odd the proof relies on the classification of finite sim ple groups although in recent years there has been some interest in finding a classification free proof see 12 one could hope to generalize theorem 5 1 as follows conjecture 5 2 let s f t e be a normal pair of fusion systems realized by a normal pair g h of finite groups if op h 1 then cs e cg h s so far all attempts to construct a counterexample to this conjecture have failed for example via elementary calculations it is true when g h sn an n 6 and p 2 pushing this slightly further we can ask whether the following is true conjecture 5 3 let s f t e be a normal pair of fusion systems realized by a normal pair g h of finite groups if op h 1 then cf e fcs h cg h to prove conjecture 5 3 it would be enough to show that fcs h cg h is a fusion system of p power index in cf t references 1 kasper andersen bob oliver and joana ventura reduced tame and exotic fusion systems proc london math soc 105 1 87 152
