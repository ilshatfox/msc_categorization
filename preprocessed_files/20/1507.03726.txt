any group g the norm b 1 g of g is the intersection of all the normalizers of subgroups of g in fact b 1 g is the intersection of all the normalizers of non 1 subnormal subgroups of g this concept was introduced by r baer in 1934 and was investigated by many authors for example see 1 2 4 it is well known 4 that z g b 1 g z 2 g more recently in 10 it has been generalized and showed that the intersection of all the normalizers of non n subnormal subgroups of g say bn g with the stipulation that bn g g if all subgroups of g are n subnormal is a nilpotent normal subgroup of g of class n where n is the function of roseblade s theorem the author in 5 showed in view of the proof of the main theorem that every group with finitely many n of centralizers is nilpotent by finite of order n 1 that is g a g ng cg a n 1 see theorem 2 2 of 6 and also theorem b of 7 this result suggests that the behavior of centralizers has a strong influence on the structure of the group for more information see 8 and 9 this is the main motivation to introduce a new series of norms in groups by their normalizers of the centralizers definition 1 1 for any group g we define the subgroup c g to be the inter section of the normalizers of the centralizers of g that is c g a g ng cg a clearly b 1 g c g define the series whose terms ci g are characteristic subgroups as follows ci 1 g ci g c g ci g for i 0 by c g denote the terminal term of the ascending series 1 http arxiv org abs 1507 03726 v 1 2 mohammad zarrin we say that a group g is a cn group c group if cn g g for some n n g c g respectively we give a characterization for finitely generated nilpotent groups in terms of the subgroups ci g of g as follows theorem let g be a finitely generated group then the following statement are equivalent 1 g is nilpotent 2 g cn g for some positive integer n 3 g cm g is nilpotent for some positive integer m 2 proof for the proof of the main theorem we need the following lemmas an element x of g is called right n engel if x n y 1 for all y g where x y x 1 y 1 xy x 1 xy and x m 1 y x m y y for all positive integers m we denote by rn g the set of all right n engel elements of g and for a given positive integer n a group is called n engel if g rn g lemma 2 1 for any group g the subgroup c g is nilpotent of class 3 and so it is soluble of class 2 proof let x c g then by definition of c g cg y x cg y for all y g it follows that x 2 y 1 for all y c g that is c g is a 2 engel group but it is well known that every 2 engel group is a nilpotent group of class at most 3 completing the proof remark 2 2 since c g is a nilpotent group of class 3 it is easy to see that every cn group is a soluble group of class at most 2 n the converse of the above remark is not true in general for example the symmetric group of degree 3 s 3 is not a c 1 group here we show that the class of c 1 groups is closed by subgroups in fact we have lemma 2 3 for every subgroup h of g we have h c g c h proof we have h c g h a gng cg a a g h ng cg a a gnh cg a a h nh cg a a h nh ch a c h which is our assertion we denote by zi g is i term of the ascending central series of g here we give a very close connection between this series and the upper central series lemma 2 4 for any group g we have zi 1 g ci g r 2 i g proof we let ci ci g and proceed by induction on i first we show that zi 1 g ci g it is clear if i 1 assume that x zi 1 g so x y zi g for all y g and so by the induction hypothesis x y ci 1 it follows that yx yt for some t ci 1 and therefore cg ci 1 y xci 1 cg ci 1 yci 1 on the norm of the centralizers of a group 3 which implies that x ci g hence zi 1 g ci g now we show that ci g r 2 i g again it is clear if i 1 assume that x ci 1 g it follows that x 2 y ci g for all y g so by the induction hypothesis x 2 y r 2 i g and so x r 2 i 2 g and this completes the proof we note that it is not true in general that zi 1 g ci g for instance if g is the dihedral group of size 32 then z 3 g c 2 g z 4 g g in fact we have the following lemma lemma 2 5 let g be a dihedral group of degree n dn then ci g z 2 i g for any i 0 proof suppose that n 2 m where 2 m 1 0 it is easy to see that c 1 d 1 1 2 2 4 3 it follows by lemma 2 4 that z 2 g c 1 g and so z 2 g c 1 g hence ci g z 2 i g note that zj g zi g zi j g zi g for any i j 0 the class of nilpotent groups is not closed under forming extensions however we have the following well known result due to p hall this result is often very useful for proving that a group is nilpotent theorem p hall let n be a normal subgroup of a group g if g n and n are nilpotent then g is nilpotent here we show that the following statement note that the subgroup c g is nilpotent lemma 2 6 for any finitely generated group g we have g c g is nilpotent g is nilpotent proof let g c g is a finitely generated nilpotent group and x g by definition of c g ng cg x c g is a subgroup of g c g and so as g c g is nilpo tent it is subnormal subgroup of g c g it follows that ng cg x is subnormal subgroup of g written ng cg x eeg hence x e cg x eng cg x e eg therefore x eeg that is every cyclic subgroup of g is a subnormal subgroup of g so g is a finitely generated baer group where a group g is said to be baer if for every x g the cyclic subgroup x is subnormal in g but it is well known that baer groups are locally nilpotent hence g is a nilpotent group and this completes the proof lemma 2 7 let h is a subgroup of finitely generated group g then we have h ci g is nilpotent h is nilpotent proof we argue by induction on i let h c g is a finitely generated nilpotent group then according to lemma 2 3 c g c g h c h and so h c h h c g c h c g 4 mohammad zarrin from which it follows that h c h is nilpotent and so by lemma 2 6 h is nilpotent now assume that i 1 and h ci 1 g is a nilpotent group in this case we have h ci 1 g h ci g ci 1 g ci g applying the induction hypothesis note that ci 1 g ci g c g ci g and h ci g g ci g we thus conclude that h ci g is nilpotent and so again by the induction hypothesis h is nilpotent completing the proof we can now deduce the main theorem proof of the theorem according to lemma 2 4 every nilpotent group of class n 1 is a cn group now assume that g is a finitely generated cn group ac cording to lemma 2 4 and remark 2 2 we conclude that g is finitely generated 2 n engel soluble group so it is well known see 3 that g is nilpotent finally lemma 2 7 completes the proof remark 2 8 in view of lemma 2 4 one can see that every nilpotent group note necessarily finitely generated of class n 1 is a cn group finally we state the following question question 2 9 is the nilpotency class of every nilpotent cn group bounded by n references 1 r baer norm and hypernorm publ math debrecen 4 1956 347 356
