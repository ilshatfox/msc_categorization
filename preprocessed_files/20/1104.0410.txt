orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups peter b shalen abstract a positive integer m will be called a finitistic order for an element of a group if there exist a finite group g and a homomorphism h g such that h has order m in g it is shown that up to conjugacy all but finitely many elements of a given finitely generated torsion free kleinian group admit a given integer m 2 as a finitistic order 1 introduction i will be concerned with the following natural algebraic notion definition 1 1 let be an element of a group a positive integer m will be called a finitistic order for if there exist a finite group g and a homomorphism h g such that h has order m in g 1 2 to illustrate this definition consider the case in which is a free abelian group and is a non trivial element of in this case there is an infinite cyclic direct summand c of containing and hence there is a homomorphism h 0 z such that k h 0 0 given any positive integer m the quotient homomorphism z z mkz maps k onto an element of order m hence any positive integer m is a finitistic order for in this case 1 3 on the other hand if is an element of finite order d in a group it is clear that only divisors of d can be finitistic orders for in particular the only finitistic order for the identity element 1 is 1 likewise if a group is not residually finite 9 then by definition it contains at least one element which is in the kernel of every homomorphism from to a finite group the only finitistic order for such an element is 1 by a kleinian group i will mean a discrete subgroup of psl 2 c such a group may be cocompact it may be non cocompact but have finite covolume or it may have infinite covolume the main result of this paper says that up to conjugacy all but finitely many elements of a given finitely generated torsion free kleinian group admit a given integer m 2 as a finitistic order more precisely theorem 1 4 let be a finitely generated torsion free kleinian group let m 2 be an integer and let x denote the set of all elements of for which m is a finitistic order then x is a union of finitely many conjugacy classes partially supported by nsf grant dms 0906155 1 ar x iv 1 10 4 04 10 v 2 m at h g t 1 7 a ug 2 01 1 orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 2 it is interesting to compare theorem 1 4 with some of the results proved in 1 it follows from lemmas 2 and 3 of 1 together with proposition 4 2 of the present paper that if is a finitely generated torsion free kleinian group and m is any positive integer then for every element of there is an integer divisible by m which is a finitistic order for note that this result is neither stronger nor weaker than theorem 1 4 the most novel ingredient in the proof of theorem 1 4 is proposition 2 7 below which is proved using a deep number theoretic result due to siegel and mahler about the finiteness of the set of solutions to the s unit equation in a number field proposition 2 7 implies that for an arbitrary integer m 2 and an arbitrary finitely generated subgroup of sl 2 e where e is a number field the traces of those elements of that are not of finitistic order m form a finite set the result is in fact stronger than this because the finite set of exceptional traces does not depend on the group but only the smallest number field k containing the traces of all elements of because proposition 2 7 does not require discreteness of the group and gives finiteness information based only the trace field k it gives information that is not contained in theorem 1 4 on the other hand proposition 2 7 by itself does directly imply theorem 1 4 primarily because it establishes finiteness only for the set of exceptional traces and not for the set of exceptional conjugacy classes and secondarily because it requires to be contained in sl 2 e where e is a number field rather than in psl 2 c sections 3 5 of this paper are devoted to the geometric arguments that are needed to deduce theorem 1 4 from the purely algebraic propsoition 2 7 the various ingredients are assembled in section 6 to prove theorem 1 4 theorem 1 4 is proved by establishing separate finiteness results for the loxodromic elements of a given finitely generated torsion free kleinian group which are exceptional in the sense that they do not admit a given integer m 2 as a finitistic order and for the parabolic elements of which are exceptional the finiteness for the exceptional loxodromic elements is reduced to proposition 2 7 via results about kleinian groups established in section 4 among these results i would like to call attention to proposition 4 2 which i have not seen stated before in its general form it is used to reduce the proof of finiteness for the exceptional loxodromic elements to the special case where the kleinian group is geometrically finite has no rank 1 maximal parabolic subgroups and is contained in psl 2 e for some number field e the work needed to prove finiteness for exceptional parabolic elements is done in section 5 the general approach to the main result of this section proposition 5 2 was directly inspired by the proof of 1 lemma 3 the details of the proof turn out to involve thurston s dehn filling theorem and some interesting interactions between the topological and geometric aspects of hyperbolic 3 manifolds proposition 2 7 will be applied in a different way to hyperbolic geometry in my forthcoming paper 22 which will establish interactions between the margulis number of a hyperbolic 3 manifold m and the trace field of m i am grateful to dick canary and steve kerckhoff for some informative correspondence orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 3 2 number fields traces and finitistic orders 2 1 if k is a field and g is an element of sl 2 k i will denote by g the image of g under the quotient homomorphism sl 2 k psl 2 k if y is a subset of k i will denote by m 2 y the set of all 2 2 matrices whose entries lie in y if z is a subset ofm 2 k i will denote by tracez the set of all traces of elements of z lemma 2 2 let m 1 be an integer and k be a finite field containing an element whose order in the multiplicative group k is 2 m let g be an element of sl 2 k such that trace g 1 then g psl 2 k has order m proof first consider the case in which trace g 1 in this case the characteristic polynomial x 2 1 x 1 of g has roots and 1 in k and these roots are distinct since has order 2 m 1 hence g is conjugate in sl 2 k to 0 0 1 and therefore has order 2 m in sl 2 k since i is the unique element of order 2 in sl 2 k it follows that g has order m in psl 2 k in the case where trace g 1 we have trace g 1 by the case already proved it follows that g g has order m in psl 2 k 2 3 in this section i will use some concepts and elementary facts from algebraic number theory that will be used the book 17 is a general reference let k be a number field i shall denote by s k the set of all archimedean places of k a set s of places of k will be termed admissible if s is finite and s s k if s is admissible i shall denote by ok s the ring of s integers of k defined as the intersection of all valuation rings corresponding to places not belonging to s in particular ok ok is the ring of integers of k see the statement on p 264 of 19 2 4 if k and e are number fields with k e and if s is an admissible set of places in a number field k i shall denote by se the set of all extensions to e of places in s since a given valuation of k admits only finitely many extensions to valuations of e for example by 17 proposition 8 2 se is an admissible set of places of e on the other hand since every valuation of k admits at least one extension to a valuation of e again for example by 17 proposition 8 2 we have ok s oe se k 2 5 let e be a number field and let p be a nonarchimedean place of e i will denote by o p the valuation ring defined by p by kp the residue field o p p and by p o p kp the quotient homomorphism i will denote by hp the natural homomorphism sl 2 o p sl 2 kp defined by a b c d 7 p a p b p c p d i will denote by p sl 2 o p psl 2 kp the homomorphism defined by p hp orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 4 lemma 2 6 for each integer n 1 there is a positive integer n n n with the following property let e be any number field and let p be a nonarchimededean place of e such that 1 n o p let e be a root of unity of order n then oe o p and p is an element of order n in the multiplicative group k p proof for each positive integer m the cyclotomic polynomial m x z x is irreducible in q x and has degree m for each proper divisor d of n the polynomial xd 1 is a product of cyclotomic polynomials whose degrees at most d n hence xd 1 is relatively prime to n x in q x and so there exist polynomials ad x and bd x in z x such that ad x n x bd x x d 1 nd for some nd q i will take n to be a positive integer which is divisible for nd for every proper divisor d of n and show that the conclusion holds with this choice of n let e be any number field and let p be a nonarchimededean place of e such that 1 n o p let e be a root of unity of order n then in particular is an algebraic integer and so oe o p let us set p since p o p kp is homomorphism we have n 1 i shall complete the proof by assuming that the order of is a proper divisor d of n and deriving a contradiction since the equality ad x n x bd x x d 1 nd holds in z x and since nd n and 1 n o p we have ad n bd d 1 6 0 in kp but since has order n in e we have n 0 and since p is a homomorphism we have n 0 furthermore since has order d in k p we have d 1 0 this is a contradiction i will now turn to the main result of the section proposition 2 7 let k be a number field let s be an admissible set of places of k and let m 2 be an integer then there is a finite set w ok s with the following property let be an element of sl 2 ok s such that trace w then there exists a place p of k with p s such that p psl 2 kp has order m in particular m is a finitistic order for sl 2 ok s proof set n 2 m let n n n be a positive integer having the property stated in lemma 2 6 let k 0 be a finite extension of k which contains a primitive n th root of unity and set 1 k 0 since m 2 we have 2 6 1 and hence 6 0 let s 0 denote an admissible set of places of k 0 containing s k 0 see 2 4 such that 2 n and are units in ok 0 s 0 let u denote the set of all elements u ok 0 s 0 such that both u and 1 u are units in ok 0 s 0 according to 6 theorem d 8 1 a result due to siegel and mahler u is a finite set hence the set w 0 2 u 1 u u k 0 is also finite and so is w k w 0 i shall complete the proof of the proposition by showing that the conclusion is true with this choice of w i claim that for any t k 0 w 0 either t or t is a non unit in ok 0 s 0 indeed suppose that t and t are both units since 2 and are also units in ok 0 s 0 it then orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 5 follows that u t 2 and 1 u t 2 are units as well i e that u u hence t 2 u 1 w 0 a contradiction now let be any element of sl 2 ok s such that t trace w in particular we have t k 0 w 0 hence we may choose an element of 1 1 such that t is a non unit in ok 0 s 0 set s 0 s k 0 by 2 4 we have ok 0 s 0 k ok s and hence t is a non unit in ok 0 s 0 it follows that there is a place p 0 of k 0 such that t belongs to the maximal ideal m 0 of o p 0 hence in the notation of 2 5 we have p 0 t p 0 kp 0 but since t trace we have p 0 t tracehp 0 thus the element g hp 0 of sl 2 kp 0 has trace p 0 if we set p 0 then p 0 1 since is a primitive n th root of unity and since 1 n ok 0 s 0 o p 0 it follows from lemma 2 6 that has order n 2 m in k p 0 since trace g 1 it follows from lemma 2 2 that g p 0 psl 2 kp 0 has order m we have ker m 0 i m 2 m 0 if p denotes the restriction of the place p 0 to k and m denotes the maximal ideal of o p we have ker p i m 2 m hence ker p sl 2 k 0 ker p 0 it follows p has the same order as p 0 namely m 3 preliminaries on kleinian groups the study of torsion free kleinian groups is closely related to the study of complete ori entable hyperbolic 3 manifolds the topological group psl 2 c may be identified by a con tinuous isomorphism with the group of orientation preserving isometries of the 3 dimensional hyperbolic space h 3 if psl 2 c is discrete and torsion free the action of on h 3 is free and properly discontinuous and m h 3 inherits the structure of an orientable hy perbolic 3 manifold with 1 m up to conjugacy there is a natural identification of 1 m with in this section i will collect a few essential facts about hyperbolic 3 manifolds which will be needed in sections 4 and 5 3 1 i will follow the conventions of 21 section 3 in particular i will work in the smooth category so that manifolds and submanifolds are understood to be smooth but will of ten quote results proved in the piecewise linear category the justification for doing this is explained in 21 subsection 3 1 it is understood that a manifold may have a boundary recall from 21 section 3 that a 3 manifold m is said to be irreducible if m is connected and every 2 sphere in m is the boundary of a 3 ball in m according to 21 proposition 3 8 every orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold is irreducible i will also follow the conventions of 21 section 2 in statements and arguments involving fundamental groups i will suppress base points whenever it is possible to do so without ambiguity an element of psl 2 c is said to be parabolic if it is non trivial and has the form a see 2 1 for some a sl 2 c with tracea 2 by a parabolic subgroup of a kleinian group i will mean a non trivial subgroup of whose non trivial elements are all parabolic orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 6 by a standard cusp neighborhood x in the orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m h 3 i will mean a subset of the form b b where b is an open horoball in h 3 precisely invariant under in the sense that b is either equal to b or disjoint from b for every and the stabilizer b of b is a parabolic subgroup i will define the rank of x to be the rank of b which must be equal to 1 or 2 in general a kleinian group is said to be elementary if it has an abelian subgroup of finite index a torsion free elementary kleinian group is itself abelian see e g 20 proposition 2 1 3 2 a non elementary orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m has a well defined convex core which i will denote by c m by definition c m is the smallest non empty closed subset of m which is convex in the strong sense that every geodesic path with endpoints in c m is entirely contained in c m for a construction of c m and proofs of its basic properties see 12 subsection 3 1 1 or 14 p 63 i will denote by c 1 m the closed radius 1 metric neighborhood of c 1 m it follows from 12 proposition 3 1 that c 1 m is a 3 manifold and a deformation retract of m a closed geodesic in a hyperbolic manifold m will be regarded as a map c s 1 m such that the map t 7 c e 2 it from r to m is a geodesic i will write c c s 1 the construction of c m given in 12 or 14 immediately implies that c c m for any closed geodesic c 3 3 as in 12 p 55 i will define the thin part m 0 of a non elementary orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m where 0 is given to be the set of all points of m which are base points of homotopically non trivial loops of length less than according to 12 theorem 2 24 there is a universal constant 0 such that for every orientable 3 manifold m each component of m 0 0 is either a standard cusp neighborhood or a metric neighborhood of a simple closed geodesic i will fix such a constant 0 for the rest of the paper according to 14 lemma 6 7 each rank 2 standard cusp neighborhood x in m contains a smaller rank 2 standard cusp neighborhood s x which is contained in c m i will refer to the set k c 1 m x s x where x ranges over all components of m 0 0 which are rank 2 standard cusp neighborhoods as a truncation of c 1 m thus every non elementary orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold admits a truncation k according to this definition a truncation of c 1 m is not quite unique as it depends on the choice of the standard cusp neighborhoods s x 3 4 let k be an orientable irreducible 3 manifold an essential singular torus in k is defined to be a map f t 2 k such that i f 1 t 2 1 k is injective and ii f is not homotopic in k to a map of t 2 into k now suppose that t is a 2 dimensional submanifold of k such that the inclusion ho momorphism 1 t 1 k is injective for every component t of t in this setting i will define an essential singular annulus in the pair k t to be a map of pairs f s 1 0 1 s 1 0 1 k t such that f 1 s 1 0 1 1 k is injective and f is not homotopic rel s 1 0 1 to a map of s 1 0 1 into t orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 7 proposition 3 5 let m h 3 be an orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold and let k be a truncation of c 1 m then 1 k is irreducible and has no essential singular tori and is a deformation retract of m 2 for every torus component t of k there is a standard cusp neighborhood which is a component of m k and is bounded by t furthermore the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 m is injective and its image a subgroup of 1 m defined up to conjugacy is a rank 2 maximal parabolic subgroup of 3 conversely every rank 2 maximal parabolic subgroup of is conjugate to the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 m for some torus component t of k proof let p h 3 m denote the quotient projection suppose that p is a rank 2 maximal parabolic subgroup of fix generators 1 and 2 of p since 1 and 2 are commuting parabolics there is a point x h 3 such that d x i x 0 for i 1 2 set x p x the base point x p 1 x h 3 determines an isomorphic identification of 1 m x with and under this identification each i is represented by a loop ci 0 1 m of length 0 if we set g c 1 0 1 c 2 0 1 then each point of g is the basepoint of a loop of length 0 and hence g m 0 0 under our identification p in contained in the image p of the inclusion homomorphism 1 g x 1 m x and hence in the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 x x 1 m x where x denotes the component of m 0 0 containing g since p is non cyclic we the discussion in 3 3 shows that x is a rank 2 standard cusp neighborhood hence p is a parabolic subgroup of and the maximality of p implies that p p it now follows from the definition of a truncation that x contains a unique torus component t of k and that the image a priori defined up to conjugacy of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 k is conjugate to p this proves assertion 3 conversely suppose that t is a torus component of k according to the definition of a truncation t is either a a component of c 1 m or b the boundary of a standard cusp neighborhood which is a component of m k however by 12 proposition 3 1 c 1 m is homeomorphic to where denotes the set of discontinuity of hence if a holds some component of conformally covers a torus this is impossible for a non elementary kleinian group because the limit set c must contain more than two points and hence each component of is a hyperbolic riemann surface hence b must hold if x denotes the standard cusp neighborhood bounded by t then by definition p 1 x is a horoball b h 3 and p 1 t is the frontier h of b in h 3 since h is simply connected the inclusion homomorphism i 1 t 1 m is injective furthermore the image of is identified with the stabilizer b of b in which is a maximal parabolic subgroup of 1 m being isomorphic to 1 t it has rank 2 this proves 2 to prove 1 first note that according to the definition of a truncation each component of c 1 m k is a standard cusp neighborhood bounded by a torus component of k hence orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 8 k is a deformation retract of c 1 m since calc 1 m is in turn a deformation retract of m cf 3 2 it follows that k is a deformation retract of m next note that by 12 proposition 3 1 c 1 m is a deformation retract of m hence every component of m c 1 m has non compact closure in m in view of the definition of a truncation it follows that every component of m k has non compact closure in m since m is irreducible by 21 proposition 3 8 it follows that k is irreducible finally suppose that f t 2 k m is an essential singular torus then f 1 t 2 1 m is a rank 2 free abelian subgroup of 1 m which is defined up to conjugacy there is an isomorphic identification of 1 m with which is also canonically defined up to conjugacy since is discrete x must be parabolic let x 0 be a maximal parabolic subgroup containing x as a parabolic subgroup x 0 is free abelian of rank at most 2 and since it contains x its rank must be exactly 2 by assertion 3 of the proposition which was proved above x 0 is conjugate to the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 m for some torus component t of k in particular x is conjugate to a subgroup of the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 m since k is a deformation retract of m by proposition 3 5 and is therefore aspherical it follows that f is homotopic in k to a map of t 2 into t this contradicts the definition of an essential singular torus 3 6 an orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m h 3 or the kleinian group is said to be geometrically finite if m is non elementary and c 1 m has a compact truncation proposition 3 7 an orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m has finite volume if and only if m is geometrically finite and c 1 m has a truncation whose boundary components are all tori proof if c 1 m has a truncation whose boundary components are all tori it follows from assertion 2 of proposition 3 5 that c 1 m has no boundary hence c 1 m m if in addition m is geometrically finite then c 1 m has finite volume according to 12 proposition 3 7 hence in this case m has finite volume conversely if m has finite volume then in particular c 1 m has finite volume and 12 proposition 3 7 implies that m is geometrically finite furthermore if we write m h 3 the finiteness of volm implies that the limit set of is the entire sphere at infinity hence by 12 proposition 3 1 c 1 m has no boundary and so the boundary components of a truncation of c 1 m are all tori an orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m h 3 will be said to have no rank 1 cusps if every maximal parabolic subgroup of has rank 2 the following version of thurston s geometrization theorem is a kind of converse to propo sition 3 5 proposition 3 8 let k be a compact irreducible orientable 3 manifold which has non empty boundary and has no essential singular tori then either 1 k is isomorphic to either a klein bottle group x y yxy 1 x 1 or a free abelian of rank at most 2 or k is diffeomorphic to a truncation of c 1 m for some geometrically finite orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m having no rank 1 cusps orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 9 proof let t denote the union of all torus components of k if t has a component t such that the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 k is not injective then 1 k is infinite cyclic by 21 proposition 3 10 we may therefore assume that 1 t 1 k is injective for every component t of t we may also assume that k is not a 3 ball as otherwise 1 k is trivial consider the case in which the pair k t has no essential singular annuli 3 4 in this case since k also has no essential singular tori and since 1 t 1 k is injective for every component t of t the pair k t is a pared manifold in the sense of 14 definition 4 8 furthermore since k is irreducible and is not a ball and k 6 the manifold k is a haken manifold in the sense defined on page 57 of 14 hence the pared manifold k t satisfies the hypotheses of 14 p 70 theorem b since the components of t if any are all tori rather than annuli the conclusion of 14 p 70 theorem b may be expressed in the language of the present paper by saying that there is a geometrically finite orientable hyperbolic manifold m having no rank 1 cusps such that k is diffeomorphic to a truncation of c 1 m there remains the case in which the pair k t has an essential singular annulus f s 1 0 1 s 1 0 1 k t i will use the terminology of 8 in the following argument let denote a characteristic pair of the compact irreducible pair k t which exists by 8 p 138 according to 8 remark iv 1 2 and the definition of a characteristic pair 8 p 138 after modifying f by a homotopy of maps of pairs we may assume that f s 1 0 1 and f s 1 0 1 let 0 denote the component of containing f s 1 0 1 according to the definition of a characteristic pair 0 is a perfectly embedded pair in the sense of 8 p 4 in particular each component of 0 0 m 0 t is a compact submanifold of t whose boundary curves if any are homotopically non trivial in t since the components of t are tori each component of 0 is a torus or an annulus according to the definition of a characteristic pair either 0 is a seifert fibered space and 0 0 is saturated or 0 is a 0 1 bundle whose associated 0 1 bundle is 0 in the latter subcase since the components of 0 are tori and annulus the base of the 0 1 bundle is a torus klein bottle annulus or mo bius band and hence the 0 1 bundle may be given the structure of a seifert fibered space in such a way that 0 is saturated thus in any event 0 is a seifert fibered space and 0 is saturated i claim that the components of 0 are tori to prove this let 1 denote a regular neigh borhood of the union of 0 with all those components of t which meet 0 since 0 is saturated in 0 the manifold 1 is a seifert fibered space since 1 t is a union of boundary tori of 1 the pair 1 1 t is a seifert pair since f is an essential singular annulus and f s 1 0 1 0 the inclusion map i 1 1 t k t is an essen tial nondegenerate map of seifert pairs the defining property of the characteristic pair therefore implies that i is homotopic as a masp of pairs to a map i such that i 1 0 and i 1 t 0 in particular the inclusion of 1 t into t is homotopic in t to a orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 10 map whose image is contained in 0 since the components of 1 t are closed surfaces it follows that 1 t 0 i e that the components of 0 are tori now i claim that k 0 if this is false we may fix a component c of the frontier of 0 in k since 0 is a seifert fibered space and k 0 is a union of components of 0 the surface c is a torus since 0 is perfectly embedded the inclusion homomorphism 1 c 1 m is injective as k contains no essential tori the inclusion c k must be homotopic to a map of c into k it then follows from 25 corollary 5 5 that c is boundary parallel in k this contradicts the definition of a perfectly embedded pair since k 0 the manifold k is a seifert fibered space hence 1 k has a cyclic normal subgroup n such that q n is a fuchsian group let denote the centralizer of n in so that 2 let q q denote the quotient projection and set q q since k 6 we may write q as a free product of non trivial cyclic groups if in the free product description of q there are at least three factors or if there are at least two factors and one of them order strictly greater than 2 then q has infinitely many non conjugate maximal infinite cyclic subgroups for each maximal cyclic subgroup z of q the group q 1 q is a maximal rank 2 free abelian subgroup of hence has infinitely many non conjugate maximal rank 2 free abelian subgroups as k has only finitely many components it follows that k admits an essential singular torus a contradiction to the hypothesis hence in the free product description of q there are at most two factors and if there are two factors they are both of order 2 this means that either the base b of the seifert fibration is a mo bius band or annulus and there are no singular fibers or b is a disk and there is at most one singular fiber or b is a disk and there are two singular fibers both of local degree 2 it follows that k is diffeomorphic to a solid torus a contradiction or to t 2 0 1 or a twisted i bundle over a klein bottle hence 1 k is either a klein bottle group or a free abelian group of rank 2 4 geometrically finite kleinian groups the main results of the section are proposition 4 2 which i have not seen stated before and proposition 4 3 which is routine the following elementary result proposition 4 1 which is needed for the proof of 4 2 seems surprisingly difficult to locate in the literature proposition 4 1 let v cn be an affine algebraic set defined over an algebraically closed subfield f of c then v fn is a dense subset of v in the classical complex topology proof according to 16 theorem 3 10 9 if an algebraic set is defined over the algebraically closed subfield f of c then its irreducible components are defined over f i will prove the assertion by induction on the dimension of v which is defined to be the max imum of the dimensions of its irreducible components if dimv 0 then v p 1 pk is a finite set since each irreducible component pi of v is defined over f it follows for example from 7 corollary 30 3 that pi fn which gives the conclusion in this case orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 11 now suppose that v cn is an affine algebraic set defined over f and having dimension d 0 and that the assertion is true for affine algebraic subsets of cn defined over f and having dimension less than d we must show that v fn is dense in the classical complex topology of v since the irreducible components of v are defined over f we may assume without loss of generality that v is irreducible let u be a non empty subset of v which is open in the classical topology we must show that u fn 6 let p 0 be a point of u since dimv 0 there is an irreducible curve x in cn with p x v let x 0 x denote the set of smooth points of x then x 0 is non empty and zariski open in x and by 15 theorem 2 33 it is a dense subset of x in the classical topology hence x 0 u 6 fix a classically connected component w of x 0 u then w is a complex 1 manifold in particular it contains more than one point and hence one of the coordinate functions on cn is non constant on w if c denotes such a coordinate function then c w is a non constant holomorphic function on the connected complex 1 manifold w and is therefore an open map to c since f is dense in c it follows that c w f 6 choose a point c w f if we set v c 1 it follows that u v u 6 but v is an algebraic set defined over f it is a proper subset of v since c w is non constant and since v is irreducible it follows that dimv d by the induction hypothesis v fn is dense in the classical topology of v and hence u fn 6 in particular u fn 6 proposition 4 2 let be a non elementary finitely generated torsion free kleinian group then is isomorphic to a kleinian group 1 such that i 1 is geometrically finite ii every maximal parabolic subgroup of 1 has rank 2 and iii 1 psl 2 e for some number field e proof if m denotes the orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold h 3 we have 1 m i claim 4 2 1 is isomorphic to 1 m 0 for some geometrically finite orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m 0 having no rank 1 cusps indeed 4 2 1 is obvious in the case where m is closed since we may then take m 0 m if m is not closed let us fix a truncation k of c 1 m and denote by t the union of all torus components of k according to the main theorem of 24 has only finitely many conjugacy class of maximal parabolic subgroups hence by proposition 3 5 t has only finitely many components i e it is compact it then follows from the relative core theorem of 13 that there is a compact connected submanifold k 0 t of k such that the inclusion homomorphism 1 k 0 1 k is an isomorphism according to 21 lemma 3 4 there is a compact irreducible 3 dimensional submanifold k 1 of m such that k 1 k 0 and such that the inclusion homomorphism 1 k 0 1 k 1 is surjective it follows that k 1 t and that the inclusion homomorphism 1 k 1 1 k is an isomorphism since 1 k 1 is torsion free and non abelian and hence infinite it follows from 21 proposition 3 9 that k 1 is aspherical on the other hand k is homotopy equivalent to the hyperbolic manifold m and is therefore aspherical hence the inclusion k 1 k is a homotopy equivalence and so k 1 is a strong deformation retract of k since k has no essential tori by proposition 3 5 any orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 12 singular essential torus f t 2 k 1 would be homotopic in k to a map g of t 2 into t k 1 since k 1 is a strong deformation retract of k the maps f and g would be homotopic in k 1 a contradiction to the essentiality of f hence k 1 has no essential tori we have k 1 6 since m is non compact since 1 k is isomorphic to the non elementary kleinian group it has no abelian subgroup of finite index it therefore follows from proposition 3 8 that k 1 is diffeomorphic to c 1 m 0 for some geometrically finite orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold m 0 having no rank 1 cusps in particular we have 1 m 1 k 1 1 m 0 thus 4 2 1 is established in all cases let hom sl 2 c denote the set of all representations of in sl 2 c let hom sl 2 c denote the subset of hom sl 2 c consisting of all representations such that maps each parabolic element of to an element of trace 2 in sl 2 c fix a generating set x 1 xt of and define a map of sets hom sl 2 c sl 2 c t m 2 t by xi 1 i t then r hom sl 2 c m 2 t is readily seen to be an affine algebraic subset of m 2 t see 23 subsection 4 1 furthermore r hom sl 2 c r is also an algebraic set in the notation of 23 subsection 4 4 r is the locus of zeros within r of the polynomials i 2 4 where ranges over the parabolics in now let p sl 2 c psl 2 c denote the quotient map let fg denote the set of all points of r of the form where sl 2 c is a representation of such that p is faithful and p is a geometrically finite kleinian group of which all maximal parabolic subgroups have rank 2 if m 0 is the hyperbolic manifold given by 4 2 1 then according to 3 proposition 3 1 1 the discrete faithful representation of 1 m 0 in psl 2 c defined by the hyperbolic structure of m 0 may be lifted to a representation r 1 m 0 sl 2 c precomposing r with an isomorphism of onto 1 m 0 gives a representation such that fg hence 4 2 2 fg 6 since a discrete rank 2 free abelian subgroup of sl 2 c must be parabolic we have fg r now i claim 4 2 3 the subset fg is open in r to prove 4 2 3 one must show given a point 0 fg that some neighborhood of 0 in r is contained in fg here p 0 is faithful 0 p 0 is discrete and geometrically finite and all its maximal parabolic subgroups have rank 2 since the kleinian group 0 is geometrically finite it follows from 12 theorem 3 7 that there is a finite sided dirichlet polyhedron for 0 it then follows from the proof of 11 proposition 9 2 that 0 has a neighborhood in r consisting of points of the form where is a faithful representation such that p is discrete and hence fg this completes the proof of 4 2 3 the definition of a kleinian group used in 11 includes the condition that the group have a non empty set of discontinuity on the sphere at infinity although this condition does not appear to be used in the proof of 11 proposition 9 2 this is why in the proof of 4 2 3 given above i have had to quote the proof of 11 proposition 9 2 rather than the statement the orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 13 latter result as stated does not cover the case in which the set of discontinuity 0 s of 0 is empty an alternative approach in the case 0 is to apply 12 proposition 3 1 to the manifold m 0 h 3 0 to deduce that c 1 m 0 has empty boundary it then follows from the definition of a truncation that c 1 m 0 has a truncation whose boundary components are all tori hence by proposition 3 7 m has finite volume in the finite volume case 4 2 3 is a well known consequence of the results of 5 let y denote the set of all points of r whose coordinates are algebraic numbers since y is the locus of zeros of a set of polynomial equations with integer coefficients we may apply proposition 4 1 taking f to be the algebraic closure of q in c to deduce that y is dense in r in view of 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 it follows that y fg 6 let 1 be a representation such that 1 y fg and set 1 p 1 under the quotient homomorphism sl 2 c psl 2 c since 1 fg the group 1 is discrete is isomorphic to and satisifies conditions i and ii of the conclusion of the proposition since 1 y there is a number field e containing the coordinates of 1 it follows that 1 sl 2 e and condition iii of the conclusion follows proposition 4 3 let be a geometrically finite torsion free kleinian group and let r be a positive real number then the set of loxodromic elements of having length less than r is a union of finitely many conjugacy classes proof set m h 3 fix a truncation k of c 1 m and let x 1 xk denote the standard cusp neighborhoods bounded by the torus components of k since is geometrically finite k is compact cf 3 2 let d denote the intrinisic diameter of k so that any two points of k are joined by a path of length at most d fix a base point k and fix a point h 3 that maps to under the quotient map h 3 m the point determines an isomorphism j 1 m let be a loxodromic element of length at most r then the conjugacy class of j 1 m is represented by an oriented closed geodesic c in m with length at most r in the notation of 3 2 we have c c m c 1 m since is loxodromic c cannot be contained in any of the xi hence c k 6 let us fix a point y s 1 such that c y k let be a positively oriented loop in s 1 based at y which defines a generator of 1 s 1 y then c c is a loop in m based at y let be a path in k which begins at ends at y and has length at most d then c c is a loop based at which has length at most r 2 d and c is conjugate to j in 1 m hence j 1 c is conjugate to in and d r 2 d since is discrete there are only finitely many elements of that displace by a distance at most r 2 d and the conclusion follows corollary 4 4 let be a subgroup of sl 2 c which maps isomorphically onto a geo metrically finite torsion free kleinian group under the quotient homomorphism sl 2 c psl 2 c let 6 2 be a complex number then the set of elements of having trace is a union of finitely many conjugacy classes proof let denote the image of on psl 2 c if has trace then is loxodromic since 6 2 and if l 0 and r 2 r denote the length and twist orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 14 angle of then the quantity 2 cosh l i 2 which is well defined up to sign is equal to hence all elements of with trace map to loxodromic elements of the same length in and the assertion of the corollary follows from proposition 4 3 5 dehn filling the main result of this section is proposition 5 2 which i discussed in the introduction as i pointed out there it builds on ideas from 1 lemma 5 1 will be needed for the proof lemma 5 1 let k be a compact irreducible orientable 3 manifold with no essential singular tori let t be a torus component of k and let x denote a base point in t suppose that the inclusion homomorphism 1 t x 1 m x is injective and let p denote its image then there exist a compact irreducible orientable 3 manifold k a component t of k a base point x t and a homomorphism j 1 k x 1 k x such that 1 every component of k is a torus 2 there are no essential tori in k and 3 j p is an isomorphism of p onto the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t x 1 k x proof let t 1 tk denote the torus components of k indexed so that t 1 t if t 1 tk are the only components of k the conclusion of the lemma follows upon setting k k and taking j to be the identity map i will therefore assume that k has one or more boundary component of genus greater than 1 let f 1 fn denote the higher genus components of c 1 m and let gj 1 denote the genus of fi first consider the case in which k is boundary irreducible for j 1 n the construction of 4 gives a compact orientable hyperbolic 3 manifold qj with connected totally geodesic boundary such that qj has genus gj since qi has totally geodesic boundary it follows from 2 theorem 2 1 that qi is irreducible and boundary irreducible qi has no essential singular tori and qi qi has no essential singular annuli see 3 4 letk denote the orientable 3 manifold obtained from the disjoint union ofk andq 1 qn by gluing fj to qj via some arbitrarily chosen diffeomorphism j fj qj for j 1 n since k and each qi are boundary irreducible the surface f f 1 fn is incompressible in k i claim that k is irreducible and boundary irreducible and has no essential singular tori to prove irreducibility suppose that k is a 2 sphere after a small isotopy we may assume that meets f transversally i will prove by induction on the number c of compo nents of f that bounds a ball in k the case c 0 follows from the irreducibility of k and the qj if c 0 each component of f bounds a disk in f since f is incompress ible among all disks in f bounded by components of f choose one say d which is minimal with respect to inclusion then c d bounds two disks e 1 e 2 and each ei d is a 2 sphere i which is isotopic by a small isotopy to a 2 sphere meeting f in fewer than c components by the induction hypothesis each i bounds a ball bi we have either orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 15 b 1 b 2 d or after possibly re indexing the bi that b 1 b 2 in the first case b 1 b 2 is a ball bounded by and in the second case b 2 b 1 is a ball bounded by the proof of boundary irreducibility is somewhat similar suppose that k is a properly embedded disk which meets f transversally i will prove by induction on the number c of components of f that bounds a disk in k the case c 0 follows from the boundary irreducibility of k and the qj if c 0 each component of f bounds a disk in f since f is incompressible among all disks in f bounded by components of f choose one say d which is minimal with respect to inclusion then c d bounds a disk e and e d is a disk which is isotopic by a small isotopy to a disk meeting f in fewer than c components by the induction hypothesis bounds a disk in k to show that k has no essential singular tori suppose that f t 2 k induces an injection of fundamental groups after a small homotopy we may assume that f is transverse to f i will prove by induction on the number c of components of f 1 f that f is homotopic to a map into k the case c 0 follows from the fact that k and the qj have no essential singular tori now suppose that c 0 and that some component of f 1 f bounds a disk t 2 since f is incompressible f is homotopically trivial in f hence there is a map f t 2 k which agrees with f outside and maps into f since k is irreducible we have 2 k 0 and hence f is homotopic to f clearly f is in turn homotopic by a small homotopy to a map f 1 such that f 1 1 f has fewer than c components by the induction hypothesis f 1 is homotopic to a map into k and hence so is f now suppose that c 0 and that no component of f 1 f bounds a disk t 2 since c 0 we have f 1 q 1 qn 6 after re indexing the qi we may assume that f 1 q 1 6 choose a component a of f 1 q 1 since q 1 q 1 has no essential annuli f a is homotopic in q 1 to a map of a into f 1 hence f is homotopic to a map f t 2 k which agrees with f outside a and maps a into f clearly f is in turn homotopic by a small homotopy to a map f 1 such that f 1 1 f has fewer than c components by the induction hypothesis f 1 is homotopic to a map into k and hence so is f now let j 1 k x 1 k x denote the inclusion homomorphism i claim the conclu sions of the lemma hold with this choice of j if we set t t and x x by construction k is compact and orientable and its boundary components are tori i have shown that k is irreducible and contains no essential singular tori it remains only to observe that conclusion iii of the lemma holds if p denotes the image of the inclusion homomor phism 1 t x 1 k x the definitions of j p and p imply that j p p that j p p p is an isomorphism is tantamount to saying that the inclusion homomorphism 1 t x 1 k x is injective this follows from the boundary irreducibility of k which i proved above this completes the proof of the lemma in the case where k is boundary irreducible now consider the case in which k is boundary reducible let d 1 dm be a maximal system of pairwise disjoint non boundary parallel pairwise non parallel properly embedded disks in k let e be a regular neighborhood of d 1 dm in k and set k 0 k e orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 16 since the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 k is injective none of the disks d 1 dm has its boundary in t and hence t k 0 let k 1 denote the component of k 0 that contains t since k is irreducible and has no essential singular tori and since k 1 is a component of a manifold obtained from k by splitting it along a collection of pairwise disjoint properly embedded disks k 1 is itself irreducible and has no essential singular tori furthermore t is a component of k 1 and the inclusion 1 t x 1 k 1 x is injective i will denote its image by p 1 on the other hand the maximality of the family d 1 dm implies that k 1 is boundary irreducible it therefore follows from the case of the lemma already proved that there exist a compact irreducible orientable 3 manifold k a component t of k a base point x t and a homomorphism j 1 1 k 1 x 1 k x such that conclusions i iii of the lemma hold with k 1 p 1 and j 1 in place of k p and j since k 1 is a component of a manifold obtained from k by splitting along a family of disks the inclusion homomorphism i 1 k 1 x 1 k x maps 1 k 1 x isomorphically onto a free factor of 1 k x in particular i has a left inverse r which is a homomorphism the definitions of i p 1 and p imply that i p 1 p since i is injective it restricts to an isomorphism of p 1 onto p hence r maps p isomorphically onto p 1 since j 1 maps p 1 isomorphically onto p the homomorphism j j 1 r 1 k x 1 k x maps p isomorphically onto p and the lemma is proved in this case as well proposition 5 2 let be a torsion free geometrically finite kleinian group such that every maximal parabolic subgroup of has rank 2 let p be a maximal parabolic subgroup of then there is a finite set y p such that for every p y and every positive integer m there exist a kleinian group and a homomorphism h such that h has order m in furthermore if y is such a set then every positive integer is a finitistic order for every p y proof set m h 3 and fix a truncation k of c 1 m let t 1 tk denote the torus boundary components of k by proposition 3 5 k is since p is a maximal parabolic subgroup of it follows from proposition 3 5 that after possibly re indexing the ti and choosing a base point x t 1 we have an isomorphic identification of with 1 k x under which p is the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 x 1 k x i will begin by proving the first assertion in the case where has finite covolume in this case we have c 1 m m and if k is a truncation of m then k is a union of tori t 1 tk by proposition 3 7 the proof in this case is an application of thurston s hyperbolic dehn filling theorem which is stated and proved as 18 theorem 2 1 the following notation will be borrowed from 18 fix a basis i i of h 1 ti z for each i denote by c the set of all coprime pairs of integers together with a symbol for c 1 ck c denote by mc 1 ck the manifold obtained from k as follows if ci glue a half open collar ti 0 to ti if ci pi qi glue a solid torus ji d 2 s 1 to k along ti by gluing the meridian s 1 1 to a curve representing the class pi i qi i consider orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 17 the set g g r 2 g r p q for some r 0 and relatively prime p q z for g r p q g define c g p q and g 2 r set c topologize g as a subset of r 2 s 2 according to 18 theorem 2 1 there exists a neighbourhood f of in gk such that for g 1 gk f the manifold mc g 1 c gk admits the structure of a complete finite volume hyperbolic cone manifold in which the cone locus consists of the cores 0 s 1 of those ji such that gi 6 and the cone angle at the core of ji is gi the inclusion homomorphism 1 t 1 x 1 k x may be regarded as an isomorphism of 1 t 1 x onto p composing the inverse of this isomorphism with the hurewicz isomorphism from 1 t 1 x to h 1 t 1 z one obtains an isomorphism e p h 1 t 1 z the free abelian group p has a basis consisting of the elements l e 1 1 and m e 1 1 now choose an integer b 0 such that for every c x y r 2 with max x y b we have c f let y denote the finite subset of p consisting of all elements of the form lrms as r and s range over all integers of absolute value at most b i will show that the first assertion holds with this choice of y let p y be given and let m be a positive integer let us write ldpmdq where p and q are relatively prime integers d is a positive integer and max dp dq b hence max md p md q b if we set g mdp mdq it follows that g f by definition we have c g p q and g 2 md the manifold mc g is obtained from k by attaching a solid torus j along the boundary component t 1 and attaching half open collars to the remaining components of k here j may be given a product structure j d 2 s 1 in such a way that s 1 1 is glued to a simple closed curve representing the class p q h 1 k z the defining property of f implies that mc g admits the structure of a complete finite volume hyperbolic cone manifold whose cone locus consists of the core 0 s 1 of j and the cone angle at this core is g 2 md since md is an integer the cone manifold structure gives mc g the structure of a hyperbolic orbifold whose singular locus is the core curve in the neighborhood of any point of the singular locus the orbifold is topologically modeled on the quotient of r 3 by the finite cyclic group z md acting through rotations about an axis it follows that the orbifold fundamental group orb 1 mc g is isomorphic to a kleinian group and that the inclusion homomorphism defined modulo inner automorphisms from 1 k to orb 1 mc g maps 0 l pmq onto a element of order of md hence h maps d 0 onto an element of order m this proves the first assertion of the proposition in the finite covolume case i will now prove the first assertion in the general case according to proposition 3 5 k is irreducible and has no essential singular tori the inclusion homomorphism 1 t x 1 m x is injective by proposition 3 5 and it has image p according to our choice of t hence we may apply lemma 5 1 taking t t 1 this gives a compact irreducible orientable 3 manifold k a component t of k a base point x t and a homomorphism orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 18 j 1 k x 1 k x furthermore every component of k is a torus there are no essential tori in k and if p denotes the image of the inclusion homomorphism 1 t x 1 k x then j restricts to an isomorphism of p onto p i claim 5 2 1 there is a finite set y p such that for every p y and every positive integer m there exist a kleinian group and a homomorphism h 1 k x such that h has order m in to prove 5 2 1 first note that by proposition 3 8 either i k is diffeomorphic to a truncation of c 1 m for some geometrically finite orientable hyperbolic 3 manifoldm having no rank 1 cusps ii 1 k x is free abelian or iii 1 k x is a klein bottle group if i holds then since the boundary components of k are all tori m has finite volume by proposition 3 7 and we may write m h 3 for some torsion free kleinian group of finite covolume furthermore we may identify 1 k x isomorphically with in such a way that p is a maximal parabolic subgroup in this case 5 2 1 follows from the finite covolume case of the first assertion of the lemma which has already been proved if ii or iii holds i will set 1 k x if ii holds then according to the construction of 1 2 for every 1 and every positive integer m there is a homomorphism h of onto a finite cyclic group z such that h has order m as z is in particular isomorphic to a kleinian group 5 2 1 holds in this case with y 1 if iii holds we may identify isomorphically with x y yxy 1 x 1 suppose that 1 and a positive integer m are given if is not a power of x its image under the quotient homomorphism x is non trivial since x is infinite cyclic the construction of 1 2 gives a homomorphism h of x onto a finite cyclic group z such that h has order m and again 5 2 1 holds with y 1 if xk for some k 6 0 and if d denotes the finite dihedral group u v v 2 1 um k 1 vuv 1 u 1 the homomorphism h d defined by h x u h y v maps onto an element of order m as d is isomorphic to a kleinian group 5 2 1 holds in this subcase as well with y 1 thus 5 2 1 is established in all cases let y be the set given by 5 2 1 and let us set y j 1 y let be any element of p y and set j then p y hence for every positive integer m there exist a kleinian group and a homomorphism h such that h has order m in setting h h j we find that h has order m in this completes the proof of the first assertion of the proposition to prove the second assertion suppose that p y and m n are given fix a kleinian group and a homomorphism h such that h has order m in the group is a subgroup of sl 2 c which is in turn isomorphic to a subgroup of gl 2 c indeed the adjoint action of sl 2 c on its 3 dimensional lie algebra factors through a faithful representation of sl 2 c in particular is a linear group and is therefore residually finite according to 10 since the elements 2 m 1 of are nontrivial there exist a finite orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 19 group g and a homomorphism j g such that j i is nontrivial for i 1 m 1 if h denotes the homomorphism j h g then h i j i is nontrivial for i 1 m 1 but h m is trivial since m is trivial hence h has order m in g this shows that m is a finitistic order for 6 proof of the main theorem this section is devoted to the proof of theorem 1 4 as in the statement of the theorem let be a finitely generated torsion free kleinian group let m 2 be an integer and let x denote the set of all elements of for which m is a finitistic order we must show that x is a union of finitely many conjugacy classes if is elementary then it is free abelian by 3 1 and by 1 2 it follows that x for the rest of the proof i will assume that is non elementary the required conclusion depends only on the isomorphism class of in view of proposition 4 2 we may therefore assume without loss of generality that 1 is geometrically finite 2 every maximal parabolic subgroup of has rank 2 and 3 psl 2 k for some number field k since m 1 the identity element 1 of does not belong to x since is torsion free and discrete every non trivial element of is loxodromic or parabolic hence we may write x z zp 1 where z resp zp denotes the set of loxodromic resp parabolic elements of x i shall prove the theorem by showing that each of the sets z and zp is a union of finitely many conjugacy classes note that each of these sets is obviously invariant under conjugation since psl 2 k by 3 above and since is finitely generated there is a finite set s of places of k such that psl 2 ok s after possibly enlarging s we may assume that it contains the infinite places i e that it is admissible according to 3 proposition 3 1 1 there is a subgroup of sl 2 c such that the quotient homomorphism sl 2 c psl 2 c restricts to an isomorphism q since psl 2 ok s we have sl 2 ok s we apply proposition 2 7 defining s as above and using the given value of m 2 since sl 2 ok s proposition 2 7 implies in particular that there is a finite set w ok s such that every element of with trace w has m as a finitistic order hence trace q 1 x w in particular if we set z q 1 z then trace z is contained in w and is therefore finite on the other hand since z consists of loxodromic elements we have 2 2 trace z since is geometrically finite by 1 above it follows from corollary 4 4 that z contains only finitely many conjugacy classes of elements with any given trace hence z contains only finitely many conjugacy classes and therefore so does z since is geometrically finite a truncation of m h 3 has only finitely many torus components and hence by proposition 3 5 has only finitely many conjugacy classes of orders of elements in finite quotients of kleinian groups 20 maximal parabolic subgroups let k 0 denote the number of these conjugacy classes and let p 1 pk be subgroups representing them by 2 above each of the pi has rank 2 according to proposition 5 2 and conditions 1 and 2 above each pi has a finite subset yi such that every positive integer and in particular m is a finitistic order for every pi yi hence each element of zp is conjugate to an element of k i 1 yi this shows that zp is contained in a union of finitely many conjugacy classes this completes the
