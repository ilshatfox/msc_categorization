embeddings into left ordered simple groups embeddings into left orderable simple groups arman darbinyan and markus steenbock abstract we prove that every countable left ordered group embeds into a finitely generated left ordered simple group moreover if the first group has a computable left order then the simple group also has a computable left order we also obtain a boone higman thompson type theorem for left orderable groups with recursively enumerable positive cones these embeddings are frattini embeddings and isometric whenever the initial group is finitely generated finally we reprove thompson s theorem on word problem preserving embeddings into finitely generated simple groups and observe that the embedding is isometric 1 introduction a group is simple if it has no proper non trivial normal subgroups infinite finitely generated simple groups were discovered in hig 51 in fact every countable group embeds into a finitely generated simple group hal 74 gor 74 see also sch 76 tho 80 1 1 left order preserving embeddings into simple groups a group is left ordered if it has a linear order that is invariant under multiplications from the left by kkl 19 theorem 4 5 every finitely generated left ordered groups embeds into a finitely generated left ordered group whose derived subgroup is simple infinite finitely generated simple and left ordered groups were discovered by hyde and lodha in hl 19 see also mbt 18 hlnr 19 we extend the construction of such groups hl 19 mbt 18 as follows theorem 1 every countable left ordered group g embeds into a finitely generated left ordered simple group h moreover the order on h continues the order on g we also study additional geometric and computability properties of such embeddings see remark 1 1 and theorem 2 a subgroup g of h is called frattini embedded if any two elements of g that are conjugate in h are also conjugate in g also if there exist finite generating sets x and y of g and h respectively such that the word metric of g with with respect to x coincides with the word metric of g with respect to y then it is said that g is isometrically embedded in h date july 21 2020 2010 mathematics subject

study of computability aspects of orders on groups was initiated in dk 86 see also dow 98 a left order is computable if it is decidable whether a given element is positive negative or equal to the identity in particular a finitely generated computably left ordered group has a decidable word problem the following theorem is the computable version of theorem 1 theorem 2 every countable computably left ordered group g embeds into a finitely generated com putably left ordered simple group h moreover the order on h continues the order on g in addition the embedding is a frattini embedding and if g is finitely generated then it is isometric 1 2 boone higman and thompson s theorem revisited a landmark result on computability in groups is the boone higman theorem it states that a finitely generated group has decidable word problem if and only if it embeds into a simple subgroup of a finitely presented group thompson strengthened boone higman s theorem by showing that the simple group can be chosen to be finitely generated tho 80 the next theorem is a version of thompson s theorem that in addition preserves the geometry of the group theorem 3 cf theorem a 1 every countable group g embeds into a finitely generated simple group h such that if g has decidable word problem then so does h in addition the embedding is a frattini embedding if g is finitely generated then the embedding is isometric remark 1 2 belk and zaremsky bz 20 theorem c recently proved that every finitely generated group isometrically embeds into a finitely generated simple group but they did not study the frattini property or computability properties of their embedding their result and theorem 3 strengthen a theorem of bridson who proved that every finitely generated group quasi isometrically embeds into a finitely generated group without any non trivial finite quotient bri 98 remark 1 3 if the group g in theorem 3 is not finitely generated instead of saying g has decidable word problem it is more common to say that g is a computable group see definition 2 2 below bludov and glass obtained a left orderable version of the boone higman theorem by showing that a left orderable group has decidable word problem if and only if it embeds into a simple subgroup of a finitely presented left orderable group bg 09 theorem e in this context it is natural to ask whether the simple group can be made finitely generated cf gla 81 p 251 problem 4 the next theorem answers this question in the positive given that the set of positive elements is recursively enumerable namely the following theorem holds embeddings into left orderable simple groups 3 theorem 4 let g be a left orderable finitely generated group that has a recursively enumerable positive cone with respect to some left order then g has decidable word problem if and only if g embeds into a finitely generated simple subgroup of a finitely presented left orderable group remark 1 4 the existence of left orderable groups with decidable word problem that do not embed in a group with computable left order was shown in dar 19 also the existence of finitely generated left orderable groups with decidable word problem but without recursively enumerable positive cone is first shown in dar 19 earlier the analogous result for countable but not finitely generated groups was shown in ht 18 the question whether theorem 4 holds without the assumption that g has a left order with recursively enumerable positive cone remains open also it is open whether a finitely generated left orderable simple group with decidable word problem but without recursively enumerable positive cone exists 1 3 sketch of the embedding constructions we sketch the proof of theorems 1 and 2 we start with a countable computably left ordered group g step 1 embedding into a finitely generated group by a classical wreath product construction neu 60 every countable left ordered group embeds into a 2 generated left ordered group a version of this embedding construction with additional computability properties was established in dar 15 we use the construction from dar 15 see theorem 5 15 to embed the initial left orderable countable group g into a two generated left orderable group that also preserves the computability properties of the left order on g step 2 embedding into a perfect group a group is perfect if it coincides with its first derived subgroup by step 1 we assume that g is finitely generated we let t be a finitely generated left ordered simple group of mbt 18 we note that t is computably left ordered and g embeds into a finitely generated left orderable perfect subgroup g 1 of g or t that preserves the computability property of the left order on g see theorem 5 1 our construction might be considered as a modification of a similar embedding result from tho 80 step 3 embedding into a simple group of piecewise homeomorphisms of flows finally let g 1 be a finitely generated computably left ordered perfect group in which g embeds we embed g 1 into a finitely generated computably left ordered simple group to this end we extend the construction of mbt 18 in mbt 18 matte bon and triestino construct a finitely generated left orderable simple group t of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of flows of the suspension of a minimal subshift see subsection 3 2 the main observation is that every grouph of piecewise homeomorphisms of an interval with countably many breakpoints see definition 3 8 embeds into a subgroup t h of piecewise homeomorphisms of flows of the suspension see definition 3 13 we then study the subgroup t h in particular it is 4 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock finitely generated if h is so just as in mbt 18 a standard commutator argument implies that it is simple given that h is perfect and if h preserves the orientation of the interval then it is also left orderable finally we use the dynamical realisation of left orderability every left ordered group embeds into the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of an interval we use this embedding to conclude that g 1 and hence also g embeds into the finitely generated left ordered simple group t g 1 to analyze the required computability aspects as well as to show that the embeddings are isometric and frattini we use a modified version of the dynamical realization of left orderability see proposition 6 7 if g has decidable word problem it embeds into a group of computable piecewise homeomorphisms of an interval tho 80 3 if we use this embedding in step 3 of the above construction then we obtain the aforementioned result of tho 80 theorem 3 1 4 plan of the paper in section 2 we review computable groups and computably left ordered groups in particular we explain the computability of the standard dynamical realization of left orderabitity after that we come to the main parts of our paper in section 3 we discuss step 3 that is we extend matte bon and triestino s construction of left orderable finitely generated simple groups in order to embed perfect groups into finitely generated simple groups step 2 our version of thompson s splinter group construction is discussed in section 5 step 1 is reviewed in section 5 4 finally we prove theorems 1 2 and 4 to analyze the computability aspects required by theorem 2 as well as to obtain the isometry and frattini properties of the embeddings we introduce a stronger version of the standard dynamical realization of left orderability that we call modified dynamical realization see section 6 in section 7 we prove theorem 3 using the groups of piecewise homeomorphisms of flows discussed in section 3 acknowledgements we thank y lodha m triestino and m zaremsky for their interest and useful comments on a previous version of this work the

function f n n is computable if there is a turing machine such that it outputs the value of f on the input a subset of n is recursively enumerable if there is a computable map i e enumeration from n onto that set moreover it is recursive if in addition its complement is recursively enumerable as well similarly a function f q q is computable if there is a turing machine that for every input m n n n outputs p q n n such that f m n p q embeddings into left orderable simple groups 5 moreover if j is an interval in r then we call a function f j r computable if its restriction to the rational numbers in j maps to q and this restriction is computable 2 1 group presentations and the word problem let s be a finite set we denote by s s 1 the set of all finite words over the alphabet s s 1 definition 2 1 word problem letg s be a finitely generated group the word problem is decidable if the set wp s w s s 1 w g 1 is recursive the decidability of the word problem does not depend on the choice of the finite generating set 2 2 computable groups for a countable group g g 1 g 2 let m n n n be the function such that m i j k if gigj gk definition 2 2 a countable group g is computable if there exists an enumeration of its elements g g 1 g 2 such that the corresponding m n n n is computable remark 2 3 a finitely generated group is computable if and only if it has decidable word problem 2 3 computably left ordered groups an order on n n is computable if there is a turing machine that takes a pair i j n n as input and decides whether or not i j for a countable linearly ordered enumerated set s s 1 s 2 let on n n be the relation such that i j if si is smaller than sj and i j if si is equal to sj a countable set s is computably orderable with respect to the enumeration s s 1 s 2 if there is a linear order on s such that the corresponding to it order relation on n n is computable definition 2 4 a countable group g is computably left orderable with respect to the enumeration g g 1 g 2 if there is a left order on g such that the corresponding order relation on n n is computable in this case is called computable left order on g with respect to the enumeration g g 1 g 2 remark 2 5 in caseg s s g is computably left orderable with respect to some enumeration if and only if there is a left order on g such that the set w s s 1 1 w s s 1 is a recursive set in this case is called computable left order on g and its computability property does not depend on the choice of the finite generating set see dar 19 for details remark 2 6 every computably left orderable group is computable in particular every finitely generated computably left ordered group has decidable word problem 6 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock by ht 18 there is a left orderable computable group without any computable left order in fact there is a finitely generated orderable computable group without any computable order dar 19 example 2 7 the natural order on the group of rational numbers is computable example 2 8 thompson s group f a dyadic point in r is one of the form n 2 m for some n m z an interval is dyadic if its endpoints are dyadic let j be a closed dyadic interval in r we denote by qj the set of the rational points on j we denote by fj the group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of j that are differentiable except at finitely many dyadic points and such that the respective derivatives where they exist are powers of 2 the group fj is isomorphic to thompson s group f see e g cfp 96 1 therefore it is 2 generated and left orderable see e g cfp 96 corollary 2 6 theorem 4 11 moreover the word problem in f is decidable cf tho 80 we define the left order on fj in the following way cf cfp 96 theorem 4 11 let qj q 1 q 2 be a fixed recursive enumeration let f g fj be distinct and let i 0 be the minimal index such that f qi 0 6 g qi 0 then f g if f qi 0 g qi 0 in fact this order is computable indeed let f g fj be given as words in a finite generating set as the word problem in fj is decidable the case of f g can be computably verified we note that the elements of fj are computable functions in addition an element of fj is uniquely determined by its restriction to the rationals thus if f 6 g the minimal index i 0 such that f i 0 6 g i 0 exists and can be computably determined therefore the order is computable 2 4 positive cones if g is left ordered then the positive cone is the set of all positive elements of g we note that the positive cone is a semigroup in fact if g admits a linear order such that the positive elements generate a semigroup in g then the linear order is a left order on g see dnr 14 cr 16 lemma 2 9 let g g 1 g 2 be a finitely generated group with a fixed enumeration and be a left order on g then is computable if and only if its positive cone is recursively enumerable and the word problem in g is decidable proof if the order is computable then the word problem is decidable see remark 2 6 in addition there is a partial algorithm to confirm that a positive element given as a word in the generators of g is positive this implies that the positive cone is recursively enumerable on the other hand if the positive cone is recursively enumerable and the word problem decidable let w be a word in the generators of g we first computably determine whether or not w 1 if w 1 we stop otherwise either w or w 1 is in the positive cone of g as the positive cone is recursively enumerable there is a partial algorithm to confirm that a positive element is in the positive cone we simultaneously run this algorithm for w and w 1 as one of these elements is positive it stops for w or w 1 we thus know whether w is positive or negative this completes the proof embeddings into left orderable simple groups 7 2 5 dense orders a linear order on a set s is dense if for any g h s there exists g s such that g g h recall that by qj the set of the rational points on an interval j r we fix a recursive enumeration qj q 0 q 1 such that the natural order on qj is computable with respect to this enumeration lemma 2 10 cf theorem 2 22 of cr 16 let j r be an interval let s s 0 s 1 be a countable ordered set if the order on s is dense and does not have maximal and minimal elements then there is an order preserving bijection s qj if in addition the order on s is computable then the map i 7 si is computable we recall the proof of this lemma that we will later modify to prove lemma 6 8 proof we define s qj iteratively as sji 7 qji for i n first define sj 0 s 0 and qj 0 q 0 now assuming that sk sj 0 sjk and qk qj 0 qjk are already defined let us define its extension according to the following procedure 1 choose the smallest i such that si sk and set sk 1 sk si choose the smallest j such that qj qk and sk si qk qj is an order preserving bijection set sjk 1 si and qjk 1 qj 2 choose the smallest j such that rj qk 1 and choose the smallest i such that si sk 1 and 1 qk 1 qj sk 1 si is an order preserving bijection set sjk 2 si and qjk 2 qj 3 repeat the process starting from step 1 since the orderings of s and qj are computable with respect to the fixed enumerations the above described iterative procedure of defining is also computable therefore the map i 7 si qj is computable remark 2 11 if g is left ordered then the lexicographical left order on the group g q is dense and has no minimal or maximal elements in addition if g g 1 g 2 has a computable left order the lexicographical left order on g q is computable with respect to the induced enumeration moreover the standard embedding g g q that sends g 7 g 0 is computable and a frattini embedding 2 6 dynamical realization of computably left ordered groups let j be an interval in r we de note the group of homeomorphisms of j by homeo j and the subgroup of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of j by homeo j we note that for every interval j r every countable left ordered group g admits an embedding of g into homeo j see e g cr 16 2 4 dnr 14 proposition 1 1 8 we also note the following fact proposition 2 12 let g be a countable group 8 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock ifg is left orderable then there is an embedding g g homeo j such that for all g g 1 the map g g j j does not fix any rational interior point of j ifg is computably left orderable then in addition all the maps g g can be granted to be computable we actually need a strong variant of proposition 2 12 see proposition 6 7 but to the best of our knowledge the computability aspect of proposition 2 12 does not exist in the literature neither for this reason we decided to include a proof of proposition 2 12 we analyze computability aspects based on the proof given in cr 16 2 4 by remark 2 11 we may assume that the order on g is dense then by lemma 2 10 there is an order preserving bijection g qj definition 2 13 let g qj be an order preserving bijection we define g g homeo j by prescribing g gi h gih on the dense subset g qj j we note the following lemma 2 14 let g qj be an order preserving bijection the map g g homeo j is an embedding moreover if the map i 7 si is computable then for all i n g gi is computable lemma 2 15 let g qj be an order preserving bijection if x qj such that g g x x then g 1 proof indeed suppose that g g x x let h 1 x then by definition of g we have g x gh i e h gh but since g qj is a bijection h gh and g 1 proof of proposition 2 12 suppose g g 1 g 2 has a computable left order with respect to the given enumeration by lemma 2 10 we may assume that the map i 7 gi is computable by lemmas 2 14 and 2 15 g g homeo j satisfies the properties required by proposition 2 12 3 groups of piecewise homeomorphisms of flows we first collect definitions and facts on groups of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of flows from mbt 18 as every countable group embeds as a subgroup in a group of piecewise homeomorphisms of flows we then start to study such groups in more generality we recall from example 2 8 that a dyadic point in r is one of the form n 2 m for some n m z moreover for a dyadic interval j fj is thompson s group acting on j 3 1 minimal subshifts leta be a finite alphabet and a shift onaz ifx is a closed and shift invariant subset of az then x is a dynamical system that is called subshift a subshift is minimal if the set of orbits is dense in x embeddings into left orderable simple groups 9 let x be a minimal subshift of az then x is totally disconnected and hausdorff and every orbit is dense in x the suspension or mapping torus of x is the quotient of x r by the equivalence relation defined by x t n x t n n z we denote the corresponding equivalence class of x t x r by x t the map t that sends x s to x s t is a homeomorphism and defines a flow on the suspension flow so that is a dynamical system as well the orbits of the suspension flow are homeomorphic to the real line we denote by h the group of homeomorphisms of that preserves the orbits of the suspension flow and by h 0 the subgroup of h that in addition preserves the orientation on each orbit 3 2 the group t let c be a clopen subset of x and let j r be of diameter 1 the embedding of c j into x r descends to an embedding into that we denote by c j for every clopen c x and subset j of diameter 1 in r the map c j is a chart for the suspension whose image is denoted by uc j if z is in the interior of uc j then c j is a chart at z definition 3 1 dyadic chart let c be a clopen subset of x and let j be a dyadic interval of length 1 in r then c j c j is called dyadic chart definition 3 2 dyadic map a dyadic map is a map f of real numbers such that f x x c where is a power of 2 and c is a dyadic rational definition 3 3 definition 3 1 of mbt 18 the group t is the subgroup of h 0 consisting of all elements h h 0 such that for all z there is a dyadic chart c j at z and a piecewise dyadic map f j f j with finitely many breakpoints such that the restriction of h to uc j is given by x t 7 x f t we recall that fj denotes the group of piecewise dyadic homeomorphisms of j with finitely many breakpoints definition 3 4 let c j be a dyadic chart and let f fj then fc j is the map in t whose restriction to uc j is given by x t 7 x f t and that is the identity map elsewhere we let fc j be the subgroup of t generated by the elements fc j for all f fj the group t is infinite simple left ordered and finitely generated mbt 18 corollary c as noted in mbt 18 the first examples of such groups hl 19 are subgroups of t 10 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock in section 3 5 we revisit the proof of simplicity given in mbt 18 in section 3 6 we revisit the proof of left orderability given in mbt 18 to this end we note the following lemma 3 5 lemma 3 4 of mbt 18 for every z the t orbit of z is dense in the orbit of z in particular the t action on is minimal for any group h we denote by h the first derived subgroup of h lemma 3 6 lemma 4 8 of mbt 18 let c x be clopen and j r be dyadic if c j is covered by a family ci ji i i for clopen ci c and dyadic intervals ji j then f c j is contained in the group generated by i i f ci ji we assume without restriction that x is a minimal subshift over the two letter alphabet a 0 1 for k n z and a word w a 0 a 1 ak over a we denote by cn w the cylinder subset of x consisting of sequences xi i z such that xnxn 1 xn k w as a matter of fact the cylinder subsets are clopen and form a basis for the topology of x we note that cn w cn 1 w let i 0 1 4 1 2 and i 1 1 4 9 8 lemma 3 7 proposition 6 2 of mbt 18 the group t is generated by fx i 0 fc 0 0 i 1 and fc 0 1 i 1 in particular t can be generated by six elements 3 3 piecewise homeomorphisms and group embeddings definition 3 8 a bijection h i j of subsets i j r is a piecewise homeomorphism if there are half open pairwise disjoint intervals ii xi yi i 1 2 whose union is i for all of these ii the restriction of h to ii is a homeomorphism onto its image if in addition the intervals ii and h ii are dyadic we say that h has dyadic breakpoints if the restrictions of h to the intervals ii are dyadic maps we say that h has dyadic pieces if s is a set bij s denotes the group of permutations of s let us fix a half open interval j x y that is strictly contained in 0 1 let c j bij j denote the subgroup of all piecewise homeomorphisms with dyadic breakpoints on j the subgroup of c j of orientation preserving bijections is denoted by c j example 3 9 every countable group embeds into c j example 3 10 every countable left orderable group embeds into the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of j and therefore into c j embeddings into left orderable simple groups 11 since the set of non dyadic rational points of j is dense in j the next lemma is a basic property of the piecewise continuity lemma 3 11 every function in c j is uniquely determined by its values on non dyadic rational points on j moreover every function from c j is continuous at non dyadic rational points to construct respective embeddings into finitely generated simple groups we propose the following extension of the construction in mbt 18 3 4 groups of flows of piecewise homeomorphisms let us fix a subgroup g of c j definition 3 12 define j g bij as follows for each g g let j g g j where g j is defined by g j x t 7 x g t for all t j and g j is the identity map elsewhere we extend definition 3 3 as follows definition 3 13 the group t g let g be a subgroup of c j we define t g as the subgroup of bij generated by j g and t lemma 3 14 the group g embeds into t g by g 7 g j moreover if g is finitely generated then t g is finitely generated as well proof the second statement follows from the definition of t g and the fact that t is finitely generated for the first statement it is enough to notice that by definition g j is an identity map if and only if g 1 definition 3 15 non dyadic rational points a point x t is called a rational point on if t q if in addition t is not dyadic we say that x t is a non dyadic rational point lemma 3 16 there exists a dense and recursive set of non dyadic rational points in proof let us choose a recursive countable subsetx x 1 x 2 x that is dense inx for example the set of proper ternary fractions moreover for all i n let ri be defined as ri xi t t is rational and non dyadic we denote r i 1 ri note that each of ri is a recursive set therefore since x is also recursive by our choice the we get that r is recursive as well 12 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock lemma 3 17 if g is a subgroup of c j then the elements of t g are uniquely defined by their values on any countable dense set of non dyadic rational points of moreover the elements of t g are continuous at non dyadic rational points of proof by lemma 3 16 there a fixed countable dense set of non dyadic rational points in let r be such a set let us define x x such that for each x x there exists t q such that x t r since r is dense x is dense as well note that since x x is dense in x by lemma 3 5 the set x t x x t r is dense in therefore the elements of t g are uniquely defined by their restrictions to the orbits of the elements x 0 for x x now the lemma follows from the combination of this observation with lemma 3 11 3 5 simplicity and rigid stabilizers to prove simplicity results we use the following standard tool let y be a set and h a group acting faithfully on y then the rigid stabilizer of a subset u y is the subgroup of h whose elements move only points from u we denote the rigid stabilizer of u by rist u the following lemma is used to prove simplicity of t in mbt 18 cf mbt 18 lemma 2 1 lemma 3 18 let n be a normal subgroup of h if there is a non trivial element g n and a non empty subset u y such that g u u then the first derived subgroup rist u is in n a group g is called perfect if it coincides with its first derived subgroup that is g g g g lemma 3 19 if g c j is a perfect group then t g is simple proof assume that n is a normal subgroup of t h and n 6 1 the proof of lemma 3 19 follows from the following two claims claim 1 the group t is in n the proof of claim 1 follows the arguments of simplicity in mbt 18 proof of claim 1 let us fix a non trivial element g n then by lemma 3 17 there exists a non dyadic rational point y such that g y 6 y by lemma 3 17 the elements of t g j g t are continuous at the non dyadic rational points of therefore since is a hausdorff space and g y 6 y there exists an open neighborhood u of y such that gu u by lemma 3 18 rist u is in n let z and choose h t such that h z u such a map h exists as by lemma 3 5 the action of t on is minimal then as z h 1 u and rist h 1 u h 1 rist u h the rigid stabilizer rist h 1 u is in n as h 1 u is open there is a chart c k at z which is in h 1 u since fc k is in the rigid stabilizer of h 1 u we conclude that fc k n embeddings into left orderable simple groups 13 therefore for every chart c k there is a covering ci ki of c k such that fci ki is in n by lemma 3 6 we conclude that for every chart c k the group fc k is in n now we use that i k fi fk cf cfp 96 theorem 4 1 to conclude that the generators of t are in n claim 2 for every normal subgroup n of t g j g is in n proof of claim 2 let f f 0 1 be an element of thompson s group such that j f j then fx 0 1 is in t and separates ux j from ux f j by the previous claim fx j n therefore the first derived subgroup of the rigid stabilizer of the interior of ux j is in n by lemma 3 18 finally we note that j g is in the rigid stabilizer of the interior of ux j thus j g is in n as g is assumed to be perfect this yields the claim now to conclude the proof of lemma 3 19 we only need to combine the above claims with the fact that by definition t g j g t 3 6 left orders on t g lemma 3 20 ifg c j then the group t g is left orderable moreover ifg is finitely generated and consists of computable functions then there exists a left order on t g with recursively enumerable positive cone proof first of all note that since g c j the action of t g on orbits of elements of x is orientation preserving let r a 1 s 1 a 2 s 2 be a fixed recursively enumerated and dense subset of non dyadic rationals in the existence of such sets is by lemma 3 16 now for f t g define f 1 if for the smallest index k n such that f ak sk 6 ak sk we have f ak sk ak qk such that qk sk therefore by lemma 3 11 for all f 6 1 either f 1 or f 1 1 and for f 1 f 2 1 f 1 f 2 1 by lemma 3 17 the defined order is a left order on t g recall that the set r is recursive therefore to check whether f 1 we can consecutively compute the values f a 1 s 1 f a 2 s 2 we stop at the first k such that f ak sk 6 ak sk by lemma 3 17 this procedure stops if and only if f 6 1 and since g consists of computable maps this procedure recursively enumerates the positive cone of the above defined left order corollary 3 21 the group t has a left order with recursively enumerable positive cone 4 chart representations and the word problem in t g recall that j is a fixed interval that is strictly contained in 0 1 let us fix a subgroup g in c j and assume that g is finitely generated and consists of computable functions 14 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock 4 1 chart representations definition 4 1 chart representations let h t g a chart representation of h is a finite collection of triples ci ii ci ji hi where hi is a piecewise homeomorphism with countably many breakpoints on ii and hi ii ji such that uci ii and uci ji cover and such that the restriction of h to uci ii is the function x t 7 x hi t each of the triples ci ii ci ji hi is called a chart the maps hi are local representations of h remark 4 2 chart representations play the role of the partial tables of thompson in tho 80 remark 4 3 by definition compactness of x and every h t g has a chart representation remark 4 4 chart representations are not unique example 4 5 f fx 1 4 1 2 we give two chart representations for f 1 x 1 4 1 2 x 1 4 1 2 f x 1 2 3 4 x 1 2 3 4 id 2 x 0 1 2 x f 0 1 2 f 0 1

homeomorphisms fi ii ji j and gi ji ii 1 where all fi are dyadic maps fi 6 id whenever i 6 n and the gi are restrictions of non trivial elements of g remark 4 7 a g dyadic map could a priori be equal to the identity map definition 4 8 canonical chart representations let h t g and let ci ii ci ji hi 16 i 6 n be a chart representation of h such that for every hi 1 i n one of the following takes place i hi is a dyadic map on ii ii hi f is the composition a dyadic map f and a g dyadic map then the representation ci ii ci ji hi 16 i 6 n is called canonical also charts for which hi corresponds to i or ii are called charts of type i or ii respectively 4 2 operations on charts the following operations can be applied to go from one chart representation to another definition 4 9 inverse let ci ii ci ji hi 16 i 6 n be a chart representation of h t g then ci ji ci ii h 1 i 16 i 6 n is a chart representation of h 1 and is called the inverse of the initial one embeddings into left orderable simple groups 15 definition 4 10 refinements the following operations on charts are called refinement 1 if i i 0 i 1 then c i c j f can be replaced by c i 0 c f i 0 f i 0 and c i 1 c f i 1 f i 1 2 if j j 0 j 1 then c i c j f can be replaced by c f 1 j 0 c j 0 f f 1 j 0 and c f 1 j 1 c j 1 f f 1 j 1 3 if c c 0 c 1 then c i c j f can be replaced by c 0 i c 0 j f and c 1 i c 1 j f definition 4 11 reunions a reunion is the inverse operation of a refinement definition 4 12 shifts a shift of order m z is replacing a triple c i c j f by m c i m m c j m t 7 f t m m remark 4 13 a chart representation obtained by a refinements reunion or a shift on its charts corre sponds to the same element from t g in particular chart representations of elements from t g are not unique remark 4 14 since the functions in g are computable the operations 4 9 4 10 4 11 and 4 12 are computable lemma 4 15 t g is finitely generated and each of the generators can be represented by a canonical chart representation which can be algorithmically determined proof indeed the generators of t given by lemma 3 7 can be represented as in example 4 5 one then applies a finite number of chart refinements at the breakpoints of the generating piecewise dyadic maps to obtain a canonical chart representation the generators of g can be represented by a canonical chart representation by definition lemma 4 16 the inverse refinements and shifts preserve the canonicity of chart representations proof we will prove only that shift operations on charts of type ii preserve the canonicity of chart representations as the rest of statements of the lemma are straightforward suppose that the initial chart of type ii on which a shift operation of order m is applied is ci ii ci ji then a shift of order m would transform it into the chart m ci ii m m ci ji m where ii m ji m is defined as x x m m suppose that fg 1 f 1 gnfn is decomposed as in definition 4 6 then f g 1 f 1 gnf n where f n x fn x m and f x f x m the chart is also a g dyadic map therefore m ci ii m m ci ji m satisfies the definition of charts of type ii from definition 4 8 thus shift operations applied on charts of type ii of canonical chart representations preserve the canonicity 16 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock definition 4 17 composition let ci ii ci ji fi 16 i 6 n and c i i i c i j i f i 16 i 6 m be chart representations such that ii j i 0 1 then we say that the chart representation ci j ii j ci j ji j fi j 16 i 6 mn where ii j f 1 i j i ij i i ji j fj f 1 i j i ij jj ci j ci cj and fij fj j i ij f i f 1 i j i ij is their composition remark 4 18 note that if in definition 4 17 the chart representations correspond to f f t g respectively then the composition chart representation corresponds to ff remark 4 19 note that if the two chart representations in definition 4 17 are canonical then their composition is canonical as well in addition finding the composition is a computable procedure lemma 4 20 let h t g be given by a canonical chart representation ci ii ci ji hi 16 i 6 n then there is an algorithm to determine a canonical chart representation c j i j c j j j h i 16 j 6 n of h such that j j 0 1 proof we describe the algorithm for 1 6 i 6 n if ji 0 1 do nothing go to i 1 if ji 0 1 and ji 0 1 is non empty let ji 1 ji 0 1 ji 2 ji 0 1 and apply a refinement definition 4 10 2 repeat from the beginning if ji 0 1 is empty determine m such that ji m 0 1 is non empty and apply a shift of order m definition 4 12 repeat from the beginning since this procedure does not affect charts of type 2 from definition 4 8 by lemma 4 16 the canonicity of the initial chart representation is preserved lemma 4 21 let h t g be given by a canonical chart representation ci ii ci ji hi 16 i 6 n then there is an algorithm to determine a canonical chart representation c j i j c j j j h i 16 j 6 n of h such that i j 0 1 proof the proof is analogous to the proof of lemma 4 20 lemma 4 22 there is an algorithm that for any two elements f f t g given by their canonical chart representations computes a canonical representation of ff proof by lemmas 4 20 and 4 21 there exists an algorithmic procedure that computes canonical chart representations ci ii ci ji fi 16 i 6 n and c i i i c i j i f i 16 i 6 m of respectively f and embeddings into left orderable simple groups 17 f such that ii j i 0 1 then their composition will be a canonical chart representation of ff see remarks 4 18 and 4 19 from the previous two lemmas we get lemma 4 23 there exists an algorithm that for any input f t g given as a word in finite set of generators outputs a canonical chart representation of f in particular every element from t g has a canonical chart representation proof it follows from remark 4 18 lemma 4 22 and the fact that the standard generators of t g have canonical chart representations see lemma 4 15 4 3 the word problem the following observations are useful for studying the groups t g lemma 4 24 let h t g and let ci ii ci ji hi 16 i 6 n be a chart representation of h then h 1 in t g if and only if for all 1 6 i 6 n we have hi id and ji ii proof let 1 6 i 6 n recall that h maps x t to x hi t for x t ci ii as h 1 x hi t x t thus for any x ci and t ii there is m z such that m x t m x hi t we conclude that hi t t m and m x x but is a minimal subshift that is every orbit of is dense in particular m 0 therefore hi id this yields one side of the assertion the inverse assertion is trivial lemma 4 25 if there is an algorithm to decide whether a g dyadic map is equal to the identity then the word problem in t g is decidable proof by lemma 4 23 for every h t g one can algorithmically find a canonical chart repre sentation for h by lemma 4 24 h 1 if and only if for any canonical chart representation of h the corresponding charts of types i and ii are identity charts if hi a local representation in a chart of type i hi is a piecewise dyadic map with finitely many breakpoints so that we can algorithmically check whether hi id now suppose that h f i i is a local representation in a chart of type ii where f i 0 i is dyadic and in i 0 a g dyadic map we note that h id on i if and only if f id on i 0 in fact f is a g dyadic map so that by assumption we can algorithmically check whether h id corollary 4 26 t is computably left orderable in particular the word problem in t is decidable proof by lemma 4 25 the word problem is decidable by corollary 3 21 t has a recursively enumerable positive cone thus by lemma 2 9 t is computably left orderable 18 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock 5 embeddings into perfect groups our next goal is to prove the following theorem 5 1 every countable group g embeds into a finitely generated perfect group h in addition 1 if g is computable then h has decidable word problem 2 if g is left ordered then h is left ordered 3 if g is computably left ordered then the left order on h is computable 4 the embedding is a frattini embedding moreover in case 2 and 3 the order on h continues the order on g this strengthens neu 60 gla 81 theorem 10 a and tho 80 theorem 2 3 if g is assumed to be finitely generated assertion 1 is proved in tho 80 theorem 2 3 examples of finitely generated left ordered and perfect groups are well known see ber 91 we first prove theorem 5 1 for finitely generated groups in section 5 4 we reduce the general case to the finitely generated case 5 1 splinter groups let us assume that g is a finitely generated group we now construct a finitely generated perfect group in which g embeds our construction resembles the splinter group construction of tho 80 2 we comment on the construction of tho 80 in section 5 5 let us fix an action of t on the real line as follows let us fix z 0 x 0 0 as the action of t on preserves the orbits t acts on the orbit of z 0 the action is orientation preserving and its orbits are dense finally recall that the orbit of z 0 is homoemorphic to r we fix such a homeomorphism this induces an action of t on r we fix this action of t let c 0 r g denote the group of functions from r to g of bounded support the action of t on r induces an action of t on c 0 r g such that for every h c 0 r g and f t f h s h f 1 s the permutational wreath product g or t is defined as the semi direct product c 0 r g o t where for h 1 f 1 and h 2 f 2 c 0 r g o t h 1 f 1 h 2 f 2 h 1 f 1 h 2 f 1 f 2 for every g g we define the following function g in c 0 r g g s g for s 1 2 1 1 otherwise and g g g g definition 5 2 splinter groups the splinter group is the subgroup of the permutational wreath product g or t generated by g and t we denote it by sp g embeddings into left orderable simple groups 19 recall that t and g are finitely generated we note the following lemma 5 3 the group g embeds into sp g with image g moreover sp g is finitely generated lemma 5 4 the splinter group sp g is perfect to prove lemma 5 4 we adapt the arguments of the proof of tho 80 theorem 2 3 we first prove lemma 5 5 the group g is in the first derived subgroup sp g of sp g proof let f 1 and f 2 t be such that f 1 maps 1 2 1 onto 1 4 1 and f 2 maps 1 2 1 onto 1 4 1 2 respectively the existence of such elements follows from the definition of t we note that for any g g f 1 gf 1 1 s f 1 g s g for s 1 4 1 1 otherwise f 2 gf 1 2 s f 2 g s g for s 1 4 1 2 1 otherwise therefore g f 1 gf 1 1 f 2 gf 1 2 1 hence g is a commutator element this completes the proof proof of lemma 5 4 since t is simple it is in sp g by lemma 5 5 g is in sp g as well therefore sp g sp g lemma 5 6 the group g isometrically embeds into sp g proof let x and y be finite generating sets of g and t respectively we prove that the embedding of g x into sp g x y by g 7 g is an isometric embedding where x is the image of x in sp g let g g also let fi t and gi g 1 i n be such that g f 1 g 1 fng n and g x y n i 1 fi x y n i 1 g i x y where is the length of the group element with respect to the corresponding generating set we have g g 1 h 1 g 2 h 2 g n hnhn where hi f 1 fi 1 i n therefore it must be that hn 1 and g 1 2 g i i gi 20 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock where i 1 n is the set of indexes i such that hi 1 2 1 2 1 thus we get g i i g i therefore since we have g x y n i 1 fi x y n i 1 g i x y we get f 1 fn 1 and i 1 n which implies that g x g x y since g is an arbitrary element of g the last conclusion finishes the proof lemma 5 7 the embedding of g into sp g by g 7 g is a frattini embedding proof let g h g and suppose that g and h are conjugate in sp g we want to show that g is conjugate to h in g there exist e c 0 r g and f t such that e f g e f 1 h or equivalently e f g e 1 h therefore we have supp e f g e 1 supp h 1 2 1 on the other hand supp e f g e 1 supp f g f supp g f 1 2 1 thus f 1 2 1 1 2 1 which implies that f g g recall that g is constant on 1 2 1 and hence eg e 1 h the last equality immediately implies that g is conjugate to h in g 5 2 the word problem for sp g we recall that t is computably left ordered acts order preservingly on r and that this action is computable we adapt a notion of splinter table introduced in tho 80 p 413 definition 5 8 splinter table a splinter table corresponding to the element t f sp g is a finite tuple of the form j 1 jn g 1 gn f where j 1 jn is a disjoint finite collection of bounded intervals from r whose union contains the support of t r g such that t ji gi g example 5 9 the group g coincides with the set of all splinter tables 1 2 1 g 1 t g g and t coincides for example with the set of all splinter tables 1 2 1 1 g f f t lemma 5 10 if t f s e sp g are given by their splinter tables then their product t f s e can be represented by a splinter table the product splinter table can be computably determined proof suppose that the splinter tables of t f and s e correspondingly are j 1 jn g 1 gn f and i 1 im h 1 hm e let j 16 i 6 n ji and i 16 j 6 m ij embeddings into left orderable simple groups 21 let r q t f s e then q fe and r t f s is a step function such that for all 1 6 i 6 n and for all 1 6 j 6 m r ji f ij gihj r ji f i gi r f ij j hj and the identity elsewhere by the properties of t the inverse of f as well as ji f ij ji f i and f ij j can be computably determined corollary 5 11 every element of sp g can be represented by a splinter table note that j 1 jn g 1 gn f is a splinter table corresponding to the trivial element of sp g if and only if g 1 gn 1 and f 1 therefore combining this observation and lemma 5 10 with the fact that the word problem of t is decidable corollary 4 26 we immediately get the following lemma 5 12 if the word problem for g is decidable then so is the word problem for sp g 5 3 left orders now let g be left ordered we then define a left order on sp g as follows cf neu 60 gla 81 let t f sp g be given as a splinter table j 1 jn g 1 gn f see corollary 5 11 if t 6 1 then without loss of generality we let j 1 be the leftmost interval such that t j 1 6 1 i e g 1 6 1 we set t f 1 if either f 1 in t or if f 1 and g 1 1 in g as the action of t on r is orientation preserving this defines a left order on sp g we conclude lemma 5 13 if g is left ordered then so is sp g the order on sp g continues the order on g lemma 5 14 if g is computably left ordered then so is sp g the order on sp g continues the order on g proof we fix a computable left order on t see corollary 4 26 let t f sp g first run the algorithm for the word problem see lemma 5 12 if t f represents the identity stop otherwise check whether or not f is positive negative or the identity in the first two cases we are done otherwise we can computably determine the leftmost maximal interval j of the splinter representation of t f such that t j 6 1 then we use that the left order on g is computable to determine whether or not t j is positive or negative 5 4 embeddings into finitely generated groups to conclude the proof of theorem 5 1 we need the following result of dar 15 see also dar 19 theorem 3 for more details on assertions 1 3 theorem 5 15 every countable group g embeds into a 2 generated group h in addition 22 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock 1 if g is computable then h has decidable word problem 2 if g is left ordered then h is left ordered 3 if g is computably left ordered then the left order on h is computable 4 the embedding of g into h is a frattini embedding moreover the left order on h continues the left order on g here we briefly explain why the embedding from dar 15 is a frattini embedding proof of assertion 4 of theorem 5 15 as it is shown in section 2 of dar 15 for g g 1 g 2 the embedding satisfying theorem 5 15 has the following properties it embeds g into a two generated subgroup c s of the group g o z o s where z and s are infinite cyclic groups such that gi goes to c cs 2 i 1 g o z s moreover the element c cs 2 i 1 regarded as a map s g o z has support 1 in addition c cs 2 i 1 1 is a map z g such that c cs 2 i 1 1 1 gi now assume that for two elements g h g their images in c s are conjugate let g and h be the images of g and h in c s respectively in particular g and h are elements of the form c cs 2 i 1 let f sn c s g o z o s be such that f sn g f sn 1 h then we get fg s n f 1 h which implies that supp fg s n f 1 supp g 1 on the other hand supp fg s n f 1 supp g s n s n therefore n 0 hence g 1 is conjugate to h 1 in g o z repeating this argument one more time with respect to the pair g 1 h 1 g o z and using the fact that g 1 1 g and h 1 1 h we get that g is conjugate to h in g since g h g are arbitrarily chosen elements from g we get that the embedding from dar 15 that satisfies theorem 5 15 is frattini proof of theorem 5 1 by theorem 5 15 we assume without loss of generality that g is 2 generated let h be the splinter group sp g then g embeds into h and h is finitely generated by lemma 5 3 moreover h is perfect by lemma 5 4 assertion 1 follows from lemma 5 12 assertion 2 follows from lemma 5 13 assertion 3 follows from lemma 5 14 assertion 4 follows from lemma 5 7 5 5 thompson s splinter group revisited we compare definition 5 2 with thompson s definition of a splinter group tho 80 definition 2 1 let x be a cantor set whose elements are represented as infinite sequences in letters 0 and 1 we note that the so called thompson s group v is exactly the group ft x defined in tho 80 p 405 in fact v is an infinite finitely generated simple group that acts on x tho 80 proposition 1 5 corollary 1 9 embeddings into left orderable simple groups 23 we note that the splinter group of tho 80 is the subgroup of g ox v generated by v and the functions g from x to g that take the value g on all sequences starting with 01 and the identity elsewhere lemma 5 4 corresponds to tho 80 theorem 2 3 and lemma 5 12 to tho 80 proposition 2 7 unfortunately the group v and hence the splinter group of tho 80 are not left orderable 6 embeddings of left ordered groups let j be a dyadic interval in 0 1 since every left ordered group embeds as a subgroup into homeo j we have the following proposition 6 1 every countable left ordered group g embeds into a finitely generated left ordered group h in addition the order on h continues the order on g proof let g be countable left orderable group then by theorem 5 1 g embeds into a finitely generated perfect left orderable group g 1 on its own turn since g 1 is left orderable it embeds into homeo j let g 2 homeo j such that g 2 is isomorphic to g 1 let h t g 2 see definition 3 13 by lemmas 3 14 3 19 and 3 20 h has the required properties we now construct an embedding as in the previous proposition that in addition is frattini and isometric provided that g is finitely generated as required by remark 1 1 and that has the computability properties required by theorem 2 to achieve this we modify the construction of proposition 2 12 of embeddings of left ordered groups into homeo j 6 1 dyadic parts definition 6 2 for any r 2 k p q q 0 where p and q are odd integers we call r d k the dyadic part of r we observe lemma 6 3 let c 6 0 x q and d x d 6 c d then x c d min d x d c d also x d d x d definition 6 4 let i and j be fixed intervals and g qi qj be a bijection then we say that g is strongly permuting the dyadic parts if the following two conditions take place 1 for each m z there exists at most one x qi such that x d m and g x d 0 2 if x 1 6 x 2 qi and x 1 d x 2 d then g x 1 d 6 g x 2 d if g is a bijection from i to j when we say that g is strongly permuting the dyadic parts if it maps rational points to rational points and its restriction g qi qi qj satisfies definition 6 4 24 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock remark 6 5 if g qi qj is strongly permuting the dyadic parts then for each m z the set g x d x qi x d m is unbounded from above let us consider for 0 i 6 n bijective dyadic maps fi ii ji such that fi x ix ci where i is a power of 2 and for all i 0 n ci 6 0 and bijective maps gi ji ii 1 whose restriction to qji strongly permutes the dyadic parts lemma 6 6 if g 1 f 1 g 2 f 2 gnfn then for large enough n n the set x d x qin x d n is unbounded from above in particular 6 id proof we will prove the lemma by induction on n let n 1 then x g 1 1 x c 1 if c 1 0 or n c 1 d and x 1 d x 2 d n then by lemma 6 3 1 x 1 c 1 d 1 x 2 c 1 d the statement now follows as g 1 strongly permutes the dyadic parts see remark 6 5 next let n 1 then x g 1 1 2 x c 1 where 2 g 2 f 2 gnfn and c 1 6 0 by inductive assumption for any large enough n there exists a sequence xi i 1 such that xi d n and limi 2 xi d by lemma 6 3 for any large enough index i 1 2 xi c 1 d c 1 d hence the lemma follows as g 1 strongly permutes the dyadic parts 6 2 the modified dynamical realization let j be a fixed closed interval in r with non empty interior we prove proposition 6 7 let g be a countable group if g is left orderable then there is an embedding g homeo j such that for all g g 1 the map g j j is strongly permuting the dyadic parts and does not fix any rational interior point of j if g is computably left orderable then in addition all the maps g can be taken to be computable as in the proof of proposition 2 12 we fix a recursive enumeration qj q 0 q 1 such that the natural order on qj is computable with respect to this enumeration we first strengthen lemma 2 10 that states that there is an order preserving bijection g qj lemma 6 8 if g is enumerated and densly left ordered then there is an enumeration g gi 1 gi 2 and an order preserving bijection g qj such that 1 for odd j gij d n and gij d 6 gik d 1 6 k j 2 for even j gij 6 gikg 1 il gim 1 6 k l m j embeddings into left orderable simple groups 25 3 ifg is computably left ordered then the enumerationg gi 1 gi 2 and the map j 7 gij are computable proof let g 1 g 0 g 1 g 2 and qj 0 r 0 r 1 r 2 be fixed recursive enumerations we define g 0 7 r 0 and gij 7 rij where gi 1 gi 2 and ri 1 ri 2 are permutations of g 1 g 2 and r 1 r 2 respectively defined recursively as follows step 2 n 1 let g 2 n gi 1 gi 2 n and q 2 n ri 1 ri 2 n be already defined let us define gi 2 n 1 as the element of the smallest index that is not in g 2 n suppose that gis gi 2 n 1 git and that no element from g 2 n is in between gis and git then define ri 2 n 1 qj to be of the smallest index such that o 1 ri 2 n 1 q 2 n and ris ri 2 n 1 rit o 2 ri 2 n 1 d n and ri 2 n 1 d rij d 1 j 2 n step 2 n 2 let g 2 n 1 gi 1 gi 2 n 1 and q 2 n 1 ri 1 ri 2 n 1 be already defined let us define ri 2 n 2 as the rational of the smallest index that is not in q 2 n 1 suppose that ris ri 2 n 2 rit and that no element from q 2 n 1 is in between ris and rit then let us define gi 2 n 2 g as the element of the smallest index such that e 1 gi 2 n 2 g 2 n 1 and gis gi 2 n 2 git and e 2 gi 2 n 2 gikg 1 il gim 1 k l m 2 n 1 the bijection defined this way is order preserving by o 1 and e 1 condition o 2 yields assertion 1 and e 2 yields assertion 2 finally as the procedure is algorithmic we also obtain assertion 3 proof of proposition 6 7 by remark 2 11 we may assume that the order on g is dense let the enumera tion g g 0 g 1 and g qj satisfy the assertions of lemma 6 8 then g qj induces the embedding g g homeo j according to g g h gh for g h g denote g let h g 1 by lemmas 2 14 and 2 15 we only need to show that h is strongly permuting the dyadic parts to this end we enumerate qj such that gi ri and let ri 6 rj qj we define rk h ri hgi and rl h rj hgj so that gk hgi and gl hgj we first show property 1 of definition 6 4 by contradiction assume that there exist i 6 j such that ri d rj d and rk d rl d n since rk d rl d n the indices k and l are even then since gk hgi hgj g 1 j gi and gl hgj hgi g 1 i gj by 2 of lemma 6 8 the largest index is among i or j let j i then since ri d rj d we get the index j is even since gj gi hgi 1 hgj again by 2 of lemma 6 8 we get a contradiction which yields the claim next we prove property 2 of definition 6 4 by contradiction assume that there exist ri 6 rj qj such that ri d rj d and suppose that rl d rk d without loss of generality l i j k if say j i k l then instead of h we could consider h 1 then since rk d rl d by 1 of lemma 6 8 l has to be even therefore since hgj rl and l is even by 2 of lemma 6 8 26 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock hgj 6 gmg 1 n gp 1 6 m n p j on the other hand since l i j k we get hgj hgi g 1 i gj a contradiction this completes the proof of proposition 6 7 6 3 the embedding theorems let g be countable left orderable group then by theorem 5 1 g embeds into a finitely generated perfect left orderable group g 1 moreover this embedding is a frattini embedding let j 1 4 1 2 since g 1 is left orderable there is an embedding g 1 homeo j let g 2 g 1 by proposition 6 7 we can assume that the non trivial elements of g 2 homeo j strongly permute the dyadic parts and do not fix any rational interior point of j for the definition of g 2 dyadic maps see definition 4 6 lemma 6 9 let be a g 2 dyadic map if g 2 has decidable word problem then there is an algorithm to decide whether or not id proof let n 0 and for all 0 6 i 6 n let ji j and let gi ji ii 1 be the restriction of an element of g 2 such that gi 6 id moreover let fi ii ji given by fi x ix ci be dyadic maps such that fi 6 id since for all 0 i n ji 1 4 1 2 and by definition i is a power of 2 we get that ci 6 0 for 0 i n then by lemma 4 25 g 1 f 1 g 2 f 2 gnfn 6 id if n 1 and f 1 id then g 1 g then we decide using the algorithm for the word problem in g combining lemmas 5 6 and 6 9 we also conclude the following lemma 6 10 the embedding g 1 t g 2 is isometric lemma 6 11 the embedding g 1 t g 2 is a frattini embedding proof let h g g 2 and t t g 2 we assume that ht 1 gt 1 we represent t by a canonical chart representation ci ii cj ji ti such that i ji 0 1 and represent t 1 by ci ji ci ii ti we recall that ti ii ji let k be a index such that 1 2 is in the closure of jk and such that after applying a chart refinement if necessary jk j as g is fixing 1 2 there is j k jk such that g j k jk and such that 1 2 is in the closure of j k we let i k t 1 k j k and i k t 1 k gtk i k then the triple c i k c i k t 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of t 1 gt up to applying the algorithm of lemma 4 20 to this chart representation we may assume that i k is in 0 1 moreover up to applying a chart refinement if necessary we may assume that either i k j is empty or consists of one point 1 4 or 1 2 or i k j embeddings into left orderable simple groups 27 if i k j is empty or consists of one point then c i k c i k t 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of ht 1 gt thus t 1 k gtk id on i k by lemma 4 24 this implies that g acts as the identity on j k since non trivial elements of g 2 do not fix any rational interior points of j the element g 1 otherwise the triple c i k c h i k ht 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of ht 1 gt thus ht 1 k gtk id on i k by lemma 4 24 then h i k i k this is only possible if i k j but then lemma 6 9 implies that tk acts as an element of g 2 since non trivial elements of g 2 do not fix any rational interior points of j this implies that g and h are conjugate in g 1 we can now conclude theorems 1 2 and 4 proof of theorems 1 2 and remark 1 1 we let h t g 2 the group h is finitely generated left orderable and simple by lemmas 3 14 3 20 and 3 19 by construction g embeds into h and the order on h extends the order on g moreover by lemma 6 11 the embedding of g is a frattini embedding if g is computably left ordered we may in addition assume that g 1 is computably left ordered see theorem 5 1 by proposition 6 7 for all g g 1 g is computable therefore by lemma 2 9 the positive cone of h is recursively enumerable moreover by lemma 6 9 and lemma 4 25 the group h has decidable word problem by lemma 2 9 the left order on h is computable proof of theorem 4 let g be finitely generated left orderable group with a recursively enumerated positive cone if g has decidable word problem then the left order on g is computable by lemma 2 9 then theorem 2 implies that g embeds into a finitely generated computably left ordered simple group h in particular the word problem in h is decidable thus h can be defined by a recursively enumerable set of relations by bg 09 theorem d h embeds into a left orderable finitely presented group on the other hand if h is a finitely generated simple subgroup of a finitely presented group then it has decidable word problem see ls 77 theorem 3 6 therefore g has decidable word problem as well 7 embeddings of computable groups in this section we prove theorem 3 the isometric version of thompson s theorem tho 80 in appendix we present yet another proof of theorem 3 that using the setting of our paper mimics the original idea of tho 80 theorem 7 1 every computable group g frattini embeds into a finitely generated simple group h with decidable word problem if g is finitely generated then the embedding is isometric remark 7 2 the original statement tho 80 is for finitely generated groups but finite generation can be replaced by computability of g due to theorem 5 15 28 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock 7 1 the embedding construction let g be a computable group by theorem 5 1 g embeds into a finitely generated perfect group g 1 with decidable word problem if g is finitely generated this claim also follows from tho 80 2 let g 1 g 1 g 2 be enumerated so that m n n n defined as m i j k if g i g j g k is computable by remark 2 3 the existence of such m is equivalent to decidability of the word problem let us fix two recursively enumerated recursive sets of dyadic numbers x 1 x 2 and y 1 y 2 such that the following takes place 1 0 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 1 3 2 xi and yi are of the form m 2 n and m 1 2 n respectively 3 limi xi 1 3 let us denote di xi yi and j 0 1 3 t i 1 di for every l n let l j j be such that for every k n it is an affine map from dk onto dm l k and that is identity outside of i 1 di in particular the map l dk dm l k is dyadic remark 7 3 the maps l j j l n are computable and continuous at non dyadic points also they have finitely many dyadic breakpoints outside of any open neighborhood of 1 3 let us define g 1 c j by g l l for all l n remark 7 4 the map is an embedding of g 1 into computable maps in c j let g 1 f 1 g 2 f 2 gnfn in i 0 where fi ii ji and gi ji ii 1 be a g 2 dyadic map as in definition 4 6 recall that in particular we have ji j 0 13 for 1 i n we say that is a special g 2 dyadic map if for each 1 i n we have 1 3 j i closure of ji correspondingly we say that a chart of type ii see definition 4 8 is special if the local representation in this chart is of the form f 0 where is a special g 2 dyadic map the following lemma is a direct consequence of remark 7 3 and of the fact that the maps fi gi 1 i n are computable lemma 7 5 there exist a finite collection of intervals k 1 k 2 ks 0 13 such that ki i 0 is a special g 2 dyadic map moreover such intervals k 1 k 2 ks can be found algorithmically lemma 7 6 if h i j is a surjective dyadic map such that 1 3 is in the closures of i and j and i j 0 1 3 then h is the identity map proof the lemma follows from the fact that 1 3 is non dyadic by lemma 7 6 we have embeddings into left orderable simple groups 29 corollary 7 7 special local representations are of the form f 0 g 1 f 1 in particular if a special g 2 dyadic map or a special chart of type ii fixes 1 3 then it acts as an element of g 2 since the word problem for g 2 is decidable this implies that there exists an algorithm that decides whether or not a special g 2 dyadic map represents the identity map this combined with lemmas 7 5 and 4 25 leads to the following corollary corollary 7 8 the word problem in t g 2 is decidable 7 2 frattini property the embedding g t g 2 is frattini lemma 7 9 the embedding g 1 t g 2 is a frattini embedding we adapt the proof of lemma 6 11 proof let h g g 2 and t t g 2 we assume that ht 1 gt 1 we represent t by a canonical chart representation ci ii cj ji ti such that i ji 0 1 and represent t 1 by ci ji ci ii t 1 i we recall that ti ii ji let k be a index such that 1 3 is in the closure of jk and such that after applying a chart refinement if necessary jk j as g is fixing 1 3 there is j k jk such that g j k jk and such that 1 3 is in the closure of j k we let i k t 1 k j k and i k t 1 k gtk i k then the triple c i k c i k t 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of t 1 gt up to applying the algorithm of lemma 4 20 to this chart representation we may assume that i k is in 0 1 moreover up to applying a chart refinement if necessary we may assume that either i k j is empty or consists of one point 1 3 or i k j if i k j is empty or consists of one point 1 3 then c i k c i k t 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of ht 1 gt thus t 1 k gtk id on i k by lemma 4 24 this implies that g acts as the identity on j k as 1 3 is in the closure of j k this implies that g 1 otherwise the triple c i k c h i k ht 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of ht 1 gt thus ht 1 k gtk id on i k by lemma 4 24 but then tkht 1 k g j k j k has to be the identity as well as g is fixing 1 3 tkht 1 k has to fix 1 3 if tk was dyadic i e of type i it would have to fix 1 3 so that tk id by lemma 7 6 if tk is of type ii we may assume that tk is special see lemma 7 5 then by corollary 7 7 tk acts as an element of g 2 thus g and h are conjugated by elements of g 2 this implies that g and h are conjugated in g 1 combining lemma 7 9 with lemma 5 7 we obtain corollary 7 10 the embedding g t g 2 is frattini lemma 7 11 the embedding g 1 t g 2 is an isometric embedding 30 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock proof we fix a finite generating set x for g 1 and denote the generating set of t given by lemma 3 7 by y we denote the union of the bijective images of x and y in t g 2 by z and recall that z generates t g 2 we assume that all generating sets are symmetric we denote by a the word metric with respect to the generating set a let g g 2 and let t z 1 zm be a reduced word in the alphabet z that represents g 1 t g 2 so that tg 1 in addition we assume that m g z we represent every generator zi by a canonical chart representation see lemma 4 15 lemma 4 23 then gives a canonical chart representation ci ii ci ji ti for t recall that the maps ti are compositions ti h 1 hmi where each map hj is a local representation in the canonical chart representation of a generator in z and mi 6 m in addition up to applying the algorithm of lemma 4 20 to this chart representation of t we may assume that ii 0 1 let ik be an interval such that 1 3 is in the closure of ik and such that after applying a chart refinement if necessary ik j then ci g 1 ik ci ji tig is in a canonical chart representation of the identity by lemma 4 24 tig is the identity mapping in particular g 1 ik ji so that ji j and 1 3 is in the closure of ji we note that ti is not dyadic i e of type i by lemma 7 6 if ti fg 1 f 1 gnfn is a chart of type ii then by lemma 7 5 we may assume that ti is special thus ti g 1 gn g 2 lemma 7 6 where n 6 mi 6 m thus we may assume that ti xj 1 xjmi g 2 then g x 6 mi 6 m g z we conclude that the embedding is isometric combining lemma 7 11 with lemma 5 6 we obtain corollary 7 12 if g is finitely generated then the embedding g t g 2 is isometric proof of theorem 7 1 the simplicity of t g 2 follows from lemma 3 19 from corollary 7 8 the word problem in t g 2 is decidable provided that it is decidable in g 2 by corollary 7 10 the embedding g t g 2 is frattini by corollary 7 12 it is an isometric embedding provided that g is finitely generated therefore the embedding g t g 2 satisfies theorem 7 1 appendix a thompson s embedding revisited here we adapt the original embedding construction of tho 80 to the setting of our paper and note that in addition it is an isometric embedding theorem a 1 every computable group g frattini embeds into a finitely generated simple group h with decidable word problem moreover if g is finitely generated the embedding is isometric embeddings into left orderable simple groups 31 remark a 2 the original statement tho 80 is for finitely generated groups but finite generation can be replaced by computability of g due to theorem 5 15 a 1 the embedding construction let g be a computable group by theorem 5 1 g embeds into a finitely generated perfect group g 1 with decidable word problem if g is finitely generated this claim also follows from tho 80 2 let g 1 g 1 g 2 be enumerated so that m n n n defined as m i j k if gigj gk is computable by remark 2 3 the existence of m is equivalent to decidability of the word problem let j 1 2 1 for strictly positive k n let ik 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 22 k we observe that any two such intervals are disjoint we denote by i lk the left half of the interval and by i r k the right half so that i lk 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 22 k 1 and irk 2 k 1 2 k 1 22 k 1 2 k 1 2 k 1 22 k for every l n let l j j be the piecewise homeomorphism whose pieces are dyadic and that for every k n maps irk onto i r m l k and that is the identity map elsewhere on j let us define g 1 c j by gl l for all l n remark a 3 the map is an embedding of g 1 into computable maps in c j remark a 4 if gl is fixing a right half irk then gl 1 indeed then m l k k so that glgk gk a 2 g 2 dyadic maps let g 2 g 1 we study g 2 dyadic maps see definition 4 6 let j j be an interval such that the closure of j contains 1 we want to prove lemma a 5 there is an algorithm to decide that a g 2 dyadic map j j is equal to the identity remark a 6 our definition of follows the construction in tho 80 3 the main arguments to prove lemma a 5 cf lemma a 9 a 10 a 11 and a 13 below are essentially those of tho 80 3 remark a 7 we assume that the closure of in i 0 and jn j 0 of definition 4 6 contains 1 this is no restriction in generality indeed if g 1 f 1 gnfn and ii 1 equivalently ji does not contain 1 then gi ji ii 1 has only finitely many dyadic pieces on ii therefore a finite sequence of chart subdivisions at the breakpoints of gi on ii transforms fi 1 gifi into a finite number of dyadic maps thus we can algorithmically split into a finite number of g dyadic maps of n factors 1 lemma a 8 let gnfn g 1 f 1 j j be a g 2 dyadic map then all dyadic factors fi of fix 1 32 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock proof by contradiction let f fi be a dyadic map such that f 1 6 1 up to inverting f 1 1 this contradicts the definition of g 2 dyadic maps definition 4 6 for n z we write sn x 2 nx 1 2 n all dyadic maps that fix 1 are of this form note that sn m sn sm we call n the degree of sn lemma a 9 let n 6 0 and let g g 2 then for all k n gsn and sn are equal on irk moreover sng acts as the identity on at most finitely many irk proof let n 0 and k n direct computations show that s n i r k 2 k n 1 2 k n 1 22 k n 1 2 k n 1 2 k n 1 22 k n i lk n since by definition g acts trivially on i lk n we get gs n coincides with s n on i r k similarly irk sn i l k n so that sn i r k n does not intersect with i r l for any l 0 thus by definition g acts trivially on sn irk n and gsn coincides with sn on i r k n in addition as g permutes the intervals irk sng acts as the identity on at most finitely many i r k let m 0 and for all 1 6 i 6 m let gi 6 1 in g 2 and ni 6 0 in n let us fix gmsnm g 1 sn 1 to be a g 2 dyadic map as in lemma a 5 let s 0 id s 1 sn 1 and recursively si snisi 1 lemma a 10 if for all i m si 6 id and k is strictly larger than the degree of si then acts as gmsm on irk in particular 6 id proof let k be strictly larger than the degree of si for all i m by lemma a 9 as k n 1 g 1 sn 1 equals to sn 1 on i r k thus restricted to these intervals gmsnm g 1 sn 2 n 1 equals to by induction this yields the first assertion we show that gmsnm n 1 6 id on all but finitely many of the intervals irk if snm n 1 6 id this is by lemma a 9 otherwise gmsnm n 1 gm 6 id which yields the claim by remark a 4 if m 0 let i 0 be the smallest index such that ni 0 n 1 0 and recursively define ij to be the smallest index such that nij nij 1 1 0 let im be the largest such index m lemma a 11 if nm n 2 n 1 0 then equals to gmgim gim 1 gi 1 gi 0 on all but a finite number of intervals irk which can be algorithmically determined otherwise 6 id proof if m 0 the claim follows by lemma a 10 let m 0 by lemma a 9 gmsnmgm 1 gi 1 and are equal on i r k unless k is smaller than the degree of si for some i 6 i 0 inductively gmsnmgm 1 gij and gmsnmgm 1 gij 1 1 sij 1 1 equal on embeddings into left orderable simple groups 33 irlj gij 1 gi 0 i r k unless lj is smaller than the degree of si for some ij 1 i 6 ij finally gmsnm im 1 and gmsnmgm 1 gim 1 sm 1 are equal on ilm gim gi 0 irk unless lm is smaller than the degree of si for some im 1 i 6 im let g gim gim 1 gi 1 gi 0 we conclude that is equal to gmsm im 1 g on all but a finite number of intervals irk as the degree of the si is computable we can algorithmically determine these intervals if sm im 1 id this concludes the proof otherwise by lemma a 9 acts as snm im 1 g on all but finitely many intervals i r k thus 6 id by lemma a 9 corollary a 12 there is an algorithm to decide whether is the identity on the intervals irk in j proof by lemma a 11 there is a computable number k 0 0 such that for all k k 0 id on irk if and only if gmgim gi 1 gi 0 1 as the word problem in g is decidable this can be algorithmically determined on the other hand for each k there is an obvious algorithm to decide whether or not acts as the identity on irk we apply this algorithm for each k k 0 this completes the proof lemma a 13 let x j k 1 m i 0 s 1 i i r k then x sm x proof since for all k x 6 s 11 i r k we have that x gmsmn gn 2 sn 2 sn 1 x by induction x sm x which is the claim proof of lemma a 5 by lemma a 8 all dyadic factors in a g 2 dyadic map fix 1 we first compute the degree of sm if the degree of sm is not 0 then lemma a 11 implies that 6 id otherwise lemma a 13 implies that is the identity on j k 1 m i 0 s 1 i i r k let 0 6 i 6 m we argue that there is an algorithm to decide whether or not is the identity on the intervals s 1 i i r k in j this will complete the proof let x s 1 i i r k and let y i r k be the point such that x si y we note that x x if and only if siy siy if and only if s 1 i si y y therefore we need to decide whether or not the g 2 dyadic map s 1 i si is the identity on the intervals i r k such that s 1 i i r k j let k 0 0 be the smallest index such that for all k k 0 irk si j as si j can be algorithmically determined k 0 can be computed as well thus we need to decide whether or not s 1 i si is the identity on the intervals irk in 2 k 0 1 2 k 0 1 by corollary a 12 such an algorithm exists a 3 frattini property to conclude thompson s theorem theorem a 1 we also need lemma a 14 the embedding g 1 t g 2 is a frattini embedding the proof of this lemma is analogous to the proof of lemma 6 11 proof let h g g 2 and t t g 2 we assume that ht 1 gt 1 we represent t by a canonical chart representation ci ii cj ji ti such that i ji 0 1 and represent t 1 by ci ji ci ii ti we recall that ti ii ji 34 arman darbinyan and markus steenbock let k be an index such that 1 is in the closure of jk and such that after applying a chart refinement if necessary jk j as g is fixing 1 there is j k jk such that g j k jk and such that 1 3 is in the closure of j k we let i k t 1 k j k and i k t 1 k gtk i k then the triple c i k c i k t 1 k gtk is in a canoncial chart representation of t 1 gt up to applying the algorithm of lemma 4 20 to this chart representation we may assume that i k is in 0 1 moreover up to applying a chart refinement if necessary we may assume that either i k j is empty or consists of one point 1 or i k j if i k j is empty or consists of one point then c i k c i k t 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of ht 1 gt thus t 1 k gtk id on i k by lemma 4 24 this implies that g acts as the identity on j k as 1 is in the closure of j k this implies that g 1 otherwise c i k c h i k ht 1 k gtk is in a chart representation of ht 1 gt thus ht 1 k gtk id on i k by lemma 4 24 but then tkht 1 k g j k j k has to be the identity as well as g is fixing 1 tkht 1 k has to fix 1 if tk does not fix 1 h acts up to applying finitely many chart refinements if necessary as a dyadic map on i k but it has to fix t 1 k 1 thus h acts as the identity on i k this implies that g 1 by remark a 3 otherwise by lemma a 11 there are gim gi 0 g 2 such that on all but finitely many of the intervals irj the maps h 1 t 1 k gtk equals to h 1 g 1 i 0 g 1 im ggim gi 0 by remark a 4 this implies that h and g are conjugated in g 1 moreover the embedding of thompson is also an isometric embedding lemma a 15 the embedding g 1 t g 2 is an isometric embedding proof we fix a finite generating set for g 1 this gives a finite generating set for g 2 we denote by h the word metric of h let g g 2 and t t g such that tg 1 we represent t by finitely many canonical charts ci ii ci ji ti such that ii 0 1 we note that ti 6 t let ik be the interval such that 1 is in the closure of ik and such that after applying a chart refinement if necessary ik j then ci g 1 ik ci ji tig is in a canonical chart representation of tg by lemma 4 24 tig is the identity mapping in particular g 1 ik ji so that ji j and 1 is in the closure of ji if ti is a dyadic map then ti id lemma a 9 and thus g 1 if ti g 2 then g t 1 i and g ti 6 t otherwise ti g 1 f 1 gnfn is a g 2 dyadic map moreover by remark a 4 we may assume that all dyadic maps fi fix 1 thus by lemma a 11 g gi 1 gm thus g 6 m 6 f we conclude that the embedding is isometric combining lemma a 15 with lemma 5 6 we obtain embeddings into left orderable simple groups 35 corollary a 16 if g is finitely generated then the embedding g t g 2 is isometric proof of theorem a 1 by lemmas a 5 and 4 25 the group t g 2 has decidable word problem this group is also finitely generated and simple see lemmas 3 14 and 3 19 by construction g embeds into t g 2 remark a 17 if g is non computably left orderable with decidable word problem it is open
