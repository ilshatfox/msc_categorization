finitely presented torsion free groups with decidable word problem that cannot be embedded in any finitely gener ated group with decidable conjugacy problem this answers a well known question of collins from the early 1970 s 1 introduction in this article we construct torsion free groups with decidable word problem that cannot be embedded in groups with decidable conjugacy problem hence answering the following question first asked by collins in the early 1970 s question 1 can every torsion free group with decidable word prob lem be embedded in a group with decidable conjugacy problem probably the first source where this question was posed in a written form is 3 this question also appears in the 1976 edition of the kourovka notebook as problem 5 21 11 other sources with this question include 2 16 17 let g x be a group with a given finite generating set x if we consider the elements of x x 1 as formal letters and denote by x x 1 the set of finite words from the alphabet x x 1 then each finite word from x x 1 in a natural way corresponds to an element ing and vice versa for each element g g there exists a word in fact countably many words w x x 1 that corresponds to g in which case we write w g 1 it is said that g has decidable word problem if there exists an algorithm that for each w x x 1 decides whether or not w g 1 it is said that g has decidable conjugacy problems if there exists an algorithm that for each pair of words u v x x 1 decides whether or not u and v represent conjugate elements in g decidability of the conjugacy problem obviously implies the decidability of the word problem nevertheless in general the inverse is not true 14 5 the word and conjugacy 1 http arxiv org abs 1708 09047 v 2 problems along with the group isomorphism problem are considered as the central decision problems in combinatorial and geometric group theory and they were first studied by max dehn in 1911 see 7 the connections between the word and conjugacy problems have been stud ied extensively by various authors the first examples of finitely generated groups with decidable word problem but undecidable conjugacy problem were constructed by miller iii 14 and by collins 5 for other early results about connections between the word and conjugacy problems in groups see for example 6 10 15 it was mentioned by collins in 11 that due to an example by macintyre there exists a finitely generated group with torsions and decidable word prob lem which cannot be embedded into a finitely generated group with decidable conjugacy problem however the case for torsion free groups remained open until now indeed one of the reasons why the torsion and torsion free cases are different is based on the observation that conjugate elements in a group must have the same order and since in a torsion free group all non trivial elements have the same infinite order for torsion free groups one cannot make use of this observation to answer question 1 we resolve question 1 with theorem 1 below theorem 1 there exists a finitely generated torsion free group g with decid able word problem such that g cannot be embedded into a group with decidable conjugacy problem moreover g can be chosen to be a solvable group of derived length 4 or a finitely presented group in 17 olshanskii and sapir showed that if in addition to the word problem the power problem is also solvable in a group then the group embeds into a group with decidable conjugacy problem another evidence for the seemingly positive answer to the question of collins was a well known theorem of osin stating that every torsion free countable group embeds into a two generated group with exactly two conjugacy classes 18 in 13 miasnikov and schupp observed that every finitely generated group with recursively enumerable presen tation and finite number of conjugacy classes has decidable conjugacy problem it follows from theorem 1 and from the observation of miasnikov and schupp that osin s theorem cannot be improved so that it preserves the property of having recursively enumerable presentation two disjoint sets of natural numbers s 1 s 2 n are called recursively in separable if there is no recursive set t n such that s 1 t and s 2 n t the set t is called separating set clearly if two disjoint sets are recursively inseparable then both of them are non recursive indeed if say s 1 is recursive then as a recursive separating set one could simply take s 1 nevertheless it is well known that there exist recursively enumerable and recursively inseparable pairs of sets see 20 one of the key ingredients in the proof of theorem 1 is the utilization of the recursively enumerable recursively inseparable sets up to our knowledge this is the second time after a result of miller iii 15 corollary 3 9 that this concept was utilized to produce a new result in a group theoretical 2 setting the method used for obtaining the main result of the current paper was later applied by the author to answer other open questions as well 9 acknowledgement i would like to thank alexander olshanskii for his thought ful comments on this work 2 countable groups with decidable word prob lem suppose that g x where x x 1 x 2 then let us denote wpx g w x x 1 w g 1 we call the setwpx g the word problem of g with respect to the enumerated generating set x x 1 x 2 we say that wpx g is decidable if there exists an algorithm that for any input n 1 n 2 nk k n ni n i 1 k decides whether or not the word x 1 n 1 x 1 n 2 x 1 nk represents the trivial element of g if wpx g is decidable then we say that the word problem of g is decidable with respect to the enumerated generating set x let i n i be a bijection where i is a recursive set then we say that the word problem in g is decidable with respect to the enumeration x xi 1 xi 2 we denote wp x i g if there exists an algorithm that for any input i n 1 i n 2 i nk k n ni n i 1 k decides whether or not the word x 1 i n 1 x 1 i n 2 x 1 i nk represents the trivial element of g in case i n i is computable the decid ability of wp x i g is equivalent to the decidability of wpx g traditionally the word problem in groups is defined with respect to finite generating sets the main advantage of the finite generating sets is that in this case the decidability of the word problem does not depend on a particular choice of generators and their enumeration hence the decidability becomes a group intrinsic property rather than being dependent on the enumerated generating set the groups with decidable word problems with respect to countable infinite enumerated sets were independently introduced in slightly different terms by rabin 19 and mal cev 12 and are called in literature by the more common name of computable groups if a finitely generated group has decidable word problem with respect to a equivalently any finite generating set then it is said that the group has decidable word problem the following embedding theorem is from 8 theorem 2 1 8 let g x x x 1 x 2 such that the word problem wpx g is decidable then there exists an embedding x g h c s of g into a two generated group h such that the following holds 3 1 the word problem is decidable in h 2 the map n 7 x xn is computable where x xn is represented as a word from c 1 s 1 3 if g is torsion free then so is h 4 if g is a solvable group of derived length l then h is a solvable group of derived length l 2 remark 1 parts 1 and 4 of theorem 2 1 are explicitly stated in theorem 1 and corollary 2 in 8 however even though 2 and 3 are not stated explicitly they follow from the fact that the embedding in 8 embeds countable group g x notations differ there into a two generated subgroup h c s of g z z by x xn 7 c c s 2 n 1 see page 5 in 8 the computability properties of the word problem in h strongly depend on the generating set x and its enumeration 3 the construction in order to show the existence of g from theorem 1 first we will construct a countable but not finitely generated group g with decidable word problem then g will be defined as a group in which g embeds in a certain way let us fix two disjoint recursively enumerable and recursively inseparable sets n n 1 n 2 n and m m 1 m 2 n such that the maps i 7 ni and i 7 mi are computable for all n n define the group an as a free abelian additive group of rank two with basis an 0 an 1 that is an an 0 an 1 and such that the groups a 1 a 2 are disjoint for all n n define the groups a n as follows a n an if n n m an an 1 2 ian 0 if n ni n an an 1 3 ian 0 if n mi m for all n n define the group bn as a free abelian additive group of rank 2 that is bn bn 0 bn 1 such that b 1 b 2 are disjoint now for all n n define the groups b n as follows b n bn if n n m bn bn 1 2 ibn 0 if n ni n or n mi m 4 for all n n and 0 1 let us denote the images of an under the natural homomorphisms an a n by a n analogously the image of bn under the natural homomorphism bn b n we denote by b n it follows from the definitions of a n and b n that for all n n these groups are infinite and torsion free convention below whenever a group g is given with a generating set s depending on the context we either consider s s 1 as a subset of g or we consider it as a set of formal letters i e alphabet that can form finite words for example if g is an additive abelian group and a b s then ab 1 and b 1 a are finite words over the alphabet s s 1 that represent the element a b g lemma 1 there exists an algorithm such that for each input n n and w a 1 n 0 a 1 n 1 it decides whether or not w represents the trivial element in the group a n analogous statement also holds for the groups b n with respect to the generating sets b n 0 b n 1 proof indeed since a n is abelian with generating set a n 0 a n 1 each word w from a 1 n 0 a 1 n 1 can be algorithmically transformed to a word of the form w a n 0 0 a n 1 1 0 1 z that represents the same element of a n as the initial word w now assuming that 0 6 0 1 6 0 in order for w to represent the trivial element in a n it must be that n n m because if otherwise then by definition the group a n is free abelian of rank 2 with basis a n 0 a n 1 in case n n by definition we have that a n 1 2 xa n 0 where x is the index of n in n i e n nx similarly in case n m by definition we have that a n 1 3 xa n 0 where x is the index of n in m i e n mx now if 0 0 and 1 0 then clearly w hence also w represents the trivial element in a n therefore without loss of generality let us assume that at least one of 0 and 1 is not 0 then if we treat x as an unknown variable depending on whether n nx or n mx the equality w 0 would imply one of the following equations 0 12 x 0 1 or 0 13 x 0 2 respectively this observation suggests that in case 0 6 0 or 1 6 0 in order to verify whether or not w 0 in a n we can first try to find x satisfying 1 or 2 and in case such an x does not exist conclude that w hence also w does not 5 represent the trivial element in a n otherwise if x is the root of the equation 1 we can check whether or not n nx since n is recursively enumerable this checking can be done algorithmically similarly if x is the root of the equation 2 we can check whether or not n mx if as a result of this checking we get n nx respectively n mx then the conclusion will be that w hence also w represents the trivial element in a n otherwise if n 6 nx respectively n 6 mx then the conclusion will be that w hence also w does not represent the trivial element in a n the proof of the same statement for the groups b n is identical define a n 1 a n b n 1 b n g 0 a b and c n 1 cn where c 1 c 2 are pairwise disjoint infinite cyclic groups denote s 0 a n 0 a n 1 b n 0 b n 1 n n and s 1 c 1 c 2 lemma 2 the word problems wps 0 g 0 and wps 1 c are decidable proof let us denote s 0 a a n 0 a n 1 n n and s 0 b b n 0 b n 1 n n since by definition g 0 is the direct sum of a and b the decidability of wps 0 g 0 is equivalent to the decidability of both wps 0 a a and wps 0 b b on its own turn the decidability ofwps 0 a a andwps 0 b b is an immediate consequence of lemma 1 the decidability of wps 1 c is obvious let c aut g 0 such that for i n ci is the automorphism of g 0 that fixes all elements from g 0 except the ones from a ni b ni g 0 and for 0 1 it flips a ni and b ni that is ci a ni 7 b ni and ci b ni 7 a ni the elements ci aut g 0 i n pairwise commute thus is the induced homomorphism from c to aut g 0 now define g as the semidirect product of g 0 and c with respect to that is g g 0 c denote s a n 0 a n 1 b n 0 b n 1 cn n n 6 lemma 3 the group g is torsion free and metabelian also for every i n n and s s 0 we have c 1 i sci cisc 1 i b ni if 0 1 n ni n and s a ni a ni if 0 1 n ni n and s b ni s otherwise proof the group g is a semidirect product of two torsion free abelian groups hence it is torsion free and metabelian the second statement follows from the definitions of the semidirect product the automorphism ci g 0 g 0 and from the identities a ni 1 2 ia ni 0 b ni 1 2 ib ni 0 and cisc 1 i ci s c 1 i sci ci 1 s ci s lemma 4 the word problem wps g is decidable proof note that every word from s s 1 can be algorithmically transformed into a word of the form eu 11 e uk k uk 1 that represents the same element of g where e 1 ek s 0 s 1 0 and u 1 uk 1 s 1 s 1 1 on the other hand by lemma 3 for all i n and s s 0 s 1 0 c 1 i sc 1 i is equal to some s s 0 s 1 0 moreover since the sets n n 1 n 2 and m m 1 m 2 are recursively enumerated s can be algorithmically verified therefore every word of the form eu 11 e uk k uk 1 on its own turn can be algorithmically transformed into a word of the form e 1 e kuk 1 that represents the same element of g as the initial word where e 1 e k s 0 s 1 0 finally the words of the form e 1 e k uk 1 represent the trivial element of g if and only if the word e 1 e k represents the trivial element of g 0 and uk 1 represents the trivial element of c by lemma 2 the last conditions can be checked algorithmically therefore the word problem wps g is decidable let us introduce the enumeration i s n of the set s i s 5 n 1 1 if s a n 0 5 n 1 2 if s a n 1 5 n 1 3 if s b n 0 5 n 1 4 if s b n 1 5 n if s cn denote x x 1 x 2 where xn i 1 n n n x and s coincide as sets but have differing enumerations the essential property of i is that it is a computable bijection which implies that wpx g is decidable now suppose that x g h is an embedding of the group g into a two generated torsion free group h such that it satisfies the properties from theorem 2 1 in particular the maps 1 and 2 defined as 7 1 n 7 a n 2 n 7 b n and 3 n 7 cn where n n 0 1 are computable and h has decidable word problem as the next lemma shows the group h has the desirable properties we were looking for lemma 5 the group h cannot be embedded in a finitely generated group with decidable conjugacy problem proof by contradiction let us assume that h embeds in a finitely generated group h that has decidable conjugacy problem then for the purpose of con venience without loss of generality let us assume that h is a subgroup of the group h below we show that the decidability of the conjugacy problem in h contra dicts the assumption that n and m are recursively inseparable let us define c n as c n n a n 0 is conjugate to b n 0 in h since the above described maps 1 2 and 3 are computable and h has de cidable conjugacy problem there exists an algorithm that for any n n verifies whether or not a n 0 is conjugate to b n 0 in h therefore the set c is recursive note that for all i n since by lemma 3 the identity c 1 i a ni 0 ci b ni 0 holds we get that a ni 0 is conjugate to b ni 0 in h therefore n c since for groups with decidable conjugacy problem one can algorithmically find conjugator element for each pair of conjugate elements of the group recur siveness of c implies that there exists a computable map f c h such that for all n c we have f n 1 a n 0 f n b n 0 for example one can define f n as the element of h that corresponds to the lexicographically smallest conjugator word composed by finite generator letters of h for n c let us denote f n hn h now let us define a n c h 1 n a n 1 hn b n 1 n 8 since the word problem in h is decidable the set c is recursive and the maps and f are computable we get that the set a is a recursive subset of n also since a ni 1 2 ia ni 0 b ni 1 2 ib ni 0 and c 1 i a ni 0 ci b ni 0 for i n in g we get that each conjugator of the pair a ni 0 b ni 0 is also a conju gator for the pair a ni 1 b ni 1 therefore since n c we get n a on the other hand since for each mi m we have a mi 1 3 ia mi 0 b mi 1 2 ib mi 0 we get that the pairs of elements a mi 0 b mi 0 and a mi 1 b mi 1 cannot be conjugated in h by the same conjugator therefore we get that a m thus we got that a n is a recursive set such that n a and a m however this contradicts the assumption that n and m are recursively inseparable lemma 5 is proved finally note that since g is metabelian by property 4 of theorem 2 1 h is a solvable group of derived length 4 therefore lemma 5 asserts that there exists a solvable group of derived length 4 that satisfies the statement of theorem 1 also by a version of higman s embedding theorem described by aanderaa and cohen in 1 the group h can be embedded into a finitely presented group g with decidable word problem as chiodo and vyas showed in 4 the group g defined this way will also inherit the property of torsion freeness from the group h sinceh cannot be embedded into a group with decidable conjugacy problem this property will be inherited by g thus
