shift spaces topological entropy i introduction modern technology and more in general modern society relay on computer systems in which information is processed and represented in form of binary strings the problem of transmission and storage of huge amount of data in the form of binary series has become one of the main interest of information science and modern mathematics usually these binary series are subjected to some logical constraint so that not all the binary sequences may be allowed and there may be sets of forbidden words practical examples of this situations are the memorization of information onto magnetic supports such hard disks where these sequences are stored in a series of tracks which must have a preamble or a end identified by a well defined sequence of bits sometimes it is convenient to fill the space among two strings with a succession of zeroes error detection and correction codes both in the problem of storage and transmission of information require some sequences of bits to be forbidden another main field of research in which bits sequences require to be subjected to some constraint are the problems connected to the security of data stored and transmitted when a computer system is protected through a password or when the data transmission is performed through cryptography it may be of relevance to know how many different sequences among the bit sequences of a given length and subjected to constraints may be generated another interesting discipline in which this kind of problems are of relevance is the field of dynamical systems symbolic dynamics allows the representation of the time evolution of a dynamical system through a discrete succession of two or more symbols in which all the essential information about the dynamical system and in general its physical properties are preserved one example is the concept of entropy that for a given symbolic representation of a dynamical system may be directly related to the rate of growth of the number of different sequences with the length of the sequence in this paper we discuss some of these aspects using the language of shift spaces in particular we show how many of these problems may be expressed and solved in terms of fibonacci like recurrent relations in a simple intuitive and amenable way finally we relate the limit ratios of such sequences to the topological entropy of the corresponding shift space and show how can be created a shift space with a predetermined entropy ii shift spaces and forbidden blocks all of the above mentioned problems may be better expressed in a rigorous mathematical language through the concept of shift space 1 even if the main interest of this paper regards binary sequences some results are immediately extendable to sequences of more than two symbols thus we start our discussion recalling the concept of shift space over a finite alphabet of k symbols given a finite alphabet a a 0 a 1 ak 1 of k symbols and the set of integers z the full shift is defined as the set of bi infinite sequences of az defined by az x xi i z xi a for all i z 1 also at slacs cnr infm and infn at physics department cagliari university electronic address roberto tonelli dsf unica it tonelli eecs berkeley edu http arxiv org abs 0708 4370 v 1 mailto roberto tonelli dsf unica it tonelli eecs berkeley edu 2 namely the set of all functions from z to a on this set a left shift is naturally defined as the function defined by az az x i xi 1 for all i z 2 a finite sequence of length m symbols drawn from a is called a block over a m block xi xi m 3 and its length is indicated by the norm xi xi m m an m block made by repetition of a single symbol is indicated am where a a is repeated m times a shift space x is a subset of the full shift in which not all the sequences of k symbols are allowed a shift space may be identified or defined in two main and equivalent ways one can give the set fx of all forbidden blocks in the sequences of symbols or one can give what is called the language of the shift space namely the collection bn x of all the allowed words of any length n here are some examples x is the set of all binary bi infinite sequences where the block 11 is not allowed this is called the golden mean shift x is the set of all binary sequences such that each pair of ones is separated by an even number of zeroes thus the collection of forbidden blocks takes the form f 102 n 11 n 0 thus in any shift space that is not the full shift not all the sequences of symbols will appear consider as the simplest case an alphabet of two symbols that we identify through the two bits one and zero if we refer to the arguments introduced above we see how any of the problems discussed may be related to the identification of the appropriate shift space furthermore it is easy to see that in the case of dynamical systems forbidden and allowed blocks correspond to forbidden or allowed transitions among different physical states and to forbidden and allowed physical behaviors in particular one can calculate the topological entropy 2 of a shift space associated to a dynamical system by counting the different allowed words of a given length and examining how this number grows when the length tends to infinity 1 h lim n log bn x n 4 in the next section we relate these numbers to different series of fibonacci like sequences iii the number of allowed words of length n for different shift spaces a golden mean shift and fibonacci sequence the golden mean shift is a shift space defined by only one forbidden block f 11 5 examining all the sequences allowed one may check that they consist only of isolated ones separated apart by at least one zero one may think of this shift space as of all the sequences of bits stored onto an hard disk in which zeroes are need for timing purposes or of all the transmitted sequences of bits with humming distance 1 or of one dynamical system in which the trajectory must escape immediately form one of the two possible states in which it may exist and so on thus it is interesting both for practical purposes and from a theoretical point of view to calculate the number n of different strings of length n of such form here we show first by induction and next by a constructive scheme that this number is exactly the nth fibonacci number n fn where the relation fn fn 1 fn 2 holds lemma 1 let n be the number of different blocks of length n for the golden mean shift then n fn where fn is the n th fibonacci number proof for n 1 is 1 2 and for n 2 is 2 3 thus we deal with fibonacci numbers with initial conditions f 0 1 and f 1 2 alternatively we may choose to set n fn 1 with initial conditions f 0 1 and f 1 1 the first step is to check that 3 2 1 5 and this is done immediately next supposing that n n 1 n 2 is valid we show that n 1 n n 1 must be valid too in fact given a string of n bits we may construct all the allowed strings of length n 1 of the same type by adding the bit zero or the bit one at the end of each length n allowed string adding a zero presents no problems it may be added to any of the n strings obtaining n strings of length n 1 terminating by zero the bit one may be added only to strings of length n terminating by zero since the couple the block 11 is not allowed thus adding one at the end we obtain a number of strings of length n 1 terminating by the two block word 01 3 table i 1 2 2 3 3 5 4 8 0 00 00 0 000 0 1 01 01 0 010 0 10 10 0 100 0 0 01 001 0 1 01 101 0 00 01 01 01 10 01 now we may think of these strings as compound strings of initial n 1 bits and of two final bits equal to 01 the n 1 bits part since it is followed by zero has no other constraint than the forbidden block 11 and thus there are n 1 of such compound strings thus the adding one process provides exactly n 1 strings of length n 1 ending by the word 01 the total number of allowed strings of length n 1 is given by those obtained adding zero plus those obtained adding one namely we get n 1 n n 1 6 after the hypothesis n n 1 n 2 all the reasoning will be even clearer when constructing from scratch the recursive relation a look at table i shows a constructive demonstration in the columns from one to four are illustrated all the different configurations of an n block n 1 2 3 4 for the golden mean shift the construction process starts with columns one and two where the cases with n 1 2 are reported next we build all the 3 blocks starting from all the allowed blocks with n 2 we may obtain such blocks adding the bit one or the bit zero to all the 2 3 strings with n 2 the bit zero may be added at the end of each string giving the first 2 3 blocks with n 3 ending by zero the bit one due to the exclusion of the block 11 may be added only to the 2 blocks ending by zero thus any string obtained in this last way will have length n 3 and will end with the block 01 then we may think of all such strings as made by a first part of length 3 01 3 2 1 where all the possible configurations allowed for the golden mean shift are present and the last part made by the block 01 the number obtained in this way is of course 3 01 2 the total number of newly generated strings will thus be 2 1 the same reasoning is applied when we want to build all the allowed 4 blocks starting from all the allowed 3 blocks in table i the strings are represented leaving a space in the sequences in order to easily identify the strings obtained adding zero and those obtained adding one b t 2 shift and lame numbers in the golden mean shift each one is isolated and separated by at leas one zero from others here we examine a shift space in which each one is again isolated but separated by at least two zeroes from others we call it t 2 shift 3 and it is described through the following forbidden blocks ft 2 011 101 110 111 7 again these numbers may represent a scheme for storing bit sequences where at least two zeroes must separate each single one like all the transmitted sequences of bits with humming distance 2 or one dynamical system in which the trajectory must escape immediately form one of the two possible states in which it may exists and presents a latent time of at least two before returning into the same state like a quantum system with a discrete set of states each one with its own decay time and so on we calculate the number n of different strings of length n of such form this number is given by a recurrence series similar to the fibonacci numbers where the relationship is n fn with fn fn 1 fn 3 these numbers constitute a series known as lame series 4 that is 1 2 3 4 6 9 13 19 28 we first construct a table ii for this case and then provide a demonstration by induction we start writing the first three columns in which the allowed strings with n ranging from one to three are reported next we want to obtain all the allowed strings with n 4 and the constrain that each appearing one must be separated from others by at least two zeroes starting from all the 3 blocks we may add the bits 1 or 0 at the end the adding zero step is allowed for any 3 block and gives 3 4 blocks of length n 4 satisfying the constraints 4 table ii 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 6 5 9 0 00 000 000 0 0000 0 1 01 010 010 0 0100 0 10 100 100 0 1000 0 001 001 0 0010 0 0 001 0001 0 1 001 1001 0 00 001 01 001 10 001 the digit one may be added only to the 3 blocks ending with at least two zeroes namely with the block 00 thus providing 4 blocks ending by the block 001 where the preceding part is of length 4 001 4 3 1 in which each allowed configuration must be present the reasoning is perfectly similar to the previous section thus when adding the digit one we obtain a number 4 001 4 3 1 of different allowed strings the total is 4 3 1 the same happens when we start from 4 blocks to build allowed 5 blocks adding the digits zero and one adding zero gives the new 4 strings ending by zero and adding one corresponds to add the block 001 to all the strings of length 5 3 2 the new number is 5 4 2 and the recurrence relationship is n n 1 n 3 thus we have the following lemma 2 let n be the number of different blocks of length n for the t 2 shift then n fn where fn is the nth lame number and the recursive relationship n n 1 n 3 holds proof it is 1 2 2 3 3 4 thus we are using lame numbers with these initial conditions we already checked that 5 4 2 next given n n 1 n 3 to obtain the number of allowed strings of length n 1 we have to add a digit to the n allowed strings with n digits if the digit is 0 there are no problems and we obtain new n strings of length n 1 adding the digit 1 we must eliminate all the strings ending not by 00 then all these blocks must terminate by the three digits block 001 and may be thought as made of this last three digits and by a first n 1 3 digits part in which all the allowed n 2 configurations which satisfy the given constraints are allowed thus under the hypothesis made we obtain n 1 n n 2 and the recurrence relationship holds for any n c tm shifts with two symbols let denote with tm the shift spaces where a 0 1 with the constrain that the allowed sequences are made of isolated ones separated by at least m zeroes it is straightforward to generalize to such shift spaces the recurrence relationship as n n 1 n m 8 lemma 3 let n be the number of different blocks of length n for the tm shifts then n fn where fn is the nth number of the recursive relationship fn fn 1 fn m with opportune initial conditions proof to obtain all the sequences of length n 1 from the allowed n blocks we may add zero getting new n allowed strings or we may add one to add one we must take into account that it must be added only to those strings ending by m zeroes obtaining n 1 blocks ending with the block 0 m 1 that may be added to any one of the n m allowed blocks of length n m and this gives new n m strings it is worth noting that in the limit n all of these recurrence series may be solved using the correspondent recurrence equation 5 to obtain the limit ratio fn fn 1 k so that the n th terms may be expressed as a limit fn f 0 kn for the fibonacci series this limit is the golden section 1 5 2 that may be obtained from the corresponding polynomial recurrence equation n n 1 n 2 9 2 1 as the greatest root 5 table iii m k 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 21 2 5 2 2 3 21 5 3 3 5 41 9 5 4 11 461 13 8 6 21 1281 33 13 9 43 10501 69 21 13 85 36121 121 34 19 171 246141 250 55 28 341 968561 526 fn fn 1 2 2 5 2 for the other recurrence series it holds a similar rule so that the limit may be recovered as the greatest root of the corresponding polynomial recurrence equation m 1 m 1 10 iv more than two symbols and different constraints next we briefly examine some cases in which the alphabet contains more than two symbols or has different con straints a k symbols same kind of constraints let a contain k symbols that we assume to be 0 1 k 1 we set as constraint the condition that each symbol except zero must appear isolated and separated by at least m zeroes from symbols other than zero we indicate these shift spaces tm k lemma 4 to these shift spaces are associated recurrence series with opportune initial conditions which give the number of different allowed configurations n for a string of length n according to the relationship n n 1 k 1 n m 1 11 proof to create the n 1 blocks we add one of the k symbols to the blocks of length n zero may be added to any block giving n new n 1 blocks for each of the k 1 symbols different from zero we obtain strings of length n 1 made of two parts the first part has length n m and is one of the n m allowed strings of that length the last part contains one of the k 1 blocks of the form 0 ma where a is one of the k 1 symbols different from zero thus there are a total of k 1 possibilities of adding these final blocks in queue of any allowed n m block the total provides the number of length n 1 allowed blocks as n 1 n k 1 n m that is the same as eq 11 for k 2 and m 1 one recovers the fibonacci series and for k 2 and m 2 the lame series all the recurrence series of such form have a limit ratio among two adjacent terms when n and this limit is the largest root indicated by 0 from now on of the polynomia associated to the recurrence series as can be obtained with the same technique used for the fibonacci series n n 1 k 1 n m 1 12 m 1 m k 1 this allows to select the values for the couple m k such that the largest root has a prefixed value consider for example the cases a m 1 k 3 b m 1 k 21 c m 2 k 5 in table iii are listed these and some other series for various initial conditions let consider a the limit ratio among two adjacent terms tends to the value 2 in fact the equation 13 becomes 2 1 3 1 with largest root 0 2 for example one can use m 2 and set 2 1 k 1 then choosing a given value for 0 one can solve for k such that the limit ratio is that value of 0 with k natural number the other examples are b such that the limit ratio be 5 and c such that the limit ratio be again 2 but with different m the formula 13 leaves ample freedom for fixing the desired m and and solve for the correspondent k 6 b three symbols different kind of constraints next we fix a 0 1 2 and we allow for the symbols one and two to be next to each other such that f 11 22 in this case given all the strings of length n we may obtain the strings of length n 1 adding zero one or two in queue adding zero provides new n strings the situation for the digits one and two is symmetric thus we need only to consider one of the two let consider the addition of the digit one it may be added to all the strings ending by zero or ending by two to get the final blocks 01 or 21 the final block 01 constitutes the last part of a length n 1 string in which the first part of n 1 digits has no other constraints than those given by f there are n 1 allowed such configurations the symmetric holds when considering two as last digit thus there are another n 1 allowed such configurations if we consider the block 21 it may be the final part only of those n 1 blocks in which the first n 1 block does not end by two if it ends by zero we get a final block of three digits 021 and a first part of length n 2 where there are n 2 different allowed configurations the symmetric holds again for the digit two giving a three block 012 which provides itself other n 2 allowed configurations if it ends by one we get a final block of three digits 121 that may be added in queue only to blocks ending not by one the same symmetrically for the three digits 212 we obtain two branches of growing final block with alternating sequence 121212 and vice versa from which at each back step depart 2 n i allowed configurations for the index i 1 2 n 1 then we get n 1 n 2 n 1 2 n 2 2 1 2 2 where the last two numbers indicate respectively the strings 0121212 0212121 and the two complementary strings 121212 212121 all blocks of n 1 digits then we have n n 1 2 n 1 i 2 n i 4 13 v topological entropy for tm k shift spaces from the previous sections and from the equation 4 it is clear how one can proceed to select a tm k shift space which possesses a desired value for the entropy for the examined cases it is bn x n to evaluate the limit for n it is convenient to express n through the limit ratio fn fn 1 so that n n 1 0 1 14 15 h lim n log n 1 0 1 n log 0 using the previous results we take for example m 1 and let k be arbitrary the resulting equation for the largest root 0 is 2 k 1 16 0 1 4 k 3 2 17 and we get a discrete set of numerable topological entropies ht 2 k log 1 4 k 3 2 18 the freedom we have in choosing the two integers k and m allows for a vast variety of tm k shift spaces with a pre selected associated entropy vi conclusions we showed how the number of different allowed blocks of fixed length for a large class of shift spaces tm k may be expressed in terms of recurrence relations obtaining various series describing the growth of this number with the length of the blocks this information has been used to calculate different topological entropies from the limit ratio of two adjacent terms of such series a scheme to build a desired value for the entropy has been also illustrated it must be noted that the recurrence relations we obtained for particular shift spaces and used to pre select some values 7 for htm k may have a larger applicability to problems arising in different contexts in fact it is easy to check that they may be equivalently used to count the number of different one dimensional paths if a 2 where one must step at least m times to the right before taking any step to the left for only once finally we believe that all these results may be applied when devising complex algorithms for information storage and encryption since the entropy is directly related to the complexity of the system acknowledgments this work has been partially supported by the r a s regione
