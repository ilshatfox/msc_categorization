since the early 1990 s with the arrival of a variety of new technologies the capacity for authentic astronomical research at the high school level has skyrocketed this potential however has not realized the bright eyed hopes and dreams of the early pioneers who expected to revolutionise science education through the use of telescopes and other astronomical instrumentation in the classroom in this paper a general history and analysis of these attempts is presented we define what we classify as an astronomy research in the classroom aric project and note the major dimensions on which these projects differ before describing the 22 major student research projects active since the early 1990 s this is followed by a discussion of the major issues identified that affected the success of these projects and provide suggestions for similar attempts in the future keywords astronomy education astronomy public outreach history and philosophy of astronomy 1 introduction student research pitched at an appropriate level can be an effective approach to address the disenchantment about science that results from traditional chalk n talk styles of teaching hollow 2000 while students can be excited by the breathtaking images in astronomy alone through research a student can gain a sense of pride and ownership in their work as well as gain useful secondary meta skills such as organisational techniques and problem solving approaches that become invaluable in later studies and work in addition some students demonstrate greater capabilities when they are exposed to study at depth than one would have previously ex pected from their in class behaviour gifted students as well as underachievers and the easily bored can be mo tivated by tackling some of the big questions that a typical everyday science class lacks hollow 2005 it is also the case that traditional styles of schooling tend to compartmentalize learning into very discrete en tities such as english in english class or computing in computer science class in the modern world regardless of whether the career is scientific or not skills are gen erally built from many varied components drawn from a variety of traditional subject domains gilbert 2005 this reality is modelled much better by a research ap proach to learning in science than the traditional trans missive mode evident in high school science the capacity for true high school based astronomical research has exploded over the last twenty years and this has a lot to do with rapid technological advance ment in the early nineties affordable charge coupled device ccd cameras became available which deliv ered near instantaneous images from telescopes rather than the previous long and tedious processing of pho tographic film baruch 1992 while unimaginably slow by present day standards early modems and bulletin board systems and then the internet provided a method of instantaneous and cheap long distance delivery of these images at least compared to sending the images through the post on disk as well as the potential for remote control of the observatory itself as it was noted while it was occurring baruch 2000 sadler 2000 hollow 1998 it is the recent development of fast internet infrastructure that has allowed high school research projects involving astronomy to scale up in recent years other information technology it developments such as inexpensive hardware especially in terms of speed and capacity to share large amounts of data and software to undertake a full analysis have also contributed it is also these factors that have allowed re 1 http arxiv org abs 1407 6586 v 1 2 fitzgerald et al mote observing on major research grade observatories to become technically feasible developments in it even the playing field as less well resourced schools can freely access such equipment and tools prior to this access may have been the province of the wealthier schools gould et al 2007 even schools who due either to budgets

such as the astronomical research institute http www astro research org in illinois us and tzec maun observatory http blog tzecmaun org who host various telescopes in the us and australia notably for optical projects the ability to connect to a telescope on the other dark side of the world opens more possibilities where once it may have required night time observing sessions as a very useful side effect it requires a much decreased learning curve on the part of the teacher to access a remote automated telescope through the internet than to drive a semi automatic telescope in person beare et al 2003 the use of radio astronomy equipment data and ob serving techniques at the high school level has been far less widespread than in optical astronomy in part this is due to the greater conceptual difficulty of viewing and interpreting radio data compared with optical data but it is also due to equipment issues some schools such as taunton school in the uk hill 1995 achieved remark able results in building and using a variety of radio tele scopes including making interferometric observations of the emission from the collision of comet shoemaker levy 9 with jupiter some schools have used equipment projects such as radio jove to establish a radio astron omy provision within their school two schools in aus tralia relocated old dish antennae from the csiro cul goora radio heliograph for use within their schools but at least one of these is no longer in use more recently several other successful schemes have been implemented in the us and australia in this paper we aim to provide a summary and anal ysis of the types of projects that try to at some reason able scale get high school students and or teachers to undertake or contribute to some type of astronomy re search we summarise the criteria used to select projects for this review define the major dimensions on which the projects differ provide a description of each project and end with a discussion of the general issues that im pact on the success of these projects 2 definition of an aric project it is very difficult to categorise these projects into one homogeneous easily inter comparable group because while there are many similarities there are also many differences the core similarity is that high school stu dents yr 9 12 have at some point participated in orig inal astronomy using real data from a real instrument or as close to this as could be realistically practical this is too broad and simple a definition to be gener ally useful so we seek to define further criteria for what is or is not an astronomy research in the classroom aric project providing and using criteria will always leave out some projects that others may have chosen to leave in it is however beyond the scope of this paper to be too permissive and include every possible astronomy focussed project there are other reposi tories available online that collect lists of programs attempting to bring astronomy data into the classroom http nitarp ipac caltech edu page other epo programs the following are our nine criteria that a project needs to meet to be defined as an aric project within reason these criteria are flexible especially over the dimension of time for example due to technology constraints earlier projects were much more difficult to run than more recent projects 1 within the project there is some capacity for original research the first criterion is basically a simple definition of an aric project the contribution must be intended to be new however small and not be a re run of pasa 2014 doi 10 1017 pas 2014 xxx http www astrometrica at http gtn sonoma edu http nitarp ipac caltech edu page other epo programs student research project review 3 previously undertaken research we are not look ing at simulations of real methodologies such as the clea materials http www 3 gettysburg edu marschal clea cleahome html where the method ological steps that scientists take from observations to results are very well simulated or canned exercises using real astronomical data contained within existing programs it can be argued that these activities do have their place in education and are often vital stepping stones to doing real astronomical research but they are not the same as actually doing the research at best an aric project contains within itself mechanisms that can direct the student s novel results towards pub lication even in a journal aimed at student publications 2 data should be from a research grade instrument and detectors preferably taken by the students themselves the second criterion allows multiple astronomical research techniques perspectives and methodologies to be valid within reason for instance optically observing a variable star s with an amplitude of a large fraction of a magnitude can be undertaken on nearly any clear night whereas to get a decent colour magnitude diagram of an open or globular cluster could require precision photometry with outstanding seeing in near perfect observing conditions in this case the direct use of an optical telescope by the student is an option for the first instance above whereas pulling the data from a research quality archive is a better option for the second instance this is a scientific precondition that drives certain pedagogical decisions rather than the other way around it is important that the end result of a student s research is a scientifically valid contribution however small and not in actuality a waste of time due to methodological errors to that end if the scientific endeavour requires the data mining of previous observations rather than taking brand new observations this is also considered to be valid this criterion also incorporates practical considerations e g if the resources or manpower required to get the project running are prohibitive then requirement for completely new observations is relaxed this criterion is thus intended to be flexible within reason 3 aric projects should focus on the interpretation of data not just the acquisition aric projects should mimic a real world research project as much as possible and encompass at least a few of the steps from the generation of an origi nal idea through research proposal literature search data acquisition data reduction and data interpreta tion followed by new questions to pursue as a follow up preferably students should use flexible image transport system fits files or other standard re search data containers and formats directly this dis tinguishes aric programs from programs such as the crowd sourced citizen science programs such as galaxy zoo http www galaxyzoo org or moon mappers http cosmoquest org mappers moon as outlined in mendez et al 2010 where many people participate in looking at real data but most of the participants typ ically require a comparatively smaller understanding of the data acquisition reduction or interpretation of the ensemble of crowd sourced results whilst most citizen science projects are not specifi cally aimed at formal education but rather at informal education programs such as the zooniverse are now actively attuned to possibilities and potential of use of programs within the classroom such projects are developing useful education tools and educator communities these are likely to offer some exciting possibilities for aric projects in the near future 4 the project must rely fundamentally on the methodologies and typical approaches of the science of astronomy it is true that there can be much interdisci plinary crossover between astronomy by which we mean the study of celestial objects and that of planetary science whether of earth or other planets e g http marsed asu edu mesdt home http minirf jhuapl edu or that of space sci ence the study of nearby interplanetary space e g http cse ssl berkeley edu artemis epo html or with chemistry or biology for this paper we choose to focus specifically on astronomical topics while craters on the moon and the atmosphere on mars are inter esting extra planetary topics and are of course not truly distinct from the rest of astronomy e g via extrasolar planets they often use different language methodology and approaches to what we typically call astronomy in the context of this paper however since we study asteroids with the general techniques of astrometry and photometry we make a small exception and include here projects involving asteroids the study of the nature of the moon and other planets in our solar system however is beyond the scope of this paper unavoidably this is a criterion with somewhat ill defined boundaries boundaries that can also move with time as scientific approaches to the study of natural phenomena themselves change 5 the focus of the project must be on astronomy rather than general science there are many organisations and projects around the world that offer generic science research projects pasa 2014 doi 10 1017 pas 2014 xxx http www 3 gettysburg edu http www galaxyzoo org http marsed asu edu mesdt home 4 fitzgerald et al where students or educators are generally paired up with a mentor for a one off science project in any of a wide variety of subjects the projects we consider here are solely those that are specifically astronomically focussed and not those that necessarily lead to a one off science project see also criterion 7 below 6 interaction with students and teachers must be active not passive aric projects must involve active rather than passive interaction of project personnel with teachers and students curriculum repos itories such as the sdss skyserver materi als http skyserver sdss org public en the hands on astrophysics variable star astron omy materials developed by donna young janet mattei and john percy mattei et al 1997 http www aavso org education vsa or the chandra activities http chandra harvard edu edu while valuable therefore do not qualify simple technology provision kits while enabling science discovery in the classroom do not necessarily actively promote interaction of scientists with teachers or students 7 involvement of multiple teachers and or multiple student groups we do not focus on single teacher led projects at specific schools for specific populations of students even though there have been some fine examples of great projects occurring such as work at the taunton hill radio observatory hill 1995 blue mountains grammar school hollow 2000 the latin school of chicago gehret et al 2005 nor do we consider one off field trips since they do not mimic the scientific process this criterion is to ensure that the aric project can work in more than one classroom involving more than one teacher enabling at least the possibility that the project is scalable and sustainable 8 projects are aimed at students or teachers at the high school school years 9 12 level we consider only the high school level components of the projects discussed some of the listed projects have additionally more substantial undergraduate elementary or middle school components to get students interested in science and astronomy it is well recognised that recruitment needs to begin by the middle school level tytler et al 2008 barmby et al 2008 mckinnon geissinger 2002 how ever projects that are aimed at this level are of a different nature and are outside the scope of this review 9 established continuing track record in this review we have omitted some po tential projects due to the fact that they are still in development but have mentioned stu dent research as one of their goals as this re view is written we mention these projects here for completeness comenius asteroid project http grudziadz planetarium pl comenius global jet watch http www globaljetwatch net or the sofia airborne observatory http sofia usra edu it is simply our requirement that something substantial must have occurred within the project for us to be able to discuss it there are other projects that have begun but have yet to generate enough data one example is monet using a pair of 1 2 m telescopes one in texas and one in south africa bischoff et al 2006 that have had some early success and published some arti cles backhaus et al 2012 beuermann et al 2011 beuermann et al 2009 but is yet to get rolling in a stable manner another example is the spice physics icrar remote internet telescope spirit http www spice wa edu au pair of observatories at the university of western australia it was officially opened in 2010 for the use of high school students both remotely and robotically 3 dimensions of projects even within the limitations we have imposed there are nearly as many types of aric projects as there are actual projects they can display different approaches have widely varying budgets and hence cannot gen erally be compared directly the dimensions outlined here are not rating scales but rather descriptions of difference few of these projects have detailed descrip tions in the widely available literature and so we have defined dimensions in an effort to describe some basic differences and similarities amongst the projects there are quite a large number of conference proceedings out lining project directions as well as media releases that advertise particular project successes however there are many fewer publications of scientific outputs avail able in the literature as may be reasonably suspected and only very rarely are there methodologically strong evaluations of efficacy in terms of student knowledge or motivation outcomes in science this is also to be ex pected as a recent analysis of iau papers bretones neto 2011 comes to similar more rigorous conclusions that research into astronomy education in general re quires deeper treatments the lack of good quantita tive data in high school astronomy education has been known for a while hollow 2000 we now go into detail about the various dimensions we have used to charac terise broadly each of the projects where each project pasa 2014 doi 10 1017 pas 2014 xxx http skyserver sdss org public en http grudziadz planetarium pl comenius http www spice wa edu au student research project review 5 sits in relation to these dimensions are listed at the top of the description of each of the projects 3 1 teachers students both one of the major dimensions we use below is whether the project focus is on teachers or students as a group or on both groups some projects seek to get research undertaken in the classroom via empowering the teacher with inquiry based scientific skills in the hope that they will in turn get their students to undertake research in this respect these projects are also attempting to empower the teacher to better present science to their current and future students in a more engaging manner in addition to implementing authentic research in the classroom other projects act to try to extract particularly in terested students from their classrooms as candidates to undertake research the teacher is used as a recruitment tool to find highly engaged students some projects in volve the personnel taking control and direction of the classroom activities either by going into the classroom or bringing the students to the project s staff leaving the teacher to act in a supervisory or administrative role teacher professional learning about authentic inquiry based science education is something that takes a large amount of time effort and resources e g supovitz et al 2000 gerbaldi 2005 loucks horsley et al 2003 but can have flow on benefits for the teachers future students e g silverstein et al 2009 and a multiplicative impact on science education student focussed projects cut straight to the student eliminating the costs and resources in both money and time for large amounts of teacher training 3 2 structured guided coupled inquiry the tradition of four categories of inquiry were first de fined by schwab 1960 and herron 1971 confirma tory inquiry is where the results of a scientific under taking are largely known in advance and the scientific endeavour is simply to re confirm accepted knowledge by definition and via criterion number one this style of inquiry is excluded from this review structured inquiry is where the larger question and the methodology of an endeavour are quite rigidly set by the teacher mentor and the students are led through the methodology to gain a new answer at the end guided inquiry is where the question is set by the teacher mentor but the methodology and process are to a reasonable extent left to the students to design and undertake open inquiry is where students can decide upon their own research question and methodology within the resources avail able while the teacher mentor acts as a guide or facil itator rather than a traditional instructor it is quite unlikely and pedagogically not feasible for any student or novice researcher without prior con ceptual and methodological understanding of the sci entific field to launch simply straight into open in quiry more reasonably the idea of coupled inquiry dunkhase 2003 is a feasible approach where students are initially led through either structured or guided or some combination to a level where they are capable of undertaking true open inquiry as open inquiry has to be preceded by scaffolding at some time and at some level we leave this out of our discussion more impor tantly scaffolding is required because students cannot do research if they do not understand the content area and methodology of the research field itself etkina et al 2003 3 3 archival pre observed newly observed this dimension captures whether the project uses data which has been previously analysed and exists in archival datasets data which has been pre collected but not analysed or whether the data is collected during the project itself 3 4 selective non selective partially selective some projects are open to all who are interested and some are highly academically selective others are not necessarily selective but through their recruitment pro cedure end up being selective 3 5 easily scalable non scalable scalable with difficulty this dimension is a question of ability to expand given sufficient funding for instance an easily scalable project would be one where you would involve twice or more of the population for twice the cost or less the limiting aspects can relate to the use of a specific instrument or telescope unless the telescope is specif ically devoted for student use or educational projects there is an inevitable restriction on time availability if the education projects require their own observations if the data are primarily archival the limiting factor may be the number of project personnel recruited to work with the teachers and students 3 6 at school external mixture this describes whether the teachers and students un dertake the project predominantly in their schools or from home at school or at another external institu tion external or it is a mixture i e a workshop at pasa 2014 doi 10 1017 pas 2014 xxx 6 fitzgerald et al an external institution then some work back at school or home 4 summary descriptions of projects in the description of the projects we have left out the general motivations for the project as they tend to be quite similar in sum there is much focus on motivating students in science in high school to inspire them to be come scientists or engineers or simply scientifically liter ate voters in the future through engaging with authen tic research experiences few science teachers have deep experience in scientific research this can be a problem because it is difficult to teach what one has never expe rienced an analogy would be that one would never hire a sporting team coach for a high profile team who had never played that particular game there are many statements comparing the gap be tween best practice and actual practice in science teaching e g goodrum et al 2001 goodrum druhan abbs 2012 european commission 2007 osborne dillon 2008 as well as a gap between the pupils par ents and teachers perception of the curriculum os borne collins 2000 often there is also reference to the necessity of having enough science technology en gineering and mathematics stem trained people or of a particular shortfall within their respective coun tries e g select committee on science and technology 2002 european commission 2004 tytler 2007 tytler et al 2008 other goals include advancing teacher and student understanding of the nature of science and tech nology duschl schweingruber shouse 2007 teacher professional learning osborne dillon 2008 and use of information technologies as well as making links be tween science and other parts of the school curriculum rather than focus on individual motivations we focus on what the projects do or did we have also steered clear of commenting on the project s applicability to its related curriculum because this can be highly variable across as well as within nations it may be noted that the majority of these projects are english speaking and primarily from the usa with a small number of projects from the uk and australia significant effort was made to find projects in non english speaking countries most notably japan and continental europe however projects fitting the crite ria outlined in this paper were not found in our search each of the projects is presented in alphabetical order we briefly summarise their major statistics in terms of project era budget scope and participants as well as where they fall in terms of the dimensions defined above the project is then described briefly with information sourced from a mixture of published papers conference proceedings and through informal

completely autonomous robotic telescope sited in mount teide tenerife in the canary islands initially the telescope was begun as an engi neering astronomy project but over time transitioned into a primarily educational outreach organisation as teacher interest was unexpectedly high and sustained and education related funding started to flow towards the project brt allows schools and the general pub lic to submit observing jobs to the telescope over the internet through a portal website the images are then queued observed robotically and then returned to the user the telescope itself has three main cameras a constellation camera 40 degree field of view fov a cluster camera 4 degree fov and a galaxy cam era 20 arcminute fov requested images are usually obtained and returned within a night or two depend ing on weather conditions and celestial location of the object schools are charged for usage as the administrating university wants the project to pay its own way while amateur astronomers some of whom looked for super novae and neos have had free use for many years they are also now charged historically the telescope was run mainly through a variety of grants and subsidised by in kind support from the university nowadays brt only receives grants for educational research and out reach work there are six staff members five of whom are covered by the income from the project while the pi s income comes from university overall there are 100 000 s of school users and 30 000 amateur users table 2 bradford robotic telescope summary founded 1993 end date continuing budget yr

the brt is focussed at grades 3 to 6 key stage 2 up to grades 10 and 11 key stage 4 and provides ed ucation and teaching materials for all years the main focus of the project is on education and learning rather than on authentic research itself there are possibili ties for open ended use of the brt through its various programs although currently the inability of the sched uler to acquire calibration frames easily or series of re lated images limits its use to general colour imaging while it is possible for the students to undertake re search through the brt the general focus is on getting all students familiar with the night sky and pushing the more interested students to larger research based projects such as others listed in this paper largely teachers have approached brt to get in volved themselves through finding the project through the web or via word of mouth brt also actively looks for teachers by choosing an area looking for supportive grants in the area and then linking up with the sec ondary schools and the primary schools that feed the secondary schools a large recent thrust of the brt project is to provide professional development for teach ers in the area of astronomy subject knowledge because it is perceived that one source of what discourages stu dents in science is the teacher s relatively poor percep tion of science the program provides professional de velopment pd for a teacher in his or her classroom this has resulted in a far larger usage of the telescope than other more traditional models in terms of number of students involved projects undertaken and activity on the website in one year the project generally pro vides in classroom pd for 200 to 300 teachers 4 3 charles sturt university remote telescope project the charles

research arm of lcogt but is now an internally funded university program initially many of the schools that joined were from the private sector in the uk rather than the publicly funded sector the reason for this seemed to be because teachers from these schools are usually more highly qualified and have greater control over the curriculum offerings at their schools over time however publicly funded schools slowly came on board there are 200 250 schools using the telescope regularly out of about 4500 high schools in the uk the project is currently working to branch out into europe they have some european schools on board in portugal france and germany amongst other countries with the new european fo cus there are more projects coming on board as well as well as involvement with esa the project is trying to build projects where astron omy researchers require data and teachers and students can be involved in the acquisition of those data using the faulkes telescopes while there were some issues with quality control of the data the early feedback indicated that schools liked the fact that they were helping real as tronomers the projects had to be something that stu dents

government bodies using real telescopes by using graduate students in the high school classroom initially from 1993 schools could book time and use the 24 inch as well as being able to control the tele scope the schools would also call in on a speakerphone to speak to the operator at the telescope in case some thing went wrong or to ask for advice on such things as exposure times as well as rotating the dome as tech nology improved and the internet started taking off the system was modified to become internet controllable while teacher recruitment was gained through pre senting at the national education conferences much of the recruitment was primarily word of mouth there were no firm requirements set for what was to be done in class with the telescope although guidance was given when requested three teacher workshops per year with 15 teachers per class were held at mt wilson for those who wanted to know more about how the telescope ac tually operated in terms of curriculum material pro vided there were 12 projects each with only two pages of instructions teachers would usually have a mentor who could help many students undertook the photom etry projects a few did astrometry while only three or four schools did spectroscopic work many students won first place in science fairs they entered one student won a science fair for los angeles ca usa county by

five year teacher enhancement project that ran from 1999 to 2004 it originated from an earlier pilot project which ran from 1993 1995 meech et al 2000 it primarily provided professional learning to teachers although stu dents were also funded to participate in the program to gain insights into a career in astronomy or science the unifying theme was the search for habitable worlds planetary origins and primitive bodies kadooka 2002 in a three week intensive workshop there were active components where the teachers and students used small 8 inch and 10 inch telescopes to undertake nightly ob servations these most commonly involved variable star and double star measurements using photomultiplers and ccds based around the hands on astrophysics curriculum mattei et al 1997 in addition

indirectly into the hawai i student teacher astronomy research program his tar project described above 5 issues identified in projects during the research for this article many informal dis cussions were conducted with various project personnel from most of the investigated projects as well as execut ing a more standard literature review in this section we present a discussion of project issues that commonly arose during the discussions as well as those apparent in the published literature 5 1 funding it is quite apparent from all of the projects described that sources of funding are a key aspect of long term project success most of the funding for many of the projects came from short term grants lasting two to four years that had to be renewed usually with difficulty as each grant period came to an end many projects end up running on shoestring budgets or with volun teer time after the initial grant period expired of very recent note most of the current projects are in turmoil or have been terminated due to programmatic uncer tainties associated with nasa epo funding issues while a scientific project can be undertaken in a dis crete manner and a question addressed in a particu lar time period educational projects need to be funded in the long term to maximise their impact on students and teachers the development time for any education project to get to a stable state typically takes a few years before gains are seen in the classroom e g john son et al 2007 banilower et al 2007 suppovitz et al 2000 after a typical initial negative implementation dip hall hord 2010 that time is spent in devel oping the materials and ironing out any bugs as well as reaching a substantial fraction of the intended educa tion community once this has been achieved it requires continual resource input to keep the project alive it is still not clear what the best business model is to provide continual and ongoing support and resources to teachers and projects to ensure their continuation beyond finite funding cycles those projects that seem to survive are those that tend to be ones that are rela tively low budget and run by volunteers that are funded as a longer term project through an existing govern ment body have become self funded through charging for their services or through philanthropy 5 2 importance of evaluation in terms of educational research and evaluation over all there is little known about these projects there are some minor shining lights but most projects do not present evaluations and those that do suffer from sig nificant methodological flaws for instance some eval uations focussed simple on very short post hoc qualita tive comments from teachers while others reported no estimates of confident intervals for results from quanti tative surveys or used anecdotal successful case studies as an indicator of general success this situation is not unexpected as bretones and neto 2011 state edu cational research in astronomy education needs deeper treatments the usual reason provided for the lack of evaluation is that it was not part of a grant and was not funded as part of the project however not all forms of evaluation need be as costly as it is commonly claimed simple pre post test sur veys such as the astronomy diagnostic test hufnagel 2000 for content knowledge and the secondary school science questionnaire goodrum et al 2001 for attitu dinal change can be used in quasi experimental designs gribbons herman 1997 to gain understanding of whether the particular educational design achieved their intended results in the short term we recommend that evaluation be undertaken in collaboration with an expe rienced educational evaluator if at all possible and defi nitely significantly in advance of the commencement of the project itself a good general introduction to the is sues and techniques project evaluation the 2010 user friendly handbook for project evaluation frechtling et al 2010 is available from the national science foun dation a recommended guide with a much more direct astronomical focus is discipline based science educa tion research a scientist s guide by slater et al 2011 indeed evaluation becomes part of the feedback loop that provides evidence for further grant funding appli cations if a project cannot present solid evidence of efficacy then the likelihood of further grant funding is reduced dramatically hence evaluation is a necessary component that should be built into the structure of any given project beyond simply acquiring more grant funding ade quate evaluation allows researchers and investigators to learn from the successes and failures of other projects without this knowledge this field is basically relying on anecdotes from researchers to illuminate any future design process this is fraught with danger as it is well known that such anecodotal or expert evidence suf fers from a pro innovation bias rogers 2010 where people involved with projects due to the nature of hu man socio psychology will evaluate and rate their own projects much more highly than they probably truly are this leads to complacency on the path to improvement of these projects evaluation itself of course is dependent upon the goals of a project producing a scientific paper out of a project looks very good for the project especially in the eyes of research astronomers it is likely however pasa 2014 doi 10 1017 pas 2014 xxx 22 fitzgerald et al that it is only the peak population in any project who can produce such outcomes small numbers of such pa pers are produced by these projects and are likely to be weighted far too heavily as a measure of success with respect to the educational goals of a project if the pa per is taken in the light of the common goals of these projects viz giving young people an experience of the scientific method and more generally a better under standing of science so that they can appraise the nature of science as a human endeavour to help them make valid choices in the future then these papers alone are not an adequate measure of success an estimation of the level of impact on an individual student can be measured at quite reasonable cost in the short term however longitudinal studies at higher cost of money and time resources of the educational impact of such projects on students such as tracking their actual career path long term interest in science or general academic performance are noticeably absent from the evaluation literature what is required is adequate educational research into the true impact of such projects on participating students even if the teachers are the primary audience for any given program the overarching goal of the eval uation should be in seeking answers to the question how does this project broadly affect the students some recent work in fields other than astronomy has suggested that having teachers experience authentic re search has a positive effect on their students who were not involved in the research for example silverstein et al 2009 find that within their new york state project students of teachers who have experienced authentic sci entific research pass their state science exams at a rate that is 10 higher than the students of teachers who have not the effect on students cannot be discovered by mere exit polls about whether teachers enjoyed a project or found that it improved their teaching espe cially as it is fairly clear that teachers themselves suffer from the same pro innovation bias that project investi gators do fitzgerald et al 2014 d 5 3 scalability in a perfect world we would like any astronomical edu cational initiative to reach as many people as possible but there are significant barriers for any project in at tempting to do this usually funding sets project limits many projects by necessity are bounded in size by ge ography and by time in the geographical vicinity of a project it is relatively easy to provide on campus ex periences to teachers and students once the project expands beyond the local jurisdiction the necessity for accommodation of participants or the travel of facili tators investigators is at huge cost some projects are also limited by access to telescope time or finite access to archives of data another less apparent requirement for scalability of these projects is staffing the skill set necessary to pro vide adequate staffing for these projects is fairly rare faculty personnel with the right mixture of astronomi cal and educational experience can be difficult to find if the faculty do not exist then significant training is necessary to develop the experience in interested peo ple a unique mixture of content knowledge pedagogi cal knowledge charisma interpersonal skills and organ isational skills must be distributed amongst the project personnel even when this is available the amount of communication overhead in dealing with all of the stu dents and teachers questions can be quite large 5 4 adequate focus and design the experiences of personnel in the projects reviewed make it clear that true open inquiry from scratch simply does not work this is also clear from the projects re viewed and also from the literature alfieri et al 2011 providing a telescope to teachers and students with no structure seems not to generate preferable outcomes in an educational context sufficient thought into how stu dents interact with the data what they can learn from the meaning of the data and how they will learn to un derstand the data is necessary some thought about how students are actually learn ing to become scientists within the project is also nec essary as students can manipulate the data and even work out the mechanics of certain aspects but may not be gaining a fundamental understanding of how science works in the process sufficient scaffolding of this aspect is necessary to get the students authentically involved in the scientific process 5 5 technology a major barrier that prevented teachers from imple menting projects was computing requirements these have varied strongly with what the project was trying to do but they have also changed dramatically with the passage of time the earlier projects 1990 s had a near impossible task trying to get teachers to use computers even in the rare cases where computers actually existed in their classrooms let alone getting teachers to interact significantly with the data the technology available in schools can be many years behind that available to research scientists and or even the home this presents problems to the provision of cutting edge hardware and software for research pur poses even for the more recent projects lack of band width and user friendliness of the required software were significant impediments to their implementation both of which are coupled with the need for scientific va lidity of data and data analysis even at this point in time school email fails often and requires participants pasa 2014 doi 10 1017 pas 2014 xxx student research project review 23 to use centralized servers like gmail com in addition schools frequently impose limitations on what and how software can be installed on computers that have to be accessed by students technology is also a moving tar get as the software required to undertake astronomical research forms only a small niche market and the soft ware development can move much more slowly than the pace at which technology itself changes 5 6 authenticity vs reality a naive research scientist when approaching this style of project will generally want the project to be as authentic as possible from the ground up this how ever is not possible in normal educational settings teachers have limited time within their school year and within the scope of what they are expected to teach in addition few teachers or students have experience in computer programming generally some projects have shown that if teachers and students acquire the obser vations and undertake the reductions of their raw data once they got to interpretation and analysis of the data they had both run out of steam and time at some point a decision needs to be made about how authentic the research can be compared to the actual plausibility of the project being successfully undertaken by teachers and students within the educational context the more authentic the science is to be then more support from project personnel and from research astronomers is nec essary the stronger the skill set that needs to be devel oped and a much greater amount of time needs to be devoted to undertake the project 5 7 teachers as scientists another problem arises from the fact that teachers are generally not research scientists and have had no au thentic experience of the scientific method teachers are generally trained to implement activity based science where discrete class long activities can be undertaken successfully with a previously known correct answer they also have little understanding of the complexities of the actual scientific endeavour beyond that which appears in textbooks and concurrently can equally be fairly unaware of their lack of knowledge hence teachers can generally undertake a more trivial rather than an intended authentic scientific investigation ap proach a relatively common comment in the informal dis cussions was that many of the teachers only undertook the measurement aspects which were relatively more cook book like and safe while deliberately avoiding in terpretation or analysis in their approach this trivial approach is not unexpected though as there are ex treme demands and limitations on what teachers can undertake within their classroom both in terms of the time and the curriculum related constraints 6 conclusion in this paper we have explored 22 major large scale projects that have attempted to bring authentic astron omy research into the classroom since the enabling dawn of the internet era and the birth of affordable ccd cam eras two decades ago while there have been many suc cesses and obviously many rewarding valuable experi ences for the teachers students and project personnel involved the field still has a number of important issues and problems to address before major successes can be seen in the field the major apparent problems are the very distinct lack of evaluation apparent in the field and where such evaluation exists it is hard to access not publicly available and or it is methodologically problematic a closely related issue is the funding of such projects the best business model for these projects is not at all clear but without adequate proof of efficacy any attempt to extract the long term funding necessary for the support of these educational projects to allow measurable suc cess to become apparent is problematic with sufficient concentration on solutions of these two major issues and addressing the no less important but secondary issues of scalability good design tech nology barriers and the realities of the limitations of classrooms teachers and time in the future we may see sustained large scale classroom research projects emerg ing with verifiable measurements of their true efficacy and impact on students and teacher practice 7 acknowledgements appreciation goes
