learning abstract despite widespread calls for the incorporation of mathematical modeling into the undergraduate biology curriculum there is lack of a common under standing around the definition of modeling which inhibits progress in this paper we extend the rule of four initially used in calculus reform efforts to a framework for models and modeling that is inclusive of varying disci plinary definitions of each this unifying framework allows us to both build on strengths that each discipline and its students bring but also identify gaps in modeling activities practiced by each discipline we also discuss benefits to student learning and interdisciplinary collaboration keywords modeling biology rule of five interdisciplinary education experiential learning multiple representations 1 many calls to action from computer games and medicine to weather predictions and new technologies nearly every aspect of our lives is influenced by mathemat ical modeling primary barriers to forward progress in teaching mathe matical modeling across our partner disciplines are misconceptions and biases around what constitutes modeling we the co authors are part of an interdisciplinary working group at the national institute for math ematical and biological synthesis nimbios that has brought together mathematicians biologists and education researchers to address teach ing quantitative biology especially modeling each of us has experienced 4 cd eaton reaching out to collaborate with a member of another discipline only to have the conversation shut down before it has really started because of the naive assumptions we make about the other s discipline we posit that if mathematicians and biologists alike can improve their under standing of the similarities and differences in their approaches to and language around modeling then each discipline will play a more effec tive role in advancing the other 55 and we will be able to teach this valuable skill more effectively in this paper we describe a framework for models and modeling that can bridge the communication gap be tween disciplinary boundaries enabling mathematicians statisticians and biologists to come together to improve student learning in 2012 the president s council of advisors on science and tech nology pcast released the engage to excel report 44 the report recommends that we should engage in a national experiment that encour ages faculty from math intensive fields other than math to be involved in teaching mathematics as a way to help close the mathematics achieve ment gap 44 the subtext is that traditionally trained mathematics educators are failing at helping our students succeed at mathematics as applied to science and technology soon after the national research council nrc released a study titled the mathematical sciences in 2025 which suggests that in order for the mathematical sciences to remain strong in the united states the education of students should be conducted in a cross disciplinary manner that reflects these ever changing realities 40 this requires a rethinking of the curricula in the mathematical sciences especially for mathematics and statistics depart ments in order to provide the additional quantitative skills needed for students entering the workforce in the fastest growing career fields such as those in stem mathematics professional societies responded to this call with the common vision project which identifies ways of improving undergrad uate curricula and education in the mathematical sciences by bringing together leaders from five mathematical and statistical associations 50 the project summarizes the collective recommendations of seven other curricular guides on undergraduate education from the associations as framework for teaching models and modeling 5 well as adds its own suggestions for improving undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences especially in the first two years of col lege the common vision project concludes that departments should increase efforts to update curricula support evidence based pedagogical methods and establish connections with other disciplines from the survey of curricular guides the common vision project identifies six themes for improving undergraduate curricula they are 1 to find more pathways into and through the curriculum for both stem and non stem majors 2 to increase the presence of statistics in student training 3 to increase the use of modeling and computation in order to enhance conceptual understanding and introduce the scien tific method into math classes 4 to connect to skills needed in other disciplines 5 to improve communication skills through technical writ ing and presentations and 6 to aid in the transition from secondary to post secondary education as well as from two year to four year insti tutions for transfer students modeling can play an important part of several of these themes not just where it is mentioned explicitly common vision notes that an early introduction to modeling along with statistics and computation can be a pathway into and through mathematical sciences curricula 50 the society for industrial and applied mathematics siam sug gests that professional societies should play a greater role in the incorpo ration of modeling throughout the undergraduate curriculum 54 this is reflected in the newly formed siam special interest activity group on applied mathematics education which recommends the develop ment of a first year modeling course that precedes and motivates the study of calculus and other fundamental mathematics for stem majors 53 the american statistical association s curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in statistical science suggests that incorpo rating statistical modeling with simulations into mathematics courses can improve computational skills 54 the mathematics association of america s subcommittee on curriculum renewal across the first two years crafty released a report in 2004 37 titled the curriculum foundations project voices of the partner disciplines which empha 6 cd eaton sizes mathematical modeling in math courses the report notes that every disciplinary group in every workshop identifies mathematical modeling as an essential part of training students in the first two years of their undergraduate experience furthermore having students engage in mathematical modeling can provide a mechanism for communication expression and reasoning that is cross cultural and cross disciplinary 37 while having students develop a set of transferable skills that has the potential to be far more impactful on their futures 17 these findings are not exclusive to mathematics communities but in fact run parallel to findings within mathematics partner disciplines for example in biology three reports bio 2010 by the national academy of science nas vision and change by the american association for the advancement in science aaas and the scientific foundations for fu ture physicians sffp report of the american association of medical colleges howard hughes medical institute committee all mention the important role of mathematics and specifically modeling in the future of biology as a discipline 3 23 38 bio 2010 outlines in an incredible amount of detail the core concepts that future research biologists need from mathematics and computing which include multiple mentions of modeling both mathematical and statistical throughout as well as a section devoted to important modeling concepts 38 vision and change specifically names the ability to use modeling and simulation as a core competency emphasis added 3 the sffp report also identifies mod eling as a core competency in the following way students should be able to apply quantitative knowledge and reasoning including integra tion of data modeling computation and analysis and informatics tools to diagnostic and therapeutic clinical decision making 23 2 wanted a common framework for models and modeling at the onset of our own interdisciplinary conversation as researchers it was clear that there were disciplinary differences by what is meant by models and modeling between the mathematicians the biologists framework for teaching models and modeling 7 the statisticians and the stem educators we generated the following questions does modeling require the use of data or even numbers does a model or the process of modeling require the use of symbolic equations or formulas does a schematic qualify as a model are you still engaged in modeling if you have not completed an entire iterative modeling process hint we will suggest resolutions to these questions in the paper that follows this linguistic confusion about what constitutes models and mod eling between mathematicians and the other disciplines is a barrier to interdisciplinary conversation it is compounded by the historical philo sophical and physical separation of departments of mathematics and de partments of statistics on large campuses in addition the teaching of statistics occurs in many different departments statistics mathematics biology psychology economics business education kinesiology etc on many campuses both large and small furthermore individual biol ogists identify primarily with one of the many different subdisciplines of biology each with their own approaches and rich modeling traditions e g physiological modeling ecological modeling and more recently sys tems biology modeling lastly there is also the specific field of mathe matical biology whose practitioners are asked to move fluidly between the identities of mathematician and biologist while still respecting the disciplinary cultures of each if in all of this diversity we are not clear about our definitions of models and modeling then our students will not be clear we suggest however that it is possible to articulate an overarching framework for models and modeling that will unify what seem like disparate traditions with the advantage of improving student learning for our discussions below we define model as a simplified abstract or concrete representation of relationships and or processes in the real world constructed for some purpose by simplified we mean that the model corresponds to a caricature of the real world rather than the real world itself as shown in figure 1 which depicts the parable of the blind men and the elephant discussed more fully in section 3 1 the purpose of a model is typically to enhance understanding of the process or re 8 cd eaton lationship being modeled there is a rich literature on model utility to which we refer the reader 15 42 57 next we categorize model repre sentations into five types in our framework experiential numerical symbolic verbal and visual see the boxes in figure 2 this rule of five categorization has been used previously in different contexts and will be discussed in detail in section 3 27 29 52 the rationale for making these categories explicit is that most mathematicians look at a model primarily as a collection of formulas which is the way of looking at a model that is least accessible to biologists thereby serving as a de terrent to the goal of increasing the amount of modeling that occurs in biology we seek to bridge the gap between mathematical and biolog ical cultures by introducing the concept of multiple representations of models if both mathematicians and biologists appreciate that the same model given with formulas by the mathematician can be thought of in terms of graphs data or experiences by the biologist then it is much easier to achieve a common understanding that is more nuanced than the individual understandings of the members of each discipline with model representations as objects clearly defined we now define modeling as a process composed of the various sets of activities involved in a larger modeling enterprise these individual modeling activities in clude 1 moving from observations of reality to an abstracted model either as an initial step in developing a model or as part of a model revision 2 moving from one model representation to another represen tation of the same model the arrows in the framework figure figure 2 or 3 comparing models to each other e g model selection or to reality model validation one or more of these modeling activities com prises modeling some of the tasks involved in the modeling enterprise such as finding equilibrium solutions or solving a quadratic equation are mathematical activities for which knowing the context of the model is not required hence we identify modeling activities as comprising just those tasks that make sense only in the context of modeling such as translating a verbal representation into a mathematical representa tion or comparing the predictions made by different models these are the tasks that require moving from one model representation to another framework for teaching models and modeling 9 wall rope snake tree fan spear

discussed fully in section 3 1 elephant images used in this illustration are creative commons public domain from pixabay com 10 cd eaton representation of the same model the arrows in the framework figure figure 2 our definition re frames the modeling process as having two levels of detail a holistic level that defines the modeling enterprise as the traditional iterative process with a goal of creating a useful final model and a finer more granular level that considers individual tasks that taken together comprise a modeling process our definition includes conceptions of the modeling process as a complete set of steps that are iterated for example as presented in the gaimme report 17 state the problem make simplifying assumptions mathematize analyze the model refine or extend the model while it is important for students to experience the full modeling enterprise in particular the iterative nature of modeling one s first attempt at a model is seldom adequate we suggest that there is value in practicing individual modeling activities as well thus defining modeling as any set of modeling activities is both more expansive and more inclusive of what counts as modeling pedagogically our definition allows the instructor to more easily scaffold modeling into the curriculum which is especially useful in our partner disciplines and also allows us to acknowledge to our partner disciplines that we are all modelers in the sections below we will explain what we mean by the rule of five framework with special attention to experiential as a rep resentation that is critical to and often missing from how we are cur rently teaching modeling to students we then give illustrative examples of model representations modeling activities and modeling pathways for the logistic growth model the hardy weinberg equilibrium hwe model and a physical model of the structure of dna these examples are often found in introductory biology classes and can therefore be used by students to practice modeling activities in biology classrooms and learn modeling concepts more deeply we show how this framework can be used to 1 provide a common language with which to engage in interdisciplinary conversations around the modeling process inclusive of whether approached from the point of view of mathematics statistics or biology and 2 provide a common framework for the teaching of mod framework for teaching models and modeling 11 reality model representations 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 1 3 4 5 6 experiential animations simulations physical models experiments

table 2 12 cd eaton eling across disciplines while our focus in this paper is to provide a framework that will facilitate communication between mathematicians statisticians and biologists we believe this framework to be adaptable to any discipline 3 rule of five framework 3 1 background and justification the crafty report described above noted that by engaging in math ematical modeling students have an opportunity to describe their work analytically graphically numerically andverbally 16 these model descriptions are historically referred to as the rule of four 66 this concept came about in the 1980 s and 1990 s when it was recognized that over half of students enrolled in calculus courses in the united states did not finish the course 13 this led to a number of calculus reform projects many of which were funded by the national science foundation several of these projects used a multiple representation approach as was suggested in the national council of teachers of mathematics curriculum and evaluation standards for school math ematics 62 39 these ideas then came to the forefront with the work of hiebert and colleagues 19 20 hiebert argued that in order to learn mathematics a student must understand mathematics such under standing occurs when there is a continually evolving and strengthening network of connections to internal mental representations of mathemat ical ideas and procedures hiebert proposed a framework to aid in the understanding of mathematics by making connections between numer ical graphical and symbolic representations the calculus connec tions project of oregon state university implemented a reform calculus emphasizing the representations of graphical numerical and sym bolic and the importance of switching between representations 12 62 the st olaf project also described moving among the representations of graphical numerical and algebraic as being crucial to learn ing the concepts of calculus 43 the calculus consortium at harvard university coined the term rule of three in their reform textbook 18 framework for teaching models and modeling 13 the rule stated that equal weight should be given to describing topics algebraically numerically and geometrically 26 note that the original word choice for the representations parallels course descriptions at the secondary school level 25 in the second edition of the text 27 this became a rule of four with a fourth equal emphasis on verbal descriptions of math problems by teachers and students in subsequent editions of the text 28 29 the descriptions of the four representations became graphical numerical symbolic and verbal since the inception of calculus reform in the 1990 s it is now commonplace to see a wider variety of problems and the use of multiple representations in traditional math textbooks 24 more recently a fifth rule was proposed by simundza in a labora tory course for precalculus 52 this fifth rule experiential is in the words of simundza a direct sensory experience of quantitative phe nomena 52 the importance of the experiential representation is alluded to in the american mathematical association of two year col leges amatyc standards where they propose that mathematics be taught like the sciences as a laboratory discipline 4 introducing students to multiple forms of representation is well documented to improve student learning for example the first principle guideline from the universal design for learning udl is a recommendation to provide students multiple forms of representation since there are diverse ways learners comprehend information 10 udl is a framework that addresses high variability in learners responses to instruction by suggest ing flexibility in the curriculum to meet the varied needs of the students using multiple representations can allow students to make connections within and between concepts 10 when students solved problems using more than one representation student performance was better than for those learners who used a single strategy 2 11 58 our use of experiential in the context of modeling is slightly dif ferent than but still in alignment with what is meant by experi ential learning in other contexts 7 there is an abundance of evi dence that experiential learning can improve student learning outcomes 31 32 33 52 there is also early evidence that adopting this type of 14 cd eaton framework in particular multiple model representations and movements between them can lead to success in subsequent quantitative courses 10 some students may enter into the learning experience more com fortable with a subset of these representations due to their own ways of knowing or disciplinary identity but the goal is that they should know all and be able to move between them the use of multiple forms of representation and the rule of five mirrors the parable of the blind men and the elephant as seen in figure 1 john godfrey saxe s poem version of the parable describes six blind men touching different parts of an elephant in order to understand it 49 each blind man compares each different elephant part to an everyday object that is similar a wall side snake trunk spear tusk tree knee fan ear or rope tail just as in the parable it is only through the use of different forms of representation that we may hope to gain the truest understanding of a problem interestingly this analogy to the parable also works when considering the different ways in which mathematicians and biologists approach problems each is experiencing one aspect of the problem and through communication using a common language around modeling we can create together a clearer picture of the world 3 2 model representations the boxes as discussed above and shown in figure 2 and table 1 we extend the rule of five from its original use as an aid to calculus and precalculus instruction to a useful general description of the various types of model representations that may be used in the modeling process framework for teaching models and modeling 15 table 1 the five types of model representations corresponding to figure 2 with their definitions and classroom examples type of rep resentation

instructors well versed in the rule of four should immediately find our definitions of the numerical symbolic verbal and visual model representations familiar although we have broadened their defi nitions to be inclusive of perspectives from mathematics statistics and biology symbolic representations are also referred to as analytic by the crafty report 16 and as algebraic by the st olaf project and the harvard calculus consortium 43 18 visual representations in particular x y plots are called graphical in the rule of four we sug gest visual is more inclusive of the emerging field of data visualization 59 3 2 1 experiential representation as a link between science and mathematics experiential representations are treated as distinct from the other rep resentations particularly the visual representation because the model ing enterprise is not pure mathematics but theoretical science mathe matics is abstract so visual representations of mathematical construc tions in calculus where the rule of three originated are almost always graphs science is both abstract and concrete with direct sensory experi ence playing a distinct and independent role experiential representa 18 cd eaton tions of a model are more easily connected with the original phenomena than any of the other representations in a mathematical modeling pro cess this may involve movie like simulations of growing populations or bean bag tactile manipulations e g 30 in biology this would include the experiments themselves it may seem strange to define experiments as a model but an experiment cannot encompass the entirety of reality cf blind men and elephant parable figure 1 referring to our defi nition of a model an experiment is a concrete simplification of reality designed with some purpose in mind that depends on a particular ex perimental design formulated by a scientist and carried out with some type of apparatus that interacts with the real world but is not the real world itself 3 2 2 using experiential approaches in teaching an advantage for students working with experiential representations is that they provide an entryway for understanding models that do not require the abstraction of symbolic or visual representations the in tegration of detail needed to understand a numerical representation or the conceptual knowledge and reading comprehension needed to un derstand a verbal representation an example of an experiential representation is the bugbox predator virtual laboratory 35 which simulates an agent based model of an experiment in which one predator is given a fixed amount of time to find and consume stationary prey at some initial population density of prey we can describe to students the verbal assumptions of the holling type 2 functional response model 21 22 and show them the resulting symbolic equation numerical data and graph visualization visual these are helpful but they are a poor substitute for showing students the animation and letting them observe for themselves that the predator must divide its time between searching and handling with more searching at low prey density and more handling at high prey density as an additional bonus no prerequisite sophistication is required to appreciate purely sensory observation 30 framework for teaching models and modeling 19 3 2 3 five representations of the logistic growth model the logistic growth model is another fitting example with which to il lustrate the five different types of model representations the experi ential box includes experiments measuring the growth of bacteria this includes conducting an actual laboratory experiment or manipulating a simulation however it also includes viewing the results of a time lapse video or animation the quantitative population data from the experiment or simulation and absolute and relative growth rates de rived data go in the numerical box a symbolic representation is the set of equations that approximately describe this relationship i e the equation for logistic growth visual representations of the model can be obtained by plotting the data in different ways for example as population versus time or as per capita population rate of change as a function of population size verbal representations of logistic growth include statements about the growth rate e g the relative growth rate is a decreasing linear function of population or as a statement linking the mathematical model to the biological concepts and processes at play e g the absolute growth rate is proportional to the population and the remaining capacity for population growth 3 3 modeling activities the arrows as defined earlier modeling activities for a specific model are those that connect different representations or connect the model to the real world scenario recall above our definition of modeling activities involved within the process of modeling 1 moving from observations of reality to an abstracted model either as an initial step in developing a model or as part of a model revision 2 moving from one model representation to another representation of the same model the arrows in the framework figure figure 2 and 3 comparing models to each other e g model selection or to reality model validation to be clear we intend for the boxes in figure 2 to stand for different representations of models and the arrows to stand for different modeling activities within the modeling process in the next section we discuss the use of the framework in the 20 cd eaton context of the modeling process and enterprise table 2

results table 2 describes the modeling activities contained in the arrows be tween boxes in the framework figure figure 2 a fully connected graph arrows which describe the transition between any two of the model rep resentations is the most inclusive of all potential uses of this framework framework for teaching models and modeling 29 some activities arrows would be more commonly performed than oth ers likely dependent on the discipline in the table we have interpreted the modeling activities in the context of logistic growth hardy weinberg equilibrium or the structure of dna this will also help us in the next section where we use these individual representations and activities as building blocks of the modeling process we want to emphasize that work performed entirely within one par ticular box alone is not a modeling activity per se but the province of the disciplinary context within which the work is performed ap plication problems in which students are given a formula and asked to use it to compute an answer without explaining the meaning is not modeling 17 however more extended problems in which models are used to create simulated data arrow 10 in framework figure 2 going from symbolic to numerical and in which these results are checked against additional data arrow 4 in framework figure 2 going from nu merical to experiential are a much better illustration of modeling 4 using the frameworkto unify modeling ap proaches we are certainly not the first group to describe a framework for teaching modeling frameworks can be more or less rigid in specifying a particu lar order of steps in the modeling process 6 8 9 34 41 recently the gaimme report discusses the mathematical modeling process as well as resources for teaching modeling 17 54 it emphasizes that the en tire iterative process of modeling is flexible i e moving back and forth between the different stages of model formulation and analysis with the report focusing its discussion in the context of mathematical modeling these more modern discussions of the modeling framework are consis tent with the messy and non linear nature of what happens in actual expert practice 60 one powerful feature of our framework is that we can explicitly ac knowledge and practice a variety of activities important to the modeling process without having to engage in the full modeling enterprise this 30 cd eaton allows us to scaffold and reinforce activities more easily particularly in classes that are not explicitly modeling classes such as partner disci pline classes furthermore if we refer to approaches taken by partner disciplines as different uses of a larger modeling framework then when students engage in those approaches we are setting them up to engage in the mathematical modeling process with more ease later our framework is fully compatible with these envisionings of math ematical modeling but it is more inclusive in the following ways our framework 1 encourages deliberate and thoughtful development of indi vidual modeling activities and skills in not only mathematics but other partner discipline classes 2 avoids what some might call disciplinary microaggressions by providing a framework inclusive of disciplinary specific research approaches taken by mathematicians statisticians and biologists and 3 emphasizes that the experiential representation is crucial for student learning particularly in partner disciplines 4 1 multiple modeling pathways in this section we describe the modeling process as a pathway through the modeling framework we have chosen just one representative path way for each discipline to discuss in detail a mathematical model ing example using logistic growth a statistical modeling example using hardy weinberg equilibrium and a third example from biology using the structure of dna however we explicitly acknowledge that multiple valid modeling pathways exist even within disciplines and encourage the reader to examine his or her own pathways through the framework in class and in research the particular examples described below have been chosen due to their ubiquity as models taught in mathematics and biology we now explore these as opportunities for instructors to engage more deeply using the framework presented here 4 1 1 a mathematical modeling pathway logistic growth as we noted previously a modeling investigation becomes more and more valuable as the number and variety of connections made between differ framework for teaching models and modeling 31 ent model representations increases in teaching mathematical modeling activities to students it is very helpful to begin with something experi ential ideally this would use real observations of biological phenomena as would be done in biology laboratory courses if this is not possible a manipulatable representation of a model would serve as a reasonable starting point for example in biology courses without a lab component or in mathematics statistics courses actual experiments and simulated experiments both belong in the experiential box framework figure 2 depending on the initial experience experiential observations might generate either qualitative or quantitative data which lead to verbal and numerical representations of a model respectively the mathematical modeling process is a pathway through the frame work that includes the symbolic box in this example we discuss the logistic growth model and follow the path experiential numerical visual verbal symbolic we begin with an experiential representation by performing an experiment to measure the growth of a bacterial culture over time if this cannot be done in class one could find a time lapse video of the phenomenon this approach to developing a numerical model would be to use raw population data to calculate absolute and relative growth rates one could then obtain a visual representation of the model by plotting the data in different ways for example population size versus time or relative growth rate versus pop ulation size then these steps lead to a verbal model consisting of the assumption that the growth rate is proportional to population an alter nate path would go from experiential verbal symbolic when the symbolic model is obtained from the qualitative observation that more parents produce more offspring in either pathway the symbolic representation of the model does not come directly from qualitative data verbal box or quantitative data numerical box but comes rather from a verbal representation obtained from the initial observations in this example the verbal representation leads to a symbolic represen tation in the form of a differential or difference equation the path way can then be extended from symbolic numerical visual by running a simulation to produce data generated by the mathemat 32 cd eaton ical symbolic model which can be graphed or the pathway can be extended from a symbolic experiential representation by creating an animation with computer graphics the pathway can be extended from symbolic directly to visual by solving the equation analytically and using the resulting formula to prepare a graph in either case the visual representation may contribute a statement of model behavior to the verbal representation note that in this description of these path ways the boxes and arrows are traversed several times and the order of the traversal is not fixed as the students engage in each of these activities they should be thinking about what they are doing and the connections they are making 4 1 2 a statistical modeling pathway hardy weinberg equi librium the previous example illustrates a modeling pathway that leads to a symbolic representation of a mechanistic mathematical model logis tic growth the next example illustrates a modeling pathway leading to a symbolic representation of a statistical model given in the con text of hardy weinberg equilibrium hwe which is typically taught in introductory biology courses pulling from previous experiments and observations experiential verbal students are introduced to the five major forces in evolution 1 selection 2 genetic drift 3 muta tion 4 gene flow and 5 non random mating 47 to arrive at the probability model symbolic of hwe we first assume a null verbal model that no evolutionary forces are present in particular suppose we have an isolated no gene flow infinite population no genetic drift where random mating no selection and no mutation occur a simpli fied genetic model also assumes one locus and two alleles given this verbal model the symbolic probability model representation is de rived hwe stating that allele and genotype frequencies do not change in subsequent generations many times this is where instruction stops but it is informative to mention that this probability model can then be used to statistically test for the presence of hwe which is a neces framework for teaching models and modeling 33 sary but not sufficient condition for lack of evolutionary forces this is accomplished by measuring genotype frequencies in a population of in terest experiential numerical and then performing a chi squared test to the null probability model of hwe numerical symbolic results of the test are then used as evidence for the presence or ab sence of evolutionary forces symbolic verbal it should be noted that most hypothesis testing in statistics follows this pathway observed data collected from experiment experiential numerical is tested against a null probability model numerical symbolic and the results are used as a quantification of evidence for a biological hypothesis symbolic verbal 4 1 3 a biological modeling pathway the structure of dna finally let s describe a pathway followed by biologists one of the most famous physical models in molecular biology is the physical model of the structure of dna created by james watson and francis crick that inspired the more abstract schematic that appears in their nature pa per 64 to build this model they integrated both quantitative and qualitative data from multiple sources numerical and verbal ex periential this physical model enabled a hypothesis about mecha nism experiential verbal it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material 64 one of the co authors of the current paper regularly uses building a chemically correct physi cal model of dna as an activity in her courses students gain a much deeper understanding of the chemical structure of dna from the direct manipulation of the physical model than from verbal descriptions or visual aids alone note that in this example not all of the boxes or arrows were traversed yet it is still an example of a modeling activity that enhances student learning 34 cd eaton 4 2 modeling pathways and the modeling enterprise ultimately the results of a modeling investigation need to be checked against original or new qualitative and or quantitative data or even other mathematical models thus recall the first and third parts of our definition of modeling activities which include model abstraction and revision model validation and model selection these are not rep resented in our framework figure 2 as arrows but are important mod eling activities when engaging in the full modeling enterprise a careful critique can almost always identify features of the biological system that are missing from the model in biology a large amount of stochasticity is often superimposed on deterministic phenomena so we cannot expect a model to exactly reproduce experimental data our first example of a modeling pathway using experiential activities to examine logistic growth would almost surely lead to a data set that does not precisely match the deterministic logistic growth example thus an important part of the modeling process includes recognizing when a model may need to be further refined to address the question at hand in the course of a modeling investigation with students the instructor s role often is to remind students to pause validate the model and if needed reexamine the model assumptions or mathematization to refine it in the instructional setting we can use the analogy of the blind men and the elephant figure 1 to remind students that results obtained from the study of a particular mathematical model pertain only to that model whether they are useful in understanding the biological setting depends on comparing and contrasting the model formulation with the corresponding biological process and model generated data with ob served or experimental data this is a key ingredient in encouraging students to engage in any modeling activity that is part of the modeling process even if students are only practicing individual modeling ac tivities smaller pieces of a larger modeling process it is imperative to remind them that they are working in a conceptualized model of reality 17 51 they are using caricatures of reality not dealing with reality itself and the assumptions and results should be critically analyzed in framework for teaching models and modeling 35 that light in our example model of logistic growth there are a number of mod els that one can use for limited growth if the per capita growth rate is constant the population is growing exponentially i e 1 p dp dt r how ever there are a number of ways in which a population can experience a decreasing per capita growth rate that results in limited growth each of these limited growth scenarios says something different about the process of growth or the growth relationship and each results in slightly different limited growth curves when the inflow of a population is exponential and the outflow is mediated by intraspecific competition for resources e g dp dt rp r k p 2 this is equivalent to saying that overall the per capita growth rate is linear i e 1 p dp dt r 1 p k however growth may be limited by other processes which may result in a non linear de crease of per capita growth rate in this case one might fit many types of mathematical models to the data set and select the model that mini mizes error and avoids over fitting for example by using a measure such as the akaike information criterion often referred to as aic for a re view of model fitting see 36 the model that has the lowest aic may tell you something about which processes may be driving the population in some cases the fact that a model is not matching the outcomes observed in reality can also be important such is the case with the primary use of the hwe model discussed above this model predicts the distribution of offspring genotypes in a population given a list of as sumptions if those assumptions are true and if in the parent generation the probability or frequency of allele a occurs is p and the probability that allele a occurs is q then the next generation will have the following distribution of genotypes p aa p 2 p aa 2 pq p aa q 2 if the observed distribution in the offspring does not match this is useful because then we know that one of the assumptions of the hwe model have been violated hwe is considered a classic use case of a null model in biology 57 36 cd eaton 5 using the framework to improve student learning we have synthesized a framework around modeling with the view that a unified framework allows us to be more purposeful practitioners around the teaching of modeling while traversing the modeling pathways may be intuitive for expert practitioners some studies have found that stu dents have difficulty translating between model representations 2 al though the facility of translation did vary depending upon the specific relations selected 1 yet in keeping with the recommendation from understanding science to be explicit 60 one study showed that sim ply telling students the purpose of the multiple representations can have a positive impact on learning 51 in particular schwonke et al con ducted two studies collecting gaze data from students viewing multiple representations of the same problem from the initial study many stu dents did not understand why they should have different representations and why they should transfer between them to improve the transitions between representations one group of students in a follow up study re ported in the same paper 51 received additional instructions explaining the bridge between the problem texts and equations while a control group did not have these instructions schwonke et al concluded that an explanation of the different representations improved the learning out comes for both low and high prior knowledge students but in different ways the low prior knowledge group seemed to transfer knowledge more easily between representations while the high prior knowledge students benefited because they paid more attention to the different representations our conclusion from this prior work is that while it is important for the instructor to facilitate use of multiple model repre sentations and modeling activities it is most valuable when the reasons behind it are made clear to the students i e make it explicit reflect and connect and provide context 1 2 51 60 understanding science a website that lays out a framework for the process of science suggests the following three main actions for bringing the process of science into the classroom 1 make it explicit 2 help the students reflect upon framework for teaching models and modeling 37 it and 3 give it context again and again 60 because modeling is theoretical science we suggest the same actions to bring our modeling framework into the classroom to strengthen both students understand ing of and abilities in modeling we list these actions again here with specific modeling framework examples be explicit tell your students what you are doing and why in the context of modeling teach students the modeling framework including definitions of models and modeling the different model representations boxes and the many modeling activities arrows be clear that biol ogists are already engaged in modeling but may not realize it or use the same language or approach as mathematicians or statisticians there are many first steps with which one can begin modeling and it does not have to begin the same way that was outlined in our example modeling pathways teaching any arrow can be a first step in teaching modeling as long as one is explicit in connecting it to the modeling process help them reflect and connect have students reflect upon the modeling process by assigning metacognitive exercises such as a one minute paper work with instructors from different disciplines to help students make connections between classes to solidify their under standing of modeling using a common framework can help us engage in conversations with colleagues from other disciplines and thus bring the connections to our students give it context again and again ground the modeling investi gation in the biological problem using the experiential representation use the framework to acknowledge and clarify the various approaches that each discipline takes to solving the same scientific problem show that different practitioners have different paths through the boxes that are equally valid give examples of different paths in the same context for information and ideas around using our framework for teaching see the following collection at qubeshub org https qubeshub org primus ruleoffive 45 qubeshub org https qubeshub org primus ruleoffive 38 cd eaton 6 concluding remarks there have been numerous calls for mathematicians to work more closely with members of partner disciplines such as biology to improve student learning and retention in stem e g the mathematical sciences in 2025 and a common vision 40 50 analogous to this there have been numerous calls for biologists to incorporate more mathematical modeling into their curriculum to better prepare students for future ca reers in research and the health professions e g vision and change bio 2010 scientific foundations for future physicians 3 23 38 de spite this widespread agreement on what needs to happen implementing the recommendations has been slow one barrier that must be over come to initiate true transdisciplinary conversations and collaborations on improving the modeling curriculum is to agree upon a common def inition of what is meant by models and modeling between biologists mathematicians and statisticians therefore we have proposed adapt ing the rule of five which has previously informed calculus reform efforts to describe a framework for modeling that can bring all the dis ciplines together this framework defines five types of model represen tations experiential verbal numerical visual and symbolic and modeling activities that provide flexible routes through a modeling investigation by students we give examples about what the implemen tation of this framework may look like in the classroom along with the associated benefits to student learning 52 in particular an advantage for students working with experiential representations is that they provide an entryway for understanding models that do not require the abstraction of symbolic or visual representations the integration of detail needed to understand a numerical representation or the con ceptual knowledge and reading comprehension needed to understand a verbal representation finally we share resources that we think will be helpful for others to use we also hope this framework will unify practitioners coming from different parent fields mathematics statistics biology and others and allow them to find the similarities and differences in their approaches framework for teaching models and modeling 39 to modeling leading to more productive interdisciplinary conversations having initiated such conversations ourselves we have some advice based on our own experiences have a shared goal the goal could be simply to improve student learning in a disciplinary course or it could be to answer a research ques tion of mutual interest one of us found her way to teaching modeling through first forming a research collaboration start small but have a concrete deliverable it is overwhelm ing to try to revamp a whole course a lot can be accomplished by modifying a single lesson plan upon which further course modifications can be built on the research side aim for an internal grant proposal a conference poster or co advising a thesis deadlines help a few of us have been involved in using this framework to modify one lesson plan on hardy weinberg equilibrium what lesson plan would you change first be willing to be both a student and a teacher listen with respect and be open to another perspective we are highly trained in our own disciplines and used to being in the position of expert learning the language culture and foundational knowledge of another discipline requires leaving our comfort zones which by definition is uncomfort able being willing to be uncomfortable requires the courage to be in the vulnerable position of learner versus expert it can be humbling to be a student again but is also an opportunity to remind us of what our own students experience be explicit about language model is not the only word that has different meanings to different disciplines for us defining our language meant writing this paper it is often necessary to clarify meanings to gain insight one tactic is to include one or more students in on conver sations we often naturally change our language and our assumptions about prior knowledge and context to accommodate students and this change should also benefit communication between new interdisciplinary collaborators in addition students benefit from observing and partici pating in interdisciplinary conversations be in it for the long term interdisciplinary relationships take 40 cd eaton time and persistence will pay off if this was easy we would not have the multiplicity of reports encouraging us to do more a positive outcome from these interdisciplinary conversations will be making the connections explicit to students in different disciplinary courses reinforcing the concepts for students and empowering them to apply knowledge from one domain to another making them informed citizens for the 21 st century in their professional futures students will not encounter textbook questions with multiple choice answers instead they will hear a wildlife biologist discuss the rate of population growth they will see a graph in a paper that they are reading they will monitor a population or they will use software to run management scenario planning a student that can move between these representations to help solve problems is one with a superior preparation for the profession we have a trained disciplinary identity but we are all modelers we can work together to help our students be modelers too acknowledgements this work was conducted as part of unpacking the black box teach ing
