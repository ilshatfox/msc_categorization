teaching mathematics with a different philosophy part 1 formal mathematics as biased metaphysics c k raju school of mathematical sciences universiti sains malaysia 11700 penang malaysia ckr ckraju net abstract we report on a pedagogical experiment to make mathematics easy by changing its philosophy the western philosophy of math originated in religious beliefs about mathesis cursed by the church later mathematics was reinterpreted in a theologically correct way using the myth of euclid and his deductive proofs the fact of the empirical proofs in the elements was however contrary to this myth the discrepancy was resolved by hilbert and russell who rejected empirical proofs as unsound reducing all mathematics to metaphysics we explain why that formalist metaphysics is anti utilitarian and culturally biased not universal historically most school level math originated in the non west with a practical epistemology but was absorbed in the west after superimposing on it an incompatible western metaphysics still used to teach it this has made mathematics needlessly complex accordingly math can be made easy and more universal by reverting to a more practical epistemology 1 introduction learning difficulties with math are widespread this paper reports on a study which has a identified the origin of the learning difficulties with math in a novel way b proposed an alternative and c tested the feasibility of teaching that alternative for the case of the calculus course currently taught at the 12 th std and first year university level 2 the analysis to remedy an ailment the first step is to understand its causes why then is math difficult learning difficulties with mathematics are offhand put down to sundry causes lack of good teachers lack of mathematical aptitude etc no doubt an inspired teacher can make any subject interesting however such causes do not explain why so many school students fear math and not geography for example the new answer locates the cause in the nature of the subject the western philosophy of math was religiously oriented hence theological complexities got intertwined with present day math this has made math difficult the idea of math as religiously oriented may seem surprising however the very word mathematics derives from mathesis which means recollection of knowledge from previous lives in plato s meno 1 socrates demonstrates mathesis by questioning an uneducated slave boy to elicit his innate knowledge of mathematics this concludes socrates is proof that the boy has an immortal soul which got that innate knowledge from previous lives why math and not some other form of knowledge because mathematics was believed to incorporate eternal truths which most readily aroused the eternal immortal soul as plato stated 2 arousing the soul was thought to make people virtuous hence in his republic plato advocated the teaching of mathematics to make people virtuous he explicitly rejected mailto ckr ckraju net its practical applications as unimportant this idea of math as good for the soul persisted for a thousand years proclus 5 th c too explained that math leads to the blessed life 3 this connection of mathematics to beliefs about the soul drew it into a religious conflict the christian church initially had similar beliefs about the soul and its previous lives 4 however after marrying the state in the 4 th c the church changed its notion of soul to suit the needs of state power philosophers who persisted with the earlier beliefs about the soul underlying mathesis were violently attacked their key resources libraries and temples 5 were all destroyed 6 those mathematicians who continued to resist like hypatia were lynched her successor proclus was declared a heretic for his belief that the cosmos must be eternal hence uncreated 7 since the truths of math are eternal in 552 ce the church cursed the belief in past lives underlying mathesis those curses are known today as the anathemas against pre existence 8 philosophy and mathematics were banished from christendom mathematics and philosophy were eventually accepted back during the crusades but this entailed an attempt to resolve the theological conflict by reinterpreting the philosophy of math in a theologically correct way this reinterpretation eliminated mathesis from math making it soul less so to say it was claimed that math was only about reasoning and proof thus aligning the philosophy of math with the post crusade christian theology of reason 9 this reinterpretation of mathematics is closely tied to a false history 10 11 which attributes geometry to euclid and claims that his concern was not mathesis but irrefragable demonstration what do we really know about this euclid nothing as a western authority on greek mathematics the late david fowler publicly admitted 12 as for the book elements the available papyri fragments 13 show that it was not standardised even seven centuries after the date of euclid who had supposedly standardised it the name euclid is not mentioned in any greek manuscript of the elements which all attribute it to theon 4 th c or say it is based on his lectures 14 even the greek commentaries do not mention euclid but speak anonymously of the author of the elements 15 perhaps because the author was a woman hypatia theon s daughter hypatia s viewpoint like that of her successor proclus was still that of mathesis so attributing the elements to euclid is critical to the post crusade philosophy of mathematics which delinked math from mathesis crusading historians had another strong motive to falsely attribute texts to early 16 greeks 17 at this time of intense religious fanaticism the church found it difficult to abandon its earlier tradition 18 of burning heretical books and instead translate books captured from the enemy this policy change was justified by the story that all arabic scientific books were written by early greeks and hence were the rightful inheritance of europe which arabs had only preserved later day racist and colonial historians built upon this distorted history which persists to this day in school texts 19 the name euclid is found only in latin translations from the arabic where it may have arisen as a translation mistake a misreading of the arabic ucli des meaning key to geometry as uclides the name of a greek 20 the present day idea of mathematics as proof originates from euclid s purported philosophy of irrefragable demonstration all the evidence for that philosophy is an isolated passage in a late manuscript 21 of proclus commentary that passage is spurious thus it claims that archimedes cited euclid such a citation of the elements not euclid is indeed found in a 15 th c manuscript of the sphere and cylinder 22 somehow attributed to archimedes however citing texts in this modern manner of christian scribes was not the custom in archimedes time further there is only one citation though are many other places in that work where the elements could have been cited but is not hence that isolated archimedes citation is recognized 23 as spurious since the author of the proclus passage knew of the spurious archimedes citation the proclus passage must itself be a spurious interpolation from even later as such there is no serious basis for the belief that greeks ever regarded mathematics as concerned with deductive proof rather than mathesis since so much has been anachronistically read into those two words irrefragable demonstration it should also be mentioned that the spurious passage itself claims that the irrefragable demonstration was based on causes and astrological signs in any case the myth persisted that euclid intended a special metaphysical notion of deductive proof and that myth is used to justify the present day belief that such proofs rather than calculation are the key concern of mathematics that myth is contrary to facts for the elements did make essential use of empirical or physical means of proof in the 1 st and the 4 th side angle side proposition to mention two well known 24 examples if empirical proof is allowed in one place why not in another why not prove the 47 th proposition pythagorean theorem directly by empirical means that greatly simplifies the proof it requires only one step instead of the 46 intermediate propositions actually used in the elements that was how it was proved empirically in one step in indian texts like the yuktibhasa where it is the first proposition not the last so this myth that the elements concerns metaphysical proof makes the elements either trivial or inconsistent proclus could explain that proofs must vary with the kinds of being 25 for he regarded the elements as a religious book concerning mathesis but the inconsistent means of proof cannot be explained on the post crusade reinterpretation of the elements and mathematics as primarily concerned with metaphysical proof the present day philosophy of formal math arose directly from the attempts by hilbert and russell to reconcile a the myth of euclid and his deductive proofs with b the fact of the empirical proofs in the elements the myth prevailed over the facts in their respective tracts 26 on the foundations of geometry both tried to save the story of euclid they rejected those empirical proofs in the elements as unsound since incompatible with the purported intentions of the mythical euclid since the side angle side sas theorem is essential they changed it into a postulate and that is how geometry has been taught in schools 27 since the 1970 s using the sas postulate formalism developed from that analysis on the same lines hilbert and russell made all math completely formal and metaphysical as it is today formalism made even elementary math difficult although russell regarded that 28 as its chief advantage recall that the materialist epicureans had criticised geometry saying that its theorems were obvious even to an ass so non obviousness justifies the philosophy that those theorems needed proofs the postulates used by hilbert to formalise euclidean geometry were similarly intended to make geometry difficult thus euclidean geometry may also be formalised using birkhoff s metric postulates 29 but that again trivialises the elements if it is regarded as primarily concerned with proof for proofs are again simplified but if the elements is trivial then formalism based on it would itself seem ridiculous hence hilbert proposed synthetic geometry which rejects the notion of length this makes elementary geometry much harder but justifies in a general way why the theorems in the elements needed complex proofs however it does not fit the particulars synthetic geometry is not 30 a valid interpretation of the elements thus hilbert s synthetic term congruence is not a valid substitute for the original word equality used in the elements proposition 35 of the elements is about the equality of the areas of incongruent parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallels it is still possible to save the story by claiming that euclid defined area but not length and hence needed lengthy proofs but this is manifestly far fetched moreover it is well known in the philosophy of science that any theory story can be saved from any facts by sufficiently many hypotheses one lie can always be defended by telling a thousand more hence such a long chain of hypotheses is not worth discussing further it is simpler to reject the story setting aside the question of its historical origins in the elements one can enquire about the utility of formalism does formal math suit applications to science and technology the idea of math as metaphysics which is superior to physics naturally makes it less suited for applications to science and technology which concern the physical and empirical for example a discontinuous function is not differentiable on elementary mathematical analysis but is differentiable on the schwartz theory of distributions that is formal mathematics being metaphysical a discontinuous function is differentiable or not as one likes so what should one believe about the partial differential equations of physics do they or do they not apply to 31 observed discontinuities like shock waves or the related singularities actually both definitions of the derivative fail under these circumstances the one because discontinuous functions are not differentiable and the other because the equations of physics are nonlinear and schwartz distributions cannot be multiplied so should we reject them both clearly this believe what you like approach is unsuited to scientific theory which is expected to be definite and refutable the only other option is to allow empirical inputs into mathematics selecting a definition of the derivative based on empirical inputs would explicitly make mathematics an adjunct physical theory as in this author s philosophy empirical inputs always suit science and technology the alternative of banking on mathematical authority is not reliable as the case of riemann shows he mistakenly 32 assumed that entropy is constant across a shock does formalism then provide a universal metaphysics now it is an elementary matter of commonsense that metaphysics can never be universal however the case of 2 2 4 is often naively cited as proof of the universality of mathematics this is na ve because the practical notion of 2 which derives as an abstraction from the empirical observation of 2 dogs 2 stones etc has nothing whatsoever to do with formal mathematics it is perfectly possible to have a formal theory 33 in which 2 2 5 say just as 2 male rabbits and 2 female rabbits may make any number of rabbits over a period of time likewise the circuits on a computer chip routinely implement an arithmetic in which 1 1 0 exclusive disjunction or 1 1 1 inclusive disjunction thus formally it is necessary to specify that the symbols 2 and 4 relate to peano s postulates trying to specify this brings in the metaphysics of infinity a real computer with finite memory not a turing machine can never implement peano arithmetic 34 because the notion of a natural number cannot be finitely specified thus formalism does not provide a universal metaphysics however the philosophy of mathematics as metaphysics combined with the myth of mathematics as universal truth helped to promote a particular brand of metaphysics as universal this is problematic because while formal mathematics is no longer explicitly religious like mathesis its metaphysics remains religiously biased on post crusade christian rational theology it was thought that god is bound by logic cannot create an illogical world but is free to create empirical facts of his choice hence western theologians came to believe that logic which binds god is stronger than empirical facts which do not bind god this theological belief is exactly mirrored in the present day wittgenstein tarski semantics of possible worlds in which logical truths are regarded as necessary truths true in all possible worlds unlike empirical truths which are regarded as weaker contingent truths true in some possible worlds the only difference is that instead of speaking of possible worlds which god could create we speak of possible worlds according to wittgenstein that is the metaphysics of formal math is aligned to post crusade western theology which regarded metaphysics as more reliable than physics in sharp contrast all indian systems of philosophy without any exception accept the empirical pratyaksa as the first means of proof pramana while the lokayata reject inference deduction as unreliable so indian philosophy considered empirical proof as more reliable than logical inference thus the contrary idea of metaphysical proof as stronger than empirical proof would lead at one stroke to the rejection of all indian systems of philosophy this illustrates how the metaphysics of formal math is not universal but is biased against other systems of philosophy now deductive inference is based on logic but which logic deductive proof lacks certainty unless we can answer this question with certainty russell thought like kant 35 that logic is unique and comes from aristotle however one could take instead buddhist or jain logic 36 or quantum logic 37 or the logic of natural language none of which is 2 valued the theorems that can be inferred from a given set of postulates will naturally vary with the logic used for example all proofs by contradiction would fail with buddhist logic one would no longer be able to prove the existence of a lebesgue non measurable set for example this conclusively establishes that the metaphysics of formal math is religiously biased for the theorems of formal mathematics vary with religious beliefs furthermore the metaphysics of formal math has no other basis apart from western culture it can hardly be supported on the empirical grounds it rejects as inferior the religious bias also applies to the postulates in principle a formal theory could begin with any postulates however in practice those postulates are decided by authoritative mathematicians in the west as in hilbert s synthetic geometry the calculus as taught to millions of school students today is based on the notion of limits and the continuum as noted by naquib al attas the idea of an infinitely divisible continuum is contrary to the beliefs of islamic thinkers like al ghazali and al ashari who believed in atomism in fact the calculus originated in india with similar atomistic beliefs that the subdivisions of a circle must stop when they reach atomic proportions this does not affect any practical application all practical application of calculus today can be done using computers which use floating point numbers which are atomistic being finite neglecting small numbers is not necessarily erroneous since it is not very different from neglecting infinitesimals in a non archimedean field and can be similarly formalised since the formal notion of infinitesimal is not god given but is a matter of definition but students are never told this they are told that any real calculation done on a computer is forever erroneous and the only right way to do arithmetic is by using the metaphysics of infinity built into peano s postulates or the postulates of set theory likewise they are taught that the only right way to do calculus is to use limits thus school students get indoctrinated with the western theological biases about infinity built into the notions of formal real numbers and limits which notions are of nil practical value for science and engineering which require real calculation in contrast to this close linkage of mathematics to theology in the west most school math arithmetic algebra trigonometry calculus actually originated in the non west for practical purposes from arabic numerals arithmetic algorithms to trigonometry and calculus this math was imported by the west for the practical advantages it offered to commerce astronomy and navigation 38 this practically oriented non western mathematics actually ganita or hisab had nothing to do with religious beliefs such as mathesis however because of its different epistemology 39 it posed difficulties for the theologically laced notion of mathematics in the west for example from the sulba sutra to aryabhata to the yuktibhasa indian mathematics freely used empirical means of proof obviously an empirical proof will not in any way diminish the practical value of mathematics however trying to force fit this practical non western math into western religiously biased ideas about math as metaphysical made the simplest math enormously complicated colonisation globalised western ideas of mathematics and they continued to be taught today without critical re examination on the principle that phylogeny is ontogeny the actual teaching of mathematics replays in the classroom the historical western difficulties in absorbing non western math 40 that is what makes math difficult today the preceding considerations are illustrated by an example the calculus in part 2 of this article 1 plato meno in dialogues of plato trans b jowett encyclopaedia britannica chicago 1996 pp 179 180 2 plato republic book vii 526 et seq
