framework for studying dihedral repre sentations of the knot group the less well known concept of dehn coloring captures the same data recent work of carter silver williams clarifies the relationship between the two focusing on how one transitions between fox and dehn colorings in our work we relate dehn coloring to the dimer model for knots showing that dehn coloring data is encoded by a certain weighted balanced overlaid tait graph using kasteleyn theory we provide graph theoretic methods for computing the determinant and smith normal form of a knot these constructions are closely related to kauffman s work on a state sum for the alexander polynomial 1 introduction an n fox coloring of a knot diagram assigns an element of z n to each arc subject to a system of congruence relations coming from the crossings for all n n the number of n fox colorings is a knot invariant the collection of n colorings forms a z module and one can study the structure of this module to get a finer invariant an n dehn coloring assigns an element of z n to each bounded face of a diagram such that a different system of crossing congruence conditions holds fox and dehn coloring are related by a change of presentation of the knot group the concept of fox coloring was first introduced by ralph fox to haverford college undergraduates as a way to the study of maps from knot groups into dihedral groups fox colorings of arcs correspond to maps written in terms of the wirtinger generators fox coloring is well studied and has led to some interesting results including the kauffman harary conjecture 8 15 17 20 less studied are dehn colorings 1 10 here labeling faces of the knot diagram corresponds to maps defined on dehn generators in this paper we study knot colorings from the perspective of the dimer model for knots which is introduced in 3 this is closely related to kauffman s state sum model for the alexander polynomial 10 where marked states are replaced with dimer coverings we show how dehn coloring data can be directly obtained from the balanced overlaid tait bot graph this is especially convenient when the knot diagram is alternating we show that if one was to attempt the same graph theoretic interpretation of fox coloring data the resulting graph is not always planar in this sense dehn coloring is a preferable framework via kasteleyn theory we offer a simple proof of the classical result relating the number of maximal trees in the tait graph of an alternating diagram to the knot determinant 5 this has since been generalized in the context of ribbon graphs coming from knot projections on the turaev surface 6 we give an algorithm for determining the smith normal form of the authors would like to thank oliver dasbach for his guidance and comments the furst program nsf dms 1156273 at csu fresno for research support and jozef przytycki for his consistent support and mentorship within the knot theory community 1 http arxiv org abs 1510 02023 v 1 the knot i e the structure of the coloring module via the bot graph we give sufficient conditions on the bot graph for a knot to have trivial smith normal form 2 fox and dehn coloring this section explores the relationship between fox and dehn n colorings by building on the recent work of carter silver williams 1 we give an explicit formula for a dihedral homomorphism coming from a dehn coloring in lemma 2 2 and show that the given map agrees with the carter silver williams combinatorial bijection between fox and dehn color ings in the exposition that follows we fix n n and a diagram d of a knot k let a be the set of arcs and f the set of faces of d a fox n coloring of d is a map c a z n with the property that twice the label of the overstrand at each crossing is congruent to the sum of the labels of the understands modulo n this is illustrated in figure 1 we denote the set of all fox n colorings of d by coln d a dehn n coloring of d is a map c f z n for which the sum of the face labels on either side of the over strand are congruent to one another modulo n as one passes through each crossing and the unbounded face maps to 0 the local relation for dehn coloring is shown in figure 1 we denote the set of dehn n colorings by c oln d fox and dehn 5 colorings of a figure eight knot diagram can be found in figure 2 a b c 2 a b c mod n a fox coloring a b c d a b c d mod n b dehn coloring figure 1 coloring congruence relations both coln d and c oln d have a z module structure under vector addition modulo n we therefore refer to them as the fox and dehn n coloring modules another fundamental property of these modules is that they are independent of choice of diagram for a knot 20 hence they are knot invariants and we can write coln k and c oln k we will briefly describe the z module isomorphism c oln d coln d between dehn and fox n colorings given in 1 note that all addition below is computed modulo n let c be a dehn n coloring and say a a define c a c f c f where f f f are faces of d separated by arc a the dehn coloring conditions ensure that the resulting labeling is well defined and yields a fox n coloring the process of obtaining a dehn coloring from a fox coloring is more complicated let c be a fox n coloring begin by defining 1 c u 0 for the unbounded face u f for any internal face f f choose a path from u to f that intersects the dia gram transversely and does not interact with crossings say the sequence of faces and arcs intersecting the path is given by u f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 am 1 fm f the value 1 c f is inductively defined as one traverses this path for 1 i m set 1 c fi c ai 1 1 c fi 1 carter silver williams call this process integration 2 along that path and they prove that integration of fox colorings is conservative in the sense that the result is independent of path 1 an example of a corresponding pair of fox and dehn 5 colorings is shown in figure 2 0 2 3 44 1 2 4 0 1 figure 2 corresponding dehn and fox colorings of a figure eight knot diagram every diagram has at least n distinct n colorings which we call trivial the trivial fox n colorings are the n constant maps recall every knot diagram has a unique checkerboard shading such that the outer face is white i e unshaded trivial dehn colorings assign the value 0 to every unshaded face and some fixed value to the remaining faces one can easily verify that maps the trivial dehn coloring with values 0 and l to the trivial fox coloring that labels every strand with l trivial fox and dehn n colorings form submodules of coln d and c oln d and the quotients of the n coloring modules by trivial colorings are referred to as the based n coloring modules summarizing we have the following theorem from 1 theorem 2 1 carter silver williams the map is an isomorphism of the fox and dehn n coloring modules and induces an isomorphism on the based fox and dehn n coloring mod ules the fundamental group of the knot complement typically denoted 1 k has two well known presentations the wirtinger and dehn presentations we will only need a few properties of these presentations in our exposition which we recall here for more extensive information on wirtinger and dehn presentations see for instance 21 both wirtinger and dehn presentations are given in terms of generators and relations based on a diagram d the wirtinger presentation has generators in one to one correspon dence with the set a with one relation for each crossing in the dehn presentation the generating set corresponds to the set f the unbounded face gives a trivial element with one relation for each crossing in the following discussion we conflate the notions of arcs and faces and their corresponding generators finally the following fact is needed in the proof of theorem 2 3 if some path from the unbounded face u to a face f passes through the following sequence of arcs and faces u f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 am 1 fm f then in 1 k we have f a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 m 1 the signs come from the fact that the wirtinger presentation depends on an orientation of d while the dehn presentation does not let d 2 n s n 1 s 2 s s 1 be the standard presentation for the dihedral group with 2 n elements corresponding to a fox n coloring c there is a homomorphism c 1 k d 2 n given by c a s c a where a a is a wirtinger generator of 1 k we now get the following theorem due to fox c f 20 for a proof 3 theorem 2 2 fox the relation c c is a bijection between the set of all fox n colorings and the set of maps from 1 k into d 2 n sendng wirtinger generators to reflections let c be an n dehn coloring again note that the checkerboard shading of d where the unbounded region is unshaded is unique define the map c 1 k d 2 n as follows where f f is a dehn generator of 1 k c f s c f if f is a shaded face and c f if f is an unshaded face this definition of c agrees with the map as shown in the following theorem theorem 2 3 the map c is a homomorphism moreover c c proof let c be a dehn n coloring with c c and let f f be a dehn generator of 1 k say u f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 am 1 fm f is the ordered list of faces and arcs along some path from the unbounded face u to f then f can be written in terms of wirtinger generators as f a 11 a 1 2 a 1 m 1 by definition of we know c f c am 1 c fm 1 c a 1 c a 2 c am 1 in the dihedral group reflections are their own inverses so s j 1 s j for all j it follows that c f c a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 m 1 c a 1 c a 2 c am 1 s c a 1 s c a 2 s c am 1 sk c a 1 c a 2 c am 1 sk c f from this calculation we see that c f s c f or c f c f depending on the parity of k while k may depend on the choice of path from u to f the parity of k does not furthermore we see that the parity of k encodes checkerboard shading information indeed if k is odd then f is a shaded face and if k is even then f is unshaded we conclude that c f c f 3 invariants obtained from coloring data given a diagram d let col d be the the free abelian group generated by the set of arcs modulo the fox coloring relations taken over z rather than z n similarly define c ol d to be the free abelian group generated by the set of faces of modulo the dehn coloring relations taken over z we call col d and c ol d respectively the fox and dehn coloring modules the aim of this section is to study these modules as with n coloring modules one can show that the fox and dehn coloring modules are isomorphic via the map lemma 3 1 by computing sums over z rather than z n the map induces a z module isomorphism of col d and c ol d coloring modules encode a wealth of information indeed combining lemma 3 1 with results about fox coloring we get the following theorem these results are due to fox but one can find proofs compatible with our discussion in 20 4 theorem 3 2 let d be a diagram of a knot k then we have the following 1 coloring modules are invariant under reidemeister moves so we can write them as col k c ol k 2 the coloring module reduced modulo n is the n coloring module in other words col k z n coln k c oln k c ol k z n 3 coloring modules encode important topological information in particular col k c ol k h 1 md 2 z z where h 1 md 2 z is the first homology group of the cyclic branched double cover of s 3 branched along k 4 coloring modules have rank 1 in other words h 1 md 2 z is torsion 5 the order of h 1 md 2 z is the absolute value of the alexander polynomial at 1 the theorem above demonstrates that the torsion part h 1 md 2 z of the coloring module denoted here by t col k t c ol k to emphasize the coloring connection is of primary interest since it determines for which n a knot is n colorable the order of t col k is known as the determinant of the knot and is denoted by det k the following result about n colorability due to fox is implied by part 2 of theorem 3 2 corollary 3 3 fox a knot is n colorable if and only if gcd det k n 6 1 in section 5 we give a method for computing det k graph theoretically to count the number of n colorings of a knot one needs to look not only at the quantity det k but at the entire structure of t col k we can determine this structure using relations matrices for the fox and dehn coloring modules given a reduced k crossing diagram d for a knot k a relations matrix m d for col k has one row for each crossing and one column for each arc similarly a relations matrix m d for c ol k has one row for each crossing and one column for each bounded face by euler characteristic arguments we see that m d is a k k square matrix while m d has dimensions k k 1 the precise matrices obtained depend on an ordering of the crossings arcs and faces of the diagram figure 3 shows an example 1 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 1 0 1 2 0 1 m d a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 f 1 f 3 f 2 f 5 f 4 m d 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 figure 3 presentation matrices for the fox and dehn coloring modules of the figure eight knot since we are most interested in t col k t c ol k it is useful to find appropriate submatrices of m d and m d that describe only these submodules for fox coloring the following result explains how to obtain this submatrix for a proof see 15 theorem 3 4 removing any one generator and one relation from the presentation of col k does not impact the group structure furthermore removing any one generator gives a presentation for t col k 5 using the isomorphism we can determine a relations submatrix for t c ol k it is important to emphasize that these two presentations are for the same module we will see however that the dehn coloring module presentation has important advantages in our context theorem 3 5 removing a single generator corresponding to any face adjacent to the un bounded face of d gives a presentation for t c ol k proof let f be a face of d adjacent to the unbounded face and a be an arc separating them by theorem 3 4 the submodule m col d generated by all arcs except a modulo crossing relations is t col k by definition of the map it follows that 1 m t c ol k and 1 m is generated by all faces except f modulo crossing relations denote by m d and m d respectively the submatrices both square presenting the fox and dehn coloring torsion submodules we obtain m d by removing any one row and any one column of m d while m d is obtained by removing one column from m d that corresponds to a face adjacent to the unbounded face these are two different presentation matrices for the full torsion submodule of the coloring module to determine the structure of this submodule we can compute the smith normal form of either of these matrices we review this process in preparation for the upcoming sections let x be a matrix with integer entries the smith normal form of x denoted snf x is the diagonal matrix with entries s 1 sk such that si si 1 for all 1 i k where si di di 1 and di is the gcd of all i i minors of x the values si are called invariant factors and the values di are called determinental divisors of the matrix 18 if x is a presentation matrix for an abelian group g then the invariant factors completely determine the structure of g in particular g z s 1 z s 2 z sk any two presentation matrices for the same group will yield the same list of invariant factors up to insertion or deletion of 1 s ge jablan kauffman lopes have a useful theorem which interprets snf data specifically as it relates to colorings 7 we restate it using our notation theorem 3 6 let n be some positive integer let s 1 sk be the list of invariant factors in the smith normal form for m d or m d then the number of n colorings of d is coln d c oln d n k i 1 gcd si n we conclude this section by computing snf m d from the example in figure 3 re moving the first column from m d gives the presentation matrix for t c ol k shown below using the algorithm described above we obtain the diagonal matrix shown hence 6 we conclude that c ol k z 5 z and the determinant of the knot is 5 if gcd 5 n 1 then t c oln k z n for any multiple 5 l of 5 we have t c ol 5 l k z 5 z 5 l m d 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 snf m d 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 5 in the case of the figure eight knot the smith normal form does not give any more in formation than the determinant when the determinant is composite with repeated factors though smith normal form is a finer invariant note that we could just as easily have com puted smith normal form using the presentation matrix for the entire coloring module in that case one additional invariant factor of 0 would appear the graph theoretic computa tions in the next two sections work by focusing on the torsion part which is why we have emphasized it here 4 encoding matrix data via graphs we have not yet seen any substantive differences between fox and dehn coloring the remainder of the paper shows how dehn coloring more naturally lends itself to interpreting coloring data using graphs we begin with a review of pertinent graph theory terms and a discussion about how one can interpret any matrix as a weighted bipartite graph a bipartite graph v w e has vertex sets v and w and edge set e where all edges have one endpoint in v and one in w when e contains every possible edge between v and w we say that is a complete bipartite graph complete bipartite graphs on n m vertices are sometimes denoted kn m a complete graph on n vertices denoted by kn has n vertices with every possible edge between them a graph is called planar if it can be properly embedded in the plane a plane graph is a planar graph with a chosen embedding a graph h is called a minor of a graph if h comes from deleting vertices and deleting or contracting edges of a well known result in graph theory states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain k 5 or k 3 3 as a minor 23 a dimer is an edge in a graph a dimer covering is a subset m of e such that each vertex in is an endpoint of exactly one edge in m dimer coverings are also called perfect matchings letm be the set of all dimer coverings of note thatm whenever v 6 w given a p q matrix x xij we construct a weighted complete bipartite graph x v w e x with vertex sets v v 1 vp and w w 1 wq and weight function x viwj xij according to this definition the graph x corresponding to any matrix with p q 3 would contain an induced copy of the complete bipartite graph k 3 3 and hence would be nonplanar for our purposes it is sufficient to restrict to edges with nonzero weight even with the convention of omitting weight zero edges many matrices do not produce planar graphs we are particularly interested in the graphs corresponding to m d and m d remark 4 1 there exist knot diagrams d for which m d is not planar as an example consider the diagram for the knot 942 shown in figure 4 the figure also shows a corresponding presentation matrix m d for t col 942 the graph m d and a 7 subgraph of m d that is a subdivision of k 3 3 since m d contains a a subdivision of k 3 3 it is not a planar graph d m d 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 m d figure 4 a nonplanar graph corresponding to t col 942 the graph m d on the other hand is always planar with a particularly nice plane embedding reflecting the structure of the knot in fact this graph is a weighting of the balanced overlaid tait graph which has appeared in several recent papers 2 3 4 a balanced overlaid tait bot graph d v w e corresponding to a knot diagram d which is used in 3 see also 2 4 is constructed as follows the vertex set v is the set of crossings of d the vertex set w is the set of all but one bounded face of d the omitted face is always chosen to be adjacent to the unbounded face given vertices x v and y w the edge xy e if and only if the crossing x is incident to face y planarity of the bot graph follows directly from its construction this graph is called the balanced overlaid tait graph since it comes from superimposing the two tait graphs corresponding to the diagram and introducing a third vertex set where the two graphs meet this means that the bot graph is in fact tripartite but we will not use this here whenever we consider bot graphs we fix the plane embedding that comes from the knot diagram lemma 4 2 consider a knot diagram d and presentation matrix m d for t c ol d that comes from removing face generator f the graph m d is the weighted bot graph for d coming from omitting face f 8 figure 5 a bot graph for a figure eight diagram proof the matrix m d is obtained from m d by removing one column corresponding to the bounded face f of d adjacent to the unbounded region the graph m d has one vertex for each crossing and one vertex for each bounded face except f an edge of m d has nonzero weight exactly when a face and crossing meet hence m d with edges of weight 0 omitted is exactly the bot graph for d that comes from omitting face f for an example of a bot graph see figure 5 in the figure the knot diagram is in gray the omitted bounded face is marked with an asterisk and doubled lines indicate edges with weight 1 solid edges have weight 1 now that we have explained a method for translating a matrix to a graph the goal is to graph theoretically compute matrix data using dimer coverings and kasteleyn theory this method was originally developed to work in the opposite direction to obtain graph data via a matrix 9 22 indeed if one has a planar graph the number of perfect matchings can be computed by taking a certain determinant we briefly recall selected concepts from kasteleyn theory below for more details see 11 12 13 14 let v w e be a simple weighted bipartite graph with v v 1 vp and w w 1 wq then the weight matrix for denoted by m is a p q matrix with entries xij given by xij viwj if viwj e and 0 otherwise up to transposition and rearrangement of rows and columns m m d m d in particular up to sign these two matrices have the same determinant and the same smith normal form the following partition function z which computes a sum over the set m of dimer coverings or perfect matchings of is of particular interest in statistical physics z m m e m e note that if 1 then z counts the dimer coverings of also note that in terms ofm we have perm m z where perm m is the permanent or unsigned determinant of the matrix m when is planar and in certain other cases we won t consider here one can modify the weighting so that z can be computed via a determinant this modification is called a kasteleyn weighting let v w e be a bipartite plane graph a kasteleyn weighting e 1 has the property that each bounded face with 0 mod 4 edges has an odd number of 1 assignments and each bounded face with 2 mod 4 edges has an even number of 1 assignments 9 theorem 4 3 kasteleyn every bipartite plane graph has a kasteleyn weighting one can prove theorem 4 3 constructively for a proof see 3 finally we state kaste leyn s theorem which is crucial for our constructions in the next section for a proof of this theorem see 13 theorem 4 4 kasteleyn let v w e be a weighted bipartite plane graph and let v w e where is any kasteleyn weighting of then z m m e m e e perm m det m or equivalently z perm m det m 5 dimers and the snf the coloring data for a knot can be completely obtained from the dehn or fox coloring matrix while this is computationally convenient the matrix may obscure important struc tural information about the knot our goal in computing matrix quantities using the bot graph is to more directly relate coloring data to properties of the diagram the approach of interpreting a determinant via a partition function is not new it has been used in the study of ozsva th szabo knot floer homology theory and by the last author and coauthors in studying twisted alexander polynomials 3 16 19 applying theorems 4 3 and 4 4 the following algorithm shows how the determinant of a knot can be computed via a partition function on a bot graph algorithm 5 1 given a diagram d for a knot k one can compute det k as follows 1 construct a weighted bot graph d with weighting coming from the dehn coloring conditions at each crossing call this the dehn weighting figure 6 shows a local weighting where double edges indicate a 1 weight figure 6 a local dehn weighting 2 fix a kasteleyn weighting on d for alternating knots lemma 5 2 shows there is a convenient choice 3 compute det k via the following formula det k z d m m e m e e alternating diagrams have a particularly natural kasteleyn weighting as demonstrated by the following lemma even if one has a nonalternating knot we can apply this result to get a kasteleyn weighting by considering an alternating knot with the same shadow lemma 5 2 the dehn weighting on a bot graph for an alternating diagram is a kasteleyn weighting 10 proof every bounded face of the bot graph is a square so in order to have a kasteleyn weighting each bounded face should have one or three edges with weight 1 if a diagram is alternating each bounded face in the bot graph comes from an alternating pair of crossings as shown below each edge of the square face shown will have a weight of either 1 or 1 the dehn coloring relations require that the two lefthand edges have the same weight while the two righthand edges have opposite weights with those constraints the square face will always have exactly one or three edges with weight 1 lemma 5 2 implies that the number of perfect matchings of a bot graph for an alternating diagram is the determinant of the associated knot as we discuss afterwards this is a classical result about the number of spanning trees of the tait graph of an alternating diagram reworded in the language of the bot graph 5 corollary 5 3 let d be a bot graph for an alternating diagram d of a knot k then det k is the number of dimer coverings on d proof let m d be a matrix for t c ol d lemma 4 2 showed that m d d is a bot graph for d lemma 5 2 showed that the dehn weighting e 1 is a kasteleyn weighting applying kasteleyn s theorem 4 4 we see that det k det m d z d m m e m e 2 m m e m 1 m in formal knot theory 10 kauffman discusses the one to one correspondence between marked states of the link diagram and rooted spanning trees of the tait graph paired with rooted spanning trees of the dual to the tait graph there is an obvious one to one correspondence between kauffman s marked states and elements ofm which is discussed in 3 the reader can also see 2 for more on correspondences between these objects figure 7 shows a corresponding marked diagram perfect matching and spanning tree figure 7 a corresponding marked diagram perfect matching and spanning tree so far we have encoded the dehn torsion matrix as a weighted graph and computed its determinant via a partition function the final goal is to compute the smith normal form of the knot from this perspective the graph theoretic analog of a matrix minor is an induced subgraph removing rows and columns of a matrix corresponds to removing vertices in the 11 associated graph we give a general algorithm for computing snf k and then focus on cases where this algorithm can be simplified algorithm 5 4 consider a k crossing diagram d for a knot k compute snf k as follows 1 construct a dehn weighted bot graph d v w e as in algorithm 5 1 2 beginning with i k compute di using the following steps for each pair of subsets v v and w w with v w i consider the induced subgraph v w d of the bot graph spanned by v w fix a kasteleyn weighting v w on v w d using the following formula compute dv w wheremv w is the set of all dimer coverings of v w d dv w m m v w e m v w e e then di can be computed as di gcd dv w v w i if di 1 then dj 1 for all 1 j i if di 6 1 then decrement i by one and repeat the above computation 3 finally we have si di di 1 and s 1 s 2 sk determines snf k in algorithm 5 4 for each subset v w of the vertex set of d we must determine a new kasteleyn weighting on the induced subgraph v w d in general this is tedious but there are certain cases where computations are easier for example when one removes a pair of adjacent vertices and all edges incident to them from d any kasteleyn weighting on d restricted to the remaining subgraph is still a kasteleyn weighting lemma 5 5 let v w e be a plane bipartite graph equipped with a kasteleyn weight ing let v v and w w be a pair of adjacent vertices in then restricts to a kasteleyn weighting on the subgraph of obtained by removing v and w proof if the edge vw or one of the vertices v or w is incident to the unbounded face then removing all edges connected to v and w will not introduce new bounded faces hence will restrict to a kasteleyn weighting of the subgraph induced by all vertices except v and w now assume that neither the edge vw nor the vertices v or w are incident to the unbounded face say that there are l faces enumerated f 1 fl that contain v or w or both as part of their boundaries each of these is bounded and square let yi be the number of 1 weights on edges of fi incident to v or w let zi be the number of 1 weights on edges of fi not incident to v or w since is a kasteleyn weighting and all faces are square it follows that yi zi is odd for all i consider l i 1 yi zi l i 1 yi l i 1 zi the sum l i 1 yi is always even since each edge adjacent to v or w is part of two faces in the list f 1 fl since yi zi is odd for all i the entire sum has the same parity as l we conclude that l i 1 zi has the same parity as l consider the subgraph of obtained by removing v w and any edges incident to v and w any bounded face of not containing v or w persists in this subgraph and thus satisfies the kasteleyn condition on each of these faces there is one new face created when v and w are removed which has 2 l 2 edges since removing v and w deletes 3 edges from 2 faces and 2 edges from the other l 2 faces with v or w in their boundaries if l is odd then 2 l 2 0 mod 4 if l is even then 2 l 2 2 mod 4 the number of 1 weights around the new face is l i 1 zi which matches the parity of l this means that the kasteleyn condition 12 is satisfied on the only face that has been modified by deleting v and w hence restricts to a kasteleyn weighting on this induced subgraph there is another observation that can be useful when computing minors graph theoret ically this gives conditions under which a weighted edge can be added to a graph while maintaining the kasteleyn weighting as a corollary we can compute certain minors without modifying kasteleyn weightings lemma 5 6 let v w e be a plane bipartite graph equipped with a kasteleyn weight ing say v v and w w with vw e if the edge vw can be added to while maintaining planarity of its embedding then extends to a kasteleyn weighting on vw proof the addition of vw to will split some face f into two smaller faces if f has 2 l edges then l 2 since we should not obtain a multigraph by adding vw and vw splits f into faces of size 2 m and 2 l m 1 for some 1 m l if l is even then 2 l 0 mod 4 and assigns an odd number of 1 weights to the edges of f note that l even implies that m and l m 1 have opposite parity therefore when vw is added one new face will have an even number of 1 weights and the other will have an odd number if l is odd then 2 l 2 mod 4 and assigns an odd number of 1 weights to the edges of f for l odd note that m and l m 1 have the same parity when vw is added to either both new faces will have an odd number of 1 weights or both will have an even number in any of the above cases it follows that either both new faces or neither of the new faces will have the correct number of 1 signs needed for a kasteleyn weighting if no additional 1 weights are needed set vw 1 otherwise setting vw 1 will yield a kasteleyn weighting on vw corollary 5 7 let v w e be a planar bipartite graph with kasteleyn weighting and nonadjacent vertices v v w w lying on a common face then restricts to a kasteleyn weighting on v w using these results there are shortcuts for computing snf k one begins the snf computation by finding the det k dk already if dk is prime or has no repeating prime factors then by the definition of snf we know sk dk det k and si 1 for all 1 i k in this case the coloring torsion module is cyclic with det k in hand one can determine the possible smith normal forms and hence the maximum number of iterations of algorithm 5 4 needed even when det k is composite with repeated factors there are certain cases when we can determine that the coloring torsion module is cyclic without removing every possible pair of vertices an edge e in a graph is called a forcing edge if there is exactly one dimer covering of containing it 24 more generally a subset s of the vertex set of is called a forcing set if s is contained in exactly one dimer covering of using this language the following theorem gives a graph theoretic sufficient condition for determining when the coloring torsion module is cyclic theorem 5 8 if a bot graph for a diagram d of k has a forcing edge then snf k has invariant factors 1 1 detk and the coloring torsion module is cyclic 13 corollary 5 9 if a bot graph for an k crossing diagram d of k has a forcing set of size 2 m then snf k has at most k m nontrivial factors example 5 10 consider the alternating diagram for the knot 88 and its bot graph shown in figure 8 one can verify that there are 25 dimer coverings thus det k d 8 25 this means that the snf 88 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 25 or snf 88 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 the third part of figure 8 shows the subgraph induced on all but two vertices by corollary 5 7 the number of perfect matchings in the subgraph is the corresponding 7 7 minor all forced edges are red there are only two possible matchings this means d 7 1 or d 7 2 since d 8 is odd and d 7 must divide d 8 we know that d 7 1 we conclude that snf 88 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 25 and the coloring torsion module is cyclic figure 8 a bot graph and induced subgraph for 88 references 1 j scott carter daniel s silver and susan g williams three
