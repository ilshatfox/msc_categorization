italia universit paris saclay cnrs laboratoire de math matiques d orsay 91405 orsay france september 7 2021 1 introduction the so called new technologies are nowadays pervasive in every aspect of our lives and their use in communica tion of science and education is an established need the aims for such an use can be various on the one hand in the spirit of improving teaching computers can be used to improve the standards of the materials that are offered to the students as much as it is allowed by the new me dia on a completely different point of view the use of computerized tests can have the effect of reducing teach ers load of work so to save energies that then can be directed towards tasks more significant than just mark ing furthermore the possibility to build personalized environments could put the students in the position to work at their own pace and develop self directed learning skills having been engaged in the development of wims www interactive multipurpose server since almost two decades we wish to contribute with an analysis of our experiences about the benefits that these technologies can bring along 2 about wims the wims system started as an individual project by xiao gang based at d partement de math matiques at universit de nice sophia antipolis france and had been made available to the public domain in 1998 34 xiao s project aimed at a systematic approach for pro viding internet accessible mathematical computations 34 it included since the beginning basic lms like functionalities virtual classes for teacher to dis pense learning materials to the students and monitor their achievements a grading system a forum for a com plete description see 11 nowadays under the name wims you can find a network of servers sharing inter active resources at many levels in various subjects not only mathematics but also biology chemistry economics languages physics most of which have automatic correction and marking of user input the lms func tionalities in wims significantly evolved since the begin ning better user management better feedback for users inputs e g through opportune links to specific docu ments compiled by the teachers wims also provides a secure exam mode the characteristic for which today wims still stands out from the other currently available lms is the built in possibility of extensively using random parameters in the coding of the learning objects 1 and the capability of interacting with softwares of the most different kinds these two features combined allow for the creation of complex and engaging exercises a well designed use of random parameters enable wims to provide a virtually infinite set of copies of each single activity 2 1 a first approach to wims the simplest use of wims in mathematics is to let it act as a user friendly web interface for asking for computations for example the tool function calculator 27 interacts with public domain softwares as maxima 2 pari gp 3 and gnuplot 4 the user inserts the query in the mask shown in figure 1 a and gets the answer shown in fig ure 1 b it is up to wims to choose among all the possi bilities the software more suitable for each task 5 if we focus on the more complex task of managing in teractive activities and effectively analyzing user answers one of the strengths of wims is its ability to interact with representations and drawings for example the activity triangular shoot 33 allows the users to familiarise with the centers of a triangle barycenter orthocenter incenter and circumcenter every time the exercise is selected a different randomly generated triangle is proposed in the easier version of the exercise a triangle is given and the user has to click on one of the centers see figure 2 a the 1 random parameters can also be used in the editing of docu ments 2 http maxima sourceforge net 3 http pari math u bordeaux fr 4 http www gnuplot info 5 the tool is freely available on any wims server e g you can access and test it

answer figure 1 wims tool user s reply is evaluated and marked see figure 2 b to better experience with such concepts triangular shoot also includes the reverse problem see figure 3 given two vertices of the triangle and its barycenter can you identify the missing vertex of the triangle 2 2 the structure of wims wims has a modular structure module is the term used by wims for any of its units a standard installation of the latest version of wims includes about 50 adminis trative modules and about 1800 learning modules when ever a new task is required a new administrative module can be added to the system to provide such functionality the learning modules include what wims calls tools e g the already described function calculator as well as learning objects contributed by the teachers themselves exercises virtual classes manuals designed accord ing to their individual needs and then shared with the whole community as mathematics is concerned wims is fully latex aware and it can interact with the already mentioned maxima pari gp and gnuplot it can also interact a barycenter i b barycenter analysis of the answer figure 2 barycenter figure 3 barycenter inverse problem with gap

for example jsme 12 and jsmol 13 are used in exercises on molecular represen tations in the module amino acids 15 jsmol is also used to draw polyhedra see the online tool convex poly hedra 21 all of wims learning modules are classified by the au thors via keywords according to the topics covered and a search engine is provided the ever expanding tree of keywords can be navigated via the browse by subject module see figure 4 classifications according to school figure 4 browse by subject levels from pre school to university postdoc are also pro vided 3 the community started as a one man project wims owes its growth to the large community that xiao was able to gather around his work the project was published in the public do main giving open access to developers and to translators the core of wims is available in french english italian dutch chinese slovene spanish and catalan xiao also called for the cooperation of teachers pro moting for them training seminars on the programming of exercises from its very beginning the development of wims relies on contacts between the developers and the community of teachers who constantly report bugs and 12 https peter ertl com jsme 13 http jmol sourceforge net give ideas for improvements since 2006 periodical collo quia are held e g see 12 in order to discuss progresses in the use of wims and possible development strategies in july 2007 wimsedu enseignants d veloppeurs et utilisateurs de wims 14 was founded an association with the aim of strengthening this community share skills act as interlocutors for wims users towards users of other software or institutions discuss and influence the directions of its development by supporting the chosen projects create a dynamic collaborative work through its website identify support and inform about training ac tions wimsedu carries on the tradition of the collo ques nice 2006 nice 2007 bordeaux 2010 rennes 2012 dunkerque 2014 annecy 2016 paris orsay 2018 amiens 2020 and the meeting of different experiences contin ues mathematicians and non mathematicians developers and users researchers and teachers from any educational level in the colloquia experiences of use are confronted technical difficulties are discussed and innovations are pro posed the association pursues its goals of acting as the glue of this community also by directly managing a server of distribution of learning modules through which the au thors can share the exercises and documents they have designed for their students so that they are published on all of wims servers the actual development of the core of wims is carried out by a volunteers development team whose activities are intertwined with wimsedu actions many of the team members are university staff but no academic institution is directly involved apart from host ing main servers in the wims network servers generally used for institutional didactics an important share of the work is still carried out by teachers of any school levels from primary school teachers to university profes sors the source code of the core of the system in a public domain spirit is hosted by the french public in terest group renater 15 which in this way provides an essential suport for wims 16 4 wims for mathematics educa tion wims can be used for mathematics teaching as it allows to provide students with a big amount of engaging exer cises there are many descriptions of experiences with wims for teaching e g see 2 3 10 14 24 25 13 6 showing at different school levels in different class situations in different subjects that wims based exercises

solving we believe that problem solving la polya is a crucial step for a real understanding of mathematics to gain a taste for mathematics pupils should be lead to actively work on a difficult problem and to develop a viable solution for such a problem given the necessary amount of time 23 the use of automatic exercises might conflict with this idea by beeing given a large amount of similar exercises students might get the idea that the goal of mathematics is to find the fastest strategy to in order to get a computer approved answer strategy that not always corresponds to a real understanding of the subject this attitude is even stronger if wims exercises are used for exams it is indeed a difficult equilibrium and a particular effort must be put on the design and selection of the learning objects and on the monitoring of students activity on these ex ercises for example wims proposes standard number pyramids drills for practicing sums e g at a primary school level as the one shown in figure 5 a if compared to a paper and pencil corresponding version of this exer cise the advantage of this computer based version is that the student have an immediate feedback and can repeat the exercise as many times as wanted it is easy to pre dict and in fact we could observe the phenomenon that this exercise can lead the students to develop improper strategies after a few tries the students can understand that there is actually no need of calculating any sum but a computer validated solution of the exercise can be ob tained very quickly just putting the biggest number above and the two smaller numbers below this way of finding the answer for the exercise can be considered wrong if the aim of the teacher is having pupils work with com putation of sums the teacher should monitor students work and if needed should act so to avoid students to rely on this unwanted strategy and lead them to proceed a step forward to tackle more advanced tasks a simple way to gain this is to switch to a version of the same ex ercise which proposes more option for the numbers to be dragged into the pyramid as the one shown in figure 5 b the presence of an extra number to be set aside forces the user to actually do the sums or to find a more creative strategy the example in figure 5 b also allows us to show that in wims you can design exercises with mul tiple correct solutions thus countering the formation of one of the most deleterious students belief mathemat ics problems have one and only one right answer cfr 26 p 359 furthermore in a problem solving perspective present ing automatically a full solution for the exercise as soon as the student makes a mistake can be counterproductive as this could prevent the actual understanding of the errors a number pyramids i b number pyramids ii figure 5 number pyramids and interfere with the pursuit for an autonomous solution wims allows for the creation of feedbacks that provide alerts for classical errors or hints to help students to per severe in their search for example the module probabil ity distribution plots 17 contains an activity that shows how a feedback can indicate to the student an expected property that is not satisfied by his answer see figure 6 teachers that use wims with their students can interact with the exercises s author and suggest suitable feedbacks 4 2 mathematicians point of view mathematicians can contribute to the development of wims by pointing out which are the aspects of the dis cipline that the learning objects should focus on going back to triangular shoot we can notice that the author of the exercise a mathematician did not want to test users on the question what is the barycenter of a triangle 4 figure 6 statement and feedback in exercise a standard normal random variable as the definition of such point is right in the statement shown to the user as you can see in figure 2 a rather the aim of the exercise is to use the definition and ac tively manipulate such notion too often students are led to believe that most of mathematics consists of pure memorization of facts and do not manage to get any real insight of the different facets of each concept a problem should be the mean to lead students grasp the theory underneath it an example in this direction is the series of activities on symmetry that are proposed these exercises are built on different levels to gradually lead learners to tackle more and more complex concepts e g in the module oef rosettes 4 you can start level a with the simple task of tracing any symmetry axis of a given figure and later you can proceed to the more complex task level d shown in figure 7 of find ing the two symmetry axes that generate the whole n kaleidoscopes rosette pattern e g see 8 the idea of manipulating mathematical objects can be exploited in various fields of mathematics the module oef graphics study of differential equations or simple differential systems 22 contains an activity in which the user can interact with the solution curves of differential system in order to gain information about its isoclines see figure 8 a similar manipulation can be useful in other domains such as probability where many results are counter intuitive for beginners exercises in which simu lated data and probability distributions are presented can help students to have a better understanding of what kind of events may appear frequently by chance and what a probability distribution represents e g in the exercise figure 7 symmetry axes level d a statement b manipulations by the user figure 8 isoclines 5 poisson distribution of the module point estimation in statistics 16 the outcome of a poisson point process simulation on a square is drawn the aim of the exercise is to find the empirical measure of the number of points in each cell of the given cartesian grid and to estimate the intensity of this process see figure 9 once the student has given his answer the relative frequencies of the num ber of points in each cell and the probability mass function of the poisson distribution with the estimated parameter are shown in the same grouped bar chart through a feed back the fact that the two sets of bars can be quite different surprises some students figure 9 a statement of exercise poisson distribution with a feedback when the student s answers are correct traditional problems can become a source of inspiration for creating learning objects for example the problem of studying lattice polygons that is plane polygons with ver tices with integer coordinates has been widely explorered and can give rise to nice results as pick s theorem e g see 9 p 208 209 the module oef polygons on graph paper 5 offers a series of exercises asking for the tracing of triangles and quadrilaterals with integer coordinates vertices the rationale behind the module is that explor ing the variety of existing examples of polygons opens the mind to a more advanced geometric vision so the aim of the exercises is to stimulate for the construction of non stereotyped examples by asking questions as trace a quadrilateral with all equal sides and with no sides laid on the grid trace a quadrilateral with perpendicular and equal diagonals and with sides all of different lengths trace a quadrilateral with exactly two right angles and with no sides laid on the grid it might be interesting to point out that users replies for such constructions are evaluated via basic 2 d vector geometry notions using pari gp the coding of the ex ercise itself becomes a playground to see applied mathe matics at work a computer based learning system can be used to intro duce standard algorithms in wims you can find for instance the module parmsys 32 that leads the user through the steps of gauss elimination method for reduc ing a linear system with parameters in order to determine whether it is solvable or not figure 10 activities of this kind in which the task of actually making all the com putations is left to the computer allow for the students to focus on the problem itself which are the most conve nient steps to get to the triangular form for the system once the algorithm has been assimilated it is possible figure 10 gauss algorithm in linear algebra step 1 to propose modeling exercises for different applications the module oef linear systems 31 contains the exer cise alloy of 3 metals in which students are explicitly invited to use the tool linear solver 28 so that they do not need to spend too much time on computations but they can concentrate on the main difficulty of this type of exercises which is indeed to define the linear system they have to solve to answer the questions finally and this time we exit the domain of mathemat ics and provide an example in biology even more interac tive activities can be build in the module identification of animal tissue 20 a picture of a biological tissue to be identified is shown see figure 11 a the user is guided through a standard analysis protocol with ad hoc ques tions users answers are checked by the system one by one see figure 11 b and in case of errors intermediate 6 questions can be added so to allow for the student to rec tify any mistake or to follow an alternave approach only after any single reply has been given a feedback the final question what is the tissue category is asked this example also allows us to see the idea of data modules at work the set of images of tissues to be identified is available to be shared with any other learning module on similar subjects a animal tissue i b animal tissue ii figure 11 example in biology 4 3 teachers point of view through any wims server teachers have access to a large variety of learning objects on many different subjects beyond mathematics available open classes provides models for ready to use courses on various topics so that teachers with just one click can create their own copy of the class and have access to all of the lms functions avail able selecting exercises monitoring students progresses grading teachers have thus the option to use al ready existing materials as is but they also have the op tion to adapt anything to their own teaching style more over they can create their own exercises wims provides a somehow simplified programming language called oef online exercise format that allows for the use of all the advanced features of wims and it is fully documented on line wims also provides tools to create standard ex ercises like multiple choice questions or true or false or fill in the blanks and so on each wims module in the distribution is open source so the teacher is encouraged to look inside any exercise and have an understanding on how it really works not merely accepting mysterious turnkey packages teachers have the possibility to select among many dif ferent configurations for each single instance of any oef exercise if the author of the exercise provides a hint or a solution it is up to the teacher to decide whether such hints or solution are actually shown to the students teachers can write themselves alternative hints or solution to be shown to the students using wims documents in this case with no need to edit the exercise code teach ers can also setup the exercise so that in case of errors the student have to go through the very same exercise again as wims exercises are highly randomized usually you can expect a different version of the exercise any time you open it with this option students have the chance to revise by themselves their resolution and empower their own self directed learning skills finally the fact that wims covers many subjects apart from mathematics allows teachers to have everything in one place and favors interdisciplinary links for example it allows for the connection of the idea of the barycenter of a triangle seen in figure 2 a to the problem of finding the center of gravity of a system of weighed objects as in the module gravity shoot 29 shown in figure 12 figure 12 gravity 5 conclusion we have tried to highlight the most significant aspects of the wims system and to bring our experience on the po tential of using new technologies in teaching we hope to have encouraged the reader to visit the site not letting themselves be restrained by a sometimes a bit intricate graphical aspect but willing to really explore the numer ous learning objects available we also hope to have en couraged participation in our community there is a lot of work to be done in order to keep the wims system active 7 and make the already available materials better usable a special effort in this direction concerns the translation into other languages of the huge resource of learning mod ules existing in french we also feel the need of building a better database of available resources and of improving ex amples of turnkey open classes and again to translate modules and classes into many more languages work has to be done to guarantee the operativity of modules in spite softwares obsolescence and in order to take advantage of technologies development xiao s modules dating back as to 1998 are still fully functional and we constantly need to plan the future development of the system once more we recall the questions raised in 7 that still remain open which are the most effective interactive activities and can the strengths of wims help teachers offer such activities to their students can wims be used to evaluate students achieve ments can wims be used to build personalized learning paths how to develop the technological knowledge of teach ers in order to enable them to exploit the full poten tial of wims can the capabilities of wims be embedded into other lms such as e g moodle any contributions from researchers in the subjects cov ered from computer scientists and from researchers in education can support the development of wims in a di rection that improves its effectiveness in communication of sciences and in teaching
