is the function f x 0 if x 0 1 if x 1 1 continuous at 0 if we open any elementary calculus textbook in use the answer will almost invariably be no to both questions moreover with some textbooks these are the only discontinuities various functions seem to have the daily calculus teaching practice follows the same party line we will give correct answers to these questions in the subsequent pages first let us briefly look into the development of the ideas and the con cepts what is a continuous function it is worth noting that the concept of a function as we know it today was arrived at only through numerous historical meanderings historically this concept has been closely intertwined with that of continuity ferraro 2000 for instance gives a detailed account of the development of this concept with euler a function for euler was by definition continuous and differentiable and expandable into a taylor series the functions were intrinsically continuous for the variables varied in a continuous way in the eighteenth century a function was restricted to a quantity definable by a single formula and euler followed the same practice the following was not considered to be a function f x x 2 if x 0 5 x if x 0 2 by this definition 1 x is a function and a continuous one since it is defined by a unique formula the fact that its graph consisted of two pieces was of no consequence to euler by the same token the integer part function would likely be considered to be a continuous function by euler cauchy 1844 quickly points out some difficulties with euler s view by noting that the function x 2 would be considered a continuous function by euler but this work has originated around year 2000 the author gave the first public lecture on the topic no later than february 7 2003 at texas a m university current paper is a minor revision of the version written on december 8 2003 the paper has been in circulation since that date c r dimitric 2003 1 http arxiv org abs 1210 2930 v 1 2 the same function written in two pieces x if x 0 and x if x 0 would not be considered to be a function only in 1837 did dirichlet get rid of this notion of function interpreted as a unique formula the notion of function has nowadays crystallized into a well founded concept a function is no longer only a formula or a compact formula at that but is a triple f a b where a is the domain for its variables f is a relation with unique second component value for every independent variable and b is the codomain containing the range see here bourbaki 1939 for example thus the functions should be taught properly do main codomain and the assignment rule s with certain properties make up a function precisely speaking a function f from a to b is the ordered triple f a b also denoted by f a b where f a b is a relation i e a subset with the property that for every a a there is a unique b b such that a b f thus two functions are equal if all three of their corresponding parts the formula domain and codomain are equal one might say that using relations to define functions may be a bit overreaching in a basic calculus course and perhaps it is on the other hand i see textbooks on precalculus discuss the subject of rela tions i encounter students puzzlement or even confusion when they hear the new word codomain some also use the word target for the same thing they ve heard of the range but what is this codomain is as important as the domain and is perfectly dual to it and that is a very important point given a formula we at first simply do not know what the range will be in any but trivial cases but can often give a rough target consider the following example for a square black and white photo graph for every point on it and one tends to modernize terminology not quite accurately and say to every pixel assign a value to it in the in terval 0 1 that denotes the amount of black at that point thus 1 would be assigned to a perfectly black point and 0 to a perfectly white the interval 0 1 is a natural codomain although we could go up to r if we are only talking real functions anything in between can also be taken to be a codomain as we change the codomains we get different function each time although the assignment rule the formula would stay the same on the other hand 1 0 would not be a valid codomain we don t know the range and it would be rather difficult to find very dark photos would have the range in the upper half of the interval 0 1 the light ones in the bottom half we know however that the range is the smallest of all the codomains dually given a formula we speak of the domain to fit the formula whereas we really mean the largest domain for which the formula works any subset of the maximal domain can also be a domain as we change these without changing the formula we do get different functions thus for the same formula f x x 2 we have various possibilities a f r r b f r r c f r r d f r r 3 3 which give us different functions with different properties the first is neither one to one nor onto i e range is not equal to its codomain the second one is one to one but not onto while the function in c has an inverse it is one to one and onto unlike the rest of them the function in d is onto but not one to one in this way not only is 1 x not a function at 0 but we can point out to our students some crucial facts such as that the property of being one to one depends on the domain such as in functions 3 above this then helps better understand the notion of inverse function the relationship between the range and the codomain etc 1 now a definition of continuity given a function f a r on a real domain a r it is continuous at a a if 2 lim x a f x f lim x a x f a 4 implicitly this definition is in the form of an implication if a a then the function f and the limit as x a can be commuted this is fairly close to how bolzano defines continuity in his privately published manuscript on what we today call the intermediate value theorem bolzano 1817 a function f x varies according to the law of continuity for all values of x which lie inside or outside certain limits is nothing other than this if x is any such value the difference f x f x can be made smaller than any given quantity if one makes as small as one wishes for euler 1748 this is a consequence of what he considers to be a function years later weierstrass 1874 gave a similar somewhat more formal definition here we call a quantity y a continuous function of x if upon taking a quantity the existence of can be proved such that for any value between x 0 x 0 the corresponding value of y lies between y 0 y 0 the difference f x f x 0 can be made arbitrarily small if the difference x x 0 is made sufficiently small in our modern quantifier notation f is continuous at x 0 domf if 0 0 x a x x 0 f x f x 0 5 it is not clear whether bolzano s paper had been well known in his own time and in particular whether cauchy was familiar with the content of this paper see grattan guinness 1969 on this whatever the answer cauchy 1821 p 43 gives his own definition of continuity f x will be called a continuous function if the numerical values of the difference f x f x decrease indefinitely with those of 1 to be fair better or more advanced books on analysis often have a correct treat ment of the notion of function and in particular that of an onto function and a codomain see here for instance rudin 1976 or mardes ic 1974 2 here we do not require that the limit is taken over a non isolated point x s may equal a 4 infinitesimally small changes in x should lead to infinitesimally small changes in f on a slightly more fancy level if f a b is a function between two metric spaces then it is continuous at a a if for every open ball v in b centered at f a there is an open ball centered at a completely mapped into v thus the mid eighteenth century notion of continuity referred to uni formity wholeness of the formula used to define the function piecewise defined functions such as 2 were not deemed to be functions or to be continuous under this notion d alembert was one of the proponents of defining continuous functions in this restricted sense this was chal lenged by daniel bernoulli after d alembert s work in 1747 on the motion of a vibrating string d alembert 1747 see here for instance struik 1969 pp 351 368 and truesdell s introduction to euler 1960 titled the ra tional mechanics of flexible or elastic bodies 1638 1788 d alembert s solution to the partial differential equation describing motion of an elastic vibrating string was of the form z x t f t x f t x which was unusual in that the solution was a combination of two arbitrary functions thus could not be considered to be a continuous function euler 1765 resolved this problem by change of terminology and interpretations of the constants that come out in integrating the given pde s feraro 2000 the alternative notion of continuity that was coming into greater prominence referred to functions that can be produced by a free motion of the hand this notion of being able to draw the graph of a function without lifting a pencil is that of contiguity as formulated in 1791 by louis arbogast the law of continuity is again broken when the different parts of a curve do not join to one another we will call curves of this kind discontiguous curves because all their parts are not contiguous and similarly for discontiguous functions see jourdain 1913 pp 675 676 the interest in dis continuities was further heightened by fourier in his celebrated work on heat fourier 1822 a definite disturbance regarding the concept of continuity and a need to fix the concept was induced by peter lejeune dirichlet who gave in 1829 his example of the function equal to a constant over the set of rational numbers and equal to another constant on the set of the irrationals this function was not continuous even at a single point 3 bolzano added more excitement in 1834 by giving the first example of a nowhere differentiable continuous function as much as works on continuity by bolzano and cauchy were ignored the world seem to have started paying attention to the definition of continuity given in darboux 1875 where its local nature is finally underlined 3 another nice example was given by riemann f 0 1 0 1 is defined to be zero on irrational numbers and 1 q for rational numbers in the reduced form p q this function is discontinuous at every rational point and continuous at every irrational number 5 answers let s look closer into the questions we posed at the beginning a socratic dialog do you love your cat arthuro asked oh yes definitely and then no not at all most definitely gwen dolin replied how can that be aren t you contradicting yourself oh no no i simply do not have a cat exclaimed gwendolin and added philosophically and pensively i cannot decide on whether it may be easier not to love a cat you do not have than to love a cat you do not have hmmm arthuro sighed unhappily for the lack of a definite answer but i will give you a cat just please give me definitely an answer whether you love your cat or not o k arthuro this would then be a different situation from the pre vious one also do not forget that my having a cat may not guarantee that i will be able to decide whether i love it or not arthuro is puzzled but something seems to be happening for his eyes are wide open and he seems to be thinking with intensity when i ask my students whether they love their cats those who do not have a cat would never answer the question with a yes or no but would rather say that they do not have a cat this phenomenon of a question with a false presumption seems to be well recognized in the folk wisdom the question of the same kind is a question of the type why do you beat your wife while both the beating and the wife may not exist recently i heard a folk child riddle a rooster is standing on top of a roof and it lays an egg which way will the egg go the child is supposed to recognize that the answer is not applicable since roosters do not lay eggs the question of continuity of 1 x at a 0 is the same as that of conti nuity of this function at a red tomato or for that matter the question of gwendolin loving her cat that she does not have the premise part of the definition of continuity is not satisfied since it is vacuous there is no function at 0 for this reason saying that 1 x is continuous at 0 is equally in valid as saying that it is continuous at 0 the answer to the title question is thus n a namely the question of continuity at 0 is not applicable for the function 1 x 4 in the same manner we define various kinds of discontinuities of a function within its domain such as done for instance in rudin 1976 p 94 4 see also mardes ic 1974 p 194 a more general result holds let x be a banach algebra with the unity e and let i denote the set of all invertible regular elements in x then i is an open set and the function f i x f x x 1 is continuous 6 as for question number two we need to find lim x 0 f x but what are the x with x 0 in fact the only such x s are x 0 thus we indeed have 4 and 5 satisfied sufficiently small balls centered at 0 coincide with its center it will always be like this if a is not a limit point if for instance it is an isolated point as in our case 5 the function 1 is continuous at all points of its domain and so is 1 x one is tempted to dismiss the pathological cases of isolated points or non compact domains in teach ing non mathematicians un fortunately discussing continuity only on compact domains would be tantamount to simply replacing continuity by a stronger notion of uniform continuity the field of applied mathemat ics aka the sciences however largely consists of singularities isolated points non compact domains and limits that do not exist or are infinity all the staple brushed away in usual calculus courses why does this myth of 1 x not being continuous at zero linger on so persistently with teachers of calculus and authors of calculus textbooks if we take aside a small population of people who maintain that incor rect mathematics is o k for whatever higher pedagogical goals the constraints to open thinking about continuity have historical as well as objective roots the question of contiguity clearly depends on the space into which the domain is embedded for contiguity purposes we look at the domain as a part of r if we somehow imagine the domain 0 0 of 1 x not to be embedded in r but standing on its own we can perhaps imagine that the graph is contiguous that we can draw it in one go without lifting up the pencil after fusing the parts together the same thinking applies to the domain 0 1 of the function 1 in question number two an interesting point of view is brought about in burgess 1990 where it is argued that continuity and contiguity are synonymous in some cases thus if f a r is a function such that its domain a r a closed interval or is a closed ray in r and such that its graph is closed in r 2 then f is continuous iff the graph of f is connected in r 2 another objective reason not seeing continuity for what it is is the desire and sometimes necessity to extend functions their domains so that the new functions become continuous extensions of the starting func tions this is the moment when arthuro wants to give gwendolin a cat we cannot extend 1 x so as to make it continuous at 0 but we can ex tend x sin 1 x by defining its value at 0 to be the limit there namely 0 notice that if f 1 0 0 1 r f x 1 x even those who say that this f is discontinuous at 0 would not say that it is discontinuous at 5 for instance i do however want to pause for a moment from being a devil s advocate many discussions on the nature of the notions of function and continuity did spill into the early 20 th century and beyond for instance in the papers 5 see also rudin 1976 p 86 7 of borel lebesgue brower baer etc some of these discussions had added dimension of set theoretical considerations that led to deep discoveries in mathematical logic and developments of new kinds of mathematics such as intuitionism etc it must be said also that there is often a considerable delay in adoption and application of fundamental notions in mathematics conclusions the notion of continuity is subtle but it had undergone its evolution through the historical birthing process the subtleties eluded cauchy into making a nice error when he proved that a multi variable function is continuous if it is continuous in each of its variables the notion of continuity has been demystified however and there is no much reason for dragging the old fog surrounding it into modern day textbooks and classrooms it is crucial to see functions as ordered triples f a b for not only the formula but both domain and codomain determine what exact properties the function has this also helps the students understand that extending a function continuously refers to extension of its domain etc one aesthetic consequence is the quotient rule if f and g are continuous then f g is continuous the quotient is not a function when the denomi nator is zero thus we do not need to discuss continuity at those points while contiguity has its own merits because it is directly related to path connectedness it simply is not identical to the notion of continuity as a stronger requirement it implies continuity we cannot however use the two synonymously there are for instance certain assumptions about a function that would imply continuity of the function but certainly not contiguity etc once we let go of interpretation of continuity as contigu ity we can concentrate on what continuity actually is the commutation of the function with limits as in 4 why can we plug numbers into expression whose limits we are finding students would invariably plug in x 1 when finding the limit lim x 1 3 x 2 1 and an opportunity is missed to point out to them that this natural move is possible because of continuity of the function in fact plugging in numbers when finding limits is possible because most of the functions given by formulas in elementary calculus e g all elementary functions such as algebraic or trigonometric functions are continuous interestingly intuitionists like brower have it that every function f r r is continuous by their own definitions of functions and continuity additional discussion on historical development of the concepts of func tion and continuity can be found in monna 1972 edwards 1979 and
