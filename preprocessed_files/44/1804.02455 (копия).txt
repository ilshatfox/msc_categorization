the prior part in the present paper is to point out that laplace transforms leads to the analytic and exact forms of eigenfunctions for the potential proposed by us 2 2 r b r a rrvq which is a special quasi harmonic type potential containing a centrifugal type term choosing the coefficients 0 ba qv potential implies a short range potential behavior in the nuclear potential case we mention there are a finite number of bound states beyond which the state is unbounded from this reason for a nuclear potential it s important to obtain the critical value of angular momentum c so the second aim of our paper is to obtain an approximation for upper bound range c to c for qv potential the present paper solves qv potential problem by laplace transform method in the section 2 in the section 3 we communicate two categories of results the energy and the eigenfunctions in the subsection 3 1 and also the computing of c in the subsection 3 2 conclusions close our paper in the section 4 2 bound states spectrum via laplace transformation method in the natural units 1 c assuming spherical symmetry of the potential the d dimensional time independent schrodinger equation in spherical coordinates r for a particle of mass with arbitrary angular quantum number is given by 17 10 2 1 2 rerrv mnmn 1 where e and v r denote the energy eigenvalues and potential the rmn denotes n th state eigenfunctions the 2 in spherical coordinates is quasi harmonic potential in the schr dinger equation via laplace transform 3 2 2 222 2 2 2 sin 1 sin sin 11 rrr r rr 2 we choose the bound state eigenfunctions rmn such that wave functions are vanishing for 0 r r we look for separable solution of se mnmn yrr 3 where rn is the radial function and my is the angular function the equation 2 provides two separated equations the one is known as the hyperspherical harmonics equation and the other one the hyperradial or in short the radial equation which is 0 2 2 2 2 rrve r d r r r 4 where 3

asymptotic form 0 4 22 rrdr 0 2 d 6 where the type term 24 d is this chosen from mathematical conveniences we propose to find the solution by type 2 rferr drk 0 k 7 hence the function rf and k value

the following condition b then the eq 10 implies two values for k 3 k k 11 the acceptable physical value remains k thus the equation 8 becomes 0 222 22 2342 32 rfarrdrrd rfdrdrrrrf 12 we continue in the parametric restriction 1 d and obtain for unknown function rf the following differential equation 0 2 22 22 rfarrdrfdrrrrf 13 quasi harmonic potential in the schr dinger equation via laplace

transform space therefore we apply the laplace transform 3 srfls where 0 re s and the eq 13 becomes 0 2 2 2 sssssssd 14 where 22 22 a d 4 15 we observe that 20 s is the singular point this suggests the following form of the laplace transform 1 2 n n s c s 16 and the inverse laplace transform 1 rslrf leads to the following expression 2 r nn er n c rf 17 3 results 3 1 energy eigenvalues and wave

obtain the energy eigenvalues d n nd n d en 8 4 3 2 1 4 3 19 we remark that in the case of harmonic oscillator 22 2 1 rv the energy expression 19 leads to the eigenvalue 2 3 00 e which is the well known ground state energy a complete solution of se implies the computation of normalization constant nc from the condition 1 0 22 drrr 20 considering the approximation r d r 2 we can evaluate the

potential is the strength potential we consider the effective potential 21 2 1 r rvrv qeff 28 a possible bound state of positive energy corresponds to the proposed qv potential including quasi bound states where is relevant in the binding of these states an infinitely small but negative part of effv would admit a bound state that means the critical strength c is needed to bind a state regarding of the above we make some computations such as the radius r 0 such that 0 0 rv eff leads to 0 2 1 3 3 0 0 0 a rv rv r q q 29 the critical straight c which is the minimal value necessary to get a bound

work quasi harmonic potential in the schr dinger equation via laplace transform 9 4 conclusions in the two body problem associated to qv quasi harmonic potential with 10 after some parametric restrictions we solved 3 dimensional schr dinger equation via laplace transformation method we obtained a complete analytic solution namely the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the computation of k positive value we need to consider the condition b and this leaded to k otherwise the k value involved in parametric restriction 0 nq may be a subject of interest in quantum computing using the wave function we computed the root mean square rms charge radius which is measured for most stable nuclei by electron scattering form factors and or from the x ray transition energies of muonic atoms the formula of rrms obtained by us is interesting to be compared with the experimental results considering qv potential as a nuclear potential 0 ba we also obtained the analytic solution of the schr dinger equation this solution is only valid for well bound states but not for angular momentum close to or above the critical c we estimated also the c representing the necessary strength of the qv potential required such that effv to have a negative part therefore we calculated an upper bound c which is a good approximation of c and we find c it is proportional to strength of potential
