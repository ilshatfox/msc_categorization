and backward sweeps is often observed in ambient conditions the mechanism of this hysteresis can be different depending on the charge transfer between graphene and its environment two types of hysteresis directions are observed experimentally 1 a direct one and an inverse one the last is also defined as an antihysteresis for the systems on ferroelectric substrate this hysteresis in the graphene on ferroelectric systems had already enabled the construction of the robust elements of non volatile memory of new generation 2 3 these elements work for more than 105 switches and preserve information for more than 1000 s such systems can be characterized theoretically by the ultrafast rate of switching 10 100 fs for details see rev 4 the direct and opposite hysteresis can be attributed to two rival mechanisms capacitive coupling and charge carriers trapping from graphene respectively a quantitative model for these competing hysteretic mechanisms in graphene channel resistivity on a substrate of different nature a direct one caused by adsorbates with dipole moment on surface e g water as it is presented in fig 1 a and an inverse one caused by capture of free carriers onto localized states on graphene substrate interface was proposed in 5 6 this model leads in the first case to non zero concentration of holes in graphene at zero vg equal to epn p 00 1 where p 0 is the absorbed molecules layer polarization i e the electro neutrality point on vg scale is shifted to positive voltages therefore the linear dependence n vg is shifted initially to smaller values of electron concentrations and greater values of holes concentrations further increase of vg ruins finally the polarization as it is presented in fig 1 b and for the backward sweep of vg the dependence n vg is governed by the fleet capacitor correlation with electro neutrality point at zero vg therefore the hysteresis in the dependence of conductivity vg occurs fig 1 c however it vg sweeps rate is slow enough the spontaneous polarization on graphene s surface restores with time as exp 1 0 tptp 2 if the time when vg reaches electro neutrality is of constant order or greater the two electro neutrality points in fig 1 c trends to one and the hysteresis vanishes voltage vg c on du ct iv ity a graphene substrate gate b vg 0 vg 0 c d voltage vg c on du ct iv ity fig 1 a graphene with

states with et energy and nt concentration electrons from graphene are captured onto them when fermi energy reaches et on vg onward sweep and n vg shifts in nt value lower the characteristic lifetime of electrons on interface states c is rather long 5 therefore this shift remains in n vg dependence on vg backward sweep as well and this causes the inverse hysteretic loop presented in fig 1 d mention that due to hierarchy of times c the realistic sweep rate variation vanishes the direct hysteresis primarily this was observed experimentally in 1 and 3 4 s can be obtained from it s data 6 this time is many orders of value longer than the relaxation time of free dipoles due to strong chemical bonds of adsorbates to graphene s surface another experimental result of 1 that can be explained within our model is that hysteresis could be swept with the decrease of vg sweep rate from direct to inverse one for low temperatures but for room temperatures it was inverse one only although chemical nature of adsorbate water was the same for ice is many orders greater than for liquid therefore no direct hysteresis could be observed for room temperature due to rapid polarization renewal thus possible discrimination of these two channels by variation of the gate voltage sweep rate was proposed the slow sweep suppresses the direct channel and does not influence greatly for the realistic sweep rate the opposite one the theory s predictions are in a qualitative agreement with experimental data and can be useful for understanding of the graphene s structures operation in
