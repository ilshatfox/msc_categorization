in search of a new economic model determined by logistic growth roman g smirnov and kunpeng wang department of mathematics and statistics dalhousie university halifax nova scotia canada b 3 h 3 j 5 october 24 2018 abstract in this paper 1 we extend the work by ryuzo sato devoted to the develop ment of economic growth models within the framework of the lie group theory we propose a new growth model based on the assumption of logistic growth in factors it is employed to derive new production functions and introduce a new notion of wage share in the process it is shown that the new functions compare reasonably well against relevant economic data the corresponding problem of maximization of profit under conditions of perfect competition is solved with the aid of one of these functions in addition it is explained in reasonably rigorous mathematical terms why bowley s law no longer holds true in post 1960 data 1 introduction as is well known a production function is an essential feature of an economics growth model such a function can either be fixed so that it is used to estimate the dynamics of other quantities or it is the essential output of the model obtained by studying the dynamics of the input factors e mail roman smirnov dal ca e mail kunpengwang dal ca 1 preliminary report published in arxiv https arxiv org abs 1711 02625 1 ar x iv 1 71 1 02 62 5 v 5 m at h g r 2 2 o ct 2 01 8 an example of the former application of a production function is the celebrated solow swan economic growth model 70 73 33 introduced in the 1950 s to ex plain long run economic growth at which point it also generalized and extended the harrod domar model 22 38 tasked with this undertaking prior the model in turn was later used as a starting point for the development of other economic growth models that emerged as its generalizations see for example ferrara and guerrini 31 and the relevant references therein at the core of the solow swan model and its generalizations is a production function y t f k t l t normally of the cobb douglas type 19 where the factors k t and l t represent capital and labor respectively the function y t is required to satisfy the so called inada conditions 41 from a mathematical stand point the solow swan economic growth model and its generalizations for example the ramsey cass koopmans model 16 49 59 are governed by a single nonlinear differential equation or a system of such equations that describe the evolution of per capita capital stock consumption etc the theory of technical change and economic invariance developed by ruzyo sato 65 is an example of the latter approach in which a production function is an output obtained within the framework of a model in particular the author and his collaborators have derived the cobb douglas production function as a consequence of the exponential growth in factors capital and labor in this article we continue the development of sato s theory by changing the assumptions about the lie group theoretical properties of the technical progress representing the growth in factors recall that in 1928 charles cobb and paul douglas published a paper 19 devoted to the study of the growth of the american economy during the period 1899 1922 to model the production output they used the following function introduced earlier by knut wicksell y ak l 1 1 where k t and l t are as before i e in economic terms they are the factors of production while y denotes the total production a is total factor productivity and 0 are the output elasticities of capital and labor respectively sometimes the cobb douglas function displays constant return to scale which holds if 1 0 1 2 the cobb douglas function 1 1 can be easily derived under the assumptions that there is no production if either capital or labor vanishes the marginal productiv ity of capital is proportional to the amount of production per unit of capital i e 2 y k y k and the marginal productivity of labor is proportional to the amount of production per unit of labor i e y l y l more recently ryuzo sato 64 65 see also sato and ramachardan 61 while resolving the so called solow stigler controversy 71 72 developed a lie group the oretical framework to study technical progress and production functions it can be viewed as an analogue of the felix klein approach to geometry formulated in his cele brated erlangen program 47 in which lie transformation groups play a central role for instance within this framework the cobb douglas production function 1 1 can be recovered as an invariant of the one parameter lie group action 21 that afford exponential growth in both k and l in the first quadrant of the two dimensional euclidean space r 2 k l k l r the key idea employed by sato 64 65 as well as sato and ramachadran 61 was to identify the corresponding exogeneous technical progress with the action of a one parameter lie group that acts in c 2 r 2 more specifically a klein geometry can be described as a pair g h where g is a lie group and h is a closed lie subgroup of g such that the left coset space g h is connected the group g is called the principal group of the geometry and g h is called the space of the geometry which is a homogeneous space for g for instance in this view the pair se 3 so 3 describes the euclidean geometry of r 3 and its objects say surfaces can be classified modulo the action of the continuous isometry group se 3 see for example horwood et al 40 as well as cochran et al 20 for more details by analogy a neoclassical growth model in the sense of sato can be viewed as a pair g r 2 where the one parameter lie group of transformations g acting in c 2 r 2 represents the technical progress in question so far in the literature g has been considered to be either of a uniform neutral factor augmenting type that is g k e tk l e tl for some 0 or representing a non uniform biased type that is g k e tk l e tl for some 0 6 therefore it is assumed in both cases that the economy grows exponentially as per the corre sponding growths in capital and labor which was a reasonable assumption in the past based on the existing data at the time it might no longer be the case however which may be attested to the fact for example that the cobb douglas function can no longer be used to describe adequatly the growth of the american economy over a long run including the recent decades in the same way as it was done by cobb and douglas for the period 1899 1922 19 see section 7 for more details the main goal of this paper is to use the existing model to develop a new math ematical paradigm that can be used to study the current state of economy accord ingly in what follows we will modify the economic growth models described by sato within the framework of the lie group theory according to the present economic realities 7 more specifically we will replace in a neoclassical growth model in the 3 sense of sato g r 2 a group g representing an exponential growth with another one parameter lie group that describes a logistic growth g exponential growth logistic growth this idea is currently being exploited and developed from different angles and in different directions quite extensively in the literature by economists and mathemati cians alike see for example 1 2 12 13 14 34 35 36 26 27 28 29 30 which is quite natural given that the resources on our planet are limited therefore our first task is to modify a basic growth model g r 2 as described above and then following sato s approach derive a new production function that may replace the cobb douglas function 1 1 in any models considered within the new paradigm of logistic growth which is a reasonable further development given that for example the us economy is not well described by a cobb douglas aggregate production function see antra s 7 for more details next we will test the new production function derived purely by mathematical methods against a more up to date data to verify its suitability for being part of any new mathematical models finally we will reconsider several classical examples utilizing the properties of the cobb douglas production funciton by replacing it with our new production function derived via the lie group theoretical approach developed by sato and discuss the new results obtained under the assumption of logistic growth this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we lay the groundwork for the introduction of a new growth model and derivation of new production functions specifically we review the lie group approach introduced in 65 and employ it to rederive the cobb douglas function 1 1 in section 3 we depart from the growth model described by sato based on exponential growth and introduce instead a new one based on the assumption that factors grow logistically in section 4 we derive a new production function 4 5 within the framework of the growth model 3 1 introduced in section 3 section 5 is devoted to solving the problem of maximization of profit under condition of perfect competition using the new production func tion 4 5 in section 6 we explain using mathematical reasonings and the results obtained in preceeding sections why bowley s law 9 10 no longer holds true in post 1960 data in the process we also derive another production function 6 22 and a new modified wage sare 6 21 in section 7 we use statistical analysis to in vestigate how estimations of the new production function 4 5 compare to economic data in section 8 we make concluding remarks and summarize our findings 4 2 a lie group approach to the study of holothetic production functions in this section we will briefly review the lie group theoretical approach developed by sato to study holothetic production functions and employ it to derive the cobb douglas production function 1 1 consider a growth model g r 2 where g is a continuous one parameter group of transformations see 61 64 65 for more details in order to show that the increases in efficiency of inputs due to technical progress can be explained by economies of scale sato interpreted technical progress as the action of a one parameter lie group of transformations for which the production function y f k l was an invariant under this arrangement the resulting transformation representing technical progress and generated by g indeed preserves the isoquant map i e maps one isoquant or in mathematical terms a level curve of y to another that is technical progress has the same effect as economies of scale more specifically let capital and labour affected by technical progress and mea sured in the efficiency units k and l be given by k 1 k l 2 l 2 1 where 1 and 2 represent the effect of the exogenous technical progress following sato and ramachardan 61 let us remark that if 1 2 the change generated by technical progress is hicks neutral if technical progress is factor augmenting and biased then 1 6 2 the functions i i 1 2 may depend on t only or they may be functions of k l which would imply that the rate of technical progress on different rays are different but the rate is constant on each of them they functions i i 1 2 can also be functions of k l and t which would entail that the rate of technical progress will also vary along a ray in what follows we will also require that the technical progress functions i i 1 2 represent the action of a one parameter lie group consider now the case when both i i t i 1 2 moreover 1 t e t 2 t e t 0 note if the change generated by such technical progress is hick neutral clearly the corresponding transformations k e tk l e tl 2 2 form a continuous one parameter lie group which follows from the fact for example that transformation 2 2 determines the flow t k l e t 0 0 e t k l 2 3 5 generated by the following vector field u k k l l 2 4 which generates the lie algebra of the one parameter lie group g g g t t r where t r 2 r 2 is determined by 2 3 for each fixed t r 2 more generally suppose a technical progress t is defined by the functions and such that tt k k l t l k l t 2 5 where t is the technical progress parameter and the functions are analytic and functionally independent moreover let us also suppose the family of transformations tt 2 5 forms a one parameter lie group g recall that sato observed in 65 that in this case a production function f is holothetic under a continuous one parameter lie group transformatoin 2 5 iff uf k l f k k l f l h f 2 6 where k l k t 0 0 k l l t 0 0 the condition of holotheticity is crucial from the economic standpoint because it assures that the isoquant map i e the family of level curves of f is invariant under the transformation 2 5 representing the technical change which means that under t isoquants are mapped onto isoquants and the techinical change in this case is transformed into a scale effect for example if k and l in 2 6 6 0 which means 1 e t 2 e t in 2 1 h f 6 0 it is a straigforward calculation using the method of characteristic that the general solution to the partial differential equation 2 6 is given by 65 see also 63 y f k 1 q l k 2 7 where q is an arbitrary function the converse problem was also considered by sato specifically he established necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a technical progress that affords holotheticity of a given production function see lemma 4 in 65 on p 34 now let us derive the cobb douglas function 1 1 within the framework of the model g r 2 where the one parameter lie group of transformations g determines the exponential growth 2 2 consider the partial differential equation 2 6 with the coefficients and determined by 2 2 for k eatk l ebtl a b 0 6 clearly we can determine a particular production function 2 7 by specifynig the function h f 6 0 in 2 2 since g in this case defines an exponential growth it is natural to impose the corresponing condition on h f so that it is also subject to an exponential growth indeed let h f cf c 0 therefore we have uf ak f k bl f l cf 2 8 or alternatively we can solve instead the following partial differential equation x ak k bl l cf f 0 2 9 where k l f 0 f 6 0 is a solution to 2 9 while f is a solution to 2 8 and an invariant solving the corresponding sysetm of ordinary differential equations dk ak dl bl df cf 2 10 using the method of characteristics yields the function 1 1 where a b c a b c unfortunately the elasticity elements in this case do not attain econom ically meaningful values like 1 2 to overcome this problem sato in 65 adjusted the model accodingly specifically he introduces the notion of the simultaneous holothenticity which implies that a production function is holothetic under more than one type of technical change simultaneously mathematically it means that a production function is an invariant of an integrable distribution of vector fields 3 on r 2 each representing a technical change as per the formula 2 8 or 2 9 more specifically let us consider the following two vector fields for which a function k l f is an invariant x 1 k k l l f f 0 x 2 ak k bl l f f 0 2 11 clearly the vector fields x 1 x 2 form a two dimensional integrable distribution on r 2 x 1 x 2 1 x 1 2 x 2 where 1 2 0 the corresponding total differential equation is given by see chapter vii sato 65 for more details fl bfl dk afk fk dl bkl akl df 0 7 or 1 b dk k a 1 dl l b a df f 0 2 12 integrating 2 12 we arrive at a cobb douglas function of the form 1 1 where the elasticity coefficients 1 b a b a 1 a b satisfy the condition of constant return to scale 1 2 remark 2 1 note that in principle we could have used only one vector field generating a partial differential equation of the type 2 8 however the resulting cobb douglas function would have had the parameters satisfying the condition 0 see 1 1 the latter constraint on the parameters and in 1 1 is incompatible with the economic growth theory main postulates we suppose that exactly for this reason sato 65 introduced the concept of simultaneous holotheticity this arrangement in particular allows us to generate two input cobb douglas functions of the type 1 1 depending on a wide range of parameters and which we can for instance make to satify the condition 1 so that the function 1 1 displays constant returns to scale as in the example above these considerations lead to a very important conclusion namely the cobb douglas function derived within the framework of the growth model g r 2 where the lie group g is determined by the exponential growth 2 2 is precisely a mani festation of this exponential growth or more succinctly we have exponential growth the cobb douglas function which means that the cobb douglas function 1 1 is a consequence of exponential growth representing technical change 3 from exponential to logistic growth models in this section we depart from the assumption that the input factors i e capital and labor grow exponentially in order to extend sato s growth model g r 2 in what follows we assume that labor and capital grow logistically there is already a sub stantial literature starting with the pioneering paper by verhulst 76 in which the authors have already based their considerations on this rather natural assumption while studying various growth models with the aid of methods and techniques devel oped in economics mathematics and statistics see for example brass 11 ferrara 8 a world gold reserves from 1845 to 2013 in metric tonnes wikipedia 77 b world crude oil production 1930 to 2012 wikipedia 78 figure 1 logistic growth in basic factors of production gold and oil and guerrini 26 27 28 29 30 31 leach 52 oliver 54 tinter 75 the same assumption can be made about the growth in capital if for example we look at such natural resources as oil and gold as proxies for energy and money respectively it is quite evident that globally given the fact that all resources are limited both the accumulation of gold reserves and oil production are subject to logistic rather than exponential growth as can be illustrated by figure 1 we note that from the mathematical viewpoint it is also evident that there cannot be unbounded continuous exponential growth whether in terms of production capi tal or population on a planet with limited resources as per the following well known theorem 60 theorem 3 1 extreme value theorem if k is a compact set and f k r is a continuous function then f is bounded and there exist p q k such that f p supx k f x and f q infx k f x in view of the above we propose the following growth model based on the as sumption that both capital k and labor l are affected by logistic growth namely g 1 r 2 g 1 k nkk k nk k e t l nll l nl l e t 3 1 where 0 and nk nl are the respective carrying capacities clearly g 1 is a 9 one parameter lie group acting in r 2 whose flow is generated by the vector field u 1 k 1 k nk k l 1 l nl l 3 2 remark 3 2 it is also natural to consider the growth models g 2 r 2 and g 3 r 2 determined by the assumption that only one of the two variables grow logistically while the other is affected by exponential growth that is g 2 r 2 g 2 k nkk k nk k e t l e tl 3 3 or g 3 r 2 g 3 k e tk l nll l nl l e t 3 4 following the approach developed by sato in 65 we can now determine the cor responding family of production functions by solving the partial differential equation determined by the vector field u 1 3 2 u 1 f k 1 k nk f k l 1 l nl f l h f 3 5 where h f is an arbitrary function of f employing the method of characteristics we arrive at the following family of functions y f 1 k nk k 1 q l nl l nk k k 3 6 where q is an arbitrary function we note that for nk nl 1 and k l 1 the family of functions given by 3 6 f 1 f where f is given by 2 7 therefore we arrive at the following proposition 3 3 the most general family of production functions holothetic within the growth model 3 1 is given by 3 6 remark 3 4 the same argument applied to the partially logistic neoclassical growth models 3 3 and 3 4 yields the families of functions y f 2 k nk k 1 q l nk k k 3 7 10 and y f 3 k 1 q l nl l k 3 8 respectively our next goal is to derive a new production function under the assumption of logistic growth in both capital k and labor l since the cobb douglas function 1 1 has been shown above to be a member of the family of production functions 2 7 determined within the neoclassical growth model g r 2 where the lie group g is given by 2 2 it is natural to seek a new production function compatible with the logistic growth determined by the action of the lie group g 1 3 1 within the growth model g 1 r 2 this is the subject of the considerations that follow 4 from logistic growth to a new production func tion in section 2 we saw how the cobb douglas production function could be derived as an element of the family of production functions 2 7 within the framework of the growth model g r 2 where the lie group g was defined by 2 2 now let us consider the new growth model g 1 r where the lie group g 1 was given by 3 1 before we formally derive the corresponding production function as an element of the family of production functions 3 6 following the procedure outlined above let us first give a reasonable justification for the calculations that we shall present below recall that a necoclassical growth model of the solow type may be defined as follows see for example jones and scrimgeour 42 a model with decay in produced capital was studied in cheviakov and hartwick 17 y f k l t y c i i sy s 0 4 1 k i k k 0 0 l l 0 e t l 0 0 where c and i represent consumption and investment savings respectively while denotes depreciation of capital it is also assumed that the production function f satisfies the inada conditions 41 11 1 fk fl 0 this condition accounts for growth in both k and l 2 fkk fll 0 that implies diminishing marginal returns also in both k and l 3 f has constant returns to scale that is f k l f k l for all 0 4 f satisfies the following properties lim k 0 fk lim k fk 0 lim l 0 fl lim l fl 0 for example the cobb douglas function 1 1 satisfies the above assumptions pro vided the condition 1 2 holds such a model and its generalizations ensure steady long run growth ignoring short run fluctuations since the pioneering paper by solow 70 was published in 1956 the model 4 2 and its many generalizations have played the most prominent role in the development of the endogenous growth theory clearly the production function y is the cornerstone of the model and if it satisfies the inada conditions the growth is driven by decreasing marginal returns from the very beginning for all k l 0 many important examples of endogenous growth support this assumption see for example cobb and douglas 19 nevertheless there are situations when growth cannot be described by a strictly concave pro duction function for instance at a microeconomic level a company may develop a product based on an original idea such a product initially can be sold unrestricted in the absence of competition generating increasing marginal returns after a while a competition may become a factor e g other companies may introduce similar prod ucts affecting the sales of the original product whose market share may shrink in turn this situation in a long run will manifest itself in decreasing marginal returns mathematically the corresponding production function will no longer be strictly con cave capasso et al 15 gave a different motivation for the introduction of a globally nonconcave production function based on the idea of poverty traps the authors also pointed out two examples of models based on nonconcave production functions skiba 69 economics and clark 18 mathematical biology a macroeconomic example of such a scenario of growth can be found in tainter 74 see figure 16 p 109 to address the issue capasso et al 15 see also engbers et al 25 la torre et al 51 anita et al 4 5 6 employed a purely heuristic approch to introduce a new general family of production functions of the form y f 4 k l 1 k pl 1 p 1 2 kpl 1 p 4 2 12 reducible to the cobb douglas function 1 1 and enjoying an s shaped concave convex behavior for p 2 clearly the functions of the class 4 2 have a horizontal asymptote as k l when 2 6 0 and are compatible with logistic growth these functions were used by the authors as a cornerstone for building a new highly non trivial generalization of the solow model with spacial component in which they did not make assumptions about logistic growth for l it is worth mentioning at this point that ferrara and guerrini 26 27 28 29 30 31 while generalizing the ramsey and solow models of economic growth assumed logistic growth in l but kept the cobb douglas function 1 1 intact the introduction of the family of production functions 4 2 is certainly a big step in the right direction nevertheless these functions cannot account for all possible examples of growth and decay for example a production function can exhibit growth followed by a period of stabilization and then decay see for example another option is growth followed by a period of stabilization which is followed by growth again in this view our next goal is to derive a more general production function that can be used to describe a wider range of economic growth models including the situations outlined above we shall employ the lie group theoretical method developed by sato 65 and briefly described in section 2 indeed consider the growth model g 1 r 2 given by 3 1 next we are going to identify a member of the family 3 6 compatible with logistic growth given by 3 1 by imposing the corresponding constraints on the rhs of the equation 3 5 by analogy with the case of the cobb douglas function derived by sato 65 within the framework of the growth model g r 2 where the action of the lie group g is determined by 2 2 let us consider the following partial differential equation determined by the vector field u 1 given by 3 2 u 1 f ak 1 k nk f k bl 1 l nl f l cf 1 f nf 4 3 or in other words let us specify the function h f in 3 5 to be cf 1 f nf that implies logistic growth in the production function as well compare 4 3 with the equation 2 8 remark 4 1 we note that the choice for the rhs of 4 3 is not arbitrary it turns out that in order to obtain a meaningful solution one needs to assure that the properties of the function h f in 3 2 are compatible with the logistic growth determined by 3 1 for example if we set h f f in 3 2 which would imply that the growth in both k and l is logistic while f grows exponentially the resulting production function would have singularities see the equation 8 1 therefore the 13 above equation reflects the fact that the growth determined by 4 3 is consistent for all quantities involved that is for k l and f next we employ the same reasoning that sato in 65 based his derivation of the cobb douglas function 1 1 upon see also section 2 let us assume that the production functions in two sectors of an economy or two countries are identical so that the aggregate production function sought is of the same form however it does not necessarily mean that the technical changes in both sectors are also the same that is in what follows we shall give conditions under which the aggregate production function in question is holothetic under two types of technical changes simultaneously and solve again the corresponding simultaneous holotheticity prob lem in mathematical terms let us consider the following two vector fields acting on a function k l f x 3 k 1 k nk k l 1 l nl l f 1 f nf f 0 x 4 ak 1 k nk k bl 1 l nl l cf 1 f nf f 0 clearly the vector fields x 3 and x 4 form an integrable distribution on r 2 because x 3 x 4 3 x 3 4 x 4 where 3 4 0 then the corresponding total differential equation which has k l f const for a solution assumes the following form c b f 1 f nf l 1 l nl dk a c f 1 f nf k 1 k nk dl b a f 1 k nk l 1 l nl df 0 or c b dk k 1 k nk a c dl l 1 l nl b a df f 1 f nf 0 4 4 integrating the differential equation 4 4 compare it with 2 12 we arrive at a solution of the form k l f 0 defined in the open domain d 0 nk 0 nl 0 nf r 3 14 and satisfying the condition f 6 0 solving for f by the impilcit function theorem we arrive at the following hypersurface in r 3 y f 5 k l nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l k l r 2 4 5 where c r is the constant of integration c b a b a c a b note 1 note that in view of the symmetry of the differential equation 4 4 we could have solved the equation k l f 0 for k and l as well the function y f 5 k l given by 4 5 whose range is 0 nf coinsides with the function k l f 0 on d furthermore we note that in the subset d 0 nk 0 nl r 2 of the domain of the function y f 5 k l its growth is governed by the logistic growth in the factors k and l note that in this region the growth of the production function f 5 is s shaped which agrees with the assumptions that led to the introduction of the production function 4 2 however the production function 4 5 is also defined outside of the region d which impies in turn that its shape in the subset r 2 d nk nl is determined by the growth in k and l that goes beyond the respective carrying capacities nk and nl we will elaborate on this matter without loss of generality while dealing with the corresponding one input analog of the new two input production function 4 5 below we conclude therefore that by analogy with the algorithm based on the lie group theory methods devised by sato and applied in 65 to generate the cobb douglas function 1 1 we have used it after some modifications to generate a new production function 4 5 more succinctly we have logistic growth the new production function 4 5 remark 4 2 taking the limit as k l even though k and l cannot grow beyond a certain horizon see below we obtain lim k l f 5 k l lim k l nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l 4 6 lim k l nf 5 c nk k 1 nl l 1 1 4 7 nf 5 c 1 4 8 the quantity sf 5 nf 5 c 1 4 9 15 is the steady state of the new production function f 5 given by 4 5 note that by changing the constant c in 4 9 we can regulate the steady state sf 5 remark 4 3 see remark 2 1 remark 4 4 we observe that the new production function f 5 4 5 is reducible to the production function 4 2 proposed by capasso et al 15 when k and l nk and nl respectively nl nk 1 c 1 in 4 5 and 1 nf 5 2 1 in 4 2 remark 4 5 figure 2 presents the surface of a two input production function of the type 4 5 for nf 120 3 nk 113 nl 115 c 1 18 without singularities see remark 4 6 remark 4 6 employing the same procedure we can determine now in a fairly straightforward manner the corresponding one input analogue of the new two input production function 4 5 thus let us derive a new production function y f x whose growth is governed the growth in x which we assume to be logistic hence we can formulate the following problem within the framework of the growth model g 2 r g 2 r g 2 x nxx x nx x e at a 0 x r 4 10 u 2 f ax 1 x nx df dx bf 1 f nf 4 11 where the vector field u 2 ax 1 x nx x represents the infinitesimal action defined by the lie group g 2 4 10 separating the variables and integrating the differential equation 4 11 yields the follwoing solution production function y f 6 x nf 6 x c nx x x 4 12 where c r is the constant of integration and b a with the corresponding steady state given by sf 6 nf 6 c 1 4 13 note that in this case as well the new production function 4 12 exhibits first an s shaped growth in the region 0 nx followed by a decline for x nx let us investigate this case from the economics point of view in more detail let us recover the corresponding group action that affects the input x t so that this action could be viewed as growth which entails the condition x t 0 indeed 16 figure 2 a two input production function of the type 4 5 with isoquants 17 consider the infinitesimal action u given by u u 1 x u 2 y so that u f 6 0 solving the last equation we obtain the following solutions u 1 a x nx x nx u 2 b y ny y ny 4 14 and u 1 a x x nx nx u 2 b y y ny ny 4 15 in view of the fact that x t y t 0 it follows from 4 14 and 4 15 that x a x nx x nx 0 x nx y b y ny y ny 0 y ny 4 16 and x a x x nx nx x nx y b y y ny ny y ny 4 17 so that both x t and y t represent growth solving the above equations we obtain x t nx 1 c 1 e at 0 x t nx nx 1 c 2 eat x t nx 4 18 where c 1 0 and c 2 0 are constants of integration next we determine the time interval corresponding to growth in x t it follows 4 18 that t 0 for 0 nx 1 c 1 e at nx and 0 t 1 a ln 1 c 2 for nx 1 c 2 eat nx substituting the equation 4 18 into 4 12 we arrive at the following function y t nf 6 c c 1 e at 1 0 t t 1 nf 6 c c 2 eat 1 t 1 t 1 a ln 1 c 2 4 19 18 where t 1 is the time at which the function shifts from the logistic to a different growth type let us assume to be a positive integer furthermore we note that y t increases or decreases depending on whether is odd or even respectively to assure that 4 19 is compatible with 4 12 we assume that is an even integer see below next rewrite the production function given by 4 19 as follows y h 0 t ht 1 t y 1 t ht 1 y 2 t 4 20 where hc t is the heaviside unit step function y 1 t nf 6 c c 1 e at 1 y 2 t nf 6 c c 2 eat 1 in this view the function 4 20 may interpreted as an impulse response function indeed a sudden change in the input at t t 1 causes a jump in the output from y 1 t to y 2 t from the economics viewpoint we can identify this phenomenon as a shock 68 which means that a sudden change in exogenous factors yields the corresponding sudden change in production see 48 57 39 for more details and referenses the gap between y 1 t and y 2 t caused by a sudden change in x t at t t 1 is given by d y 1 y 2 t 1 cnf 6 c a 2 e bt 1 ca 1 e bt 1 c c 1 e at 1 a 1 c c 2 eat 1 a 1 4 21 where d y 1 y 2 t 1 denotes the distance between the two curves at t t 1 next we note that y t nf 6 c 1 as t 1 a ln 1 c 2 4 22 note that if is an even number the rhs of 4 22 is precisely the steady state 4 13 figure 3 presents the graph of a one input production function of the type 4 12 generated for nf 6 100 2 and c 2 note the function given by 4 12 defines an invariant i k l of the infinitesimal action determined by vector field u 1 3 2 for f 6 k or l and x l or k namely u 1 i 0 where i k l l nl l nk k k 19 figure 3 a one input production function of the type 4 12 20 remark 4 7 repeating the above calculation within the frameworks of the growth models 3 3 and 3 4 we arrive at the production functions y f 7 k l nf 7 k l c nk k k l 4 23 and y f 8 k l nf 8 k l c nl l k l 4 24 respectively where the parameters and are the same as in 4 5 we also note that the functions 4 23 and 4 24 are elements of the families 3 7 and 3 8 respectively as expected 5 the problem of maximization of profit under conditions of perfect competition in 1947 paul duglas gave his presidential address to the american economics as sociation in which he referred to a coherent assembly of the statistical evidence accumulated in the course of the previous 20 years while he and other people were studying various economic data that confirmed the validity of the cobb douglas pro duction function it is safe to assume that this event marked the beginning of its universal acceptance by the mainstream economic science he wrote in 23 the cobb douglas function was being widely used and that a host of younger scholars led by my former student paul samuelson his colleague solow and marc nerlove the son of my friend and former colleague samuel nerlove were all pushing for ward into new and more sophisticated fields in fact marc nerlove gave a series of lectures at the econometric workshop held at the university of minnesota in 1957 which were subsequently published a few years later in a book 53 one of the problem considered by the author was the problem of maximization of profit of a firm under conditions of perfect competition in both factors and product markets under the assumption that the revenue of the firm from sales was determined by the cobb douglas production function in what follows we shall solve the problem using the same arguments mutatis mutandis as in 53 by assuming that the revenue of the firm from sales is now determined by the new production function 4 5 consider an individual firm functioning under conditions of perfect competition in both factors and product markets it attempts to maximize its profits by employing optimal quantities of inputs and producing an optimal quantity of output at the same time its purchases of factors and supply of output do not affect the prices of 21 the factors involved and the final product therefore the said prices are assumed to be given while the profits are to be maximized let p 0 p 1 p 2 be the profit the price of the final product the cost of using one unit of capital and the wage of labor respectively hence we have p 0 y p 1 k p 2 l 5 1 traditionally in problems like this the output y is assumed to be related to the inputs k capital and l labor by the cobb douglas production function 1 1 instead suppose now y is related to k and l via the new production function f 5 4 5 next let us solve the problem of maximization of the profit given by 5 1 subject to the constraint implied by 4 5 the corresponding lagrangian function l is readily found to be l y k l y nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l 5 2 where is a lagrange multiplier for profit to be a maximum the total differential dl y k l d g 0 5 3 where g y nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l 5 4 the condition 5 3 yields l y nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l 0 l k p 1 p 0 nf 5 c nk k k l 1 nl l nl l 1 l c nk k nl l k l 2 0 l l p 2 p 0 nf 5 c nl l l k 1 nk k nk k 1 k c nk k nl l k l 2 0 l y p 0 0 5 5 the equations 5 5 give us necessary conditions for maximum profit solving 5 5 22 with the aid of the computer algebra system maple we get y nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l p 2 nf 5 k nk k p 0 nky nf 5 y p 0 nky nf 5 y ln nf 5 y cy p 2 nf 5 k nk k ln nk k k p 0 nky nf y ln nl l l 5 6 the resulting equations 5 6 are sufficient to determine the variables y k and l the corresponding sufficient conditions for maximum profit are provided by the necessary conditions established above supplemented by the following second order condition d 2 l 0 or given the fact that in 5 2 is linear in y k and l see 5 1 and p 0 by 5 5 we have d 2 g 0 5 7 where g k l p 0 nf 5 k l c nk k nl l k l solving 5 7 using maple we arrive at the following set of inequalities 1 0 1 0 2 k nk 2 l nl nl 2 k nk nk 2 l nl 0 2 k nk 2 l nl nl 2 k nk nk 2 l nl 0 5 8 the first two inequalities entail that 0 1 the second two inequalities imply that k nk 2 and l nl 2 hence we arrive at the following conditions that assure maximum profit 0 1 k nk 2 l nl 2 2 k nk 2 l nl nl 2 k nk nk 2 l nl 0 2 k nk 2 l nl nl 2 k nk nk 2 l nl 0 5 9 next we observe that since limt k t nk and limt l t nl the last inequality in 5 9 implies that 0 1 5 10 23 which in turn implies that the assumption of perfect competition and maximization of profit are inconsistent in the case when 1 finally we conclude that the equations and inequalities 5 6 5 9 and 5 10 constitute sufficient conditions for maximum profit of a firm in the environment of perfect competition the equations 5 6 determine the output a firm will deliver and the inputs of factors it will employ once the prices of the product and factors are established therefore the conclusions are pretty much the same as in the case when the revenue is determined by the cobb douglas production function 1 1 considered in nerlove 53 the case of imperfect competition in both factor and production markets will be considered in a forthcoming paper note that all of the calculations above have been carried out under the assumption that c 0 if c 0 the condition 5 10 changes to 1 6 the wage share and logistic growth the labor share is the fraction of national income or the income of a particular economic sector defined as the share which is payed out to employees therefore it is often also called the wage share as is well known the wage share in the economic growth models governed by the cobb douglas production function 1 1 is a constant more specifically its constant value can be derived directly from the cobb douglas function and expressed in terms of the output elasticity of capital in a simple and elegant way when the cobb douglas function say enjoys constant return to scale see for example rabbani 58 the invariance of the wage share is subject to bowley s law 9 10 or the law of the constant wage share which states that the share of national income that is paid out to the employees as compensation for their work normally in the form of wages remains unchanged invariant over time 45 50 67 economic data collected in different countries till about 1980 gave rise to and most strongly supported this law which was widely accepted by the economics community at the time however this is no longer the case on both counts see for example schneider 67 for more details and references in view of the mathematics presented above it should not be viewed as a sur prise indeed the ivariance of wage share is linked to the cobb douglas production function which in turn is a consequence of exponential growth as shown by sato 65 next since one of the the main points of this research project is the idea that we must depart from the exponential growth model and accept the logistic one let us ivestigate how this transition affects the wage share 24 in what follows we shall propose a new formula for the wage share compatible with logistic growth and support our claim by a rigorous mathematical analysis first let us recover the formula for the wage share as an invariant of a prolonged infinitesimal group action given in terms of the corresponding projective coordinates defined as the output capital ration y k y and the labor capital output l k x the terminology and notations that we will use are compatible with those adopted by olver 55 56 and saunders 66 consider a general production function y f k l t 6 1 under the assumption that the dependent and independent variables k l and y grow exponentially k ke t l le t y y e t 0 6 2 in view of the material presented in section 2 we know that the production function 6 1 is bound to be of the cobb douglas type 1 1 in terms of the projective coordinates it assumes the following form y f x t 6 3 clearly the one parameter lie group of transformations 6 2 induces the corre sponding action on the projective coordinates which is also exponential y ye t x xe t 0 6 4 with the corresponding infinitesimal action given by the vector field u compare it with 2 4 given by u x x y y 6 5 following saunders 66 let us suppose that r 2 r is a trivial bundle so that pr 1 and x y are adapted coordinates then the corresponding jet bundles are j 1 1 r and j 1 1 0 r 2 as per the commutative diagram 6 7 where the first jet manifold of is given by j 1 j 1 p p r p 6 6 with adapted coordinates x y yx j 1 r 2 r r 1 0 1 id 6 7 25 here 1 1 0 next the first prolongation of u on r 2 is the following vector field pr 1 u u 1 which has to be a symmetry of the cartan distribution on j 1 see saunders 66 for more details that is the vector field pr 1 u u 1 x x y y x y yx yx 6 8 is required to be a symmetry of the cartan distribution on j 1 indeed consider a basic contact form dy yxdx next in view of the above we require that the one form lu 1 is a contact form where l denotes the lie derivative thus we compute lu 1 lu 1 dy yxdx lu 1 dy lu 1 yx dx yx lu 1 dx d u 1 y u 1 yx dx yxd u 1 x dy x y yx dx yxdx yxdx x y yx yxdx yx x y yx yx dx 6 9 the last line of 6 9 implies that the expression in the parentheses above vanishes which entails that x y yx yx therefore the first prolongation u 1 of u is found to be u 1 x x y y yx yx 6 10 the vector field 6 10 represents an infinitesimal action of a one parameter lie group of transformations in a three dimensional prolonged space hence we expect to obtain 3 1 2 fundamental differential invariants indeed solving the correspond ing partial differential equation by the method of characteristics we arrive at the following set of two fundamenal differential invariants i 1 yx i 2 yxx 6 11 as expected which means that any other differential invariant of the prolonged in finitesimal group action defined by 6 10 if a function of i 1 and i 2 now combining the fundamental differential invariants 6 11 in such a way that the parameters and disappear we arrive at the following differential invariant i i 1 i 2 xyx y 6 12 which we immediately recognize to be precisely the wage share sl see for example rabbani 58 and schneider 67 for more details 26 therefore we conclude that not only the cobb douglas production function 1 1 but also the wage share sl i given by 6 12 is a consequence of the exponential growth in k and l as a differential invariant obtained within the framework of the growth model g r 2 where the action of the lie group g is given by 2 2 that is exponential growth the wage share function 6 12 now let us redo the above calculations for the growth model g 1 r 2 where the action of g 1 is given by 3 1 and thus give a solution to the seemingly unresolved problem of the determination of why bowley s law 9 10 does not hold true anymore in post 1960 s data 8 24 37 44 first we observe in the example considered above the exponential growth in k and l induced the corresponding exponential growth in the projective coordinates x l k and y y k however the logistic growth in k and l given by 3 1 does not translate into the same type of transformations for the projective coordinates x and y therefore let us assume that the growth in k is suppressed by say excessive debt and so it does not affect logistic growth in l and y hence both projective coordinates x and y grow logistically that is we have x 1 1 1 x 1 e t y 1 1 1 y 1 e t 0 6 13 where we assumed without loss of generality that both carrying capacities were equal to one the corresponding infinitesimal action of the lie group g 1 is given by the vector field u 1 x 1 x x y 1 y y 6 14 to determine its first prolongation u 1 1 pr 1 u 1 we proceed as above within the same framework as in the previous case see the commutative diagram 6 7 we note first that the vector field u 1 1 on j 1 is projectable since the bundle tr 2 r 2 is endowed with a vector structure see saunders 66 chapter 2 for more details next define u 1 1 x 1 x x y 1 y y x y yx yx 6 15 and require that the vector field 6 15 is a symmetry of the cartan distribution which will assure that 6 15 is the first prolongation of 6 14 indeed consider again a basic contact form dy yxdx then again lu 1 1 is a contact form iff u 1 1 is a symmetry of the cartan distribution on j 1 which in turn assures that 27 6 15 is indeed the first prolongation of 6 14 where l as before denotes the lie derivative thus we compute l u 1 1 l u 1 1 dy yxdx l u 1 1 dy l u 1 1 yx dx yx lu 1 1 dx d u 1 1 y u 1 1 yx dx yxd u 1 1 x 1 2 y dy x y yx dx yxdx 2 xyxdx 1 2 y yxdx x y yx yx 2 xyx dx 1 2 y yx 2 yyx x y yx yx 2 xyx dx 6 16 in view of the above l u 1 1 is again a contact form provided the expression in the parenthesis that appears in the last line of 6 16 vanishes hence we have yx 2 yyx x y yx yx 2 xyx 0 or x y yx 2 x 2 y yx 6 17 we conclude therefore that the first prolongation of the vector field u 1 given by 6 14 is the following fector field u 1 1 x 1 x x y 1 y y 2 x 2 y yx yx 6 18 whose infinitesimal action brings about the following two fundamental differential invariants i 1 y 1 y x x 1 i 2 2 x 2 yx y 1 2 1 x x 6 19 in order to eliminate the parameters and let us consider the following combina tion i i 1 i 2 i 1 i 2 2 2 x x 1 yx y y 1 6 20 definition 6 1 the differential invariant i given by 6 20 is called a modified wage share s l i so that s l x 1 y 1 sl const 6 21 where sl is the classical wage share given by 6 12 28 remark 6 2 the modified wage share s l given by 6 21 is a differential invariant of the growth model g 1 r 2 where the action of the lie group g 1 is given by 3 1 while the classical wage share sl given by 6 12 is not that is a reason why sl has been in decline it may be attributed to the fact that post 1960 economic data has been generated within the framework of the growth model g 1 r 2 rather than g r 2 more specifically it follows that the decline in sl is due to the relation see 6 21 indeed if the output to capital ratio y grows logistically faster than the labor to capital ratio x under the condition of supressed capital e g by excessive debt that is if the ratio x 1 y 1 in 6 21 clearly contributes to decline in sl since s l is a constant simply put more wealth real or perceived distributed among fewer people implies a marked decrease in the classical wage share sl and so bowley s law 9 10 no longer holds in the economic environment of the logistic growth model g 1 r 2 remark 6 3 the corresponding production function compatible with the infinites imal action generated by the vector field u 1 6 14 is readily found to be y f 9 k l t klc 3 lc 3 c 4 l k c 3 c 3 0 1 c 4 r 6 22 which we derived by integrating the equation i const where i is given by 6 20 and rewriting the solution in terms of k and l now let us analyse the second new production function 6 22 the partial derivatives of the production function f 9 6 22 called in economic literature marginal productivities are found to be mpk 1 1 c 4 1 kl c 3 c 3 c 4 k l k 1 k l c 3 1 c 4 1 kl c 3 2 6 23 mpl c 3 c 4 k 2 l l k 1 k l c 3 1 c 4 1 kl c 3 2 6 24 next the slope of an isoquant is the marginal rate of technical substitution mrts or technical rate of substitution trs thus mrts mpk mpl so that in our case mrts k l 1 c 3 c 4 l l k k 2 1 c 4 1 kl c 3 1 k l c 3 l k 6 25 which decreases when l grows and k declines we conclude therefore that 6 25 has concave up isoquants when l increases and k decreases that is if the labour capital ratio is less than approximately 1 c 3 2 in which case mrts increases while otherwise the isoquants are concave down since mrts decreases 29 recall that the new productoin function 4 5 does not enjoy constant return to scale now let us examine the function 6 22 from this viewpoint indeed for a factor r 1 the substitution k l rk rl in 6 22 yields f 9 rk rl rk rl c 3 rl c 3 c 4 rl rk c 3 rklc 3 lc 3 c 4 l k c 3 6 26 which means that the new production function 6 22 has constant returns to scale since it is a homogeneous function of degree one therefore we conclude that it satisfies the law of diminishing marginal returns and has constant return to scale which means it has a great potential for playing a pivotal role in various economic growth models finally let us investigate the behavior of the new production function 6 22 as t 0 and t under the assumption that both k t and l t grow logistically according to the one parameter lie group transformations defined by 3 1 to un derstand its behaviour when k and l are small we employ economic reasoning thus at the beginning of a production cycle a company say invests much of its resources into fixed assets e g infrastructure materials land etc and so when t is small it is safe to assume that k l which implies that f 9 t 1 c 4 k t 1 c 3 l t c 3 6 27 that is the production function y enjoys a similar behaviour to that of the cobb douglas production function 1 1 that has constant returns to scale when t both k and l grow logistically and so we have by 6 22 lim t f 9 k l t const 7 the new production function f 5 vis a vis eco nomic data in this section we present a similar analysis to the one conducted by cobb and dou blas 19 namely we l compare the new production function with some available us economic data from 1947 2016 we make use of the data from the period 1947 2016 that is provided by the federal reserve bank of st louis https fred stlouisfed org employing the fred tool the variables are as follows k capital services of 30 nonfarm business sector 79 l compensations of employees of nonfarm business sector 80 y real output of nonfarm business sector 81 the values of all vari ables are dimensionless they are index values with the values at 2009 taken as 100 to estimate the new production function 4 5 we have used r programming 43 employing the method of least squares and assuming the corresponding carrying ca pacities to be of the following values nf 5 120 nl 150 we have also assumed that 1 the resulting production function of the type 4 5 is found to be y 120 k 0 4063544 l 0 5936456 0 3118901 150 k 0 4063544 150 l 0 5936456 k 0 4063544 l 0 5936456 7 1 where c 0 3118901 0 4063544 and 0 5936456 see figure 4 figure 4 observed output vs estimated output using the new production function 4 5 the elasticity of substitution 1 see sato 62 of the new production function 4 5 in this case assumes the following form 1 l l k k l l k k k k 1 l l 1 7 2 31 where k nkc 1 c 1 nk c 1 e at l nlc 2 c 2 nl c 2 e bt while c 1 and c 2 are constants the vairable 1 giving the best estimate when c 1 0 203 a 0 129 c 2 0 432 and b 0 118 ranges approximately from 0 0151724079 to 0 4982041724 whether the function f 5 derived using the lie group theoretical methods can accurately predict the future still remains to be seen but it looks like the function f 5 can predict the past more specifically while running our simulations we have noticed that the negative value of 1 0 0151724079 occurs in the year of 1958 excatly the year of a sharp economic downturn 32 see figure 5 figure 5 the elasticity of substitution of the new production function from 1947 to 2016 we conclude from the above that the time series from the period 1947 2016 that compares the observed and estimated outputs see figure 6 reveals that our model fits quite well the data with the the adjusted r squared value of 97 65 on the other hand the cobb douglas function 1 1 with a constant elasticity of substitutions i e 1 does not provide satisfactory results in terms of the values of parameters and the best estimation of the cobb douglas function that we managed to have obtained using the same method is as follows y 0 2464455 k 1 6612365 l 0 6612365 7 3 where c 0 2464455 1 6612365 and 0 6612365 we see that this negative value of the parameter is not compatible with the definition of the cobb douglas production function given by the formula 1 1 32 figure 6 the linear regression of the observed and estimated outputs of the period from 1947 to 2016 8 summary and discussion in this paper we have introduced a new logistic growth model g 1 r 2 given by 3 1 as an extension and natural continuation of the preceeding studies in the area of economic growth done by ryuzo sato 62 63 64 65 as well as a new frame work for the development of more general production functions that we believe fit better current economic data the resulting new production functions 4 5 and 6 22 are consequences of the logistic growth in factors capital and labor the former function has shown to provide an adequate estimate for economic data as for the latter there are indications that it will perform even better the work in this direction is underway furthermore we have presented a purely mathematical justification of why bowley s law 9 10 no longer holds true in post 1960 economic data by introducing a new notion of modified wage share 6 21 our research has also demonstrated that there can not be exponential growth of production while factors grow logistically we are inclined to believe that this is the most important consequence of our studies indeed if one forces the production function to grow exponentially i e by setting h f cf in 4 3 while the factors k and l grow logistically as in 3 1 the resulting production function will be of the form y f 10 k l t c 1 k 1 k c 2 l 1 l c 3 8 1 33 where we assumed without loss of generality that nk nl 1 the production function f 10 8 1 blows up very quickly near the singularities at k 1 and l 1 similarly unsatisfactory result can by obtained by enforcing logistic growth in the production function while the factors k and l grow exponentially that is by setting h f cf 1 f in 2 8 the resulting production function will not even grow when we were starting this project our original goal was to only extend the theoretical framework based on the lie group theory developed by sato we did not excpect that the resulting production functions would perfom so well therefore the results obtained in this paper have exceeded our expectations we see many applicatoins in both economic theory of growth and applied math ematics where the new production functions 4 5 and 6 22 as well as the new modified wage share 6 21 can be used essentially mutatis mutandis by simply re placing the cobb douglas function or its generalizations like the ces function for example and wage share with them as appropriate as we have already mentioned in introduction the idea that exponential growth ought to be replaced with the logistic one is slowly but surely becoming more and more accepted by the scientists developing various growth models see capasso et al 15 engbers et al 25 brass 11 ferrara and guerrini 26 27 28 29 30 31 leach 52 oliver 54 tinter 75 fore more details and references in light of the results that we have obtained so far some of the projects that we have learned from and appreciated so much we belive could be modified accordingly which in turn may lead to more accurate mathematical models for example in ferrara and guerrini 30 the authors generalized the ramsey model by introducing the logistic growth in l which was a very adequate assumption however they still used the cobb douglas function which we believe is not entirely accurate because the logistic growth in l suggests that the growth model g 3 r 2 given by 3 4 is underpinning the dynamics of the variables involved and so one has to use the corresponding production function compatible with 3 4 that is the function 3 8 instead of the cobb douglas production funciton 1 1 similarly capasso et al 15 did introduce a modified production function 4 2 instead of the usual cobb douglas production function 1 1 however it was done heuristically and a more natural choice for a production function in the model developed by the authors is either the production function 4 5 or 6 22 both of which were derived here in a systematic way more specifically the partial differential equation k t x t k x t f k x t l x t k x t x rn t 0 governing the dynamics of k should use either 4 5 or 6 22 in place of f which we believe will lead to more accurate results 34 acknowledgement the authors wish to thank ryuzo sato for valuable comments constructive critique and suggestions the second
