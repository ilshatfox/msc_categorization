30 c p 11000 montevideo uruguay abstract we consider an special dynamics of a quantum walk qw on a line initially the walker localized at the origin of the line with arbitrary chirality evolves to an asymptotic stationary state in this stationary state a measurement is performed and the state resulting from this measurement is used to start a second qw evolution to achieve a second asymptotic stationary state in previous works we developed the thermodynamics associated with the entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom in the qw here we study the application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics to the process between the two stationary states mentioned above we show that i the entropy change has upper and lower bounds that are obtained analytically as a function of the initial conditions ii the energy change is associated to a heat transfer process key words quantum thermodynamic quantum walk pacs 03 67 a 05 30 d 1 introduction quantum walks qws constitute the quantum analogue of classical random walks 1 and also the quantum version of cellular automata 2 they have been intensively investigated especially in connection with quantum informa tion science 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 as in the classical case qws have been proposed as elements to design quantum algorithms 10 11 12 13 and more recently it has been shown that they can be used as a universal model for quantum computation 14 15 we have been investigating 16 17 18 the asymptotic behavior of the qw on a line focusing on the probability distribution of chirality independently of po sition we showed that this distribution has a stationary long time limit that preprint submitted to elsevier 16 july 2018 http arxiv org abs 1503 08453 v 1 depends on the initial conditions and that it is possible to define a thermo dynamic equilibrium between the degrees of freedom of position and chirality 19 20 21 22 for this equilibrium state we have introduced a temperature concept for an unitary closed system on the other hand the fundamental lower bound of the thermodynamic energy cost of information processing has been a topic of active research 23 24 on average the minimum amount of work required to erase 1 bit of information from a memory is t ln 2 25 in the last decades developments in nano science have enabled the direct measurement of such minuscule amounts of work for small non equilibrium thermodynamic systems 26 at the same time recent advances in technology have opened the possibility of building useful quantum computing devices 27 therefore it seems essential to identify bounds on the thermodynamic energy cost of information processing 28 for these new quantum devices in the present paper we study the relationship between the qw thermody namics and information processing in particular we show that it is possible to apply the thermodynamic laws to the qw dynamics after a measurement process we obtain the upper and lower bound for the asymptotic change of the entanglement entropy our result may be thought as complementary to the results presented in refs 23 24 where the information content and thermodynamic variables are treated on an equal footing the paper is organized as follows in the next section the usual qw on a line is presented in the third section the system dynamics with measurement is developed in the fourth section the entropy change between the asymptotic stationary states is studied in the fifth section the laws of thermodynamics are applied to the same process finally in the last section we draw some conclusions 2 qw on a line the composite hilbert space of the qw is the tensor product ht h where ht is the hilbert space associated to the motion on a line and h is the chirality or coin hilbert space in this composite space the walker moves at discrete time steps t n along a one dimensional lattice of sites k z the direction of motion depends on the chirality states either right or left the wave vector can be expressed as the spinor t k ak t bk t k 1 2 where the upper lower component is associated to the left right chirality the qw is ruled by a unitary map whose standard form is 29 30 31 32 ak t 1 ak 1 t cos bk 1 t sin bk t 1 ak 1 t sin bk 1 t cos 2 where 0 2 is a parameter defining the bias of the coin toss here we take 4 for an unbiased or hadamard coin the probability of finding the walker at k t is p k t ak t 2 bk t 2 3 the global left and right chirality probabilities are defined as pl t k ak t 2 pr t k bk t 2 4 with pr t pl t 1 and the interference term is defined as q t k ak t b k t 5 in the generic case q t together with pl t and pr t are time depend func tions that have long time limiting values 16 which are determined both by the initial conditions and by the map in eq 2 the relation between the ini tial condition and the asymptotic distributions has also been recently explored in ref 33 let us call the mentioned limits as l lim pl t t r lim pr t t q 0 lim q t t i 6 where and are respectively the real and imaginary part of q 0 the following relations are verified 16 between l r and q 0 l 1 2 r 1 2 7 3 it is important to emphasize that the asymptotic behavior in eq 6 is deter mined by the interference term q 0 that only depends on the initial conditions the initial condition the walker localized at the origin with arbitrary chirality will play a central roll in our analytic treatment then 1 0 cos 2 exp i sin 2 0 8 where 0 and 0 2 define a point on the unit bloch sphere we obtain 16 q 0 1 2 1 1 2 cos sin cos i 2 sin 9 and also l and r using eq 7 3 dynamical evolution and measurement 3 1 first step we consider first the qw evolution starting from the initial condition given by eq 8 and determine the asymptotic density matrix the quantum density matrix is defined as t t t 10 substituting eq 1 into eq 10 we have t k k ak t a k t ak t b k t a k t bk t bk t b k t k k 11 where ak t and bk t depend also on the initial conditions and note that when t the limits of ak t and bk t are not defined because in general they have an oscillatory asymptotic behavior 4 however the limits given by eq 6 are always well defined in the following we call ak and bk to the values of ak t and bk t respectively evaluated at times large enough so that the asymptotic limit eq 6 is essentially attained let us define the asymptotic reduced density matrix as 1 c lim tr 4 lim l l l for t this matrix takes the following shape 1 c l q 0 q 0 r 12 3 2 second step when the asymptotic density matrix is attained a measurement of position and chirality is performed then the wave function collapses into one element of the set of eigenvectors of the measurement operator k where 1 0 0 1 13 after the measurement the density matrix has the form 1 k ak 2 k k k bk 2 k k 14 where k k eq 14 can be written in matrix form as 1 k ak 2 0 0 bk 2 k k 15 equation 14 sets a new initial condition and we will study the asymptotic evolution of the new density matrix essentially we must study the evolution of the densities k k we know from the qw dynamics that if the initial condition is given by eq 8 then the density matrix is given by eq 11 we can use these equations as a recipe to obtain the unknown evolutions that is when we choose a particular initial condition given by k we have u t k k u t n n an t k a n t k an t k b n t k an t k bn t k bn t k b n t k n n 16 where u t is the qw evolution operator and an t k and bn t k verify the map eq 2 that is an t k and bn t k are equivalent to some functions an t and bn t the expressions an t k and bn t k show explicitly their 5 dependence both on the chirality as with k the walker s initial position on a line therefore the new quantum density matrix is t u t 1 u t n n a 11 n n a 12 n n a 21 n n a 22 n n n n 17 where a 11 n n k ak 2 an t k a n t k bk 2 an t k a n t k 18 a 22 n n k ak 2 bn t k b n t k bk 2 bn t k b n t k 19 a 12 n n k ak 2 an t k b n t k bk 2 an t k b n t k 20 a 21 n n a 12 n n 21 we again point out that the probability density has an asymptotic limit for long times we now call the values of an t k and bn t k evaluated at such times an k and bn k respectively we want to calculate in this limit the reduced density matrix namely 2 c lim tr lim l l l t using the density matrix given by eq 17 we have 2 c lim l a 11 l l a 12 l l a 12 l l a 22 l l t 22 where lim l a 11 l l t k ak 2 l al k 2 k bk 2 l al k 2 23 6 lim l a 12 l l t k ak 2 l al k b l k k bk 2 l al k b l k 24 lim l a 22 l l t k ak 2 l bl k 2 k bk 2 l bl k 2 25 according to eqs 4 5 and 6 we define l l al k 2 26 r l bl k 2 27 q 0 l al k b l k 28 to obtain the explicit shape of l r and q 0 we can use again eqs 7 9 where the initial condition is the walker localized at the position k with chirality respectively i e 2 0 k 29 note that the principal difference between eq 8 and eq 29 is in the walker s initial position that is in eq 29 k is arbitrary and in eq 8 k 0 however even with this difference eq 5 continues to be valid for the calculation of q 0 because the original map eq 2 is invariant under translations and therefore this magnitude is independent of k for the same reason eqs 26 and 27 are independent of k and then eq 22 reduces to 2 c l l r r 30 where l l q 0 q 0 r 31 r l q 0 q 0 r 32 7 and l and r are given by eqs 7 9 moreover using the initial condition of eq 29 in eq 9 and eq 7 it is straightforward to obtain q 0 q 0 1 2 1 2 2 l r 1 1 2 2 r l 1 2 2 33 note that l and r eqs 31 32 are the asymptotic densities that correspond to initial conditions associated with the eigenvalues and respectively therefore eq 30 has a natural interpretation after the measurement the asymptotic reduced density matrix is the weighted average of the two densities associated with the two possible values of the chirality 4 entropy change the unitary evolution of the qw generates entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom which can be quantified through the associated von neumann entropy this entropy of entanglement is defined by the reduced density operator s c tr c log c 34 where denotes a proportionality constant the boltzmann constant for a pure state the minimum entropy s c 0 is attained the maximum entropy or minimum purity is to be found for the broadest possible proba bility distribution the equipartition over all pure states equation 34 can be expressed as a function of the eigenvalues of c and s c log log 35 using eqs 12 30 31 and 32 we can calculate the entanglement en tropies for the four stationary densities introduced in the previous section the eigenvalues of the density operator 1 c are 1 1 2 2 2 2 36 and those of 2 c are 2 1 2 2 1 37 8 the operators l and r have the same eigenvalues and they are lr 1 2 1 2 3 3 2 38 therefore the four entanglement entropies are expressed as s 1 c 1 log 1 1 log 1 39 s 2 c 2 log 2 2 log 2 40 s l lr log lr lr log lr 41 s r s l 0 139 42 we now show that s 2 c has a non obvious upper bound using a known theorem that plays an important role in many applications of quantum in formation theory 34 applying the mentioned theorem to the entropy of the mixture of quantum states given by eq 30 the following upper bound is obtained s 2 s l l log l r log r s 2 c 43 the entropies s 1 c s 2 c and the expression s 2 only depend on the inter ference term q 0 note that from eq 9 we have q 0 12 1 1 2 1 then we approximate the log functions in eqs 39 40 and 43 using the first few terms of their taylor series to calculate the entropy change between the two asymptotic stationary states s 2 c s 1 c 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 44 the distance between s 2 c and its upper bound can be approximated by s 2 s 2 c s l 4 2 1 2 45 combining eqs 43 44 and 45 it is easy to obtain the following upper bound for s 2 c s 1 c j 1 s l 2 2 2 s 2 c s 1 c 46 when q 0 vanishes eq 44 shows that s 1 c s 2 c and these entropies take their maximum value moreover in this case q 0 0 the qw dynamics can be described as a classical markovian process 30 it has a markovian 9 behavior both before and after the measurement the initial conditions for this behavior are 4 4 and 0 respectively when q 0 6 0 the measurement process essentially determines an entropy increase for the system s 2 c s 1 c 0 fig 1 dimensionless entropy change as a function of q 0 2 2 for the case 0 in thick line the entropy change given by eq 44 in dashed line the entropy change given by eq 45 the entropy change for a real q 0 is depicted in fig 1 the calculation was made using the entropy definition eqs 39 40 41 42 therefore the curves show that the lineal approximation proposed in eqs 44 45 is excellent 5 thermodynamic laws in previous works 19 20 21 22 we studied the behavior of the chirality dis tribution and we introduced the temperature concept for an unitary closed system in this theory one considers the system associated with the chirality degrees of freedom and described by c interacting through its entanglement with the position degrees of freedom the lattice as equivalent to the thermal contact with a bath therefore in equilibrium hc c 0 47 should be satisfied where hc is the interaction hamiltonian between the chi rality and the lattice in the qw case the explicit shape of hc is unknown for us however we know that the eigenvalues of hc are independent of the initial condition of the wave function they only depend on the unitary evolution in contrast the eigenvalues depend on the initial conditions and the corre sponding eigenvalues of hc we call the set of eigenfunctions common to the density matrix and the hamiltonian then in this basis the operators c 10 and hc are both diagonal moreover since only the relative difference between energy eigenvalues has physical significance we denote this set of eigenvalues by they may be interpreted as the possible values of the entanglement en ergy this interpretation agrees with the fact that is the probability that the system is in the eigenstate the precise dependence between and is determined by the type of ensemble we construct we propose that our equilibrium state corresponds to a quantum canonical ensemble to this end we set e z 48 where z is the partition function of the system that is z e e 49 and the parameter can be put into correspondence with an entanglement temperature t 1 2 log 50 the entanglement temperature eq 50 can take any finite infinite positive or negative value note that when the energy of a system is bounded from above there is no compelling reason to exclude the possibility of negative temperatures in this statistical mechanic frame it is possible to define the internal energy of entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom u 51 the variations of temperature t and internal energy u between the two asymptotic states can be calculatedas as functions of the interference term q 0 using eqs 36 and 37 together with eqs 50 and 51 we have 2 t 4 log 1 1 4 log 2 2 52 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 u 2 2 1 2 2 2 53 equation 52 shows that t 0 is only possible if 1 2 1 2 and this implies that q 0 0 then the two asymptotic states have the same temperature and in this sense we can to think of an isothermal process as the temperature concept makes sense only in an equilibrium state it is clear 11 that between these two asymptotic states the temperature is not defined additionally eq 53 implies that u 0 and vanishes when q 0 0 the first law of thermodynamics is now applied to the evolution between the two asymptotic stationary states expressed as u q w 54 where q is the qw heat absorbed during the measurement process and w is the work made over the qw thermodynamic work is defined to be measurable solely from the knowledge of external constraint variables in this system the only parametric dependence of the thermodynamical functions is with the temperature because the energy levels are maintained constant then w 0 therefore the first law is reduced to u q 55 from eq 55 we conclude that i the change of internal energy is due to the heat delivered during the measurement process ii the heat behaves as a state function then the real process can be substituted by a quasi static process between the two asymptotic stationary states characterized by their temperatures where it is possible to defined the infinitesimal dq fig 2 color on line the dimensionless entropy change in log scale as a function of the dimensionless interference term q 0 i the medium green surface is the change of entropy given by eq 44 the upper and lower red surfaces are the upper and lower bounds j 1 and j 2 given by eq 46 and eq 59 respectively in general for an irreversible process the second law of thermodynamics is expressed as s dq t 56 12 the question may be posed if this law is satisfied for the entropy temperature and heat that were defined in our system the answer to this question must be positive because the starting point of our theory has been to postulate the canonical distribution for the reduced density matrix therefore the ther modynamic laws are obeyed we do not know the temperature dependence with the absorbed heat in order to compute the integral in eq 56 however we can obtain a bound for this integral in order to verify the second law for the entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom we have t 1 t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the temperatures of the stationary states before and after the measurement then j 2 q t 2 dq t s 2 c s 1 c 57 therefore using eq 55 we can propose the second law for the entanglement entropy s 2 c s 1 c j 2 u t 2 0 58 the lower bound j 2 can be expressed as a function of the interference term q 0 eqs 36 37 50 53 55 58 j 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 59 in fig 2 we show the entropy change together with its bounds the entropy calculations were made using the definitions eqs 39 40 we conclude that the second law of thermodynamic in the form of eq 58 is satisfied by the theory developed in the present paper and additionally we show the correctness of the upper bound given by equation eq 46 6 conclusion in previous works we developed the thermodynamics associated with the en tanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom here we consider a special dynamics of a qw on a line initially the walker localized at the origin with arbitrary chirality evolves to an asymptotic stationary state then a measurement is performed and the state resulting from this measurement is the initial condition for a second qw dynamics to achieve a second asymptotic stationary state we have studied the first and second laws of thermodynamics in the process between the two stationary states mentioned before these asymptotic sta tionary states only depends on the initial conditions through the interference 13 term of the initial wave function we show that the change of entropy has up per and lower bounds and they are obtained analytically as a function of the initial conditions we have also shown that the measurement process changes the energy and this change is associated to a heat transference process moreover we prove that if the interference term vanishes the thermodynamics functions of the asymptotic stationary states do not change i acknowledge stimulating discussions with v ctor micenmacher and the sup port from pedeciba programa de desarrollo de las ciencias ba sicas and anii agencia
