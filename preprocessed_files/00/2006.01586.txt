stochastic modeling of an infectious disease part i understand the negative binomial distribution and predict an epidemic more reliably hisashi kobayashi dept of electrical engineering princeton university princeton nj 08544 u s a may 28 2020 summery why are the epidemic patterns of covid 19 so different among different cities or countries which are similar in their populations medical infrastructures and people s behavior why are forecasts or predictions made by so called experts often grossly wrong concerning the numbers of people who get infected or die the purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature of an epidemic disease such as covid 19 and answer the above questions the author hopes that this article will provoke discussions among the modeling communities and stimulate mathematically inclined people to study this interesting and important field i e mathematical epidemiology much of the work on infectious diseases has been based on sir deterministic models pioneered by kermack and mckendrick in 1927 in our study we will explore several stochastic models that can capture the essence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease which the deterministic model cannot explain a stochastic model in its formulation takes into account the random nature of an infectious disease thus such a model if properly constructed should be able to provide a more reliable and informative forecast of an epidemic pattern the stochastic model we study in this article is based on the birth and death process with immigration bdi for short which was originally proposed in the study of population growth or extinction of some biological species to the best of this author s knowledge the bdi process model has not been investigated by the epidemiology community perhaps for the reason we briefly discuss in section 2 the general birth and death bd process usually defies an attempt to obtain a closed solution for the time dependent i e transient probability distribution of the population size etc the bdi process however is among a small number of bd processes which we can solve analytically an important feature of the bdi process is that its probability distribution function is a generalized the sherman fairchild university professor of electrical engineering and computer science emeritus email hisashi princeton edu blog http

normalized by the mean of the bdi process is larger than r 1 1 furthermore a nbd with small r has a long tail in its distribution form like the zeta distribution aka zipf s law these properties of the

concluding remarks 21 a derivation of pgf 46 22 acknowledgments 24 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 2 1 introduction most of the mathematical models of infectious diseases seem to be based on the kermack mckendrick model published in 1927 2 which was proposed to explain the rapid rise and fall in the number of infected population observed in epidemics such as the great plague in london where more than 15 of the population died 1665 66 and the cholera outbreak in london caused by contamination in the thames river 1865 and the plague epidemic in bombay 1906 3 the model consists of a system of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the infected population i t the susceptible population s t and the recovered population r t kermack mckendrick s sir model is a deterministic model which provides the expected values of these processes which we denote as s t e s t i t e i t and r t e r t a majority of biological and epidemiological models 4 5 6 fall in this class of deterministic models actual observed data of the infected population for instance is merely an instance or a sample path of this stochastic process i t the process naturally deviates from the expected value i t obtained by a deterministic model thus a deterministic model alone fails to provide any quantitative explanation when observed data differ significantly from the expected value in a stochastic or probabilistic model on the other hand the intrinsic stochastic nature of a process is explicitly taken into account in its model formulation the importance of stochastic processes in relation to problems of population growth was pointed out by w feller in 1939 7 he considered the birth and death process in which the expected birth and death rates per person per unit time were constants say and d g kendall 8 extended feller s birth and death bd process by considering the birth and death rates as any specified functions of the time t t and t the bd process is a special class of time continuous discrete state markov process and has found applications in many scientific and engineering fields including population biology 9 teletraffic and queueing theory 10 11 12 system modeling 13 14 pp 63 94 15 pp 407 410 i have done some investigation with help from prof hideaki takagi whose unpublished lecture note at the university of tsukuba 16 provided me with several references as to who coined the term birth and death process with immigration and have found the english statistician m s bartlett 1910 2002 in his famous book an introduction to stochastic processes 17 1 st edition in 1955 in his discussion of the birth and death process in section 3 4 multiplicative chain subsection 3 4 1 the effect of immigration that he uses the phrase a birth death and immigration process but bartlett s doctoral student david g kendall 1918 2007 gives a detailed analysis of the bdi process in his 1949 article 18 which bartlett refers to in his 1949 article 19 so my tentative conclusion was that kendall was the first that worked on the bdi although he did not use the term birth death immigration or something to that effect another english statistician norman t j bailey published in 1964 the elements of stochas tic process with applications to the natural sciences 20 and in section 8 7 the effect of immigration pp 97 101 he gives a thorough treatment of the bdi process linda j s allen an introduction to stochastic processes with applications to biology 2 nd edition 2011 21 discusses the bdi process in section 6 4 4 simple birth and death with immigration pp 254 258 but her focus seems to be more on the stable case frank p kelly 12 gives a brief treatment providing the steady state distribution all other numerous textbooks on random processes make no mention of the bdi process and even the above handful of authors who might have had epidemi ologists in mind among their readership seem to treat the bdi process for its possible application to population biology and none allude to its use in epidemiology copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 3 2 a brief review of sir deterministic model as stated earlier a majority of mathematical models reported in the literature on infectious diseases have been deterministic models following the pioneering work of almost a century ago by w g kermack and a g mckendrick 2 1 they assumed 1 at any time t an individual is either susceptible s infected and infectious i or recovered and immune r 2 only susceptible individuals can get infected remain infectious for some time and recover and become completely immune 3 there are no births deaths immigration or emigration during the study period in other words the community is closed consequently individuals can only make two types of transitions i from s to i and ii from i to r thus the kermack mckendrick model is often referred to as an sir epidemic model a model which assumes no immunity i e a recovered person becomes immediately susceptible is called an sis model if we explicitly consider an exposed state during which an infected individual is not yet infectious the model is called an seir model a model in which immunity wanes after some period is called an sirs model and so forth in the remainder of this section we give a brief account of the sir model in a closed community so that the reader can compare this deterministic model to our stochastic model to be presented in the next section for details of the kermack mckedrick type deterministic models the readers are referred to abundant books and articles anderson and may 5 martcheva 6 to name just a few let s t i t and r t respectively 2 denote the number of the susceptible infected and re covered at time t since we assume no births deaths immigration nor emigration we have s t i t r t n for all t 0 1 where n is a constant number representing the population of the community from the set of assumptions stated above the deterministic processes can be defined by the following set of three differential equations ds t dt s t i t 2 di t dt s t i t i t 3 dr t dt i t 4 these differential equations together with 1 and the initial condition i 0 i 0 and r 0 0 5 1 william ogilvy kermack 1898 1970 was a scottish biochemist and anderson gray mckendrick 1876 1943 was a scottish military physician and epidemiologist 2 we adopt this notation to distinguish them from s t i t and r t which are stochastic processes as used in other parts of this article the time functions used in deterministic models usually correspond to the expectation or stochastic mean of the corresponding stochastic processes copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 4 define the deterministic model it is easy to see that s t is monotone decreasing and r t is monotone increasing the function i t increases or decreases at time t depending on whether the ratio rt defined by the following expression is greater or smaller than unity rt s t s 0 r 0 6 its initial value r 0 is referred to as the basic reproduction number a term having its origin in demography the ratio rt is called the effective reproduction number or the real time reproduction number and is more meaningful than r 0 which is a static number in estimating the current epidemic situation and making a decision to control the epidemic the term s t i t in 2 and 3 comes from the argument that the susceptible must have contact with the infected in order to get infected and if we assume some sort of uniform mixing the infections should occur at a rate proportional to s t i t consequently the unit of the parameter is person unit time person person whereas the other parameter 3 has the unit of person unit time person when the total population n of 1 is sufficiently large s t n is much larger than i t and can be treated as unchanged at least in the initial phase of an epidemic then by setting s t s 0 person unit time person 7 and by substituting this into 3 we have the following ordinary differential equation ode di t dt i t 8 from which and the initial condition 5 we readily find the solution for i t i t i 0 e at t 0 where a 9 which is an exponentially growing or decaying function depending on whether a 0 or a 0 when a 0 it is a constant i 0 for all t 0 when the infected i t grows to the extent that the approximation 7 no longer holds i e the infinite population assumption fails we have to deal with the nonlinear differential equations of 2 and 3 a major advantage of the sir model is that because of the product term s t i t the differential equations take into account explicitly the fact that occurrences of infections will gradually decreases towards to zero as the susceptible population becomes extinct towards the end of the infection processes the main drawback of the sir model on the other hand is its inability to capture any probabilistic fluctuation of the infection process the sir model may be an appropriate model in describing the interactions between the susceptible group and infected group in a closed environment such as a hospital retirement home cruise ship night club etc but it is a poor model in describing a major outbreak of an epidemic in a larger environment such as a city or a country where most infections take place independently and randomly and the product term s t i t does not have any significant meaning furthermore the product term makes the entire sir model a nonlinear system and makes the system mathematically intractable except for a few simple cases which may not be useful in reality 3 another greek letter is often used for the recovery rate but we use to be consistent with our notation in the next section copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 5 as we will show in this article and part ii 1 the deterministic model in addition to being unable to describe the stochastic fluctuation of an epidemic pattern is more likely to grossly overestimate the number of casualties thus the deterministic model is not only limited in its applicability but can be damaging and harmful in some cases 3 a stochastic model for an infectious disease in this and following sections we will discuss our stochastic model based on the birth and beath with immigration bdi process it is a special case of general birth and death bd process 4 before we present a detailed mathematical analysis of this model we will show an example of our simulation model based on the bdi process figure 1 shows the first 6 out of a total of 12 simulation runs consecutively done in one execution of our simulation program in a matlab script our simulator is based on the event scheduling approach 5 where events are arrivals of infected persons from the outside at rate persons day occurrences of secondary infections within the community at rate infections day infectious person and recovery deaths of the infected persons at rate recovery death day infected person the parameter values of 0 3 0 1 and 0 2 are assumed figure 2 plots the same set of curves in a semilog scale the exponential growth curves are shown as straight lines the initial part of the simulation is more clearly shown in the semilog scale figures 3 and 4 are the plots of the remaining six runs there are at least two questions concerning these simulation runs 1 why are the variations among different simulation runs so large 2 there are more runs whose plots are below the deterministic model curve does the deter ministic model tend to overestimate the size of the infected population if so why the analysis of the bdi process in the following sections should be able to answer these ques tions 3 1 formulation for the time dependent solution for the stochastic model let i t represent the number of infected persons at time t and pn t be the time dependent or transient probability mass function pmf 6 of the process i t i e pn t pr i t n n 0 1 2 and t 0 10 we assume that each infected person is infectious and infects susceptible persons at rate persons unit time person where the time unit can be arbitrary e g a second an hour a day etc let us assume that an infected person recovers gets removed or dies at rate unit time thus 1 unit time is the mean infectious period the ratio is equal to the basic reproduction 4 william willy feller introduced what is now known as the birth and death process in his 1939 article 7 published in german regarding the problem of population growth he used the term vermehrung reproduction and tod death david g kendall in his 1948 paper 8 referred to feller s model as a birth and death process feller used this term in his volume i 9 whose first edition was in 1950 5 the time asynchronous event scheduling approach is a more time efficient and accurate simulation method than a time synchronous approach see e g 13 pp 230 234 or 14 pp 626 630 6 we could use perhaps a more common term the probability distribution function but pmf is more explicit that we are dealing with a discrete distribution not a continuous distribution copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 6 number i e the mean number of infections caused by an infected person during the infectious period we can formulate an infectious disease as a birth and death bd process by defining the birth and death rates both of which are simple linear functions of the state n of the process i t n n n n 11 a few remarks are in order this particular state dependent bd process is also known as the birth death immigration bdi process see e g 12 p 14 for the steady state distribution in which the parameters and represent the birth i e secondary infection death i e recovery or death and immigration i e arrival of an infected individual from outside rates respectively a few remarks are in order 1 in actuality recovery removal and death are distinctly different matters in analyzing the infection process however these three sources of loss from the susceptible or infected population are mathematically equivalent in the sense they will not contribute to the infection process in the future we assume here that those who have recovered from the disease have acquired immunity and will not be susceptible nor infectious the assumption that each infected individual recovers or is removed or dies at rate is equivalent to assuming that the duration s that each sick person remains infectious is exponentially distributed with mean 1 that is pr s s 1 e s s 0 12 2 it can be shown mathematically that many of our results to be obtained in terms of the probability mass function pmf of i t and other related quantities are insensitive to the actual distribution of s all that matters is that we set s 1 where s e s 3 in the present paper we assume that the population is homogeneous and the susceptible population size remains sufficiently large thus mathematically treated as infinite further more the parameters and are assumed to be constant many of our results can be extended to the case of multiple types of populations e g clustering of infections a model with the susceptible population decreases as some of them get infected and the case where the model parameters values change e g the situation where the infectious rate may change as people s behavior changes and these generalized models will be discussed in subsequent reports we can show see e g 15 pp 407 408 that the pmf 10 of this bd process should satisfy the following set of linear differential difference equations a k a kolmogorov s forward equation dp 0 t dt p 0 t p 1 t dpn t dt n 1 pn 1 t n pn t n 1 pn 1 t n 1 2 3 13 with the initial condition i 0 i 0 i e pn 0 n i 0 n 0 1 2 14 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 7 where m n is kronecker s delta we transform the above set of infinitely many equations 13 into a single equation by using the probability generating function pgf see e g 15 p 402 defined by g z t e zi t n 0 znpn t 15 multiply the set of equations 13 by zn and sum them from n 0 to obtaining the following partial differential equation g z t t z 1 z g z t z g z t 16 with the boundary condition g z 0 zi 0 17 3 2 stochastic means of the infected process i t and related processes although the process i t is the main focus of our analysis it will be worthwhile to introduce related processes and our assumptions definition 1 1 the process a t is the cumulative count of external arrivals of infectious individuals from the outside we assume that a t is a poisson process with rate persons unit time 2 the process b t is the cumulative count of internally infected individuals we assume that the birth of such persons occurs at the rate of persons unit time infectious person 3 the process r t is the cumulative count of recovered removed or dead individuals we assume that the departure of such persons occurs at the rate of persons unit time infected person note that all infected persons are infectious persons until their recovery removal death 4 the process i t is the present number of infected persons i e i t i 0 a t b t r t 18 the expectation and variance of the above processes will be of our interest which we denote by a t e a t b t e b t r t e r t and i t e i t 19 2 a t e a t a t 2 etc 20 before we discuss how to find the pgf g z t from the pde 16 let us derive first an ordinary differential equation for i t by dividing both sides of 16 by z 1 g z t we will have z 1 1 lng z t t z lng z t z 21 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 8 by setting z 1 we find 7 di t dt i t 22 where on the lhs 8 we first set z 1 which corresponds to differentiation at z 1 and use l ho pital s rule obtaining 9 e i t i t the ordinary differential equation 22 can be solved yielding i t i 0 e at a eat 1 t 0 where i 0 i 0 and a 23 if the model parameters are set to new values say to and at some point t t 1 0 then the solution i t for t t 1 is given by i t i 1 e a t t 1 a ea t t 1 1 t t 1 where i 1 i t 1 a 24 it should be clear that i t diverges to infinity if a 0 in 23 and converges to a in the limit t if a 0 similarly in 24 the process converges to a if a 0 if a 0 then 10 i t i 0 t i 0 a t t 0 when a 0 25 in figure 5 we show the case where 0 3 0 1 and 0 2 and at t 1 30 a new parameter 0 06 is set whereas the original values of and are retained the mean values of other processes can be easily found a t is a poisson process with rate which implies a t t for all t 0 26 since each person in the infected population i t infects others at the rate of persons unit time the differential of b t is given by db t dt i t 27 from this and 23 we obtain b t t 0 i u du i 0 e at 1 a eat 1 a 2 t a a i t i 0 a t 0 t t 1 28 7 alternatively we can obtain this differential equation directly by multiplying each equation in 13 by n and summing them up from n 0 to infinity 8 the abbreviations lhs and rhs mean the left hand side and right hand side respectively 9 here we use an important property of pgf i e g z t t e i t zi t 1 and by setting z 1 the rhs becomes e i t we changed the order of differentiation w r r to z and t which can be justified because the function g z t is an analytic function i e it is continuous and differentiable everywhere 10 the second term becomes 0 0 so we apply l ho pital s rule copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 9 for t t 1 we find b t b t 1 i 1 e a t t 1 1 a t t 1 a ea t t 1 1 a 2 a i 1 e a t t 1 a ea t t 1 1 i 0 t a i t i 0 a t where a t t 29 which takes the same form as that for t t 1 it should be worthwhile to note that both 28 and 29 could be derived from the mean value of the identity equation 18 together with the relation r t b t which is evident as shown below the recovery process r t should satisfy the following differential equation similar to 27 dr t dt i t 30 thus it readily follows r t i t i 0 a t a 0 t t 1 i t i 0 a t a t t 1 31 the above expressions for i t and other processes can be viewed as our deterministic or non probabilistic model for the dynamics of the bdi process from these simple expressions we can extract a few important characteristics concerning the mean values of i t and others 1 a determines the exponential growth or decay rate of b t r t as well as i t 2 is merely a linear scaling factor for i t and other processes and so is i 0 the initial number of the infected 11 3 if a 0 then i t grows exponentially without bound if a 0 it decays exponentially towards a if a 0 i t i 0 t i e i t grows linearly 4 the ratio of the infection rate or reproduction rate to the recovery or removal rate r 0 32 is called the basic reproduction number in epidemiology see e g 6 p 21 the term was originally defined in the context of a deterministic model called the sis susceptible infected susceptible epidemic model it is the average number of persons whom an infectious person infects before his her recovery removal or death the reproduction number determines whether the infection will grow exponentially die out or remain constant depending on whether r 0 1 r 0 1 or r 0 1 respectively the exponential parameter a can be expressed in terms of r 0 and a r 0 1 33 11 eq 23 can be rewritten as i t i 0 a eat a so a i 0 is the multiplying coefficient of the exponential term eat copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 10 5 the amount of time t that takes for i t or other related quantities to double and thes exponential growth parameter a are related by eat 2 or equivalently at 0 693 34 note that both the integral and derivatives of the exponential function eat are also eat thus the above formula for t equally applies when cumulative numbers or incremental numbers are to be counted for a given a via an observed t 6 unless we can expect to increase the value of by improving the medical service or producing an effective vaccine to immunize the susceptible population the only options we have for controlling an infectious disease is to increase by removing as many infectious individuals away from susceptible population as possible and or to decrease by increasing the so called social distances between the susceptible and the infectious we will provide an illustrative example in part ii 1 example 1 consider the following community the external arrival rate of infected individuals 0 2 persons day i e one such such incidence every 5 days on average the average number of days required for an infected person to recover be removed or die is 1 10 days i e the recovery rate 0 1 per day for each infected person suppose that the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual is estimated as r 0 3 for each infectious person then this value and provide an estimate of the infectious rate 0 3 persons day infected person thus the exponential growth parameter is estimated as a 0 2 0 one can check the validity of the model and or consistency among the three estimated parameters by computing a second estimate of the a from the formula 34 in part ii we will discuss various ways of estimating the model parameters once we have obtained reliable model parameters we can predict the expected value of the infected process i t assuming that there was no infected person at t 0 i e i 0 i 0 0 i t a eat 1 e 0 2 t 1 35 thus this curve predicts the expected number of the infected population excluding those who have recovered been removed or have died i 0 0 i 5 1 7 i 10 15 0 i 15 19 1 i 20 53 6 i 25 147 4 i 30 402 5 i 35 1 095 5 i 40 2 980 0 i 45 8 102 1 i 50 22 025 5 3 3 steady state distribution of the i t so far we have discussed only the mean values of the random process i t and other processes before we find the probability mass functions pn t n 0 1 2 for any t we obtain in this section the steady state distribution limt pn t n if it exists we know already that when a 0 such distribution does not exist thus the steady state distribution can possibly exist only when a 0 in order to find it we set the lhs of the pde 16 equal to zero obtaining the following ordinary differential equation for the pgf g z z dg z dz g z 0 36 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 11 which readily leads to d lng z dz z 37 integrating the above and using the boundary condition g 1 t 1 for any t we find g z 1 1 z r where r 38 this pgf reminds us of the negative binomial distribution nbd this distribution was originally introduced to express the probability of the number of failures n needed to achieve r successes in a sequnce of bernoulli trials when the probability of failure is q definition 2 negative binomial distribution nbd negative binomial distribution nb r q is defined by pnbn n r 1 n 1 q rqn n r n r 1 q rqn n 0 1 2 39 where the parameter r is a positive real number when r is a positive integer and 0 q 1 the above reduces to the classical definition of the shifted 12 negative binomial distribution sometimes called the pascal distribution associated with bernoulli trials the gamma function x is defined for a positive real number x by 13 x 0 yx 1 e y dy x 0 40 the probability generating function of nb r q of 39 is given by g z n 0 n r 1 n 1 q rqnzn 1 q 1 qz z q 1 41 the mean and variance of a rv random variable x possessing this distribution can be readily found e x qr 1 q and var x qr 1 q 2 42 from 38 and the above formula we readily find the steady state distribution of i t for a 0 is given as follows 12 p 14 n lim t pn t n r 1 n n 1 r 43 4 time dependent probability distribution of the infected pro cess i t the partial difference equation pde 16 for the pgf g z t is a linear pde and is sometimes referred to as planar differential equation see 22 14 pp 600 605 this type of pde can be solved by using lagrange s method with its auxiliary differential equations which is discussed in appendix a 14 12 some authors define the negative binomial distribution as the distribution of the number of trials instead of the number of failures needed to achieve r successes under this definition n r r 1 r 2 the probability distribution 39 is then referred to as the shifted negative binomial distribution see e g 15 pp 59 62 13 this definition can be extended for a complex number z with z 0 14 it will be worth noting that ren and kobayashi 23 24 discuss this type of pde in the analysis of multiple on off sources in traffic characterization of a data network copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 12 4 1 when the system is initially empty i e i 0 0 when the system is initially empty i e i 0 0 its pgf can be found by solving the pde given by see a 20 of appendix a g z t a eat eat z r where a and r 44 if we define a function t t eat 1 eat 45 we can write 44 compactly as g z t 1 t 1 t z r 46 which is the pgf of the generalized negative binomial distribution nb r t defined in definition 2 thus we find that the pmf of the bdi process i t is given by pn t pr i t n n r 1 n 1 t r t n n 0 1 2 47 when a 0 the above expression can be simplified noting lim a 0 eat 1 a t 48 we find t t t 1 and 1 t 1 t 1 49 which lead to g z t 1 1 t tz r 50 and pn t n r 1 n 1 t 1 r t t 1 n 51 the mean and variance can be computed from the distribution function obtained above but we already know the expression for the mean ibdi t from 23 which can be also found from the formula of the nb r q i e e ibdi t r t 1 t eat 1 52 which certainly agrees with 23 similarly the variance can be found from the formula of nb r q as 2 bdi t r t 1 t 2 eat eat 1 a 2 53 the reason why this simple innocent looking equation is put in a box is because this expression for the variance is perhaps the most important feature behind the erratic behavior we observe in the covid 19 or an infectious disease in general as we analyze below and demonstrate by presenting simulation results in part ii copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 13 4 2 the process i t with an arbitrary initial condition up to now we have focused on the case when the system is initially empty in this section we wish to study a general case where i 0 i 0 is an arbitrary non negative integer the pgf solution for this general case is in fact given in a 19 of appendix a in this section we will add to the pgf and pmf of this general case a subscript or superscript bdi i 0 wherever we need to distinguish similar functions of other processes so we can write gbdi i 0 z t gbdi i 0 0 z t gbd i 0 z t 54 where gbdi i 0 0 z t a eat eat 1 z r 55 gbd i 0 z t eat eat z eat eat 1 z i 0 56 where the first given by 55 is the same as 44 discussed in a preceding section whereas the second one 56 is the pgf of the birth and death process obtained by setting 0 in the pgf a 19 thus we see that the bdi i 0 process can be expressed as a sum of two statistically independent processes ibdi i 0 t ibdi i 0 0 t ibd i 0 z t 57 it can be further shown that the the birth and death process can be decomposed into two processes the the pure birth process and a generalized binomial distributed process denoted igb p t t where p t is given by 87 thus ibd i 0 t inb i 0 t t igb i 0 t 58 and the pgfs of these processes can be expressed as gbd i 0 z t gnb i 0 t z t ggb i 0 z t 59 where gnb i 0 t z t 1 b t 1 b t z i 0 60 ggb p t z t 1 p t p z z i

its pmf 39 and pgf 41 its mean and variance are given in 42 the mode of the this distribution is given by modexnb b q r 1 1 q c if r 1 0 if r 1 62 recall that the parameter r in our problem is the ratio of person unit time the rate with which an infected person arrives in the community in question to person unit time person the rate with which an copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 14 infectious person infects susceptible people as long as tight security measures are enforced at the boundaries of the community is kept small thus in our problem of practical interest r 1 or even r 1 figure 6 shows the shifted negative binomial distribution nbd for p 1 q 0 5 and for various values of r 0 5 1 2 4 8 16 32 as we can see in figure 6 the pmf with r 0 5 falls off rapidly by around n 5 for q 0 5 and r 0 5 we compute the first several values of pn p 0 0 7071 p 1 0 5303 p 2 0 3315 p 3 0 1934 p 4 0 1088 p 5 0 0598 p 10 0 00256 63 in order to see more clearly how the pmf pn looks for small r let us rewrite 39 as follows pn k r n 1 r n 1 n 2 r n 2 2 r 2 1 r 1 qn n where k r rpr 64 the leading term k r does not depend on n so we can write pn n 1 r n 1 n 2 r n 2 2 r 2 1 r 1 qn n 65 in the limit r 0 the shape of pn will become pn qn n 66 recall the following maclaurin series expansion ln 1 q q q 2 2 q 3 3 67 from which we obtain n 1 1 ln 1 q qn n 1 68 thus we find 66 can be written as pn 1 ln 1 q qn n n 1 2 3 69 this distribution is called the logarithmic distribution a k a logarithmic series distribution which was introduced by r a fisher in 1943 25 the pgf of 69 is given using 67 once again by glog z ln 1 qz ln 1 q 70 in our case the probability q is given by t of 45 q t eat 1 eat where a 71 thus for sufficiently large t the parameter q is very close to one thus the term qn is a slowly decreasing geometric series for small r the coefficient is also slowly decaying thus for small r and q close to 1 the nbd is a very slowly decaying distribution having a long tail similar to zipf s law or the zeta distribution with small power exponent see e g 15 pp 62 64 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 15 example 2 consider the same set of model parameters used in example 1 i e 0 3 0 1 and 0 2 then r 2 3 and a 0 2 in figure 7 through figure 12 we show the pmf pn t 47 of the infected population i t at t 1 5 10 20 30 and 50 in all these cases i 0 0 i e there are no infected individuals at t 0 one useful method to see clearly the tail end of the distribution function is to plot the log survival function log 10 1 fn where fn is the cumulative distribution function cdf i e fn n i 0 pn t and its complement 1 fn is called the survival or survivor function 15 in figure 13 and figure 14 we show the log survivor functions of the distribution of i t at t 10 and t 30 we confirm our earlier observation that the nbd behaves similar to a geometric distribution which is a straight line in the log survivor plot as we observed in example 5 1 the pmf pn t looks similar to a slowly decaying geometric distribution for modest values of t with a long tail which gives a large variance an often used measure of dispersion is the coefficient of variation cv from 53 we can derive the following expression 2 bdi t i 2 t eat eat 1 i 2 t r t 72 from which we find the cv at time t of the bdi process is given by cbdi t bdi t i t 1 r t 73 it is evident that t quickly approaches unity from below as t increases 16 t 1 for t 1 and lim t t 1 74 thus we have arrive at the following proposition regarding the cv of the bdi process proposition 1 the coefficient of variation of the bdi process rapidly converges to a constant r 1 for all t such that t 7 lim t cbdi t r 1 where r 75 example 3 consider the environment considered in example 3 2 i e 0 2 day 0 3 day infectious person 0 1 day infectious person thus r 0 mu 3 a 0 2 and r 2 3 hence r 1 1 225 the mean variance and the standard deviation of i t on the days t 30 and 50 are i 0 0 var i 0 0 i 0 0 ci 0 undefined i 30 402 5 var n 30 243 411 9 n 30 493 4 cn 30 1 226 i 50 22 025 5 var n 50 727 706 000 9 n 50 26 976 0 cn 50 1 225 so we have confirmed that the coefficient of variation is bounded from below by r 1 1 225 15 the term survival or survivor function is often used in reliability theory if a continuous variable x represent the life of a human or a product e g electric bulb with its probability density function pdf fx x and cumulative distribution function cdf fx x t 0 fx s ds the survival function is defined by 1 fx x by plotting log 1 fx x vs x we find more clearly how the remaining life will behave than a regular plot of fx x or fx x see e g 15 pp 144 146 16 when t is such at 7 for instance will make t within around 2 off from the unity in our example of a 0 2 day t 23 days will make t practically equal to unity copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 16 5 2 relation between the nbd and generalized binomial distributions in the previous section we gave a formal definition of the generalized negative binomial distribution by allowing the parameter r to be a positive real number we now want to generalize the binomial distribution b n p by allowing n to be a real number positive or negative and p be any real number positive or negative thus we cannot assign any probabilistic interpretation definition 3 consider a generating function of z which takes the form for real numbers p and g z 1 p p z 76 then its inverse transform fn n pn 1 p n n 0 1 2 77 is called a generalized binomial distribution denoted gb n p there is no guarantee that each fn non negative let alone 0 fn 1 however they add up to unity because g 1 1 the main reason why we wish to generalize the binomial distribution is for the convenience of computing pn t for the bdi process and other birth and death processes without immigration discussed proposition 2 a generalized binomial distribution associated with a generalized negative binomial dis tribution for a given generalized negative binomial distribution whose pgf is given by gnb z 1 q 1 qz r 78 with the pmf pnbn r n 1 n 1 q rqn n 0 1 2 79 its associated generalized binomial distribution is given by fn r n pn 1 p r n 80 where p and q satisfy the relation 1 p 1 q 1 or p q 1 q 81 proof first we compare the generalized binomial coefficients r n r r 1 r n 2 r n 1 n r n 1 r n 2 r 1 r 1 n n 1 n r n 1 n 82 we also find pn 1 p r n q 1 q n 1 q r n 1 nqn 1 q r 83 thus we have shown the equivalence between 79 and 80 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 17 an alternative way to prove this equivalence is to write the pgf 78 using p defined by 81 1 q 1 qz r 1 p p z r 84 recall newton s generalized binomial formula 1 t a 1 a 1 t a 2 t 2 j 0 a j tj 85 apply this formula to the rhs of 84 by setting a r and t pz 1 p the coefficient of the z n term is given by fn of 77 now let us revisit the pgf 44 which we can write as g z t 1 p t p t z r 86 where p t eat a 87 by referring to proposition 2 we find that p t and t are related by p t t 1 t 88 thus by applying newton s formula we can obtain the following expression for pn t pn t r n 1 p t np t r n n 0 1 2 89 using the binomial coefficient formula and the equivalence 83 i e pn 1 p r n 1 n n 1 r 90 we see that pn t given by 89 is equivalent to 47 5 3 the nbd as a compound poisson distribution in this section we will investigate how to represent the bdi process ibdi t as a compound poisson process the negative binomial distribution is infinitely divisible see e g feller 9 and hence can be represented as a compound poisson process first we show this representation by considering a special case of the bdi process where no death occurs 5 3 1 birth and immigration bi process let us consider a process which has not been discussed to the best of our knowledge in the literature that is the pure birth process accompanied by immigration let us call this process a birth and immigration process a bi process for short the pgf of this process can be readily found by setting 0 in a 19 and after some manipulation we obtain gbi z t 1 e t e t 1 z r z e t e t 1 z i 0 zi 0 1 0 t 1 0 t z r i 0 91 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 18 where 0 t 1 e t 92 not surprisingly this 0 t can be obtained by setting 0 in t of 45 thus the bi process ibi t is distributed according to the negative binomial distribution nb r i 0 0 t shifted by i 0 hence we find the pmf at time t as given below pbin t e r i 0 t n i 0 r 1 n i 0 1 e t n i 0 n i 0 i 0 1 i 0 2 93 if i 0 0 the pmf reduces to nb r 0 t by noting r we find the first few pmf values as follows pbi 00 t e t pbi 01 t e tr 1 e t pbi 02 t e tr r 1 2 1 e t 2 pbi 03 t e tr r 2 r 1 3 1 e t 3 where pbi 00 t represents the idle period of the system which ends upon the poisson arrival this initial idle period is the only time when the system is empty since there is no death or departure of any kind the population monotonically increases as the time elapses as we defined in definition 1 of section 3 2 a t is the cumulative count of infected and infectious persons arriving from the outside up to time t let us count them as c 1 2 a t consider a countable attribute associated with each arrival and denote it nc assume that the nc s are independent identically distributed i i d rvs kobayashi and konheim 26 discuss use of acompound process in the context of data communication system where each arrival of a data packet carries nc data units e g bytes then the sum s t a t c 1 nc 94 should be a quantity of interest in determining e g the buffer size of a statistical multiplexer needed to keep the probability of buffer overflow below some prescribed level in our problem at hand each infected arrival from the outside becomes an ancestor who produces many descendants over multiple generations who are all infected persons and constitute the members of the c clan such a process is called a branching process in our model each infected individual whether an ancestor or a descendant produces a new descendant at rate person unit time let aj t be the number of arrivals in 0 t and having j descendants at time t the case j 0 does not exist since there is no death hence each clan includes at least its ancestor such that j 1 aj t a t t 0 95 branson 27 who ascribes the original idea to karin and mcgregor 28 shows that the rvs aj t s are independent poisson variables with mean mj t where mj t e aj t j j 96 where is a function of and t copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 19 the above formula 96 leads to the idea that the probability distribution that each ancestor should produce j descendants i e secondary tertiary infectees etc whose probability distribution takes the form pr nc t j p nc j t 0 t j j j 1 97 this distribution is the logarithmic distribution of 69 the pgf of nc t is therefore given by gnc z ln 1 0 t z ln 1 0 t ln 1 1 e t z t 98 note that nc t is the number of the family members at time t of the cth clan with the ancestor itself included since we are assuming no death the sum of these numbers over all a t ancestors should be the total population i t at time t i t a t c 1 nc t 99 then the pgf of i t can be expressed as g z t e zi t e z a t c 1 nc t e e znc a t e gnc z t a t ga gnc z 100 the pgf of the poisson arrival process of rate is given by ga z t exp t z 1 101 thus we find the pgf of the bi process a compound poisson process is g z t ga gnc z exp t ln 1 0 t ln 1 0 t z 1 1 0 t 1 0 t z r where r 102 which is the pgf 91 where i 0 0 thus we have shown that the poisson process with rate ends up with the negative binomial distributed process nb r 0 t it is interesting that the infection process which forms a branching process where an infectious person infects a susceptible person at rate persons time unit will result in the negative binomial distribution the positive feedback loop of creating its descendants exhibits the negative binomial distributed process 5 3 2 birth and death with immigration bdi process as a compound poisson pro cess now we extend our argument of the previous section to the bdi process with the initial condition i 0 0 whose pgf is given by 44 g z t 1 t 1 t z r 103 where t is defined by 45 t eat 1 eat 104 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 20 the first few pmf values can be found from 47 as pbdi 00 t b t where b t 1 t r a eat r pbdi 01 t b t r t pbdi 02 t b t r r 1 2 t 2 pbdi 03 t b t r r 2 r 1 3 t 3 105 the function t is between 0 and 1 and approaches 1 as t if 0 then r 0 as well and b t 1 since b t r does not depend on n we see again the fisher series pr nc t j p nc j t t j j j 1 106 then by replacing 0 t 1 e t by t eat 1 eat the entire mathematical steps of the bi process case carry over to the case of the bdi process except for the last step 102 where the parameter r needs to be defined as r t ln eat 107 if a 0 then for t 1 the following approximation holds r t at 108 therefore it seems clear that we need to to choose a poisson process other than the one with mean t let t be the mean of the poisson process which is to be compounded with nc t whose pgf is gbdi 0 t 1 t 1 t z r 109 then it should be clear from the above discussion that t must be given by exp t eat r exp art e at r exp t e at r 110 thus t t r ln e at 111 thus we have shown that the bdi process as a compound poisson process with rate t 6 concluding remarks at the beginning of section 3 we showed the results of twelve simulation runs of the bdi process to provoke the reader s interest hopefully you have found an answer to the first question how about the second question if you are an avid reader you should have figured out the answer by now in part ii of this report copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 21 under preparation 1 we will present more simulation results which should help the reader find a definitive answer to the second question in this report we focused on the analysis of i t the infected population although we presented the stochastic means of b t the population of the secondary infections and r t the recovered dead population we defer a full analysis of these processes to part ii we will also show both by analysis and simulation how the infection process can be controlled by changing the values of and at certain points in time increasing the so called social distance would decrease the value of the value of can be increased by improving medical treatments to speed up the recovery process another possible option is to reduce the size of the susceptible population significantly by exposing the young and healthy susceptible to the disease so that they become immune to the disease the quantitative model such as ours should help policy makers and health officials to make judicious choices of these options by assessing the effects and costs of various options available to them in part ii or iii we will also discuss how we should estimate the model parameters from empirical data so that the forecast can be made as reliable as possible a derivation of pgf 46 the partial differential equation pde 15 can be solved for pgf g z t by lagrange s method with auxiliary differential equations we write 15 in the following form of a planar differential equation see e g 22 24 23 14 pp 600 603 p g t q g z r a 1 where g denotes g z t defined above and p q and r are in general functions of t z and g the solution g f t z represents a surface in the t z g space the normal vector to the surface at any point t 0 z 0 g 0 is perpendicular to the line through this point whose direction numbers are the values of p q and r evaluated at this point which we denote by p 0 q 0 and g 0 this line has the equations t t 0 p 0 z z 0 q 0 g g 0 r 0 a 2 hence at each point p q g of the surface there is a normal vector whose direction numbers dt dz and dg satisfy the following equation dt p dz q dg r a 3 in our problem at hand we set p 1 a 4 q z z 1 a 5 r z 1 g a 6 then a 3 becomes dt 1 dz z z 1 dg z t z 1 g z t a 7 which leads to the following two independent solutions z 1 z eat c 1 where a a 8 copyright c hisashi kobayashi 2020 22 and g z t z r c 2 where r a 9 where c 1 and c 2 are integration constants we write the functional relations between c 1 and c 2 as c 2 f c 1 a 10 which together with a 7 implies the following general solution g z t z r f z 1 z e t a 11 from the initial condition 17 we find g z 0 z rf z 1 z zi 0 a 12 from which we find f z 1 z zi 0 z r a 13 we introduce a new variable y by z 1 z y i e z 1 y 1 y a 14 from the last two equations we can determine the functional form of f f y 1 y 1 y i 0 1 y r a 15 by substituting the last equation into a 11 we obtain g z t z rf z 1 z eat a 16 by noting 1 y 1 z z 1 eat z z 1 eat a 17 and 1 y z z z 1 eat a 18 we finally obtain the pgf of i t g z t z r z z z 1 eat r z z 1 eat z z 1 eat i 0 z z 1 eat r z z 1 eat z z 1 eat i 0 a 19 note that the pgf is given as a product of two pgfs the second being the pgf of the birth and death process without immigration if i 0 0 i e if the system is initially empty the
