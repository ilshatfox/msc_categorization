asymmetry and non dispersivity in the aharonov bohm effect article asymmetry and non dispersivity in the aharonov bohm effect maria becker 1 giulio guzzinati 2 armand b ch 2 johan verbeeck 2 herman batelaan 3 decades ago aharonov and bohm showed that electrons are affected by electromagnetic potentials in the absence of forces due to fields zeilinger s theorem describes this absence of classical force in quantum terms as the dispersionless nature of the aharonov bohm effect shelankov predicted the presence of a quantum force for the same aharonov bohm phy sical system as elucidated by berry here we report an experiment designed to test she lankov s prediction and we provide a theoretical analysis that is intended to elucidate the relation between shelankov s prediction and zeilinger s theorem the experiment consists of the aharonov bohm physical system free electrons pass a magnetized nanorod and far field electron diffraction is observed the diffraction pattern is asymmetric confirming one of shelankov s predictions and giving indirect experimental evidence for the presence of a quantum force our theoretical analysis shows that zeilinger s theorem and shelankov s result

naturecommunications www nature com naturecommunications t he aharonov bohm ab effect 1 6 entails the presence of a phase shift caused by a magnetic flux enclosed by an electron interferometer it is thought to demonstrate the physical reality of potentials 2 3 as opposed to the earlier inter pretation that potentials were merely a mathematical tool 3 4 the reason for this change in understanding came about because the fields outside a magnetic flux tube such as provided by a perfect solenoid infinitely long and infinite winding density are zero thus eliminating the possibility of a classical lorentz force under the assumption that the solenoid is unperturbed 5 6 there is no field that can act locally on the electrons however the non zero vector potential can have a local effect that results in a phase shift notwithstanding the general acceptance of these ideas this issue remains a topic of debate on non locality 7 10 the interpreta tion 11 14 and existence of the effect 15 16 the ab effect has been observed for free electrons in a series of ever more refined experiments 17 21 as well as in conductors 22 25 the absence of a longitudinal force as made apparent by the absence of electron time delays has been investigated more recently these time delays predicted by alternative theories 5 have been ruled out 26 however deflection another indicator of force has been predicted by shelankov 27 elucidated by berry 28 and theoretically confirmed by keating and robbins 29 the deflection is accompanied by a characteristic asymmetry in the electron diffraction pattern providing an experimental signature the presence of force has been operationally defined by zei linger using the expectation value of position 30 if the expectation value differs from the value obtained for free propagation then a force is present for experiments with electron beams the pre sence of a longitudinal force along the beam would lead to time delays in the expectation value of the arrival time while a transverse force would lead to deflections zeilinger s theorem as expounded by peshkin 31 indicates that a characteristic feature of the ab effect is its dispersionless i e force free nature experimental demonstrations of the dispersionless nature of ab duals 32 including the he mckellar wilkens effect have been performed 33 while a demonstration of the dispersionless nature of the magnetic ab effect has yet to be reported 34 35 in this paper we report the observation of electron diffraction asymmetry consistent with theory to this end an electron beam is passed through a small aperture that holds a magnetized nanorod it is confirmed that reversal of the magnetization direction reverses the observed asymmetry this experimental result provides support for shelankov s theoretical prediction and thus indirectly indicates the presence of force a crucial experi ment remains necessary to directly demonstrate the electron beam deflection by measuring the expectation value the presence of force is in apparent contradiction to textbook descriptions of the ab effect we report a theorem that resolves this issue by showing the absence of classical forces and the presence of quantum forces the absence of classical forces in the longitudinal direction of the electron s motion is consistent with zeilinger s theorem and supported by experiment 26 how ever zeilinger s theorem cannot be applied to the transverse motion for the ab physical system the theorem is correct but its assumptions are not generally applicable to the physical situation considered shelankov s prediction pertains to the transverse motion of the electron for the ab physical system and is sup ported by our experimental results our deflection theorem is a generalization of peshkin s approach and when applied to the infinitesimal flux line yields shelankov s and zeilinger s results as two limiting cases additionally the deflection theorem is applied to a finite size flux tube to provide the connection to experiment results sb approach to explain the theoretical prediction consider a coherent electron beam passing by a current carrying solenoid as illustrated in fig 1 the solenoid is assumed to be ideal i e it carries no stray fields and its field is not affected by the passing beam we are interested in obtaining the far field electron dif fraction pattern specifically the expectation value of the trans verse position of the electron is used to assess whether or not a force acted during the passage of the electron by the solenoid this determination of force is studied in several steps in the first step berry s derivation 28 of shelankov s result 27 is summarized in the second step we derive a theorem that yields zeilinger s theorem 31 and shelankov s result as special limiting cases in the third step shelankov s result is used as a benchmark for a path integral simulation which allows for the simulation of detailed experimental parameters a de broglie bohm viewpoint of the physical scenario is provided in step four which serves to illus trate the term quantum force as introduced by berry and keating and robbins berry identifies the problem as two

direction for a finite solenoid size instead of an infinitely thin magnetic flux line and a shaped aperture instead of a gaussian beam can be taken into account see methods the partial blockage of the electron wave retains the oscillatory deflection predicted by shelankov and berry quantum force the quantum nature of the force can be understood in the de broglie bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics 37 the equation of motion for the electron wavepacket can be written as dp dt fclas fqu in terms of the classical force fclas dv dy and the quantum force fqu dq dy where the quantum potential is given by q 2 2 a 2 ma if the derivative of the quantum potential q with the wavepacket defined as aei is non zero then there is a local quantum force however this force which acts on individual de broglie bohm trajectories is not measurable 40 41 operationally the presence of force is defined by the presence of an average deflection there is an average deflection if the integral r q y dy is non zero the local derivative q y can be calculated for the wavepacket eq 15 in ref 28 to be non zero and finite after the electron has passed the magnetic flux line the spatial derivative in the quantum potential can not be evaluated immediately after the interaction with the solenoid because the wavefunction is given by a step function the wavefunction can be propagated for a short distance so it becomes a smooth function the quantum potential after propagating 1 of the distance from the magnetic flux line to the detection plane is shown in fig 4 if the flux line is not magnetized the quantum potential is left right symmetric peshkin zeilinger case 1 xl b y case 2 shelankov berry e kl kl 0 2 a 2 2 e y 2 b fig 3 dispersivity theorem and quantum force the ab physical

symmetry is broken leading to an average deflection in the far field diffraction pattern for different from 0 and 0 5 modulo 1 the presence of the asymmetric quantum potential supports keating and robbins 29 analysis in terms of a quantum force operator thus even in the absence of a classical force for the ab physical system a quantum force can lead to a non zero average deflection finally it is interesting to note that an array of flux lines creates a ladder of phase steps and provides a classical like force 42 in a sense this provides a middle ground between a single phase step quantum force and phase slope classical force experimental asymmetry observed to experimentally verify the predicted probability asymmetry about y 0 we used a transmission electron microscope tem as a versatile electron optical bench tool for quantum experiments a thin and long ferromagnetic rod was used to create a well defined magnetic flux line see methods this setup was already successfully applied for mapping specific plasmon modes in nanodevices 43 a collimated and unfocussed electron beam uniformly illuminates the 5 m aperture that holds the magnetic nanorod fig 5 the nanorod is 30 m long 450 nm wide 1 m thick and supports a 65 nm layer of nickel the 1 m thickness is sufficient to completely block the electron wave a typical far field intensity profile of the ferromagnetic nickel rod is displayed in fig 6 revealing the asymmetric behavior as predicted by shelankov it is also in qualitative agreement with the calculations in fig 2 in order to demagnetize the nanorod in situ we exposed the rod to a high intensity electron beam for several hours which led to damage in the nickel film and the loss of its magnetic properties as the demagnetization occurs in a fairly abrupt fashion it was not possible to scan through a series of varying magnetizations and the far field patterns were recorded only for the fully magnetized and demagnetized rods the far field profile resulting from a demagnetized rod is also displayed in fig 6 for comparison revealing a single symmetric electron diffraction peak as expected the results of path integral simulations with magnetic flux line strengths of 0 39 and 0 02 show good agreement with the experimental results fig 6 thick black curves the counts at each data point are measured with a relative error below 0 005 and are smaller than the data marker size an inclusive range of values is provided to illustrate that there is agreement with the expected values of 0 41 the value experimentally measured by electron holography and 0 00 see fig 6 caption the nanorod which lies in the y z plane and the diffraction pattern are aligned to within two degrees in the simulation the agreement was improved by including partial spatial coherence which is common in electron microscopy and depends in a sensitive way on the exact setup of the microscope in particular the slight positive value in the dip region of the experimental profile is mostly due to partial coherence with an additional small contribution due to the modulation transfer function of the camera the average relative y position of the diffraction pattern with and without magnetization cannot be used to establish the presence of a deflection as this average position shifts between measurements the demagnetization and 20 20 1 80 1013 3 00 1012 q

magnetized measurements and necessary readjustment of the electron beam causes small position shifts in the far field diffraction pattern this shift is larger than the predicted deflection which prevents the direct observation of deflection hence we report only the presence of an asymmetric intensity profile a future experiment that establishes a non zero deflection remains highly desirable as a verification of symmetry reversal we placed the nanorod in the image plane of the electron miscroscope where the vicinity of a magnetic lens could be used to flip the magnetization to that end the nanorod was rotationally aligned and anti aligned in situ and the magnetic field of the lens was ramped up to a high value the electron energy was set at 300 kev the accumulated phaseshift is energy independent and the diffraction pattern for both the 60 kev and the 300 kev data is recorded in the far field the result is that the symmetry changes sign with the direction of magnetization inset fig 7 additionally the magnetized rod was gradually heated in increments of 10 c the resulting reduction in magnetization leads to diffraction symmetry reversals the last two diffraction pattern reversals and the diffraction above the curie temperature when the nanorod is demagnetized are shown in fig 7 together with the path integral simulation the phase step size for the nanorod was estimated from experimental holographic phase maps to be 0 58 0 29 and 1 32 0 66 in the simulation the position of the diffraction pattern its height and the amount of incoherence was fitted role of fringing fields fringing fields have been considered a confounding factor in ab type experiments and could in prin ciple lead to distortions of the electron diffraction pattern in our experiment the fringing fields for our nanorod have been ana lyzed in an earlier paper 43 the finite length of the nanorod causes the presence of fringe fields at the hole through which the electrons pass and determines its strength the longer the rod the lower the fields thus the nanorod length is by design much longer than the hole diameter in order to minimise the strength of the fringing field in these conditions it would be a coincidence if the weak fringing fields at the hole that emanate from the ends of the nanowire see fig 8 a would yield the asymmetry predicted by shelankov and berry it is interesting to compare our setup to the first experimental report of the ab effect by chambers there were confounding fringing fields but the experiment nevertheless demonstrated the ab effect similarly our report is a confirma tion of shelankov s prediction a computation of the magnetic field given by a finite continuous solenoid scaled to the properties of our nanorod 30 m long 0 41 was also performed we used this field to compute the ab phase shift for an electron plane wave the phase variation across half the 5 m aperture is found to be no more than 0 05 rad approximating this as a constant phase gradient we estimate the deflection due to magnetic fringing fields 5 e 8 rad as the equivalent length of our setup is about 200 m this would cause a deflection of about 10 m our diffraction pattern s characteristic size considered to be the distance between the two intensity maxima is 373 m the deflection due to this fringe field is thus relatively small and does not appreciably affect the shape of our diffraction pattern the shape of the diffraction pattern could be affected by second and higher order phase shifts for example a quadratic phase shift but these effects are much smaller and thus we can conclude that the shape of the diffraction pattern is dominantly given by the phase step and not by fringing magnetic fields an experimental 50 25 0 25 50 0 00

rod and hole is shown discussion in summary an element of shelankov s theoretical prediction is confirmed experimentally a path integral simulation gives good agreement with the experiment and provides the connection between the prediction and experimental result this gives indirect experimental support for the presence of a quantum force in the ab effect theoretically it is shown that even though zeilinger s dis persivity theorem is valid for electron propagation in the long itudinal direction it should not be applied to the transverse direction and the usual statement that the ab effect is not accompanied by forces is not valid a theorem is found eq 5 for which zeilinger s theorem and shelankov s result are limiting cases classical forces are not needed to explain the observed effect on the electron under the assumption that the passing electron does not affect the solenoid the observed phenomenon remains a pure quantum effect the observation supports ahar onov and rohrlich s interpretation that non local potentials explain the observed phenomenon within a theory that only permits gauge invariant quantities 48 the observation does not exclude forces on the nanorod and thus does not exclude the possibility of boyer s or vaidman s descriptions involving force on the flux tube 7 11 identification of the momentum terms of the complete system consisting of the flux tube and electron including hidden momentum 48 49 may need to be considered in view of the now established presence of a quantum force 12 even if the experiment detects the presence of a magnetic flux line it does not offer an approach to search for magnetic monopoles through the detection of dirac strings which are themselves examples of magnetic flux lines as the force is pre dicted to be zero when the phase shift 2 has a value of modulo eq 12 this further highlights the quantum nature of the force we speculate that the sb force may lead to a new detection mode or architecture for squid magnetometry 50 as its coun terpart the longitudinal ab effect underlies the function of squids methods interaction range the interaction is assumed to be approximately instantaneous the purpose of this section is to justify this approximation the physical system studied is the aharonov bohm one which for a flux line gives a vector potential that is approximated by a r 12 r b where b is the magnetic flux carried by the flux line integrating over a closed circular particle path that contains the flux line gives the well known aharonov bohm phase ab e h h a dl e h b alter natively one can integrate over a closed path that consists of two parallel straight line paths passing on both sides of the flux line and connecting far away from the flux line the closed loop integral is independent of the loop chosen which implies that a single straight path phase shift is given by e h r 1 1 a dl ab 2 this phase is also independent of distance to the flux line and changes sign for path on the

dimeter away from the flux line paths closer to the flux line have a phase shift closer to ab 2 the effect of this phase gradient of d gives an approximate deflection angle of db 2 d 2 10 12 rad where

true for all the cases studied here and implies that high momentum components of the wavepacket are not affected by the interaction the final result is the deflection theorem expressed in eq 5 extension to finite size flux region the phase step result discussed in the dispersionless and quantum forces section was done for the theoretical con struct of a flux line the analysis can be extended to the case when the magnetic flux provided by the magnetic rod is present in a finite region or a flux tube this is relevant as the experiment is performed for a flux tube the analysis is done in two ways the first is an extension of shelankov s approach in momentum space the second is by path integration in position space in the first approach the starting point is eq 3 for the interaction described by a phase step the wave function for a finite magnetic rod size d is given by d kt 0 1 ffiffiffiffi 2 p r d 2 1 e i e y 2 2 2 e iktydy 1 ffiffiffiffi 2 p r 1 d 2 e i e y 2 2 2 e

of the average deflection with the deflection equation eq 5 using as input the wavefunction eq 19 as a function of d is given in fig 9 dashed blue line the initial distribution is gaussian the same as used by shelankov and berry the path integral for the same initial distribution is given by the solid black line path integral data points were calculated for 100 nm intervals and connected with straight lines as a guide for the eye the result is given for 1 4 when the deflection is largest as before the deflection oscillates with the value of the agreement between the analytic extension and the path integral result is good to simulate the experiment an initial tophat distribution that is uniform over the opening of the aperture is chosen the qualitative behavior is the same as for the

com naturecommunications initial gaussian distribution the size of the magnetic rod used in the experiment is labeled with dexp the typical range over which the deflection becomes small is 1 m the average expectation value was calculated by integrating in the far field over a 400 m wide detection area this expectation value slowly converges with detection size while the typical range reduces with the detection size to illustrate the magnitude of the effect for d 0 the deflection eq 16 in ref 28 can be written by performing the substitution w w 0 k where k 2 db is the wavenumber and w 0 is now the waist measured in si units note that eq 16 is given in units of debroglie wavelengths see bottom page 5628 of ref 28 that means that the deflection angle d is of the order d 1 w db 2 w 0 the order of magnitude estimate is done using the following numbers w 0 5 10 6 m w 5 10 6 2 3 10 12 107 and thus d 10 7 m our electron microscope camera length is about one hundred meters which gives a deflection on the detection screen of 10 5 m note that this value is smaller than the diffraction pattern pixel size but of the same order of magnitude path integral calculation in the path integral approach the final wavepacket f y t at the detector plane is given by 36 37 f y t z n exp i l db i y 0 dy 20 where the initial wavepacket is i y 0 n is a normalization factor and db h p is the de broglie wavelength of the electron the length of an individual path from some point y in the interaction plane parallel to y z located at the solenoid toy in the detection plane is l d 2 y y 2 1 2 where d is the distance between the interaction and detection planes note the absence of a factor of two in eq 20 in the phase factor 37 as compared to constructing the matter wave using huygens principle by analogy to optics 38 39 sample fabrication and electron microscopy a thin film 65 nm of nickel protected by a gold layer 1 m was milled using a focused ion beam fib microscope to obtain a 30 1 1 m 3 ferromagnetic rod the rod was then deposited with a nano manipulator over a 5 m aperture drilled in a sin grid covered with a 1 m thick layer of gold fig 4 the rod width was then thinned down to 450 50 nm this gave an estimated magnetic flux line strength of 0 41 the magnetic flux was experimentally assessed using off axis electron holo graphy a reference electron wave was superposed with the wave interacting with the flux line the large aspect ratio between the length and width of the rod allowed for a good approximation of the rod as a single magnetic domain magnetized along its long axis a detailed description of such an aperture has been given in other work 43 the aperture with the ferromagnetic rod was inserted in the condenser plane of an fei titan 3 microscope operating at 60 kv objective and projector lenses were used to image either the magnetic rod or the far field diffraction plane as illustrated in fig 5 for the 300 kv experiment the microscope was operated in lorentz mode objective lens off this allowed us to maintain sufficient beam coherence over the aperture at first the sample was mounted in a rotation tilt tomography holder in order to magnetize the magnetic rod in two opposite directions indeed we purposely turned on the magnetic field of the objective lens to 11 5 of its maximal strength 200 mt to force the rod magnetization in one or the other direction along the rod axis the rod was rotated and the holder tilted 78 in order to be as parallel as possible to the objective length field before turning it on to magnetize the rod in the order direction the holder was tilted 78 before applying the field secondly the aperture was mounted on a heating holder so that the rod could be heated in situ data availability data available on request
