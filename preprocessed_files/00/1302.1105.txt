minneapolis mn 55455 usa odlyzko umn edu http www dtc umn edu odlyzko preliminary version february 4 2013 abstract discussions of the economics of scholarly communication are usually devoted to open access rising journal prices publisher profits and boycotts that ignores what seems a much more important development in this market publishers through the oft reviled big deal packages are providing much greater and more egalitarian access to the journal literature an approximation to true open access in the process they are also marginalizing libraries and obtaining a greater share of the resources going into scholarly communication this is enabling a continuation of publisher profits as well as of what for decades has been called unsustainable journal price escalation it is also inhibiting the spread of open access and potentially leading to an oligopoly of publishers controlling distribution through large scale licensing the big deal practices are worth studying for several general reasons the degree to which publishers succeed in diminishing the role of libraries may be an indicator of the degree and speed at which universities transform themselves more importantly these big deals appear to point the way to the future of the whole economy where progress is characterized by declining privacy increasing price discrimination increasing opaqueness in pricing increasing reliance on low paid or upaid work of others for profits and business models that depend on customer inertia 1 introduction concerns about libraries not being able to afford rapidly escalating journal costs go back many decades over the last 15 to 20 years they have intensified this was partially because the cost pressures have become more burdensome perhaps even more important has been the arrival of the internet as well as of computerized typesetting and other modern electronic tools these have offered the possibility of much less expensive methods of scholarly publishing as one result there has been an increased push for various forms of open access which is also being advocated for other reasons in order to make information more widely available there have also been calls for scholars to stop collaborating with the expensive commercial publishers by refusing to submit their papers to them as well http arxiv org abs 1302 1105 v 1 2 andrew odlyzko as to referee submissions or edit journals the most recent prominent call of this nature was initiated by tim gowers in early 2012 and as of this writing has attracted over 13 000 signers 19 protesters such as those who endorse the boycott 19 tend to cite the high profits of commercial publishers most commonly of elsevier the largest one as injurious to scholarly communication and unjust being based on donated labor of academics they also often complain about the big deals that large publishers again with elsevier in the forefront force libraries into cf 4 11 in these contracts which are universally shrouded in secrecy although an interesting project is revealing some of the details 12 libraries are forced to accept multi year commitments with steady price escalation and little flexibility in selecting what journals they get this has all the obvious disadvantages for libraries and the academic community however such discussions almost universally ignore the positive effects of the big deals as well as the degree to which those positive effects are key to the main action in scholarly publishing namely the competition between libraries and publishers 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 1 0 0 year se ri a ls r e ce iv e d th o u sa n d s serials in research libraries median 1 st quartile 3 rd quartile fig 1 number of serials available in research libraries from 1990 to 2010 shows the median as well as the first and third quartiles of the number of serials received by academic members of arl the main contribution of this paper is an investigation of the effects of the reviled big deals on access to scholarly journals in spite of their low reputation over the last decade they have produced a remarkable increase in availability of serials this is shown in fig 1 and is discussed in more detail in section 4 the data for the analysis is taken from the careful and detailed statistics for the 115 academic members of the association of research libraries arl 9 those members include almost all large university libraries in the u s and canada for more about arl its statistics and the selection of data see section 5 scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 3 the median of the number of serials received by arl members almost quadrupled during the period under investigation going from 21 187 in the 1989 1990 academic year to 80 292 in the 2009 2010 one practically the entire increase took place during the last half a dozen years without any big changes in funding patterns and appears to be due primarily to big deals members of arl are all large libraries but with substantial variation in the 2009 2010 academic year their budgets as defined by arl ranged from 8 3 to 111 6 million with a median of 22 8 million thus improved access to journals for just these institutions still leaves out in the cold the general public as well as students and researchers at many hundreds of other higher education institutions in north america as well as potential readers in other countries it should be noted though that many of those institutions do appear to be benefiting from big deals and other arrangements it s just that this study is limited to arl members by the nature of the data that is was available it also ignores wider issues of access to other types of information cf 49 still these 115 institutions do contain a very substantial fraction of both authors of scholarly journal papers as well as of readers thus it is of interest to see what the recent trends have meant for them especially since there are analogies and implications for the wider economy fig 1 demonstrates not only that the average number of serials available in arl li braries has grown but that gaps between the large and small libraries have decreased this is shown in more detail in section 4 especially in fig 2 section 5 proves that this occurred without any dramatic changes in either relative or absolute spending on serials this so cially positive development is the outcome of the growth in price discrimination the selling of the same product or service at prices varying depending on customer as an example in 2007 unlimited access to the entire collection of journals published by elsevier cost the university of michigan 1 961 938 75 while the university of montana paid 442 224 78 such practices are increasingly common although usually carefully hidden from view un covering this degree of differential pricing required considerable effort by ted bergstrom and his collaborators including fighting a lawsuit from elsevier 12 hence the spread of big deals provides interesting perspectives on the development of the modern economy a topic pursued in the final sections of this paper before considering that wide subject let us return to the scholarly journal crisis can commercial publishers continue to prosper financial analysts are divided a team from exane paribas in paris declared as cited in 67 that the boycott initiated by gow ers 19 was effectively a tempest in a teacup and that sales of elsevier shares by investors foolish enough to be scared offered a trading opportunity on the other hand claudio aspesi and his colleagues at bernstein research in london have been bearish on the com mercial stm science technology and medicine publishing sector for several years cf 5 6 and other reports and decided the recent events were foretelling serious trouble 7 the bearish views on elsevier are based largely on the estimate that the big deals are becoming unaffordably expensive and will soon start breaking down that might happen however the complaints about unaffordable journals go back many decades yet they somehow have been afforded to understand how this was possible one needs to take a larger view of the economics of scholarly communication the high profits earned by 4 andrew odlyzko commercial publishers as well as by many non profit professional societies are one of the lesser inefficiencies in that system those profits are just a fraction of the actual and now unnecessary real costs of the current scholarly journals and those real publishing costs are much smaller than the now unnecessary real costs of the library system publishers have managed to continue with their unaffordable journal price increases by squeezing some of that inefficiency out of the libraries and there is a lot more to be squeezed discussions of the economics of scholarly publication almost uniformly ignore the dom inant economic factor in that area namely that most of the cost is inside libraries 1 and that technology is making feasible and desirable the dramatic downsizing of traditional functions not just of publishers but also of libraries 56 62 those costs in turn are dwarfed by the costs to authors editors and referees cf section 2 but those costs do not involve any money transfers and are not accounted for as a prime example while librarians increasingly take on new roles handling the huge volumes of books and bound serials is still a large part of the cost of library systems yet at a rough estimate 90 of the books and 99 of the journals in a typical large academic library can should and will be sent to inexpensive off site warehouses with usage shifting to electronic copies that will free up space and eliminate many of the jobs in the system the key role of high internal library costs in academic information systems is probably ignored because of a general reluctance to face unpleasant facts 2 libraries are central to the image of modern universities the repositories of knowledge and wisdom they are unifying institutions serving everybody on campus and often in the community at large their buildings are usually centrally located and among the most imposing around and they are staffed by the helpful librarians perhaps the best loved group on campus the notion of laying off those friendly librarian colleagues and closing down library facilities in order to sustain the profits of elsevier is repugnant but that is what we are facing furthermore sending physical collections to inexpensive off site warehouses closing down physical library facilities and limiting hours of operation of remaining ones all of which has been taking place to only a limited extent so far is not only inevitable but desirable online access is more effective and is bound to dominate to an increasing extent such a transformation has already taken place 5 to an even greater extent in corporations which have largely eliminated their libraries but do pay for access to commercial databases including those that contain scholarly materials arl statistics summarized in section 5 show that while library budgets have grown much faster than general inflation they have shrunk compared to university budgets at the same time the fraction of library costs that are devoted to purchases of books journals and databases has grown over the last two decades from about a quarter to about a third if we consider the full costs of library systems this indicates that libraries are becoming less important to universities while publishers have roughly maintained their position by wresting more of the resources from the libraries there has also been growth in spending on other scholarly communication services outside the library publisher area that are not captured in the arl statistics among recent moves towards mandated open access in britain the finch report and the rcuk open access policy have been criticized by many open access advocates for scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 5 tilting towards publishers through an embrace of gold open access in which publishers are paid to make the articles in their journals publicly available this is seen as poten tially imposing crippling additional costs on researchers however although this was not mentioned explicitly in those reports a very obvious move might be to recover those extra costs not from research funds but from library budgets and force cutbacks in traditional library functions thus while aspesi et al 8 have seen these recommendations as a threat to publishers it may actually mean another victory in their competition with libraries open access is not the same as low cost publishing the two can be treated as orthog onal aspects of scholarly communication however the low costs made possibly by modern technology make a break with traditional high cost subscription publishing models far more feasible andy grove the famous former ceo of intel argued that a 10 fold change in cost or capability of a technology requires fundamental rethinking of the basic business model electronics does offer the possibility of a 10 fold decrease of basic journal publishing costs as one example it is argued later in this paper that just the money that the arl libraries alone spend on acquisition of serials would in principle suffice to fund an adequate open access publication support for all the scholarly journals in the world when i first embarked on studies of electronic publishing almost two decades ago i concluded that open access was not just desirable but also inevitable it has manifold advantages for society as a whole and for scholars however the inertia of librarians and scholars has kept them from taking advantage of the opportunities offered by modern technologies on the other hand publishers have moved faster and it now appears that subscription journals may survive for a long time together with their associated unneces sarily high costs and unnecessarily high profits the evolution of scholarly publishing including the changing roles of libraries and publishers is of interest as a bellwether of change in academia in general two decades ago the arrival of the internet and other electronic technologies led to prophesies that universities were doomed 55 instead as was easy to predict 61 they blossomed see section 6 for some statistics today a new wave of disruptive innovation is threatening the traditional academic model with a proliferation of for profit educational institutions as well as free massive online courses being cited as just the start of massive changes chances are that as was argued in 61 there will be far less of a collapse than is promised or threatened and that the new techniques will be more of an addition than a replacement for traditional approaches education just like medicine is a growth business in a world that depends increasingly on training and expert knowledge hence this sector as a whole is not likely to shrink however change is likely in particular some of the trends in research that doomed old style industrial research labs 57 are now showing up in universities a natural development might lead to the abolition of traditional departments for example it will be interesting therefore to see the degree to which universities are willing or are forced to outsource their library functions to google and publishers that might that serve as an indication of how likely more disruptive moves are to occur in academia more generally the evolution of scholarly publishing provides interesting insights into the evolution of commerce in general the availability of the comprehensive and reliable arl statistics enables us to obtain quantitative measures of some phenomena that are 6 andrew odlyzko usually hidden from view one of the most important and interesting of these phenomena is the growth in price discrimination as in the university of michigan paying 2 million for something that the university of montana obtains for 440 thousand as was easy to predict a long time ago differential pricing is the driver behind the systematic destruction of privacy this is finally beginning to be slowly reflected in press coverage cf 15 25 for the most part though it is studiously avoided both in scholarly venues such as the call for papers in the conference 29 and in most newspaper articles which cite arguments that data sharing rules should not be so tough as to hinder or undermine the ability of companies to innovate without explaining what kind of innovation is meant 76 the reason this topic is so studiously avoided is likely because it is even less pleasant to think about than downsizing libraries in order to preserve elsevier s profits the logic of growing price discrimination leads to visions of a dystopian future 42 where many of the basic assumptions about the economy no longer apply scholarly publishing provides useful insights into why differential pricing is spreading why it is spreading so slowly and surreptitiously and why its spread is hard to resist scholarly publishing also illustrates some other developments in the modern economy the ability of consumers to find information and hunt for the best deals is justly cel ebrated 14 24 and has done much to improve the efficiency of the economy but this development is accompanied by countervailing tendencies such as greater opaquenes in other areas of the economy as was evidenced by all the toxic financial instruments that facilitated the bubble that led to the crash of 2008 in journal pricing we also observe greater opacity with list prices being essentially meaningless and real prices hidden be hind non disclosure clauses in sales contracts some of the phenomena that scholars object to such as publishers making profits out of the unpaid labor of authors editors and referees are of ancient standing and are now being replicated far more widely elsewhere in the economy many of the most successful tech companies of the modern era such as facebook and google derive their value from the unpaid labor of their users thus what is claimed to have been a possibly passing anomaly in scholarly publishing is actually becoming a central feature of the modern economy the core of this paper is section 4 which explores the effect of big deals on access to scholarly information among arl members first though a general overview of scholarly journal cost structure and of the perils of technological and market prognostication is presented in section 2 then there is discussion of the value of quantity and quality in section 3 since many scholars dismiss concerns about publishing by claiming that all that is needed is a tightening of standards in order to eliminate any crisis then comes section 4 as mentioned above it is followed by section 5 which describes the data sources that are used and their limitations section 6 has a deeper look into the budgets and relative roles of universities publishers and libraries section 7 summarizes the arguments that scholarly journal publishing can be carried on at a far lower cost than it is at present section 8 delves into the competition between libraries and publishers and what their best courses of action for the future are section 9 is the first of several sections on the development of the entire economy and how it relates to what we see in scholarly publishing there is discussion of growing opaqueness of the development of a tom sawyer trends as in scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 7 tom sawyer getting boys in his neighborhood to pay him for the privilege of doing tom s chores and of growing price discrimination finally section 12 has the conclusions 2 open access academic publishing and academic inertia i first became seriously involved in investigating scholarly publishing two decades ago and concluded that some form of open access as well as new lower cost publishing models were desirable and inevitable 56 although i still feel they are desirable it now appears far more questionable whether they are inevitable at least in the form envisaged the posting of preprints while still not universal is spreading and the arguments for it are even stronger than before however the high cost journals are still surviving and may continue to do so this paper is not about open access rather it is about what is actually happening in the rest of scholarly publishing and why instead of pure open access we might instead end up with something that might have a similar effect in particular we might have various institutions paying subscription fees to high cost publishers to provide access to wide classes of readers potentially entire nations thus practically nothing will be said about the extensive literature on open access on green versus gold models and the like just a few references to that area are peter suber s blog and 13 34 35 38 39 53 54 78 81 there is rapid growth in open access as shown by some of these papers by the directory of open access journals maintained at lund university and by other sources the question is is it fast enough to prevent publishers from entrenching their high cost journal model thus for example in mathematics arxiv receives about 25 000 submissions per year but that is still only about one quarter of all mathematics papers that mathematical reviews processes each year the growth rate in arxiv submissions is around 15 per year a rate that is far faster than the approximately 3 per year growth in the number of articles and not dissimilar to other growth rates observed in other aspects of open access however that growth is not as fast as what can be seen in fig 1 over the last few years for increase in access to serials at arl libraries while there is no space in this paper for a complete review of the scholarly literature it will be handy to build the presentation and analysis around my own earlier analyses and predictions for this subject which provide useful background information on some of these issues the first paper 56 estimated that a typical article cost about 20 000 in author s time and 4 000 in time of reviewers both costs that don t show up in any budgets but do reflect the effor devoted to scholarly publications by unpaid experts it also estimated publisher revenues per article of about 4 000 and internal library costs of about twice that it also estimated that 300 1 000 per paper would suffice for very good quality in an online only environment and that costs of digitizing old materials would be low see also 59 all those estimates still appear reasonable and even lower costs have actually been demonstrated as is discussed in section 7 these estimates were then used to argue for a shift to new low cost and open access journals while the conclusions and predictions of 56 did reflect a realization of how much of an obstacle the inertia of the academic system posed the main failure of that paper was in underestimating that inertia an explanation even if not an adequate excuse for this 8 andrew odlyzko was that the paper was written at an industrial research lab so with an inadequate ap preciation of how slowly everything changes in universities i forecast in that paper that the high cost journal system would not change materially for a decade but would likely collapse within two decades had i had my current experience as a professor and univer sity administrator i would likely have doubled both estimates as has been noted many times scholarly behavior is profoundly conservative where communication is concerned and that if anything younger members of a discipline are even more conservative than their elders who are better established 47 the growth in novel forms of peer review has been extremely slow even the high energy theoretical physicists the first field to em brace the predecessor of arxiv and to submit virtually all their preprints there continue to publish most of their papers in conventional journals a particularly telling observation is that even stevan harnad that indefatigable advocate for open access has scaled back his effort in this area in frustration subsequent studies of rates of diffusion of technologies found that while new forms of communication were often embraced rapidly by scholars 63 that was not the case with the basic journal publications which were often deeply embedded into the sociology of their fields and so on their own would likely take generations to evolve substantially the only way to speed up the process was to have forcing agents who can compel change 60 in this area i expected university administrators to take the lead however with a few exceptions they have been slow to act or lead either from ignorance or pusillanimity or perhaps from a deeper understanding of how fast academia can move as a result open access mandates have been coming primarily from funding agencies and relatively slowly the high internal costs of libraries compared to the purchase cost of serials was an obviously important factor 56 62 further consideration of the entire scholarly communi cation system in which publishers and librarians were the intermediaries between scholar authors and scholar readers led to the prediction that there would be an intensifying con flict between these two groups as old roles became obsolete or were shifting and new roles were emerging from the beginning it seemed likely that publishers would be more successful at it than librarians 62 the evidence of this paper supports that prediction however the field is in a state of ferment and it is hard to tell how the competition will turn out in the end given that open access mandates are increasing and new inexpensive journals are proliferating 3 quantity quality and value the basic assumption made in this paper is that more information is better we do have a rising chorus of complaints about information overload furthermore most researchers depend most of the time on a limited number of information sources this is the basis for some of the concerns about the viability of the big deals see for example 6 research libraries might reduce their subscriptions to just a small core of journals and rely on purchasing access to individual articles as needed just how much are all those extra journals worth why can t the libraries be more selective there are several answers to that there is a continuation of the traditional growth in the volume of scholarly information at about the traditional 3 per year rate that has scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 9 prevailed for many decades there is no sign this is going to stop furthermore with the increased emphasis on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research there is a need for access to all the research that is being produced second all the evidence we have is that libraries are not very good at selecting the best and of course the scholarly community itself is not very good at deciding what is the best the defects in the editorial and refereeing processes have been known for long and are becoming ever more apparent scholars cannot rely on just a narrow slice of available information even if it is confined to what has received the highest grade of approval from the current system another answer is that all those extra journals must be worth something this is demon strated by the behavior of scholars and libraries in the past after all the bottom quarter in terms of serials received of arl members obtained fewer than 17 000 serials in the 1999 2000 academic year before big deals became dominant while the top quarter all procured over 34 000 why did those richer libraries bother if the extra 17 000 serials could be dispensed with why didn t those institutions save the millions of dollars that each one spent annually on acquiring them further decisions about usage acquisition and retention of scholarly material are made at the margin and most of the current physical collections are of marginal value one can imagine that in negotiations in response to librarians pleas that the big deals are unaffordable publishers point out that they would be easily affordable if librarians sent off much of their hard copy material to distant and inexpensive storage facilities shut down some library facilities curtailed operating hours and so on all these steps would lower the level of access to useful information but so would abandoning the the big deals the real question is which hurts more in either case resources are devoted to providing access to material that for the most part has little value individually but substantial value in total not least in the option value of being able to access it when desired and of course there is much more that can be said in favor of wider availability the open access movement is based on the argument that we need far wider distribution of research results i won t attempt to survey all the arguments that have been produced except to say that they are overwhelmingly persuasive and are becoming ever more valid as scholarly literature grows and the need for and opportunities in interdisciplinary work increase bradford s law from information sciences was formulated to provide a quantitative estimate of diminishing returns from search in journals this law which is an empirical observation akin to various other laws such as those of pareto and zipf together with other evidence from a variety of fields suggests a more general rule 65 that as a very rough guide information whether in a library or on a hard disk or measured in transmission capacity should be valued on a logarithmic scale thus if a collection of 10 000 serials is valued at 4 one that is 10 times as large with 100 000 serials might be worth 5 that is a gain but not by factor of 10 but just by 1 25 for this paper though a precise measure is not necessary wider access is taken as positive what we find as is shown in the next section is that big deals have led to a major step in the right direction 10 andrew odlyzko 4 effects of big deals 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 year ra tio t o m e d ia n distribution of number of serials per research library 10 th percentile

number received arl statistics for the academic years 1989 1990 through 2009 2010 depicted in all the graphs as 1990 to 2010 show that the last decade has produced a remarkable increase in availability of serials this is shown graphically in fig 1 which is based on a ranking of the arl academic libraries by the number of serials they receive the increase in numbers of available journals was also accompanied by a notable leveling in availability among arl members this can already be discerned in fig 1 but is much clearer in fig 2 for each year the academic members of arl were ranked by the number of serials they received and the percentiles and displayed ratios were computed there is a great degree of compression especially at the top with the 90 th percentile institutions far closer today to the median than in earlier years the distribution of library budgets has not changed much over this period 3 so what we observe is the result of increased price discrimination figures 3 and 4 show statistics for the small vs large arl libraries defined in each year as those below and above the media in terms of total library budgets thus small is a relative term as in 2010 this category included a few libraries with budgets of over 22 million they demonstrate that the small institutions gained more than the large ones 4 the average price per serial received by arl academic members has plunged over the last decade to a level last seen around 1990 even in current dollars without any adjustment for inflation unless stated otherwise all dollar figures in this paper are in current dollars the growth of the last decade was certainly made possible by improvements in technol ogy so that huge collections of journals can be made available in electronic versions even

adjusted for inflation 12 andrew odlyzko by libraries that could not possibly hope to house them physically but much of the credit must be assigned to the reviled big deals in which publishers enriched their offerings by tossing in many additional journals this increase in journal availability was not accompa nied by commensurate revenue increases as is shown in the arl statistics summarized in section 5 while the growth in spending on serials did outpace the growth in library budgets it did so by a smaller margin in the first decade of the 21 st century than in the last of the 20 th a serious deficiency of the results presented here is that they tell us practically nothing about the big deal practices of the large publishers such as elsevier springer and wiley those are the publishers who attract the most attention and they also take a lion s share of the journal spending at libraries however they publish relatively few journals as an example elsevier the largest of these publishers has just under 2 000 serials 28 they are disproportionately expensive and also have disproportionately many articles however since arl statistics only provide the total number of serials in member collections the contribution of elsevier is essentially in the noise what we can observe is basically just the effect of various aggregators furthermore many and perhaps most scholars care only about peer reviewed journals there are only about 20 000 to 25 000 of them and the arl statistics this paper is based on do not distinguish them from others publishers pricing practices are not the result of altruism these practices make excel lent business sense for publishers with electronic delivery providing access has practically zero marginal cost from long interactions with libraries publishers likely have a good sense of how much they can squeeze out of each institution once that point is reached the in centive is to increase usage by everyone at that institution that way people get introduced and hopefully addicted to new data sources from that publisher which will make it that much harder for their libraries to pull out of the big deals further making all journals available to all customer libraries serves to decrease the advantages of open access the faculty students and staff have the necessary articles seamlessly available courtesy of the librarians and the library budget and so are less likely to complain to their colleagues at other institutions about not being able to find all they need therefore those colleagues feel less pressure to get involved in open access activities in the short and even intermediate run big deals therefore do promote wider access to scholarly literature and they do serve to push libraries to be more efficient thus what we observe in the arl libraries is adam smith s invisible hand producing socially desirable outcomes in the long run of course big deals do entrench the publishers their profits and their inefficiency perhaps the greatest puzzle about the wider availability of journals through big deals is that it has not occurred much earlier this has implications for the rest of the economy and will be discussed later first though let us look at the arl data and at some general financial statistics of universities libriaries and publishers 5 arl and other statistics the association of research libraries arl has as of this writing in early 2013 126 members of these 11 are public government or other non profit non academic institutions scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 13 library of congress library archives canada new york public library those 11 are excluded from all statistics presented in this paper since they usually have much wider missions and are on average far larger in terms of budgets the largest budget among arl members has for a long time belonged to the library of congress which currently spends about 6 times as much as the largest academic library that of harvard arl prepares annual reports on operations of its members which are available through 9 they cover academic years from july 1 to june 30 and have in recent years been prepared by martha kyrillidou and her colleagues thus the report entitled arl statistics 2009 2010 covers the 2009 10 academic year and was issued in the fall of 2011 it will be referred to in this paper as the arl 2010 report and similarly for other years almost all statistics in this paper are based on the 1990 through 2010 reports the 2011 report is now avail able but the bulk of the research was done before it was published so it is not included however it does not appear including it would have led to any significant changes in either the statistics or the conclusions the membership of arl is very stable over the 1990 2010 stretch academic members grew from 107 to 115 with just one withdrawal although the non renewing library stan ford was large and the 9 new members considerably smaller the distribution of library budgets has not changed much in 1990 the average budget was 12 99 million and the standard deviation was 50 0 of that by 2010 the average budget had grown to 27 49 million while the standard deviation only increased to 54 2 and the distribution curves for budgets not shown here were almost identical for those two years all figures are in current us dollars not corrected for inflation canadian data is presented in us dollars in arl statistics arl statistics are an unparalleled resource of detailed information about research li braries they go back to 1907 the famous gerould statistics of the first few decades they are very carefully collected and are a result of the very open and collaborative culture of librarians still in spite of strenuous attempts at uniformity and use of national infor mation standards organization guidelines they are not perfect the voluntary nature of reporting the presence of legacy systems and procedures and sudden local changes leads to some obvious anomalies as an example the expenditures by harvard on acquisition of serials reached 10 5 million in the 2004 report then came down to 8 4 million in the 2009 report and then skyrocketed to 15 3 million in 2010 yet another anomaly was the number of serials received by the university of michigan which was reported as 67 554 in 2004 124 809 in 2005 118 654 in 2006 and 71 788 in 2007 both cases likely arise from changes in categorizations such anomalies were ignored in preparing the statistics in this paper in the expectation they would not affect overall averages much in a few cases missing values were interpolated anomalies of this nature do not appear to be present in total library budgets nor in the amounts spent on acquisitions this is likely the result of stricter accounting standards and controls for monetary expenditures the serial counts shown in the figures are those for the total number of serials reported as being received by various libraries the serials that are purchased are a more relevant figure however not all libraries report this figure separately so in order to have fuller coverage the total serial count was used that is not likely to cause a major distortion 14 andrew odlyzko as among those institutions that do break out the purchased serials figure the fraction of serials that were received but not purchased was 24 1 in 1990 and 27 6 in 20095 for all statistics calculations were done separately for each year thus the small category of libraries in fig 3 included all libraries whose total budget was at or below the median for all budgets for a given year one of the major deficiencies of arl reports is that they seriously understate the internal costs of libraries they count only the direct pay of employees and not any of the health care or retirement benefits those employees receive arl reports also do not include most of the maintenance costs of library facilities heat electricity cleaning given the enormous variation in how universities account for such costs it would indeed be hard to come up with a uniform reporting standard that could be implemented easily so these omissions are understandable still what they mean is actual total library costs are likely about 25 higher than the budgets given in the arl reports as confirmed by some correspondence with librarians 6 universities publishers and libraries the arl has statistics showing library budgets as fractions of total university budgets for a sizable collection of their members 10 the chart for the 40 members that have reported since 1982 shows an inexorable decline in this ratio from about 3 7 to a bit under 2 0 6 as was mentioned above more accurate accounting would inflate the cost of libraries by about 25 so the decline was from a level of about 4 5 to about 2 5 but the trend and size of the decline would not have been affected materially by this adjustment thus libraries have been getting a shrinking part of the entire budget and there would be no journal crisis had they just maintained their share from the 1970 s however this has to be put in context universities have an insatiable desire for more funding they are complicated entities and need to support many activities retirement bonuses for administrators buyout pack ages for heads of athletic departments fancy big football fields and of course fancy salaries for football coaches all compete for funding with a variety of other categories including libraries faculty salaries classroom and lab buildings mental health counseling for stu dents and many other cost centers note that the 2 million or so that a typical large university paid for access to all elsevier journals in 2007 would not be enough to pay for a single prominent football coach a very remarkable fact is that in spite of all the wailing and gnashing of teech univer sities have been extremely successful in obtaining more funding this is surely the result of the observation cited earlier in the introduction that education is becoming ever more important as technology and the economy advance table 1 shows statistics for arl mem bers in the last two decades with cpi denoting the main consumer price index for the u s 7 their budgets have grown far faster than the economy as a whole and so have library budgets even though they grew more slowly and not as fast as spending on library acquisitions note the growth rates for total budgets for arl member universities are suspiciously large and will need to be verified they are based on data from the arl for 1990 2000 and scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 15 table 1 annual compound growth rates year us gdp us cpi university library library serials budgets budgets purchases purchases 1990 2000 5 55 2 85 6 83 4 65 6 16 6 93 2000 2010 3 85 2 53 8 70 3 74 4 84 5 64 2009 since figures for 2010 were not available so a 9 year annual growth rate was entered in the 2000 2010 line only figures for the 89 arl members for which data were given in the arl tables for each of those three years were used some of the figures in those tables seem anomalous for example the budgets of the university of connecticut university of michigan university of new mexico ohio state temple university of utah university of virginia and western ontario are all shown in those arl compilations as increasing by more than a factor of 3 from 2000 to 2009 this is rather implausible unless it corresponds to some major changes in accounting such as sudden inclusion of revenues from affiliated hospitals and if it does this would be misleading still there have been other reported statistics of higher education budgets in the u s outpacing not just inflation but gdp growth and sometimes even medical sector growth so whatever the right figure in that column it is likely to be high 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 year p e rc e n t fraction of library budgets spent on acqusitions all purchases serials fig 5 fraction of library budgets devoted to all acquisitions and to purchases of serials one result of the trends shown in table 1 is displayed in fig 5 the share of library budgets that goes out in purchases of books journals and databases has grown substan tially from 33 in 1990 to 42 5 in 2010 if we correct for the undercounting of library budgets cited before the growth is from about 25 to about 33 further all of this 16 andrew odlyzko growth is accounted for by serials books and other materials have just about held their own with books shrinking at the expense of the rest collectively academic members of arl had budgets that added up to 3 16 billion according to the 2010 report so that their actual costs were likely close to 4 billion of this 1 34 billion was spent on outside acquisitions and 884 million of that on serials the entire scholarly publishing market as measured in terms of publisher revenues is someplace around 20 billion per year 8 of this journals account for 8 10 billion there are various estimates for the number of scholarly articles published each year although it does seem to be agreed this number grows by between 3 and 3 5 per year the report 84 had a figure of about 1 5 million english language peer reviewed being published in 2009 there are some estimates that are higher around 2 or 2 5 million and they may also be correct in that they may include non english publications as well as some serials that are not peer reviewed this paper uses the round figure of 2 million for simplicity 7 lower cost models revenues of 10 billion and 2 million articles mean an average cost to society of the scholarly publishing system of about 5 000 per article this does seem to be typical note that this does not differ much from the estimate made almost two decades ago 56 of about 4 000 per article if we consider the reed elsevier annual report for 2011 28 we find that the science and technology segment of the elsevier business unit had revenues of about 1 7 billion and published around 240 000 articles since that division also published books and engaged in other activities if we assume 1 2 billion as the journal revenues we obtain a figure of about 5 000 per article many professional societies operate at similar levels for example the american mathematical society had journal revenues of 4 7 million in 2010 and published 873 articles for revenues of 5 400 per article 9 most of the arguments for open access are valid irrespective of the costs of publica tions and are based on the public good efficiency of research and similar considerations however the possibility of moving to dramatically lower cost structures does make a switch to new business models much easier to perform it has been clear for two decades that much lower costs in scholarly publishing are possible but with some exceptions little has been done to the bulk of the literature to move in that direction as a point of contrast and information the costs of running the arxiv preprint server are under 10 per article that is submitted each year there is still some cost various problems arise with submitters most handled by unpaid volunteers who do some minimal screening to eliminate inappropriate postings basic software changes have to be handled new features need to be put it compatibility has to be preserved and so on however with minimal human intervention costs can be very low once experts get involved costs can mount up quickly as an example the mathscinet reviewing operation of the amer ican mathematical society 3 collects revenues of about 100 per reviewed paper and depending on how various expenses are allocated costs possibly not much more than half scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 17 of that or about 50 per paper this time subject experts with phds in the appropriate disciplines are involved as well as myriads of unpaid reviewers and publishers cooperate in providing metadata and other information still this cost is about two orders of magnitude lower than current average cost of an article that serves to disprove frequent claims of publishers that metadata provision is expensive can one operate high quality scholarly journals for less than 5 000 per article that this issue is still debated is a good introduction to a major theme of the rest of the paper the slow rate not just of actual change but even of information diffusion in our society almost two decades ago various investigators estimated that between 300 and 1 000 per article should be sufficient for good service 56 since that time mountains of evidence have accumulated to support that conclusion there are now numerous journals operated by their editors without any explicit monetary flows further we have among others the edgar and willinsky study 26 of almost 1 000 journals that use their open journal system in use by about 5 000 journals in all which found the first copy costs which is essentially all that matters if one considers purely electronic publishing of 188 per article clearly many of these low cost ventures do benefit from implicit subsidies such as free use of university information technology infrastructure and would not scale to larger journals without having to pay for various types of administrative assistance still when we have examples of 10 x cost savings even a doubling of the cost to pay for all those extras still leaves us with a 5 x cost advantage that lower costs were possible was obvious even three decades ago since the costs per article varied wildly between publishers this showed that costs were not a matter of unavoidable necessity but of market power choice and inertia this has become far clearer since then there are many cost reductions that are feasible and desirable let us consider some the first step is to abandon print entirely and publish strictly electronically that will eliminate the expenses not just of the print operation but also of the preparation for print once that is done it will be much clearer that there is much more that we can choose to economize on for example why devote a lot of effort to ensuring consistency in layout reference styles etc in a purely electronic journal those activities do consume extensive effort even in low cost serials see for example the data for the open journal system journals 26 in a printed version it might have made some sense but in the modern online environment where readers follow threads from one journal to another this uniformity contributes little some of the terrible waste that is involved in scholarly publishing involves no money but extra work for authors for example some journals insist that not only the final accepted versions of papers adhere to their chosen format but that even initial submissions do this is not just wasteful but silly yet it persists and provides yet another illustration of the inertia in academic publishing to get to the lowest ranges of costs one can also eliminate most of copy editing the quality of author prepared manuscripts that i find at the arxiv and ssrn preprint repositories is almost always completely adequate from my personal perspective the same is true of the conference proceedings that acm and ieee publish where the authors are 18 andrew odlyzko responsible for producing the files using the publisher supplied style files as a reader of scholarly journals and i read a lot in a variety of fields i find copy editing useless although admittedly this is an extreme opinion as an author i find that copy editing subtracts value by forcing me to do extra work usually for no good reason and often to correct what the copy editors have done as just one example a recent set of proofs i received resulted from the publisher editing the manuscript and among other things changing the reference style from the one my coauthor and i used in the preprint to the official one of the publication although i loathe that style the move was understandable as our contribution is to be a chapter in a book where uniformity is expected however the editing introduced all sorts of grammatical and stylistic errors the result was that my coauthor and i spent more time correcting the proofs than we would have spent getting things right in the first place had we been told what was wanted thus my firm conviction is that one can publish scholarly articles at much lower cost than is done today one can do it even if one does a moderate amount of copy editing as the edgar and willinsky data 26 shows the 800 million that just the arl members alone spend on journals is about 400 for each of the 2 million or so articles that appear each year and 400 should be plenty as was forecast two decades ago and as is demonstrated by many respectable journals yet the world is currently paying about 5 000 per article the question is whether we can get there from here 8 competition between libraries and publishers the evolution of academic information systems is viewed most fruitfully as dominated by competition between publishers and libraries however one should not neglect the role of an increasing variety of other players as this sector evolves a century ago libraries and publishers were basically the only significant players and there was a strict separation in their functions today the lines are blurry it used to be that publishers put out books and journals and libraries preserved them for posterity publishers might keep some copies of old issues in their inventory but were not obliged to and had little incentive to reprint but with electronic publications it is far more efficient and effective to have the publishers maintain the files migrate material to new formats etc i am ignoring here issues such as censorship which is far easier to carry out on a publisher s few mirrors than it is on a thousand libraries it does not have to be a publisher that does this as the internet archive and google books demonstrate and there are many other players in this expand ing arena from high performance computing centers that increasingly handle large data sets to commercial organizations curating genomic databases that is not a surprise in formation and education are becoming more important to society so it is to be expected that more will be spent on it this is the same phenomenon that is driving up spending on medical care although various reforms have been carried out and others are planned the move towards more of the economy being devoted to health is worldwide associated with rising standards of living any increases in efficiency there are likely to be swallowed up in new treatments or just in more treatments for an aging population similar trends appear scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 19 likely to operate in education while the traditional functions of librarians and publishers are obsolete new opportunities are arising for intermediaries between researchers and other researchers or between researchers and the wider public there are many interesting statistics at 9 demonstrating decline of the traditional functions of libraries thus between 1995 and 2010 the number of students at arl insti tutions grew by 33 with the ranks of teaching faculty and graduate students climbing 15 and 43 respectively the only category of library services involving physical mate rial that showed growth was interlibrary loans which climbed 92 this reflects libraries concentrating their budges on serials and giving up on trying to keep up with the growth in the number of new books being published in other categories initial circulation i e excluding renewals of physical volumes dropped by 42 thus it is a gross exaggeration that nobody uses the library anymore as one sometimes heard from faculty or students but the decline in borrowings per student by more than half is telling what is perhaps most surprising is that the number of requests for reference assistance dropped by 66 in absolute terms as is shown in fig 6 and thus by about 75 on a per student basis this is certainly a core competency of librarians and they are great at navigating the torrents of electronic information as well as providing guidance to the use of traditional printed sources however it appears that google wikipedia publisher databases and the like are good enough for most scholars and that the convenience of around the clock access from anyplace outweighs the higher quality that librarians provide 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 0 5 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 year re fe re n ce t ra n sa ct io n s t h o u sa n d s reference transactions fig 6 average number of reference transaction in reporting research libraries 1995 2010 the declining reliance on reference librarians is intriguing in many perhaps most of the areas of the economy we see great willingness to pay more for what is perceived as the very best even when the margin over second best is extremely slight or illusory so the very top athletes artists and lawyers and sometimes even academics see their pay 20 andrew odlyzko skyrocket while the crowds of competitors who are almost as good languish in obscurity and often penury ranks of applicants to top ranked universities grow tremendously even though there is little evidence this leads to more successful careers but librarian skills are apparently not perceived in this same light what librarians could have done and might yet do is discussed later first though let s consider publishers they have moved faster than librarians to adjust to the new world as was to be expected 62 they have many options for maintaining their leaderships as well as their profits in the future a transition to gold open access in which authors or their funding agencies pay the publishers and the articles are make freely available might not be a threat by itself but rather a possible opportunity to increase revenues if one can sustain subscriptions say in a hybrid model even if publishers are forced to lower their revenues they could maintain their profits by making some of the moves discussed in section 7 such as giving up entirely on print decreasing the amount of copy editing and abandoning the requirements for uniform style in each journal they might also increase their profits while keeping revenues steady by implementing some of these moves the basic and very promising approach open to publishers is to continue marginalizing libraries by extending the reach and scope of big deals the consortium model in which groups of libraries cooperate to get access to a big deal is already common and can be pushed further the ultimate situation might be national big deals where some top level bodies pay for access for everyone from a nation enlarging the big deal especially through further mergers but also by including additional information sources can serve to create packages that simply could not be dispensed with the most obvious move in that direction which is already taking place to a small extent is to make books both current and old ones a part of the big deal recall that the process of digitizing old printed materials is extremely inexpensive while it is a little puzzling that journal big deals have been so slow to spread the slow rate for inclusion of books is much more understandable for several decades now the principal method of using scholarly journals has been to scan a multitude of articles photocopy the ones that appeared to deserve more careful study and work with those photocopies hence the transition to all electronic journals is relatively seamless with the photocopying being replaced by printing it is also far more efficient as one does not have to go to the library and handle awkward bound volumes and instead prints in one s own office or study even so there are die hard traditionalists who continue to insist that nothing will replace the traditional methods however their ranks are decreasing printed books on the other hand have many more adherents they are traditionally used in ways substantially different from that of articles it would have been difficult a decade ago for example to persuade scholars to give them up however improvements in technology have led to very nice ebook readers and more general tablet computers and there is a rapid move in the population as a whole towards ebooks scholarly publishers therefore have a chance to jump on the bandwagon and also to speed it up by digitizing their current offerings as well as their old out of print volumes they can provide better service to readers and reduce the need for libraries furthermore with the improving quality of print on demand services it is still possible to cater to those who insist on paper copies scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 21 making books as well as back issues of journals widely available in electronic forms could also help in indirect ways in the traditional print world it would have been a major disaster for a small institution say reed college to be given a duplicate of all of the harvard libraries physical collections there simply would not have been the space or personnel to handle such riches but based on experience we can be sure that reed college faculty and students would use all that is at harvard if that were available online and once harvard faculty see their colleagues at reed relying on ebooks instead of hard copy volumes their resistance to doing the same will diminish it would also be wise for publishers to overcome their reluctance to tamper with copy rights and to forcefully push for legislative solutions to the orphan works problem orphan works which are those that are under copyright but whose copyright owners cannot be located provide a major justification for the existence of large physical collections in li braries as that is the only legal way to make such works accessible to the public to the extent orphan works are digitized and made freely available the need for library facili ties both physical and personnel declines that would make it easier for publishers to appropriate even more of the resources now going to libraries what about libraries they are handicapped in the competition with publishers by several factors see 62 one of them that they have the bulk of the resources and are thus a fat target is a strength as well at least in principle it makes possible revolutionary changes in particular as was shown earlier just the external journal purchases of the arl libraries alone could provide open access publishing for the world s entire scholarly literature had libraries thrown their resources enthusiastically behind new low cost open access journals perhaps the current scene and the unfolding future sketched here would have been different but that would have required many research partners willing to put their energy into the enterprise certainly a very doubtful proposition given the inertia in the academic system and the willingness of librarians to cannibalize their bread and butter operations certainly librarians present a classic case of christensen s innovator s dilemma pressed to maintain traditional services and therefore slow to embrace new ones as an example digital libraries have been discussed in the library literature for decades further the amount that arl libraries spend in a single year on acquisition of serials would have sufficed with plenty left over to digitize all their standard books and journals that are out of copyright 10 yet it was outside efforts in particular the gutenberg project the early pioneer almost forgotten google books and the internet archive that led the way 11 and thus today we do see libraries moving towards support of open access beginning to pay some author submission fees and providing financial and management support for inexpensive new journals but the moves are slow reflecting perhaps the hesitant embrace of open access one detects in 36 and may not be enough to prevent further publisher encroachments we also see libraries moving into other services such as providing long term storage for publications data sets and so on however there they are competing not just with publishers who also see the opportunities but also other organizations such as campus information technology units high performance computer centers and a variety of new commercial startups the opportunities are many but so are the competitors 22 andrew odlyzko 9 the future of the economy scholarly communication and the big deals are interesting not only in their own right but also because they provide interesting perspectives on the development of the general economy as one example one of the reigning mantras of the internet bubble was that of friction free capitalism a term that was coined by bill gates and one that he was very proud of 32 33 barriers would fall middlemen would be disintermediated o ften the only humans involved in a transaction will be the actual buyer and seller 32 p 158 and the economy would be far more efficient yet there was a certain implausibility from the start about the vision of friction free capitalism how could it be reconciled with the rich profits microsoft was making and continues to make today even in the face of competition from free linux and other operating systems and even as pc sales sag there were many arguments that while the economy would get more efficient it would depend crucially on speed bumps 58 such speed bumps were actually mentioned briefly by bill gates in 32 p 234 those speed bumps might take a variety of forms from various methods for increasing switching costs to patent and regulatory barriers it is noteworthy to observe the growth in the ranks of lobbyists in washington especially those representing the technology industry when it is only the inertia of habit that induces customers to stick to a particular web site for browsing or shopping any speed bumps matter and court injunctions say become giant speed bumps mergers and acquisitions such as those witnessed in academic publishing over the last couple of decades can be viewed as attempts to create bigger speed bumps in which refusing to deal with a particular publisher becomes unthinkable that lets publishers get away from the constraints imposed by models such as those studied in 50 among speed bumps many can be categorized as part of confusology scott adams back in 1998 had the prescient idea in one of his dilbert books that companies form confusopolies to make it impossible for the average individual to determine who has the lowest price 2 p 161 let us use the word confusology for the more general art of befud dling customers it is an art that flourishes and financial analysts have claimed recently for example that f or years the telecom industry has thrived on obfuscation 52 in view of the high demand for expert practitioners in confusology it is strange that academia has not yet developed courses in it a very elementary form of confusology is to pollute the consumer website data where an investigation has uncovered fake reviewing on an al most industrial scale with companies paying offshore contractors to post numerous glowing accounts of their activities yet maintaining they are from unbiased consumers 77 with the benefits of hindsight we can see that the economy has become more efficient and many intermediaries have been disintermediated there are many news stories about modern technology empowering customers cf 14 24 brick and mortar stores that have not mastered confusology sufficiently do suffer from shoppers who look and test and then comparison shop at amazon and other places on their smart phones often right in the store but they are likely to soon learn or else will go out of business two stories in the same recent issue of the new york times illustrate both the problem for sellers and the obvious potential solutions 17 68 one article discusses apps available to customers that alert them to sales on goods and services they are interested in to compensate for scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 23 the rapidly changing prices 17 the other though shows how even in the world of high priced art where auctions which are acclaimed by economists as an ideal tool for price discovery are a basic sales method sellers manage to confuse the scene even though the buyers are usually very wealthy and thus presumably sophisticated individuals 68 thus we can expect and already see in many situations sellers avoiding the disadvantages that the stores in 17 suffer by moving to offering personalized discounts etc thus on balance it is not clear that the economy has become more transparent or that the role of intermediaries has diminished even though the dominant ones may now have different names like google ebay and amazon auctions for ads by google are a triumph for theoretical economics but they are imposed by google which has an interest in having a transparent market that will maximize its revenues elsewhere we find dramatically different pictures by far the largest industry is health care it is also among the fastest growing and there is no denying that it is improving lives although not as fast as it is swallowing resources it seems it is also among the most opaque the discussion here as well as in most of this paper is very u s centric and various parts of the argument and evidence may not apply to other countries an individual even one not dealing with an emergency who attempts to deal with this system encounters a bewildering morass with prices unobtainable or incomplete and varying wildly between different providers and cryptic codes in bills that conceal obscure and unexpected charges e g 71 not paying such bills promptly though often leads to encounters with abusive bill collectors a standard way to mitigate such problems for those affluent enough or with jobs that provide good employee benefits is insurance but that introduces a new and expensive for society level of intermediaries that also are good at confusology there are all those reasonable and customary fees that do not necessarily seem reasonable and whose determination is a closely guarded secret of the insurers although a few lawsuits have led to some reform and transparency an experienced business journalist made more than 70 phone calls to 16 organizations and yet was still not able to find out how much he would have to pay for a prescription drug that keeps his cancer under control 43 digital health records should eventually lead to better medical care however their spread was pushed by the government largely on the promise of reducing costs as of now w e ve not achieved the productivity and quality benefits that are unquestionably there for the taking and evidence of significant savings is scant and there is increasing concern that electronic records have actually added to costs by making it easier to bill more for some services 1 medical care is just one example of extensive confusology the financial industry is another during the internet bubble banks were often seen as obsolete intermediaries that were at best doomed to shrink instead along with the rest of the financial industry they have prospered one of their routes to prosperity was creation of confusing products acclaimed by economists and regulators as instruments for spreading the risk to those able and willing to bear it they ended up in the hands of those who understood them the least even the most visible financial markets with all the rules and regulations were visibly murky even before the crisis of 2008 70 as much of the trading was carried out in opaque venues out of sight of the public more recently we have learned that the libor rate perhaps 24 andrew odlyzko the most prominent financial benchmark had been manipulated for years the growing complexity of our interconnected world appears to allow for increased manipulation and inefficiency even regulators with access to far more information than the general public much less the general public often fail to understand what is happening large banks which created and helped conceal many of the dangerous financial practices that brought the economy to the brink of precipice in 2008 had to be rescued because they were too big to fail in the process the surviving ones have become much too big to fail and in spite of pledges of reform appear to be just as opaque as before 66 it is not just profit making corporations that rely on such methods higher education institutions are expert practitioners of confusology university budgets are opaque and little comparative performance data is available for different institutions while affirmative action on grounds of gender or race does attract substantial scrutiny the extent of athletic or legacy preferences usually only catches public attention when some scandal erupts and higher education pricing is also increasingly confusing while tuition is rising rapidly so is financial aid which at private universities in the u s now amounts to over 40 of tuition revenue furthermore there is an increasing amount of bargaining between parents and institutions the commercial higher education sector is an extreme example an investigation by a u s senate committee found that among 30 for profit colleges an average of 22 4 percent of revenue went to marketing and recruiting 19 4 percent to profits and 17 7 percent to instruction 44 might seem shocking but figures for non profits might also turn out shocking if they were available in general in many sectors of the economy the basic cost of providing goods and services is often dominated by various overhead expenses from this point of view academic publishing is only catching up to the general trends whereas in the old print only world pricing was fairly simple now it is concealed by the non disclosure clauses of the big deal contracts and a new group of intermediaries has arisen who for a fee and based on their private knowledge of the market help libraries negotiate improved big deals publishers use their superior knowledge of the market as well as of usage patterns to argue that the deal they are offering a particular institution is the very best deal in the world and it often is as the availability of many measures makes it possible to custom tailor metrics that show just about anything one can wish thus it is hard to tell what is happening 10 the tom sawyer economy and control of chokepoints a frequent complaint by researchers and librarians is that publishers profit from the unpaid labor of scholars who write papers and referee submissions yet that is an increasingly common feature of the economy and scholarly publishing may be viewed as a forerunner of this trend in the stock market for much of 2012 the most valuable company in the world was apple it is also among the enterprises most admired by the general public its dominant position is due largely to the iphone and the ipad and a key reason those products were embraced enthusiastically by the world is the multitude of apps that are available those scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 25 apps are mostly produced by independent developers apple boasts that these developers have earned 6 5 billion over four years 80 but there are about 300 000 of these developers so on average they have earned all of about 20 000 on average from their creations and this was spread over four years in the meantime in just the last quarter of 2012 apple had revenues of 54 5 billion with net profits of 13 1 billion the bulk derived from the iphones and ipads so it is a partnership in which apple gets almost all the profits what the app developers get is bragging rights hopes of striking it rich and an occasional bonanza to keep the game going the apple app developer situation is characteristic of many of the most visible recent high tech success stories facebook and google derive their value from the activities and contributions of their users they only provide the basic infrastructure for interaction the value of crucial control points in extracting value was already demonstrated by intel and microsoft in the pc industry it was a common observation that by controlling the chip architecture and the operating system software respectively this duo was earning monopoly profits while the rest of the industry had to be content with commodity status today we are further along the way to what we might call the tom sawyer economy in mark twain s classic tom sawyer condemned by aunt polly to a day of hard labor manages to inveigle neighborhood boys into paying him for the privilege of doing this work while few businesses have attained this pinnacle of success many have come close for example angie s list relies entirely on user generated material but charges for access to it among others in a similar situation is of course academic publishing 11 privacy and the surreptitious spread of price discrimination that the university of michigan paid 2 million for the same unlimited access to all elsevier journals that the university of montana got for less than a quarter of the price is an excellent illustration of an extremely important ongoing and so far seldom discussed development in our economy that is the growth of price discrimination there is nothing nefarious about price discrimination it is a basic technique that has been practiced for millennia and its theoretical foundations which demonstrate its fre quent benefits in stimulating economic activity were first elucidated by the french econo engineers of the middle of the 19 th century 27 price discrimination by itself is not the ultimate goal in commerce rather price discrimination is a tool for maximizing revenues and profits some techniques such a the bundling represented by big deals are viewed most productively as forms of price discrimination that avoid the necessity of costly intru sive and objectionable fine scale pricing first degree price discrimination in which each customer is charged the maximal amount that customer is willing and able to pay for a particular good or service is the ideal however for a long time it was regarded as mainly a theoretical construct almost impossible to attain except to some extent in cases such as that of the income tax where governments with coercive powers obtain detailed financial information from taxpayers under penalty of jail the internet however is making what was unattainable increasingly feasible the internet especially in its wireless incarnation enables sellers to do two things that have been difficult in the traditional brick and mortar world both are needed to enable 26 andrew odlyzko first degree price discrimination and both require erosion of privacy one is to find out how much each individual purchaser is willing to pay the other is to control usage which prevents arbitrage in which a person able to obtain a low price resells the good or service to a person who would be charged a higher price by the seller the basic theory of the standard homo economicus economic model as well as results from psychology behavioral economics and especially history lead 58 64 to the theory that the incentive to price discriminate is the driving force behind the erosion of privacy and to numerous predictions such as there will be no limit on the extent of privacy invasion attempted by sellers the public will be very sensitive to privacy erosion the public will be extremely sensitive to price discrimination price discrimination will spread slowly and primarily in concealed forms the public will not resort to technical means for protecting privacy but will call for government intervention governments will play ambiguous roles often pretending to protect privacy but fre quently acting to facilitate price discrimination recent news stories provide nice illustrations of these points the account of how target deduces from a customer s purchases that she is pregnant and starts sending her ads for infant care items sometimes even before her family learns of her condition attracted considerable public attention 22 rather characteristically in this area target stopped cooperating with the reporter even before the story was published surely out of concern about such public attention but the logic of this move is clear it is also clear that there are incentives to move even earlier especially once other retailers start competing in this arena why wait to deduce the fact of pregnancy from purchases if one can get hold of information about the customer s condition say from visits to physicians or from health care monitoring services why not start then or better yet if one can monitor her voice or email communications with her significant other one can start a campaign even before she gets pregnant companies detected in such practices invariably claim they do not care about per sonally identifiable information so that for example they would be sending out ads for infant care products to the class of women who might be pregnant this excuse of not having individual identifications was widely accepted not just by industry apologists such as the authors of 73 who claimed in several places that a dvertisers have no interest in the identity of individual customers but also by more careful scholars such as d solove who opined in 2001 79 p 418 that s ince marketers are interested in aggregate data they do not care about snooping into particular people s lives but such claims are ever harder to sustain in the face of data brokers that are increasingly tying people s real life identities to their online browsing habits so that a car dealer greets a potential customer with detailed information on what car models and accessories that customer had investi gated on the web 82 and would such information lead the dealer to offer the customer an especially low price public sensitivity to such practices is shown by the strong negative reactions to the discovery that orbitz was showing to mac users more expensive hotels than to pc users 48 scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 27 this was actually a very mild move as even the mac users had access to the lower priced hotels displayed to pc users it s just that they were not displayed at the top of the screen still this incident does demonstrate public concern and makes sellers aware they are playing with fire when they engage in such practices that is why price discrimination is practiced quietly and mostly in mild forms so far 51 83 but we can expect to see intensification of such efforts both as part of an arms race and also as ways to probe how much the public will tolerate and to accustom the public to such practices many of the design choices in services and goods that we observe are likely influenced by the price discrimination incentive for example the push for the cloud places people s activities under far closer scrutiny of the operators of such clouds that provides more data about customer s interests and willingness to pay and also allows for monitoring of usage to prevent arbitrage the excitement about mobile technologies is likely also stimulated by the implicit hope that more information and control over user s activities will translate into large profits the concerns that many investors and financial analysts express about lack of effectiveness of mobile ads may thus miss the point or be of only short term significance the real promise of the always connected mobile life for service providers is that they might get more control over their customers as has often been noted the public concern about privacy is an unfocused one people complain about their loss of privacy but are not willing to do much about it and usually cannot articulate what it is they are upset about framing the issue in terms of price discrimination brings clarity to the discussion on one hand there are the well understood benefits of this practice on the other hand is its assault on the sense of fairness which appears not to be unique to homo sapiens as even some monkey have been shown to share it and the potential demise of the market economy as the demand supply curves so beloved of economists become irrelevant academic publishers big deals provide a very illuminating example of the spread of price discrimination that it should happen is natural technology is enabling it the eco nomic incentives are there and after all universities are among the foremost practitioners of differential pricing with high tuition coupled with high levels of financial aid so why should they not be subjected to it as well until the late 1990 s pricing for scholarly journals was simple and uniform at least for libraries publishers were already moving into differ ential pricing by offering lower rates to individual subscribers as well as to less developed countries now we have a 4 5 or greater differential between state universities in the u s and surely much higher across the world where many countries do have concessionary deals this extensive and intensive application of price discrimination was accomplished sur reptitiously it is only because of the efforts of ted bergstrom and his colleagues 12 that we have a few details and their efforts were impeded by publishers filing lawsuit to stop the disclosure in addition we have the indirect evidence given by the statistics of this paper one might think that elsevier would be glad to demonstrate that contrary to its reputation as a predatory profit maximizer it was engaging in the very socialist activity of leveling access to information by charging the rich more than the poor but such is not the case and it is easy to understand why as issues of fairness arise even in dealing with 28 andrew odlyzko large universities it is easy for harvard to appeal to its alumni to donate so that harvard s libraries can be the best in the world and provide an advantage for harvard faculty and students it is a trickier thing to ask harvard alumni to donate to their alma mater just so it can pay ten times as much as some unknown school in the boondocks for the same degree of access to elsevier journals another noteworthy point about the spread of big deals is how slow it was why did the developments visible in fig 1 not occur a decade earlier part of the reason is surely that publishers have been slow to learn they spent much of the late 1990 s playing around with schemes to charge individuals for each access these experiments such as the peak one run by elsevier were costly and annoying to the scholars who got involved 46 they should have been seen as doomed right from the beginning but the industry had to learn this lesson for itself and even after they realized that big deals was the best way to proceed it took a while for it to be widely accepted librarians may not be as conservative in their ways as academics but still the terms of the contracts had to be hammered out the budgeting and contracting procedures changed etc note that the sensitivity to price discrimination in dealing with academia is not as severe as in dealing with the public in general differential pricing is far more common in business to business transactions this slow spread of price discrimination in academic publishing likely foreshadows its slow spread in consumer pricing as well one reason the differential pricing practices of the big deals could be implemented effectively was the gain in information by publishers about usage of their products in the old print world they knew very little about it the librarians knew more but even the librarians had limited knowledge not much more than the frequency of circulation of print volumes with the move to online distribution much more precise measures became avail able and now the publishers have the upper hand while they do share some information with libraries they can aggregate and compare data from different institutions and of course they have information about library and entire university budgets thus this offers another example of how loss of privacy facilitates price discrimination some other publisher practices are also what we find elsewhere prices are always pre sented as discounted from some notional list price and never as surcharges imposed on rich institutions from the standpoint of the standard economic model it does not matter which method is used but homo sapiens is not homo economicus and how prices are presented matters a lot that s why universities practice price discrimination by having high tuition and offering frequent and large discounts called scholarships and the like and that is why we are moving to a world in which starbucks will likely raise the standard price of their caramel frappuccino to 9 95 and never discount it below 8 for somebody who is rich and a caramel frappuccino addict while somebody who can t tell the differ ence between a caramel frappuccino from starbucks and a regular cup of macdonald s coffee will get discounts lowering the effective price to 2 the mobile world where the nature of the discount can be obfuscated due to location and other circumstances will likely facilitate such developments the final major lesson from big deals is that however hard the public may dis like price discrimination it is hard to stop sellers will have strong incentives to employ scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 29 it especially as competition intensifies with their resources and incentives to cooperate consumers are unlikely to be able to protect themselves further even if they could it is unlikely they will bother historical precedents suggest they will turn to the government to step in and regulate objectionable practices 58 64 however governments have often played ambiguous roles paying lip service to public demands but facilitating price dis crimination some differential pricing can be criticized for targeting the poor or more frequently the ignorant who are often but not always poor 83 but very often it can be shown to have positive social effects such is the case with progressive taxation with college tuition practices and with prescription drug price differences between countries 45 the murkiness of many of these deals does leave ground for criticism for example one index shows drug prices in mexico as 24 higher than in the u s which is high on the list but not the highest but there is a highly significant positive correlation between per capita income and the drug price index so on balance it is easy to argue they are good for the world as a whole the big deal practices also appear to have enhanced social welfare one can argue that the world would have been better had libraries and researchers moved to squeeze out publishers and move open access forward faster but both groups have been slow to act while publishers are providing visibly better service through big deals as is seen in fig 1 hence why should even well intentioned regulators step in chances are that similar arguments will prevail in many other situations and that in spite of public opposition price discrimination will spread 12 conclusions the most important developments in scholarly publishing are taking place quietly with essentially no public discussion the traditional roles of the two key intermediaries libraries and publishers are shrinking new opportunities are opening up however which forces those two groups into new roles and brings in new agents such as google who will perform what functions is open to competition and at this point the publishers are doing better than libraries whether this will continue and what the role of new agents that are competing for these functions will be is hard to predict however publishers have provided much better access to scholarly information through the often criticized big deal packages the evolution of the academic information market suggests that the general economy will continue to evolve in ways contrary to common predictions opaque markets and price discrimination are likely to play an increasing role notes 1 as in all of this paper only the large north american institutions that are represented in the arl are considered the cost structure is often different in other places in particular in the less developed world where labor costs are lower 2 one of the few recent items that even touched on the subject was a post by phil davis 21 that cited the decreasing fraction of university budgets available for internal 30 andrew odlyzko expenses as a sign of greater efficiency inside libraries as is argued here it is more a case of publishers performing more of the work that was traditionally in the domain of librarians than of librarians being more efficient 3 see section 5 4 however this observation should be treated with caution library budgets and pur chasing patterns depend heavily on the nature of the institution for example whether it has a medical school or a law school and so on therefore it would not necessarily be justified to conclude that the higher prices that small institutions paid per serial in 1990 compared to large ones represented price discrimination however the relative gains visible in fig 2 do appear to clearly favor small schools 5 there were various other factors that were disregarded as they did not appear to lead to large changes in the relevant statistics for example starting with the 2007 report arl members were asked to report serial titles that were received and not subscriptions 6 it is worth pointing out though that the chart for the 17 members that reported since 1966 shows an initial jump from a level of about 2 9 and then essentially a constant fraction until about 1980 when the decline starts 7 the gdp growth rates are derived from http www usgovernmentspending com us gdp history usgs 101 the cpi ones from ftp ftp bls gov pub special requests cpi cpiai txt the other figures are from arl com pilations although arl has many canadian members this presentation is u s centric and ignores the fact that canadian data is part of the arl reports 8 see 84 or the jan 6 2012 announcement of the simba information report http www simbainformation com about release asp id 2503 many sources look only at stm publications but one needs to consider also the humanities etc which while not large in terms of revenues are not negligible 9 figures derived from the 2010 2011 annual report 3 a more accurate accounting would almost surely produce a somewhat lower figure though as the revenue figure includes services provided to other scholarly organizations that report shows total publications program revenues of 19 5 million and expenses of 14 7 million for a profit margin of 25 this appears to be not atypical of nonprofit professional societies which often use profits from publications to subsidize their other activities 10 as was clear two decades ago 56 and as has now been confirmed by various large scale projects such as that of the internet archive one can digitize a book for about 20 per copy on average hence the 884 million spent on serials around 2010 would have paid for conversion of over 40 million volumes far more than the number of unique sets that are out of copyright harvard reports about 17 million volumes total the library of congress 35 million and this is for everything including recent publications 11 as another example of the cautious and incremental librarian approaches consider the study 74 of costs of print and electronic journal subscriptions it was far too conservative in the estimates of moving to big deals in which per journal costs outside the purchase price are negligible scholarly publishing and evolution of commerce 31 acknowledgments thanks are due to claudio aspesi ted bergstrom kris fowler paul ginsparg
