antiferromagnetic csmnf 3 at liquid helium temper atures and magnetoelastic waves in antiferromagnetic febo 3 at liquid nitrogen temperature in a helical resonator was studied it was found that the absorbed microwave power is approximately equal to the irradiated power from the sample and that the main restriction mechanism of absortp tion in both cases is defined by the nonlinear radiation damping predicted about two decades ago we believe that the nonlinear radiation damping is a common feature of parallel pumping technique of all normal magnetic excitations and it can be detected by

is a powerful tool to study linear and nonlinear properties of magnetoordered systems ferromagnets antiferromagnets and fer rites 1 6 parallel pumping of magnetic excitations in which the microwave magnetic polarization is parallel to the external magnetic field is one of the most convenient and popular methods of parametric resonance a microwave magnetic field h t enhanced by a microwave resonator is applied to the sample parallel to its equilibrium magnetization which is parallel to the steady external magnetic field h the alternating magnetic field excites the parametric resonance of the form p k k where p is the pumping field frequency and k k are the half pump frequencies of excited in the sample parametric pair of waves with oppositly oriented wave vectors k and k the excited waves amplitudes grow exponentially when the microwave field amplitude h exceeds the parametric resonance threshold hc according to s theory 3 4 this growth is restricted by the nonlinearities of the magnetic system which are exhibited by a phase mis matching of the forced magnetic oscillations with the microwave field and b by the positive nonlinear magnetic relaxation due to nonlinearities of magnetic system in this theoretical picture the resonator cavity is considered to be just as an ancillary system that enhances microwave field amplitude on a sample no other effect associated with the microwave resonator cavity is assumed in this small sample approximation approach actually the process of parallel pumping includes two steps first the external microwave source excites the same frequency p microwave magnetic oscillation of the resonator cavity second this magnetic oscillation is absorbed by the parametic pair k and k of magnetic excitations of the sample in principle one can expect a backward radiation of the para metric pairs and a bunch of associated effects in the system of two interacting in resonance oscillations however in the simple picture of small sample approximation this backward radiation is assumed to be negligibly small compared to absorption only an energy flow from the microwave pump to the sample occurs notwithstading that examples of non trivial role of microwave resonator to the process of 2 parallel pumping of magnetic excitations have already been discussed in refs 7 11 these facts did not attract much attention and the small sample approximation approach is still in wide use for the description of parallel pumping of magnetic oscillations the main focus of the present paper is to demonstrate that theoretically predicted two decades ago 7 8 nonlinear radiation damping effect due to backward irradiation of parametric pairs to the resonator is a common and dominant feature in the process of parallel pumping of magnetic excitations in this paper we studied parallel pumping in a helical resonator of a nuclear spin waves in an antiferromagnetic csmnf 3 at liquid helium temperatures and b magnetoelastic waves in an antiferromagnetic febo 3 at liquid nitrogen temperatures the concept of nuclear spin waves was introduced by de gennes et al 12 the nuclear spin wave denotes the magnetic excitation of mixed electronic and nuclear spin oscillations that is situated in the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency range the most remarkable property of these excitations is that at liquid helium temperatures they exhibit the cou pled oscillations of two completely different in their magnetic properties subsystems the electronic spins are ordered while the state of the nuclear spins is paramagnetic the polar ization is no more than several percent as a result of mixing of these two subsystems by hyperfine interaction the frequency of the electronic spin waves increases and the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency n 0 decreases and becomes noticeably lower than the larmor precession frequency n of nuclear spins in other words there arises the so called dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance pulling and the band of nuclear spin waves n k n k n 1 h hf e k 2 1 2 1 where e k h h hd h 2 hf k 2 1 2 is the frequency of electronic spin wave hd is the dzyaloshinskii field h 2 hf 1 t is the gap due to hyperfine interaction is the exchange constant and is the gyromagnetic ratio the detailed review of nuclear spin wave properties in weakly anisotropic antiferromagnets is given in ref 13 magnetoelastic waves describe normal modes of linearly coupled elastic waves and elec tronic spin waves in magnetoordered crystals so far as the magnetoelastic waves contain both elastic and magnetic components they can be excited both by elastic vibrations and by alternating magnetic field one of the most interesting objects to study magnetoelastic 3 waves is the high n el temperature antiferromagnet febo 3 tn 348 k parallel pump ing of magnetoelastic waves in this crystal for the first time was observed in ref 14 the spectrum of magnetoelastic waves in iron borate can be written as 11 me k cek 1 h ef ek 2 1 2 2 where ce is the sound velocity h ef describes an efficiency of linear interaction between spin and elastic subsystems e k h h hd h 2 me k 2 1 2 is the frequency of electronic spin wave and h me is the field which corresponds to magnetoelastic gap we show that beyond the small sample approximation the resonator oscillation dynamics plays an extremely important role in the process of parametric resonance of nuclear spin waves and magnetoelastic waves and gives the dominant mechanism of parallel pumping restriction in both cases by the nonlinear radiation damping ii experiment the experimental absorbing cell is shown in fig 1 the sample is placed in an open helical resonator which is a half wavelength dipole excited by the pulsed microwave pumping field h t the inner diameter of the helix equals 0 5 cm and the diameter of the copper wire is 0 5 mm to a first approximation the wire length needed to make the helix is 2 which is about 15 cm for 1 ghz the effective volume of this resonator is estimated as 200 mm 3 the effect of microwave absorption is detected by the receiving antenna this absorbing cell to study parallel pumping of nuclear spin waves and magnetoelastic waves was used at different temperature conditions parametric pairs of nuclear spin waves were excited by a pulsed 300 2000 s parallel microwave pump with repeating frequency 10 100 hz in the helical resonator with the quality factor q 300 500 over a wide range of frequencies p 600 1200 mhz the measurements were made on single crystal sample vs 3 3 5 mm 3 of the easy plane antiferromagnet csmnf 3 tn 53 5 k at liquid helium temperatures t 1 9 4 2 k and magnetic fields h 500 2000 oe the ratio of the sample volume to the volume of resonator was vs vr 0 2 the relaxation rate of parametically excited spin waves estimated by the threshold amplituede was k 2 6 20 khz with the accuracy of 25 a typical form of the microwave pump pulse passed thorough the resonator is shown in 4 figure 1 schematic diagramm of the experimental absorbing cell the left side of fig 2 there is a microwave absortpion by the parametric pairs upper part of the pulse which is demonstrated by the decrease of the pump pulse at the end of the pulse one can see a general phenomenon a non uniform time dependence with a peak of the microwave radiation after the pump pulse a typical oscillation of the microwave pulse which appears above the threshold of parametric resonance we could observe this non trivial radiation at p pc 1 1 the peak demonstrates a beating of magnetic oscillation of the resonator cavity mode with the parametic pair 9 in this case the lineshape of the cavity sample system becomes splitted into two humps 10 which is a direct indication that the small sample approximation is not valid any more experimentally we observed one peak if the pump frequency was equal to the frequency of the resonator p r and up to three beating peaks if p 6 r it should be noted that below the threshold of parametric resonance the microwave radiation after the pump pulse demonstrates just an exponential decrease see curve 2 in fig 2 which corresponds to unloaded resonator cavity irradiation parametric pairs of magnetoelastic waves were excited in the vs 20 mm 3 sample of the easy plane antiferromagnet febo 3 by the pulsed microwave field of the frequency p 2 900 1200 mhz at magnetic fields h 30 500 oe at liquid nitrogen temperature t 77 k the ratio of the sample volume to the volume of resonator was vs vr 0 1 we observed similar effects of the non uniform radiation from the cavity sample system after the end of mirowave pump pulse as in the case of nuclear spin waves typical experimental data of irradiation are shown in fig 3 we found very important feature of experiments with irradiation the radiation power is approximately equal to the absorption power thus the stationary state of parametric pairs is defined by the radiation from the sample through the sample resonator nonlinear 5 figure 2 left a typical form of the microwave pumping pulse passed through the helical resonator one can see a microwave absorption by the sample upper part and a non uniform radi ation effect after the end of mirowave pumping right curve 1 demonstrates a non monotonic radiation power signal from the sample after the pump pulse was turned off the pumping

h 1840 oe interaction iii discussion let us consider the monotonically decreasing time dependence of radiated power behind the beating peak the decrease of the parametric pairs number nk t is described by the equation dnk 2 nk dt where nk k nlnk is the relaxation rate k is the linear and nlnk is the nonlinear parts respectively integrating of this equation one obtains nk t k nl u exp 2 k t t 0 1 3 where u 1 k nlnk t 0 t 0 is the starting time t t 0 if we assume that the nonlinear part of damping is entirely defined by nonlinear radiation damping then the radiated power prad t can be

fit of formula 4 see the text a nuclear spin waves a typical time slope for radiation power is shown in fig 4 mean square fit using formula 4 with t 0 0 8 s gives h p 2 2 k nl 1 8 10 4 w and k nlnk 0 8 s 9 05 10 2 the linear relaxation rate calculated from the threshold of parallel pumping is k 4 46 104 s 1 thus we obtain nl 1 6 10 11 s 1 and nlnk 0 8 s 4 93 105 s 1 which is one 7 order greater than the linear relaxation rate k the number of parametric pairs at t 0 0 8 s is equal to nk 0 8 s 3 1 1016 this esimate for the number of parametric pairs is in agreement with the estimate obtained in ref 15 from the susceptibility in the overthreshold region note that the obtained result is stable to the variation of k for example if we take linear relaxation rate say 40 greater k 6 24 104 s 1 then from the fit one gets nlnk 0 8 s 4 64 105 s 1 nl 1 4 10 11 s 1 and nk 0 8 s 3 3 1016 we see that the accuracy of the threshold does not seriously affect the nonlinear damping term due to relatively small value of linear damping let us now compare experiment and theory the theoretical formula for the coefficient of nonlinear radiation damping can be expressed in the form theor nl r 2 h q v 2 k vr 5 where vk is the coupling coefficient for the parametric pair with the pump field in the res onator cavity in other words it is proportional to an effective magnetic moment h n k h of excited wave for nuclear spin waves one has 13 16 vk 1 2 n k h 2 n 4 n k 4 h hf 2 2 h hd 4 e k 6 the factor r in eq 5 depends on the geometry of resonator cavity for a rectangular resonator cavity one has r 1 for a helical resonator a compression of half wavelength 2 to the length of helix l occrus and it can result in r 2 l let us estimate theoretical nonlinear radiation damping eq 5 for the experiment shown in fig 4 using the following parameters n 2 666 mhz hd 0 h 2 hf 6 4 t k koe 2 l 1 cm one gets theor nl 0 6 10 11 which of the order of magnitude is in a good agreement with the obtained experimental result b magnetoelastic waves let us consider the experimental results shown in fig 3 for magnetoelastic waves the linear relaxation rate calculated from the threshold of parallel pumping in this case is k 3 2 105 s 1 from the mean square fit using formula 4 with t 0 0 4 s one gets 1 8 figure 5 magnetic field dependence for the nonlinear radiation damping coefficient

order of magnitude is in a good agreement with the obtained experimental result dots in fig 5 show the magnetic field dependence of experimentally obtained coefficient of nonlinear radiation damping the solid line represents the theoretical prediction of the field dependence we see a perfect fit within two orders of magnitude of experimental data for nonlinear radiation damping iv conclusion in this work we have experimentally confirmed that the nonlinear radiation damping is the main mechanism of parametic instability restriction during parallel microwave pumping of two different types of normal magnetic oscillations nuclear spin waves and magnetoelastic waves in different antiferromagnets the obtained results are in a good agreement with the 9 theory by the field and overthreshold dependencies and are of the order of magnitude of the theoretical prediction we believe that the nonlinear radiation damping is a common feature of parallel pumping technique and it can be detected by the purposeful experiments with other types of normal magnetic oscillations in magnetoordered systems for example a specific radiation after turning off the pump of spin waves in yig has already been observed in ref 17 and it was not explained in the framework of small sample approximation 1 h suhl j phys chem solids 1 209 1957 2 e schoemann phys rev 116 827 1959 3 v e zakharov v s l vov and s s
