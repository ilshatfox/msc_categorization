lenses alard c iap 98 bis boulevard arago paris july 5 th 2016 abstract the extension of the singular perturbative approach to the second order is presented in this paper the general expansion to the second order is derived the second order expansion is considered as a small correction to the first order expansion using this approach it is demonstrated that the second order expansion is reducible to a first order expansion via a re definition of the first order pertubative fields even if in practice the second order correction is small the reducibility of the second order expansion to the first order expansion indicates a degeneracy problem in general this degeneracy is hard to break a useful and simple second order approximation is the thin source approximation which offers a direct estimation of the correction the practical application of the corrections derived in this paper are illustrated by using an elliptical nfw lens model the second order pertubative expansion provides a noticeable improvement even for the simplest case of thin source approximation to conclude it is clear that for accurate modelisation of gravitational lenses using the perturbative method the second order perturbative expansion should be considered in particular an evaluation of the degeneracy due to the second order term should be performed for which the thin source approximation is particularly useful key words gravitational lensing strong 1 introduction the singular perturbative method is a non parametric approach to gravitational lenses offering a direct relation between the description of the lens and the observations the direct relation between the lens and the data minimize the degeneracy problems generally encountered in gravitational c 2015 the authors http arxiv org abs 1607 01365 v 1 2 alard c lenses modeling see for instance saha williams 2006 wucknitz 2002 chiba takahashi 2002 in a series of papers alard 2007 alard 2009 alard 2010 the first order singular perturbative method was considered let s first recall the basics of the first order method we consider a perturbation of the perfect ring situation a perfect ring is obtained when a point source is at the center of a circular potential the images of the central point source is an infinity of points situated on a circle the radius of this circle is the einstein radius associated with the circular potential for simplicity the einstein radius is reduced to unity by adopting a proper set of distance units the introduction of a non circular perturbation to the circular potential results in the breaking of the circle with the consequence that the central point has now a finite number of images in the vicinity of the circle in practice the source itself is not reduced to a point but has a finite size which is of the order of the potential perturbation additionally the source may not be exactly at the center of the circular potential and as a consequence has an impact parameter which is also of the order of the potential perturbation which we call with 1 using polar coordinates r in the lens plane the potential reads r 0 r r 1 the lens equation relating the lens plane coordinates r to the source plane coordinates rs reads rs r 2 the radial deviation from the circle is of the same order as the potential perturbation thus r 1 dr by inserting eq 1 in the lens equation and developing to the first order in we obtain a set of equations already presented in alard 2007 rs 2 dr f 1 ur d f 0 d u 3 and f 1 r r 1 f 0 1 2 1 d 2 0 dr 2 4 considering that the source has an impact parameter r 0 x 0 y 0 it is useful to re write eq 3 using the variable rs r s r 0 r s 2 dr f 1 ur d f 0 d u 5 with f i fi x 0 cos y 0 sin i 0 1 6 mnras 000 1 2015 second order lensing expansion 3 2 second order expansion the perturbative development of the perfect circle situation is not limited to the first order in the expansion may be carried out to any order it is particularly useful to extend the expansion to the second order to obtain higher accuracy and quality in the reconstruction of the lens to carry out the second order expansion we introduce an additional field in the potential r 0 r r r f 0 f 1 r 1 f 2 r 1 2 2 f 2 r r 1 7 inserting in eq 2 and developing to second order in r s 2 dr 3 dr 2 2 f 1 f 2 dr ur d f 0 d d f 1 d d f 0 d dr u 8 with 3 d 3 0 dr 3 r 1 the order of eq 8 in dr implies that for circular source contours the equation for dr is of fourth order instead of second order for the first order expansion alard 2007 however in the regime dr 1 the effect of the second order terms is only to introduce a small perturbation of the first order expansion consequently the dr expansion reads dr dr 1 dr 2 9 where dr 1 corresponds to the first order expansion and dr 2 is the second order correction by re expanding eq 8 to second order in using eq 9 we obtain r s 2 dr f 1 3 dr 21 2 f 2 dr 1 ur d f 0 d d f 1 d d f 0 d dr 1 u 10 it is straightforward to reduce eq 10 to the first order expansion eq 5 by making the following substitutions f 1 f 1 3 dr 21 2 f 2 dr 1 d f 0 d d f 0 d d f 1 d d f 0 d dr 1 11 note that the second order correction to the fields presented in eq 11 can be iterated once the fields have been corrected new positions for the images can be estimated and used as new entries to estimate another correction for the fields by iterating this process a full convergence to the second order expansion is obtained a useful approximation is to consider thin arcs assuming that the size of the source is of second order the first order expansion is reduced to dr 1 f 1 2 as a mnras 000 1 2015 4 alard c consequence for thin arcs the second order expansion reads r s 2 dr f 1 3 f 21 2 22 f 1 f 2 2 ur d f 0 d d f 1 d d f 0 d f 1 2 u 12 in the thin arc approximation it is possible to derive an explicit substitution to recover the first order expansion f 1 f 1 3 f 21 2 22 f 2 f 1 2 d f 0 d d f 0 d d f 1 d d f 0 d f 1 2 13 the corrective terms in eq 13 could be included in f 1 and f 0 or be considered as genuine order 2 corrections as a consequence eq 13 describes explicitly the degeneracy in the reconstruction of the fields breaking this degeneracy is difficult since it would require information at sufficient radial distance for the same angular position which is very hard to find in practice the best op portunity to break this degeneracy would be to have several sources situated at different distances and thus having different effective einstein radius 3 practical implementation by using a numerical experiment we consider the contour of a circular source situated near the caustic of a nfw halo lens the potential for an elliptical nfw halo is meneghetti etal 2003 u 1 1 ln 2 g u u 1 x 2 1 y 2 14 the parameter is related to the ellipticity of the halo the potential normalization implies that the associated einstein radius equal to the typical halo size which is a common situation for gravitational lenses the definition of the function g u reads g u 1 2 ln u 2 2 2 arctan 2 u 1 u 1 u 1 2 arctanh 2 1 u u 1 u 1 15 the source configuration in the potential defined in eq 14 is presented in fig 1 with the images of the source circular contour all reconstructions of the circular source contour with radius r 0 are performed using the first order formula alard 2007 and the modified fields defined in eq s 11 and 13 for the second order reconstructions the first order circular contour equation is 2 dr f 1 r 20 d f 0 d 2 16 mnras 000 1 2015 second order lensing expansion 5 figure 1 the source position and its associated images for the nfw lens the images contours black corresponds to the circular source contour red the diamond shaped curve at the center corresponds to the caustics of the nfw elliptical lens the results obtained in fig 2 indicates that the first order reconstruction is not very accurate for the left image all second order expansions provide a clear improvement in accuracy even the simplest second order expansion the thin source approximation see eq s 12 and 13 already rep resents a significant improvement over the first order expansion the first iteration of the second order expansion see eq s 10 and 11 is more accurate than the thin source approximation iter ating the second order allows to reach the level of accuracy corresponding precisely to the second order perturbative expansion the results for the right image see fig 3 are similar although the first order approximation is noticeably more accurate for this image mnras 000 1 2015 6 alard c figure 2 a detailed view of the left image see 1 the actual image contour black is super imposed with the first order reconstruction blue the second order thin source approximation light blue the first iteration of the second order reconstruction green and the iterated second order reconstruction red 4 conclusion it is relatively simple to estimate the second order perturbative expansion as a correction of the first order expansion in particular the correction in the thin source limit is simple and provide a noticeable improvement over the first order pertubative expansion the full iterative second order correction converge to the second order perturbative correction but in most cases provides only a small additional improvement with respect to the thin source approximation additionally it is interesting to note that larger sources can always be de composed in a number of thinner sources for which the thin source approximation is valid another important issue is the problem of the degeneracy of the second order correction even if in most case the correction is small the problem of the possible degeneracy of first order expansion should be addressed for an evaluation of the amplitude of the degenerate term the thin source approximation should be particularly useful as it offers a direct estimation in some particular application when the degeneracy of the second order term can be broken the full estimation of the second order expansion should be useful references alard c 2007 mnras letters 382 58 alard c 2009 a a 506 609 alard c 2010 a a 513 39 mnras 000 1 2015
