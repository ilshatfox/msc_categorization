pne is analysed by measuring the expansion veloc ities vexp of different ions as derived from their collisionally excited lines cels and optical recombination lines orls vexp are analysed as a function of the ionisation potential of ions that at first approximation represents the distance of the ion to the central star in most cases the kinematics of orls is incompatible with the kinematics of cels at the same ionisation potential specially if cels and orls of the same ion are considered in general vexp from orls is lower than vexp from cels indicating that if the gas is in ionisation equilibrium orls are emitted by a gas located closer to the central star the velocity field derived from cels shows a gradient accelerating outwards as predicted from hydrodynamic modelling of pne ionisation structures the velocity field derived from orls is different in many cases the velocity gradient is flatter or nonexistent and high and low ionised species present nearly the same vexp in addition the fwhm orls is usually smaller that the fwhm cels our inter pretation is that orls are mainly emitted by a plasma that coexists with the plasma emitting cels but does not fit the ionisation structures predicted by models such a plasma should have been ejected in a different event that the plasma emitting cels key words ism kinematics and dynamics planetary nebulae general planetary

low intermediate mass 1 m m 8 m hot evolved star the gas was part of the stellar atmosphere and was ejected by the star at low velocity of about 10 km s 1 in advanced stages of evolution while the star was pass ing through the phases of giant asymptotic giant branch agb thus the nebula is expanding away from the star with a velocity that depends on the ejection processes as well as on thermal processes the ionisation structure and the interaction of the nebula with the stellar winds and the interstellar medium based on data obtained at las campanas observatory carnegie institution this

lines total abundances are obtained by considering all the ions detected in the gas and including the not visible ions by using ionisation correction factors icfs or other procedures as already said ionic abundances can be derived by us ing cels or orls in the following ions emitting cels are marked with square parenthesis e g o iii 5007 while ions emitting orls do not show parenthesis e g o ii

been atributed to temperature fluctuations e g peimbert 1967 1971 tiny metal rich inclusions embedded in the h rich plasma liu et al 2006 and references therein gas inhomogeneities or other processes for instance kappa distribution of electron energy nicholls et al 2012 the first two proposals would imply that cels and orls would be emitted in zones of different temperatures in the nebula because cels are highly dependent on the electron temper ature thus cels are emitted in zones of high temperature while orls are much less dependent on electron tempera ture and they would be emitted mainly in low temperature zones since several years ago some authors have indicated that the orls and cels of the same ion seem to show differ ent kinematical behaviour or different physical distribution in the nebula in several objects recombination lines of o 2 appear to show lower expansion velocities than o 2 colli sionally excited lines e g the case of bb 1 presented by otsuka et al 2010 or the emission of orls of c 2 and o 2 strongly peaks towards the nebular centre such as the cases of ngc 6153 liu et al 2000 ngc 7009 luo liu 2003 ngc 6720 garnet dinerstein 2001 abell 46 and ou 5 corradi et al 2015 and ngc 6778 jones et al 2016 also hf 2 2 a pn with a very large adf of 70 presents the same phenomenon liu et al 2006 on the other hand other pne do not show differences between the kinemati cal behaviour or physical distribution of orls and cels otsuka et al 2009 there is also an interesting work by barlow et al 2006 who from very high resolution spectra found that orls from o 2 were narrower than cels from the same ion in two pne more recently the situation appears more complicated because richer et al 2013 have analysed in detail spa tially and velocity resolved spectroscopy of orls and cels for the same ions in ngc 7009 finding that the lines show discrepant kinematics and location kinematics of orls is incompatible with the ionisation structure given by cels these authors suggest that there is an additional plasma component and that emission of recombination lines arises from a different volume from that giving rise to the forbid den emission from the parent ions within this nebula also garc a rojas et al 2016 from direct imaging made with tunable filters of the faint orl emission found that the emissions of the orls o ii 4649 50 and cel o iii 5007 have different spacial distribution in ngc 6778 these authors argue that these differences are consistent with the presence of a h deficient gas where orls would be emitted and they suggest that the origin of such a h deficient plasma may be linked to the binarity of the central star besides they found that the distribution of the emission of the o iii 4363 line sensitive to the electron temperature strongly peaks in a region more centrally located than the o iii 5007 line indicating a temperature gradient in the nebula considering the above we have decided to study a sam ple of pne ionised by different types of central stars wc stars weak emission line stars wels and normal stars for which we have very good quality high resolution spectra in order to explore the possibility that orls and cels are emitted by gas at different conditions for this we analyse the kinematics of the nebular structure given by both types of lines their line widths and their profiles by using very high resolution spectra where the lines are well resolved most of the spectra were obtained with the magellan in amori kyocera echelle spectrograph mike berstein et al 2003 attached to the 6 5 m magellan telescope clay at las campanas observatory chile these data have been already analysed to derive physical conditions and chemical abun dances from orls and cels and to determine the adfs for

termined for the objects line intensities were used by g r 2009 and g r 2013 to derive ionic and total abundances from orls and cels and to compute the adf for each ob ject the adfs for this pn sample are moderate in a range from 1 2 to 3 7 due to the high spectral resolution of our data mike has r 28000 for a 1 slit width in most cases the lines are split showing blue and red components coming from the front and back zones of the expanding shell e g pc 14 cn 1 5 ngc 2867 in a few cases the lines appear as a single component or show evidence of several overlapped compo nents e g m 1 61 and pb 8 in fig 1 we show the profiles of the auroral cel o iii 4363 and the orl o ii 4649 for the objects in our sample the line profiles were measured with iraf splot routine by fitting a gaussian profile to the single lines in the cases where the lines are split close two gaussian profiles were adjusted in order to deblend the components thus the ob served central wavelength and the gaussian full width at half maximum fwhm were determined for several orls and cels in each object in every case line widths were corrected for the instrumental width considering that they add in quadrature instrumental widths were adopted from the instrumental spectral resolution of mike spectrograph 0 15 a in the blue wavelength range and 0 22 a in the red one thermal widths were not corrected therefore line widths include thermal broadening and also turbulence and physical structure of the nebula along the line of view results are presented in table 2 available on line here we present only an example where column 1 gives ion id column 2 the observed central wavelength column 3 the rest wavelength column 4 presents the measured fwhm of the line column 5 the observed radial velocity and column 6 the expansion velocity measured for the line the average expansion velocities vexp and the average fwhm for the blue components in case of split lines from orls or cels for each ion are at the end of the ion list the associated uncertainty corresponds to the dispersion of all the cel or orl values for each ion at one sigma the formal uncer tainty due to the gaussian fit of lines is not included in this value in general this uncertainty is small depending of the rms value of the adjacent continuum and the signal to noise of the line which most of the times is better than 10 the comparison of vexp for different lines of the same ion provides the real uncertainty the same procedure was applied to data from the litera ture for ngc 7009 and ngc 3918 the values for ngc 7009 were extracted from richer et al 2013 and the values for ngc 3918 from the deep high resolution spectrum presented by garc a rojas et al 2015 obtained with the uves spec 1 iraf is distributed by the

as half the difference between the blue and red compo nents of lines which is a good measurement of the expansion velocity if the nebula is well resolved gesicki zijlstra 2000 for the few objects with single lines the expansion velocity vexp was assumed to be half the fwhm which is a good approach for a unresolved or partially resolved nebula gesicki zijlstra 2000 although in this case the fwhm includes the expansion as well as thermal broadening turbu lence nebular structure etc in most cases we are measur ing the expansion velocity of the bright zone of the shell and not the true expansion velocity which for a multishell nebula could happen in a fainter outer zone see scho nberner et al 2014 for a deep discussion of the expansion velocity struc ture as our intention is to compare the same parameter for orls and cels this is a valid approach for each ion vexp were measured for all available cels or orls and the average values were calculated for cels and orls separately average vexp derived this way are presented in graphic form as a function of the ionisation potential ip for the different ions for each object figs 2 and 3 the errors in velocity correspond to 1 deviation of the average except for the cases where only one line was measured in which case 1 km s 1 was adopted for these graphs we have chosen the ip because for a plasma in ionisation equilibrium there exists a stratification of the ionisation structure within the nebula where it is found that highly ionised species are near the central star while the low ionised species are farther away therefore in some way the ip represents the distance of the ion location relative to the central star see e g fig 2 6 by osterbrock ferland 2006 mnras 000 1 15 2017 kinematics of orls and cels in pne 5 figure 1 line profiles of the auroral cel o iii 4363 and the orl o ii 4649 of pne analysed in this work ngc 7009 is not shown mnras 000 1 15 2017 6 m pen a et al 3 behaviour of expansion velocities in the graphs presented in figs 2 and 3 we plot for all the analysed objects the expansion velocity of each ion as derived from the average of its orls in red and the average of its cels in blue as a function of its ip for an easy way of comparing the behaviour of different objects in fig 2 we include all the pne whose ip of ions cover up to 50 ev these are relatively low excitation nebulae while in fig 3 the highly ionised nebulae are presented in these figures we have not included the velocities mea sured for the permitted lines of n i and o i although they are listed in table 2 because these lines could be mainly excited by direct starlight therefore they would not be bona fide recombination lines grandi 1975 and their emission would be produced outside the ionised nebula on the other hand grandi 1976 has also claimed that permitted lines from si may be excited mainly by starlight and they would not be produced by recombination of si 2 a similar situation occurs with the uv permitted lines of o iii 3443 3759 3757 and others which have been declared to be excited by the bowen mechanism bowen 1935 therefore they would not correspond to lines from recombination of o 3 the efficiency of such a mechanism is not clear however kaler 1967 thus we have decided to keep these lines in our analysis considering them as from pure recombination in order to determine the kinematical behaviour of the ions emitting them considering the velocities given by cels blue dots in general it is found that most nebulae present a clear gradient in velocity as a consequence of the ionisation structure in an expanding shell where the highly ionised species which due to the ionisation structure are the nearest to the central star show the lowest expansion velocities while the low ionisation species show larger vexp that is the expansion velocity in creases with the distance to the central star in agreement with hydrodynamical models for pne by e g scho nberner steffen 1999 2000 which always show velocities increas ing with the distance to the central star these models are computed by assuming that pne are modelled by the in teraction of the stellar winds of a unique central star thus the kinetic energy in the expanding shell can be seen as the original kinetic energy of the agb wind plus the amount deposited by the fast wind from the post agb pn core the original agb wind has a near constant velocity with radius and in hydrodynamical models the gradient in the pn veloc ity field is caused by the interacting winds and the ionisation structure scho nberner et al 2014 the pne showing this increase in vexp cels with ra dius are he 2 86 m 1 30 pe 1 1 hb 4 m 1 61 ngc 3918 ngc 7009 pc 14 and ngc 2867 that is 9 objects of a to tal of 14 also cn 1 5 and m 1 25 show increasing vexp with the radius although in these cases it is marginal because only the low ionisation species fe ii fe iii and ni ii are showing high expansion velocities all the others including s ii cl ii n ii and o ii show vexp values similar to the ones of highly ionised species in our sample there are some objects not showing a gradient in the velocities given by cels they are m 3 15 m 1 32 and pb 8 these cases will be discussed in detail later but here we say in advance that m 3 15 and m 1 32 show a very low vexp of about 11 14 km s 1 and this oc curs because both objects present a toroidal form where the toroid is on or near the plane of the sky rechy garc a et al 2017 therefore the expansion velocity of the plasma in the toroid is almost perpendicular to the line of sight also pb 8 shows a very flat gradient with vexp of about 15 km s 1 ex cept for the highest ionizing species that have ver low vexp probably the flat gradient is due to this compact nebula has an ellipsoidal morphology and it could be a relatively flat system oriented on or near the sky plane a very interesting result which is evident from an in spection of figs 2 and 3 is that in most cases the expansion velocities measured from orls red points appear smaller than the values given by cels for the same ionisation poten tial besides in several cases vexp orls show no gradient or an almost flat gradient and such a gradient runs below or crosses the gradient observed for cels therefore for these cases the velocity field derived from cels is incom patible with the velocity field given by orls this is evident if orls and cels velocities for the same ion for instance o 2 are compared see columns 6 and 7 in table 3 in most cases both velocities do not coincide as expected and vexp cels are larger than vexp orls this would be in dicating that for a certain ion its orls would be emitted mainly in zones closer to the central star than its cels it should be mentioned here that vexp orls of si ii and o iii whose permitted lines were considered to be pro duced by recombination show no particular discrepancy in position relative to other ions with similar ip on the con trary if we assume that the si ii lines are excited by starlight their position in the vexp vs ip figures should be moved to ip 8 15 ev ip value for si and this would produce a large discrepancy with the vexp of ions emitting cels at the same ip the same occurs for o iii if its lines are excited by the bowen mechanism its position in the vexp vs ip di agram should be moved to ip 35 12 ev ip value for o 2 and in several cases this would produce a large discrepancy with the points corresponding to vexp o iii and vexp o ii which are at this ip we discuss this for each object individ ually objects where both vexp cels and vexp orls show a gradient are he 2 86 m 1 30 pe 1 1 hb 4 and ngc 2867 and most of the times vexp orls are below vexp cels at the same ip the implications of this will be discussed in detail in next sections objects where vexp orls show no gradient or a very flat one are cn 1 5 where vexp orls are in the range 24 26 km s 1 m 1 25 with vexp orls of about 19 km s 1 m 1 61 with vexp orls 16 km s 1 and ngc 7009 with vexp orls 17 18 km s 1 without considering he i which is an ion distributed in a large zone of the nebula thus in these objects the ions emitting orls present about the same expansion velocity independently of their ionisa tion degree this is a very unusual situation in a pn plasma indicating that the ionised gas emitting orls is in a zone with a constant expansion velocity this gas is rich in heavy elements and it is already ionised but possible it is not in ionisation equilibrium therefore it does not show the usual stratification found in photoionised plasmas this gas is ex panding at a lower velocity than the plasma emitting cels therefore it is possible that this gas had been ejected by the central star in a subsequent epoch than the ejection of the low metallicity gas mnras 000 1 15 2017 kinematics of orls and cels in pne 7 some interesting objects in our sample are those show ing the lowest orl velocities they are m 1 61 which presents vexp orls 15 km s 1 while vexp cels go from 10 to 22 km s 1 this nebula is ionised by a wels it has a density ne 22200 cm 3 and a radius of 0 029 pc he 2 86 which presents vexp orls from 7 to 9 km s 1 and vexp cels from 8 to 14 km s 1 it is ionised by a wc 4 star has a density ne 23300 cm 3 and a radius of 0 035 pc and pe 1 1 which has a density of ne 31100 cm 3 a radius of 0 039 pc and presents also a small velocity gradient for orls from 11 to 14 km s 1 while vexp cels go from 10 to 17 km s 1 these three pne are the most compact ones in our sample with a radius smaller than 0 04 pc and they are very dense therefore they should be the youngest pne analised here other object with high density is m 1 25 this pn shows a very flat gradient for orls from 18 6 km s 1 for si ii up to 20 2 km s 1 for o ii and it has a density of ne 15100 cm 3 a radius of 0 052 pc and it is ionised by a wc 5 6 star all these objects are compact young and dense and their vexp are very low in particular the ones calculated from orls other similarity among these pne is that the difference vexp o iii vexp o ii is smaller than 0 4 km s 1 in m 1 25 this difference is negative 0 9 km s 1 therefore it is found that the youngest pne in our sample show the lowest orls expansion velocities from all the above we conclude that our results indi cate in many cases that orls and cels present dissimilar kinematics and orls and cels of the same ion seem to be produced in different zones of the nebula orls showing lower vexp would be emitted mainly in zones closer to the central star than the gas emitting cels 4 the fwhm of lines in the cases where two components approaching and reced ing were found the measurements were made separately by fitting two gaussian profiles thus the line width of each component is not affected by the expansion velocity only turbulence thermal broadening and nebular structure along the line of sight are included in the fwhm in most cases occur that the fwhm of orls is nar rower than the fwhm of cels this is evident by compar ing the fwhm of orls and cels coming from the same ion for instancerecombination lines of o ii compared with forbidden lines of o iii or lines of ne ii and ne iii veloc ities and fwhm of lines of o ii and o iii are presented in table 3 for the objects with split components we have in cluded only the fwhm of the blue component because the values and behaviour of the red component are very similar if a similar turbulence is assumed for all the plasma the lower fwhm of orls is indicating that the material emitting these lines is at a lower temperature than the gas emitting cels our resut is in agreement with values of tem peratures measured for orls and cels where te orls is in general lower on occasions by several thousand degrees than the temperature derived from cels see e g wesson et al 2005 zhang et al 2005 mcnabb et al 2013 fang liu 2013 in several pne te has been estimated from lines of he i and from recombination lines of o 2 and n 2 these te orls are in average several hundred degree lower than te cels the gas emitting orls is not necessarily a h deficient gas but it should be a gas richer in heavy elements than the one emitting cels in order to be at lower temper ature 5 individual objects 5 1 pn g 002 2 09 4 cn 1 5 this pn ionised by a wo 4 pec star is n rich a peimbert s type i pn and shows an adf o 2 of 1 9 its

it shows a bright barrel shape with open ends and an irregular structure in the interior the slit crossed the central position and all the lines cels and orls are well split see fig 1 therefore we fit a gaussian profile to the blue and red components indepen dently partial results for this object have been published in the proceedings of iau symposium no 323 pen a et al 2017 in this work vexp of the ions as a function of ip are shown in fig 2 cels show a mild gradient in velocity the velocities go from vexp 25 26 km s 1 near the central star highly ionised species to vexp of about 30 32 km s

ionisation potential vexp cels are larger than vexp orls except for the case of he ii in particular vexp orls from low ionised species like si ii and c ii are much lower than velocities of cels at the

widths are larger for cels than for orls for the blue component 5 4 pn g 006 8 04 1 m 3 15 and pn g 011 9 04 2 m 1 32 these objects are discussed together because they present very similar morphology and also present some similar kine matical characteristics as discussed by rechy garc a et al 2017 both objects belong to the galactic bulge in both cases the pne are constituted by a toroid al most contained in the plane of the sky pole on toroid with ejections escaping from the poles at high velocities the jets get a velocity of about 180 km s 1 for m 1 32 and of about 90 km s 1 for m 3 15 sahai et al 2011 describe m 3 15 as l c bcr c thus it has a pair of collimated lobes and a barrel shape structure in the centre which would conform the toroid the fact that the main body of the nebulae the toroid is contained in the plane of the sky makes them to present low expansion velocities and the gradient of the velocity field is not noticeable however there are interesting differences regarding the orls and cels behaviour for m 3 15 the graph vexp vs ip fig 2 is very flat for cels and for orls vexp have a value of about 11 13 km s 1 for all the ions emitting cels on the other hand orls show also a flat but disperse behaviour with vexp for si ii c ii he i and ne ii between 12 and 13 km s 1 while o ii and n iii present vexp of 14 2 and 15 9 km s 1 respectively in this nebula orls present higher vexp than cels which is very noticeably in the cases of o iii compared to o ii and ne iii compared to ne ii the profiles in m 1 32 present a very intense single com ponent coming from the toroid and faint extended high velocity wings see fig 1 at the bottom for this work we have measured only the bright single component vexp vs ip graph for cels shows a similar behaviour to the one of m 3 15 there is no gradient in velocity and all the ions present vexp between 11 and 14 km s 1 except ca ii with vexp 16 6 km s 1 orls show also a flat vexp gradient with values around 11 to 14 km s 1 except vexp o ii which is 8 4 km s 1 in this nebula vexp o iii 12 5 km s 1 and vexp o ii are very discrepant thus in both nebulae the kinematics of cels emit ted by the toroidal component are similar but the orls present a different kinematics than cels and dissimilar in both cases the fwhm for cels is larger than for orls in m 1 32 but not in m 3 15 the analysis of these objects for which hydrodynam ical models have been computed allows us to understand the morphology and kinematics of other pne in this sam ple whose vexp vs ip graphs for cels present a similar

given by cels show a clear gradient with values from about 12 km s 1 in the zone near to the star up to 24 km s 1 in the outer zone velocities measured from orls show a flatter gradient with values from 14 to 16 km s 1 both gradients come across at the level of o 2 ionisation potential where the velocities of cels and orls coincide in the low ionisation extreme vexp from cels e g n ii and o ii are well above vexp si ii if the lines of si ii were excited by stellar photons the si ii point should be moved to a lower ip of 8 15 ev increasing by much the difference of this point with the ones of n ii and o ii this object shows the permitted lines of o iii if they are considered as from recombination of o 3 its vexp posi tion agrees with the gradient showed by orls if they are considered as excited by the bowen mechanism the point should be moved to ip 35 12 ev where it would coincide within uncertainties with the points representing o iii and o ii thus in this case we can not affirm if these lines are from recombination or excited by the bowen mechanism again in this case the velocity fields from orls and cels are incompatible orls seem to be emitted in a dif ferent plasma possibly closer to the central star 5 6 pn g 037 7 34 5 ngc 7009 this is an extended and complex multishell nebula ra dius of 0 076 pc ionised by a normal hot central star its age is about 3700 yr liu et al

kinematics of orls and cels in pne 11 additional plasma component and that the recombination lines arise in a different volume from that giving rise to the forbidden emissions from the parent ions by using richer et al 2013 data we measured the splitting of lines and plot the vexp vs ip graph in fig 3 this graph shows that cels have slightly larger expansion velocities than orls of the same ion e g see the cases of o iii and o ii ne iii and ne ii that is the kinematics of cels and orls differs in the same sense that in the other objects velocity fields of orls and cels are incompatible confirming the results by richer et al 2013 this nebula also shows permitted lines of o iii in the graph they are considered as produce by recombination and show an average velocity of 17 4 0 3 km s 1 if they were excited by the bowen mechanism the point should be moved to ip 35 12 ev and it would be discrepant with o iii vexp 19 1 0 7 km s 1 although it could be considered similar to o ii vexp 18 0 0 4 km s 1 within uncertain ties therefore the permitted lines of o iii could be produced by the bowen mechanism when compared to o ii recombi nation lines 5 7 pn g 278 1 05 9 ngc 2867 this is an

similar 0 25 a and 0 27 a respectively this nebula shows permitted lines of o iii they are considered as produced by recombination of o 3 and present an average velocity of 23 8 0 9 km s 1 if they were excited by the bowen mechanism the point should be moved to ip 35 12 ev and it would be discrepant with o iii vexp 27 3 0 3 but it would coincide within uncertainties with o ii vexp 24 2 0 1 therefore the permitted lines of o iii could be excited by the bowen mechanism 5 8 pn g 285 4 01 5 pe 1 1 this is a very compact dense and young pn ionised by a wc 4 central star its adf o 2 is 1 70 and its n o abundance ratio of 0 25 is normal it was classified by sahai et al 2011 as bipolar with close lobes and a barrel shape structure in the center our spectrum comes from the bright central structure and the slit passed through the central star the barrel shape is noticeable in the sense that cels and orls appear slightly split and can be safely deblended the expansion velocity is low no larger than 17 km s 1 for the low ionisation species and a clear gradient in the velocity field as given by cels is detected a similar gradi ent is shown by orls expansion velocities almost coincide for cels and orls although in general vexp orls are slightly lower than vexp cels the permitted lines of si ii are considered as produced by recombination and vexp si ii is well located in compar ison with vexp of n ii and o ii if the lines were excited by starlight the si ii point should be moved to ip 8 15 ev and it would be discrepant with the cels at this ip 5 9 pn g 292 4 04 1 pb 8 this pn is

single lines and no gradient is detected in the velocity field all the expansion velocities are lower than 16 km s 1 in particular vexp o iii 14 km s 1 and vexp o ii 13 km s 1 the highly ionised species lines from ar iv and n iii show even lower velocities this nebula was classified as an elliptical compact pn schwarz et al 1992 there is no high resolution image of this object but due to the behaviour of its velocity field and considering the cases of m 1 32 and m 3 15 it is probably a pole on toroid 5 10 pn g 294 6 04 7 ngc 3918 this highly ionised pn has a complex point symmetric mor

000 obtained with uves at vlt aiming to analyse the s processes in the cen tral star the same data is employed here to analyse the kinematics of cels and orls the spectrum was obtained from a slit passing at 3 8 arcsec north from the central star oriented e w see fig 1 by g r 2015 in this sense the ex pansion velocity measured is not the real expansion velocity but the radial projection of the velocity at that point the lines show a well split profile therefore we com puted vexp from cels and orls by fitting a gaussian pro file to each one of the components the graph vexp vs ip shows a clear gradient in the velocity field as given by cels the lines from the most highly ionised species k iv ar iv cl iv and kr iv show small vexp from 9 to 11 km s 1 at an intermediate vexp between 14 18 km s 1 we find ne iii o iii ar iii s iii cl iii and fe iii the largest velocities from 22 to 23 km s 1 occur for n ii o ii cl ii and s ii on the other hand vexp orls show a flatter gradient where ions with ip from 20 to 40 ev present vexp 15 km s 1 while the mnras 000 1 15 2017 12 m pen a et al most ionised species show vexp of about 12 km s 1 for this object vexp o iii is slightly lower than vexp o ii this nebula shows the permitted lines of si ii if these lines are produced by recombination vexp si ii coincides well with vexp of fe iii if the point for si ii is moved to 8 15 ev it would be discrepant with vexp of s ii and oth ers also vexp of permitted lines of o iii are plotted in the graph they are considered as from recombination and have an average velocity of 11 4 0 3 km s 1 if these lines were excited by the bowen mechanism the point should be moved to ip 35 12 ev and it would be very discrepant with both o iii vexp 13 9 0 4 and o ii vexp 15 2 0 1 there fore the permitted lines of si ii and o iii seem to be produced mainly by recombination of si 2 and o 3 respectively 5 11 pn g 300 7 02 0 he 2 86 this is a compact and young pn ionised by a wc 4 star it is very dense

and halo in the hst image it looks bipolar with a toroid in the center cels as well as orls appear almost blended a de blend of two gaussians can be made giving expansion veloc ities for cels from about 7 8 km s 1 for the highly ionised species to about 13 km s 1 for the low ionised ones there fore there is a clear gradient in the velocity field presented by cels see fig 2 the velocities given by orls are al ways slightly lower than the velocities of cels at the same ionisation potential therefore if we associate an expansion velocity with the distance to the central star again orls seem to be emitted in a zone closer to the central star than cels for the same ions this nebula shows the permitted lines of si ii coinciding well in expansion velocity with cels of fe iii if the point is moved to 8 15 ev it would be very discrepant with cels of s ii ni ii and others the low expansion velocities shown by the ions in this nebula seem to be related with the high density and youth of the nebula 5 12 pn g 336 3 06 9 pc 14 this bipolar nebula is ionised by a wo 4 central star it has an angular diameter of 7 a heliocentric distance of 5796 pc and a physical radius 0 087 pc frew et al

cels and orls are split in red and blue components which were measured indepen dently in fig 1 the line profiles of o iii 4363 and o ii 4649 4650 are shown it is evident that orls are narrower than the cels from table 3 fwhm o iii 0 46 0 07 a while fwhm o ii 0 39 0 09 a partial results for this object have been published in the proceedings of iau symposium no 323 pen a et al 2017 for completeness here we include the graph vexp vs ip see fig 3 where it is evident that vexp cels follow the velocity field of an expanding shell with velocities that go from about 20 km s 1 in the inner zone lines of ne iii ar iv k iv to 28 km s 1 in the outer zone lines of fe ii s ii n ii on the other hand orls show a gradient below the cels gradient orls from intermediate ionised species he c 2 n 2 o 2 ne 2 and c 3 present a nearly con stant velocity of about 20 22 km s 1 while orls from the highly ionised species o 3 n 2 and he 2 have a low vexp of about 16 18 km s 1 producing the effect of a gradi ent it seems evident that as far as cels and orls from the same ion do not share the same kinematics these lines are not being emitted in the same zone of the nebula orls seem to be emitted in an inner zone vexp from permitted lines of o iii is plotted in the graph these lines are considered as produced from recombination and have a vexp of 16 9 1 0 km s 1 if they were excited by the bowen mechanism the point should be moved to ip 35 12 ev and it would be very discrepant with both o iii vexp 22 2 0 4 and o ii vexp 20 9 1 9 there fore the permitted lines of o iii seem to be produced mainly by recombination of o 3 5 13 pn g 355 9 04 2 m 1 30 this is a very compact and young low excitation pn ionised by a weak emission line star wels sahai et al 2011 clas sify it as m c t ps m h a multipolar with close lobes and a toroid point symmetric with opposite lobes halo with arc like structures garc a rojas et al 2013 determined an adf o 2 of 2 1 for this object the observed spectrum crosses through the central star position the heliocentric radial velocity is 125 km s 1 indicating that this is an object of the galactic bulge the chemical composition is normal with n o abun dance ratio of 0 49 lines appear split but very close in general cels and orls can be deblended except c ii 4267 that is single but with a complex profile the graph vexp vs ip presented in fig 2 shows clearly the velocity structure inside the nebula as given by cels the highly ionised species show expansion velocities of about 10 km s 1 or lower and the low ionised species show vexp of about 17 km s 1 also vexp from orls show a gradient although similarly to other cases orls present lower vexp than cels at the same ip in particular vexp o iii is 10 3 0 1 km s 1 while vexp o ii is 9 2 0 5 km s 1 on the other hand ne iii and ne ii have the same vexp within uncertainties given that vexp from orls are lower it would be indi cating that the ions emitting orls lie inside the zone where cels are produced this nebula shows the velocity of permitted lines of si ii coinciding well with vexp of fe iii if the si ii lines are ex cited by the starlight the point should be moved to 8 15 ev and it would appear much below vexp of s ii and others therefore the permitted lines of si ii seem to be produced mainly by recombination of si 2 6 general conclusions we have analysed the kinematics of ions emitting cels and orls in fourteen pne ten of which are ionised by a wc mnras 000 1 15 2017 kinematics of orls and cels in pne 13 central star two are ionised by a wels and two have normal central stars high resolution spectra obtained mostly with the mike spectrograph attached to the magellan telescope clay have been used except for two objects whose data were obtained from the literature expansion velocities were determine from cels and orls as half the difference in velocity be tween the red and blue components if the lines were split or as half the fwhm if the lines were single vexp were anal ysed as a function of the distance of ions with respect to the central star represented by the ionisation potential of the ion in most of the analysed objects the emission from cels shows a gradient in velocity as a function of the distance to the central star which is expected in an expanding plasma with a structure determined by ionisation equilibrium and the effect of interacting winds which shape the hydrody namic structures we recall here that in hydrodynamical models of such a plasma the velocity field accelerates out wards the shell s edge expands faster than the inner zone and both accelerate as the star evolves with time crossing the hr diagram see fig 4 by scho nberner 2016 two objects which do not show such a gradient and present a cel velocity field almost flat with a very low expansion velocity are m 1 32 and m 3 15 whose main emis sion comes from a toroid oriented almost pole on thus it is contained in the plane of sky therefore only a small radial velocity is measured for all the ions in both cases hydro dynamical models for h and n ii lines for both objects are very similar in these objects orls do not show a veloc ity gradient either but they present a different behaviour in the sense that in m 3 15 vexp orls are larger than vexp cels and it is the opposite in m 1 32 therefore in these two cases cels and orls do not share the same kine matics considering the expansion velocities derived from orls we found that many of the analysed objects show a velocity gradient flatter than cels or a gradient below that of cels therefore the kinematics shown by orls is incompatible with that of cels specially if the emis sion from the same ions is considered for instance the cel and orl emissions of o 2 and ne 2 to illustrate these differences we present fig 4 where the expansion velocities from cels emitted by o 2 o iii expansion velocity are plotted against vexp from orls emitted by the same ion o ii expansion velocity in this figure it is evident that in seven cases represented in blue vexp o iii is definitely larger than vexp o ii for the four cases marked in green the uncertainty bars prevent us from a conclusive result in these cases both vexp would be equal within uncertainties only three objects ngc 3918 m 3 15 and m 1 25 marked in red show vexp o iii slightly lower than vexp o ii in any case the important conclusion here is that in most ob jects 10 of 14 both velocities do not coincide and in the majority of cases vexp cels are larger than vexp orls when a clear velocity gradient is found from cels and a flatter gradient lying below the gradient from cels is observed from orls this is indicating that the ions produc ing orls are located in a zone more centrally concentrated that the zone where collisionally excited lines are emitted in the cases where vexp from orls show no gradient no velocity structure the ions emitting this radiation are be 5 10 15 20 25 30 5 10 15 20 25 30 cn 1 5 hb 4

differently to what is predicted by hydrodynamical modelling for a plasma in ionisation equilibrium the zone emitting orls could correspond to gas ejection from the star at a later time than the ejection of the zone emitting cels this gas was ejected at a low velocity and no acceler ation due to interacting winds has occurred yet we have analysed the kinematics shown by the permit ted lines of si ii and o iii which have been indicated as lines excited by starlight in the first case and bowen mechanism in the second one our analysis reveals that for most of the studied objects such lines seem to be produced mainly by recombination of si 2 and o 3 respectively therefore the efficiency of the mechanisms proposed to excite these lines starlight or bowen would be low in addition to the results described above we have found that the fwhm orls are in general smaller than the fwhm cels this is highly significant in particular in objects where two components are detected for the lines because in this case the red and blue components do not include the effect of expansion and are affected only by thermal broadening turbulence and physical structure the smaller fwhm of orls can be interpreted as orls being emitted in zones of lower temperature than cels considering the results obtained here for the majority of our objects and including the halo pn reported by ot suka et al 2010 which also shows incompatibility in the kinematics of cels and orls it seems evident that in most pne the gas emitting cels and the gas emitting orls have different spatial distributions this is consistent with the analysis by richer et al 2013 for ngc 7009 who claim that two different plas mas with different conditions and distributions one emit ting cels and the other richer and colder emitting orls are present in this nebula the possibility that orls and cels are emitted in different zones of the nebula has been recently reinforced by richer et al 2017 who analysed the kinematics of the c ii 6578 recombination line in compar ison with the kinematics of h and the n ii collisionally excited lines in 76 pne finding that the emission of the c ii line comes from a volume more internal than what is ex pected in a plasma in ionisation equilibrium mnras 000 1 15 2017 14 m pen a et al in this work based on the analysis of the kinematics of cels and orls emitted by many ions we conclude that the presence of multiplasma components seems to occur com monly in pne several pn central stars of the objects anal ysed here seem to have had at least two different ejections the first one corresponds to the h rich plasma with chem ical abundances given by cels and whose kinematics be haves accordingly with a structure in ionisation equilibrium and affected by interacting winds as it is predicted by hy drodynamical models and a second ejection where the gas is slightly richer in heavy elements than the initial one and that lies inside the previous one in several cases this gas emit ting mainly orls does not behave as a plasma following the hydrodynamic modelling of pne ionisation structures the youngest objects in our sample those very com pact and with a high electron density show the lowest vexp smaller than 20 km s 1 this is specially true for vexp from orls most of pne studied here have moderate adfs except ngc 7009 which shows an adf of 5 no correlation seems to exist between the adf and the difference in kinematics between cels and orls it would be interesting to analyse the kinematics of cels and orls in pne with a very high adf it has been demostrated that at least some pne with a close binary star show a ver large adf and extremely rich material forming knots near the binary central star corradi et al 2015 garc a rojas et al 2016 these knots most probably have a kinematics very different from the one of the normal plasma e g see the case of a 78 by medina pen a 2000 the different behaviour in the kinematics of cels and orls does not seem related with the chemical abundances the excitation of the nebula or the central star although most of our pne are ionised by a wc star the ones ionised by wels or normal stars show the same dissimilar kinemat ics our results together with the ones by richer et al 2013 2017 and other authors show the coexistence of dif ferent plasmas with different abundances and different phys ical conditions in pne the question relative to what are the real abundances in the plasma of a pne if that derived from cels or that derived from orls seems to have meaning no more because the different plasmas have their own charac teristics acknowledgements this work received finantial support from unam dgapa papiit in 103117 j s r g and f r e acknowledge scholarship from conacyt me xico this work
