the james function christopher n b hammond warren p johnson and steven j miller 1 introduction in his 1981 baseball abstract 8 bill james posed the following problem sup pose two teams a and b have winning percentages a and b respectively having played equally strong schedules in a game such as baseball where there are no ties if a and b play each other what is the probability p a b that a wins this question is perhaps more relevant to other sports because in baseball the outcome is particularly sensitive to the pitching matchup in 1972 the philadel phia phillies won 29 of the 41 games started by steve carlton and 30 of the 115 games started by their other pitchers the answer is quite interesting even if its applicability is somewhat limited by the tacit assumption of uniformity for 0 a 1 and c 0 define qc a by 1 1 a qc a qc a c james calls q 1 2 a the log 5 of a and does not consider any other values of c under the assumption of uniformity he claims that p a b would be given by the function 1 2 p a b q 1 2 a q 1 2 a q 1 2 b in this context we take uniformity to mean that a team s likelihood of defeating another team is determined only by their winning percentages for example this assumption ignores the impact of the starting pitchers and precludes the situation where one team has a tendency to do particularly well or particularly poorly against another team this technique is sometimes called the log 5 method of calculating p a b al though we will avoid using this name as there is nothing obviously logarithmic about it it is easy to see from 1 1 that qc a ca 1 a substituting this expression into 1 2 we see that 1 3 p a b a 1 b a 1 b b 1 a not only for c 1 2 but for any positive c the explicit form of p a b was first given by dallas adams 8 who also christened it the james function it makes sense to extend the james function to values of a and b in the set 0 1 except date october 23 2014 key words and phrases james function bradley terry model sabermetrics

cases we would not have expected to be able to make predictions based on winning percentages alone moreover both cases would be impossible if the two teams had previously competed against each other james s procedure can be interpreted as a twofold application of the general method known as the bradley terry model or sometimes the bradley terry luce model if a and b have worths w a and w b respectively the probability that a is considered superior to b is a b w a w a w b despite the attribution of this model to bradley and terry 1 and to luce 10 the basic idea dates back to zermelo 15 the question of course is how to assign the right measure for the worth of a in a particular setting in chess for instance it is common to express the worth of a player as 10 ra 400 where ra denotes the player s elo rating see 4 the rating of chess players is the question in which zermelo was originally interested good 5 who also considered this problem seems to have been the first to call attention to zermelo s paper another example is james s so called pythagorean model introduced in 7 p 104 and discussed further in 12 for estimating a team s seasonal winning percentage based on the number r of runs it scores and the number s of runs it allows in this case the worth of the team is r 2 and the worth of its opposition is s 2 in the construction of the james function we can view the measure of a team s worth as being obtained from the bradley terry model itself we begin by assigning an arbitrary worth c 0 taken by james to be 1 2 to a team with winning per centage 1 2 equation 1 1 can be construed as an application of the bradley terry model where the worth of a team is determined by the assumption that its overall winning percentage is equal to its probability of defeating a team with winning percentage 1 2 equation 1 2 represents a second application of the bradley terry model where each team has an arbitrary winning percentage and the measure of its worth comes from the previous application of the model this area of study which is usually called the theory of paired comparisons has focused from the outset on the question of inferring worth from an incomplete set of outcomes 15 see 2 for a thorough treatment as well as 3 and 14 for additional context james on the other hand takes the worths to be known and uses them to determine the probability of the outcomes we will adopt a similar point of view emphasizing a set of axiomatic principles rather than a specific model james s justification 8 for his method does not invoke the bradley terry model but rather the fact that the resulting function p a b satisfies six self evident con ditions 1 p a a 1 2 2 p a 1 2 a 3 if a b then p a b 1 2 and if a b then p a b 1 2 4 if b 1 2 then p a b a and if b 1 2 then p a b a 5 0 p a b 1 and if 0 a 1 then p a 0 1 and p a 1 0 6 p a b p b a 1 the james function 3 condition 1 pertains to the situation where two different teams have the same winning percentage as opposed to a single team competing against itself to avoid contradicting 5 condition 4 should exclude the cases where a 0 and a 1 we will call this set with this slight correction the proto james conditions james originally referred to them as conditions of logic in addition to presenting some empirical evidence for 1 2 james makes the following assertion conjecture 1 1981 the james function p a b is the only function that satisfies all six of the proto james conditions jech 9 independently proposed a similar albeit shorter list of conditions although he did not consider the james conjecture he was able to prove a uniqueness theorem pertaining to a related class of functions the purpose of this paper is to examine the mathematical theory underlying the james function and to demonstrate that the james conjecture is actually false in fact we will introduce and study a large class of functions that satisfy the proto james conditions while the proto james conditions are certainly worthy of attention we prefer to work with a slightly different set the following conditions apply to all points a b with 0 a 1 and 0 b 1 except for 0 0 and 1 1 a p a 1 2 a b p a 0 1 for 0 a 1 c p b a 1 p a b d p 1 b 1 a p a b e p a b is a non decreasing function of a for 0 b 1 and a strictly increasing function of a for 0 b 1 we shall refer to conditions a to e as the james conditions condition d which is not represented among the proto james conditions simply states that the whole theory could be reformulated using losing percentages rather than winning percentages with the roles of the two teams reversed together with condition c it is equivalent to saying p 1 a 1 b 1 p a b which may seem more natural to some readers it should be clear from 1 3 that the james function satisfies james conditions a to d we will verify condition e in section 3 it is fairly obvious that the james conditions imply the proto james conditions condition a is identical to condition 2 condition c is condition 6 which implies 1 by taking b a condition e is stronger than 3 and 4 and in concert with 1 and 2 implies them both combined with c or d it also implies that p a b is a non increasing function of b for 0 a 1 and a strictly decreasing function of b for 0 a 1 finally b implies the second of the three parts of 5 together with c it also implies that p 0 b 0 if 0 b 1 by taking b 0 in d and replacing 1 a with b condition b further implies that p 1 b 1 if 0 b 1 and this together with c gives p a 1 0 for 0 a 1 which is a hair stronger than the third part of 5 these facts combined with e show that 0 p a b 1 when 0 a 1 and 0 b 1 which implies the first part of 5 we will focus our attention on functions that satisfy the james conditions and hence also the proto james conditions see 6 the online supplement to this paper for an example of a function that satisfies the proto james conditions but not the james conditions 4 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller 2 verification of the james function while the bradley terry model is practically ubiquitous its applicability to this situation is not obvious from an axiomatic perspective we now present a self contained proof that under an intuitive probabilistic model in which a and b are the probabilities of success in simultaneous bernoulli trials the james function p a b represents the probability p a b this model satisfies the assumption of uniformity discussed in section 1 the following argument was discovered by the third named author several years ago 11 but has not previously appeared in a formal publication theorem 2 the probability p a b that a team with winning percentage a defeats a team with winning percentage b is given by the james function p a b a 1 b a 1 b b 1 a except when a b 0 or a b 1 in which case p a b is undefined proof let teams a and b have winning percentages a and b respectively indepen dently assign to each of a and b either a 0 or 1 where a draws 1 with probability a and b draws 1 with probability b if one team draws 1 and the other 0 the team with 1 wins the competition if both teams draw the same number repeat this procedure until they draw different numbers the probability that a draws 1 and b draws 0 on any given turn is clearly a 1 b while the opposite occurs with probability b 1 a the probability that a and b both draw 1 is ab and the probability that they both draw 0 is 1 a 1 b hence 2 1 ab 1 a 1 b a 1 b b 1 a 1 it follows that 0 ab 1 a 1 b 1 and 0 a 1 b b 1 a 1 whenever 0 a 1 and 0 b 1 we can conclude the argument in either of two ways since the probability that a and b draw the same number is ab 1 a 1 b in which case they draw again p a b must satisfy the functional equation p a b a 1 b ab 1 a 1 b p a b the only case in which we cannot solve for p a b is when ab 1 a 1 b 1 by 2 1 this situation only occurs when a 1 b b 1 a 0 which implies that either a b 0 or a b 1 otherwise p a b p a b alternatively we may observe that the probability that a wins on the nth trial is a 1 b ab 1 a 1 b n 1 and so the probability that a wins in at most n trials is a 1 b n k 1 ab 1 a 1 b k 1 as n tends to this expression yields a convergent geometric series unless ab 1 a 1 b 1 using 2 1 we again obtain the james function the james function 5 this proof relies on a particular model for the relationship between winning percentages and the outcome of a competition under different assumptions about this relationship it seems possible that we would obtain other approximations for p a b any such function would presumably also satisfy the james conditions 3 properties of the james function in this section we will consider several important properties of the james func tion we begin by computing the partial derivatives of p a b which will lead to an observation originally due to dallas adams note that 3 1 p a b 1 b a 1 b b 1 a 2 which shows that the james function satisfies condition e and also 3 2 p b a 1 a a 1 b b 1 a 2 furthermore we have 2 p a 2 2 b 1 b 1 2 b a 1 b b 1 a 3 so that as a function of a it follows that p a b is concave up for 1 2 b 1 and concave down for 0 b 1 2 similarly 2 p b 2 2 a 1 a 1 2 a a 1 b b 1 a 3 adams makes an interesting remark relating to the mixed second partial deriv ative 3 3 2 p a b a b a 1 b b 1 a 3 it follows from 3 3 that p a viewed as a function of b is increasing for b a and decreasing for b a so it is maximized as a function of b when b a since p a is positive for every 0 b 1 it must be most positive when b a alternatively 3 3 tells us that p b viewed as a function of a is increasing for a b and decreasing for a b so it is minimized as a function of a when a b since p b is negative for every 0 a 1 we conclude that it is most negative when a b adams interprets these facts in the following manner since p a b increases most rapidly with a when b a and decreases most rapidly with b when a b one should field one s strongest team when playing an opponent of equal strength 8 once again this observation is perhaps more interesting in sports other than baseball where the star players other than pitchers play nearly every game when healthy although james points out that yankees manager casey stengel preferred to save his ace pitcher whitey ford for the strongest opposition it seems particu larly relevant to european soccer where the best teams engage in several different competitions at the same time against opponents of varying quality and even the top players must occasionally be rested in principle there are two ways to increase the value of p a b by increasing a or by decreasing b under most circumstances a team can only control its own 6 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller quality and not that of its opponent there are some situations however such as the yankees signing a key player away from the red sox where an individual or entity might exercise a degree of control over both teams similarly there are many two player games such as parcheesi and backgammon in which each player s move affects the position of both players in any such setting it is a legitimate question whether the priority of an individual or team should be to improve its own standing or to diminish that of its adversary recall that the gradient of a function signifies the direction of the greatest rate of increase the next result which has apparently escaped notice until now follows directly from equations 3 1 and 3 2 proposition 3 for any point a b except where a and b both belong to the set 0 1 the gradient of the james function p a b is a positive multiple of the vector b 1 b a 1 a in other words to maximize the increase of p a b the optimal ratio of the increase of a to the decrease of b is b 1 b a 1 a one consequence of this result is that when two teams have identical winning per centages the optimal strategy for increasing p a b is to increase a and to decrease b in equal measure the same fact holds when two teams have complementary win ning percentages in all other situations the maximal increase of p a b is achieved by increasing a and decreasing b by different amounts with the ratio tilted towards the team whose winning percentage is further away from 1 2 in the extremal cases when one of the two values a or b belongs to the set 0 1 the optimal strategy is to devote all resources to changing the winning percentage of the team that is either perfectly good or perfectly bad this observation is somewhat vacuous when a 1 or b 0 since p a b is already as large as it could possibly be although the strategy is entirely reasonable when a 0 or b 1 it also makes sense that the gradient is undefined at the points 0 0 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 since these winning percentages do not provide enough information to determine how much one team must improve to defeat the other if p a b c it is easy to see that a 1 b 1 c 1 a bc which implies the next result proposition 4 if 0 a 1 then p a b c if and only if p a c b in other words for a fixed value of a the james function is an involution the practical interpretation of this result is simple to state even if it is not intuitively obvious if team a has probability c of beating a team with winning percentage b then team a has probability b of beating a team with winning per centage c the james conditions already imply this relationship whenever b and c both belong to the set 0 1 or the set 1 2 a nevertheless it is not evident at this point whether the involutive property is a necessary consequence of the james conditions example 7 will provide an answer to this question proposition 4 has two further implications that are worth mentioning the first is a version of the involutive property that holds for a fixed value of b if 0 b 1 then p a b 1 c if and only if p c b 1 a the james function 7 the second is that the level curves for the james function that is the set of all points for which p a b c for a particular constant c can be written 3 4 b p a c a 1 c a 1 c c 1 a for 0 a 1 these level curves are the concrete manifestation of a straight forward principle if a team a improves by a certain amount there should be a corresponding amount that a team b can improve so that the probability of a defeating b remains unchanged each level curve represents the path from 0 0 to 1 1 that such a pair would take in tandem see figure 1 h 0 0 l h 1 0 l h 0 1 l h 1 1 l figure 1 the level curves for the james function p a b we conclude this section with one more observation relating to these level curves proposition 5 for any 0 c 1 the corresponding level curve for the james function p a b is the unique solution to the differential equation db da b 1 b a 1 a that passes through the point c 1 2 another way of stating this result is that for two teams to maintain the same value of p a b they should increase or decrease their winning percentages according to the ratio a 1 a b 1 b one can either verify this assertion directly by solving the differential equation to obtain 3 4 or by appealing to proposition 3 and recalling that the gradient is always perpendicular to the level curve at a particular point 8 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller 4 jamesian functions we will now consider the question of whether there is a unique function satisfying the james conditions we begin with the following observation which is implicit in the construction of the james function proposition 6 the james function is the only function derived from the bradley terry model that satisfies the james conditions proof suppose a b satisfies the james conditions and is derived from the bradley terry model let team a have winning percentage a with 0 a 1 and let team c have winning percentage 1 2 condition a implies that a a c w a w a w c solving for w a we obtain w a aw c 1 a qc a where c w c thus a b agrees with the james function p a b when both a and b belong to the interval 0 1 since the james conditions uniquely determine the value of a function whenever a or b belongs to 0 1 the functions a b and p a b must be identical let s denote the open unit square 0 1 0 1 we will say that any function j a b defined on the set s 0 0 1 1 that satisfies the james conditions is a jamesian function our immediate objective is to disprove the james conjecture by identifying at least one example of a jamesian function that is different from the james function p a b proposition 6 guarantees that any such function if it exists cannot be derived from the bradley terry model example 7 we will reverse engineer our first example of a new jamesian function by starting with its level curves consider the family of curves jc c 0 1 defined as follows jc a a 2 c 0 a 2 c 1 2 c 2 ca 1 2 c 2 c 1 2 c a 1 for 0 c 1 2 and jc a 2 2 c a 0 a 1 3 2 c a 1 2 c 2 2 c 1 3 2 c a 1 for 1 2 c 1 see figure 2 these curves have been chosen to satisfy certain symmetry properties which the reader can probably deduce but which we will not state explicitly suffice it to say that jc c 1 2 for all c we define the function j a b on s by assigning to every point a b the value of c associated with the particular curve jc that passes through that point we assign the value 0 or 1 to points on the boundary of s as dictated by the james conditions the james function 9 h 0 0 l h 1 0 l h 0 1 l h 1 1 l figure 2 the level curves for the function j a b in example 7 a bit more work yields an explicit formula for j a b from which one can verify directly that all of the james conditions are satisfied j a b a 2 b a b i 2 a b 2 a a b ii 1 b 2 1 a a b iii 1 a 2 b 2 1 b a b iv where i ii iii and iv are subsets of s 0 0 1 1 that are defined according to figure 3 observe that the appropriate definitions coincide on the boundaries between regions from which it follows that j a b is continuous on s 0 0 1 1 on the other hand it is not difficult to see that j a b fails to be differentiable at all points of the form a 1 a for 0 a 1 2 or 1 2 a 1 with some effort one can show that it is differentiable at the point 1 2 1 2 in reference to proposition 4 note that j 1 3 1 4 5 8 and j 1 3 5 8 4 15 in other words the involutive property is not a necessary consequence of the james conditions in view of the preceding example we need to refine our terminology somewhat we will refer to any jamesian function such as the james function itself that satisfies the condition j a j a b b for 0 a 1 as an involutive jamesian function 10 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller i ii iii iv h 0 0 l h 1 0 l h 0 1 l h 1 1 l figure 3 the subsets of s 0 0 1 1 in example 7 it turns out to be fairly easy to construct jamesian functions with discontinuities in s see 6 proposition 9 which we will prove in the next section guarantees that any such function is not involutive rather than considering such pathological examples we will devote the next section to examining jamesian functions that are involutive continuous and in many cases differentiable 5 involutive jamesian functions we now turn our attention to jamesian functions that satisfy the involutive property j a j a b b or equivalently j a b c if and only if j a c b whenever 0 a 1 this property essentially subsumes three of the five james conditions namely a b and d proposition 8 a function j s 0 0 1 1 0 1 is an involutive jamesian function if and only if it satisfies the involutive property james condition c and james condition e proof by definition an involutive jamesian function must satisfy the involutive property as well as all five james conditions suppose then that j a b satisfies the involutive property together with conditions c and e to see that j a b satisfies condition b take 0 a 1 and suppose that j a 0 c for 0 c 1 the involutive property would then dictate that j a c 0 and thus condition c would imply that j c a 1 hence j c a j c a for c c 1 which would violate condition e consequently j a 0 1 for 0 a 1 since j a b is a non decreasing function of a we conclude that j 1 0 1 as well the james function 11 next consider condition d applying the involutive property three times and condition c twice we see that j a b c j a c b j c a 1 b j c 1 b a j 1 b c 1 a j 1 b 1 a c as long as a b and c all belong to the interval 0 1 the cases where a b or c belongs to 0 1 can be dealt with by appealing to condition b in particular we know that j a 0 1 for 0 a 1 which implies that j 1 a 0 1 for 0 a 1 the involutive property dictates that j 1 a 1 0 for 0 a 1 since j 1 0 1 it follows from c that j 1 1 a 1 j a 0 for 0 a 1 hence condition d holds whenever b 0 the remaining cases can be deduced from this observation finally consider condition a taking b a in condition c we see that j a a 1 2 hence the involutive property dictates that j a 1 2 a for 0 a 1 for a 1 simply note that conditions d and b imply that j 1 1 2 j 1 2 0 1 similarly condition c shows that j 0 1 2 1 j 1 2 0 0 in other words to identify an involutive jamesian function we can restrict our attention to the following set of conditions i j a j a b b for 0 a 1 ii j b a 1 j a b iii j a b is a non decreasing function of a for 0 b 1 and a strictly in creasing function of a for 0 b 1 we will refer to this list as the involutive james conditions condition i also guarantees that a jamesian function possesses another impor tant property proposition 9 every involutive jamesian function is continuous on s 0 0 1 1 proof take a fixed value 0 c 1 and consider the level curve j a b c which can be rewritten b j a c for 0 a 1 conditions i and ii imply that j 1 j a c c 1 a thus j a c viewed as a function of a is a bijection from the interval 0 1 onto itself hence it follows from iii that the curve j a c is a continuous strictly increasing function of a that connects the points 0 0 and 1 1 suppose for the sake of contradiction that j a b fails to be continuous at a point a 0 b 0 in s in other words there exists a positive number 0 such that for any positive there is a point a b such that a b a 0 b 0 and j a b j a 0 b 0 0 if necessary redefine 0 so it is less than min 2 j a 0 b 0 2 2 j a 0 b 0 let c 1 j a 0 b 0 0 2 and c 2 j a 0 b 0 0 2 and consider the level curves j a c 1 and j a c 2 let 0 denote the minimum of the distance between a 0 b 0 and j a c 1 and the distance between a 0 b 0 and j a c 2 by assumption there is a point a 3 b 3 such that a 3 b 3 a 0 b 0 0 and c 3 j a 3 b 3 is either less than or equal to j a 0 b 0 0 or greater than or equal 12 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller to j a 0 b 0 0 since j a ci 1 2 at a ci the level curve j a c 3 intersects the line b 1 2 either to the left of the curve j a c 1 or to the right of the curve j a c 2 on the other hand since a 3 b 3 lies within 0 of a 0 b 0 the curve j a c 3 must intersect the line b b 3 between j a c 1 and j a c 2 hence two of the level curves must intersect at a point in s which is impossible see figure 4 for a graphical illustration of this argument now consider a point a 0 b 0 on the boundary of s the only difference in the proof is that if a 0 or b 1 the level curve j a c 1 does not exist in this case it is not difficult to see that j a c 3 must intersect the curve j a c 2 similarly if a 1 or b 0 there is no level curve j a c 2 but one can show that j a c 3 must intersect j a c 1 ha 0 b 0 l ha 3 b 3 l jha c 1 l jha c 2 l jha c 3 l hjha 0 b 0 l 0 5 l figure 4 an illustration of the proof of proposition 9 let g 0 1 r be a continuous strictly increasing function that satisfies the conditions g 1 a g a lim a 0 g a these conditions imply that g 1 2 0 and that lim a 1 g a observe that g 1 r 0 1 is a continuous strictly increasing function with g 1 s 1 g 1 s it makes sense to define g 0 and g 1 so that g 1 0 and g 1 1 we claim that any such function g can be used to construct an involutive jamesian function theorem 10 for any g satisfying the conditions specified above the function 5 1 j a b g 1 g a g b the james function 13 is an involutive jamesian function proof consider each of the three involutive james conditions i note that j a j a b g 1 g a g g 1 g a g b g 1 g a g a g b g 1 g b b as long as 0 a 1 the cases where a 0 and a 1 yield the indeterminate forms and ii similarly j b a g 1 g b g a 1 g 1 g a g b 1 j a b iii since both g and g 1 are strictly increasing it follows that j a b is a strictly increasing function of a when 0 b 1 moreover j a b takes on the constant value 1 when b 0 and the constant value 0 when b 1 while it is unnecessary to verify james conditions a and d it is worth noting that a corresponds to the property g 1 2 0 and d to the property g 1 a g a in effect we verified condition b in the process of considering iii it is easy to use theorem 10 to generate concrete examples example 11 the function g a 2 a 1 a 1 a satisfies all the necessary conditions for theorem 10 so 5 1 defines an involutive jamesian function since g 1 s s 2 s 2 4 2 s we obtain j a b x y x 2 y 2 2 y x x y x 2 y 2 where x 2 ab 1 a 1 b and y b a 2 ab a b 1 example 12 the function g a cot a yields the involutive jamesian func tion j a b 1 cot 1 cot a cot b where we are using the version of the inverse cotangent that attains values between 0 and the construction described in theorem 10 is closely related to what is known as a linear model for paired comparisons in such a model a b f v a v b where v denotes a measure of worth and f is the cumulative distribution function of a random variable that is symmetrically distributed about 0 see 2 section 1 3 14 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller the bradley terry model can be viewed as a linear model where f is the logistic function f s es es 1 s et 1 et 2 dt and v a logw a in particular the james function can be constructed in the manner of theorem 10 with f g 1 being the logistic function and g being the so called logit function g a log a 1 a this observation could charitably be construed as an a posteriori justification for the term log 5 originally used by james what is distinctive about the james function in this context is that the con struction is symmetric with v a logw a and v b logw b replaced by g a log a 1 a and g b log b 1 b respectively this symmetry corre sponds to the twofold application of the bradley terry model that was discussed in section 1 likewise the fact that both g and g 1 appear in the general formulation of theorem 10 can be interpreted as a consequence of the same model being used to define both worth and probability example 13 take f s g 1 s 1 2 s e t 2 2 dt so that g is the so called probit function the involutive jamesian function j a b g 1 g a g b can be considered the analogue of the james function relative to the thurstone mosteller model see 2 theorem 10 allows us to identify a large class of functions that can be viewed as generalizations of the james function since log a 1 a a 1 2 1 t 1 1 t dt a 1 2 1 t 1 t dt we define gn a a 1 2 1 t 1 t n dt for any real number n 1 it is not difficult to verify that gn satisfies all of the prescribed requirements for theorem 10 the stipulation that gn 0 precludes the case where 0 n 1 define 5 2 hn a b g 1 n gn a gn b for n 1 we shall refer to hn a b as a hyper james function each of these functions is an involutive jamesian function in some situations it is possible to obtain a more concrete representation for hn a b for example one can show that g 3 2 a 2 2 a 1 a 1 a the james function 15 and g 13 2 s s s 2 16 2 s 2 16 and hence h 3 2 a b 1 2 v u u v 2 u v 4 uv 2 u v uv for u a 1 a v b 1 b u 1 2 a and v 1 2 b see 6 for more details in general though it seems unlikely that there is an explicit formula for hn a b that is more useful than 5 2 we will now examine the issue of differentiability for any function defined according to theorem 10 a routine calculation shows that 5 3 j a g a g j a b and 5 4 j b g b g j a b at all points a b for which the above quotients are defined based on this obser vation we are able to obtain the following result proposition 14 if g is continuously differentiable on 0 1 with g never equal to 0 the corresponding jamesian function j a b is differentiable on s conversely if j a b is differentiable on s the function g must be differentiable on 0 1 with g never 0 proof suppose that g is continuous and nonzero on 0 1 it follows from 5 3 and 5 4 that both j a and j b are defined and continuous at all points in the open set s which guarantees that j a b is differentiable on s now suppose that j a b is differentiable at every point in s let a 0 be an arbitrary element of 0 1 since g is strictly increasing it could only fail to be differentiable on a set of measure 0 see 13 p 112 in particular there is at least one c in 0 1 for which g c is defined since j a 0 b viewed as a function of b attains every value in the interval 0 1 there exists a b 0 in 0 1 such that j a 0 b 0 c note that g a g j a b 0 g b 0 for all a in 0 1 so the chain rule dictates that g a 0 g c j a a 0 b 0 therefore g is differentiable on the entire interval 0 1 suppose for the sake of contradiction that there were some d in 0 1 for which g d 0 as before there would exist a b 1 in 0 1 such that j a 0 b 1 d which would imply that g a 0 g d j a a 0 b 1 0 consequently g would be identically 0 on 0 1 which is impossible 16 c n b hammond w p johnson and s j miller in other words all the specific examples of jamesian functions we have intro duced in this section including the hyper james functions are differentiable on s we can now state a more general version of proposition 3 which follows directly from 5 3 and 5 4 proposition 15 for any differentiable jamesian function j a b defined accord ing to theorem 10 the gradient at a point a b in s is a positive multiple of the vector g a g b if g is differentiable on 0 1 the condition that g 1 a g a implies that g 1 a g a hence the gradient of j a b is a positive multiple of 1 1 whenever b a or b 1 a this observation generalizes the fact that when ever two teams have identical or complementary winning percentages the optimal strategy for increasing p a b is to increase a and decrease b by equal amounts for any jamesian function given by 5 1 the level curve j a b c for 0 c 1 can be rewritten b j a c g 1 g a g c or g a g b g c hence we have the following generalization of proposition 5 proposition 16 let j a b be a differentiable jamesian function defined according to theorem 10 for any 0 c 1 the corresponding level curve for j a b is the unique solution to the differential equation db da g a g b that passes through the point c 1 2 thus the level curves for the jamesian functions defined in examples 11 and 12 are given by the differential equations db da 2 a 2 2 a 1 b 1 b 2 2 b 2 2 b 1 a 1 a 2 and db da sin b sin a 2 respectively likewise the level curves for any hyper james function hn a b are given by the differential equation db da b 1 b a 1 a n figure 5 shows the level curves for the hyper james function h 2 a b 6 final thoughts while it is possible to construct additional examples of non involutive jame sian functions it would be reasonable to focus any further investigation on the involutive case perhaps the most obvious question is whether one can assign any probabilistic significance to the involutive jamesian functions we have just intro duced particularly the hyper james functions for instance could one somehow alter the assumptions underlying theorem 2 to obtain one of these functions in place of p a b within this context several lines of inquiry seem especially worthwhile the james function 17 h 0 0 l h 1 0 l h 0 1 l h 1 1 l figure 5 the level curves for the hyper james function h 2 a b 1 does every involutive jamesian function have the form described in theo rem 10 for some particular function g 2 while it is clear how the involutive property arises mathematically is there any a priori reason that it should hold based on the probabilistic interpre tation of the james function 3 are there any situations for which non differentiability would make sense in the setting of an athletic competition we would be delighted if this paper motivated other mathematicians or sports enthusiasts to consider any of these questions acknowledgments we would never have written this paper if caleb garza a recent alumnus of connecticut college had not decided to give a senior seminar talk on a topic from sabermetrics we

investigate the properties of the james function associated with bill james s so called log 5 method which assigns a probability to the result of a game between two teams based on their respective winning percent ages we also introduce and study a class of functions which we call jamesian that satisfy the same a priori conditions that were originally used to describe the james function
