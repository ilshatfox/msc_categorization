29060 900 brazil dated november 15 2018 we will study the splitting in the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom subjected to a uniform electric field stark effect with the heisenberg algebra deformed leading to the minimum length we will use the perturbation theory for cases not degenerate n 1 and degenerate n 2 along with known results of corrections in these levels caused by the minimum length applied purely to the hydrogen atom so that we may find and estimate the corrections of minimum length applied to the stark effect i introduction the proposal of noncommutative geometry was developed in 1980 by a connes 1 and it was realized that the non commutative geometry would be a scheme to extend the standard model in several ways 2 in the 90 s the proposal appears naturally in the context of string theory 3 4 in this way we may obtain an effective theory describing scenarios in string theory whose in the low energy limit is reduced to a known physical noncommutative geometry also appear in a condensed matter context as an effective theory that describes the electron in a two dimensional surface attached to a strong magnetic field this effective theory describes the quantum hall effect the electron would be trapped in the lowest landau levels and presents the conductance hall in e 2 units 5 a possible way to explore the implementation of noncommutatives theories is by the deformation of the heisenberg algebra in this paper we study a modified heisenberg algebra by adding certain small corrections to the canonical commutation relations it leads as shown by a kempf and contributors 6 10 to the minimum uncertainty in the position electronic address belichjr gmail com haofisica bol com br http arxiv org abs 1706 04430 v 1 mailto belichjr gmail com haofisica bol

kempf reads xi pj i ij 1 p 2 pipj pi pj 0 1 xi xj i 2 2 p 2 pixj pjxi 1 p 2 2 where and are deformation parameters and we assume 0 from the uncer tainty relation it follows that the minimum length is x 0 the hydrogen atom is one of the simplest quantum systems that allows theoretical predic tions of high accuracy and is well studied experimentally offering the most precise amount of measures 14 there are many papers where the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom in the presence minimum length is calculated 15 17 some of which have divergences in levels s n 1 16 the stark effect is the splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the action of an external electric field in our work we will study the stark effect with minimum length taking as reference the results of 18 in which it shows corrections in all energy levels including s so that we may find and estimate the corrections of minimum length applied to the stark effect ii hydrogen atom with minimum length the eigenvalue problem for the hydrogen atom in d dimensions is described by the equation p 2 2 m e 2 r e 3 where e q is the electron charge e 2 q 2 4 0 si the position operators xi and the momentum operators pi satisfies the deformed commutation relations 1 with xi d i 1 x 2 i we will use the following representation that satisfies the algebra 1 to first order in and 3 xi xi 2 4 xip 2 p 2 xi 4 pi pi 2 pip 2 5 with p 2 d i 1 p 2 i and the xi and pi operators follows the canonical commutation relations xi pj i ij for the undeformed heisenberg algebra the representation position may be taken as xi xi and pi i xi as it has been shown in 18 the analogous hamiltonian 3 can be expressed using the representation 4 and considering only terms of first order in and as h p 2 2 m p 4 2 m e 2 1 r 2 4 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r d 1 r 3 6 and it gives the perturbative correction e 1 nl e 2 a 30 n 3 d 1 2 4 l l 1 l 1 2 2 l 1 2 n 7 where a 0 is the bohr radius n n d 3 2 l l d 3 2 with the principal quantum number represented by n and the orbital quantum number by l this expression is singular in d 3 and l 0 and in the same paper it was shown that the hamiltonian 6 can also be expressed as h p 2 2 m p 4 2 m e 2 1 r 2 b 2 2 4 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r 8 with b 2 so the correction for n 1 is given by e 1 1 s 1 0 0 v 1 0 0 9 where v p 4 2 m e 2 1 r 2 b 2 1 r 2 4 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r 10 it results e 1 1 s e 2 a 30 3 2 ln 2 a 20 2 1 11 4 where 0 57721 is the euler constant the correction to the level 2 s is expressed by e 1 2 s e 2 8 a 30 7 3 2 2 ln 2 4 a 20 2 5 2 12 this results will be of fundamental importance for our work iii the stark effect a the ordinary stark effect the splitting of the energy levels of the atoms of an occupation electron the hydro gen atom or atoms of the hydrogen type with one valence electron outside a spherically symmetric shell subjected to an electric field uniform is said stark effect 19 the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom subjected to a uniform electric field in the positive direction of the z axis is given by h p 2 2 m e 2 r e e z 13 which can be divided into two parts h h 0 v where h 0 p 2 2 m e 2 r 14 with v e e z 15 we can treat v as a perturbation assuming the eigenstates and h 0 energy spectrum are known and disregarding the degree of freedom of spin our analysis is divided into corrections for non degenerate energy levels only n 1 and degenerates n 6 1 1 the quadratic stark effect for n 1 the energy shift is given by 1 e e 1 0 0 z 1 0 0 e 2 e 2 n 6 1 l m n l m z 1 0 0 2 e 1 en 16 we note that the operator z is odd parity while the ground state has well defined parity even so 1 0 0 z 1 0 0 0 and energy shift is quadratic in e therefore this type of displacement is said quadratic stark effect 5 the polarizability of an atom is defined in terms of the energy shift of the atomic state as follows 1 1 2 e 2 17 in our case 2 e 2 n 6 1 l m n l m z 1 0 0 2 e 1 en 18 we remark that n 6 1 l m n l m z 1 0 0 2 n l m n l m z 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 z 2 1 0 0 a 20 19 however the denominator is not constant we can get an upper limit for the polarizability taking into account that en e 2 2 a 0 n 2 20 so e 1 en e 2 2 a 0 1 1 n 2 e 1 e 2 3 e 2 8 a 0 21 then 1 e 1 en 8 a 0 e 2 22 and therefore 16 a 30 3 23 that is 1 8 3 a 30 e 2 24 2 the linear stark effect for n 6 1 occurs degeneracy due to possible values that can be assumed by l i e 0 1 n 1 we focus on the n 2 level then there is a state with l 0 2 0 0 said 2 s state and three states with l 1 2 1 0 2 1 1 and 2 1 1 said 2 p states all with the same energy e 2 e 2 8 a 0 the state 2 0 0 is even parity while three states 2 1 m m 0 1 are odd parity therefore the matrix element 2 0 0 v 2 0 0 and the 6 nine matrix elements 2 1 m v 2 1 m are zero the only elements that can be nonzero are of the form 2 1 m v 2 0 0 explicitly we have 2 1 0 v 2 0 0 3 ea 0 e 25 and 2 1 1 v 2 0 0 0 26 the matrix v represents the n 2 level then assumes the following form the basis vectors are arranged in the following order 2 0 0 2 1 0 2 1 1 and 2 1 1 v 0 3 ea 0 e 0 0 3 ea 0 e 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 27 proceeding with the diagonalization we get v 3 ea 0 e 28 with 1 2 2 0 0 2 1 0 29 and v 2 1 1 v 2 1 1 0 30 we see then that the degeneracy of the n 2 level is partially removed and energy shift is linear in e and for this reason it is said linear stark effect b the stark effect of minimum length 1 the quadratic stark effect using 4 and 8 the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom subjected to a uniform electric field in the positive direction of the z axis is h p 2 2 m p 4 2 m e 2 1 r 2 b 2 2 4 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r e e z 2 4 zp 2 p 2 z 31 7 the total energy splitting for n 1 for first order in and is given by e t 1 s e 1 1 s ml 1 32 where e 1 1 s is given by 11 and ml 1 e e 1 0 0 z 1 0 0 e 2 e 2 n 6 1 l m n l m z 1 0 0 2 e 1 en 33 with z z 2 4 zp 2 p 2 z 34 the term 1 0 0 z 1 0 0 will also be null since zp 2 and p 2 z are also odd parity operators similarly ml 1 1 2 e 2 35 we know that n 6 1 l m n l m z 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 z 2 1 0 0 36 and after some calculations we obtain that 1 0 0 z 2 1 0 0 a 20 2 2 37 then 16 3 a 0 a 20 2 2 38 i e ml 1 8 3 a 0 a 20 2 2 e 2 39 2 the linear stark effect here the total hamiltonian is h h 0 vml v s ml 40 where h 0 is the hamiltonian of hydrogen atom vml is the perturbation caused only by the minimum length and v sml is the perturbation caused by the minimum length applied to the stark effect for the matrix elements of the form n 0 0 vml n 0 0 the explicit formula to the perturbation is 8 vml p 4 2 m e 2 1 r 2 b 2 1 r 2 4 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r 41 whereas for elements of the form n l m vml n l m it is given by 20 vml p 4 2 m 2 4 e 2 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r 2 r 3 42 besides that we have v sml e e z 2 4 zp 2 p 2 z 43 which is also odd parity therefore the 2 0 0 v sml 2 0 0 and the nine matrix elements 2 1 m v sml 2 1 m will also be null after some calculations we obtain that 2 1 0 v sml 2 0 0 e e 3 a 0 2 8 a 0 44 with given by 29 and 2 1 1 v sml 2 0 0 0 45 similarly to the case with no minimum length diagonalizing the matrix v sml we get v sml e e 3 a 0 2 8 a 0 46 and v sml 2 1 1 v sml 2 1 1 0 47 the elements of the matrix vml are given explicitly by 20 n l m vml n l m ll mm 2 m e 2 n nn n l m v ml n l m 48 with v ml given by v ml e 2 1 r 2 b 2 1 r 2 4 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r 49 for elements of type n 0 0 v ml n 0 0 and v ml 2 4 e 2 1 r p 2 p 2 1 r 2 r 3 50 9 for elements of type n l m v ml n l m we then see that for n n 2 the matrix vml is diagonal i e it is diagonal in the basis 2 0 0 2 1 0 2 1 1 2 1 1 but not in the basis 2 1 1 2 1 1 in which it gives effect linear stark effect with minimum length therefore the perturbation vml purely caused by the minimum length and the perturbation v sml caused by the minimum length applied to the stark effect can not be simultaneously measured iv estimated correction we can rewrite 39 using the parameters xmin 51 and 52 instead of and as done in 16 18 21 22 with 1 3 1 once this is done we get ml 1 8 3 a 0 a 20 x 2 min 3 1 2 e 2 53 or ml 1 8 3 a 30 e 2 54 where 4 3 a 0 e 2 x 2 min 3 1 55 is the correction caused by the minimum length applied to the quadratic stark effect we clearly see that for 1 3 the correction is null and to 1 the correction is maximum in magnitude taking into account the value xmin 1 2 86 10 17 m obtained in 18 attributing the difference between the experimental and theoretical values of the lamb shift for the 1 s level of the hydrogen atom entirely to the minimum length and the electric field e 107 v m as the usual fields used in stark effect experiments are of the order of 106 107 v m 23 we obtain 1 283 10 39 j 56 10 this value is 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the difference between the experimental and theoretical values of the lamb shift for the 1 s level of the hydrogen atom l 1 s 7 024 10 29 j and 12 orders of magnitude smaller than the correction of the ordinary quadratic stark effect for the same value of the electric field 1 4 390 10 27 j the same can be done for 46 setting e 8 a 0 e 2 x 2 min 3 1 57 as the correction caused by the minimum length applied to the linear stark effect then we obtain 6 193 10 36 j 58 which is 7 orders of magnitude less than l 1 s and 14 orders of magnitude smaller than the correction of the ordinary linear stark effect 1 2 542 10 22 j v concluding remarks we have studied the quadratic and linear stark effect in the hydrogen atom taking into account the minimum length for this goal we have used perturbation methods along with known results of corrections in the energy levels of the hydrogen atom caused by the minimum length 18 estimates values obtained from the minimum length applied to the quadratic and linear stark effect 56 and 58 are many orders of magnitude smaller than the corrections of the ordinary stark effect they are also much smaller than the difference between the experimental and theoretical values of the lamb shift for the 1 s level of the hydrogen atom which is where you get the best estimate for the minimum length 16 we observe also that the estimated minimum length correction applied to the linear stark effect which occurs for n 2 we use l 1 s 7 024 10 29 j instead of l 2 s 2 p 7 951 10 30 j which would be strictly correct value this was done intentionally to illustrate that even in the best hypothesis because l 1 s l 2 s 2 p the obtained correction is very small clarifying the discussion in the section iii b 2 on the corrections caused by the pure minimum length and the minimum length applied to the linear stark effect can not be simultaneously measured the latter can simply be discarded for practical purposes 11 it is interesting to mention that our correction estimate is pretty simplistic since the hypothesis attribute the difference between the experimental and theoretical values of the lamb shift of the hydrogen atom entirely to the minimum length is naive compared to the recent discussions on the proton radius 24 and proposed models to provide an explanation that does not conflict with the experimental data 25 26 ackowledgements the authors thank cnpq and capes of brazil for financial support 1 a connes c algebras and differential geometry compt rend acad sci ser i
