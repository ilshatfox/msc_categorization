ar x iv 1 50 5 00 45 8 v 1 m at h h o 3 m ay 2 01 5 on the lexicographic representation of numbers vincenzo manca university of verona italy abstract it is proven that contrarily to the common belief the notion of zero is not necessary for having positional representations of numbers namely for any positive integer k a positional representation with the symbols for 1 2 k is given that retains all the essential properties of the usual positional representation of base k over symbols for 0 1 2 k 1 moreover in this zero free representation a sequence of symbols identifies the number that corresponds to the order number that the sequence has in the ordering where shorter sequences precede the longer ones and among sequences of the same length the usual lexicographic ordering of dictionaries is considered the main properties of this lexicographic representation are proven and conversion algorithms between lexicographic and classical positional representations are given zero free positional representations are relevantt in the perspective of the history of mathematics as well as in the perspective of emergent computation models and of unconventional representations of genomes keywords positional representation zero lexicographic ordering 1 number positional representations the positional representation of numbers was an epochal discovery that is a landmark in the history of mathematics and science il is based on a notational system of hindu origin that via the arabian mathematics was imported in europe with the famous book liber abaci published in 1202 by leonardo fibonacci leonardo from pisa this number representation was the seed of a new mathematical perspective algebraic and algorithmic that surely contributed to the important discoveries of renaissance mathematics from which modern mathematics stemmed an important aspect of positional representation was the notion of zero from an arabian root common to the noun zephyr a gentle wind whose origin is hardly determinable any natural number can be univocally represented as sum of powers of any base k 1 multiplied by coefficients smaller than k from this unicity it easily follows that given an alphabet of k symbols standing for 0 1 2 k 1 every number is univocally represented by a sequence of symbols in this alphabet where the position of the symbol encodes a power of the basis k and the symbol in that position encodes a multiplicative coefficient in such a way that the 1 http arxiv org abs 1505 00458 v 1 2 vincenzo manca university of verona italy sum of these multiplied powers yields the number when a symbol for zero occurs then the corresponding power gives a null contribution to the overall sum providing the number classical texts in number theory and history of mathematics usually connect intrinsically the notion of zero with the positional notation 10 3 for example in 10 it is written that the only complication which the positional notation involves lies in the necessity of introducing a zero symbol to express a void or missing class for instance 204 is different from 24 the same necessity is expressed by 3 and certainly the attitude toward this conviction was enforced by the decimal notation and the related algorithms for basic operations using alignment carry positional shift and decimal point after the seminal works of franc ois vie te and simon stevin in sixteenth century 2 however in 11 in the context of the historical analysis of number representation systems some remarks clearly suggest that positional notations were present in some ancient number systems one of them is the greek one especially in the sexagesimal notation used in ptolemy s almagest where some kind positional concepts made possible the complex computations required in the contexts of geometrical and astronomical problems in 7 an illuminating synthesis of the historical development of number representation is reported in passing we recall that in a geographically far culture and chronologically antecedent maya developed a positional number system with base twenty also having a well defined notion of zero 5 in this note we show that the connection between zero and the positional notation is not necessary namely we prove that the usual lexicographic representation of strings in a given alphabet is a positional number system but without any symbol for zero the essence of positional notations is the notion of cipher sequence where ciphers have positional values corresponding to the powers of the base the main advantage of this notational mechanism is that arithmetical operations firstly sum and multiplication can be calculated by operation tables that is by only knowing the values of the given op eration when its arguments range over a finite set of numbers whose cardinality is equal to the value of base we will show that just this mechanism is behind the lexicographic representation by strings where the number n is represented by the string in position n according to the lexicographic enumeration in 1 the possibility of a zeroless positional system and its connection with the string ordering was already investigated however the analysis developed in 1 is very different from the one we present in this paper and the main properties of a lexicographic representation are determined in a completely different way moreover the representation algorithms are here defined in a more direct manner without passing through the classical positional systems as in 1 and the correctness proofs are formally established in 1 they are informally motivated finally here trans lation functions between lexicographic and classical positional representations are formally defined it is interesting to remark that the main idea of the present paper arose during the search for unconventional genome representation where dna sequences are viewed as numbers in base four in that context the following question was posed define a function that assigns to any string over a given alphabet its order in the lexicographic enumeration the solution to this question is given by equation 1 of the lexicographic on the lexicographic representation of numbers 3 a c g t aa ac ag at ca cc cg ct ga gc gg gt ta tc tg tt aaa aac aag aat aca acc acg act aga agc agg agt ata atc atg att caa cac cag cat table 1 the first 40 strings over a c g t in the lexicographic order theorem of section 2 from the recursive formula 1 the iterative formula of equa tion 2 easily follows which directly provides a number positional representation with the properties discussed along the paper 2 the lexicographic number representation let s a 1 a 2 ak a finite alphabet of symbols where we define an enumeration function of its symbols such that ai i for 1 i k we denote by s the set of strings that is of finite sequences over s in this paper we denote by s the cardinality of the set s while denotes the length of string moreover string concatenation is expressed by juxtaposition or by when it avoids confusion and i will denote the symbol of in position i the first position is 1 and the last equals the length of the string we can define a strict order over s by the following conditions if if and j i j i i and j j the second condition is the usual criterion adopted in the enumeration of the items in a lexicon the first one is added to the second in order to obtain a linear ordering over the infinite set of all strings over the alphabet for example given the ordered alphabet a c g t typical of genomes then table 1 gives the first 40 strings over this alphabet enumerated in the lexicographic order theorem 1 the lexicographic theorem let s be an ordered finite alphabet if x s and s then equation 1 inductively defines the enumeration number s of string x shortly indicated by according to the lexicographic ordering on s 0 if is the empty string 1 x x s moreover 2 i 1 i s i proof in fact let us denote by the position of when we lexicographically enu merate the strings of length a is the first string in position 1 if a is the first symbol 4 vincenzo manca university of verona italy of s in order to evaluate the position of x in the lexicographic enumeration we observe that i x follows all the strings of length which are in number i 1 s i ii and x follows the strings of length 1 beginning with any symbol y such that y x which are in number x 1 s iii between the first string of length 1 that begins with x and x extremes included there are strings therefore the position of x in the lexicographic enumeration is x i 1 s i x 1 s that can be rewritten as 1 i 1 s i s x 1 s but summing the two terms in the middle of the sum above we get the term x s while summing the other two extremal terms we get this concludes the proof of equation 1 and of the inductive definition of the proof of equation 2 follows directly by iteratively applying equation 1 if k is the cardinality of s then equation 2 can be rewritten as follows i 1 i k i qed an interesting simple consequence of the theorem above is the following corollary due to the fact that being the lexicographic order a total ordering over all the strings every string represents the number of its lexicographic enumeration corollary 2 given a number k 0 any non null natural number n is univocally repre sentable by a linear combination of powers ki c 0 k 0 c 1 k 1 cjk j where 0 ci k for all 0 i j we remark that according to the corollary above lexicographic number representation re sults a full positional representation because all the powers of k less than a maximum value give a positive contribution to the sum representing the number while classical representa tions admit the possibility of having empty

of the first m numbers in other words if the cost of representing these numbers is defined with respect to a base k as the sum of the lengths of strings representing them then no representation exists that has a lower representation cost table 2 defines operation for symbols a c g t that is coherent with the lexicographic ordering as illustrated by table 3 in fact by using table 2 we can coherently add strings in perfect accordance with their lexicographic order in general the additive table of a lexicographic system can be obtained in accordance to to the following proposition that follows directly from the previous discussion in the following when we want to avoid confusion the symbols of a k lexicographic represen tation in base k are denoted by 1 2 k with numbers in decimal notation inside brackets while symbols of a classical k positional representation with 0 are denoted by 0 1 k 1 proposition 3 given a lexicographic system of base k its additive table lk can be obtained from the additive table pk of the classical positional table i by removing all the elements corresponding to sums j 0 or 0 j for j k ii by replacing in pk any sum result 1 0 by k and iii by adding as results of the sums j k or k j for j k the elements 1 j the following algorithm provides the string that lexicographically represents the number n over an alphabet of k symbols it provides the inverse information with respect to the theorem above in fact given a positive integer n it solves the equation of unknown n 6 vincenzo manca university of verona italy algorithm 4 lexicographic number representation for any positive integer h let maxlex k h h i 1 ki minlex k h h i 1 ki 1 the first number expresses the greatest number lexicographically representable by strings of length h while the second number expresses the smallest number lexicographically repre sentable by strings of length h then given a positive integer n if minlex k h n maxlex k h then it is lexicographically representable by a string of length h and we denote this value h by lex k n or simply by lex n when k is implicitly understood in this case n is univo cally lexicographically represented by the string k n over 1 2 k according to the following recursive procedure here denotes string concatenation and the product k n n if n k k n m k n m k lex n 1 otherwise where m max q k n q klex n 1 minlex k lex n 1 qed for example let us consider 37 and 36 of course lex 4 36 lex 4 37 3 but 37 is lexicographically represented in the base 4 by 37 2 42 1 41 1 40 because 37 2 42 5 and 5 minlex 4 2 while 36 1 42 4 41 4 40 because 36 2 42 4 and 4 minlex 4 2 corollary 5 given a positive integer n the previous algorithm correctly provides the string k n representing n in the lexicographic system of base k such that k n n proof the asserted correctness easily follows by induction from the definition of lex minlex maxlex and the recursive procedure defining k n qed on the lexicographic representation of

representation in base ten where the first nine symbols 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 have the same value as in the classical decimal system while x denotes ten zero is not present the correctness of a number representation implies that any binary operation on numbers when performed on number representations has to satisfy the morphism condi tion in the algebraic sense that is has to commute with the operations on numbers and representations for the sake of simplicity both denoted by 3 n m n m multiplication in lexicographic representation can be computed with the usual algorithm of classical positional systems by using the multiplication table 4 for example the multiplication 37 3 x 147 x can be obtained with the usual multiplication algorithm of the positional representation 147 x corresponds to 1480 in the usual decimal system coherently to the correspondence of 37 3 x to the decimal pair 37 40 and to the decimal multiplication 37 40 1480 analogously to the additive table the multiplicative table of a lexicographic system can be obtained in accordance to the following proposition proposition 6 given a lexicographic system of base k its multiplicative table lk can be obtained from the multiplicative table pk of the classical positional table i by removing all the elements corresponding to multiplications j 0 or 0 j for j k ii by replacing in pk any multiplication result 1 0 by k and any multiplication result j 0 by j 1 k iii by adding as results of the multiplications j k or k j for j k the elements j 1 k corollary 7 given a positive integer n in the lexicographic system of base k symbols 1 2 k the result of multiplication k n k is represented by k n 1 k k 0 is the empty string 8 vincenzo manca university of verona italy 423 8 x 4 2 2 x 3 3 8 4 3 7 x 6 x table 5 a multiplication in the lexicographic representation of base ten in the corresponding zero positional system the same multiplica tion becomes 423 90 which usually is performed by adding a final 0 to 423 9 3807 of course 38070 transforms according to algorithm 8 into 37 x 6 x and viceversa it seems that the usual multiplication is much sim pler than the lexicographic one however also in the lexicographic system it is possible to get the result in a shorter way in fact the multiplication 423 x can be obtained according to corollary 7 by appending x to the predecessor of 423 getting 422 x then 423 8 3384 therefore shifting and summing the two partial results the final result is obtained 3 lexicographic and zeropositional representations rules can be established that transform a lexicographic representation in a given base into a classical with zero positional representation in the same base and vice versa let us denote by k n the k positional representation with zero of the number n in base k while k n is the k lexicographic representation of n algorithm 8 conversion between lexicographic and zeropositional representations the k positional with zero and k lexicographic representations are mutually translated in a 1 to 1 way by the functions 0 k and k 0 computed with the following algorithm given a string that is a positional representation with zero in base k and that does not start with the symbol 0 apart the string 0 that is intended to have order number zero then factorise as a concatenation of substrings some of i i can be empty strings 0 1 1 2 h 1 h h where factors are 0 free and factors have the form j 0 i with j 0 and i 0 now let on the lexicographic representation of numbers 9 i j 0 i 1 1 k where minus operation is computed in the k positional representation with zero then 0 k 0 1 1 2 h 1 h h analogously given a string that is a lexicographic representation in base k factorise as a concatenation of substrings some of i i can be empty strings 0 1 1 2 g 1 g g where factors are k free and factors have the form j k i with j k and i 0 now let oi j 1 0 i where in the case that j 1 k the cipher k has to be replaced by 1 0 then k 0 0 o 1 1 o 2 g 1 o g g qed the following proposition states the correctness of the translation functions 0 k and k 0 defined by the algorithm above proposition 9 0 k k n k n k 0 k n k n 10 vincenzo manca university of verona italy proof firstly we observe that if we order the alphabet 0 1 k 1 with the natural order where 0 is the minimum symbol then the number represented by a string is the enumeration order of this string according to the lexicographic ordering restricted to the strings that do not start with the symbol 0 let us denote by 0 the order number of in this ordering then the asserted equations are equivalent to the following ones in other words the translations between the two representations preserve their interpretations as numbers 0 k k n n 0 k 0 k n n in fact the translation rules of the algorithm above guarantee that translations preserve the numerical value expressed by the strings because they essentially express k as 1 0 and vice versa but at same time when this substitution is applied a carry cipher 1 has to be propagated in addition or in subtraction respectively to the ciphers on the left of the po sition where substitution was performed qed for example here base 10 is denoted by x x 0 2 x 9 x 5 301005 0 x 301005 2 x 9 x 5 x 0 2 xxx 9 xx 5 300010005 0 x 300010005 2 xxx 9 xx 5 the proof of the previous proposition puts in evidence that classical positional representa tions can be seen as a restricted form of lexicographic representation limited to a subset of strings over the k base alphabet corollary 10 given a base k 1 any number has in this base a unique positional representation with zero proof the unicity of lexicographic representation is obvious see corollary 2 therefore the unicity of positional representation with zero follows immediately from it via the trans lation k 0 qed a final remark will be useful to the discussion of the conclusive section even when the base of a positional system is a number greater than 10 for example 20 or 60 multi plication algorithms based on positional representation can be very efficient in fact by using some strategy of distributed carry as the lattice or sieve multiplication method originally pioneered by islamic mathematicians and described by fibonacci in his liber abaci and using only a subset of the multiplication table and or other tricks even com plex multiplications can be easily developed tables 6 and 7 give two examples where a on the lexicographic representation of numbers 11 427 35 5 4 5 2 5 7 3 4 3 2 3 7 0 0 5 3 2 6 3 5 5 3 2 1 3 2 2 1 3 5 6 6 5 6 1 6 2 1 3 1 4 9 4 5 table 6 a multiplication in decimal representation developed by a method of distributed carry where only multiplications by 2 and 5 are used in this method when a multiplication provides a carry then it is appended to the column on the left multiplications by ciphers different from 2 or 5 are reduced to sums of them 3 7 3 5 3 2 boxes and apices are used for clarity s sake by decorating a carry and the multiplication generating it with the same number of apices the algorithm remains essentially the same for lexicographic representations using the appropriate multiplication tables kind of lattice multiplication is joined to the restriction of multiplication tables to 2 and 5 in the first case and to 2 5 10 in the second case 12 vincenzo manca university of verona italy 7 7 35 35 7 35 7 10 7 10 7 10 7 10 7 10 7 10 7 5 7 5 7 10 10 10 10 10 10 35 35 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 9 5 table 7 the same multiplication of table 6 realized in sexagesimal rep resentation with the method of distributed carry and where only mul tiplication by 10 and 5 are used if j is the j sexagesimal cipher then 427 7 7 35 35 14945 4 9 5 here the sub notation inside brackets is decimal the adoption of another representation of cyphers for instance that one of almagest is only matter of syntactic sugar 4 conclusions the french word for computer is ordinateur certainly it relates to the fundamental arithmetic ordering generated from zero by means of successor operation 0 1 2 as basis of any numerical calculus from successor all the operations come via iteration sums are successor iterations multiplications are sum iterations exponentials are multiplication iterations differences iterate the predecessor operation the inverse of successor ordering on the lexicographic representation of numbers 13 divisions iterate difference and so on what we discover from the previous discussion is a further intriguing connection between calculus and ordering in fact string orderings are intrinsically related to number positional representations which provide efficient methods for computing the arithmetical operations in 6 the fundamental role of positional representation in the process of understanding numbers is explained by many specific examples and analyses for instance the existence of irrational numbers a masterpiece of greek mathematics becomes a simple corollary of sequence representations of numbers in fact it is easy to prove that the division of two positive integers in positional representation provides a finite sequence of ciphers or an infinite sequence of ciphers that is periodic it is a consequence of simple combina torial arguments then any rule generating an infinite sequence of ciphers that is not periodic has to denote a number that cannot be rational more sophisticated examples involve results about real and transcendental numbers 6 it is also worthwhile to recall here that the famous turing s paper of 1936 12 which was the starting point of the the ory of computability was aimed at providing a definition of computable real number as algorithmically generated infinite sequence of ciphers the kind of positional representation that is inherent to the lexicographic notation could be the basis for explaining some intriguing aspects of ancient mathematics in fact we know that even before greek mathematics in ancient civilisations complex calculations were developed babylonians were able to manage in base 60 numerical algorithms related to complex astronomical problems this ability is surely impossible without an efficient number representation in 11 the solution is reported that was given by fibonacci to the cubic equation x 3 2 x 2 10 x 20 in sexagesimal notation with an error only to the sixth fractional sex agesimal cipher 60 6 this reveals an amazing mathematical mastery of computations with sexagesimal fractions additions multiplication extraction of square roots and so on however sexagesimal tradition goes back to the almagest of ptolemy composed about a d 150 within greek culture where tables of chords essentially sines are given for every 1 2 o from 0 o to 180 o with sexagesimal primes and seconds which is equivalent to an approximation greater than three decimals fractions for instance sin 1 1 2 50 ptolemy never showed numerical computations therefore we do not know to what extent he used positional principles in computing but according to our previous analysis we know that they are independent of zero moreover as it is remarked in 11 ptolemy uses sym bol o in the first position as indication of angle degree but in the following positions for primes seconds and so on symbol o is used to denote the absence of any value for that sexagesimal position that is what now we call zero in conclusion also this confirms that sexagesimal notation is a positional system within which arithmetic efficient algorithms can be available with the full computational power of positional notation even without any explicit notion of zero in passing with ptolemy greek mathematics incorporated concepts coming from oriental cultures especially babylonian astronomy and at that time they were something well known and established probably the positions of the 14 vincenzo manca university of verona italy sexagesimal system are related to the notion of time periods as suggested by astronomi cal observations already archimedes investigating on the representation of big numbers elaborated a method of number representation based on periods more details on the historical aspect are beyond the aims of our investigation see 7 5 4 for deeper analyses however surely positional systems were related to the abacus where ciphers are expressed in some way by the number of some items in each compartments compartments play the role of positions of symbols if we consider a sort of altimetric variant of the abacus we can suggest a strict relationship between positional representation with zero and lexicographic positional representation in fact let us encode ciphers with the height of some object say a rod in a vertical compartment in this way zero is represented by the flat position of the rod while 9 is the highest position at some distance from the top which is a forbidden position cipher positions are located at equally increasing levels this is a zero altimetric abacus if otherwise flat position is forbidden but at same time the top position is the highest possible one we pass from the zero abacus to a zeroless abacus and all the properties that we investigated in the paper easily translate in the different but related ways of positioning rods in the two abaci in the middle ages positional decimal notation reached maturity and a decimal mark a point or a comma appeared in order to extend the decimal notion to fractions in this way following a different track a denotation for zero naturally could arise in fact if the decimal mark is a point separating the integer from the proper fractional part then a decimal point alone without preceding or following ciphers is a denotation of zero so far we discussed some historical implications of our analysis about positional systems with and without zero however this analysis is not only relevant for the past math ematics in fact some aspects of number representation structures and algorithms are related to emergent aspects in discrete mathematics firstly the algorithm outlined in table 6 can be easily expressed as a particular membrane system or p system in the sense of 9 where columns are membranes and the manipulation rules are transformation and movement of objects between membranes in 8 chapter 2 an example is given of an abacus as a membrane system following the same idea the multiplication method of table 6 provides an improvement of the system in 8 because computation can fully benefit from the distributed mechanism of membrane computing moreover the interest in string enumeration as suggested by the examples of section 1 is related to the mathe matical analysis of genomes they can be viewed as strings over the four letters a c g t when we fix a representation system of numbers by means of sequences over the genomic alphabet then genomes become numbers of gigantic sizes therefore the methods of string and number representations have a direct impact for the investigations that aim at find ing unconventional ways of considering genomes and new perspectives to their study and understanding on the lexicographic representation of numbers 15 references 1 boute r t zeroless positional number representation and string ordering the american math ematical monthly vol 107 no 5 437 444 may 2000 2 chabert j l et al a history of
