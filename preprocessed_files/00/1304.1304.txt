resistance measurements of graphene samples using a high q microwave dielectric resonator perturbation technique with the aim of fast and accurate measurement of microwave conductivity and sheet resistance of monolayer and few layers graphene samples the dynamic range of the microwave conductivity measurements makes this technique sensitive to a wide variety of imperfections and impurities and can provide a rapid non contacting characterisation method typically the graphene samples are supported on a low loss dielectric substrate such as quartz sapphire or sic this substrate is suspended in the near field region of a small high q sapphire puck microwave resonator the presence of the graphene perturbs both centre frequency and q value of the microwave resonator the measured data may be interpreted in terms of the real and imaginary components of the permittivity and by calculation the conductivity and sheet resistance of the graphene the method has great sensitivity and dynamic range results are reported for graphene samples grown by three different methods reduced graphene oxide go chemical vapour deposition cvd and graphene grown epitaxially on sic the latter method produces much higher conductivity values than the others mailto ling hao npl co uk 1 introduction the remarkable properties of single and few layer graphene thin films has led to an explosion of activity 1 4 a number of different methods for preparing graphene thin films have appeared and a wide range of experiments are being carried out on them 5 12 there is a great deal of variability in the quality of films prepared and even when identical methods are used the film properties between successive batches may be quite different the accepted method for characterising the electrical properties of graphene films is to measure the mobility however this generally requires patterning of the films and making electrical contact the provision of a gate voltage to tune the carrier density is also often necessary the additional processes mean that quality assessment of the films is time consuming and requires physical intervention on the graphene wafer here we report development of a quick non invasive and non contacting method for measurement of the microwave surface impedance and hence the conductivity and sheet resistance of graphene thin films a similar technique has been used previously to examine a variety of other materials 13 14 however the advantage of our method is that exact solution of the mode geometries is not necessary under the conditions which are specified below it is not necessary to carry out a detailed mode matching or finite element electromagnetic model to derive the electrical parameters of the te film the conductivity and sheet resistance are derived by reference to measurements on a similar bare substrate to that on which the graphene sample is deposited 2 outline of the method consider the arrangement shown in figure 1 a a single crystal sapphire puck acts as a microwave dielectric resonator contained within a copper housing it is spaced away from the copper housing by a short quartz spacer tube a plain low loss dielectric substrate of thickness ts can be brought to a fixed position in relation to this sapphire puck resonator see figure 1 b and the resulting shift in both the resonant frequency fs and the linewidth ws can be measured provided the quality factor of the sapphire resonator is high enough compared with the losses contributed by the substrate now take another nominally identical substrate coated with a uniform layer of graphene of thickness tg see figure 1 c position it in the same position relative to the sapphire puck and make further measurements of the resonant frequency shift fg and linewidth shift wg finally measure the unperturbed sapphire puck resonant frequency f 0 and linewidth w 0 with only puck and support quartz tubes in the copper housing see figure 1 d 3 quantitative analysis since tg ts and also tg g the electromagnetic skin depth of graphene at microwave frequencies we may assume to a good approximation that the field distributions in the bare substrate and graphene coated substrate situations are the same thus we may apply perturbation theory to evaluate the surface impedance of the graphene provided that the complex permittivity and thickness of the bare substrate are known w dve ff s s 2 0 1 1 a b c d figure 1 a photo of sapphire puck and quartz spacer tubes inside copper housing lid removed b d schematic diagram of the high q sapphire dielectric resonator for measurement of the surface impedance of graphene samples b a plain substrate c an identical substrate with graphene film and d with neither substrate just the dielectric resonator and support structures where e is the field within the substrate and the integral is over the substrate volume w is the total stored energy in the puck and substrate system s is real part of the substrate permittivity due to the assumptions above that the graphene layer is very thin its presence in the second measurement will not significantly perturb the total field distribution in the system however the complex permittivity of the thin film may contribute significantly to the frequency shift and the linewidth shift w dve 1 dve 1 ff 2 g 2 s 0 g 2 where now the second integral is over the volume of the graphene film only and g is real part of the permittivity of the graphene since the volume of the graphene is always far smaller than the substrate volume whereas the real permittivities are likely to be similar in magnitude the second term in the above integral can be ignored to first order similar expressions can be written for the linewidth shifts in both cases w dve fw 2 s 0 s 3 w dvedve fw 2 g 2 s 0 g 4 where s and g are imaginary part of the permittivity of the substrate and the graphene respectively note that in the case of the imaginary components we cannot ignore the second term in the integral since graphene is a conductor with conductivity comparable to that of a metal in which case g s the readily measurable quantities are fs and wg ws and the latter may be expressed as ss gs g g sg t tf w dve fww 1 2 0 5 here we have assumed that both for graphene and bare substrate the electric field is uniform throughout the thickness a reasonable assumption provided the substrate is much thinner than the height of the puck the aim of this measurement is to derive a surface resistance or sheet resistance rs value for the graphene film since this will also enable us to estimate the graphene conductivity and the mobility if we are able to estimate the carrier density we know that g s t r 1 6 there is a simple relationship

directly on top of the sapphire resonator shifts the frequency downwards by around 200 mhz while producing no significant reduction in the quality factor q of the resonance which at room temperature is around 1 x 10 4 the presence of a single layer of graphene on such a quartz substrate produces a large reduction in q value and a further small shift in the resonant frequency in figure 2 the upper trace shows an example of a resonance with plain quartz substrate and the lower trace shows a similar trace with a sample of cvd grown graphene 12 transferred onto a nominally identical quartz substrate note the reduction q by a factor of approximately 10 in the latter case figure 2 measured s 12 transmission versus frequency for both a bare quartz substrate upper trace and a quartz substrate with transferred cvd graphene lower trace the narrower resonance higher q corresponds to the bare quartz sample and note that the linewidth is approximately 3 times greater for the cvd sample compared with bare quartz crosses are experimental points and solid lines are the lorentzian fit to the data nb the two are almost indistinguishable to the eye the resonant frequency and linewidth are measured in transmission with a vector network analyser vna being used to measure s 12 as a function of frequency the internal software of the vna hp 8720 is used to collect the centre frequency and 3 db linewidth but in addition the full trace data 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 0 5 10 548 10 550 10 552 10 554 10 556 10 558 10 560 t ra n sm is si o n s 1 2 li n e a r p o w e r frequency ghz 200 frequency points is downloaded to a computer and a non linear least squares fit routine is used to fit the data to a skewed lorentzian lineshape by this method we have found that the uncertainty in centre frequency and in linewidth is reduced by a factor of 10 compared with the results output directly from the vna using the above dielectric resonator technique we have made measurements on a number of samples of graphene grown by different techniques for samples with rather high conductivity it has sometimes been necessary to reduce the influence of the graphene layer on the quality factor of the system by inserting a small quartz tube spacer a few mm in height between the sapphire puck and the graphene sample as shown schematically in figure 1 in this way the influence on the resonant properties is reduced so that the q value can be accurately measured in table 1 and table 2 we compare liquid phase grown graphene oxide go subsequently reduced rgo 15 cvd graphene grown on a copper catalyst layer 12 and then transferred to a clean quartz substrate permittivity 4 4 10 x 10 mm and 0 5 mm thick finally two separate samples of epitaxially grown graphene on sic are also shown these are of considerably higher quality than any of the other films examined as shown by the much lower sheet resistance values note that the range of sheet resistance values measured spans almost four orders of magnitude demonstrating the great sensitivity and dynamic range of the method in our method we can derive sheet resistance rs without the need to measure the thickness of the graphene since sheet resistance derived by equation 8 is independent of thickness it is clear from the results in the table that as would be expected the rgo sample has a conductivity considerably higher than the as grown go sample for same thickness it is the reduction process which converts the sample into a semi metallic state comparing the rgo and cvd sample conductivities it is clear that the latter is more metallic than the former again unsurprising given the nature of the wafer scale growth process for cvd for monolayer graphene on sic the conductivity is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the monolayer cvd graphene and the sheet resistance is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the cvd sample table 1 summary of properties of

above and the results shown in table 1 and 2 confirm that the dielectric resonator technique provides a quick and straightforward method for analysing the conducting properties of graphene samples note that no patterning or electrical contacts are required which may damage or compromise the sample quality the sample can be placed on top of the puck or quartz spacer without requiring adhesive another potentially damaging addition the method has the great sensitivity and dynamic range for single layer conductivity of cvd sample is 1 92 x 10 5 s m which is about 5 times better that the reduced go the best conductivity 4 64 x 10 7 s m and sheet resistance rs 27 are for single layer graphene on sic thus the method shows great promise for rapid quality control and characterisation it also may be extended in future to cryogenic or elevated temperature measurement 16 acknowledgments we thank dr c mattevi of imperial college for providing graphene oxide samples this work was funded
