minimal surfaces in the 3 sphere by desingularizing intersecting clifford tori nikolaos kapouleas and david wiygul abstract for each integer k 2 we apply gluing methods to construct sequences of minimal surfaces embedded in the round 3 sphere we produce two types of sequences all desingularizing collections of intersecting clifford tori sequences of the first type converge to a collection of k clifford tori intersecting with maximal symmetry along these two circles near each of the circles after rescaling the sequences converge smoothly on compact subsets to a karcher scherk tower of order k sequences of the second type desingularize a collection of the same k clifford tori supplemented by an additional clifford torus equidistant from the original two circles of intersection so that the latter torus orthogonally intersects each of the former k tori along a pair of disjoint orthogonal circles near which the corresponding rescaled sequences converge to a singly periodic scherk surface the simpler examples of the first type resemble surfaces constructed by choe and soret 2 by different methods where the number of handles desingularizing each circle is the same there is a plethora of new examples which are more complicated and on which the number of handles for the two circles differs examples of the second type are new as well 1 introduction the general framework after totally geodesic 2 spheres clifford tori represent the next simplest minimal embeddings of closed surfaces in the round unit 3 sphere s 3 in fact marques and neves 19 in their proof of the willmore conjecture have identified clifford tori as the unique area minimizers among all embedded closed minimal surfaces of genus at least one and brendle 1 has shown they are the only embedded minimal tori affirming a conjecture of lawson the first examples of higher genus minimal surfaces in s 3 were produced by lawson himself 18 and further examples were found later by karcher pinkall and sterling 17 both constructions proceed by solving plateau s problem for suitably chosen boundary and extending the solution to a closed surface by reflection in this article we carry out certain constructions by using gluing techniques by singular per turbation methods one begins with a collection of known embedded minimal surfaces these ingredients are then glued together to produce a new embedded surface called the initial surface having small but nonvanishing mean curvature introduced in gluing the construction is successful when the initial surfaces are close to a singular limit the construction is then completed by per turbing the surface to minimality without sacrificing embeddedness of course the size of the mean curvature and the feasibility of perturbing the surface so as to eliminate it both depend crucially on the design of the initial surface gluing methods have been applied extensively and with great success in gauge theories by don aldson taubes and others in many geometric problems similar to the one studied in this article obstructions appear to solving the linearized equation an extensive methodology has been devel oped to deal with this difficulty in a large class of geometric problems starting with 25 5 and with further refinements in 6 we refer to 8 for a general discussion of this gluing methodology and 9 for a detailed general discussion of doubling and desingularization constructions for minimal surfaces in this article however we limit ourselves to constructions of unusually high symmetry except in section 8 and this way we avoid these difficulties entirely 1 ar x iv 1 70 1 05 65 8 v 1 m at h d g 2 0 ja n 20 17 the first desingularization construction by gluing methods for minimal surfaces with intersection curves which are not straight lines was carried out in 7 and serves as a prototype see for example 12 13 20 for desingularizations of rotationally invariant surfaces with transverse intersections without triple or higher points an independent construction by traizet 26 has straight lines as intersections for one earlier application of the gluing methodology in the context of minimal surfaces in s 3 see 14 where a doubling construction of the clifford torus is carried out this work has been extended in 27 for stackings of the clifford torus and in 10 for doublings of the equatorial two sphere the present construction also glues tori but by desingularization rather than doubling the idea of a desingularization construction for intersecting minimal surfaces in a riemannian three manifold is to start with a collection of minimal surfaces intersecting along some curves and to produce a single embedded minimal surface by desingularizing the curves of intersection assuming transverse intersection this is accomplished at the level of the initial surface through the replacement of a tubular neighborhood of each component curve of the intersection set by a surface which on small scales approximates a minimal surface in euclidean space desingularizing the intersection of a collection of planes along a single line in prior desingularization constructions the appropriate models for these desingularizing surfaces were furnished by the classical scherk towers of 24 which desingularize the intersection of two planes one novelty of the present article is our use of the more general karcher scherk towers introduced in 15 which come in families desingularizing any number of intersecting planes and so accommodate curves of intersection whose complements in small neighborhoods of the curves contain more than four components note that although having more than two minimal surfaces intersect along a curve is not a generic situation it can happen in rotationally invariant cases as for example in the case of coaxial catenoids extending the results of 7 to such situations for example is an interesting but difficult problem because one would have to use the full family of karcher scherk towers as studied in 22 a motivation for our construction is the observation 15 section 2 7 that lawson s surfaces may be regarded as desingularizations of a collection of great 2 spheres intersecting with maximal symmetry along a common equator in this article we pursue analogous constructions with tori instead of spheres as proposed in 9 section 4 page 300 pitts and rubinstein have described one class of surfaces item 10 on table 1 of 23 similar to some of our surfaces to be obtained by min max methods recently choe and soret 2 have produced examples by solving plateau s problem for a suitably selected boundary in the spirit of 18 their examples resemble the simpler examples we construct to prove they are the same one would have to prove that the solution of the plateau problem is unique see remark 4 19 our construction has been developed independently and is more general in ways we describe below and our strategy is quite different based as we already mentioned on gluing techniques by singular perturbation methods on the other hand our methods work only for high genus surfaces to outline we construct two infinite families of embedded minimal surfaces in s 3 the first family consists of desingularizations of a configurationwk see 3 8 of k 2 clifford tori intersecting symmetrically along a pair of disjoint great circles c 1 and c 2 which lie on two orthogonal two planes in r 4 the second family consists of desingularizations of a configuration w k see 3 8 which is the previous one augmented by the clifford torus which is equidistant from c 1 and c 2 in both cases the construction is based on choosing scaffoldings that is unions of great circles contained in the given configuration and which we demand to be contained in the minimal surfaces we construct moreover reflections with respect to the great circles contained in the scaffoldings are required to be symmetries of our constructions we denote the scaffoldings we choose by ck m wk or c k m w k see 3 23 to construct the initial surfaces we replace tubular neighborhoods of the intersection circles with surfaces modeled on appropriately scaled and truncated maximally symmetric karcher scherk 2 towers towers with 2 k ends are used along c 1 and c 2 while classical scherk towers with 4 ends are used along other circles of intersection present only in w k the replacements are made so that each initial surface is closed and embedded contains the applicable scaffolding and is invariant under reflection through every scaffold circle see definition 4 13 these initial surfaces are perturbed then to minimality in a way which respects the reflections so the surfaces produced are closed embedded minimal and still contain the scaffolding see the main theorem 7 1 note that lawson s approach also makes use of a scaffolding our approach however gives much more freedom in the number of handles we include in the fundamental domain while in lawson s method the fundamental domain is a disc so that plateau s problem can be solved this makes no difference when considering the original construction of lawson in 18 we expect that the construction with more handles in the fundamental domain will still produce a lawson surface even though it does not a priori impose all the symmetries of the surface when there are more than two circles of intersection involved however we can choose different numbers of handles on each of them and this gives a plethora of new surfaces as in the present constructions see the main theorem 7 1 it seems also rather daunting to try to construct even the simplest of our surfaces desingularizing w k by lawson s method the present constructions motivate two important new directions for further study first what other similar desingularization constructions can be carried out in cases where there are obstructions due to less symmetry one has to deal then with the obstructions in the usual way by introducing smooth families of initial surfaces with the parameters corresponding to the obstructions as in earlier work see 7 9 11 we discuss this question in section 8 and we provide some partial answers second as remarked in the end of 9 section 4 2 there are various natural questions about rigidity and uniqueness for the surfaces presently constructed which are similar to those asked 9 questions 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 about the lawson surfaces in particular we are currently working to prove that the surfaces desingularizing wk can not be smoothly deformed to surfaces desingularizing k clifford tori still intersecting along c 1 and c 2 but with different angles that is they cannot flap their wings more precisely we hope to prove that even with reduced symmetries imposed so flapping the wings is allowed there are no new jacobi fields on our surfaces outline of the approach as we have already mentioned the main difficulty of this construction as compared to earlier results is proving that under the symmetries imposed there is no kernel on the karcher scherk towers as for the classical singly periodic scherk surfaces k 2 7 this is achieved by subdividing the surface suitably and applying the montiel ros approach 21 our approach is also somewhat different than usual in some other aspects and we employ the high symmetry we have available organization of the presentation in section 2 we study in sufficient detail the maximally symmetric karcher scherk towers using the enneper weirstrass representation and following 15 in section 3 we study the geometry of the clifford tori and the initial configurations we will be using later their symmetries and the symmetries and scaffoldings we will impose in our constructions later in section 4 we discuss in detail the construction of the initial surfaces and we study their geometry in section 5 we provide estimates for the geometric quantities on the initial surfaces in section 6 we study the linearized equation and estimate its solutions on the initial surfaces we finally combine these results to establish the main theorem in section 7 finally in section 8 we discuss further results using more technology notation and conventions given an open set of a submanifold immersed in an ambient manifold endowed with metric g an exponent 0 1 and a tensor field t on possibly taking 3 values in the normal bundle we define the pointwise ho lder seminorm 1 1 t x sup y bx t x yxt y g d x y where bx denotes the open geodesic ball with respect to g with center x and radius the minimum of 1 and the injectivity radius at x g denotes the pointwise norm induced by g yx denotes parallel transport also induced by g from y to x along the unique geodesic in bx joining y and x and d x y denotes the distance between x and y given further a continuous positive function f r and a nonnegative integer assuming that t is a section of the bundle e over all of whose order partial derivatives with respect to any coordinate system exist and are continuous we set 1 2 t c e g f t f j 0 sup x djt x f x d t x f x where d denotes the levi civita connection determined by g in case e is the trivial bundle r instead of c e g f we write c g f when f 1 we write just c g and when 0 we write just c g additionally if g is a group acting a on a set b and if a is a subset of b then we refer to the subgroup 1 3 stabg a g g ga a as the stabilizer of a in g when a is a subset of euclidean 3 space or the round 3 sphere we will set 1 4 gsym a stabisoma where isom o 3 or o 4 for a subset c of euclidean space or the round 3 sphere we define 1 5 grefl c to be the group generated by reflections with respect to the lines or great circles contained in c here reflection through a great circle can be defined as the restriction to the 3 sphere of reflection in r 4 through the 2 plane containing the circle if g is a group of isometries of a riemannian manifold with a two sided immersed submanifold then we call g stabg even if g preserves the sides of and odd if it exchanges them in this two sided case sections of the normal bundle of may be represented by functions on which stabg then acts according to gu x 1 gu g 1 x where 1 g is defined to be 1 for g even and 1 for g odd we append a subscript g to the spaces of functions defined above to designate the subspace which is stabg equivariant in this sense so that for instance 1 6 c k g g f u ck g f u g 1 x 1 gu x x g stabg finally we make extensive use of cutoff functions and for this reason we fix a smooth function r 0 1 with the following properties i is nondecreasing ii 1 on 1 and 0 on 1 and iii 1 2 is an odd function given then a b r with a 6 b we define a smooth function a b r 0 1 by 1 7 a b la b where la b r r is the linear function defined by the requirements l a 3 and l b 3 clearly then a b has the following properties 4 i a b is weakly monotone ii a b 1 on a neighborhood of b and a b 0 on a neighborhood of a and iii a b b a 1 on r acknowledgments the authors would like to thank richard schoen for his continuous support and interest in the results of this article n k was partially supported by nsf grants

towers of order k 2 which we will denote by sk sk is a singly periodic complete minimal surface embedded in euclidean 3 space asymptotic to k planes intersecting at equal angles along a line this line which we call the axis of sk is parallel to the direction of periodicity the classical singly periodic scherk tower 24 asymptotic to two orthogonal planes is recovered by taking k 2 although in this article we will only use sk in our constructions it is worth mentioning that there is a continuous family of singly periodic minimal surfaces with scherk type ends which has been studied by pe rez and traizet in 22 and in which family sk is the most symmetric member we proceed to outline the construction of karcher 15 note that sk which we will define in detail later differs by a scaling and rotation from the surface described now karcher considered the enneper weierstrass data of 2 1 gauss map k 1 and height differential 1 k k d on the closed unit disc in c punctured at the 2 kth roots of 1 the embedding defined by the data maps the origin to a saddle point the k line segments joining opposite roots of 1 to horizontal lines of symmetry intersecting at equal angles the 2 k radii terminating at roots of unity to alternately ascending and descending curves of finite length lying in k vertical planes of symmetry and the 2 k circumferential arcs between consecutive roots of 1 to curves of infinite length lying alternately in one of two horizontal planes of symmetry the union of this region with its reflection through either horizontal plane of symmetry is a fundamental domain for the tower under periodic vertical translation the images of small neighborhoods of the roots of 1 are asymptotic to vertical half planes which bisect the vertical planes of symmetry for future reference the following proposition fills in the details of the above outline and sum marizes the basic geometric properties of sk including its symmetries and asymptotic behavior to state the lemma we make a few preliminary definitions first we define the sets h a union of horizontal planes and v k a union of vertical planes by 2 2 h n z z n and v k j z y x tan j k whose intersection is the union of horizontal lines 2 3 ck h v k we enumerate the connected components of the complement of h v k by 2 4 bk l j r cos r sin z r 0 j k j 1 k z l l 1 5 for each l j z and we also define a partition of r 3 h v k into disjoint sets ak and a k given by 2 5 ak l j 2 z bk l j and a k l j 2 z 1 bk l j to describe the symmetries of sk we write r p for reflection in r 3 through the plane p t a for translation in r 3 by a units along the directed line and r for rotation in r 3 through angle about the directed line according to the usual orientation conventions a horizontal bar over a subset of r 3 denotes its topological closure in r 3 and angled brackets enclosing a list of elements or sets of elements of o 3 indicate the subgroup generated by all the elements listed or included in the sets mentioned proposition 2 6 for every integer k 2 there is a complete embedded minimal surface sk r 3 such that i sk h ck sk ck ak and every straight line on sk is contained in ck ii for any connected component b of ak the intersection sk b is an open disc with sk b ck b the union of four horizontal rays iii for each non negative integer m the quotient surface sk t 2 m z axis has 2 k ends and genus k 1 m 1 iv grefl ck gsym sk gsym ak gsym a k gsym ck recall 1 4 and 1 5 and gsym sk acts transitively on the set of connected components of sk ck the set of connected components of ak and the set of connected components of a k v grefl ck r 2 k z axis r x axis t 2 z axis vi gsym sk r 2 k z axis r x axis t 2 z axis r 2 k r z 2 grefl ck r 2 k r z 2 vii gsym ck gsym sk r k z axisgsym sk gsym sk t z axisgsym sk and viii there exists rk 0 so that sk x 2 y 2 rk has 2 k connected components all isometric by the symmetries exactly one of which lies in the region r cos r sin z r 0 2 k z r and the intersection of this component with x rk is the graph x wk x z z x rk z r over the xz plane of a function wk rk r r which decays exponentially in the sense that j 0 we have 2 7 jx zwk x z c k j e x proof the usual inner weierstrass recipe see 16 for example or any standard reference for the classical theory of minimal surfaces defines from the data 2 1 a minimal surface in r 3 parametrized by the closed unit disc in c punctured at the 2 kth roots of 1 requiring the parametrization to 6 take the origin in c to the origin in r 3 it takes the form 2 8 x w re w 0 1 2 k 2 1 2 k d 1 k 2 k j 1 re j ln w j y w re w 0 i 1 2 k 2 1 2 k d 1 k 2 k j 1 im j ln w j z w re w 0 2 k 1 1 2 k d 1 k 2 k j 1 1 j 1 arg j w j where j e i 1 2 j 2 k is the jth 2 kth root of 1 and arg is the imaginary part of the branch of the logarithmic function cut along the ray from 0 to and taking the value 0 at 1 the symmetries can be read from the data by the following standard argument looking at the expression for the metric 2 9 d s 2 k 1 1 k 1 2 1 k k d 2 in terms of the enneper weierstrass data 2 1 one identifies as intrinsic geodesics both circumfer ential arcs on the unit circle and diametric segments joining opposite 2 kth roots of 1 looking next at the expression for the second fundamental form 2 10 atow v v 2 k 1 re d v 1 k k d v in terms of the enneper weierstrass data it becomes apparent that the diametric segments joining opposite 2 kth roots of 1 are extrinsic geodesics as well which are therefore mapped to euclidean lines while the diametric segments joining opposite 2 kth roots of unity along with the circumfer ential arcs are lines of curvature which being also intrinsic geodesics are necessarily mapped to planar curves consultation of 2 8 confirms that a the straight lines lie along the intersection of the single horizontal plane z 0 with the vertical planes of the form 2 k n k for n z b the images of the circumferential arcs lie alternatingly in the two horizontal planes z 2 k and c the images of the remaining lines of curvature lie consecutively in the vertical planes of the form n k for n z below we will check that the parametrization 2 8 is in fact an embedding of the punctured unit disc in fact we will show that the image of the punctured sector 2 11 d rei 0 r 1 0 2 k 1 is embedded and intersects the planes z 0 z 2 k 0 and 2 k only along the curves just mentioned the reflection principle for harmonic functions then implies that this image may be extended to a complete embedded minimal surface s k invariant under reflection through any line in 1 k ck and through any plane of the form 2 k j k or z 2 k j k for j z we define sk kr 2 k z axiss k items ii and iii and the first two claims of item i follow immediately as do the contain ments grefl ck gsym ak gsym sk considering that item v and the equalities gsym ak gsym a k r 2 k z axis r x axis t 2 z axis r 2 k r z 2 are clear from the definitions 2 3 and 2 5 of ck ak and a k alone to see the containment gsym sk gsym ck note that any symmetry of the tower must permute the asymptotic planes so must preserve their intersection so must take 7 any line in ck to a line orthogonally intersecting the z axis we are assuming and confirm with the maximum principle argument below that sk intersects the z axis only where ck does and from the expression 2 10 for the second fundamental form we know we have already accounted for all lines on sk through such points the equalities gsym ck gsym ak r k z axisgsym ak gsym ak t z axisgsym ak are also immediate consequences of the definitions in particular reflection through the z 0 plane preserves ck but it does not preserve sk because for example the normal to sk is not constantly vertical along the lines sk z 0 so gsym sk 6 gsym ck now since gsym ak has index 2 in gsym ck and gsym ak gsym sk gsym ck in fact gsym ak gsym sk thus we have checked items ii vii as well as the first two claims of i and the transitivity claim in iv is now obvious to verify the remaining claim in i note that any straight line in sk by virtue of the latter s minimality is a line of reflectional symmetry on the other hand reflection through a straight line in r 3 preserves ak only if the line is the z axis and then only for k even or if it is contained in ck or t 2 z axisr 2 k z axisck it is easy to see however that of these lines only those contained in ck lie on the surface for example 2 1 and 2 8 reveal that at easily identified points where any of the other lines do intersect the surface the normal to the surface there is parallel to the line in addition to checking viii it remains to show that the image of the region d is embedded and intersects the planes z 0 z 2 k 0 and 2 k as described above that the tower is embedded may be established by recognizing the conjugate surface of the region between two consecutive horizontal planes of symmetry as a graph specifically the solution to the jenkins serrin problem 4 on a regular 2 k gon and then appealing to a theorem of krust see 16 for details on this approach alternatively we show embeddedness more directly as follows and in the process identify the intersection of the image of d with these four planes recall that d is the punctured sector rei 0 r 1 0 2 k 1 from 2 8 it is clear that dz is positive along the radial segment from the origin to 1 and vanishes along both the radial segment from the origin to 1 and the circular arc from 1 to 1 a sufficiently small circular arc centered at j which originates on the segment from 0 to 1 and terminates on the circumferential arc from 1 to 1 can be seen from 2 8 to have height monotonically increasing from 0 to 2 k the maximum principle then implies that the image of d is contained in the slab 0 z 2 k and intersects z 0 only along the straight horizontal image of the radial segment to 1 and z 2 k only along the horizontal image of the circumferential arc similarly from 2 8 one may readily check monotonicity of dx dy and re 1 dy im 1 dx on the boundary curves of d in order to establish that the boundary has image contained in the wedge r cos r sin z r 0 2 k 0 z r moreover 2 8 reveals that in d lim w 1 x w 2 12 lim w 1 y w and 2 13 lim w 1 re 1 y w im 1 x w 0 2 14 so that another application of the maximum principle to the harmonic coordinate functions x y and re 1 y im 1 x the last extended to the closure of d establishes that the image of d is contained in r cos r sin z r 0 2 k 0 0 z 2 k and intersects 0 only along the image of the radial segment to 1 and 2 k only along the image of the radial segment to 1 because of the symmetries it therefore suffices to show that the enneper weierstrass parametriza tion restricts to d as an embedding to this end observe first that each level curve of y in d is connected indeed one can verify that dy vanishes nowhere on d and has norm relative to dz 2 8 tending to infinity at 1 so y y 2 defines a smooth vector field on the closure of d the corre sponding flow for time t when it exists maps points other than the fixed point 1 with y y 0 to points with y y 0 t examining the field at the boundary one can check that the backward flow of a point in d exits d only after it reaches the segment joining 0 and 1 while the forward flow leaves d only through the real boundary segment thus if the flow for time t 0 of a point x on the real segment from 0 to 1 lies in d then the flow for time t of any real point to the right of x will also lie in d now given w 1 w 2 d with y w 1 y w 2 y 0 0 the flow for time y 0 takes each point to a point on the real segment of d since by the maximum principle and earlier monotonicity arguments this segment is the entirety of the y 0 curve in d by the previous considerations the flow for time y 0 exists for every point on the real segment joining these points so the flow for time y 0 being a continuous function of the initial point we get a level y y 0 path joining w 1 and w 2 now suppose there exist points w 1 w 2 d such that x w 1 x w 2 and y w 1 y w 2 then there is a path contained in a single level curve of y joining w 1 and w 2 and if w 1 and w 2 are distinct by the mean value theorem there exists a third point w 3 between w 1 and w 2 on this path at which dx vanishes along the path thus at w 3 the gradients x and y must be parallel one finds from 2 8 that these gradients are parallel only on the circular boundary of d where they are tangential to the boundary and therefore they are endpoints of level curves so that we may assume w 3 is not such a point thus we conclude that w 1 w 2 showing not only that the enneper weierstrass parametrization is an embedding but also that its image of the unit disc is actually a graph over a region in the z 0 plane now we prove viii it is clear from 2 8 that for r sufficiently large the set of w in the unit disc with x 2 w y 2 w r 2 has 2 k components each containing exactly one of the 2 kth roots of 1 we define s w re 1 x w im 1 y w and 2 15 t w im 1 x w re 1 y w 2 16 so that t w is the signed distance of the image of w from the plane 2 k and 2 17 x w y w z w s w re 1 im 1 0 z w 0 0 1 t w im 1 re 1 0 the three terms on the right being pairwise orthogonal we will show that for rk sufficiently large there is a correspondingly small neighborhood 1 of 1 in the closed unit disc such that the map f c 2 k j 1 c j c 1 c defined by 2 18 f w s w z w restricts to a diffeomorphism from 1 onto the half strip rk 2 k 2 k working from 2 8 we find 2 19 kt w ln k j 2 w jw 21 j im 1 j 2 20 kz w arg 1 w 1 arg 2 k j 2 1 w j 1 j 1 arg 1 w 1 z w 9 and 2 21 ks w ln w 1 ln w 1 k j 2 re 1 j ln w j w 21 j ln w 1 c s w where c lim w 1 ks w ln w j and s and z are defined by the equalities where they are introduced then lim w 1 s w lim w 1 z w 0 and for each nonnegative integer there exists a constant c k 0 such that 2 22 sup w 1 j 0 jw jw s w jw jw z w c k defining the map g c c by 2 23 g w 1 1 e kw c we see that for r sufficiently large the composite f g r is well defined identifying c with r 2 as usual and 2 24 f g w w 1 k s i z g w so since lim rew g w 1 and lim rew j wg w 0 for each integer j 0 by taking r large enough we can ensure that f g r is a small perturbation of the identity and so a diffeomorphism with image containing the half strip rk 2 k 2 k for some rk r thus f itself restricts to a diffeomorphism from some region 1 onto this half strip as asserted above which shows that the image of 1 under the enneper weierstrass parametrization is the graph of t f 1 over the half strip r cos 2 k r sin 2 k z r rk z 2 k since t is smooth on 1 t 1 0 and f 1 g f g 1 we finally obtain the estimates 2 25 js jz t f 1 s iz c k e ks the union ck of all horizontal lines on sk can be regarded as a scaffolding for the tower but we emphasize that a tower is not uniquely determined by a choice of scaffold remark 2 26 i the surface t z axissk r k z axissk satisfies all conditions in the lemma provided the roles of ak and a k are reversed in the statement so in particular its intersection with h is ck ii for m a positive integer the surface m 1 sk also has ck as its intersection with h but the quotient surface m 1 sk t 2 z axis has genus k 1 m 1 6 0 instead of 0 recall 2 6 iii 3 the initial configurations the clifford tori in this subsection we discuss the clifford tori and their geometry we first introduce some helpful notation given a great circle c in s 3 we will write c for the furthest great circle from it note that the points of c are at distance 2 in s 3 from c and any point of s 3 c is at distance 2 from c as viewed from r 4 the planes containing c and c are orthogonal complements on the other hand c and c may be regarded as parallel in that the function on s 3 measuring distance from one of the circles is constant on the other this relation 10 of parallelism between two great circles in s 3 is not transitive another useful characterization of c identifies it as the set of poles of great two spheres with equator c definition 3 1 clifford tori if c and c are as above then we call them totally orthogonal we define the clifford torus t c with axis circles c and c to be the set of points in s 3 equidistant from c and c t c can be alternatively defined as the set of points which are at a distance 4 from c or equivalently at a distance 4 from c clearly t c t c the set of points at distance 4 from t c is c c and the set of points at distance 4 from t c is s 3 c c t c is a flat square embedded torus foliated by the circles of radius 1 2 in r 4 where great two spheres having c as equator and poles on c intersect t and also by the circles orthogonally intersecting these where great two spheres having equator c and poles on c intersect t in pairs on opposite sides of the equator evidently any element of o 4 that preserves c c as a set is a symmetry of t c the group of these symmetries includes arbitrary rotation or reflection in the two circles as well as orthogonal transformations exchanging the circles to proceed further we have the following definition 3 2 the rotations r c given c as above r and assuming an orientation chosen on the totally orthogonal circle c we define r c rotation about c by angle to be the element of so 4 preserving c pointwise and rotating the totally orthogonal circle c through an angle according to the chosen orientation on c just as well r c may be called rotation in c by angle we assume now that orientations have been chosen for both c and c of course after orienting s 3 an orientation on a circle c determines an orientation on c we define then two so 2 subgroups of o 4 by 3 3 h c r cr c r each of whose elements rotates c and c simultaneously by a common angle the two subgroups being distinguished by the relative sense of rotation in the circles it is easy to see that any such one parameter subgroup of o 4 acting by common rotation in a pair of totally orthogonal circles has only great circles as orbits moreover by an easy calculation the orbits of h c intersect the orbits of h c at an angle equal to twice the distance from c consequently t c itself is foliated by two such families of great circles with the circles of one family intersecting the circles of the other orthogonally more explicitly let d d t c be great circles through some given point p t c with d an orbit of h c and d an orbit of h c then one family consists of the images of d under the action of h c and the other of the images of d under the action of h c reflection through d that is r d preserves the great circles in t c which are orthogonal to d since these great circles foliate t c we conclude that the reflection r d is a symmetry of t c it follows that any point of a clifford torus lies on a circle of reflection two in fact and this immediately implies the minimality of the torus since the symmetry allows the mean curvature nowhere to point of course the two great circles through a point are asymptotic lines for the second fundamental form the short circles mentioned above latitudes 4 from the poles of great two spheres with equator one of the axis circles bisect these and as such are circles of principal curvature these circles have curvature 2 in r 4 and 1 in s 3 showing that the second fundamental form of t c has constant norm 2 this also implies that there are no great circles on t c other than the orbits of h c as above and therefore reflection through any great circle in t c is a symmetry of t c 11 given now d and d as above r cr c rotates the points of d to a parallel great circle along orthogonal geodesic segments parallel to d taking 2 we conclude that r 2 c r 2 c d and similarly r 2 c r 2 c d are great circles which are parallel to d and d respectively on t c at distance 2 this implies that 3 4 r 2 c r 2 c d d and r 2 c r 2 c d d moreover the elements of h c which were originally expressed as common rotations in c and c are just as well common rotations in d and d since r cr c and r dr d obviously have the same action on d and d which are orbits of h c and are the intersections with s 3 of two 2 planes spanning r 4 and hence h c h d if we choose orientations on d and d appropriately or if we choose an orientation on s 3 similarly h c h d since d and d are orbits of h c by the above t c is ruled by two families of great circles and any great circle on t c belongs to one of the two families any two circles in a single family are thereby not only parallel in t c but also parallel in s 3 in the sense of distance as defined above moreover t c is generated by twisting about any one of its great circles d an orthogonally intersecting great circle d where the twisting is common rotation in d and d traversing d the conormal co rotates with the position vector tracing out d and d at equal rates in this sense the clifford torus resembles the helicoid but the helicoid is just singly ruled while all of the clifford torus great circles are on equal footing additionally while each helicoid is either right or left handed every clifford torus is ambidextrous being right handed along the circles of one foliation and left handed along the others more precisely given an orientation on s 3 a clifford torus t c and a great circle d t c we call d right handed if h dt c t c and left handed if h dt c t c furthermore an element r d of o 4 fixing a great circle d on t c pointwise but rotating d along itself will of course preserve d and d as sets but rotate t c such considerations reveal the existence of a one parameter family r dt c r of clifford tori each intersecting t c transversely along d and d at a constant angle since two great circles intersecting d orthogonally can meet only on d or d unless they coincide everywhere the ruling forbids distinct members of this family from intersecting anywhere else more precisely for 1 2 r r 1 d t c r 2 d t c when 1 2 mod and r 1 d t c r 2 d t c d d otherwise there is a second one parameter family of clifford tori through d and d having the opposite chirality along both compared to the first family this family can be obtained from the first by for example reflection through a great two sphere containing d or d a member of one family then intersects each member of the other family along two pairs of circles d and d as well as two more circles d and d where d and d intersect d and d orthogonally the angle of intersection varies from 0 to 4 along these circles with tangency of the surfaces occurring at the eight points where the four circles intersect in pairs note that by the above if d is any great circle then any clifford torus t which contains d contains also d moreover t belongs to one of two families of clifford tori containing d d as described above also for each point p s 3 d d there is a unique torus in each family which contains it and on that torus there is a unique great circle through p parallel to d and d in the torus additionally note that if t t c then fixing a point q d there is a point p c at distance 4 from q and in fact p must lie a distance 4 from d since otherwise there would be a point on d less than 4 from c violating the definition of t c on the other hand d is preserved by h c or h c while both subgroups act transitively on c so actually the distance from every point on c to d is 4 we conclude that whenever d is a great circle on t c c is also a great circle on t d 12 now suppose two clifford tori t c and t c have intersection d d where d is a great circle since d t c and d t c it follows from the last observation in the previous paragraph that c c t d moreover t c and t c must have the same chirality along d since otherwise their intersection would be larger as above so one torus can be obtained from the other by a rotation about d and therefore c and c and c and c must be parallel great circles on t d conversely if c and c are parallel great circles on t d then c can be obtained from c by a rotation about d so t c is obtained from t c by the same rotation and therefore t c and t c intersect along just d and d as described above thus two clifford tori intersect along a single pair of totally orthogonal great circles precisely when all four of their axis circles are parallel on the clifford torus equidistant from the intersection circles moreover if t c and t c orthogonally intersect along great circles d and d then each contains the axis circles of the other by definition of t c geodesics emanating from t orthogonally hit c c at distance 4 from t but geodesics intersecting t c orthogonally at d by assumption lie on t c on the other hand two clifford tori t c and t c have intersection d d d d precisely when c and c intersect orthogonally in which case c and c also intersect orthogonally and moreover c c c c t d t d indeed suppose first that t c t c d d d d since d lies on t c and t c c and c must be great circles on t d if c and c were parallel then t c and t c would intersect transversely along d and d only as in the preceding paragraph so they must intersect orthogonally by identical reasoning c and c must also intersect orthogonally and in fact all four axis circles lie on t d as well as on t d whose intersection is therefore precisely the union of these circles conversely if we assume c and c are two orthogonally intersecting great circles then we can construct the two clifford tori t and t containing c and c so that t t c c c c and their corresponding axes d d and d d it follows from the previous three sentences exchanging the roles of all c and d circles that d and d as well as d and d intersect orthogonally and their union is all of t c t c starting with orthogonally intersecting axis circles c and c as above by varying the angle between c and c while fixing their two intersection points one obtains pairs of tori intersecting along noncircular curves with four points of tangency the full space of intersections is two dimensional corresponding to the relative configuration of representative axis circles it can be parametrized by for instance the minimum and maximum distances from one of the axis circles to points on the other the case of tangency corresponds to the minimum vanishing while the case of constant angle intersection along a pair of orthogonal great circles corresponds to equality of the minimum and maximum we remark finally that any two clifford tori necessarily intersect this is a consequence of a general result of frankel 3 but for an elementary argument note that every single clifford torus divides s 3 into two connected components which are open tubular neighborhoods of each axis circle so if two clifford tori failed to intersect then one side of one of them would have to be properly contained in one side of the other but the two sides have equal volume precluding this situation the initial configurations although in the previous subsection we discussed clifford tori in some generality in this article we will only be concerned with finite maximally symmetric sub collections of a one parameter family of tori intersecting along a pair of totally orthogonal great circles and the clifford torus equidistant from the circles of intersection to fix the notation we start by taking s 3 to be the unit sphere in r 4 to which we give its standard orientation and which we will routinely identify with c 2 via the map x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 7 x 1 iy 1 x 2 iy 2 so that s 3 z 1 z 2 c 2 z 1 2 z 2 2 1 we write 3 5 c 1 eit 0 t r and c 2 0 eit t r c 1 13 for the unit circles in the coordinate planes oriented by increasing t as described in the previous subsection there is a unique clifford torus 3 6 t t c 1 t c 2 1 2 eix eiy x y r equidistant from c 1 and c 2 there is also a one parameter family of clifford tori containing c 1 so also c 2 and right handed along it so also along c 2 we distinguish the one 3 7 t eiz cos r sin r r z r that contains the great circle c 0 0 in the real plane im z 1 im z 2 0 in c 2 see 3 9 for the notation for each integer k 2 we intend to desingularize the configurations 3 8 wk k j 1 tj and w k wk t of k and k 1 clifford tori respectively where for each integer j 3 9 tj r j 1 k c 1 t r j 1 kc 2 t eiz cos r ei j 1 k sin r r z r so that t 1 t and tj k tj for all j z thus tj intersects t at constant angle j k along c 1 and c 2 while tj intersects t orthogonally along the two totally orthogonal geodesics on tj equidistant to c 1 and c 2 reflections through certain great circles will play an important role in the construction so we name some of these circles now first we define for each j 1 2 z 3 10 c j r j 1 k c 1 eiz 2 1 1 z r eiz 2 1 ei j 1 k z r t oriented by increasing z clearly for each j 1 2 z 3 11 c j c j k r c 1 c j r c 2 c j so in total there are 4 k such great circles pairwise disjoint c j j z consists of the 2 k great circles where t intersects the other clifford tori in w k 3 12 tj t c j c j k c j c j and c j and c j k are parallel on tj to c 1 and c 2 at a distance 4 and for j z c j 1 2 is the closer of two totally orthogonal great circles on t equidistant from c j and c j 1 we also mention that 3 13 tj t c j k 2 t c j 3 k 2 next for 1 2 r we label the great circle orthogonally intersecting c 1 at ei 1 0 and c 2 at 0 ei 2 by 3 14 c 1 2 ei 1 cos r ei 2 sin r r r thus c 1 2 and c 1 2 are disjoint unless 1 1 or 2 2 is an integral multiple of in which case they intersect only at two antipodal points on c 1 when 2 2 6 z only at two antipodal points on c 2 when 1 1 6 z or they coincide in particular c 1 j 1 2 j 2 c 1 2 for all j 1 j 2 z note also that 3 15 c 1 2 c 1 2 2 2 c 1 2 t 2 1 2 ei 1 ei 2 where the intersections at the four points are orthogonal and that tj is foliated by the disjoint great circles c 1 2 satisfying 2 1 j 1 k for 1 0 14 last we define for each r the great circle 3 16 c 1 2 eiz ei z z r eiz 2 1 ei 2 z z r t oriented by increasing z note that the clifford torus t is foliated by the disjoint great circles c with 0 2 3 17 c c t r c 1 r 2 c 0 2 t c c and the parameter measures the angle at the point 1 0 between t and r c 1 r 2 c 0 2 t which is a clifford torus through c 1 and c 2 but left handed along both note also that the circles c and c j intersect orthogonally at two points given by 3 18 c c j 1 2 ei 2 j 1 2 k ei 2 j 1 2 k the symmetries of the initial configurations and the main constructions for future reference we first note the identity 3 19 r cr c r c r r c c for any two great circles c and c and angles r as well as the particular products 3 20 r c 1 2 r c 1 2 r 2 2 2 c 1 r 2 1 1 c 2 r c j r c r k j c 1 r k j c 2 r c 1 r c 2 r 1 2 c 1 r 1 2 c 2 and r c 0 0 r c 1 r c 0 we now describe the symmetry groups of the above configurations lemma 3 21 i for k 2 3 22 gsym wk r k c 1 r c 0 0 r c 1 r c 1 r c 2 r in particular this group contains reflection through c 1 2 whenever 1 2 2 k z through c j for all j 1 2 z and through c for all r ii gsym w k gsym wk for k 2 iii gsym w 2 r 2 c 1 r c 0 0 r 2 c 1 r c 1 r c 2 r gsym w 2 proof first suppose k 2 it is clear that gsym wk contains the group on the right hand side of equation 3 22 a symmetry of wk will either exchange the intersection circles c 1 and c 2 or will preserve each as a set in particular it will preserve t t c 1 t c 2 so gsym wk gsym w k moreover each element of o 4 is completely determined by its action on c 1 and c 2 if a symmetry of wk preserves c 1 then it also preserves c 2 and it must act by rotation or reflection in each circle an orthogonal transformation reversing the orientation of one circle but preserving the orientation of the other cannot be a symmetry of wk since c 1 and c 2 are right handed in all of the tori of the configuration and a reflection in just one of them reverses chirality a symmetry acting by a reflection in one circle must therefore act by reflection in both circles in other words such a symmetry must be a reflection through a geodesic of s 3 orthogonally intersecting c 1 and c 2 reflection through a geodesic orthogonal to both c 1 and c 2 will preserve the configuration precisely when the geodesic lies inwk r 2 k c 1 wk meaning on one of the tori or halfway between two 15 tori reflections through these geodesics clearly belong to the group on the right hand side of 3 22 any rotation in each circle preserving wk can be composed with a symmetry of the form r c 1 r c 2 to produce a symmetry fixing c 1 pointwise and rotating c 2 clearly any such symmetry likewise belongs to the group on the right hand side of 3 22 so we have now accounted for all symmetries of wk preserving c 1 and c 2 separately any transformation exchanging the two circles is the product of a transformation preserving them with the reflection through a geodesic equidistant from c 1 and c 2 these are the great circles on the torus t and reflection through such a circle is a symmetry of the configuration precisely when the geodesic either orthogonally intersects all the other tori or else lies on either one of the other tori or halfway between a consecutive pair of these all these reflections belong to the right hand side of 3 22 too so we have finished checking i if k 2 then any element of w k must permute the intersection circles c 1 and c 2 and cannot exchange them with any intersection circles on t and therefore must preservewk confirming ii in the case k 2 however the three tori t 1 t 2 and t are all equivalent under the symmetries as are all six intersection circles c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 in particular r 2 c 1 belongs to gsym w 2 and exchanges t 1 and t any symmetry of w 2 exchanging t with either of the other clifford tori can be composed with r 2 c 1 and possibly an element of gsym w 2 to obtain an element of gsym w 2 completing the proof of iii the choices we are about to make to desingularize the initial configurations will break many of the symmetries just described including in particular the continuous symmetries nevertheless to simplify the construction we will insist on retaining reflections through a collection of great circles which will be included in their entirety on the surfaces we construct and which serve as a sort of scaffolding for the construction more precisely for any integers k 2 and m 1 we introduce the scaffoldings 3 23 ck m j z c j k m j km k wk and c k m ck 2 m j z c j km w k and corresponding groups 3 24 gk m grefl ck m o 4 and g k m grefl c k m o 4 motivation for the choice of scaffolds and corresponding symmetries can be found in the next section lemma 3 25 for any integers k 2 and m 1 i ck m is the union of k 2 m great circles of which the km circles c j km j km 1 k with 1 j km are parallel on t ii c k m is the union of 2 k 2 m 2 km great circles of which the 2 km circles c j 2 km j 2 km 1 k

tori through c 1 and c 2 cylinders of constant r to constant mean curvature tori degenerating to c 1 or c 2 when r is respectively an even or odd multiple of 2 with axis circles c 1 and c 2 horizontal

left handed along c 1 and containing the circle r c 1 c 0 0 is the image under of the helicoid 2 z and c and c are the images of the two helices where this helicoid intersects the cylinder r 4 in particular 4 cos 4 sin 1 2 0 2 c 0 though great spheres do not play an important role in the construction to aid understanding of the geometry of we also mention that the great sphere with equator c 1 and poles 0 ei is the image of the helicoid z moreover the open solid torus x 2 y 2 4 t 2 z axis is mapped diffeomorphically by onto the open solid torus of points within 4 of c 1 the c 1 side of t and is an approximate isometry for small r more precisely writing g s for the round metric on s 3 and g e for the euclidean metric on r 3 we have 4 2 g s dr 2 sin 2 r d 2 2 sin 2 r d dz dz 2 g e sin 2 r r 2 d 2 2 sin 2 r d dz we also note that intertwines some symmetries of interest for every c r 4 3 r cz axis r c c 1 r x axis r c 0 0 and t cz axis r c c 1 rcc 2 towers with straightened wings since maps the asymptotic planes of the karcher scherk towers to clifford tori we can smoothly glue the towers imported by to the tori of our config urations by straightening the wings to exact half planes before applying we accomplish this transition using the cut off functions defined in 1 7 specifically given integers k 2 and m 1 we set 4 4 a am m 4 10 17 and we define the map 4 5 x k m sk r 3 by modifying the inclusion map sk sk r 3 recall 2 6 as follows we will specify x k m on the wedge e r cos r sin z r 0 2 k z r and complete its global definition by requiring it to commute with all elements of gsym sk we assume that m is large enough so that a rk the new map x k m agrees with sk on sk e x a we recall from 2 6 that the complement sk e x a is the graph x wk x z z x a z r of the function wk over the half plane a 0 r and further that this graph misses the boundary of the wedge we decree that 4 6 x k m x wk x z z 7 x a 1 a x wk x z z for each point x wk x z z in this region imposing the symmetries as just described completes the definition of x k m sk r 3 and we also define its truncated image 4 7 s k m s x k m sk x 2 y 2 for any s 0 controlling the truncation data symmetries and scaffolding each initial surface m desingularizing wk is specified by a quintuple of data k m n 1 n 2 and each initial surface n desingularizing w k is specified by a septuple k m n n 1 n 1 1 1 where k 2 and m n n 1 n 2 n 1 n 1 1 are integers and 1 1 0 1 the role of k in the definition of the initial configurations is already clear it is the number of clifford tori intersecting along c 1 and c 2 along with m it determines the scaffolding ck m or c k m according to 3 23 we have also used m in 4 4 to set the distance from a tower s axis at which its wings are straightened together with k and m the remaining positive integers either n n 1 and n 2 or n 1 and n 1 specify the number of fundamental periods or equivalently the scale of the towers along each circle of intersection finally the relative alignment of towers along the various circles is prescribed by either or 1 and 1 we will now explain the roles of the data in slightly more detail and simultaneously offer some brief motivation for the definitions of the scaffoldings 3 23 above and the initial surfaces 4 13 below the initial surfaces are to be constructed from the initial configurations they are intended to desingularize by replacing a tubular neighborhood of each intersection circle c with a truncated karcher scherk tower with straightened wings scaled in r 3 by some factor m c 0 mapped into s 3 by and then positioned as desired along c by a rotation r c o 4 4 8 c r c m 1 c s k c m mcsc where k c is the number either k or 2 of clifford tori intersecting along c in the corresponding initial configuration and where s c 0 is picked somewhat arbitrarily to ensure each tower is truncated well away from towers on neighboring circles since sk has fundamental period 2 and is periodic in z with period 2 each circle of inter section having length 2 obviously m c must be an integer in order for the initial surface to be embedded further constraints on each m c are placed by the following symmetry requirements which we make of the initial surface to simplify the analysis of the linearized operator on the towers in section 6 assumption 4 9 let be an initial surface we require c 0 0 and r c 0 0 gsym and for each intersection circle c in the corresponding initial configuration we require r 2 k c c gsym 18 the assumption ensures triviality of the kernel of each tower s jacobi operator restricted to the space of deformations respecting gsym we do not claim that these conditions are necessary but they are natural and sufficient it is not hard to check using 2 6 and 3 20 for instance that imposing 4 9 is equivalent to demanding ck m and grefl ck m gsym when desingularizes wk or c k m and grefl c k m gsym when desingularizes w k for some integer m 1 in particular each tower c must itself contain the appropriate scaffolding forcing m c to divide km when ck m or 2 km when c k m since gk m includes no symmetries exchanging c 1 and c 2 the quotients m c 1 km and m c 2 km are independent and are given by n 1 and n 2 on the other hand modulo g k m c 1 and c 2 are equivalent to one another but to no other intersection circles while for every j z the circles c j and c j 2 are equivalent but c j and c j 1 are inequivalent thus only mc 1 2 km m c 1 2 km and m c 2 2 km can be independently prescribed as n n 1 and n 1 respectively alignment the data so far described completely determine the periods and sizes of the towers replacing the circles of intersection but this information and the particular scaffolding do not quite fix the initial surface even up to congruence we call two initial surfaces 1 and 2 congruent in s 3 if there exists r o 4 such that 2 r 1 specifically there is some not entirely inconsequential freedom in the choice of r c in 4 8 it may be replaced by r k c c r c equivalently we could replace the tower sk defining s k c m by its dual tower mentioned in remark 2 26 and having the same scaffolding and symmetry group as sk but occupying a k instead of ak accordingly we allow the values of to make a choice of one model tower or the other along c 2 for initial surfaces desingularizing wk and we use 1 and 1 for identical purposes along the towers c j with j odd and even respectively for initial surfaces desingularizing w k thus these data control the alignment of the towers it is not necessary to allow for the two possibilities on every inequivalent intersection circle since up to congruence it is only the relative alignment that matters in fact even allowing realignment on just the circles mentioned we still sometimes produce congruent initial surfaces with different values of or 1 and 1 depending on the parities of the other data for example assuming n 1 and n 2 relatively prime since we may absorb a common divisor into m the surfaces m k m n 1 n 2 0 and m k m n 1 n 2 1 formally defined in 4 13 below desingularizing wk are congruent precisely when either m or exactly one ni is odd indeed if mn 1 is odd then 4 10 r k c 2 m k m n 1 n 2 0 r kmn 1 c 1 r kmn 1 c 2 mn 1 r k c 1 m k m n 1 n 2 0 m k m n 1 n 2 1 if n 1 is even but n 2 odd then 4 11 r kmn 2 c 1 r kmn 2 c 2 n 2 m k m n 1 n 2 0 r kmn 1 c 1 r kmn 1 c 2 n 1 m k m n 1 n 2 0 m k m n 1 n 2 1 and if n 1 is odd but m and n 2 even then 4 12 r k c 2 r kmn 2 c 1 r kmn 2 c 2 n 2 m k m n 1 n 2 0 r kmn 1 c 1 r kmn 1 c 2 m 1 n 1 r k c 1 m k m n 1 n 2 0 m k m n 1 n 2 1 to see that m k m n 1 n 2 0 and m k m n 1 n 2 1 are not congruent when m is even and both n 1 and n 2 are odd recall that each initial surface will be defined to include the scaffold circles whose union is ck m which orthogonally intersect c 1 and c 2 at the 2 kmth roots of unity on each choosing the global normal which at 1 0 points in the positive direction of c 1 then determines the direction of that normal at all 2 kmth roots of unity on c 1 and c 2 we call the unit normal 19 at such a point positive if it points in the positive direction of the circle on which it lies and we call it negative otherwise then given two such points joined by an arc of a great circle in ck m we say that the two normals there are aligned if they are either both positive or both negative and otherwise say that they are antialigned the parities assumed for the data imply that for a given initial surface with that data this alignment does not depend on the pair of chosen points and therefore defines a property of the initial surface which is invariant under congruences that preserve ck m but it is reversed by altering the value of this shows that m k m n 1 n 2 0 is not congruent to m k m n 1 n 2 1 similar considerations apply to surfaces desingularizing w k but to avoid complicating the defi nition of the initial surfaces we do not make a systematic effort to eliminate completely duplication of congruence classes within the collection of initial surfaces definition and basic properties with the foregoing in mind we define the initial surfaces as follows recalling 4 4 and 4 7 definition 4 13 given integers k 2 m 1 and relatively prime n 1 n 2 0 as well as 0 1 set 4 14 m k m n 1 n 2 2 j 1 r k c 2 j 1 r j 1 c 1 1 kmnj s k m kmnj 4 given instead integers k 2 m 1 and relatively prime n n 1 n 1 0 as well as 1 1 0 1 set 4 15 n k m n n 1 n 1 1 1 1 j 0 r j c 1 1 2 kmn s k m 2 kmn 4 4 k 2 k 1 j 0 r j k c 1 r kmn 1 j c 1 r kmn 1 j c 2 1 j r c 4 0 0 r 4 c 2 2 1 2 kmn 1 j s 2 m 2 kmn 1 j 4 k we will abbreviate the initial surfaces m k m n 1 n 2 and n k m n n 1 n 1 1 1 by m and n respectively or sometimes indiscriminately by when context permits remark 4 16 the divisibility assumptions are made to avoid listing a single initial surface multi ple times under different labels but as already acknowledged some redundancy persists in the list in that certain items are congruent to others in such cases the resulting minimal surfaces ultimately produced will also be congruent we next collect some basic properties of the initial surfaces proposition 4 17 for every choice of data assuming a max rk r 2 the initial surfaces m k m n 1 n 2 and n k m n n 1 n 1 1 1 are closed smooth surfaces embedded in s 3 moreover i m has genus k k 1 m n 1 n 2 1 ii n has genus 2 k 2 m n 1 n 1 4 kmn k 1 1 iii ck m m and gk m gsym m and iv c k m n and g k m gsym n proof the closedness smoothness and embeddedness of the initial surfaces are clear from the definition and preceding discussion for i the components of wk c 1 c 2 may be grouped into pairs of consecutive in the sense of rotations about either circle components and the two members of each pair may then be glued to each other along c 1 and c 2 to form k new topological 20 tori we get the connected sum of these tori a surface of genus k at the cost of one fundamental period of a tower along c 1 or c 2 each additional fundamental period of the towers along c 1 and c 2 then contributes k 1 handles to the resulting surface the genus of n is similarly calculated each portion of t between two consecutive circles of intersection is glued to two portions of tori both from alternately the c 1 or the c 2 side orthogonally intersecting it where these latter two are themselves glued along the circle where they intersect so either c 1 or c 2 in this way we obtain 2 k topological tori whose connected sum we take at the cost of one fundamental period for all but one tower on t each additional period of each of these towers contributes one handle to the resulting surface while each period of each of the remaining two towers contributes k 1 handles the great circles in the scaffoldings pass uninterrupted through the desingularized circles of intersection by virtue of the positioning and scaling in 4 13 and the fact that maps the horizontal lines on the euclidean towers to great circles that reflections through these geodesics belong to the stabilizers of the initial surfaces follows from the intertwining 4 3 by of symmetries of sk 2 6 with symmetries of the configurations 3 21 to be desingularized definition 4 18 since each initial surface is embedded in s 3 it is also orientable and therefore possesses a unique global unit normal henceforth denoted which points in the positive direction meaning toward i 0 along c 1 at 1 0 c 2 s 3 we will write g for the metric on each initial surface induced by its defining embedding in s 3 g s a for its directed scalar valued second fundamental form and h for its directed scalar valued mean curvature remarks on additional symmetries and the surfaces of choe and soret before proceed ing with the construction we pause to elaborate briefly on the symmetry groups that is the full stabilizers in o 4 of the initial surfaces in one particular class of highly symmetric cases the groups presented in the above proposition are the minimum symmetry groups enforced throughout the construction but in general each such group will be properly contained in the symmetry group of a given initial surface consistent with that group as well as of the corresponding final minimal surface to illustrate consider the initial surfaces m k m 1 1 of type m with n 1 n 2 1 whatever the values of k m and the full symmetry group here will always contain reflection through not just c j km j m km for all j z already represented in gk m but also c j 2 km j m 2 km for j odd when m is odd m k m 1 1 0 and m k m 1 1 1 are equivalent under ambient isometries as discussed in the alignment subsection immediately preceding 4 13 so we may assume 0 the full symmetry group then admits r c 1 excluded from gk m and therefore also r c j for every odd j because see 3 20 for every integer j the product r c j 2 r c j r 2 k c 1 r 2 k c 2 gsym m when 1 one has instead reflection through c j for each even j because r c 2 r k c 1 r k c 2 r 2 k c 2 r c 1 and by assumption k is an odd multiple of kmn in this case there are no other circles of reflection on t that are parallel to c 1 and c 2 through tori right handed along them indeed the only such circles through which reflection preserves wk are the cj for j 12 z that even values of j are inadmissible follows from the last parenthetical remark that half integer values are inadmissible follows also from 3 20 since r c 3 2 r c 1 r 2 k c 1 r 2 k c 2 r k c 2 takes for example 1 0 m to e i 2 k 0 6 m since 2 k is a nonintegral multiple of the half period km when m is odd there are however also circles of reflection orthogonal to the c j since c 0 0 and c 1 are circles of reflection of m k m 1 1 0 for m odd still by 3 20 c 0 is also a circle reflection so by 3 20 again c 2 j km is too for every j z 21 when m is even m k m 1 1 0 and m k m 1 1 1 are inequivalent the first 0 surface has reflectional symmetry through c j for every integer j since r c j 1 r c j r k c 1 r k c 2 r 2 k c 2 m is even and n 1 again one also has c 2 j km as a circle of reflection for every j z because r c 3 2 r c 1 r 2 k c 1 r 2 k c 2 r k c 2 preserves the initial surface if and only if 2 k is an odd number of half periods one has as well reflectional symmetry through c j for every half integer j precisely when m is not divisible by 4 the second 1 surface has symmetry group including r c j r km c 1 r km c 2 and excluding r c j for every integer j thus c 0 is not a circle of reflection but instead c j km is for every j 2 z 1 when m is divisible by 4 the symmetry group also includes reflection through c j for every half integer j but for no integer j but when m is not divisible by 4 there are no circles of reflection on t parallel to c 1 and c 2 through tori right handed along them note that this description of the initial surfaces m k m 1 1 with m even is consistent with the properties of the surfaces constructed by choe and soret in 2 specifically the genus and symmetries of the 0 and 1 surfaces match those of respectively the odd and even surfaces in 2 remark 4 19 note that to prove that the surfaces we construct in 7 1 of type m with m even and n 1 n 2 1 are the same surfaces found in 2 it is enough to prove the uniqueness of the solutions to the plateau problems in 2 although this seems very likely to be true we do not have a proof at the moment note also that in 18 lawson claims uniqueness for the solution to his plateau problem 5 the extended standard regions every initial surface is covered by certain open sets which we call extended standard regions of two types regions of the first type are indexed by the circles of intersection given a particular initial surface for any circle c of intersection in the corresponding initial configuration we define m c suppressing dependence on the given initial surface to be the number of fundamental periods of the tower in wrapped around c so that recall 4 13 m c is the product of m with the appropriate factor involving k or 2 as well as n n 1 or n 2 depending on and c 5 1 m c kmnj if m k m n 1 n 2 and c cj 2 kmn if n k m n n 1 n 1 1 1 and c c 1 or c c 2 2 kmn 1 j if n k m n n 1 n 1 1 1 and c c j we similarly define 5 2 k c k if c c 1 or c c 2 2 otherwise then recalling 4 4 we let 5 3 s c p dg s p c a m c where dg s p c denotes the distance in s 3 between p and c this region is naturally identified with a truncated karcher scherk tower sk c a sk c x 2 y 2 a via the map c m r 3 s 3 defined by 5 4 c m x y z r c x y z m c 5 5 22 where r c is an element of so 4 chosen so that s c c m sk c a sometimes we may suppress the dependence on m writing simply c in turn we define x c sk c a s c by 5 6 x c c sk c sk c a c x k c m sk c a a new constant b max r 2 rk to be determined later dictates the extent of the second type of region it will be chosen independently of m but large enough so that each such region closely approximates a clifford torus regions of the second type in an initial surface are indexed by the connected components of the complement of the circles of intersection in the initial configuration that desingularizes given such a component t with boundary t c d we may assume if necessary by redefining c by precomposition with a symmetry of sk c and d by precomposition with a symmetry of sk d that t has inward unit conormals m c d c x and mdd d x along c and d then recalling 2 6 and for any integer j 2 setting 5 7 hj x a 1 a wj x z z r 3 x b a 1 z r we define 5 8 s t c hk c d hk d t dg s c b m c dg s d b m d this region is naturally identified with 5 9 tb p t dg s p c b m c and dg s p d b m d via the map t t m s t tb defined by 5 10 t m p c xz 1 c p if p c hk c d xz 1 d p if p d hk d p otherwise 5 11 where xz r 3 r 3 is euclidean orthogonal projection onto the xz plane it is immediate that t m is well defined and smooth given an initial surface we write c for the collection of circles of intersection in the corresponding initial configuration and t for the collection of components of the complement of c c c in the initial configuration then c c s c t t s t the members of s c c c x are pairwise disjoint the members of s t t t are pairwise disjoint and s c s t unless c t using the diffeomorphisms just defined the next two propositions compare the extended standard regions as embeddings in s 3 m 2 g s to standard karcher scherk towers and planes in euclidean space proposition 5 12 let be an initial surface and t t a toral component write g t for the flat metric on t and for each point p tb let dg s tb p denote the distance from p to the boundary circles of tb then for every nonnegative integer there exists a constant c independent of m such that i m 2 g t gt c t s t 2 m 2 t gt e m t dgs tb c ii m 2 a 2 2 c s t m 2 t gt e m t dgs tb c

establish the estimates within u p s 3 ds 3 p c a 1 m c using 4 2 we find 5 13 r c g s dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 sin 2 r r 2 r 4 y 2 dx 2 x 2 dy 2 2 xy dx dy 2 sin 2 r r 2 x dy dz y dx dz whose components and whose inverse s components have coordinate derivatives of all orders bounded on 1 r c 1 u x 2 y 2 4 r 3 moreover t identifies s t as a graph 24 over t so that 5 14 s t u r c x f x z z r c x 0 z 1 t s

all components of g s and its inverse with respect to the x y z coordinate system as established in 5 13 assuming the normal on s t has positive inner product with y we calculate also 5 17 aij x z g s

that the squared norm of the second fundamental form of t is simply 2 and that t is minimal we obtain ii and iii using again the estimates 5 15 and the boundedness exhibited by 5 13 proposition 5 18 let be an initial surface and c c an intersection circle write a c for the second fundamental form of the inclusion sk c sk c r 3 relative to the rescaled euclidean metric m 2 m 2 c g e and the unit normal whose pushforward by c m has positive g s inner product with and set g c m 2 m 2 c sk c g e then for each nonnegative integer there exists a constant c independent of m such that i m 2 g x 1 c g c c t s c 2 m 2 g c m 1 2 ii m 2 a 2 x 1 c a c 2 c s c m 2 g c m 1 2 and iii m 2 h c m 2 g c m 3 2 proof from 5 13 5 19 cm 2 cgs ge c x 2 y 2 a r 3 g e x 2 y 2 1 m c c 25 since the second fundamental form of sk is bounded as is each of its covariant derivatives we obtain 5 20 m 2 g x 1 c g c c s c m 2 g m 1 dg s c c m 2 a 2 x 1 c a c 2 c s c m 2 g m 1 dgs c c and m 1 h c s c m 2 g m 1 dg s c c establishing the estimates of the proposition on the subset of s c within the tubular neighborhood of center c and g s radius m 1 2 by assuming m b we ensure that the complement of this subset falls under the regime of the preceding proposition which in conjunction with the asymptotic geometry of sk c itself completes the proof under the further assumption that e m m 6 the linearized equation given an initial surface embedded in s 3 by x s 3 along with a function u c 2 with sufficiently small c 0 norm and recalling 4 18 the choice ts 3 of global unit normal we define the immersion 6 1 xu s 3 p 7 exp x p u p p where exp ts 3 s 3 is the exponential map on s 3 g s write u for the global unit normal on xu which has nonnegative inner product with the velocity field for the geodesics generated by and write h u for the scalar mean curvature of xu relative to u write g for recalling 3 24 gk m when is type m and for g k m when is type n the main theorem will be proven by selecting a solution u c g the space of smooth g odd functions on recall 1 6 to h u 0 small enough that xu is an embedding to that end we next study the linearization l at 0 of h given by 6 2 lu d dt t 0 h tu a 2 2 u where the constant term 2 arises as the ricci curvature of g s contracted twice with actually to secure bounds uniform in m and to facilitate the comparison of this operator on the extended standard regions to certain limit operators we focus on 6 3 m 2 l c 2 g m 2 g c 0 g m 2 g in view of the estimates of the second fundamental form contained in 5 12 and 5 18 this operator is bounded for any 0 1 the present section is devoted to obtaining a bounded inverse by first analyzing the operator semilocally meaning when restricted to spaces of functions defined on each of the various extended standard regions and by afterward applying an iteration scheme to piece together a global solution approximate solutions on towers we first solve the jacobi equation for the inclusion map sk sk r 3 of the exact karcher scherk towers of standard size given data with sufficiently small support to avoid the introduction of substitute kernel needed in more complicated gluing constructions we impose the symmetries g induces on the limit tower specifically set g sk g e write a for the second fundamental form of sk sk r 3 and for each positive integer n let 6 4 g g k n grefl nck r x axis r 2 k z axis t 2 n z axis gsym sk 26 then the jacobi operator 6 5 l g a 2 defines a bounded linear map l c 2 g sk g c 0 g sk g for any 0 1 and integers k 2 and n 1 given b 0 we recall that sk b sk x 2 y 2 b and we set 6 6 c 0 c g sk b g u c 0 g sk g having support compactly contained in sk b proposition 6 7 fix 0 1 b 0 and integers k 2 and n 1 then there exists a linear map 6 8 r sk n c 0 c g sk b g c 2 g sk g and there exists a constant c depending on just b k and n such that for any f in the domain of r sk n we have l r sk nf f and 6 9 r sk nf c 2 sk g c f c 0 sk g proof the proof will be completed by i introducing a conformal metric e 2 g ii establishing that the schro dinger operator l e 2 l acting between sobolev spaces defined with respect to this metric has discrete spectrum omitting 0 iii extracting a c 0 bound for solutions and finally iv applying schauder estimates for k 2 the tower sk has umbilic points where the gauss map takes vertical values so the pullback h 1 2 a 2 g of the round spherical metric gs by the gauss map as applied in 7 and other constructions degenerates there instead we will pull back the spherical metric by a different map recall that above we studied the enneper weierstrass representation 2 8 on the unit disc which after a similarity transformation parametrized a half period of sk in fact we observe that 2 8 extends to a diffeomorphism 6 10 c 1 2 k 1 k r 2 k z axissk t 2 k z axis from the extended complex plane c punctured at the 2 k roots of 1 to the corresponding tower modulo vertical translation by 2 k moreover the inverse extends to a covering map 6 11 1 1 k r 2 k z axis sk c 1 2 k of the punctured extended plane by the full tower by composing with the appropriate rotation scaling and the inverse of stereographic projection s 2 c we obtain a smooth covering 6 12 1 1 1 k r 2 kz axis sk s 2 2 k j 1 j the gauss map sk s 2 is then just p r 2 k z axis 1 p k 1 referring further to the enneper weierstrass data 2 1 we deduce see for example 16 or any standard reference for the classical theory of minimal surfaces 6 13 g z z 2 k 2 1 z 2 k 1 2 dz 2 so since 6 14 1 g s z 4 z 2 1 2 dz 2 27 we find 6 15 g s 4 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 1 2 2 k 2 1 2 g e 2 g so that the conformal factor e 2 in front of g in 6 15 and its reciprocal e 2 are bounded on the inverse image under of every compact subset of s 2 2 k j 1 j also from 2 1 we find 6 16 1 k r 2 kz axis a 2 z 8 k 1 k 2 z 2 k 4 z 2 k 1 2 z 2 k 2 1 4 whence 6 17 e 2 a 2 2 k 1 2 2 k 4 2 1 2 k 2 1 2 so that the potential term of l e 2 l is a smooth function with absolute value bounded on all sk note that pullback 1 1 e 2 of the conformal factor in 6 15 is even under reflection through every line through opposite 2 kth roots of 1 therefore recall the discussion of the symmetries in the proof of 2 6 e 2 itself is in particular g even and so l like l takes g odd functions to g odd functions for each nonnegative integer write h g sk for the sobolev space consisting of all g odd in the distributional sense measurable functions whose weak covariant derivatives up to order with respect to have squared norms with finite integrals on the quotient sk g define the h g sk norm of such a function to be the square root of the sum from order 0 to order of these integrals although sk is not compact nor is the quotient sk g sk is nevertheless a union of closed round hemispheres punctured on their equators 6 18 sk j z j where the overline indicates topological closure in sk and 6 19 j sk 2 j 1 2 z 2 j 1 2 is the open region on sk between two consecutive horizontal planes of symmetry each j is isometric to an open round hemisphere of radius 1 thus from a sequence bounded in h 1 g sk by applying the rellich kondrashov lemma succes sively to 2 n contiguous such hemispheres and bearing in mind the g equivariance we can extract a subsequence converging in l 2 g sk h 0 g sk using also the boundedness of e 2 a 2 and a standard application of the riesz representation theorem for hilbert spaces we conclude that l has discrete spectrum in proposition 6 23 below we show moreover that l has trivial kernel now given f c 0 c g sk b we have e 2 f h 0 g sk with e 2 f l 2 sk c b f c 0 sk so by proposition 6 23 there exists u h 1 g sk weakly solving l u f and satisfying the estimate u h 1 sk c b f c 0 sk by standard elliptic regularity theory and the bounded geometry of sk g in fact u c 2 loc sk with 6 20 u c 2 b 1 p g c u c 0 b 2 p f c 0 sk g 28 for each p sk where br p is the open ball with center p and g radius r next from the bochner formula together with the divergence theorem the recognition that the compactly supported smooth functions are dense in h 1 g sk and the equality u e 2 f e 2 a 2 u one secures the further estimate 6 21 u h 2 sk c f c 0 sk now given v c sk and p sk there is a sector s sk of a spherical cap relative to with center p vertex angle 4 and radius 1 4 entirely contained in sk so missing the roots of unity at the equator then writing s for the geodesic through p parametrized by arc length s from p and with initial angle measured from one edge of s to the other we have v p 1 4 0 d ds 1 4 1 8 s v s ds 1 4 0 s d 2 ds 2 1 4 1 8 s v s ds using the fundamental theorem of calculus and integrating by parts integrating in from 0 to 4 and applying the cauchy schwarz inequality yields the simple morrey sobolev inequality 6 22 u c 0 sk c u h 2 sk this estimate in conjunction with 6 21 and 6 20 completes the proof proposition 6 23 the operator l acting on h 1 g sk as defined in the proof of proposition 6 7 has trivial kernel proof to show that l has trivial h 1 g sk kernel we will first count its nullity on the somewhat larger domain h 1 h sk where 6 24 h h k n r 2 k z axis t 2 n z axis g gsym sk is the subgroup of g having the same generators save the reflections through lines which are excluded this count is performed by adapting the variational proofs given by montiel and ros for lemma 12 and lemma 13 in 21 there they calculate the multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the laplacian on the round sphere as eigenvalues of the laplacian on certain coverings of the sphere here we are interested in the multiplicity of 0 only for the more complicated operator l recalling 6 19 we see that h 2 n j 1 j sk write h 1 h j for the space of restrictions to j of elements of h 1 h sk and write h 1 0 h j for the closure in h 1 h sk of the space of smooth functions compactly supported in j and invariant under the rotational symmetries of h that preserve j we define the bilinear form bl j on h 1 h j h 1 h j 6 25 b l j u v du dv l 2 e 2 a 2 u v l 2 then mimicking 21 we define the subspace v of h 1 h sk by 6 26 v u h 1 0 h 1 0 v h 1 0 h 1 bl 1 u v u v l 2 2 n j 2 u h 1 0 h j 0 v h 1 0 h j bl j u v u v l 2 29 and the vector space w by 6 27 w u h 1 h 1 0 v h 1 h 1 bl 1 u v u v l 2 2 n j 2 u h 1 h j 0 v h 1 h j bl j u v u v l 2 where in the first equation we take the direct sum within h 1 h sk while in the second we use the abstract direct sum and in both equations angled brackets indicate the linear span in h 1 h sk using the variational characterization of eigenvalues and the unique continuation principle we find as in 21 that i orthogonal projection in h 1 h sk onto the subspace spanned by the l eigenfunctions with strictly negative eigenvalues has injective restriction to v and ii orthogo nal projection in 2 n j 1 h 1 h j onto w has injective restriction after precomposition with the obvious inclusion to the subspace of h 1 h sk spanned by l eigenfunctions with nonpositive eigenvalues according to lemma 6 28 below l onh 1 0 h j with dirichlet condition has one dimensional kernel and no strictly negative eigenvalues so from i in the preceding paragraph we deduce that l on h 1 h sk has at least 2 n 1 strictly negative eigenvalues counted with multiplicity on the other hand lemma 6 28 also states that l on h 1 h j with neumann condition has trivial kernel and precisely one simple negative eigenvalue so from ii in the preceding paragraph we deduce that l on h 1 h sk has no more than 2 n nonnegative eigenvalues counted with multi plicity thus l has nullity at most one on h 1 h sk since the vertical component of the gauss map is a jacobi field for sk and is h but not g equivariant we see that the h 1 g sk kernel of l is indeed trivial lemma 6 28 for each j z with notation as in 6 19 and the proof of proposition 6 23 i l on h 1 0 h j with dirichlet boundary condition has 1 dimensional kernel and no strictly negative eignevalues and ii l on h 1 h j with neumann boundary condition has trivial kernel and exactly one simple negative eigenvalue proof the hemisphere j with its pole deleted is conformal via stereographic projection from the antipodal pole and a logarithm to the standard half cylinder with flat metric concretely using polar coordinates on the unit disc pulled back by the same stereographic projection to j we have 6 29 4 r 2 1 r 2 2 r 2 dr 2 d 2 we find recall 6 17 that for the corresponding operator 6 30 l cyl 4 r 2 1 r 2 2 l r r 2 8 k 1 2 r 2 k 2 r 2 k 2 1 2 2 we have 6 31 l cyl a a k 1 2 2 and cyl r r 2 2 a a k 1 2 2 where a r r k 1 r 2 k 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 30 evidently l cyla a cyl so whenever w is an eigenfunction of the flat laplacian cyl a w is an eigenfunction when nonzero of l cyl with the same eigenvalue moreover a r and a r are linearly independent for every real 0 except k 1 and obviously 0 corresponding to the latter exception we have for a a k 1 2 the linearly independent eigenfunctions a 1 and a ln r with eigenvalue 0 as for the former exception noting that we have already accounted for the eigenfunction a r k 1 a r 1 k of a a k 1 2 with eigenvalue k 1 2 and that cyla a l cyl we find that nonzero w solving a w r k 1 r 1 k is another independent such eigenfunction thus we deduce that an eigenfunction for l cyl of the form v r ei with eigenvalue 2 2 has radial factor v r a linear combination of u r and u r given by 6 32 u r r r k 1 r 2 k 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 r k 1 r 2 k 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 r or a linear combination of u 0 r and 6 33 u 0 r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 ln r in case 0 or a linear combination of uk 1 r u 1 k r and 6 34 u k 1 r r k 1 r 2 k 2 r 2 2 k 4 k 1 ln r r 2 k 2 1 in case k 1 separating variables we need only consider eigenfunctions of the above form and because of the rotational symmetries imposed must take values in kz now suppose l v r ei 0 on j then l cylv r e i 0 as well on j punctured at its pole 0 so and v r c 1 u r c 2 u r for some constants c 1 and c 2 unless 0 in which case v r c 1 u 0 r c 2 u 0 r the other exceptional case of k 1 is excluded by the symmetries if we impose dirichlet conditions we find c 1 c 2 when 0 but then v is singular at r 0 unless c 1 c 2 0 which must therefore hold since v r e i is an eigenfunction on all j on the other hand u 0 1 0 while u 0 1 1 so c 2 0 when 0 thus dirichlet l has kernel spanned by u 0 r r 2 k 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 confirming the nullity asserted in i if we instead impose neumann conditions since ru 1 2 k 1 2 again k 1 is excluded by the symmetries we find c 1 c 2 when 0 so again we need c 1 c 2 0 to avoid a singularity at r 0 on the other hand ru 0 1 0 while ru 0 1 k 1 2 so in this case c 1 0 but u 0 is also singular at r 0 thus neumann l indeed has trivial kernel as claimed in ii for 6 0 one cannot expect agreement of solutions to l u u and to l cylu u but the variational characterization of eigenvalues reveals that the number counting multiplicity of strictly negative dirichlet or neumann eigenvalues will agree for the two operators at least on compact subsets of j 0 where the conformal factor is bounded with bounded inverse furthermore again using the variational characterization of eigenvalues one sees that for 0 sufficiently small the number counted with multiplicity of strictly negative eigenvalues for l on j with dirichlet condition on the equator is the same as the number of strictly negative eigenvalues of l on j less a spherical cap b 0 with radius and center the pole 0 imposing dirichlet conditions on both the equator and boundary of the cap to show the former number is at least the latter extend test functions vanishing on b 0 to test functions vanishing on b 0 for the reverse inequality use a logarithmic cut off identically 0 on b 0 and identically 1 on b 0 likewise assuming small enough the number of strictly negative eigenvalues of l on j with neumann condition 31 on the equator is the same as the number of strictly negative eigenvalues of l on j b 0 with neumann condition on the equator and dirichlet condition on b 0 now suppose v r e i is an eigenfunction of l on j b 0 with strictly negative eigenvalue imposing either of the above boundary conditions then so in particular 6 0 if k 1 then v c 1 uk 1 c 2 u k 1 if we impose the dirichlet condition on the equatorial circle r 1 then since uk 1 1 k 1 and u k 1 1 0 we must have c 1 0 but limr 0 u k 1 r so the dirichlet condition on r means c 2 0 as well thus there are no such dirichlet eigenfunctions if instead we impose the neumann condition on r 1 then since ruk 1 1 0 and ru k 1 1 4 k 1 we need c 2 0 but uk 1 r vanishes only at r 0 so the dirichlet condition on r means c 1 0 too thus there are no such neumann eigenfunctions either now assume 6 k 1 then v c 1 u c 2 u as when studying the kernel above imposition of the dirichlet condition r 1 forces c 1 c 2 but a quick calculation shows that imposition of the dirichlet condition on r then requires tanh ln k 1 tanh k 1 ln since for every real c 6 0 the function x tanh cx is even and on 0 strictly monotonic this last condition implies k 1 contradicting the initial assumption of the paragraph and completing the proof of i imposing instead the neumann condition on r 1 forces c 1 c 2 so the dirichlet condition on r now demands coth ln k 1 tanh k 1 ln for any 0 the function on the left is even in strictly monotonic in on 0 and has limit ln 1 as goes to 0 moreover as tends to 0 the right hand side goes to 1 k thus this equation has exactly one solution completing the proof of ii remark 6 35 a simpler proof of 6 28 is also possible using the h metric instead of the metric and without reference to the a operators 6 7 can also be proved without using the metric approximate solutions on tori now we state some estimates for solutions to the poisson equation g e u f on the euclidean strip 6 36 tx 0 x r of given width x 0 with u subject to dirichlet data and f odd under reflection through the horizontal line y jy for given y 0 and every j z we set 6 37 k y r y 0 r y y in the applications to follow x will tend to infinity with m while y will be bounded indepen dently of m so it is important that the estimates here do not depend on x the additional decay estimate included in the proposition will be necessary to guarantee convergence of the iterative scheme used to construct global solutions on the initial surfaces proposition 6 38

this section is to apply propositions 6 7 and 6 38 iteratively on the extended standard regions to prove existence and obtain estimates of global solutions to the equation lu f on each initial surface proposition 6 50 fix 0 1 and data k n 1 n 2 or k n n 1 n 1 1 1 for an initial surface there is a positive integer m 0 such that for every m m 0 and for every initial surface defined by the corresponding data there exists a linear map 6 51 r c 0 g m 2 g c 2 g m 2 g and there exists a constant c 0 independent of m such that if f c 0 g m 2 g then lrf m 2 f and 6 52 rf c 2 g m 2 g c f c 0 g

c c c m 2 l rcf 1 s c and r f t t trt f f 2 s t c c crcf 1 s c the idea behind the definition of r f is as follows first we construct approximate solutions on each toral region the rt f s t terms and cut them off smoothly these solutions are only approximate since we have obtained them by applying the solution operator for the model problem on the euclidean strip and the resulting error is controlled by the deviation of the initial surface s geometry from the model geometry additional error supported in the tower regions is created by cutting off the approximate solution with t we know only that its size is controlled by that of the original f and we account for it in f 1 along with the restriction of the original f to the tower regions where we next construct and cut off approximate solutions in a similar fashion again there is error controlled by the geometry and also cutoff error for which we have no better bound than the norm of f but which is supported inside the toral regions far from their boundary so we can construct an approximate solution to correct for them and apply the decay estimate in 6 7 more precisely we now check that 6 61 f m 2 lr f c c m 2 c m 2 x c 1 g c a c 2 x c m 2 l rcf 1 s c t t x t 1 g e x t m 2 l rt f f 2 s t t t t m 2 l rt f 2 s t so noting that f 2 s t is supported far away from s t we find from 5 12 5 18 6 7 and 6 38 6 62 f m 2 lr f c 0 m 2 g c b m 1 2 ce b c b e a f c 0 m 2 g where c b is a constant depending on b but not on m and where c is a constant depending on neither b nor m thus we may at this stage fix b finally determining the extent of the toral regions sufficiently large in terms of c and then take m sufficiently large in terms of c b so as to ensure that m 2 lr is invertible the proof is then concluded by taking r r m 2 lr 1 7 the main theorem recall that given an initial surface with defining embedding x s 3 and a function u r we have defined the map xu s 3 by xu p expx p u p p exp being the exponential map on s 3 and a global unit normal for the initial surface for u c 2 loc sufficiently small xu is an immersion with well defined mean curvature h u relative to the global unit normal u having positive inner product with the parallel translates of along the geodesics it generates we now prove the main theorem by solving h u 0 35 theorem 7 1 given data a k n 1 n 2 or b k n n 1 n 1 1 1 for an initial surface recalling 4 13 there exist m 0 0 and c 0 such that whenever m m 0 the initial embedding x s 3 corresponding to the data can be perturbed to a minimal embedding xu s 3 by a function u c g depending on m that satisfies the estimate u c 2 m 2 g cm 3 2 here g is either a gk m or b g k m recalling 3 24 in particular xu has the same genus as see 4 17 is invariant under g and contains the scaffolding a ck m or b c k m recalling 3 23 moreover in the complement in s 3 of any tubular neighborhood of the circles of intersection of the initial configuration a wk or b w k for m sufficiently large xu is the graph over some subset of the initial configuration of a smooth function converging smoothly to 0 as m proof fix 0 1 2 by 5 12 and 5 18 the initial mean curvature satisfies 7 2 m 2 h 0 c 2 2 m 2 g cm 3 2 for a constant c independent of m setting 7 3 u 0 rm 2 h 0 then 6 50 implies that 7 4 u 0 c 2 2 m 2 g cm 3 2 for a possibly different constant c independent of m the function u 0 represents the first order correction to the initial surface to complete the perturbation we need to estimate the nonlinear part of h near 0 defined by 7 5 q u h u h 0 lu to proceed efficiently we consider the blown up metric m 2 g s on s 3 given u r we can define xu m 2 g s s 3 by xu m 2 g s p exp m 2 g s x p u p m 2 g s p where expm 2 g s is the exponential map on s 3 m 2 g s and m 2 g s is the m 2 g s unit normal for parallel to of course expm 2 g s exp m 2 g s m 1 and xu xmu m 2 g s for u c 2 loc sufficiently small we can define also hm 2 gs u to be the mean curvature of xu m 2 g s relative to m 2 g s and m 1 u obviously 7 6 h u mhm 2 g s mu so 7 7 m 2 q u m 2 1 0 t 0 d 2 ds 2 h su ds dt m 1 1 0 t 0 d 2 ds 2 hm 2 gs smu ds dt now if mu c 2 loc is sufficiently small in terms of the riemannian curvature of s 3 m 2 g s and the second fundamental form of x relative to m 2 g s then xu will be an immersion h u will be well defined and moreover 7 8 sup s 0 1 d 2 ds 2 hm 2 gs smu c 0 2 m 2 g c mu c 2 2 m 2 g 2 where c is a constant controlled by finitely many covariant derivatives of the riemannian curvature of the ambient space s 3 m 2 g s and finitely many covariant derivatives of the second fundamental form of x relative to m 2 g s of course the riemannian curvature of s 3 m 2 g s is bounded uniformly in m tending to 0 in fact and all of its derivatives vanish while x itself depends on m each derivative of its second fundamental form relative to m 2 g s is bounded independently of m consequently if b is the closed ball of radius m 7 4 in c 2 2 m 2 g and v b we have 7 9 m 2 q u 0 v c 2 2 m 2 g cm 2 36 evidently then taking m large enough f v m 2 rq u 0 v defines a map f b b which is continuous with respect to the c 2 m 2 g norm on b as well as the c 2 2 m 2 g norm so by the schauder fixed point theorem admits a fixed point v 0 b accordingly lv 0 q u 0 v 0 and 7 10 h u 0 v 0 h 0 lu 0 lv 0 q u 0 v 0 0 the higher regularity of u u 0 v 0 then follows immediately and the c 0 decay estimate of mu ensures embeddedness 8 further results and discussion highly symmetric constructions with obstructions in this subsection we briefly outline a highly symmetric construction where the symmetry imposed is not so great that there are no obstructions the obstruction space is nontrivial but of finite dimension independent of the sym metries and the genus of the surfaces constructed the construction can easily be explained in terms of the earlier presentation the initial configuration used is w k and the symmetry group imposed is gk m and not g k m this corresponds to using the scaffolding ck m wk the towers desingularizing c 1 and c 2 are then symmetric enough that they carry no kernel the construction in this respect can proceed as the earlier one in 7 1 on the other hand the towers desingularizing the circles c j t tj are classical scherk singly periodic surfaces and the symmetries imposed fix tj but not t this situation is similar to many recent constructions 12 13 20 where there is enough symmetry to simplify the obstruction space in comparison to the more general situation in 7 but not enough to render it trivial as in 7 1 more precisely we have a two dimensional kernel one dimension for each circle of intersection c 1 and c 2 note that modulo the symmetries these are the only circles of intersection besides c 1 and c 2 there are no circles in the scaffolding contained in t and therefore t is not held fixed by the construction we introduce then two continuous parameters in the construction x 1 and x 2 c 1 is replaced by a parallel copy on t 1 at signed distance x 1 and similarly c 2 is replaced by a parallel copy on t 2 at signed distance x 2 by the symmetries then all c j are appropriately replaced also t is a union of annuli with boundaries the c j these are replaced then by minimal graphs so that the new annuli span the c j s this way t is replaced by a new torus with derivative discontinuities along its circles of intersection with the tj s the construction of the initial surfaces then proceeds as usual by using towers appropriately note that modulo the symmetries there are four circles which get desingularized c 1 c 2 and the perturbed to new positions c 1 c 2 following the same conventions as in section 4 we denote by n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 the number of half periods the desingularizing towers will have between successive circles of reflection in ck m along c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 respectively this together with three alignment parameters 1 2 and the continuous parameters x 1 and x 2 determine the initial surfaces we have the following theorem 8 1 given data k n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 2 for an initial surface as outlined above there exists m 0 0 such that whenever m m 0 one of the initial surfaces for some appropriate values of x 1 x 2 described above can be perturbed to a minimal surface which contains ck m is symmetric under the action of gk m and has genus k k 1 m n 1 n 2 k 2 m n 1 n 2 1 moreover as m the minimal surfaces converge as varifolds to w k proof the proof combines the arguments for 7 1 with the arguments for constructions like in 12 13 20 details will be presented elsewhere 37 corollaries of a general desingularization theorem in this subsection we discuss corollaries in our setting of a general desingularization theorem announced in 8 theorem f and 9 theorem 3 1 the statement of this theorem is motivated in 8 section 14 and its proof is outlined in detail in 9 sections 5 8 and will be presented in detail in 11 we will refer to this theorem in the rest of the discussion as the general theorem the general theorem applies to situations where the intersection curves are transverse and have double points only because the corresponding general construction is understood only when classical scherk surfaces are used to model the desingularizing regions in the vicinity of the intersection curves therefore we can only consider the cases where the initial configurations in our setting are w 2 or w 2 recall 3 8 excluding the possibility k 3 recall that in the first case we have two clifford tori t 1 and t 2 intersecting orthogonally along two totally orthogonal circles c 1 and c 2 in the second case we have three pairwise orthogonal clifford tori t 1 t 2 t with six intersection circles c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 1 and c 4 c 2 where we also have t 1 t c 2 t c 4 t 2 t c 3 t c 1 t t c 1 t c 2 t 1 t 2 c 1 c 2 t 1 t c 1 c 3 and t 2 t c 2 c 4 as follows from 3 10 3 11 and 3 13 with k 2 following the general theorem we define c c 1 c 2 c c 1 c 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 and w 2 or w 2 recall 3 8 the abstract surfaces with connected components the closures of the connected components of w 2 c or w 2 c recall now that by the discussion of the clifford tori in section 3 any clifford torus t is covered isometrically by c with deck transformations generated by z z 2 and z z 2 i the linearized operator for the mean curvature is l 4 which clearly has a four dimensional kernel with basis sin 2 x sin 2 y sin 2 x cos 2 y cos 2 x sin 2 y cos 2 x cos 2 y where z x iy are the standard coordinates on c an alternative basis is given by sin 2 x y cos 2 x y the existence of kernel means that the general theorem cannot be applied unless we impose enough symmetry to ensure that the kernel modulo the symmetries becomes trivial to impose these symmetries we consider the scaffolding cmin w 2 defined by cmin c 0 0 c 0 2 recall 3 9 and the corresponding group gmin grefl cmin o 4 it is easy to calculate then that 8 2 gmin is 3 r c 0 0 r c 0 2 r c 1 note that for m 1 we have gmin g 2 m gmin g 2 m cmin c 2 m and cmin c 2 m if we impose gmin as the group of symmetries of the construction then c 0 0 c 1 t 1 has to be contained in the nodal lines of any eigenfunction allowed by the symmetries on t 1 t 1 this way is subdivided into two flat squares of side length the eigenvalues for the laplacian on each square with dirichlet boundary data are of the form j 21 j 2 2 with j 1 j 2 z 0 4 is not included then working similarly on t 2 we conclude that there is no kernel modulo the symmetries on w 2 we have also to check that there is no kernel on w 2 in this case we have to impose an extra dirichlet condition on c 2 and then t 1 or t 2 is subdivided into four flat rectangles of sides by 2 and the eigenvalues allowed are j 21 4 j 2 2 with j 1 j 2 z 0 and so 4 is again not included we study now the case of w 2 first we check that there is no kernel on t because of the symmetry r c 1 we can assume that we are working on a rectangular instead of a square flat torus with sides of length 2 and 2 the eigenvalues of the laplacian then are 8 j 21 2 j 2 2 with j 1 j 2 z 0 which do not include 4 to check that there is no kernel on w 2 note first that on t 1 dirichlet conditions are imposed on c 1 c 2 c 0 0 c 1 and c 3 this subdivides t 1 into eight flat rectangles of sides 4 by where the laplacian with dirichlet conditions on the boundary 38 have eigenvalues 16 j 21 j 2 2 with j 1 j 2 z 0 similarly for t 2 so it remains only to check t this has dirichlet conditions imposed on c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 t is then subdivided into four flat cylindrical annuli of width 4 and so without even using the symmetries we have that the smallest eigenvalue is 16 so that 4 is again not included applying then the general desingularization theorem announced in 8 theorem f and 9 theorem 3 1 we have the following as a corollary theorem 8 3 w 2 can be desingularized to produce embedded closed minimal surfaces in s 3 sym metric under gmin of genus n 1 n 2 1 where the towers desingularizing c 1 and c 2 include n 1 and n 2 periods respectively provided n 1 and n 2 are large enough in absolute terms as n 1 n 2 the minimal surfaces tend to w 2 similarly w 2 can be desingularized to produce embedded closed minimal surfaces in s 3 symmetric under gmin of genus n 1 n 2 2 n 1 2 n 2 1 where the towers desingularizing c 1 and c 2 include n 1 and n 2 periods respectively the towers desingularizing c 1 and c 3 include n 1 periods and the towers desingularizing c 2 and c 4 include n 2 periods provided n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 are large enough in absolute terms as n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 the minimal surfaces tend to w 2 note that the main difference of this result compared with the earlier ones is the small symme try imposed and and that the still large number of periods along each circle can be prescribed independently on each circle except for the identifications by the symmetries of c 1 with c 3 and c 2 with c 4 as opposed to requiring that all numbers have a large
