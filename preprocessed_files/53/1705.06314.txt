tire tracks and integrable curve evolution gil bor mark levi ron perline sergei tabachnikov march 13 2018 abstract we study a simple model of bicycle motion a segment of fixed length in multi dimensional euclidean space moving so that the velocity of the rear end is always aligned with the segment if the front track is prescribed the trajectory of the rear wheel is uniquely determined via a certain first order differential equation the bicycle equation the same model in dimension two describes another mechanical device the hatchet planimeter here is a sampler of our results we express the linearized flow of the bicycle equation in terms of the geometry of the rear track in dimension three for closed front and rear tracks this is a version of the berry phase formula we show that in all dimensions a sufficiently long bicycle also serves as a planimeter it measures approximately the area bivector de fined by the closed front track we prove that the bicycle equation also describes rolling without slipping and twisting of hyperbolic space along euclidean space we relate the bicycle problem with two completely in tegrable systems the akns ablowitz kaup newell and segur system and the vortex filament equation we show that bicycle correspondence of space curves front tracks sharing a common back track is a special case of a darboux transformation associated with the akns system we show that the filament hierarchy encoded as a single generating equation describes a 3 dimensional bike of imaginary length we show that a series of examples of ambiguous closed bicycle curves front tracks admitting self bicycle correspondence found recently f wegner are buckled rings or solitons of the planar filament equation as a case study we give a detailed analysis of such curves

such a way that the velocity of the rear end is aligned with the segment the rear bicycle wheel is fixed on its frame whereas the front wheel can steer the same no skid non holonomic constraint describes the bicycle motion in rn and more generally in any riemannian manifold for example hyperbolic and elliptic spaces 2 the bicycle model the bicycle model has attracted much attention in re cent years due in part to its unexpected relations with other mathematical problems old and new we start with a brief description of these relations and recent work on this bicycle model figure 1 the bicycle front and rear tracks if the front track is prescribed the trajectory of the rear wheel is uniquely determined once the initial orientation of the bicycle is chosen via a certain first order differential equation the bicycle equation equation 4 of section 2 in dimension two this equation is equivalent to the much studied stationary schro dinger or hill equation x p t x 0 whose potential p t depends on the geometry of the front track and the length of the bicycle 38 39 the bicycle monodromy associated with any given front track closed or not one defines the bicycle monodromy i e the map sn 1 sn 1 which assigns to each initial orientation of the bike its final orientation once the front wheel completes its travel in dimension two foote 21 observed that this map is a mo bius transformation this observation was extended to rn in 40 we give a new proof in theorem 3 the hatchet planimeter and menzin s conjecture the bicycle model in dimension two describes also a device known as the hatchet or prytz planime ter for measuring areas of planar domains the hatchet planimeter consists of a rod with a hatchet blade fixed at one end and a pointed pin at the other as shown in figure 2 to measure the area of a planar region one traces its bound ary with the pin the hatchet slides on the paper without sideslip behaving like the rear wheel of a bike the angle between the hatchet s initial and final orientations gives an approximation of the area a of the region with an error of order o 1 a 2 o 1 1 where is the hatchet s length see 21 22 30 a natural question is whether this formula is an approximation to some exact result in section 2 7 we show 3 figure 2 the hatchet planimeter that indeed is an approximation to the solid angle of a certain cone in r 3 planimeters were popular objects of mathematical study some 100 years ago in particular menzin 1906 conjectured that if a 2 then the monodromy has a fixed point that is for a particular initial orientation of the planimeter the trajectory of the blade is closed in other words the monodromy is a hyperbolic element of the mo bius group psl 2 r this conjecture was proved in 40 see 22 43 for expository accounts and 32 for a version of this theorem in spherical and hyperbolic geometries bicycle correspondence a closed rear track determines two front tracks one riding forward and the other backward relative to some chosen direction of the rear track these two front tracks are said to be in the bicycle correspon dence figure 3 the heavy and dotted curves are in bicycle correspondence the thin curve is their common back track bicycle correspondence of curves has a number of remarkable properties it satisfies the so called bianchi permutability and it preserves the conjugacy class of the bicycle monodromy with an arbitrary length of the bicycle not only the one that defines the bicycle correspondence see 57 58 and section 3 1 below as a result bicycle correspondence has infinitely many conserved quantities starting with the perimeter in dimension three bicycle correspondence is intimately related to the well studied filament a k a binormal smoke ring localized induction equation a completely integrable dynamical system on the space of smooth closed curves in 4 r 3 equivalent to the nonlinear schro dinger equation via the hashimoto trans formation 29 bicycle correspondence is the darboux ba cklund transformation of the filament equation it commutes with the flow of the filament equation and shares with it its integrals and an invariant symplectic structure 58 zindler curves an interesting problem is whether one can determine the direction of motion given closed rear and front tracks of a bicycle usually this is possible but sometimes it is not for example if the tracks are concentric circles see 19 the front track in such an ambiguous pair of curves is in bicycle correspondence with itself in other words two points x and y can traverse this curve in such a way that the distance xy remains constant and the velocity of the midpoint of the segment xy is aligned with this segment let us call the curves with this property zindler curves see 67 incidentally zindler curves provide solutions to another problem ulam s problem in flotation theory 51 problem 19 which bodies float in equilibrium in all positions in the two dimensional case the boundary of such a body is a zindler curve see 5 49 50 for early work 1 recently a wealth of results concerning this problem was obtained in 6 7 56 and in a series of papers by f wegner 61 66 wegner constructed a family of non trivial zindler figure 4 examples of zindler curves from 66 curves 2 described explicitly in terms of elliptic functions he was motivated by a study of the motion of an electron in a magnetic field whose strength depends quadratically on the distance to the origin the three problems in 66 are the ambiguous tire track problem ulam s flotation problem and the motion of an electron a full description of planar zindler curves let alone their higher dimensional version is still unknown let us also mention a discrete version of the bicycle correspondence and in particular a polygonal version of zindler curves 56 57 plan of the paper in section 2 we discuss various forms of the bicycle dif ferential equation most of them appeared previously in the literature paying special attention to the most interesting two and three dimensional cases and 1 see 27 for historical information in particular about herman auerbach 1901 1942 2 he did not use this terminology 5 give a new proof that the bicycle monodromy is a mo bius transformation the orems 1 3 our goal here is to present a unified group theoretic approach to these foundational matters the geometry of bike tracks in r 2 is greatly clarified by extension of the problem to r 3 without such extension some phenomena remain hidden the orem 4 stated for any dimension is a new result it describes the derivative of the bicycle monodromy at a fixed point in terms of the geometry of the corresponding closed rear track in dimension three one has the berry phase formula corollary 2 19 the derivative in question is a complex number whose modulus depends on the signed length of the rear track and whose argument is the hannay angle that is the area on the unit sphere bounded by the tangent gauss image of the rear track this fact is then used to explain geometrically via berry s phase why the planimeter works a two dimensional version of the formula for the derivative of the monodromy at the fixed point was obtained in 40 as we mentioned earlier in the planar case a sufficiently long bicycle serves as a planimeter in theorem 5 we show that a similar fact holds in higher dimensions the bicycle measures approximately the area bivector determined by the front track theorem 6 of section 2 gives yet another interpretation of the bicycle equa tion this equation describes rolling without slipping and twisting of the hy perbolic space along euclidean space with the front track being the trajectory of the contact point this interpretation fits naturally with the fact that the bicycle monodromy is a mo bius transformation an isometry of the hyperbolic space section 3 is concerned with the relation of the bicycle problem with the filament equation the equation defines a flow on the space of smooth closed curves in r 3 a completely integrable hamiltonian system part of an infinite hierarchy of pairwise commuting hamiltonian vector fields we start with a detailed description of the notion of bicycle correspondence between curves and give a new proof that this correspondence preserves the conjugacy class of the bicycle monodromy theorem 7 the filament equation shares with the bicycle equation its invariance under bicycle correspondence known as the darboux or ba cklund transformation in the context of the filament equation in section 3 2 we encode the filament hierarchy in a single equation with a formal parameter and show corollary 3 14 that this equation coincides with the equation of a 3 dimensional bike of imaginary length given a closed front bicycle track it is intuitively clear that if the length of the bicycle is infinitesimal then there exist two closed trajectories of the bicycle corresponding to the bicycle near tangent to the front track pointing either forward or backward proposition 3 15 provides a rigorous analysis of this phenomenon in dimension 3 as a result in theorem 8 we obtain an infinite collection of integrals of the bicycle correspondence that conjecturally coincide with the known integrals of the filament equation the hamiltonians of the commuting hierarchy of vector fileds the classical bernoulli elastica are extrema of the total squared curvature 6 functional among curves with fixed length buckled rings or pressurized elas tica are plane curves that are extrema of the total squared curvature functional subject to length and area constraints in section 3 3 we prove that the curves constructed by wegner are buckled rings theorem 9 this provides a connec tion with the planar filament equation another completely integrable system a close relative of the 3 dimensional filament equation buckled rings are solitons of the planar filament equation that is evolve under its flow by isometries section 4 provides a detailed study of a family of zindler curves the ones in bicycle correspondence with multiply traversed circles theorem 10 the paper is concluded with two appendices in appendix a we describe a relation of the bicycle equation with yet another integrable system the akns ablowitz kaup newell and segur system we show theorem 12 that the bicycle correspondence in dimension three can be thought of as a special case of a darboux transformation associated with the akns system in appendix b we provide a proof of the main analytical tool proposition 3 15 needed to establish the existence of the integrals of the bicycle correspondence of theorem 8 acknowledgments we thank r montgomery j langer l herna ndez and f wegner for inspiring discussions gb and rp are grateful to the department of

1510055 respectively 2 the bicycle equation and its monodromy 2 1 the bicycle equation we consider a smoothly parametrized curve t in rn the front track and a real number 0 the bicycle length a rear track is by the definition any parametrized curve t in rn that satisfies t t 2 t t is tangent to at t 3 to keep track of the direction of the rear wheel relative to the front wheel we introduce the unit direction vector r t sn 1 see figure 5 thus rewriting condition 2 expressing the bicycle rigidity condition as t t r t condition 3 expressing the rear wheel no skid condition is then equivalent to an ordinary differential equation for r t which we now state proposition 2 1 let t r t be parameterized curves in rn sn 1 respec tively 0 and t t r t then the no skid condition 3 is equivalent to r v v r r 4 where v and where denotes the scalar product 7 figure 5 the bicycling no skid condition equation 4 is the bicycle equation in rn defined for every parametrized front track t and bicycle length proof let us decompose v as v v v where v v are the orthogonal projections of v onto rr r respectively as in figure 6 then conditions 2 3 are equivalent to v from r follows v r hence v is equivalent to 0 v r now v v v v v r r from which equation 4 follows figure 6 the proof of proposition 2 1 remark 2 2 equation 4 was derived above for r t sn 1 and indeed it leaves invariant the condition r 1 as can be easily checked but it makes sense also for arbitrary r t rn for which it has also an interesting mechanical interpretation at least in the r 1 case see section 2 10 below remark 2 3 even if is a regularly immersed curve i e does not vanish may vanish from equation 4 we see that v r vanishes precisely when v r 0 that is when the bicycle is perpendicular to the front wheel track in the planar case the resulting singularities of are generically semi cubical cusps see 40 section 2 for more information the conceptual explanation of the singularities is as follows 3 the config uration space of oriented segments of length in rn is the spherization of the tangent bundle strn and the non holonomic no skid constraint defines a completely non integrable n dimensional distribution d therein the motion of 3 this explanation can be safely skipped at first reading 8 the bicycle is a smooth curve in strn tangent to the distribution d i e a horizontal curve relative to the distribution figure 7 the two projections strn rn the two projections strn rn to the front and rear ends of the segment yield the front and rear bicycle tracks see figure 7 the former projection is transverse to d therefore the front track is a smooth curve but the kernel of the latter projection is contained in d and hence the rear track may have singularities this happens when the horizontal curve is tangent to this kernel 2 2 the bicycle monodromy given a parameterized curve t in rn consider the family of unit spheres centered at points of and identify these spheres with each other by parallel translation 4 fix a point t 0 on the curve then according to proposition 2 1 conditions 2 and 3 define for each t for which t is defined and 0 a diffeomorphism m t s n 1 sn 1 called the bicycle monodromy that maps r 0 to r t where r t is the solution to equation 4 satisfying the initial condition r t 0 r 0 in other words m t is the flow of the differential equation 4 example 2 4 let be the x axis in r 2 parameterized by t t 0 substitute r cos sin in equation 4 where t and obtain sin another substitution p tan 2 linearizes this equation yielding p p with solution p t p 0 e t the resulting rear track is the classical tractrix and we can use the solution p t to give it an explicit parametrization see e g 21 for details example 2 5 let be the unit circle in r 2 parameterized by t cos t sin t as in the previous example substitute r cos sin in equation 4 giving 4 such an identification is assumed throughout the paper 9 figure 8 the tractrix cos t changing to t gives 1 cos changing again to p tan 2 gives p 1 2 p 2 1 1 this is a constant coefficient riccati equation that can be solved explicitly in elementary functions see section 4 below for details figure 9 the circular tractrix 2 3 bicycling in r 2 there are a number of reformulations of equation 4 for n 2 found in the literature 18 21 22 40 56 we collect them in this subsection first we use an angle coordinate on s 1 i e substitute r cos sin in equation 4 obtaining v 1 sin v 2 cos v 1 v 2 5 now the projective coordinate p tan 2 i e the slope of a vector with the argument 2 satisfies the riccati equation p 1 2 v 2 2 v 1 p v 2 p 2 v 1 v 2 6 a consequence of equation 6 is the following theorem of foote 21 10 theorem 1 the flow of equation 5 is the projection to s 1 of the flow of the linear system x y 1 2 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 1 x y 7 via the double covering map using complex notation z x iy 7 r z 2 z 2 or more explicitly x y 7 r x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 xy x 2 y 2 thus the bicycle monodromy for n 2 is given by elements of the mo bius group psl 2 r of fractional linear transformations p 7 ap b cp d proof it is well known that the flow of a riccati equation consists of mo bius transformations see e g 33 p 24 let us review the argument consider the linear system x y a b c a x y 8 one can check easily that a solution x t y t of this system projects to a solution p t y t x t of the equation p c 2 ap bp 2 9 thus the flow of the riccati equation 9 is the projectivization of the flow of the linear system 8 applying this procedure to equation 7 we obtain equation 6 and thus 5 the next reformulation of equation 4 is obtained by switching to a moving frame along the frenet serret frame to this end assume first that is parameterized by arclength so that v is a unit tangent vector along complete v to a positively oriented orthonormal frame v n along then v n where is the curvature function along now we use an angle coordinate for r in the moving frame v n i e let r ei v cos v sin n note the angle is minus the steering angle of 40 proposition 2 6 r ei v satisfies equation 4 for n 2 if and only if t satisfies sin using the projective coordinate p tan 2 the last equation is equivalent to p p 2 1 p 2 10 which is the projectivization p y x of the linear system x y 1 2 1 1 x y the proof is a direct calculation and we omit it 11 figure 10 the frenet serret frame along 2 4 bicycling in r 3 similar to the n 2 case equation 4 for n 3 can be reformulated in a variety of ways to begin with we rewrite equation 4 for n 3 using the vector product in r 3 lemma 2 7 equation 4 for n 3 is equivalent to r 1 v r r v 11 we omit the simple verification next we rewrite equation 11 as a complex riccati equation i e as the projectivization of a 2 dimensional complex linear system theorem 2 the flow of equation 11 is the projection to s 2 of the flow of the complex linear system z 1 z 2 1 2 v 1 v 2 iv 3 v 2 iv 3 v 1 z 1 z 2 v 1 v 2 v 3 12 via the complex hopf fibration c 2 0 s 2 z 1 z 2 7 r z 1 2 z 2 2 z 1 2 z 2 2 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 2 z 2 2 r c r 3 using the complex coordinate z z 2 z 1 r 2 ir 3 1 r 1 on s 2 cp 1 the linear system 12 projects to the complex riccati equation z 1 2 q 2 v 1 z q z 2 v v 1 v 2 v 3 q v 2 iv 3 13 it follows that the bicycle monodromy in r 3 is given by elements of the complex mo bius group psl 2 c the proof is by direct calculation which we omit in the next subsection we give a more conceptual group theoretic explanation of theorems 1 and 2 12 remark 2 8 note that the riccati equation 13 reduces to equation 6 for q v 2 that is for a planar curve with v 3 0 we now derive a moving frame version of equation 13 assume is parameterized by arc length so that v is a unit vector and complete v to the frenet serret frame v n b along satisfying the equations v n n v b b n where are the curvature and torsion of proposition 2 9 let r r 1 v r 2 n r 3 b be a unit vector field along an arc length parameterized curve in r 3 then r t satisfies equation 11 if and only if r r 1 r 2 r 3 satisfies r 1 e 1 r r 14 where e 1 e 3 the darboux vector of in the frenet frame and e 1 10 0 e 3 00 1 using the complex coordinate z r 2 ir 3 1 r 1 on the r sphere stere ographic projection from e 1 onto the r 2 r 3 plane we obtain the complex riccati equation z 1 i z 2 1 z 2 15 the projectivization z z 2 z 1 of the linear system z 1 z 2 1 2 1 i 1 i z 1 z 2 16 the proof is again a direct calculation that we omit note that the bracketed term in equation 14 is the angular velocity of the bike expressed in the frenet frame note also that equation 15 reduces to equation 10 for a planar curve 0 2 5 reformulation for general n using the mo bius group in this section we present another way to interpret the bicycle flow 4 to illus trate the idea for n 2 the higher dimensional case works almost verbatim the circle r 1 is embedded in minkowski s 3 space r 3 as shown in figure 11 namely as the intersection of the cone x 21 x 2 2 x 23 0 and the horizontal plane x 3 1 each generating ray of the cone is uniquely determined by a unit vector r as shown in figure 11 we then consider linear flows in r 3 preserving the lorentz quadratic form x 21 x 2 2 x 23 so that the cone is invariant under 13 any such lorentz orthogonal flow we show that the bicycle flow on r at time t corresponds to a particular linear lorentz orthogonal flow namely to a flow with two eigendirections lying in the vertical plane through the origin containing v where v t figure 11 the null cone in r 2 1 the arrows along the two cone generators show the direction of the flow along the eigendirections of a in lemma 2 11 below the same construction shows how the bicycle flow extends from the circle r 1 to a flow of the disk r 1 by hyperbolic isometries we now proceed with the formal discussion for general n let rn 1 be n 1 dimensional space equipped with the quadratic form x x x 1 2 xn 2 xn 1 2 x x 1 xn 1 let so n 1 gl r n 1 be the orientation and time orientation preserving lin ear isometries of rn 1 the identity component of the lorentz orthogonal group on 1 its lie algebra son 1 consists of n 1 n 1 matrices written in block form as b v vt 0 v v 1 vn t rn b son i e bt b let rn 1 x r n 1 xn 1 0 and rn 1 r n x x xn 1 7 x xn 1 x x 1 xn 17 for each 0 let hn x r n 1 x x 2 18 and c x rn 1 x x 0 14 equip rn 1 with the flat pseudo riemannian metric induced by g dx dx dx 1 2 dxn 2 dxn 1 2 using this notation we collect in the next proposition some standard facts about the geometry of the so n 1 action on r n 1 see e g 8 proposition 2 10 for all n 2 1 hn and c are the so n 1 orbits of 0 0 t and 1 1 0 0 t respec tively 2 the flat pseudo riemannian metric g dx dx on rn 1 restricts on hn to a riemannian metric of constant negative sectional curvature 1 2 on which so n 1 acts transitively as its group of orientation preserving isometries hn 1 is the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic n space 3 for each 0 the restriction of to hn r n 1 is a diffeomorphism onto the unit ball bn r rn r 1 the induced metric on bn is ds 2 2 1 r 2 r dr 2 1 r 2 dr 2 19 bn equipped with this metric for 1 is the klein belrami or projective model of hyperbolic n space 4 the restriction of g to c is degenerate for all x c the line rx txc is orthogonal to txc descending to a conformal riemannian metric on its spherization sn 1 c r isomorphic to the standard conformal structure on sn 1 see next item 5 the image of c under is sn 1 bn the metric g restricted to c descends via to the standard round conformal metric on sn 1 the action of so n 1 on c descends to s n 1 preserving the conformal structure the group so n 1 acting in the described way is called the mo bius group mob sn 1 6 mob sn for n 2 is the full group of orientation preserving conformal transformations of sn mob s 1 is the projective group psl 2 r the following lemma is borrowed from 40 we reproduce its proof here for the convenience of the reader lemma 2 11 for each v rn consider the linear vector field v on rn 1 v x ax where a 0 n v vt 0 son 1 then under the projection rn 1 rn of formula 17 v maps to the vector field on rn defined by the right hand side of equation 4 15 proof let x x xn 1 r n 1 and x x xn 1 a tangent vector at x where x x 1 xn then by formula 17 the derivative of at x is x 7 xn 1 x x xn 1 xn 1 2 next let x v x ax then x x xn 1 where x xn 1 v and xn 1 x v it folllows that the image of v x under d is xn 1 xn 1 v x x v x 2 n 1 v v r r as a consequence of the previous proposition and lemma we obtain the following theorem proved for n 2 in 21 and for general n in 40 theorem 3 the flow of equation 4 for all r is the projection via rn 1 rn defined in equation 17 of the flow of the linear system in rn 1 with son 1 coefficient matrix x 1 0 n v vt 0 x v 20 it follows that 1 the bicycle monodromy m t s n 1 sn 1 is a mo bius transformation well defined for all t for which t is defined 2 the flow of equation 4 preserves the unit open ball bn r 1 on which it acts by isometries of the hyperbolic metric of equation 19 remark 2 12 in section 2 10 below we interpret the hyperbolic isometries of item 2 of theorem 3 above as rolling without slipping and twisting of hn along r n the flow of equation 4 also preserves the complement of the closed unit ball r 1 on which it acts by isometries of a curved lorenzian metric we do not pursue here this aspect of the bicycle monodromy but it would be interesting to find a mechanical geometric interpretation of this flow remark 2 13 the bicycle equation 4 can be also reformulated in the lan guage of bundles and connections which some readers might find useful a similar interpretation for n 2 appeared in 21 this formulation leads to a straighforward generalization of the bicycling equation on any riemannian manifold we sketch here this formulation consider the son 1 valued 1 form on rn 1 0 0 dx 1 0 0 dxn dx 1 dxn 0 21 we view as the 1 form of an so n 1 connection on the trivial principal bundle rn so n 1 r n for any space f on which so n 1 acts defines the covariant 16 derivative d d of sections f rn f of the associated bundle rn f rn namely df df f and a section is parallel if df 0 equation 20 is then the equation for paralell transport in the vector bundle associated to the standard represetation of so n 1 on r n 1 the projectivization of this representation has 3 orbits the projectivized null cone sn 1 its interior bn and the exterior rpn bn on each of these orbits so n 1 acts as the automorphism group of a different structure isometries of a hyperbolic metric on bn mo bius transformation of sn 1 and isometries of a lorentzian metric on rpn bn the parallel transport in the associated bundle rn rpn rn is given by the bicycle equation 4 where r is used as an affine coordinate for an arbitrary riemannian manifold m the bicycling equation defines an so n 1 connection on its unit tangent sphere bundle in general this connection is non flat unless m has a metric of constant curvature 1 2 i e is hyperbolic in which case the connection defines an interesting foliation of the unit tangent bundle of m see example 3 6 17 on p 165 of 42 2 6 the special isomorphisms so 2 1 sl 2 r so 3 1 sl 2 c for n 2 3 there are special isomorphisms which enable us to replace equa tion 20 with a more compact linear system with 2 2 real or complex matrices instead of 3 3 or 4 4 real matrices respectively 2 6 1 n 2 let sl 2 r be the lie algebra of sl 2 r i e the set of traceless real 2 2 matrices a we equip sl 2 r with the quadratic form det a this form has signature 2 1

parameterized front curve in rn and m sn 1 sn 1 the associ ated bicycle monodromy between two points t 0 t 1 on with t 0 t 1 theorem 4 for every n 2 0 and r 0 sn 1 the derivative m r 0 tr 0 s n 1 tr 1 sn 1 is given by m r 0 e l p where r 1 r t 1 and r t is the solution to equation 4 with r t 0 r 0 t t r t is the corresponding rear track l t 1 t 0 r v dt v is the signed length of p iso tr 0 sn 1 tr 1 sn 1 is the parallel transport in tsn 1 with respect to the levi civita connection along the curve r t t 0 t t 1 remark 2 17 the sign of the length element r v dt of the rear track is adjusted to coincide with the geometric intuition of forward riding of being counted as positive length and backward riding as negative the sign is reversed at a cusp proof of theorem 4 note first that for every 0 tr 0 sn 1 one has m r 0 0 t 1 where t tr t sn 1 is the solution to the linearization of equation 4 along r t satisfying t 0 0 namely v r v r v 19 it follows that v r is the orthogonal projection of on trsn 1 but this is precisely the definition of the covariant derivative along a submanifold in rn that is r r v 24 where is the levi civita connection on sn 1 next let u r v f t exp t t 0 u s ds and t the parallel trans port of t 0 along r t that is t 0 t 0 and r 0 the theorem then amounts to f to show this it is enough to show that both f have the same value at t t 0 and satisfy the same first order differential equation by equation 24 satisfies r u now f by its definition satisfies f t 0 1 and f uf hence f t 0 t 0 and r f f f r f u f therefore f remark 2 18 for n 3 theorem 4 implies that m is a conformal transfor mation since parallel transport is an isometry so it gives an alternative proof of theorem 3 item 1 the most interesting case of theorem 4 is that of a closed curve in r 3 where m psl 2 c generically m has two fixed points in s 2 and is thus conjugate to the mo bius transformation z 7 z whose fixed points are 0 with m 0 m 1 the conjugacy class of m is thus given by the derivatives 1 at the fixed points corollary 2 19 berry phase formula let be a closed curve in r 3 r 0 s 2 a fixed point of the bicycle monordomy of with respect to some initial point t 0 and the corresponding closed rear track then m r 0 e l i 25 where l is the signed length of and is the area in s 2 enclosed by the spherical curve r t proof by the gauss bonnet theorem parallel transport around a closed curve in s 2 is a rotation by an angle equal to the area of the spherical region bounded by the curve remark 2 20 i the last corollary and its proof still hold when the spherical curve r t is not simple provided is defined as the algebraic or signed area of the spherical region bounded by r t see e g 2 20 ii for n 2 in the case of hyperbolic monodromy with being one of the two periodic rear tracks the formula reduces to m r 0 e l as in theorem 3 6 of 40 this formula determines the conjugacy class of the bicycle monodromy when it is a hyperbolic element of psl 2 r the elliptic case on the other hand becomes clear only once we embed the bike in r 3 as explained below in section 2 9 iii for a generic in r 3 the m iterates of all points on the sphere except for the unstable fixed point approach the stable fixed point this means that all spatial motions of the bike save the unstable periodic one ap proach the stable periodic motion the case of planar in r 3 is special m commutes with reflections in the plane and in the elliptic case m is conjugate to a rigid rotation of s 2 all the bike motions in r 3 are then periodic or quasiperiodic with two frequencies iv in the planar elliptic case embedded in r 3 the length of each of the two periodic rear tracks is zero as follows from equation 25 v here is a heuristic explanation for the appearance of berry phase in formula 25 figure 12 shows two infinitesimally close bikes with rear wheels at r r 1 sharing the same front trajectory at f with r tracing a closed back track and r 1 a nearby not necessarily closed back track consider the unit vector rr 1 rr 1 the key observation is that the angular velocity of around the axis rf is zero figure 12 a heuristic explanation for the appearance of berry s phase to justify this let us decompose v f as v vplane v where vplane is the orthogonal projection of v unto the frr 1 plane and v the per pendicular component as shown in figure 12 let us consider separately the effects of vplane and v first the motion of r and r 1 due to vplane occurs in the plane rfr 1 and thus rr 1 does not rotate about any axis in that plane let alone 21 about fr second the component v does not even contribute to the velocities of r and r 1 and therefore v has no effect on the motion of this zero angular velocity statement is equivalent to saying that under goes parallel transport on the sphere centered at f along the curve traced on it by r it follows by the gauss bonnet theorem that the vector will end up rotated by an angle equal to the solid angle or spherical area bounded by the closed path traced by r as viewed by an observer moving with f 2 8 bicycle as a planimeter in rn as we mentioned in the introduction the planar bicycle can serve as a planime ter in this section we examine the higher dimensional version of this phe nomenon let be a closed curve in rn the bicycle front track of length l let the bicycle length be 1 as before v and r is a unit vector along the bicycle segment the bicycle equation 4 with an initial condition is r v v r r r 0 r 0 26 the following theorem generalizes the hatchet planimeter formula 1 the area bounded by a closed plane curve t is given by the integral 1 2 det dt for a curve in rn an analog of the area is the area bivector 1 2 dt which contains the information about the areas bounded by the projections of the curve on all coordinate 2 planes see remark 2 22 below this bivector can be interpreted as a skew symmetric linear operator theorem 5 the bicycle vector r i e the solution of 26 undergoes a net rigid rotation up to an o 3 error more precisely r l r 0 2 ar 0 o 3 27 where a rn rn is the skew symmetric area operator of given by ar 0 l 0 r 0 dt for r 0 rn for n 3 ar 0 l 0 r 0 dt a r 0 28 22 where a 1 2 l 0 dt is the area vector of thus in r 3 modulo an o 3 error the initial bike direction r 0 is rotated around the direction a through the angle a equal to the signed area of the projection of on a plane perpendicular to a proof the solution r t of the cauchy problem 26 is analytic in since so is the right hand side and thus can be expanded in a taylor series in starting with r t r t 0 r 1 t r 2 t 2 o 3 29 where r 1 t r t 0 r 2 t 1 2 2 r t 0 to find r t 0 r 1 t r 2 t we first set 0 in 26 to find r t 0 r 0 differentiating 26 by two times and setting 0 after each differentiation we get r 1 v v r 0 r 0 30 and r 2 v r 1 r 0 v r 0 r 1 31 from 30 r 1 r 0 r 0 c 32 and in particular r 1 l r 1 0 substituting 32 into 31 and integrating we find after simplification the sole surviving term other terms drop out as the derivatives of periodic functions r 2 l t 0 l 0 r 0 dt l 0 r 0 dt the last step using integration by parts for n 3 integrating the identity r 0 r 0 r 0 over a period and using integration by parts one obtains the stated formula remark 2 21 theorem 5 reveals an interesting behaviour of the bicycle equa tion in r 3 for large bike length on the one hand the bicycle vector field on s 2 given by equation 26 is maximally hyperbolic in the sense that the two in stantaneous equilibria at r v v are antipodal nodes on the r sphere one stable at v v the other unstable at v v on the other hand the time l map r 0 7 r l of this vector field i e the monodromy map is maximally elliptic in the sense that it is o 3 close to a rigid rotation with antipodal pair of elliptic fixed points 23 remark 2 22 the entries aij aji are the signed areas of the projections of onto the ijth planes so a is the area bivector of the curve for n 2 a 0 a a 0 where a is the signed area of reproducing the planimeter formula 1 remark 2 23 the classical literature on the hatchet planimeter contains a series in the negative powers of the length of the planimeter of its turning angle see e g 30 this makes it possible to estimate the error in measuring the area effectively it should be possible to obtain a similar power expansion in the multi dimensional setting we do not dwell on it here 2 9 a bird s eye view of the hatchet planimeter the results of the last two subsections lead to a new intuitive understanding of the hatchet planimeter formula 1 which we describe in this subsection loosely speaking the angle by which the planimeter rotates is approximated by the solid angle of a certain cone as explained next we consider a planar curve r 2 of small diameter diam o area a o 2 and fixed bicycle length 1 this assumption is equivalent to taking a long bike of size 1 for a fixed with so scaled the hatchet planimeter formula 1 expressing the area a bounded by in terms of the rotation angle of the planimeter becomes a o 3 33 we now lift our point of view above by considering the plane r 2 contain ing as the horizonal plane z 0 in r 3 the monodromy of then becomes a mo bius transformation m s 2 s 2 commuting with the reflection about the horizontal plane and conjugate to a rigid rotation about a vertical axis with a pair of fixed points symmetrically situated on opposite sides of the horizontal equator s 1 s 2 consider the closed rear track corresponding to one of those fixed point see figure 13 a let us parallel transport every bike segment rf tangent to by moving the tangency point r to a chosen point o the translated segments form a cone k with vertex at o and the translated endpoints f form a curve s on the unit sphere s 2 centered at o enclosing a spherical area equal to the solid angle subtended by k at o see figure 13 b the berry s phase formula corollary 2 19 states that m the monodromy of is conjugate to a rigid rotation of s 2 by the angle note that l 0 in equation 25 for a planar with an elliptic m furthermore theorem 5 states that m is o 3 close to a rigid rotation combining the last two statements we conclude that the rotation angle of the planimeter in formula 33 is o 3 close to the solid angle in other words formula 33 is equivalent to the statement a o 3 34 24 figure 13 a diam o diam o 2 b is o 2 close to s c as descreases to 1 becomes indistinguishable from a point and thus s looks indistinguishable from illustrating 34 formula 34 suggests a bird s eye view interpretation of the planimater formula 33 a bird standing at a point o at height 1 above a planar curve of diameter o estimates its area a with o 3 accuracy by the solid angle subtended at o by the o 2 close curve s to justify the o 2 closeness of and s we argue a follows first we observe that diam o 2 as figure 13 a illustrates indeed the tangent segments rf to form angles 2 o with the plane of and thus v r r v cos 2 o o 2 since v o when constructing s we therefore moved each point f by o 2 which shows that s and are o 2 close to each other this now implies 34 as follows first projecting s onto the horizontal plane the area of the resulting planar region is o 3 close to the spherical area enclosed by s since the projected curve is o 2 close to and both have length o their areas differ by o 3 this explains equation 34 2 10 bicycling and hyperbolic rolling the main purpose of this section is to elaborate on the equivalence mentioned before remark 2 12 the bicycle equation 4 for r 1 also describes the rolling without sliding and twisting of the hyperbolic n ball on the euclidean n space rn a precise statement is given in theorem 6 below we precede this statement by a discussion of rolling of the euclidean sphere we feel that this material is not common knowledge and not easy to gather from the literature so we begin with an elementary exposition of rolling a ball on the plane before moving on to the rolling of hyperbolic n space on rn for a more abstract intrinsic treatment of rolling we recommend 11 section 4 4 as well as 10 for n 2 the material here is closely related to the stargazing interpretation of the bicycling equation 4 as it appears in section 3 of 22 consider a rubber ball lying on top of the flat rough surface of a table so that the ball can roll on the table but not slide that is as the ball moves at 25 each moment the point of the ball in contact with the table has zero velocity we paint a straight line segment on the table position the ball at one end of and roll it along until it reaches the other end as we do so the paint which is still wet marks a curve on the surface of the ball since we are rolling without sliding and have the same length further more if we are careful not to spin the ball about the vertical axis through its contact point with the table as it rolls is in fact a geodesic segment an arc of a great circle note also that as a result of the rolling the ball is translated along and rotated about the horizontal axis passing through the center of the ball and perpendicular to the direction of note also that due to the no spin condition a parallel field of vectors along leaves a track of corresponding vectors on which form a parallel field with respect to parallel transport on the sphere figure 14 a ball rolling without slipping and twisting we can of course roll the ball along a more general curve drawn on the table in which case the no slide and no spin conditions also called no slip and no twist imply that the curve traced on the ball has the same length and the same geodesic curvature as at the corresponding points the change of orientation of the ball as a result of the rolling is an element g so 3 called the rolling monodromy of for example if is a circle of radius r then is an arc of a circle of latitude on the sphere of length 2 r and geodesic curvature 1 r from which one can easily determine as well as g given the radius of the rolling ball let us now formulate the above more precisely and generally consider the n sphere of radius sn x 1 xn 1 r n 1 x 1 2 xn 1 2 2 rolling along a smoothly parametrized curve t in rn xn 1 0 rn 1 the rolling motion is given by a time dependent family of rigid motions t rn 1 rn 1 so that t sn is positioned in the upper half space xn 1 0 tangent to rn at t then t can be written as t x g t x t en 1 g 0 i 26 where g t son 1 iso sn is the rolling monodromy describing the rotation of the moving sphere at time t with respect to its initial position at t 0 let t t 1 t g t 1 en 1 sn the body curve of contact points the space derivative of t is a linear isometry t t sn t t r n given by g t satisfying the following two rolling conditions 1 no slip g t t t 2 no twist if is a vector field tangent to sn and parallel along then g t t is parallel along remark 2 24 it can be easily shown that the no slip condition 1 is equivalent to the vanishing of the killing field v t t t 1 at t the velocity of the contact point of the rolling body with rn is equal to zero thus for n 2 v t is the velocity vector field of rotations about an instantaneous axis passing through the contact point t the angular velocity axis furthermore for n 2 the no twist condition 2 is equivalent to the instantaneous rotation axis lying in r 2 and perpendicular to it is also equivalent to the equality of the geodesic curvatures of and at the corresponding points proposition 2 25 the monodromy g t son 1 of rolling sn along a parametrized curve t in rn satisfies g 1 0 n v vt 0 g g 0 i v 35 proof for the sake of brevity we omit the explicit t dependence writing g g t etc let a g g 1 son 1 the statement is then that the no slip and no twist conditions are equivalent to 1 aen 1 and 2 if en 1 then a 0 mod en 1 i e a is a multiple of en 1 we now prove 1 and 2 1 g en 1 implies 0 g g aen 1 g hence the no slip condition g is equivalent to aen 1 2 suppose is parallel along then 0 mod hence g 0 mod en 1 let g then g g a g a mod en 1 but en 1 hence en 1 and a it follows that if a has the form given in formula 35 then a 0 hence 0 i e is parallel conversely given a vector 0 en 1 tangent to rn at t 0 we let 0 g t 0 1 0 and extend it to a parallel vector field along assuming the no twist condition g is parallel as before it implies that 0 a mod en 1 in particular a t 0 0 0 mod en 1 as claimed 27 next recall from section 2 5 the hyperboloid model for hyperbolic n space of curvature 1 2 hn x r n 1 x x 2 xn 1 0 given a curve in rn xn 1 0 rn 1 a rolling of hn along consists of a t dependent family of rigid motions t rn 1 rn 1 orientation preserving isometries so that t hn is positioned in the upper half space xn 1 0 tangent to rn at t such t can be written as t x g t x t en 1 g 0 i where g t son 1 iso hn is the rolling monodromy describing the rotation of the moving hyperbolic n space at time t with respect to its initial position at t 0 furthermore g t is required to satisfy the same no slip and no twist conditions that were given in the case of rolling sn theorem 6 the monodromy g t son 1 of rolling hn along a parametrized curve t in rn satisfies g 1 0 n v vt 0 g g 0 i v 36 thus g t coincides with the bicycling monodromy of see theorem 3 the proof is almost identical to the above proof of proposition 2 25 and is omitted remark 2 26 embedding rn and hn in r n 1 facilitates intuition and calcula tions but is not essential since the no slip and no twist conditions are intrinsic these conditions thus apply to the rolling of hn along an arbitrary riemannian n manifold m defining a principal son 1 connection on m whose associated parallel transport can be interpreted as either the monodromy of rolling hn along m or the monodromy of bicycling on m 3 bicycle correspondence the filament equation and integrable systems 3 1 bicycle correspondence we start by recalling the definition of the bicycle correspondence definition 3 1 let 0 two smoothly parameterized curves 1 2 in rn are in bicycle correspondence if for all t i the connecting segment 1 t 2 t has a fixed length and ii the midpoint curve 1 t 2 t 2 is tangent to the connecting segment 28 see figure 3 of the introduction condition ii can be expressed by the following formula 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 0 37 here is a useful reformulation lemma 3 2 two parameterized curves 1 2 in rn are in bicycle correspon dence for some if and only if for all t the vector 2 t is the reflection of 1 t about the connecting line segment 1 t 2 t followed by parallel transla tion from 1 t to 2 t 2 t 1 t 2 1 t r t r t where r t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 38 figure 15 bicycle correspondence proof condition i of definition 3 1 is equivalent to the equality of the orthog onal projections of 1 t and 2 t onto r t condition ii by formula 37 is then that the orthogonal components sum up to 0 corollary 3 3 bicycle correspondence is arc length preserving proof this follows from lemma 3 2 and the fact that reflection and parallel translation are isometries the main result of this section is that bicycle correspondence preserves the bicycle monodromy theorem 7 this result is not new in 57 it is established for the discrete version of the bicycle correspondence defined for polygons in rn and in the smooth case it follows by taking limit here we give a different proof whose idea is to conjugate the bicycle monodromies along the corresponding curves using darboux butterflies which we now introduce definition 3 4 a darboux butterfly in rn is the result of folding a paral lelogram about one of its diagonals more precisely it is an ordered quadruple abcd of 4 distinct points in rn such that d is the reflection of the point a b c about the line ac remark 3 5 the above definition applies also to degenerate butterflies abcd where one or two pairs of points coincide as long as a 6 c or b 6 d so one can apply the definition or the equivalent one a is the reflection of b c d about bd 29 figure 16 a the definition of a darboux butterfly b degenerate butterflies here are some immediate consequences of definition 3 4 lemma 3 6 i a darboux butterfly is a planar quadrilateral ii the butterfly property is invariant under cyclic permutation and order reversing of its vertices namely if abcd is a darboux butterfly then so are bcda and dcba iii any triple of points abc in rn with a 6 c can be completed uniquely to a darboux butterfly abcd possibly degenerate see remark 3 5 another property of darboux butterflies is the following infinitesimal version of the butterfly lemma of 57 to formulate it we first define for a given segment uv in rn the glide reflection guv rn rn as the composition of the reflection about the line through uv followed by parallel translation through the vector v u for example in figure 15 2 t is the image of 1 t under g 1 t 2 t lemma 3 7 for any darboux butterfly abcd one has gda gcd gbc gab id proof the linear part of the isometry in question is the composition of four reflections decompose rn into the direct sum of the plane of the butterfly translated to the origin and its orthogonal complement in the orthogonal complement each reflection acts by 1 hence the composition of the four re flections acts trivially in the plane of the butterfly the product of the reflections about two suc cessive edges is a rotation by twice the angle between the edges the product of reflections about the next pair of successive edges is then a rotation by the same angle in opposite direction it follows that the linear part of the isometry in question is trivial thus it is a parallel translation but a is a fixed point hence it is the identity 30 the next statement is a version of the bianchi permutability 48 proved in 57 for a polygonal version of the bicycle correspondence proposition 3 8 let 1 2 0 with 1 6 2 and let a t b t c t be three parameterized curves in rn such that a b and b c are in 1 and 2 bicycle correspondences respectively complete a t b t c t to a darboux butterfly a t b t c t d t the non degeneracy assumption 1 6 2 assures that a t 6 c t so lemma 3 6 iii applies then a d and c d are in 2 and 1 bicycle correspondence respectively figure 17 bianchi permutability proof by lemma 3 2 a gbab c gbcb and we need to show that d gada gcdc now a d 2 and c d 1 imply the non stretching condition the orthogonal projections of d onto ad and cd coincide with the orthogonal projections of a and c onto ad and cd respectively if the butterfly is non collinear then ad cd are linearly independent hence d is determined uniquely by the non stretching condition on the other hand using lemma 3 7 we have gada gadgbab gcdgbcb gcdc and this vector clearly satisfies the non stretching condition hence d gada gcdc for a collinear butterfly the result follows by continuity from the non colinear case the next result shows that the flows of the bicycle equation along curves in bicycle correspondence are conjugated lemma 3 9 let 1 2 be two parameterized curves in rn in 2 bicycle cor respondence for each 6 let t sn 1 sn 1 be the map r 1 7 r 2 defined by completing 1 t 2 r 1 1 t 2 t to a darboux butterfly 1 t 2 r 1 1 t 2 t 2 t 2 r 2 see figure 18 then t is a mo bius transformation possibly orientation reversing conjugating the bicycle flows along 1 2 that is if r 1 t satisfies r 1 v 1 v 1 r 1 r 1 then r 2 t t r 1 t satisfies r 2 v 2 v 2 r 2 r 2 where v 1 1 v 2 2 31 figure 18 two closed curves in 2 bicycle correspondence with the darboux butterfly conjugating their bicycle flows proof if r 1 t solves the bicycle equation along 1 then 1 2 r 1 is in 2 bicycle correspondence with 1 by bianchi permutability proposition 3 8 2 2 r 2 is in 2 bicycle correspondence with 2 hence r 2 t is a solution to the bicycle equation along 2 the proof that t is a mo bius transformation was given in the proof of theorem 1 of 57 here we present an alternative proof for n 2 i e t s 1 s 1 where s 1 c we denote the image of z by w where z w 1 see figure 19 expanding 2 2 w 2 z 2 2 2 we obtain re w z z 0 39 geometrically it is clear that given any z 6 1 on the unit circle there are precisely two solutions w to 39 and that one of them is w z correspond ing to the parallelogram rather than the butterfly the other algebraically obvious solution is given simply by w z z 0 or w z z the last formula shows that z 7 w is a reflection z 7 z followed by a mo bius transformation the projectivizaton of gl 2 r as claimed theorem 7 if 1 2 are two closed curves in rn in 2 bicycle correspondence then for all 0 their bicycle monodromies are conjugate elements of so n 1 proof for 6 this follows from the last lemma by continuity it then follows also for 32 figure 19 proving that is a mo bius transformation this theorem provides integrals of the bicycle correspondence a conjugacy invariant function on the mo bius group considered as a function of is such an integral individual integrals can be obtained by expanding such a function in a series in we call such integrals of the bicycle correspondence the monodromy integrals for a discussion of symplectic properties and complete integrability of the bicycle correspondence see 58 3 2 the bicycle equation and the filament equation in this subsection we describe a relation between the bicycle equation 4 in r 3 and the filament equation also called the localized induction equation among several other names the later is an evolution equation on arc length parame terized curves t in r 3 where prime denotes time derivative and dot stands for derivative with respect to arclength t along this unconventional choice is forced by the prior role of t in this paper in other words the point t moves in the binormal direction with velocity equal to the curvature t this equation provides a simplified model of the the motion of a vortex line in ideal fluid here we are concerned with closed curves this infinite dimensional system is completely integrable in the following sense see 35 34 it is a hamiltonian system with respect to the so called marsden weinstein symplectic structure on the space of arc length parameter ized curves the hamiltonian function being the perimeter of the curve we do not use this symplectic structure in the present paper so we simply refer to 44 and 3 p 326 and p 332 for its definition and main properties the filament equation has a hierarchy of poisson commuting integrals f 1 f 2 that starts with 1 dt dt 2 dt 2 dt 2 2 2 1 4 4 dt 40 where as before is the torsion and is the curvature of one also has a hierarchy of vector fields x 0 x 1 x 2 along that starts with v b 2 2 v n b 2 v 2 n 2 3 2 b 41 33 where as before v n b is the frenet frame along for each i 1 xi defines a hamiltonian vector field on the space of arc length parameterized curves in r 3 whose hamiltonian with respect to the marsden weinstein structure is fi the vector fields xi satisfy the relations x i v xi 1 i 0 1 2 42 following 34 23 consider the generating function x j 0 jxj where is a formal parameter then the relations 42 can be compactly encoded in the equation x v x v 43 we impose an additional normalization condition x x 1 the vector fields xi are then uniquely defined by equation 43 and x 0 v see 34 remark 3 10 the series x j 0 jxj is a formal periodic solution of the differential equation 43 on the sphere we do not claim that it converges and represents a genuine periodic solution for any 6 0 now let us compare equation 43 with the bicycle equation 11 in r 3 r v r r r r 1 v 44 each of the right hand sides of the last two displayed equations defines a time dependent vector field on s 2 determined by v t t for equation 43 it is the velocity field of rotations about the axis rv with angular velocity v proposition 3 11 the vector field on the right hand side of equation 43 is obtained from that on the right hand side of equation 44 by an anti clockwise rotation by 90 degrees the proof is straightforward from the equations figure 20 the vector field of the filament equation 43 right is obtained from that of the bicycle equation 44 left by a 900 anticlockwise rotation the fixed points north and south poles of both vector fields are in the direction of v consequently if we use a stereographic projection to put a complex coor dinate on s 2 the resulting riccati equations in an inertial frame differ by 34 multiplication of their right hand sides by i z 1 2 q 2 v 1 z q z 2 bicycle w i 2 q 2 v 1 w q w 2 filament where v v 1 v 2 v 3 q v 2 iv 3 in other words the filament equation 43 is the equation of a bicycle with imaginary length i we also have a filament analog of proposition 2 9 we project the curve x t stereographically from v the south pole in figure 20 on the n b plane equipped with complex coordinate w x 2 ix 3 1 x 1 where x x 1 v x 2 n x 3 b and express 43 as a differential equation on w proposition 3 12 equation 43 is equivalent to the riccati equation w i 1 w 2 1 w 2 45 the proof is a direct calculation that we do not reproduce here remark 3 13 equation 43 is a particular case of the equation x t x where is a time dependent skew symmetric 3 3 matrix studied in 37 its monodromy is the orthogonal transformation that relates the initial and termi nal unit tangent vectors of the spherical curve b t whose geodesic curvature in our case equals t 1 t comparing the filament riccati equation 45 to the bicycle ricatti equation 15 z 1 i z 2 1 z 2 46 we see that they are almost the same corollary 3 14 the filament riccati equation 45 is obtained from the bicycle ricatti equation 46 by replacing the variable z with w and with i we now come to the main point of this section let us describe first the idea before proceeding to the technical details let us fix a closed smooth curve in r 3 the last corollary suggests a relation between the filament integrals fi of equation 40 and the bicycle equation 44 it is natural to seek this relation by looking at the conjugacy class of the bicycle monodromy m psl 2 c the later has generically two fixed points in s 2 one stable and one unstable and the derivative at one of them determines the conjugacy class of m the derivatives are the reciprocal of each other and each is the 35 square of the corresponding eigenvalue of a matrix in sl 2 c representing m we denote by for small enough the derivative of m at the unstable fixed point we will show that ln has a taylor series at 0 i e is infinitely differentiable we do not claim analyticity the taylor coefficients of ln at 0 are the monodromy integrals of they share with fi the property of being invariant under bicycle correspondence by linearizing the riccati bicycle equation 46 around the unstable periodic solution we are able to express the monodromy integrals like the filament invariants fi as integrals along of certain differential polynomials in we can then check that the first few monodromy integrals coincide with the filament invariants fi up to index shift and multiplicative constants this suggests a conjectured relation between the filament integrals and the monodromy invariants the following proposition is the main technical tool for implementing the above plan proposition 3 15 consider a closed smooth curve in r 3 then there ex ists 0 0 such that for all 0 0 the associated ricatti equation 46 has a unique unstable periodic solution z t tending uniformly with all its derivatives to the zero function as 0 furthermore extended to 0 via z t 0 0 z t is infinitely differentiable in r 0 0 changed cor 8 to thm 8 and expanded its statement at the request of referee 2 we defer the proof of this proposition to appendix b theorem 8 let be a closed smooth curve in r 3 and denote by c the derivative of the bicycle monodromy at its unstable fixed point for small enough as per proposition 3 15 then ln extends to an infinitely dif ferentiable function in 0 0 for some 0 0 the taylor coefficients at 0 i e the numbers in 1 n n 0 ln n 0 are invariants of the bicycle correspondence and can be determined recursively as integrals along of polynomials in and their derivatives proof we linearize equation 46 at the unstable periodic solution z t writ ing this linearization in the form u u 1 i z integrating both sides over a period and multiplying the result by gives ln 1 i z dt 47 by proposition 3 15 this expression is c in 0 0 for some 0 0 to compute the derivatives of the last equation with respect to at 0 we need to calculate the derivatives zn 1 n n 0 z n 0 36 to find zn we first multiply the bicycle riccati equation 46 by obtaining z z f where f i z 2 1 z 2 48 then differentiate n times at 0 an operation justified by proposition 3 15 obtaining after some manipulation the recursion relation zn z n 1 1 n 1 n 1 0 f equivalently and perhaps easier for calculations one expands z as a formal power series in z z 0 z 1 2 z 2 substitutes in 48 and equates the terms having the same degree in in this way one consecutively finds z 0 0 z 1 2 z 2 2 i 2 z 3 2 3 8 2 2 i 2 and so on and then i 0 1 dt i 1 i dt i 2 1 2 2 dt i 3 i 2 2 dt i 4 2 2 2 2 4 8 dt 49 and so on we make two observations 1 the integrals in are real for even n and imaginary for odd n 2 up to multiplicative constants and index shift the integrals 49 coincide with the integrals 40 of the filament equation we will not attempt to justify these observations formally here and leave their validity as conjectures to be studied in future work remark 3 16 one can easily verify these observations by explicit calculation for the first several cases for example we can see immediately from formulas 40 and 49 that i 0 f 1 i 1 if 2 i 2 1 2 f 3 i 3 i 2 f 4 as for i 4 we make use of the presence of total derivatives i 4 1 2 f 5 1 2 2 dt 1 2 d dt dt 0 37 concluding that i 4 1 2 f 5 we have tested in a similar fashion observations 1 and 2 for at least ten additional terms a heuristic argument for observation 1 is as follows corollary 3 14 suggests a laurent expansion ln in n in the complex plane for imaginary i e i the monodromy is an orthogonal transformation since the linear system 43 has antisymmetric coefficient matrix hence ln is imaginary and ln i nin k is real thus in is real for even n imaginary for odd n remark 3 17 that the bicycle correspondence preserves the integrals 40 of the filament equation is proved in 58 3 3 wegner s curves buckled rings and solitons of the planar filament equation in this section we show that the zindler curves constructed by wegner in 61 66 are buckled rings the latter are also solitons of the planar filament equation specified later in this section see 34 as we mentioned in the introduction a planar bernoulli elastica is an extremum of the total squared curvature bending energy among curves of fixed length that is if t is an arc length parameterized curve with curvature t one is looking for extrema of 2 t dt subject to the constraint that the perimeter is fixed the extremal curves satisfy the euler lagrange equation 1 2 3 0 where is a lagrange multiplier see e g 52 a buckled ring is an extremum of the total squared curvature functional subject to two constraints both the perimeter and the area are being fixed buckled rings have been extensively studied starting with le vy 41 halphen 28 and greenhill 24 in the 19 th century see 1 17 for recent works the area constraint gives rise to a second lagrange multiplier in the euler lagrange equation of a buckled ring 1 2 3 50 let us turn attention to wegner s curves which come in two flavors the linear non closed and the circular closed ones the linear curves are the curves whose curvature is proportional to the distance to the x axis they are the graphs y f x in cartesian coordinates where f satisfies the differential equation 1 1 f 2 x af 2 b 51 with parameters a b the circular curves are the curves whose curvature is proportional to the distance to the origin and are given by the graphs r r 38 in polar coordinates satisfying the differential equation 1 r 2 r 2 ar 2 b c r 2 52 with parameters a b c theorem 9 wegner s curves are buckled rings equation 50 holds for the linear wegner curves with 2 ab 0 and for the circular wegner curves with 8 ac 2 b 2 8 a proof consider the linear case first let x t y t be an arc length parameter ization of this curve t be its direction and t its curvature then x cos y sin 53 the left hand side of 51 is x and we rewrite this equation as x ay 2 b 54 we claim that 2 ay indeed differentiate the first equation of 53 and equation 54 sin x 2 ayy and use the second and third equations of 53 sin 2 ay sin implying the claim now using 2 ay equation 53 and 54 we find that 1 2 3 4 a 2 y ay 2 b 4 a 3 y 3 4 a 2 by 2 ab as needed the argument in the circular case is similar let r t t be the polar coordinates of the curve in an arc length parameterization and the angle between the tangent to the curve and the radial direction then r cos r sin 55 the left hand side of 52 is hence we can rewrite this equation as ar 2 b c r 2 56 we claim that 4 ar 2 2 b indeed from 55 and 56 we get sin r ar 3 br c r 39 hence r cos sin r 3 ar 2 b c r 2 thus 3 ar 2 b c r 2 ar 2 b c r 2 3 ar 2 b c r 2 4 ar 2 2 b as claimed now using 4 ar 2 2 b equation 55 and 56 we find 1 2 3 8 a 1 ar 4 br 2 c 1 2 4 ar 2 2 b 3 4 2 a b 3 4 abc 8 a b 2 4 ac r 2 2 b 2 4 ac 8 a as needed it is known that buckled rings are solitons of the planar filament equation let us review this material let t be a smooth planar arc length parameterized curve v n its frenet frame and its curvature the planar filament equation is the evolution equa tion 2 2 v n obtained from the vector field x 2 in the filament hierarchy 41 by restricting to planar curves with 0 the planar filament equation has infinitely many integrals of motion namely the odd numbered ones in the sequence 40 re stricting again to 0 see 36 the planar filament equation is equivalent to the modified korteweg de vries equation in the same way as the filament equation is equivalent to the non linear schro dinger equation 36 by solitons of the planar filament equation we mean the curves that evolve under this flow by isometries and a parameter shift the next proposition is not new see e g 34 we include its proof here for completeness proposition 3 18 the buckled rings are solitons of the planar filament equa tion proof a planar curve evolves by isometries if and only if its curvature remains unchanged let t be an arc length parameterized planar curve and t a vector field along defining its variation denote by the directional deriva tive of with respect to the change in due to parameter shift is d dt it follows that the soliton condition requiring to evolve under by isometries and parameter shift is equivalent to the condition that satisfies the equation 0 for some real constant now a straightforward calculation shows that for a general and n 2 v 57 40 sketch calculate 2 u n mod v where u so that uv it follows that n 2 u next calculate u v mod n hence u v from which equation 57 follows in our case 2 2 v n which implies again by a straightforward calcu lation that n d dt 1 2 3 v 0 the last equation means that the flow defined by on the space of parametrized curves is arc length preserving it follows from the last two displayed equations that the soliton condition on for the planar filament equation is d dt 1 2 3 0 or 1 2 3 that is the euler lagrange equation 50 we conclude that wegner s curves are solitons of the planar filament equa tion 4 case study multiple circles in this section we study some interesting and non trivial curves in bicycle cor respondence with a circle 4 1 definition of the curves k n denote by ns 1 the n fold circle parameterized by t 7 eit c 0 t 2 n recall that the monodromy of a closed parametrized planar curve is a conjugacy class of an element of psl 2 r these elements are divided into hyperbolic parabolic elliptic and trivial according to the number of fixed points in s 1 rp 1 2 1 0 respectively proposition 4 1 let 0 then the bicycle monodromy of ns 1 n 1 is hyperbolic for 1 parabolic for 1 elliptic for 1 except for the n 1 values k n 1 1 k n 2 k 1 2 n 1 for which the monodromy is trivial 41 figure 21 the curves k n the solid curves for 1 k n 5 and k n relatively prime each one is in bicycle correspondence with the unit circle the boundary of the grey disk their common back track is the dotted curve proof the monodromy of ns 1 is the n th power of the monodromy of the simple circle s 1 the latter is easily found by direct calculation to be hyper bolic for 0 1 parabolic for 1 and elliptic for 1 the n th power of hyperbolic or parabolic element is hyperbolic or parabolic respectively an elliptic element is conjugate to a rotation by some angle hence its n th power is trivial if and only if is a multiple of 2 n on the other hand by corollary 2 19 is the solid angle at the vertex of a right cone over s 1 with generator of length a simple calculation shows that this solid angle is 2 1 1 1 2 thus the monodromy of ns 1 is trivial if and only if 2 1 1 1 2 2 m n for some m z or 1 1 k n 2 k 1 2 n 1 definition 4 2 for each n 2 and 1 k n 1 let k n t be the unique closed plane curve in 2 k n bicycle correspondence with ns 1 such that k n 0 1 2 k n c where k n 1 1 k n 2 see figure 21 this class of curves is mentioned in section 8 4 of 65 remark 4 3 since the k n monodromy of ns 1 is trivial we have in fact a whole circle worth of planar closed curves in 2 k n bicycle correspondence 42 with ns 1 by the obvious rotational symmetry of the bicycle equation for ns 1 they are all obtained from k n by rotation about the origin and shift reparametrization we next find an explicit arclength parametrization of k n by solving the bicycle equation for s 1 proposition 4 4 one has k n t e it 1 2 ei t 58 where t is defined as a continuous function by tan 2 a tan bt 2 a n k n k 2 1 b k n 0 0 59 proof let be the unit circle in r 2 c parameterized by t eit let be the not necessarily closed parameterized plane curve in 2 bicycle corre spondence with satisfying 0 1 2 by definition t t 2 r t where r t is the solution to equation 4 with r 0 1 c taking t eit r ei in equation 4 gives cos t changing to t gives t e it 1 2 ei t where t satisfies 1 cos 0 0 changing again to p tan 2 gives p 1 2 p 2 1 1 p 0 0 a constant coefficient riccati equation whose solution for 1 is p a tan bt 2 a 1 1 b 1 1 2 1 60 for k n 1 1 k n 2 we obtain the stated formulas remark 4 5 there are expressions similar to 60 for with 0 1 which we do not really use for 0 1 p a tanh bt 2 a 1 1 b 1 2 1 for 1 we have p 1 so that p t t if k n have a common divisor d 1 then k n is a d fold cover of k n where k k d n n d so all properties of k n can be easily deduced from those of k n we will thus restrict attention henceforth to k n with relatively prime k n corollary 4 6 for all n 2 and 1 k n 1 43 1 k n and ns 1 have the same length 2 n and the same bicycle monodromy for all 0 as in proposition 4 1 2 k n admits a dk symmetry the symmetries of a regular k gon that is k n t 2 n k e 2 in k k n t k n t k n t 61 for all t r proof the first statement follows from corollary 3 3 and theorem 7 and the second from equations 58 and 59 4 2 k n as zindler curves let t be an arc length parameterized closed immersed zindler curve of length l that is there is a number 0 1 called a rotation number of such that the chord length t l t corresponding to a fixed length l of an arc is a positive constant and the velocity of the midpoint t l t 2 is parallel to t l t note that is a rotation number if and only if so is 1 and that a circle is zindler for all rotation numbers 0 1 in this subsection we show that most k n are zindler and determine their associated rotation numbers theorem 10 the proof although elementary is somewhat technical so we give here the main idea by construction each k n is in bicycle correspondence with ns 1 hence its bicycle monodromy is hyperbolic for 0 1 and parabolic for 1 it follows that for all 1 there is a planar closed curve k n in 2 bicycle correspondence with k n unique up to reflection about one of the symmetry axes of k n by bianchi permutability and circular symmetry each k n is a rigid rotation of k n about the origin by some dependent angle by the dk symmetry of k n corollary 4 6 if is a multiple of 2 k then k n coincides with k n up to shift reparametrization so that k n is zindler thus the proof of the zindler property of k n and the calculation of the associated rotation numbers reduces to the calculation of as a function of 0 1 this is done in lemma 4 7 and is the main ingredient in the proof of theorem 10 in fact it is more convenient to write sin 2 and calculate as a function of 0 theorem 10 let k n be a relatively prime pair of positive integers then k n is a zindler curve if and only if 1 k n 2 with n k 1 rotation numbers 0 1 given by the equation n tan k k tan n 62 including 1 2 when both n and k are odd proof for each 0 0 and t r define 44 figure 22 the notation of the proof of theorem 10 t eit t ei t where sin 2 0 1 t the not necessarily closed 2 bicycle transform of t with 0 1 2 c t the completion of t t t to the darboux butterfly t t t t note that is in 2 bicycle correspondence with and so by bianchi permutability proposition 3 8 is in 2 bicycle correspondence with as well as 2 bicycle correspondence with it follows see remark 4 3 that there exist 0 such that t e i t 63 for all t see figure 22 lemma 4 7 for 1 and in equation 63 satisfy tan b 2 b tan 2 b 1 1 2 it follows that is a monotonically increasing function of varying from 0 to 1 b 1 as varies from 0 to proof by definition we have t e it 1 2 ei t where t is given by equation 60 and t e it ei 2 ei t for some function t substituting the last two equations in 63 we get ei 2 ei t ei 2 ei t 45 both sides of the last equation are parameterized arcs of circles of radius 2 hence their centers and angular parameter must coincide giving t t note that strictly speaking these equations hold only modulo 2 but by the continuous dependence of and on and the initial conditions 0 0 0 0 they hold as stated this gives the stated second formula and 0 hence tan 0 2 tan 2 2 tan 2 tan 2 1 tan 2 tan 2 using equation 60 we get from the last equation tan 0 2 a tan b 2 tan 2 1 a tan b 2 tan 2 a 1 1 64 next we look at the darboux butterfly abcd where a 0 1 b 0 ei c 0 e i 2 ei 0 and d 0 1 2 figure 23 the darboux butterfly abcd let c be the reflection of c about bd then abc d is a parallelogram in which dbc bda 0 2 ad 2 ab 2 and abd 2 2 applying the sine law to 4 dab we get sin 2 2 2 sin 2 using sin 2 and solving the last equation for tan we get tan 0 2 tan tan 2 1 tan 2 2 substituting this into the left hand side of 64 and simplifying we obtain the stated formula tan b 2 b tan 2 it follows immediately from this formula that 1 u 2 2 1 b 2 u 2 46 where u tan 2 2 hence as well as is monotonically increasing in as stated we continue with the proof of theorem 10 setting k n 1 1 k n 2 in lemma 4 7 we have b k n so that n tan k n 2 k tan 2 65 and increases monotonically from 0 to n k k as varies from 0 to now the zindler condition on k n is that it is in the bicycle correspondence with itself up to shift reparametrization due to the dk symmetry see corol lary 4 6 this means that in equation 63 should be an integer multiple of 2 k as varies from 0 to increases monotonically from 0 to n k k so there are exactly n k 2 values 0 for which is an integer multi ple of 2 k for each such k n is zindler with chord length 2 2 sin 2 giving rise to a pair of rotation numbers 1 0 1 except if 1 2 which occurs if and only if and n k is even i e k n are both odd it follows that k n is zindler if and only if 1 k n 2 with a total of n k 1 rotation numbers 0 1 as stated to determine the associated rotation numbers let be a value for which 2 m k m 1 2 n k 2 66 an associated rotation number 0 1 satisfies k n t k n t 2 n 67 for all t since k n are relatively prime there exists an integer n such that nn 1 mod k let m mn then 2 m k 2 m n k mod 2 68 now we calculate k n t e i 2 m k k n t by 63 66 e i 2 m n k k n t by 68 k n t 2 m n k by 61 69 k n t 2 n by 67 for all t the last equality is equivalent to 2 m n k 2 n mod 2 n implying k n 2 k mod 70 47 next applying 2 k n bicycling correspondence to equation 67 gives t t 2 n or ei t ei t 2 n it follows that 2 n mod 2 or 2 n mod 71 substituting equations 70 and 71 in equation 65 we see that satisfies equation 62 we have shown so far that k n has n k 1 rotation numbers and that they all satisfy equation 62 to complete the proof of theorem 10 it is thus sufficient to show that equation 62 has exactly n k 1 solutions 0 1 including 1 2 when k n are both odd lemma 4 8 for any pair of integers k n with 1 k n equation 62 n tan k k tan n has n k 1 solutions in 0 1 including 1 2 when both n and k are odd proof clearly is a solution if and only if 1 n arctan n k tan k mod 1 n for each j z let ij j k 1 2 k j k 1 2 k r the open interval of length 1 k centered at j k and define fj ij r by fj 1 n arctan n k tan k j n ij j z one can verify that fj extends smoothly to ij and that the extensions at adja cent intervals coincide at the shared endpoints combining to define a smooth strictly increasing function f r r satisfying i f 0 0 ii f 1 k n and iii 0 f 1 for all r with f 1 only at isolated points in fact f 1 precisely at 0 mod 1 k see figure 24 by construction the solutions of equation 62 are given by f mod 1 n it now follows easily from the above 3 properties of f that this equation has exactly n k 1 solutions in the interval 0 1 this concludes the proof of theorem 10 48 figure 24 the function f of the proof of lemma 4 8 remark 4 9 i here is a table of the approximate rotation numbers 0 1 2 of k n for relatively prime pairs k n with 1 k n 2 and n 7 k n 1 3 0 5 1 4 0 37 1 5 0 29 0 5 2 5 0 31 3 5 0 5 1 6 0 24

quadratic polynomials obtained from multiple angle trigonometric identi 49 ties here are all such cases with 6 1 2 k n tan 2 1 4 5 1 5 5 3 2 5 2 21 7 1 6 21 4 21 3 1 7 7 2 7 3 for higher values of k n the numbers tan 2 are roots of higher degree polynomials iv for k 1 equation 62 is n tan tan n this is equation 14 of theorem 7 of 56 describing the rotation numbers for which the simple unit circle can be infinitesimally deformed in the class of planar zindler curves with rotation number the same equation appeared in a study of billiards and of a flotation problem 25 26 see 16 for number theoretic properties of its solutions a discrete version of the equation is proposed in 56 see 14 15 for its solutions 4 3 spherical curves in bicycle correspondence with k n as we have seen in the previous subsection all curves in 2 bicycle correspon dence with k n for 1 are rotations of k n about the origin for a generic value of 1 i e for 6 k n 1 k n the monodromy of k n is elliptic and thus there are two space curves in 2 bicycle correspondence with k n related by reflection about the xy plane figure 25 the spherical curve proposition 4 10 let 1 and let k n be a curve in r 3 in 2 bicycle correspondence with k n then k n is either planar contained in the xy plane in which case k n for some 1 k n or it is a spherical curve with the center of the sphere on the z axis 50 proof we define for every 0 1 and t r t eit 0 c r r 3 lower thin circle in figure 25 t e it 2 2 1 upper thin circle t the not necessarily closed curve in the xy plane in 2 bicycle correspondence with such that 0 1 2 0 0 r 3 lower thick planar curve t the completion of t t t to the darboux butterfly t t t t upper thick space curve note that is in 2 bicycle correspondence with and in 2 bicycle cor respondence with and hence by bianchi permutability is in 2 bicycle correspondence with and in 2 bicycle correspondence with since is related to by euclidean translation along the z axis and reparametrization it is enough to show that any curve not necessarily closed in 2 bicycle corre spondence with lies either in the xy plane or on some sphere centered on the z axis at this junction we can explicitly solve the bicycle equation as described in section 2 4 this is an equation with constant coefficients we present a more geometrical argument here the desired property is invariant with respect to rotations about the z axis so it can be shown in a frame rotating about the z axis with angular velocity 1 figure 26 the proof of proposition 4 10 in this frame the front wheel t is stationary say at a 1 0 0 so the rear wheel traces some curve on the 2 sphere s of radius centered at a we 51 claim that this curve is a circle shown as a dotted chord of s in figure 26 whose axis the line through its center perpendicular to the plane of the circle intersects the z axis at some point c or else is parallel to the z axis in which case the curve is the equatorial circle the intersection of s with the xy plane indeed the bicycle equation 4 in a rotating frame the frenet serret frame is autonomous i e defines a time independent conformal vector field on s whose flow is a 1 parameter elliptic subgroup of the mo bius group of s here we use the fact that 1 its trajectories are planar circles with two fixed points the vertices of the two right circular cones over with generator of length one of them b is shown in figure 26 it follows that the curve in 2 bicycle correspondence with generated by this rear track shown as a dotted chord of s 2 in figure 26 is a circle on the sphere s 2 of radius 2 centered at a as well as a circle on the sphere centered at c and passing through a a bicycle correspondence as a darboux trans formation in this appendix we relate the bicycle correspondence for curves in r 3 with darboux transformations of a certain spectral problem we use the stp construction after sym tafel and pohlmeyer associating with each solution of the akns system a family of curves in su 2 r 3 we note that only theorem 12 of this section is new the preliminary material as well as related motivation and details can be found in 48 the curves that we are dealing with in this subsection are not necessarily closed we begin with a description of the akns system following 4 given a complex valued function q t of a real variable t we define the linear system t q i a 72 where t is a complex 2 2 matrix valued function of two real variables t t and q 0 q q 0 q q t a 1 2 0 0 1 2 the variable is called the spectral parameter and q is the potential observe that q i a is su 2 valued hence if we assume as we shall do henceforth that 0 su 2 for all r then t su 2 for all t as well given a solution t to 72 we define following 54 the associated stp curves t in su 2 by 73 in what follows we use the slightly modified standard killing form on su 2 x 2 2 tr x 2 52 proposition a 1 for each the map t 7 t defines an arclength param eterized curve in su 2 i e t 1 with the curvature and torsion functions given in terms of q t by 2 q im qt q 74 conversely given a curve c in su 2 with curvature and torsion the akns system associated with q 2 ei has a family of stp curves with curvature and torsion so that 0 is congruent to c in fact by adjusting the initial condition 0 in equation 72 one can have 0 actually coincide with c proof a simple calculation shows that implies t ia since the killing form is conjugation invariant t 2 ia 2 1 similarly one finds that tt ia q and ttt ia qt ia q q i a from which follows tt ia q 2 q and t tt ttt 2 im qt q conversely given a curve c in su 2 with curvature and torsion functions one can verify easily that q 2 ei satisfies equations 74 for 0 so that the stp curve associated with the akns system defined by q has curvature and torsion finally if we take a solution t to the akns system 72 and right multiply it by g su 2 then we obtain another solution of 72 whose stp curve is g g g g the first term is a rotation of and the second gives a translation so that by choosing g appropriately we can move 0 onto c next we define the darboux transformations of the akns system 72 to this end we fix a non real complex number and a non zero element v c 2 and use the data v to transform the akns system 72 to a new system t q i a where q and are given in terms of q and v as follows let t 1 t 2 t be the c 2 valued function defined by t q i a 0 v 53 and the associated projection operator 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 note that t is the orthogonal projection on the complex 1 dimensional subspace of c 2 spanned by t hence it is unchanged if v is multiplied by a non zero complex scalar next define the complex numbers and the linear operators u i q q i a 75 where a a a lemma a 2 1 u t su 2 2 q t su 2 is the potential associated with the complex function q q i 1 2 2 proof 1 is an orthogonal projection operator hence is conjugate by some element in su 2 to diag 1 0 it follows that u is conjugate by the same element to diag 1 from which it follows that u t su 2 2 one calculates that a 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 from which the stated formula follows easily the following theorem shows how the darboux transformation q 7 q is matched by a transformation 7 of the solutions to the associated akns systems this is followed by a description of the effect of the transformation on the associated curves in r 3 theorem 11 48 is a solution to the akns system 72 if and only if u is a solution to the akns system t q i a 76 where u are given by equation 75 above 54 the proof is by a straighforward calculation using the formulas above and is omitted now we look at the effect of the darboux transformation 7 on the associated stp curves proposition a 3 let then 2 1 2 i 2 77 in particular the distance t t is independent of t proof the formula for is a direct calculation using the definitions above and is omitted to calculate note that being an orthogonal projection is conjugate by an element in su 2 to diag 1 0 thus i 12 i is conjugate by the same element to ia which is of unit norm this implies the stated formula the last proposition states that the pair of stp curves satisfy one of the conditions needed to be in bicycle correspondence to get the other condition one needs to restrict and theorem 12 if we choose a purely imaginary i in the darboux trasnfor mation described above and 0 then the pair of su 2 valued curves and are in 2 bicycle correspondence conversely let 1 2 be two parametrized curves in r 3 in 2 bicycle cor respondence then there exists an akns system 72 with initial conditions 0 su 2 whose corresponding stp curve at 0 is 1 and a darboux transform with i mapping 1 to 2 proof consider a darboux transformation with i and associated stp curves let w by proposition a 3 w 2 what is left to show then is that w and t t 2 are parallel for 0 that is w t 1 2 wt 0 the proof is by a simple but lengthy computation we omit the details conversely given two curves 1 2 in su 2 in 2 bicycling correspondence let 1 and 1 be the curvature and torsion functions of 1 according to proposition a 1 the akns system associated with q 1 2 e i 1 with appropriate initial conditions realizes 1 as the associated stp curve at 0 we now show that an appropriate darboux transformation maps 1 to 2 from the first part of the theorem we know that darboux transformations with i produce curves in 2 bicycle correspondence with 1 we use the expression for in formula 77 of proposition a 1 to show that by varying v c 2 0 we obtain all curves in 2 bicycling correspondence with 1 and in particular 2 by this formula the direction of at t 0 is the unit vector b v i vv v 2 1 2 i su 2 55 rotated by conjugation with now the map v 7 b v is clearly su 2 equivariant b gv gb v g 1 its image is therefore the whole unit sphere in su 2 the orbit of ia under su 2 it follows that every initial direction of at t 0 can be obtained by choosing v appropriately and consequently we obtain all curves 2 in 2 bicycle correspondence with 1 b proof of proposition 3 15 we will prove the statement of proposition 3 15 for a class of odes that includes the bicycle riccati equation 46 for each c function f c r c complex analytic in the first variable and t periodic in the second consider the ode z 1 z f z t 78 where z tz note that equation 46 converts to this form upon the change of variable t 7 t which interchanges stable and unstable fixed points we will show the following proposition b 1 for every function f c r r as above there exists an 0 0 such that for every 0 0 1 there is a unique periodic solution z t to equation 78 with z t 1 for all t 2 z t is a stable periodic solution 3 extended to 0 as z t 0 0 z t is infinitely differentiable in r 0 0 in particular lim 0 n t z t 0 and n z t 0 exists for all t r and integer n 0 note that the above existence result implies immediately the uniqueness statement in proposition 3 15 since a mo bius transformation in psl 2 c has at most one unstable fixed point we divide the proof into the following steps 1 there exists an 0 0 depending on f alone such that for all 0 0 the period map c c of equation 78 has a unique fixed point in d z 1 this fixed point is stable and the associated periodic solution z t is c in r 0 0 2 for all integers n 0 lim 0 nt z t 0 79 3 for all integers n 0 the limit an t lim 0 n z t 80 exists 56 4 z t extended to 0 by z t 0 0 is c in r 0 0 with n z t 0 an t step 1 let m max f z t over z 1 and t r and let 1 0 be such that 1 1 m then for all 1 if z t is a solution to equation 78 and z t 1 for some t one has 1 2 d dt z 2 z z 78 1 z 2 f z 1 1 1 0 81 it follows that for 1 the period map maps d into itself and thus has a fixed point to prove uniqueness we show that for small enough resricted to d is a contraction for this it is enough to show that z 0 for some 1 and all z 0 d this will show also that the fixed point is stable choose an arbitrary solution z t of equation 78 with z 0 d and con sider a nontrivial solution u t of the linearized equation u 1 u fzu around z t here fz zf z t the derivative of the period map at z 0 is given by z 0 u t u 0 exp t 0 1 fz dt now given 0 there exists 0 1 such that re 1 fz for all 0 hence z 0 e t 1 proving that is a contraction in d since is analytic and the contraction is by a factor bounded away from 1 we conclude that the fixed point is an analytic function of for all 0 0 step 2 we prove 79 by induction on n for n 0 it suffices to show that for 1 our periodic solution satisfies z t 1 if z t 1 for some t then for this t by 81 1 2 d dt z 2 1 z 2 f z 1 z 1 1 z 0 82 it follows that for all 1 the periodic solution z t is confined to the disk z 1 and thus lim 0 z t 0 this completes the step n 0 of the induction assume now that 79 holds up to order n 1 for some n 0 let us denote yk k t z differentiating 78 n times by t we obtain y n 1 yn n t f the last term is of the form nt f ayn bn wherea fz z t t and wherebn is a polynomial in the variables z y 1 yn 1 containing no yn with coefficients of the form i z j t f z t with i j n by 57 the assumption on f these coefficients are bounded this and the inductive assumption imply that lim 0 a fz 0 t lim 0 bn b 0 n 83 where b 0 n b 0 n t is a smooth function summarizing yn satisfies the ode y n 1 a yn bn 84 with the coefficients satisfying 83 the same argument used in proving that lim 0 z 0 applies here and it shows that lim 0 yn 0 this completes the proof of 79 step 3 we prove 80 by induction on n for n 0 we already proved it in step 2 for any fixed n 0 assume that 80 holds for all orders n let zk k z multiplying both sides of 78 by and differentiating n times with respect to we get z n nz n 1 zn n f 85 now n f z t n f n n 1 f azn cn n n 1 f where similarly to step 3 we havea fz and cn is a polynomial in z z 1 zn 1 with coefficients of the form j zf z t with j n by step 3 lim 0 a def fz 0 t def a 0 and by the inductive assumption lim 0 cn def c 0 n exists substituting all this into 85 yields after some manipulation z n zn 86 where 1 a n n 1 f nz n 1 cn we have lim 0 1 to show that lim 0 exists we need to know that z n 1 has a limit as 0 we showed that this limit exists for z 0 z let us add the inductive assumption to the one already made that lim 0 z n 1 exists we will show in a moment that then lim 0 z n exists as well with this assumption lim 0 n lim 0 n 1 f z n 1 58 exists to complete the induction we must show that the limits of zn and of z n exist the existence of these limits follows from 86 and from the existence of the limits of and we will in fact show that lim 0 zn lim 0 and lim 0 z n lim 0 87 indeed 1 2 d dt zn 2 86 zn 2 zn which shows that zn is monotonically decreasing whenever zn 2 max this shows that our periodic zn is confined to zn 2 max by the argument used in step 3 and thus converges to as 0 as claimed finally differentiating 86 by t one can apply a similar lyapunov type ar gument to prove the existence of the limit in 87 this completes the induction step and thus the proof of 80 step 4 consider the difference quotient zn t zn t 0 1 0 zn 1 t s ds where zn t 0 is the limit which exists by step 3 since also lim 0 zn 1 t exists so does the limit of the above integral showing that lim 0 zn t zn t 0 zn 1 t 0 and thus proving the claim references 1 g arreaga r capovilla c chryssomalakos j guven area constrained planar elastica physical review e 65 3
