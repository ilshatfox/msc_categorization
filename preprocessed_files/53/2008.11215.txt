ka hler einstein manifolds resp varieties x with kx ample we prove that the weil petersson metric on mksb extends uniquely to the projective variety mksb as a closed positive current with continuous local potentials this generalizes a theorem of wolpert 26 which treats the case n 1 and also confirms a conjecture of berman guenancia 4 in addition we derive uniform estimates for the volumes of sublevel sets of ka hler einstein potentials 1 introduction the deligne mumford moduli spacemg is a quasi projective variety which parametrizes isomorphism classes of smooth curves of genus g if x mg then the tangent space of mg at x is the space of quadratic differentials h 0 x 2 kx the length of a tangent vector with respect to wp the weil petersson metric is its l 2 norm with respect to the hyperbolic metric on x and measures the rate at which the complex structure changes in the direction the metric has negative holomorphic sectional curvature and finite diameter wolpert 26 27 proved that wp extends to a ka hler current on mg a projective variety which parametrizes stable curves of genus g and he showed that locally on mg we have wp 1 for some continuous plurisubharmonic function in dimension n 1 the generalization of mg is mksb which parametrizes smooth projective varieties x with kx ample i e ka hler einstein manifolds with kx ample by the theorem of aubin yau the weil petersson metric wp on the tangent space of mksb at a point x mksb is the l 2 metric on the space of harmonic 0 1 forms with coefficients in the tangent bundle of the manifold x here the theory is not as complete as the riemann surface case but much is known an early key result was the computation of the holomorphic bisectional curvature of wp which was achieved by siu 19 a second important advance is the result of schumacher 18 which can be formulated as follows suppose x b be a smooth family of ka hler einstein manifolds x of dimension n and kx ample the relative canonical bundle kx b has a canonical metric h given by the ka hler einstein volume form on each fiber the main result of 18 shows that the curvature of h is a positive 1 1 form on x moreover n 1 wp let x b be a flat family of ka hler einstein varieties x of dimension n and kx ample i e stable varieties x cf 4 for background and precise defintions extending the smooth family x b then can be extended to a closed positive current on x with analytic singularities in 21 we show that this positive current has vanishing lelong number and hence kx b the relative canonical bundle is nef on x as a consequence the weil petersson volume of mksb is a finite rational number the goal of this paper is generalize wolpert s result 26 27 to higher dimensions i e to establish the continuity of the local ka hler potential of wp on the compactified moduli research supported in part by national science foundation grant dms 1711439 dms 1609335 and simons foundation mathematics and physical sciences collaboration grants award number 631318 1 http arxiv org abs 2008 11215 v 1 2 space mksb in the process we establish uniform estimates for the volumes of sublevel sets for the ka hler einstein potential which may be of independent interest in order to state our results precisely we first review some necessary background by the classical results aubin and yau 3 28 a ka hler manifold with kx ample has a unique negatively curved ka hler einstein metric in 21 we prove that the gromov hausdorff completion of the moduli space of n dimensional negatively curved ka hler einstein manifolds is canonically identified with the ksb compatification of the moduli space of smooth canonically polarized manifolds in addition we show the local potentials of the weil petersson metric are bounded let lcm mksb be the cm line bundle as described in 16 21 and let h be a fixed smooth hermitian metric on lcm since lcm is ample 16 we can choose h hfs to be the fubini study metric restricted to lcm and fs ric hfs then wp the weil petersson metric on mksb is the curvature of a hermitian metric 1 1 hwp hfse wp and 1 2 wp fs 1 wp c 1 lcm for some wp psh mksb fs l mksb as shown in 21 our main result is the following theorem 1 1 the hermitian metric hwp is continuous and wp c 0 mksb in particular the weil petersson metric extends to a closed positive current wp on mksb i e for any point p mksb there exist an open neighborhood u of p and wp psh u c 0 u such that in u wp 1 wp theorem 1 1 confirms a conjecture of berman and guenancia 4 the estimates we need use the approach of 21 but sharper bounds are required our argument should generalize to the case of stable families of klt pairs whose general fibres are not necessarily smooth we conjecture that the weil petersson current can still be still defined for the moduli space of canonically polarized projective varieties with klt singularities and it can be extended to a ka hler current with continuous local potentials on the compactified ksb moduli space let mksb be the smooth interior part of mksb then as we conjectured in 21 mksb wp should have finite diameter and its metric completion should be homeomorphic to mksb the conjecture always holds for a stable family of ka hler einstein manifolds over a one dimensional disk where the central fibre has only singularities of complete simple normal crossings 22 17 next we introduce the notions of stable varieties and stable families the following equivalent characterizations of stable variety are established in 4 a projective variety x is stable if kx is ample and it satisfies any one of the following additional conditions 1 xreg has a ka hler einstein metric whose volume is c 1 kx n 2 x is smooth or x has a worst semi log canonical singularities 3 x is k stable in the sense of 23 6 3 now we can define stable families as follows definition 1 1 a flat projective morphism x b between normal varieties a stable family if the following holds 1 the relative canonical bundle kx b is q cartier and is ample 2 the fibres of are stable and the generic fiber is smooth we let b be the set of smooth points of b over which is smooth and x 1 b for each t b there exists a unique ka hler einstein metric t c 1 xt on the fibre xt 1 t and one can define the hermitian metric on the relative canonical bundle kx b by ht n t 1 it is proved by schumacher 18 and tsuji 24 using different methods that ric h 1 log h is nonnegative on x and it is strictly positive for a nowhere infinitesimally trivial family it is further shown in 18 that h can be uniquely extended to a non negatively curved singular hermitian metric on kx b with analytic singularities in 21 we prove that h has vanishing lelong number everywhere on x and it tends exactly at the non klt locus of the special fibres of x b in particular our result gives an analytic proof of fujino s theorem 8 that the relative canonical bundle kx b is nef if we let eslc be the union of semi log and log canonical locus of special fibres of x or equivalently the non klt locus then by 4 20 eslc where is the ka hler einstein potential our next theorem establishes the continuity of h on x eslc theorem 1 2 let x b be a stable family of n dimensional canonical models over a normal variety b let t be the unique ka hler einstein metric on xt for t b and h be the hermitian metric on the relative canonical sheaf kx b defined by ht n t 1 the curvature 1 log h of kx b h extends uniquely to a closed nonnegative 1 1 current on x satisfying the following 1 has vanishing lelong number everywhere in x 2 xt t for t b 3 h is continuous on x eslc moreover if all the fibres of x b have at worst log terminal singularities then h is continuous on x the variety mksb is a coarse moduli space and as such does not support a universal family but cf 21 there exists a projective variety b a finite cover f b mksb and a stable family xb b such that if t b then xt f t let k n v be the set of all negatively curved ka hler einstein manifolds of dimension n and volume at most v matsusaka s big theorem implies that every x k n v lies in one of a finite number of such families in other words there is a single projective family x b pnm 4 pluricanonically imbedded which contains every element of k n v let 1 m fs where fs is the fubini study metric on p nm for x k n v let x x 1 x denote the unique ka hler einstein metric on x 4 20 21 it is necessary to estimate decay rates of x in order to understand the asymptotic behavior of the weil petersson metric near the boundary of the ksb moduli space more precisely we shall need the following volume estimate for the sublevel sets of the ka hler einstein potentials theorem 1 3 fix n v 0 and b as above then there exists c c n v 0 such that for all negatively curved ka hler einstein manifolds x of dimension n and vol ume at most v the following holds for all 0 m n and all k 1 have 1 3 x k x 1 x m n m x ckne k 4 n 2 moreover the estimate 1 3 holds for all smoothable negatively curved ka hler einstein varieties of dimension n and volume at most v theorem 1 3 implies a uniform exponential decay for the volumes of sub level sets of the ka hler einstein potentials we believe that these estimates will be useful in under standing the incompleteness of the weil petersson metric one would also like to derive a geometric version of theorem 1 3 by replacing the ka hler einstein potential by the distance function we give a brief outline of the paper in section 2 we review semi stable reduction and in section 3 we establish the c 0 estimate for the ka hler einstein potentials in section 4 we prove theorem 1 3 for the exponential decay of the volume measure of the level sets of the ka hler einstein potentials in section 5 we give an alternative proof for an integral estimate derived in 21 in section 6 and 7 we prove the continuity of weil petersson potentials for stable families and complete the proof of theorem 1 1 finally we prove theorem 1 2 in section 8 2 stable families and semistable reduction in this section we will review the semi stable reduction theorem and follow the discus sion in 21 section 4 with some simplification let x b be a stable family with dimb d 1 the theorem of adiprasito liu temkin 2 says that there is a smooth variety s a finite base change b b and a birational map x x b b such that the projection x x b b is a semistable reduction by abuse of notation we shall write b for b and x for x x b b we obtain a diagram 2 4 x x x b 5 where x and are to be defined later semistable reduction means that there are local coordinates t t 1 td on b and x 1 xn d on x such that the ti are multiplicity free monomials in x we introduce some additional notations for more precise statements for simplicity we assume that b is a eculidean ball in cd and so we can choose t t 1 td as global coordinates on b let hi ti 0 x to say that x b is a semistable reduction means that for 1 i d the cartier divisor hi the pullback of the cartier divisor hi is a divisor of simple normal crossings whose components f 1 f 2 all have multiplicity one note that these components may not be smooth since they can intersect themselves we write hi ti 0 f ai f where ai is the set of irreducible components of hi observe that f ti 0 for all f ai so in particular if i 6 j ai aj there is a disjoint partition ai di vi such that the elements of di are non exceptional and those of vi are exceptional satisfying 2 5 hi h i v i d di d e vi e here h i is the strict transform of hi let exc be the exceptional set of and f exc the union of divisorial com ponents of exc then f can be written as a disjoint union as follows 2 6 f v h where h is the set of horizontal exceptional divisors that is e h if and only if e b and v is the set of vertical exceptional divisors we can write x u a finite covering by coordinate neighborhoods and choose local coordinates x u with the following properties fix and let u u let i 1 2 n d then there exist a disjoint decomposition i a 1 a 2 ad r such that ai di vi and ti j ai xj j di xj j vi xj here di and vi are the set of indices associated to di and vi given by the following j 7 xj 0 defines maps ai ai di di and vi vi which need not be one to one since if j k di with j 6 k then j k d if the divisor d intersects itself the following lemma gives the construction of for x b in diagram 2 4 6 lemma 2 1 there exist x x a series of locally toric blow ups and local coordinates on open charts u of x such that 2 7 hi h i v i d d i d e v i aee where h i v i d i and v i are defined for similarly as in 2 5 and on each u u ti j d i xj j v i x aij j di vi d i v i and d i 1 where aij z 0 d i and v i are the set of indices associated to d i and v i moreover the map x b is flat proof we use induction fix i suppose there exists such that in u u we have d i 1 choose such that d i is maximal then we blow up the smooth variety j d i j smoothness is a consequence of the fact that d i is maximal in other words if di d i ji jm then we make the changes of variables of the form xj 1 7 xj 1 and xjp 7 xj 1 xjp if p 1 in these new coordinates j 1 d i instead j 1 v i thus we have reduced di by one continuing in this fashion we prove the first part of the lemma to see that x b is flat we observe that both x and b are smooth and is equi dimensional the miracle flatness theorem cf 26 2 11 of 25 implies is flat we remark that in lemma 2 1 j x is in the strict transform of hi if and only if j d i in other words in the local coordinate chart u x at most one component of the total transform of hi is non exceptional lemma 2 1 is an improvement of the procedure in 21 and helps to simplify future calculations finally we recall the following adjunction lemma proved in 21 lemma 2 2 there exist ak 1 and bl 0 such that 2 8 kx d i 1 h i kx d i 1 hi ek v akek fl h blfl 3 the c 0 estimate for the ka hler einstein potential in this section we will prove a sharp c 0 estimate for the ka hler einstein potential we will follow the notations in section 2 and replace b or b by b a euclidean ball in cd let 0 m be a basis for the pluricanonical system mkx b for some sufficiently large m z so that mkx b is globally generated let 3 9 m j 0 j 2 1 m and 1 log we can immediately translate the algebraic adjunction formula 2 8 into the following analytic local formula with coordinates on x 7 lemma 3 1 there exists c 0 such that on each open chart u u 3 10 1 n d t di 1 1 dti dt i t 2 c n dk 1 1 dxk dx k xj d xj 2 xj v xj 2 aj where xj 0 corresponds to the divisor in d id i or v ivi for t b we let t be the solution to the following complex monge ampere equation 3 11 t 1 t n e t t where t and t are the restrictions of and to xt 1 t by 20 equation 3 11 admits a unique solution t with vanishing lelong number along the semi log and log locus of xt for each t b for t b t t 1 t is the ka hler einstein metric on xt satisfying ric t t including those t for which xt is a singular semi log canonical model we define x reg be the union of smooth points of xt for all t b and l loc x reg such that xt t it is proved in 21 that extends globally to x in psh x with vanishing lelong number in particular is bounded above and locally bounded below away from the non klt locus of xt for all t b in fact 1 is the curvature of the relative canonical line bundle kx b let e be any divisor of x containing the exceptional locus of theorem 4 7 of 2 says that we may choose in 2 4 to be an isomorphism over any open subeset of b for which is smooth in particular in 2 6 we have h thus we may choose e x in such a way that 3 12 b b e and e b has codimension one we let e be a defining section of e and he be a smooth hermitian metric on the line bundle on x associated to e then the function log e 2 he is defined on x and by abusing the notations we identify it with its push forward onto x the following is the main result of this section and it is a sharp improvement of the c 0 estimate in 20 21 proposition 3 1 for any 0 there exists c 0 such that on x we have 3 13 2 n log log e 2 he c remark if we choose e 1 ep as in 3 12 such that b b p i 1 ei we obtain 3 14 2 n log log p i 1 ei 2 he c note that the right side of 3 14 is finite on each smooth fiber in the case where the base has dimension 1 and the central fibre is irreducible a sharper estimate is achieved in 15 with a coefficient of n 1 however any constant will suffice for our application to the estimates of weil petersson potentials 8 before proving proposition 3 13 let us have a quick review on a standard procedure for constructing plurisubharmonic functions from convex functions definition 3 1 a continuous convex function h r r is said to be an admissible function if h 0 h 0 on r for example h x log x is an admissible function and h x x 1 is an admissible function whenever 0 1 lemma 3 2 suppose is a negative plurisubharmonic function on a domain in cn and h is an admissible function then h is also plurisubharmonic proof straightforward calculations show that 1 h h 1 1 h 0 if v log z 2 on the unit ball in c and f x x 1 for some 0 1 then f x 1 x f x 1 x 1 on c we have 1 log z 2 1 1 1 dz dz log z 2 1 z 2 let be a smooth function and v log z 2 e log z 2 on the unit ball then for z sufficiently small we have 3 15 1 v 1 1 2 1 1 dz dz log z 2 e 1 z 2 e if 1 u 0 for some ka hler form and if h u 1 for some admissible function h then 3 16 1 h u h u 1 u h u 1 u we now begin to prove proposition 3 1 proof of proposition 3 1 we will follow the same approach in 21 with some simplifica tion let exc be the exceptional locus in the diagram 2 4 and lemma 2 1 for by kodaira s lemma there exists an effective q cartier divisor e whose support contains exc and the class e is ample on x furthermore we let e be a defining section of e and he be a smooth hermitian metric on x such that e 2 he 1 2 and 1 log e 2 he 0 is a ka hler form on x we now define for 0 sufficiently small 3 17 u log e 2 he 2 log e 2 he 1 3 n 3 n 9 and 3 18 f h u h log e 2 he 2 log e 2 he 1 3 n it is straightforward to verify that there exist 0 and 0 0 such that for any 0 0 and 0 0 we have u psh x since log e 2 he is bounded below by log 2 0 the admissible function h will also be chosen later and it has to satisfy the condition that h u 1 we let f t xt t ft ft f xt then the complex monge ampere equation 3 11 can be rewritten as 3 19 t ft 1 t n e t eft t note that since tends to near the exceptional locus of or e we may conclude that achieves its minimum suppose t achieves its minimum at p we have at p 3 20 e t 1 d t 2 e ft t 1 ft n di 1 dti dt i 1 d t 2 t di 1 dti dt i applying 3 15 and 3 16 there exists c 1 c 2 0 such that 1 h u 1 f 1 u c 1 1 d i 1 j d i dxj dx j j v i dxj dx j log xj 2 1 xj 2 c 1 1 n d j 1 dxj dx j c 2 1 d i 1 j v i dxj dx j log xj 2 1 xj 2 c 2 1 n d j 1 dxj dx j where v i v i with equality if and only if d i 6 otherwise v i equals v i with one element removed on the other hand dti ti j d i dxj xj j v i dxj xj and 1 f n h u n 1 u n therefore 1 de f 1 f n di 1 dti dt j t 2 e h u h u n j v log xj 2 1 1 n d n di 1 dxi dx i j d xj 2 j v xj 2 10 where v di 1 v i d di 1 d i immediately there exists c 0 such that e e h u h u n j v log xj 2 1 e h u h u n c u n 1 if we now let h x 2 n log x then h u 2 n u 1 and at the minimal point p we have e h u h u n u n 1 u 2 n 1 u 2 n n 1 u n 1 if we choose n therefore there exists c 0 such that c or equivalently 3 21 f c this completes the proof of proposition 3 13 by combining 3 21 and the definition of f in 3 18 4 integrability of log e 2 he let e and he be the holomorphic section and hermitian metric of e in proposition 3 1 for t b b z we will prove a uniform estimate for the integrals of log e 2 he this can be proved by local calculations from the argument in 21 in this section we give an alternative proof using a result of morikawi 13 proposition 4 1 for t b b z let 4 22 i t xt log e 2 he n t then i t extends to a continuous function b r in particular i t is uniformly bounded for all t b the proof is an application of the following theorem of morikawi 13 theorem 4 1 let fx x b be a flat projective morphism of algebraic varieties over c of relative dimension n let l 0 ln be line bundles equipped with smooth hermitian metrics h 0 hn then h 0 hn is a continuous hermitian metric on the deligne pairing l 0 ln x b b thus if l 0 ln are generic rational sections of l 0 ln such that nj 0 div lj then l 0 ln is a positive continuous function on b 11 note that the fibers xt are all projective varieties but x and b need not be projective for details on the definition and properties of deligne pairings see 29 and 13 but let us here recall the basic framework if fx x b is as above and l 0 ln are hermitian line bundles on x then l 0 ln x b is a hermitian line bundle on b for example if n 0 then l 0 is the norm of l l 0 thus the fiber of l at b b equals x f 1 x blx and if l is a rational section of l then l x f 1 x blx is a rational section of l and l h x f 1 x b lx h in general l 0 ln x b l 0 ln 1 div ln b and the restriction of l 0 ln to div ln is just l 0 ln 1 moreover the formula for the norm of the restriction is given below by 4 23 in fact these properties give an inductive characterization of the deligne pairing let fx x b be as in theorem 4 1 let b t b f 1 x t is smooth and b b a zariski open subset we shall need the following lemma lemma 4 1 fix l 0 ln rational sections of l 0 ln such that nj 0 div lj as sume that one of the following conditions holds 1 div l 0 b is flat or 2 f div l 0 b and div lj b is flat for 1 j n then the map i b r given by t 7 xt log l 0 2 h 0 c 1 h 1 cn hn is continuous and extends to a continuous function b r proof assume div l 0 b is flat then the result follows from theorem 4 1 and the induction formula for deligne pairings 4 23 log l 0 ln x b log l 1 ln div l 0 b xt log l 0 2 h 0 c 1 h 1 cn hn on b now assume f div l 0 b and div lj b is flat for 1 j n we proceed using induction on n let y div l 1 then fy y b is flat with fiber dimension n 1 writing lj div lj we compute for t b xt log l 0 2 h 0 c 1 h 1 cn hn xt log l 0 2 h 0 l 1 1 log l 1 2 h 1 c 1 h 2 cn hn yt log l 0 2 h 0 c 1 h 2 cn hn xt log l 1 2 l 0 c 1 h 0 c 1 h 2 cn hn now the first integral is continuous by induction and the second is continuous by part 1 of the lemma note that l 0 xt for t b by assumption 12 proof of proposition 4 1 we wish to apply lemma 4 1 as follows see 2 4 for the notation let x x l 0 o e l 0 e and l 1 l 2 ln mkx b then the hypotheses of part 2 of lemma 4 1 apply by virtue of 3 12 5 level sets of the ka hler einstein potentials let x b be a stable family of canonically polarized manifolds where b cd is a euclidean ball let b t b xt is smooth and x 1 b for t b we let t be the solution of the complex monge ampe re equation induced by the ka hler einstein equation satisfying nt t 1 t n e t t where t and t are defined in 3 9 the main goal of this section is to bound the volume of the level sets of the ka hler einstein potentials t we first recall the definition of capacity in pluripotential theory definition 5 1 let x be an n dimensional compact ka hler manifold and let be a smooth closed nonnegative 1 1 form on x the capacity for a borel subset k of x associated to is defined by 5 24 cap k sup k 1 u n u psh x 1 u 0 the following lemma is well known 12 lemma 5 1 suppose x is a compact complex manifold 0 a closed nonnegative 1 1 form and psh x l x with 0 then for k 1 we have k 1 n kn cap k proof let k max k and uk k 1 k then uk psh x and 1 uk 0 then k 1 n x n k 1 n x n k 1 k n k 1 k n kn k 1 uk n kn cap k 13 the following lemma is proved in 9 proposition 2 6 lemma 5 2 let psh x with 0 then for k 1 cap k k 1 x n n x n the following proposition is the main result of the section and is equivalent to theorem 1 3 it implies the exponential decay for the measure of the level set of the potential t proposition 5 1 there exists c 0 such that for 0 m n and all t b t k t 1 t m n mt ckne k 4 n 2 proof the uniform c 0 estimate of proposition 3 1 implies that there exists c 1 0 such that for all t b t 2 n 1 log log e 2 he xt c 1 2 n 1 log t c 1 we define t by t 2 2 n 1 log t 2 c 1 by the upper bound estimate for t in 21 there exists a 0 such that for all t b sup xt t a then supxt t a we let t mt max t 2 mt where mt infxt t obviously we still have 2 t t mt thus t k 2 t 1 t n t mt k t 2 t 1 t n t mt k t 2 t 1 t mt n t mt a k 2 t 1 t mt n where the second inequality follows from the comparison principle for plurisubharmonic functions we now may replace t by t mt in proving the proposition by lemma 5 1 and lemma 5 2 we have t mt a k 2 t 1 t n kn cap t t mt k a kn cap t t k a kn cap t 4 n 2 log t k a 2 c 1 kn cap t t e k a 2 c 1 4 n 2 kn e k a 2 c 1 4 n 2 xt t nt n xt nt 14 by letting mt we have by proposition 4 1 that there exists c 2 0 such that t k 2 t 1 t n c 2 kne k a 2 c 1 4 n 2 the proposition now follows from t k 2 t 1 t n n m 0 t k t 1 t m n mt corollary 5 1 there exists c 0 such that for 0 m n and all t b t k t t 1 t m n mt ce k 4 n 4 proof we apply proposition 5 1 and there exist c 1 c

hold uniformly for all t b if t b b we can always approximate xt by a smooth ka hler manifold of dimension n after normalization and resolution of singularities the constants in the proposition and corollary are uniformly controlled this can also be achieved by applying continuity of on x from section 8 6 continuity of the weil petersson potentials for stable families in this section we will prove the continuity of the weil petersson potentials for stable families of ka hler einstein manifolds as before we consider a stable family x b of n dimensional ka hler einstein manifolds over a euclidean ball b cd whose general fibre is smooth we will use the same notations as in the previous sections we define the relative weil petersson potential wp by 6 25 wp 1 n 1 v n j 0 xt t t 1 t j n jt 15 the the weil petersson metric on b is given by c f 18 21 wp xt n 1 1 wp the following is the main result of this section proposition 6 1 wp is continuous in b it is proved in 14 that xt n 1 is a nonnegative closed 1 1 current on b with con tinuous local potentials then proposition 6 1 immediately implies wp has continuous local potentials let x reg be the set of all smooth points of xt for t b and let x regt be the smooth points of xt before proving proposition 6 1 we first prove that the ka hler einstein potential is continuous on x reg which is slightly weaker than the conclusion in theorem 1 2 the following lemma is implicitly proved in 21 lemma 5 2 and lemma 5 3 lemma 6 1 suppose tj b and tj t b then t x regtj converges smoothly to t x regt proof by lemma 5 2 in 21 for any k 0 and compact set k x reg t is uniformly bounded in ck k xt for all t b therefore for all tj t b tj converges smoothly to away from k after taking a subsequence however by the uniform l estimate is bounded above and bounded below by any log poles by uniqueness of the canonical ka hler einstein current on xt theorem 1 1 in 20 t the lemma follows immediately lemma 6 1 immediately implies continuity of on x reg corollary 6 1 is continuous on x reg it suffices to prove continuity of the weil petersson potential at one point we will fix t b by corollary 5 1 there exists sufficiently small 0 0 such that for any 0 0 and t b we have 6 26 n m 0 t 1 t t 1 t m t n m 3 lemma 6 2 for any 0 0 there exists an open neighborhood u xt of xt x reg t such that n m 0 u t 1 t m t n m 2 and t 1 u 16 proof t is uniformly bounded on xt t 1 therefore there exists an open set u containing x sing t t 1 such that n m 0 u t 1 t m t n m 4 where x sing t xt x regt is the singular set of xt since x sing t is a closed pluriclosed set the lemma is then proved by choosing u u t 1 we choose open neighborhoods u and v of x x reg in x such that 6 27 1 u v v xt u since x reg is locally a smooth holomorphic product by partition of unity there exist an open neighborhood b 0 of t in b and a collection of finitely many smooth functions 6 28 on x satisfying 1 the support of is biholomorphic to t t 0 b x u where b is a unit ball in cn with t b xt 2 0 1 3 for any p 1 b 0 v p 1 since t converges smoothly to t as t t on x reg by straightforward calculation on local euclidean spaces for each we have lim t t xt t 1 t m t n m x t t 1 t m t n m uniformly for t b 0 since supp x u we have lim t t xt u t 1 t m t n m x t v t 1 t m t n m x t t 1 t m t n m u t 1 t m t n m t n 2 by lemma 6 2 in particular t n is a topological number independent of t and by proposition 5 1 or the fact that t e 1 c f 4 we have xt t 1 t m t n m t n we then have the following lemma 17 lemma 6 3 for any 0 0 there exists 0 0 such that for any t with t t and 0 m n we have xt u t 1 t m t n m 2 2 and xt u t 1 t m t n m t n 2 2 where u is constructed as in 6 27 corollary 6 2 for any 0 0 there exists 0 0 such that for any t with t t we have n m 0 xt u t t 1 t m t n m 2 n 1 proof by lemma 6 3 we have xt u t 1 t t 1 t m t n m xt u t 1 t 1 t m t n m 2 the corollary follows by combining the above estimate and the assumption 6 26 lemma 6 4 for any 0 0 there exists 0 0 such that for t t n m 0 xt t t 1 t m t n m x t t t 1 t m t n m i e wp t wp t proof by the same partition of unity as in 6 28 we have lim t t xt t t 1 t m t n m x

sufficiently close to t now proposition 6 1 immediately follows from lemma 6 4 and the result in 14 that xt n 1 1 for some psh b c 0 b corollary 6 3 there exists wp psh b c 0 b such that wp 1 wp 7 proof of theorem 1 1 in order to prove theorem 1 1 we have to replace the smooth base by the compactified ksb moduli space in corollary 6 3 as in section 7 of 21 we will replace mksb by a smooth model as follows there exists a finite map b mksb together with a stable family x b such that for any p mksb the fibres 1 p are ka hler einstein varieties cor respond to the point p in the moduli space after normalization and resolution of sin gularities we can assume b is smooth and is generically finite we can define wp globally on mksb by pushing forward the weil petersson current wp b on b by it is shown in 21 that the weil petersson current on mksb has bounded local potentials and is independent of the choice of b furthermore wp is the curvature of the cm line 19 bundle lcm mksb let h be the smooth hermitian metric on lcm with fs ric h being the fubini study metric induced by a projective embedding from the linear system of a sufficiently large power of lcm then by corollary 6 3 we have wp b fs 1 wp b for some wp b psh b fs c 0 b in particular it is proved in 21 that wp b coincides with the pullback of a bounded function wp psh mksb fs l mksb on the regular set of let f be an irreducible component of a fibre of b mksb with dimf 1 obviously lcm f 0 and fs f 0 this implies that wp b is plurisubharmonic and continuous on f hence wp b must be constant along f therefore wp b can descend to a continuous function on mksb this completes the proof of theorem 1 1 8 proof of theorem 1 2 in this section we will complete the proof of theorem 1 2 let x b be a stable family of canonically polarized manifolds where b cd is a ball let eslc be the set of all non klt locus of xt for t b for t b let t satisfy nt 1 t n e t t the following is the main result of of this section to bound the volume of the level sets of the ka hler einstein potentials t we let gt be the ka hler einstein metric associated to t the following theorem is proved in 21 theorem 8 1 for any tj b with tj t xtj gtj converges in pointed gromov hausdorff topology to the metric completion of x t gt where x t is the smooth part of xt and gt is the smooth ka hler einstein metric on x t that extends to the unique ka hler einstein current on xt in particular the metric completion of x t gt is homeomorphic to xt escl and the convergence is smooth on x t gt in fact it is proved in 20 that t is always bounded away from eslc lemma 8 1 let pt xt be a continuous section of x b such that pt t b eslc then for any r 0 there exists cr 0 such that for any t b sup bgt pt r t cr proof we prove by contradiction by assumption geodesic unit balls centered at pt are uniformly non collapsed i e there exists c 0 such that for all t b v olgt bgt pt 1 c suppose there exist a sequence tj b with tj t b and a sequence xj xtj with xj x xt eslc in gromov hausdorff distance such that for any a 0 there exists j 0 so that for all j j we have tj xj a 20 we can assume that for some fixed sufficiently small r 0 bgtj xj r converges in gromov hausdorff topology to bgt x r by the local l 2 estimate and partial c 0 estimate in 21 there exists a sequence of j h 0 xtj mkxtj for some fixed m 1 satisfying the following 1 for each j xtj j 2 hmtjdvgtj 1 where ht n t 1 is the hermitian metric on the relative canonical bundle kx b induced by the ka hler einstein metrics on the fibres 2 there exists c 0 such that for each j sup bgtj xj r j 2 hmtj gtj c 3 there exists c 0 such that for each j j 2 hmtj xj c by passing to a subsequence we can assume that j converges to an l 2 integrable pluricanonical section on bgt x r since htj converges smoothly to ht on the smooth part of xt by the uniform gradient estimate 2 hmt extends to a continuous function on bgt x r and there exist 0 and 0 2 r such that inf bgt x 2 2 hmt we fix a projective embedding x cpnm by mkx u for an affine neighborhood u of t in b such that m 1 1 log 1 nm i 1 zi 2 in an affine and bounded open set of cpnm containing bgt x r and bgtj xj r for all j then there exist aj i c and c 0 such that j aj 0 nm i 1 aj izi and for all i j we have ai j c and lim j aj i a i in particular a 0 6 0 since j 2 hmtj aj 0 nm i 1 aj i zi 2 1 nm i 1 zi 2 e m tj is uniformly bounded above for in bgtj xj r tj must be uniformly bounded from below in bgtj xj r this leads to contradiction the proof of lemma 8 1 already implies the continuity of however we include the following two estimates as first and second order control of t 21 lemma 8 2 for any relative compact k x escl there exists ck 0 such that 8 29 sup k trgt ck proof we will pick base points pt for t b and we can assume that there exists c 0 such that v ol bgt pt 1 c for all t b let rt x be the distance function from x to pt on xt immediately we have rt gt 1 trt r 1 t 1 we define the cut off function t r x rt x satisfying r r 1 if r r r r 0 if r 2 r where smooth nonnegative decreasing function satisfies r 0 0 1 r r 2 cr 2 r cr 2 for a fixed constant c 0 we let ht r r

rtrgt t 1 4 an a log trgt t since xlogx e for x 0 and t is uniformly bounded in the support of r for all t we can apply the maximum principle and conclude that ht r is uniformly bounded for all t b for any fixed r 1 the lemma then immediately follows we remark that lemma 8 2 can also be used to prove continuity of the weil petersson potentials in section 6 proposition 8 1 for any relatively compact k x escl there exists ck 0 such that 8 30 sup k t gt ck proof the proposition can be proved by the partial c 0 estimate and l 2 estimate we give an alternative proof using the maximum principle let t be the laplace operator of gt on xt where t b straightforward calculations show that t t 2 gt t 2 gt 2 t 2 gt t 2 gt 2 re trgt t t gt 22 we will pick base points pt for t b and the cute off function r as in the proof of lemma 8 2 by the c 0 estimate of t there exists ar 1 such that 2 t l bgt pt 2 r ar for all t b in bgt pt 2 r we have t t 2 gt a t t t 2 ar t t 2 gt t t ar t 2 2 re t 2 t ar t 2 gt 2 t 4 gt a t 3 t 2 gt 2 t 2 gt t 2 gt 2 re trgt t t gt ar t t 2 gt n trgt t ar t 2 2 re t 2 t ar t 2 gt 2 t 4 gt a t 3 also we have the following calculations because the fubini study metric t in the ambient projective space has bounded curvature ttrgt t trgt t 2 gt trgt t c trgt t 2 by the result in 21 trgt t is uniformly bounded away from eslc and so there exists a r 0 such that in a gt pt 2 r we have ttrgt t trgt t 2 gt a r now we let ht r r t 2 gt ar t b trgt t kt r t 2 gt ar t b trgt t for some sufficiently large c 0 to be determined then there exist c 1 c 2 c 5 0 such that on xt for all t b we have tht r t r kt r 2 re r t 2 gt a t gt r t t 2 gt a t ctrgt t t r kt r 2 re r kt r b trgt t gt r t 2 gt n trgt t ar t 2 r t 2 gt 2 t 2 gt t 2 gt 2 re trgt t t gt ar t

maximum principle there exists cr 0 such that for all t b sup xt ht r cr this completes the proof of the proposition the following corollary is an immediate consequence of the uniform gradient
