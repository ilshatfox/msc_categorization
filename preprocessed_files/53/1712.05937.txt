homotopy groups of the observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith abstract the observer moduli space of riemannian metrics is the quotient of the space r m of all riemannian metrics on a manifold m by the group of diffeomorphisms diffx 0 m which fix both a basepoint x 0 and the tangent space at x 0 the group diffx 0 m acts freely on r m providing m is connected this offers certain advantages over the classic moduli space which is the quotient by the full diffeomorphism group results due to botvinnik hanke schick and walsh and to hanke schick and steimle have demonstrated that the higher homotopy groups of the observer moduli space ms 0 x 0 m of positive scalar curvature metrics are in many cases non trivial the aim in the current paper is to establish similar results for the moduli space mric 0 x 0 m of metrics with positive ricci curvature in particular we show that for a given k there are infinite order elements in the homotopy group 4 kmric 0 x 0 s n provided the dimension n is odd and sufficiently large in establishing this we make use of a gluing result of perelman we provide full details of the proof of this

great efforts made to better understand the topology of moduli spaces of riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on a smooth compact usually spin manifold see 6 5 4 16 apart from results of kreck and stolz in 17 and wraith in 23 concerning path connectivity we know very little about topology of the corresponding moduli spaces of positive ricci curvature metrics in this context we should also mention work of dessai klaus and tuschmann on moduli spaces of non negative sectional curvature metrics in 8 and the results of crowley schick and steimle on the space of ricci positive metrics on certain manifolds see 7 whether or not there is any non triviality in the higher homotopy groups of such moduli spaces is still an open question here we study the topology of its closest relative the observer moduli space mric 0 x 0 s n of positive ricci curvature metrics on the sphere sn we denote by ds 2 n the standard round metric on s n and by ds 2 n its orbit in the moduli space mric 0 x 0 s n here is our main result main theorem for any m n there is an integer n m such that for all odd n n m the group i mric 0 x 0 s n ds 2 n q is non trivial when i 4 k and k m we would like to emphasize that the observer moduli space is indeed the most tractable moduli space of metrics let r m be the space of all metrics on a compact closed manifold m and diff m be the group of diffeomorphisms which acts naturally on r m by pull back even though the space r m is contractible the moduli space of all metrics i e the orbit space r m diff m could be very complicated since some metrics have non trivial isometry groups hence in general the action of diff m on the space of metrics r m is far from being tractable following ideas from gauge theory we fix an observer i e a base point x 0 m together with a frame at the tangent space tx 0 m then we obtain the observer moduli space mx 0 m r m diffx 0 m where the gauge group diffx 0 m fixes such an observer it is easy to see that the gauge group diffx 0 m acts freely on the space of metrics provided m is a connected manifold then the observer moduli space mx 0 m is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space bdiffx 0 m and the corresponding observer moduli space mric 0 x 0 m of positive ricci metrics maps naturally to mx 0 m see below for more details the proof of main theorem is based on an analogous theorem by botvinnik hanke schick and walsh for the observer moduli space of positive scalar curvature metrics see 4 both proofs rely heavily on work of farrell hsiang hatcher and goette see 10 and 12 techniques for constructing families of metrics are also required in the scalar curvature case this means a family version of the gromov lawson surgery technique from 11 described in 22 due to the flexibility of the scalar curvature and the strength of the gromov lawson construction this technique permits the detection of non triviality for manifolds besides the sphere unsurprisingly the ricci curvature case requires a more delicate construction which is based on a gluing theorem of perelman as yet we have not demonstrated non triviality beyond the case of the sphere observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 3 1 2 the observer moduli spaces of metrics let m be a smooth closed connected manifold of dimension n we denote by r m the space of all riemannian metrics on m equipped with the smooth whitney topology for a metric g r m we denote by sg and ricg its scalar and ricci curvatures we then consider the subspaces rs 0 m r m and rric 0 m r m of metrics with positive scalar and positive ricci curvatures respectively let diff m be the group of diffeomorphisms on m this group acts on the space of metrics by pull back diff m r m r m g 7 g recalling that m is connected we fix a base point x 0 m which plays the role of an observer in a sense which will become clear shortly let diffx 0 m diff m be the subgroup of diffeomorphisms m m such that x 0 x 0 and such that the derivative d x 0 tx 0 m tx 0 m is the identity this is the observer diffeomorphism group of m based at x 0 as we have mentioned the group diffx 0 m acts freely on the space of metrics r m provided m is a connected manifold see 4 lemma 1 2 the orbit space mx 0 m r m diffx 0 is the observer moduli space of metrics on m since the space r m is contractible and the action of diffx 0 m on r m is proper see 9 lemma 1 2 the observer moduli space mx 0 m is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space bdiffx 0 m of the group diffx 0 m in particular we have a diffx 0 m principal bundle diffx 0 m r m mx 0 m by restricting the action of diffx 0 m to the appropriate subspaces we obtain the observer moduli spaces ms 0 x 0 m r s 0 m diffx 0 m m ric 0 x 0 m rric 0 m diffx 0 m of positive scalar and of positive ricci curvature metrics respectively the inclusions of spaces of metrics rric 0 m rs 0 m r m then induce the maps of principal diffx 0 m bundles 1 1 rric 0 m rs 0 m r m mric 0 x 0 m 1 ms 0 x 0 m 0 mx 0 m we denote 0 1 mric 0 x 0 m mx 0 m the fibre bundles 1 1 give rise to the following commutative diagram where the horizontal lines are serre fibrations 1 2 rric 0 m mric 0 x 0 m 1 mx 0 m id rs 0 m ms 0 x 0 m 0 mx 0 m 4 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith letting g 0 denote a base point metric in r m we consider the induced diagram of homotopy group homomorphisms below 1 3 i mric 0 x 0 m g 0 1 i mx 0 m g 0 id i ms 0 x 0 m g 0 0 i mx 0 m g 0 it is well known that an element in the homotopy group i mx 0 m g 0 can be represented by a smooth fibre bundle e si with a fibre m hence to show that such an element lies in the image of 0 it is enough to show that there exists a metric on the total space e which restricts to a psc metric on every fibre see 4 here our task is more difficult we have to construct such a metric on e which is fibre wise ricci positive and the methods used involve geometric constructions which are quite different from the positive scalar curvature case this is one of the reasons why we restrict our attention to the case when m sn next we focus on the geometrical properties of the moduli space mx 0 m 1 3 the universal fibre metric as we have mentioned earlier the observer moduli spacemx 0 m is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space bdiffx 0 m we say that a fibre bundle e x with fibre m is a smooth m fibre bundle if its structure group is a subgroup of diffx 0 m now we consider the universal principal bundle r m mx 0 m here the group diffx 0 m acts freely on r m and the borel construction gives the universal smooth m fibre bundle e m mx 0 m where e m r m diffx 0 m m recall that the space r m diffx 0 m m is defined as the quotient of r m m by the action of diffx 0 m given by h x 1 h x where diffx 0 m h r m and x m given that x is a paracompact hausdorff space recall that the isomorphism classes of principal diffx 0 m bundles over x are in one to one correspondence with homotopy classes x mx 0 m of maps x mx 0 m in particular given a map f x mx 0 m we obtain a commutative diagram ef e m x f mx 0 m where the bundle ef x is the pull back of the universal smooth m fibre bundle by the map f there is however a more refined structure which we can associate to such a bundle the total space e m r m diffx 0 m m admits a universal fibre metric which we will now define we begin with an arbitrary point h x r m diffx 0 m m the fibre at this point is of course diffeomorphic to m let us now consider the tangent space to this fibre suppose h x h x r m m both represent the point h x r m diffx 0 m m then the tangent spaces txm and tx m are isomorphically related by the derivative map of some diffeomorphism diffx 0 m which satisfies x x thus the tangent space to h x can be thought of as the isomorphic observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 5 identification of all tangent spaces tx m where x m lies in the orbit of x under the action of diffx 0 m suppose now that u v denote tangent vectors to the fibre at x h represented by tangent vectors u v txm we specify an inner product to the tangent space to the fibre at h x by the following formula u v x h hx u v where hx is the restriction of the riemannian metric h to the tangent space txm it is an easy exercise to show that this is well defined and varies smoothly over e m see 21 p 61 notice that this does not give a riemannian metric on e m as we only specify the inner product on fibres given a map f x mx 0 m this universal fibre metric then pulls back to a continuous fibrewise family of riemannian metrics on ef more precisely each fibre of the bundle ef x already diffeomorphic to m is now equipped with a riemannian metric which depends continuously on x clearly varying the map f by a homotopy alters the fibrewise metric structure of the bundle suppose on the other hand we begin with a fibrewise family of metrics on an m bundle over x identifying fibres non canonically with a standard copy of m and pulling back metrics leads to a well defined map x mx 0 m thus we obtain a one to one correspondence between maps x mx 0 m and fibrewise families of metrics on m which are parameterised by x assuming x is the sphere si we are now brought back to the homomorphism of homotopy groups i mric 0 x 0 m g 0 i mx 0 m g 0 induced by the inclusion mric 0 x 0 m mx 0 m let f s i mx 0 m represent an element of i mx 0 m g 0 this element determines and is determined by an m bundle ef si as above together with a fibrewise family of metrics on ef thus it is possible to lift this element of i mx 0 m g 0 to an element of i mric 0 x 0 m g 0 provided we can construct a fibrewise family of positive ricci curvature metrics on ef 1 4 the work of farrell and hsiang at this stage we have established that lifting an element of i mx 0 m g 0 to i mric 0 x 0 m g 0 involves the construction of a family of fiberwise ricci positive riemannian metrics on some bundle over si however we have not yet discussed the par ticular elements in the homotopy groups of mx 0 m which we plan to lift it is here that we recall a result of farrell and hsiang which identifies the rational homotopy groups of bdiffx 0 s n in a stable range using algebraic k theory and waldhausen k theory computations see 10 recall ing that mx 0 sn is homotopy equivalent to the classifying space bdiffx 0 sn the result of these computations can be stated as follows theorem 1 farrell and hsiang 10 for any m n there is an integer n m such that for all odd n n m and i 4 m imx 0 s n q q if n odd and i 0 mod 4 0 otherwise 6 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith thus for appropriate i we now have lots of non trivial groups i mx 0 sn g 0 q this also explains the hypotheses of the main theorem this leaves the question of which sn bundles over si i 0 mod 4 can represent the non trivial elements of i mx 0 sn g 0 q it turns out that these elements can be represented by so called hatcher bundles in section 3 we will provide a description of these based on the work of hatcher and goette see 12 our approach to the topological construction of hatcher bundles is guided by the geometric constructions we must subsequently perform namely the production of fibrewise ricci positive metrics these metric issues will be addressed in section 4 and will involve a generalized version of a powerful gluing theorem due to perelman perelman s theorem and our generalization of this is the subject of section 2 this work was initiated while the third named author was visiting the first and he would like to thank the university of oregon for their hospitality he would also like to thank sebastian goette for a useful discussion about hatcher bundles and janice love for her help with the maple code used in section 2 2 gluing manifolds and a theorem of perelman 2 1 the gluing construction the purpose of this section is to present a theorem of perelman which allows for the construction of ricci positive metrics on a closed manifold by gluing together certain ricci positive metrics on manifolds with boundary this result is the principal geometric tool used in achieving our goal of obtaining a fibrewise family of positive ricci curvature metrics on the total space of a hatcher bundle perelman s theorem is originally published in 19 and justified with a brief outline omitting the details our aim is to provide those details and in so doing offer a more comprehensive justification currently lacking in the literature for a very useful result in our experience this result is not widely known and we hope that by offering these details we will help provide some of the intuition behind the construction as well as bringing it to a potentially wider audience moreover these details are important for establishing the family version of perelman s theorem which appears at the end of this section we begin with a brief review of the notion of gluing smooth manifolds something we make extensive use of throughout the paper consider a pair of smooth n dimensional manifolds m 1 and m 2 each with non empty boundary we further assume that m 1 and m 2 are diffeomorphic via a diffeomorphism m 1 m 2 from this we may form the adjunction space w m 1 m 2 obtained as the quotient of m 1 tm 2 by identifying each x m 1 with x m 2 in particular the quotient map embeds both m 1 and m 2 into this space for simplicity then we identify m 1 and m 2 with their images in w and write x m 1 m 2 consider collar neighbourhoods m 1 0 and m 2 0 about x for some small 0 for example determined by the normal coordinate from m 1 m 2 with respect to some choice of metrics on m 1 m 2 denote by n the union of the images of these collar neighbourhoods in w we then have a homeomorphism observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 7 between x and n given by x r 7 m 1 r if r 0 m 1 r if r 0 where x x is the equivalence class x m 1 m 1 for some m 1 m 1 we can now use this to give n a differentiable structure by pulling back the standard dif ferentable structure on x via the inverse homeomorphism finally we extend this differ entiable structure over m 1 and m 2 to give a differentiable structure on w although there are many choices involved in this construction leading to many possible differentiable structures it is a well known fact that the diffeomorphism type of the resulting smooth manifold w is independent of these choices see 15 ch 8 sec 2 we now consider such a gluing in the riemannian setting m 1 m 2 x figure 1 the manifolds with boundary m 1 and m 2 left along with the adjunc tion space w and tubular neighborhood n of x w right equipping m 1 and m 2 with riemannian metrics h 1 and h 2 let us assume that the restrictions of these metrics to their respective boundaries are isometric via more precisely we assume h 1 m 1 h 2 m 2 this automatically leads to a well defined c 0 metric h h 1 h 2 on m 1 m 2 notice that this adjunction metric is smooth if and only if it is smooth in a collar neighbourhood of x m 1 m 2 in view of the of the adjunction space discussion above this will be the case if the metric h 1 m 1 0 glues smoothly with id 0 h 2 m 2 0 2 2 the theorem of perelman the above construction gives the c 0 metric h 1 h 2 on m 1 m 2 we will be interested in smoothing the metric h 1 h 2 within positive ricci curvature in the case where h 1 and h 2 individually have positive ricci curvature this is not always possible however the following theorem of perelman shows that under certain additional assumptions involving the normal i e the principal curvatures of h 1 and h 2 at the boundary such a smoothing can be performed theorem 2 let m 1 h 1 and m 2 h 2 be a pair of riemannian manifolds with positive ricci curvature and m 1 h 1 m 1 m 2 h 2 m 2 an isometry of their boundaries suppose that the normal curvatures of h 1 m 1 with respect to the outward normal are greater than the negatives of corresponding normal curvatures of h 2 m 2 with respect to its outward normal then the c 0 metric h h 1 h 2 on the smooth manifold m 1 m 2 can be replaced by a c metric with positive ricci curvature agreeing with h 1 and h 2 outside a neighbourhood of the glued boundaries 8 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith proof as above we will denote by x the hypersurface of m 1 m 2 along which m 1 and m 2 are joined and assume that the normal parameter through the hypersurface x gives rise to collar neighbourhoods m 2 0 in m 2 and m 1 0 in m 1 for some 0 since we will be working exclusively in a collar neighbourhood of x for convenience we can simply re label the metric id 0 h 2 m 2 0 by h 2 assume that m 1 m 2 and that is the identity map thus from now on we will write h 1 h 2 for the c 0 metric in the theorem and m 1 m 2 for the manifold we will introduce a parameter t normal to x running from m 1 to m 2 such that t 0 corresponds to x observe that m 1 m 2 has a smooth topological structure though not a smooth metric structure and that with respect to this t is a smooth parameter choose a small parameter 0 we will say more about an appropriate size for later our next task is to write down a new metric on x which joins with h 1 for t and h 2 for t to give a c 1 metric on m 1 m 2 this new metric will take the form dt 2 g t denoting by hi t where i 1 or 2 the induced metric on the hypersurface of constant distance t from x we will choose g t to be the following cubic expression in t 2 1 g t t 2 h 2 t 2 h 1 t 2 t 4 2 h 1 1 2 h 2 h 1 t 2 t 4 2 h 2 1 2 h 2 h 1 lemma 1 assume that the metrics h 1 h 2 satisfy the hypothesis from theorem 2 then there exists 0 such that i with g t as in 2 1 the metric dt 2 g t is smooth if t 6 0 and c 1 at t 0 ii ricdt 2 g t 0 proof of lemma 1 first we find the t derivative of this metric a straightforward calculation gives g t 1 2 h 2 h 1 2 t 2 2 t 2 4 2 h 1 1 2 h 2 h 1 2 t 2 2 t 2 4 2 h 2 1 2 h 2 h 1 it is now an easy exercise to check that the metric g forms a c 1 join with the hi at t the metric g is of course smooth our next task is to investigate the curvature properties of dt 2 g t we begin by assuming that the cubic expression for g t above holds in an open neighbourhood containing x motivated by the fact that curvature is a second derivative phenomenon an easy calculation shows that g t 1 4 2 6 t 2 h 1 1 2 h 2 h 1 1 4 2 6 t 2 h 2 1 2 h 2 h 1 observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 9 we will investigate the limiting behaviour of g as 0 at t we have 2 2 g 1 h 1 2 h 2 3 2 h 2 h 1 consider the term h 2 h 1 in 2 2 in the limit 0 we see by l ho pital s rule that the value of the limit is h 1 0 h 2 0 clearly the overall limit of the bracketed term in 2 2 is h 1 0 2 h 2 0 3 2 h 1 0 h 2 0 1 2 h 2 0 h 1 0 a similar calculation shows that the corresponding term in lim 0 g yields exactly the same expression next observe that g t has a linear dependence on t thus if g and g have the same sign then this sign persists for all t we will show that under the perelman normal curvature assumption the sign of both is negative provided is chosen sufficiently small 1 assume that is chosen so small that the topological product structure in a neighbourhood of x extends over t 2 2 let u be a fixed vector tangent to x at some point x 0 as u is independent of the metric given the product structure around x we can consider the same vector for nearby values of t i e we obtain a local vector field u along the line t x 0 define the normal curvature function k u to be k u u t u which is the normal curvature for the vector u of the hypersurface t constant with t providing the normal direction note that we do not insist that u is unit with respect to any metric but now observe that we can rearrange this definition to give k u 1 2 t u u which is just 1 2 g t u u differentiating with respect to t we obtain k u 1 2 g t u u the difference of the normal curvatures corresponding to u across x can be viewed as 2 3 1 2 lim 0 g u u g u u 1 2 h 1 0 h 2 0 denoting the normal curvatures at m 1 and m 2 with respect to the outward normals by k 1 k 2 it is straightforward to see that k 1 u limt 0 k u 1 2 limt 0 g t u u k 2 u limt 0 k u 12 limt 0 g t u u thus the difference of normal curvatures 2 3 is equal to k 1 u k 2 u now the perelman normal curvature assumption is that k 1 u k 2 u which means that the difference of normal curvatures is positive and hence lim 0 g 1 2 h 2 0 h 1 0 0 therefore by choosing sufficiently small we can bound g t u u as 2 4 g t u u a u where a is an arbitrarily large negative constant and the norm of u is taken with respect to h 1 or h 2 say as these are common on x in turn this means that k u can similarly be bounded above 1 notice what we have used so far for the c 1 cubic expression we require no assumptions in order to obtain the limiting formula for the second derivative we only need that the original metric on the union is continuous at t 0 10 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith the relevance of k u is that it can be re written in terms of the curvature tensor applied to u and t t and we can use the arbitrarily negative feature of k u to produce an arbitrarily large positive lower bound for r t u u t in detail we have k u t u t u t u t u u t tu t u t u s u 2 where s u denotes the shape operator of the hypersurfaces given by constant values of t and where we have used the fact that tu u t since t u 0 on the other hand we have r t u u t r t u t u t u t u u t t u t u t u as t t 0 thus we conclude that 2 5 r t u u t k u s u 2 in particular since k u 1 2 g u u and g t u u a u as in 2 4 for small enough 0 we can bound r t u u t below by any given positive constant the observation is now that any ricci curvature expression must contain this large positive term and we therefore get positive ricci curvature for the metric dt 2 g t provided we show that other curvature tensor expressions remain bounded it is easily checked that this boundedness reduces to showing that r ui uj uk is bounded above by some constant independent of for all vectors ui uj uk tangent to x which are unit with respect to say h 1 0 h 2 0 with the above curvature expression 2 5 in mind consider the derivatives of the metric g t in directions orthogonal to t the quantities h 1 h 1 h 2 h 2 and their derivatives can clearly be bounded independent of we also know that the other terms involving t 2 1 2 h 2 h 1 t 2 t 4 2 all remain bounded for t as 0 therefore the derivatives of g t orthogonal to t must stay bounded independent of we also claim that the first derivative of g t with respect to t is bounded independently of this follows from the above calculations involving g see 2 2 we showed that for sufficiently small the sign of g t u u is negative from which we see that the values of g t u u must lie between those at t and hence are bounded independent of we also notice that boundedness can then also be deduced for g t u v via the polarization formula for inner products we conclude that the norm r ui uj uk is bounded for all t independent of provided the curvature r ui uj uk does not depend on the second derivative of the metric with respect to t without loss of generality assume that ui uj uk are coordinate vector fields for some observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 11 coordinate system on x extended to a coordinate system in a neighbourhood of x by the parameter t the relevant expression for the components of r ui uj uk in terms of christoffel symbols is 2 6 rlijk i l jk j l ik n m 1 mjk l im m ik l jm where l runs over all possible subscripts including t since the christoffel symbols in 2 6 have at most one derivative with respect to t we obtain the desired boundedness property of r ui uj uk thus we fix small 0 so that the metric g t has positive ricci curvature and is smooth if t 6 0 and c 1 if t 0 this proves lemma 1 proof of theorem 2 continued our next goal is to show how to effect a c 2 smoothing of g t in some neighbourhoods of t as we will make a very general construction it will be convenient to locally re parameterize and work in an interval we start with an arbitrary c 1 function f t which is smooth away from t 0 and is defined in some open set of the real line containing given such function f t we will replace f t for t by a quintic polynomial p t which will agree to second order with f t at t by applying this idea to riemannian metrics we can create the desired c 2 metric by quintic interpolation in exactly the same way that we created a c 1 metric using a cubic interpolation let p t 5 n 0 cnt n and suppose that f a 0 f b 0 f a 1 f b 1 f a 2 f b 2 assuming that p i f i for i 0 1 2 yields a 5 5 linear system with the cn as the unknowns and the ai bi as coefficients solving this system using maple shows that the polynomial p t is uniquely determined by the above requirements and is equal to p t 2 a 2 b 2 3 a 1 b 1 3 a 0 b 0 16 5 t 5 a 2 b 2 a 1 b 1 16 3 t 4 2 a 2 b 2 5 a 1 b 1 5 a 0 b 0 8 3 t 3 a 2 b 2 3 a 1 b 1 8 t 2 2 a 2 b 2 7 a 1 b 1 15 a 0 b 0 16 t 2 a 2 b 2 5 a 1 b 1 16 a 0 b 0 2 2 7 with an eye towards curvature considerations when this quintic interpolation has been applied to riemannian metrics consider next the effect on p t for t of letting 0 as this limit is approached the term involving t 5 in the above expression for p t approaches 3 16 a 0 b 0 t 5 5 the t 3 term approaches 5 8 a 0 b 0 t 3 3 and the first order term in t contributes 15 16 a 0 b 0 t recall that t hence the limits of the t 5 t 3 and t terms are bounded by 3 16 a 0 b 0 58 a 0 b 0 and 15 16 a 0 b 0 respectively since t the degree four and two terms in t contribute nothing in the limit and the zeroth order term yields a 0 b 0 2 in our case we can say more however clearly the coefficients ai and bi are functions of i e ai ai and bi bi for i 0 1 2 and since f t is assumed c 1 at t 0 we see that lim 0 aj lim 0 bj f j 0 for j 0 1 thus we conclude that for sufficiently small the polynomial p t can c 0 approximate the constant function with value a 0 b 0 2 a 0 b 0 f 0 over the interval to within any desired degree 12 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith applying the same analysis to p t shows that for sufficiently small p t c 0 approximates the constant function with value a 1 b 1 2 a 1 b 1 f 0 over the interval to within any desired degree in other words by choosing sufficiently small p t will c 1 approximate f t over to within any desired accuracy finally we must consider the behaviour of p t analogous arguments to the above show that for sufficiently small p t can be c 0 approximated over to within any desired degree of accuracy by the cubic 2 8 5 4 a 2 b 2 t 3 3 3 4 a 2 b 2 t 1 2 a 2 b 2 to understand the behaviour of this cubic it clearly suffices to examine the function q t 5 3 t 3 3 t over t an elementary calculation shows that maximum and minimum values taken by q t over are q 2 respectively q 2 this function is depicted in fig 2 below 5 2 2 5 2 5 2 5 figure 2 the graph of the function q t thus the values of q t for all other t in this interval lie between the endpoint values it follows immediately that the same is true for p t with respect to its endpoint values lemma 2 let g t be the c 1 metric given by 2 1 where 0 is chosen so that ricdt 2 g t 0 then there exists small enough and a c 2 metric dt 2 g t such that i ricdt 2 g t 0 ii g t g t if t iii the metrics dt 2 g t and dt 2 g t are arbitrarily c 1 close on x proof of lemma 2 indeed we choose a coordinate system on x so that the metric g t is given by its components gij t which are smooth when t 6 0 and c 1 functions when t 0 then we use the polynomial 2 7 for each function gij t to obtain functions g ij t clearly by choosing sufficiently small we can bound the variation in the metric components g ij t and their first derivatives by an arbitrarily small constant whereas the second derivatives vary between their observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 13 values at the endpoints as curvature is a c 2 phenomenon which depends linearly on the second derivatives of the metric we see that any open convex curvature condition satisfied by both halves of the c 1 metric i e either side of t will continue to be satisfied by the resulting c 2 metric as is chosen to be sufficiently small since the positivity of the ricci curvature is an open and convex condition we deduce that the our c 2 metric dt 2 g t will have positive ricci curvature if is sufficiently small proof of theorem 2 continued it remains to smooth the metric from c 2 to c by general smoothing theory for functions we know that the set of c 2 functions on a smooth manifold is dense in the space of c functions see for theorem 2 6 of 15 thus we can make a c 2 arbitrarily small adjustment to our c 2 metric to render it smooth and in so doing ensure the positivity of the ricci curvature is preserved this proves theorem 2 theorem 2 immediately gives us the following corollary which will play a key role in section 4 corollary 1 the conclusion of theorem 2 holds if the normal curvatures at both boundaries with respect to the outward normals are all positive 2 3 a family version of perelman s theorem we will also need a family version of theorem 2 which allows us to perform simulataneous ricci positive smoothings on the fibres of a bundle theorem 3 let i ei b i 1 2 be smooth compact fibre bundles with fibre mi where mi 6 suppose that each of these bundles is equipped with a smoothly varying family of fibrewise ricci positive metrics hi b b b and that with respect to these metrics there is a smoothly varying family of fibrewise isometries b b b for the boundary bundles i ei b with fibre mi that is b 1 1 b 12 b for each b b then provided the normal curvatures of h 1 b 11 b with respect to the outward normal are always greater than the negatives of corresponding normal curvatures of h 2 b 12 b with respect to its outward normal the fibrewise c 0 metric h h 1 b b h 2 b b b on e 1 e 2 can be smoothed within fibrewise positive ricci curvature in such a way that the resulting metric agrees with the original ouside a neighbourhood of the glued boundaries proof the key observation is that in the proof of theorem 2 the c 2 smoothing constructed there only depends on the metrics together with two small positive parameters and now suppose we have a smooth variation of the metrics on m 1 and m 2 which nevertheless always satisfies the requirements of theorem 2 it is clear that the first chosen parameter in the construction which together with the given metrics determines the c 1 smoothing can be chosen to vary continuously with the metric similarly the second parameter needed to construct the c 2 smoothing can be chosen to vary continuously with the metrics and in the situation of the current theorem it follows from the above observations and the com pactness of b that we can make uniform choices for and which will work for all fibres in our bundles e 1 and e 2 having made these choices the c 2 metric smoothing performed after gluing each pair of fibres is then completely determined by the metrics on these fibres moreover since this 14 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith is a smoothing by polynomials it follows trivially that the resulting metrics will vary smoothly from fibre to fibre finally the same argument as employed at the end of the proof of theorem 2 shows that our fibrewise ricci positive metric on e 1 e 2 can be smoothed to class c within fibrewise positive ricci curvature we could always extend our fibrewise c 2 metric to a global c 2 metric for which the intrinsic fibre metrics have positive ricci curvature this can then be globally smoothed by a c 2 arbitrarily small deformation preserving the intrinsic positive ricci curvature on the fibres then restricting to the fibres yields the desired smooth fibrewise metric 3 hatcher bundles 3 1 goette s theorem the aim of this section is to review the construction and properties of certain smooth sn bundles over si known as hatcher bundles in short a hatcher bundle e si is a smooth sn bundle determined by an element ker j where j i 1 o p i 1 psp is the j homomorphism and where 0 p n a hatcher bundle e si has structure group diffx 0 sn and thus is classified by some map f s i bdiffx 0 sn we then say that a hatcher bundle e si represents the element f ibdiffx 0 sn below we identify bdiffx 0 sn mx 0 sn in the introduction we stated a theorem of farrell and hsiang theorem 1 concerning the rational homotopy groups imx 0 sn q in fact each element of those groups may be represented by a hatcher bundle theorem 4 see 12 section 5 suppose that n and k satisfy the hypotheses of theorem 1 so 4 kmx 0 sn q q for such k and n then for each element f 4 kmx 0 sn q there is an integer p with 0 p n and an element ker j where j i 1 o p i 1 psp is the j homomorphism such that the hatcher bundle e represents the element f we recall that the key feature of these bundles is that they are exotic smooth sn bundles in the sense that each one is homeomorphic to but not diffeomorphic to the trivial bundle si sn si we will develop goette s construction so as to provide the appropriate setting for our geometric arguments in the next section an in depth description of these bundles and their properties is given in 12 and we refer the reader to this paper for further details 3 2 preliminary constructions throughout this section we will assume that n is odd and is sufficiently large for all of our purposes the groups imx 0 sn q are trivial unless i 4 k for appropriate k and so we will consider only bundles which have base manifold s 4 k and fibre sn let us begin with the trivial bundle s 4 k sn s 4 k by decomposing the fibre sphere sn into a pair of northern and southern hemispherical discs dn and d n we can decompose the entire bundle into a pair of disc bundles s 4 k dn s 4 k and s 4 k dn s 4 k glued together in the obvious way thus the trivial bundle s 4 k sn s 4 k can be regarded as the double of the trivial disc bundle s 4 k dn s 4 k we will always assume that discs are closed unless otherwise stated to construct a hatcher bundle we will make certain adjustments to the trivial dn bundle over s 4 k to obtain a smooth bundle which is homeomorphic to but not diffeomorphic to the trivial observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 15 disc bundle we will then form the double of this exotic dn bundle to obtain the desired exotic sn bundle over s 4 k which will represent a non trivial element of 4 kmx 0 sn q we begin with the trivial disc bundle s 4 k dn s 4 k the fibre dn decomposes as dn dp 1 dq dp 1 dq sp 1 dq where p q 1 n 0 1 and dp 1 dq is a smaller version of the original disc product with the dp 1 factor having radius surrounded by an annular region sp 1 dq the integers p and q may be assumed to be positive in fact at various stages in the construction it is necessary to allow both p and q to be large it will be convenient for later considerations to reorder the factors and write the annular region as sp dq 1 henceforth we will denote this by a and the remaining piece dp 1 dq by p 2 thus as illustrated in fig 3 below we have dn a p the regions a and p share a common piece of boundary sp dq and are glued together dn dp 1 dq a sp dq 1 p dp 1 dq figure 3 the decomposition of the fibre disc dn into a and p via the identity map on sp dq the trivial bundle s 4 k dn s 4 k therefore can be thought of as a union of sub bundles s 4 k a s 4 k and s 4 k p s 4 k glued together in the obvious way from now on we will write ay y a and py y p to denote the fibres at y s 4 k of the respective sub bundles s 4 k a s 4 k and s 4 k p s 4 k below we will specify a smooth diffeomorphism 3 1 y s p dq sp dq over each y s 4 k where the domain is dp 1 dq py and the target space is the product sp dq ay the idea will be to replace the identity map on sp dq which glues py to ay to form d p 1 dq with the map y before we can begin the construction we will need a further decomposition that of the base manifold s 4 k into northern and southern hemispherical discs s 4 k d 4 k d 4 k over the disc d 4 k we take the trivial bundle d 4 k dn d 4 k that is we define the map y to be the identity map on sp dq for all y d 4 k we therefore need to specify the maps y for y d 4 k 2 this smaller product of discs resembles an ice hockey puck hence the notation 16 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith in order to describe the bundle over d 4 k and finally we need to show how to glue the two bundles together over s 4 k 1 d 4 k d 4 k over the disc d 4 k we will actually work with a slightly different though topologically equiva lent annulus ay which we will define below we will also work with diffeomorphisms y as above however we must adjust the target space to lie in the boundary of ay gluing the py to ay creates a fibre bundle over d 4 k with fibres py y ay in order to make these constructions let us first suppose we have a collection of embeddings y s p dq sp dq for y d 4 k which vary smoothly with y for any given y d 4 k the image of the embedding y figure 4 an embedding y from s p dq left into sp dq right which we denote im y is schematically depicted in fig 4 we will define the annulus ay by ay y im y 1 y sp dq 1 we will furthermore define the diffeomorphism y to be simply the map y with target space im y thus we can glue py to ay using y by identifying the points y x y sp dq py and y y x y im y ay where x sp dq the spaces py and ay as a subset of y sp dq 1 are depicted in fig 5 below applying this gluing fibrewise for all y d 4 k gives rise to the desired bundle over d 4 k for convenience we will denote the bundles over d 4 k by e d 4 k we claim that for each figure 5 the spaces py left and ay as a subset of sp dq 1 right observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 17 y d 4 k we have a canonical diffeomorphism dp 1 dq py id ay py y ay to this end define a map y ay ay by setting y y id 1 where we are viewing ay s p dq 1 and ay im y 1 using this map we can define a further map y py id ay py y ay by 3 2 y z z z py y z z ay it is clear that y is a homeomorphism for each y following the discussion on adjunction spaces at the start of section 2 or see 15 chapter 8 section 2 we see that with respect to the canonical differentiable structure on py y ay y is actually a diffeomorphism thus the exotic structure which hatcher bundles display does not occur at the level of individual fibres it is a global bundle phenomenon 3 3 recollection of the j homomorphism here we follow 12 to construct the family of em beddings y s p dq 1 sp dq 1 for y d 4 k as above this requires us to consider the j homomorphism which is a map j 4 k 1 o p 4 k 1 psp where p is sufficiently large 3 we can think of the j homomorphism as follows consider a map s 4 k 1 o p determined by a choice of element 4 k 1 o p by the whitney approximation theorem without loss of generality we can assume that is smooth this then determines a map s 4 k 1 rp rp by sending a point y z to the orthogonal transformation y o p applied to z rp since sp rp x 0 it is convenient to identify with a map s 4 k 1 c sp sp where c x y is a space with compact open topology of continuous maps x y preserving base points it will also be convenient to denote by y s p sp the map evaluated at y s 4 k 1 passing to homotopy classes gives a map 4 k 1 o p 4 k 1 c sp sp and composing this with an isomorphism 4 k 1 c sp sp 4 k 1 psp then gives the j homomorphism recall that for p sufficiently large compared to k the groups 4 k 1 o p and 4 k 1 ps p are independent of p and 4 k 1 ps p is a finite group while 4 k 1 o p is infinite cyclic choose a map s 4 k 1 o p such that 6 0 and ker j this means that extends to a map d 4 k c s p sp where d 4 k is a disc of radius 1 we can assume that restricted to the collar s 4 k 1 1 2 1 d 4 k coincides with the product map id for any q 4 k we denote by sp sp dq the inclusion 3 here we assume that a base point in sp is the north pole 18 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith x 7 x 0 the map and its extension give a commutative diagram 3 3 s 4 k 1 sp i id sp id sp dq id d 4 k sp sp sp dq where i is the inclusion of the boundary s 4 k 1 d 4 k lemma 3 for sufficiently large q we can approximate the map by a smoothly varying family of smooth embeddings 3 4 y s p sp dq y d 4 k which retain the property that for y s 4 k 1 1 2 1 d 4 k the maps y agree with y proof we begin by recalling that the map s 4 k 1 o p is assumed to be smooth by applying the whitney approximation theorem to viewed as a map d 4 k sp sp see for example 18 theorem 6 19 we see that by a c 0 arbitrarily small homotopy relative to a boundary neighbourhood in the domain we can adjust this map to be smooth thus without loss of generality we may as well assume in the first place that d 4 k sp sp is smooth to construct the embeddings y s p sp dq we first let sp dq be an arbitrary embedding of the sphere into a ball dq rq centered at the origin and denote by the composition consisting of followed by a scaling of dq onto itself by a factor of 0 the embedding clearly exists provided that q p 1 next we introduce a function d 4 k r which is identically zero in a small neighbourhood of the boundary of d 4 k within the region in which is independent of the radial parameter is strictly positive otherwise and is everywhere smooth finally set d 4 k sp sp dq to be the map y x 7 y x y x it is now immediate that this restricts to give a smoothly varying family of smooth embeddings y s p sp dq by virtue of the fact that is an embedding moreover these embeddings clearly agree with y for y close to the boundary of d 4 k since vanishes in this region denote by ny sp the normal bundle of the embedding y considering all y d 4 k we obtain a vector bundle n d 4 k sp since ny sp is a trivial bundle the bundle n d 4 k sp is also trivial then by fixing a trivialization of n and using the normal exponential map we extend the family of embeddings 3 4 to the family of embeddings 3 5 y s p dq sp dq y d 4 k lemma 4 12 proposition 5 4 the family of embeddings 3 5 is smoothly isotopic to a family of embeddings sp dp sp dq which restricts over s 4 k 1 d 4 k to give linear transformations 3 6 x z 7 y x 1 y idrp q z s p dq y s 4 k 1 observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 19 remark according to lemma 4 we can assume that the family of embeddings 3 5 satisfies the condition 3 6 we notice also that 3 6 implies that im y coincides with y sp dq ay in particular we can assume that 3 7 ay ay if y d 4 k is near the boundary d 4 k now recall that the embeddings y give rise to the desired family of diffeomorphisms y which by definition coincide with the maps y when the target space is restricted to im y this completes the construction of the bundle e d 4 k we conclude this section with the result below which follows from the proof of lemma 3 corollary 2 the diffeomorphisms y s p dq sp dq are determined by their restriction to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the sphere sp 0 sp dq py and its image in ay for each y d 4 k proof we merely have to observe that in the proof of lemma 3 we can choose the embedding so that its image is contained in an arbitrarily small ball about the origin in dq and we can choose the function to have an arbitrarily small upper bound 3 4 the hatcher bundle e it remains to describe how the bundle e d 4 k is to be glued to the trivial disc bundle e d 4 k along the boundary of the base discs d 4 k d 4 k s 4 k 1 recall that each disc fibre is the union of an annulus and a puck and according to 3 7 we can assume the annulus parts ay of the fibres are equal to ay near the boundary of d 4 k we can therefore begin by gluing the annulus parts ay and ay of the fibres at the boundary of e and e via the identity map to glue the puck part of the fibres we observe that according to lemma 4 the maps y s p dq sp dq defined above are products of rotations for each y near to d 4 k thus the y extend to diffeomorphisms y py py for such y using the rotations 3 6 we use the y to glue the puck sub bundles of e to e for y s 4 k 1 noting that this is consistent with the gluing of the annuli the disc bundle over s 4 k which results from this gluing we will denote by e since it ultimately depends on our choice of ker j as noted at the start of this section we can then double this disc bundle to produce a desired hatcher bundle e e e over s 4 k it can be shown that e is bundle homeomorphic but not bundle diffeomorphic to the corre sponding trivial bundle see 12 proposition 5 8 theorem 5 13 and 14 section 1 4 the fibrewise ricci positive metric construction 4 1 foreword in this section we will ultimately prove main theorem as discussed in section 1 this reduces to showing that a hatcher bundle admits a fiberwise ricci positive metric our general strategy is to show the existence of fiberwise ricci positive metrics on the hatcher disc bundles constructed in the last section and then use the family version of the perelman gluing result theorem 3 to glue two copies of such a disc bundle together within ricci positivity to create 20 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith the desired object in order to perform this gluing we need to consider the normal curvatures at the boundary of the disc fibres there is an immediate problem however with the boundary of the discs these were constructed as products dp 1 dq thus as written each of these is a manifold with corners moreover in order for these discs to be equipped with ricci positive metrics it is natural to consider product metrics which respect the topological product structure the resulting boundary is not smooth however and we need a smooth boundary in order to apply the perelman gluing technique in order to deal with this issue our approach is to cut out a solid ellipsoid from within the product of discs see fig 6 this will be constructed to have a smooth boundary and normal curvatures at the boundary with respect to the outward normal which are all positive thus provided the ambient metric on the product of discs has positive ricci curvature we can glue two such ellipsoids together using the perelman gluing technique our main task in this section is therefore to show how to construct such an ellipsoid and prove that it has the desired properties to avoid any confusion with indices it is convenient to work with the product dm dn where the role of m and n is symmetric we specify the formulas for m p 1 n q at the end of the section when we will prove main theorem figure 6 the solid ellipsoid contained in dm dn 4 2 the metric on dm dn first we will consider the following metric on dm dn h ds 2 2 s ds 2 m 1 dt 2 2 t ds 2 n 1 where s and t are the radial parameters in the discs dm and dn respectively in our later metric constructions we will use a slight variant of this metric let us assume that the radii of the two discs are s 1 and t 1 respectively we will impose the following conditions on the smooth warping functions and are odd in a small neighbourhood of s 0 respectively t 0 or rather one can extend and to negative values of s and t such that this extended function is smooth and odd and in particular 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 and 0 whenever s respectively t is positive s 0 for all s 0 s 1 and t 0 for all t 0 t 1 observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 21 t s figure 7 coordinates on the space x dm dn it follows easily from the warped product formulas for ricci curvature that these conditions ensure that the metric h has strictly positive ricci curvature see for example 1 section 9 j 4 3 specifying the ellipsoid in order to construct the ellipsoid we introduce a unit speed curve r into the s t plane this curve will have the profile given in fig 8 notice that the illustrated curve separates the rectangle 0 s 1 0 t 1 into two regions and suppose that the parameter r is such that 0 0 t 0 and r 0 s 0 0 for some s 0 0 s 1 and t 0 0 t 1 we will define the ellipsoid e to be the subset of dp 1 dq consisting of all elements whose s and t coordinates lie in the region on or below this curve 0 s 0 s t t 0 t figure 8 the curve which gives rise to the ellipsoid e we need to specify in more detail and to this end we will write r s r t r let us impose the following conditions on s t 1 s 0 0 s r 0 s 0 s 0 1 s r 0 0 s r 0 for all r 0 r 0 s is odd in a neighbourhood of r 0 and even locally about the point r r 0 in the sense that there is a smooth extension such that s r 0 s r 0 for all sufficiently small 0 2 t 0 t 0 t r 0 0 t 0 0 t r 0 1 t r 0 for all r 0 r 0 t is even about the point r 0 and odd in a neighbourhood of r r 0 22 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith given a unit speed curve satisfying 1 and 2 above we need to check that the resulting ellipsoid has a smooth boundary firstly it is clear from the smoothness of all the functions involved that this boundary will indeed be smooth everywhere except possibly when r 0 or r r 0 we must therefore check the corresponding ends of the ellipsoid for smoothness with this in mind we begin by observing that the metric induced by h on the ellipsoid is 4 1 he dr 2 2 s r ds 2 m 1 2 t r ds 2 n 1 given that s 0 0 t r 0 0 and that s t 0 otherwise we see immediately from the form of the metric he that this is a not necessarily smooth metric on a sphere of dimension m n 1 the boundary conditions which such a metric must satisfy in order to give a smooth sphere metric are well known see for example 20 section 1 4 the scaling funtions s r and t r must obey the following rules i be everywhere non negative with s r 0 if and only if r 0 and t r 0 if and only if r r 0 ii s r must be odd at r 0 and even at r r 0 iii t r must be even at r 0 and odd at r r 0 iv the derivative of s r must take the value 1 at r 0 and that of t r must take the value 1 at r r 0 property i follows immediately from the conditions imposed on s t for property iii we note that by definition t r is odd at r r 0 and t is odd at t 0 and it follows trivially from this that the composition t r is odd at r r 0 for the evenness requirement it suffices to note that the composition of an even function followed by an arbitrary function is trivially even property ii follows by similar arguments finally property iv follows by the chain rule since 0 s 0 1 and 0 t r 0 1 in summary then we have demonstrated how to choose a unit speed curve such that the resulting ellipsoid is smooth and we will work with the same subset of dp 1 dq for each fibre of the hatcher disc bundle when we construct the fiberwise metric later in this section 4 4 normal curvatures of the ellipsoid the other issue we need to address in relation to the perelman gluing of discs or rather ellipsoids is that of the normal curvatures at the boundary as observed previously corollary 1 it will suffice if these normal curvatures are all positive with respect to the outward pointing normal it turns out however that the normal curvatures of the ellipsoid we have constructed are only non negative with respect to the ambient metric h in particular the normal curvatures vanish at the points of the ellipsoid corresponding to r 0 and r r 0 to rectify this situation we work with the same ellipsoid but a slightly modified metric on dm dn let us define a metric g on dm dn as follows 4 2 g 2 t ds 2 2 t 2 s ds 2 m 1 2 s dt 2 2 s 2 t ds 2 n 1 the new functions introduced here t and s are chosen so as to satisfy the following properties a t 0 for all t 0 t 1 t 0 0 t 1 in a neighbourhood of t 0 observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 23 b s 0 for all s 0 s 1 s 0 0 s 1 in a neighbourhood of s 0 we will see that the positivity of the derivatives of and at t 0 respectively s 0 is enough to give us strictly positive normal curvatures globally of course we must not forget that the metric g must have positive ricci curvature by the openness of the positivity condition we can choose and satisfying a and b above sufficiently close in a c 2 sense to the constant function with value 1 so that ric g 0 we therefore add a third condition c and are such that ric g 0 at least in some neighbourhood of e lemma 5 the normal curvatures at the boundary of the ellipsoid e are all stricly positive with respect to the ambient metric g proof we work locally and begin by fixing a point x 1 s 1 a 1 t 1 b 1 e where a 1 sm 1 and b 1 sn 1 about the points a 1 and b 1 introduce normal coordinate systems locally into sm 1 and sn 1 together with the s and t coordinates these combine to give a local coordinate system in dm dn with respect to these coordinates we can represent g by the block diagonal matrix g 2 t 2 s 2 t 2 s am 1 2 s 2 t bn 1 where am 1 and bn 1 represent ds 2 n 1 respectively ds 2 m 1 with respect to the chosen normal coordinate systems on the spheres note that at the the points a 1 and b 1 am 1 and bn 1 are both identity matrices and have vanishing first derivatives hence at the point x 1 we have gij 6 0 if and only if i j gii 1 gii and the derivatives gij k 0 whenever k is a direction tangent to s m 1 or sn 1 we will assume that all computations below are carried out at this point using the formula kij 1 2 gkl gil j gjl i gij l it is straightforward to compute the corresponding christoffel symbols the list below consists of precisely those christoffel symbols which are non zero beginning with the case when each of the indices i j and k are s or t we have the following sst s ts t t stt s s 2 t tss t t 2 s tst t ts s s then using the symbols a and b to represent any of the coordinate functions on sm 1 or sn 1 respectively we list the remaining non zero christoffel symbols saa s s asa a as s s taa t t 2 s 2 s ata a at t t sbb s s 2 t 2 t bsb b bs s s tbb t t btb b bt t t 24 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith from this we compute certain covariant derivatives involving coordinate vector fields s t a and b which will we will make use of shortly in particular we see that at the point x 1 we have s s t t 2 s t t t s s 2 t s s t t s t t s s s t t a a t a s a a s a t b b t b s b b s b a a 2 2 t s b b 2 2 s t and a b b a 0 the statement that all normal curvatures are positive is clearly equivalent to the statement that the second fundamental form is positive definite we will compute second fundamental forms and will break up the computation into directions tangent to sm 1 sn 1 and tangent to the curve notice that r is everywhere tangent to the boundary of the ellipsoid and this direction is orthogonal with respect to g to both sm 1 and sn 1 explicitly we have t r r s r s t r t it is easy to see that the outward normal vector to the ellipsoid lies in the s t plane if we represent it as n cs s ct t then it is clear that the coefficients cs ct are functions of r moreover it is evident from our choice of that cs r 0 0 ct 0 0 and that cs ct 0 otherwise the second fundamental form ii u v is defined by ii u v g uv n thus in order to show positive definiteness it suffices to establish that the components of uu in the s and t directions are non positive at least one of the coefficients is negative for all r 0 r 0 at r 0 where ct 0 we need the coefficient of s to be negative and at r r 0 where cs 0 we need the coefficient of t to be negative of course if u tsm 1 then we must automatically have r 0 else this sphere is not defined and similarly we need r r 0 if u tsn 1 consider first a tsm 1 from the covariant derivative expressions above we observe that the coefficient of s namely is non positive and strictly negative for all r 0 r 0 however it vanishes at r r 0 we have r 0 in order for the vector a to make sense as noted above the coefficient of t is 2 2 and this is clearly non negative but negative at r r 0 since t 0 0 by definition thus we have ii a a 0 as required analogous arguments apply for ii b b next we investigate tt we have tt s s s s s 2 s s s s t t s t s t t t s s t s t s t t t t t 2 t t in order to simplify this expression we note that by definition of the coordinate functions s r and t r are one to one and therefore invertible viewing s as a function of r along we clearly observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 25 have s r s r and hence r s 1 s s differentiating with respect to s then yields s s r s s 1 s s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s s r s r analogous computations give 4 3 s t t s t s s t t t t t it follows immediately that 4 4 s s s s s s t t t t s s t t t t notice that for the above calucations to be valid as stated we must assume that s t 6 0 this is fine precisely when r 0 r 0 however observe that the right hand sides of the expressions 4 4 are defined for all r 0 r 0 and we can infer from this that the limits as r 0 and r r 0 in 4 3 must be well behaved we can now use the above calculations to simplify the expression for tt tt s 2 s s 2 2 2 s t s t 2 t t 2 2 2 s t in each of the above brackets notice that the terms are negative non positive and non positive respectively it follows that ii t t 0 as required it remains then to consider mixed terms that is ii v w where v and w belong to two of the three basic directions in e namely tsm 1 tsn 1 and span t we see from the covariant derivative expressions above that vw wv 0 if v tsm 1 and w tsn 1 and hence in this case we have ii v w 0 for this v and w we also have tv v and tw w and so ii t v g v n 0 similarly with s in place of t thus the mixed terms of ii all vanish and hence we can conclude that ii is positive definite as required let us summarise the above constructions proposition 1 there is a ricci positive metric g on dm dn and a codimension zero solid ellipsoid e dm dn such that e is a smooth submanifold of dm dn and the normal curvatures of e with respect to the outward pointing normal are all positive 4 5 proof of the main theorem recall from section 1 that to establish the theorem it suffices to construct a fiberwise ricci positive metric on each hatcher sphere bundle in order to do this we will begin by reconsidering the construction of the hatcher disc bundle from section 3 now we switch to the relevant notations i e m p 1 and n q for each point y d 4 k we have dp 1 dq py id ay y py y ay 26 boris botvinnik mark g walsh and david j wraith where we refer the reader to section 3 for the notation the ellipsoid e is a subset of dp 1 dq and so for each y d 4 k there is an ellipsoid ey y e py y ay collectively these ellipsoid fibres form a sub bundle eell of e pushing forward the metric g via y and restricting to ey equips each ey with a ricci positive metric with positive normal curvatures with respect to the outward normal at the boundary moreover as y varies across d 4 k we obtain in this way a smoothly varying family of fibre metrics on eell we similarly form a product bundle eell d 4 k with total space d 4 k e and take the obvious fiberwise metric where each fibre e is equipped with the metric induced by g for each fibre ey eell notice that we have a decomposition ey ey py ey ay and similarly for the fibres of eell in order to form the hatcher disc bundle we need to glue the bundles eell and e ell along the boundaries of their base discs the procedure for gluing the full disc bundles e and e is described at the end of section 3 recall that for each pair of fibres in e and e being identified the annulus parts are identified via the identity map but the inner puck regions are identified using diffeomorphisms y py py which by lemma 4 split as a product of rotations on the two disc factors before proceeding further we note that these gluing maps restrict to give gluing maps between eell and e ell since the annulus and puck parts of the respective ellipsoid bundles agree near the boundary of the base discs and are invariant under rotation of the factors note further that by corollary 2 in section 3 we do not lose any gluing information by reducing the fibres from the original product of discs considered in section 3 to the ellipsoids currently under consideration thus the bundle we will construct using eell and e ell will be diffeomorphic to that formed from e and e from a metric perspective let us focus first on the puck sub bundles as y is the identity mapping on py the puck sub bundle within eell is just a product with each fibre equipped with the restriction of g now the metric g displays rotational symmetry with respect to both disc factors and so pulling back g py via the map y results in a metric identical to g py since we have set things up so that the metrics near the boundaries of both e and e are independent of the radial parameter in the base we see that gluing the puck sub bundles along s 4 k 1 in this way yields a smooth fiberwise metric it is perhaps worth remarking that if we were trying to construct a submersion metric on the whole hatcher disc bundle as opposed to creating a mere fiberwise metric then the twisting involved in gluing the bundles e and e would have non trivial metric implications in directions transverse to the fibres turning our attention to the gluing of the annular regions we similarly observe that the metric on the annuli close to the boundary of e is a push forward via y of the rotationally symmetric metric g ay although y acts non trivially on the annuli it nevertheless acts by rotation in both observer moduli space of ricci positive metrics 27 sm 1 and sn 1 directions for y close to d 4 k thus the pull back metric on the annuli is identical to the original over the boundary of the base disk and so gluing the annular part of e to e via the identity creates a smooth fiberwise metric in the annular region also in summary we have created a smooth fibrewise ricci positive metric on the fibres of the hatcher disc bundle e e e it is immediate that restricting everything in the above argument to the ellipsoid sub bundles eell and eell creates a fiberwise ricci positive metric on the ellipsoid sub bundle of the hatcher disc bundle eell e with the normal curvatures at the boundary of each fibre being positive with respect to the outer normal finally we wish to glue two identical copies of the hatcher disc bundle eell equipped with the above fiberwise metric so as to construct the desired hatcher sphere bundle metrically this is now possible using the family gluing result theorem 3 as a consequence of the positive normal curvatures at the boundary we thus create a hatcher sphere bundle with a smooth fibrewise ricci positive metric as required to establish the theorem references 1 a besse einstein manifolds springer verlag 2002 2 b botvinnik j ebert d j wraith on the topology of the space of ricci positive
