classical differential geometry a central question has been whether abstract surfaces with given geometric features can be realized as surfaces in euclidean space early results include hilbert s proof that no complete surface with constant negative curvature can be immersed isometrically in euclidean space 6 and the theorem of hartmann nirenberg that a complete hypersurface of constant zero curvature in n 1 euclidean space is an n 1 cylinder 5 in this paper we are particularly interested in the constraints that the conformal structure of a surface along with other geometric features puts on possible realizations of the surface in euclidean space this question has been well studied in cases where the connection between surface geometry and conformal type is particularly strong for example in minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces here we address this problem for another class of surfaces surfaces with cone metrics two fundamental results are the following from 13 and 1 respectively theorem schwarz christoffel troyanov let x be a compact riemann surface and p 1 pn be finitely many points on x let 1 n be positive numbers so that 2 x n i 1 i 2 then there exists a conformal flat metric on x with cone angles i at pi for each i the metric is unique up to homothety theorem aleksandrov any cone metric of positive curvature on the 2 sphere can be realized by the boundary of a convex body in euclidean space little is known in other cases inspired by the rich theory of embedded triply periodic minimal surfaces we seek examples of triply periodic polyhedral surfaces in euclidean space that have an identifiable conformal structure in particular we are interested in explicit cone metrics on compact riemann surfaces that have a realization as the quotient of a triply periodic polyhedral surface in euclidean space via the cone metrics we can derive holo morphic 1 forms algebraic equations and a hyperbolic structure this is important because riemann surfaces with equivalent descriptions are rare they can be used to construct ex amples in areas including billiards hyperbolic length spectrum and minimal surfaces the non periodic case of genus zero is answered by troyanov and aleksandrov to some extent as a way to obtain cases for higher genera we devise a construction method for triply periodic polyhedral surfaces that are potentially highly symmetric in 9 lee investigates an example of a triply periodic polyhedral surface whose vertices are weierstrass points in section 2 we summarize the paper and discuss the surface s geometric construction in r 3 and its abstract quotient surface due to its many symmetries on the underlying surface we can identify its hyperbolic structure specifically it is identified as an eightfold cyclically 2 branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere as a result we carry out explicit com putations regarding cone metrics basis of holomorphic 1 forms automorphisms algebraic descriptions etc furthermore we reach the following theorem theorem 9 the conformal structure on the underlying surface of the octa 4 is confor mally equivalent to the fermat s quartic this motivates us to investigate other cyclically branched covers over punctured spheres in section 3 we study cyclically branched covers over punctured spheres in detail interest ing results include the construction of cyclically branched covers over punctured spheres and a finiteness theorem theorem 3 2 influenced by the theory of triply periodic minimal surfaces we are also interested in geometric realizations of such coverings in section 4 we use graph theory to develop construction methods on building triply periodic polyhedral surfaces we define a decoration definition 4 3 of a graph as a polyhedron that is homotopy equivalent to the graph this is an attempt to make schoen s heuristic concept of a dual graph rigorous 12 this construction method enables us to expand coxeter petrie s classification of infinite regular polyhedral surfaces in 3 definition 1 1 a polyhedral surface is regular if it is tiled by regular p gons with q of them at each vertex a feature that was included in coxeter petrie s classification was to let the polygonal faces go up and down in a zig zag formation as a result they introduced three triply pe riodic regular polyhedra named the mucube muoctahedron and mutetrahedron on these polyhedra there exist two types of symmetry one that permutes the vertices of a face and another that permutes the faces that meet at a vertex the surfaces divide euclidean space into an inside and an outside compartment and the two symmetries mentioned above interchange the inside and outside it is proved in 3 that these three are the only possible cases fairly similar is the octa 4 surface as it is a regular polyhedral surface tiled by regular triangles eight at each vertex however the octa 4 surface is not included in coxeter petrie s classification as it does not carry the zig zag formation of the triangles because of this it lacks the euclidean symmetries that interchange the inside and outside compartments nevertheless the compact quotient of all four surfaces are all genus three surfaces whose corresponding conformally equivalent hyperbolic surfaces are highly symmet ric we achieve a hyperbolic tessellation for each surface by mapping the euclidean polygons to hyperbolic polygons and the two symmetries mentioned above generate a group that acts transitively on the hyperbolic tessellations with the many symmetries on the hyperbolic surfaces we take the quotient of the surfaces by their symmetries with symmetries specif ically rotations the quotients become spheres hence we say that the surfaces are branched coverings over spheres we combine the theory of cyclically branched coverings over punc tured spheres to identify the conformal type of each surface the tools that we use include flat structures on riemann surfaces hyperbolic geometry and algebraic geometry the contents of this paper is as follows in section 2 we look into the octa 4 surface as our leading example we build a triply periodic polyhedron by regular octahedra whose 3 boundary yields the octa 4 surface we identify the hyperbolic structure of the underlying surface as an eightfold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere then we identify the automorphism group of the underlying surface in section 3 we develop the theory of cyclically branched covers we study the topological construction of such abstract surfaces and prove that there can be finitely many such coverings with a given genus then we study maps between punctured spheres and their lifts on their coverings in addition we look at lifts of cone metrics that induce holomorphic 1 forms on their coverings and lastly we study wronski metrics to find weierstrass points on the underlying surfaces we will also be able to locate the weierstrass points on the polyhedral surfaces in euclidean space in section 4 we broaden the classification of infinite regular polyhedral surfaces to find more examples alike the octa 4 we discuss triply periodic symmetric graphs of lower genera and formulate a decoration of a graph as a method to construct a triply periodic polyhedral surface from a triply periodic graph we end the section with classification theorems theo rem 4 1 and theorem 4 2 that find all genus three and four triply periodic regular polyhedral surfaces that arise as decorations of graphs finally in section 5 we will study examples from theorem 4 1 and theorem 4 2 whose cone metrics on their underlying surfaces have realizations as cyclically branched covers over punctured spheres results include examples that shed new light on existing minimal or algebraic surfaces such as the schwarz minimal p d surfaces fermat s quartic schoen s minimal i wp surface theorem 5 2 and bring s curve 15 and theorem 5 3 the author would like to thank matthias weber for his insight and support on this project in addition the author would like to thank bruce solomon kevin pilgrim matt bainbridge and dylan thurston for their advice and feedback while completing this paper 2 a regular triply periodic polyhedral surface here we summarize 9 for the readers convenience this surface arises as the boundary of a triply periodic polyhedron achieved by gluing regular octahedra in r 3 periodically we denote the polyhedral surface by and show that it has no self intersection we also show that the surface is triply periodic and that its compact quotient is a genus three riemann surface we denote the quotient surface by x due to the many symmetries of x we identify its conformal structure as an eightfold cyclically branched covering over a thrice punctured sphere and find cone metrics on x that are induced from later we will study cone metrics that induce holomorphic 1 forms on x then find an algebraic description of x we show that the surface is non hyperelliptic and particularly that there is no triply periodic minimal surface whose underlying structure is conformally equivalent to octa 4 10 furthermore we will show that the algebraic equation of x represents fermat s quartic lastly we will find the automorphism group that acts transitively on x first we construct a triply periodic polyhedron by gluing regular octahedra in a periodic manner we begin with regular octahedra all of the same size we label them as either a type a or a type b octahedron we choose a pair of opposite faces on each type a octahedron and four faces that are pairwise non adjacent on each type b octahedron we 4 glue the octahedra to each other while alternating the types allowing gluing only along the chosen faces that is we glue type a octahedra to four non adjacent faces of a type b octahedron and type b octahedra to a pair of opposite faces of a type a octahedron figure 1 we name the boundary of this polyhedron the octa 4 surface and denote it by its name is due to the number of type a octahedra we attach to each type b octahedron definition 4 2 we also point out that is a regular polyhedral surface tiled by regular triangles eight at each vertex figure 1 geometric construction of theorem 9 the octa 4 surface has no self intersection furthermore it is invariant under three independent translations in r 3 next we look into the abstract genus three riemann surface x where is a rank three lattice in r 3 we will put a conformal structure on x induced by the polyhedral structure on this allows us to look at not only euclidean symmetries on but also hyperbolic symmetries on x this allows us to find translational structures on x which are geometric representations of holomorphic 1 forms induced from cone metrics as all triangles on are regular and all vertices on are octavalent we map a euclidean triangle in to a hyperbolic 4 4 4 triangle in the hyperbolic disk then by the schwarz reflection principle we get a hyperbolic tessellation of the hyperbolic disk as the funda mental piece consists of 32 triangles that come from four type a octahedra and two type b octahedra the hyperbolic 16 gon bounded by bold lines in figure 3 indicates the hyperbolic fundamental piece of x to pin down the identification of edges of the 16 gon we use the definition of petrie polygons from 2 definition 2 1 a petrie polygon of a regular tiling is an infinite regular skew polygon that turns alternately to the left and right figure 2 shows that a petrie polygon turns alternately to the left and right when it meets a vertex on the square hexagon triangular tiling respectively on we find petrie polygons that go through the midpoints of edges instead of the vertices their images on the hyperbolic disk via the previous mapping also correspond to hyperbolic geodesics on x in either case all petrie polygons become closed after passing through six triangles this shows that translations along the petrie polygons on x can be 5 figure 2 examples of petrie polygons used to find the identification of the hyperbolic 16 gon which are marked as dotted lines in figure 3 it also shows that there is an order eight rotation about any vertex on x that preserves the identification of edges this rotation is not induced from any euclidean symmetry on figure 3 hyperbolic description of x definition 2 2 a branched covering x y is called a cyclically branched covering if y x z nz for some n z the following theorem was shown as a remark in 9 theorem 9 x is an eightfold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere proof we use the riemann hurwitz formula we label the rotation about the center of the tessellation by a the center of the tessellation is fixed hence the branching order is 7 another fixed point is marked as on figure 3 there are also two points that have orbits of length four marked as and the branching order is three at the two points by the riemann hurwitz formula we have 2 2 3 8 2 2 gq 7 3 3 7 6 where gq is the genus of the quotient surface x a then gq 0 since a is cyclic we say that x is a cyclically branched cover over a sphere the previous theorem shows an order eight symmetry of x the following theorem finds all hyperbolic isometries of x theorem 9 let a be the counterclockwise order eight rotation that fixes a vertex of the hyperbolic tessellation on x and b be the counterclockwise order three rotation that fixes a hyperbolic triangle on x then the group of orientation preserving isometries is generated by a and b its presentation is aut x a b a 8 b 3 ab 2 a 2 b 2 3 a 4 b 2 3 1 specifically aut x 96 3 cyclically branched covers over spheres in the previous section we looked at an example of a regular triply periodic polyhedral surface due to its many symmetries on the underlying surface we were able to identify its hyperbolic structure as a cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere this motivates us to find other cyclically branched covers over punctured spheres which have the same structure as compact quotients of triply periodic polyhedral surfaces first we begin with the abstract construction and define a cyclically branched covering over a punctured sphere we show that such a covering is uniquely defined up to homeomorphism we also prove a finiteness theorem given the genus of the covering and the number of punctures on the 2 spheres then we study automorphisms on cyclically branched coverings by studying maps on punctured spheres and looking at their lifts next we seek a basis of holomorphic 1 forms on the coverings that arise from cone metrics on the quotient surfaces we find holomorphic 1 forms on the coverings as pullbacks of cone metrics on the quotients in particular this produces a basis of holomorphic 1 forms on the covering lastly we search for weierstrass points on the surfaces they arise as points where the dimension count of the riemann roch theorem is not generic moreover they are permuted by automorphisms hence allow one to distinguish riemann surfaces without the automorphisms one can rarely locate all weierstrass points on a given surface however we look into the wronski metric that reveals their location 3 1 construction of cyclically branched covers over spheres in this section we will demonstrate how to construct a d fold cyclically branched covering over an n punctured sphere we will show that these covering surfaces are uniquely defined up to homeomorphism we will also prove a finiteness theorem that says given g there only finitely many surfaces x so that x is a cyclically branched covering over a punctured sphere and genus x g let p 1 pn be n distinct points on a 2 sphere and let q s 2 p 1 pn be a base point we denote s 2 p 1 pn by y we take branch cuts i to be simple curves from q to pi so that i are mutually disjoint for each i we label the left side of i by l i and the right side of i by r i to each pi we assign a positive integer di which we call the branching 7 index the branching index indicates how the branching occurs around pi denote the degree of the covering map by d so that we have sheets y 1 yd without loss of generality we consider y 1 and p 1 we identify l 1 of y 1 with r 1 of y 1 d 1 mod d similarly we identify l 1 of y 1 d 1 mod d with r 1 of y 1 2 d 1 mod d and so on likewise for any i and j we identify l i of yj with r i of yj di mod d it follows from the construction that we need to only consider di 1 d 1 in the following theorem we show a necessary and sufficient condition on the branching indices for the covering to be well defined we also show that the covering surface is branched only at pi theorem 3 1 given an n punctured sphere and branching indices d 1 dn a d fold cyclically branched cover over the n punctured sphere is a closed surface if and only if n i 1 di 0 mod d proof let y be an n punctured sphere and let x y be a d fold covering for the cover ing to be cyclic definition 2 2 we must show that there exists an order d cyclic map that preserves x as yj was picked arbitrarily in the construction of the covering a map that sends yj to yj 1 is such a map then we check the lifting properties a positively oriented counterclockwise simple closed curve around p 1 yj and no other pi on yj lifts to a closed curve that passes through yj yj d 1 mod d yj 2 d 1 mod d yj regardless of the value of d 1 we are back to yj after d steps lastly we show that the covering map is not branched at any other point let be a positively oriented simple closed curve around q on yj so that the intersection numbers i 1 for all i since crosses each branch cut exactly once its lift is closed on the covering if and only if n i 1 di 0 mod d we denote the covering by x now we show that x is uniquely defined up to homeo morphism and independent of pi q or the branch cuts lemma 3 1 given a d fold cyclically branched covering over an n punctured sphere with branching indices d 1 dn a covering is uniquely defined up to homeomorphism that is the construction of x is independent of pi q or the branch cuts proof let y s 2 p 1 pn and y s 2 p 1 p n both be n punctured spheres let x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over y defined by d 1 dn and x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over y with the same branching indices since pi and p i have the same branching indices and y is homeomorphic to y their coverings are homeomorphic to each other now we give a criterion on the branching indices so that the coverings constructed by the given branching indices are connected lemma 3 2 let x be a d fold cyclically branched covering over an n punctured sphere defined by branching indices d 1 dn then x is connected if and only if gcd d 1 dn 1 8 proof we refer to the lifting properties in the proof of theorem 3 1 without loss of generality let i 1 and assume that gcd d d 1 1 then a positively oriented simple closed curve around p 1 yj and no other pi on yj for some j lifts to a closed curve that passes through all yj that is there exists one preimage of pi on x however if gcd d d 1 6 1 say gcd d d 1 2 then a positively oriented simple closed curve lifts to a closed curve that passes through only y 1 y 3 yd 1 or only y 2 y 4 yd in other words there exist gcd d di preimages of pi on x hence if gcd d 1 dn 6 1 then x is a disconnected surface that has gcd d 1 dn components now that the covering is topologically well defined we compute the genus of the covering proposition 3 1 let x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over an n punctured sphere defined by branching indices d 1 dn then genus x d n 2 2 1 1 2 gcd d di specifically if gcd d di 1 for all i then genus x n 2 1 d 1 proof we will find all branched points and their branching orders then apply the riemann hurwitz formula to find the genus of the covering if gcd d di 1 then the degree of the covering map at p i is d hence the branching order is d 1 for any di 1 there exist gcd d di preimages p i on x at each p i the degree of the covering is d gcd d di so the branching order is d gcd d di 1 we apply the riemann hurwitz formula then 2 2 genus x d 2 2 0 i gcd d di d gcd d di 1 d 2 2 0 i d gcd d di d 2 n i gcd d di and therefore genus x d n 2 2 1 1 2 gcd d di in the following theorem we prove that given n 3 and g 2 there are only finitely many cyclically branched covers x over an n punctured sphere where genus x g theorem 3 2 let n 3 and g 2 then there are finitely many surfaces x such that x is a cyclically branched cover over an n punctured sphere and genus x g moreover the degree d of such covering is bounded by d d g n where d 84 g 1 if n 3 d 12 g 1 if n 4 and 2 g n 2 1 d 4 g 1 n 4 if n 5 9 proof in proposition 3 1 we found the genus of a d fold cyclically branched covering x over an n punctured sphere defined by branching indices d 1 dn for a fixed n 3 and a fixed g 2 we will use the relation between n d di and genus x to find a bound on d then for a given d there are only finitely many integer paritions of d into n parts this proves that there are only finitely many d fold cyclically branched covers over an n punctured sphere where genus x g recall that we assume gcd d 1 dn 1 then n gcd d di d 2 n and due to the previous proposition n d n 2 2 2 g d 2 n which yields the desired bound for d given n 5 if n 3 then due to proposition 3 1 we have gcd d di d 2 2 g since gcd d di is a factor of d gcd d di can be written as gcd d di d p d q d r for some p q r 1 not necessarily distinct factors of d as our goal is to find an upper bound for d we look for an upper bound for gcd d di we use the fact that 1 p 1 q 1 r 1 2 1 3 1 7 for any p q r that satisfy 1 p 1 q 1 r 1 therefore d 2 2 g d 2 d 3 d 7 41 42 d with which we achieve an upper bound d 84 g 1 for g 2 if n 4 then gcd d di 2 d 1 g similarly gcd d di 1 p 1 q 1 r 1 s for some p q r s 1 are factors of d since 1 p 1 q 1 r 1 s 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 3 for any p q r s that satisfy 1 p 1 q 1 r 1 s 2 2 d 1 g d 2 d 2 d 2 d 3 11 6 d therefore d 12 g 1 for g 2 we note that a partition of an integer does not include permutation of the parts for notation we let d 1 dn all such coverings up to genus five are listed in appendix a octa 4 as a cyclically branched cover over a sphere earlier we proved that the underlying surface of the octa 4 surface has the conformal structure as an eightfold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere the following theorem identifies the branching indices that define the octa 4 surface theorem 9 the octa 4 surface has the same conformal structure as the eightfold cycli cally branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere defined by branching indices d 1 d 2 d 3 1 2 5 10 proof let a be an order eight rotation that yields a sphere x a the quotient sphere y 1 is shaded in figure 3 the branched points are marked as including the center of the tessellation we label the spheres so that y 1 y 2 y 8 are aligned counterclockwise around the center of the tessellation a positively oriented simple closed curve around the center of the tessellation goes from yj to yj 1 then to yj 2 and so on we label the center of the tessellation as p 1 then d 1 1 a positively oriented simple closed curve around via the identification of the edges goes from yj to yj 5 for any j we label this point as p 3 then the branching index at the corresponding point is d 3 5 notice that appears on y 1 y 3 y 5 and y 7 where appears on y 2 y 4 y 6 and y 8 that is p 2 has two preimages on x denoted by p 21 and p 22 and gcd d d 2 2 3 2 maps between cyclically branched covers to find the automorphism group on cyclically branched coverings over punctured spheres we first study maps on punctured spheres and then look at their lifts recall the construction of a cyclically branched cover x from subsection 3 1 analo gously define y s 2 p 1 p n to be an n punctured sphere q a base point and i the branch cuts given d and d 1 d n we likewise construct x let y y be a holomorphic map so that pi p i and i i in other words the punctures are mapped to punctures and the branch cuts are mapped to branch cuts this implies that q q and that there is an induced map 1 n 1 n on the indices in the following theorem we find a necessary and sufficient condition for so that its lift x x exists specifically we seek maps that preserve the identification of branch cuts and are therefore compatible with the construction of the coverings theorem 3 3 let x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over an n punctured sphere y with branching indices di dn and x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over an n punctured sphere y with branching indices d i d n let y y be a map such that pi p i and i i that induces a map 1 n 1 n on the indices then x 1 n x 1 n exists if and only if z d z such that d i di mod d 1 then is given by p i j 7 pi j mod d 2 for some 0 1 d before we prove the theorem we look at examples of maps on thrice punctured spheres and their possible lifts on cyclically branched coverings example 3 1 let x be a sevenfold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere defined by branching indices d 1 d 2 d 3 1 2 4 by proposition 3 1 the genus of the 11 covering is 7 2 1 1 2 3 3 in fact this is the description of klein s quartic as a cyclically branched cover 8 let be a self map on the thrice punctured sphere that cyclically permutes pi in other words either is the identity map p 1 7 p 2 7 p 3 7 p 1 or p 1 7 p 3 7 p 2 7 p 1 in other words must be one of 1 2 or 4 equation 1 if 1 then is the identity map so we have p i j 7 p i j 7 p i j 2 7 7 p i j 6 7 p i j as an order seven lift unless 0 in which case it is a trivial map if 2 or 4 then p 1 7 p 2 7 p 3 7 p 1 or p 1 7 p 3 7 p 2 7 p 1 respectively take 2 then we have p 1 j 7 p 2 2 j 7 p 3 4 j 3 7 p 1 j 0 1 6 and all lifts are of order three the case is similar for 4 example 3 2 let x be the underlying surface of the octa 4 surface conformally equiv alent to an eightfold cover over a thrice punctured sphere defined by d 1 d 2 d 3 1 2 5 theorem 3 1 let be a map on the thrice punctured sphere that permutes pi then must be either 1 or 5 by equation 1 if 1 then is the identity map while the lift fixes p 1 and p 3 it may interchange p 21 and p 22 depending on the value of if 5 then interchanges p 1 and p 3 and fixes p 2 however this involution does not permute the branch cuts as we desire consider the thrice punctured sphere as a doubled triangle with pi at the vertices if interchanges 1 and 3 then 2 is no longer a branch cut we modify the thrice punctured sphere by making a second branch cut from q to p 2 so that permutes the two branch cuts the original branching index d 2 2 is then cut down by half at each branch cut then p 1 j 7 p 3 5 j 7 p 1 j 6 7 7 p 3 5 j 3 7 p 1 j if is odd then is a lift of order eight if is either 2 or 6 then is a lift of order four and if 4 then is a lift of order two also interchanges p 21 and p 22 if is odd and fixes p 2 i if is even proof 3 3 our goal is to show that if a map y y satisfies the assumptions made above its lift x x exists if and only if the identification of i is preserved under we show that must be of the form equation 2 and satisfy equation 1 recall that x is determined by d 1 dn where l i on yj is identified with r i on y j di similarly for x l i of y j is identified with r i of y j d i let z dz z d z be a map defined on the indices of sheets yj such that j j suppose is given by p j 7 p j j then via l i of y j y j is identified with r i of the y j di y j d i hence the construction of x is compatible with the identification of branch cuts if and only if j di mod d j d i i j 3 12 mathematical induction implies j k di j k d i mod d for all k as we assume that the covering connected we have gcd d 1 dn 1 hence there exist coefficients c 1 cn z such that n i 1 cidi 1 then j 1 j cidi j cid i mod d by induction this implies j k j k mod d and by setting j 0 k 0 k mod d as claimed lastly equation 3 yields j di j di j di j di in other words d i di mod d 3 3 cone metrics on punctured spheres let x be a cyclically branched cover over y an n punctured sphere to find translational structures on x we will find cone metrics on x that arise as pullbacks of cone metrics on y specifically we will look at cone metrics on y that arise from the branching indices and define admissible cone metrics which induce holomorphic 1 forms on x in particular this gives a translational structure and a basis of holomorphic 1 forms on x at the end of this section we will revisit the octa 4 surface and compute an explicit basis of holomorphic 1 forms on the underlying riemann surface definition 3 1 a cone metric is given by an atlas where open sets are mapped to either the euclidean plane or a cone in either case the change of coordinates is via euclidean motions in other words orientation preserving isometries the following proposition is a special case of the gauss bonnet theorem that connects the topology the euler characteristic and the geometry total curvature of a surface it is also a generalization of descartes theorem on total angular defect of a polyhedron we will show that given a cone metric on a compact riemann surface of genus g the cone angles satisfy a sum condition proposition 3 2 given a compact riemann surface of genus g and a cone metric let p 1 pn be distinguished points with respective cone angles i then i 2 2 g 2 n 13 proof the angle defect that is the gaussian curvature at generic points is zero in general the angle defect is computed as the integral of the gaussian curvature by taking a circle centered at the cone point the integral equals the angular defect at the vertex and we say that the curvature is concentrated at the cone points then for the total curvature we have 2 2 i hence 2 2 2 g 2 n i the following theorem considers not only the topology of a surface but also its conformal type given distinguished points and cone angles on a compact riemann surface that satisfies proposition 3 2 there exists a unique cone metric that is compatible with the conformal structure of the given surface theorem schwarz christoffel troyanov let y be a compact riemann surface of genus g let p 1 pn be preassigned points on y and let 1 n r satisfy i 2 2 g 2 n then there exists a cone metric on y compatible with the conformal structure of y where pi are the cone points with respective cone angles i moreover the cone metric is uniquely defined up to dilation as we have cone metrics on y now we construct cone metrics on x by pulling back cone metrics on y then determine which pullbacks give us translation structures on x definition 3 2 let x y be a covering we say a cone metric on y is admissible if its pullback yields a translational structure on x in the following lemma and theorem y is an n punctured sphere and x is a d fold cyclically branched cover over y with branching indices d 1 dn to find cone metrics on y whose lifts yield translational structures on x we need to determine the holonomy of the metrics for all closed curves on x the following lemma gives us a necessary and sufficient condition for admissible cone metrics lemma 3 3 let i be a branch cut on y from a base point q to pi let be an oriented closed curve on y and let ci i be the intersection number counting multiplicities then the lift is closed in x if and only if cidi 0 mod d proof let 0 1 y be a closed curve and 0 yj for some j 1 d if c 1 1 1 and ci 0 for i 2 n then we have 1 yj d 1 mod d still assuming ci 0 for i 2 n now take c 1 to be arbitrary then we have 1 yj c 1 d 1 mod d in other words is closed in x if and only if c 1 d 1 0 mod d now in general for arbitrary ci i 1 lies in yj cidi mod d in other words is closed in x if and only if cidi 0 mod d theorem 3 4 let y be an n punctured sphere and x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over y determined by branching indices d 1 dn let i be the branch cut on y from q to pi let i ai 2 d for some ai be respective cone angles at pi that satisfy i 2 2 g 2 n then the cone metric on y defined by 1 n is admissible if and only if ai z and also ci di 0 mod d implies ci ai 0 mod d where ci z implies that c 1 1 cn n is a positively oriented curve in y where i a closed curve on y with winding number ind i pj ij 14 proof let 1 n define a cone metric on y that is compatible with its conformal type given a closed curve i in y whose winding number is ind i pj ij its lift i on x has an argument of i by the previous lemma the lift of the d fold concatenation of i has trivial holonomy on x if and only if d i is a multiple of 2 therefore ai must be an integer as we can write any closed curve on y as a concatenation of i we show that its lift is closed in x if and only if the arguments derived from each i add up to a multiple of 2 in other words is closed in x if and only if ci di 0 mod d implies that c 1 1 cn n closed in y in this case we say a cone metric given by 1 n is admissible given an admissible cone metric analytic continuation along yields trivial holonomy on x hence 0 ci i ci ai 2 d 2 d ci ai mod 2 which implies ci ai 0 mod d to show that a cone metric defined on y is admissible we need to show that its pullback is a well defined 1 form on x let a cone metric on y be defined by 1 n 2 d a 1 an and be a closed curve in y if ai z and 0 ci ai mod d for every on x then arg is a multiple of 2 where is the pullback of the cone metric given by the cone angles i the trivial holonomy implies well definedness of on x hence the cone metric is admissible specifically if ai di mod d for all i then the cone metric defined by 1 n 2 d d 1 dn is admissible given an admissible cone metric we propose a natural way of finding other admissible cone metrics using the following definition definition 3 3 given branching indices d 1 dn we say a 1 d 1 is a multiplier if a d 1 dn a d 1 mod d a dn mod d is admissible for simplicity we denote a d 1 d 3 as a 1 a 3 where ai 0 d 1 the following corollary shows how the multipliers give us a natural way of finding other admissible cone metrics corollary 3 1 given branching indices d 1 dn let ai a di mod d for some a z if ai 0 for all i and ai d n 2 then the cone metric given by cone angles 2 d ai an is admissible proof apply proposition 3 2 and let g 0 we revisit example 3 1 and example 3 2 and find an explicit basis of holomorphic 1 forms on each covering that arise from multipliers of branching indices example 3 3 continued from example 3 1 let x be the sevenfold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere defined by branching indices 1 2 4 we have mul tipliers 1 2 and 4 which yield admissible cone metrics defined by cone angles 2 7 1 2 4 2 7 2 4 1 and 2 7 4 1 2 respectively then we have holomorphic 1 forms that have zeros of order i 2 1 at each pi they form a basis of holomorphic 1 forms i on x with divisors 1 p 2 3 p 3 2 p 1 3 p 2 3 3 p 1 p 3 15 example 3 4 continued from example 3 2 let x be an eightfold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere defined by 1 2 5 then we get admissible cone metrics with cone angles 2 8 1 2 5 2 8 2 4 2 and 2 8 5 2 1 the three admissible cone metrics induce a basis of holomorphic 1 forms i on x with divisors 1 4 p 3 2 p 1 p 21 p 22 p 3 and 3 4 p 1 note that 4 is not a multiplier as a cone metric derived from 2 8 4 0 4 is not admissible the cone metric induces a meromorphic 1 form whose divisor is 3 p 1 p 21 p 22 3 p 3 this shows why ai 0 is necessary from the two examples one might ask whether all admissible cone metrics arise from multiples of 2 d di we prove that the answer is yes if n 3 theorem 3 5 let x y be a d fold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere with branching indices d 1 d 2 d 3 then there are exactly g admissible cone metrics that arise from multipliers proof given d and d 1 d 2 d 3 we have d 1 multiples a 1 a 2 a 3 of the branching indices out of the d 1 multiples we discard those if ai 0 for any i since gcd d 1 d 2 d 3 1 we can have at most one ai be zero among a 1 a 2 and a 3 for a given multiple of d 1 d 2 d 3 this results in removing gcd d d 1 1 gcd d d 2 1 gcd d d 3 1 many multiples out of d 1 note that if gcd d di 1 for all i then none of the multiples are removed at this step now we are left with 2 g multiples of d 1 d 2 d 3 proposition 3 1 we show that there is an involution on the remaining 2 g multiples of d 1 d 2 d 3 that maps the admissible cone metrics to non admissible cone metrics the involution is a multiplication by d 1 that is if 2 d d 1 d 2 d 3 yields an admissible cone metric then d 1 d 2 d 3 d 1 d 1 d 1 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 3 d d 1 d d 2 d d 3 mod d does not yield an admissible cone metric because d di 2 d 6 d n 2 due to the corollary however the theorem does not apply in general cases if n 4 for example let x be a twofold cover over a 4 punctured sphere with branching indices 1 1 1 1 then the covering is a genus one surface proposition 3 1 we observe 1 is the only multiplier and 2 2 1 1 1 1 yields the only admissible cone metric on the other hand if x is a fourfold cover with branching indices 1 1 1 1 then the genus of the covering is three however the only multiplier is 2 where the cone angles are given by 2 4 2 2 2 2 other admissible cone metrics arise from 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 and 1 1 1 5 this does not change the construction of x since 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 mod 4 to form a basis one needs to make a choice of admissible cone metrics without loss of generality pick p 1 then we have a basis of 1 forms that have different orders of zero at p 1 whose divisors are 1 4 p 2 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 3 4 p 1 16 conjecture 3 1 given a d fold cyclically branched covering over an n punctured sphere defined by branching indices d 1 dn there are at least g admissible cone metrics that are of the form a d 1 dn a d 1 mod d a dn mod d recall corollary 3 1 in other words we allow a di mod d to be greater than d 1 furthermore the cone metrics that arise this way yield a basis of holomorphic 1 forms in appendix a we check that the conjecture is true for all coverings of lower genera g 5 octa 4 flat structures and algebraic equations we will mainly discuss two topics in this section first we will find the flat structures on the underlying surface of the octa 4 that are compatible with its conformal type in ex ample 3 4 we found cone metrics that arose from multipliers and found an explicit basis of holomorphic 1 forms we will show that the geometric representations of the 1 forms are translational structures then with the given basis of holomorphic 1 forms we will find an algebraic equation that describes the octa 4 surface and show that it is projectively equiv alent to fermat s quartic first we look at 1 using the notation from example 3 4 we map a hyperbolic 4 4 4 triangle to a euclidean 8 2 8 5 8 triangle then by schwarz reflection principle we obtain a conformally equivalent flat metric figure 4 the hyperbolic geodesics are mapped to straight lines in the euclidean plane in other words the identification of the edges are preserved in the flat structure by translations we put a translational structure dz at the interior and along the edges of the flat polygon the cone angle is 2 at p 1 and p 2 i hence they are generic points however the cone angle at p 3 is 5 4 8 2 4 1 this corresponds to a holomorphic 1 form that has a zero of order four at p 3 figure 4 a translational structure on x 1 next we look at the translational structure induced from 2 and map the hyperbolic tri angles to euclidean 2 8 4 8 2 8 triangles where the edges are again identified by translations figure 5 then around each p 1 p 21 p 22 and p 3 we get a cone angle of 2 1 1 this corresponds to 2 that has simple zeros at p 1 p 21 p 22 and p 3 similarly we can map hyperbolic triangles to 5 8 2 8 8 triangles for 3 and show that the cone angle is 2 4 1 at p 1 2 at p 21 p 22 and p 3 this yields 3 therefore we get i 17 1 23 4 1 2 3 4 a b b a figure 5 a translational structure on x 2 as a basis of holomorphic 1 forms as every compact riemann surface is a complex algebraic curve proposition 2 1 of chap ter 7 from 11 states that if x is a non hyperelliptic algebraic curve of genus 3 then it can be embedded into pg 1 as a smooth projective curve of degree 2 g 2 as the octa 4 is a genus three curve we will find a quartic curve to show that is not hyperelliptic we will find an algebraic description of the octa 4 surface that is equivalent to its con formal type with i as defined we define holomorphic functions f g x c so that f 1 2 p 1 p 21 p 22 3 p 3 g 3 2 3 p 1 p 21 p 22 p 3 then with f 3 g 4 p 21 4 p 22 8 p 3 and fg 3 8 p 1 4 p 21 4 p 22 and after proper scaling of the functions we get f 3 g 1 fg 3 31 3 1 3 3 4 2 4 in 9 it is shown that the quartic equation in 4 is projectively equivalent to fermat s quartic theorem 9 the conformal structure on the underlying surface of the octa 4 is confor mally equivalent to fermat s quartic 3 4 wronski metric and weierstrass points in this section we look for weierstrass points on compact riemann surfaces as they carry information about the automorphism group of the surface it allows one to distinguish one riemann surface from another in this section we will discuss how one can locate all weier strass points on a given surface by defining the wronski metric lastly we will locate all weierstrass points on the underlying surface of the octa 4 surface and show that they cor respond to the vertices on its triply periodic polyhedral realization in r 3 the following definitions theorems and propositions can be found in 4 18 theorem weierstrass gap theorem let x be a riemann surface of positive genus and let p x be an arbitrary point then there are precisely g integers 1 n 1 n 2 ng 2 g such that there does not exist a meromorphic function f on x that is holomorphic on x p with a pole of order ni at p definition given the gap sequence n 1 ng at p x the weight of a point p is defined by wtp g i 1 ni i if wtp 0 then we say that p is a weierstrass point proposition let x be a compact riemann surface of genus 2 let wtp be the weight of p x then p x wtp g 1 g g 1 proposition let w x be the finite set of weierstrass points on x if aut x then w x w x in fact the gap sequences at p x and p are the same in general there is no straightforward way of locating all weierstrass points even on a highly symmetric surface for example on klein s quartic example 3 3 the gap sequence at each p i is 1 2 4 hence wtp i 1 therefore the surface is not hyperelliptic since the genus of klein s quartic is three all weights should sum up to 24 we use aut x to locate the other weierstrass points for instance there are seven copies of q x for q pi and if q is a weierstrass point then so is q however it is not apparent where the weierstrass points are located nor can we conclude the distribution of weights the following proposition from chapter 3 section 5 in 4 tells us that the wronskian of a basis of holomorphic 1 forms induces a metric on the surface with this metric we can find all weierstrass points on a surface without direct information of its automorphism group definition given a basis of holomorphic functions f 1 fg on a riemann surface x of genus g the wronskian defined by w z det djfk z dzj j 0 g 1 k 1 g is a non trivial holomorphic function on x that induces a metric which we call the wronski metric remark a change of basis results in a non zero constant multiple of the wronskian hence the zeros are independent of the change of basis from chapter 3 section 5 in 4 by induction on g one can show that a zero of the wronskian is a weierstrass point on x the order of a zero at a point equals its weight which encodes the information about the cone angle hence the wronski metric is a cone metric let x be a d fold cyclically branched cover over an n punctured sphere y defined by branching indices d 1 dn to compute the wronski metric on x we need to find an appropriate coordinate chart w on x which is induced from the pullback of a coordinate 19 chart on y let z be a local coordinate chart on y such that z pi 0 then its pullback on x has a zero of order d gcd d di at p i so we write w as w z z d gcd d di on x near p i on the other hand let k fk z dz be a holomorphic 1 form on x that is induced from an admissible cone metric defined by cone angles 2 d ak 1 a k n 1 then k has a zero of order aki gcd d di 1 at p i since dz has a zero of order dgcd d di 1 f has a zero of order aki d gcd d di at p i furthermore we can write fk z gk z h z for k 1 g where gk z z aki gcd d di and h z z d gcd d di then w z det djfk z dzj j 0 g 1 k 1 g det f j k hg det g j k w 1 z in other words the weierstrass points that are not preimages of any pi arise as zeros of w 1 z however the weight at p i is computed as follows proposition 3 3 chain rule for wronskian given a basis of holomorphic 1 forms on a compact riemann surface of genus g the wronskian of the basis is a non trivial holomorphic g g 1 2 differential on x and w w h w g w g 1 g 2 w 1 w where the derivatives are taken with respect to w proof let z w then by definition w z w w h w g det g j k w where det g j k w det gk w g k w w g k w w 2 g k w w g g 1 k w w g 1 g k w g 1 w w g 1 g 2 det gk w g k w g k w g g 1 k w hence w w h w g w g 1 g 2 w 1 w 1 k is a superscript to denote the cone angles that yield a holomorphic 1 form k 20 corollary 3 2 w w has a zero of order wti d gcd d di g 1 g 2 bi g g 1 2 at p i where bi is defined as the order of w 1 z at p i proof by proposition 3 3 we have gcd d di d wti gcd d di d g gcd d di d 1 g 1 g 2 bi and the order of w w at p i is as desired weierstrass points on the octa 4 surface in this section we will locate all weierstrass points on the octa 4 surface in two different ways in 9 the author uses the fact that all vertices on are similar and shows that all weierstrass points on the compact quotient of the octa 4 surface correspond to the vertices on the polyhedral surface theorem 9 the weierstrass points on the underlying surface of the octa 4 surface correspond to the vertices on the polyhedral surface next we compute the wronksi metric on the compact quotient of the octa 4 surface using corollary 3 2 to locate all weierstrass points given the branching indices 1 2 5 and a chart z pi 0 1 1 we have bi 2 1 2 wti 2 for all i and w 1 z 1 3 z 2 appendix b in other words there exists a q x where z q 1 3 and wt q 2 this point is fixed by an involution defined by 5 and 4 example 3 2 that interchanges p 1 and p 3 and interchanges p 21 and p 22 in particular this involution is not hyperelliptic hence there is no triply periodic minimal surface whose underlying structure is conformally equivalent to the octa 4 surface theorem 10 if m is a minimal surface of genus three then m is hyperelliptic corollary 9 there is no triply periodic minimal surface that has the same conformal type as the octa 4 surface 4 regular triply periodic polyhedral surfaces in section 2 we discussed a regular triply periodic polyhedral surface definition 1 1 that was not included in coxeter petrie s classification of infinite regular polyhedral surfaces due to its lack of euclidean isometries to loosen the criteria and broaden the classification we observe a common factor between the construction of the mucube muoctahedra mutetrahe dra and the octa 4 surface the mucube muoctahedra and mutetrahedra respectively is the boundary of a triply periodic polyhedron built by cubes truncated octahedra and trun cated tetrahedra respectively in a periodic manner similarly the octa 4 surface arises as 21 the boundary surface of a polyhedron built by regular octahedra in this section we seek more examples of triply periodic polyhedral surfaces that arise from such a construction we formulate a gluing pattern of regular solids using tools from graph theory we define a decoration of a skeletal graph in r 3 to construct triply periodic polyhedra then we put restrictions on the decoration to find regular triply periodic polyhedra and classify all triply periodic polyhedral surfaces that arise as the boundary of such decorations 4 1 triply periodic symmetric skeletal graphs as we are interested in triply periodic polyhedra we look at their deformation retracts as triply periodic skeletal graphs in r 3 a skeletal graph or a 1 skeleton of a topological space x is a simplicial complex that is a union of the 0 simplices and 1 simplices of x example 4 1 octa 4 the octa 4 surface is the boundary of the triply periodic polyhedron we built with regular octahedra the skeletal graph of the polyhedron is its deformation retract each type b octahedron is adjacent to four type a octahedra hence we retract each type b octahedron to its center a 0 simplex similarly each type a octahedron is adjacent to two type b octahedra so we retract each type a octahedron to a 1 simplex that is incident to two 0 simplices type b octahedra then the skeletal graph of the solid polyhedron is connected and triply periodic where all of its 0 simplices are incident to four 1 simplices we are interested in connected simple and symmetric skeletal graphs that are embedded in r 3 all definitions follow from 7 definition 4 1 a skeletal graph v e consists of a set v of vertices 0 simplices and a set e of edges 1 simplices an edge e e is a 2 element subset of v which we denote as an unordered pair e v 1 v 2 for some v 1 v 2 v a pair of vertices v v is connected if sequence of edges leads from v to v a connected graph is a graph in which every unordered pair of vertices in the graph is connected we say that a graph is regular if every vertex has the same number of incident edges the number of edges incident to a vertex is called the degree of the vertex if all vertices have the same degree d we say that a graph is a d regular graph or a regular graph of degree d we say that a graph is symmetric if given any two edges v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 there is an automorphism v v such that v 1 v 1 and v 2 v 2 lastly a simple graph is a graph that does not allow neither multiple edges nor loops multiple edges are two or more edges that connect the same two vertices and a loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself if a graph is symmetric then its group of automorphisms acts transitively on the edges and hence on the vertices note that a connected symmetric graph is regular in the euclidean setting we require the automorphisms to be euclidean isometries therefore we need to define lengths of edges and angles between two incident edges we define the length of an edge e v 1 v 2 by v 2 v 1 using the euclidean norm and the angles between two edges e v v 1 and e v v 1 by arccos v 1 v v 1 v v 1 v v 1 v we say that a skeletal graph is triply periodic or doubly periodic respectively if is invariant under a rank three or two respectively lattice given a periodic skeletal graph we define its compact quotient 22 graph by v e figure 6 shows examples of doubly periodic graphs namely the square tiling and the hexagonal tiling on r 2 on each graph the fundamental piece is bounded by the dotted lines to the rights are their compact quotient graphs figure 6 doubly periodic graphs and their quotients next we define the genus of periodic skeletal graphs definition 4 2 given a graph that has v 0 simplices and e 1 simplices we define the genus of as genus e v 1 given a skeletal graph in r 3 we let n be the tubular neighborhood of for small enough 0 so that n embeds in r 3 then n v is isotopic to a sphere with d holes and n e is isotopic to a cylinder the euler characteristic of a d punctured sphere is 2 d and the euler characteristic of a cylinder is zero the genus of is defined as the genus of n for a d regular periodic skeletal graph we consider its quotient v e and denote by v v then e e vd 2 then 2 2 genus v 2 d vd 2 0 5 we label each quotient graph by g v d the following proposition proves that given g 1 there are finitely many symmetric quotient graphs of genus g proposition 4 1 let be a periodic skeletal graph of genus 1 whose quotient is sym metric then the degree of the graph is 3 furthermore for a given genus 1 there are finitely many symmetric quotient graphs of the type g v d 23 proof we refer to equation 5 for any given g 1 2 g 2 has finitely many divisors hence there are only finitely many quotient graphs that can be labeled as g v d for a fixed g if v 1 then d 2 g so the quotient graph has one vertex and g loops if v 2 then due to connectivity and symmetry we can only allow multiple edges on the quotient graph then e g v 1 and d 2 g 2 v 2 given that this number is an integer therefore d 3 the following shows all symmetric quotient graphs of genus three and four if g 3 then 4 v d 2 hence v d is 1 6 2 4 or 4 3 if g 4 then 6 v d 2 so v d is 1 8 2 5 3 4 or 6 3 g v d g v d 3 1 6 4 1 8 3 2 4 4 2 5 3 4 3 4 3 4 4 6 3 table 1 symmetric quotient graphs of genus 3 4 although we require the skeletal graphs to be simple we do not impose this on their quotient graphs 4 2 classification of regular triply periodic polyhedral surfaces in example 4 1 we showed that a triply periodic polyhedron can be retracted to a triply periodic skeletal graph in r 3 in this section we will define a decoration of a skeletal graph as a way to associate a polyhedral surface given a skeletal graph we will regard its tubular neighborhood that consists of solids definition 4 3 given a skeletal graph embedded in r 3 a decoration of is a polyhedron achieved by replacing the 0 simplices and 1 simplices with convex polyhedral solids including the empty solid so that i there is a deformation retract of the polyhedron to the skeletal graph and ii the polyhedra are identified only along faces in essence if a 0 simplex and a 1 simplex in are incident then their corresponding replacement solids in the decoration are identified along a face a regular decoration of is a decoration whose boundary surface is regular that is the surface is tiled by regular p gons with the same valency at every vertex moreover the solids must be adjacent to only one type of polygon a regular decoration is denoted by p q r if the boundary surface is tiled by regular p gons q at each vertex and the intersection of adjacent solids is a regular r gon the notation p q r is called the schla fli symbols 24 in proposition 4 1 we showed that given a periodic skeletal graph of g 1 whose quotient is symmetric the degree of the graph is at least three note that each 0 simplex is incident to d 1 simplices and each 1 simplex is incident to two 0 simplices hence if a polyhedron is adjacent to three or more polyhedra then it retracts to its center as a 0 simplex on the other hand if a polyhedron is adjacent to only two polyhedra then it retracts to a 1 simplex that is incident to the centers of the two adjacent polyhedra the next definition puts restrictions on the solids that replace the 0 and 1 simplices definition 4 4 an archimedean decoration of is a decoration where only platonic solids and archimedean solids are allowed to replace the 0 simplices for the 1 simplices we only allow prisms and anti prisms over regular polygons and empty solids as replacement solids if two solids that are adjacent to each other both retract to 0 simplices we allow an empty solid to replace the 1 simplex that is incident to the 0 simplices example 4 2 for example the octa 4 surface example 4 1 is a regular archimedean dec oration of 3 2 4 where the 0 simplices are replaced with regular octahedra and the 1 simplices are replaced with triangular anti prisms which are essentially octahedra the surface is denoted by 3 8 3 in schla fli symbols also the mucube is a regular archimedean deco ration of 3 1 6 where the 0 simplex is replaced with a cube and the 1 simplices are replaced with square prisms that is cubes the boundary surface is tiled by squares six around each vertex and the solids are only adjacent along squares hence the mucube is denoted as 4 6 4 in schla fli symbols the muoctahedron is a regular archimedean decoration of 3 1 6 where the 0 simplex is replaced with a truncated octahedron and the 1 simplices are replaced with empty solids in other words the truncated octahedra are adjacent to each other along their square faces the surfaces is tiled by hexagons four around each vertex therefore denoted as 6 4 4 lastly the mutetrahedron is a regular archimedean decoration of 3 2 4 where one of the 0 simplices is replaced with a tetrahedron the other is replaced with a truncated tetrahedron and the 1 simplices are replaced with empty solids in other words the tetrahedra and truncated tetrahedra are adjacent to each other along the tri angular faces its boundary surface is tiled by hexagons three around each vertex hence denoted by 6 3 3 in the remainder of the section we will prove that there are only finitely many regular archimedean decorations for a given skeletal graph in lemma 4 1 we will show all possible combinations of solids that we can use to decorate a skeletal graph then in theorem 4 1 and theorem 4 2 we will show all regular polyhedral surfaces of genus three and four respectively that arise from a regular archimedean decoration of a symmetric quotient graph lemma 4 1 given a skeletal graph r 3 there are at most finitely many regular archimedean decorations of proof recall that a decoration of a skeletal graph is a replacement of the 0 and 1 simplices with convex polyhedra we will show that there are at most finitely many possible combi nations of solids that we can use to replace the 0 and 1 simplices one way to decorate a 25 graph is to replace the 0 simplices with one type of platonic or archimedean solid and the 1 simplices with one type of prism or anti prism the octa 4 surface and the mucube arise from such construction secondly we can replace the 0 simplices with one type of platonic or archimedean solid and the 1 simplices with the empty solid an example is the muoc tahedra lastly we replace the 0 simplices by different types of platonic or archimedean solids this forces us to replace the 1 simplices with the empty solid otherwise the boundary surface cannot be regular the mutetrahedra is constructed this way combining proposition 4 1 and lemma 4 1 in the following theorems we show all regular archimedean decorations of symmetric quotient graphs of genus three and four theorem 4 1 there exist only finitely many genus three regular triply periodic polyhedral surfaces that are regular archimedean decorations of 3 1 6 and 3 2 4 proof we will prove this theorem by case distinction given a symmetric quotient graph proposition 4 1 we sort out the platonic and archimedean solids that can replace the 0 simplices based on the degree of the graph the solids must have d faces placed in a symmetric way in r 3 so that we can replace the 0 simplices of a degree d graph for this reason we do not consider the quotient graph 3 4 3 as we cannot choose three faces from a platonic or achimedean solid in a symmetric way then for each solid depending on the remaining faces we select the solids that can replace the 1 simplices of the graph that is we consider prisms if the remaining faces are squares and anti prisms if the remaining faces are triangles we begin with the quotient graph 3 1 6 since d 6 the candidates that can replace the 0 simplex are a cube octahedron cuboctahedron six squares and eight triangles trun cated cube six octagons and eight triangles truncated octahedron six squares and eight hexagons and a snub cube since v 1 we must choose the six r gonal faces as three pairs of opposite faces the three parallel translations will form a lattice of translations in r 3 if the six r gonal faces are placed as the bases of a prism and the remaining faces are squares then we consider r gonal prisms to replace the 1 simplices a cube with six square prisms the mucube arises this way if the r gonal faces are placed as the bases of a prism but the rest of the faces are not squares then we consider empty solids to replace the 1 simplices a truncated octahedron muoctahedron arises this way other cases are a cuboctahedron and a truncated cube however in both cases the boundaries of the decorations are discon nected if the r gonal faces are placed as the bases of an anti prism involving a r rotation and the rest of the faces are triangles then we consider r gonal anti prisms to replace the 1 simplices an octahedron with six triangular anti prisms arises this way lastly for the rest of the cases we consider empty solids a snubcube is an archimedean solid that has chirality hence it cannot replace a 0 simplex of a quotient graph that has only 26 one 0 simplex 2 next we look at 3 2 4 as d 4 the candidates that can replace the 0 simplices are a tetrahedron cube octahedron icosahedron and a truncated tetrahedron we claim that there are two distinct ways to choose four faces from the solids one way is to observe the tetrahedral symmetry where the corresponding solids are the tetrahedron octahedron icosahedron and truncated tetrahedron after we choose four faces from an octahedron or icosahedron by tetrahedral symmetry the remaining faces are triangles hence we replace the 1 simplices with triangular anti prisms and achieve two octahedra with four triangular anti prisms octa 4 and two icosahedra with four triangular anti prisms we can also inscribe a tetrahedron in a cube as we do an octahedron in 9 hence we have a decoration by two tetrahedra with triangular anti prisms once we choose four triangular faces from a truncated tetrahedron the remaining faces are hexagons hence the 1 simplices must be replaced with empty solids instead of replacing both 0 simplices with truncated tetrahedra we replace one with a tetrahe dron a truncated tetrahedron and tetrahedron with empty solids yields the mutetrahedron on the other hand if we choose four hexagonal faces from a truncated tetrahedron the remaining faces are triangles hence one can attempt to replace the 1 simplices with hexagonal anti prisms however this does not yield an embedded surface in r 3 another way of choosing four faces from a solid is to choose two pairs of opposite faces then we have two possibilities two cubes with four prisms and two octahedra with four triangular anti prisms figure 7 figure 7 regular archimedean decorations of 3 2 4 by cubes and octahedra respectively 2 however it can replace a 0 simplex of a quotient graph if v 2 and d 6 by 5 this is the quotient graph 5 2 6 27 theorem 4 2 there exist only finitely many genus four regular triply periodic polyhedral surfaces that are regular archimedean decorations of 4 1 8 and 4 3 4 proof the proof of this theorem will follow the proof of theorem 4 1 proposition 4 1 yields symmetric quotient graphs 4 1 8 4 3 4 4 2 5 and 4 6 3 but we will will not consider the lat ter two as we cannot choose five faces or three respectively from a platonic or achimedean solid in a symmetric way in r 3 first we look at 4 1 8 since d 8 we seek solids that have eight faces placed in a symmetric way in r 3 these solids are an octahedron icosahedron cuboctahedron truncated cube truncated octahedron and a rhombicuboctahedron we seek four pairs of opposite r gonal faces we choose eight faces from an octahedron or icosahedron so that when an octahedron or icosahedron is inscribed in a regular cube the eight faces face the vertices of the cube this yields an octahedron with eight triangular anti prisms and an icosahedron with eight triangular anti prisms for the cuboctahedron rhombicuboctahedron eight triangles and eighteen squares and truncated cube we choose eight faces as four pairs of opposite triangular faces these faces are placed as bases of an anti prism involving a 3 rotation as there is only one 0 simplex in this quotient graph we cannot replace the 1 simplices with prisms nor empty solids on the other hand the remaining faces are not triangular faces which implies that we cannot replace the 1 simplices with anti prisms either after choosing four pairs of opposite faces from a truncated octahedron six squares and eight hexagons we are left with parallel square faces hence we can replace the 1 simplices with hexagonal prisms or empty solids replacing the 1 simplices with empty solids yields a disconnected boundary surface however a truncated octahedron with hexagonal prisms figure 8 yields a triply periodic polyhedral surface figure 8 fundamental piece of the truncated octa 8 surface 28 lastly we look at 4 3 4 we mimic the argument from the decorations of 3 2 4 from the previous theorem then three cubes with four square prisms and three octahedra with four triangular anti prisms yield triply periodic polyhedral surfaces figure 9 figure 9 regular archimedean decorations of 4 3 4 by cubes and octahedra respectively 5 conformal structures of regular triply periodic poly hedral surfaces as cyclically branched covers over spheres in this section we will study the conformal structures of the triply periodic polyhedral sur faces we found in theorem 4 1 and theorem 4 2 since the surfaces are triply periodic we look at their compact quotients which carry the same conformal type of the polyhedral sur face since the polyhedral surfaces are regular definition 1 1 they carry many symmetries on the underlying surfaces that are intrinsic to the surface and independent of the embedding in r 3 to identify the conformal structure of a surface we need a large enough symmetry group so that the quotient is conformally rigid the simplest case is where such group is a cyclic group we are particularly interested in surfaces whose quotient via a cyclic group is a sphere with tools developed from section 3 we will determine the conformal structure on the underlying surfaces that are induced from the cone metrics in subsection 5 1 we look at hyperbolic structures on the mucube muoctahedron and mutetrahedron we will show that all three surfaces are biholomorphic to each other by analysing their cone metrics we will show that the surfaces have conformally equivalent descriptions of the genus three schwarz minimal p and d surfaces in subsection 5 2 we will look at a regular archimedean decoration of 4 1 8 by an octahedron and eight triangular anti prisms its cone metric shows that the compact quotient is a twelvefold cyclically branched cover over a thrice punctured sphere we will show that its conformal structure is equivalent to that of the genus four 29 schoen s minimal i wp surface in subsection 5 3 we will look at another example of a regular archimedean decoration of 4 1 8 by a truncated octahedron and hexagonal prisms we show that the compact quotient is a fivefold cyclically branched cover over a 4 punctured sphere we also show that the surface has the same conformal description as kepler s small stellated dodecahedron and bring s curve 15 in the last section we will revisit the octa 4 surface as we already determined the conformal structure throughout section 2 and section 3 we will take an excursion from the main discussion as pointed out earlier the surface cannot be conformally equivalent to any minimal surface however we find a harmonic map on the surface that has the same period matrix as the octa 4 surface in other words we find a smooth surface that has the same conformal type as the octa 4 surface 5 1 mucube muoctahedron and mutetrahedron in this section we will study the three regular triply periodic polyhedral surfaces that appear in 3 first we will look at their hyperbolic structures and show that all three surfaces have the same hyperbolic description due to various rotational symmetries on the underlying surface we will show that the surface has multiple descriptions as a cyclically branched cov ering over a punctured sphere then we will find the conformal structure that is induced from the cone metrics with admissible cone metrics we find a basis of holomorphic 1 forms on the surface and find an algebraic description of the surface we will locate all weierstrass points on the underlying surface as well as on the polyhedral surfaces lastly we will show that the surfaces can be immersed into r 3 as triply periodic minimal surfaces here we will find the hyperbolic tessellation for each of the mucube muoctahedron and mutetrahedron we will focus on the symmetries on the surfaces and show that all three have the same hyperbolic description we begin with the mucube which is denoted by 4 6 4 in schla fli symbols its fundamental piece quotient via the lattice of translations is tiled by twelve squares we map a euclidean square to a hyperbolic 3 square and by schwarz reflection principle obtain the following hyperbolic tessellation figure 10 as we used petrie polygons definition 2 1 to find identification of edges in figure 3 for the octa 4 surface we look at polyhedral geodesics for the mucube consider any surface tiled by regular p gons where p is even either the polyhedral surface embedded in euclidean space or the hyperbolic setting we define a polyhedral geodesic as a geodesic that goes through opposite sides of a p gon then all polyhedral geodesics on the mucube in either euclidean or hyperbolic tiling are closed after going through four squares given a polygonal tiling its dual tiling is formed by taking the center of each polygon as a vertex and joining the centers of polygons that share an edge as the muoctahedron is denoted by 6 4 4 the hexagonal tiling of the muoctahedron is dual to the square tiling of the mucube we map the euclidean hexagons to hyperbolic 2 hexagons figure 11 shows the hyperbolic description of the muoctahedron where the identification of edges is identical to that of the mucube the mutetrahedron denoted by 6 6 3 is also tiled by hexagons the fundamental piece consists of four hexagons that are twice the size of the hexagons on the muoctahedron the identification of edges suggests that this has the same hyperbolic description as the two surfaces above 30 3 3 2 2 1 1 figure 10 hyperbolic description of the mucube 3 3 2 2 1 1 figure 11 hyperbolic description of the muoctahedron 3 3 2 2 1 1 figure 12 hyperbolic description of the mutetrahedron 31 the previous figures suggest that the hyperbolic geodesics are preserved under an or der six rotational symmetry we take the quotient of the hyperbolic fundamental domain by the cyclic group of order six then the quotient is a doubled hyperbolic rhombus of angles 6 2 6 2 which is topologically a sphere we label the center of the tessellation as p 1 and using the same argument as in theorem 3 1 we have di 1 we label the re maining vertices of the quotient rhombus as p 2 p 3 and p 4 counterclockwise there exist one p 3 and three of each p 2 and p 4 hence the branching indices di satisfy gcd 6 d 3 1 and gcd 6 d 2 gcd 6 d 4 3 therefore the underlying surface of the mucube equiv alently the muoctahedron or mutetrahedron is a sixfold cyclically branched cover over a 4 punctured sphere with branching indices di 1 3 5 3 the admissible cone metrics 2 6 1 3 5 3 2 6 3 3 3 3 and 2 6 5 3 1 3 arise from the multipliers from which we get a basis of holomorphic 1 forms i where the divisors are 1 4 p 3 2 2 p 1 2 p 3 and 3 4 p 1 given an explicit basis of 1 forms we have an algebraic equation 1 3 2 2 that describes the abstract surface by corollary 1 5 of chapter 3 from 11 a nonsingular conic curve of degree two is isomorphic to p 1 this shows that the surface is hyperelliptic we will show that the surface can also be described as a fourfold cyclically branched cov ering over a sphere the hyperbolic hexadecagon in figure 13 represents the fundamental piece of the mucube where a square face is at the center of the tessellation we find the iden tification of the edges using polyhedral geodesics and observe that an order four rotational symmetry preserves the geodesics we take the quotient of the hyperbolic fundamental do main by the cyclic group of order four this yields a doubled hyperbolic rhombus of angles 4 3 4 3 4 4 which is topologically a sphere we label the vertices of the rhombus as pi with p 1 at the center of the tessellation so that d 1 1 the cone angles at the cone points imply that the abstract surface is a fourfold cyclically branched cover over a 4 punctured sphere with branching indices d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 such that gcd 4 di 1 for each i and that di 0 mod 4 then the branching indices must be either 1 1 1 1 or 1 1 3 3 since we already know that the surface is hyperelliptic we claim that 1 1 1 1 is not of our desire by showing that such covering is not hyperelliptic if d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 1 1 1 1 then we get a basis of holomorphic 1 forms with 1 4 p 2 2 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 and 3 4 p 1 we refer to the discussion in subsection 3 4 since wt 1 2 the covering cannot be hyperelliptic 1 2 3 4 6 5 7 8 1 2 3 4 6 5 7 8 figure 13 another hyperbolic description of the mucube 32 note that there are no larger cyclic groups that preserve the hyperbolic geodesics of the surfaces we have shown the following proposition proposition 5 1 the compact quotients of the mucube muoctahedron and mutetrahedron are biholomorphic to each other moreover the underlying surface has at least two distinct descriptions as cyclically branched coverings over a 4 punctured sphere the coverings are defined as a sixfold cover defined by branching indices 1 3 5 3 and as a fourfold cover defined by branching indices 1 1 3 3 next we locate the weierstrass points on the underyling surface of the mucube muocta hedra and mutetrahedron we view the surface as a sixfold covering defined by branching indices 1 3 5 3 then wt 1 wt 3 3 hence p 1 and p 3 are weierstrass points that are fixed by the hyperelliptic involution in figure 10 the 180 rotation about the center of the tessellation is an involution that fixes p 1 and p 3 in fact it fixes all p i hence all p i are weier strass points as we found eight weierstrass points they are the only weierstrass points furthermore they are marked in figure 10 figure 11 and figure 12 corresponding to vertices on the mucube the centers of the hexagons on the muoctahedron and the vertices and centers of the hexagons on the mutetrahedron lastly using the following theorem and definition we show that we can immerse the underlying surface of the mucube muoctahedron and mucube into r 3 as a minimal surface theorem 14 given holomorphic 1 forms 1 2 and 3 such that 2 i 0 and i 2 6 0 we have z 7 re z 1 2 3 that defines a conformally parametrized minimal surface in r 3 and every conformal minimal surface parametrization arises this way definition given holomorphic 1 forms i for i 1 2 3 the weierstrass representation is defined by z 7 re z 1 2 1 g g i 2 1 g g 1 dh where g 1 i 2 3 is the gauss map theorem 5 1 the underlying conformal structure of schwarz minimal p surface is com patible with that of the mucube and muoctahedron that of schwarz minimal d surface is compatible with the mutetrahedron proof given the basis of holomorphic 1 forms i from the previous computation define i by 1 1 3 2 2 dh 2 i 1 3 2 2 dh 3 dh so that i satisfy 2 i 0 and i 2 6 0 in other words the following weierstrass representation re z 1 2 1 g g i 2 1 g g 1 dh is a conformal parametrization of a minimal surface in r 3 where g is the gauss map schwarz minimal p surface has the mucube and muoctahedron as the underlying conformal structure and schwarz minimal d surface has the mutetrahedron as the underlying conformal structure 33 5 2 octa 8 in this section we look at a genus four triply periodic polyhedral surface that arises as a regular archimedean decoration of 4 1 8 the graph is decorated by an octahedron and eight triangular anti prisms so we call it the octa 8 surface we will show that its compact quotient is a twelvefold cyclically branched covering over a thrice punctured sphere we will find an explicit basis of holomorphic 1 forms on the surface and show that the surface is conformally equivalent to the genus four schoen s minimal i wp surface the topological construction of the octa 8 surface is similar to that of the octa 4 surface instead of attaching four type a octahedra on a type b octahedron we attach eight the fundamental piece of the octa 8 surface is tiled by 24 triangles where every vertex is twelve valent we map a flat triangle to a hyperbolic 6 triangle then tile the hyperbolic disk using schwarz reflection principle figure 14 shows the hyperbolic description along with the identification of edges its hyperbolic description displays an order twelve rotational symmetry which preserves the hyperbolic geodesics we take the quotient of the hyperbolic fundamental piece by the cyclic group of order twelve which results in a doubled triangle we label the center of the tessellation by p 1 thus d 1 1 the identification of edges suggests that gcd 12 d 3 1 and 12 d 2 4 therefore the covering is defined by branching indices d 1 d 2 d 3 1 4 7 1 2 3 4 12 3 4 figure 14 hyperbolic description of the octa 8 surface given the branching indices the admissible cone metrics arise from 1 4 7 2 8 2 4 4 4 and 7 4 1 which yield a basis of holomorphic 1 forms i with the following divisors 1 6 p 3 2 p 1 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 p 3 3 3 p 1 3 p 3 4 6 p 1 by weierstrass gap theorem we have wt p 1 wt p 3 4 in other words the surface is not hyperelliptic since the octa 8 surface is a non hyperelliptic genus four surface its canonical curve embeds in p 3 we refer to the following proposition proposition 2 6 chapter 7 from 11 that shows that all genus four non hyperelliptic curves are in the complete intersection of a cubic and a quadric polynomial 34 proposition let x be a non hyperelliptic algebraic curve of g 4 then x embeds in p 3 as a smooth curve of degree six defined by the vanishing of a quadric and a cubic polynomial given the basis of holomorphic 1 forms on the octa 8 surface that arise from admissible cone metrics we have 1 4 2 3 furthermore we define meromorphic 1 forms f g and h by f 1 2 p 1 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 5 p 3 g 3 2 2 p 1 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 2 p 3 h 4 2 5 p 1 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 p 3 then f 2 g 3 p 21 3 p 22 3 p 23 3 p 24 12 p 3 and h 2 g 12 p 1 3 p 21 3 p 22 3 p 23 3 p 24 after appropriate scaling we have f 2 g 1 h 2 g which yields a cubic 21 3 32 3 24 on the other hand we can define meromorphic functions u and v such that u 2 4 and v 3 4 then after scaling we have v 5 u 3 1 v u 3 or in other words v 5 v u 3 or 53 3 44 32 23 the equation u 3 v 5 v suggests that the abstract surface is a threefold branched cover over a sphere branched at h 0 and the fourth roots of unity ac cording to the classification of cyclically branched coverings over spheres appendix b the branching indices of the threefold covering must be either 1 1 1 1 1 1 or 1 1 1 2 2 2 we claim that it cannot be the latter by computing the weight distributions on the octa 8 surface we have wt p 1 wt p 3 4 computation of the wronskian corollary 3 2 tells us that wt p 2 i 4 for i 1 2 3 4 and that there are 36 points of wt 1 each all six branched points on the 1 1 1 1 1 1 covering also have wti 4 and the surface has 36 points of wt 1 each on the other hand the six branched points on the covering defined by 1 1 1 2 2 2 have wti 2 hence this surface cannot have the same conformal structure as the octa 8 surface in the following theorem we prove that the threefold cyclic cover defined by 1 1 1 1 1 1 is the order three gauss map on a genus four minimal surface namely schoen s minimal i wp surface the fundamental piece of schoen s minimal i wp surface can be viewed as a central chamber with handles toward the vertices of a cube we will show that the underlying conformal structure of schoen s minimal i wp surface is compatible with that of the octa 8 surface theorem 5 2 given the cone metrics on the compact quotient of the octa 8 surface the weierstrass representation defines a conformally parametrized genus four minimal surface namely schoen s minimal i wp surface proof given the basis of holomorphic 1 forms that arise from the admissible cone metrics we define i as follows 1 1 4 2 3 dh 2 i 1 4 2 3 dh 3 dh 35 then we have 2 i 0 and i 2 6 0 then the following weierstrass representation re z 1 2 1 g g i 2 1 g g 1 dh defines a conformally parametrized minimal surface in r 3 where the gauss map g 1 3 has a zero and a pole of order three this is quite a remarkable result since the order twelve rotational symmetry is not visible on the polyhedral octa 8 surface or the i wp surface in r 3 5 3 truncated octa 8 in this section we look at another genus four triply periodic polyhedral surface that also arises as a regular archimedean decoration of 4 1 8 the 0 simplex is replaced by a truncated octahedron and the 1 simplices are replaced by hexagonal prisms we call it the truncated octa 8 surface we will show that its compact quotient is a fivefold cyclically branched covering over a 4 punctured sphere we will find an explicit basis of holomorphic 1 forms and show that the quotient surface has a conformal realization as a well known euclidean uniform polyhedron the dodecadodecahedron also known as kepler s small stellated dodec ahedron it is shown that this surface is also equivalent to bring s curve 15 we will also show that the underlying conformal structure is not compatible with any genus four minimal surface to prove the embeddedness of the polyhedral surface in euclidean space we again use the fact that cubes tile space first we place a truncated octahedron in a cube so that the square faces of the truncated octahedron are tangent to the faces of the cube tiling space with such cubes results in the muoctahedron however now we uniformly scale the trunctated octahedra in each cube so that the distance between two parallel hexagonal faces on neighboring truncated octahedra is equal to the edge length of the solids where we attach hexagonal prisms to connect the neighboring truncated octahedra figure 8 shows the fundamental piece of the boundary surface as there are five squares at each vertex of the boundary surface we map the euclidean squares to hyperbolic 2 5 squares and obtain a hyperbolic tessellation figure 15 we trace the polyhedral geodesics to find the identification of edges in the hyperbolic setting where all of them are closed after going through six squares figure 15 exhibits an order five rotational symmetry that preserves the hyperbolic geodesics we take the quo tient of the hyperbolic fundamental domain by the cyclic group of order five which results in a sphere in fact the surface is a fivefold cyclically branched covering over a 4 punctured sphere with branching indices 1 2 4 3 this is shown in lemma 2 1 15 weber also shows that this quotient surface has a conformal realization as a well known compact polyhedron the dodecadodecahedron also known as kepler s small stellated dodecahedron this surface has an algebraic description as bring s curve lastly we show that the conformal structure induced from the cone metric on the abstract quotient of the truncated octa 8 surface is not compatible with any minimal surface in r 3 36 1 23 4 1 2 4 3 figure 15 hyperbolic description of the truncated octa 8 surface theorem 5 3 the conformal structure induced from the cone metric on the abstract quo tient of the truncated octa 8 surface is not compatible with any triply periodic minimal surface in r 3 proof we refer to earlier discussions in section 5 1 and section 5 2 to parametrize a min imal surface in r 3 we need a rank three quadric however we will show the existence of a quadric q 1 2 3 4 0 of rank four then use be zout s theorem to show that we can not have a rank three quadric of our desire be zout s theorem says if x lies on two distinct quadrics q and q then q q is a curve of degree 4 given the branching indices 1 2 4 3 that define the surface the admissible cone metrics induce a basis of holomorphic 1 forms with the following divisors 1 p 2 3 p 3 2 p 4 2 p 1 3 p 2 2 p 3 3 2 p 1 p 3 3 p 4 4 3 p 1 2 p 2 p 4 then q 1 2 3 4 1 4 2 3 0 is a rank four quadric hence by be zout s theorem there can be no quadric of rank three to parametrize a minimal surface in r 3 5 4 octa 4 in 9 is shown that there is no minimal surface that has the same underlying structure as the octa 4 surface in this section given a basis of 1 forms and a homology basis we will mimic the weierstrass representation and find a smooth surface of the same conformal type given i that is induced from the admissible cone metrics we pick a homology basis and calculate the period matrix k j then we will find coefficients aij that satisfy j a 1 ja 2 j a 3 j k j re k 1 2 3 p 6 37 where p is a 3 6 matrix whose column vectors form a lattice in euclidean space the lattice is a result of the periods of cycles on the polyhedral surface in r 3 theorem 5 4 there exists an explicit parametrization of a smooth surface that has the same conformal type as the octa 4 surface proof we will choose a homology basis that makes computation of p easier we let 1 2 3 lie in three distinct anti prisms then we pick k so that the intersection numbers are i j ij in other words k k 3 k 1 results in a canonical homology basis in figure 16 k are marked as bold lines and k are marked as dotted lines figure 16 canonical homology basis on the octa 4 the column vectors of p form a lattice in r 3 moreover due to our choice of cycles only k have nonzero periods in r 3 hence p 0 0 0 2 0 20 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 since we already have an explicit basis of holomorphic 1 forms given by the admissible cone metrics example 3 4 we compute the period matrix by i j i j 3 j 1 then 1 i 1 i 1 2 1 i 1 2 1 i 2 2 2 2 i 2 i 2 i 2 i 2 2 1 i 1 2 1 i 1 2 1 i 1 i 2 i 2 2 i we write a b then the jacobian is defined as a 1 b i 1 i 2 1 i 21 i 2 i 1 i 2 1 i 2 1 i 2 i then the coefficients aij 2 2 4 3 2 i 4 2 2 0 1 2 i 2 0 1 0 1 2 i 2 0 1 1 2 i 2 38 figure 17 fundamental piece of the
