fields indexed by a polytope for the pfaffian of metric connections for semi riemannian metrics on vector bundles we apply this formula to compute the euler characteristic of a riemannian polyhedral manifold in the spirit of chern s differential geometric proof of the generalized gauss bonnet formula on closed manifolds and on manifolds with boundary as a consequence we derive an identity for spherical and hyperbolic polyhedra linking the volumes of faces of even codimension and the measures of outer angles 1 introduction the classical gauss bonnet theorem computes the euler characteristic of a closed surface m g by integrating on m the gaussian curvature kg when m has a smooth boundary one must add a correction term involving the average of the geodesic curvature of the boundary m m if m has corners i e the boundary itself has isolated singular points then the exterior angle of these corners must also be taken into account this general formula reads 2 m m kg g m a lg p out p where a m r is the geodesic curvature function with respect to the outer normal lg is the induced volume form on m and out p is the outer angle at a corner p this outstanding formula has been generalized to arbitrary dimensions by a sequence of authors including h hopf h weyl c allendoerfer a weil and s s chern in the present paper we extend the gauss bonnet formula of allendoerfer and weil 3 to general compact riemannian polyhedral manifolds theorems 6 1 and 6 5 the outline of the paper is as follows in the first two sections we review the pffafian of the curvature using the language of double forms in section 4 we define smooth polyhedral mani folds and polyhedral complexes and study their properties with respect to integration of forms the category of polyhedral complexes allows one to bundle together the outer cones of faces of riemannian polyhedral manifolds the natural locally trivial bundles of spherical polytopes where the contributions of the faces are localized starting from chern s construction 6 of a transgression form we introduce in section 5 higher transgressions for the pfaffian form on vec tor bundles endowed with a nondegenerate bilinear form and a compatible connection we show date november 29 2021 1 http arxiv org abs 2011 06538 v 2 2 sergiu moroianu that the exterior differential of these transgressions can be computed as a sum of lower order transgressions we then apply our abstract transgression theorem in section 6 to the case of rie mannian polyhedral manifolds this formula has been proved with entirely different methods by allendoerfer and weil 3 for a particular class of polyhedral manifolds that we call regular for regular polyhedral manifolds the gauss bonnet formula in the even dimensional case follows by iterating the transgression formula on the boundary strata in the general case we use a global polyhedral complex to transfer the transgressions onto the outer cones via the polyhedral stokes formula the odd dimensional case is reduced to the even case by analyzing the riemannian product with an interval in the final section we particularize our formula to space forms theorem 1 1 let m be a d dimensional compact polyhedral manifold of constant sectional curvature k with totally geodesic faces then 1 m 2 j 0 y f d 2 j k j vol 2 j y vol s 2 j outy vol sd 2 j 1 where f d 2 j is the set of faces of m of dimension 2 j sk is the standard unit sphere in rk 1 and outy is the measure of the outer solid angle at the face y by convention for 2 j d both the volume of s 1 and the exterior angle of the interior face of m are defined to be 1 we deduce from this theorem identities for hyperbolic polyhedra involving the volumes of even dimensional faces and their outer angles including an extension to the noncompact case where some or all vertices are ideal historical note for submanifolds in rn the gauss bonnet formula was stated and proved by hopf 12 for hypersurfaces and by allendoerfer 2 for submanifolds of arbitrary codimension allendoerfer and weil 3 derived their formula on riemannian polyhedra mainly as a tool for deducing the gauss bonnet on closed riemannian manifolds without assuming the existence of an isometric embedding in euclidean space which we now know to exist by nash s embedding theorem 15 but was unknown at that time their proof is indirect based on a series of results a triangulation theorem for polyhedral manifolds an additivity result for the geometric side of the formula a proof for simplices embedded in some euclidean space using weyl s tube formula an embedding theorem for analytic simplices predating nash due to cartan and the whitney analytic approximation result in a series of papers 6 7 chern gave an entirely different proof of the gauss bonnet formula based on his transgression form for the pfaffian lifted to the sphere bundle his construction yields simultaneously the necessary correction term on manifolds with boundary i e manifolds with corners of codimension 1 we extend here chern s method to transgressions of higher orders transgressions of transgres sions and use these transgressions to prove the allendoerfer weil formula for a more general class of polyhedral manifolds than that of 3 in particular the additivity of the geometric term higher transgressions of the pfaffian 3 in the generalized gauss bonnet becomes a corollary of our proof we close in this way a circle of ideas going back to gauss and bonnet hopf and weyl allendoerfer and weil and last but not least s s chern this paper is a tribute to those great mathematicians from the past 2 tensor calculus and the pfaffian we fix in this section the notation concerning vector bundles with metric connections and we develop a formalism for multiplying vector valued forms such a formalism was already used by walter 20 in his generalized allendoerfer weil formula for locally convex subsets in a rie mannian manifold and also by albin 1 2 1 the pfaffian let v h be a 2 n dimensional real vector space endowed with a nondegen erate symmetric bilinear pairing of signature k 2 n k this means that we can find orthogonal bases e 1 e 2 n with h e 1 e 1 h ek ek 1 h ek 1 ek 1

smooth manifold and e 1 e 2 e 3 real vector bundles over m to every linear map p e 1 e 2 e 3 we associate a product on spaces of vector valued forms i e a bilinear map p m e 1 m e 2 m e 3 1 s 1 2 s 2 7 1 2 p s 1 s 2 a first example of such a product arises for e 1 r e 2 e 3 e and p r e e the canonical isomorphism we recover the m module structure of m e when e 1 end e e 2 e 3 e and p is the tautological pairing end e e e we recover the action of endomorphism valued forms on e valued forms a large class of examples arises when e 1 e 2 e 3 e are bundles of r algebras and p is the algebra product of e as a particular case of the previous example let e be the bundle of exterior algebras of a vector bundle v set u v m v u m vv when m and v are clear from the context we will suppress them using simply the notation u v we get a bi graded algebra structure on the space of double forms m v u v u v another particular case take e to be the endomorphism bundle of some vector bun dle v we get a composition product on the space of endomorphism valued forms m end v the two last two examples may lead to confusion when v is additionally endowed with a non degenerate symmetric bilinear pairing h in that case there is an identification of the space of h antisymmetric endomorphisms end v with 2 v given by end v a 7 a 2 v a u v h u av 2 so there exist two different product maps on m 2 v one is the exterior product taking values in m 4 v the other one is the composition product obtained by iden tifying m 2 v with m end v and then using the product of endomorphisms hence taking values in m end v for simplicity in the sequel we shall write for the product p m e 3 3 the curvature tensor as a double form for every vector bundle e m with connection and for every k 0 we denote by d k m e k 1 the exterior differential twisted by on e valued forms recall that on a tensor product s s where k and s e are a locally defined k form respectively a section in e d is given by d s d s 1 k s higher transgressions of the pfaffian 5 the first order differential operator d is a derivation on the graded m module m e in the sense that for any s m and s m e the leibniz rule holds d s d s 1 s d s the composition of two successive operators d is a 0 th order differential operator identified with an element r 2 m end e in other words for all s m e we have d d s r s where the product is induced from the canonical pairing end e e e the tensor r 2 m end e is called the curvature endomorphism of when e has a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear pairing h preserved by the curvature endo morphism r will be skew symmetric as in 2 this endomorphism determines via h a double form r 2 2 2 m 2 e r x y e 1 e 2 h e 1 r x y e 2 called the curvature form when no confusion can arise regarding h we will continue to denote the form r by r 3 1 the pfaffian of the curvature for any real vector bundle e m of even rank 2 n en dowed with a nondegenerate pairing h and a compatible connection we are ready to define the pfaffian form pfh when e is oriented multiplication by the volume form of h defines for every d 0 an isomorphism d m 7 volh d 2 n the inverse of this isomorphism is called the berezin integral bh with respect to h the pfaffian form of is defined as pfh r 1 n bh n r 2 n m 2 n 0 when h is implicit from the context for simplicity we write pf for pfh r clearly the pfaffian form vanishes identically if the dimension of the base m is smaller than the rank of e even if e is not oriented we can still define the pfaffian density of r by using the above defi nition locally with respect to any of the two possible orientations this is well defined because volh volh is invariant under change of orientation lemma 3 1 if there exists a parallel section s 6 0 in e then pfh r vanishes identically on m proof if s 0 then r s 0 thus sy r 0 hence sy n r 0 so n r 0 theorem 3 2 the pfaffian of is a closed form on m proof from the second bianchi identity d r 0 so by the leibniz rule d nr 0 more over if 2 n then one can easily check that dbh bh d hence dpfh 1 n dbh n r 1 n bh d nr 0 6 sergiu moroianu with these preliminaries we can now state the classical gauss bonnet formula let m g be a compact riemannian manifold without boundary of dimension 2 n and r 2 2 the curvature of a metric connection on tm then 3 m pf r 2 n m the formula is valid even if m is not orientable in that case pf r being a density the reader interested in a short proof of this statement can skip the next section dealing with polyhedral manifolds and complexes thereof as well as most of section 5 remark the pfaffian form on the tangent bundle was introduced by h hopf 12 motivated by geometric considerations that can be briefly summarized as follows the infinitesimal volume of the gauss map of a compact hypersurface m r 2 n 1 equals the determinant of the second fundamental form while the curvature of the hypersurface is by the gauss equation the square of the second fundamental form in the sense of double forms it follows that the pull back on m through the gauss map of the standard volume form from the sphere s 2 n equals the pfaffian of the curvature hopf computed in this way the degree of the gauss map intrinsically in terms of the integral of the pfaffian on m 4 polyhedral manifolds a somewhat informal notion of polyhedral manifold was used in 3 we give here a rigorous definition together with an extension to a larger category that of polyhedral complexes polyhedral manifolds extend the notion of manifolds with corners 14 since for manifolds with embedded corners the results of the current section become largely obvious the reader interested only in such manifolds can proceed directly to section 5 4 1 linear polyhedra definition let v be a real vector space of dimension n and sv v 0 r the dual sphere consisting of non zero linear forms on v defined up to a positive constant let a sv be a finite set the open linear polyhedron in v defined by a is the cone pa x v x 0 a a non empty linear polyhedron is always unbounded according to this definition since it is invariant by dilations with positive factors the condition x 0 is the same for every repre sentative i e it is invariant under rescaling of by a positive constant a closed linear polyhedron is the closure in v of an open linear polyhedron the closure of pa is clearly pa x v x 0 a and note that according to this definition the interior in v of a closed polyhedron is nonempty higher transgressions of the pfaffian 7 some of the linear forms defining a linear polyhedron pa may be redundant so it is natural to consider minimal sets of such defining forms lemma 4 1 if a set a sv defines a non empty open linear polyhedron in v there exists a unique minimal set a a defining the same linear polyhedron i e pa pa two minimal sets a a sv define the same polyhedra in v if and only if they are equal let pa be a nonempty open linear polyhedron defined by a minimal set of linear forms a for every a the hyperface p a is the open linear polyhedron inside the vector space ker v defined by the relations ker a 6 by minimality this linear polyhedron is non empty has dimension n 1 and sits inside the closure of pa the linear polyhedron pa has thus as many hypersurfaces as the cardinality of a note that the set of defining forms for p a indexed by a may be non minimal inductively one defines the faces of depth or codimension l 2 of a linear polyhedron p as the hyperfaces of the faces of depth l 1 of p a closed linear polyhedron is thus decomposed into the disjoint union of its open faces we denote f p l 1 f l the set of all faces of p of codimension at least 1 recall the minkowski weyl theorem 21 5 every open linear polyhedron p can be described alternately as the set of linear combinations with positive coefficients of some generating vectors v 1 vk p c 1 v 1 ckvk cj 0 j 1 k a minimal set of such generating vectors is unique up to rescaling by positive constants con versely every finite set of vectors in v spans a linear polyhedron by positive linear combinations as above this linear polyhedron could be the whole of v corresponding to the empty set of linear forms a if p pa is an open linear polyhedron in v defined by a finite set of forms a sv the dual polyhedron p is the linear polyhedron inside the dual space v defined as the positive linear span of the vectors a for every face f p the conormal space n f is the space of forms in v which vanish on f or equivalently on its linear span the intersection of n f with p is a face of p 4 2 polyhedra definition 4 2 an open polyhedron in a vector space v is the set of points v v satisfying the inequalities j v aj j 1 k 4 for some 1 k v and a 1 ak r 8 sergiu moroianu closed polyhedra and their faces are defined as in the case of linear polyhedra a polytope is a compact polyhedron according to our definition the interior in v of a closed polyhedron is always nonempty and its dimension is dim v definition 4 3 the conormal outer cone f out of an open face f p in a polyhedron p v is the set of forms v such that for every v f and v 0 p v v 0 0 if the polyhedron p is defined by 4 and f p is the open face determined by f v v 1 v a 1 l v al l 1 v al 1 k v ak then f out can also be described as the open cone f out c 1 1 cl l cj 0 j 1 k so in particular f out is a linear polyhedron in n f v if we fix v f and v 0 p take 5 f out 1 f out v v 0 1 then f out 1 is an open polytope independent of v and independent of v 0 up to a canonical iso morphism moreover r f out 1 f out or in other words f out is a cone with base f out 1 a subcomplex c p in a closed polyhedron p is the union of some closed faces of p definition 4 4 fix v 0 in the interior of a polyhedron p let p out v v be the disjoint union p out f f p f f out define also p out 1 as p out 1 f f p f f out 1 lemma 4 5 if p is a linear polyhedron in v then the sets p out and p out 1 defined with respect to some fixed v 0 p are polyhedral subcomplexes in p p v v proof clearly p out is a subcomplex of the product polyhedron p p as for p out 1 it is the intersection of p out with the affine hyperplane v v 0 1 4 3 polyhedral manifolds and complexes it is natural to define a topological polyhedral man ifold x of dimension n as a separated topological space locally homeomorphic to some closed polyhedron of dimension n i e every point x x has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open set in a closed polyhedron depending on x of dimension n these local homeomorphisms are called charts and a collection of charts covering x is an atlas since every polyhedron is locally homeomorphic to a linear polyhedron by an affine transformation we could have used linear polyhedra as model spaces in this definition higher transgressions of the pfaffian 9 example 4 6 fix an inner product on v an open spherical polytope in v is the intersection of an open linear polyhedron p v with the unit sphere in v the closure of a spherical polytope is a polyhedral manifold diffeomorphic to the polytope p 1 v p 0 v 1 for some fixed 0 in the dual polyhedron p the diffeomorphism is given by radial projection a topological polyhedral complex inside a polyhedral manifold m is a space c so that the pair m c is locally homeomorphic to some subcomplex inside some closed polyhedron more precisely for every x c there exists a polyhedron px a subcomplex cx px and a homeo morphism called chart of complexes from a neighborhood d p of x to an open set u px such that u c is mapped homeomorphically onto u cx let p v p v be open polyhedra and c p c p subcomplexes a map f d c c is called smooth if for every x c there exists an open neighborhood u of x in v and a smooth map f u v extending f u c u c c such that f u p p definition a polyhedral manifold respectively a polyhedral complex is is a topological poly hedral manifold respectively a topological polyhedral complex endowed with a smooth atlas a point of depth l 0 in a polyhedral manifold m is a point mapped to a point of depth l through a chart hence through any chart a open face of codimension l of m is a connected component of the set of points of depth l such a face is clearly a smooth manifold of dimension n l however its closure is in general not a polyhedral manifold of the same dimension for a face y inside a polyhedron m we denote by f l y the set of open faces of m which have codimension l 0 in y definition 4 7 a polyhedral manifold m is regular if the closure of every open face of m is again a polyhedral manifold linear polyhedra and spherical polytopes are examples of regular polyhedral manifolds the re gion in the plane bounded by a smooth segment self intersecting orthogonally in its end points is an example of non regular polyhedral surface regular polyhedral manifolds are an exten sion of the notion of manifolds with corners with embedded faces the polyhedral manifolds considered in 3 seem to be regular although the authors are imprecise on this aspect 4 4 outer spheres and the outer cone complex let x be a point in a face y of a polyhedral manifold m an interior vector at x is the tangent vector in 0 to a smooth curve c 0 m with c 0 x a riemannian metric on a polyhedral manifold m is a metric which in any chart modeled by a polyhedron in a vector space v extends to a smooth metric on an open set of v riemannian metrics can be constructed on any polyhedral manifold using partitions of unity 10 sergiu moroianu definition 4 8 let x m be a point in the riemannian polyhedral manifold m and let y be the unique open face of m of which x is an interior point the outer cone at x denoted coutx y is the set of those vectors in txm whose inner products with every interior tangent vector at x are non positive the outer sphere soutx y is the set of unit vectors in the outer cone at x every vector v soutx y is orthogonal to y so s out x y is a subset of the normal sphere to y at x otherwise the projection of v on y would have positive inner product with v thus soutx y is a spherical polytope inside nxy the orthogonal complement in txm to txy proposition 4 9 let m gm be a riemannian polyhedral manifold of dimension n y m an open face of codimension l and a y a fixed point then souty x y soutx y tm is a flat locally trivial bundle over y with fiber type the polytope y souta y if m is regular then souty is globally trivial souty y y proof let a m there exists a connected domain m d a a chart d p rn with values in a closed polyhedron p and a riemannian metric gp on rn whose pull back through is gm let y be the unique open face of m containing a and denote by l its dimension then d y is mapped into a face f p of the same codimension clearly tm tp is a bundle isomorphism over its image and thus for every x d its restriction to the outer spheres x s out x y s out x f is a linear isomorphism of spherical polytopes to show that souty is locally diffeomorphic to a product it is thus enough to show that soutf is canonically isomorphic to the product bundle over f with fiber type soutb f the image of coutf through the isomorphism tp t p induced by gp is just f f out we have seen in example 4 6 that after fixing an interior point in p the bundle of spheres in f f out becomes canonically diffeomorphic to the product polytope f f out 1 assume now that m is regular the closure of every open face is then embedded in m and hence the unit outer normal vector field to every open hyperface extends continuously to the closure it follows that every closed face y is a connected component of an intersection of hyperfaces for all x y the generating vectors of the spherical polytope soutx y are the unit normals to distinct hyperfaces of m and they trivialize souty as in example 4 6 the contribution of a face y m in the gauss bonnet formula will turn out to be given by an integral on the total space of the bundle of outer spheres souty or equivalently the integral on y of a transgression of the pfaffian of order codim y proposition 4 10 let m gm be a riemannian polyhedral manifold of dimension n then the set of outer pointing unit tangent vectors denoted mout is a polyhedral complex of dimension n 1 inside tm the open top dimensional faces of mout are the interiors of the outer sphere bundles souty where y spans all the open faces of m of codimension l 1 higher transgressions of the pfaffian 11 proof suppose first that m is the closure of an open polyhedron in rn defined by a minimal set of linear forms 1 p a if y m is a face of codimension l let ay a be the set of those j s which vanish along y after relabeling we can assume that ay 1 k proposition 4 9 tells us that couty is isomorphic to y y where the polytope y is the outer sphere at some fixed point a y moreover souty y is spanned as a spherical polytope by the unit vectors v 1 y vk y dual via g m to 1 k it follows that s out y y is diffeomorphic to the conormal outer cone y out under the difeomorphism tm t m induced by the metric gm hence couty respectively souty are diffeomorphic to y y out respectively to y y out 1 thus the claim follows from lemma 4 5 in general m is only locally diffeomorphic to a polyhedron p thus mout is locally diffeomor phic to a subcomplex in tp which by definition means that it is a polyhedral complex 4 5 boundaries of polyhedral complexes and the stokes formula it is straightforward to define smooth differential forms the exterior derivative and restriction of forms to faces of polyhedral manifolds we prove below that stokes formula also continues to hold on polyhedral complexes once we properly define the boundary of a face let m be a polyhedral complex of dimension k 1 and assume that we fix an orientation on all the faces of m of dimension k and k 1 let f m be an open face of dimension k 1 we define an integer m f the multiplicity of f in m counting how many times f appears as the oriented boundary of faces of m as follows take x f and a connected chart in m near x d p mapping a neighborhood of x into the k skeleton of a polyhedron p the chart induces orientations on the k dimensional faces y 1 ys of p d whose closure contains the image of x and also on the unique face f p d of dimension k 1 containing x for j 1 s let j be a vector field along f pointing inside yj let x f yj 1 be 1 if the orientations on f and yj are compatible i e j e 1 ek 1 is a negatively oriented frame in txyj whenever e 1 ek 1 is a positively oriented frame in txf and 1 otherwise define x f m s j 1 f yj z this quantity is locally constant on the connected face f hence it is a constant denoted by f m z we define the k 1 boundary of m as the formal sum k 1 m f skk 1 m f m f note that for a polyhedral manifold m of dimension n with orientable interior mout is a poly hedral complex with a natural orientation on the n 1 dimensional faces and n 2 m out 0 12 sergiu moroianu lemma 4 11 let m be an oriented polyhedral complex of dimension k and m a compactly supported form then m d k 1 m proof by local considerations involving partitions of unity it is enough to prove the claim when the form is supported in a chart domain we may therefore assume that m is a subcomplex of dimension k in a polyhedron p and moreover that is supported in a small ball which only intersects those faces passing through its center on the intersection of this ball with each open k dimensional face y we compute the integral of d using the usual stokes formula obtaining the integral of on the k 1 dimensional faces f bounding y with a sign depending on the compatibility between the orientations on y and f when summing over all y for a fixed f we eventually get f m times the integral of on f 5 transgression forms let x be an l dimensional polytope see section 4 for the definition let e m be a real vector bundle of rank 2 n endowed with a pseudo metric and a compatible connection over a smooth manifold m of arbitrary dimension let v be a family indexed by x of unit length sections in e over m i e a section v x m 2 e such that h v v 1 in particular for every x x v x is a section in e so v can be viewed as a map v c

l rn 1 k 2 n l 1 m here dxv l l x 0 l m e r 2 2 m e and v c x 1 1 m e so b is applied to a volume form on x tensored with a form of degree 2 n l 1 on m higher transgressions of the pfaffian 13 for l 0 the first transgression of the pfaffian of the levi civita connection on the sphere bundle of a riemannian manifold was introduced by chern 6 functoriality like the pfaffian the transgression forms are functorial let e m be a vector bundle with metric and connection and n m a smooth map we equip e with its pull back metric and connection for every family v of unit sections in e indexed by x we get a family v of unit sections in e in this framework t l 1 v t l 1 v 2 n l 1 n when v can be inferred from the context we will write t l 1 y instead of t l 1 vy for the trans gression form with respect to the restriction of v along a subcomplex y of x by functoriality this notation does not lead to confusion we are now ready to prove our main result about transgressions theorem 5 2 let e m be a vector bundle endowed with a semi riemannian metric h and a compatible connection and v a family of unit length sections in e m indexed by an oriented polytope x of dimension l then dt l 1 x t l

of x proof let se m be the locally trivial bundle of unit pseudo spheres in e with respect to h the tangent bundle to se contains the vertical tangent bundle to the fibers there is a natural horizontal complement to this vertical bundle defined by using the connection the horizontal lift of a path r m at a point v s 0 m is the parallel transport of v along thus induces a splitting of tse as tse t vertse tm in the vector bundle e se we have the tautological section s of h length 1 defined by sv v e v e v this connection preserves the pull back metric h still denoted by the same symbol lemma 5 3 let 1 be the pull back connection in e sm then 6 1 s it vertse in the sense that 1 us u for every u t vert v se tv svm ev proof essentially by definition the canonical section s is parallel in horizontal directions with respect to 1 so 1 s is a vertical double form also by definition the pull back connection is trivial in vertical directions so we compute 1 s ds on each vertical pseudo sphere sve where s becomes a map from sve to the fixed vector space ev 14 sergiu moroianu the idea of computing the pfaffian of 1 going back to chern 6 is to modify 1 on se so that s becomes parallel for this define a vertical 1 2 double form 1 se 2 e by s 1 s u s u 2 e for every u t vertse and h 0 for h t horse horizontal denote by a the skew symmetric endomorphism valued 1 form associated to via h as in 2 u v w v a u w h u tse v w e 7 so a using the notation from 2 we identify e with e via the musical isomorphism in terms of h thus 2 e 2 e then 1 s as for t r set t 1 1 t a since a is skew symmetric t clearly preserves h we compute ts tas tit vertse hence 0 s 0 and thus by lemma 3 1 pfh 0 0 we shall recover the paffian of 1 as the integral from 0 to 1 of the t derivative of pf t consider the connection d on the pull back bundle e r se defined by 8 d dt t t dt t 1 t 1 s 1 s this connection also preserves the pull back of the metric h let v x m se be a family of unit sections

are the euclidean variables on x hence for l 0 the integral on 1 x of the second term also vanishes while for l 0 i e when x is a point it reduces to pf by definition the third term from 10 is the sum of the transgressions tf corresponding to the oriented hyperfaces f of x which we denote t x in order to show that tx defined in 9 is the same as the transgression t l 1 x from definition 5 1 we must compute in more detail the pfaffian of d from 8 rd r t 1 r s s 1 t 2 2 1 s 1 s dt s 1 s the products above are in the sense of double forms using the somewhat imprecise but sug gestive notation for the connection 3 over r x m we get for the curvature of d rd r t 1 r v v 1 t 2 2 dxv v 2 dt v dxv v we proceed to analyze the nth power of this double form inside the space of double forms 2 n 2 n r x m 3 e since double forms of even bi order form a commutative algebra we treat this power as a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in these four terms of degree 2 2 we are only interested in those monomials containing the volume form of r x and clearly those terms must contain precisely once the form dt thus the term dt v dxv v ap pears precisely once and so t 1 r v v does not contribute at all since it contains v which already appeared in the former term while for a monomial of top fiber degree 2 n to be nonzero the section v may occur at most once in conclusion of this discussion those monomials from rd n containing the volume form of r x are contained in ndt v dxv v r 1 t 2 2 dxv v 2 n 1 using the binomial formula we write the above as ndt v n 1 k 0 n 1 k 1 t 2 k 2 k dxv v 2 k 1 r

the gauss bonnet formula on polyhedral manifolds 6 1 the allendoerfer weil formula in even dimensions let m be a compact c polyhedral manifold of dimension 2 n endowed with a riemannian metric g let y m be a face of codimension l 0 and ny tm y the normal bundle of y inside m with respect to g the second fundamental form of this inclusion is the bilinear map a ty ty ny a u w m u w y uw hence a is a ny valued double form of degree 1 1 on y we construct from a its dual a smooth section a on ny in the pull back from y of the bundle of double forms a c ny 1 1 y a v g v a 11 for any b c 1 y t y ny pure tensors of the form b b 1 b 2 1 c c 1 c 2 2 define the partial contraction with g by g b c g 1 2 b 1 c 1 b 2 c 2 2 2 y 12 this definition allows us to define by linearity g a a 2 2 y we are now ready to prove the extension of the allendoerfer weil formula 3 for the euler characteristic of a compact riemannian polyhedral manifold theorem 6 1 let m 2 n be a compact riemannian polyhedral manifold then 2 n m m pf r 2 n l 1 n k l 2 1 l 2 k 1 k 1 n k 2 k l y f l m souty by ry 1 2 g a a n k a 2 k l dg here dg is the family of spherical volume forms induced by g on the fibers of the normal sphere bundle sy y while the berezin integral produces a volume form on y the above integral can thus be considered either as an integral on the total space of souty or using fubini s higher transgressions of the pfaffian 17 theorem as an iterated integral first along the fibers of souty y and then on y the symbol l 2 denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to l 2 we use the convention 0 1 also the 0 th power of a tensor like a for 2 k l or ry 1 2 g a a for k n is understood to be always 1 regardless of the vanishing of the tensor in question proof we first give the argument under the assumption that the polyhedral manifold m is regular definition 4 7 thus recovering the main result of 3 the general case requires some additional combinatorial properties of the outer cone complex and will be treated in section 6 2 we apply successively the transgression formula from theorem 5 2 to the vector bundle tm restricted to the various faces of m in increasing order of codimension an outer vector field with nondegenerate zeros starting from the lowest dimensional faces of m we construct a smooth vector field along the boundary faces of m such that for every boundary point x inside the interior of a face y ux lives in the outer sphere s out x y we extend this vector field smoothly to the interior of m and perturb it to a vector field u 0 m tm transverse to the zero section m if the perturbation is small enough in c 0 norm the vector field u will still point in the outer sphere directions at every boundary face define a unit vector field v 0 u 1 u on the complement on the isolated zero set z u of u in m it is a section of the sphere bundle sm m over the complement of z u blow up of the singular set of v 0 let m be the closure of v 0 m z u in the polyhedral manifold sm remark when m is a manifold with corners the compact polyhedral manifold m is naturally diffeomorphic to m z u the total space of the blow up of z u inside m see 14 for the notion of real blow up of manifolds with corners the boundary of the compactification m in sm is obtained by gluing the tangent sphere spm near each annulation point p z u more precisely besides the diffeomorphic image through v 0 of the boundary hyperfaces of m m contains also the inner boundary i e the singular divisor obtained by blowing up the annulation points of u near a non degenerate annulation point p z u there exist local coordinates in which the vector field u takes the form u x x 1 x 1 xr xr xr 1 xr 1 x 2 n x 2 n where the integer r is the index of u at p the new hypersurface introduced by blowing up p is just the compact manifold spm with orientation 1 r 1 times the standard orientation induced from tpm we thus separate the boundary of m as m p z u spm v 0 m into the union of the inner boundary spheres and the diffeomorphic image through v 0 of the boundary of m 18 sergiu moroianu in order to compute the integral of the pfaffian on m we will apply theorem 5 2 to the pull back bundle tm m over the compact polyhedral manifold m endowed with the pull back connection this clever construction due to chern 6 is necessary because m z u is not compact so the stokes formula would need to take into account the contribution of the singularities z u in the transgression forms the ro le of the blow up space m is precisely to resolve this singularity formally since z u is a finite set it has measure 0 by naturality the integral of the pfaffian on m can be computed by pull back on m 13 m pf r v 0 m z u pf r m pf r let t 1 v 0 2 n 1 m z u be the first order transgression on m z u from defini tion 5 1 corresponding to the unit vector field v 0 interpreted as a 0 dimensional simplex of unit vector fields similarly let t 1 s 2 n 1 sm be the first order transgression from defi nition 5 1 corresponding to the canonical unit section s in tm over m sm interpreted as a 0 dimensional simplex of unit vector fields by naturality t 1 v 0 t 1 s on the complement of the zero set z u now m v 0 m p z u spm by stokes formula m pf r m t 1 s m t 1 v 0 p z u spm t 1 s lemma 6 2 chern 6 at a annulation point p z u of index r the integral on the sphere spm of t 1 s equals 1 r 2 n proof apply the definition of the transgression in dimension l 0 for the canonical unit vector field s over m sm here the parameter space x is just a point hence the terms containing dxv vanish the curvature r vanishes on the vertical sphere spm since the connection is pulled back from the base hence the terms with k n 1 also vanish it follows that t 1 s spm 2 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 b s s 2 n 1 where s is given by 6 it follows from this lemma and the poincare hopf theorem that the inner boundary contributions add up like in the boundary less case to 2 n m we thus rewrite 13 as 14 2 n m m pf r m t 1 v 0 this identity finishes the proof of the gauss bonnet theorem for closed manifolds higher transgressions of the pfaffian 19 if m is a compact manifold with boundary we can choose v 0 to be the unit outer normal to m the correction term t 1 m is computed in that case as in the final part of the present proof when m has faces of codimension at least 2 in eq 13 the contribution y t 1 v 0 of a boundary hyperface y depends on the vector field v 0 which cannot be chosen to be the unit normal to y simultaneously for all hyperfaces y in order to write this contribution in terms of the outer unit normal vector field y we use the higher transgressions with respect to the families of unit vector fields vy v 0 y constructed in section 4 4 by theorem 5 2 15 y t 1 v 0 y t 1 vy y t 2 v 0 y the point is the first term in the right hand side does not depend on v 0 while the second is now localized to codimension 2 faces the induction procedure is powered by the next result lemma 6 3 let y f 1 fl be a possibly disconnected face of m where f 1 fl are hyperfaces of m let zj i 6 jfi then l j 1 1 j y t l v 0 zj y t l vy y t l 1 v 0 y proof direct application of stokes formula and theorem 5 2 again by induction for all d 0 we have m pf r 2 n m d l 1 y f l m y t l vy y f d m y t d 1 v 0 y the initial step is eq 15 specializing to the maximal codimension d 2 n 1 we have completely eliminated the non canonical vector field v 0 from the formula m pf r 2 n m 2 n l 1 y f l m y t l vy it remains to identify the contribution of each face in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the faces curvature and second fundamental form let y be a face of codimension l 1 from proposition 4 9 the map vy y y souty is a trivialization of the outer sphere bundle of y in particular it gives a family indexed by y of unit vector fields in tm along y since y is fixed in this argument we write v vy for simplicity the transgression t l vy is defined by t l vy n 1 k l 2 1 c n k l 1 l 1 y b v dy v l 1 v 2 k 2 lrn 1 k 2 n l y 20 sergiu moroianu for x y if souty is the riemannian volume form on the sphere s out x y then d y v l 1 can be expressed as the pull back on y through the map v of the tensor square of the volume form of outer spheres dy v l 1 l 1 v soutx y soutx y thus the second component of the double form v dy v l 1 is a multiple of the volume form of the normal bundle to y it follows that only those terms from v and r whose second component is a form tangent to y may have a nonzero contribution to t l vy these terms are a v the second fundamental form 11 of y in m interpreted as a 1 1 form valued function on ny respectively r y the components of the curvature form of m along y recall that by the gauss equation r y r y 1 2 g a a where the

outer cone bundles are not globally trivial thus we need a new global argument before applying the local computations from the previous sections let i denote the unit interval 0 1 in the pull back of tm over the polyhedral manifold sm ix it we consider the pull back d of the connection d from 8 under the projection off the factor 0 1 x onto sm it d 1 t a where is the projection sm i 2 m and a is the endomorphism valued 1 form defined in 7 with respect to the tautological section s in tm a w s w end tm here t is a deformation parameter as before while x 0 1 will be the variable of a conical deformation of the polyhedral complex mout that we now introduce recall that we have fixed a vector field u on m with isolated nondegenerate zeros and outward pointing along m and we constructed v 0 u u on the complement of z u in particular for every p y f m v 0 p belongs to the convex spherical polytope s out p y where f m is the set of faces of m of codimension at least 1 for every face y f m define a locally trivial bundle of spherical polyhedra conv 0 s outy cosx vp sin x v 0 p x p y vp s outy x i higher transgressions of the pfaffian 21 from proposition 4 10 it follows that the set conv 0 m out y f m conv 0 s outy is a polyhedral complex embedded in m i so conv 0 m out it is a polyhedral complex embedded in m i 2 we enrich this complex by adding to it certain faces at x 1 we start with the image of v 0 i e the face v 0 m z u 1 it of dimension 2 n 1 we complete this face with the 2 n dimensional cylinders spm 1 it for each annulation point p z u proposition 6 4 let m be a polyhedral manifold of dimension 2 n with orientable interior the set p conv 0 m out i v 0 m z u 1 i p z u spm 1 i sm i 2 is a polyhedral complex of dimension 2 n 1 its 2 n boundary is dim m p v 0 m 1

it is a closed form on sm i 2 hence by the stokes formula on polyhedral complexes lemma 4 11 p pf rd 0 moreover pf rd vanishes identically on three of the types of faces of 2 np from 16 it vanishes on conv 0 s outy 0 for y f m and on v 0 m 1 0 because at t 0 the connection d admits a parallel section s it also vanishes on conv 0 s outy 1 for y f m because along t 1 the connection d is the pull back of from the base via the projection sm i m hence by functoriality the pfaffian pf rd is a horizontal form however since dim y 2 n rk tm the pfaffian of vanishes on y in conclusion of this discussion by integrating pf rd on the polyhedral complexes from 16 we get after using 14 and pull back by v 0 m pf r 2 n m y f m souty it pf rd to conclude the proof we note that the restriction of d to x 0 coincides with the connection d defined in 8 moreover the computation of souty i pf rd carried out above in the regular case is local in the base y so it remains valid even without the regularity assumption on m 6 3 odd dimensions this case follows directly from the even dimensional case as we now explain 22 sergiu moroianu theorem 6 5 let n g be a compact riemannian polyhedral manifold of odd dimension 2 n 1 then 2 n n 2 n 1 l 1 n 1 k l 12 1 l 1 2 k 1 n 1 k 2 k 1 l y f l n souty by ry 1 2 g a a n 1 k a 2 k 1 l dg by convention 1 0 0 1 and the 0 th power of a double form is always 1 proof apply theorem 6 1 to the product manifold m n i where i is the interval 0 1 endowed with the product metric h g dt 2 the euler characteristics of m and n coincide we will exploit the fact that the vertical vector field t is parallel along m but also along y i for every face y of n the boundary faces of m fall into two types lateral faces of the form y i and top or bottom faces of the form y 0 or y 1 the first type of faces do not contribute in the gauss bonnet formula indeed the curvature form ry i and the second fundamental form ay i of y i inside n i both vanish in the direction of the parallel vector field t it follows that the berezin integral inside the term from theorem 6 1 corresponding to the face y i vanishes identically the outer spheres in m of the second type of faces e g y 0 can be described as spherical cones over the outer sphere of y in n more precisely let v be an euclidean vector space s the unit sphere in v v a hyperplane in v and a s v a subset of s lying in a subsphere of codimension 1 let p 0 p 1 v s so p 0 and p 1 are diametrally opposed and a sits in the equatorial hypersphere orthogonal to p 0 and p 1 we define the spherical cone of a with respect to p 0 as the union of all geodesic segments in s linking p 0 to a the complement of the vertex p 0 the open spherical cone is isometric to a topological product a 0 2 with the warped product metric cos 2 ga d 2 note for later use that the volume densities induced by g and ga on the fibers of the outer spheres satisfy the identity 17 dg cos dim v 2 d dga lemma 6 6 let sout y be the outer sphere of y in n and sout y 0 the outer sphere of y 0 in m then for every x y soutx y 0 is the spherical cone of s out x y with respect to the point t moreover the union for all x y of the open spherical cones form a locally trivial bundle with fiber type 0 2 over sout y using this lemma we can carry out the integral in i e along the fibers of the spherical cone fibration of the integrands from theorem 6 1 for a fixed x y the curvature ry and the metric higher transgressions of the pfaffian 23 contraction of the second fundamental form g a a are pull backs from the base i e they are constant on the outer sphere the dual a of the second fundamental form is linear on the normal bundle to y and vanishes at the vertical vector t hence for v s out x y a cos v sin t cos a v now the volume form on the spherical cones is given by 17 it follows that the push forward along the fibers of the spherical cones over soutx y of by ry 1 2 g a a n 1 k a 2 k 1 l dgm amounts to i 2 kby ry 1 2 g a a n 1 k a 2 k 1 l dgn where i 2 k is a scaling factor independent of x i 2 k 2 2 cos 2 k d 2 k 1 2 k we have used the convention 0 0 1 1 7 constant curvature polyhedral manifolds with geodesic faces by applying the gauss bonet theorems 6 1 and 6 5 to the case of polyhedral manifolds of con stant sectional curvature with totally geodesic faces we obtain certain identities for spherical euclidean and hyperbolic polyhedra in terms of volumes of faces and measures of outer angles 7 1 euclidean polyhedra let m be a flat compact polyhedral manifold of dimension k with totally geodesic faces in this case the gauss bonnet simply states that the sum of the outer angles at the vertices of m equals the euler characteristic m divided by the volume of the k 1 sphere indeed in theorems 6 1 and 6 5 the curvature ry of the face y and the second fundamental form a of y m both vanish so the only non zero terms in the right hand side arises for codim y k i e when y is a point in that case the integral corresponding to a vertex y gives the volume of the outer sphere at the vertex y and the formula becomes vol sk 1 m y f k outy in particular the euler characteristic of a flat compact polyhedral manifold with totally geodesic faces is always non negative and it is necessarily positive as soon as m has at least one vertex this identity is clear for open polytopes in rk since the outer spheres of the vertices partition the unit sphere sk 1 into spherical polytopes with mutually disjoint interiors but in general it is not obvious a direct proof should rely on some additivity property of outer angles 24 sergiu moroianu 7 2 manifolds of constant sectional curvature with geodesic faces let m g be a compact polyhedral manifold with constant scalar curvature k and with geodesic faces then r k 2 g 2 valid on every face since the second fundamental form a of any face y is assumed to vanish we also have a 0 therefore theorems 6 1 and 6 5 give 2 n m n k 0 2 k 1 k 1 n k y f 2 k m souty by ry n k dg for dim m 2 n 2 n n 1 n n k 1 2 k 3 n k y f 2 k 1 n souty by ry n k dg for dim n 2 n 1 where we recall that f h denotes the set of faces of codimension h 0 on a face y of dimension 2 j we compute moreover for r ry rj kj 2 j 2 j dgy dgy by r j kj 2 j 2 j dgy in conclusion regardless of the parity of d dim m the gauss bonnet formula becomes the sum 1 over the even dimensional faces of md advertised in the introduction as theorem 1 1 dehn 11 studied such identities for small dimensions and predicted their existence in general allendoerfer weil s formula from 3 was used by santalo 17 for deducing particular cases of 1 for polyhedra embedded in a constant curvature space form for a spherical simplex inside sk the identity was also announced by kenzi sato 19 7 3 hyperbolic polyhedra with ideal vertices as an extension of the previous example the hyperbolic identity allows us to compute the volume of hyperbolic 2 n polyhedra with some or all ideal vertices in terms of outer angles and volumes of lower dimensional faces by passing to the limit the gauss bonnet formula for compact polyhedra for instance when 2 n 4 the volume of an ideal hyperbolic 4 simplex is given by vol m 2 2 3 y f 2 m out y where out y is the outer dihedral angle of the ideal triangle y in m i e the angle between the outer normals to the two hyperfaces containing y 8 closing remarks the gauss bonnet formula 3 continues to hold on complete manifolds with warped product ends with a decay condition on the warping functions 16 and for asymptotically cylindrical metrics 1 if m g is a smooth compact riemannian manifold with boundary the gauss bonnet formula contains a correction term along the boundary in terms of the second fundamen tal form 3 6 extensions of this formula to more general metrics on the interior of a manifold with boundary were found by satake 18 for riemannian orbifolds by albin 1 dai wei 10 and by cibotaru and the author 9 for manifolds with fibered boundaries by mcmullen 13 for higher transgressions of the pfaffian 25 cone manifolds by anderson 4 for asymptotically hyperbolic einstein 4 manifolds and again in 9 for incomplete edge metrics to cite only a few results in this direction the proofs typically start from a degeneration process in the gauss bonnet formula for manifolds with boundary in contrast the gauss bonnet formula on a riemannian polyhedral manifold does not seem to follow from such a degeneration although it may appear tempting to consider a neighborhood of m as a c 1 smoothing of the boundary and then try to compute the limit of the boundary integrand as 0 by interpreting the smoothed boundary as a current like in 8 we were not able to isolate with that approach the contributions of lower dimensional faces acknowledgements the author was
