dedicated to w kirsch and b simon as part of the celebration of their recent birthdays we are grateful for their inspiration abstract we prove a quantitative uncertainty principle at low energies for the laplacian on fairly general weighted graphs with a uniform explicit control of the constants in terms of geometric quantities a major step consists in establishing lower bounds for dirichlet eigenvalues in terms of the geometry 1 introduction it is a phenomenon of general interest that low energy states of laplacians are extended in some sense several closely related concepts deal with that fact one of them is unique continuation for subsolutions of elliptic equations we refer to 1 2 4 24 26 for a small selection of the long list of contri butions and remark that there was renewed interest in quantitative versions due to the importance of such results for random schr dinger operators as seen in 10 see also 9 34 35 41 43 and the literature quoted there for more recent results in its original form unique continuation means that such subsolutions cannot vanish to infinite order this is true in a variety of continuum contexts and certainly not true for graph laplacians in fact discrete laplacians even allow for eigenfunctions with compact support for the special case of a tight binding model associated with the penrose tiling the occurrence of this effect has been known since quite some time as wit nessed for example in the physics literature 3 19 37 36 this phenomenon mathematisches institut friedrich schiller universit t jena 07743 jena germany daniel lenz uni jena

continuation holds due to curvature conditions as first shown 32 and later generalized in 28 for the above mentioned applications to random schr dinger operators quite a different point of view is important namely states are required to be extended in the sense that the norm of restrictions to subsets remains relevant provided the subset one restricts the function to is spread out in space many of the references above deal with that kind of uncertainty principle and establish such kind of lower bounds provided the function in question is an eigenfunction of a schr dinger operator or more generally in the range of the spectral projection of a schr dinger operator onto a small interval of the energy axis in view of the above mentioned phenomenon of compactly supported eigenfunctions one cannot hope for an analogous result in the discrete case however as we will show in the present paper uncertainty principles hold for low energy states of graph laplacians and the results allow for a uniform estimate for large classes of graphs with an explicit control of constants phrased in terms of geometric properties while our results are pretty general we stress the fact that they provide new insights even in the most simple cases e g the usual euclidean lattices zd for this case related results have been found in 17 42 for a more detailed comparison we refer to the discussion following our main theorem 5 1 starting point of our method of proof is a spectral theoretic uncertainty principle theorem 1 1 from 11 it deals with a semibounded selfadjoint operator h in some hilbert space a bounded nonnegative operator w and phrases uncertainty or unique continuation in terms of the spectral projec tions pi pi h of h it says that piwpi pi 1 provided there is t 0 such that max i min h tw t 2 actually in this case an explicit lower bound on is easily established viz t max i t where the proof goes by contraposition merely using the variational charac terization of the spectrum and functional calculus for the application we have in mind h is the laplacian on a weighted graph x that obeys some mild assumptions and w 1 d is the indicator function of a subset that is spread out in x in the sense that for some r 0 x p d br p 2 this condition is also known as relative denseness of the set d in x it is clear that in this case 1 amounts to 2 1 1 d 2 for all ran pi meaning that we have a quantitative unique continuation result for linear combinations of eigenfunctions with eigenvalues in i and more general func tions in the range of the corresponding spectral projection here depends on i and the optimal r that satisfies the above covering condition see 11 as explained above such unique continuation estimates are somewhat as tonishing in the graph setting since graph laplacians can exhibit compactly supported eigenfunctions however our main result does not exclude such compactly supported eigenfunctions and applies to graphs where the lat ter occur this is not a contradiction as our result only applies to energy intervals i concentrated near 0 the idea of our method can be summarized as follows sending t in 2 with w 1 d we see that the maximal energy range for which 1 gives nontrivial results is determined by sup t 0 min h t 1 d min h 1 d where the non densely defined form sum h 1 d h is the dirichlet laplacian in a suitable sense on x d our first task is therefore to get lower bounds for this h in terms of geo metric quantities of the underlying graph and the sets and d respectively this is discussed in section 3 theorem 3 12 shows h 1 r sup vol br p p d where r inr is the inradius of see section 2 below for the definition of volume in our weighted graph setting this bound is a generalization of a well known bound for finite graphs to infinite geometries under some mild assumptions on the weighted graph in our proof of the theorem we reduce the infinite graph to a disjoint union of finite graphs and this is a crucial step in our approach it is achieved via a voronoi type decomposition the existence of such a decomposition may be of interest in other contexts as well to show this existence we need the rather careful analysis of basic features of the underlying geometry provided in section 2 note that the bound in the theorem is weaker than what is known in the euclidean case for rn where the corresponding dirichlet laplacian is bounded below by constr 2 for domains with nice enough boundary see theorem 1 5 8 in davies 14 however our bound is optimal up to constants as was pointed out to us by 3 a grigor yan theorem 4 1 from 5 contains examples when this estimate is optimal for balls thank you sasha in order to use 1 we will further need to control the convergence of min h t 1 d to min h luckily we are in a discrete situation since the corresponding convergence would not be true in euclidean space in our case under the assumption that our laplacian h is bounded we get convergence in norm resolvent sense for the operators and with an explicit convergence rate of optimal order as shown in section 4 below it is then easy to put things together in section 5 and obtain our main results theorem 5 1 and its corollary giving a version of 1 for the case at hand with explicit control over in terms of the geometry in section 6 we further discuss the case of combinatorial graphs and in particular compare our approach to lower bounds for h in theorem 3 12 with the approach via cheeger inequalities in section 7 we discuss how theorem 3 12 can be extended to certain cases where a potential is added to h finally we mention an upcoming companion paper 46 dealing with the continuum case of laplacians and more general divergence form operators 2 the set up we start by introducing our basic set up within the context of weighted graphs see 29 for a recent survey of this and related topics a weighted graph x b m is given by a countable set x finite or infinite a symmetric weight function b x x 0 with b x x 0 for all x x and y x b x y for all x x a weight function m x 0 here m induces a measure on x through vol a m a x a m x our basic hilbert space will be 2 x m f cx f 2 x x f x 2 m x the function b above should be thought of as a weight on the edges and it appears in the energy form of the laplacian as well as in the distance we define on x more precisely we consider the nonnegative form e f g 1 2 x y x b x y f x f y g x g y 4 we will always assume the boundedness condition b supx x 1 m x y x b x y this condition is equivalent to boundedness of the form and consequently the associated selfadjoint operator h more precisely h 2 see 23 thm 9 3 and the literature cited there the associated selfadjoint operator is known as weighted laplacian and given by hf x 1 m x y x b x y f x f y for f 2 x m and x x as follows from 30 theorem 5 for us the relevant distance on x is given in the following way an edge of the weighted graph x b m is a set x y with positive weight b x y 0 denote by e the set of all edges clearly that induces the structure of a combinatorial graph x e a path is a finite sequence of edges with nonempty intersections that can most easily be written as x 0 x 1 xk where b xj xj 1 0 for all j 0 k 1 if we want to specify the endpoints we say that is a path from x 0 to xk the length of such a path is given by l j 0 k 1 1 b xj xj 1 in particular the length of an edge x y is given by 1 b x y to include trivial cases we also allow trivial paths x x from x to x whose length is 0 we will throughout assume that our graph is connected in the sense that every pair of points is connected by a path the distance between x and y is given by d x y inf l a path from x to y clearly d is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality moreover by the assumptions on b we have for any x x the estimate sup z b x z z b x z and this implies d x y 1 supz b x z 0 for any y x with y 6 x so we see that d separates the points and hence we get that d is a metric we denote by ur x y x d x y r and br x y x d x y r the open and closed balls of radius r respectively we note in passing that while the graph x e is connected x is totally disconnected in the topo logical sense as it is discrete by what we have just shown for our later considerations we will need the heine borel property i e that closed balls in x are compact as our space has discrete topology this is equivalent to the following finiteness condition 5 f for any x x and r 0 the set br x is finite we will also need that x is geodesic in the sense that the following condition holds g between any x y x there exists a path x 0 x 1 xk with x 0 x xk y and d x y l it is easy to see that f implies g compare also proof of part d of proposition 2 1 below in fact even the converse is true 25 see remark 2 4 below as well by what we already mentioned in the introduction the volume of balls will enter our results as one important quantity in particular we will need uniform bounds on the volumes of balls of fixed radius v for any r 0 the inequality supx x m br x holds as r 0 is possible the previous condition clearly implies a uniform bound on m in the following form m mmax supx x m x given b it turns out that m alone already implies f g and v in fact b and m together can be seen to imply a rather homogeneous geometry this is discussed next the crucial point is that b and m together imply a uniform upper bound for b and even for the vertex degree deg x y b x y bmax sup x y x b x y sup x x y x b x y mmax proposition 2 1 homogeneity of the geometry let x b m be as above in particular connected and such that b and m hold then a for any path we have l b 1 max where indicates the car dinality in particular x is uniform discrete more precisely any two different points x y x have uniform distance at least 1 bmax b x d is locally compact and complete c the condition f holds in a very uniform manner more specifically br x r mmax r bmax 1 for any r 0 and x x in particular v holds d x d is geodesic i e g holds 6 proof a as b x y bmax for all x y we see that any two different points have minimal distance 1 bmax this gives the last part of the statement of a now the first part follows directly b this follows as different points have a minimal distance by a c by a the points in br x can be reached from x by paths with not more than r bmax edges moreover in the relevant paths no edge can be longer than r thus we will just estimate the number of path with not more than r bmax edges of length not exceeding r now by b and m the number nr p of edges going out from an arbitrary p x with length not exceeding r is bounded by nr p 1 r z x b p z mmax the preceding considerations directly imply the given bound for br x from m we then obtain v d by c any ball has only finitely many points consider now arbitrary x y x and set r d x y then y belongs to br 1 x by b the ball br 1 x has only finitely many points thus there exist only finitely many paths in br 1 x and every path from x to y with length less than d x y 1 lies completely in br 1 x so the infimum over the lengths of all paths between x and y can be calculated by taking the minimum over the lengths of paths between x and y in br 1 x and this implies d this easily gives the desired statement our setting for the remaining part of the paper will be a connected x b m such that b and m hold by the previous proposition this will imply validity of f g and v of course connectedness is not a real issue if the graph is not con nected it decomposes into connected clusters and the laplacian will just be the direct sum of the laplacians on the corresponding clusters hence our statements will remain true if properly adapted the only change is that d as defined above is no longer a metric in the sense that the value infinity might occur although our setting allows for more general weighted graphs readers may always assume that we are dealing with usual combinatorial graphs and the associated laplacians our results are relevant and new in this more specialized setting as well for which we now single out two particularly important classes note that the usual euclidean lattices belong to the first class of examples and up to a multiplication of the measure by a constant also to the second class of examples example 2 2 combinatorial situation starting from a combinatorial graph g x e we set b x y 1 whenever there is an edge from x to y and 7 b x y 0 else and m 1 then our laplacian agrees with the usual graph laplacian and the distance is the well known combinatorial or graph distance our basic assumptions are satisfied if and only if g is connected and the vertex degree is uniformly bounded example 2 3 normalized situation let x be an arbitrary countable set with more than one element and let b x x 0 be symmetric with b x x 0 and y b x y for all x x assume that x is connected and define m x 0 m x y x b x y due to connectedness there must exist from any x x a y x with b x y 0 and we find m x 0 for any x x as is clear from the the construction the condition b holds with 1 in particular the form e and the operator h are automatically bounded in this situation so in this case the basic assumption is satisfied if and only if the graph is connected and m is bounded remark 2 4 the metric d and related metrics are sometimes discussed under the name of path metrics on graphs they have appeared in various places a study of topological features of graphs equipped with d is given in 20 completeness of the space x equipped with respect to path metrics has played a role in recent investigations of essential selfadjointness of laplacians on graphs 47 40 25 an important step in the considerations of 40 gives that completeness with respect to a certain path metric implies finiteness of metric balls this was generalized in 25 to a hopf rinow type theorem giving that for any path metric completeness of x is equivalent to finiteness of metric balls and implies existence of geodesics a further discussion of d and other metrics in the context of suitable pre compactness conditions for graphs is given in 21 our framework given by b and m and the consequences for the geometry seem not to have been studied before 3 lower bounds for the dirichlet laplacian from the introduction we know that an interesting situation to study is that on d x we have an infinite potential denoting by x d we get the form e e on dom e f dom e 2 x m f 0 on d as the limit in the strong resolvent sense of h t 1 d as t see section 4 for further details 8 we identify 2 m with f 2 x m f 0 on d and get an associated selfadjoint operator h defined on 2 m for us e and h will be the restriction of the energy form and the laplacian respectively to with dirichlet boundary conditions remark 3 1 a it is quite reasonable to call h the dirichlet laplacian in the continuum euclidean case under mild regularity assumptions on the boundary of open in rn it holds that lim t t 1 rn is the dirichlet laplacian and the convergence holds in the strong re solvent sense see section 4 for references b it is also reasonable to call another operator the dirichlet laplacian in the discrete case see for example section 5 2 in 31 this is adopted by many authors who add a penalty term in order to force the subadditivity known from the continuum case in fact our dirichlet laplacian does in general not obey that hu v is smaller than hu hv for disjoint u and v in our application to unique continuation the main role is played by d the set on which the potential barrier is given for the present section we slightly change the point of view and concentrate on the set x we define the inradius of by inr sup r 0 x ur x we are particularly interested in min h the bottom of the spectrum of the dirichlet laplacian h note that this latter operator is defined on 2 but its definition is always to be under stood relative to the bigger ambient graph x we will first deal with the finite volume situation in the next theorem theorem 3 2 let x b m be as above in particular connected and such that b and m hold let a non empty x with 6 x be given and assume vol and inr a we have 1 inr vol b if vol x then h vol x vol vol x 9 proof ad a let r inr let f dom e and x by definition of the inradius there is x 0 ur x in particular there is a path x 0 xk from x 0 to x xk of length at most r and f x 0 0 therefore f x 2 f x f x 0 2 k 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 f xj 1 f xj 1 b xj xj 1 2 k 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 f xj 1 f xj 2 k 1 j 0 1 b xj xj 1 e f f r since f 2 supx f x 2 vol we get f 2 r vol e f f and this is the desired lower bound since r inr was arbitrary ad b note that e 1 1 0 under these conditions we will define a suitable trial function in fact let c 1 normalized so that c vol 1 2 since h and consequently h is bounded dom e we will estimate the energy of by calculating the projection 0 p 0 where p 0 is the orthogonal projection onto the constant functions and hence leaves h invariant we get 0 1 vol x 1 x 1 x with 1 x x cm x vol 1 2 and therefore 0 2 vol vol x and 0 2 1 0 2 vol x vol vol x since h 0 0 e e 0 0 h 0 2 h vol x vol vol x as is supported in we have e e by the definition of e and the preceding estimate gives of h remark 3 3 a for finite combinatorial graphs the lower bound is a familiar bound and our proof follows known lines compare lemma 1 9 in 12 and lemma 2 4 in 5 for related estimates 10 b the upper bound is interesting as it shows that a lower bound like in the continuum euclidean case for domains with nice enough boundary namely in the form const inr 2 see theorem 1 5 8 in 14 will not be possible indeed for any connected finite graph x we can take d to consist of just a single element of x then h vol x vol vol x h mmax vol will be bounded in terms of the inverse volume of now this can be much smaller than a second power of the inverse inner radius as can be seen by considering e g a ball in an n dimensional euclidean lattice with n 3 and choosing as set d just the center of this ball c as mentioned in the introduction theorem 4 1 from 5 gives that the lower bound is optimal up to constants to lift the above result to the case of infinite volume we introduce the concept of a voronoi decomposition this concept may be of interest in other contexts as well in fact for combinatorial laplacians it has already proven useful in 44 definition 3 4 let x b m be as above and d x non empty a voronoi decomposition of x with centers from d is a pairwise disjoint family vp p d such that following conditions hold v 1 for each p d the point p belongs to vp and for all x vp there exists a path from p to x that lies in vp and satisfies l d p x v 2 for each p d and for all x vp the inequality d p x d q x holds for any q d v 3 p d vp x remark 3 5 the condition v 1 and v 2 imply that for any p d the set vp contains p and is connected and any x vp satisfies d p x d q x for any q d however it is not hard to see by examples that v 1 and v 2 are even stronger than these two conditions i e that connectedness of the vp does not imply that they contain geodesics in our investigation of voronoi decompositions we will need some further concepts we define the covering radius of d by covr d inf r 0 p d br p x 0 with the usual convention inf and say that d is relatively dense provided covr d 11 lemma 3 6 let x b m be as above d x and x d then covr d inr proof let r covr d which is set to if d is not relatively dense then p d br p 6 x which means that there is x 0 with br x 0 d and therefore inr r consequently covr d inr conversely r inr gives x 0 and r r inr s t br x 0 u r x 0 which means that x 0 6 p d br p and therefore r covr d consequently covr d inr remark 3 7 if d is relatively dense in x then the infimum in the definition of the covering radius is even a minimum i e x p d br p for r covr d holds to see this chose an arbitrary x x and consider br 1 x d by the definition of the covering radius this set contains a sequence pn d with inf d pn x r moreover by f this set is finite thus it must contain a p d with d p x r as x x was arbitrary the desired statement follows here is our result on existence of a voronoi decomposition proposition 3 8 let x b m be as above and assume that d x is non empty then there exists a voronoi decomposition with centers from d moreover whenever r covr d is finite then any voronoi decomposition vp p d of x with centers from d has the property that vp br p for all p d proof we first show existence of a voronoi decomposition with centers from d a family vp p d of pairwise disjoint subsets of x is called admissible if it satisfies v 1 and v 2 from definition 3 4 above evidently vp p p d gives such an admissible family with the obvious ordering we can apply zorn s lemma and get a maximal admissible family we will show now that such a maximal family is a voronoi decomposition i e satisfies as well v 3 p d vp x assume otherwise then there exists an x x which does not belong to w p d vp now as x is connected and d is not empty there exists an r 0 such that the set s br x d 12 is not empty indeed we may just take r d x q for any q d moreover s is finite as br x is finite due to proposition 2 1 therefore there exists a p s with minimal distance to x i e with d p x d u x 3 for any u s by p s clearly d p x r holds thus 3 holds also for u x br x d hence we see that 3 holds for all u d moreover as our space is geodesic due to proposition 2 1 there exists a path x 0 xk with x 0 p and xk x and d p x l k 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 1 then for any u d we must have d u xl l 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 1 4 for any l 1 k as otherwise we would arrive at d u x d u xl d xl x k 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 1 d p x which contradicts 3 consider now the smallest index l 0 k 1 with xl w and xl 1 w such an l exists as x 0 p w and x xk w by our assumption let q d be such that xl vq by v 2 applied to vq we then have d q xl d p xl l 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 1 combined with 4 this gives d q xl d p xl l 1 j 0 b xj xj 1 1 5 putting this together we arrive at d q xl 1 d q xl d xl xl 1 d q xl b xl xl 1 1 5 l j 0 b xj xj 1 1 4 d u xl 1 13 for any u d this chain of inequalities gives not only d q xl 1 d u xl 1 for all u d but also if we set u q d q xl 1 d q xl b xl xl 1 1 thus we could add xl 1 to vq and obtain the admissible decomposition v u u d with v q vq xl 1 and v u vu for q 6 u d this is a contradiction to maximality thus we infer that a maximal admissible family satisfies v 1 v 2 and v 3 we now show the last statement so let vp p d be a voronoi decomposition let p d and x vp be arbitrary as covr d r there must exist a q d with d q x r by v 2 we then infer d p x d q x r this shows vp br p remark 3 9 we note that the proof of the previous proposition does not require b and m but only the weaker heine borel property f and the resulting existence of geodesics g thus the proposition will be true in even more general situations than the standard setting of our paper note also that the existence statement of the proposition does not need relative denseness of the set d although the existence of a voronoi decomposition might sound rather natural it does require some non trivial geometric input it does not hold under the sole assumption of g as can be seen by the following simple example here comes a geodesic weighted graph that does not allow a voronoi decomposition example 3 10 let x n 0 1 1 with weight b n 0 n 1 0 2 for n n b n 0 1 1 1 1 n 1 for n n and b x y 0 else since none of the points from d n 0 is closest to the point 1 1 there is no voronoi decomposition of x with centers in d in the above sense the next example is a variant of the previous one with the additional feature that each vertex has at most three adjacent vertices it consists of one ray with finite total diameter and one additional leave emanating at each site the edge weights are chosen such that the distance of the leaves to the origin of the ray become shorter and shorter here are the details example 3 11 let x n 1 n 0 set b n 1 n 1 1 2 4 n 1 14 and b n 1 n 0 4 n 1 and b x y 0 else the example is a tree and hence clearly satisfies g moreover a short computation shows that the distance of n 0 to 1 1 is given by 2 3 1 3 1 4 n 1 so none of the points from d n 0 is closest to 1 1 hence there is no voronoi decomposition theorem 3 12 let x b m be as above in particular connected and such that b and m hold and assume that d x is relatively dense x d then 1 inr vol inr where vol s sup x x vol bs x remark 3 13 a note that vol s for any s 0 due to proposition 2 1 b the proof shows that we can actually replace vol s by the slightly better vol s supx x vol bs x proof let vp p d be the voronoi decomposition from the preceding proposition then for f dom e i e f 0 on d x we have e f f 1 2 x y b x y f x f y 2 1 2 p d x y vp b x y f x f y 2 for each p d we have f dom evp p and thus 1 2 x y vp b x y f x f y 2 vp p f 1 vp p 2 vp p f 1 vp 2 to this we apply theorem 3 2 with vp p to get after reinserting the sum over p d e f f p d 1 inr vp p vol vp p f 1 vp 2 by the previous proposition we know vp br p with r covr d more over by v 1 any x vp is connected to p by a path in vp of length d p x r this gives inr vp p r as r covr d inr see lemma 3 6 the desired statement follows easily while in the context of our subject matter here the framework of bounded laplacians and more specifically the assumptions b and m are natural requirements the study of lower bounds of laplacians can be generalized to more general weighted graphs we refer to the upcoming papers 39 and 38 for more details 15 4 the large coupling limit in this section we study the large coupling limit h t 1 d h more thoroughly recall that in the situation we have in mind h is a weighted laplacian on some weighted 2 x m and d x is a subset x d we already noticed that the above convergence takes place in the strong resolvent sense as can easily be seen from kato s monotone convergence theorem see 27 thm 3 13 a p 461 for the densely defined and 45 thm 4 1 p 383 for the general case under the assumption that h is bounded we actually see that we even have norm resolvent convergence with optimal decay rate 1 t and uniform bounds that depend on h only see proposition 4 2 below the analogous problem is much more intricate in the continuum there with h one needs certain regularity assumptions on to even get strong resolvent convergence and these regularity assumptions will not suffice to decide norm resolvent convergence in this context we refer to 7 8 for results on norm convergence in a rather general framework and further references in our case we don t even need to take into account the special structure so in what follows let h be a hilbert space p h h 1 the orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace 0 6 h 1 h to avoid trivialities q the orthogonal projection onto h 1 h 2 0 h a bounded selfadjoint operator on h and ht h tq q again monotone convergence implies that the corresponding forms et con verge as t to the closed form e given by dom e f h sup t htf f h 1 e f g hf g remark 4 1 the unique selfadjoint operator in h 1 associated with e is given by php proposition 4 2 for t 2 h 1 2 we have ht 1 1 p php 1 1 p 4 h 1 2 1 t note that p php 1 1 p php 1 1 0 the resolvent of php which is defined on h 1 extended by 0 to h 1 h 2 16 proof of the proposition we use the schur complement by decomposing ht according to h 1 h 2 into a block operator matrix ht phtp phtq qhtp qhtq since pq qp 0 ht 1 p h 1 p p h 1 q q h 1 p q h t 1 q a b b dt for t 0 dt is invertible with d 1 t 1 t 1 consequently the schur complement st p h 1 p bd 1 t b is boundedly invertible for large enough t since p h 1 p 1 and bd 1 t b h 1 2 1 1 t more precisely we get st 1 2 and s 1 t 2 for t 2 h 1 2 using the schur complement to invert ht 1 gives ht 1 1 s 1 t s 1 t bd 1 t d 1 t b s 1 t d 1 t 1 b s 1 t b d 1 t therefore ht 1 1 p php 1 1 p s 1 t p h 1 p 1 s 1 t bd 1 t d 1 t b s 1 t d 1 t 1 b s 1 t b d 1 t can be bounded in norm by 2 max s 1 t p h 1 p 1 d 1 t b s 1 t d 1 t 1 b s 1 t b d 1 t using the resolvent equation for the first term as well as the above bounds gives the claim lemma 4 3 let h 2 0 be a selfadjoint operator on h h 1 0 a selfadjoint operator possibly on a subspace h 1 i min hi for i 1 2 and assume that 1 2 then 0 1 2 1 1 2 h 1 1 1 h 2 1 1 h 1 1 2 h 1 1 1 h 2 1 1 the latter provided h 1 is bounded 17 proof denote h 1 1 1 h 2 1 1 since hi i we get hi 1 1 i 1 1 which gives h 2 1 1 1 1 1 thus h 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 as claimed in case that h 1 is bounded the spectrum is bounded by the norm this argument extends to the case where h 1 is defined on a subspace h 1 with h 1 1 1 is to be read as h 1 1 1 0 on h h 1 h 1 given the previous two results we immediately infer the following corollary 4 4 in the situation of proposition 4 2 let t min ht and min php then we have t for all t 0 and for t 2 h 1 2 t 4 h 1 2 1 2 t 1 4 h 1 4 t 1 5 a quantitative unique continuation result for the laplacian on graphs we are now in position to derive our main result by combining what we have established so far we let x b m be as above in particular connected and such that b and m hold and assume that d x is relatively dense x d we recall that by 11 thm 1 1 pi h 1 dpi h pi h provided there is t 0 such that max i min h t 1 d t 6 actually in this case t max i t moreover in virtue of theorem 3 12 we have a lower bound on min h viz 1 inr vol inr 18 and by corollary 4 4 applied with we have a lower bound t 4 h 1 2 1 2 1 t 1 7 for t 2 h 1 2 from these bounds we easily get theorem 5 1 let x b m be as above d x relatively dense and x d 6 let i r such that max i then pi h 1 dpi h max i 2 16 h 1 2 1 2 pi h 8 proof using 7 we find pi h 1 dpi h pi h for a satisfying sup t 2 h 1 2 max i 4 h 1 2 1 2 1 t 1 t to make things easier we replace 1 t 1 by 1 t which gives a lower bound hence we are left to find the maximum of f t c 0 t c 1 t 2 for t 2 h 1 2 for an appropriate choice of c 0 and c 1 the corresponding argument is tmax 2 c 1 c 0 8 h 1 2 1 2 max i 2 h 1 2 with maximal value max i 2 16 h 1 2 1 2 the assertion given the preceding theorem we can now use the lower bound from the orem 3 12 and the trivial bound h h to obtain the following corollary corollary 5 2 let x b m be as above d x relatively dense and x d 6 let i r such that max i 1 inr vol inr then pi h 1 dpi h 1 inr vol inr max i 2 16 h 1 4 pi h 9 19 we go on to compare our results with those obtained by rojas molina 42 and elgart and klein 17 who treat the euclidean lattices zd first note that distances are measured somewhat differently in comparison to what we do here e g an r delone set in the sense of 42 would have covering radius bounded above by d r therefore we suppress such numerical constants right now to make things easier and use to indicate the corresponding relations the energy range for the uncertainty principle in our notation the largest possible max i is given by e w r 2 d 2 in 42 while our result gives the better r d 1 in comparison 17 provide a lower bound r 2 d using a cheeger inequality here again our estimate is better we discuss this in more detail in the next section 6 a closer look at the combinatorial situation in this section we consider the combinatorial situation and exhibit a large class of models viz combinatorial graphs with subexponential growth of balls to which our results can be applied along the way we also compare our approach to the approach via cheeger inequalities used in 17 throughout this section we consider the case of combinatorial graphs i e a connected graph x b m with m 1 and b taking values in 0 1 such that with a suitable 0 we have y x b x y for all x d in fact in this case supx y x b x y 1 is the maximal vertex degree and vol s sup x x vol bs x sup x x bs x we will be particularly interested in the case inf h 0 as we will have non trivial applications of our main results in this case as is well known this case can be characterized via the cheeger constant or isoperimetric constant inf 6 s x s s vol s where the combinatorial boundary s of s is given by s x y x x x s y s and b x y 1 indeed this characterization is given as inf h 0 0 here the implication follows easily by a direct computation specifi cally for any finite set s we find e 1 s 1 s s 20 as well as 1 s 2 vol s where 1 s denotes the characteristic function the implication follows from the cheeger inequality inf h 2 2 this inequality goes back to 15 in a slightly different formulation see 6 and the discussion below as well a well known consequence of these considerations is that inf h 0 whenever the volume growth of balls is subexponential proposition 6 1 assume that for one and thus all x x lim sup n log vol bn x n 0 10 then inf h 0 proof the assumption implies that inf n vol bn 1 x bn x vol bn x 0 as otherwise we had vol bn 1 x 1 nvol b 1 x with being the non vanishing value of the infimum and this would lead to exponential vol ume growth moreover a direct combinatorial argument shows that bn x vol bn 1 x bn x putting this together we infer 0 hence by the preceding considerations the statement on the infimum of the spectrum follows now let d x be relatively dense and set x d 6 if 0 or equivalently inf h 0 we obtain from theorem 3 12 inf h 1 inr vol inr 0 inf h so the infimum of the spectrum of h is indeed bigger than the infimum of the spectrum of h in this case whenever i r is an interval containing 0 with max i 1 inr vol inr we have pi h 6 0 so we can in partic ular apply from corollary 5 2 to obtain a non trivial inequality as 0 holds whenever 10 is satisfied these considerations provide a large class of examples in which our approach can be carried out if 0 and d x is relatively dense it is also possible to obtain a lower bound for inf h via a cheeger type inequality specifically we define inf 6 s s s vol s 21 for the case of euclidean lattices this is carried out in 17 the general case can be inferred from 15 6 as we will explain below to apply this in a meaningful way we need an explicit estimate on the case x z d and d x relatively dense is treated in 17 and it is shown that c r d with a suitable constant c and r being the covering radius of d it turns out that a similar bound can be obtained in the general case as well in fact this can be shown rather directly based on the voronoi decomposition provided in proposition 3 8 proposition 6 2 let d x be relatively dense with covering radius r and set x d then 1 vol r proof from proposition 3 8 we obtain a voronoi decomposition vp p d with centers in d let s be an arbitrary non empty finite subset of consider now an arbitrary p d with vp s 6 then vp must contain u x s and a w s with b u w 1 to see this it suffices to consider a path in vp from a q s vp 6 to p d x s such a path exists by v 1 as such a path starts in s and finishes in the complement of s there must exist a first edge where it leaves s this edge gives the desired points u w so any vp that intersects s provides at least one boundary edge consequently with n s p d vp s 6 we have s n s at the same time we also clearly have vol s n s sup p d vol vp n s vol r where we use that any vp is contained in a ball of radius r putting the last two estimates together we find s vol s 1 vol r as s was an arbitrary non empty finite subset of x the desired estimate on follows based on this proposition and the cheeger inequality from 6 we obtain for d x with r covr d the lower bound 2 2 1 2 vol r 2 11 in fact in 6 the main point is to deal with a different isoperimetric con stant defined in terms of an intrinsic metric that allows for a cheeger inequality in the case of unbounded vertex degree in our simpler situation 22 we can choose as an intrinsic metric the following multiple of the combina torial metric namely 1 2 d and arrive at 11 above by applying lemma 3 5 from 6 note that this is the bound that can also be found in 15 where however laplacians are defined in a slightly different way clearly the lower bound 1 r vol r from theorem 3 12 is stronger whenever the volume vol r grows faster than linear 7 including a potential in this section we discuss how the ideas presented above allow one in certain cases to include a potential as well as usual we assume that we are given a connected graph x b m satis fying b and m we denote the set of functions f x c which vanish outside a finite set by cc x let now additionally be given a bounded function v x r then we define the form ev e v and denote the associated selfadjoint operator by lv and set v inf lv as v is bounded so are ev and lv in fact lv acts via lv f x 1 m x y x b x y f x f y v x f x by general principles sometimes discussed under the name of allegretto piepenbrinck theorem e g 22 there exists a a non negative ground state to lv i e a function x 0 satisfying the summability condition y x b x y y for every x x as well as 1 m x y x b x y x y v x x v x 0 23 for all x x 1 note that all sums in the previous inequality are absolutely convergent due to the summability condition satisfied by then a ground state transform as discussed e g in 22 gives ev f f v f f e f f 12 for all f cc x here e is the form associated to the graph x b m with b x y x y b x y for all x y x and m x x 2 m x for x x specifically e f g 1 2 x y x b x y f x f y g x g y for g cc x assume now that the ground state is regular i e there exists a c 1 called the bound on with 0 1 c x c for all x x see 18 for further discussion of regular ground states then the graph x b m satisfies the assumption b and m moreover the distance d associated to x b m is equivalent to the distance d associated to x b m in the sense that we have 1 c 2 d x y d x y c 2 d x y for all x y x similarly volumes are equivalent for any finite set s x in the sense that we have 1 c 2 m s m s c 2 vol s let now d x be relatively dense with respect to d with covering radius r set x d as d and d are equivalent then d is relatively dense with covering radius less than c 2 r with respect to d we can now apply theorem 3 12 to x b m taking into acount the equivalence of metrics and volumes we obtain from this theorem e g g 1 c 4 r vol c 2 r g 2 2 x m 13 1 if the graph is locally finite i e y x b x y 0 holds for all x x one can find with equality in the previous inequality 24 for all g cc we can then combine 12 and 13 to obtain ev f f v f f 1 c 4 r vol c 2 r f 2 2 x m 1 c 4 r vol c 2 r f 2 for all f cc so if we define ev as the restriction of ev to 2 m we can summarize the preceding considerations in the following theorem theorem 7 1 let x b m be as above and v x r bounded and ev the associated form let d x be relatively dense with covering radius r if there exists a regular ground state with bound c to ev then ev v 1 c 4 r vol c 2 r holds remark 7 2 if the metric d satisfies the volume doubling property that there exists an n 0 with vol s nvol s for all 1 and s 0 we can further estimate the bound in the previous theorem as ev v 1 c 4 2 n r vol r references 1 s agmon lower bounds for solutions of schr dinger
