when do spacetimes have constant mean curvature slices james dilts and michael holst abstract many results in mathematical relativity including results for both the initial data prob lem and for the evolution problem rely on the existence of a constant mean curvature cmc cauchy surface in the underlying spacetime however it is known that some spacetimes have no cmc cauchy surfaces slices this is an obstacle for many results and constructions with these types of spacetimes and is particularly worrisome since it is not known whether spacetimes that do have cmc slices are in any sense generic in this expository paper we will discuss the known results about the existence and non existence of cmc slices examine the evidence for cases which are unknown and make several conjectures concerning the existence of cmc slices and their generality contents 1 introduction 1 2 technical background 2 3 which spacetimes have cmc slices 3 4 are cmc slices generic 7 5 final comments 10 references 10 1 introduction as is well known the problem of finding solutions to the einstein equations of general relativity can be split into finding initial data satisfying the constraint equations and then evolving that data using the evolution equations both portions have their own interesting problems what kinds of initial data are or are not possible is there a way to parameterize all initial data is the evolution problem stable what happens near singularities and what kinds of singularities can occur much progress has been made in recent decades on these kinds of problems but looking at many of these papers a common theme appears constant mean curvature cmc initial data makes everything easier in finding initial data in general relativity the commonly used conformal method involves solv ing a system of coupled equations the conformal constraint equations in which the mean curva ture function is one of the freely specified parameters if the chosen mean curvature is constant then the equations decouple making finding solutions much easier because of this the cmc case of the initial data question is mostly understood for instance a parameterization of all closed cmc initial data has been found see 11 however the conformal method in the non cmc case is a completely different story and is one of the main motivations for this study we will come back to this shortly in the evolution problem in general relativity there is some coordinate freedom you may pick a lapse and shift arbitrarily obviously some choices are better adapted to proving estimates than others if you start with cmc initial data there is a choice of lapse and shift that allow your time date november 13 2018 2010 mathematics subject classification 00000 00000 key words and phrases general relativity

curvature of each time slice this choice ends up being useful in proving various key estimates for example it is used in the recent resolution of the bounded l 2 curvature conjecture by klainerman rodnianski and szeftel 12 which states essentially that the evolution of the spacetime can continue as long as the l 2 norm of the curvature remains bounded in both of these examples of results for the einstein constraint and evolution equations the authors make the assumption that the spacetimes they are considering have a cmc slice cauchy data unfortunately not all spacetimes have cmc slices this was first observed by bartnik in 4 and vacuum examples were later found by chrus ciel isenberg and pollack in 7 this has serious implications for many of the results that have been obtained for both the einstein constraint and evolution equations for those investigating initial data through study of the einstein constraint equations one major goal is the parameterization of all initial data the conformal method works well as this parame terization for cmc initial data but unfortunately it fails for non cmc data the solution space of the conformal constraint equations for far from cmc data exhibit folds and blowup in unex pected places this has been shown analytically in some cases 14 15 and numerically in others 8 the behavior of the conformal constraint equations in the far from cmc regime is very com plicated however if every spacetime had a cmc cauchy surface slice while the conformal method would not parameterize all initial data it would at least parameterize initial data for every spacetime unfortunately not all spacetimes have cmc slices but a similar statement could be made as long as spacetimes with cmc slices are generic many of the most important conjectures in mathematical relativity ask whether generic space times have or don t have certain properties or features such as cauchy horizons however in many papers about the evolution problem assuming the existence of a cmc slice is a key first step in the analysis while this may be more a limitation of methods rather than an actual obstruction it is still worrying these results such as the l 2 curvature theorem cannot be used to prove any thing about generic spacetimes unless it is known that a generic spacetime has a cmc slice that is currently unknown additionally is it possible that the spacetimes without cmc slices are an obstruction that makes proving these results more difficult the main concern is that it is unknown how general spacetimes without cmc slices are while there are a few examples they are very special examples with high levels of symmetry is there an open set of such spacetimes are they ubiquitous or very special in this expository paper we will discuss known results about the existence and non existence of constant mean curvature slices in spacetimes possible directions for investigation and make a few conjectures 2 technical background a lorentzian manifold v is a cosmological spacetime if it is globally hyperbolic with compact cauchy surfaces and satisfies the timelike convergence condition 1 r t t 0 for every timelike vector t if the spacetime also obeys the einstein equations this is equivalent to the strong energy condi tion many results included will not require that v satisfies the einstein equations though we are predominately interested in their solutions by slice we will always mean a compact cauchy surface 2 intuitively the mean curvature gives the expansion and contraction rate of the universe we will use the sign convention that trk h 0 means the universe is contracting to the future it is well known 10 that if h 0 on a slice then all future timelike geodesics must be incomplete in the globally hyperbolic development with a uniform upper bound on their proper length of 3 h there are a number of well known useful facts about cmc slices in cosmological spacetimes when they exist see 4 13 for instance if a cmc slice exists in v with h 6 0 it is necessarily unique for maximal slices with h 0 we can only say that the spacetime is static with a timelike killing field t with r t t 0 when a spacetime has a cmc slice there is a foliation at least locally by cmc slices the mean curvatures vary along the foliation monotonically except sometimes when h 0 in the maximal case nearby slices may also be maximal but if they are the spacetime is static a major question see for instance 16 is whether this foliation covers the spacetime and whether they necessarily achieve all possible mean curvatures 1 for any two slices with mean curvatures h 1 and h 2 and one in the future of the other then for any mean curvature h satisfying suph 1 h inf h 2 then there is a slice with mean curvature h in the spacetime between the other slices one common use for this result is that if v has cmc slices of mean curvature h 1 h 2 then the region between the slices is foliated by cmc slices with mean curvatures monotonically increasing along the foliation from h 1 to h 2 it will also be useful to define a spacetime ray and line definition 2 1 a future resp past ray is a future resp past timelike path with infinite affine length definition 2 2 a line is a a timelike geodesic with infinite affine length to the future and past which is also globally maximizing in distance the earlier mentioned result that if there is a slice with h 0 then timelike geodesics have an upper bound on length to the future shows that the existence of a cmc implies the nonexistence of rays either to the past or future depending on the sign on the other hand the importance of lines is shown by the following theorem from 4 theorem 2 3 a globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying the timelike convergence criterion 1 and admitting a line is a metric product thus it has maximal slices 3 which spacetimes have cmc slices the most basic question to ask is under what conditions does a spacetime have or not have cmc slices since cmc slices are unique it is easy to cut enough out of a spacetime to create a spacetime without a cmc slice we are not concerned with such examples in order to avoid that we will consider only maximal globally hyperbolic developments mghds unfortunately since work on barrier methods in the 80 s by bartnik and others there are rela tively few papers that deal with the existence of a cmc slice most papers assume three is one then investigate the foliation by cmc slices various barrier methods are well developed the 1 if the topology of the slices do not allow a metric with positive scalar curvature the spacetime cannot have a maximal slice thus all allowable mean curvatures would be 0 or 0 3 barriers are essentially used to guarantee that the slices avoid the singularities at future or past infinity one type of barrier was used in 4 in that paper he showed that if v i p is compact for some point p v then there is a cmc slice passing through p the barrier in the proof is i p which is also compact he uses this boundary to show that there are cmc slices through p though singular at p with any desired mean curvature he then shows that one of these slices must in fact be smooth the condition that v i p is compact is an interesting condition it roughly states that an observer at p could observe all events that happened in the universe sufficiently far in the past there is no hidden portion of the universe a similar statement can be said about the future however it is not a necessary condition spherical frlw spacetimes don t satisfy it light rays emitted from the big bang don t travel across the universe before recollapse and so there can be no such p but they still have cmc slices a more common kind of barrier is a slice with a certain mean curvature as discussed in section 2 if we can find two slices one in the future of the other and with mean curvatures suph 1 inf h 2 then there is a cmc slice between them this immediately shows that a spacetime with a crushing singularity has cmc slices a future crushing singularity means that there is a sequence of slices i approaching the future edge of the mghd with mean curvatures hi satisfying sup i hi if you have a crushing singularity pick any slice as one barrier then use the crushing singularity to find a slice with sup h inf h a cmc slice is then between them it is then useful to find other conditions which guarantee that your future singularity is crushing one such condition is the strong curvature singularity definition 3 1 a timelike geodesic t terminates in a strong curvature singularity at affine pa rameter value t 0 if the following holds let t be the three from on the normal space to t de termined by any three linearly independent vorticity free jacobi fields along t if t vanishes for at most finitely many t is some neighborhood t 1 t 0 of t 0 then we require limt t 0 t 0 for cosmological spacetimes if t vanishes finitely many times the limit exists the basic equation is 2 d 2 dt 2 t 1 3 1 3 rabv avb 2 2 1 3 0 and importantly note that the second term is positive which makes behave well using this equation it can be shown that any global strong curvature singularity is also a crushing singularity theorem 3 2 13 thm 6 for a cosmological spacetime if there exists a cauchy surface from which all orthogonal future or past timelike geodesics end in a strong curvature singularity then that singularity is crushing and so there is a cmc slice another theorem in that same paper gives another condition guaranteeing that a singularity is crushing it has to do with the c boundary the future c boundary is essentially constructed by associating each point p of the spacetime with its past i p the future boundary is then defined as the sets i where is an inextendible future directed timelike path the technical details for these indecomposable pasts can be complicated but we won t need them in this paper theorem 3 3 13 thm 6 suppose a cosmological spacetime with global future singularity has c boundary consisting of a single point i e that all inextendible future timelike paths have the 4 same past and thus that past is all of the spacetime then the singularity is crushing and so a cmc slice exists those are the most general results that we are aware of for proving that a cmc slice exists let s now turn our attention to the known examples of spacetimes without cmc slices unfor tunately only a few examples are known though this paper is predominantly focused on spatially compact spacetimes we should briefly mention results for spatially asymptotically euclidean manifolds in these spacetimes an cmc asymptotically euclidean cauchy surface can only have h 0 i e be maximal if the spacetime obeys the weak energy condition then the cauchy surface must have a metric of positive scalar however just as in the compact case there are topological obstructions to this an explicit example was found by brill in 5 but it is now known 9 that any asymptotically euclidean manifold if it can be one point compactified one point for each end to a manifold not allowing a metric of positive scalar curvature itself cannot have an asymptotically euclidean metric of positive scalar curvature this gives well understood topological restrictions to the existence of maximal cauchy surfaces in spatially asymptotically euclidean spacetimes for spatially compact spacetimes the original explicit example comes from bartnik s paper 4 to construct his example take the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime then on each of the ends cut off each end and attach a torus with a homogeneous dust in it bartnik uses a particular model tolman bondi that allows gluing between these regions in such a way that the spacetime evolves nicely and satisfies the strong energy condition bartnik proves that this spacetime has no cmc slices in two ways the first way is by symmetry the spacetime has a time inversion symmetry in particular if there is a non maximal cmc slice then by this symmetry there is one with the same mean curvature but opposite sign in between these slices you can foliate the spacetime with cmc slices and thus find a maximal slice but the spacetime satisfies the weak energy condition and so the maximal slice has non negative scalar curvature by the constraint equations this contradicts the topology of the slices t 3 t 3 this proof method is simple and shows that the topology of the slices may be important in proving more general results however symmetry is obviously not a generic property and so this proof seems limited to very symmetric data a serious limitation however it also allowed the development of a family of examples in 7 in this paper they take t 3 vacuum solutions then glue them using imp gluing symmetrically the important addition is that these examples are vacuum and so the dust from bartnik s example was not necessary 2 however it is still hard to generalize these examples due to the symmetry requirement bartnik s second proof uses timelike path incompleteness theorem 3 4 4 if a globally hyperbolic cosmological spacetime v has a future ray and a past ray but no line then v has no cmc cauchy surfaces proof suppose v did have a cmc slice with h 6 0 then by 10 pg 274 all future or past timelike paths have finite length depending on the sign of h this is a contradiction 2 it is known that dust can cause shell crossing singularities though there are none in bartnik s example and so dust is sometimes avoided 5 if h 0 the spacetime is locally foliated either by cmc slices with nonzero h in which case the first paragraph applies or it is foliated by maximal slices if this maximal foliation covers the spacetime the spacetime is static and thus contains a line this is a contradiction the explicit example constructed by bartnik has rays complete timelike paths to the past or future because the schwarzschild spacetime does however it clearly has no line and in fact no complete timelike geodesics at all and so cannot have a cmc slice as this second proof doesn t use symmetry this approach seems a more likely candidate for generalization indeed our main conjecture is that this condition is both necessary and sufficient conjecture 3 5 a globally hyperbolic cosmological spacetime has no cmc cauchy surfaces if and only if it contains a future and a past ray but no line to see why this conjecture is reasonable recall theorem 2 3 which says that if a spacetime has a line then your spacetime is a metric product and thus have maximal slices the difficult part of the conjecture is then to show the following conjecture 3 6 if in a cosmological spacetime every future or past timelike path is incomplete i e of finite length then there exists a cmc slice in this formulation the conjecture essentially says that if you have a global singularity then you have a cmc slice for certain kinds of singularities such as the crushing and strong curvature singularities we discussed earlier we know this conjecture holds unfortunately not all singularities are necessarily of the crushing type for instance in 16 pg 3594 rendall constructs an example where a dust shell crossing singularity causes a cmc foliation to stop at a finite mean curvature and so the singularity is not crushing of course this example uses dust which is known to cause problems and still has cmc slices we are aware of no other cosmological mghds ending in a global singularity which do not have a crushing singularity both of bartnik s proofs in fact prove something stronger than that the spacetime has no cmc slices they also show that the spacetimes have no slices of constant signed mean curvature this observation leads to a conjecture conjecture 3 7 a cosmological spacetime has a cmc slice if and only if it has a slice of constant signed mean curvature since a slice of constant non zero signed mean curvature implies that there can be no rays the main conjecture 3 6 would imply this conjecture however it provides an interesting intuitive picture for spacetimes without cmc slices if this conjecture is true then every slice must have a region with positive mean curvature and a region with negative mean curvature because of this there appears to be one region of the spacetime that expands for all time and another that expands to the past for all time this also lines up with the existence of rays as in the main conjecture 3 6 if these regions were causally linked you might expect to find a line going from the one region to the other which would lead to a contradiction thus the spacetime has at least two regions separated by some sort of wormhole as in bartnik s example with on region expanding the other contracting the one implication of the conjecture 3 7 is obvious he other makes sense heuristically if v has a slice of constant signed non maximal mean curvature there is a global singularity to the future or past by the previous conjecture there must be a cmc slice 6 more directly suppose that v has a slice of constant signed non maximal mean curvature it is possible to evolve the slice by mean curvature flow on a lorentzian manifold the mean curvature flow tends to expand slices and so the slice will evolve into the expanding universe direction i e towards h 0 as the universe is expanding you would not expect singularities to appear before you reach the point where the new mean curvature is globally closer to zero than the original mean curvature 3 using the standard interpolation result there is a slice of constant mean curvature between them the most useful condition for showing the existence or nonexistence of a cmc slice would refer only to the initial data for instance if a set of vacuum initial data is of yamabe class y the closed universe recollapse conjecture 3 says that the spacetime will begin and end in a global singularity if this conjecture is true and the main conjecture 3 6 is true then every yamabe positive vacuum initial data set leads to a spacetime with cmc slices another idea is to try to find conditions on a region of initial data such that that region when evolved will contain rays for instance like in bartnik s example if there is a region of the initial data with positive mean curvature and is is separated from other regions by a black hole type region then it seems reasonable that this region should expand for all time and thus have rays then if an initial data set had one region expanding to the future in this way and one to the past then by theorem 3 4 the spacetime cannot have any cmc slices this condition would be especially interesting if it were stable under perturbations which it seems like it should be the difficulty in any attempt to find conditions on initial data is that proving that there are or are not cmc slices in the spacetime requires asking questions about the long time behavior of the spacetime results of this nature tend to be difficult to prove and many of the best results require the existence of a cmc slice this difficulty is the reason that the only known condition on initial data is the very restrictive time antisymmetric condition used earlier 4 are cmc slices generic the most important question about cmc slices is their genericity if the existence of cmc slices is generic then the special examples where they do not exist can mostly be ignored and cmc slicing can be used for proving generic properties unfortunately to our knowledge there no evidence that this is the case other than the weak evidence that all known examples are all very special all on t 3 t 3 with time antisymmetry in any question of genericity it is vital to choose a useful and meaningful topology in questions about spacetimes there are several choices that could be made the simplest choice would be a global c 2 topology using this topology choquet bruhat 6 showed that spacetimes with cmc slices form an open set in particular she proves that perturbations in a neighborhood of the evolution of a cmc slice always has another cmc slice this is done using the linearization of the mean curvature operator however in this topology the existence of cmc slices is not generic due to theorem 3 4 if there are timelike rays but no timelike line then the spacetime does not have a cmc slice 3 indeed this can almost be carried out using basic estimates it is not hard to show that as long as all timelike geodesics exist for a certain explicit amount of proper time into the expanding direction based only on the starting mean curvature then you can evolve the slice long enough to get the desired slice with small mean curvature unfor tunately in trying to show that you can always evolve long enough to find such a slice you need an estimate of certain quantities the type of estimate that would seem to work is exactly the kind of estimate that cmc slices are used for in evolution problem papers a relationship between the second fundamental form and the lapse thus the problem becomes somewhat circular 7 however the unboundedness of rays is stable under a global c 2 perturbation also if there were a line theorem 2 3 says the spacetime would be static however bartnik s example is not c 2 close to a static spacetime and so a small enough c 2 perturbation could not create a line together this means that every small global c 2 perturbation of bartnik s example would still have no cmc slices we would be among the first to admit though that the global c 2 topology along with any other global topology is probably not the right one for this problem for instance since we are dealing only with mghds spacetimes end in singularities or exist for all time in either case something is unbounded thus c 2 close is extremely restrictive a related problem is that there are one parameter families of initial data which are not close to each other in the c 2 norm for example initial data for the flat toroidal static universe can be perturbed into initial data which evolve into spacetimes with either global future or global past singularities it seems that a topology based on initial data is more reasonable for this problem we propose to use the c 2 topology on initial data sets m g k using this topology the existence of cmc slices is still an open condition consider initial data evolving into a spacetime with at least one cmc slice that cmc slice is within some amount of coordinate time t 0 from the initial slice for any initial data sufficiently close to the original data the spacetimes are c 2 close within t 0 of the initial data again using choquet bruhat s argument in 6 the nearby spacetime also has a cmc slice of the same mean curvature unfortunately as with the global c 2 topology it appears that the existence of cmc slices is not a generic condition conjecture 4 1 there is an open set of initial data in the c 2 norm such that the associated spacetimes do not have cmc slices consider bartnik s example that we discussed earlier to remind the reader his spacetime is two toroidal universes one expanding to the future the other to the past separated by a schwarzschild bridge if the existence of cmc slices was a dense condition a generic perturbation of initial data for bartnik s example should evolve into a spacetime with cmc slices this perturbed data could not lead to a static spacetime and so it has a non maximal cmc slice thus all future or past geodesics are incomplete in other words a generic perturbation causes at least one of the expanding toroidal universes to collapse but a small perturbation shouldn t cause global collapse to make this a bit more precise we make the following conjecture conjecture 4 2 if a compact vacuum initial data set evolves into a non static spacetime such that there is a family of future rays intersecting the initial cauchy surface in an open set then any small c 2 perturbation of the initial data evolves into a spacetime with at least one future ray this is not the same as stability of the spacetime for instance the perturbation could coalesce into a black hole type region but as long as it didn t cause the global collapse of the expanding region the conjecture would still hold if this conjecture were true for initial data with dust bartnik s example would immediately im ply that the existence of cmc slices is not generic similarly the examples of chrus ciel isenberg and pollack if they contain a ray would also imply that the existence of cmc slices is not generic another heuristic example can be found by gluing together two stable 2 tori in two papers 1 2 andersson and moncrief give vacuum hyperbolic flrw models with the metric d 2 2 where is the hyperbolic metric on the 2 torus slice importantly they prove these spacetimes 8 are stable attractors of nearby initial data at least in the expanding direction if we take two of the same constant slices but change the sign of the second fundamental form k on the second one we can do the same gluing they used in 7 in order to glue these together anti symmetrically in k and symmetrically in the metric then as with their examples the evolution can have no cmc slices due to the symmetry and bad topology of course these examples are really just a special case of the examples in 7 the advantage these have is that the base hyperbolic space we are using is known to be stable that means after the gluing in the domain of dependence in the expanding direction away from the gluing region the spacetime is close to and in fact converging toward the original flrw if this domain existed for all time under any perturbation the new spacetime would have infinite length timelike paths and thus no cmc slices that would show that the set of initial data that evolve to have cmc slices is not dense unfortunately it is unclear whether this domain of dependence lasts for all time in the original flrw spacetime it is straightforward to check that the expansion rate of the universe is just barely too slow to guarantee that if the 2 were replaced by 2 ln 3 for instance it would work however perturbations of this glued spacetime likely still have no cmc slices heuristically the wormhole bridge connecting the two glued tori should act like the schwarzschild bridge in bartnik s example since it is a black hole like region we would expect it to stay small only lightly affecting the spacetime outside its immediate neighborhood if this were true the spacetime would not recollapse in the expanding direction and so all perturbations would lead to spacetimes without cmc slices it is of course possible that spacetimes with cmc slices are generic if that were true for any initial data set s leading to a spacetime without cmc slices there are sets of initial data si leading to spacetimes with cmc slices converging to the initial data in thec 2 topology since the corresponding spacetimes vi will then converge on any compact interval of time of the spacetime v evolved from s if the cmc slices of the vi were well behaved then the boundary spacetime v would also contain a cmc slice thus the cmc slices of the vi cannot be well behaved there are three ways the convergence of cmc slices could fail the first is that for each h the cmc slice in vi of mean curvature h could run off to infinity so that in the limit no compact interval of time could contain the slices the second is that these slices may become null in the limit for the third it is possible that for any h for i large enough vi does not have a cmc slice of mean curvature h in other words the foliation by cmc slices in vi covers a vanishing interval of the possible mean curvatures in any of these cases the boundary spacetime v should have slices of arbitrarily near constant mean curvature if the converging slices are non maximal the slices in v should be near cmc in the traditional sense of h being small compared to h if the converging slices are maximal or approach maximal as they would be in conjecture 3 7 were true the slices in v would be near cmc but perhaps only in the sense that the average of h could be made arbitrarily small thus heuristically the existence of cmc slices is a generic property if and only if every space time has near cmc slices thus one way to check whether we should expect this property to be generic is to check whether the known examples have arbitrarily near cmc slices if they do not we would expect that the existence of cmc slices is not generic if they do we cannot however conclude the opposite let us mention that this heuristic argument has consequences for the initial data problem the conformal method as mentioned in the introduction parameterizes all cmc initial data while 9 it fails for far from cmc data it still behaves well for near cmc data including existence and uniqueness if it were true that all spacetimes have near cmc slices the conformal method may still be able to provide a reasonable parameterization of initial data for all spacetimes while genericity is the main question it is not even known whether spacetimes with cmc slices and those without are even in the same connected component to prove that they aren t one could try to show that the no cmc slice condition is open or that the cmc slice condition is closed both of those methods if our main conjecture 3 6 is true are questions about long term stability of the spacetime if a spacetime has a ray do all nearby spacetimes also have a ray at first glance it may seem like a spacetime with a single future ray could be perturbed to a spacetime without a ray however do such spacetimes even exist by conjecture 3 7 which says that spacetimes without cmc slices will have no slices of constant sign we expect that a spacetime without cmc slices will be expanding in some region an expanding region should have an open set of rays additionally an expanding region should be stable the boundary example of the static universe is unstable and cannot occur since there is a region that is expanding to the past as well any sufficiently small perturbation of the expanding region as we ve argued before should not cause the expanding region to collapse this would suggest that having no cmc slices is also an open condition and thus forms a disconnected component of initial data one could also try to show connectedness direction the most obvious way is to take the initial data for an example with no cmc slices and treat it as seed data for the conformal constraint equations then one can make a path of seed data from that given data to one with constant mean curvature the difficulty is that one must solve the conformal constraint equations for each set of seed data in order to find initial data for a spacetime unfortunately it is now well established see 8 that for far from cmc seed data which we of necessity would have to work with the conformal constraint equations are very complicated and it is unclear that they have solutions for that seed data 5 final comments constant mean curvature cauchy surfaces are useful and much easier to work with than their non cmc counterparts this is true both for initial data and for the evolution of the data unfortu nately while much is known about foliations by cmc slices given a starting cmc slice less has been written about whether or not spacetimes have cmc slices at all importantly many results assume that the spacetime has a cmc slice unfortunately it is cur rently unknown whether or not that assumption is true for a generic spacetime our conjecture is that it is not a generic condition since many of the most important conjectures in mathematical relativity concern generic spacetimes this means that results that assume the existence of a cmc slice are not applicable to those problems unless the assumption of the existence of a cmc slice can somehow be removed references 1 l andersson and v moncrief future complete vacuum spacetimes
