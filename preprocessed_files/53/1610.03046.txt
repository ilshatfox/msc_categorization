the classification of kleinian groups of hausdorff dimensions at most one yong hou institute for advanced study princeton university abstract in this paper we provide the complete classification of kleinian group of hausdorff dimensions less than 1 in particular we prove that every purely loxodromic kleinian groups of hausdorff dimension 1 is a classical schottky group this upper bound is sharp as an application the result of 4 then implies that every closed riemann surface is uniformizable by a classical schottky group the proof relies on the result of hou 6 and space of rectifiable invariant closed curves 1 introduction and main theorem we take kleinian groups to be finitely generated torsion free discrete sub groups of psl 2 c the main theorem is theorem 1 1 classification any purely loxodromic kleinian group with limit set of hausdorff dimension 1 is a classical schottky group this bound is sharp supported by ambrose monell fundation 1 ar x iv 1 61 0 03 04 6 v 4 m at h g t 1 6 d ec 2 01 7 we note that by selberg lemma torsion free is not really a restriction since any finitely generated discrete subgroup of psl 2 c has a finite index torsion free subgroup as an application we have the following corollary 1 3 which is a resolu tion of a folklore problem of bers on classical schottky group uniformization of closed riemann surface corollary 1 3 follows from the work of hou 4 theorem 1 2 hou 4 every closed riemann surface is uniformizable by a schottky group of hausdorff dimension 1 i e every point in moduli space has a hausdorff dimension 1 fiber in the schottky space corollary 1 3 uniformization every closed riemann surface can be uni formized by a classical schottky group 1 1 strategy of proof first let us recall the result of hou 6 theorem 1 4 hou there exists 0 such that any kleinian group with limit set of hausdorff dimension is a classical schottky group define hc sup satisfies theorem 1 4 hc is the maximal parameter such that if is a schottky group of hausdorff dimension hc then is classical schottky group hence theorem 1 1 can be rephrased as hc 1 we prove by contradiction so from now on and throughout the paper we assume that hc 1 then we will show that hc is not maximal recall that the hausdorff dimension function on the schottky space of rank g is real analytic it is a consequence of theorem 1 4 that jhcg rank g schottky groups of hausdorff dimension hc see section 2 is a 3 g 3 dimensional open and connected submanifold of jg the rank g schottky space the proof is done as follows first we note that jhcg must contain a non classical schottky group otherwise hc is not maximal by definition see proposition 2 12 second we show that if hc 1 then every element of the boundary jhcg is either a classical schottky group or it is not a schottky group lemma 3 11 this contradicts the first fact hence we must have hc 1 the bulk of the paper is devoted to proof the second fact which we now summarize the idea in the following it is a result of bowen 2 that a schottky group has hausdorff dimen sion 1 if and only if there exist a rectifiable invariant closed curve let 2 r s 1 w be the space of bounded length closed curves which intersects the compact set w c and equipped with fre chet metric it is complete space see section 2 we show that if hc 1 then every quasi circle with bounded length of is the limit of a sequence of quasi circles of n in r s 1 w we also show that if is a schottky group then every quasi circle of has an open neighborhood in the relative topology of see section 3 such that every element of the open neighborhood is a quasi circle of we also define linearity and transversality invariant for quasi circles and show that quasi circles of classical schottky groups preserve these invariants and non classical schottky groups do not have transverse linear quasi circles given a quasi circle of a schottky group we show that there exists an open neighborhood in the relative topology of space of rectifiable curves with respect to frechet metric about the quasi circle such that every point in the open neighborhood is a quasi circle of see lemma 3 9 next as sume that we have a sequence of classical schottky groups n to a schottky group and are all of hasudorff dimensions less than one we then study singularity formations of classical fundamental domains of n when n these singularities are of three types tangent degenerate and collapsing we show that all these singularities will imply that there exists a quasi circle such that every open neighborhood about this quasi circle will contain some points which is not a quasi circle essentially the existence of a singularity will be obstruction to the existence of any open neighborhood that are of quasi circles see lemma 3 11 hence it follows from these results that if n with n classical and all hausdorff di mensions are of less than one then must be a classical schottky group acknowledgement this work is made possible by

the previous draft this paper is dedicated to my father shuying hou 3 2 quasi circles and generating jordan curves schottky group of rank g is defined as convex cocompact discrete faithful representation of the free group fg in psl 2 c it follows that is freely generated by purely loxodromic elements i g 1 this implies we can find collection of open topological disks di di g 1 i g of disjoint closure d i d i g in the riemann sphere h 3 c with boundary curves d i ci d i g ci g by definition ci ci g are closed jordan curves in riemann sphere h 3 such that i ci ci g and i di di g whenever there exists a set 1 g of generators with all ci ci g g 1 as circles then it is called a classical schottky group with 1 g classical generators schottky space jg is defined as space of all rank g schottky groups up to conjugacy by psl 2 c by normalization we can chart jg by 3 g 3 complex parameters hence jg is 3 g 3 dimensional complex manifold the bihomolomorphic auto jg group is out fg which is isomorphic to quotient of the handle body group denote by jg o the set of all elements of jg that are classical schottky groups note that jg o is open in jg on the other hand it is nontrivial result due to marden that jg o is non dense subset of jg however it follows from theorem 1 4 j g jg o is 3 g 3 dimensional open connected submanifold here j g denotes space of schottky groups of hausdorff dimension some notations given a kleinian group we denote by and and d its limit set region of discontinuity and hausdorff dimension respectively through out this paper given a fundamental domain f of we denote the orbit of f under actions of by f we also say f is a classical fundamental domain of classical schottky group if f are disjoint circles definition 2 1 quasi circles given a geometrically finite kleinian group a closed invariant jordan curve that contains the limit set is called quasi circle of remark from now on we make the global assumption throughout this paper that hc 1 and all schottky groups are of hausdorff dimension d hc if not stated otherwise next we give a construction of quasi circles of which is a generalization of the construction by bowen 2 4 let f be a fundamental domain of and ci 2 g 1 be the collection of 2 g disjoint jordan curves comprising f let denote collection of arcs i connecting points pi ci p i ci g for 1 i g and arcs on ci g that connects pi g to i pi and p i g ci g to i p i so is a set of g disjoint curves connecting disjoint points on collection of jordan curves of f figure 1 figure 1 quasi circle defines a invariant closed curve containing defines a quasi circle of obviously there are infinitely many quasi circles and different gives a different quasi circles note that the simply connected regions c gives the bers simultaneous uniformization of riemann surface definition 2 2 generating curve given a quasi circle of we say a collection of disjoint curves is a generating curve of if can be generated by note that the quasi circles constructed in 2 which requires that pi g is a imagine of pi under element of i is a subset of the collection that we have defined here in fact this generalization is also used for the construction of quasi circles of non classical schottky groups proposition 2 3 every quasi circle of is generated by some generating curves proof let be a quasi circle of let f be a fundamental domain of set f and f then consists of collection of disjoint 5 curves which only intersects along f hence we have for with 6 since we have have hence is a generating curve of definition 2 4 linear quasi circle we call a quasi circle linear if consists of points circular arcs or lines note that if is linear then there exists f such that f and f are piece wise circular arcs or lines we say an arc f is orthogonal if the tangents at intersections on f are orthogonal with f and an arc f is parallel if f definition 2 5 right angled quasi circle given a linear quasi circle of if all linear arcs intersect at right angle then we say is right angled quasi circle definition 2 6 transverse quasi circle given a quasi circle of we say is transverse quasi circle if intersects f orthogonally for some f and have no parallel arc otherwise we say is non transverse definition 2 7 parallel quasi circle given a quasi circle of we say is parallel quasi circle if there exists some arc of such that f proposition 2 8 transverse quasi circles always exists for a given schottky group proof let f be bounded by 2 g distinct jordan closed curves and take any curve connecting pi ci pi g ci g such that pi g i pi and pi g ci g i pi g for 1 i g that intersects ci ci g orthogonally it should be noted that a quasi circle of in general is not necessarily rectifiable for instance if we take to be some non rectifiable generating curves then will be non rectifiable recall a curve is said to be rectifiable if and only if the 1 dimensional hausdorff measure of the curve is finite this is not the only obstruction to rectifiability in fact we have the following result of bowen theorem 2 9 2 for a given schottky group the hausdorff dimension of limit set is d 1 if and only if there exists a rectifiable quasi circle for 6 the proof of theorem 2 9 relies on the fact that the poincare series of converges if and only if d 1 2 proposition 2 10 let be a schottky group of d 1 suppose a given generating curve is a rectifiable curve then is a rectifiable quasi circle of proof let 1 be the 1 dimensional hausdorff measure since d 1 we have 1 0 let k k 1 let k denotes the derivative of k then we have 1 k 1 1 k 1 k 1 k z z also since d 1 if and only if poincare series satisfies k 1 k this implies that is rectifiable if and only if rectifiable let w c be a compact set denote the space of closed curves with bounded length in c that intersect with w by r s 1 w h s 1 c h s 1 w 6 h continuous rectifiable map for h 1 h 2 r s 1 w let h 1 h 2 be it s respective arclength the fre chet distance is defined as df h 1 h 2 inf sup h 1 1 h 2 2 1 2 homeo s 1 h 1 h 2 for a given compact w c the space of closed curves with bounded length r s 1 w is a metric space with respect to df two curves in r s 1 w are same if there exists parametrization such that and the topology on r s 1 w is defined with respect to the metric df see 1 p 388 let be a generating curve for fix a indexing of set i i 1 j let i be a parametrization of i such that i i define a parametrization of then df 1 2 m inf 1 2 1 k 2 k for some m k this implies continuity of with respect to generating curve proposition 2 11 for a given compact w c the space r s 1 w is complete metric space with respect to df 7 proof let i r s 1 w be a cauchy sequence i are rectifiable curves of bounded length and so there exists i lipschitz parameterizations with bounded lipschitz constants such that i i t are uniformly lipschitz then completeness follows from the fact that all curves of r s 1 w are contained within some large compact subset of c proposition 2 12 there exists a jhcg in the closure of jhcg such that is not a classical schottky group proof suppose false then every element jhcg with hausdorff dimension hc is a classical schottky group since the classical schottky space jg o is open in the schottky space jg we have a open neighborhood u of jhcg in jg such that u jhcg o by definition of hc it is maximal hence there are non classical schottky groups of hausdorff dimension arbitrarily close to hc and hc then there exists a sequence of non classical schottky groups n of hausdorff dimensions d n hc let limn n since by assumption all schottky groups of hausdorff dimension hc is classical we must have either it is not a schottky group or it is a classical schottky group this implies that for large n we must have n u which is a contradiction to the sequence n been all non classical schottky groups hence hc is not maximal proposition 2 13 there exists a non classical schottky group of d hc and sequence of n classical schottky groups such that d n d with supd n d proof it follows from that the hausdorff dimension map d jg 0 2 is real analytic map and by proposition 2 12 there exists a non classical with d hc theorem 1 4 implies j hc g is open submanifold of jg o hence there exists a sequence of classical schottkys n jhcg with d n d 3 schottky space and rectifiable curves take n and as given by proposition 2 13 in particular n is a se quence of classical schottky groups such that n denote qc c space of quasiconformal maps on c it follows from quasiconformal deformation theory of schottky space for c classical schottky group of hausdorff dimen sion hc we can write jg f f 1 psl 2 c f qc c c psl 2 c 8 remark from now on throughout rest of the paper we fix c to be a classical schottky group with hausdorff dimension d c hc notations set h to be the collection of all schottky groups of hausdorff dimension hc note that there exists a sequence of quasiconformal maps fn and f of c such that we can write n fn and f c here we write f f g f 1 g for a given kleinian group and quasiconformal map f schottky space jg can also be considered as subspace of c 3 g 3 this pro vides jg analytic structure as 3 g 3 dimensional complex analytic manifold proposition 3 1 let n be a sequence of schottky groups with n to a schottky group let f be a fundamental domain of there exists a sequence of fundamental domain fn of n such that fn f proof let 2 gi 1 ci f be the jordan curves which is the boundary of f set cn f 1 n 2 g i 1 ci then cn is the boundary of a fundamental domain of f 1 n hence we have a fundamental domain fn of n defined by cn with fn f lemma 3 2 suppose fn f and f c every quasi circle with bounded length of n fn c is in r s 1 w for some compact w proof let n be a quasi circle of n note n n since limit set n and limit set is compact and n is rectifiable we can find some compact set w n n given n h with n let e n denote the collection of all bounded length quasi circles of n we define e n df to be the closure of the set of bounded length quasi circles of n in r s 1 w proposition 3 3 the subspace is compact proof curves in are bounded length and we have parametrization with bounded lipschitz constants it follows from ascoli arzela theorem we have uniform convergence topology on since curves in r s 1 w are all con tained in some large compact set of c we have is closed and bounded hence compact 9 we define o open sets about in relative topology given by o for some open set o r s 1 w let be a schottky group let f be a fundamental domain of for o of and suppose every element is quasi circle and let denote a generating curve of o with respect to f then we have o o the collection of all generating curves of the open set o gives a open set of generating curves of on set of collection of all generating curves of elements of we define the topology as n if and only if n for n we will sometime denote by a curve which is the limit of rectifiable quasi circles of n proposition 3 4 let n h with n then every bounded length quasi circle of is in in addition if n are linear then is linear quasi circles of proof let n f 1 n note that since d n hc we have d hc 1 define n f 1 n for all n then n is a sequence of jordan closed curves it follows from proposition 2 3 we have a generating curve of so and we have n f 1 n f 1 n since n f 1 n and f 1 n f 1 n fn f 1 n so its n n n n where n f 1 n hence n is a generating curve of n which are quasi circles of n denote by a generating curve for since is rectifiable curve modify n if necessary we can assume n are rectifiable curves let z n since d n hc we have the 1 dimension hausdorff measure 1 n 1 n 1 n n z where is the derivative of hence n are rectifiable quasi circles it follows that there exists c 0 such that 1 n c 1 for large n hence n are bounded quasi circles of r s 1 w and by proposition 3 3 we have n and finally if n are linear then n are linear and since mobius maps preserves linearity we have is linear definition 3 5 good sequences for a given sequence n of quasi circles of n h with n we say n is a good sequence of quasi circles if it is convergent sequence and is a quasi circle of we also call n non transverse good sequence if all n are also non transverse 10 lemma 3 6 existence let n h be a sequence of schottky groups with n there exists a good sequence n of quasi circles of n in addition if n is also non transverse then is non transverse proof let fn be quasi conformal maps such that n fn let be a quasi circle of then n fn is a good sequence of quasi circles the non transverse property obviously is preserved corollary 3 7 linear invariant let n be a good sequence of linear quasi circles of n h is a linear quasi circle of proof linearity is obviously preserved at corollary 3 8 tranverse invariant let n be a good sequence of quasi circles of n h then is a non transverse linear quasi circle of if and only if n is a non transverse proof lemma 3 9 open let n h let n be a schottky group let be a quasi circle of then there exists a open neighboredood o of in such that every elements of o is a quasi circle of proof let f be a fundamental domain of let be the generating curve of with respect to f let fn be the fundamental domain of n with fn f by proposition 3 4 we have n let u n to be the open set about the generating curve n of n and set o n u n then o n is open sets of generating curves in figure 2 let o n fn o c for o c a open set of generating curves for c f 1 n n since is a quasi circle and fn f for large n we can choose sufficiently small neighborhood o c such that f o c is a open neighborhood of generating curves of let n fn o c and n be generated by n assuming o c is sufficiently small neighborhood we have length n c for some small c 1 for large n and n generated by all n fn o c since n we have is quasi circle of with bounded length this defines a open set which all elements are quasi circles in corollary 3 10 let n h with n a schottky group let n be a good sequence of quasi circles of n then there exists an open neigh borhood o of such that every element of o is a quasi circle of 11 figure 2 open set of generating curves about proof follows from lemma 3 6 and lemma 3 9 next we analyze the formations of singularities for a given sequence of classical schottky groups converging to a schottky group these types of singularities has been studied in 5 6 lemma 3 11 singularity let n h with n a schottky group assume that is non classical schottky group then there exists such that every o contains a non quasi circle here we say a closed curve is a non quasi circle if it s non jordan contains a singularity point or it s not invariant proof for each n let fn be a classical fundamental domain of n given a sequence of classical fundamental domains fn the convergence is consider as follows fn is collection of 2 g circles ci n i 1 2 g in the riemann sphere c pass to a subsequence if necessary then limn ci n is either a point or a circle we say fn convergents to g if g is a region that have boundary consists of limn ci n for each i which necessarily is either a point or a circle note that g is not necessarily a fundamental domain nor it s necessarily connected let limfn g by assumption that is not a classical schottky group we have g is not a classical fundamental domain of we have g consists of circles or points however these circles may not be disjoint more precisely we have the following possible degeneration of circles of fn which gives g of at least one of following singularities types tangency contains tangent circles 12 degeneration contains a circles degenerates into a point collapsing contains two circles collapses into one circle here we have two concentric circles centered at origin and rest circles squeezed in between these two and these two collapse into a single circle in g consider g contains a tangency let p be a tangency point let be a quasi circle of which pass through point p assume the lemma is false then all sufficiently small open neighborhood o contains only quasi circles of it follows from propo sition 3 2 we have a sequence with n let n be the generating curves of n with respect to fn define n as follows note that n fn consists of points or linear arcs we define n be a generating curve with n fn to consists of linear arcs with one of its end point to be the point that con verges into a tangency in g in addition we also require the arcs on fn that with a end points which converges to tangency point be be connect by a arc between the other end points it is clear that every o n fn contains a generating curve of this property let n be the quasi circle generated by n and set lim n then contains a loop singularity at a point of tangency figure 3 hence is non quasi circle of since every o contains such a we must have the lemma to be true for this type of singularity figure 3 tangency singularity consider g contains a degeneration in this case we must have any quasi circle n pass through a degeneration point note that we can t have all circles degenerates into a single point there are two possibilities to have degenerate points case a two circles merge into a single degenerate point p case b a circle degenerates into a point on a circle 13 consider a in this case any quasi circles will have two possible properties either there is a point q on some circle of g such that every quasi circle must pass through q or two separate arcs of meet at p the second possibility implies there exists a loop singularity at p hence can not be a jordan curve figure 4 therefore we only have the first possibility for but it follows from proposition 3 4 all rectifiable quasi circles of is the limit of some sequence of quasi circles of n and hence all must pass through q however q is not a limit point hence we can have some quasi circle not passing through q a contradiction figure 4 degenerate singularities now consider b here we can assume that there exists at least two circles that do not degenerates into points otherwise we will have the third type collapsing singularity which we will consider next having some circles degenerates into a point on to a circle at p we have a sequence of quasi circles n which passes through p this is given by the generating curves that have curves connecting the degenerating circle to point pn p converging to linear arc intersecting orthogonally at boundary but any neighboring quasi circle of n will converges to a with a loop singularity at p which is not a jordan curve figure 5 finally we note that if we have a degeneration point p which is not a limit point then there exists a neighboring quasi circle of that misses the point p hence any o will contains some curve which is the limit of a sequence of quasi circles that do not pass through the point this gives a non quasi circle in o consider g contain collapsing let c denote the collapsed circle first suppose that there exists such that it has a fixed point not on c then there are infinitely many elements with fixed points not on c let n n with n since 14 figure 5 degenerate singularities n fn g c we must have c either identical or disjoint sup pose that not all fixed points of elements of is contained in c then we have infinitely many fixed points not in c take three points a b c fixed points of elements of with a c and b c 6 c for sufficiently large n we must have some n n such that a b c is contained in three distinct disk of the complement of n fn this follows from the fact that the orbit f n of fn will have images with disks converging to fixed points and since they are distinct fixed points we must have some disks that only contain one of the points only since n fn c so converges to a circle but a b c are contained in distinct disks bounded by circles of n fn for all large n which implies a b c must lies on c hence c c 6 but they are not identical circles which is a contradiction hence all fixed points of elements of are c which implies c since is schottky group we must have is fuchsian group of second kind by 3 is classical schottky group a contradiction 4 proof of theorem 1 1 proof theorem 1 1 we proof by contradiction suppose that hc 1 first note that by selberg lemma we can just assume kleinian group to be torsion free now note that if a kleinian group of d 1 then it must be free to show this assume otherwise since d 1 and is purely loxodromic it is convex cocompact of second kind there exists an imbedded surface r in h 3 if r is incompressible then subgroup 1 r have d 1 r 1 which is contradiction if r is compressible then we can cut along 15 compression disks we either end with incompressible surface as before or after finitely many steps of cutting we obtain topological ball which implies h 3 is handle body hence free let n h and n with a schottky group it follows from lemma 3 9 that there exists an open set o such that every el ement is quasi circle of now if is non classical schottky group then by lemma 3 11 we must have every open set contains some non quasi circle in particular we must have o contain a non quasi circle but this gives a contradiction hence we must have is a classical schottky group finally sharpness comes from the fact that there exists kleinian groups which is not free of hausdorff dimension equal to one hence we have our result e mail yonghou princeton edu references 1 choquet bruhat y 2009 general relativity and the einstein equa tions oxford university press 2 bowen r 1979
