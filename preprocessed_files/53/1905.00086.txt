fourier mukai transforms euler green currents and k stability sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou abstract we provide an analog of the hilbert chow morphism for generalized discrim inants as an application we recover the main lemma from 11 as well as theorem 0 1 from 5 our work also exhibits a wide range of energy functionals in k hler geometry as fourier mukai transforms consequently these energies are completely determined by dual type varieties and therefore have logarithmic singularities when restricted to the space of algebraic potentials this work was inspired by the many ideas of

kyriakos sergiou 1 introduction and statement of results let x b be a flat relative dimension n family of smooth polarized linearly normal complex subvarieties of some fixed pn parametrized by a reduced and irreducible quasi projective base b we do not assume that b is smooth let q be a locally free sheaf of rank n 1 over x we assume that there is a finite dimensional subspace w x q generating each fiber this is equivalent to an exact sequence of vector bundles over x 0 s x w q 0 where the sub bundle s is the kernel of the evaluation map x w q this defines e q op w 1 x p w q op w 1 the evaluation section i p s 0 x p w z i by abuse of notation we also denote by the projection x p w b p w the situation may be visualized as follows e i x p w bb z b p w b b observe that the codimension of i in x p w is equal to n 1 k stability 3 the basic assumption in this paper is that i z is a simultaneous resolution of singularities this means i i z is birational ii for each b b ib p s xb zb z b p w is also birational our basic assumption implies that the codimension of zb in p w is one all of this data will be called a basic set up for the family x b next we observe that the degrees of the divisors zb are constant in b b this follows at once from the identity deg zb xb cn q xb 0 we will denote this common degree by d deg zb d for all b b therefore for each b b there is a unique up to scale irreducible polynomial fb fb cd w 0 such that fb 0 zb we may therefore define a map b o d p c d w b fb the main result of this paper is the following theorem 1 1 is a morphism of quasi projective varieties in particular is holomor phic 1 1 hermitean metrics and base change now we introduce hermitean metrics on ev erything via base change let s be a smooth complex algebraic variety together with a morphism to the base of our family x b s b the basic set up over b may be pulled back to a basic set up over s the corresponding morphism will still be denoted by our first assumption on s is that o 1 os o 1 the hyperplane over o d equivalently we may lift the map the the cone over o d c d w 0 s o d 4 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou by abuse of notation the lifted map will also be denoted by next we fix a positive definite hermitean form on w we let h w denote self adjoint positive linear maps on w this parametrises all postitive hermitian forms on w let h be a smooth map h s h w using this map we define a dynamic metric hs on the trivial bundle xs w hs p w 1 w 2 h p w 1 w 2 similarly we have the static metric h 0 p w 1 w 2 w 1 w 2 these metrics descend to metrics hqs and h q 0 on q the hermitean inner product on w induces a fubini study metric hmfs on op w m for any m z as well as a k hler form fs on p w this will be fixed throughout the paper tensoring h q s and h q 0 with hfs gives two metrics hes and h e 0 on e we need the following result from 1 theorem 1 2 bismut gillet soul let e m be a rank r holomorphic vector bundle over a complex manifold m given any hermitean metric he on e there exists a current e he d e whose wave front set is included in e r and which satisfies the following equation of currents on e 1 2 e he m e he the current e he can be pulled back to m by any section s and satisfies 1 2 s e he z s e he where e he c r rm is the euler form of e in chern weil theory moreover given two hermitean metrics he 0 and h e 1 the difference of the corresponding currents is smooth and up to and terms is given by s e he 0 s e he 1 e h e 1 h e 0 where e he 1 h e 0 denotes the bott chern double transgression of the euler form with re spect the given metrics we apply this result to our situation m x p w e q o 1 s so that z s i we assume that our two metrics he 0 and h e s satisfy the following conditions 1 a 1 1 2 e he 0 l fs i l fs l 1 dim w a 2 the function s 3 s 7 xs p w e hes l fs is pluriharmonic 1 condition a 2 comes from lemma 4 1 on pg 278 of 11 k stability 5 we need one more ingredient to state our next result let d z 0 recall that the mahler measure is defined by o d r f p w log f 2 hd fs f 22 lfs tian has shown 13 that proposition 1 1 is h lder continuous in particular it is bounded finally define s s and let o be a basepoint in s such that hes xo h e 0 xo 2 the following corollary of theorem 1 1 extends several ideas of gang tian especially 12 14 and 13 as well as the first author 11 corollary 1 1 the function s 3 s 7 log e s s 22 o 22 xs p w e he 0 h e s l fs 1 1 is pluriharmonic therefore if 1 s 1 there is an entire function f s c such that log e s s 22 o 22 xs p w e he 0 h e s l fs log f s 2 1 2 remark 1 in all applications f s is constant 1 2 g equivariant families and bergman metrics let g be a reductive complex alge braic group the family x b is said to be g equivariant provided that there exists a rational representation g cn 1 a rational action g aut b such that xb x b as the reader can imagine a g equivariant basic set up for this family requires an action of g on q which preserves w this gives another rational representation of g w g aut w it is not hard to see that the canonical section is g invariant therefore we have that zb z b for g fb f b 2 in our case this comes from assuming that h o idw h w 6 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou as a consequence the map b o d is g equivariant now choose any basepoint o b and consider the mapping g 3 o b g now becomes our choice of s observe that the change of base family xg is given concretely by xg y g pn y x o g xo as in the previous section a fixed choice of hermitian metric on w provides us with a mapping h g 3 w w h w h induces a dynamic metric on xg w w 3 w 1 w 2 w w 1 w w 2 the static metric is taken to be h e the same as in the previous section we assume that the metrics induced on e satisfy axioms a 1 and a 2 now we restate corollary 1 2 in the present special case assuming the entire function f g c is constant corollary 1 2 assume g is simply connected then the following identity holds for any fiber xo of the family x b log e e o 22 o 22 xo p w e he e he lfs 1 3 the right hand side of 1 2 can be expressed as an action functional e restricted to the bergman potentials associated to the embedding xo pn corollary 1 3 let c g be a one parameter subgroup of g then e t w o log t 2 o 1 t 1 1 4 where w o z denotes the weight 3 of o with respect to assume that 0 o b with corresponding fiber x pn then e t w log t 2 o 1 t 1 1 5 the important point in 1 5 is that lim t 0 t o 1 6 which follows at once from theorem 1 1 remark 2 1 6 can be used to recover a well known result of ding and tian see the claim just below 3 15 on pg 328 of 5 and was our initial motivation for writing this article 3 mumford called this the slope in 10 k stability 7 to summarize o is for each g a polynomial on w and e is a gener alization of the mabuchi k energy map for special choices of q it is the mabuchi energy up to lower order terms our work suggests that most action functionals e of interest on a polarized manifold are induced by the basic set up and in particular have logarithmic singularities along g in particular along algebraic one parameter subgroups t of g the asymptotic expansion of the integral of e t as t 0 is determined by the limiting behavior of the coefficients of t o as t 0 4 organization is a homogeneous polynomial with zero set z p w say in the second section we discuss the classical setting of how such z s arise they are objects of elimination theory in the third section we recall in detail an essential and rather ingenious idea of cayley that allows us to construct from z usually one can easily detect whether or not z has codimension one but it is very hard to find an explicit defining polynomial this is the main problem of classical elimination theory in the fourth section we use a vast generalization of cayley s idea due to grothendieck knudsen and mumford 9 which extends cayley s construction from a fixed variety to the more natural setting of a family of varieties over some base s this is where the fourier mukai transform makes an ap pearance in the final section we prove corollary 1 1 by introducing metrics on everything and invoking the currents of bismut gillet and soul on the one hand and the poincar lelong formula on the other 2 classical elimination theory let xn pn be a linearly normal subvariety we consider a parameter space f of linear sub objects f of pn that is f may parametrize points lines planes flags etc of pn consider the admittedly vague statement the general member f of f has a certain order of contact along x let z be the proper subvariety of those f s violating example 1 cayley chow forms we take s to be the grassmannian of n n 1 dimensional linear subspaces of pn f g n n 1 pn l cn 1 dim l n n 1 in this case the general member f l of s fails to meet x therefore we take z l g n n 1 pn l x 6 example 2 dual varieties let f p n the dual projective space parametrizing hyper planes h inside pn bertini s theorem provides us with our order of contact condition namely for generic h p n h x is smooth therefore we define z h p n h x is singular observe that z h p n there exists p x such that tp x h 4 for a concrete example of this see theorem b of 11 8 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou the next example includes both 1 and 2 as extreme cases example 3 higher associated hypersurfaces see 6 pg 104 fix l cn 1 dim l n 1 n 1 consider the subset u of the grassmannian defined by u e g r cn 1 h 0 e l e l cn 1 l 0 0 in order that u be open and dense in g r cn 1 it is enough to have r dim e n 1 n 1 n n therefore we set r n l where 0 l n by the rank plus nullity theorem of linear algebra we have dim e l dim l e dim e n l therfore e z g r cn 1 u if and only if dim e l n l 1 this motivates the following let xn pn fix 0 l n we define z e g n l 1 pn p x such that p e and dim e tp x n l in this situation we denote z by zl 1 x the reader should observe that zn 1 x rx 0 and z 1 x x 0 zn x plays a fundamental role in our study of the k energy see 11 in fact we have that zn x x pn 1 0 the dual variety of the segre image of x pn 1 in the situations of interest to us we may assume that f w for an appropriate finite dimensional vector space w for example in 1 we may replace g n n 1 pn with w m n 1 n 1 c in our applications z has codimension one then z w is an irreducible algebraic hypersurface defined by a single polynomial rz z f w rz f 0 z is naturally dominated by the variety of zeros of a larger system sj p f 0 in more variables p x we define the incidence variety ix by ix p f x w sj p f 0 x w in geometric terms p f ix if and only if f fails to meetx generically at p and possibly at some other point q therefore z is the resultant system obtained by eliminating the variable p rz f 0 iff f z iff sj f 0 has a solution p in x for the fixed f w k stability 9 3 linear algebra of complexes and the torsion of a exact complex to begin let e be a bounded complex of finite dimensional c vector spaces 0 e 0 0 ei i ei 1 i 1 n en 1 0 recall that the determinant of the complex e is defined to be the one dimensional vector space det e 1 n n 1 i 0 ri ei 1 i 1 ri dim e i remark 3 det e does not depend the boundary operators as usual for any vector space v we set v 1 homc v c the dual space to v let h i e denote the ith cohomology group of this complex when v 0 the zero vector space we set det v c the determinant of the cohomology is defined in exactly the same way det h e 1 n n 1 i 0 bi h i e 1 i 1 bi dim h i e we have the following well known facts 9 2 d 1 assume that the complex e is acyclic then det e is canonically trivial det e c as a corollary of this we have d 2 there is a canonical isomorphism 5 between the determinant of the complex and the determinant of its cohomology det e det h e it is d 1 which is relevant for our purpose it says is that there is a canonically given nonzero element of det e called the torsion of the complex provided this complex is exact the torsion is the essential ingredient in the construction of x resultants cayley chow forms and x discriminants dual varieties we recall the construction for more information see 2 define i dim iei now choose si i ei with isi 6 0 then isi si 1 spans ri 1 ei 1 since the complex is exact that is ri 1 ei 1 c isi si 1 with this said we define 6 tor e 1 n s 0 1 0 s 0 s 1 1 s 1 s 2 1 nsn 1 n 5 a canonical isomorphism is one that only depends on the boundary operators not on any choice of basis 6 the purpose of the exponent 1 n will be revealed in the next section 10 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou then we have the following reformulation of d 1 d 3 tor e is independent of the choices si 3 1 by fixing a basis ei 1 ei 2 eiri in each of the terms ei we may associate to this based exact complex a scalar tor e ei 1 e i 2 e i ri c which is defined through the identity tor e tor e ei 1 e i 2 e i ri det ei 1 e i 2 e i ri where we have set det ei 1 e i 2 e i ri 1 n e 01 e 0 r 0 1 en 11 e n 1 rn 1 1 n when we have fixed a basis of our exact complex that is a basis of each term in the com plex we will call tor e ei 1 ei 2 eiri the torsion of the based exact complex it is as we have said a scalar quantity remark 4 in the following sections we often base the complex without mentioning it explicitly and in such cases we write incorrectly tor e instead of tor e ei 1 ei 2 eiri we have the following well known scaling behavior of the torsion which we state in the next proposition since it is so important for us we provide the proof which is yet another application of the rank plus nullity theorem proposition 3 1 the degree of the torsion as a polynomial in the boundary maps degtor e 1 n 1 n 1 i 0 1 iidim ei 3 2 proof let c be a parameter then tor e 1 n s 0 1 0 s 0 s 1 1 s 1 s 2 1 nsn 1 n 0 1 2 1 n ntor e 1 n it is clear that 0 1 2 1 n n n 1 i 0 1 i 1 i i i 1 n 1 1 0 exactness of the complex implies that we have the short exact sequence 0 i 1 ei 1 ei i iei 0 therefore i i 1 dim ei k stability 11 4 fourier mukai transforms and the geometric technique in this section we prove theorem 1 1 the method of proof follows the geometric technique the author s understanding is that the technique is due to many mathematicians see 3 9 8 6 7 the author has also learned a great deal about the method from the monograph of j weyman 15 especially the basic set up of chapter 5 it seems that the application of the technique to complex differential geometry is new let x a complex variety let e be an exact bounded complex of locally free sheaves over x the discussion in the previous section implies the following proposition 4 1 the determinant line bundle of the complex admits a canonical nowhere vanishing section det e c we return to the situation described in the introduction the object of study is a smooth linearly normal family x b of relative dimension n together with a rank n 1 locally free sheaf q satisfying the requirements of a basic set up e i x p w bb z b p w b b the basic set up exchanges a high codimension family x b for a family of divisors zb p w parametrized by the same base zb z b p w b b recall that each zb is irreducible and moreover that the degree of zb in p w is given by deg zb xb cn q and therefore constant in b b to facilitate the study of z we pass to the birationally equivalent i which is much easier to deal with more precisely we study the direct image of the structure sheaf of i viewed as a coherent sheaf on x p w recall that the koszul complex k e y s associated to e s y s j 1 e y s j e y s y s ox p w resolves oi the main player in this paper is the following fourier mukai transform between the bounded derived categories 7 k e x 7 b p w d b x db b p w 7 in this paper db x is just notation for the set of bounded complexes of coherent sheaves on x 12 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou associated to the projections x p w p yy x b p w recall that this transform is defined by the formula k e x 7 b p w f r l p f k e where r and l p denote the usual derived functors we remind the reader that by grauert s theorem of coherence of higher direct images that the complex k e x 7 b p w f is represented by a bounded complex of quasi coherent ob p w modules with coher ent cohomology sheaves we are interested in the value of this transform at a particular point of db x k e x 7 b p w ox m d b b p w m 0 since the twisted koszul complex resolves oi p ox m we see that the cohomology sheaves of the complex k e x 7 b p w ox m are all supported on z take m large enough to force the term wise vanishing of all higher direct image sheaves ri j e p ox m 0 i 0 all j this has the crucial implication that the natural map e p ox m k e x 7 b p w ox m is the identity indb b p w in other words the two complexes are quasi isomorphic this is a consequence of the following lemma lemma 4 1 let a and b be abelian categories assume that a has enough injectives let f a b be a left exact functor let n denote a bounded below complex of elements of a where each term is f acyclic rif n j 0 i 0 all j then for any injective resolution n i the induced map of complexes f n f f f i f is a quasi isomorphism proof see lemma 8 5 pg 188 of 4 k stability 13 remark 5 by definition f i f is the f derived image of n lemma 4 1 allows us to replace the apriori quite complicated object k e x 7 b p w ox m with the much simpler termwise direct image complex e p ox m the purpose of the foregoing discussion was to put us in the following situation proposition 4 2 the complex of locally free sheaves over b p w e p ox m is exact away from z therefore away from z the determinant of the direct image complex has a nowhere vanishing section det e p ox m b p w z ee tor e p ox m proposition 4 3 there is an invertible sheaf a over b such that det e p ox m p 1 a p 2 ow d proof the proof is quite easy observe that by the projection formula the stalk of the direct image of our koszul complex at b b is given by je p ox m b h 0 xb jq m ow j we define rj m dimh 0 xb jq m then we define a as follows a b 0 j n 1 rj m h 0 xb jq m 1 j 1 therefore the determinant is given by det e p ox m p 1 a ow where we have defined z by 0 j n 1 1 j 1 jrj m z so the argument comes down to showing that d which a straightforward but tedious calculation with the hirzebruch riemann roch theorem will verify 14 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou fix b b let fb denote a defining polynomial of zb since b p w is without zeros or poles away from zb there is an integer ordzb b p w satisfying b p w f ordzb b p w b our computation of the degree of the torsion shows that deg b p w d therefore ordzb b p w 1 and we have shown c b p w c fb therefore we have the following proposition 4 4 vanishes on z and in particular extends to a global section of the determinant line therefore to any basic set up for the family x b we may associate the following an invertible sheaf a pic b an algebraic section h 0 b p w p 1 a p 2 ow d a relative cartier divisor z over b z div b p w moreover the direct image t of a h 0 p w ow d b t p 1 ee never vanishes on b this package induces a morphism also denoted by from b to the complete linear system on p w b ow d as follows since t 6 0 t gives an injection 0 ob t a h 0 p w o d dualizing and tensoring with a gives a surjection h 0 p w o d b a 0 k stability 15 hence a is globally generated therefore we obtain a morphism as required this completes the proof of theorem 1 1 moreover we see that o o d 1 a and the natural map h 0 p w o d h 0 b a is an injection the map exhibits a large generating finite dimensional subspace of the space of sections of a over b conversely given such a map we define a o o d 1 b w b w ab ow d next we give several examples of basic set ups for a given family x b 4 1 the basic set up for resultants let x b be a flat family of polarized subvarieties of pn we can arrange a basic set up e p 1 opn 1 p 2 q i x g bb 2 1 pn g ee z b g p 1 b 16 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou for this family if we define v l cv cn 1 l zv l zv l cn 1 cn 1 l denotes the projection 2 1 g g n n 1 n e 2 1 p 1 opn 1 p 2 q i 0 x g b g is defined by 8 x l x l z i zb is the cayley form of xb and b is the xb resultant 4 2 the basic set up for discriminants in this section we consider a flat family x b of polarized manifolds the basic set up that we consider in this case has the form e p 1 u p 2 op n 1 x x p n s cc 1 p g n n p n ee z b p n p 1 b k stability 17 in the diagram above we have defined l f l cn 1 ker f u ker f u ker f cn 1 cn 1 ker f denotes the projection observe that l f 0 if and only if l ker f x x g n n is the fiber wise gauss map u is the tautological bundle e 1 p 1 u p 2 op n 1 x s 0 z q x zb is the dual variety of xb and b is the xb discriminant remark 6 an interesting generalisation of these two examples is constructed as follows given a family x b let ek denote the rank n k 1 trivial bundle over x then we obtain a new family p ek b the fiberwise segre embedding exhibits this family as a family of subvarieties of the pro jective space of matrices of size n 1 n k 1 if the original family is smooth one may apply the set up for discriminants to this new family when k 1 the corresponding polynomial b is the xb hyperdiscriminant 5 comparing the currents z and i over s now we prove corollary 1 1 to begin let s b be a morphism from a smooth 9 variety s as stated in the introduction we assume a os and there exists a smooth map h s h w satisfying conditions a 1 and a 2 there is an induced hermitean metric on h on the deter minant line bundle p 1 a p 2 ow d and it is not hard to see that the square of the length of our section is given by s w 2 hd s 22 9 smoothness is required to apply the poincar lelong formula 18 sean timothy paul and kyriakos sergiou the denominator being the usual l 2 norm s 22 p w s 2 hd lfs l 1 dim w the poincar lelong formula gives 1 2 log s w 2 hd s 22 z c 1 a ow d h recall that the triviality of a over s is equivalent to having a lift of 10 the map to the affine cone s h 0 p w o d 0 next fix some base point o s then c 1 a ow d h s p w d fs 1 2 log s 22 o 22 with this said we have the following proposition concerning the direct image of this current under proposition 5 1 let be a smooth compactly supported form on s c dim s 1 dim s 10 s then z lfs s 1 2 log e s s 22 o 22 where is defined by s p w log s w 2 hd s 22 lfs the birationality of i and z imply that we have the identity z lfs i lfs for all compactly supported forms on s property a 1 of the current e he 0 implies that z lfs x p w 1 2 e he 0 l property a 2 and the variation formula show that xs p w e he 0 l xs p w e he 0 h e s l a pluriharmonic function of s therefore we see that for all compactly supported forms we have s 1 2 xs p w e he 0 h e s l s 1 2 log e s s 22 o 22 therefore we have proved corollary 1 1 10 we will also denote the lifted map by as well k stability 19 given a fixed projective variety x pn with a non degenerate dual variety x we construct following 13 a tautological family x g where g sl n 1 c with fiber x then for each 0 k dim x we consider the new family p ek g let q denote the vector bundle associated to the set up for discriminants for this family then for the obvious choice of hermitean inner product on w there is a natural map h g h w satisfying a 1 and a 2 with basepoint o e the corresponding action s e 11 are related to the higher k energy maps of mabuchi references 1 gilllet h bismut j m and soul c complex immersions and arakelov geometry
