rutgers university newark nj 07102 usa 2 department of mathematics and statistics texas tech university lubbock tx 79409 1042 usa abstract in this work we analyze the flow filtration process of slightly compressible fluids in porous media containing man made fractures with complex geometries we model the coupled fracture porous media system where the linear darcy flow is considered in porous media and the nonlinear forchheimer equation is used inside the fracture we develop a model to examine the flow inside fractures with complex geometries and variable thickness on a riemannian manifold the fracture is represented as the normal variation of a surface immersed in r 3 using operators of laplace beltrami type and geo metric identities we model an equation that describes the flow in the fracture a reduced model is obtained as a low dimensional bvp we then couple the model with the porous media theoretical and numerical analysis have been performed to compare the solutions be tween the original geometric model and the reduced model in reservoirs containing fractures with complex geometries we prove that the two solutions are close and therefore the reduced model can be effectively used in large scale simulators for long and thin fractures with complicated geometry 1 introduction fractured reservoir modeling is a multi scale and multi physics complex problem where analysis and simulation of this complex system require a deep understanding of the physical processes that describe the flow coupling at different scales we consider flows in the porous media which include fractures of the same dimension as the reservoir itself in practice fracture domain is very long compared to its width and require a special care from analytical and numerical point of view moreover the geometry of the fracture domain is a significant characteristic effects of complex geometric features of fractures such as variable thickness which is very small and the curvature of the fracture s boundary are usually not taken into consideration during the simulations which prevents successful reservoir modeling and leads to errors in forecasting the reservoir performance pushpi

to simplify the problem by treating the fracture as a 1 d sink with pressure on the fracture equals to the value of the pressure on the well or with given flux and the flow occurs in the porous media surrounding the fracture mathematically this is formulated as a dirichlet or neumann boundary condition on the fracture for pressure function which satisfies an elliptic or parabolic equation of second order this assumption leads to a significant overestimation of the fracture capacity in our previous paper 19 we consider the nonlinear nature of the flow inside the fracture and couple it with the flow in the porous media the main goal of this paper is to incorporate complex geometric features of the fractures into the modeling and explore the pressure distribution of the flow we develop a framework based on methods of differential geometry to model the fractures with complicated geometries in our approach we formulate the fracture as a 3 d manifold immersed in porous media and we introduce a reduced dimensional nonlinear flow equation inside the fracture we consider slightly compressible fluid flows in the inhomogeneous reservoir fracture domain due to the heterogeneity of the fractured porous media the velocity of the flow inside the fracture is much higher than inside porous media it was observed that due to high velocity inside fractures the inertial effects become significant therefore the relation between the flow velocity and the pressure gradient inside the fractures deviates from darcy s law 8 14 9 we consider darcy s law to model the flow in porous media and a generalized nonlinear forchheimer equation to describe the flow inside the fracture it is evident that the fluid mostly flows towards the fracture first and then transports to the well along the fracture consequently the total production of the hydrocarbon depends on the capacity of the fracture to take in fluid from the reservoir this capacity depends on the geometry of the fracture and its conductivity and it is characterized by the productivity index of the reservoir fracture system in past we proved that an integral functional called diffusive capacity defined as the total flux on the well surface divided by the pressure drawdown difference between average pressures of the reservoir domain and the well boundary is mathematically equal to productivity index 7 we use the diffusive capacity to characterize the reservoir performance we formulate a model to investigate the flow inside fractures with complex geometries in particular the fracture is represented as a perturbation across the fracture thickness in the nor mal direction to the barycentric surface immersed in r 3 with its naturally induced riemannian metric moreover we formulate the flow equation inside the fracture using the first and second fundamental forms of the surface geometric identities for gaussian curvature and mean curva ture and corresponding operators of the laplace beltrami type on the boundary of the domain of the flow union of porous media and fracture we impose mixed boundary conditions on the well we impose dirichlet condition this coupled fluid flow is impossible to solve numerically since the thickness of the fracture is of the 106 smaller than the length of the fracture therefore we introduce a reduced model for the flow inside the fracture domain moreover we obtain further simplified models with further assumptions that can be utilized depending on the size of the fracture thickness and other physical factors we theoretically and numerically investigate the difference between the solutions of the actual model and the reduced models we confirm the successful implementation of the models by proving that the solutions of the reduced models are close to the solutions of the actual model for realistic values of fracture thickness controlling the shape of the fractures in geological reservoirs is challenging therefore our method can be applied mostly for simple fracture geometries however the geometric method and the analysis we introduce in this paper are valuable tools in modeling micro fluidic flows and blood flows in arteries and veins 6 23 moreover we believe that this methodology can be served as a foundation for reservoir engineers to model fractures in the future 2 2 formulation of the problem and preliminary results in this section we summarize important preliminary results on darcy forchheimer equations from our paper 19 2 1 reservoir modeling mathematical framework of the reservoir modeling is based on darcy forchheimer equation the continuity equation and the state equation 7 9 18 among various methods that demonstrate non darcy case non linear forchheimer equation is widely utilized 13 12 14 21 the velocity vector field v and the pressure p in porous media are related by the forchheimer equation given by k v v v p 1 where k is the permeability is the viscosity and is the density of the fluid this describes the momentum conservation of the flow remark 1 in our intended application the parameters of the reservoir and the fracture are isotropic and space dependent namely k kp and 0 in the porous block and k kf and 6 0 in the fracture the continuity equation takes the form t v 0 2 for slightly compressible fluids the state equation is given by 1 0 exp 1 p p 0 3 where is the compressibility constant of the fluid in natural reservoirs the dissipation in the porous media is dominant 18 we assume that the permeability coefficient k is very small moreover for many slightly compressible fluids is of order 108 2 9 8 with these constraints the system can be rewritten as 19 p t v 4 p k v v v 0 5 darcy forchheimer equation the velocity vector field v can be uniquely represented as a function of the pressure gradient as follows v v f p p 6 f p 2 2 4 p 7 where k eq 6 is referred as darcy forchheimer equation the velocity defined in darcy forchheimer equation 6 with f defined by eq 7 solves the forchheimer equation 5 19 the coefficient in the non linear term of the eq 6 does not depend on pressure changes of density of slightly compressible fluids have a minor impact on changes in the coefficient 9 3 remark 2 as 0 the darcy forchheimer equation reduces to darcy equation function f has important monotonic properties lemma 2 1 for f defined as above the function f is strictly monotonic on bounded sets more precisely f 1 1 f 2 2 1 2 1 2 f max 1 2 1 2 2 8 the proof follows from lemma 2 4 in ref 17 with a 1 2 lemma 2 2 let f be defined by the formula 6 with the above assumptions the pressure function p satisfies the quasi linear parabolic equation p t f p p 9 substituting eq 6 to the continuity equation 4 eq 9 can be obtained for more details see 20 2 2 diffusive capacity and pseudo steady state regime pss system 4 5 characterizes the fluid flow of well exploitation in a reservoir analogous to the reservoir engineering concept of productivity index pi that is used to measure the capacity and the performance of the well we introduce the mathematical notion called the diffusive capacity let be a bounded reservoir domain bounded by the exterior no flux boundary out and the well surface w let n be the outward unit normal on the piece wise smooth surface w definition 2 3 diffusive capacity let the pressure p and the velocity v form the solution for the system 4 5 in with impermeable boundary condition v n out 0 then the diffusive capacity is defined by jp t w v n ds p t p w t 10 where p t p w t is called the pressure draw down pdd on the well p t 1 p d p w t 1 w w p ds is the volume of the reservoir and w is the area of the well it has been observed on field data that when the well production rate q t q const the well productivity index stabilizes to a constant value over time 22 definition 2 4 pss regime let the well production rate q be time independent w v n ds q the flow regime is called a pseudo steady state pss regime if the pressure draw down pdd p t p w t is constant corollary 1 for a pss regime the diffusive capacity pi is time invariant 4 2 2 1 pss solution for the initial boundary value problem let be a bounded reservoir domain with impermeable exterior boundary and p x t 0 p x 0 be the given initial pressure in the reservoir assume that the well is operating under time independent constant rate of production q and the initial reservoir pressure is known then the ibvp that models the oil filtration process can be formulated as 1 p t f p p 11 w f p p n ds q 12 p n out 0 13 p x t 0 p 0 x 14 since the boundary condition on w is a single integral condition for the total flux the ibvp 11 14 has infinitely many solutions so we constrain the solution to an auxiliary problem by assuming the solution to be constant in space on w a more general situation has been considered in 5 2 2 2 steady state auxiliary bvp let q be the rate of production assume that the boundary is smooth letw be the solution of the auxiliary steady state bvp f w w q in 15 w w 0 16 w n out 0 17 through integration by parts we can obtain w f w w n ds q 18 proposition 1 let w x be the solution of the auxiliary problem 15 17 then p x t w x at k 19 where a q solves the ibvp 11 14 for this solution we have the pseudo steady state and therefore the diffusive capacity is constant proof proposition 1 is followed by substituting 19 to eq 11 and verifying boundary and initial conditions 12 14 the constant k in eq 19 is a measure of the initial oil reserve with definition 7 and monotonicity property in lemma 2 1 the bvp 15 17 has a unique weak solution w x belonging to w 1 3 2 4 however hereafter we only consider solutions w x that satisfy w c 2 and w w c 2 17 5 2 3 fractured reservoir modeling in this section we introduce a fracture to the reservoir domain we model the oil filtration process with a constant rate of production q for a fractured reservoir system for more details please see 19 consider a fractured reservoir domain where the exterior boundary out is impermeable let p be the porous media domain f be the fracture domain f be the boundary between the fracture and the porous

continuity of the solutions and the continuity of the fluxes across the interface f respectively notice that we consider the linear darcy law inside the reservoir while the non linear forchheimer equation is considered inside the fracture 3 geometric modeling of the fracture fractures in porous media have very complicated geometry the domain of the fracture is very long compared to its thickness the fracture thickness is changing along the length and the fracture boundary has curvature as discussed in the introduction neglecting those geometric features lead to over estimation of the fracture capacity in this section we employ methods in differential geometry to model the fractures with complex geometries then we obtain an equation for flow inside these fractures first we introduce some definitions 10 15 16 that we will use in the modeling and obtain some preliminary results 6 definition 3 1 see 10 an immersion is a differentiable function between differentiable man ifolds whose derivative is everywhere injective explicitly f m n is an immersion if dpf tpm tf p n is an injective function at every point p of m where tpx denotes the tangent space of a manifold x at

on the manifold is defined by g i 1 g i g i 30 using eqs 28 and 30 the laplace beltrami operator applied to a scalar is given by g g g 1 g i j i gij g j 31 next we obtain the darcy forchheimer equation on the manifold m 7 lemma 3 6 let f g p g 2 2 4 g p g 32 where p is the pressure then the velocity defined by the darcy forchheimer equation on the manifold m v f g p g g p 33 solves the forchheimer equation on m v v g v g p 34 proof using eq 33 eq 34 can be rewritten as g p g g p f 2 f 1 g p 0 35 using eq 29 we have g p g g p g p g and therefore g p g f 2 f 1 g p 0 36 we need to show that 32 solves the above equation for g p 0 it is true for any f for g p g 6 0 then f should satisfy g p g f 2 f 1 0 37 the positive root is given by f g p g 2 4 g p g 2 g p g 38 or equivalently f g p g 2 2 4 g p g 39 which is obtained multiplying both denominator and numerator of 38 by 2 4 g p g 3 1 geometric model of the fracture as a 3 d manifold in this section we model the fracture as a 3 d manifold immersed in porous media in our approach we formulate the fracture as a parametrized riemannian hypersurface please see 20 for more details we describe the fracture as the normal variation of a surface r u v immersed in r 3 given by r u v r u v n u v 40 where r u v x u v y u v z u v 41 8 n is the outward unit normal vector to the surface such that n ru rv ru rv 42 and h u v h u v here 2 h u v represents the thickness of the fracture let g gij be the first fundamental form of r u v given by g gij ru ru ru rv rv ru rv rv 43 and second fundamental form of r u v is given by l m m n ruu n ruv n rvu n rvv n 44 since ri u v n u v 0 ni u v n u v 0 n u v n u v 1 for i j u v the coefficients of the first fundamental form can be rewritten as g 11 g 11 2 l nu 2 2 g 12 g 12 2 m nu nv 2 g 22 g 22 2 n nv 2 2 g 13 g 31 0 g 23 g 32 0 g 33 1 let g be the determinant of g k be the gaussian curvature of r u v and h be the mean curvature of r u v given by 10 g g 11 g 22 g 212 k ln m 2 g h g 11 n 2 g 12 m g 22 l 2 g let g be the determinant and g 1 gij be the inverse matrix of g respectively we have g g 4 h g 4 k g g 11 nv 2 2 g 12 nu nv g 22 nu 2 2 2 l nv 2 2 m nu nv n nu 2 3 nu 2 nv 2 nu nv 2 4 45 with this metric g and the coefficients defined above next we obtain the equation for pressure of the flow inside the fracture domain 3 2 flow equation inside the fracture now we model the pressure distribution of a nonlinear flow inside the fracture domain f which is defined as a general manifold described above the boundary of the domain of the flow is split as f w f out fout 9 f u v

g i j i f g w g g gij jw q in f 46 or equivalently i j i f g w g g gij jw g q in f 47 where f g w g 2 2 4 g w g g w 2 g i j gij iw jw i j 1 2 3 and 1 u 2 v 3 let n f be the unit outward normal vector to the top bottom boundary f and n be the unit outward normal vector to the boundaries fout and out following mixed boundary conditions are imposed on the boundaries dirichlet condition on the well w flux conditions on the top and the bottom boundaries f no flux condition on outer boundaries fout and out moreover for simplicity we assume no flow in v direction namely w 0 on w 48 v n f q u v on f 49 v n 0 on fout out 50 3 3 reduced model of the flow inside the fracture in this section we simplify the original flow equation inside the fracture given by eq 47 and obtain a reduced dimensional model for the flow in the fracture using the fact that g 23 g 32 0 g 33 1 and integrating eq 47 over the thickness of the fracture we get 10 q h u v h u v g d h u v h u v i j i f g w g g gij jw f g w g g w d 51 where i j 1 2 proposition 2 assume that the boundary conditions 48 50 hold then eq 51 can be reduced to i j i h u v h u v f g w g g gij jw d q h u v h u v g d q u v q u v 52 where i j 1 2 q u v q 1 h 2 u h 2 v g q u v q 1 h 2 u h 2 v g proof using the leibniz rule the first integral of the right hand side of eq 51 can be rewritten as h h i j i f g w g g gij jw d i j i h h f g w g g gij

1 h 2 u h 2 v 55 v f g w f i j gij iw j 56 11 therefore on f we have f g hug 11 hvg 21 uw hug 12 hvg 22 vw w h f g g 11 uw g 12 vw g 21 uw g 22 vw w hu hv 1 t g f g w n f 1 h 2 u h 2 v q u v 57 similarly we can show that on f f g hug 11 hvg 21 uw hug 12 hvg 22 vw w h q u v 58 hence hi f g gij jw h f g gij jw h f g w h f g w h q u v q u v 59 therefore using eqs 59 53 and 54 eq 51 can be rewritten as i j i h u v h u v f g w g g gij jw d q h u v h u v g d q u v q u v 60 the thickness of the fracture is several orders smaller compared to the length of the fracture therefore it is reasonable to assume that the flow inside the fracture in the normal direction to the barycentric surface is negligible with that assumption we obtain the reduced model for the flow pressure in the fracture proposition 3 reduced model i let all the conditions of proposition 2 are satisfied assume that the gradient of w is independent of then the equation for pressure of the flow inside the fracture can be given by i j i l ij jw q a q u v q u v 61 where lij h h f g w g g gij d a h h g d i j 1 2 we use numerical integration 3 point gauss quadrature rule to evaluate integrals lij for i j 1 2 and a 12 3 4 reduced model of the fracture when the metric g does not depend on for fractures with small thicknesses it is reasonable to assume that the solution of the flow equation in the direction of the thickness does not change namely we assume that the solution w does not depend on the parameter and consequently the first fundamental form of r u v g does not depend on as well therefore next we further simplify the reduced model i proposition 4 reduced model ii let all the conditions of theorem 3 are satisfied in addition assume that the first fundamental form of r u v depends on the function r u v only does not depend on g g u v 0 g 11 g 12 0 g 21 g 22 0 0 0 1 62 then the pressure inside the fracture is subjected to the equation 2 i j i h u v f gw g g gij jw 2 q h u v g q u v q u v 63 i j 1 2 where q u v q 1 h 2 u h 2 v g q u v q 1 h 2 u h 2 v g proof follows from theorem 3 remark 3 the reason why we consider two reduced models is the following reduced model i is more comprehensive it originates from the actual model under the assumption that the gradient of the pressure function w does not depend on the parameter which physically means that the velocity inside the fracture in the orthogonal direction to the barycentric surface is negligible in this case the coefficients of the equation lij implicitly depend on through integration reduced model ii is a simplified version of the reduced model i in which coefficients of the equation do not depend on consequently the corresponding solution does not depend on it is clear that as the thickness of the fracture becomes big enough the solution obtained from the reduced model ii will significantly deviate from the actual model in section 5 we investigate this numerically in detail 4 estimates for the difference between the solutions of the original model and the reduced models in this section we provide estimates for the difference between the solution of the original model and the solution of the reduced model ii when the fracture domain f is considered to be a foliation of a cylindrical surface in r 3 namely r u v u v f u and h u v h u we first investigate the difference between the solutions only inside the fracture with given fluxes theorem 4 5 and then we investigate the difference between the solutions in the coupled domain theorem 4 6 13 proposition 5 let all the conditions of proposition 4 then the equation for pressure inside the fracture as a foliation of a cylindrical surface in r 3 is given by u 2 h u 1 f 2 u f gw g uw 2 q h u 1 f 2 u q u q u 64 where q u q 1 h 2 u 1 f

difference between the solutions of the two problems can be controlled by the boundary data 17 however it should be noted that in the reservoir fracture system as h goes to zero the fracture vanishes and the oil flows mostly towards the well then as h becomes smaller q and q gets smaller as well and therefore the individual velocities remain bounded next we investigate the coupled fractured porous media domain we show a much stronger result under the condition that as h 0 the fluxes on the fracture boundary vanish with the same speed 4 2 estimates for the difference between the solutions in

estimate for the difference between the solutions of the original problem and the reduced problem goes to zero as h going to zero representing a much stronger estimate 5 numerical analysis and simulations in this section we present numerical results to demonstrate the validity of our approach namely we show that the solutions of the reduced model i 3 and the reduced model ii 4 are close to the solution of the original problem 46 for different fracture reservoir geometries all the simulations have been performed using comsol multiphysics software 1 the grid size has been refined until changes in the pressure distribution between the previous and the next steps are negligible the length and the thickness of the fracture is selected in relative units and are dimensionless hydrodynamic parameters such as permeability and forchheimer coefficient are numerically chosen without bonding to actual data of the porous media properties in all simulations the following parameters have been fixed permeability in the porous media kp 0 01 permeability inside the fracture kf 1 and production rate q 1 5 1 pressure distribution of the flow inside the fracture in this section we compare the pressure distributions of the flow obtained from the original model the reduced model i and the reduced model ii inside the domain of fracture only for different fracture geometries for both examples 5 1 and 5 2 we perform the following numerical simulations first we obtain the solution of the original model 46 inside the fracture imposing zero dirichlet boundary condition on the well given flux boundary conditions on the top and bottom of the fracture and zero neumann boundary condition on the right end namely system 48 50 with q 10 then we solve the reduced model i 61 and reduced model ii 63 on the barycentric line of the fracture cross section with zero dirichlet boundary condition on the well and zero neumann boundary condition on the right end example 5 1 we consider the fracture geometry with barycentric surface given by r u v u v 1 u 2 with u v 3 2 3 2 and constant thickness 2 h u since the solution of the problem does not depend on v we solve our equations only on the cross section given in figure 5 22 figure 5 fracture geometry 1 pressure distribution inside a thin fracture 2 h u 0 025 left and a thick fracture 2 h u 1 right obtained using the original model in figure 6 we compare the pressure distributions obtained from the original model on the barycentric line of the fracture cross section and the reduced models for 0 1 2 h u 0 025 left and 2 h u 1 right it is evident that the solutions are almost identical to each other when the thickness of the fracture is relatively small when the thickness is large it can be observed that the solution obtained from the reduced model i is very close to the solution of the original model but the solution of the reduced model ii deviates from the original one this can be explained by the presence versus the absence of the parameter in the reduced model i and ii respectively as explained in remark 3 figure 6 fracture geometry 1 comparison between the pressure distributions obtained from the original model the reduced i and reduced model ii for 0 1 2 h u 0 025 left and 2 h u 1 right respectively example 5 2 next we consider the fracture geometry with barycentric surface given by r u v u v 2 sin u with u v 0 2 and variable thickness 2 h u 0 2 2 0 5 sin 7 u again since the solution of the problem does not depend on v we solve our equations only on the cross section given in figure 7 23 figure 7 fracture geometry 4 pressure distribution inside a fracture with changing thickness obtained using the original model in this example the thickness of the fracture changes depending on the parameter u in figure 8 we compare the pressure distributions obtained from the original model on the barycentric line of the fracture cross section the reduced model i and the reduced model ii for 0 darcy and 0 1 forchheimer the solutions of the reduced model i remain close to the solutions of the original model however the solutions of the reduced model ii deviate from the solutions of the original model especially in the forchheimer case figure 8 fracture geometry 4 comparison between the pressure distributions inside the fracture obtained using the original model the reduced model i and the reduced model ii for 0 left and 0 1 right respectively 5 2 diffusive capacity in the coupled fractured porous media domain in this section we calculate the diffusive capacities in the coupled fracture reservoir domain using the original model 47 and the reduced model i 61 the productivity index which characterizes the well capacity to take in hydrocarbons from reservoir depends on the geometry of the fracture and its conductivity and it is evaluated using the diffusive capacity of the well reservoir fracture system denote the diffusive capacities of the original model and the reduced model i by pipd and pir 1 respectively we compare the diffusive capacities obtained from the two models as the amplitude of the thickness h and 24 forchheimer coefficient changes for different geometries of the fracture in the reservoir also we evaluate the relative error as error pipd pir 1 pipd the goal here is to show that in the fully coupled domain the diffusive capacity calculated using the reduced model i is very close to the diffusive capacity calculated using the original model example 5 3 in this example we numerically investigate the pressure distribution and the diffusive capacity of an infinite long reservoir whose cross section is the rectangle 10 20 10 10 the well is modeled as an infinite long cylindrical surface with square cross section of side length 0 5 centered on the y axis and rotated by 60 degrees around it the fracture barycentric surface is given by r u v xc yc zc u v 2 sin u with u v 0 2 and variable thickness 2 h u h 2 0 5 sin 7 u the vector xc yc zc 18 0 3 8 has been chosen so that the fracture starts from the center of the top right face of the well since the solution of the problem does not depend on y we solve our equations only on the cross section of the domain given in figures 9 left and right figure 9 coupled domain 1 pressure distributions in the coupled fracture porous media domain with h 0 1 and 0 001 obtained using the original model left and the reduced model i right respectively first we couple the original flow equation inside the fracture with the flow in the porous media by imposing the continuity of the solutions and the continuity of the fluxes across the fracture boundaries zero dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the well zero flux boundary conditions are imposed on all the outer boundaries of the reservoir and on the right end of the fracture then we solve the coupled system using the flow equations in the reduced model i with zero dirichlet boundary condition on the well and zero neumann boundary condition on the right end of the fracture figure 9 presents the pressure distributions in the coupled domain obtained using the original model left and the reduced model i right for h 0 1 and 0 001 the colors indicate that the fluid first converges towards the fracture and then flows towards the well in figure 10 we compare the pressure distributions obtained using the original model on the barycentric line of the fracture cross section and the reduced model i for 0 darcy and 100 forchheimer it is evident that the solutions of the two models are very close to each other 25 figure 10 coupled domain 1 comparison between the pressure distributions in the coupled fracture porous media domain obtained using the original model and the reduced model i for h 0 01 0

tables 1 and 2 confirm that the diffusive capacities obtained from both models increase with increasing fracture thickness for all at the same time their values decrease when the forchheimer coefficient increases 27 this numerical results have a clear physical interpretation moreover we can see the error is small for all values of h and the error increases with h while it has a slight dependence on obtained results show that as h 10 2 the errors are very small and therefore the reduced model i can be effectively used in large scale simulators for long and thin fractures with complicated geometries 6 conclusion in this paper we investigated the flow filtration process of slightly compressible fluids in porous media containing fractures with complex geometries we modeled the coupled fractured porous media system where the linear darcy flow is considered in porous media and the nonlinear forchheimer equation is used inside the fracture using methods in differential geometry we formulated the fracture as a manifold immersed in porous media the equation for pressure of the flow inside the fracture was modeled and then a reduced model where the fracture is presented as a boundary inside porous media was obtained theoretical and numerical results were obtained to prove the closeness of the solutions of the actual model and the solutions of the reduced model both inside the fracture and in the coupled domain the main conclusion can be formulated as for actual field data where the thickness of the fracture is small compared to the length of the fracture the reduced model can be effectively used in large scale simulators for long and thin fractures with complicated geometry controlling the shape of the fractures in geological reservoirs is a challenging problem there fore our method can be applied mostly for simple fracture geometries however the geometric method and the analysis we introduced in this paper are valuable tools in modeling micro fluidic flows and blood flows in arteries and veins moreover we believe that this methodology can be served as a foundation for reservoir engineers to model fractures in the future
