upgraded laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo recorded a loud gravitational wave gw signal emitted a billion light years away by a coalescing binary of two stellar mass black holes the detection was announced in february 2016 in time for the hundredth anniversary of einstein s prediction of gws within the theory of general relativity gr the signal represents the first direct

february 11 modestly titled scientists to provide up date on the search for gravitational waves and yet scheduled at the high profile national press club in washington dc by then it was a known secret that the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo had accomplished the first direct detection of gravitational waves even if the 1 000 scientist involved in the experiment had amazingly kept details almost secret these details were stunning ligo had recorded waves from the inspiral and merger of two black holes at a luminosity distance of 400 mpc a billion light years until then black hole binaries were theorized to exist but never observed let alone in their final merger phase furthermore the shape of the gravitational wave implied that both holes were heavier than 25 solar masses more than was thought possible in the astrophysical theory of binary evolution this would be truly a historic scientific announcement appropriately marking the 100 th anniver sary of einstein s first prediction of the existence of gravitational waves gws at the press conference ligo laboratory executive director david reitze did not waste time getting to the point once he reached the podium he announced simply ladies and gentlemen we have detected gravitational waves we did it in this article we celebrate the ligo milestone by drawing a brief history of gravitational wave science a field that reached its maturity thanks to astonishing progress in experimental physics but also due to crucial developments in several fields of mathematics and allied disciplines including differential geometry partial differential equations pdes high performance computation numerical analysis signal processing statistical inference and data science the emergence of gravitational wave science 3 2 space and time einstein s theory of general relativity gr which is the theory of gravity he introduced to the world in 1915 has many features which are distinct from newton s gravitational theory one such feature is that it is a theory of space time the geometry of which is not fixed but instead governed by its own set of field equations rather than being described as a force on a fixed space time arena gravity is embedded in the geometry of space time in galileo s and newton s everyday notion of space and time we are used to the concepts of a universal time simultaneity and a fixed geometry of space the latter is governed by our everyday notion of distances l 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 or in infinitesimal terms 2 1 dl 2 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 more accurately the space of newtonian physics is a three dimensional manifold m typically but not necessarily r 3 equipped with a flat riemannian metric g that is a symmetric tensor field of rank 0 2 with vanishing curvature denoted by dl 2 in eq 2 1 the riemannian aspect of the newtonian metric of space implies that at each point it can be brought into diagonal form as in 2 1 and that its signature is 1 1 1 in fact it can be globally diagonalized which is equivalent to the assumption or the consequence of the existence of a global family of inertial observers it also implies that without introducing extra structure any pdes describing the gravitational field resulting from given sources must be time independent therefore even if the sources change in time these changes are instantaneously transmitted to the gravitational field g here at each instant of time the gravitational potential is a function on m which satisfies poisson s equation 2 2 2 x gij i j x 4 g x where the gij are components of the inverse metric the symbol denotes the uniquely associated metric compatible torsion free covariant derivative and i j 1 2 3 denote spatial indices with repeated indices taken to imply a summation over them einstein summation convention the term x denotes the mass density at the considered point x in space and g is newton s constant as mentioned above the riemannian structure of space implies infinite speed of propagation and explicitly excludes the possibility of gravitational radiation in special relativity one re examines physical laws in the context of a combined but fixed space time geometry the fixed character of the metric shares its nature with the newtonian case but the metric is lorentzian 2 3 ds 2 c 2 dt 2 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 with c the speed of light here the ds 2 is simply conventional notation as the metric is not positive definite its signature is 1 1 1 1 this approach allows essentially without additional structure to build covariant pdes which are hyperbolic in nature and therefore imply a finite speed of propagation bounded by c intuitively this opens the room for the existence of radiation such as in the theory of electromagnetism 4 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri despite their fundamentally different approaches to space and time newtonian physics and special relativity share an important common feature their geometry is fixed and in particular flat that is there is a fixed arena space or space time where events take place the flatness property can be characterized in a number of ways the riemann tensor vanishes identically at every point of the manifold or equivalently any vector parallel transported along any closed loop returns to itself examples of intrinsically non flat two dimensional riemannian manifolds are spheres while cylinders are intrinsically flat despite being embedded in a curved way in r 3 in order to reconcile gravity with special relativity in gr these conditions need to be relaxed and space time is intrinsically curved and dynamical as a consequence there is in general no notion of preferred observers the most natural object that describes this type of space time is a lorentzian manifold m g that is a four dimensional differentiable manifoldm endowed with a non degenerate symmetric rank 0 2 tensor field g g dx dx on m whose signature is 1 1 1 1 as in 2 3 the space time m g is required to satisfy the equations that einstein postulated in 1915 known as einstein s field equations 2 4 r 1 2 rg 8 g c 4 t where r is the ricci curvature tensor r its scalar r r g t is the stress energy momentum tensor of any matter fields present greek letters are typically used for space time indices 0 1 2 3 and a sum over repeated indices is implicitly assumed equation 2 4 has in the vacuum case t 0 as expected the minkowski metric 2 3 as a solution however it also has other non trivial solutions such as black holes in particular with emission of gravitational energy in the form of waves as described throughout this article what is perhaps less commonly known is that einstein and hilbert were in contact throughout the period that einstein completed the theory of gr leading to an historical priority dispute in fact on 20 november 1915 five days before einstein presented his final form of the field equations to the prussian academy of sciences hilbert submitted an article in which he formulated the gravitational field equations in terms of a coordinate invariant variational principle based on what is now called the hilbert action 94 2 5 s g c 4 16 g m r g g d 4 x where g is the determinant of the metric coefficients g if one computes the functional derivative of s with respect to g computing its first variation the euler lagrange system 2 4 in the vacuum case is obtained the right hand side of 2 4 is obtained by adding to 2 5 a matter term smatter m lmatter g d 4 x the first variation of which leads to t 2 smatter g in 2 4 although a closer analysis revealed that the first proof of hilbert s paper did not contain the explicit form of einstein s field equations in terms of the ricci tensor and its trace 58 144 it is hilbert s work that laid the foundations for the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations of gr the emergence of gravitational wave science 5 a free test particle or falling observer in gr follows a straight trajectory in space time with respect to its geometry namely a geodesic if is such a trajectory with tangent t then 2 6 t t 0 that is the tangent to the worldline of the observer is parallel transported along itself in a local coordinate system x eq 2 6 constitutes a set of four ordinary differential equations 2 7 d 2 x d 2 dx d dx d where are the christoffel symbols generated by the metric and any affine parametrization of the geodesic from the form of 2 6 there is one and only one geodesic locally going through any point of space time with a given direction if all geodesics have global solutions for the space time is said to be geodesically complete however the physically most interesting space times in gr such as the ones describing the gravitational collapse of a star or the expanding universe we live in can be shown to be geodesically incomplete according to the famous singularity theorems by penrose and hawking despite recent advances a problem which is still open is to prove that curvature invariants diverge along such incomplete geodesics yielding a more satisfactory characterization of space time singularities the fact that gr can be formulated as a geometrical theory has a conceptu ally beautiful consequence it implies that the laws of physics are invariant under any diffeomorphism of the space time manifold m this in turn implies that the physical laws have precisely the same form in any local coordinate system gen eral covariance whereas in newton s theory and special relativity the laws are only invariant among inertial constant relative velocity systems the geometry of space time is built into the covariant derivative associated with the metric which defines the curvature tensor the presence of curvature manifests itself in a non zero acceleration between neighboring geodesics geodesic deviation poisson s equation 2 2 and newton s law for the motion of a test particle in a given grav itational field are recovered from einstein s field equations 2 4 and the geodesic equation 2 6 in the limit of weak gravitational fields and slow motion 3 gravitational waves early on gr explained with no free parameters several anomalous behaviors within newton s theory of gravity such as the precession of the perihelion of mer cury 1 from this initial success of the theory focus shifted to whether the field equations 2 4 allowed for non singular solutions which carried physical energy in the form of gravitational waves gws and what exactly would be meant by that in 1916 einstein published a paper predicting the existence of gws 72 by analyzing the weak field regime of his field equations in which the gravitational field is linearized around the flat space time minkowski metric given in 2 3 in modern language taking a smooth one parameter family of solutions g of the field equations 2 4 with corresponding family of stress energy momentum tensor t such that g 0 and t 0 0 for 0 the linearization of 1 see 162 for a review on the status of experimental tests of gr 6 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri einstein s field equations can be written as the following constrained wave system cf section 5 2 3 1 16 g c 4 0 here c 1 t 2 2 x 2 y 2 z is the wave operator with respect to the flat space time derivative and d d g g 0 d d t 0 are the first variations of g g and t therefore the linearized equa tions admit wave like solutions which propagate at the speed of light in the region where the source is zero 0 can be written as superpositions of simple plane wave solutions exploiting the coordinate freedom such plane waves can be expressed as given here for the case of propagation in the z direction 3 2 dx dx h ct z dx 2 dy 2 2 h ct z dxdy with two functions h and h parametrizing the two polarizations of the wave in these coordinates known as the tt gauge the effect of each gw polarization is to contract fractionally the proper distance along one axis while expanding it along the other these axes being x y for h and axes rotated by 45 with respect to x y for h in other words the gws do not affect the trajectories of freely falling particles 2 but change the distances that can be measured between them for instance by exchanging pulses of light see e g 119 in 1918 einstein was able to write albeit with a mistaken factor of 1 2 later corrected by eddington the celebrated quadrupole formula for the emission of gws by a non self gravitating system in slow motion 73 3 3 hjk 2 g c 4 r i jk t r c tt where i jk denotes the second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment and tt the projection to the transverse traceless tt frame r is distance and t is time so that t r c is the retarded time for decades it was not clear whether these waves in the metric of space time had any physical significance to begin with it was thought that they might be a purely coordinate artifact at the time and for several decades subsequent the concept of covariance and coordinate invariants had not fully penetrated the minds of relativists the concept of a black hole was similarly an idea that was difficult to come to terms with as discussed in section 6 second whether gws could be defined in the full non linear regime in a theory where space time itself is dynamic waves with respect to what was not at all clear third it was not known whether it was even possible that there could be non pathological solutions to the field equations that would admit the existence of such waves fourth that any such waves could interact with other forms of energy in a precise measurable way was unknown finally whether devices could be designed and built to actually directly detect these waves seemed like science fiction 2 the converse is true in the laboratory gauge where the gws act as forces that modify the trajectories while proper distances between them follow the unperturbed lorentzian metric the emergence of gravitational wave science 7 in fact einstein himself had his own doubts and radically changed his position at times these fascinating developments have been researched and documented by daniel kennefick 110 in 1934 einstein and nathan rosen based on an exact solution to the full non linear field equations concluded that the theory did not allow for non singular solutions with gws carrying energy they submitted their manuscript do gravitational waves exist to physical review with a critical referee report now known from persistent historical research done by kennefick to have been from cosmologist howard percy robertson a report written with exquisite detail and in a very short time einstein replied with a remarkably strong yet not so well known quote dear sir we mr rosen and i had sent you our manuscript for publi cation and had not authorized you to show it to specialists before it is printed i see no reason to address the in any case erroneous comments of your anonymous expert on the basis of this incident i prefer to publish the paper elsewhere respectfully albert einstein robertson later met leopold infeld einstein s new research assistant infeld in turn exchanged with einstein who had submitted his paper by then to another journal he never submitted a paper to physical review again apparently after his resubmission to another journal einstein had also realized or convinced himself of the flaws in the original manuscript as had rosen while in russia who had reached einstein by mail about it but apparently did not manage to do so in time the main flaw had been seeking for plane gw solutions which turned out to be singular because the proper interpretation was that they actually corresponded to cylindrical waves einstein radically revised the paper before returning the galley proofs in par ticular he changed its title to on gravitational waves 74 robertson wrote to john torrence tate the editor of physical review at the time you neglected to keep me informed on the paper submitted last sum mer by your most distinguished contributor but i shall nevertheless let you in on the subsequent history it was sent without even the correction of one or two numerical slips pointed out by your ref eree to another journal and when it came back in galley proofs was completely revised because i had been able to convince him in the meantime that it proved the opposite of what he thought you might be interested in looking up an article in the journal of the franklin institute january 1937 p 43 and comparing the conclu sions reached with your referee s criticisms the telling of this story is not meant to undermine einstein s great physical intuition but on the contrary to highlight the level of subtlety in making sense of what gravitational radiation means in a theory of space time itself a meaning that it might now be taken for granted as always understood also in some fairness to einstein at the time papers in germany were not peer reviewed and it was also a rather new practice in physical review still robertson was right the discussion of the concept of gravitational radiation continued for several decades as an example of the acknowledged level of confusion the interested 8 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri reader can go through the proceedings of the second conference organized by the international committee on general relativity and gravitation to later become the international society on general relativity and gravitation a seminal and pivotal meeting that took place in chapel hill in 1957 einstein passed away a few months before the first conference gr 0 which took place in bern in 1955 the conference resulted in standard proceedings but also a report for the air force 7 which had sponsored the meeting an interesting story by itself the report has summaries of many of the discussions which took place at the conference as an example of the discussion on the significance of gws john archibald wheeler himself is quoted as having said during that meeting how one could think that a cylindrically symmetric system could radiate is a surprise to me it is now known that it can the whole topic of gws was finally put on firm grounds in the sixties after extensive work by bondi van der burg metzner sachs and penrose among others as it turns out it is possible to provide an unambiguous that is coordinate invariant definition of gravitational radiation for asymptotically flat space times those which approach the flat minkowski metric along outgoing null geodesics in a suitable way asymptotic flatness captures the concept of space times from isolated or bounded sources for a review see 79 4 early searches for ripples in space time from the experimental side in 1969 joseph weber announced direct observation of gws through bar detectors 159 unfortunately these results could never be duplicated by other groups in spite of several efforts such must have been the perceived potential of such a claimed discovery that a gravimeter was sent to the moon with the hope of detecting modes of the moon excited by gws 9 notwith standing the inability of other groups to reproduce his results and the nsf cutting his funding in 1987 weber continued to work with bar detectors with essentially no funding until his death in 2000 with the conviction that he had detected not just one but many events despite a wide consensus that his measurements did not correspond to gws he is recognized as the pioneer of the field of direct gw detec tion the sociologist harry collins makes interesting observations about scientific interactions in the gw community and in particular the circumstances around weber s work 54 in 1974 russell hulse and joseph taylor jr discovered the binary pulsar psr b 1913 16 105 whose orbit was later shown by taylor and joel weisberg to shrink in remarkable agreement with the emission of gravitational radiation as predicted by einstein s quadrupole formula 149 this discovery which led to a nobel prize in 1993 for hulse and taylor was the first clear if indirect demonstration of the exis tence of gws in fact the precise timing analysis of psr b 1913 16 and of other similar pulsars reflects and demonstrates a broader range of general relativistic corrections which are computed in the post newtonian approximation 29 this is an umbrella term for updating newton s equations perturbatively using a va riety of series expansions most notably with respect to the dimensionless source velocity v c the emergence of gravitational wave science 9 5 from the curvature of space time to partial differential equations being the description of a deterministic process one expects that einstein s equations 2 4 can be cast into two sets one possibly constraining the initial configurations which are compatible with the theory and another one describing their evolutions this is indeed what occurs in other physical systems such as maxwell s equations of electromagnetism where the electric e and magnetic fields b in the absence of external charges and currents are constrained to have vanishing divergence e 0 b while their evolution is determined by the laws of ampe re and faraday t e b t b e as we discuss next einstein s field equations can be split in a similar way however although despite their apparent simplicity as written in 2 4 their formulation as a cauchy problem leads to a rather complicated and subtle set of elliptic and hyperbolic equations which are arithmetically expensive to solve for numerically and which have given rise to rich mathematical developments we touch on just a few of these developments which are relevant for this article 5 1 the 3 1 decomposition of space time the formulation of einstein s field equations as a cauchy problem requires breaking general covariance by introducing a foliation of space time by three dimensional hypersurfaces which are typically chosen to be space like that is with a riemannian intrinsic geometry such a foliation is equivalent to the choice of a global time coordinate t on the space time manifold whose level sets the constant time slices are three dimensional space like hypersurfaces t furthermore when formulating the problem as a pde spatial coordinates xi within each time slice have to be chosen clearly these coordinate choices are highly non unique and a good choice which is problem dependent has been one of the main challenges in the history of mathematical and numerical relativity this matter is further complicated by the fact that the geometric properties of space time are not known before actually solving the field equations once a foliation and the spatial coordinates have been chosen the metric can be decomposed in the following 3 1 form 5 1 g gij dx i idt dxj jdt 2 dt 2 with i j 1 2 3 and where gij describes the components of the induced metric on t where i are components of the shift vector and is the lapse the lapse is a positive function which only depends on the choice of the time coordinate t its spatial gradient determines the acceleration a of the observers through the relation a d log where d denotes the induced connection on t the shift determines the velocity of the observers with constant spatial coordinates xi with respect to the normal observers those moving perpendicular to the time slices the 3 1 decomposition of space time is depicted in figure 1 10 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri t 2 t 1 t n figure 1 illustration of the 3 1 decomposition the blue curve is the worldline of an observer with constant spatial coordinates xi its tangent vector t is decomposed into a component parallel to t the shift vector and one that is orthogonal to it the lapse times the normal vector n image courtesy of manuel morales since the lapse and shift are directly related to the choice of coordinates they do not carry any information about the dynamical degrees of freedom of the grav itational field and hence without any further restrictions on the geometry of the foliation or the evolution of the spatial coordinates one does not expect the field equations to provide any evolution or constraint equations for them in other words these functions can be arbitrarily specified usually the most naive choices are not the most appropriate ones for example choosing 1 implies that the normal observers are free falling which might lead to coordinate singularities after a finite time of the evolution due to the focusing effect of the gravitational field once the foliation of space time has been chosen the evolution and constraint equations are obtained by considering the projections of the field equations 2 4 in directions tangent and orthogonal to the space like hypersurfaces t the evolution equations can be cast as a first order system for the first and second fundamental forms associated with the time slices namely the three metric gij and extrinsic curvature kij in vacuum this system reads tgij 2 kij gij 5 2 tkij r 3 ij kkij 2 kilklj didj kij 5 3 with i j 1 2 3 and with r 3 ij the ricci tensor associated with gij k g ijkij the trace of the extrinsic curvature and denoting the lie derivative operator with respect to the shift vector with g and k symmetric tensors this represents 12 the emergence of gravitational wave science 11 equations for the 12 components of g and k with the equations being first order in time and second order in space the four constraint equations on the 12 degrees of freedom are gijr 3 ij k 2 kijkij 0 5 4 djkij dik 0 5 5 and are direct consequences of the gauss codazzi mainardi conditions which are required for a 3 manifold to arise as sub manifold of a 4 manifold if matter and or energy sources are present then the 12 evolution equations 5 2 5 3 and the four constraint equations 5 4 5 5 contain additional terms for this non vaccum setting as anticipated there are no evolution equations for the lapse and shift nor are they restricted by the constraints furthermore it should also be noted that the evolution equations 5 2 5 3 are not unique since they can be modified using the constraints such freedom has proven crucial in mathematical and numerical relativity such as in the formulation of a well posed evolution problem or being able to simulate binary black holes on a computer the evolution and constraint equations can also be derived from a lagrangian through a variational principle one incorporates the lapse and shift i into the hilbert action 2 5 for the space time metric g and then exploits the foliation by splitting the space time action integral into a time action integral of a spatial lagrangian the result is a second order constrained evolution system for the un known spatial metric gij in 1959 arnowwitt deser and misner 20 developed an analogous hamiltonian formulation that produces a first order constrained hy perbolic system for gij and a conjugate momenta ij which is directly related to the extrinsic curvature kij in their formulation the lapse and shift appear as la grange multipliers in the hamiltonian and the constraint equations are produced by varying the hamiltonian with respect to the lapse and shift giving rise to the so called hamiltonian and momentum naming of the two constraint equations 5 4 and 5 5 5 2 the evolution problem the study of the initial value problem for ein stein s equations was pioneered by the french school darmois already in 1927 68 showed existence and uniqueness to the einstein evolution equations for the case of analytic initial data this is too restrictive and at odds with causality though since in the analytic case the initial data would be entirely determined by their value in any arbitrary small open set in 1939 liechnerowicz a student of darmois who had also worked with cartan presented in his ph d thesis a geometric version of gr and of the initial value problem 116 this was followed up in turn by choquet bruhat in 1952 with a proof of local existence and uniqueness of solutions of the initial value problem only assuming that the initial data is smooth enough i e relaxing the analyticity condition 78 this analysis used harmonic coordinates for the space time defined as satisfying 5 6 x 0 0 1 2 3 for which the einstein equations turn into a set of ten quasilinear wave equations in the weak field regime the linearized system reduces precisely to the constrained wave system 3 1 12 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri more recently harmonic coordinates 5 6 have even been used to prove the global non linear stability of the minkowski space time by lindblad and rodnian ski 117 although a somehow stronger result had already been obtained much earlier in the pioneering work by christodoulou and klainerman 45 the fact that harmonic coordinates could be used to establish global results came as a surprise since it had been conjectured early on that in general 5 6 would not yield globally defined coordinates even for space times near the minkowski solution in the strong field regime one does expect harmonic coordinates to eventually break down one possible solution for evading coordinate pathologies is to add low order source terms to eq 5 6 which do not affect the well posedness of the initial value problem a variation of this formulation with source terms in the spirit proposed by helmut friedrich years in advance 80 was one of the ingredients used about 30 years later by frans pretorius to perform the first long term stable simulation of binary black holes 139 there are of course many other ways of posing the initial value problem in gr which are based on different coordinate choices different choices of variables and different ways of using the constraints in order to modify the evolution equations 5 3 the constraint equations the four constraint equations 5 4 5 5 with additional terms included when there are matter and energy sources form an un derdetermined system of equations for the 12 degrees of freedom the components of the symmetric two index tensors g and k similar to the situation in electro magnetism maxwell s equations the constraints within the einstein equations restrict the class of initial data allowed for the evolution problem in gr if the constraint equations are written schematically as c 0 0 1 2 3 then if the evolution equations are satisfied the constraint variables c themselves satisfy a homogeneous evolution equation in the maxwell case this evolution system is trivial t e t b 0 but in gr it involves non trivial speeds of prop agation in the linearized case eq 3 1 together with the fact that 0 imply that c 0 c so that the constraint variables satisfy a wave system on their own therefore if the initial data satisfy the constraints one can show that they are preserved during evolution while this is true for exact solutions of the evolution equations it fails to hold for numerical and other approximations in numerical gr one thus distin guishes between free evolution explicitly solving only the evolution equations and monitoring the growth of constraint violation as the system evolves 24 and con strained evolution explicitly solving both the evolution and constraint equations using techniques such as constraint projection 97 working on initial value problems in gr either proving existence theorems or explicitly producing numerical solutions involves solving the constraint equations the constraints have been studied by mathematicians as a stand alone pde system since the 1940 s 115 this has been one of the research areas in gr that math ematicians have made substantial contributions for example it has been shown that the set of solutions of the constraints forms an infinite dimensional manifold except at a small set of points 76 this implies that for a generic point from the solution set it should be possible to specify a chart of this manifold covering a neighborhood of that point effectively parameterizing the possible initial data the most useful tool for building such parameterizations and for developing a more the emergence of gravitational wave science 13 complete understanding of the constraint equations has been the so called confor mal method the conformal method provides a practical computational procedure for solving the constraint equations and it also forms the basis for other theoretical tools such as gluing techniques see 59 61 46 50 129 and the references therein applications of the conformal method include construction of initial data for black holes 67 binary systems of black holes and stars 57 gravitational radiation 30 and many other models 5 4 the conformal method the conformal method was proposed by lich nerowicz in 1944 115 and then substantially generalized in the 1970 s by york 163 among other authors the method is based on a splitting of the initial data g ij a riemannian metric on a space like hypersurface t and k ij the extrinsic cur vature of the hypersurface t into eight freely specifiable pieces with four re maining pieces to be determined by solving the four constraint equations the pieces of the initial data that are specified as part of the method are a spatial background metric gij on t six free functions and a transverse traceless tensor ij two free functions the two remaining pieces of the initial data to be de termined by the constraints are a scalar conformal factor and a vector potential wi the full spatial metric g ij and the extrinsic curvature k ij are then recovered from wi and the eight specified functions from the expressions g ij 4 gij and k ij 10 ij lw ij 1 3 4 gij this transformation has been engineered so that the constraints 5 4 5 5 reduce to coupled pdes for and wi with standard elliptic operators as their principle parts 8 r 2 3 2 5 ij lw ij 2 7 0 5 7 i lw ij 2 3 6 j 0 5 8 here is the laplace beltrami operator with respect to the background metric gij l denotes the conformal killing operator lw ij iwj jwi 23 kw k gij and k ij g ij is the trace of the entrinsic curvature a detailed overview of the conformal method and its variations may be found in the 2004 survey in ref 22 note that if the hypersurface t has constant mean extrinsic curvature known as the cmc case then the term in 5 8 involving j vanishes and the two equa tions decouple one can first solve 5 8 for w and then plug w into 5 7 and solve for the conformal method was initially used in this decoupled form in numerical relativity cf 56 55 but methods for the coupled system 5 7 5 8 were also developed 57 26 95 136 however mathematical proofs of existence and unique ness of solutions were limited to the decoupled case through 1995 134 106 then in 1996 it was shown 107 that if t has nearly constant mean extrinsic curvature the near cmc case then some cmc results for compact manifolds could be extended to the near cmc case where the equations are coupled between 1996 and 2007 a number of such extensions appeared including results for euclidean 42 and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds 18 the cmc case was also further de veloped including results for open manifolds with interior black hole boundary models 65 123 results allowing for rough data 124 40 and other results in 2008 2009 it was shown 101 102 125 that the near cmc assumption could be avoided if other parts of the data and matter sources present are not too 14 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri large then there exists a solution to 5 7 5 8 for arbitrarily prescribed mean ex trinsic curvature these far from cmc results involved an influx of ideas from pde and geometric analysis including techniques used in mathematical elastic ity 66 while initially for compact manifolds these results have been extended to asymptotically euclidean manifolds 71 99 25 manifolds with asymptotically cylindrical or periodic ends 51 52 compact manifolds with interior black hole boundaries 103 100 69 rough data and metrics 102 25 and other settings more complete overviews of known results through 2011 include 47 60 41 it was initially hoped that the new results that began to appear in 2008 would lead to a solution theory for the non cmc case that would mirror the cmc case however the story has become much more interesting the new existence results did not come with uniqueness and there had already been growing numerical evidence that multiple solutions were possible in the non cmc case 137 23 96 a careful analysis in 2011 126 confirmed this feature of the conformal method in the non cmc case this is quite undesirable for many reasons and it has led to a new influx of tools such as analytic bifurcation theory and closely related numerical continuation methods to try understand what is going on later we will describe some of the interesting mathematical problems this new activity has generated 5 5 the initial boundary value formulation for numerical applications one usually does not consider the evolution problem on the whole spatial domain which is unbounded for typical applications including the modeling of binary black holes one rather works on a truncated domain with artificial inner or outer boundaries where appropriate boundary conditions should be specified see fig ure 2 this leads to the consideration of an initial boundary value problem ibvp for einstein s field equations 2 4 there are several issues that render this ibvp much more difficult than in other physical problems which are in particular due to the presence of constraints with non trivial speeds of propagation the diffeomor phism invariance of the theory and the difficulty of obtaining a local characteriza tion of in and outgoing gravitational radiation in the full non linear theory the latter is directly related to the difficulties relativists had had in defining gws in an unambiguous way see the discussion in section 3 the first well posed ibvp for the full non linear field equations in vacuum was formulated by friedrich and nagy in 1999 81 based on a tetrad description of the gravitational field and the use of the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems with maximal dissipative boundary conditions a generalization of this work to the quasi linear wave system for the metric fields g obtained using harmonic coordinates was given a few years later 114 113 based on heinz otto kreiss strong well posedness concept which consist of an l 2 type estimate which controls both the bulk and the boundary norm of the solution although these results allow one to construct a unique solution of einstein s field equations with given initial and boundary data on a space time region of the form 0 t for t 0 sufficiently small a geometric characterization of the boundary data on the boundary surface t 0 t is still missing and much less is known about global existence of solutions for these problems a further issue is the specification of radiative type boundary condition at t so far this has only been addressed in some detail at the linearized level for a recent review on these topics see 143 the emergence of gravitational wave science 15 t m t 0 t figure 2 illustration of the space time region m 0 t on which the ibvp is posed in numerical relativity one tries to formulate appropriate radiative boundary conditions at the artificial outer boundary t 6 black holes 6 1 stationary black holes and the no hair theorem in late 1915 just a few months after einstein presented the final form of the gravitational field equa tions karl schwarzschild found the first non trivial i e other than the minkowski space time exact solution to the vacuum field equations einstein himself was pos itively surprised that an exact solution could be found at all the circumstances under which this happened are remarkable if not heroic schwarzschild derived his solution while serving for the german army in world war i which he had joined in 1914 stationed on the russian front and suffering from a rare and painful skin disease for which there was no cure at the time during that period he managed to write three papers he died in 1916 two months after having been freed from military duty due to illness the schwarzschild solution is given by 6 1 g 1 2 m r c 2 dt 2 dr 2 1 2 m r r 2 d 2 sin 2 d 2 with m a real constant it is spherically symmetric and static in 1923 the mathe matician george david birkhoff proved that any spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum equations must be static which implies that the schwarzschild metric is the most general spherically symmetric vacuum one note that for r the metric 6 1 converges to the flat space time metric 2 3 written in spherical co ordinates and in this sense g is asymptotically flat for finite r r 2 m the metric 6 1 describes the exterior of a spherically symmetric matter distribution 16 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri i ii iii iv r con st r 0 r 2 m r 2 m t cons t r 0 figure 3 kruskal diagram showing the causal structure of the maximally extended schwarzschild space time in this diagram the angles are suppressed and the radial null geodesics are straight lines with slopes 1 or 1 so that the light cones look the same as in minkowski space time at each point region i corre sponds to the points with r 2 m in the original coordinates t r and region ii is the black hole region regions iii and iv are isometric to regions i and ii and describe respectively another asymptotic flat end which is causally disconnected from region i and a white hole of mass m mc 2 g which is confined to a sphere of radius r due to birkhoff s theorem a spherically symmetric pulsating star cannot emit gravitational radiation the schwarzschild metric as written in 6 1 seems to have a singularity at r 2 m for a long while it was thought that it corresponded to a physical singularity and was referred to as the schwarzschild singularity however it turns out to be a pure coordinate effect with all curvature invariants remaining finite a coordinate change reveals that the metric is perfectly regular at the schwarzschild radius and that the set r 2 m is a null surface describing the event horizon of a black hole objects or signals emanating within the region r 2 m cannot escape to the outside region r 2 m without exceeding the speed of light this is why black holes were given their name their interior cannot be observed in particular by electromagnetic means the global structure and geometric understanding of the schwarzschild space time as a black hole came about in the late fifties from work by physicist david finkelstein and mathematician martin david kruskal see figure 3 therefore schwarzschild s metric was not only the first exact solution to the field equations but also one of major historical significance since it predicted the existence of black holes in the universe the fact that it took almost 50 years to generalize the schwarzschild solution to the physically more realistic rotating case the emergence of gravitational wave science 17 is another manifestation of the complexity of einstein s field equations a rotating generalization depending on the mass parameter m and a new parameter a related to the spin of the black hole was eventually found by mathematician roy kerr in 1963 using a particular ansatz for the metric later an alternative derivation based on a systematic study of stationary axisymmetric solutions of the vacuum einstein equations was provided in cylindrical like coordinates t z the field equations can be reduced to a non linear elliptic equation the so called ernst equation 6 2 1 e 2 ze e 2 ze 2 re e for a complex valued function e of the two variables z once the ernst equation has been solved the metric coefficients g can be obtained from e by quadrature in addition to providing a systematic derivation for the kerr metric the ernst equation has played a prominent role in the uniqueness theorems for rotating black holes under suitable regularity conditions one can prove that the exterior of any stationary asymptotically flat vacuum black hole space time m g with connected non degenerate event horizon is isometric to the exterior of the kerr space time a precise formulation of this uniqueness theorem along with generalizations to non vacuum space times and open problems can be found in 49 the most important open issue is the question of whether or not the analyticity assumption on the space time which is part of the regularity assumptions in the current formulation can be relaxed the physical implication of the uniqueness theorem is that equilibrium vacuum black holes are very simple objects uniquely characterized by their mass and angular momentum more precisely by the kerr space time this leads to the popular statement that black holes have no hair this should be contrasted with the case of rotating neutron stars where one needs to deal with microphysics or equations of state describing the matter much of which is largely unknown which can influence the external structure of space time when two black holes collide it can be shown that they merge and form a new black hole which cannot be further split into two or more black holes one might wonder what the evolution of the final black hole looks like if it decays to a stationary state according to the no hair theorem it has to be a member of the kerr family whether that decay takes place or not is related to the issue of black hole stability described below 6 2 the black hole stability problem another example of the complexity of einstein s field equations is that even after 50 years since the discovery of the kerr solution its stability is still an open mathematical question the kerr stabil ity problem is the following given initial data gij kij which consists of a small perturbation of the data corresponding to a kerr black hole with initial parameters mi ai does this data give rise to a global in time solution which settles down to a kerr black hole with final parameters mf af close to the initial parameters this is not just an academic problem since as described above it is related to the expected final state of the collision of two black holes when searching for gravitational waves through matched filtering as described in section 11 the answer to this question impacts the types of scenarios that should be considered when building catalogs of gw templates despite rapid recent progress towards the stability problem so far only results in the linearized case are available 18 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri in 1957 the first perturbative analysis of the schwarzschild metric was published by regge and wheeler using mode analysis 141 they found that under certain physically inspired boundary conditions at the schwarzschild singularity and at infinity there were no growing modes in 1989 bernard whiting proved mode stability of the kerr solution 161 although mode stability is a necessary condition for stability it does not imply on its own that solutions stay bounded for all time moving beyond mode stability a toy model for black hole stability consists of studying the behavior of the solutions to the wave equation on the fixed background geometry of a schwarzschild or kerr black hole although the coupling with gravity is neglected if there was an instability under these conditions it would be a very strong indication that when such an external field is coupled to gravity the black hole would be unstable in the schwarzschild case in 1987 bernard kay and robert wald showed that for smooth compactly supported initial data on a cauchy surface the solution to the scalar wave equation on a schwarzschild background is uniformly bounded in the exterior region at all times 109 here the key innovation was to allow for the first time for initial data that is not assumed to vanish at the event horizon more recently work by mihalis dafermos igor rodnianski and collaborators considerably strengthened the results by kay and wald by proving decay of solutions to the scalar wave equation for the more general case of a kerr black hole background thus providing the first proof of asymptotic stability 63 regarding gravitational perturbations dafermos holzegel and rodnianski just a few months prior to this writing have presented a proof showing that solutions of the linearized einstein vacuum equations around a schwarzschild black hole arising from regular initial data decay to a linearized kerr metric 62 with the decay being inverse polynomial with respect to the time function of a suitable foliation 7 origins of numerical analysis and numerical relativity in parallel to all these theoretical and mathematical developments in the 1940 s crank and nicholson von neumann and collaborators presented the first stabil ity analyses for numerical solution of time dependent pde problems the early 1950 s were marked by the first pure and applied mathematical computations on the first general purpose electronic computer the eniac 131 including the first weather modeling calculation on an electronic computer by john von neumann and colleagues 37 bryce dewitt is perhaps best known for his work on quantum gravity while at lawrence livermore national lab however where he worked between 1952 and 1955 he became involved in numerical hydrodynamical calculations at the 1957 gr 1 conference dewitt and charles misner suggested the use of computers to numerically solve einstein s equations misner summarized one of the sessions in the following way first we assume that you have a computing machine better than anything we have now and many programmers and a lot of money and you want to look at a nice pretty solution of the einstein equa tions the computer wants to know from you what are the values of g and g t at some initial surface say at t 0 now if you don t watch out when you specify these initial conditions then either the programmer will shoot himself or the machine will blow the emergence of gravitational wave science 19 up in order to avoid this calamity you must make sure that the initial conditions which you prescribe are in accord with certain differential equations in their dependence on x y x at the initial time these are what are called the constraints through the years these concerns proved to be even more serious in practice in numerical simulations of the einstein evolution equations even if solving for the initial constraints exactly or within machine precision the behavior of the evolved solutions under constraint violations which are always present due to finite ma chine precision or truncation errors greatly depends on how the equations are written 111 this was for decades one of the most important problems in numeri cal relativity with devised mechanisms to overcome it such as making the space of constraint satisfying solutions an attractor 32 or using constraint projection based methods 97 in 1957 susan hahn completed her ph d thesis stability criteria for difference schemes 91 under the supervision of mathematician peter lax at nyu that year coincided with von neumann s death who had pioneered the field of numerical methods for pdes and their applications however he did not witness the birth of numerical relativity by 1958 hahn was already working at ibm which eventually turned out to be very useful if not crucial for being able to carry out the first simulations of colliding black holes the reason for this was two fold her expertise on numerically solving pdes and her access to supercomputers at ibm already by the 28 th of january in 1958 at the stevens meeting in new jersey richard lindquist by then a student of wheeler reported on his ongoing work on numerically computing the gravitational radiation emitted from an encounter of two black holes 31 part of the interest was to measure the acceleration between black holes but also trying to shed light by numerical means on the by then ongoing theoretical discussion and research about the concept itself of gws in more modern terms one could rephrase that effort as exploratory analysis the research trajectories of applied mathematician hahn and general relativist lindquist were about to collide 8 the first simulations of head on black hole collisions the first numerical relativity simulation of two black holes was carried out by an applied mathematician and a physicist a synergy between basic and applied math ematics gr and what is now referred to as scientific computing or computational science that would persist over time in 1964 hahn and lindquist published the first super computer simulation of binary black holes 92 evolving misner s initial data for the axisymmetric head on collision of two non spinning black holes initially at rest the evolution equations were written as a first order in time and space system of 12 2 1 2 space di mensions plus time equations at the discrete level second order centered spatial differences and an explicit forward friedrich s scheme for time integration were used this effort constituted not only a historical landmark in the numerical sim ulation of einstein s equation but ref 92 also contains a detailed discussion of numerical stability to an extent that is comparable to work in numerical relativity in the present day in terms of accuracy the 2 dimensional spatial mesh consisted 20 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri of modest 51 51 points the computations were done on an ibm 7090 supercom puter with a reported speed of 4 minutes per time step for a total evolution time of 50 steps these simulations would become unstable very quickly but they consti tuted the foundations of what decades later would become one of the cornerstones of gw science the ibm 7090 is reported to have had the following speed 5 the 7090 can perform any of the following operations in one second 229 000 additions or sub tractions 39 500 multiplications or 32 700 divisions the machine cost around usd 3 000 000 and could be rented for about usd 60 000 a month in com parison as of this writing a relatively high end smartphone is capable of orders of magnitude more flops floating point operations per second for example tests on standard linear algebra benchmarks linpack currently give a few hundred of megaflops millions of flops on one thread to more than a gigaflops billions of flops on some multithread quad core smartphones in the early 70 s dewitt took aim at again numerically tackling the equivalent of the two body problem in gr in a milestone piece of work a student of dewitt larry smarr revisited the axisymmetric head on collision of two black holes his simulations were restricted to relatively small initial separations between the black holes however they were long enough and had enough accuracy to extract for the very first time gws from computer generated space times 148 the aspects which led to such improvements were not just raw computational power but a much better understanding of the problem at the continuum in particular concerning coordinate conditions that would avoid coordinate singularities or difficulties to simulate unphysical small or multi scale structures in conjunction with work by kenneth eppley 75 this effort by smarr is recognized as the second milestone in the numerical simulation of black holes from a chronological perspective as discussed in section 5 5 in the early seven ties kreiss gustafsson and sundstrom introduced a well posedness numerical sta bility analysis framework for time dependent initial boundary value problems 90 however it would not reach the field of numerical relativity until three decades later 9 from numerical relativity to supercomputing remarkably enough as documented in the lax report 6 by 1982 supercom puters in the united states were only available to industry and federal labs in the latter case mostly for classified projects many of the supercomputer simulations by us researchers in academia were carried out in germany for example smarr had used for his black hole simulations supercomputer resources from livermore lab through james ricker wilson who worked on weapon design but also pioneered the field of numerical relativistic hydrodynamics in 1983 smarr submitted to nsf the first unsolicited proposal to be funded by the agency a center for scientific and engineering supercomputing also known as the black proposal for the color of its cover 3 it resulted in the first network of supercomputer centers in the us available to academia the cornell theory cen ter the national center for supercomputer applications ncsa at the university of illinois in urbana champaign the pittsburgh and san diego supercomputer the emergence of gravitational wave science 21 centers and the john von neumann center at princeton the current incarna tion of this first network is xsede extreme science and engineering discovery environment a consortium of 16 supercomputers across the us we have highlighted the role and importance of mathematical theory numerical analysis and computational science on numerical relativity from the birth of the field and throughout the years the black proposal and its award is an example of the opposite a numerical relativist taking the lead in making supercomputing accessible to any academic institution and research area in the us 10 interferometric detectors in 1972 rainer weiss distilled early ideas to measure gws with km scale laser interferometers in a detailed if hard to find technical report 160 the report identified and analyzed the crucial sources of noise their impact and mitigation along with the contributions of ligo co founders ronald drever and kip thorne weiss work provided the foundation for the design of ligo the u s gw observa tory that would be realized in almost identical facilities in hanford washington and livingston louisiana the french italian virgo collaboration implemented a similar design in italy these first generation detectors took data but reported no detections between 2000 and 2010 then both were upgraded to more daring and sensitive advanced configurations advanced ligo performed its first and ultimately successful ob serving run in late 2015 while advanced virgo is as we write in the final stages of commissioning smaller less sensitive interferometers were built in germany geo 600 and japan tama and were operated through the early 2000 s japan is now building its own km scale interferometer kagra india is planning to build a 4 km ligo like infrastructure to house an already built third advanced ligo detector ligo india the primary motivations to build an international network of detectors are to improve the localization of gw sources which is per formed essentially by triangulation to extract information about the polarization of the wave and to provide greater detector uptime ligo like detectors measure gws by using laser interferometry to monitor the differential changes in length along two perpendicular arms as explained in sec tion 3 gws produce a fractional change a strain in the proper distance between freely falling reference masses initially at rest in this case the ligo mirrors since the strain produced at earth by the strongest expected gw sources is of order 10 21 long interferometer arms for ligo 4 km high laser power and extraordinary efforts to avoid any forces on the test masses are required to reach sufficient sensitivity in 1991 congress approved first year funding for ligo in 1992 a detailed de scription of the project was published in science 15 and ligo s sheer size was featured on the front cover figure 4 the virgo project was approved in 1993 by the french centre national de la recherche scientifique cnrs and in 1994 by the italian istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare infn the prospective gw sources for earth based interferometric detectors include compact binary coalescences cbcs pairs of black holes and neutron stars in any combination as we shall discuss in section 11 searches based on matched filtering allow the identification of signals buried well below noise level if their shape is known precisely while post newtonian calculations 29 can handle the early and 22 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri r s s t vr vl 45 paril 112 scale measurements figure 4 big science requires large experiments front cover of the science issue including a description of the funded ligo project 15 intermediate phases of binary inspirals and the particle physics inspired effective one body formalism 34 can provide sufficient precision for the late inspiral and plunge fully non linear numerical simulations of the einstein equations are required to model the final merger and to provide initial conditions for the perturbative relaxation of the final remnant black hole 27 indeed the quasinormal modes of black hole ringdown can be handled analytically but require numerical relativity to be connected to the merger phase the need for accurate gravitational waveforms lent importance and some urgency to the task of modeling black hole and neutron star collisions as well as the resulting gw emission within the field of numerical relativity predicted cbc rates for first generation interferometric detectors had uncer tainties of orders of magnitude extending to very low values 11 so it was not the emergence of gravitational wave science 23 surprising when no detection were reported in fact the discussion of ligo in ref 15 had anticipated this first detector system may discover gws if not experimenters will press forward with detector improvements leading towards ligo s advanced detector goals these improvements are expected to lead to the detection of waves from many sources each year starting around year 2011 ligo and virgo underwent extensive upgrades from their initial configurations to more advanced designs with the goal of increasing sensitivities by an order of magnitude this translates into thousand fold increase in the sensitivity volume and thus in the rate of accessible events advanced ligo s first observing run o 1 took place between september 2015 and january 2016 with further runs planned starting in fall 2016 at progressively higher sensitivities until the limits of the design are reached as of this writing advanced virgo is expected to start taking data at the end of 2016 11 the analysis of gravitational wave detector data from the standpoint of data analysis gws of different nature are searched for using different customized techniques we outline some of these efforts below 11 1 burst gw searches for short unmodeled gw transients in gw lingo bursts such as the waves from core collapse supernovae 82 one first recasts the data in a time frequency representation appropriate to describe the local energy content of the signal such representations find their origin in the short time fourier transform introduced by gabor in 1946 see 53 and 146 for reviews of the steady developments in this field in the time frequency plane a sufficiently loud gw burst appears as a localized cluster of excess power on top of a diffuse background of stationary detector noise search algorithms identify promising clusters normal izing amplitudes by the baseline detector noise at different frequencies and elim inating non stationary detector glitches by way of a coherence constraint among multiple detectors the coherence constraint is formulated in the context of signal reconstruction specifically the gw perturbation tensor introduced in eq 3 2 can be rewritten more generally as 11 1 hij t klxl e ij kl h ct klxl e ij k l h ct klxl where e ij and e ij are the symmetric traceless and transverse e ijk j e ijk j 0 gw polarization tensors and kl describes the direction of propagation of the gw signal or equivalently the sky position of its source the signal registered by detector a then becomes 11 2 ha t d ij ahij t klx l a f a kl h ct klx l a f a kl h ct klx l a where xla describes the position of the detector and the tensor d ij a the orientation of its sensitive axes the projection coefficients f a kl and f a kl are known as antenna patterns the phases of the waveform components h and h are also related under the assumption that the signal is linearly circularly or elliptically polarized given the data recorded by multiple detectors around a bright excess power cluster eq 11 2 sets up the inverse problem for bursts providing the basis 24 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri for estimating the waveforms h and h the gw polarization and the sky location of the source see e g 112 crucially this analysis yields a measure of signal coherence which is used to identify strong detection candidates in practice these principles are implemented in sophisticated software pipelines that emphasize robustness online use i e the processing of detector data as they are collected low latency and source parameter estimation especially of sky lo cation which is crucial to the electromagnetic follow up of gw detections one such burst pipeline first reported gw 150914 as a very significant transient just three minutes after the gw passed the earth a second pipeline confirmed the event after a few hours many details and further references can be found in the gw 150914 burst search companion paper 150 we will discuss at the end of sec 11 3 the assessment of statistical significance of gw candidates in the meantime let us continue our brief review of detection methods 11 2 stochastic gw searches stochastic gw sources include the fossil radia tion from the early universe 119 and the incoherent superposition of individually undetectable waves from compact binary inspirals 142 the random character of this radiation makes it very different than short bursts or frequency coherent chirps from binary inspirals while a stochastic signal will be recorded by a single detector it will be indistinguishable from that instrument s intrinsic noise however thanks to the almost omnidirectional sensitivity of gw detectors closely related stochas tic signals will be recorded by all instruments targeting the same frequency band thus the favored search relies on cross correlating the data of one or more detec tor pairs under the assumption that all other noise sources remain uncorrelated this technique was used as early as 1975 for resonant bar detectors 104 and it was given its current mathematical formalism in 17 building on well established notions in signal processing and probability theory such as spectral estimation and neyman pearson optimal detection see 145 for a textbook treatment in the simplest case of coincident coaligned and identical detectors one may form the product of the two detector outputs s 1 t and s 2 t 11 3 s t 2 t 2 s 1 t s 2 t dt where t is the duration of the observation which we center arbitrarily at t 0 the crucial figure of merit is the signal to noise ratio where is the expectation value of s and is the square root of its variance because the intrinsic noise of the two detectors is uncorrelated depends only on the gws and it integrates to t 2 h with 2 h the total variance of the gw as registered in each instrument 3 by contrast is dominated by intrinsic detector noise since it is the product of two uncorrelated random processes it scales as a random walk 2 t times the integrated product of the two detectors noise spectral densities the larger the the more statistically confident we are that a stochastic gw signal is actually present in the data since scales with t statistical significance is accumulated slowly with longer and longer experiments 3 for interferometric detectors 2 h is 3 h 20 20 2 0 f 3 gw f df with h 0 the hubble constant and gw f 1 cd gw d log f the logarithmic density of the gw energy that isotrop ically bathes the universe in units of critical energy density 17 the emergence of gravitational wave science 25 of course in actual practice things are more complicated most important the product s and therefore the sensitivity of a search are reduced for non coincident and non aligned detector pairs because of the time delay between them detectors respond to instantaneously different if partially correlated wavefronts because of the difference in orientation they register different combinations of polarizations thus the gw strains observed in any two instruments will overlap only partially the reduction in sensitivity is quantified by the overlap reduction function f 77 the function f is unity at f 0 if the detectors are aligned it crosses zero slightly above f c 2 d with d the distance between the detectors and it exhibits a rapidly damped oscillation about zero for higher frequencies the optimal filter s that maximizes is in fact given by a variant of eq 11 3 that takes into account f as well as the spectra of the gw stochastic signal and of detector noise 17 11 3 modeled gw searches for gw transients whose exact shape may be known a priori from theory in the case of gw 150914 the waves from the inspiral merger and ringdown of a black hole binary the reference search involves matched filtering a technique originating in radar applications in the middle of the 20 th century 164 154 the need for accurate waveforms in matched filtering has been a driving moti vation behind the quest for analytical and numerical solutions of gr so it is worth understanding the basic principles of matched filtering in matched filtering one looks for a known signal h t embedded in additive noise so the data can be represented as s t h t n t by computing the signal to template correlation integral 11 4 t 0 s t h t dt t 0 h t h t dt t 0 n t h t dt here h t is the matched filter which is obtained by applying a noise weighting linear operator to h t more about this below for the purpose of this illustration we can take h t h t which is appropriate for white noise 4 again the ratio in this case for the variable is a measure of statistical confidence that the signal h t is present in the data the two integrals on the right hand side of eq 11 4 correspond to and respectively the first accumulates as h 20 t where h 0 is the characteristic amplitude of the signal h t the second grows only as 0 t 1 2 n 0 h 0 in random walk fashion where n 0 is the characteristic amplitude of the noise and 0 is related to the noise timescale e g for band limited white noise 0 1 fmax since t 0 1 2 h 0 n 0 we see that the matched filter allows detection even if h 0 n 0 is significantly less than one the enhancement is again proportional to t more formally the random variable is used as a detection statistic 145 as follows in the presence of noise alone the probability distribution pn is dictated by the properties of noise in the presence of noise and signal the probability distribution pn h becomes displaced to larger values if we measure a sufficiently large we can conclude with high confidence that the signal h is present in the data to quantify that confidence we set a false alarm probability pfa and obtain 4 white noise is a random signal with constant power spectral density in applications that involve discretely sampled data it is useful to think of white noise as a sequence of uncorrelated random variables with zero mean and finite variance 26 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri the threshold tr such that the cumulative probability pn tr pfa in other words if we claim a detection whenever tr we are only wrong pfa of the times conversely this scheme results in falsely dismissing a fraction pn h tr pfd of true signals the matched filter is the optimal linear filter in the sense that it minimizes pfd for a fixed pfa the simplified picture that we have just drawn describes a search for a signal of known shape occurring at a known time the generalization to unknown source parameters involves trying out many different signal shapes for some parameters the variation of the signal can be handled with analytical techniques such is the case of overall amplitude initial phase and merger time of inspiral signals all of which map into simple transformations of the filter h in the fourier domain see e g 120 to tackle the variation due to other parameters such as the component masses in a binary inspiral it is necessary to evaluate the detection statistic across a bank of signal templates the templates must be placed strategically across the space of source parameters densely enough that no real signal is missed because its phase evolution matches no template in the bank sparsely enough that the computation remains feasible this is an interesting geometrical problem that can be formulated in terms of differential geometry 135 ad hoc tilings 19 as well as lattice based and randomized sphere coverings 140 130 if we filter detector data against a template bank we need to raise the detection threshold to take into account the fact that we are running multiple independent experiments each of which can result in a false alarm 5 for the advanced ligo search that led to the detection of gw 150914 as a modeled transient 250 000 templates were placed across parameter space with each component mass ranging from 1 to 100 solar masses 152 the other immediate generalization is to colored noise under the restrictive but enabling assumption that the instrument noise n t is gaussian and station ary its sampling distribution is determined entirely by its correlation function or equivalently by its power spectral density p f see e g 119 to wit 11 5 pn n exp 2 0 n f n f p f df exp n n 2 where n f is the fourier transform of n t n f is its complex conjugate and p f is defined by the ensemble i e noise realization average n f n f f f p f 2 the power spectral density can be estimated empirically from a nearby stretch of data under the assumption that it is not affected significantly by the presence of gw see 16 for the details of a sophisticated implementation it is straightforward to show that in the presence of colored gaussian noise the optimal matched filter can be written in the frequency domain as h f h f p f 164 in fact while the assumption that noise is stationary and gaussian is pervasive in the theoretical development of gw data analysis methods it cannot be trusted to establish the true false alarm probability of detection candidates since interfero metric detectors are neither stationary nor gaussian instead the background rate of noise induced false alarms is determined empirically for instance in searches that require coincident candidates in multiple detectors the background is mea sured by artificially sliding the time axis of the data in one detector and then 5 the actual number of independent trials is difficult to control analytically because of partial template correlations and is best determined by experiment the emergence of gravitational wave science 27 performing the coincidence analysis any resulting joint candidates are necessarily the product of noise alone this very procedure established that the false alarm probability of gw 150914 was much less than one in 203 000 years 14 11 4 parameter estimation neverthless eq 11 5 is the basis of the proba bilistic treatment of detection and parameter estimation for gw signals of known shape this is with good reason since detected signals are likely to be found in well behaved noise furthermore the assumption of gaussian noise can be validated a posteriori together with the assumption of additive noise again that the detector data s t equals gw signal h t plus instrument noise n t eq 11 5 leads to the likelihood p s h that the data contain a gw signal determined by the parameter vector 11 6 p s h exp s h s h 2 where the product has the same form as in eq 11 5 among the templates h i in a bank the template that results in the largest of eq 11 4 is also the template that maximizes the likelihood p s h if we extend the bank to a continuous family over parameter space we obtain the maximum likelihood point estimate of the source parameters as 119 11 7 ml maxloc p s h the error of this estimate is quantified by the fisher information matrix f h h ml where the denote partial differentiation with respect to the source parameters 155 specifically for sufficiently strong signals the error vector ml true is distributed normally with parameter covariance given by f 1 for weaker signals detected near the threshold the story is more complicated 155 156 the probability distribution of the errors refers to a hypothetical infinite sequence of experiments each with a different noise realization that result in the same ml a construct typical of frequentist a k a classical statistics in fact the gw data analysis community has by now largely transitioned to bayesian methods for parameter estimation 88 this happened for several rea sons to distill maximum information out of the data we will have from rare at least initially detections to incorporate prior information from astrophysical the ory or non gw observations and to draw physical conclusions jointly from mul tiple sources e g about astronomical populations 13 or violations of general relativistic predictions 151 in this respect gw analysts have anticipated a broader movement in the larger astronomical community 118 in bayesian inference 88 one thinks of a gw observation in the data s t as updating the prior probability density p of the source parameters into their posterior density by way of bayes theorem 6 11 8 p s p s h p p s h p d 6 mathematically bayes theorem is nothing more than a restatement of the law of compound probabilities but the name carries the import of its interpretation in terms of rational and axiomatized degree of belief 108 28 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri the bayesian view is that the posterior taken as a whole quantifies our informed belief about the signal it is still possible to distill the posterior into point esti mators such as conditional means and simple measures of uncertainty such as parameter covariances the denominator in eq 11 8 is the bayesian evidence p s a measure of the overall credibility of the data as having been generated ac cording to the mathematical model encoded in the prior and likelihood a bayesian analyst may compare the evidence of different models to decide between them for instance between template families representing black hole vs neutron star bina ries or even between a signal model vs a noise only model which sets up a bayesian detection scheme 145 in most cases the posterior must be explored and integrated numerically this is a difficult problem because of the moderately high dimensionality of parameter space all schemes that involve a structured walkthrough of parameter space e g along multidimensional grids require huge computational resources the break through in bayesian computation took place in the 1990 s when statisticians began to apply markov chain monte carlo to inference see e g 86 for an introduction the technique originates with the seminal paper by metropolis the rosenbluths and the tellers 132 the idea is to explore statistical ensembles in stochastic fashion on a computer crucially sampling states directly from the target distribution 7 instead of choosing configurations randomly then weighting them with exp e kt we choose configurations with a probability exp e kt and weight them evenly 132 this becomes possible thanks to a clever scheme the metropolis rule later gener alized in many ways and directions 86 to conditionally accept or reject each step of a random walk in such a way that the trajectory approaches asymptotically the distribution of interest whether exp e kt or the bayesian posterior markov chain monte carlo was first applied to gw searches by christensen and meyer in 1998 43 its current implementation in the ligo software library 157 relies on gw signal specific customizations of a few broadly applicable modern variants of monte carlo such as parallel tempering 83 and nested sampling 147 see instead 87 for a broader review of the state of the art in bayesian computation in the case of gw 150914 these techniques were able to confidently determine the masses of the component black holes the distance and sky location of the system and much more 153 and even to test key predictions of gr for such a binary 151 12 numerical relativity in the 21 st century driven to a large extent by the search for direct detection of gws a binary black hole grand challenge alliance gca was funded by the nsf from 1993 to 1998 involving 40 researchers at 10 institutions its goal was to develop mathematical and numerical techniques along with a high performance computing hpc infras tructure specifically tailored to the binary black hole problem that would allow stable simulations of generic collisions of binary black holes in particular to move from head on collisions to the more general case of black holes which inspiral around each other while emitting gws their orbits shrinking and eventually merging to form a new black hole which assuming non linear stability of black holes under 7 the reason this is so important is that for most distributions of interest a state selected randomly across parameter space is likely to have very small probability thus contributing very little to statistical integrals and distributions the emergence of gravitational wave science 29 large perturbations section 6 2 it should decay to a member of the kerr solution according to the no hair theorem section 6 1 the gca started a number of efforts which continued well beyond the funding of the project regarding manifestly hyperbolic formulations of the einstein equations methods for extracting gravitational radiation from numerical space times evolu tion approaches ranging from cauchy to characteristic formulations hpc tools for large scale parallel computations and visualization and adaptive numerical tech niques the latter was pioneered by matt choptuik in his studies of gravitational collapse which led to his discovery of critical behavior 38 the first attempts at black hole excision were made whereby one uses the fact that the region inside a black hole is causally disconnected from the outside to excise it from the computational domain practical approaches to outer boundary conditions were also explored although the mathematical formulation as an initial boundary value problems and its well posedness was not carefully addressed until the 2000 s section 5 5 from a physical point of view the head on collision of misner s initial data was revisited in great detail though still with limited initial separations a 1998 summary of the gca by its pi richard matzner can be found in 121 after the gca or by the end of it a systematic mathematical analysis of the einstein equations as an initial boundary value problem was initiated earlier in section 5 5 we discussed some of this work including 81 114 113 at the same time a thorough numerical analysis was being done to develop more accurate and reliable numerical methods for the einstein equations both activities involved an increasing level of interaction between numerical relativists from the physics community and specialists in numerical analysis and pdes from the mathematics community this interaction happened by design rather than accident due to the forsight of a number of people working in these three areas starting around 2002 a number of workshops were held with the specific goal of bringing together researchers from all three communities these began with a hot topics workshop on numerical relativity held at the ima in june 2002 followed by a year long mathematical numerical relativity visitor program at caltech from 2002 2003 and continuing for some time into 2003 2004 these led to additional workshops focussing on both mathematical and numerical relativity organized by some of the participants of these first two meetings these included an aim stanford relativity workshop in 2003 an ipam ucla geometric flows workshop in 2003 a second ima workshop in 2004 a banff birs numerical relativity workshop in 2005 and a mathematical relativity workshop visitor program at the isaac newton institute at cambridge in 2005 minisymposia were also organized at larger mathematics meetings that involved speakers from both the mathematics and numerical relativity communities including sessions at the miami waves workshop in 2004 various subsets of the authors of this article attended all of these meetings and met for the first time at one of the meetings these interactions helped accelerate the infusion of useful ideas and tools from the mathematics community into numerical relativity for example for some time it had been thought that the simulation of black holes would benefit from advanced high resolution shock capturing methods even in the absence of matter fields how ever it was pointed at the 2002 ima workshop by participants that in the vacuum case the einstein equations are linearly degenerate and shocks are not expected 30 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri that is while the solution is finite it is expected to be smooth therefore on the contrary one expects high order or spectral methods to be best suited for such cases and indeed they became dominant in the 2000 s for example 8 high resolution simulations of single black holes using spectral methods showed that in stabilities present in some simulations would not be ruled out by more powerful supercomputers but a deeper understanding of the continuum properties of the field equations was needed during the intensive interactions between researchers during this period a number of known numerical analysis techniques were refined and tuned for the einstein equations and some completely new techniques were de veloped to handle the unique problems that arise with numerical simulation of the einstein equations by 2005 what had seemed in 2002 to be an almost intractible simulation problem was starting to crack in 2005 at the banff international research station in canada numerical rel ativity meeting pretorius reported the first set of long term simulations of binary black holes inspiraling around each other merging and decaying to a stationary black hole with no signs of growing instabilities and with the accuracy to extract waveforms from the numerical space time 139 one of the key insights in this breakthrough was a previously proposed constraint damping mechanism 32 89 originally stemming from computational fluid dynamics and quoted as privately proposed to relativists by heinz otto kreiss in ref 32 soon thereafter two groups reported at the same meeting in nasa goddard the independent discovery of a very different approach to produce equally stable and accurate long term simulations based on the bssn formulation of the einstein equations 21 35 this approach has since then been coined moving punctures because the key ingredient is to use coordinate conditions which allow the black hole punctures to move across the computational domain punctures do not repre sent the location of black holes instead they represent a compactification of each infinity region in non trivial topological constructions of multiple black holes see for example 33 in 1987 93 thorne had predicted that for black hole collisions numerical relativity seems likely to give us within the next five years a detailed and highly reliable picture of the final coalescence and the wave forms it produces including the dependence on the hole s masses and angular momenta compari son of the predicted wave forms and the observed ones will constitute the strongest test ever of general relativity it actually took about two more decades that is around four more decades after the original simulations of hahn and lindquist to get to the point in which any single configuration could be systematically simulated the long quest to be able to simulate binary black holes came just in time for the new era of gw science in particular numerical simulations have been critical in developing semi analytical and phenomenological models of the gw emission from cbcs a recent review of numerical relativity as a probe

announcement provided details about the first direct detection of gws from a binary black hole coalescence in data collected by the two advanced 32 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri ligo detectors on september 14 2015 shortly after the detectors were turned on the nsf press release is available at 4 the event was named gw 150914 analysis of the data showed that the waves were generated by the coalescence of two black holes with masses 29 and 36 times that of our sun inspiraling and then merging to form a final kerr black hole of 62 solar masses the measured signal was rather short 0 2 s covering the final 8 cycles of the coalescence the detection was unambiguous with a measurable significance greater than 5 for a false alarm rate of less than one event per 203 000 years this was an upper limit corresponding to the empirical background that could be explored using time slides the actual significance was arguably much higher it was reported by the lsc collaboration that 50 million cpu core hours on recent high end conventional cores were devoted to the data analysis of the signal the production discovery analyses were run on dedicated ligo data grid clusters xsede and the open science grid in particular on comet at the san diego supercomputer center and stampede at the texas advanced computing center the signals recorded at the two ligo sites showed exquisite agreement and were observed with a combined signal to noise ratio of 24 the time delay between the sites was 7 milliseconds and the event released the energy equivalent of three solar masses into gws with a peak luminosity 3 1056 erg s greater than the visible light emitted continuously by the rest of the universe as kip thorne commented it is by far the most powerful explosion humans have ever detected except for the big bang the ligo and virgo collaborations had agreed that a detection would be pre sented publicly only after peer review and indeed a letter describing gw 150914 appeared in the physical review on february 11 14 the excitement was such that as soon as the press conference began the physical review letters webpage was overwhelmed by more than 10 000 downloads per minute to the point that it remained inaccessible until the journal could add more servers several companion papers covering many complementary aspects of the detection and of its theoreti cal consequences were also released on that day see papers ligo org for links issue 8 of the ligo magazine 10 presents a collection of articles about ligo the discovery of gw 150914 its implications and the future of gw astronomy on june 15 2016 the ligo and virgo collaborations announced a second highly statistically significant detection of gws from the coalescence of two black holes 12 this signal named gw 151226 was recorded by the two ligo detectors on december 26 2015 toward the end of the first advanced ligo observation run o 1 the black holes responsible for the signal are lighter than for gw 150914 with masses 14 and 8 times that of the sun although uncertainties are large the signal was weaker than gw 150914 but it lasted longer 1 s and 55 cycles and it ended at a higher frequency within the sensitive detector band again the mea sured significance was 5 and the true significance arguably much higher ligo plans to start a second observation run o 2 of six months with slightly higher sensitivity in fall 2016 to be joined by virgo soon thereafter with increasing sensitivities and longer runs the expectation is that detections will become almost routine up to tens per year and the hope that black hole binaries will be joined papers ligo org the emergence of gravitational wave science 33 in the catch by other systems especially those involving neutron stars which could have observable electromagnetic counterparts 14 opportunities for further mathematical developments gw science faces a number of challenges in mathematics computational science and data analysis in addition to ongoing work in instrumentation physical and astrophysical modeling and in developing new ways to explore the universe using gw detectors we mention just a few of these challenges to close this article highlighting not only past synergies between the mathematical sciences and gw science but also what might lay ahead the most interesting challenges in the statistical theory of gw detection and parameter estimation revolve on the astrophysical and theoretical interpretation of observed gw sources for instance how does one use a catalog of cbc obser vations to constrain populations of binaries across the universe or the physical processes that led to their formation what is the best statistical formulation to test gr through cbc signals how can we robustly take into account the system atic uncertainties due to the calibration of detectors imperfect waveform modeling and other perturbations because extracting physical parameters from individual observed signals requires accurate theoretical waveforms as a function of the parameters the field faces a ma jor obstacle in the curse of dimensionality both for the forward problem modeling parameters to waveforms and inverse problem inference signals to parameters for binary black hole waveforms even under the simplifying assumption of negligi ble orbital eccentricity modeling involves an 8 dimensional parameter spaces two masses and two spin vectors while inference requires exploring a 15 dimensional parameter space that includes also explicit signal presentation parameters such as source position orientation and merger time now finding solutions to the einstein equations is numerically intensive hun dreds of thousand of hours of computing time for the final phase of inspiral merger ringdown signals which cannot be modeled analytically with sufficient accuracy even with the largest supercomputers available at the time of writing the full pa rameter space of interest cannot be surveyed directly so ligo analysts have relied on semi analytical phenomenological waveforms calibrated to a small number of numerical simulations 153 techniques based on state of the art reduced order modeling for parameterized systems see 28 36 and references therein are also being explored and commissioned in this case one directly interpolates among a small number of numerical waveforms without the intermediate step of developing a parameterized phenomenological representation once waveforms are available reliable statistical inference requires sophisticated sampling schemes to explore pa rameter space efficiently both the forward and inverse problems have inherent sources of uncertainty from modeled and unmodeled sources of noise numerical errors in simulations approxi mations in initial and boundary conditions and even the possibility of corrections to einstein s theory of gravity moreover in these theoretical studies instrumental noise is usually assumed as in many other fields to be gaussian and stationary which is almost never the case while gw science has developed both general and ad hoc techniques to deal with these uncertainties useful approaches may come 34 michael holst olivier sarbach manuel tiglio and michele vallisneri from the field of uncertainty quantification which relies on different tools and formulations than bayesian inference there are two very active and somewhat distinct research programs in the mathematics community that focus on developing a more complete analytical un derstanding of two different aspects of the einstein equations the first of these programs involves primarily open problems associated with the solution theory for the evolution equations there are still a number of important remaining issues in addition to the ones we have already mentioned in this article for example apart from proving that kerr black holes are stable under small perturbations one wishes to have a complete mathematical description for the gravitational collapse of matter to form a black hole here the holy grail consists in proving the cosmic censorship conjecture which essentially states that the cauchy evolution of regu lar asymptotically flat initial data should not produce any naked singularities in other words singularities may form but they must be hidden inside a black hole so far due to groundbreaking work by christodoulou a fairly complete picture has emerged in certain spherically symmetric models including the collapse of a dust ball and the critical collapse of a massless scalar field however the general case still remains widely open for more details and recent developments see the introduction in christodoulou s monograph 44 the second of these research programs involves primarily open problems as sociated with solution theory for the einstein constraint equations one of the major activities in this program has been to complete the theory for the conformal method and this is currently undergoing rapid development it was hoped that the new analysis frameworks developed in 2008 that led to the first far from cmc existence results would lead to a complete solution theory however after it was shown in 2011 126 that multiple solutions are possible in the non cmc case a number of additional techniques were developed that have led to a more refined un derstanding of the conformal method in 64 scaling and blowup techniques were developed for the conformal method giving a new approach to obtain non cmc existence results 84 85 this was further refined in 133 giving the best character ization to date for multiplicity of general solutions in the non cmc case analytic bifurcation theory and numerical continuation methods are now also being used where possible 158 98 138 48 70 to characterize fold and bifurcation phenom ena in the conformal method these studies could point the way to generalizations of the conformal method such as the drift system 127 128 122 that may provide better parameterizations of the initial data for gr in the truly non cmc setting these are just a few examples many additional synergies including unforeseen ones between mathematics computational science data analysis and gravitational wave science are expected to play crucial roles just as they have over the past 100 years 15 acknowledgments we thank the reviewers as well as
