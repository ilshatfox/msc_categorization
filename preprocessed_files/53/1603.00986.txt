equation fa da u 0 of a connection a and a bundle valued 0 form u 1 the following theorem is true theorem 1 let bo r r 7 be an arbitrary ball centred at the origin for any smooth g 2 structure defined over bo r and any smooth so m bundle s 6 equipped with a hermitian yang mills connection a 0 there exists a g 2 monopole which is defined in a smaller ball and asymptotic to a 0 exponentially at o remark 2 not every singular elliptic equation admits a local solution for example brezis cabre 1 showed that the equation u u 2 1 x 2 does not admit any solution defined near the origin in contrast our theorem says that the singular g 2 monopole equation is always locally solvable in particular for any smooth g 2 structure defined near o it yields a g 2 monopole tangent to the canonical connection on s 6 see 2 and 14 we hope this could help to construct g 2 instantons with point singularities on a closed 7 manifold remark 3 we expect the local solution to be highly non unique there exists a solution whose exponential rate is arbitrarily close to 1 see 11 and the discussion below 4 the monopole equation in g 2 setting first appeared in 4 by donaldson segal for highly related later development on g 2 or other kinds of monopoles instantons we refer the interested readers to the work done by sa earp walpuski 10 walpuski 12 oliveira 6 7 8 9 foscolo 5 charbonneau harland 2 xu 14 and the references therein proof of theorem 1 near o is a small perturbation of o o using a sophisticated version of the rescaling in page 6 9 of 3 we show in the following that theorem 1 is a direct corollary of theorem 1 13 in 13 department of mathematics stony brook university ny usa ywang scgp stonybrook edu 1 http arxiv org abs 1603 00986 v 1 let the coordinate vector of bo r r 7 be v v 1 v 7 all the balls below are centred at o by lemma 3 7 in 11 there exists a linear transfor mation l such that under the new coordinate y lv o is the euclidean g 2 form i e o dy 123 dy 145 dy 167 dy 246 dy 257 dy 347 dy 356 2 it suffices to work under the y coordinate under which is defined in b r 0 for some r 0 0 depending on r and l we bring in the bundle as de fined over s 6 1 the unit sphere and then view it as a bundle over r 7 o pulled back from the natural spherical projection remark 2 3 in 13 the connection a 0 is pulled back to be a g 2 instanton on r 7 o with respect to o we write ijk ijkdy ijk let denote the map x y y from b 1 4 to b 1 4 to the x coordinate exactly as in the previous paragraph we can also pull back the bundles ad and a 0 denoted the same as in y coordinate since they are objects on s 6 they are invariant under let ijk 1 ijk dx ijk 3 1 where ijk is the same as above 3 let c denote c ijk ijk ijk o c 5 y b 14 where c is a proper universal con stant which could be different in various context and c 5 y means the c 5 norm in y coordinate by chain rule we have for any x that kx 1 ijk ijk o x c k for all integer k 1 5 and x b 1 4 x is as below 6 moreover 1 ijk ijk o x ijk ijk o y c when x b 1 4 y b 1 4 therefore o c 5 x b 14 c c 5 x means the c 5 norm in x coordinate 4 we actually have a monopole on b 1 4 of exponential rate arbitrarily close to 1 to see this for any 1 0 choose p 5 2 5 2 such that the condition in definition 2 21 of 13 is satisfied let 0 be small enough with respect to a 0 and p theorem 1 13 in 13 and the rate of convergence given by the proof of it is directly applicable therefore let be large enough such that c 0 2 and 1 4 r 0 2 there exists a monopole a over b 1 4 i e fa g da 0 over b 1 4 g is the metric of 5 2 moreover let 0 be even smaller if necessary by the proof of theorem 1 13 in section 5 of 13 also see definition 2 9 and theorem 5 1 therein a is of exponential rate 1 and order 3 i e x l 1 lx a a 0 x x 1 for any integer l 0 3 6 where x is just the usual norm of x and x is the ordinary derivative of the components of a a 0 under the natural charts as in definition 2 10 of 13 of course here s 6 and a 0 might be trivialized by more than 2 coordinate neighbourhoods but this does not make any difference pulling back both sides of 5 via we obtain fa 4 g da 0 over b 1 4 a a 7 using g da g da g 2 g and 2 g 5 g see remark 4 8 where g is the metric of we obtain fa gda 0 9 the pair a is the monopole we desire since a 0 a 0 as a connec tion see the paragraph above 3 the estimate 6 means y l 1 ly a a 0 y 1 y 1 10 where l is as in 6 and y is as under 6 but in y coordinate since a 0 is smooth on s 6 1 we directly verify by 10 that y l 1 la 0 a a 0 y c 1 y 1 11 where c is a constant depending only on a 0 the proof of theorem 1 is complete remark 4 under a fixed coordinate basis for any g 2 structure the com ponents of the co associative form and the associated metric g only depend on the components of moreover the dependence is via a composition only of power functions fractions and polynomials in terms of the components of thus we directly verify 7 and 8 references 1 h brezis x cabre
