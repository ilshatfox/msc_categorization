pearse abstract we study a modified notion of ollivier s coarse ricci curvature on graphs in troduced by lin lu and yau in 11 we establish a rigidity theorem for complete graphs that shows a connected finite simple graph is complete if and only if the ricci curvature is strictly greater than one we then derive explicit ricci curvature formulas for strongly regular graphs in terms of the graph parameters and the size of a maximal matching in the core neighborhood as a consequence we are able to derive exact ricci curvature formulas for strongly regular graphs of girth 4 and 5 using elementary means an example is provided that shows there is no exact formula for the ricci curvature for strongly regular graphs of girth 3 that is purely in terms of graph parameters 1 introduction lott villani 13 and sturm 18 discovered a relationship between optimal transport and ricci curvature on smooth riemannian manifolds and they pursued a construction of a synthetic notion of ricci curvature that could be defined independently of differentiable structures ollivier 15 16 later introduced a notion of coarse ricci curvature for markov chains on metric spaces which has a particularly accessible formulation on graphs much work has been done on coarse ricci curvature on graphs cf 1 3 4 9 11 12 14 17 ollivier s coarse ricci curvature on graphs is defined in terms of transport distance of probability measures see section 2 we study a modified notion of ollivier s coarse ricci curvature on graphs introduced by lin lu and yau in 11 in this paper we refer to the modified ricci curvature of 11 as the condensed ricci curvature our first result concerning the condensed ricci curvature exploits the relationship between ricci curvature and the eigenvalues of the spectral graph laplacian to establish a rigidity theorem for complete graphs this result is stated without proof in 11 ex 1 theorem 1 1 a connected finite simple graph g v e is complete if and only if the condensed ricci curvature k x y 1 for all edges xy e in this case k x y n n 1 for all vertices x y v we then turn our attention to the derivation of exact formulas for the condensed ricci curvature on strongly regular graphs explicit formulas and curvature bounds for various forms of ricci curvature have been established for large classes of graphs cf 3 7 9 11 12 17 in particular bakry e mery ricci curvature functions are studied in 7 and explicit formulas for the bakry e mery ricci curvature are derived for cayley graphs and strongly regular graphs of girths 4 and 5 this work served as our inspiration to establish explicit formulas for the condensed ricci curvature on strongly regular graphs using elementary means let g v e be a strongly regular graph with parameters n d here n v is the number of vertices d is the uniform degree of the vertices 0 is the number of 1 http arxiv org abs 1907 06733 v 1 2 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse common neighbors for adjacent vertices and 1 is the number of common neighbors for nonadjacent vertices given an edge xy e let nx denote the set of vertices that are adjacent to x not including y or any vertices that are adjacent to y similarly let ny denote the set of vertices that are adjacent to y not including x or any vertices that are adjacent to x see section 2 for more details we compute the following curvature formulas solely from properties of maximum matchings and the regularity properties of strongly regular graphs theorem 1 2 let g v e be strongly regular graph with parameters n d suppose xy e with maximum matching m of size m between nx and ny then the condensed ricci curvature 1 1 k x y 2 d nx m d remark 1 3 we would like to point out that theorem 1 2 holds more generally for regular graphs of diameter 2 in this case one takes to be the number of neighbors common to both x and y for simplicity in our presentation we focus on strongly regular graphs the explicit formula k x y 2 d was previously established in 17 theorem 6 3 for general graphs with perfect matchings between nx and ny in the setting of strongly regular graphs theorem 1 2 is thus an extension of the results of 17 to the case of maximum match ings these results give insight into the importance of understanding matchings between the neighbor sets nx and ny in the derivation of exact ricci curvature formulas in particular we are able to exploit this idea to derive the explicit formulas for the ricci curvature of strongly regular graphs of girths 4 and 5 using elementary means for strongly regular graphs g v e of girth 5 it follows that adjacent vertices share 0 common neighbors moreover for a given edge xy e there are no edges between the neighbor sets nx and ny then as a simple consequence of theorem 1 2 we have the following ricci curvature formula theorem 1 4 let g v e be strongly regular graph with parameters n d if the girth of g is 5 then condensed ricci curvature k x y 3 d 1 for all xy e from theorem 1 4 it is easy to see that the condensed ricci curvature along any edge of the 5 cycle c 5 is k 1 2 while the condensed ricci curvature along any edge of the peterson graph is k 0 the fact that these are the only nonnegatively curved strongly regular graphs of girth 5 then follows from theorem 1 4 and the classification of moore graphs of diameter 2 due to hoffman and singleton 8 corollary 1 5 the 5 cycle and the petersen graph are the only strongly regular graphs of girth 5 with nonnegative condensed ricci curvature along edges for strongly regular graphs g v e of girth 4 it follows that adjacent vertices share 0 common neighbors for a given edge xy e we appeal to hall s theorem and the pigeonhole principle to establish a perfect matching between the neighbor sets nx and ny then as a consequence of theorem 1 2 we have the following ricci curvature formula condensed ricci curvature 3 theorem 1 6 let g v e be strongly regular graph with parameters n d if the girth of g is 4 then condensed ricci curvature k x y 2 d for all xy e in particular all strongly regular graphs of girth 4 have positive condensed ricci curvature for strongly regular graphs with girth 3 it turns out that there does not exist an exact formula for the condensed ricci curvature solely in terms of the graph parameters this is due to the fact that there are nonisomorphic girth 3 strongly regular graphs with the same graph parameters but different ricci curvatures for example the 4 4 rook s graph and the shrikhande graph both have parameters 16 6 2 2 but their condensed ricci curvatures are k 2 3 and k 1 3 respectively this is due to the fact that for a given edge xy there is a perfect matching between neighbor sets nx and ny for the rook s graph but the maximum matching between nx and ny is size m 1 for the shrikhande graph on the other hand strongly regular conference graphs exhibit many symmetry properties that we believe always lead to perfect matchings between neighbor sets nx and ny we plan to address conference graphs in a forthcoming paper for now we make the following conjecture for conference graphs which can be realized as a direct consequence of theorem 1 2 provided there are always perfect matchings between nx and ny conjecture 1 7 let g v e be a strongly regular conference graph with parameters 4 1 2 1 with 2 then the condensed ricci curvature k x y 1 2 1 2 for all xy e in particular all strongly regular conference graphs have positive condensed ricci curvature strictly greater than 1 2 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we formally define transport distance between probability measures on graphs and the condensed ricci curvature we briefly discuss our choice of notation and terminology and we state some key results from 3 4 that simplify the computation of condensed ricci curvature in section 3 we introduce the spectral graph laplacian and prove theorem 1 1 in section 4 we focus on strongly regular graphs and establish our exact curvature formulas acknowledgements the authors were partially supported by nsf furst grant dms 1620552 the cal poly frost fund csu fresno and cal poly san luis obispo the authors would like to thank csu fresno for their hospitality during their summer participation in the furst program 2 transport distance and condensed ricci curvature on graphs to motivate ollivier s formulation of coarse ricci curvature we turn to the setting of smooth riemannian manifolds suppose that x 1 and x 2 are points on an n dimensional riemannian manifold m and that mi is the uniform measure on the respective geodesic ball b xi of radius centered at xi let d x 1 x 2 denote the geodesic distance between x 1 and x 2 if b x 1 is parallel transported to b x 2 along a geodesic from x 1 to x 2 in 4 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse the direction of tangent vector v at x 1 then the transport distance w m 1 m 2 between the measures and the ricci curvature on m satisfy the relation 15 w m 1 m 2 1 2 2 n 2 ric v v o 3 2 as 0 as noted in 16 this relation allows one to interpret ricci curvature on riemannian manifolds as a measure of the average distance traveled between points of geodesic balls versus their centers under parallel transport using this relationship to guide intuition ollivier defined the ricci curvature of markov chains on metric spaces ric x 1 x 2 1 w m 1 m 2 d x 1 x 2 where w m 1 m 2 denotes the general transport or wasserstein distance between measures mi based at xi and d x 1 x 2 is the metric distance between x 1 and x 2 this definition provides a synthetic notion of ricci curvature of markov chains on metric spaces and its geometric validation comes in the form of analogues of the classical theorems of bonnet myers lichnerowicz and gromov le vy 15 16 ollivier s coarse ricci curvature on graphs is defined in terms of transport distance of probability measures and standard graph distance 15 16 let g v e be a nontrivial locally finite undirected connected simple graph with standard graph shortest path distance function v v n 0 a probability measure or probability mass distribution on g v e is a real valued function v 0 1 such that v v v 1 given probability measures and on g a coupling or transport plan between and is a probability measure v v 0 1 such that w v v w and v v v w the terminology transport plan has economic origins and comes from the optimal transport problem where one interprets a coupling as a plan for transporting mass or goods from one distribution center to another the l 1 wasserstein or transport distance is a metric on the space of probability measures on g that quantifies the optimal transport cost between probability measures on g definition 2 1 the l 1 wasserstein or transport distance between probability measures and on a graph g v e is given by w inf x v y v x y x y where is the set of all transport plans between and condensed ricci curvature 5 we consider a modified notion of ollivier s coarse ricci curvature on graphs introduced by lin lu and yau in 11 that is based on probability measures of the form 2 1 m x y 1 y x deg x y x 0 otherwise for x y v the ollivier ricci curvature is then defined for 0 1 by x y 1 w m x m y x y and the modified ollivier ricci curvature of is then defined for x y v by k x y lim 0 x y we refer to the modified ricci curvature as the condensed ricci curvature our definitions differ slightly from those of 11 in that we use 1 in place of as in 14 17 the reason for this choice in notation and terminology is that we interpret the probability measure 2 1 as encoding an active random walk that becomes stationary as 0 one can view this phenomena as a concentration or condensation of measure this formulation also more closely resembles the notion of coarse ricci curvature of continuous time markov chains given by the derivative x y d dt w mtx m t y x y computing ricci curvature on graphs requires solving the optimal transport problem by definition a given transport plan between measures m x and m x gives an upper bound for the transport distance w m x m y and therefore a lower bound for condensed ricci curvature while an optimal transport plan may be intuitive realizing that it achieves the transport distance directly from the definition is technically challenging as it requires solving a linear programming problem fortunately there is a dual formulation of this optimization problem in terms of 1 lipschitz functions that one can use to provide lower bounds to transport distance and consequently upper bounds for condensed ricci curvature theorem 2 2 kantorovich duality theorem the l 1 wasserstein or transport distance between probability measures and on a graph g v e is given by w sup f lip 1 z v f z z z where lip 1 f v r f x f y x y for all x y v is the space of 1 lipschitz functions on g due to the kantorovich duality theorem we refer to 1 lipschitz functions on a graph g v e as kantorovich potential functions with the kantorovich duality theorem in hand one can compute exact formulas for ricci curvature by specifying a transport plan and a kantorovich potential that provide bounds that pinch the condensed ricci curvature and force equality another useful fact for computing condensed ricci curvature due to 4 is that the ricci activeness function 7 k is piecewise linear with 2 linear parts on regular graphs of degree d and the ollivier ricci curvature differs from the condensed ricci curvature only 6 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse by scale for all values 0 d d 1 more precisely on a regular graph g v e of degree d for any x y v x y k x y for 0 d d 1 for simplicity in our computations we take 1 2 and compute the condensed ricci curvature k x y 2 1 2 x y in riemannian geometry ricci curvature is a local quantity so in the context of graphs it seems natural to restrict one s attention to computing ricci curvature along edges with our conventions this restriction allows for further simplification in computing ricci curvature due to 3 for vertices x v let x y v x y 1 y v xy e denote the neighbor set of x given an edge xy e we denote the set of common neighbors or triangle set of x and y by xy x y then we further decompose the 1 step neighborhoods of x and y into disjoint unions x nx xy y and y ny xy x where nx x xy y and ny y xy x we denote the set of common 2 step neighbors or pentagon set of x and y by pxy z v x z 2 and y z 2 as in 3 we refer to the disjoint union of vertices 2 2 nxy x y xy nx ny pxy as the core neighborhood of an edge xy e it is immediate that the core neighborhood represents a partition of all vertices with distance less than or equal to 2 from x and y moreover the reduction lemma 3 lemma 2 3 shows that when computing the condensed ricci curvature of an edge xy e it is sufficient to consider only the induced subgraph of g lying within the core neighborhood nxy 3 a rigidity theorem for complete graphs in this section we establish a rigidity theorem for complete graphs that shows that a complete graph is the only graph with condensed ricci curvature strictly greater than one given a connected finite simple graph g v e with n vertices v 1 vn the adjacency matrix a of g is a symmetric n n matrix with entries aij 1 if vivj e aij 0 otherwise let di denote the degree of vertex vi and let d diag d 1 dn be the n n diagonal matrix of degrees the spectral graph laplacian is then defined l i d 1 2 ad 1 2 condensed ricci curvature 7 with these conventions it follows that the eigenvalues of the spectral graph laplacian are nondecreasing with 0 0 1 n 1 where the multiplicity of the 0 eigenvalue is the number of connected components of g hence a finite graph is connected if and only if 1 0 0 similar to the spectrum of the metric laplacian on riemannian manifolds the spectrum of the spectral laplacian on graphs encodes geometric and structural properties of a graph in the context of riemannian geometry the lichnerowicz theorem 10 is a widely cele brated theorem that provides a lower bound for the first nonzero eigenvalue of the metric laplacian when the ricci curvature has a strict positive lower bound more precisely if mn g is an n dimensional compact riemannian manifold with ricg n 1 kg for some positive constant k 0 then the first positive eigenvalue of the metric laplacian 1 nk the graph analog of the lichnerowicz theorem similarly shows that a positive lower bound on condensed ricci curvature serves as a lower bound on the first nonzero eigenvalue of the spectral graph laplacian theorem 3 1 11 theorem 4 2 suppose g v e is a connected finite simple graph with condensed ricci curvature k x y 0 0 for some positive constant 0 and all edges xy e then the first nonzero eigenvalue of the spectral graph laplacian 1 0 in order to establish a rigidity theorem for complete graphs we first record some well known results on the first nonzero eigenvalue of the spectral graph laplacian theorem 3 2 6 let g v e be a simple graph on n vertices then 1 n n 1 with equality if and only if g is complete moreover complete graphs are the only graphs with 1 1 we now prove the following rigidity theorem through direct computation and the aid of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 theorem 3 3 a connected finite simple graph g v e is complete if and only if the condensed ricci curvature k x y 1 for all edges xy e proof let g v e be the complete graph on n vertices and let xy e then the triangle set xy v x y since g is complete let mx and my denote 1 2 probability measures based at x and y respectively defined as in 2 1 consider the transport plan v v 0 1 between mx and my given by v w 1 2 1 2 n 1 v x w y 1 2 n 1 v w 0 otherwise 8 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse which transports excess mass directly from x to y and leaves the remainder of the distribution fixed then by definition 2 1 the transport distance w mx my v v w v v w v w x y 1 2 1 2 n 1 and therefore the condensed ricci curvature 3 1 k x y 2 1 2 x y 2 1 1 2 1 2 n 1 1 1 n 1 1 conversely let g v e be a connected finite simple graph with condensed ricci curva ture k x y 1 for all edges xy e then by the graph lichnerowicz theorem 3 1 of 11 it follows 1 1 and therefore g is complete by theorem 3 2 remark 3 4 using the 1 lipschitz function f v r defined by f v 1 v x 0 otherwise it follows from the kantorovich duality theorem 2 2 that the transport distance w mx my v v f v mx v my v mx x my x 1 2 1 2 n 1 and therefore the condensed ricci curvature 3 2 k x y 2 1 2 x y 2 1 1 2 1 2 n 1 1 1 n 1 hence from 3 1 and 3 2 we see that the condensed ricci of the complete graph on n vertices is k x y 1 1 n 1 n n 1 for all edges xy e as stated in 11 ex 1 4 strongly regular graphs in this section we derive an explicit formula for the condensed ricci curvature of strongly regular graphs g v e in terms of the graph parameters and the size of a maximum matching in the core neighborhood recall that a simple undirected finite graph g v e is said to be a strongly regular graph with parameters n d if g has n vertices of constant degree d where any two adjacent vertices share 0 common neighbors and any two nonadjacent vertices share 1 common neighbors given an edge xy e we consider the core neighborhood decomposition 2 2 given by nxy x y xy nx ny pxy that was introduced in 3 and where the neighbor sets nx x xy y and ny x xy y since strongly regular graphs have diameter 2 it follows that v nxy hence for strongly regular graphs the induced subgraph lying within the core neighborhood of any edge accounts for the entire graph g moreover from strong regularity we see xy so that nx ny d 1 and pxy n 2 d condensed ricci curvature 9 our strategy in the derivation of an explicit formula for the condensed ricci curvature of strongly regular graphs reformulates the problem of finding candidates for an optimal transport plan and an optimal kantorovich potential into a maximum matching problem definition 4 1 a matching on a finite undirected simple graph g v e is a subset of edges m e such that no vertex in v is incident to more than one edge in m the size of a matching m on g is the total number of edges in m a matching m on g is said to be a maximum matching if it contains the largest possible number of edges a maximum matching between disjoint subsets of vertices s t v is said to be a perfect matching if every vertex in s and t is incident to exactly one edge of the matching let g v e be strongly regular graph with edge xy e given a maximum matching m between the neighbor sets nx and ny we denote the vertices that are matched in nx and ny by mx and my respectively if m is not a perfect matching we denote the remaining unmatched vertices in nx and ny by ux nx mx and uy ny my respectively with this decomposition of nx and ny into matched and unmatched vertices it is fairly straightforward to develop a candidate for an optimal transport plan however developing a candidate for an optimal kantorovich potential requires a deeper understanding of the incidence relations between edges in a given maximum matching and the remaining edges between nx and ny definition 4 2 let m be a matching on an undirected simple graph g v e an alternating path p in g is a path p v 0 v 1 vk such that the initial vertex v 0 is unmatched and vivi 1 m if and only if vi 1 vi 6 m for all 0 i k an augmenting path p in g is an alternating path p v 0 v 1 vk such that the terminal vertex vk is also unmatched we refer to a single vertex as a trivial path hence with this convention any unmatched vertex is by itself a trivial augmenting path one of the main tools in our construction of a candidate for an optimal kantorovich potential is berge s lemma 2 lemma 4 3 berge s lemma a matching m on an undirected simple graph g v e is a maximum matching if and only if g contains no nontrivial augmenting paths given a matching m on a graph g v e and a subset of vertices u v we denote the subset of matched vertices in u by m u for a subset of vertices s v we denote the subset of alternating paths with initial vertex in s by as for subsets of vertices s t v we denote the set of vertices in t that lie along an alternating path initiated in s by as t we use the contrapositive of the following lemma to show that certain vertices in the neighbor sets nx and ny have no edges between them ultimately this allows us to ensure our candidate for an optimal kantorovich potential is 1 lipschitz lemma 4 4 let h v e be a finite undirected bipartite graph with parts s t let m be a maximum matching on h and suppose v as s and w t if vw e then w as t proof first note that since h is bipartite it follows that an alternating path initiated in s can only terminate in an unmatched vertex in t therefore if v as s is an unmatched vertex then v must be the initial vertex of an alternating path but then w must be a matched vertex so that w as t since otherwise vw e is an augmenting path contradicting berge s lemma as m is a maximum matching now assume that v is a matched vertex and that p v 0 v 1 viv is an alternating path initiated at v 0 6 v s that terminates at v s then since v 0 s is an unmatched vertex and h is bipartite it 10 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse follows that viv m since p is an alternating path but then vw 6 m since otherwise v is incident to more than one edge in m but then the concatenation p v 0 v 1 vivw is an alternating path so that w as t we use this final lemma to compute a lower bound for condensed ricci curvature from our kantorovich potential in terms of the number of vertices in nx and ny along alternating paths initiated in ny lemma 4 5 let h v e be a finite undirected bipartite graph with parts s t suppose m is a maximum matching of size m on h then as s as t s m proof let v as t and suppose p v 0 v 1 viv is an alternating path initiated at v 0 s that terminates at v t then since v 0 s is an unmatched vertex and h is bipartite it follows that viv 6 m since p is an alternating path if v is an unmatched vertex then p is an augmenting path contrary to berge s lemma as m is a maximum matching hence v must be a matched vertex and therefore since matched vertices are incident to a single edge in the matching it follows that there exits a unique vertex w s such that vw m but then the concatenation p v 0 v 1 vw is an alternating path initiated in s that terminates at the matched vertex w m s hence for each v as t there is a unique w as s m s with vw m on the other hand given w as s m s suppose p w 0 w 1 wiw is an alternat ing path initiated in s that terminates at w s then since w is a matched vertex by assumption it is clear that p is a nontrivial path and that wi t is the unique matched vertex with wiw m but then p w 0 w 1 wi is an alternating path initiated in s that terminates at wi t so that wi as t hence for each w as s m s there is a unique v as t with vw m thus since as t m t we have a bijection between the subsets as t and as s m s and therefore as t as s m s noting s m s as s since under our conventions all unmatched vertices in s are trivial alternating paths initiated in s it follows as t as s m s as s s m s as s s m s as s s m hence as s as t s m as desired we are now in a position to derive an explicit formula for condensed ricci curvature of an edge xy e in terms of the graph parameters and the size of a maximum matching between the neighbor sets nx and ny theorem 4 6 let g v e be strongly regular graph with parameters n d suppose xy e with maximum matching m of size m between nx and ny then the condensed ricci curvature k x y 2 d nx m d proof let xy e and consider the core neighborhood decomposition of g as in 2 2 let h denote the induced bipartite subgraph consisting of all edges in e between vertices in nx condensed ricci curvature 11 and ny suppose that m is a maximum matching on h of size m m assuming m is not a perfect matching as above we denote the matched and unmatched vertices in nx and ny by mx my and ux uy respectively note that ux uy since nx ny and mx my for i 1 nx m let x u i nx and y u i ny denote the unmatched vertices in h and for j 1 m let xmj nx and y m j ny denote the matched vertices in h up to reordering of indices we may assume xmi y m i m for i 1 m clearly there are no edges in e incident to unmatched vertices since m is a maximum matching so xui y u j 6 e for all 1 i j nx m but then x u i y u i 2 in g since x u i and y u i are not adjacent and g has diameter 2 hence for 1 i nx m we may pair unmatched vertices xui with y u i along 2 step paths in g for simplicity in notation write x u i y u i m 2 to denote unmatched vertices xui ux and y u i uy that have been paired along a 2 step path together these matchings pairings induce a transport plan that moves excess mass from x to y and that moves mass from xmi mx x u i ux directly to their matched paired neighbors ymi my y u i uy along 1 step and 2 step paths respectively more precisely consider the transport plan defined by 4 1 v w 1 2 1 2 d v x w y 1 2 d v w xy x y 1 2 d vw m 1 2 d vw m 2 0 otherwise noting that nx ny d 1 it follows that the transport distance w mx my v v w v v w v w 1 2 1 2 d m 1 2 d nx m 2 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 d d 2 nx m thus the condensed ricci curvature k x y 2 1 2 x y 2 1 1 2 1 2 d d 2 nx m 4 2 2 d nx m d next we define a kantorovich potential function f v r with respect to the matching m by 4 3 f z 1 z x 1 z nx any nx 1 z any ny 0 otherwise where any nx and any ny denote the vertices in nx and ny respectively that lie along alternating paths initiated in ny taking t nx and s ny in lemma 4 4 it follows that there are no edges between nx any nx and any ny hence f is a 1 lipschitz function on v 12 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse let ax any nx and ay any ny then nx any nx nx ax d 1 ax and by lemma 4 5 ay any ny any nx ny m ax nx m therefore by the kantorovich duality theorem we find that the transport distance w mx my z v f z mx z my z 1 2 1 2 d d 1 ax 1 2 d ay 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 d d 1 ax 1 2 d ax nx m 1 2 d 1 2 1 2 d d 2 nx m similar to the calculation 4 2 we have 4 4 k x y 2 1 2 x y 2 d nx m d hence from the inequalities 4 2 and 4 4 it follows k x y 2 d nx m d now if m is a perfect matching between nx and ny then the size of m is by definition m nx ny d 1 moreover since all vertices in nx and ny are matched by some edge in m it follows that there are no alternating paths initiated in nx or ny in the induced bipartite subgraph between vertices in nx and ny but then any nx and any ny taking all of this into account we see that the same transport plan 4 1 coupled with the kantorovich potential 4 3 yield the equality k x y 2 d in the case of a perfect matching between nx and ny 4 1 strongly regular graphs of girths 4 and 5 in this subsection we exploit the adjacency properties of strongly regular graphs g v e to derive explicit formulas for the condensed ricci curvature of strongly regular graphs of girths 4 and 5 let g v e be a strongly regular graph with parameters n d it is well known 5 that if g has girth 5 then 0 and 1 while a strongly regular graph g with girth 4 has 0 and 2 the following theorem is an immediate consequence of theorem 4 6 and the fact that the girth of a graph is its minimal cycle length theorem 4 7 let g v e be strongly regular graph with parameters n d if the girth of g is 5 then the condensed ricci curvature k x y 3 d 1 for all edges xy e condensed ricci curvature 13 proof let xy e and consider the core neighborhood decomposition of g as in 2 2 let x 0 nx and suppose that x 0 y 0 e for some y 0 ny then xx 0 y 0 yx is a cycle of length 4 contradicting the fact that g has girth 5 thus there are no edges between nx and ny so the maximum matching between nx and ny has size m 0 therefore from theorem 4 6 with 0 and m 0 we find that the condensed ricci curvature k x y 3 d 1 remark 4 8 the transportation plan 4 1 and kantorovich potential 4 3 can be used to compute this curvature formula directly since g is girth 5 there are no edges between vertices in nx and ny so m and each vertex in nx can be paired to a vertex in ny through a 2 step path moreover if we consider induced bipartite subgraph h between nx and ny the collection of alternating paths in h that start in ny consists solely of trivial paths so any ny ny and any nx in the girth 4 case we appeal to hall s theorem which can be used to give necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect matchings on bipartite graphs let h v e be a finite bipartite graph with parts s t for any subset w s we define t w v t vw e for some w w to be the collection of all vertices v t sharing an edge with some vertex in w more simply put t w is the neighbor set of w in t theorem 4 9 hall s theorem let h v e be a finite undirected bipartite graph with parts s t then there is a matching that covers s if and only if t w w for every subset of vertices w s with hall s theorem in hand we are able to establish a perfect matching between the neighbor sets nx and ny for strongly regular graphs with girth 4 as a consequence of the pigeonhole principle theorem 4 10 let g v e be strongly regular graph with parameters n d if the girth of g is 4 then the condensed ricci curvature k x y 2 d for all edges xy e proof let xy e and consider the core neighborhood decomposition of g as in 2 2 then since 0 it follows that g is triangle free suppose that xi nx then since xi is nonadjacent to y it follows xi and y have 2 common neighbors clearly one such neighbor is x so xi has 1 1 neighbors in ny since xy similarly each vertex yj ny has 1 1 neighbors in nx now consider the induced bipartite subgraph h g nx ny consisting of all edges in e between vertices in nx and ny for sake of contradiction suppose that let x nx with x q ny x k since each vertex xi x nx has 1 1 neighbors in ny it 14 bonini carroll dinh dye frederick and pearse follows that there are 1 q edges between x and ny x therefore by the generalized pigeonhole principle there exists some w ny x with w 1 q k 1 q q 1 since q k this contradicts the fact that every vertex in ny has exactly 1 neighbors in nx thus x ny x for all subsets x nx and therefore since nx ny it follows that there is a perfect matching in h by hall s theorem noting that 0 it follows from theorem 4 6 with 0 and m nx that the
