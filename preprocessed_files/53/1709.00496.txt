the degenerate special lagrangian equation on riemannian manifolds matthew dellatorre abstract we show that the degenerate special lagrangian equation recently introduced by rubinstein solomon induces a global equation on every riemannian manifold and that for certain associated geometries this equation governs as it does in the euclidean setting geodesics in the space of positive lagrangians for example geodesics in the space of positive lagrangian sections of a smooth calabi yau torus fibration are governed by the riemannian dsl on the base manifold we then develop their analytic techniques specifically modifications of the dirichlet duality theory of harvey lawson in the riemannian setting to obtain continuous solutions to the dirichlet problem for the riemannian dsl and hence continuous geodesics in the space of positive lagrangians 1 introduction let f c 2 0 1 rn and then f t x satisfies the degenerate special lagrangian equation of phase if im e 1 det in 1 2 f 0 and re e 1 det i 1 2 xf 0 1 here in denotes the diagonal n 1 n 1 matrix with diagonal entries 0 1 1 the degenerate special lagrangian equation dsl was introduced by rubinstein solomon rs in connection to geodesics in the space of positive lagrangians of a calabi yau manifold it is a fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation when the featured calabi yau is cn the geodesic endpoint problem in the space of positive graph lagrangians corresponds to solving the dirichlet problem for the dsl in particular the conditions in 1 capture respectively the notions of geodesic and positivity in this setting under appropriate boundary conditions unique continuous solutions to the dirichlet problem for the dsl exist this was accomplished in rs by finding a natural notion of subsolution to the dsl and then adapting the dirichlet duality framework of harvey lawson hl 2 for degenerate elliptic equations in euclidean space harvey lawson hl 3 have also developed a dirichlet duality theory for equations on riemanian man ifolds the starting point for this framework is an equation f in euclidean space and a riemannian manifold m assuming the topology on m is sufficiently mild and the symmetry of f is sufficiently high one can define a global equation on m that is locally modelled on f thus from this point of view it is natural to consider the equation induced by the dsl on riemannian manifolds and that is the purpose of this note geodesics in the space of positive lagrangians play a crucial role in a program initiated by solomon s 1 s 2 see also sy to understand the existence and uniqueness of special lagrangian submanifolds in calabi yau manifolds they also play a key role in a new approach to the arnold conjecture put forth by rubinstein solomon rs section 2 3 and in the development of a pluripotential theory for lagrangian graphs initiated in rs see also dr 1 1 results we begin with the easy observation that the dsl carries over to a global equation on every riemannian manifold for precise statements see section 2 and appendix a proposition 1 1 1 given any riemannian manifold m the degenerate special lagrangian equation car ries over in the sense of harvey lawson to a global equation on r m locally modelled on the dsl we refer to this equation as the riemannian dsl on r m 1 ar x iv 1 70 9 00 49 6 v 2 m at h a p 2 3 a pr 2 01 8 the second goal of this paper is to show that the riemannian dsl also governs geodesics in the space of positive lagrangians for certain geometries associated to m for example when the ambient calabi yau manifold is the cotangent bundle t m of certain paralellizable manifolds or when it is a lagrangian fibration over m see section 3 for details and definitions theorem 1 1 2 let m be integrably parallelizable then t m admits a calabi yau structure and the riemannian dsl on 0 1 m governs geodesics in the space of positive graph lagrangians in t m theorem 1 1 3 let x be a smooth calabi yau torus fibration over m then the riemannian dsl on 0 1 m governs geodesics in the space of positive lagrangian sections in x this motivates the third goal of this paper which is to solve the dirchlet problem for the riemannian dsl as this corresponds to the endpoint problem for geodesics more specifically we aim to solve the dirichlet problem on domains of the form d 0 1 d r m where d m is a bounded domain this is accomplished by following the approach of rubinstein solomon in particular we extend the dirichlet duality theory of harvey lawson to include certain domains with corners in riemannian manifolds such as d when d m has boundary this extension is contained in theorem 4 2 1 under appropriate boundary conditions theorem 4 2 1 provides continuous solutions to the dirichlet problem for the riemannian dsl on d and thus continuous geodesics in the space of positive lagrangians a special case of this result is the following theorem by strictly convex we mean that all of the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form ii d are strictly positive and by admissible we mean that this local frame for tm is part of a family of frames whose transition maps are on valued see appendix a theorem 1 1 4 let m g be a complete simply connected riemannian manifold with non positive sec tional curvature and let d m be a bounded strictly convex domain for i 0 1 let i c 2 d satisfy tr tan 1 hess i e e c 2 c 2 2 where e e 1 en is any admissible local frame for the tangent bundle then there exists a unique solution u c 0 d to the dirichlet problem for the riemannian dsl of phase where c mod 2 with u i d i and u 0 1 d affine in t see remark 5 0 2 for a proof in certain settings see section 3 and rs section 1 condition 2 is equivalent to the condition that the graph of d i in the cotangent bundle is a positive lagrangian 1 2 geometry of the space of lagrangians the following section is based on the work of solomon s 1 s 2 and briefly recalls the terminology concerning the geometry of the space of positive lagrangians let l be an n dimensional real manifold and x j an almost calabi yau manifold of complex dimension n that is x j is a ka hler manifold and is a nowhere vanishing holomorphic n form define l x is an oriented lagrangian submanifold diffeomorphic to l for the space of positive lagrangians is defined as l l re e 1 0 3 denote by o l a connected component of the intersection of l with an orbit ham x acting on l where ham x is the group of compactly supported hamiltonion diffeomorphisms of x when l is compact the tangent space to o can be identified with the space of smooth functions satisfying a normalization condition t o h c hre 0 4 and a weak riemannian metric on o is defined by h k hkre e 1 for h k t o 5 2 when l is non compact the normalization condition in 4 can be dropped and the tangent space at is isomorphic to the space of compactly supported functions on more specifically given a path 0 1 o and a family of diffeomorphisms gt l t let ht t r be the unique function satisfying g t dgt dt d ht gt 6 and the normalization condition in 4 then the velocity vector to is defined as d t dt ht given a vector field qt t to along the levi civita coavariant derivative of qt in the direction of d t dt is defined by dqt dt t qt gt g t dqt t g 1 t 7 where t is the unique vector field on l such that tg tre e i g t dgt dt re e i 8 viewing gt l t x as a map from l to x the geodesic equation is then found by taking qt ht d t dt dht dt t ht gt g t dht t g 1 t 0 9 1 3 dirichlet duality theory this section provides a brief sketch of harvey lawson s hl 2 hl 3 dirichlet duality theory see appendix a for a more thorough review see also the work of slodkowski sl 1 sl 2 sl 3 sl 4 let be a bounded domain in rn and consider an equation of the form f d 2 u 0 on to any such equation f dirichlet duality associates a subequation f this is a closed proper subset of sym 2 rn that is invariant under translation by positive matrices roughly speaking f d 2 u 0 f a sym 2 rn f a 0 in most cases the set f will usually be a more regular proper subset of this set regardless solutions u c 2 of f must satisfy d 2 xu f this gives rise to a natural notion of a subsolution to f a c 2 function u is f subharmonic on if d 2 xu f x 10 this definition extends to upper semi continuous functions in a viscosity like way via c 2 test functions and these f subharmonic functions comprise the subsolutions the class of f subharmonic functions remarkably share most of the important properties that the classical subharmonic and convex functions satisfy for example closure under decreasing limits and taking maxima decreasing limits uniform limits and upper envelopes see theorem a 3 1 for each subequation f there is an associated dual subequation f defined as f intf the importance of the dual subequation lies in the fact that f f f f 0 11 this immediately allows one to define a notion of weak solution let u be a c 2 function such that u is f subharmonic and u is f subharmonic on then by 10 and 11 u satisfies f d 2 u x 0 x a function u is said to be f harmonic if u is f subharmonic and u is f subharmonic these functions will comprise our weak solutions note that since both u and u are upper semi continuous u is automatically continuous given a domain and an equation f the existence of continuous solutions to dirichlet problem for f requires that is f convex where f is a subequation associated to f this subequation specific convexity generalizes conventional convexity the perron method is used to construct solutions and this convexity implies the existence of barrier functions this explicit relationship between the equation and the necessary geometry of the boundary is one of the exceptional aspects of dirichlet duality 3 1 4 organization in the next section we prove proposition 1 1 1 showing that the dsl induces in the sense of harvey lawson a global equation on every riemannian manifold we then geometrically motivate our study of the riemannian dsl in section 3 by proving theorem 1 1 2 and theorem 1 1 3 in section 5 we extend the dirichlet duality theory in the riemannian setting to include domains with corners proving a generalization of theorem 1 1 4 in section 6 we use these results to obtain unique continuous solutions to the dirichlet problem for the dsl on riemannian manifolds and hence continuous geodesics finally for ease of reference we include an appendix with a brief summary of dirichlet duality theory 2 the riemannian dsl subequation when x cn rn 1 rn with the standard calabi yau structure 1 2 j dzj dzj and dz 1 dzn and l is identified with rn 0 cn the analysis in section 1 2 leads to the degenerate special lagrangian equation theorem 2 0 1 rs proposition 2 3 let and let ki c 2 rn i 0 1 be such that graph dki cn are elements of o let k c 2 0 1 rn be such that graph dxk t cn is an element of o for each t 0 1 then t graph dxk t is a geodesic in o with endpoints graph dki i 0 1 if and only if k satisfies im e 1 det in 1 2 k 0 and re e 1 det i 1 2 xk 0 12 and k 0 k 0 c k 1 k 1 c for a constant c r 2 1 the dsl subequation in order to obtain a subequation for the dsl rubinstein solomon associate to each u c 2 d where d 0 1 d the circle valued function u t x 2 u t x arg det in 1 2 u t x s 1 defined where det in 1 2 u t x 6 0 this angle is called the space time lagrangian angle by analogy with the lagrangian angle of harvey lawson hl 1 accordingly if u c 2 d solves the dsl of phase then u for a complex matrix b let spec b be its set of eigenvalues and for spec b denote by m its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial let s sym 2 rn 1 denote the set of symmetric matrices with all zeros in the first row and column and for a sym 2 rn 1 s define a spec in 1 a m arg branch of arg with values in note that arg det in 1 a a mod 2 denote by the minimal upper semi continuous extension of to sym 2 rn 1 theorem 2 1 1 rs theorem 1 1 the function is well defined and differentiable on sym 2 rn 1 s and for each c n 1 2 n 1 2 such that c mod 2 the set fc a sym 2 rn 1 a c is a subequation for the dsl of phase remark 2 1 2 the different choices of c for a given correspond to the different branches of the dsl the dsl subequation is unique in the sense that it arises as the super level set of an upper semi continuous function and not a continuous one cannot be extended continuously to all of sym 2 rn 1 see rs section 3 for more details 4 the positivity condition defining the space of positive lagrangians can also be phrased in terms of a subequation namely the special lagrangian subequation introduced by harvey lawson fc a sym 2 rn tr tan 1 a c theorem 2 1 3 rs corollary 5 6 let let d rn be a domain and let k c 2 0 1 d then k is a solution of the dsl if and only if for each t x 0 1 d 2 k t x fc f c fc 2 xk t x int fc 2 f c 2 for a fixed c n 1 2 n 1 2 satisfying c 2 k with k z 2 2 the riemannian dsl subequation in this section we prove the following proposition 2 2 1 for any riemannian manifold m the riemannian manifold r m admits a global riemannian subequation fc locally modelled on the euclidean degenerate special lagrangian subequation fc proposition 1 1 1 is then an immediate consequence to prove proposition 2 2 1 we show that the n 1 dimensional manifold r m admits a topological on structure and that fc has compact invariance group on this implies that fc induces a global equation on r m see section a 5 proof of proposition 2 2 1 to see that r m admits an on structure viewing on on 1 observe that because r m is globally a product t r m tr tm and r being parallelizable admits a trivial structure in terms of the metric since on structures are equivalent to riemannian structures this represents the fact that r m admits a global product metric now we show that the compact invariance group of fc contains on let s denote the elements a sym 2 rn 1 of the form a diag 0 b for some b sym 2 rn and set in diag 0 i from rs section 3 1 it follows that if a s a 2 tr arg i 1 b if a sym 2 rn 1 s a spec in 1 a m arg let h diag 1 h on 1 where h on when a s a diag 0 b so haht 2 tr arg i 1 hbht 2 tr arg i 1 b a when a s we have in 1 haht hinht 1 haht h in 1 a ht and since on 1 un 1 the spectrum of in 1 a and in 1 haht are the same thus haht a therefore the compact invariance group of fc contains on on 1 the special lagrangian subequation fc has been studied by harvey lawson see hl 2 section 10 and hl 3 section 14 since fc depends only on the eigenvalues of a it is on invariant and caries over to a riemannian subequation fc on any n dimensional riemannian manifold 5 2 3 the dsl on complex manifolds and higher corank in unpublished notes r rubinstein showed that the dsl subequation can also be defined in the complex setting i e there is a well defined subequation for the equation im det in 1 hesscu 0 13 where hessc is the complex 1 1 hessian harvey lawson considered the non degenerate case in hl 3 section 15 more specifically let k cn 1 c so that z 1 zn 7 k z 1 zn k t z 1 zn where t 1 s then equation 13 is invariant under the unitary matrices un un 1 in the sense that for any u diag 1 v un 1 where v un im det in 1 uhesscku im det v in 1 hessck v im det in 1 hessck any almost complex manifold x admits a topological un structure since c is paralellizable c x also admits a topological un structure viewing un un 1 thus for any almost complex manifold x there exists a global equation on c x locally modelled on equation 13 taking d x to be the domain d z c x 0 t 1 and z d i e an infinite strip of width 1 in the complex plane times d x one can consider the dirichlet problem for equation 13 on d with data depending only on the real part it was also shown in r that there are corresponding subequations for higher co rank dsl equations on rn k with in replaced by the diagonal matrix diag 0 0 1 1 with k zeros and n ones in an analogous manner these equations will carry over to equations on rk m for any n dimensional riemannian manifold m 3 geometric motivation for the riemannian dsl in this section we prove theorem 1 1 2 and theorem 1 1 3 3 1 parallelizable manifolds and almost calabi yau cotangent bundles recall that an n dimensional manifold m is parallelizable if it admits a global frame field for the tangent bundle in terms of its topological structure group see section a 5 a manifold is parallelizable if it admits an i structure where i is the trivial subgroup in gl n r examples of parallelizable manifolds include all orientable 3 dimensional manifolds and all lie groups hl 3 section 5 2 an almost calabi yau manifold is an almost complex hermitian manifold x with a global section of n 0 t x whose real part has comass 1 hl 3 section 1 this is equivalent to having topological structure group sun when m is parallelizable we can explicitly construct an almost calabi yau structure on t m which respects the cotangent bundle fibration the following construction is based on hl 3 section 14 let m g be a parallelizable riemannian manifold taking a global orthonormal frame v v 1 vn we identify tm m rn taking the global coframe w w 1 wn to v t m m rn thus v w forms a global frame for t t m t m r 2 n where movement along m is captured by v and movement within the fibre by w let v and w denote the dual frames to v and w for the cotangent bundle of t m in terms of this framing t m admits an almost calabi yau structure 6 almost complex structure j jvi wi jwi vi non vanishing n 0 form v 1 1 w 1 v n 1 w n non degenerate 2 form i v i w i in general this structure is not integrable that is j is not a integrable complex structure and and are not closed however a certain degree of integrability is necessary for solomon s geometry on the space of positive lagrangians for instance if j is not integrable then will not be closed and the connection on o may no longer be the levi civita connection to remedy this we now consider a special class of parallelizable manifolds on which the above almost calabi yau structure is a true calabi yau structure as defined in section 1 2 a manifold is called integrably parallelizable if it admits an atlas of charts such that the differentials of the transition maps are the identity in terms of topological structure groups this is equivalent to saying m admits an integrable i structure theorem 3 1 1 h section 1 let m be connected and parallelizable then m is integrably paralellizable if and only if m is open i e non compact and without boundary or diffeomorphic to the n dimensional torus example 3 1 2 h examples of integrably parallelizable manifolds i open lie groups ii punctured compact connected lie groups iii open orientable 3 manifolds iv diffeomorphic images of the torus v punctured stiefel manifolds s 3 and rp 3 are examples of parallelizable manifolds that are not integrably parallelizable we now prove theorem 1 1 2 proof of theorem 1 1 2 we first construct a calabi yau structure on t m since m is integrably paral lelizable we have a covering of coordinate charts u a such that the differential of the transition maps is the identity let x be coordinates on u and consider the induced coordinate charts on t m v u rn where rn corresponds to the coordinates 1 n for dx 1 dxn it is easy to see that t m is also integrably parallelizable with this corresponding atlas let v w to be the global frame for t t m which on v takes the form vi xi and wi i and take the almost calabi yau structure on t m as defined above this almost calabi yau structure is integrable since the complex structure is defined in terms of coordinate vector fields the nijenhuis tensor vanishes meaning the complex structure is integrable it follows that is holomorphic and it is clear that is closed and compatible with j next we show that the riemannian dsl coincides with the geodesic equation for gradient graphs these computations closely follow rs section 2 4 so we mostly emphasize the differences consider the path of lagrangians in t m given by t graph dft where ft c 2 m for t 0 1 let gt m t where gt p p dft p 7 then in local coordinates dgt dt tdft n i 1 2 ft t xi i and dgt i hess ft x x where hess ft x x denotes the riemannian hessian in local coordinates on m with respect to the flat metric on m induced by the calabi yau structure on t m it is obvious that dgt is the identity in the horizontal direction to see that it is the riemannian hessian in the vertical we compute the image of xi under dgt let denote the induced metric connection on the cotangent bundle given in coordinates by xi dxk kijdxj given s m satisfying s 0 p and ds dt 0 xi the vertical component at p m is given by d dt k ft xk s t dxk s t t 0 k 2 ft xi xk p dxk p ft xk d dt dxk s t t 0 k 2 ft xi xk p dxk p ft xk xi dxk p k 2 ft xi xk p dxk p ft xk kijdx j p 2 ft xi xj p kij ft xk dxj p image under ith row of the matrix hesspft x x where the ij th entry of hesspft x x is hesspft xi xj note that in this particular construction the kij 0 as the metric on m is flat this more general computation will be relevant in the next section where the metric on the base manifold is not flat now expressing gt with respect to the global frame v w gt p p dft p v p dft p v 1 dft p vn where dft p vi is the coefficient for wi dgt dt tdft p v n i 1 tdft vi wi and dgt i hesspft v v plugging into equation 6 g t dgt dt dgt dt dgt j w j v j n i 1 tdft vi wi dgt df t where f t p denotes the derivative of ft p with respect to t giving us ht g t p f t p 14 we then compute g t dgt dt n i 1 dgt dt dgt v 1 v i vn w

equation 9 becomes im e 1 det in 1 hessf v v 0 15 where v t v is a global frame on 0 1 m and the hessian of f is taken with respect to t and x the positivity condition 3 on the lagrangians implies that re e 1 detb 0 0 or re det i 1 hessft v v 0 16 3 2 calabi yau torus fibrations in this section inspired by a paper of leung yau zaslow lyz we consider calabi yau manifolds which admit a smooth torus fibration that is a calabi yau manifold x which is actually a fibred manifold x m where for any p m 1 p tn we show that the geodesic equation for positive lagrangian sections corresponds to the riemannian dsl on 0 1 m proving theorem 1 1 4 we begin by summarizing the calculations of lyz section 3 let x be a calabi yau n fold admitting a smooth torus fibration over a base manifold m possibly compact and let be a tn invariant ka hler potential on x that is xj yj xj where y are local coordinates on the fiber and x local coordinates on the base the coordinates zj xj iyj are holomorphic on x and the ka hler metric and form are given respectively by h 2 xi xj dxi dxj dyi dyj and 1 2 2 xi xj dzi dzj by calabi c x is ricci flat and dz 1 dzn is covariant constant if and only if satisfies the real monge ampe re equation det 2 xi xj c 17 for some constant c since satisfies 17 the calabi yau condition n n c 1 n n 1 2 1 2 n is satisfied because of the semi flatness of h x is locally isometric to the tangent bundle tm with the metric induced by g 2 xi xj dxi dxj on m moreover if this metric on m is used to identify its tangent and cotangent bundles then is the standard symplectic form on the cotangent bundle consider a lagrangian section c of this fibration locally written as y x in x using the identification with the cotangent bundle and the fact that c is lagrangian with respect to if and only if it is closed and hence locally exact it is shown lyz that locally yj jk f xk for some function f and further computations show dz 1 dzn c det i 1 g 1 hess f dx 1 dxn 18 9 proof of theorem 1 1 3 let ct m x be a smooth path of lagrangian sections parametrized by t 0 1 take gt m ct where gt p p ct p then locally by the above analysis dgt dt n j 1 jk 2 ft t xk yj by calculations similar to those in section 3 1 and rs section 2 4 g t dgt dt df t x g t dgt dt n i 1 detbi dx 1 d xi dxn and g t det i 1 g 1 hess ft dx 1 dxn detb 0 dx 1 dxn where bi i 0 n is the n by n matrix obtained by removing the i 1 th column from the n by n 1 matrix b 1 tdft i 1 g 1 hess ft taking g e g where e is the euclidean metric on r we can express the positivity and geodesic conditions respectively as re e i det i 1 g 1 hess ft 0 and im e 1 det in 1 g 1 hess f 0 where the second hessian is taken with respect to g and f is viewed as a function on 0 1 m finally choosing a local orthonormal admissible frame v v 1 vn on m and extending this to r m by v t v we rewrite these conditions as re e 1 det i 1 hess ft v v 0 and im e 1 det in 1 hess f v v 0 4 dirichlet duality theory with weak boundary assumptions let f be a riemannian subequation on a manifold m in this section we extend dirichlet duality theory to include certain domains u m with corners following the conventions of joyce j given a manifold with corners u the boundary u is itself a manifold with corners equipped with a map iu u u which may not be injective the manifold u is said to be a manifold with embedded corners if u can be written as the disjoint union of a finite number of open and closed subsets on each of which iu is injective a function on u is called consistent if it is constant on the fibres of iu in the case that m rn rubinstein solomon extended dirichlet duality to include such domains theorem 4 0 1 rs theorem 7 8 let f be a subequation in sym 2 rn and let u be a bounded domain in rn such that u is a manifold with embedded corners let be a consistent continuous function on u assume u is strictly f convex and strictly f convex then the f dirichlet problem for u admits a unique solution in c 0 u theorem 4 0 1 was then used to obtain continuous solutions to the dirichlet problem for the dsl which as previously mentioned is naturally posed on a domain with corners our goal here is to achieve a similar extension in the setting of riemannian manifolds theorem 4 2 1 and use it to obtain solutions to the dirichlet problem for the riemmanian dsl we briefly outline our approach and provide context for it in relation to rs hl 2 hl 3 in section 4 1 we extend the notion of boundary convexity in a weakened sense to domains with corners this is accomplished by decomposing the boundary into a part that is convex in the original sense and a part where given subsolutions are well behaved our definitions come straight from rs section 7 2 section 4 2 is then devoted to proving theorem 4 2 1 because of the local nature of the arguments used in dirichlet duality in the riemannian setting the proofs in hl 3 section 12 carry over almost exactly to this setting this can be contrasted to the euclidean setting where the use of global defining functions to construct barriers hl 2 theorem 5 12 makes this extension more difficult see rs proposition 7 3 10 4 1 weak boundary convexity let u m be a bounded domain and let u denote the boundary of u considered as a manifold with corners definition 4 1 1 the boundary component ui is called strictly f convex if for each x ui ui is strictly f convex at x in the sense of definition a 7 1 definition 4 1 2 let c 0 u be consistent a subsolution of the f dirichlet problem for u is a function u f u usc u such that u u a subsolution u for u is called maximal at p u if u p p and maximal at p if u p p definition 4 1 3 we say u is strictly f convex if we can decompose u as the disjoint union a b where a and b are unions of components and satisfy the following 1 for each p a and 0 there exists a c 0 u subsolution of the f dirichlet problem for u that is maximal at p 2 b is strictly f convex 4 2 solution of the dirichlet problem the main result of this section is the following extension of theorem a 8 1 and analogue of theorem 4 0 1 here we make the same minor technical assumption that is made for theorem a 8 1 that is we assume f u and f u both contain at least one function bounded from below theorem 4 2 1 suppose f is a subequation onm for which comparison holds let u m be a bounded domain such that u is a manifold with embedded corners and let be a consistent function on u if u is strictly f convex and strictly f convex then the f dirichlet problem for u admits a unique solution in c 0 u remark 4 2 2 by theorem a 6 1 the existence of certain subequation specific c 2 functions onm implies that comparison holds for that subequation for instance ifm carries a strictly convex c 2 function then by hl 3 theorem 9 13 comparison holds for every pure second order subequation onm thus in particular when m rn comparison holds for all pure second order subequations the proof of theorem 4 2 1 is divided into a series of smaller steps following almost exactly hl 3 section 12 definition 4 2 3 given a consistent continuous function on u consider the perron family f u usc u u u f u and u u and define the perron function u x sup u x u f to be the upper envelope of the perron family proposition 4 2 4 f let be a consistent continuous function on u and suppose u is strictly f convex at x 0 u then for each 0 small there exists w f such that i w is continuous at x 0 ii w x 0 x 0 iii w f u lemma 4 2 5 let be a consistent continuous function on u let x 0 be a point of a boundary component ui u that is strictly f convex then for each 0 small there exists w f such that i w is continuous at x 0 ii w x 0 x 0 iii w f x proof the proof of this is identical to that of hl 3 proposition f as the existence of barriers theorem a 7 2 is a purely local condition 11 clearly an analogous result holds for strictly f convex boundary components providing an element in f with the corresponding properties proof of proposition 4 2 4 this follows either by assumption or lemma 4 2 5 proposition 4 2 6 f let be a consistent continuous function on u and suppose u is strictly f convex at x 0 u then for each 0 small there exists w f such that i w is continuous at x 0 ii w x 0 x 0 iii w f u proof same as proposition 4 2 4 with an exchange of roles given a function f let usc f denote its upper semicontinuous regularization usc f lim 0 sup f y y u and d x y and let lsc f denote its lower semicontinuous regularization defined analogously lemma 4 2 7 f usc u u f u proof the proof of this is identical to that of hl 3 lemma f lemma 4 2 8 f lsc u u f u proof the proof of this is identical to that of hl 3 lemma f corollary 4 2 9 f x 0 lsc u x 0 proof this follows from proposition 4 2 4 and is essentially identical to the proof of hl 3 corollary f since w f we have w u and thus lsc w lsc u because w is continuous at x 0 and w x 0 x 0 x 0 lsc u x 0 0 small corollary 4 2 10 f usc u x 0 x 0 proof the proof of this is essentially identical to that of hl 3 corollary f take u f arbitrary since w on u this implies u w 0 on u since w f u by comparison u w 0 on u thus u w 0 on u by the continuity of w at x 0 and the fact that w x 0 x 0 we have usc u x 0 w x 0 x 0 0 small from this series of results we can draw the following conclusions 1 by corollary 4 2 9 and corollary 4 2 10 we have lsc u u usc u on u thus u is continuous on u 2 by corollary 4 2 10 and lemma 4 2 7 it follows that usc u f 3 and since usc u f this means usc u u on u thus u usc u we can now prove theorem 4 2 1 this proof is identical to that of hl 3 theorem 12 4 12 proof of theorem 4 2 1 it only remains to show that u is f harmonic by corollary 4 2 9 and lemma 4 2 8 lsc u f by conclusion 1 above lsc u u on u since u u f u lsc u u f u and u lsc u 0 on u comparison implies u lsc u 0 on u thus lsc u u and so u is f harmonic 5 solution of the dirichlet problem for the riemannian dsl in this section we seek unique continuous solutions to the dirichlet problem for the riemannian dsl our set up is the following let d m be a bounded domain with d smooth and let d 0 1 d so that d is a compact manifold with embedded corners in m r m we assume that both fc 2 d and f c 2 d contain at least one c 2 function bounded below where fc 2 is the corresponding special lagrangian subequation see section 3 theorem 5 0 1 suppose comparison holds for the riemannian dsl subequation fc on m and that d is strictly fc 2 f c 2 convex let c 0 d be consistent and affine in t when restricted to 0 1 d d consider the following hypotheses 1 c 2 and for each i 0 1 i i d c 2 d fc 2 d 2 for each i 0 1 i c 2 d fc 2 d f c 2 d if either 1 or 2 holds there exists a unique solution in c 0 d to the fc dirichlet problem for d remark 5 0 2 a the boundary assumptions hold for any d such that d is strictly convex in the sense that all of the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form ii d are strictly positive see hl 3 proposition 11 4 and example 14 9 b if m and hencem carries a strictly convex c 2 function then by hl 3 theorem 9 13 comparison holds for every pure second order subequation on m and thus for the riemannian dsl in particular if m is a complete simply connected riemannian manifold with non positive sectional curvature then the square of the distance function from a fixed point is convex and thus comparison holds taking hypothesis 2 gives theorem 1 1 4 c it may happen that m does not admit a c 2 convex function but that some d m do in this case hl 3 theorem 9 13 implies that comparison and the theorem holds for the riemannian dsl on d we prove theorem 5 0 1 by showing that d is appropriately convex and then applying theorem 4 2 1 following as closely as possible the approach in rs section 8 in lemma 5 1 1 and lemma 5 1 2 we construct subsolutions to the dsl that are maximal on various parts of the boundary these are the analogues of rs lemma 8 3 and rs lemma 8 4 respectively the proof of lemma 5 1 1 is essentially identical to that of rs lemma 8 3 note that our initial data is c 2 however the proof of rs lemma 8 4 does not carry over to a proof of lemma 5 1 2 this is due to the absence of appropriate global defining functions in the riemannian setting instead lemma 5 1 2 is proved by combining the techniques used to prove rs lemma 8 4 and hl 3 proposition f lemma 5 1 3 then uses both lemma 5 1 1 and lemma 5 1 2 to to show that d is both fc and f c strictly convex we omit its proof as it is identical to rs lemma 8 5 13 5 1 proof of theorem 5 0 1 given i c 2 d as above define vi c 0 d by v 0 0 ct v 1 1 c 1 t 19 where t is the coordinate on r lemma 5 1 1 suppose i c 2 d fc 2 d for each i 0 1 the function vi is of type fc proof suppose v 0 is not of type fc then by the definition of fc see section 2 1 there is a point t x d such that hess t x v 0 e e diag 0 hessx 0 e e c where e t e is an admissible frame near t x thus by the definition of tr tan 1 hessx 0 e e c 2 however 0 is of type fc 2 so this is a contradiction the same argument holds for v 1 lemma 5 1 2 let c 0 d be consistent and affine in t when restricted to 0 1 d let 0 and let t 0 x 0 0 1 d if d is fc 2 strictly convex then there exists a subsolution to the fc dirichlet problem for d that is maximal at t 0 x 0 proof since the boundary of d is strictly fc 2 convex at x 0 by theorem a 7 2 there exists a local defining function for d near x 0 which defines a barrier for fc 2 at x 0 that is there exists c 0 0 0 and r 0 such that in local coordinates the functions i x i x 0 c x x x 0 2 2 are strictly fc 2 subharmonic on b x 0 r for all c c 0 here we have written i to mean i d for i 0 1 by the continuity of we can shrink r 0 so that i x 0 i x on d b x 0 r let fc 2 d be bounded below and pick n sup d i supd so that n i on d choose c sufficiently large so that on b x 0 r b x 0 r 2 d i n and on b x 0 r 2 d i i x note that since is a boundary defining function it is negative inside d where defined as is affine in t along the boundary of d it follows that on 0 1 b x 0 r 2 d t x t x 0 c x x x 0 2 2 t x and on d n t x n x t x now set w t x max n then for every t w t x is equal to t x near x 0 and equal to n outside b x 0 r 2 since hess t x diag 0 hess x and hess n t x diag 0 hess n x it follows that t x and n t x are fc subharmonic thus w t x the max of two fc subharmonic functions is also of type fc by theorem a 3 1 since w t x is equal to t x near x 0 it is immediate that w t 0 x 0 t 0 x 0 lemma 5 1 3 let d and be as in theorem 5 0 1 then d is fc strictly convex and f c strictly convex proof the proof of this is essentially identical to the proof rs lemma 8 5 proof of theorem 5 0 1 combine lemma 5 1 3 and theorem 4 2 1 14 a dirichlet duality on riemannian

u c 2 x is f subharmonic if its 2 jet satisfies j 2 xu fx for all x x and strictly f subharmonic if its 2 jet satisfies j 2 xu intf x for all x x this definition extends to the larger class of upper semi continuous functions on x taking values in usc x in a viscosity like way u usc x is said to be f subharmonic if for each x x and each function which is c 2 near x one has that u near x 0 and u x

regularization v of the upper envelope v x supf f f x belongs to f x given a subset f j 2 x the dirichlet dual f of f is defined by f intf intf and a function u is f harmonic if u f x and u f x 15 a 4 local trivialization when x rn the 2 jet bundle is canonically trivialized by j 2 xu u x dxu d 2 xu where dxu u x 1 x u xn x and d 2 xu 2 u xi xj x thus for any open subset x rn there is a canonical trivialization j 2 x x r rn sym 2 rn with fibre j 2 r rn sym 2 rn the notation j r p a j 2 will be used for the coordinates on j 2 any subset f j 2 which satisfies conditions p n and t determines a euclidean subequation on any open subset x rn by setting f x f j 2 x this subequation is often referred to as just f let e e 1 en be a choice of local framing of the tangent bundle tx on some

hp haht for h gln r for each euclidean subequation f j 2 this action determines a compact invariance group g f h on h f f fix a subgroup g on a topological g structure on x is a family of smooth local trivializations of tx over open sets in a covering u of x with g valued transition functions a riemannian g manifold is a riemannian manifold equipped with a topological g structure lemma a 5 1 hl 3 lemma 5 2 suppose f is a euclidean subequation with compact invariance group g and x is a riemannian g manifold for x x the condition on a 2 jet j j 2 xu that e j u x ex u hess xu e e f is independent of the choice of g frame e at x hence there is a well defined subset f j 2 x given by j fx e j x f this subset f j 2 x is a subequation on x and will be called the riemannian g subequation on x with euclidean model f now in local coordinates x x 1 xn on x the riemannian hessian takes the following form hess u xi xj 2 u xi xj n k 1 kij x u xk where kij denote the christoffel symbols of the levi civita connection in shorthand hess u x x d 2 u x du proposition a 5 2 hl 3 proposition 5 5 let f be a riemannian g subequation on x with euclidean model f on a riemannian g manifold x suppose x x 1 xm is a local coordinate system on u and that e 1 en is an admissible g frame on u let h denote the gln valued function on u defined by e h x then a c 2 function u is f subharmonic on u if and only if u hdu h d 2 u du ht f on u 16 a 6 comparison and approximation there is a comparison and approximation theory for subequations which addresses when the sum of an f subharmonic function and an f subharmonic function satisfy the maximum principle and when an arbitrary f subharmonic function can be uniformly approximated with strictly f subharmonic functions we briefly introduce the relevant terminology and an important result comparison holds for the subequation f on x if for all compact sets k x whenever u f k and v f k the zero maximum principle holds for u v on k that is u v 0 on k u v 0 on k strict approximation holds for f on x if for each compact set k x each function u f x can be uniformly approximated by strictly f subharmonic functions on k a function u c 2 x is said to be strictly f subharmonic on x if j 2 xu int f for all x x this notion extends to upper semicontinuous functions see hl 3 definition 7 4 let fstrict x denote the set of all upper semicontinuous strictly f subharmonic functions a subset m j 2 x is a convex monotonicity cone for f if m is a convex cone with vertex at the origin and f m f theorem a 6 1 hl 3 theorem 10 3 suppose f is a riemannian g subequation on a manifold x if x supports a c 2 strictly m subharmonic function where m is a monotonicity cone for f then comparison holds for f on x a 7 boundary convexity and barriers recall the canonical decomposition j 2 x r j 2 red x with fibre coordinates j r j 0 a subequation of the form r f with f j 2 red x is referred to as a reduced subequation or a subequation independent of the r variable given a subequation f j 2 red x independent of the r variable the asymptotic interior f of f is the set of all j j 2 red x for which there exists a neighborhood n j in the total space of j 2 red x and a number t 0 0 such that t n j f for all t t 0 let be a domain in x with smooth boundary a defining function for is a smooth function defined on a neighborhood of such that x x 0 d 6 0 on and 0 on for x j 2 x 0 j 2 red x so we use the notation j 2 x j 2 red x given a reduced subequation f on x with asymptotic interior f and x a smoothly bounded domain the is called strictly f convex at x if there exists a local defining function for near x such that j 2 x fx if this holds at every point x then boundary is strictly f convex for general subequations boundary convexity is defined as follows given any subequation f j 2 x there is a family of reduced subequations f j 2 red x r defined by f f j 2 red x definition a 7 1 hl 3 definition 11 10 given a general subequation f j 2 x and a domain x with smooth boundary we say that is strictly f convex at a point x if is strictly f convex at x for each r the boundary is called globally f convex if it is f convex at every x the importance of boundary convexity is that it implies the existence of barrier functions at boundary points let x be a smooth domain and let be a local defining function for near x 0 then given any r defines a barrier for f at x 0 if there exists c 0 0 0 and r 0 0 such that the function x c x x x 0 2 2 20 17 is strictly f subharmonic on b x 0 r 0 for all c c 0 if f is a reduced subequation then we say that defines a barrier for f at x 0 since the same works for all r the following result hl 3 theorem 11 12 connects boundary convexity to the existence of barriers theorem a 7 2 existence of barriers suppose x is a domain with smooth boundary which is strictly f convex at x 0 then for each r there exists a local defining defining function for near x 0 which defines a barrier for f at x 0 a 8 solution of the dirichlet problem let x then g r is said to solve the f dirichlet problem on for boundary values if a g c b g is f harmonic on c g on given c define the perron family f u ucs u f and u and the perron function u x sup u x u f assuming that both fstrict and f strict contain at least one function bounded below this assumption is minor see hl 3 section 12 harvey lawson prove the following theorem a 8 1 hl 3 theorem 13 3 assume comparison holds for the subequation f on x and the domain x has smooth boundary if is both f and f strictly convex then for each c the perron function
