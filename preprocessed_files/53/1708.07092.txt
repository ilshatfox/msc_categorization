assume 1 p q in this paper we consider the following p th yamabe type equation pu hu q 1 fu 1 on g where p is the p th discrete graph laplacian h 0 and f 0 are real functions defined on all vertices of g instead of the approach in 12 we adopt a new approach and prove that the above equation always has a positive solution u 0 for some constant r in particular when q p our result generalizes the main theorem in 12 from the case of p 1 to the case of 1 p it s interesting that our new approach can also work in the case of p 1 1 introduction as is known that let mm g be a closed riemannian manifold of dimension m 3 the yamabe problem consists of finding metrics of constant scalar curvature in g fg f m r 0 the conformal class of g a metric g f pm 2 g conformal to g has constant scalar curvature s r if and only if the positive function f satisfies the yamabe equation corresponding to g am gf sgf sf pm 2 where g denotes the laplace beltrami operator corresponding to g and sg denotes the scalar curvature of g am 4 m 1 m 2 pm 2 m m 2 is the sobolev critical exponent in the case of closed manifolds it was proved that at least one solution exists following a program introduced by h yamabe in 20 solutions of the yamabe equations are the first author is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11431003 the second author is supported by the national

conformal class of g s g m sgd g v ol m g 2 pm this problem was also studied by trudinger 18 aubin 1 and completely solved by schoen 17 recently there are tremendous work concerning the discrete weighted laplacians and various equations on graphs among those we refer readers to 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 19 particularly there have been some works on dealing with yamabe type equations on graphs on which please refer to 8 9 12 13 grigor yan lin and yang 9 first studied a yamabe type equation on a finite graph as follows u hu u 2 u 2 1 1 where is a usual discrete graph laplacian and h is a positive function defined on the vertices they show that the equation 1 1 always has a positive solution inspired by their work ge 12 studied a yamabe type equation on a finite graph that is pu hu p 1 fu 1 1 2 we state the main result in 12 as follows theorem 1 1 let g v e be a finite connected graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume p 1 then the following p th yamabe equation pu hu p 1 fu 1 on g always has a positive solution u for some constant r from this result one naturally wants to know problem i can one solve the p th yamabe equation 1 2 for 1 p to answer this question is our main purpose of this paper remark 1 ge and jiang 13 also studied a following yamabe type equation pu hu p 1 gu 1 u 0 on an infinite graph the main result in 13 is as follows 2 theorem 1 2 consider the p th yamabe equation 1 2 on a connected infinite and locally finite graph g with p 2 assume g 0 and g is bounded from above h satisfies infx v h x 0 and infx v h x x 0 further assume h 1 l v for some 0 or h x when x then 1 2 has a positive solution from this result one still needs to know can one solve this p th yamabe equation 1 2 under the assumption 2 p we will solve this problem in our another paper 21 next note that grigor yan lin and yang s pioneer paper 9 also studied a similar yamabe type equation as follows pu h u p 2 u f x u p 1 1 3 on a finite graph under the assumption h 0 they show that the equation 1 3 always has a positive solution under certain assumptions about f x u it is remarkable that their p considered in the equation 1 3 is different from ours when p 6 2 if we replace the p th laplacian p in equation 1 2 with p in equation 1 3 then we can ask problem ii do positive solutions of the p th yamabe equation 1 2 still exist in this paper we attempt to solve both problems above on a finite graph the answers turn out be interesting in fact we can prove that the equation 1 2 actually has a positive solution u 0 in the case of 1 p note that ge s approach in 12 can t succeed in solving problem i any more so we have to adopt a new approach let s outline our approach to solution of problem i first we study the following yamabe type equation pu hu q 1 fu 1 in the case of 1 p q note that in this equation we add a new constant and extend exponents of the second term from p to any integer q satisfying q p in order to study the equation above we have to make a transformation as pu fu 1 huq 1 otherwise our derivation can t go on then by using the constrained minimization tech nique we can prove that for any constant r the equation above actually has a positive solution u 0 at least for some constant r 3 then set 0 we can construct a positive function u u u depending on u by using the scaling technique in fact we can prove that this function u u u is exactly a positive solution of the yamabe type equation pu hu q 1 fu 1 for some constant u note that here the constant added in previous equation disappear at all which highly depends on the condition 1 p q finally take q p we completely solve problem i the key point of our approach is the assumption 1 p q in fact our approach is still successful in the case of 1 q p where taking q p particularly we can get the main theorem in 12 in this respect we find that our approach is more generic as for problem ii we observe that the difference between the two p th laplacian p in equation 1 2 and in equation 1 3 is not essential therefore we can similarly prove that equation 1 2 actually has a positive solution we organize this paper as follows in section 2 we introduce some notions on graphs and state our main results in section 3 we give sobolev imbedding section 4 is devoted to prove an important theorem which is key to solve both problems above in section 5 we completely solve problem i and problem ii 2 settings and main results let g v e be a finite graph where v denotes the vertex set and e denotes the edge set fix a vertex measure v 0 and an edge measure e 0 on g the edge measure is assumed to be symmetric that is ij ji for each edge i j denote c v as the set of all real functions defined on v then c v is a finite dimensional linear space with the usual function additions and scalar multiplications for any p 1 the p th discrete graph laplacian p c v c v is pfi 1 i j i ij fj fi p 2 fj fi for any f c v and i v p is a nonlinear operator when p 6 2 see 12 for more properties about p now we can state an important theorem as follows theorem 2 1 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume 1 p q then for any constant r the following p th yamabe equation pu hu q 1 fu 1 2 1 4 on g always has a positive solution u 0 for some constant r if we want to get rid off then we have theorem 2 2 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume 1 p q then the following p th yamabe equation pu hu q 1 fu 1 2 2 on g always has a positive solution u 0 for some constant r this theorem actually generalizes the problem i and gives a positive answer as a corollary let s take q p we get the following corollary 2 3 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume 1 p then the following p th yamabe equation pu hu p 1 fu 1 on g always has a positive solution u 0 for some constant r this corollary completely solves problem i further combining this corollary with theorem 1 1 we have corollary 2 4 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume p 1 1 then the following p th yamabe equation pu hu p 1 fu 1 on g always has a positive solution u for some constant r next we consider the p th laplacian p please refer to 9 in equation 1 3 which is defined in distributional sense by v pu d v u p 2 u d cc v 2 3 where cc v denotes the set of all functions with compact support obviously cc v c v when g is a finite graph u u are defined respectively by u i 1 2 i j i ij uj ui j i i v 2 4 and u i u u i i v 2 5 5 point wisely p can be written as pui 1 2 i j i u p 2 j u p 2 i ij uj ui i v 2 6 applying this p th laplacian p we can study the p th yamabe equation pu hu p 1 fu 1 again and we obtain theorem 2 5 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume p 1 1 then the following p th yamabe equation pu hu p 1 fu 1 on g always has a positive solution u 0 for some constant r 3 sobolev embedding for any f c v define the integral of f over v with respect to the vertex weight by v fd i v ifi set vol g v d for any f c v define v f pd i j ij fj fi p 3 1 where f is defined as fi 1 2 i j i ij fj fi p 1 p i v 3 2 next we consider the sobolev space w 1 p on the graph g define w 1 p g u c v v u pd v u pd and u w 1 p g v u pd v u pd 1 p since g is a finite graph then w 1 p g is exactly c v a finite dimensional linear space this implies the following sobolev embedding 12 6 lemma 3 1 sobolev embedding let g v e be a finite graph the sobolev space w 1 p g is pre compact namely if n is bounded in w 1 p g then there exists some w 1 p g such that up to a subsequence n in w 1 p g remark 2 the convergence in w 1 p g is in fact pointwise convergence 4 proof of theorem 2 1 in this section we focus on proving theorem 2 1 frist we consider a constrained mini mization problem for the following energy functional e u 1 p v u pd v fu d 4 1 on the space c v restricted to the subset m u c v 1 q v huqd 1 define inf u m e u u 0 u 6 0 we will find a positive solution of the equation 2 1 step by step as follows step 1 e u is bounded below let s first prove the following two lemmas lemma 4 1 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 assume 1 p q u m u 0 then we have the following inequalities u qq q h m u q q h m q 4 2 where h m min i v hi proof u m u 0 and h 0 we have q v huqd h m v uqd h m u q q hence u qq q h m u q q h m q 7 lemma 4 2 let g v e be a connected finite graph given f c v with f 0 assume 1 p q u c v u 0 then we have the following inequality 0 v fu d fmvol g 1 q u q 4 3 where fm max i v fi and vol g v d proof u c v u 0 and f 0 by ho lder inequality we have v fu d fm 1 u 1 fm 1 q q u q fmvol g 1 q u q now we can prove that the energy functional e u is bounded below for all u 0 u 6 0 hence infu m e u u 0 u 6 0 and r theorem 4 3 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume 1 p then for u m u 0 then the energy functional e u is bounded below by a constant namely we have the following inequality e u c q h f g 4 4 where c q h f g fm q h m q vol g 1 q 0 is a constant depending only on the information of q h f g proof combining the two lemmas above we have v fu d fmvol g 1 q u q fmvol g 1 q q h m q hence e u v fu d fm q h m q vol g 1 q step 2 there exists a u 0 u 6 0 such that e u to find such u we choose un m un 0 satisfying e un as n and v huqnd q further we can assume e un 1 for all n then we have 8 theorem 4 4 let g v e be a connected finite graph given h f c v with h 0 f 0 assume 1 p q let un satisfy the above conditions then un is bounded in w 1 p g in fact we have the following estimate un w 1 p g c p q h f g where c p q h f g p 1 p fm q h m q vol g 1 q q h m p qvol g 1 p q is a constant depending only on the information of p q h f g proof observe that the sobolev norm w 1 p g is related to the energy functional e u then by 4 2 and 4 3 we get un w 1 p g v un pd v un pd p 1 p v u pd v fu d p v fu d v un pd pe un p v fu d un p qvol g 1 p q p 1 p fm q h m q vol g 1 q q h m p qvol g 1 p q c p q h f g therefore un is bounded in w 1 p g then by lemma 3 1 there exists some u w 1 p g c v such that up to a subsequence un u in w 1 p g we may also denote this subsequence as un note un 0 and v hu q nd q let n we know u 0 and v hu qd q 6 0 hence u m this also implies that u 6 0 since g is finite graph by remark 2 the convergence in the sobolev space w 1 p g is in fact pointwise convergence moreover because g is a finite graph so the energy functional e u is actually continuous which yields that e u attains its infimum exactly at the point u m therefore we have e u step 3 u 0 u 6 0 is exactly a nontrivial solution of the yamabe type equation 2 1 9 recall the constrained minimization problem for the following energy functional e u 1 p v u pd v fu d on the space c v restricted to the subset m u c v 1 q v huqd 1 now we derive the euler lagrange equations by the lagrange multiplier rule first set g u 1 q v huqd 1 it is easy to see that both e u and g u are continuously fre chet differentiable and the fre chet derivatives de u dg u are respectively given by v de u v u p 1 v fu 1 v d v pu fu 1 vd v c v and v dg u v huq 1 vd v c v then let t e u tv g u tv v c v by direct calculation we have d t dt t 0 v de u dg u v pu fu 1 huq 1 vd therefore if u is a critical point with regard to the above constrained minimization prob lem then u satisfies the following euler lagrange equations v pu fu 1 huq 1 vd 0 v c v in particular the infimum point u satisfies the euler lagrange equations v pu fu 1 hu q 1 vd 0 v c v 4 5 this implies u 0 is a nontrivial solution of the yamabe type equation 2 1 pu fu 1 hu q 1 0 10 moreover we can deduce the formula of inserting v u into the equality 4 5 yields that v u p fu hu q d v u p fu d q 0 thus can be given by u 1 q v u p fu d 4 6 step 4 u 0 recall that t e u tv g u tv then by direct calculation we have ui i pui fiu 1 i hu q 1 i 4 7 note the graph g is connected if u 0 is not satisfied since u 0 and not identically zero then there is an edge i j such that u i 0 but u j 0 then by the definition of the p th laplacian p in section 2 we have pu i 1 i k i ik u k u i p 2 u k u i 0 therefore by 4 7 we have ui u u i pu i 0 recall we had proved that u is the minimum value of hence there should be ui u u 0 which is a contradiction hence u 0 this completes the proof of theorem 2 1 5 proofs of theorem 2 2 and theorem 2 5 5 1 proofs of theorem 2 2 now we can prove theorem 2 2 by theorem 2 1 11 first choose any negative constant 0 and assume that h f c v with h 0 f 0 1 p q then consider the following p th yamabe equation pu hu q 1 fu 1 5 1 by theorem 2 1 we know that this equation on g always has a positive solution u 0 for some constant r equivalently the solution u 0 satisfies v pu f u 1 hu q 1 vd 0 v c v 5 2 next using this positive solution u 0 we will construct a positive solution u u u 0 of the the p th yamabe equation v pu fu 1 huq 1 vd 0 v c v 5 3 recall that 0 f 0 u 0 hence by the formula 4 6 we have 1 q v u p f u d 0 then scaling with a suitable power of we set u s su thus u su s substitute it into the equation 5 2 0 v pu f u 1 hu q 1 vd v u p 1 v f u 1 v hu q 1 v d v s p 1 u s p 1 v s 1 fu s 1 v 1 s q 1 hu s q 1 v d s p 1 v pu s s p fu s 1 1 s q p hu s q 1 vd let 1 s q p 0 thus s 1 q p then set u u u u s s 1 q p 1 q p u s p s 1 q p p q p 12 by the equality above we obtain that v c v v pu fu 1 huq 1 vd p 1 q p v pu f u 1 hu q 1 vd 0 which implies pu hu q 1 fu 1 finally by u 0 0 we conclude that u 1 q p u 0 this completes the proof of theorem 2 2 5 2 proofs of theorem 2 5 to prove theorem 2 5 first we observe that the unique difference between problem i and problem ii is the definition of p therefore the proof in this case is totally similar we only sketch the idea of the proof here first we define the sobolev form w 1 p and the integration f u v u pd in energy functional by using definitions 2 4 and 2 5 u i u u i u i 1 2 i j i ij uj ui j i i v 5 4 then we can use this u to define energy functional as follows for p we can define energy functional similarly as in 12 i u v u pd v hupd v fu d p 5 5 and for p our energy functional 4 1 is similarly defined by e u 1 p v u pd v fu d on the space c v also restricted to the subset m u c v 1 q v huqd 1 note that f u v u pd in definitions of two energy functionals above is contin uously fre chet differentiable by the proof of theorem 5 in 9 the fre chet derivatives df u is given by v df u v pu vd v c v 5 6 13 where p is exactly the p th laplacian p in 2 6 this equality is key to guarantee that all of proofs in this paper and in 12 can be generalized in this case this can be checked explicitly for two cases p p step by step acknowledgements the first author would like to thank professor yanxun chang for
