fs denote the fubini study k hler metric on pn relative to some hermitian metric we set fs x let denote the mabuchi energy of x we recall the following comparison theorem which gives a complete description of the mabuchi energy restricted to the space bn of bergman metrics associated to the embedding xn pn theorem 21 let xn pn be a smooth linearly normal complex projective variety of degree d 2 let rx denote the x resultant and let x denote the x hyperdiscriminant then there is a constant c depending only on d n and such that d 2 n 1 deg rx log x 2 x 2 deg x log rx 2 rx 2 c for all sl n 1 c remark 1 our whole approach to the stability conjectures rests on the fact that in the comparison theorem the mabuchi energy is scaled by d 2 remark 2 bernd sturmfels calls our x the hurwitz form of x pn and denotes this polynomial by hux in 24 this is certainly better terminology and notation than ours in the inequality above denotes the standard l 2 norm on homogeneous poly nomials although this was never stated explicitly earlier work of tian see 26 lemma 8 7 pg 32 and the author and tian see 20 proposition 4 3 pg 2576 provides a rather large upper bound for this constant c 2 exp d the best constant on the right hand side of can be expressed in terms of hf x the faltings height of x and a new height which we denote by h x definitions are in the sections that follow for now we remark that the height is a real number that can be attached 1 to any reasonably smooth linearly normal complex subvariety v of pn proposition 1 1 the optimal constant c is given by c sup g deg hf x deg r h x 1 1 a proof of this statement can be extracted from proposition 4 1 on page 277 of 21 a much better conceptual explanation for it s appearance which proves much more can be found in the more recent article 22 for any normal v pn of dimension n there are bounds deg rv n 1 n 1 j 1 1 j hf v 0 deg v n n 1 j 1 1 j h v 0 1 the height requires a hermitian metric for its definition number theorists also require that v be defined over a number field we do not assume this heights 3 this follows at once from the well known explicit expression for the scalar green s function of pn for the fubini study metric the cauchy schwarz inequality brings down the value of the constant c in by several orders of magnitude c d 2 log d o d 2 for d n however even this bound should certainly not be the best as it completely ignores the scaling and the sign difference in 1 1 to probe for a more accurate bound we remark that the limit 0 lim t 0 t exists for any t sl n 1 c t where we have defined the height discrepancy by deg hf x deg r h x below we show that for generic t we have the following proposition 1 2 0 o d 2 this suggests that the true bound on the height discrepancy is o d 2 the importance of this bound is brought out in the following theorem theorem 1 1 let x l be a polarized manifold let h be a hermitian metric on l with positive curvature assume that x l satisfies then x l is asymptotically stable if and only if the mabuchi energy is proper onh x l is asymptotically semistable if and only if the mabuchi energy is bounded below onh a variational characterization of the existence of a k hler einstein metric on a fano manifold is provided by the following theorem of gang tian theorem 1 2 g tian 26 let x be a fano manifold with c 1 x assume that aut x is finite then x admits a k hler einstein metric if and only if the mabuchi energy is proper an important development in k hler geometry is the following theorem of jinguri cheng and xiuxiong chen which generalizes theorem 1 2 to any k hler class theorem 1 3 x x chen j cheng 8 9 10 let x be a compact k hler manifold then the mabuchi energy is proper modulo automorphisms of x if any onh if and only if there is a metric of constant scalar curvature in the class the main result of this paper is the following corollary corollary 1 1 let x l be a polarized manifold satisfying assume that aut x l is finite then x l is asymptotically stable if and only if there is a constant scalar curvature metric in c 1 l 4 sean timothy paul we show that together with the condition of asymptotic stability allows us to take the limit in of high powers of l and invoke tian s density theorem see 25 the precise definition of asymptotic stability of a polarized manifold is given below the author s definition of stability is quite different 2 from the many variations of k stability that appear in the literature from the author s point of view stability is not necessarialy concerned with a variety in a projective space stability is a property that a pair of non zero vectors in a pair of finite dimensional complex representations of an algebraic group may or may not possess as we shall explain the stability of a projective variety is a special case of this situation moreover test configurations do not play a direct part in our definition of stability they are rather considered as a means to check stability this is exactly how one parameter subgroups are used in hilbert and mumford s geometric invariant theory 2 semistability of pairs let g denote any of the classical linear reductive algebraic groups over c specifically g can be taken to be any one of the following sl n 1 so 2 n so 2 n 1 sp n primarily we will be interested in the case when g is the special linear group for any vector space v and any v v 0 we let v p v denote the line through v if v is a g module then we can consider the projective orbit ov g v p v we let ov denote the zariski closure of this orbit we consider pairs e e such that e is a finite dimensional complex g module and the linear span of the orbit g e coincides with e the cornerstone of the author s approach to the stability conjectures is the following generalization of mumford s geometric invari ant theory the only explicit reference to the definition known to the author is 23 the motivation seems to the problem of decomposing the symmetric power of an irreducible representation of gl n c it is rather mysterious that the same definition appears 3 when one seeks to bound from below the mabuchi energy restricted to the space of bergman metrics definition 1 u u dominates w w in which case we write u u w w if and only if there exists hom u w g such that u w and the induced rational map p u 99 k p w restricts to a regular finite map ou ow between the zariski closures of the orbits observe that the restriction of the map to ou is regular if and only if the following holds ou p ker as the reader can easily check whenever u u w w it follows that u w and u ker w g module splitting 2 as the reader will see the definition of stability used in this article is essentially a mutatis mutandis extension of mumford s definition in 18 3 the author was led to the same definition independently see stable pair below heights 5 therefore we may identify with projection onto w and u decomposes as follows v u w ker 3 u 6 0 again the reader can easily check that is equivalent to o u w ou zariski closure in p ker w we summarize this discussion in the following way given v and w two g represen tations with nonzero points v and w respectively we consider as before the projective orbits 4 ovw g v w p v w ov g v 0 p v 0 now we can give the definition of a semistable pair this definition seems the most ap propriate for the stability conjectures 5 as it gives precise estimates on the mabuchi energy restricted to the space of bergman metrics definition 2 the pair v w is semistable if and only if ovw ov the relationship of this with mumford s geometric invariant theory is brought out in the following example example 1 let v c be the trivial one dimensional representation and let v 1 suppose w is any representation of g and let w w 0 then 1 w is a semistable pair if and only if 0 g w w remark 3 the semistability of the pair v w depends only on v w the reader should also observe that the definition is not symmetric in v andw in virtually all examples where the pair v w is semistable w v is not semistable 2 1 numerical semistability if the pair v w is semistable then obviously we have t v w t v 0 2 1 for all algebraic tori t of g and we may as well assume and we do that t is maximal in this section we relate semistability to lattice polytopes to begin we letmz be the character lattice of t mz homz t c as usual the dual lattice is denoted by nz it is well known that u nz corresponds to an algebraic one parameter subgroup of t these are algebraic homomorphisms c t the correspondence is given by nz mz z m u m m mz we introduce associated real vector spaces by extending scalars mr mz z r nr nz z r then the one parameter subgroups of t may be viewed as integral linear functionals l mr r 4 we do not assume anything about the linear spans of the orbits 5 the yau tian donaldson conjecture s 6 sean timothy paul any rational representation e decomposes under the action of t into weight spaces e a a ea ea e e t e a t t t a denotes the t support of e a a mz ea 6 0 given e e 0 the projection of e into ea is denoted by ea the support of any nonzero vector v is then defined by a e a a va 6 0 definition 3 let t be any maximal torus in g let e e 0 the weight polytope of e is the compact convex lattice polytope n e given by n e conv a e mr where conv denotes convex hull definition 4 let e be a rational representation of g let be any 1 psg of t the weight w e of on e e 0 is the integer w e minx n e l x min a a a e alternatively w e is the unique integer such that lim t 0 t w e t e exists in e and is not zero next given d n and a a recall that the t semi invariants p cd e a t of degree d are characterized by p e a p e for all t proposition 2 1 let t be a maximal algebraic torus of g and let v and w two finite dimensional rational g modules then the following are equivalent 1 t v w t v 0 2 n v n w 3 w v w w for all 1 psg s c t 4 for every a v there is an f cd v w td such that f v w 6 0 and f v 0 in order to define a strictly stable henceforth stable pair we need a large but fixed integer m and the auxiliary left regular representation of g g gl n 1 c 3 a a heights 7 recall that gl n 1 c is the vector space of square matrices of sizen 1 the action is matrix multiplication the standardn simplex denoted byqn is defined to be the weight polytope of the identity operator i gl n 1 c qn is full dimensional and contains the origin in its strict interior 0 qn n i mr let v be a g module we define the degree of v as follows deg v min k z 0 n v kqn for all 0 6 v v for any v v w w and m n we define vm v m v m wm 1 w m 1 w m 1 iq i q gl n 1 c q finally we can give the definition of a stable pair definition 5 the pair v w is stable if and only if there is a positive integer m such that iq vm wm 1 is semistable where q denotes the degree of v 2 2 finite dimensional energies next we endow v and w with hermitian norms using these norms we introduce the finite dimensional mabuchi and aubin functionals v w log w 2 w 2 log v 2 v 2 jv deg v log 2 n 1 log v 2 v 2 definition 6 the mabuchi energy of the pair v w is proper if and only if there are constants 0 and b such that v w jv b for all g the following proposition relates the behavior of the energy with the semistability of the pair despite its simplicity it is at the heart of the author s approach to the stability conjectures in k hler geometry proposition 2 2 the pair v w is semistable if and only if the mabuchi energy v w is bounded below and it is stable if and only if the mabuchi energy is proper proof observe that inf g v w log tan 2 dist ovw ov where dist denotes the distance in the fubini study metric associated to the norms on v and w 8 sean timothy paul we end this section with a direct comparison of mumford s stability and the author s stability of pairs observe that the left hand column of the table below arises from the right when we take v c the trivial one dimensional representation and v 1 mumford s g i t pairs for all t g d z 0 and for all t g and a v f c d w t such that d z 0 and f cd v w td f w 6 0 and f 0 0 such that f v w 6 0 and f v 0 0 g w ovw ov w w 0 w w

semistable 3 stability of projective varieties fix l cn 1 dim l n 1 n 1 choose l n satisfying 0 l n consider the zariski open subset u of the grassmannian defined by u e g n l cn 1 h 0 e l e l cn 1 l 0 0 observe that e u if and only if dim l e n n by the rank plus nullity theorem we have that for any e g n l cn 1 dim e l dim l e n l therefore e u if and only if dim e l n l motivated by this we define a subvariety z l of our grassmannian by z l g n l cn 1 u e g r cn 1 dim e l n l 1 now we apply the previous linear algebra to a projective variety xn pn recall that for any p x that the embedded tangent space to x at p is the n dimensional projective heights 9 linear subspace tp x g n pn obtained for example by projectivizing the tangent space the the cone over x at any point v cn 1 0 lying over p given any 0 l n we define the following subvariety zl 1 x of the grassmannian by zl 1 x e g n l 1 pn p x e and dim e tp x n l generally zl 1 x has codimension one in g n l 1 pn to make the defining polynomial of zl 1 x concrete we view the grassmannian in primal stiefel coordinates 24 by observing that there is a dominant map 6 m o l 1 n 1 3 a ker a g n l 1 p n we may then consider the divisor also denoted by zl 1 x 1 zl 1 x m l 1 n 1 our new zl 1 x is now an irreducible algebraic hypersurface in the affine space m l 1 n 1 and hence is cut out by a single polynomial fl 1 zl 1 x aij m l 1 n 1 fl 1 aij 0 we should point out that 7 zl 1 x is dominated by the variety of zeros of a larger sys tem ix in more variables p x where x is an auxiliary projective variety naturally associated to x ix p aij x m l 1 n 1 sk p aij 0 1 k m the situation can be visualized as follows ix 2 ix x m l 1 n 1 2 zl 1 x m l 1 n 1 in geometric terms p aij ix if and only if ker aij fails to meet x generically at p and possibly at some other point q zl 1 x is therefore the resultant system obtained by eliminating the variable p from ix since x is projective zl 1 x is a subvariety of m l 1 n 1 see 13 27 22 3 1 resultants let xn pn be an irreducible n dimensional linearly normal com plex projective variety of degree d definition 7 cayley 1840 s the associated hypersurface to xn pn is given by zn 1 x l g n n 1 n l x 6 6 the superscript o denotes matrices of maximal rank 7 the height discrepancy arises naturally from this point of view 10 sean timothy paul as we have remarked it is known that zn 1 x enjoys the following properties i zn 1 x is a divisor in g n n 1 n and hence m n 1 n 1 ii zn 1 x is irreducible iii deg zn 1 x d d n 1 in steifel coordinates therefore there exists rx h 0 g n n 1 n o d such that rx 0 zn 1 x rx is the cayley chow form of x modulo scaling rx is unique following the termi nology of gelfan d 13 we call rx the x resultant from our dual steifel point of view we will always view rx as a polynomial 8 in the matrix entries rx cd n 1 m n 1 n 1 sl n 1 c 3 2 hyperdiscriminants assume that x pn has degree d 2 let xsm denote the smooth points of x for p xsm let tp x be the embedded tangent space to x at p definition 8 the dual variety of x denoted by x is the zariski closure of the set of tangent hyperplanes to x at its smooth points x f pn tp x ker f p xsm generally x is codimension one in pn this holds for example whenever x is a nonlinear projective curve or surface observe that we have the identity x z 1 x for the purposes of understanding the mabuchi energy what is important is not the dual variety x but the variety zn x observe that like the cayley divisor and the dual variety zn x also has a simple geometric description zn x l g n n pn l x 6 deg x it is known that zn x enjoys the following properties i zn x is a divisor in g n n n and hence mn n 1 ii zn x is irreducible iii deg zn x n n 1 d d in steifel coordinates therefore there exists x h 0 g n n n o n 1 d d n such that x 0 zn x 8 it is necessarialy invariant under the natural action of sl n 1 c heights 11 modulo scaling x is unique inspired by the terminology of gelfan d we call x the x hyperdiscriminant from our primal steifel point of view we will always view x as a polynomial 9 in the appropriate matrix entries x cn n 1 d d mn n 1 sl n c we summarize these constructions in the following proposition proposition 3 1 let xn pn be a smooth linearly normal complex projective variety there exists dominant integral weights with corresponding irreducible g modules e e and g equivariant associations x rx e n 1 n 1 deg rx deg rx deg rx n n 0 0 x x e n n deg x deg x deg x n 1 n 0 0 of course in the above proposition we know that e cd n 1 m n 1 n 1 sl n 1 c e cn n 1 d d mn n 1 sl n c for our purpose we must normalize the degrees so to speak of these polynomials from this point on we are interested in the pair r rx deg x x deg rx now we are prepared to make the following definition definition 9 let x pn be a smooth irreducible linearly normal complex projective variety then x is semistable if and only if the pair r is semistable for the action of g explicitly the orbit closures are disjoint or or now we introduce asymptotic semistability of a polarized manifold x l we require an auxiliary hermitian metric h on l with positive curvature h the definition of asymp totic semistability is independent in the obvious way of which h is chosen below both r and have been scaled to unit length definition 10 a polarized manifold x l is asymptotically semistable if and only if there is a uniform constant c c h such that dist or or exp cd 2 3 1 for all sufficiently large lk embeddings of degree d kn it should be emphasized that the orbit closures must be disjoint for all powers of l otherwise the mabuchi energy is unbounded from below and no canonical metric exists asymptotic semistability not only requires orbit closure separation for each embedding but crucially that the orbit closures are not allowed to approach one another too quickly as the degree of the embedding increases 9 it is necessarialy invariant under the natural action of sl n c 12 sean timothy paul definition 11 let x pn be a smooth irreducible linearly normal complex projective variety then x is stable if and only if the pair r is stable for the action of g explicitly there is an integer m such that the pair iq r m 1 m is semistable for the action of g and q deg rx deg x again we must equip l with a hermitian metric as above definition 12 a polarized manifold x l is asymptotically stable if and only if there are uniform constants m z 0 and c c h m such that dist o v w ov exp ck 2 n 1 3 2 for all sufficiently large k the power of the embedding v w iq r km 1 km remark 4 as in the definition of asymptotic semistability bothr and have been scaled so that both v and w are of unit length the reader should observe that the speeds of approach in the definitions and asymptotic stability and semistability differ by a single factor of k 4 heights of polynomials and igusa local zeta functions let p z 0 z 1 zn be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d on cn 1 equip cn 1 with it s standard hermitian metric z w z 0 w 0 zn w n this in turn induces the fubini study k hler metric fs on pn as well as a hermitian metric hdfs on all tensor powers o d of the hyperplane bundle we may view p as a section of this bundle p h 0 pn o d and we define the l 2 norm of p in the usual way p 2 pn p 2 hd fs nfs recall that the pointwise norm of p is given by p 2 hd fs z 0 zn p z 0 zn 2 z 0 2 z 1 2 zn 2 d definition 13 the height of p is defined to be the real number given by h p log p 2 pn log p 2 hd fs nfs we remark that h is a function on p h 0 pn o d heights 13 proposition 4 1 see lemma 8 7 from 26 the function p h 0 pn o d 3 p h p is h lder continuous and moreover sat isfies the explicit bounds d n 1 j 1 1 j h p 0 the space of matrices can be equipped with the standard hermitian inner product in duced by the fubini study metric on pn therefore we may introduce two height functions of x pn definition 14 see 6 the faltings height of x pn is the height of the cayley form hf x log rx 2 pm n 1 n 1 log rx 2 h deg r fs n 1 n 1 fs similarly we introduce another height function of a projective variety definition 15 h x denotes the height of the hyperdiscriminant h x log x 2 pmn n 1 log x 2 h deg fs n n 1 fs given two heights it is natural and in our case absolutely necessary to compare them definition 16 the height discrepancy x of x pn is the real number given by x deg hf x deg r h x as the reader might imagine if it were easy to compute the height then all of our trou bles would be over unfortunately direct computation is quite difficult even for relatively simple polynomials to partially address this issue we introduce the local zeta functions of the title the author learned of this point of view from an article of v maillot and j cassaigne 7 definition 17 let p cd z 0 z 1 zn and s c have s 0 the igusa sato local zeta function z p s attached to p is n 1 ds n 1 z p s cn 1 e z 2 p z 2 s dv n 1 work of atiyah gelfan d and bernstein and bernstein 1 5 4 shows thatz p s extends to a holomorphic function of s admits a meromorphic extension to all of c and satisfies a functional equation the relationship between heights and zeta functions is given by h p logz p 1 z p 0 as we have remarked the explicit determination 10 of the zeta function for a general homogeneous polynomial f seems to be out of reach however there are some special poly nomials whose local zeta functions can be described in terms gamma factors namely sato s relative invariants of prehomogeneous vector spaces 15 this is possible because their bernstein sato polynomials bf s are all known we need the simplest relative invariant 10 unlike the situation over a p adic field it is not clear what explicit determinantion means 14 sean timothy paul proposition 4 2 for the proof see 14 mn c e i j zij 2 det zij 2 s dv n 2 1 2 ns n k 1 2 s k k now we may compute the local zeta function of the maximal minors detn 1 cn 1 mn 1 n 1 detn cn mn n 1 by definition we have that z detn 1 s n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 s m n 1 n 1 e i j zij 2 detn 1 zij 2 s n 1 n 1 dv n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 s m n 1 n 1 e i j zij 2 detn 1 zij 2 s n 1 2 dv n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 n 1 s 1 2 s n 1 n 1 k 1 2 s k k therefore we can determine the zeta functions explicitly a bs 2 s n 1 z detn 1 s a n 1 k 1 2 s k k s 2 snz detn s n k 1 2 s k k a n 1 n 1 n n 1 b n 1 n differentiating these identities we have b a a n 1 log 2 a z detn 1 0 2 a n 1 k 1 k k therefore we see that z detn 1 0 b a a n 1 log 2 2 n 1 k 1 k k z detn 0 n log 2 2 n k 1 k k heights 15 therefore z detn 1 0 n 1 n 1 n 1 1 k 1 1 k o 1 n 1 log d o 1 as d similarly we see that z detn 0 n log d o 1 as d next we compute the l 2 norms log a deg r deg r log 2 logz detn 1 d log a n 1 log 2 d o 1 log deg deg log 2 logz detn deg n log n log 2 deg n o 1 asymptotics of the gamma function give at once that logz detn 1 d deg r log d o d as d logz detn deg n deg log d o d as d now we may address the issue of bounding the height discrepancy of a givenx pn where n deg x are large let t t be a generic algebraic one parameter sub group of sl n 1 c generic means that lies in some t satisfying 1 n rx n e 2 n x n e 3 lies in the interior of one of the maximal cones nr t in the common refinement of the normal fans of the weight polyhedra of the representations e and e 16 sean timothy paul in this case we have t w rx t rx det aij deg rx n 1 o t t 0 t w x t x det bij deg x n o t t 0 for some maximal minors det aij and det bij by continuity see 26 the specializations of the heights of rx and x are therefore given by lim t 0 hf t x deg r n 1 z detn 1 0 logz detn 1 d 2 deg r log d o d lim t 0 h t x deg n z detn 0 logz detn deg n 2 deg log d o d this proves the main result of this section namely that the height discrepancy is o d 2 along all generic degenerations proposition 4 3 for generic t sl n 1 c t we have that 0 lim t 0 deg r h t x deg hf t x o d 2 remark 5 in the above proposition despite the notation we do not degenerate x but the associated polynomials the presence of x prevents the compatibility of these two types of degenerations proposition 4 3 is significant for the following reason the left hand bound d n j 1 1 j h p 0 is assumed by the dth power of any linear form in an attempt to make large we push one of the polynomials in the direction of a power of such a form in our case the determinant of a maximal minor but the other polynomial also moves towards a maximal minor therefore they both become large and their dominant terms match precisely and cancel this is one reason why the author believes that is unobstructed 5 asymptotic stability and properness of the mabuchi energy we quickly collect some definitions surrounding mabuchi s k energy map let xn n dimc x heights 17

dt t is a c 1 path inh satisfying 0 0 1 mabuchi shows that is independent of the path chosen it is clear that is a critical point for if and only if scal what is relevant for the present article is the following theorem first established by bando and mabuchi in the case l kx and then generalized some years later by donaldson and li theorem 5 1 see 3 11 12 16 let x l be a polarized manifold and assume that there is a constant scalar curvature metric in the class c 1 l then the mabuchi energy is bounded below onh where h is any hermitian metric on l with positive curvature we recall the aubin

provided there exists constants 0 and b such that for all h we have j b remark 6 the constant in this definition is related to the stability exponent m by m 1 let xn l be a polarized manifold let h be a smooth hermitian metric on l with positive curvature choose k large enough so that there is an embedding k x p h 0 x lk we will always assume that the embedding is given by a unitary basis of sections si similarly we outfit h 0 x lk with the usual l 2 hermitian metric we let fs denote the corresponding fubini study k hler metric on the dual projective space of sections then k fs k x k h 1

is the following result of tian 25 theorem 5 2 tian s thesis the spaces bk are dense in the c 2 topology k bk h now we are prepared to establish that the asymptotic stability of x l is equivalent to the existence of a csck metric c 1 l provided that holds we begin with the following lemma which was shown to the author by gang tian lemma 5 1 there is a uniform constant c such that for all sufficiently large k n we have c 1 k log 2 nk 1 x k n vo proof if 2 trace then we observe that the unitarity of the basis gives 0 i nk si 2 2 1 heights 19 therefore there is an index j such that sj 2

therefore 1 k log 2 nk 1 1 logc 1 k x log sj 2 n v 1 k x log 0 i nk 1 si 2 n v we need to compare the mabuchi energy and the aubin energy of the reference metric and the restrictions of the fubini study metrics coming from the large projective embed dings it is easy to see but absolutely crucial for our argument that does not scale but f o does scale as we pass between and fs k x we collect the

proposition 2 2 shows that asymptotic stability of x l is equivalent to km log 2 2 log r 2 r 2 q log 2 nk 1 log r 2 r 2 ck 2 n 1 5 1 where k 0 m is a fixed positive integer and q deg x deg rx keep in mind that the norms denote the standard l 2 norms induced by h on the representations and 2 trace 20 sean timothy paul the basic comparison theorem from the introduction theorem a from 21 gives d 2 n 1 fs log 2 2 log r 2 r 2 therefore the left hand side of 5 1 becomes km d 2 n 1 k d 2 n 1 o 1 kmd 2 n 1 k o 1 d 2 n 1 kmd 2 n 1 k o 1 c above we used our assumption that x l satisfies condition d 2 o 1 on the right hand side of we have by tian s lemma and known results 11 concerning the relationship between rx and f o fs k x the following expression q log 2 nk 1 1 deg r log r 2 r 2 ck 2 n 1 q log 2 nk 1 f o fs k x hf x hf x deg r ck 2 n 1 q log nk 1 j fs k x hf x hf x deg r ck 2 n 1 q log nk 1 kj k ko 1 hf x hf x deg r ck 2 n 1 now divide both sides by k 2 n 1 to get k o 1 c 1 j k c 1 log nk 1 k c 1 hf x hf x k deg r c 2 we remark that ci ci n m recall that the heights satisfy at worst a d log d bound where d kn this gives hf x hf x k deg r o log k k 11 see 28 or 19 heights 21 now we may choose any h and any sequence bk 3 k c 2 as k to see that the mabuchi energy is proper running this backwards shows that properness of the mabuchi energy implies asymp totic stability of the polarized manifold x l the equivalence between asymptotic semista bility and a lower bound on the mabuchi energy is proved in much the same way references 1 m f atiyah resolution of singularities and division
