introduction metric connections with torsion play an important part in hermitian pseudo hermitian and contact riemannian geometry actually outside the kahler case all the hermitian connections defined on the tangent bundle of an almost hermitian manifold have torsion the lichnerowicz chern and bismut connections are the most famous examples of such connections cf 12 examples of metric connections with torsion exist in pseudo hermitian geometry tanaka webster connection 21 27 30 and in contact riemannian geometry tanno connection 28 recently in the setting of sub riemannian geometry diniz veloso 9 and hladky 16 have introduced for some riemannian manifolds obtained as riemannian extensions of the sub riemannian manifolds endowed with an orthogonal decomposition of the tangent bundle a metric connection with torsion preserving the decomposition a substitute to an orthogonal decomposition in the pseudo euclidean setting is the well known witt decomposition the tangent bundle of some pseudo riemannian manifolds like the robinson manifolds 22 26 or the fefferman spaces 7 11 18 can be endowed with a type witt decomposition called witt structure in the following also it is possible to define just as diniz veloso and hladky a metric connection with torsion preserving a such decomposition the main purpose of this article is to construct a such connection and to study its properties the plan of this article is as follow in section 2 we give a definition of a witt structure on the tangent bundle of a pseudo riemannian manifold and we exhibit various examples section 3 is devoted to construct a metric connection adapted to a witt structure on a pseudo riemannian manifold called the canonical witt connection proposition 3 1 in section 4 we investigate the notion of geodesic in this new context in particular for the lorentzian manifolds endowed with a witt structure and a compatible sub riemannian structure we consider the normal sub riemannian geodesics as defined in 25 the equations of normal sub riemannian geodesics are given in terms of the canonical witt connection proposition 4 2 and corollary 4 1 note that these equations are similar to those obtained in the sub riemannian and pseudo hermitian setting 13 14 15 and 24 in section 5 we introduce a notion of locally witt symmetric space inspired by the notions of sub symmetric space bieliavski falbel gorodski 6 10 and symmetric cauchy riemann manifold kaup zaitsev 17 similar to sub symmetric case we show that the notion of witt symmetric space is related to parallelism properties for torsion and curvature of the canonical witt connection proposition 5 1 section 6 is dedicated to robinson manifolds and fefferman spaces which are lorentzian conterparts of hermitian manifolds by means of the canonical witt connection associated to the standard complex witt structure on the complexify tangent bundle of a robinson manifold we introduce a connection called lichnerowicz connection on the real tangent bundle of a robinson manifold which is the natural conterpart of the lichnerowicz connection on an almost hermitian manifold proposition 6 1 the equations of normal sub riemannian geodesics proposition 6 2 and the parallelism conditions associated to witt symmetric spaces corollary 6 1 are revisited in the special case of fefferman spaces note that we can define various notions of curvature associated to a witt connection as the ricci curvature or the scalar curvature with the hope to have interesting applications in geometry of pseudo riemannian manifolds or in general relativity this work is still in progress 2 2 witt pseudo riemannian manifolds in the following m g is a pseudo riemannian manifold i e a m dimensional manifoldm endowed with a non

manifold m g with 0 1 is a rank m 1 complex subbundle n of tcm which is totally isotropic with respect to the complexified metric gc i e n n 4 in the following we assume that n n with n be the complex conjugate of n is a complex sub bundle of tcm and we denote by the integer dimc nx nx if g is a riemannian metric then an almost nul structure on m g with 0 is called an almost her mitian cr structure

every rk 0 the scalar 2 form d is nondegenerate on hm ker the subbundle hm of tm is called a polycontact structure in this case there exists a unique family 1 k of vector fields called reeb fields satisfying i j ij and i i d i hm 0 and we have the decomposition tm vm hm with vm span 1 k let g be a lie group with lie algebra g and 1 m g be a g valued polycontact form on a manifold m let p be a principal g bundle over m together with p m the canonical pro jection and 1 p g be a connection form on p we have the decomposition into horizontal and vertical bundles tp vp hp vp vm hm now assume that m hm ghm is a sub riemannian structure and g g is a metric lie algebra euclidean then we endow p with the pseudo riemannian metric gf g hm where g hm is the extension of ghm to tm such that vm ker g hm and where denotes the sym metric product i e 1 2 x y 1 x 2 y g 1 y 2 x g we call p gf a fefferman manifold fefferman spaces defined as s 1 principal bundles over strictly pseudoconvex cr manifolds or contact quaternionic fefferman spaces defined as s 3 principal bun dles over contact quaternionic manifolds 2 are examples of fefferman manifolds note that by taking vp 1 vp vp 1 vm and vq 1 hm then m g vi i z 11 is a witt pseudo riemannian manifold 5 example 2 4 lightlike submanifold cf 5 let n be a n dimensional submanifold of a pseudo riemannian manifold mm g we assume that at each point x n rad txn txn txn 6 0 and that dim rad txn is constant on n n is called lightlike or degenerate submanifold of m g then the radical bundle rad tn is the totally isotropic subbundle of tm whose fibre at x n is rad txn note that rank rad tn called the nullity degree of tn satisfies 0 min n m n there exists subbundles s tn tn s tn tn and ltr tn s tn s tn such that tm rad tn ltr tn s tn s tn the bundles s tn s tn and ltr tn are respectively called screen bundle of tn screen bundle of tn and lightlike transversal vector bundle of n by setting vp 1 rad tn vp 1 ltr tn vq 1 s tn and vq 2 s tn then m g vi i z 12 is a witt pseudo riemannian manifold 3 witt connections on witt pseudo riemannian manifolds we define in this section a connection adapted to a witt structure on a pseudo riemannian manifold for a connection the torsion and the curvature of are respectively defined by t x y xy yx x y and r x y x y x y in the following we define i for i zsr by if i ql then i ql if i pk then i p k if i p k then i pk for any point x m we denote by ix txm vi x the projection onto vi x then we have for x txm x i zsr xi with xi i x x note that for any x y txm g x y i zsr g xi yi awitt connection on awitt pseudo riemannian manifold m g vi i zsr is a pseudo riemannian connection such that vi vi for any i zsr let tk tm tm vk the tensor defined by tk xi yj 0 if i j 1 2 lxiy j lyjx i k

xi yj xi yj v i j tj xi yj ti yj xi 1 where v i 1 ik vi 1 vik remark 3 1 this proposition is the natural extension to the pseudo riemannian case of theorem 3 1 of 9 and lemma 2 13 of 16 we need the following lemma lemma 3 1 let be a pseudo riemannian connection then for any x y z tm we have xz y 1 2 dz x y z t x y lzg x y g t z x y g t z y x 2 where z is the 1 form given by z x g z x proof for a pseudo riemannian connection and any x y z tm we have the formula g xy z 1 2 xg y z zg x y y g x z g z x y g x y z g y z x k x y z 3 with k x y z 1 2 g t x y z g t y z x g t z x y k is called the

yl g z xyl 0 for any z v l yl vl and x tm hence by 2 we have dz x yl z t x yl lzg x yl g t z x yl g t z yl x 4 let i j k zsr with k satisfying k 6 i and k 6 j then we have vk v i and vk v j it follows that xiz k yj yjz k xi 0 for any zk vk xi vi yj vj it follows from these equations together with 4 that for k 6 i and k 6 j z k t xi yj k dz k xi yj 5 g t zk xi j yj g t zk yj i xi lzk g xi yj 6 first since the component t xi yi i does not appear in 5 and 6 we take t xi yi i 0 for any i zsr now 5 is equivalent to g zk t xi yj xi yj k 0 by non degeneracy we deduce that t xi yj k xi yj k with k 6 i k 6 j 7 if j 6 i then 7 yields to g t zk xi j yj g t zk yj i xi g zk xi j yj g xi zk yj i lzk g xi yj also 6 is always satisfied in this case and is equivalent to g t zk xi i yi g t zk yi i xi lzk g xi

we obtain by 4 for i zs g t zi xi i yi g t yi xi i zi g t yi zi i xi g t zi xi i yi g t yi xi i zi lzi g xi yi dz i xi yi lyi g xi zi dy i xi zi lzi x i yi lxiz i yi y i zi xi i d g zi xi yi 9 now if

and the assumption t xi yi i 0 by means of the previous formula for t and 3 we define a pseudo riemannian connection with the required properties remark 3 2 note that the previous proof only requires that vql are non degenerate for l 1 r and not necessarily anisotropic for g example 3 1 assume that the witt structure has the following form vp 2 vp 2 vp 1 vp 1 or vp 1 vp 1 vq 1 vq 2 together with dimvp 1 1 if we choose a local field frame of vp 1 vp 1 such that g 1 then formula 1 in proposition 3 1 for the torsion of the canonical witt connection becomes t xi yi xi yi k d xi yi d xi yi k 6 i t

osh in example 2 1 then the previous formula becomes t xi yi 0 t xi yj d xi yj t z t z 0 4 geodesics on witt lorentzian manifolds in this section we assume that m g is a lorentzian manifold endowed with a witt structure of type tm vp 1 vp 1 vq 1 with vp 1 vp 1 trivial nul line subbundles and g vq 1 positive definite on the subbundle vq 1 we choose as in section 3 global field frame of vp 1 vp 1 such that g 1 denote by the canonical witt connection associated to the witt structure then the torsion t of is given by t x y d x y d x y x y vq 1 t x d x 1 2 lxg tvq 1 x t x d x 1 2 lxg tvq 1 x t vq 1 13 9 with and g tvq 1 x y 1 2 l g x y we define various notions of geodesics adapted to a such type of witt structure on a lorentzian manifold lightlike geodesics definition 4 1 a curve c 0 1 m will be called a geodesic if c c 0 a lightlike geodesic is a geodesic c 0 1 m such that c vp 1 vp 1 and g c c 0 proposition 4 1 a curve c 0 1 m is a lightlike geodesic if and only if lc c c l c 0 lc c c l c 0 14 proof let c 0 1 m with c vp 1 vp 1 then c c c hence we have c c c c c c c c c c c c c lc c c c lc c c c 15 now using formulas 2 and 13 we have for x tm x 1 2 l g x d x g vq 1 x since l g x l x

structure tm vp 1 vp 1 vq 1 we have vq 1 ker ker and g split as g g vq 1 since g vq 1 is a riemannian metric on vq 1 then by setting h vq 1 we obtain a sub riemannian structure m h gh g h recall that a smooth curve c 0 1 m on a sub riemannian manifold m h gh will be called an horizontal curve if c t hc t for any t 0 1 in the following c denotes the set of curves with fixed endpoints i e c c 0 1 m c 0 x c 1 y and ch the subset of horizontal curves with fixed endpoints now we define the length and the energy of a curve respectively by lk c 1 0 g c c dt and ek c 1 2 1 0 g c c dt definition 4 2 a normal sub riemannian geodesic is a critical point of the functional lk on the space ch up to a reparameterization note that the critical points of lk and ek on ch coincide hence a normal sub riemannian geodesic is a critical point of the functional ek on the space ch now a normal sub riemannian geodesic can also be viewed as a critical point of a functional e on c as follow cf 13 for 1 2

c is the lagrange multiplier in order to obtain the variational caracterization of normal sub riemannian geodesics we recall the concept of variation of a curve let c 0 1 m be a smooth curve on a manifold m then a variation of c with fixed endpoints is a smooth map f 0 1 m such that f 0 t c t for any t 0 1 and f s 0 c 0 and f s 1 c 1 for any s let f tm 0 1 be the pull back bundle in the following we consider the vector fields w c f tm given by w s t df s t s and c s t df s t t note that w s t c s t 0 and that for a variation with fixed endpoints w s 0 w s 1 0 in the following a

of then recall that r satisfies the bianchi identities b r x y z d t x y z d r x y z 0 where d is the exterior covariant derivative on vector valued 2 forms on m and b r is the bianchi map i e b r x y z r x y z r z x y r y z x the curvature tensor of the canonical witt connection is given by r x y z w g r x y z w since is metric r satisfies the identities r y x z w r x y z w and r x y w z r x y z w but r is not symmetric and not satisfies the first bianchi identity since has torsion it directly follows from the first bianchi identity that r x y zi d t x y zi i x y v i xi zi vi r xi y zi r zi y xi d t xi y zi i witt symmetric spaces following 6 and 17 we now introduce a notion of symmetric space adapted to a witt structure on a pseudo riemannian manifold letm be a manifold endowed with an affine connection and m m be a diffeomorphism we defined the connection on m by setting xy x y d 1 d x d y we recall that is an affine diffeomorphism if xy xy equivalently xd y d x d y d xy 0 note that any affine diffeomorphism preserves torsion and curvature of the connection and their derivatives 14 definition 5 1 let m g vi i zsr be a witt pseudo riemannian manifold a map m m is said to be witt at a point x m if d x ix i x d x for any i zsr i e d x vi x vi x for any i zsr a map m m is said to be witt if it is witt at each point x m definition 5 2 let m g vi i zsr be a witt pseudo riemannian manifold endowed with its canon ical witt connection a local witt affine diffeomorphism on m is a local witt affine diffeomor phism on m a local witt isometry on m is a local witt isometric diffeomorphism on m lemma 5 1 let m g vi i zsr be a witt pseudo riemannian manifold endowed with its canon ical witt connection then any local witt isometry is a local witt affine diffeomorphism proof let be a local witt isometry we have to proove that g xd y d z 0 for any x y z tm since d vj vj and preserves vj then we obtain g xd y d z j zsr g xd yj d zj with yj vj zj vj hence it is sufficient to

x y z h t x z y h t y z x if is a witt isometry then the previous formula applied with h g yields for xi vi g xid yj d zj 1 2 g t d xi d yj j d zj g t d xi d zj j d yj g t d yj d zj i d xi g t xi yj j zj g t xi zj j yj g t yj zj i xi 23 if i j respectively i j then 23 together with the assumption t xj yj j 0 yields g xjd yj d zj 1 2 g t d xj d zj j d yj g t d yj d zj j d xj g t xj zj j yj g t yj zj

properties of t that g t xj zj j yj g t yj zj j xj 0 also we obtain by 24 25 that g xjd yj d zj g xj d yj d zj 0 now if i 6 j and i 6 j then using properties of t we obtain that g t d xi d yj j d zj g t d xi d zj j d yj 0 and g t xi yj j zj g t xi zj j yj 0 hence we obtain by 23 g xid yj d zj 1 2 d xi t d yj d zj i xi t yj zj i 1 2 d d xi d yj d zj dxi yj zj 1 2 d d xi yj zj dxi yj zj 1 2 d d xi yj zj dxi yj zj since is a local isometry then d xi xi and g xid yj d zj 0 hence is a local affine diffeomorphism remark 5 1 it follows that any witt isometry maps geodesics to geodesics also if 1 2 are two witt isometries on a connected witt pseudo riemannian manifold such that 1 x 2 x and d 1 x d 2 x then 1 2 from now we assume that zsr contains even and odd integers and that for any k 1 s pk p k mod 2 it follows that the involution x txm txm given by x i zsr 1 i ix 6 idx is a witt linear isometry let exp tm m be the exponential map associated to then for any x m there exists ux m and w 0 x txm neighbourhoods of x m and 0 x txm such that exp x w 0 x ux be a diffeomorphism hence we can define a witt diffeomorphism x ux ux called local witt symmetry at x by x exp x x exp x 1 note that 2 x idm x x x and x x d x x x definition 5 3 a locally witt symmetric space is a witt pseudo riemannian manifold m g vi i zsr such that for any point x m x is a local witt isometry remark 5 2 it follows from properties of x and remark 4 1 that x is unique 16 in the following v m are the vector bundles over m with fibre v x ker x idx i even odd vi x proposition 5 1 let m g vi i zsr be a locally witt symmetric space then we have v v v t v v v t v v v r v v 0 and v r v t 0 proof let x 0 m and be the local witt symmetry at x 0 since is a witt affine diffeomorphism we deduce that for xi vi x 0 yj vj

r xi yj zk r xi yj zk 27 it directly follows from 26 that if i j is even then t xi yj 2 l 1 0 in addition if i j are both even then t xi yj 2 l 1 xi yj 2 l 1 0 and consequently v v v if i j is odd then 27 yields to t xi yj 2 l 0 and r xi yj 0 now the assumption witt affine diffeomorphism also implies that for xk vk x 0 yi vi x 0 zj vj x 0 and wl vl x 0 then we have d xk t d yi d zj d xkt yi zj and d xk r d yi d zj d wl d xkr yi zj wl if i j is even respectively i j is odd and k is odd then we obtain l zsr xkt yi zj l l zsr 1 l xkt yi zj l xkr yi zj wl xkr yi zj wl 28 17 respectively l zsr xkt yi zj l l zsr 1 l xkt yi zj l 29 it follows from 28 and 29 that if i j is even respectively odd and k is odd then xkr yi zj 0 and xkt yi zj 2 l 0 respectively xkt yi zj 2 l 1 0 we deduce that if i

be necessary to obtain a converse of the proposition 6 robinson manifolds and fefferman spaces let m 2 m 2 g n be an even dimensional lorentzian manifold endowed with an almost robinson structure since dim m even then n n we call robinson structure an almost robinson struc ture such that n is integrable i e n n n in the following we call almost robinson manifold respectively robinson manifold an even dimensional lorentzian manifold endowed with an almost robinson structure respectively robinson structure denote by r the nul line subbundle of tm such that rc n n from now we assume that m 2

r ker and r ker with and let s the subbundle of tm called screen bundle given by s r r ker ker note that r r s and as in section 4 that g s is a riemannian metric on s now there exists a complex subbundle of tcm denoted by t 1 0 m such that n rc t 1 0 m and sc t 1 0 m t 0 1 m with t 0 1 m t 1 0 m hence we have the complex and real witt structures tcm rc r c t 1 0 m t 0 1 m tm r r s we can define an almost hermitian structure gs j on s such that t 1 0 m respectively t 0 1 m is the 1 respectively 1 eigenbundle of j on sc moreover extending j by 0 on r r we obtain a real 2 form on m by setting x y g jx y it directly follows from formula 12 that 18 lemma 6 1 the torsion of the canonical witt connection c on tcm associated to the complex witt structure tcm rc r c t 1 0 m t 0 1 m is

coincide with the canon ical witt connection associated to the real witt structure tm r r s 2 for an almost hermitian cr manifold m g j cf example 2 2 we have a complex witt struc ture given by tcm t

connection so called first canonical connection in 12 and for 1 the generalized tanaka webter connection defined in 21 definition 6 1 let m 2 m 2 g n be an almost robinson manifold an almost robinson structure will be called almost kahler robinson structure if d 0 an almost robinson structure will be called shear free almost robinson structure if cf 1 l gc gc c with c m and 1 c m a shear free almost robinson structure such that the flow of acts freely on m together with m m f manifold and m m principal g bundle g r or s 1 is called a regular shear free almost robinson structure an interesting subclass of regular shear free kahler robinson manifolds is given by the fefferman spaces which are some s 1 principal bundles over strictly pseudoconvex cr manifolds we briefly recall the construction of these spaces given in 3 18 let m be a 2 m 1 dimensional strictly pseudoconvex cr manifold in the following h j l g w respectively denote the pseudo hermitian structure on m the contact hyperplan on m i e h ker the reeb field on m i e the unique vector field on m such that 1 and d 0 the cr structure on h i e the complex stucture j on h the levi form i e the real symmetric tensor given l d j and the webster metric i e the riemannian metric g w l we assume m endowed with its tanaka webster connection and we denote by r w the curvature tensor of the pseudo hermitian ricci form w and the pseudo hermitian scalar curvature s w are respectively defined 21 by w x y m i 1 r w x y e i j e i and s w m i 1 w e i j e i with e 1 j e 1 e m j e m local orthonormal basis of h let k m 1 0 m m 1 tm c i x 0 1 0 be the canonical bundle of m k k 0 and m k r then m is a principal s 1 bundle over m with canonical projection denoted by let a 1 m ir be the connection form on m associated to the tanaka webster connection on m and let 1 m r the 1 forms on m respectively given by and 1 a 1 2 m 1 s w note that d d and d w 1 2 m 1 ds w s w d 32 let respectively be the fondamental vector field on

fefferman space let s 1 h and j 1 j then gfs j is a hermitian structure on s now n vcm t 1 0 m is a robinson structure such that l l l gf 0 and f d also m 2 m 2 gf n is an example of regular shear free kahler robinson manifold proposition 6 2 let m 2 m 2 gf n be a fefferman space endowed with its lichnerowicz connec tion then 1 a curve c on m is a lightlike geodesic if and only if lc c lc c 0 2 a curve c cs is a normal sub riemannian geodesic if and only if c c k 1 i c w s k 1 s w 2 m 1 t 0 w c ds 1 2 m 1 t 0 ds w c ds 1 2 t 0 l gw c c ds k 2 jc 33 in particular if m gf is a fefferman space over a pseudo einstein sasaki manifold then the last equation becomes c c k 1 m 2 2 m m 1 s w k 2 jc 22 proof if m gf n is a fefferman space then we have the relations nj 0 f d l l l gf l f 0 l l f 0 34 substituting these relations in 31 we deduce that the lichnerowicz connection coincides with the canonical witt connection associated to the witt structure tm r r s hence the equations for lightlike geodesics follow from 14 together with l l 0 now let c cs be a normal sub riemannian geodesic formula 22 together with relations 34 gives c c c 1 i c d h c 2 i c d h c 1 c 2 0 c 1 l c 12 l g

pseudo einstein sasaki manifold then we have l gw 0 and w s w m d with s w constant hence w s w m f and we obtain the result in this case let m g n be an almost robinson manifold endowed with its complex witt structure tcm rc r c t 1 0 m t 0 1 m by setting v rc r c and v t 1 0 m t 0 1 m sc we define the isometric involution x t c xm tcxm by x x x where x are the projections onto v x 23 definition 6 2 let m 2 m 2 g n be an almost robinson manifold endowed with its complex witt structure tcm rc r c t 1 0 m t 0 1 m and its canonical witt connection c then m g n is called an locally almost robinson witt symmetric space if for any point x m cx exp c x x exp c x 1 is a local witt isometry proposition 6 3 let m 2 m 2 g n be a locally almost robinson witt symmetric space endowed with its lichnerowicz connection then we have 1 there is a codimension 2 m foliation f of m such that t f r r 2 the almost hermitian structure gs j is integrable and d c 2 1 1 2 sc 0 3 l s l s l s l s 0 sd s l s d s sd s l s d s sl g s sl g s sl s sl s 0 4 sr 0 i r s i r s 0 proof if m is a locally almost robinson witt symmetric space then by proposition 5 1 we have v v v hence v is an integrable 2 dimensional distribution and we have a foliation f of m with t f r r now we have also that tc must satisfies tc v v v and t c v v v these conditions applied to 30 yields to x 1 0 y 1 0 0 1 x 0 1 y 0 1
