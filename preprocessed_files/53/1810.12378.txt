an intrinsic flat limit of riemannian manifolds with no geodesics jorge basilio demetre kazaras and christina sormani abstract in this paper we produce a sequence of riemannian manifolds mmj m 2 which converge in the intrinsic flat sense to the unit m sphere with the restricted euclidean distance this limit space has no geodesics achieving the distances between points exhibiting previously unknown behavior of intrinsic flat limits in contrast any compact gromov hausdorff limit of a sequence of riemannian manifolds is a geodesic space moreover if m 3 the manifolds mmj may be chosen to have positive scalar curvature 1 introduction in 1981 gromov introduced the gromov hausdorff distance between metric spaces dgh x 1 d 1 x 2 d 2 and proved that compact gromov hausdorff limits of riemannian manifolds are geodesic metric spaces gro 81 that is the distance between any pair of points in the limiting metric space is realized by the length of a curve between the points recall that by the hopf rinow theorem any compact riemannian manifold m with the length metric dm p q defined by taking the infi mum of lengths of curves from p to q is a geodesic metric space if the riemannian manifold is embedded into euclidean space one may also study a different metric space m de defined using the restricted euclidean metric de observe that the standard m dimensional sphere sm em 1 with the euclidian distance de is an example of a metric space sm de with no geodesics geodesic spaces and the gromov hausdorff distance are reviewed in sections 2 1 and 2 3 in sw 11 the third author and wenger introduced the intrinsic flat distance df between two integral current spaces x 1 d 1 t 1 and x 2 d 2 t 2 an m dimensional integral current space is a metric space x d with an collection of oriented bilip schitz charts and an integral m current t such that x is the set of positive density of t for example a compact oriented manifold m g has a canonical integral current space structure m dm m if m is embedded in euclidean space then we can create a different integral current space m de m whose metric depends upon that embedding we review these spaces and df in sections 2 4 and 2 5 respectively in the appendix to sw 11 the second author studied a sequence of riemannian 2 spheres m j dm j j 1 2 constructed by removing a pair of tiny balls from two standard spheres and connecting the resulting boundaries by an increasingly the first author was partially supported by nsf dms 1006059 the second author by nsf dms 1547145 and the third author by nsf dms 1612049 ar x iv 1 81 0 12

connected by a line segment of length 1 endowed with the length metric dy on the other hand the intrinsic flat limit of this sequence consists of the pair of spheres y y without the line segment see figure 1 figure 1 the tunnel disappears under f convergence so that the f limit space is not a geodesic space sw 11 in other words m j dm j m j y dy y y y with respect to the intrinsic flat distance the line segment does not appear in the intrinsic flat limit since the current y does not have positive density there since y is not path connected this example shows that intrinsic flat limits of riemannian manifolds need not be geodesic metric spaces when the second author presented this paper at the geometry festival in 2009 various mathematicians asked whether it was possible to prove that intrinsic flat limits of riemannian manifolds are locally geodesic spaces for all p m is there a neighborhood u about p such that all pairs of points in u are joined by a geodesic segment in this paper we provide an example demonstrating that this is not the case more precisely we prove the following theorem theorem 1 1 for each m 2 there is a sequence of closed oriented m dimensional riemannian manifolds mmj so that the corrisponding integral current spaces f converge to 1 1 m sm dem 1 sm if m 3 the manifolds m j may be chosen to have positive scalar curvature since the metric space sm dem 1 is not a length space we immediately obtain a negative answer to the above question corollary 1 2 for m 2 the intrinsic flat limit of closed oriented m dimensional riemannian manifolds need not be locally geodesically complete f limit with no geodesics 3 to construct the riemannian manifolds m j in theorem 1 1 we modify the stan dard m sphere by gluing in increasingly thin tunnels between pairs in an increas ingly dense collection of removed balls the lengths of the tunnels approximate the euclidean distance between the points at the centers of the balls they replace see figure 2 the original plan for this construction in two dimensions was conceived by the first and last authors and presented a few years ago but never published figure 2 a schematic depiction of the sequence in theorem 1 1 in gro 14 gromov suggested that perhaps the natural notion of convergence for sequences of manifolds with positive scalar curvature is the intrinsic flat con vergence note that the classic ilmanen example sw 11 demonstrates that a se quence of three dimensional manifolds of positive scalar curvature with increas ingly many increasingly thin increasingly dense wells has no gromov hausdorff limit but does converge naturally in the intrinsic flat sense to a sphere thus the second and third authors decided to complete the construction of our example with positive scalar curvature when the dimension is 3 in order to achieve the positive scalar curvature condition we design the tunnels using a refinement of the classical gromov lawson construction gl 80 recently obtained by dodziuk dod 18 see also schoen yau s classic tunnel construction in sy 79 topologically each m j is the connected sum of a large number of copies of s 1 s 2 we begin the construction in section 3 by proving our main technical result theorem 3 1 which allows us to estimate the intrinsic flat distance between a space with a tunnel and a space with a thread this is an extension of the pipe filling technique developed by the second author in the appendix of sw 11 in sw 11 this technique was applied to prove the m j the pair of spheres with a tunnel between them and y the pair of spheres with a thread between them could be isometrically embedded into a common space this then allowed one to esti mate the intrinsic flat distance and gromov hausdorff distance between m j and m y in theorem 3 1 we start with an arbitrary riemannian manifold and a pair of points in that manifold and a length l less than the distance between the points we show that the manifold created by joining the points with a thin enough 4 j basilio d kazaras c sormani tunnel of length l is close in the intrinsic flat sense to the space created by joining the points with a thread of length l theorem 3 1 as before our estimate on the intrinsic flat distance between the space depends on volumes and diameters while the gromov hausdorff distance depends on the width of the tunnel and diameters we apply this pipe filling technique inductively in proposition 5 1 to prove that our sequence m j of spheres with increasingly dense tunnels definitions 4 2 and 4 4 are increasingly close to a sequence n j of spheres with increasingly dense threads definitions 4 1 and 4 3 we apply a direct filling construction to prove that the spheres with the increasingly dense threads viewed as integral current spaces n j converge to the sphere with the restricted euclidean metric m sm de sm in the intrinsic flat sense proposition 5 2 note that the threads are not part of the integral current space n j as they have lower density these are combined to prove theorem 1 1 it should be noted that the manifolds in our sequence have closed minimal hy persurfaces of increasingly small area these stable minimal surfaces are located within the increasingly thin tunnels in sor 17 the third author has conjectured that if one were to impose a uniform positive lower bound on 1 2 mina m 3 min area 2 closed minimal in m 3 that this combined with nonnegative scalar curvature would guarantee that the limit space has geodesics between every pair of points this is a three dimensional conjecture it would be interesting to explore if other kinds of tunnels might be constructed in higher dimensions to create limits with no geodesics even with a uniform positive lower bound on mina the authors would like to thank brian allen edward bryden lisandra her nandez jeff jauregui sajjad lakzian dan lee raquel perales and jim portegies for many conversations about scalar curvature and convergence we would like to thank jozef dodziuk misha gromov marcus khuri blaine lawson rick schoen and shing tung yau for their interest in these questions 2 background here we provide a brief review of metric spaces length spaces and integral current spaces followed by a review of the gromov hausdorff and intrinsic flat distances between these spaces 2 1 review of geodesic spaces given any metric space x d one may define the length of a rectifiable curve c 0 1 x as follows 2 1 ld c sup n i 1 d c ti c ti 1 0 t 0 t 1 tn 1 n n if every pair of points in x is connected by a rectifiable curve then one can define the induced length metric dx on x as follows 2 2 dx p q inf ld c c 0 p c 1 q f limit with no geodesics 5 if x is compact then this infimum is achieved and any curve achieving the infimum is called a minimizing geodesic a geodesic metric space is a metric space of the form x dx in which the distance between any pair of points is achieved by a minimizing geodesic see bbi 01 for more details about length structures given a pair of geodesic spaces xi dxi with base points xi xi for i 1 2 one may produce a new geodesic space by identifying x 1 with x 2 we denote this by 2 3 x 1 tx 1 x 2 x 2 the metric on x 1 tx 1 x 2 x 2 is defined using curves that pass from x 1 to x 2 via the identified points as in 2 1 and the new distance is defined as in 2 2 consider the example of the sphere with the restricted euclidean metric sm de by the law of cosines 2 4 de x y 2 2 cos dsm x y this is bilipschitz equivalent to dsm with lipschitz constants 1 and 2 however sm de is not a geodesic space in fact for any pair of distinct points x y sm there is no geodesic connecting x and y indeed there cannot exist midpoints z such that 2 5 de x z de y z de x y 2 2 2 review of uniform convergence of a metric space fix a space x a se quence of metrics di i 1 2 on x is said to converge uniformly to a metric d on x if if 2 6 sup x x x di x x d x x 0 as i a sequence of metric spaces xi i converges uniformly to a metric space x d if there exists a sequence of metrics di on x such that xi i is isometric to x di for all i and di converges uniformly to d 2 3 review of the gromov hausdorff distance the gromov hausdorff dis tance was defined in gro 81 see also bbi 01 a distance preserving map f x 1 d 1 x 2 d 2 is a map such that 2 7 d 2 f a f b d 1 a b a b x 1 observe that the standard embedding f s 2 e 3 is distance preserving when viewed as f s 2 de e 3 de but is not distance preserving when s 2 is given the length metric ds 2 the gromov hausdorff distance between two metric spaces is defined as 2 8 dgh x 1 d 1 x 2 d 2 inf z dzh 1 x 1 2 x 2 where the infimum is taken over all metric spaces z dz and over all distance preserving maps i xi di z dz here the hausdorff distance between subsets a b z is defined by 2 9 dzh a b inf r a tr b b tr a 6 j basilio d kazaras c sormani where tr u x z dz x u r clearly one may estimate the hausdorff distance dgh x 1 d 1 x 2 d 2 from above by constructing a common space z dz with distance preserving embed dings of x 1 and x 2 for instance we may estimate the distance to a single point space p 0 2 10 dgh s 2 de p 0 d e 3 h s 2 0 1 taking s 2 e 3 to be the standard embedding however s 2 ds 2 does not have a distance preserving map into e 3 given a metric space x d let nx r be the maximum number of disjoint balls of radius r in x gromov s compactness theorem states that any sequence of metric spaces x j with a uniform upper bound nx j r n r for all r has a sub sequence x ji which converges in the gromov hausdorff sense to a compact metric space he proved the converse as well if compact x j converges to a compact x in the gromov hausdorff sense then there is uniform upper bound nx j r n r gro 81 as a final remark if a metric space x is the gromov hausdorff limit of geodesic spaces then x is a geodesic space as well gro 81 2 4 review of integral current spaces we now provide an intuitive descrip tion of integral current spaces which were first defined in sw 11 based upon work of ambrosio kirchheim in ak 00 an m dimensional integral current space x d t is a metric space x d equipped with an m dimensional integral current t for the special case where x is an ori ented smooth n dimensional manifold and d is a lipschitz distance function on x then x d has a cannonical m dimensional integral current space structure given by 2 11 t m for any m form on x for instance sm dsm s and sm dem 1 s are both integral current spaces when x is only a metric space however there is no general notion of a smooth differential form to define an integral current structure on such an x one applies the methods of digeorgi deg 95 and ambrosio kirchheim ak 00 to replace the role of smooth m forms by m 1 tuples 0 1 m of lipschitz functions i x r the notion of an integral current acting on such tuples is developed in detail in ak 00 so long as x is covered almost everywhere by a countable collection of bilipschitz charts i ai rm x with disjoint images then 2 12 t 0 1 m i 1 f id 1 i d m i defines an integral current on x the mass mass measure and density of an integral current space are defined in sw 11 based upon ak 00 for the purposes of this paper we will only consider f limit with no geodesics 7 cases where x is an oriented m dimensional riemannian manifold or is glued to gether from such manifolds for these cases the mass of x is hm x the mass measure is the m dimensional hausdorff measurehm and the density is 2 13 p lim inf r 0 hm bp r mrm since integral current spaces x d t are defined in sw 11 so that 2 14 x set t x x x 0 we see that only top dimensional regions in spaces created by gluing together man ifolds form part of x 2 5 the intrinsic flat distance the intrinsic flat distance between two integral current spaces was defined by the second author and wenger in sw 11 imitating gromov s definition of the gromov hausdorff distance 2 15 df x 1 d 1 t 1 x 2 d 2 t 2 inf dzf 1 t 1 2 t 2 where the infimum of the flat distance dzf is taken over all integral current spaces z and all distance preserving maps i xi z here t is the pushforward of the current structure to a current on z defined by 2 16 t t where 2 17 0 1 m 0 m recall the flat distance between two currents on an integral current space z is 2 18 dzf 1 t 1 2 t 2 inf m a m b a b 1 t 1 2 t 2 where a is an m dimensional integral current on z and b is m 1 dimensional to estimate the intrinsic flat distance between two m dimensional integral cur rent spaces one constructs a metric space z which is glued together from pieces which are bilipschitz m 1 dimensional manifolds bi such that 2 19 b bi where i bi 1 x 1 x 2 a here a consists of the leftover pieces of boundary if this is done in an oriented way so that 2 20 1 x 1 2 x 2 b a b d a then since b and a have weight one we have 2 21 df x 1 d 1 t 1 x 2 d 2 t 2 h n a hn 1 b for example if we wish to estimate the intrinsic flat distance between s 2 ds 2 s 2 and s 2 de s 2 then we can consider the metric space z defined in to see that 2 22 df s 2 ds 2 s 2 s 2 de s 2 h 3 d 3 h 3 s 3 2 8 j basilio d kazaras c sormani as in the gromov hausdorff setting it may be difficult to construct integral current spaces z with distance preserving maps i xi di z i 1 2 that give a sharp estimate on the distance between the spaces being considered the intrinsic flat distance between two integral current spaces is 0 if and only if there is a current preserving isometry between them see sw 11 thus for example 2 23 df sm dsm sm sm de sm 0 for a sequence of integral current spaces the gromov hausdorff and intrinsic flat limits do not necessarilly agree however if a sequence of integral current spaces converges in the gromov hausdorff sense then a subsequence converges in the intrinsic flat sense to a subset of the gromov hausdorff limit see sw 10 for example the pair of spheres joined by increasingly thin tunnels converges in the gromov hausdorff sense to a pair of spheres joined by a thread y of sw 11 the same sequence converges in the intrinsic flat sense to the pair of spheres with the thread removed m 2 6 the gromov lawson construction a key ingredient in the proof of the orem 1 1 is the construction of particular riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature on the cylinder s m 1 0 1 for m 3 these metrics smoothly transition between a small round metric on s m 1 1 and the boundary of a ball in an arbi trary riemanian manifold of positive scalar curvature on s m 1 0 gluing two such cylinders together along the round boundary components one obtains a long and thin tunnel called gromov lawson tunnels transitioning between two balls in positive scalar curvature manifolds this allows one for instance to produce metrics of positive scalar curvature on the connected sum of manifolds with posi tive scalar curvature although the original construction is due to gromov lawson gl 80 we will require a recent generalization due to dodziuk dod 18 for our constructions in sections 3 and 4 we will require a detailed description of the construction when applied to manifolds which have regions isometric to geodesic balls in the standard sphere for such an m dimensional positive scalar curvature manifold mm gm fix two points p q m and choose a radius 0 so that the geodesic balls bm p and b m q are disjoint and isometric to geodesic balls in the standard sphere topologically one can perform surgery on the points p q by removing the balls and attaching the cylinder u sm 1 0 1 to the resulting geodesic sphere to obtain m sm 1 s 1 m b p t b q u the gromov lawson construction provides a riemannian metric on u which smoothly attaches to gm on m b p tb q producing a positive scalar curvature metric on m sm 1 s 1 in dod 18 a refinement of the construction is given in order to obtain a qualitative description of the geometry of the metric on u f limit with no geodesics 9 theorem 2 1 dod 18 proposition 1 let p q mm gm and 0 be as above and let l 0 there is a number 0 0 and a riemannian metric g g 0 l on u u 0 l satisfying the following 1 g has positive scalar curvature 2 g and gm can be glued together to form a smooth metric on m bp t bq u 3 disth sm 1 0 sm 1 1 l and diam u o l 4 vol u o l m 10 5 if u is a continuous curve connecting the two boundary components of u then the tubular neighborhood of of radius 2 contains u i e u x u distg x 2 moreover 0 can be chosen arbitrarily small and the estimates in items 3 and 4 depend only on the geometry of bp and bq in dod 18 theorem 2 1 is proven by an explicit construction of a riemannian metric g satisfying conditions 1 through 5 above we give a qualitative descrip tion of this metric remark 2 2 for given parameters 0 0 and l 0 there exists a number l and a function r 0 l l 2 l 2 0 so that 2 24 u 0 l t x l 2 l 2 rm x r t rm 1 and the metric g 0 l in theorem 2 1 is the restriction of the flat metric on l 2 l 2 rm notice that l l but the length of the graph of r 0 l is l for clarity there are unit spheres on the t axis equipped with geodesic balls b 0 b rm 1 y 0 1 and b 0 br m 1 y 0 1 so that 2 25 br n 1 y 0 1 b 0 u 0 l br n 1 y 0 1 b 0 is a smooth hypersurface of rm 1 notice that g is rotationally symmetric in the sense that the natural action of s o m is isometric 3 revised pipe filling technique in positive scalar curvature in this section we state and prove our main technical result theorem 3 1 in it we clarify and expand upon the pipe filling technique originally introduced by the third named author in the appendix to sw 11 more details are given here that could be used to clarify the construction in that appendix as well to write a detailed proof and to incorperate the positive scalar curvature condition we change the technique somewhat let us introduce the setting for the pipe filling technique for m 3 let nm g be an oriented closed m dimensional riemannian manifold with positive scalar curvature suppose we are given points p q n and a radius injn so that bnp and bnq are isometric to geodesic balls in the unit sphere s m we also fix a length l 0 according to theorem 2 1 there is number 0 0 and a manifold 10 j basilio d kazaras c sormani u 0 l g which is topologically s m 1 0 1 has positive scalar curvature and smoothly glues to n to form 3 1 n n b n p t b n q u 0 l denote the corrisponding integral current space by n n dn following remark 2 2 there is a function r 0 l l 2 l 2 0 which upon properly rotating its graph produces the gromov lawson tunnel u 0 l g we emphasize that the function r 0 l depends only on 0 l and is independant of the ambient geometry of n g we also let n 0 denote the space obtained by joining p and q by a line segment 3 2 n 0 n tp 0 q l 0 l denote the corrisponding integral current space by n 0 n 0 dn 0 sm theorem 3 1 let nm g an oriented closed m dimensional riemannian manifold with positive scalar curvature let p q n and 0 injn be so that bn p and bn q are isometric to a spherical geodesic ball b s fix l 0 and let n 0 and n be the resulting integral current spaces described above in 3 1 and 3 2 then there is a constant c 0 continuously depending only on l vol n and diam n so that 3 3 df n 0 n c and 3 4 dgh n 0 dn 0 n dn c the remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of theorem 3 1 3 1 constructing the common space we begin by constructing an integral cur rent space z with boundary n 0 t n which we will use to estimate the flat and gromov hausdorff distances to begin consider the product z n bnp t b n q h 0 h where h 0 and h are given by 3 5 h 2 diam n 2 3 6 h 0 2 diam n 8 the next step is to produce a space a 0 l which will glue into z along its boundary following remark 2 2 the gromov lawson tunnel u 0 l can be viewed as a hypersurface in r rn which transitions between two unit spheres equipped with spherical geodesic balls b 0 b rm 1 y 0 1 b 0 br m 1 y 0 1 r r m the space a 0 l pictured in figure 3 will be constructed in three portions a 0 l a 1 a 2 a 3 f limit with no geodesics 11 the first piece is a product of the gromov lawson tunnel with the segment h 0 0 a 1 t x s l 2 l 2 rn h 0 0 x r 0 l t the second piece consists of two parts half of a rotated gromov lawson tunnel we call the pipe p and a cuspoidal region w as in figure 3 more precisely 3 7 a 2 p w where p t x s l 2 l 2 rm 0 x 2 s 2 r 0 l t 2 br m 1 y 0 1 b rm 1 y 0 1 0 and w b 0

depiction of the region a 0 l the third and final piece a 3 is given by 3 9 a 3 b 0 0 l b 0 h 12 j basilio d kazaras c sormani where the line segment 0 l is attached to the centers of b 0 and b 0 notice that the subset b 0 0 l b 0 a 3 may be isometrically identified with the top portion of a 2 so that the union a 0 l a 1 a 2 a 3 is a well defined integral current space finally a portion of the boundary of a 0 l can be isometrically identified with bnp t b n q h 0 h gluing along this edge we form the integral current space z z a 0 l notice that there is a non continuous height function h z h 0 h and that the hypersurfaces h 1 h 0 and h 1 h can be identified with n 0 and n repsectively let 0 n 0 z and n z denote the corresponding inclusions we also denote z h 1 0 h using the volume estimate of theorem 2 1 and remark 2 2 there is a constant c 0 independant of l and 0 so that 3 10 vol p cl m 0 3 2 the embeddings 0 and are distance preserving here we prove the n 0 and n embed into z by distance preserving maps see lemmas 3 2 and 3 3 lemma 3 2 the embedding 0 n 0 z is distance preserving proof assume on the contrary that there exists points x 1 x 2 n 0 such that 3 11 dz 0 x 1 0 x 2 dn 0 x 1 x 2 then there exists an arclength parametrized curve 0 d z such that 3 12 l d dn 0 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 and d x 2 for ease of notation we will use to denote both the parameterization and its image the remainder of the proof will be broken into claims claim 1 intersects the set 3 13 q p h 1 0 proof inspecting the definition of z there is a distance nonincreasing map from h 1 h 0 0 to h 1 0 and so we may assume that lies in z let 0 z p 0 n 0 be the continuous distance nonincreasing map which takes 3 14 x t z p to 0 x t x h if avoids the pipe then 0 is a curve running between 0 x 1 and 0 x 2 whose length is no greater than d and lies entirely in 0 n 0 which is a contradiction it follows that p now let p p z 0 n 0 be the continuous distance nonincreasing map defined by sending 3 15 y t p sm 0 l f limit with no geodesics 13 to a point in the image of the thread 3 16 p y t t h 0 l 0 n 0 let z 0 n 0 be defined so that z 0 z for z z p and z p z for z p this map is continuous everywhere except on the set q if our curve avoids this set then is a shorter curve between its endpoints whose image lies in 0 n 0 which is a contradiction this establishes claim 1 claim 2 let x n y p q and z qy where qy is the component of q closest to y then we have 3 17 dz 0 x z dz 0 x y h proof let k dz 0 x y h notice that by our choice of h in 3 5 we have 3 18 h 2 2 diam n 2 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 using the product structure of this portion in z we obtain dz 0 x z 2 dn 0 x z 2 h h z 2 dn x y 2 h 2 k 2 h 2 k 2 3 19 completing the proof of claim 2 our next task is to produce a competitor to according to claim 1 we may consider the first and final times denoted by l 1 and l 2 respectively the path passes through the set q we replace the segment 0 l 1 by a minimizing n 0 geodesic 1 0 1 0 n 0 running directly from c 0 to l 1 likewise we replace the segment l 2 d by a minimizing n 0 geodesic 2 2 3 0 n 0 running directly from l 2 to d by claim 2 we know that l 1 l 1 and l 2 l 2 now we have two possibilities either l 2 l 1 or l 2 l 1 if l 2 l 1 then we may form the concatination 1 2 which is path from 0 x 1 to 0 x 2 lying entirely within 0 n 0 and has length l d this contradicts our assumption and we are done now assume that l 2 l 1 we can consider a minimizing n 0 geodesic 3 1 2 z which runs from l 1 to l 2 notice that l 3 l l 1 l 2 which can be seen using it follows that the concatination 1 3 2 is a path from 0 x 1 to 0 x 2 lying entirely within 0 n 0 and has length l d also yielding the desired contradiction lemma 3 3 the map n z is distance preserving proof assume on the contrary that there exists x 1 x 2 n such that 3 20 dz x 1 x 2 dn x 1 x 2 then there exists an arclength parametrized curve 0 d z such that l d dn x 1 x 2 and 0 x 1 and d x 2 as before we will break the remainder of the proof into smaller claims 14 j basilio d kazaras c sormani claim 3 we may assume that h 1 h 0 and must intersect the set h 1 0 proof we first notice that we may assume h 1 h 0 this can be seen by applying the distance nonincreasing map 1 h 1 h h 1 defined by 1 x t x to any portion of lying above height on the other hand there is a projection mapping 2 h 1 h 0 0 h 1 h 0 which is distance nonincreasing due to the product structure of z there it follows that must pass through the set h 1 0 since begins and ends at height h 0 must intersect h 1 0 claim 4 the curve can be replaced by a curve 0 d z satisfying the following 1 0 0 and d d 2 l l 8 3 does not pass through the interior of the region a 2 h 1 0 proof if passes through w we replace this segment of by a path lying entirely within w since the diameter of w is less than 4 8 this replacement yields a curve with l l 8 finally suppose intersects the pipe p by perhaps altering but preserving its length bound we can assume that the first and final times passes through p occur on h 1 0 p now due to the rotational symmetry of p the distance be tween two points in the equitorial slice h 1 0 can be realized by a path contained in it it follows that may be replaced by a curve of no greater length which does not pass through the interior of p since lies in h 1 h 0 and does not pass through the interior of a 2 we may assume that lies in h 1 h 0 0 due to the product structure of h 1 0 a 2 moreover we may assume that h 1 0 is connected by projecting any portion exiting and entering h 1 0 back up to h 1 0 we proceed in two cases first suppose the original curve does not pass through the region a 2 since the region h 1 h 0 a 2 has a product structure we can project down to h 1 h 0 to obtain a shorter curve now suppose and hence intersects a 2 consider times l 1 and l 2 which correspond to the first and final times respectively when passes through h 1 0 we will proceed by constructing a competing curve to let 1 0 1 n be a minimizing n geodesic traveling from x 1 to 2 l 1 likewise let 2 2 3 n be a minimizing n geodesic traveling from 2 l 2 to x 2 using the product structure of h 1 h 0 0 we immediately obtain the following claim claim 5 the following inequalities hold 3 21 l 0 l 1 l 1 2 h 20 l l 2 d l 2 2 h 20 finally let 3 1 2 h 1 h 0 be a minimizing n geodesic running from 2 l 1 to 2 l 2 since l 1 l 2 lies entirely in h 1 0 the following f limit with no geodesics 15 inequality holds 3 22 l l 1 l 2 l 3 now by our choice of h 0 in 3 6 one can show h 20 2 diam n 2 2 2 l 1 2 2 l 1 2 l 1 2 and it follows that 3 23 l i 2 h 20 l i holds for i 1 2 to conclude we may sum inequalities 3 21 and 3 22 to find l l 8 l 1 2 h 20 l 2 2 h 20 l 3 8 l 1 l 2 l 3 this shows that the concatination 1 3 2 is a competitor to of no greater length which lies entirely in the embedding n yielding a contradiction 3 3 proving the pipe filling theorem now that we have confirmed that the inte gral current spacesn 0 andn have distance preseving embeddings into the bound ary of z the proof of theorem 3 1 will be complete upon estimating the volume of z proof of theorem 3 1 let b denote the current on z defined by integration on its m dimensional stratum according to lemmas 3 2 and 3 3 the integral current space z dz z z b with embeddings 0 and is an admissable set of data with which to estimate the intrinsic flat distance between n 0 and n in other words 3 24 df n 0 n m b vol z we will estimate the volume of z by inspecting the three peices in its construc tion vol z vol n h 0 0 vol z vol z by the volume estimate in theorem 2 1 we can estimate vol n h 0 0 h 0 vol n h 0 vol n 2 vol bp vol p h 1 0 h 0 vol n c 1 l m and vol z vol n 0 vol p vol n c 2 l m 16 j basilio d kazaras c sormani where c 1 c 2 0 come from theorem 2 1 and estimate 3 10 and are independant of and l the final piece of z evidently has volume vol z vol n h h vol n summing the above three inequalities we obtain the estimate 3 3 finally we consider the gromov hausdorff distance between n and n 0 since the maps n z and 0 n 0 z are distance preserving 3 25 dgh n n 0 d z h n 0 n 0 by considering the lengths of verticle paths running between h 1 h and h 1 h 0 it follows that d z h n 0 n 0 h 0 2 h where we have used part 5 of theorem 2 1 the inequality 3 4 follows 4 constructing spheres with tunnels and spheres with threads in this section we construct the sequences we will use to prove theorem 1 1 first we construct spheres with increasingly dense threads denoted by y j dy j and spheres with increasingly dense tunnels denoted by x j dx j see defini tions 4 2 and 4 1 respectively to y j d y j we associate the integral current space sm dy j sm see definition 4 3 which no longer contains the threads the sec ond sequence x j dx j also has an integral current structure t j described in definition 4 4 4 1 the geodesic spaces y dy and x dx in this subsection we fix 0 and construct two geodesic spaces a sphere with threads y dy and a sphere with tunnels x dx we begin by choosing a collection of points p 1 pn in the sphere sm so that bpi n i 1 are pairwise disjoint and bpi 2 n i 1 forms an open cover of s m the number of points required to form such a collection n is on the order of sin m though we will not need explicit knowledge of it next for every 0 and i 1 2 n we will choose n 1 points which lie on the geodesic sphere bpi we denote the points by q i j j 1 i n where i indicates that the index i is ommitted we choose qij sufficiently spaced so that 4 1 dsm q i j q i j n holds for each j j and all i we now describe a way to pairing the points qij between different balls bpi so that we may connect them with line segments or tunnels for each i 1 n and j 1 i n we pair qij bpi with q j i bp j let l i j be the euclidean distance between paired points 4 2 lij dem 1 q i j q j i 2 2 cos dsm qij q j i f limit with no geodesics 17 now we may define the sphere with threads definition 4 1 define y to be the sphere with attached line segments 0 lij by identifying its boundary to the paired points qij q j i y s m n i j 0 lij 4 3 we give y the induced length metric denoted by dy next we construct the sphere with tunnels definition 4 2 fix the radius n 2 and notice that inequality 4 1 implies the geodesic balls bqij are disjoint define x by removing the balls bqij for each i 1 n and j 1 i n and attaching gromov lawson tunnels u ji s m 1 0 1 of length lij and radius along the boundaries of bqij and bq ji more precisely we equip u ji with the gromov lawson tunnel obtained by the construction in section 3 this yields the riemannian manifold of positive scalar curvature x sm n i j bqij n i j u ji we denote the induced length metric by dx 4 2 the integral current spaces n and m are defined we now describe the natural integral current space structures associated to these metric spaces recall that definition of an integral current space requires that every point have positive m dimensional density definition 4 3 the integral current we associate to y dy is integration over s m and the integral current space is sm dy sm and we will be denoted by n note that the threads are removed in the integral current space and we are left with the sphere but distances on the sphere are measured using dy instead of dsm definition 4 4 the integral current associated to x dx is given by integration over the oriented riemannian manifold x the integral current space will be denoted by m so 4 4 t t 1 i j t i j where t 1 is integration over the punctured sphere s m u and t i j is integration over the gromov lawson tunnel u ji 18 j basilio d kazaras c sormani 5 intrinsic flat convergence of m j we now prove our main result that m j f converges to m as j 0 we first prove they are close to the n j proposition 5 1 and then prove the n j converge to m proposition 5 2 we end this section with a proof of theorem 1 1 5 1 spheres with tunnels are close to spheres with threads we now apply theorem 3 1 inductively to prove that our sequence of spheres with increasingly dense tunnels definition 4 2 are increasingly close to our sequence of spheres with increasingly dense threads definition 4 1 proposition 5 1 there is a constant c 0 so that for all sufficiently small 0 we have 5 1 df m n c proof for each 0 enumerate the collection of pairs qij q j i s m from 1 to k n n 1 2 for k 1 k let m k denote the integral current space resulting from replacing the first k tunnels u ji in the construction of m with the corresponding threads 0 lij as in the construction of n notice that m 0 m and m k n we will require some more properties of m k evidently lij 2 and diam m k for all k and all now part 4 of theorem 2 1 implies that there is a constant c 1 0 so that vol u ij c 1 m 1 using this and our choice of one may estimate vol m k vol s m n i j vol u ij vol sm n 2 c 1 m 1 vol sm m 1 c 2 which is bounded above uniformly in k and having uniform control on the above quantities we can conclude that the constant in inequality 3 3 obtained from applying theorem 3 1 to a ball bqij in m k is uniformly bounded in k and by some constant c 3 now we iteratively apply theorem 3 1 to finish the proof df m n k k 1 df m k 1 m k n 2 c 3 c 3 5 2 spheres with threads are close to sphere with the restricted euclidean metric our next goal is to show that the spheres with increasingly dense threads f limit with no geodesics 19 n converge to the sphere with the restricted euclidean distance m in the intrinsic flat sense proposition 5 2 the integral current spaces n converge to m in the intrinsic flat sense as 0 proof notice that the underlying spaces and integral currents of y and m are identical for all in this setting to show n m in the intrinsic flat sense it suffices to show 5 2 sup sm sm dy de 0 and the existance of a 0 independant of so that 5 3 1 dy x y de x y for all x y sm see theorem 9 5 3 for details we will proceed by verrifying conditions 5 2 and 5 3 for 0 and x y sm choose points pi and pi in the net pi n i 1 closest to x and y respectively now dy x y dsm x q i i de q i i q i i dsm q i i y 6 de q i i q i i 5 4 where the first inequality follows from the fact that de qii q i i dy q i i q i i and the second inequality follows from our choice of points q ji bpi now we would like to compare de x y and de qii q i i notice that de q i i q i i de x q i i de x y de q i i y 6 de q i i q i i 5 5 combining inequalities 5 4 and 5 5 we obtain dy x y de x y 12 this implies condition 5 2 all that remains is to verrify condition 5 3 to this end we restrict our attention to 0 small enough so that 1 100 r 2 2 2 cos r holds for all r 0 now we consider two cases first assume that x y sm satisfy de x y then inequalities 5 4 and 5 5 imply dy x y de x y 13 5 6 20 j basilio d kazaras c sormani next assume that x y sm satisfy de x y in this case notice that we may assume that dy x y ds x y since bx will intersect at most one of the balls bqij for small enough with this in mind we can estimate de x y 2 2 2 cos dy x y 1 100 dy x y 2 rearranging this we find 5 7 dy x y de x y 10 finally notice that for any x y sm 5 8 1 dy x y de x y combining 5 6 5 7 and 5 8 we conclude that condition 5 3 holds with 13 finishing the proof 5 3 proof of theorem 1 1 by the triangle inequality propositons 5 1 and 5 2 we see that df m m df m n df n m 0 as 0
