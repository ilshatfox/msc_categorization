sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold q of a symplectic ka hler manifold x can be realised as a morse bott min imum for some convex exhausting function defined in the complement of a symplectic complex hyperplane section y in the ka hler case convex means strictly plurisubharmonic while in the symplectic case it refers to the existence of a liouville pseudogradient in particular q x y is a regular lagrangian submanifold in the sense of eliashberg ganatra lazarev rational convexity properties of lagrangian submanifolds were first discovered in c 2 by duval who later investigated them further with his collaborators and students in particular generalising a result established by duval sibony ds 95 in cn guedj gue 99 obtained the following theorem in a complex projective manifold x every closed lagrangian submanifold q is rationally convex which means that x q is filled up with smooth complex hypersurfaces more precisely these complex hypersurfaces y are very ample divisors of arbitrarily large degrees so their complements are affine manifolds and possess exhausting c convex 1 func tions f x y r in this work which was motivated by the study of vanishing cycles in global picard lefschetz theory we give a necessary and sufficient con dition for the existence of such a function f admitting q as a morse bott i e transversally non degenerate minimum this condition refers to a ka hler class and can be more generally stated as follows in the symplectic setting definition 1 let x be an integral symplectic manifold meaning that x is a closed manifold and a symplectic form with integral periods we say that a lagrangian submanifold q satisfies the bohr sommerfeld condition or sim ply is bohr sommerfeld if the homomorphism h 2 x q z r defined by integration of takes its values in z 1 here the term c convex is used as a substitute for strictly plurisubharmonic 1 http arxiv org abs 1803 07162 v 1 in the ka hler setting our main result is theorem 2 let x be a closed integral ka hler manifold and q a closed la grangian submanifold satisfying the bohr sommerfeld condition then for every sufficiently large integer k there exist a complex hyperplane section y of degree k in x avoiding q and an exhausting c convex function f x y r that has a morse bott minimum at q and is morse away from q with finitely many critical points to be more explicit there exists a holomorphic line bundle l x with first chern class such that the complex hypersurface y is the zero set of a holomorphic section of the k th tensor power lk of l in agm 01 auroux gayet mohsen reproved guedj s above theorem and ex tended it to the symplectic setting using the ideas and techniques developed by donaldson in don 96 theorem 2 also has a symplectic version whose statement below appeals to the following terminology a symplectic hyperplane section of degree k in a closed integral symplec tic manifold x is a symplectic submanifold y of codimension 2 that is poincare dual to k a function f x y r is convex if it admits a pseudogradient that is a liouville i e dual to some primitive of vector field with this wording donaldson s main theorem in don 96 is that every closed inte gral symplectic manifold contains symplectic hyperplane sections of all sufficiently large degrees furthermore according to auroux gayet mohsen agm 01 such symplectic hyperplane sections can be constructed away from any given closed la grangian submanifold on the other hand giroux showed in gir 18 that for all sufficiently large degrees the complements of donaldson s symplectic hyperplane sections admit exhausting convex functions and hence are weinstein manifolds mixing these ingredients we obtain theorem 3 let x be a closed integral symplectic manifold and q a closed bohr sommerfeld lagragian submanifold of x then for every sufficiently large integer k there exist a symplectic hyperplane section y of degree k in x avoiding q and an exhausting convex function f x y r that has a morse bott minimum at q and is morse away from q with finitely many critical points in egl 15 eliashberg ganatra lazarev introduced the following definition a lagrangian submanifold q in a weinstein manifold w is regular if there exists a liouville pseudogradient on w that is tangent to q or equivalently there exists a primitive of vanishing on q this property which implies that q is 2 an exact lagrangian submanifold is known for quite a long time to be a strong constraint for instance it is elementary to see without any holomorphic curve theory that a closed lagrangian submanifold incn cannot be regular in the same time though we do not have any example of a non regular closed exact lagrangian submanifold in a weinstein manifold we do not know any general method to prove that exact lagrangian submanifolds should a priori be regular theorems 2 and 3 show that in the complement of the complex and symplectic hyperplane sections constructed the bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold q is included in the zero set of a liouville pseudogradient and is therefore regular in section 1 we explain why the bohr sommerfeld condition is necessary for our purposes and describe some of properties of bohr sommerfeld lagrangians in section 2 we prove theorem 3 applying the main technical result from gir 18 in section 3 we prove theorem 2 and a complex geometric analogue using techniques that go back to ds 95 acknowledgements this work is part of my ph d prepared at e ns de lyon under the supervision of emmanuel giroux i warmly thank him for his help and support and jean

erated by the french national research agency anr and by the umi 3457 of cnrs crm 1 bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifolds let us first remark that cieliebak mohnke proved in cm 17 theorem 8 3 a version of the main theorem of agm 01 that is specific to bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifolds the bohr sommerfeld condition in theorems 2 and 3 is necessary indeed lemma 4 let x be a closed symplectic manifold and q a lagrangian sub manifold suppose that there exist a symplectic hyperplane section y x of degree k avoiding q and a primitive of over x y such that q is exact then q is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold of x k proof it suffices to prove the following well known claim let x be a closed connected oriented manifold y x a closed codimension 2 submanifold and a non exact closed 2 form on x that is poincare dual to y then for every compact surface x with boundary disjoint from y and primitive of on x y such that q is exact y 3 we first suppose that y is connected for any embedded 2 disc d intersecting y transversely at one point with sign d 1 set r d d d the residue r does not depend on the disc d indeed for two such discs d and d connectedness of y gives an oriented cylinder c in x y bounding d d and d d so by stokes theorem d d d d c d d d d let x be a compact surface intersecting y away from by a general position argument we may suppose the intersection is transverse for each point pi y take a disc di that intersects y only at pi stokes theorem gives idi i di then y r 1 since is not exact we can apply 1 to some closed surface 0 with 0 y 0 6 0 this gives r 1 so 1 proves the claim suppose y is not connected if dimx 3 the cycle y may be represented by a closed connected submanifold namely an embedded away from 0 connected sum of the connected components of y if dimx 2 we may represent y by some integral multiple of any point consequently we reduce to the previous case meanwhile the bohr sommerfeld condition can be easily obtained after a mod ification of the symplectic form lemma 5 approximation and rescaling let x be a closed symplectic man ifold and q a closed lagrangian submanifold then there exists a small closed 2 form and an integer k such that q is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian subman ifold of x k proof we argue as in agm 01 the 2 form vanishes onq so in view of the exact sequence h 2 x q r h 2 x r h 2 q r it is the image of a relative class c h 2 x q r we approximate c by some r h 2 x q q and take a small closed form vanishing on q that represents c r then the closed form is symplectic vanishes on q and its relative periods given by evaluation of r are rational we now give the characterisation of bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submani folds that we will use to prove theorems 2 and 3 4 lemma 6 hermitian flat line bundles let x be an integral symplectic man ifold and q a submanifold then q is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold if and only if there exist a hermitian line bundle l x and a unitary connection of curvature 2 i such that l q is a trivial flat bundle if q is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian and in addition x is ka hler then one can take for l a holomorphic hermitian line bundle with its chern connection proof suppose thatq is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold since has integral periods we may fix a lift c of its cohomology class to h 2 x z we take a hermitian line bundle l 0 x with first chern class c and a unitary connection 0 of curvature 2 i the submanifold q is lagrangian so the restriction l 0 0 q is a flat hermitian bundle we will construct a flat hermitian line bundle l 1 1 x whose restriction to q is isomorphic to l 0 0 q then the desired line bundle will be l 0 l 1 1 recall that flat hermitian line bundles over a manifold y are classified up to isomorphism by their holonomy representation h 1 y z u 1 cf proposition 3 6 15 in thu 97 to construct the flat bundle l 1 1 it suffices to extend the holonomy representation h 1 q z u 1 of the flat bundle l 0 0 q to a homomorphism h 1 x z u 1 we first show that vanishes on the kernel of the group homomorphism i h 1 q z h 1 x z induced by inclusion consider the exact sequence of the pair x q h 2 x q z h 1 q z i h 1 x z where is the homomorphism given by the boundary of chains it suffices to show that 0 every a h 2 x q z can be represented by an embedded surface x whose possibly empty boundary is included in q it then follows from well known lemma 7 that a exp 2 i a 2 since the lagrangian submanifold q is bohr sommerfeld a 0 thus factors through a homomorphism h 1 q z ker i u 1 where h 1 q z ker i injects into h 1 x z now u 1 is a divisible abelian group so it is an injective z module see for instance wei 95 corollary 2 3 2 hence extends to h 1 x z in the case where x is ka hler the above hermitian line bundle l 0 0 can be chosen holomorphic with its chern connection see e g dem 12 theo rem 13 9 b on the other hand the flat line bundle l 1 1 is isomorphic to the quotient of the trivial flat bundle x c by the diagonal action of the fun damental group acting on its universal cover x by deck transformations and on 5 c by the holonomy representation h 1 x z u 1 cf proposition 3 6 15 in thu 97 therefore the trivial holomorphic structure and the trivial connection on x c respectively induce a holomorphic structure and the chern connection on l 1 consequently the bundle l 0 l 1 1 has the desired properties conversely let x be a symplectic manifold and a hermitian line bundle l x with a unitary connexion of curvature 2 i such that l q is a trivial flat bundle then the trivial holonomy representation of l q satisfies 2 so q is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian lemma 7 gauss bonnet let x be a manifold and l x a hermitian line bundle with a unitary connection whose curvature 2 form is written 2 i let be a connected oriented surface with non empty boundary and f x a map the holonomy of along the loop f is exp 2 i f u 1 proof we may assume x and f id by pulling back the line bundle l by f there is a unit section s l in the trivialisation of l given by s there is a primitive of such that the connection reads d 2 i by stokes theorem we may assume that is connected take 0 1 a parametrisation of for every unit parallel lift 0 1 l of and for all t 0 1 t 2 i t t t hence 2 i 0 1 t t dt log 1 0 an exponentiation gives the result 2 as minima of convex functions in this section we prove theorem 3 so q is a closed bohr sommerfeld la grangian submanifold in a closed integral symplectic manifold x we fix an compatible almost complex structure j on x and denote by g j the corresponding riemannian metric we denote by 0 the liouville form on t q the metric induced by g on q determines a norm on each fibre of t q q we define the function f 0 t q r 0 by f 0 p p 2 using weinstein s normal form theorem we identify a neighbourhood n of q x with a tube f 0 c around the zero section q in t q d 0 in such a way that for all q q the subspaces tqq t q q tq t q are g orthogonal using lemma 6 we fix a hermitian line bundle l x with a unitary con nection of curvature 2 i and a unit parallel section s 0 of the flat bundle 6 l q parallel transport by along the rays in the fibres of t q extends s 0 to a section s n l n we extend the section s 0 by s 0 e f 0 s n l n in the following we denote by lk the k th tensor power of the line bundle l the induced connection has curvature 2 k i we set gk kg the rescaled metric for any integer r 0 we endow the vector bundle r t x lk with the connection induced by the levi civita connection for the metric gk and our connection on lk we still write this connection the j linear and j linear parts of the connexion are written and we define the cr norm of a section u x lk by u cr gk sup u sup u gk sup ru gk for any 1 form on x we will denote by the vector field that is k dual to where k will be given by the context lemma 8 there exists a constant c 0 such that for every integer k 1 the function f 0 and the section s k 0 satisfy the following bounds on n 0 kf 0 c 1 0 2 gk d kf 0 2 gk c 1 kf 0 1 2 d kf 0 gk c kf 0 1 2 sk 0 gk c kf 0 1 2 e kf 0 2 sk 0 c 0 gk c and sk 0 c 1 gk ck 1 2 proof by rescaling it suffices to establish the first two bounds of the statement for k 1 the function f 0 is lyapounov for the vector field 0 this implies the first bound the submanifold q is a morse bott minimum for f 0 hence the second bound since s 0 e f 0 s with s parallel s 0 df 0 e f 0 s e f 0 s df 0 2 i 0 s 0 therefore s 0 vanishes identically on the zero section hence there exists a constant c 0 such that s 0 g cf 1 2 0 moreover the 1 jet of s 0 vanishes identically on q indeed by the identity 0 0 here k 1 and by j linearity of the 1 form g 0 i 0 s 0 2 df 0 2 i 0 s 0 2 df 0 2 g 0 s 0 so it suffices to show that the 1 jet of the 1 form df 0 2 g 0 vanishes identically along q its 0 jet clearly vanishes and for each vector v v 1 v 2 in the g orthogonal sum t t q q tq t q d g 0 v v g v v 0 g v v 2 g v 2 v 2 d 2 f 0 v v 2 hence its 1 jet vanishes too consequently there exists a constant c 0 such that s 0 g cf 1 2 0 and s 0 g cf 0 therefore by the leibniz rule we obtain 7 the desired bounds on sk 0 and 2 sk 0 and the two bounds sk 0 gk ck 1 2 f 0 e kf 0 sk 0 gk kf 3 2 0 f 1 2 0 ce kf 0 the two latter real valued gaussian functions of f 0 both reach their global maximum at constant k 1 so we obtain the last bound of the statement we will state next lemma using auroux s following definition 9 sections sk x l k are called asymptotically holomorphic if there exists a constant c 0 such that for every positive integer k sk c 1 gk ck 1 2 and sk c 2 gk c the following result was already observed in auroux gayet mohsen agm 01 remark p 746 recall that our neighbourhood n of q is identified with the cotangent tube f 0 c lemma 10 let n 0 1 be a compactly supported function independent of k with 1 on a tube f 0 b then the sections s 0 k s k 0 x l k are asymptotically holomorphic proof of lemma 10 the sections sk 0 satisfy the estimates of lemma 8 on n then there exists a constant c 0 such that s 0 k c 0 gk d c 0 gk sup f 0 b sk 0 sk 0 c 0 gk ck 1 2 e bk ck 1 2 similarly s 0 k c 0 gk d 2 c 0 gk sup f 0 b sk 0 2 d c 0 gk sup f 0 b sk 0 gk sk 0 c 0 gk cke bk 2 ck 1 2 ck 1 2 c 1 2 e bk ck 1 2 hence there exists a constant c 0 such that for all k s 0 k c 1 gk ck 1 2 in the same way we obtain the bound s 0 k c 2 gk c giroux s theorem below provides transverse perturbations our sections s 0 k with the following property definition 11 giroux let 0 1 a section s x lk is called quasiholomorphic if s s at each point of x theorem 12 gir 18 proposition 13 let 0 0 1 and s 0 k x l k asymptotically holomorphic sections then for any sufficiently large integer k there exists a section s 1 k x l k with the following properties 8 s 1 k vanishes transversally s 1 k is quasiholomorphic s 1 k s 0 k c 1 gk log s 1 k p x s p 6 0 r is a morse function let us now bring the arguments together to prove theorem 3 proof of theorem 3 using lemma 10 we fix sections s 0 k x l k with s 0 k s k 0 on a tube f 0 b we then fix 0 1 and take sections s 1 k x l k provided by theorem 12 the subset y s 1 k 0 x is a symplectic hyperplane section of degree k because of the first two properties of theorem 12 see for instance proposition 3 in don 96 avoiding the submanifold q because s 0 1 on q and by the third property of theorem 12 it remains to construct an convex exhaustion f x y r that has a morse bott minimum at q and is morse away from q with finitely many critical points on the one hand the function f 0 k kf 0 n r has a morse bott minimum at q and by lemma 8 is lyapounov for the liouville vector field 0 with a uniform lyapounov constant in the metric gk on the other hand the exhaustive function f 1 k log s 1 k is morse by the last property of theorem 12 and has finitely many critical points because s 1 k vanishes transversally a pseudgradient for f 1 k is provided by giroux s following lemma before stating it we set 1 k the real 1 form such that in the unitary trivialisation of l k x y given by s 1 k s 1 k the connection reads d 2 k i 1 k we also recall that the notation stands for the k dual vector field to a given 1 form where k is given by the context lemma 13 gir 18 lemma 12 let 0 1 and s 1 k x l k a quasiholomorphic section then 1 k f 1 k 1 2 1 2 1 2 df 1 k 2 gk 1 k 2 gk hence the function f 1 k is lyapounov for the liouville vector field 1 k with a uniform lyapounov constant in the metric gk finally the desired function f is constructed in the following lemma by gluing on an annular region a f 0 k b about q the standard morse bott weinstein structure 0 f 0 k on t q with the weinstein structure 1 k f 1 k given by giroux s above theorem lemma 14 let 0 1 and a b 0 c with a b then for every sufficiently small 0 1 and for every k k 0 sufficiently large there exist a liouville 9 vector field on x y and a lyapounov function f x y r for such that f 0 f 0 k on f 0 k a and f 1 k f 1 k away from f 1 k b proof we will omit the indices k in the proof we observe first that for sufficiently small the section s 1 does not vanish on n and the tube f 1 b is contained in n because s 1 s 0 c 0 and inf f 0 c s 0 e c let us prove that there exists a constant c 0 independent of k such that f 0 f 1 c 1 n gk c 3 and that for sufficiently small 0 the form 1 0 is exact on n on the one hand f 0 f 1 re log s 1 s 1 0 and since uj sj sj satisfies uj 2 k i juj 1 0 1 2 k i u 10 u 0 u 1 1 u 1 1 2 k i d log u 0 u 1 1 1 2 k d arg s 1 s 1 0 on the other hand log s 1 s 1 0 c 1 gk c this is a consequence of the three bounds s 1 s 0 c 1 gk inf s 0 e c and s 0 c 0 gk constant from lemma 8 in particular we obtain the bound 3 and for sufficiently small arg s 1 s 1 0 c 0 3 so 1 0 is exact now for b a 2 the annular region a f 0 b contains the level set f 1 b a 2 by the bound 3 we construct a lyapounov function f x r for the vector field 0 with f f 0 on f 0 a and f f 1 away from f 1 b a 2 it suffices to show that 0 is transverse to the level sets of f 0 and f 1 in the region a f 0 f 1 b a 2 indeed increasing from a to b along each trajectory of 0 gives a function f transverse to the level sets of f 0 and f 1 there exists a constant c 0 such that df 0 gk c by lemma 8 by the latter bound and 3 df 1 gk c c so by the lyapounov conditions there exists a constant c 0 such that 0 f 0 c and 1 f 1 c by the latter bound and again 3 0 is transverse to the level sets of f 1 it remains to construct a liouville vector field transverse to the level sets of the function f in the annular region b a 2 f 1 b where f f 1 and co nciding with 0 on f 1 b a 2 and with 1 outside f 1 b in view of our initial computation we have a function h such that 1 0 dh let us fix a cutoff function r 0 1 such that 0 near r b a 2 and 1 near r b and set 1 f 1 then the vector field 0 d 1 h is liouville and satisfies the desired boundary conditions moreover 1 is tangent to the level sets of f 1 and by the above paragraph 0 and 1 are transverse to these so 1 1 0 1 1 1 h is transverse to these too 10 remark 15 an alternative proof of the regularity of q x y for sufficiently large k it is possible to choose our quasiholomorphic perturbation s 1 k x l k vanishing transversally and away from q of s 0 k in such a way that the quotient function s 1 k s 0 k q is real valued the latter property which can be achieved by implementing techniques from auroux munoz presas amp 05 in the proof of gir 18 proposition 13 implies that the liouville pseudogradient 1 k of the function log s 1 k is tangent to q 3 as minima of c convex functions this section deals with the proof of theorem 2 so q is a closed bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold in a closed integral ka hler manifold x using lemma 6 we fix a holomorphic hermitian line bundle l x with chern curvature 2 i and a parallel unit section s 0 q l q we denote by the chern connection we denote by dk the distance function to q in the metric gk k i and we set bk q c dk c we recall that we endow the vector bundle r t x lk with the connection induced by the levi civita connection for the metric gk and the connection on l k we still write this connection we de fine the cr norm of a section u x lk by u cr gk sup u r j 1 sup ju gk since q is a totally real submanifold of x it has a neighbourhood on which the squared distance function d 21 is c convex see for instance proposition 2 15 in ce 12 so some neighbourhood n b 1 q c is a stein manifold by results of oka oka 39 and grauert gra 58 the line bundle l n admits a non vanishing holomorphic section s n l n furthermore given any integer r 1 ce 12 proposition 5 55 shows that the complex valued function s 0 s q extends to a smooth function f n c such that the form d f vanishes identically along q together with its r jet we will eventually choose r n the complex dimension of the manifold x we then extend s 0 over n by setting s 0 fs n l n remark 16 the real analytic case if the submanifold q is real analytic then one can take for s 0 n l n a holomorphic section indeed one may ensure that the connection on the bundle l provided by lemma 6 is real analytic in that case the section s 0 q l q is real analytic and can be complexified lemma 17 there exist a constant c 0 such that for every integer k 1 the section sk 0 n l k n satisfies the following bounds on n 2 k ddc log sk 0 gk ck 1 2 dk e cd 2 k sk 0 e d 2 k c sk 0 gk cdke d 2 k c sk 0 c 1 gk ck r 2 k r 2 11 proof we first observe that s 0 vanishes at every point p q indeed tpx tpq i tpq because q is totally real of middle dimension s 0 p s 0 p because s 0 p 0 and s 0 p vanishes on tpq because s 0 q is parallel thus there exists a constant c 0 such that s 0 cd 1 similarly since the r jet of s 0 vanishes identically on q there exists a constant c 0 such that s 0 g 1 cd r 1 1 and s 0 g 1 cd r 1 we now consider the function f 0 log s 0 clearly f 0 p 0 and df 0 p 1 2 d log s 0 2 1 2 s 0 2 d s 0 2 s 0 2 re s 0 s 0 0 moreover 2 p dd cf 0 p dd c log s s 0 id d log s s 0 2 id d log f 2 p 0 because the 1 jet of the form d f vanishes at p therefore there exists a con stant c 0 such that 2 ddcf 0 g cd 1 multiplicating this by k gives the first bound of the statement on the other hand the hessian quadratic form d 2 f 0 p tpx r vanishes on tpq and satisfies for every vector v tpx d 2 f 0 v v d 2 f 0 iv iv dd cf 0 v iv 2 v iv 2 g v v hence d 2 f 0 p is positive definite on i tpq and q is a morse bott minimum for f 0 since q is compact one can find a constant c 0 such that on some neighbourhood of q for the metric g 1 d 21 c f 0 cd 2 1 in other words e cd 2 1 s e d 2 1 c we obtain the second bound of the statement by taking the k th power the third bound and the bounds sk 0 g ckd r 1 1 e kd 2 1 c sk 0 g ckd r 1 1 kd 2 1 e kd 2 1 c follow from this bound and the bounds on s 0 s 0 and s 0 by the leibniz rule applied to sk 0 the two latter real valued gaussian functions of d 1 both reach their global maximum at constant k 1 2 by expressing these bounds in the rescaled metric gk we obtain the last bound of the statement the following is the main result of this section proposition 18 let 0 c there exist holomorphic sections sk x l k such that for every 0 and for k k 0 sufficiently large sk vanishes transver sally and sk s k 0 c 1 gk on b 1 q the neighbourhood of q in the metric g 12 we postpone the proof of proposition 18 and first explain how it implies the orem 2 proof of theorem 2 we fix a radius 0 c and by proposition 18 holomorphic sections sk x l k for every 0 and for k k 1 sufficiently large the zero set y s 1 k 0 is a smooth complex hyperplane section and sk s k 0 c 1 gk on b 1 q by the second and third inequalities in lemma 17 there exists a constant c 0 independent of k and such that for 0 sufficiently small on bk q the functions f 1 log sk and f 0 log s k 0 satisfy f 1 f 0 c 1 gk c take a cutoff function k x 0 1 supported in bk q with k 1 on bk q 2 and k c 2 gk c for some constant c 0 independent of k the function f kf 0 1 k f 1 x y r is exhausting reaches a morse bott minimum at q and its critical points remain in a compact subset we remark that for sufficiently small this minimum is global indeed on k 1 f f 0 and on k 1 f 1 log s 0 log e 2 c 0 let us show that f isc convex first since sk is holomorphic dd cf 1 2 k then by the first bound of lemma 17 there exists a constant c 0 such that ddc f 0 f 1 c 0 gk c k 1 2 hence 2 k ddcf c 0 gk ddc k f 0 f 1 c 0 gk k c k 1 2 f 0 f 1 dd c k d f 0 f 1 d c k d c f 1 f 0 d k c k 1 2 3 c c 4 consequently for every 0 sufficiently small and for every k k 0 sufficiently large 2 k ddcf c 0 gk 2 this inequality ensures that the function f is c convex a c 2 small perturbation of the function f with support in a compact subset of y q is morse away from q and satisfies the properties of theorem 2 our next aim is to prove proposition 18 in the following lemma the l 2 norm of a section s x r t x lk for the rescaled metric gk is defined by s l 2 gk x s 2 gk k n n 1 2 lemma 19 let x 0 1 a function supported in n with 1 on a tube b q there exists a constant c 0 such that the sections s 0 k s k

discussion thereafter let x be a closed integral ka hler manifold and l x a holomorphic hermitian line bundle with chern curvature 2 i set c sup ricci 2 g then for every k c and for every smooth section u x 1 0 t x lk such that u 0 there exists a smooth section t x lk satisfying t u and t 2 l 2 1 n k c u 2 l 2 applying this theorem to the sections s 0 k of lemma 19 we obtain smooth sections

bound is local at a given point p x we will obtain it on a gk ball of uniform radius about p where for sufficenlty large k the geometry of lk compares with the trivial line bundle over the unit ball of euclidean space cn g 0 there exist constants r c 0 and a family indexed by p k of holomorphic charts zkp bk p r c n centered at p such that zkp gk g 0 c 1 g 0 ck 1 2 over zkp bk p r 5 indeed we take some constant r 0 and a smooth family indexed by p x of centered holomorphic charts zp b p r c n with isometric differentials dzp p at the origin the post composition of zp by the centered dilation c n cn of ratio k 1 2 gives zkp let us take a ho rmander holomorphic peak section at p see for instance don 96 proposition 34 for sufficiently large k there exists a holomorphic section sp x l k satisfying the bounds sp p 1 inf bk p r sp c 1 and sp c 1 gk c for some constant c 0 independent of p and k let t be a section of lk and p b q we set f t sp in view of the identities t df sp f sp t d 2 f sp 2 df sp f sp and the bounds on the peak sections it suffices to show that for sufficently large k f c 1 bk p r 6 gk c d f c 1 bk p r gk c f l 2 bk p r gk in the following we will identify the domain of the chart zkp with its image in cn we denote by b 0 q r the ball of radius r at a point q in c n and by the euclidean volume form on cn let us prove the standard following bound f c 1 b 0 0 r 5 g 0 c d f c 1 b 0 0 r 2 g 0 c f l 2 b 0 0 r 2 g 0 this will end the proof because in view of the comparaison 5 of the rescaled metric gk with the flat metric g 0 for sufficiently large k we have the inclusions bk p r 6 b 0 0 r 5 and b 0 0 r 2 bk p r and there exists a constant c 0 independent on k and p such that over b 0 0 r 2 1 ck n 2 k n n and 1 ck 1 2 g 0 gk 1 ck 1 2 g 0 on the one hand hw 68 lemma 4 4 gives f c 0 b 0 0 r 4 c d f c 0 b 0 0 r 2 c f l 2 b 0 0 r 2 g 0 15 on the other hand we have the following standard bound cf ce 12 lemma 8 37 for instance f c 1 b 0 0 r 5 g 0 c d f c 1 b 0 0 r 4 g 0 c f c 0 b 0 0 r 4 in the two above estimates the constants depend only on r and n therefore we obtain the desired bound by lemma 21 we obtain the following estimate for every 0 for k k 1 sufficiently large tk c 1 gk c s 0 k c 1 gk k 1 2 s 0 k l 2 gk ck n r 1 2 2 on the other hand by bertini theorem for sufficiently large k there exists a holomorphic section sk x l k vanishing transversally with sk s 0 k tk c 1 gk 2 therefore the sections sk satisfy the conclusions of proposition 18 this ends the proof of theorem 2 let us finish with a complex geometric variant of theorem 2 theorem 22 let x be a closed complex manifold a a ka hler class and q a closed submanifold suppose that q is a bohr sommerfeld lagrangian submanifold for some ka hler form in a then there exists a holomorphic line budle l x with first chern class a and for every sufficiently large k there exist a hermitian met ric hk on l k with positive chern curvature and a holomorphic section sk x l k vanishing transversally such that the function log sk hk x s 1 k 0 r has a morse bott minimum at q and is morse elsewhere proof of theorem 22 we fix a ka hler form a with q 0 as well as a hermitian holomorphic line bundle l x with chern curvature 2 i whose restriction to q is a trivial flat bundle by lemma 6 we fix 0 and repeat the construction of section 3 to obtain sections sk 0 sk x l k with the properties stated in lemma 17 and proposition 18 we keep the notation f 0 log s 0 k and f 1 log sk to construct the desired hermitian metric on lk we will proceed as in the final step of the proof of theorem 2 but we will modify the initial hermitian metric hk of lk instead of the function f 1 take a cutoff function k x 0 1 with support in bk q with k 1 on bk q 2 and such that d k c 1 gk c for some constant c 0 independent of k we define a new hermitian metric on lk by h k e 2 k f 1 f 0 hk 16 the exhaustion function log sk h k sk 6 0 r equals f 0 on bk q 2 hence has a morse bott local minimum at q furthermore 2 k ddc log sk h k ddc k f 1 f 0 therefore by repeating the estimation 4 for every 0 sufficiently small and for k k 0 sufficiently large 2 k dd c log sk h k c 0 gk 2 this inequality ensures that the function log sk h k is c convex finally there exists a c 2 small function k x y r with compact support away from q such that setting the hermitian metric h k e 2 kh k the function log sk h k log sk h is morse away from q in conclusion the hermitian metric h k and the sections sk x l k have the desired properties references agm 01 d auroux d gayet and j p mohsen
