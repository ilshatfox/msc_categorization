finsler surfaces and show short time existence of solu tions for such flows to this purpose we first study the finslerian ricci deturck flow on finsler surfaces and find a unique short time solution to this flow then we find a solution to the original ricci flow by pulling back the solution of the ricci deturck flow using ap propriate diffeomorphisms at the end we illustrate this argument by some examples keywords surface ricci flow finsler surface ricci deturck parabolic differential equa tion berwald frame ams subject classification 53 c 60 53 c 44 introduction the ricci flow is a geometric evolution equation for the metric tensor on a general riemannian manifold the normalized ricci flow has the property that all its fixed points are einstein metrics in his celebrated paper 10 hamilton showed that in 3 manifolds the positive ricci curvature condition on the initial metric implies that the ricci flow exists for all time and con verges to a riemannian metric of constant curvature this phenomenon has been shown later for other types of curvature conditions in other dimensions by several authors the corresponding author bidabad aut ac ir 1 http arxiv org abs 1807 04142 v 1 the study of ricci flow on surfaces is far simpler than its counterparts in higher dimensional cases hence one can obtain much more detailed and comprehensive results on surfaces the ricci flow solutions remain within a conformal class and clearly coincide with that of the yamabe flow on surfaces in 11 hamilton proved that for a compact oriented riemannian surface m g if m is not diffeomorphic to the 2 sphere s 2 then any metric g converges to a constant curvature metric under the ricci flow and if m is diffeomorphic to s 2 then any metric g with positive gaussian curvature on s 2 converges to a metric of constant curvature under the flow later chow in 8 removed the positive gaussian curvature assumption in hamilton s theorem and proved that for evolution of any metric on s 2 under hamilton s ricci flow the gaussian curvature becomes positive in finite time and concluded that under the flow any metric g on a riemannian surface converges to a metric of constant curvature thus for compact surfaces ricci flow provides a new proof of the uniformization theorem much is also known in the complete case there are also many interesting subtleties in setting up this flow in the incomplete cases moreover surface ricci flow has started making impacts on practice fields and tackling fundamental engineering problems in finsler geometry as a natural generalization of riemannian geometry the problem of constructing the finslerian ricci flow raises a number of new conceptual and fundamental issues in regards to the compatibility of geometrical and physical objects and their optimal configurations a fundamental step in the study of any system of evolutionary partial differential equations is to show the short time existence and uniqueness of solutions recently an evolution of a family of finsler metrics along finsler ricci flow has been studied by the first named author in several joint works and it has been shown that such flows exist in short time and converge to a limit metric for instance see 5 in the present work we study the ricci flow on the closed finsler surfaces and prove the short time existence and uniqueness of solutions for the ricci flow intuitively since the ricci flow system of equations is only weakly parabolic its short time existence and uniqueness do not follow from the standard theory of parabolic equations following the procedure described 2 by d deturck in riemannian space 9 we have introduced the finslerian ricci deturck flow on finsler surfaces by eq 34 and prove existence and uniqueness of short time solutions more precisely we prove theorem 1 let m be a compact finsler surface given any initial finsler structure f 0 there exists a real number t 0 and a smooth one parameter family of finsler structures f t t 0 t such that f t is a unique solution to the finslerian ricci deturck flow with f 0 f 0 next a solution to the original ricci flow is found by pulling back the solution to the ricci deturck flow via appropriate diffeomorphisms this leads to theorem 2 let m be a compact finsler surface given any initial finsler structure f 0 there exists a real number t 0 and a smooth one parameter family of finsler structures f t t 0 t such that f t is a unique solution to the finslerian ricci flow and f 0 f 0 1 preliminaries and notations 1 1 chern connection a global approach let m be a real smooth surface and denote by tm the tangent bundle of tangent vectors by tm 0 m the fiber bundle of non zero tangent vectors and by tm tm 0 the pullback tangent bundle let f be a finsler structure on tm 0 and g the related finslerian metric a finsler manifold is denoted here by the pair m f any point of tm 0 is denoted by z x y where x z m and y txm let us denote by ttm 0 the tangent bundle of tm 0 and by the canonical linear mapping ttm 0 tm where for all z tm 0 vztm is the set of all vertical vectors at z that is the set of vec tors which are tangent to the fiber through z consider the decomposition ttm 0 htm v tm which permits us to uniquely represent a vector field x x tm 0 as the sum of the horizontal and vertical parts namely x hx v x the corresponding basis is denoted here by xi yi 3 where xi xi n ji yj n j i 1 2 gj yi and gi are the spray coefficients de fined by gi 1 4 gih 2 f 2 yh xj yj f 2 xh we denote the formal christoffel symbols by ijk 1 2 gih jghk kgjh hgjk where k xk the dual bases are denoted by dxi yi where yi dyi n ijdxj let us denote a global repre sentation of the chern connection by x tm 0 tm tm consider the linear mapping ttm 0 tm defined by x x y where x ttm 0 and y yi xi is the canonical section of tm the connection 1 forms of chern connection in these bases are given by ij i jkdx k where ijk 1 2 gih jghk kgjh hgjk and k xk in the sequel all the vector fields on tm

the chern connection are given by x y y x x y 1 z g x y 2 c z x y 2 respectively where c is the cartan tensor with the components cijk gij yk in a local coordinates on tm the chern horizontal and vertical covariant derivatives of an arbitrary 1 2 tensor field s on tm with the components sijk x y on tm are denoted by lsijk lsijk sisk sjl sijs skl ssjk isl lsijk lsijk where l xl and l yl horizontal metric compatibility of the chern connection is given in local coordinates by lgjk 0 see 3 p 45 the local chern hh curvature tensor is given by r ij kl k i jl l ijk ihk hjl ihl hjk 3 see 3 p 52 the reduced hh curvature tensor is a connection free tensor field which is also referred to as the riemann curvature by certain authors in a local coordinates on tm the components of the reduced hh curvature tensor are given by rik 1 f 2 yjr ij kmy m which are entirely expressed in 4 terms of x and y derivatives of spray coefficients gi as follows rik 1 f 2 2 gi xk 2 gi xj yk yj 2 gj 2 gi yj

on tm 0 is given by l v t x y v t x y t v x y t x v y where x x y y and x y tztm 0 see 4 the lie derivative of finsler metric g with respect to the arbitrary vector field v on tm 0 is given by l v g x y v g x y g v x y g x v y by means of the torsion freeness of chern connection defined by 1 lie derivative of the finsler metric g can be rewritten as l v g x y v g x y g v x x v y g x v y y v v g x y g v x y g x v y g x v y g x y v 5 by the almost g compatibility of chern connection defined by 2 we have 2 c v x y v g x y v g x y g v x y g x v y therefore v g x y 2 c v x y g v x y g x v y 6 plugging the equation 6 in 5 we obtain l v g x y 2 c v x y g x v y g x y v 7 5 replacing x and y by the canonical section y yi xi in 7 we obtain l v g y y 2 c v y y g y v y g y y v where y yi xi using c v y y 0 see 3 p 23 and the symmetric property of g y v y one arrives at l v g y y 2 g y y v 8 where v vi xi is a section of tm in the local coordinates 8 can be written as y i y jl v gij 2 y i y j gik jvk using jgik 0 we obtain y i y jl v gij 2 y i y j jvi 9 where vi gikv k 1 3 the berwald frame and a geometrical setup on sm let m f be a finsler surface and sm the quotient of tm 0 under the fol lowing equivalence relation x y x y if and only if y y are positive mul tiples of each other in other words sm is the bundle of all directions or rays and is called the projective sphere bundle the local coordinates x 1 x 2 on m induce the global coordinates y 1 y 2 on each fiber txm through the expansion y yi xi therefore xi yi is a coordinate system on sm where the coordinates yi are regarded as homogeneous coordinates in the projec tive space using the canonical projection p sm m one can pull the tangent bundle tm back to p tm which is a vector bundle with the fiber dimension 2 over the 3 manifold sm the vector bundle p tm has a global section l y i f y xi and a natural riemannian metric which we here denote by g gij x y dx i dxj one can complete l into a positively oriented g orthonormal frame e 1 e 2 for p tm with e 2 l by setting e 1 fy 2 g x 1 fy 1 g x 2 e 2 y 1 f x 1 y 2 f x 2 6 where g det gij and fyi abbreviates the partial derivative f yi in 2 dimensional case e 1 e 2 is a globally defined g orthonormal frame field for p tm called a berwald frame the natural dual of l is the hilbert form defined by fyidx i which is a global section of p t m the coframe corresponding to e 1 e 2 is defined here by 1 2 where 1 g f y 2 dx 1 y 1 dx 2 v 11 dx 1 v 12 dx 2 2 fy 1 dx 1 fy 2 dx 2 v 21 dx 1 v 22 dx 2 10 the sphere bundle sm tm is a 3 dimensional riemannian manifold equipped with the induced sasaki metric 1 1 2 2 3 3 where 3 g f y 2 y 1 f y 1 y 2 f v 11 y 1 f v 12 y 2 f 11 the collection 1 2 3 is a globally defined orthonormal frame for t sm its natural dual frame is given by e 1 e 2 e 3 where e 1 fy 2 g x 1 fy 1 g x 2 u 11 x 1 u 21 x 2 12 e 2 y 1 f x 1 y 2 f x 2 u 12 x 1 u 22 x 2 13 e 3 fy 2 g f y 1 fy 1 g f y 2 fu 11 y 1 fu 21 y 2 14 these three vector fields on sm form a global orthonormal frame for t sm the first two are horizontal while the third one is vertical the objects 1 2 3 and e 1 e 2 e 3 are defined in terms of objects that live on the slit tangent bundle tm 0 but they are invariant under positive rescaling in y therefore they give bonafide objects on the sphere bundle sm see 3 p 92 94 1 4 the integrability condition for finsler metrics here we first recall that all the riemannian metrics on the fibers of the pulled back bundle do not come from a finsler structure hence not ev 7 ery arbitrary symmetric 0 2 tensor gij x y arises from a finsler structure f x y intuitively in order to make sure gij x y are components of a finsler structure the essential integrability criterion is the total symmetry of gij yk on all three indices i j k in fact gij x y arises from a finsler structure f x y if and only if gij yk is totally symmetric in its three in dices see 2 p 56 symmetry of gij yk on all three indices i j k is known in the literature as integrability condition moreover we have to make sure the integrability criterion is satisfied in every step along the ricci flow to this end we consider a general evolution equation given by t g t t g 0 g 0 15 where t t x y is a family of symmetric 0 2 tensors on tm zero homogenous with respect to y the following lemma establishes the integrability condition see also 5 p 749 lemma 1 1 let g t be a solution to the evolution equation 15 there is a family of finsler structures f t on tm such that gij t 1 2 2 f t yi yj 16 proof let m be a compact differential manifold f t a family of smooth 1 parameter finsler structures on tm 0 and g t the hessian matrix of f t which defines a scalar product on tm for every t let g t be a solution to the evolution equation 15 we have g t g 0 t 0 d 0 t 17 we show that the metric g t satisfies the integrability condition or equiv alently there is a finsler structure f t on tm 0 satisfying 16 for this purpose we multiply gij by y i and yj in 17 yiyjgij t y iyjgij 0 t 0 yiyj ij d by means of the initial condition yiyjgij 0 f 2 0 we get yiyjgij t f 2 0 t 0 yiyj ij d 18 8 by positive definiteness assumption of gij we put f y iyjgij 1 2 twice vertical derivatives of 18 yields 1 2 2 f 2 yk yl gkl 0 1 2 t 0 2 yk yl yiyj ij d 19 on the other hand by straightforward calculation we have 1 2 2 yk yl yiyj ij 1 2 2 ij yk yl y i y j ik yl il yk y i kl 20 for all 0 t using 15 we obtain 1 2 2 ij yk yl yiyj 0 ik yl 0 il yk 0 therefore 20 is reduced to 1 2 2 yk yl yiyj ij kl 21 for all 0 t finally replacing 21 in 19 we get 1 2 2 f 2 yk yl gkl 0 i o kl d gkl therefore every gij t on the fibers of pulled back bundle arises from a finsler structure this completes the proof 2 semi linear strictly parabolic equations on sm recall that a quasi linear system is a system of partial differential equations where the derivatives of principal order terms occur only linearly and co efficients may depend on derivatives of the lower order terms it is called semi linear if it is quasi linear and coefficients of the principal order terms depend only on the independent variables but not on the solution see 12 p 9 45 let m be a 2 dimensional manifold and u m r a smooth function on m a semi linear strictly parabolic equation is a pde of the form u t aij x t 2 u xi xj h x t u u xi i j 1 2 where aij and h are smooth functions on m and for some constant 0 we have the parabolic assumption aij i j 2 0 6 m that is all eigenvalues of a aij 2 2 have positive signs or equivalently a is positive definite definition 2 1 let m be a surface and sm r a smooth function on the sphere bundle sm consider the following semi linear strictly parabolic equation on sm t gab x y t e a e b h x y t e a a b 1 2 3 where e a is a local frame for the tangent bundle tsm and stand for partial derivatives on sm here gab and h are smooth functions on sm and g gab is positive definite more precisely a semi linear strictly parabolic equation on sm can be written in the form t pab x y t e ae b q x y t e 3 e 3 m a x y t e ae 3 lower order terms 22 where a b 1 2 and the matrix g p 1 2 m 1 2 m t q 3 3 is positive definite where p pab 2 2 q q 1 1 m m a 2 1 10 lemma 2 1 let m f be a finsler surface and tm r a zero homogeneous smooth function on the tangent bundle tm the semi linear differential equation t gij 2 xi xj f 2 gij 2 yi yj lower order terms i j 1 2 23 is a strictly parabolic equation on sm proof let us denote again by its restriction on sm according to 12 and 13 replacing e a u i a xi we obtain e a u i a xi e be a u i au j b 2 xi xj e b u i a xi a b 1 2 multiplying the both sides by gab leads to gabe be a g abuiau j b 2 xi xj gabe b u i a xi gij 2 xi xj gabe b u i a xi where gab giju i au j b according to 10 by using the notations c vcidx i and bc vci g abe b u i a one can rewrite the expression g ij 2 xi xj on sm with respect to e a as follows gabe be a bce c gij 2 xi xj c 1 2 hence 14 yields e 3 fu i 1 yi e 3 e 3 e 3 fu i 1 yi f 2 u j 1 u i 1 2 yj yi f e 3 u i 1 yi fu j 1 f yj ui 1 yi 11 using the fact u j 1 f yj 0 see 1 p 161 we have e 3 e 3 f 2 u j 1 u i 1 2 yj yi f e 3 u i 1 yi multiplying the both sides by g 11 and taking into account that g 11 ui 1 u j 1 gij yiyj we get g 11 e 3 e 3 f 2 gij 2 yj yi fg 11 e 3 u i 1 yi where g 11 giju i 1 u j 1 according to 11 we have 3 v 1 i yi f denoting d 1 v 1 i fg 11 e 3 u i 1 one can rewrite the expression f 2 gij 2 yj yi on sm with respect to e 3 as follows g 11 e 3 e 3 d 1 e 3 f 2 gij 2 yj yi thus the principal order terms gij 2 xi xj and f 2 gij 2 yi yj convert to gabe be a bce c and g 11 e 3 e 3 d 1 e 3 on sm on the other hand the order of lower order terms in 23 do not change after rewriting them in terms of the basis e 1 e 2 e 3 on sm therefore 23 on sm is written as t gabe be a g 11 e 3 e 3 bce c d 1 e 3 lower order terms 24 where a b c 1 2 using the fact that g is positive definite the coefficient g gab 0 0 g 11 3 3 of principal order terms of 24 is positive definite on sm therefore by virtue of 22 the differential equation 24 is a semi linear strictly parabolic equation on sm 3 a vector field on sm let m f and n f be two finsler surfaces with the corresponding metric tensors g and h respectively let xi yi and x i y i be local coordinate 12 systems on tm and tn respectively let c be a geodesic on m the natural lift of c on tm namely c t i c t xi t dx i dt t tm is a horizontal curve that is its tangent vector field c t dx i dt xi is hori zontal consider a diffeomorphism tm tn xi yi 7 xi yi xi yi j xi yi 2 j xi yi such that c t c t is a horizontal curve where i j 1 2 and 1 4 throughout this section takes horizontal curves to horizontal curves let us denote by ijk and i jk the coefficients of horizontal covariant derivatives of chern connection on m f and n f respectively then we have c c c dx j dt x j d 2 x j dt 2 x j dx j dt c x j d 2 x j dt 2 dx j dt dx k dt ijk x i 25 on the other hand dx i dt i xp dxp dt d 2 x i dt 2 2 i xp xq dxp dt dxq dt i xp d 2 xp dt 2 replacing the last equations in 25 leads to c c 2 i xp xq dxp dt dxq dt i xh d 2 xh dt 2 ijk j xp k xq dxp dt dxq dt x i 26 where all the indices

xq x i 13 next let aipq 2 i xp xq i xh hpq i jk j xp k xq f 2 2 i yp yq contracting aipq with g pq leads to the following operators g h i gpq 2 i xp xq f 2 2 i yp yq i xh hpq i jk j xp k xq 28 where g h i gpqaipq and i 1 2 for greater indices we consider the following operator g h 2 i gpq 2 2 i xp xq f 2 2 2 i yp yq 2 i yk nkq xp 29 where i 1 2 summarizing the above definitions we have g h g h i i g h 2 i 2 i where i 1 2 next we show the operator g h is invariant under all diffeomorphisms on tm lemma 3 1 let m f and n f be two finsler surfaces with the corre sponding metric tensors g and h respectively if is a diffeomorphism from tm to itself then it leaves invariant the operator g h that is g h x y g h x y 1 4 where x i xi and y i yi proof let xi yi and x i y i be the two local coordinate systems on tm 14 and tn respectively and x i xi and y i yi for i we have g h i x y gpq x y 2 i xp xq x y f 2 x y 2 i yp yq x y i xk x y kpq x y i jk x y j xp x y k xq x y gpq x y 2 i xp xq

can show that g h 2 i x y g h 2 i x y where i 1 2 this completes the proof remark 3 1 let m f and n f be two finsler surfaces with the cor responding metric tensors g and h respectively let tm tn xi yi xi yi 1 4 be a diffeomorphism and takes hori zontal curves to horizontal curves given 0 tm tn we consider the following evolution equation t g h 0 0 30 by restricting s to sm and using lemma 2 1 one can see that 30 is a strictly parabolic system hence there is a unique solution for 30 in short time 15 corollary 3 1 let m f and n f be two finsler surfaces with corre sponding metric tensors g and h respectively let n m and be the identity map id tm tm xi yi xi yi then we have g hid g hid i g pq ipq ipq i where i 1 2 and ipq i pq are the coefficients of horizontal covariant deriva tives of chern connection with respect to the metrics g and h respectively let be a vector field on tm with the components g hid i xi g pq ipq ipq xi 31 using the fact that the difference of two connections is a tensor is a globally well defined vector field it can be easily verified that the components of are homogeneous of degree zero on y thus can be considered as a vector field on sm 4 ricci deturck flow and its existence and uniqueness of solution there are several well known definitions for ricci tensor in finsler geometry for instance h akbar zadeh has considered two ricci tensors on finsler manifolds in his works namely one is defined by ricij 1 2 f 2 ric yiyj where ric is the ricci scalar defined by ric gikrik rii and rik are defined by 4 see 3 p 192 another ricci tensor is defined by rcij 1 2 rij rji where rij is the trace of hh curvature defined by rij r l i lj the difference between these two ricci tensors is the additional term 1 2 yk rjk yi appeared in the first definition more precisely we have ricij rcij 12 y k rjk yi d bao based on the first definition of ricci tensor has considered the following ricci flow in finsler geometry t gjk t 2 ricjk g t 0 g 0 32 16 where gjk t is a family of finslerian metrics defined on tm 0 t contracting 32 with yjyk via euler s theorem leads to t f 2 2 f 2 ric that is t logf t ric f t 0 f 0 33 where f 0 is the initial finsler structure see 2 here and everywhere in the present work we consider the first akbar zadeh s definition of ricci tensor and the related ricci flow 33 one of the advantages of the ricci quantity ricij used in the present work is its independence on the choice of cartan berwald or chern connections definition 4 1 let m be a compact surface with a fixed background finsler structure f and related finsler metric h assume that for all t 0 t f t is a one parameter family of finsler structures on tm and g t is the tensor metric related to f t we say that f t is a solution to the finslerian ricci deturck flow if t f 2 t 2 f 2 t ric g t l f 2 t 34 where l is the lie derivative with respect to the vector field g t hid i xi on sm as mentioned earlier the following theorem shows that the ricci deturck flow 34 is well de fined and has a unique solution on a short time interval proof of theorem 1 let m be a compact surface with a fixed back ground finsler structure f and the related finsler metric h here all the indices run over the range 1 2 the ricci deturck flow 34 can be written in the following form y p y q t g pq t 2 f 2 t ric g t l ypyqg pq t 35 where g t is the metric tensor related to f t also we have l ypyqg pq ypyql g pq 2 ypg pql yq 17 therefore 35 becomes ypyq t g pq t 2 f 2 t ric g t ypyql g pq 2 ypg pql yq 36 by means of the lie derivative formula 9 along we have y p y ql g pq 2 ypyq p q 37 where p is the horizontal covariant derivative in chern connection using its h metric compatibility p q becomes p q pg ql l g ql p l as mentioned earlier if we denote the coefficients of horizontal covariant derivatives of chern connection with respect to the metric tensors h and g by h and g respectively then by definition 31 of we have p q g ql p l g lpw w g ql p g

to get a strictly parabolic system by virtue of 42 we add the zero term f 2 ypyqg mn 2 g pq yn ym 0 to the right hand side of 41 therefore we have ypyq t g pq t g mn n mg pq f 2 g mn 2 g pq yn ym 43

pq yk yl convecting the last equation with ypyq and using 42 we have ypyq n mg pq y pyq 2 g pq xn xm remark that in the term ypyqg mn n mg pq in 41 there is no term containing derivatives of g except ypyq 2 g pq xn xm one can rewrite 43 as follows ypyq t g pq t g mn n mg pq f 2 g mn 2 g pq yn ym lower order terms 0 44 recall that m is a 2 dimensional finsler surface and hence is isotropic thus r nq np can be part of a symmetric quadratic form namely it is symmetric with respect to the indices p and q see 1 p 152 therefore by means of symmetry of l ypyqg pq with respect to the indices p and q we conclude that 20 44 is symmetric with respect to the indices p and q if a symmetric bilinear form vanishes on the diagonal then by the polarization identity it vanishes identically therefore from 44 we have t g pq t g mn n mg pq f 2 g mn 2 g pq yn ym lower order terms 0 45 by restricting the metric tensor g on p tm and using lemma 2 1 we can rewrite 45 in terms of the basis e 1 e 2 e 3 on sm as follows t g pq g abe be ag pq g 11 e 3 e 3 g pq bce cg pq d 1 e 3 g pq lower order terms 46 where bc vci g abe b u i a and d 1 v 1 i f g 11 e 3 u i 1 as mentioned in lemma 2 1 and all the indices in 46 run over the range 1 2 by assumption m is compact and the sphere bundle sm as well also the metric tensor g mn remains positive definite along the ricci flow see 5 corollary 3 7 since the coefficients of principal second order terms of 46 are positive definite by definition 2 1 it is a semi linear strictly parabolic system on sm therefore the standard existence and uniqueness theorem for parabolic systems on compact domains implies that 46 has a unique solution on sm equation 46 is a special case of the general flow 15 and g t is a solution to it therefore by means of lemma 1 1 g t satisfies the integrability condition or equivalently there exists a finsler structure f t on tm such that g ij 1 2 2 f yi yj hence g is a finsler metric and determines a finsler structure f 2 g pqy pyp which is a unique solution to the finsler ricci deturck flow this completes the proof of theorem 1 5 short time solution to the ricci flow on finsler surfaces in this section we will show that there is a one to one correspondence be tween the solutions to ricci flow and ricci deturck flow on finsler surfaces here we recall some results which will be used in the sequel 21 lemma a 7 p 82 let xt 0 t t be a continuous time dependent family of vector fields on a compact manifoldm then there exists a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms t m m 0 t t defined on the same time interval such that t t x xt t x 0 x x for all x m and t 0 t remark 5 1 let m be a compact finsler surface according to lemma a there exists a unique one parameter family of diffeomorphisms t on sm such that t t z t z t 0 idsm where z x y sm and t 0 t remark 5 2 let g pq be a solution to the ricci deturck flow and t the one parameter global group of diffeomorphisms according to the vector field since is a vector field on sm then t are homogeneous of degree zero zero homogeneity of g pq implies that t g pq be also homogeneous of degree zero in fact t g pq x y g pq t x y g pq t x y t g pq x y using the fact that g pq is positive definite and t are diffeomorphisms t g pq is also positive definite as well t g pq is symmetric more intuitively t g x y g t x t y g t y t x t g y x therefore t g pq determines a finsler structure as follows f 2 gpqy p y q where gpq t g pq and ty p y p lemma 5 1 let t be a global one parameter group of diffeomorphisms corresponding to the vector field and ijk g and g i g are the christoffel 22 symbols and spray coefficients related to the finsler metric g respectively then we have t i jk g i jk t g 47 t g i g g i t g 48 where ijk g g is 1 2 g sj xk g jk xs g ks xj and gig

expressed entirely in terms of the x and y derivatives of the spray coefficients gig rik g 1 f 2 2 gig xk 2 gig xj yk yj 2 g j g 2 gig yj yk gig yj g j g yk 23 therefore we have t r i k g t 1 f 2 2

proposition 5 1 fix a compact finsler surface m f with related finsler metric tensor h let f t be a family of solutions to the ricci deturck flow t f 2 t 2 f 2 t ric g t l f 2 t 49 where g t hid i xi and t 0 t moreover let t be a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms satisfying t t z t z t for z sm and t 0 t then the finsler structures f t form a solution to the finslerian ricci flow 33 where f

2 t l s 1 t t s s 0 t f 2 t on the other hand we have s 1 t t s s 0 1 t s s t s 0 1 t hence 51 is written t t f 2 t t t f 2 t l 1 t t f 2 t replacing the last relation in 50 and using the assumption 49 we get t logf t 1 2 t t f 2 t l 1 t t f 2 t t f 2 t 1 2 t 2 f 2 t ric f t l f 2 t l 1 t t f 2 t t f 2 t 1 2 t 2 f 2 t ric f t t l f 2 t l 1 t t f 2 t t f 2 t 1 2 2 t f 2 t t ric f t t f 2 t 25 by virtue of lemma 5 2 we have t logf t t ric f t ric t f t ricf t therefore the finsler structures f t form a solution to the finslerian ricci flow hence the proof is complete in the next step we assume that there is a solution to the finslerian ricci flow based on which we construct a solution to the ricci deturck flow in finsler space proposition 5 2 fix a compact finsler surface m f with the related finsler metric tensor h let f t t 0 t be a family of solutions to the ricci flow and t a one parameter family of diffeomorphisms on sm evolving under the following flow t t g t h t then the finsler structures f t defined by f 2 t t f 2 t form a solution to the following ricci deturck flow t f 2 t 2 f 2 t ric g t l f 2 t where g t hid i xi and g t is the metric tensor related to f t fur thermore for all z sm and t 0 t we have t t z t z t proof using lemma 3 1 we have t t g t h t t g t h t t g t hid t t g t h t id g t hid 26 for all z sm and t 0 t using f 2 t t f 2 t leads to t logf t 1 2 t t f 2 t t f 2 t 1 2 t t f 2 t l 1 t t f 2 t t f 2 t 1 2 t t f 2 t l f 2 t t f 2 t 52 by assumption f t form a solution to the finslerian ricci flow 33 0 t logf t ricf t 53 thus by means of 52 53 and lemma 5 2 we have 0 t t f 2 t l f 2 t t f 2 t 2 ricf t t t f 2 t l f 2 t t f 2 t 2 ric t f t t t f 2 t l f 2 t t f 2 t 2 t ricf t t t f 2 t l f 2 t 2 t f 2 t t ricf t t f 2 t t t f 2 t l f 2 t 2 f 2 t ricf t t f 2 t therefore t t f 2 t l f 2 t 2 f 2 t ricf t 0 this implies t f 2 t 2 f 2 t ricf t l f 2 t therefore f t is a solution to the ricci deturck flow as we have claimed proof of theorem 2 in order to check the existence statement recall that by means of theorem 1 there exists a solution f t to the finslerian 27 ricci deturck flow 34 which is defined on some time interval 0 t and satisfies f 0 f 0 let t be the solution of the ode t t z g t hid t z t t z t with the initial condition 0 z z for z sm and t 0 t by propo sition 5 1 the finsler structures f 2 t t f 2 t form a solution to the finslerian ricci flow 33 with f 0 f 0 this completes the existence statement for uniqueness statement assume that f 1 t and f 2 t are both solutions to the finslerian ricci flow defined on some time interval 0 t and satisfy f 1 0 f 2 0 we claim f 1 t f 2 t for all t 0 t in order to prove this fact we argue by contradiction suppose that f 1 t 6 f 2 t for some t 0 t let s consider a real number 0 t where inf t 0 t f 1 t 6 f 2 t clearly f 1 f 2 let 1 t be a solution of the flow t 1 t g 1 t h 1 t with initial condition 1 id and 2 t a solution of the flow t 2 t g 2 t h 2 t with initial condition 2 id it follows from the standard theory of parabolic differential equations that 1 t and 2 t are defined on some time interval where is a positive real number moreover if we choose 0 small enough then 1 t and 2 t are diffeomorphisms for all t for each t we define two finsler structures f 1 t and f 2 t by f 1 t 2 1 t f 1 t 2 and f 2 t 2 2 t f 2 t 2 it follows from propo sition 5 2 that f 1 t and f 2 t are solutions of the finslerian ricci deturck flow since f 1 f 2 the uniqueness statement in theorem 1 implies that f 1 t f 2 t for all t for each t we define a vector field on sm by g 1 t hid g 2 t hid by proposition 5 2 we have t 1 t z 1 t z t 28 and t 2 t z 2 t z t for z sm and t since 1 2 id it follows that 1 t 2 t for all t putting these facts together we conclude that f 1 t 2 1 t f 1 t 2 2 t f 2 t 2 f 2 t 2 for all t therefore f 1 t f 2 t for all t this con tradicts the definition of thus the uniqueness holds well this completes the proof of theorem 2 example 5 1 let m f 0 be a compact finsler surface we are going to obtain a solution to the ricci flow 33 it s well known in dimension two a finsler metric is of isotropic ricci scalar or einstein if and only if it is of isotropic flag curvature therefore f 0 is an einstein metric and we have ricf 0 k where k k x is a scalar function on m consider a family of scalars t defined by t 1 2 kt 0 define a smooth one parameter family of finsler structures on m by f 2 t t f 20 thus we have log f t 1 2 log t f 20 derivative with respect to t yields t log f t k t ricf 0 t 54 on the other hand by straight forward computations we have 1 t ricf 0 ric t 1 2 f 0 for more details see 6 p 926 replacing the last relation in 54 leads to t log f t ric t 1 2 f 0 ricf t hence f t is a solution to the ricci flow equation 33 29 example 5 2 let f t be a family of finsler structures on the sphere s 2 defined by f 2 t aij t y iyj where aij t is a well known riemannian metric on ir 2 called the rosenau metric aij t 8 sinh t 1 2 cosh t x 2 x 4 ij t 0 x ir 2 it is well known that aij extends to a metric on s 2 the related finsler metric tensor of f t is gij t 1 2 f 2 yiyj aij t by straight forward computations r a t the scalar curvature of the rie mannian metric aij t is r a t cosh t sinh t 2 sinh t x 2 1 2 cosh t x 2 x 4 the ricci tensor of gij and aij coincides hence ricij g t ricij a t 1 2 r a t aij t from f t aij t y iyj 1 2 we have log f t 1 2 log aij t y iyj derivative with respect to t leads to t logf t 1 2 t aij t l i l j 55 where t aij t 8 cosh t 1 2 cosh t x 2 x 4 16 sinh 2 t x 2 1 2 cosh t x 2 x

t logf t ric g t consequently f t form a solution to the finsler ricci flow 33 on s 2 acknowledgment the authors would like to thank prof david bao for his valuable comments this work is partially
