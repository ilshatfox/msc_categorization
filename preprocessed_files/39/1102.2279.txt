for many decades one focus of research is the effects of herbivores on plant dynamics 3 in contrast there is strong ecological evidence indicating that the population dynamics of plants has an important effect on the plant herbivore interactions in this article we investigate how plants with different population dynamics contribute to the interactions models for plant growth vary strongly 4 table 1 lists eight discrete time models of plant population growth the first seven models are introduced in the paper by law and watkinson 32 without inter specific competition all models are seasonal discrete models of the form pt 1 ptf pt where pt is the density of a plant in season t and f the per capita growth rate in the absence of intra specific competition the latter is given by f 0

equilibrium density of the plant is given by k the parameter c is the space per plant at which interference with neighbors becomes appreciable 32 the interpretation of the power parameter b depends on the model generally these models fall into two classes depending on whether pf p is a monotone function of p or not models 1 3 are unimodal i e they have a single hump they lead to complicated dynamics including period doubling period windows and chaos 8 models 4 8 are monotone leading to much simpler dynamics model 8 has a growth function of holling type iii 22 table 1 growth models of

interaction model with ricker dynamics as the growth function of plant or host in kon 19 in this article we investigate the impact of general monotone plant growth models on the dynamics of plant herbivore interaction our study is different from others and our results are new we show that all monotone plant growth models generate a unique interior equilibrium theorem 4 3 and they are uniformly persistent see related definitions in 27 for certain range of parameters values theorem 4 5 if the attacking rate of herbivore is too small or the quantity of plant is not enough then herbivore goes extinct theorem 4 2 in addition our numerical simulations suggest that these models lead to noise sensitive bursting which can be identified as a dynamical mechanism for almost periodic outbreaks of the herbivore infestation the rest of paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define two classes of monotone dynamics of single plant species in section 3 we formulate general plant herbivore models for the plant dynamics introduced in section 2 in section 4 we analyze the dynamic behavior of these two general models e g the global stability of the boundary equilibrium and uniform persistence of these models in section 5 we apply the theoretical results from section 4 to a beverton holt model and a holling type iii model the analysis and numerical simulations suggest that beverton holt model goes through neimark sacker bifurcation with unique periodic orbit for a certain set of parameters values while holling type iii model goes through heteroclinic bifurcation for a certain set of parameters values our study also shows that noise is an important factor for outbreak of herbivore finally we compare monotone plant growth models to unimodal and multimodal plant growth models regarding their influence of plant herbivore dynamics 2 monotone growth dynamics for a single plant species consider pt 1 ptf r pt f r pt t 0 2 1 where pt is the density of biomass in plant at generation t f r pt is the growth function of biomass density and f r pt is the per capita growth rate of the biomass density without intra specific competition we have f r 0 r i e r is the maxi mal per capita growth rate of the plant this simple formulation 2 1 can give rise to a great diversity of dynamical behavior depending on the expression used for the growth function f r and the values given to the parameters of that function several different functions have been considered see 5 for a partial list of models with per capita growth rates that decline with increasing population density f r p p 0 p 0 2 2 in biological terms this means that the per capita growth rate f r p decreases due to negative density dependent mechanism such as intra specific competition between october

well known prototypes of the model 2 1 under this biological assumption are the beverton holt and ricker models the dynamics of ricker model has been extensively studied e g 23 15 19 here we focus on the beverton holt prototype i e the dynamics of the plant is monotonically increasing f p df p dp 0 p 0 2 3 we can characterize the growth models of a single plant with assumption h 1 or h 2 or both h 1 and h 2 h 1 f 0 0 f p p 0 0 f p 0 and limp f p c 0 h 2 f p p 0 0 f p 0 and limp f p 0 in the biological sense h 1 implies that the population density in one year is a in creasing function f p of the density in the previous year and its per capita growth function f p may be increasing or decreasing or both which implies that plant suffers from the extremes of contest intraspecific competitive interaction henson and cushing 10 h 2 implies that the per capita growth function of the plant is a decreasing function due to intra specific competition and the population density of a plant can be an increasing or decreasing function or both with respect to its density which implies that plant suffers from the extremes of scramble intraspecific competitive interactions henson and cushing 10 in this article we study the population dynamics associated with plants that satisfy h 1 or h 2 or both h 1 and h 2 the specific assumptions will be addressed in the models the following proposition summarizes the dynamics of plant in the absence of herbivore proposition 2 1 1 assume that h 1 holds and there are n 1 consecutive distinct and non degenerate solutions p i i 0 1 n of p f p with the following property 0 p 0 p 1 p n if p 0 is stable unstable then the even p i are stable unstable while the odd p i are unstable stable in particular p n is always stable moreover define the map pt 1 f pt then for any 0 there exists n large enough such that for all t n we have pt 1 f pt p n 2 assume that h 2 holds then p pf p has at most two roots i e p 0 and the possible root of 1 f p proof possible configurations of the staircase diagrams of fig 1 shows the al ternating stable and unstable equilibria if h 1 holds then we have 0 lim p f p c 1 and 0 f p n 1 october 25 2018 16 0 wspc instruction file monotonefinal noise and seasonal effects on the dynamics of plant herbivore models with monotonic plant growth functions 5 this implies that the largest equilibrium p n is locally stable fig 1 possible configurations of the staircase diagrams if an initial condition p 0 satisfies p 0 p n then h 1 implies that p 1 f p 0 f p n p n and by induction pt p n for all t 1 in the case that the initial condition is larger than p n i e p 0 p n then h 1 and the fact that p n is the largest positive root of p f p indicate that f p p for all p p n thus we have follows p n f p n p 1 f p 0 p 0 therefore by induction we know that the sequence pt t 0 is decreasing and con verges to p n as t this indicates that for any 0 there exists n large enough such that for all t n we have pt 1 f pt p n in other cases we have pt 1 f pt p n for all t 0 since f p is a differentiable and strictly decreasing function of p thus 1 f p has at most one solution therefore the statement holds 3 plant herbivore models insect and plant survival rates often appear to be non linear functions of plant and insect density respectively 9 3 in our discrete time models we therefore assume that the plant population growth is a non linear function of herbivore and plant density and that plant population growth decreases gradually with increasing herbivore density similarly we assume that the density of herbivore population depends on both the plant and herbivore s density rather than only the herbivore density 3 a final key feature of many plant herbivore interactions is that in the october 25 2018 16 0 wspc instruction file monotonefinal 6 yun kang and dieter armbruster absence of the herbivore we have a monotone growth dynamics as discussed in the previous section let pt represent the density of edible plant biomass in generation t and ht represent the population density of herbivore the effect of the herbivore on the plant population growth rate is described by the function g a ht with g a 0 1 here the parameter a measures the damage caused by herbivore e g feeding rate we assume that the herbivore population density is proportional to a function of plant density h pt and a non linear function of herbivore density l ht therefore the structure of our models is pt 1 ptf pt g a ht 3 1 ht 1 h pt l ht 3 2 many consumer resource models assume a non linear relationship between resource population size and attack rate 1 29 for plants and insect herbivores we similarly expect a non linear functional relationship due to herbivore foraging time and satiation the relationship is expressed in terms of plant biomass units rather than population size because herbivores are unlikely to kill entire plants 9 3 our model has the following features without the herbivore we assume a mono tone growth rate i e h 1 holds the growth function f pt determines the amount of new leaves available for consumption for the herbivore in generation t we assume that the herbivores search for plants randomly the area consumed is measured by the parameter a i e a is a constant that correlates to the total amount of the biomass that an herbivore consumes the herbivore has a one year life cycle the larger a the faster the feeding rate after attacks by herbivores the biomass in the plant population is reduced to pt 1 ptf pt e aht 3 3 where g a ht in 3 1 is defined as g a ht e aht 3 4 the term h pt in 3 2 describes how the biomass in the plants is converted to the biomass of the herbivore it differs depending on the relative timing of herbivore feeding and growth if the herbivore attacks the plant before the plant grows then we have h pt pt otherwise h pt ptf pt since the biomass of herbivore comes from whatever they eat h pt is the available biomass of a plant that can be converted into the herbivore s biomass the term l ht describes the fraction of h pt that can be used by the herbivore i e l ht 1 e aht therefore the evolution of the plant herbivore system is either

and their stability if in the absence of the herbivore there exist n 1 equilibria of the plant dynamics then both model i and ii have n 1 boundary equilibria of the form e 00 0 0 and ei 0 p i 0 i 1 2 n their local stability can be determined by the eigenvalues of their jacobian matrices it is easy to check that the jacobian matrices of model i and ii are identical at these boundary equilibria the eigenvalues of their associated jacobian matrix at 0 0 are f 0 and 0 the eigenvalues of their associated jacobian matrix at p i 0 are f p i and ap i the following theorems summarize the global

such that for all t n we have pt 1 f pt e aht f pt p n 4 1 since ap n 1 then for small enough we have apt a p n 1 and af pt a p n 1 for all t n thus for model i ht 1 pt 1 e aht htpt 1 e aht ht ahtpt a

and ii are globally attracted to the boundary dynamics theorem 4 2 indicates that herbivore can not maintain its population if its at tracting rate is too small or there is no enough food i e ap n 1 in addition the special case of theorem 4 2 when n 1 leads to the following remarks remark assume that the hypotheses of theorem 4 2 hold if n 1 then from proposition 2 1 we have 1 if f 0 1 then p 1 is a source 2 if f 0 1 then p 1 is a sink hence if f 0 1 and n 1 then p 1 0 attracts all nontrivial solutions 4 2 unique interior equilibrium interior equilibria are determined by the intersections of

dissipative this combined with the fact that the semiflow generated by these systems is asymptotically smooth this is automatic since the state space is in r 2 gives the existence of the compact attractors of points for both systems smith and thieme 2010 27 notice that the omega limit set of s 1 p h r 2 p 0 is the trivial boundary equilibrium e 00 let l p h p be an average lyapunov function

values of the parameters r and a as the values of r or a increase the inte rior equilibrium goes through a neimark sacker bifurcation generating an invariant cycle since model i and model ii have similar dynamics we only focus on model ii and discuss the beverton holt model 5 1 and the holling type iii model 5 2 respec tively the main difference between the beverton holt model and the holling type iii model is that the holling type iii model can show a heteroclinic bifurcation where a periodic orbit grows until it becomes a heteroclinic connection between boundary equilibria whereas the beverton holt model does not show such a bifur cation figure 2 shows the heteroclinic bifurcation schematically when a 0 71 and r 2 5 the system has a stable interior equilibrium the dark dot that is in the middle of the figure which is generated by the matlab when we increase r to 3 5 and keep a 0 71 the system has an invariant orbit the grey orbit in the figure which is generated by the matlab however if we continue to increase the values of a or r the invariant orbit disappears and the system converges to the boundary equilibrium 0 0 this suggests that a heteroclinic bifurcation occurs the dark line with arrows in the figure which is generated schematically since the beverton holt model only has the origin as a saddle and one other boundary equilibrium and since the stable manifold of the origin is the h axis which is an invariant manifold the periodic orbit in the interior cannot become heteroclinic however it can become very large and pass the origin arbitrarily close to the coordinate axes as shown in fig 3 figure 3 is the numerical simulations generated by the matlab for 2000 generations when a 2 and r 2 5 2 7 2 8 3 when a 2 and r 2 5 the system has a stable interior equilibrium as shown in the figure small dark dot when r 2 7 2 8 3 the system has an invariant orbit numerical simulations of this case hint at an interesting phenomenon a stan dard numerical simulation shows the periodic orbit disappearing and the trajectory approaching the nontrivial boundary equilibrium as time increases however that boundary equilibrium is a saddle and the trajectory should leave into the interior but it does not do so over any simulation time that we checked the resolution of the puzzle comes from the considerations of the accuracy of the simulations as the limit cycle gets closer to the origin the herbivore values become so small that they are approximated as zero hence the dynamics is reduced to the dynamics of the plant which has a stable equilibrium on the invariant manifold determined by h 0 and hence the trajectory never leaves figure 4 a shows a bifurcation diagram for the beverton holt model which describes the neimark sacker bifurcation curve

discussed in the outbreaks of herbivore infestations once the periodic orbit disappears due to accuracy issues we can make it re appear by adding small amount of noise to the simulation 1 noise we use

model there will be a threshold at which the population of the herbivore cannot be detected in nature we define the resident time as the time interval for which the population of the herbivore stays below some threshold e g 0 01 and the resident time ratio as the ratio of the residence time to the period of the bursting table 5 3 shows the period as a function of the mean square amplitude of the noise level figure 6 shows the resident time ratio as a function of the noise amplitudes the figure is generated by calculating the resident time ratio for each noise amplitude for 50 trajectory with 1000 generations the figure shows that over many orders of magnitude the residence ratio stays around 80 indicating that the herbivore is dormant for most of the time and only appears for about 20 of its periodic cycle the table indicates that by choosing a particular noise level we can control the apparent periodicity of the bursts amplitude of noise w 0 01 0 001 0 0001 0 00001 0 000001 0 0000001

periodic or strongly chaotic variation of the plant density from generation to generation hence it is important to determine the influence of models of monotone growth dynamics on the plant herbivore inter action model we proved three key features of such interactions that are important for model building all monotone growth models generate a unique interior equilibrium monotone growth models with just one sustainable equilibrium for the plant population e g the beverton holt model lead to noise sensitive bursting this certainly happens for many plant herbivore systems and the dynamical mech anism discussed here has not been noticed before in plant herbivore systems however see 24 model i and ii have a uniformly persistent property if they satisfy both h 1 and h 3 in particular the beverton holt model is uniformly persistent and the holling type iii model is not the beverton holt model does not have more complicated dynamics than a periodic orbit in the interior of the phase space although we cannot prove this we conjecture that this is true for all models that satisfy the assumptions of h 1 and h 2 i e have just one equilibrium for the pure plant dynamics without any claim to a complete analysis of all types of models we note a few addi tional features associated with monotone and non monotone plant growth models october 25 2018 16 0 wspc instruction file

nicholson bailey model it is shown that for a large set of parameters the sys tem exhibits bistability between complicated possibly chaotic dynamics in the interior of the phase space and equally complicated dynamics on the boundary fig 7 a kon 19 discusses a similar bistability phenomenon for model i since unimodal maps are all topologically equivalent 8 we expect bistability to be a defining feature for plant herbivore models with unimodal plant growth models in contrast models that satisfy the assumptions of h 1 and h 3 e g the beverton holt model cannot show bistability since the global attractor either is a fixed point on the boundary or some set in the interior of the phase space however it is conceivable that models that do not satisfy h 3 e g holling type iii models show bistability between an interior attractor and a boundary equilibrium that is not the largest equilibrium for the pure plant population 2 crises of interior attractors all models seem to show some sort of global attraction to the boundary dynamics i e extinction of the parasite for large growth rates r unimodal models show a crisis type of bifurcation whereas the chaotic dy namics in the interior collapses and the system becomes globally attracted to the boundary dynamics 15 for instance the interior strange attractor in fig 7 that exists for a growth parameter of r 3 8 will grow and hit the stable manifold of the boundary attractor for r 3 85 fig 7 the interior strange attractor and the stable manifold of the boundary attractor a 0 95 r 3 8 holling type iii models show a heteroclinic

global attraction to a boundary fixed point conjecture the beverton holt model does not lead to complete extinction according to theorem 4 5 however in theorem 4 5 may happen to be small which taking a stochastic effect into account might lead to extinction of herbivores acknowledgments the research of d a is supported by nsf grant dms 0604986 the authors would like to thank the anonymous referees
