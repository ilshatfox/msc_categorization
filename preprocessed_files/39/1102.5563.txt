density dependent factors the per capita growth rate of a species may be non monotonic one important consequence is that species may suffer from weak allee effects or strong allee effects in this paper we study the permanence of a discrete time two species interaction model with non monotonic per capita growth rates for the first time by using the average lyapunov functions and extending the ecological concept of the relative nonlinearity we find a simple sufficient condition for guaranteeing the permanence of systems that can model complicated two species interactions the extended relative nonlinearity allows us to fully characterize the effects of nonlinearities in the per capita growth functions with non monotonicity these results are illustrated with specific two species competition and predator prey models of generic forms with non monotone per capita growth rates keywords permanence non monotonic per capita growth rates allee effects relative nonlinearity two species interaction population models 1 introduction this paper is concerned with the permanence of a discrete time two species interaction model with non monotonic per capita growth rates that can be described by the following equations xt 1 xtf xt yt 1 yt 1 ytg xt yt 2 where xt and yt denote population densities of species x and y in season t respectively f x y and g x y are per capita growth rates of these two species which are nonnegative and twice differentiable in r 2 in addition at least one of f x f y g x g y change signs in r 2 i e the per capita growth rates are non monotonic the coexistence of different species in ecological communities has been a main research theme in ecology for deterministic models the idea of permanence which guarantees convergence on an interior attractor from any strictly positive initial conditions is regarded as a strong form of coexistence perma nence of dynamical systems has been studied by many researchers using lyapunov exponents shreiber 2000 garay and hofbauer 2003 salceanu and smith 2009 and average lyapunov functions garay and hofbauer 2003 kon 2004 kang and chesson 2010 have used lyapunov exponents and the notions of unsaturated invariant sets i e a compact invariant set that is repelling respect to the system and measures for kolmogorov type systems recent study by kon 2004 uses an average lyapunov function to show that nonexistence of saturated boundary fixed points is sufficient for permanence under certain convexity and concavity conditions on the per capita growth rates of the species kang and chesson 2010 make use of the concept of the relative nonlinearity chesson 1994 to extend kon s 2004 results beyond convexity and concavity conditions to arbitrary nonlinearities for two dimensional discrete time 1 applied sciences and mathematics arizona state university mesa az 85212 usa e mail yun kang asu edu preprint submitted to elsevier july 19 2021 http arxiv org abs 1102 5563 v 1 competition and prey predator models however kang and chesson 2010 as well as kon 2004 make assumptions on the monotonicity of f x y and g x y e g f y and g x does not change the sign in this article we will drop this assumption and derive a easy to check permanence criterion for a general two species interaction model with the per capita growth rates being non monotone by using the theory of average lyapunov functions and extending the ecological concept of the relative nonlinearity the original concept of relative nonlinearity is a species coexistence mechanism that results from different species having different nonlinear responses to competition together with fluctuations in time or space in the intensity of competition chesson 1994 2000 kang and chesson 2010 this extended concept allows us to fully characterize the effects of nonlinearities in the per capita growth functions which are of major significance in the presence of fluctuated populations and non monotonic per capita growth rates the structure of the rest paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce some basic termi nology of semi dynamical systems and prove the important lemmas that are critical to derive sufficient criterion for the permanence of two species interaction models with non monotonic per capita growth rates in section 3 we give a simple sufficient condition for the permanence of prey predation models with non monotonic per capita growth rates in section 5 we apply our results to specific competition models and prey predator models with generic with non monotone per capita growth rates we conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and prospectus for future work in this area 2 preliminary results let x x y x 0 y 0 sx x 0 x 0 sy 0 y y 0 and s sx sy m x s x y x 0 y 0 define a discrete two dimensional dynamical system h x x where x is a metric space and denote h 0 x y x y and hn x y xn yn we call that h is positively invariant in x if h n x x for any n z we call that h is dissipative if there exists b 0 for all initial condition x y x such that lim supmax xn yn b this implies that h has a compact absorbing set in x for convenience when a system h is dissipative we will consider x is a compact metric space we call that h is permanent in m if there exists two positive numbers 0 b b for all initial condition x y m such that b lim inf min xn yn lim supmax xn yn b this implies that h has a compact interior attractor b m that attracts all the points in m the boundary equilibrium x y s is unsaturated if f x y 1 and g x y 1 the positive orbit of h with initial condition x 0 y 0 x is defined as x 0 y 0 xi yi xi yi hi x 0 y 0 for all i z the omega limit set of x y r 2 is defined as x y htj x y for some sequences tj 2 the omega limit set of a subset s x of x is defined as s x y s x y the main goal of this paper is to find a sufficient conditions on f and g such that the system 1 2 is permanent in m when f x 0 f 0 y g x 0 and g 0 y are non monotonic in s i e at least one of the follows change sign in s f x 0 x f 0 y y g 0 y y g x 0 x 2 1 external lyapunov exponents let xi yi i 0 to be the positive orbit with initial conditions x 0 y 0 s then the average per capita growth rates of species x y with initial conditions x 0 0 sx or 0 y 0 sy after n 1 generations can be represented as rxxn x 0 0 n 1 i 0 ln f xi 0 n ryxn x 0 0 n 1 i 0 ln g xi 0 n 3 ryyn 0 y 0 n 1 i 0 ln g 0 yi n rxyn 0 y 0 n 1 i 0 ln f 0 yi n 4 define r xx x 0 0 r yx x 0 0 r yy 0 y 0 r xy 0 y 0 as the lim sup of the sequences rxxn x 0 0 n 1 ryxn x 0 0 n 1 ryyn 0 y 0 n 1 rxyn 0 y 0 n 1 respectively moreover we use r xx x 0 y 0 r yx x 0 0 r yy x 0 y 0 r xy 0 y 0 instead if their limits actually exist notice that the quantity r yx x 0 0 or r xy 0 y 0 is the external lyapunov exponent of sx or sy which gives the average invasion speed of the invader y or x rand wilson mcglade 1994 if both r yx x 0 0 and r xy 0 y 0 are positive for all x 0 0 y 0 0 then species y and x are able to coexist the interesting question is that what kind of conditions on f x y g x y can guarantee this therefore guarantee the system 1 2 is permanent in order to answer this question we assume that f x y and g x y of 1 2 satisfy condition h in the rest of the article where h is stated as follows h both f x y and g x y are strictly positive and twice differentiable in x 0 0 with f 0 0 1 and g 0 0 0 in addition the following two limits exist and are continuous lim x 0 f x y f 0 y and lim y 0 g x y g x 0 remark condition h implies that the system 1 2 is positively invariant in x now we need to show the following two lemmas first lemma 2 1 bounded population density assume that f x y in the system 1 2 satisfies con dition h if there exists 0 a 1 such that lim x sup y r f x y a then the population density of species x is bounded by some positive constant moreover if x 0 y 0 sx with x 0 0 then r xx x 0 0 0 3 proof define a 1 x supy r f x y then the condition limx supy r f x y a 1 indicates that for any a 1 there exists a number l large enough such that a 1 x a 1 for all x l since a 1 x supy r f x y therefore f x y a 1 x a 1 for all x l y 0 now if an initial condition of species x is greater than l i e x 0 l then there exists a positive integer n such that xn l assume that this is not true then for any positive integer n we have xn l in particular we have xn xn 1 f xn 1 yn 1 x 0 n 1 i 0 f xi yi x 0 a n 0 as n this is a contradiction to the fact that xn l for all n z therefore there exists a positive integer n such that xn l define lm l max x y 0 l 2 f x y we claim that if xn l then xn lm for all n n suppose that this is not true then there exists some positive integer p such that xn p lm let pm min p n xn p lm then we have xpm lm and xpm 1 lm this implies that either xpm 1 l or l xpm 1 lm if xpm 1 l then xpm xpm 1 f xpm 1 y l max x y 0 l 2 f x y lm which is a contradiction to xpm lm if l xpm 1 lm then due to the fact that f x y a 1 for all x y l 0 we have xpm xpm 1 f xpm 1 y xpm 1 a lm which is also a contradiction to xpm lm therefore we have xn lm for all n n this implies that for any initial condition x 0 y 0 x with x 0 0 there exists a positive integer pm such that xn lm for all n pm therefore the population density of species x is bounded in the system 1 2 next notice that sx is positively invariant then for any initial condition in sx we have yn 0 for all future n 0 i e we have the following boundary dynamics xn 1 xnf xn 0 for all n 0 then by applying lemma b 1 kang and chesson 2010 we can conclude that for any initial condition x 0 0 with x 0 0 the following inequalities hold 0 b lim inf n xn lim sup n xn lm 4 let xi 0 i 0 to be the positive orbit x 0 0 starting at x 0 0 then we have 0 lim n ln b x 0 n lim inf n ln xn 1 x 0 n lim sup n ln xn 1 x 0 n lim sup n ln b x 0 n 0 this implies that for all x 0 0 we have r xx x 0 0 lim n n 1 i 0 ln f xi 0 n lim n n 1 i 0 ln xn 1 x 0 n 0 therefore we have proved the statement remark lemma 2 1 gives an easy to check sufficient criterion for species x being bounded in a joint system 1 2 which can not only can apply to competition and prey predator models but also can apply to the mutualism system for example we can apply lemma 2 1 to show that the following mutualism model 5 6 kon 2004 is dissipative xt 1 xte r 1 a 11 xt a 12 y v 11 t 1 y v 12 t 5 yt 1 yte r 2 a 22 yt a 21 x v 22 t 1 x v 21 t 6 where 0 v 11 v 12 and 0 v 22 v 21 for convenience define f x y ln f x y g x y ln g x y and fi gi i x y as the first partial derivative respect to i fii gii i x y as the second partial derivative respect to i let xi 0 i 0 to be a positive orbit x 0 0 with x 0 0 then we have the following lemma lemma 2 2 the external lyapunov exponent let x 0 be a point in sx such that f x 0 0 and fx x 0 6 0 then the following two cases hold if condition h holds as well as lim n f x 0 a 1 1 case one if f 0 0 1 then r xx x 0 0 0 where x 0 0 in addition the external lyapunov exponent of sx is r yx x 0 0 g x 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 f x 0 y x 0 case two if f 0 0 1 then r xx x 0 0 0 where x 0 0 in addition if gx x 0 fx x 0 0 then the external lyapunov exponent of sx satisfies follows r yx x 0 0 g x 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 f x 0 y x 0 where y lim sup n 1 i 0 xi x 2 1 0 1 t gxx xit 0 gx x 0 fxx xit 0 fx x 0 dt n and xit x xi x t proof the condition that limn f x 0 a 1 1 indicates that the superior of the average growth rate of the species x without species y is less than or equal zero by applying lemma 2 1 i e for all initial conditions x 0 0 we have r xx x 0 0 lim sup n n 1 i 0 f xi 0 n lim sup n ln xn x 0 n lim sup n ln b x 0 n 0 5 doing exact 2 nd order taylor expansion on f xi 0 g xi 0 around x x gives f xi 0 f x 0 fx x 0 xi x xi x 2 1 0 1 t fxx xit 0 dt g xi 0 g x 0 gx x 0 xi x xi x 2 1 0 1 t gxx xit 0 dt where xit x xi x t then we have rxxn x 0 0 n 1 i 0 f xi 0 n f x 0 fx x 0 n 1 i 0 xi x n n 1 i 0 xi x 2 1 0 1 t fxx xit 0 dt n this implies that we have n 1 i 0 xi x n rxxn x 0 f x 0 fx x 0 n 1 i 0 xi x 2 1 0 1 t fxx xit 0 dt nfx x 0 this implies that we can rewrite ryxn x 0 as follows ryxn x 0 n 1 i 0 g xi 0 n g x 0 gx x 0 n 1 i 0 xi x n n 1 i 0 xi x 2 1 0 1 t gxx xit 0 dt n g x

gx x 0 fxx xit 0 fx x 0 dt n define y x 0 as y x 0 1 0 1 t gxx xit 0 gx x 0 fxx xit 0 fx x 0 dt then we have case one if f 0 0 1 then by applying lemma 2 1 we have r xx x 0 0 lim n rxxn x 0 0 0 this indicates that r yx x 0 0 g x 0 f x 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 y x 0 case two if gx x 0 fx x 0 0 then due to the fact that lim inf n rxxn x 0 0 r xx x 0 0 0 we have r yx x 0 0 g x 0 f x 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 lim infn rxx n x 0 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 y x 0 g x 0 f x 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 y x 0 remark in the case that x 0 is a nontrivial boundary fixed point then f x 0 0 thus we have the following corollary from lemma 2 2 6 corollary 2 1 the external lyapunov exponent assume that all conditions in lemma 2 2 hold as well as f x 0 0 then case one if f 0 0 1 then the external lyapunov exponent of sx is r yx x 0 0 g x 0 y x 0 case two if f 0 0 1 and gx x 0 fx x 0 0 then the external lyapunov exponent of sx satisfies follows r yx x 0 0 g x 0 y x 0 where y is defined as the same in lemma 2 2 remark the expression gxx x 0 gx x 0 fxx x 0 fx x 0 in corollary 2 1 can be considered as the extended ecological concept of the relative nonlinearity from kang and chesson 2010 this allows us to give an easy to check sufficient criterion for permanence applicable to a broad range of situations and avoids checking the detailed information on sx and calculating the external lyapunov exponent r yx x 0 0 depending on the signs of g x 0 and y x 0 there are four situations permanence if both g x 0 and y x 0 are nonnegative and at least one of them is positive for all x 0 r then the external lyapunov exponent r yx x 0 0 of sx is positive thus we can apply theorem 2 2 and its corollary 2 3 of huston 1984 to show that species y is permanent we will focus on this case in this article relative permanence notice that it is possible that g x 0 0 but r yx x 0 0 is still positive for almost every x 0 sx this is the case when permanence fails due to the nontrivial boundary equilibrium point x 0 being saturated which give a proper setting for the relative permanence kang 2011 a kang and smith 2011 b boundary attractor the case when r yx x 0 0 0 for all x 0 sx represents the case when fluctu ations associated with the non point attractor undermine permanence because then the invasion rate is lower than that predicted by the point attractor x 0 thus the system has no perma nence due to existing attractors on the sx there are many models kon 2006 kang et al 2008 presenting this scenario under some proper parameter ranges multiple attractors the case when r yx x 0 0 0 for a dense set of x 0 sx is a mixture of case 2 and 3 which can generate rich dynamics such as riddled basin of attractions ashwin et al 1996 ferriere and gatto 1995 kon 2006 3 sufficient conditions for the permanence of a general two species interaction models let species x and y interact with each other in an ecology community and their population density can be described by the system 1 2 we are interested in a two species system 1 2 that satisfies condition h as well as the following conditions g 1 there exists a 1 a 2 such that lim x sup y 0 f x y a 1 1 and lim y sup x 0 g x y a 2 1 g 2 all the nontrivial boundary fixed points are unsaturated i e if x 0 and 0 y are nontrivial boundary fixed points then f 0 y 1 and g x 0 1 7 g 3 there exists some point x 0 sx such that fx x 0 6 0 and g x 0 gx x 0 f x 0 fx x 0 0 and the equality 7 holds ry x gxx x 0 gx x 0 fxx x 0 fx x 0 0 for all x 0 7 g 4 if g 0 0 1 then there exists point 0 y sy such that gy 0 y 6 0 and f 0 y fy 0 y g 0 y gy 0 y 0 and the inequality 8 holds rx y fyy 0 y fy 0 y gyy 0 y gy 0 y 0 for all y 0 8 if g 0 0 1 then fy 0 y gy 0 y 0 holds in addition to 8 holds condition h guarantees that the population of species x and y will not drop below 0 and species x will not be too close to the origin 0 0 condition g 1 implies that both species x and y suffer from intra competition which drops their per capita fecundity below 1 if their population density is too large regardless of other species population the per capita growth rates f g can be non monotonic with respect to x y condition g 2 ensures that both species x and y have nonnegative growth rates at the nontrivial boundary equilibria condition g 3 g 4 guarantee that species x and species y have positive invading speed when their population density are rare the last condition g 4 also implies that species y is able to persist even if it is not persistent in its single state i e g 0 0 1 more importantly 7 8 is an extended concept of the relative nonlinearity that introduced by chesson chesson 2000 relative nonlinearity is a species coexistence mechanism that results from different species having different nonlinear responses to competition together with fluctuations in time or space in the intensity of competition chesson 1994 the expressions 7 8 can be treated as a general form of relative nonlinearity when fx x 0 gx x 0 fy 0 y gy 0 y are non invertible chesson 2000 more generally we can consider ry x or rx y as a contribution to the invading speed of species y or x due to species x or y has fluctuated population in its single state e g if species x or y has only point attractors x i 0 i 1 u or 0 y j j 1 v then r y x 0 or rx y 0 if the species x has non point attractors i e fluctuated populations then the contribution ry x can be positive or negative in this paper we focus on the case when both ry x and rx y are nonnegative and the main goal of this section is to prove the following theorem theorem 3 1 sufficient conditions on permanence of two species models if the system 1 2 satisfies condition g 1 g 4 as well as condition h then it is permanent in m proof since the system 1 2 satisfies condition h g 1 then according to lemma 2 1 there exists a positive number l such that for any initial condition x 0 y 0 x we have lim sup n max xn yn l therefore the system is dissipative in x in addition according to lemma 2 1 condition h g 1 also implies r xx x 0 0 0 for all x 0 0 and the following two cases 1 r yy 0 y 0 0 for all y 0 0 if g 0 0 1 2 r yy 0 y 0 0 for all y 0 0 if g 0 0 1 let xk 0 k 0 and 0 yk k 0 be positive orbits with initial conditions x 0 0 and y 0 0 respectively and xkt x xk x t ykt y yk y t k 1 8 then apply lemma 2 2 we have r yx x 0 0 g x i 0 f x 0 gx x 0 fx x 0 y x 0 where y x 0 lim sup n 1 k 0 xk x 2 1 0 1 t gxx xkt 0 gx x 0 fxx xkt 0 fx x 0 dt n and the following two cases depending on the value of g 0 0 1 if g 0 0 1 then r xy 0 y 0 f 0 y fy 0 y g 0 y gy 0 y x y 0 2 if g 0 0 1 and fy 0 y gy 0 y 0 then r xy 0 y 0 f 0 y fy 0 y g 0 y gy 0 y x y 0 where x y 0 lim sup n 1 i 0 yk y 2 1 0 1 t fyy 0 ykt fy 0 y gyy 0 ykt gy 0 y dt n then according to condition g 2 g 3 and g 4 we have 1 if g 0 0 1 then inf x 0 0 r yx x 0 0 0 and inf y 0 0 r xy 0 y 0 0 2 if g 0 0 1 and fy 0 y gy 0 y 0 then inf x 0 0 r yx x 0 0 0 and inf y 0 0 r xy 0 y 0 0 now we have the following two cases depending on the value of g 0 0 1 if g 0 0 1 then define p x y xy thus p xn yn p x 0 y 0 n 1 i 0 f xi yi g xi yi n 1 i 0 e f xi yi g xi yi e n 1 i 0 f xi yi g xi yi en r xx n x 0 y 0 r yy n x 0 y 0 therefore we have the following inequalities hold sup n 0 lim inf x 0 y 0 m x 0 sx p xn yn p x 0 y 0 e r xx x 0 infx 0 r yx x 0 1 sup n 0 lim inf x 0 y 0 m 0 y sy p xn yn p x 0 y 0 e r yy 0 y infy 0 r xy 0 y 1 in addition for all x y s we have p x y 0 then by applying theorem 2 2 of hutson 1984 to the system 1 2 we can conclude that the system is permanent in m 9 2 if g 0 0 1 then define p x y x thus p xn yn p x 0 y 0 n 1 i 0 f xi yi n 1 i 0 ef xi yi e n 1 i 0 f xi yi en r xy n x 0 y 0 therefore we have the following inequalities hold sup n 0 lim inf x 0 y 0 m y 0 sy p xn yn p x 0 y 0 einfx 0 r xy 0 y 1 in addition for all x y sx we have p x y 0 then by applying theorem 2 2 of hutson 1984 to the system 1 2 we can conclude that species x is permanent this implies that we can restrict the system in the space b lm 0 lm with b 0 this allows us to apply hutson s theorem 2 2 1984 again to obtain the permanence of species y in the joint system 1 2 by using the average lyapunov function p x y y thus the system is permanent in m remark if the system 1 2 is discrete version of lokter volterra models then f x 0 g x 0 and f 0 y g 0 y are linear functions in x and y respectively therefore lokter volterra models are permanent if condition g 2 holds corollary 3 1 alternative version of condition g 3 g 4 assume that the system 1 2 satisfies condition h g 1 g 2 and condition g 3 g 4 then the system is permanent in x where condition g 3 g 4 are stated as follows g 3 there exists some point x 0 sx such that fx x 0 6 0 g x 0 gx x 0 f x 0 fx x 0 0 and for all xi 0 we have ry xi 1 0 1 t gxx xit 0 gx x 0 fxx xit 0 fx x 0 dt 0 where xit x xi x t 9 g 4 if g 0 0 1 then there exists point 0 y sy such that gy 0 y 6 0 f 0 y fy 0 y g 0 y gy 0 y 0 and the inequality 10 holds for all yi 0 rx yi 1 0 1 t fyy 0 yit fy 0 y gyy 0 yit gy 0 y dt 0 where yit y yi y t 10 if g 0 0 1 then fy 0 y gy 0 y 0 and f 0 y fy 0 y g 0 y gy 0 y 0 for some point 0 y sy in addition to 10 holds remark the proof of corollary 3 1 is similar as the proof of theorem 3 1 and is straightforward therefore we omit the details in the case that x 0 and 0 y are nontrivial boundary equilibria points i e f x 0 g 0 y 0 then the conditions f 0 y fy 0 y g 0 y gy 0 y 0 and g x 0 gx x 0 f x 0 fx x 0 0 can be dropped 10 4 sufficient conditions for the permanence of a general prey predator model let species x be a prey and y be the predator of x in an ecology community and their population densities can be described by the discrete system 1 2 in a prey predator model the predator per capita growth rate is an increasing function of prey abundance and its per capita growth rate is commonly negative at zero prey abundance thus the predator cannot survive without the prey i e g 0 y 1 for all y 0 we are interested in a prey predator model 1 2 satisfies condition h as well as the following conditions p 1 g x y x 0 and g 0 y 0 for all x y x p 2 there exists a 1 a 2 such that lim x sup y 0 f x y a 1 1 and for any x 0 lim y g x y a 2 1 p 3 all the nontrivial boundary fixed points are unsaturated i e if x 0 is an nontrivial boundary fixed point then g x 0 1 p 4 there exists some boundary fixed point x 0 such that ry x gxx x 0 gx x 0 fxx x 0 fx x 0 0 for all x 0 11 or there exists some nontrivial boundary fixed point x 0 such that for all xi 0 we have ry x 1 0 1 t gxx xit 0 gx x 0 fxx xit 0 fx x 0 dt 0 where xit x xi x t 12 condition p 1 p 2 and h guarantees that the prey x is permanent without the predator y inp 1 the condition g 0 y 0 y 0 implies that the predator has positive per capita growth rate in p 2 the condition limy g x y a 2 1 for any given x 0 implies that for any given prey population size x the finite rate of increase of the predator drops below 1 such behavior is normally described as predator interference i e predator individuals interact negatively with one another limiting their ability to hunt prey condition p 3 p 4 makes sure that predator y is persistent with presence of prey x we want to show the following theorem theorem 4 1 if the system 1 2 satisfies condition h p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 then it is permanent in m proof since the system 1 2 satisfies condition p 1 p 2 then by applying lemma 2 1 we know that there exists a positive number lm such that for any initial condition x 0 y 0 x we have lim sup n xn lm and r xx x 0 0 0 for all x 0 0 this implies that for any x 0 y 0 x there exists a positive integer n such that xn lm for all n n by using the fact that g x y is increasing with respect to x we can conclude that there exists n large enough such that yn 1 yng xn yn yng lm yn for all n n 11 since and for any given x 0 we have lim y g x y a 2 1 therefore we can apply lemma b 1 kang and chesson 2010 to conclude that there exists a positive number b lm such that lim sup n yn b therefore the system is dissipative in m now we can show that prey x is persistent in the joint system 1 2 by applying hutson s theorem 2 2 and its corollary 2 3 1984 with an average lyapunov function p x y x then we can restrict the system in the space b lm 0 b this allows us to apply hutson s theorem 2 2 1984 again to obtain permanence of y in the joint system by using the average lyapunov function p x y y therefore the system is permanent in m hence we have shown the statement remark note that g x y x 0 thus for any nontrivial boundary fixed point x 0 we havegx x 0 0 thus there are the following two simplified cases 1 if both f x 0 and g 0 x are convex or linear then fx x 0 0 and g x 0 0 indicates that the system 1 2 is permanent 2 if f x 0 is convex or linear andg x 0 is concave or linear then fx x 0 0 andg x 0 0 indicates that the system 1 2 is permanent 5 applications in this section we apply the results to particular competition and prey predator models 5 1 a competition model with strong allee effects in one species multiple stable states occur when more than one type of community can stably persist in a single en vironmental regime simple theoretical analyses predict multiple stable states for single species dynamics via strong allee effects perhaps the most common allee effect occurs in species subject to predation by a generalist predator with a saturating functional response schreiber 2003 the population dynamics of a species suffering allee effects due to predator saturation can be modeled as nt 1 nte r 1 nt k i nt 13 where i n e m 1 sn

respectively non dimensionalizing 13 by setting yt nt k and b sk gives yt 1 yte r 1 yt m 1 byt 14 whose dynamics depends exclusively on the quantities r b and m if r m r b 1 2 4 b and b 1 then 14 suffers from strong allee effects which leads to two positive equilibria that can be expressed as follows y r b 1 r 2 1 b 2 4 mbr 2 rb assume that the population dynamics of species x and y can be modeled as follows xt 1 xte r 1 1 xt m 1 yt 1 b 1 yt 15 yt 1 yte r 2 1 yt m 2 1 b 2 yt axt xt c 16 12 where ri i 1 2 represents the intrinsic growth rates of species x and y respectively the term e m 1 yt 1 b 1 yt represents that species x suffers the saturated inter competition from species y the term e ax x c represents that species y benefits from species x if the abundance of x below the threshold c otherwise species y suffers inter competition from x this system 15 16 models the following two features of the interactions between two species 1 multiple equilibria the species y suffers strong allee effects in the absence of species x i e r 2 m 2 r 2 b 2 1 2 4 b 2 and b 2 1 2 threshold if the population of species x is below c then species y benefits from the presence of species x however if the population of species x is above c then species y suffers from inter competition from x it is easy to check that the system 15 16 satisfies condition h g 1 the boundary fixed points of the system are 0 0 1 0 0 y 1 and 0 y 2 where y 1 r 2 b 2 1 r 22 1 b 2 2 4 m 2 b 2 r 2 2 r 2 b 2 and y 2 r 2 b 2 1 r 22 1 b 2 2 4 m 2 b 2 r 2 2 r 2 b 2 thus if r 2 m 2 a c 1 0 and r 1 m 1 y 2 1 b 1 y 2

competition model with weak allee effects in both species a species suffering weak allee effects due to predator saturation can be modeled by 14 when r m then a two species competition model that is

apply theorem 3 1 to gain the following corollary corollary 5 2 the system 17 18 is permanent in m if the following conditions hold 14 condition 1 ri mi i 1 2 condition 2 f 0 y 0 and g x 0 0 condition

and in kon 2004 fail while theorem 3 1 applies 5 3 a prey predator model one dimensional heuristic models of single species population dynamics subject to the weak allee effect can be represented as 19 lewis and kareiva 1993 amarasekare 1998 a 1998 b keitt et al 2001 dx dt x r b x a 2 19 where all the parameters are strictly positive and r ba 2 then the discrete version of 19 can be represented as xt 1 xte r b xt a 2 20 let xt and yt represent the population density of prey x and predator y at generation t respectively then a prey predator model with prey subject to weak allee effects can be defined as xt 1 xte r b xt a 2 c 1 yt 21 yt 1 yte c 2 x 2 t dyt 22 where all the parameters are strictly positive and r ba 2 the fact that all the parameters are nonneg ative implies that this prey predator system 21 22 satisfies condition h p 1 p 2 thus 21 22 is dissipative since r ba 2 then the only nontrivial boundary equilibrium is x 0 a r b 0 therefore the system satisfies condition p 3 since g x 0 ec 2 x 2 1 let f x y r b x a 2 c 1 y and g x y c 2 x 2 dy then f 0 0 ln f 0 0 r ba 2 0 g 0 y ln g 0 y dy 0 and fx x 0 2 b x a fxx x 0 2 b fy 0 y c 1 fyy 0 y 0 gx x 0 2 c 2 x gxx x 0 2 c 2

applying theorem 4 1 corollary 5 3 assume that all the parameters of the system 21 22 are strictly positive and r ba 2 then the system is permanent in m if the following conditions hold 1 a r b rb 0 i e a 2 r b 1 b 2 remark notice that fx x 0 will change signs as x depending on the value of x thus permanence theorems in kang and chesson 2010 and in kon 2004 fail while theorem 4 1 applies 15 6 discussion population per capita growth rate describes the per capita rate of growth of a population as the fac tor by which population size increases per year conventionally given the symbol nt 1 nt or as r ln therefore population per capita growth rate is the summary parameter of trends in population density or abundance which tells us whether density and abundance are increasing stable or decreasing and how fast they are changing sibly and hone 2002 the per capita growth rate of a population can be broken down into negative density dependent density independent and positive density dependent fac tors shreiber 2003 negative density dependent factors include resource depletion due to competition tilman 1982 environment modification jones et al 1997 mutual interference arditi and akcakaya 1990 and cannibalism fox 1975 positive density dependent factors include predator saturation co operative predation or resource defense increased availability of mates and conspecific enhancement of reproduction courchamp et al 1999 stephens and sutherland 1999 stephens et al 1999 combined with all density dependent factors population per capita growth rate can be negative density dependent in some range of population density and positive density dependent in some other ranges i e the per capita growth rate of a population may be non montonic with respect to its population density processing multiple nontrivial equilibria is one important consequence of a species with non monotonic per capita growth rate the possibility that plant and animal populations have multiple positive equilib ria has received considerable attention in the ecological literature theory and observation indicate that natural multi species assemblies of plants and animals are likely to possess several different equilibrium points may 1977 ecological examples include fish e g peterman 1977 spencer and collie 1997 insects e g ludwig et al 1978 kuussaari et al 1998 solow et al 2003 and phytoplankton e g beltrami 1989 moreover subtidal marine ecosystems in general and reefs in particular have several attributes which favor the existence of multiple stable states knowlton 1992 beyond its scientific interest this possibility also has important implications for the conservation and management of natural systems carpenter 2001 in this article we focus on the permanence of a general two species inter action model with non monotonic per capita growth rate for the first time our results broaden the applications of permanence for general two species interaction models many mathematicians fonda 1988 freedman so 1989 shreiber 2000 garay and hofbauer 2003 kon 2004 salceanu and smith 2009 kang and chesson 2010 have studied sufficient conditions on permanence of the dynamical systems in this paper we give an easy to check sufficient condition for guaranteeing the permanence of systems that can model complicated two species interactions by using the average lyapunov functions and extending the ecological concept of the relative nonlinearity the extended relative nonlinearity allows us to fully characterize the effects of nonlinearities in the per capita growth functions with non monotonicity these results are illustrated with specific two species competition and predator prey models in particular we would like to point out that our result can apply to these models while theorems in kang and chession 2010 as well as kon 2004 fails in addition our theorem can be easily extended to the mutualism models like 5 6 extend our results to higher dimensional discrete time population models i e food web dynamics in ecology will be our future work acknowledgements the author would like to thank professor peter chesson for his encouragement in
