competition model we give sufficient conditions on the persistence of one species and the existence of local asymptotically stable interior period 2 orbit for this system moreover we show that for a certain parameter range there exists a compact interior attractor that attracts all interior points except a lebesgue measure zero set this result gives a weaker form of coexistence which is referred to as relative permanence this new concept of coexistence combined with numerical simulations strongly suggests that the basin of attraction of the locally asymptotically stable interior period 2 orbit is an infinite union of connected components this idea may apply to many other ecological models finally we discuss the generic dynamical structure that gives relative permanence keywords basin

mathematical models can provide important insight into the general conditions that permit the coexistence of competing species and the situations that lead to competitive exclusion elaydi and yakubu 2002 a model of resource mediated competition between two competing species can be described as follows adler 1990 franke and yakubu 1991 a 1991 b xn 1 r 1 xn a xn yn 1 yn 1 yne r 2 xn yn 2 where xn and yn denote the population sizes of two competing species x and y at generation n respectively all parameters r 1 r 2 a are strictly positive franke and yakubu 1991 a established the ecological principle of mutual exclusion as a mathematical theorem in a general discrete two species competition system including 1 2 they 1991 b also gave an example that such exclusion principle fails where two species can coexist through a locally stable period 2 orbit this phenomenon of coexistence has been observed in many other competition models e g yakubu corresponding author email yun kang asu edu

the equation 3 is the non overlapping lottery model chesson 1981 with singularity at the origin every initial condition x 0 0 with x 0 0 maps to r 1 0 the lottery model emphasizes the role of chance it assumes that resources are captured at random by recruits from a larger pool of potential colonists sale 1978 chapter 18 chain et al 2011 when yn 0 3 can be a reasonably good approximation for plant species where a single individual can sometimes grow very big in the absence of competition from others or for a territorial marine species such as coral reef fish where a single individual puts out huge number of larvae communications with p chesson also see sale 1978 chesson and warner 1981 used such non overlapping lottery models to study competition of species in a temporally varying environment in this paper we focus on the dynamics of 3 4 the system 3 4 may be an appropriate model for resource competition between a territorial species x and a non territorial species y a recent study by kang submitted to jdea shows that 3 4 is persistent with respect to the total population of two species i e all initial conditions in r 2 0 0 are attracted to a compact set which is bounded away from the origin the results obtained in kang preprint 2010 allow us to explore the structure of the basin of attraction of the asymptotically stable period 2 orbit of the system 3 4 lying in the interior of the quadrant in this article we study the global dynamics of 3 4 the objectives of our study are two fold 1 mathematically it is interesting to study the global dynamics of 3 4 since it has sin gularity at the origin thus the first objective of our study is to give sufficient conditions for competitive exclusion and coexistence of 3 4 2 biologically it is very important to classify and give sufficient conditions for the coexis tence of species in ecological models among many forms of coexistence permanence is the strongest concept since it requires all strictly positive initial conditions converge to the bounded interior attractor although permanence fails for 3 4 we establish the weaker notion relative permanence almost all relative to lebesgue measure strictly pos itive initial conditions converge to the bounded interior attractor numerical simulations of other ecological models e g franke and yakubu 1991 kon 2006 cushing henson and blackburn 2007 kuang and chesson 2008 suggest the possibility that relative perma nence may apply where permanence fails our second objective of this article is to draw attentions on the concept of relative permanence our study could potentially provide insight on weaker forms of coexistence for general ecological models and open problems on the basins of attractions of stable cycles for a discrete competition model studied by elaydi and yakubu 2002 a simple analysis combined with numerical simulations suggest the following interesting dynamics of the system 3 4 1 there is no interior fixed point the eigenvalue governing the local transverse stability of the boundary equilibrium on the x axes i e y 0 is given by er 2 r 1 or r 1 r 2 on the y axes if this eigenvalue is less than 1 then we say that the equilibrium point on the x axes or y axes is transversally stable otherwise it is transversally unstable thus if r 1 r 2 then the boundary equilibrium r 1 0 is transversally stable and 0 r 2 is transversally unstable while r 1 r 2 r 1 0 is transversally unstable and 0 r 2 is transversally stable 2 for a certain range of r 1 and r 2 values there exists an asymptotically stable periodic 2 orbit in the interior of the quadrant which attracts almost every interior point in r 2 for november 8 2021 2 31 journal of biological dynamics revision journal of biological dynamics 3 example when r 1 2 r 2 2 2 the periodic

points of r 2 except all the pre images of the heteroclinic curve c where c is the closure of the union of all heteroclinic orbits see figure 2 figure 2 the basin of attraction of the interior period 2 orbit is the open quadrant minus the pre images of the heteroclinic curve c the latter partition the quadrant into components which are colored according to which of the two periodic points attract points in the component under the second iterate of the map given a point in one of the regions there is a large number n such that the point will be very close to xi 1 y i 1 at the iteration t and will be very close to x i 2 y i 2 at the iteration t 1 for all t n moreover further analysis and numerical simulations suggest that if the system 3 4 satisfies the following conditions c 1 c 3 then it has the same global dynamics as the case r 1 2 r 2 2 2 c 1 the values of r 1 r 2 satisfy 2 r 2 2 52 r 2 r 1 1 and e 2 r 2 1 er 2 1 1 c 2 there is a boundary period 2 orbit my 1 2 0 y 1 0 y 2 where r

figure 3 schematic features of the system 3 4 when r 1 2 r 2 2 2 the structure of the rest of the article is as follows in section 2 we give the basic notations and preliminary results that will be used in proving our main theorems in section 3 we obtain sufficient conditions on the persistence of one species and the extinction of the other species by using lyapunov functions theorem 3 1 in section 4 we first give a sufficient condition on the existence of locally asymptotically stable interior period 2 orbit for the system 3 4 theorem 4 1 then we show that for a certain parameter range the system 3 4 is relative permanent i e it has a compact interior attractor that attracts almost points in r 2 theorem 4 3 by applying theorems from persistent theory in the last section 5 we discuss the fact that the global dynamics of the system 3 4 are generic rather than rare similar dynamic behaviors of 3 4 have been observed in many biological models studying sufficient conditions for the relative permanence of the generalization of such biological models can be our future direction 2 notations and preliminarily results notice that the system 3 4 has singularity at the origin 0 0 thus its state space is defined as x x y r 2 0 x y let h denote the map defined by 3 4 then h x x is a discrete semi dynamical system where h 0 0 0 x 0 y 0 and h n 0 n xn yn n z here we give some definitions that will be used in the rest of the article definition 2 1 pre images of a point for a given point 0 x we say x is a rank k pre image of 0 if h k 0 the collection of rank k k 1 pre images of 0 is defined as h k 0 x hk 0 and the collection of all pre images of 0 including k 0 is defined as ef 0 k 1 h k 0 0 november 8 2021 2 31 journal of biological dynamics revision journal of

an invariant set of h then h k m should not contain points in m for all k 1 definition 2 4 uniform weak repeller let x be a positively invariant subset of x we call the compact invariant set c is a uniformly weak repeller with respect to x if there exists some 0 such that lim sup n d hn c for any x c definition 2 5 uniform weak persistence let x be a positively invariant subset of x the semi flow h is called uniformly weakly persistent in x if there exists some 0 such that lim sup n hn for any x where x r is a persistence function e g x y x can be a persistence function if we want to study whether species x is uniformly weakly persistent or not we say species x is uniformly weakly persistent in x if there exists a 0 such that lim sup n xn for any x definition 2 6 uniform

2 1 er 2 1 1 let c be an invariant smooth curve of the system 3 4 and m be any compact subset of x then m 2 efc m 0 where m 2 is a lebesgue measure in r 2 remark lemma 2 9 and 2 10 are a direct corollary from theorem 2 2 and 3 3 in kang sub mitted to jdea 3 sufficient conditions for persistence in this section we investigate sufficient conditions for the extinction of one species and the persis tence of the other species in system 3 4 let d be the set defined in lemma 2 9 and denote d as the interior of d we can obtain sufficient conditions for the extinction of one species by using a lyapunov function v d r where v x y xcyd and c d are some constants in addition we give a sufficient condition on the persistence of species y by applying theorem 2 2 and its corollary of hutson hutson 1984 through defining an average lyapunov function p x y y in the compact positively invariant region d now we are going to give detailed proof of the following theorem theorem 3 1 persistence of one species 1 if r 1 r 2 0 then the system 3 4 has global stability at r 1 0 i e for any initial condition 0 x 0 y 0 x y x x 0 0 we have lim n hn 0 lim n hn x y r 1 0 2 if 0 r 1 r 2 then the species y is uniformly persistent in x i e there exists a positive number 0 such that for any initial condition 0 x 0 y 0 x y x y 0 we have lim inf n yn where xn yn h n 0 moreover if e 2 r 2 1 e r 2 1 r 1 1 then the species x goes to extinct for any 0 x 0 y 0 x y x y 0 i e lim n xn 0 proof according to lemma 2 9 any point in x is attracted to the compact positively invariant set d for any 0 rm therefore we can restrict the dynamics of 3 4 to d if r 1 r 2 0 define v x y x r 1 y then v h x y v x y r r 11 x y r 1 er 2 x y november 8 2021 2 31 journal of biological dynamics revision journal of

k max r 1 r 2 er 2 1 1 according to lemma 2 9 we know that d is positively invariant and attracts all points in x therefore any point in the region x 0 y 0 d x 0 0 has the following two situations 1 if y 0 0 then v h n x 0 y 0 v xn yn 0 or 2 if x 0 y 0 0 then v h x 0 y 0 v x 0 y 0 max x y d r r 11 x y r 1 er 2 x y max u k r r 11 u r 1 er 2 u r 1 r 1 r 1 er 2 r 1 1 thus v hn x 0 y 0 v x 0 y 0 v hn x 0 y 0 v n 1 x 0 y 0 v h x 0 y 0 v x 0 y 0 r 1 r 1 r 1 er 2 r 1 n 0 as n therefore the positively invariant property of d implies that lim n x r 1 n yn 0 therefore lim n yn 0 and lim inf n xn this indicates that lim n xn 1 lim n r 1 xn xn yn lim n r 1 1 yn xn r 1 therefore if r 1 r 2 0 then the system 3 4 has global stability at r 1 0 the first part of theorem 3 1 holds if r 2 r 1 0 then the omega limit set of sx x 0 x 0 is i e sx the external lyapunov exponent of sx is e r 2 r 1 1 therefore it is transversal unstable according to lemma 2 9 for any 0 rm d attracts all points in x thus the uniform persistence of species y follows from theorem 2 2 and its corollary of hutson hutson 1984 by defining a lyapunov function p x y y on the compact positively invariant region d i e there exists a positive number 0 such that for any y 0 0 we have lim inf n yn if in addition r 1 e 2 r 2 1 er 2 1 then we can define a lyapunov function as v x y xy 1 then we have v h x y v x y r 1 x y er 2 x y november 8 2021 2 31 journal of biological dynamics revision 8 taylor francis and i t consultant now choose min r 1 r 2 e 2 r 2 1 e r 2 1 r 1 e r 2 r 1 then r 1 since r 2 r 1 e 2 r 2 1 e r 2 1 therefore any point x 0 y 0 dr 1 satisfies r 1 x y er 2 1 and will stay in dr 1 for all future time this implies that for any point x 0 y 0 in dr 1 with y 0 0 we have v h x 0 y 0 v x 0 y 0 max x y dr

in some finite time or converge to r 1 0 now we consider the following two cases for any initial condition x 0 y 0 x dr 1 with y 0 0 1 if x 0 0 then xn 0 for all positive integer n 2 if x 0 0 then x y will not converge to r 1 0 since the equilibrium point r 1 0 is a saddle and transversal unstable when r 2 r 1 therefore x y will enter dr 1 in some finite time thus the condition r 1 r 2 and r 1 e 2 r 2 1 er 2 1 guarantees that lim n xn 0 therefore the second part of theorem 3 1 holds remark the first part of theorem 3 1 can be considered as a special case of rational growth rate dominating exponential franke and yakubu 1991 which states that if species x with rational growth rate can invade species y with exponential growth rate at species y s fixed point i e 0 r 2 is transversal unstable then the exponential species goes extinct irrespective of the initial population sizes the second part of theorem 3 1 shows that the exponential species can persistent whenever r 1 0 is transversal unstable i e r 2 r 1 however the rational species may not go extinct unless r 1 e 2 r 2 1 er 2 1 in fact simulations e g figure 2 suggest that two species of the system 3 4 may coexist for almost every initial conditions in x under certain conditions this point will be illustrated with greater details in the next section 4 coexistence of two species in this section we give sufficient conditions for the existence of the interior period 2 orbits and its local stability for the system 3 4 as the following theorem states theorem 4 1 sufficient conditions on the existence of interior period 2 orbits if r 2 2 then the ricker map yn 1 yne r 2 yn has period two orbits y 1 y 2 where 0 y 1 r 2 y 2 and y 1 y 2 2 r 2 the system 3 4 has an interior period 2 orbit p i 2 x i 1 y i 1 x i 2 y

then r 2 r 1 r 22 r 2 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 0 thus we have the following inequalities s 1 r 2 r 22 r 2 1 r 1 r 2 s 2 r 2 r 22 r 2 1 therefore from 5 we find that s 1 e r 2 s 1 s 2 0 is a sufficient condition for the existence of p i 2 notice that the ricker map yn 1 yne r 2 yn goes through period doubling two bifurcation at r 2 thus if r 2 2 the ricker map has a period 2 orbit y 1 y 2 where 0 y 1 r 2 y 2 y 2 y 1 e r 2 y 1 and y 1 y 2 2 r 2 since s 1 s 2 2 r 2 then from the graphic representation see figure 4 we can see that s 1 e r 2 s 1 s 2 0 whenever y 1 s 1 r 2 therefore the condition s 1 r 2 r 22 r 2 1 y 1 is a sufficient condition for s 1 e r 2 s 1 s 2 0 therefore it is a sufficient condition for the existence of p i 2 figure 4 the location between yi si i 1 2 and s 1 e

connecting r 1 0 to 0 r 2 let u l be the local unstable manifold of and sl be the local stable manifold of since the map h is smooth then according to stable manifold theorem theorem d 1 in appendix elaydi 2005 we can conclude that both ul and sl are smooth curves since 3 4 satisfies condition c 3 then there exists some positive integer k such that hk ul is smoothly connected with sl thus c is a smooth invariant curve with as its two end points then according to lemma 2 10 the statement holds 4 1 persistence of species x in new space x let sx x 0 d sy 0 y d s sx sy x y d xy 0 let c be the

statement we provide the detailed proof of the first two steps in the appendix and the remaining proof here november 8 2021 2 31 journal of biological dynamics revision journal of biological dynamics 13 1 c is a uniform weak repeller with respect to x i e there exists some b 0 for any x we have lim sup n d hn c b the detailed proof of this part has been shown in the appendix lemma a 1 this implies that any point in x is going to be away from c in some distance in some future time even if the point is very close to c 2 species x is uniformly weakly persistent in x i e there exists some 0 such that for any initial condition 0 x 0 y 0 x the system has lim sup n xn the detailed proof of this part has been shown in the appendix lemma a 2 this implies that any point in x is going to be away from s in some distance in some future time even if the point is very close to s 3 species x is uniformly persistent in x i e there exists some 0 such that for any initial condition x y x the system has lim inf n xn now we will show that the last step define a continuous and not identically zero persistent function d s where x then by the definition of the persistent function we have s x ht 0 t 0 is nonempty closed and positively invariant in addition the system h satisfies the following two conditions 1 there exists no bounded total trajectory such that 0 0 r 0 and t 0 for some positive integer r t 2 h has a compact attractor d which attracts all points in x from lemma a 2 we know that species x is uniformly weakly persistent in x thus by applying theorem 5 2 smith thieme 2010 we can conclude that species x is uniformly persistent in x i e there exists some 0 such that for any initial condition x y x the system has lim inf n xn notice that species y is uniformly persistent in x whenever r 2 r 1 according to theorem 3 1 thus species y is also uniformly persistent in x since x is a positively invariant subset of x therefore based on the argument above we can conclude that there exists some positive constant 0 such that for any initial condition taken in x we have lim inf n min xn yn hence there there exists a compact interior attractor that attracts all points in the interior of x except points in efc let m be any compact subset of the interior of x then any initial condition 0 taken in m will enter d in some future time through the following two cases 1 0 efc which will enter c in some finite time november 8 2021 2 31 journal of biological dynamics revision 14 taylor francis and i t consultant 2 0 x which is attracted to the interior compact attractor since there are only lebesgue measure zero of points in m that belong to efc therefore ac cording to lemma 2 10 we can conclude that m 2 efc m 0 for any compact subset m in the interior of x 5 discussion and future work in this article we study the global dynamics of the system 3 4 we give sufficient conditions for the uniform persistence of one species and the existence of locally asymptotically stable interior period 2 orbits for this system we also show that for a certain parameter range the system 3 4 is relative permanent i e there exists a compact interior attractor that attracts almost all points in x numerical simulations strongly suggest that this compact interior attractor is the locally asymptotically stable interior period 2 orbit p i 2 and its basin of attractions consists of a infinite union of connected regions that are separated by all pre images of the heteroclinic curve c see figure 2 the results that we obtained in theorem 3 1 are a special case for model 1 2 when a 0 our theorem 4 1 can be extended to the general model 1 2 when a 0 if r 2 2 and r 21 2 ar 2 the explicit expressions of the interior periodic 2 orbit x i 1 y i 1 x i 2 y i 2

2 1 a 0 1 and r 2 2 5 then the system 1 2 has locally stable interior periodic 2 orbit xi 1 y i 1 0 17 0 80 and x i 2 y i 2 0 33 3 70 along which the eigenvalues of the product of the jacobian matrices are 0 11 and 0 24 moreover numerical simulation suggests follows 1 there exits a heteroclinic orbit c connecting to see figure 7 2 the basin of attraction of the interior periodic 2 orbit p i 2 is all points in the interior of r 2 except a lebesgue measure zero set in r 2 which is a collection of all pre images of the heteroclinic curve c see figure 8 however more mathematical techniques need to be developed in order to obtain results similar to those in lemma 2 10 for the system 1 2 when a 0 this is an area for future study our results may apply to a two species discrete time lotka

neighborhood in some finite time if we choose small enough then is attracted to a compact neighborhood b u my x d my where my 1 2 in some finite time similarly the condition 0 r 1 r 2 implies that the boundary equilibrium is also a saddle by hartman grobman cushing theorem there exists some neighborhood u 2 of such that any point u 2 x will exit from this neigh borhood in some finite time choose min 1 2 let k c u u then k is a compact subset of c since c is the closure of the family of heteroclinic orbits connecting to then any point k will reach u in some finite time m moreover there exists

we have d hnk n k l k k c b which is a contradiction to a 1 2 if d hnk k k then there exists some m k m i 1 i m such that hm k hnk k h nk m k k u which we go back to the first case therefore there is

to either the first case or the second case therefore there is a contradiction to a 1 based on the arguments above we can conclude that the statement of lemma a 1 is true lemma a 2 uniform weak persistence if the system 3 4 satisfies condition c 1 c 3 then there exists some 0 such that for any initial condition 0 x 0 y 0 x the system has lim sup n xn proof since the system satisfies

any point x y b w its semi orbit eventually exits from b with xn for some positive integer n if this is not true then there exists some point x y b w such that hn b w for all n 0 since any point in b belongs to some h ki 1 i h this implies that there is a sequence of integer ni with ni ni 1 k 1 kn for each i such that p hni p hni 1 1 h x 1 h i since x 0 and ni which is a contradiction to the fact that all points are attracted to the compact set d thus for any point x y b w its semi orbit eventually exits from b with xn for some positive integer n combined with lemma a 1 we can conclude that for any point x that is close enough to c it will enter the compact neighborhood b of my and exit from b in some finite time therefore there exists some 0 such that for any initial condition x the
