papers on general relativity whereas the words highly relativistic or ultrarelativistic spin gravity coupling and highly rel ativistic spin gravity interaction are very rare in the cor responding literature does it means that there is not essential difference in the reaction of a spinning particle on the gravitational field when its velocity is 1 much less than the velocity of light and 2 very close to this velocity the main purpose of this paper is to answer this question in the context of this subject we recall paper 1 where the gravitational interaction of spin 1 2 particles was considered in the linear approximation an important result of this paper is that the gravitational interaction of two fermions increases with increasing energy like e 2 thus for protons when ep is of order 10 19 mp heremp is the proton mass the gravitational interaction becomes as strong as the electromagnetic one by comparison of the corresponding amplitudes of scattering 1 another direction of fermion gravity coupling investi gations is based on the general relativistic dirac equa tion which is known since 1929 2 the correspondent solutions of this equation in schwarzschild s and kerr s background are reflected in 3 different aspects of the covariant dirac equation and its solutions are presented in recent papers 4 there is a possibility to study the spin gravity cou pling in the classical nonquantum approach by the mathisson papapetrou mp equations 5 6 which de scribe motions of a spinning test body particle in a gravitational field according to general relativity it is important that in a certain sense the mp equations fol low from the general relativistic dirac equation as a clas sical approximation 7 see also some papers from 4 thus just the mp equations can be used to investigate some features of spin gravity coupling for fermions when their quantum properties are not important we stress that the possible role of the fermion s in teraction with gravity is often discussed in high energy physics and cosmology in particular in the focus of many investigations both theoretical and experimental high energy neutrinos in strong gravitational fields are studied here we point out only the most recent publica tions 8 9 which are especially interesting in the context of our paper the paper is organized as follows in sec ii the ba sic information on the mp equations is presented the concrete relationships which characterize the spin gravity coupling for a highly relativistic spinning particle in schwarzschild s field are considered in sec iii the situa tion when at the highly relativistic orbital velocity some restriction arises on using the supplementary condition for the mp equations in the schwarzschild background is analyzed in sec iv section v is devoted to the results following from the mp on possible highly relativistic or bits of a spinning particle both in linear and nonlinear spin approximation in schwarzschild s and kerr s back ground in sec vi we draw attention to the specificity of the description of highly relativistic fermions in a grav itational field by the general relativistic dirac equation we conclude in sec vii ii mathisson papapetrou equations these equations can be written as 5 6 d ds mu u ds ds 1 2 u s r 1 ds ds u u ds ds u u ds ds 0 2 where u dx ds is the particle s 4 velocity s is the tensor of spin m and d ds are respectively the mass and the covariant derivative along u and r is the riemann curvature tensor units c g 1 are used http arxiv org abs 1503 08415 v 1 2 here and in the following latin indices run 1 2 3 and greek indices 1 2 3 4 the signature of the metric is chosen after 5 6 eqs 1 and 2 were obtained in many papers by different approaches 10 11 it is necessary to add a supplementary condition to eqs 1 and 2 in order to choose an appropriate po sition of the particle s center of mass most often the conditions 5 12 s u 0 3 and 10 s p 0 4 are used where p mu u ds ds 5 is the particle 4 momentum both at conditions 3 and 4 the constant of motion of the mp equations is s 20 1 2 s s 6 where s 0 is the absolute value of spin often instead of eqs 1 and 2 their linear spin approximation is considered m d ds u 1 2 u s r 7 ds ds 0 8 in this approximation condition 4 coincides with 3 and m is the constant of motion for the exact mp equa tions m is the constant of motion only at condition 3 and under condition 4 the constant of motion is the value 2 p p we stress that just eqs 7 and 8 follow from the dirac equation by some procedure of reduction with the dirac matrices 4 to better understand the nature of the spin gravity coupling it is useful to consider the mp equations as written in the comoving tetrad representation 13 in particular it follows from 7 that i 4 4 s 1 m r 1 4 2 3 9 where are ricci s coefficients of rotation s 1 and r 1 4 2 3 are respectively the local tetrad com ponents of the particle s spin 4 vector and the local components of the riemann tensor here the first lo cal coordinate axis is orientated along the spin and indices of the tetrad are placed in parentheses we use the definition of ricci s coefficients as where are the orthogonal tetrads and notes the covariant derivative by definition s 1 2 g u s where s is 4 vector of spin in the global coordinates g and are the determinant of the metric tensor and the symbol levi civita respec tively it is important that ricci s coefficients of rotation i 4 4 have the direct physical meaning as the com ponents a i of the 3 accelerate of a spinning test particle relative to geodesic free fall as measured by the observer comoving with this particle therefore by eq 9 we have a i s 1 m r 1 4 2 3 10 it follows from eq 8 that i k 4 0 i e the known condition for the fermi transport in terms of the ricci coefficients of rotation iii spin gravity coupling at high velocity an example let us estimate the action of the spin gravity cou pling on a spinning particle moving with some velocity in schwarzschild s background for this purpose we take into account the expressions for different components of the gravitational field of a moving schwarzschild source namely following 14 we use the general definition of the gravitoelectric e i k and gravitomagnetic b i k com ponents of the gravitational field as e i k r i 4 k 4 11 b i k 1 2 r i 4 m n m n k 12 note that in the context of the analysis of the mp equa tions another definition of the gravitoelectric and grav itomagnetic fields as the corresponding 3 vector values with world indices is effectively used in 4 according to 10 and 12 from the point of view of the observer which is comoving with the spinning particle we have a i s 1 m b 1 i 13 in the concrete case of schwarzschild s mass when the first space local vector is orthogonal to the plane that is determined by the instantaneous direction of the observer motion relative to the mass and the radial direction and the second vector is directed along the direction of the motion of the observer there are the expressions for the nonzero components of the gravitomagnetic field 15 b 1 2 b 2 1 3 mu u r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r 1 2 14 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 mu 2 u 4 r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r 1 2 15 3 where u dr ds and u rd ds are the radial and tangential components of the observer s 4 velocity and m is schwarzschild s mass the standard schwarzschild coordinates are used let us analyze expressions 14 and 15 at different ve locities of the observer relative to schwarzschild s mass note that the gravitomagnetic components are nonzero only at u 6 0 then it is easy to see that the compo nents 14 and 15 significantly depend on the velocity of an observer relative to the schwarzschild mass in deed at u 1 u 1 the common term 3 m r 3 in expressions 14 and 15 is multiplied on the corre sponding small values whereas in the highly relativistic case for u 1 this term is multiplied by the large as compare to 1 values and then b 1 2 b 2 1 3 m r 3 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 m r 3 2 16 where is the relativistic lorentz factor as calculated by the particle velocity relative to the schwarzschild mass 15 the acceleration components 13 depend in the case of highly relativistic nonradial motions on such that a 2 a 3 2 the component a 1 remains equal to zero at any velocity the absolute value of the 3 acceleration is proportional to 2 so according to the mp equations from the point of view of the observer comoving with a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background the spin gravity interac tion is much greater at the highly relativistic particle s velocity than at the low velocity this interaction has the clear feature of the spin orbit interaction however it is interesting to estimate the effects of this interaction for another observer e g which is at rest relative to the schwarzschild mass another approach to describe the case of a relativistic spinning particle in the schwarzschild field is developed in 16 where in particular the dependence of the spin gravity interaction on the particle energy is considered in the next section we stress that the value of the spin ning particle velocity relative to the source of the grav itational field is important in choosing an appropriate supplementary condition iv on adequate supplementary condition for highly relativistic particle motions another example of the spinning particle motions in schwarzschild s background shows that in the highly rel ativistic regime some restriction arises on using supple mentary condition 4 indeed for the equatorial motions with 2 in the standard schwarzschild coordinates of a spinning particle it follows from exact mp equations 1 and 2 under condition 4 that the relationships take place 17 p r urr 1 2 2 m r p u r 1 2 m r p t utr 1 2 2 m r 17 where r 1 2 2 m r 2 3 u 2 2 mr 2 2 m r 1 2 18 and s 0 m 19 for the equatorial motions p 0 and u 0 the constant is the rest mass of the particle and as a re sult of the test condition for the spinning particle it is necessary 1 18 relations 18 and 19 illustrate that in the linear spin approximation the momentum p is parallel to the velocity u an important result follows from 17 and 18 due to the terms with 2 indeed if u r 6 m 20 where u ru is the particle s tangential velocity in 18 we have the square root of the negative value it means that according to 17 and 18 under condition 20 the expressions for the components of 4 momentum p become imaginary for the real mass a result which is not acceptable from the physical point of view more over for the value m which by 5 is equal to p u according to 17 we have m r 1 2 2 m r 3 u 2 2 m r 21 it follows from 21 that when condition 20 is satis fied and r is imaginary the value m becomes imaginary as well however then according to 5 in the left hand part of this relationship we have the pure imaginary value and in the right hand part there is the sum of the imag inary value mu and the second real term the value u ds ds is real because by definition and its physical meaning the real value is s therefore we conclude that in the case of condition 4 when relationship 20 takes place from the exact mathisson papapetrou equa tions follows the result which is not satisfactory from the physical point of view 4 the important feature of relationship 20 is that the orbital velocity value must be highly relativistic for all values of the radial coordinate beyond the horizon sur face because here 1 in particular if r is not much greater than m the velocity value of the right hand side of eqn 20 corresponds to the particle s highly relativis tic lorentz factor of order 1 it means that supple mentary condition 4 cannot be used for the particle s velocity which is very close to the velocity of light in this context we stress that according to relationship 20 an unexpected conclusion which is discussed in 19 be comes clear namely in 19 it is shown that the mp equations at condition 4 have solutions which allow ac celeration of a spinning particle to the superluminal ve locity in schwarzschild s background note that under condition 3 the corresponding result is not allowed by the mp equations thus in the linear spin approximation one can use the supplementary condition for the mp equations in form 3 or 4 however when the nonlinear spin terms are taken into account and the particle velocity is so high as in 20 then the acceptable condition is only 3 v effects of highly relativistic spin gravity coupling on particle trajectories so in secs iii and iv above we considered two differ ent situations which demonstrate the specific features of a spinning particle motion in the highly relativistic regime according to the mp equations now we briefly analyze how this regime reflects in the particle s trajectory a linear spin approximation here we discuss results following from the mp equa tions in the linear spin approximation for the highly rela tivistic motions in the concrete metrics which is common for conditions 3 and 4 first we point out the circular highly relativistic or bits of a spinning particle which are allowed by the mp equations in the equatorial plane of the schwarzschild source with the spin orthogonal to this plane these orbits exists in the small neighborhood of the radial co ordinate value r 1 5 rg 1 where rg is the horizon radius 1 and it is allowed to be positive nega tive or zero 20 for comparison the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinless particle are allowed by the geodesic equation only for 0 3 for realization of these orbits the spinning particle must possess the or bital velocity which corresponds to the lorentz factor of order 1 and this velocity is highly relativistic in the sense that 2 1 because of 1 the similar highly relativistic circular orbits exist in the equatorial plane of kerr s source for the radial coordinate values r r ph 1 where r ph is the boyer lindquist radial coordinate of the counterrotating circular photon orbits 21 all these circular orbits are caused by the strong attractive action of the spin gravity coupling in addition to the geodesic attraction moreover if the initial value of the spinning particle velocity slightly differs from the corresponding value for these highly relativistic circular orbits for example due to some nonzero value of the particle s radial velocity the corresponding noncircular orbits illustrate the situations when for the short time of the spinning particle motion relative to schwarzschild s or kerr s mass the space deviation of this particle trajec tory from the geodesic one becomes significant 22 23 b nonlinear effects according to the exact mp equations at condition 3 the nonlinear spin terms become important in many situations with a fast moving spinning particle in schwarzschild s or kerr s metric 22 23 for example in contrast to the cases of the linear spin approximation when the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle exist in the narrow space regions only due to the nonlinear terms the corresponding domains are much wider in particular by the exact mp equations the highly relativistic equatorial circular orbits of a spinning par ticle in kerr s background are allowed not only for r r ph 1 with 1 but for any r r ph up to r r ph however in the last case the necessary value of the lorentz factor is much greater than for example in the case for r r ph all these orbits similarly to the corresponding orbits following from the mp equations in the linear spin approximation are caused by the strong attractive action of the spin gravity coupling due to the strong repulsive action of the spin gravity coupling on the particle there are the highly relativis tic circular orbits of a spinning particle in the space re gion with r r ph 23 in the equatorial plane of the kerr background in addition the same repulsive force gives the significantly nongeodesic circular orbits of a spinning particle beyond the equatorial planes in the schwarzschild and kerr backgrounds 24 c numerical estimates do some particles in cosmic rays possess the sufficiently high factor for motions on the highly relativistic circu lar orbits or on some their fragments in the gravitational field of the schwarzschild or kerr black hole which are considered above yes they do by the numerical esti mates for an electron in the gravitational field of a black hole with three of the sun s mass the value 0 is equal 4 10 17 then the necessary value of the factor for the realization of some highly relativistic circular orbits by the electron near this black hole is of order 108 this 5 factor corresponds to the energy of the electron free motion of order 1014 ev analogously for a proton in the field of such a black hole the corresponding energy is of order 1018 ev for the massive black hole those val ues are greater for example if m is equal to 106 of the sun s mass the corresponding value of the energy for an electron is of order 1017 ev and for a proton it is 1021 ev naturally far from the black hole these values are greater because the necessary factor is proportional to r note that for a neutrino near the black hole with three of the sun s mass the necessary values of its factor for motions on the highly relativistic circular orbits corre spond to the neutrino s energy of the free motion of or der 105 ev if the black hole s mass is of order 106 of the sun s mass the corresponding value is of order 108 ev can the highly relativistic spin gravity effects be reg istered by the observation of the electromagnetic syn chrotron radiation from some black holes perhaps how ever it is difficult to differ the situation when the circular orbits of a spinning charged particle and its synchrotron radiation are caused by the magnetic field or the spin gravity coupling the detailed analysis of the observa tional data is necessary vi on quantum equation for highly relativistic fermions in a gravitational field naturally a more appropriate description of the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling for electrons and other fermions cannot be restricted by the mp equations and it is necessary to analyze the corresponding quantum equa tions as an example in this context we point out pa per 15 where the solution of the dirac equation in a schwarzschild field which describes the quantum state corresponding to the classical highly relativistic orbit with r 1 5 rg is considered however in general the situation with the dirac equation is not so simple indeed it is shown in many papers that in the lin ear spin approximation the mp equations follow from the general relativistic dirac equation as some classical approximation here we draw attention to the fact that the exact mp equations i e their nonlinear spin terms cannot be obtained from this dirac equation in principle why to answer this question we recall that the main step in obtaining the general relativistic dirac equation in the curved spacetime consists in introduction the notion of the parallel transport for spinors as a generalization of this notion for tensors whereas according to the mp equations the spin of a test particle is transported by fermi ds ds u du ds s 22 it follows from 22 that only in the linear spin approx imation the fermi transport coincides with the parallel transport therefore to satisfy the principle of corre spondence between the dirac equation and the exact mp equations at first sight it is necessary simply to intro duce and use the fermi transport for spinors in some cor rected dirac equation however it is impossible without the lorentz invariance violation in this context we note that many papers are devoted to the violation of lorentz invariance from different points of view for example in the context of the standard model extension 8 9 and probably the key words lorentz violating spinor first ap peared only recently 9 one can hope that just in the framework of this approach the necessary corrected dirac equation will be obtained some preliminary estimates show that the correspondent equation must be nonlin ear in function 25 note from another position and in another context some modified dirac equation with lorentz invariance violation was proposed in 26 in any case further investigations in this direction are nec essary vii conclusions concerning the question from the first paragraph in the introduction of this paper we conclude there is the significant difference in the motions of a spinning particle with low and very high velocities relative to the source of a gravitational field this result follows from the solu tions of the mp equations in schwarzschild s and kerr s metric both under conditions 3 and 4 both in the lin ear and nonlinear spin consideration the force which de viates the motion of a spinning particle from the geodesic free fall trajectory is proportional to the second power of the relativistic lorentz factor by the estimation of an observer comoving with this particle it is important that the results presented in sec iv indicate the limit of validity of condition 4 for the high orbital particle velocity in sense 20 this condition is not adequate from the physical point of view probably the mp equations can play an important heuristic role in finding some corrections to the general relativistic dirac equation for a more adequate descrip tion of highly relativistic fermions in a gravitational field 1 i yu kobzarev and l b okun sov phys jetp 16 1343 1963 2 v fock and d ivanenko z
