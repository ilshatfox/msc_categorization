resolution of two fundamental issues in the dynamics of relativity and exposure of a real version of the emperor s new clothes changbiao wang shanggang group 10 dover road north haven ct 06473 usa in this paper we aim to resolve two fundamental issues in the dynamics of relativity i under what condition the time column space integrals of a lorentz four tensor constitute a lorentz four vector and ii under what condition the time element space integral of a lorentz four vector is a lorentz scalar namely two conservation laws which are mispresented in traditional textbooks and widely used in fundamental research such as relativistic analysis of the momentum of light in a medium and the proofs of the positive mass theorem in general relativity to resolve issue i we have developed a generalized lorentz four vector theorem based on the principles of classical mathematical analysis with a simplified analytic example given to illustrate how to transform a space integral from one inertial frame to another and a strict mathematical derivation provided to confirm the effect of lorentz contraction we use this four vector theorem to verify m ller s theo rem and surprisingly find that m ller s theorem is fundamentally wrong we provide a corrected version of m ller s theorem we also use this four vector theorem to analyze a plane light wave in a moving uniform medium and find that the momentum and energy of minkowski quasi photon constitute a lorentz four vector and planck constant is a lorentz invariant to resolve issue ii we have developed a generalized lorentz scalar theorem we use this theorem to verify the invariant conservation law in relativistic electrodynamics and unexpectedly find that it is also fundamentally wrong thus the two conservation laws in traditional textbooks which have magically attracted several generations of most outstanding scientists turned out to be imaginary just like the em peror s new clothes creating a scientific myth in the modern theoretical and mathematical physics believing is seeing pacs numbers 03 30 p 03 50 de 04 20 q 11 30 j keywords conservation laws of relativity light momentum positive mass theorem gordon metric i introduction in the dynamics of relativity the energy and momen tum of a physical system is described by a lorentz four tensor such a tensor is usually called energy momentum tensor 1 3 stress tensor 4 stress energy tensor 5 6 or momentum energy stress tensor 7 if the tensor is divergence less then the system is thought to be con served 1 3 and it is a closed system 3 thus the total energy and momentum can be obtained by carrying out space integration of the time column elements of the ten sor to constitute a lorentz four vector 1 5 8 11 mathematically speaking if a tensor satisfies certain conditions the space integrals of the tensor s time column elements can form a lorentz four vector for the sake of convenience we call such a mathematical state ment four vector theorem laue set up a four vector theorem for a tensor that is required to be time independent 12 laue s theorem only provides a sufficient condition instead of a sufficient and necessary condition and it cannot be used to judge the lorentz property of the energy and momentum of electrostatic fields in a recent study laue s theorem is improved to be a theorem that has a sufficient and nec essary condition and it is successfully used to generally electronic address changbiao wang yahoo com resolve the electrostatic field problem 6 in contrast to laue s theorem m ller provided a four vector theorem for a tensor that is required to be divergence less with a boundary condition imposed but allowed to be time dependent 3 m ller s theorem only has a sufficient condition instead of a sufficient and nec essary condition 13 but it is more attractive because the energy momentum tensor for electromagnetic em radiation fields varies with time 8 11 it is widely rec ognized in the community that m ller s theorem is abso lutely rigorous so that this theorem has been widely used in quantum electrodynamics 8 and relativistic analysis of light momentum in a dielectric medium 9 11 in this paper we provide a generalized lorentz four vector theorem for a tensor which is not required to be time independent and divergence less and on which no boundary conditions are imposed this theorem has a sufficient and necessary condition we use this theo rem to verify m ller s theorem surprisingly finding that m ller s theorem is fundamentally wrong like the four vector theorem a lorentz scalar theo rem is a mathematical statement that under what con ditions the time element space integral of a four vector is a lorentz scalar in ref 6 a scalar theorem for a four vector that is required to be time independent is set up called derivative von laue s theorem and it is suc cessfully used to strictly resolve the invariance problem of total electric charge in relativistic

changbiao wang yahoo com 2 be time independent and divergence less and on which no boundary conditions are imposed this theorem has a sufficient and necessary condition we use this scalar theorem to identify the validity of a well known result in the dynamics of relativity that if a lorentz four vector is divergence less then the time element space integral of the four vector is a lorentz scalar 3 p 168 namely the invariant conservation law claimed by weinberg 2 p 41 we unexpectedly find that this widely accepted result is also fundamentally wrong the paper is organized as follows in sec ii proofs are given of lorentz four vector and scalar theorems based on the principles of classical mathematical analysis with a simplified analytic example given to illustrate how to transform a space integral from one inertial frame to an other and a strict mathematical derivation provided to confirm the effect of lorentz contraction in sec iii m ller s theorem is proved to be incorrect and a cor rected version of m ller s theorem is provided in sec iv the invariant conservation law in relativistic electrody namics is proved to be invalid namely the current con tinuity equation j t 0 cannot be taken as the charge conservation law in relativity in sec v some remarks and conclusions are given in appendix a it is demonstrated why the hyperplane differential element four vector introduced to transform space integrals be tween lorentz inertial frames in textbooks contradicts the principles of mathematical analysis and the princi ple of relativity in appendix b as an application of theorem 1 to minkowski tensor for a plane light wave in a moving uniform medium the momentum energy four vector of the quasi photon and the lorentz invariance of planck constant are naturally derived in appendix c physical counterexamples of thirring s claims are pro vided in appendix d an illustration is given of why the proofs of the positive mass theorem in general rela tivity are based on a flawed theoretical framework in appendix e the covariance of gordon optical metric is questioned ii lorentz four vector theorems and scalar theorem in this section proofs are given of lorentz four vector and scalar theorems and a simplified analytic example is provided to illustrate how to transform a space inte gral from one inertial frame to another and to explain why under time space lorentz transformation the effect of lorentz contraction namely the relativistic effect of lengths of a rigid rod argued by einstein according to the principle of relativity 20 is strictly supported by the principles of classical mathematical analysis four vector theorems provide a criterion to judge un der what condition the space integrals of the time column elements of a tensor constitute a lorentz four vector theorem 1 and under what condition the space inte grals of the time row elements of a tensor constitute a lorentz four vector theorem 2 while the scalar theo rem provides a criterion to judge under what condition the space integral of the time element of a four vector is a lorentz scalar theorem 3 the proofs of theorem 1 and theorem 2 are very similar and without loss of generality only the proof of theorem 1 is given suppose that an inertial frame of x y z moves uni formly at c relatively to the laboratory frame xy z where c is the vacuum light speed the lorentz trans formation of time space four vector x x ct is given by 6 7 x x x ct 1 ct ct x 2 or conversely given by x x x ct 3 ct ct x 4 where 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 and note x g x x ct with g g diag 1 1 1 1 the minkowski metric according to the definition of tensors 3 p 108 if x t is a lorentz four tensor given in xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 correspond ing to time component then in x y z the tensor x x x t t t x t is obtained through double lorentz transformation of x t given by x t x x x x x t 5 x x x t t t x t x x x x x x x t t t x t 6 where x x and x x are obtained from lorentz transformation eqs 1 and 2 while x x x t and t t x t denote lorentz transformation eqs 3 and 4 respectively eq 5 is the expression of observed in xy z and eq 6 is the expression of observed in x y z theorem 1 suppose that x t is an integrable lorentz four tensor defined in the domain v in the lab oratory frame xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 corresponding to time component and v includ ing its boundary is at rest in xy z namely any x v is independent of t the space integrals of the time column elements of the tensor in xy z are defined as p v t const 4 x t d 3 x 7 the space integrals of time column elements of the tensor in x y z are defined as p v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x 8 3 where 4 x x x t t x x x 4 x x x x t t 9 the four vector theorem states p is a lorentz four vector if and only if v t const j x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 10 holds there are a few main points to understand theorem 1 that should be noted as follows i the importance of the definition eq 9 should be emphasized otherwise the implication of p 4 d 3 x is ambiguous and we cannot set up the trans formation between p and p in eq 9 the space variables x in x t are replaced by x x x t namely the space lorentz transformation eq 3 while t in x t is kept as it is note that in eq 7 for the definition of p the integration variables x x y z are independent of t because the domain v is fixed in xy z which is the mathematical reason why x in x t in eq 9 should be replaced by x x x t eq 3 in stead of x f x t derived from x x x t given by eq 1 where x are also functions of t in addition to x ii observed in xy z like p p is only depen dent on t in general confer eq 16 the quantity t in the integrand 4 x x x t t of p p t v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x is introduced as a constant parameter in the space integral transform from xy z to x y z and thus observed in x y z the boundary of v is moving so that p p t does not contain t iii if x t is independent of t then both p and p are independent of t namely they are constants iv the symmetry and divergence less 0 are not required and there are no boundary conditions imposed on x t analytical example in order to better understand i and ii let us take a simple one dimensional example to illustrate how to transform the space integral from one lorentz inertial frame to another according to the principles of classical mathematical analysis 14 suppose that x y z moves at c with respect to xy z along the positive x direction in such a case the space lorentz transformations eqs 1 and 3 are re spectively simplified into x x ct y y z z for eq 1 x x ct y y z z for eq 3 consider the space integral transform from xy z to x y z given by i t b a cos x ct dx x b b ct x a a ct cos x ct ct dx sin b ct sin a ct where the integration region a b is fixed in xy z and any x a b is independent of t while observed in x y z according to the principle of relativity the cor responding integration region x a x b must move at c along the minus x direction in the above integral transform a key problem to be solved is to determine which lorentz transformation should be taken eq 1 or eq 3 as shown below a why eq 3 is taken from b a cos x ct dx in xy z to x b x a cos x ct ct dx in x y z x in b a cos x ct dx must be replaced by x x ct eq 3 instead of x x ct derived from x x ct eq 1 because the proper integration region a x b is fixed in xy z and the region boundaries x a and x b are independent of t while x x ct derived from x x ct eq 1 is a function of t in addition to x b differential element transformation according to a which is a strict mathematical rule the differ ential element transformation must be calculated from x x ct eq 3 with t taken as a constant parameter leading to dx dx where the jacobian determinant x x x x is taken into account c motion of region observed in x y z the integra tion region is given by x a x x b and the region boundaries x a a ct and x b b ct are moving at a velocity of c along the minus x or x direction so that the integral does not contain t although the integrand cos x ct ct contains t d effect of lorentz contraction the expressions of integration region boundaries x a a ct x b b ct are governed by the mathematical rule a suggest ing that x a and x b must be measured at the same 4 time t physically except for the case with c 0 x y z coincides with xy z and x a a and x b b are independent of the times when they are measured respectively thus the effect of lorentz contraction or the relativistic effect of lengths of a rigid rod defined by b a dx x b x a dx x b x a dx x b x a b a is a strict and natural result from the principles of mathematical analysis where b a dx is the proper length of the rod and x b x a dx is exactly the length of the moving rod defined by einstein because x a and x b in x b x a dx are the points at which the two ends of the moving rod to be measured are located at a definite time at the same time t 20 theorem 2 suppose that x t is an integrable lorentz four tensor defined in the domain v in the lab oratory frame xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 corresponding to time component and v includ ing its boundary is at rest in xy z namely any x v is independent of t the space integrals of the time row elements of the tensor in xy z are defined as v t const 4 x t d 3 x 11 the space integrals of time row elements of the tensor in x y z are defined as v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x 12 where 4 x x x t t x 4 x x x x x x t t 13 the four vector theorem states is a lorentz four vector if and only if v t const i x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and i 1 2 3 14 holds proof of theorem 1 from eqs 8 and 9 we have p v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x x x x 4 x v t t const x x x t t d 3 x 15 note that x x x t in x x x t t denotes eq 3 by the change of variables x x t x or x y z t x y z with t as a constant parameter from above eq 15 we obtain p x x x 4 x 1 v t const x t d 3 x 16 where d 3 x x y z x y z d 3 x d 3 x is employed with the jacobian determinant x y z x y z being explained as the effect of lorentz contraction physically confer appendix a since t is introduced as a constant parameter in the change of variables p is independent of t from eq 16 with x 4 x 4 and the definition given by eq 7 p v t const 4 x t d 3 x taken into account we have p x x x 4 xj 1 v t const j x t d 3 x x x x 4 x 4 1 v t const 4 x t d 3 x x x x 4 xj 1 v t const j x t d 3 x x x v t const 4 x t d 3 x x x x 4 xj 1 v t const j x t d 3 x x x p with j 1 2 3 17 if p is a lorentz four vector then p x x p 18 must hold inserting eq 18 into eq 17 we have x x x 4 xj 1 v t const j x t d 3 x 0 19 where x x is the lorentz transformation matrix with its determinant det x x 1 4 p 544 with both sides of above eq 19 multiplied by from eq 1 we have 1 2 x x y x z x y x 1 2 y y z y z x z y 1 2 z z x y z a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 41 a 42 a 43 x y z 0 0 0 0 20 5 where a j v t const j x t d 3 x with 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 from above it is seen that eq 20 eq 18 through eq 17 is valid thus for p to be a lorentz four vector the sufficient and necessary condition is given by a j v t const j x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 21 the sufficiency of eq 21 is apparent because we directly have eq 21 eq 20 eq 19 eq 18 from eq 17 the necessity is based on the fact that a four vector must follow lorentz rule between any two inertial frames namely c is arbitrary and thus a j 0 must hold for all and j be cause x 6 0 y 0 z 0 a 1 0 x 0 y 6 0 z 0 a 2 0 and x 0 y 0 z 6 0 a 3 0 thus we finish the proof of the sufficiency and necessity theorem 3 suppose that x t 4 is an in tegrable lorentz four vector defined in the domain v in the laboratory frame xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 corresponding to time component and v including its boundary is at rest in xy z namely any x v is independent of t the lorentz scalar theorem states the time element space integral v t const 4 x t d 3 x 22 is a lorentz scalar if and only if v t const i x t d 3 x 0 for i 1 2 3 or v t const x t d 3 x 0 23 holds proof corresponding to v t const 4 x t d 3 x given by eq 22 we first have to define 4 d 3 x in x y z because the implication of 4 d 3 x it self is ambiguous before the dependence of 4 on x t and t is defined for this end from lorentz transforma tion we have 4 x t x 4 x x t 4 x x x t t x 4 x x x x t t 24 where the space variables x in x t are replaced by x x x t namely the space lorentz transformation eq 3 but t in x t is kept as it is making integration in eq 24 with respect to x y z over v in the laboratory frame we have v t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x x 4 x v t const x x x t t d 3 x 25 by the change of variables x y z x y z t with t as a constant parameter in the left hand side of eq 25 while keeping the integrals of the right hand side to be computed in xy z frame we obtain v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x x 4 x v t const x t d 3 x 26 where d 3 x x y z x y z d 3 x d 3 x is taken into account with x y z x y z the jaco bian determinant we define v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x 27 where 4 x x x t t is defined in eq 24 since t is introduced as a constant parameter in the change of variables in the space integral does not contain t although the integrand 4 x x x t t in eq 27 contains t thus with the both sides of eq 26 divided by and then eq 27 inserted we have v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x x 4 x 1 v t const x t d 3 x x 4 x 4 1 v t const 4 x t d 3 x x 4 xi 1 v t const i x t d 3 x with i 1 2 3 v t const x t d 3 x 28 6 where x 4 x 4 x 4 xi i and the definition v t const 4 x t d 3 x given by eq 22 are employed from eq 28 we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for lorentz scalar given by v t const i x t d 3 x 0 for i 1 2 3 or v t const x t d 3 x 0 29 the sufficiency is apparent while the necessity comes from the fact that is arbitrary thus we complete the proof there are some main points to understand theorem 3 that should be noted i if x t is independent of t namely t 0 then both and are constants ii the divergence less 0 is not required and there are no boundary conditions imposed on x t iii asymmetry arising from resting v and moving v directly from eq 2 we have 4 4 v 4 d 3 x v 4 d 3 x v d 3 x with d 3 x d 3 x used namely eq 28 conversely from eq 4 we have 4 4 v 4 d 3 x v 4 d 3 x 2 2 v d 3 x with d 3 x d 3 x used we find that v d 3 x and 2 2 v d 3 x are not symmetric although 4 4 and 4 4 are symmetric this asymmetry comes from the fact that v is fixed in xy z while v is moving in x y z iii invalidity of m ller s theorem in this section i m ller s theorem is proved to be incorrect ii based on theorem 1 a counterexample of m ller s theorem is given and iii a corrected version of m ller s theorem is provided with a detailed elucidation given of why the corrected m ller s theorem only defines a trivial zero four vector for em stress energy tensor m ller s theorem suppose that x t is an inte grable lorentz four tensor defined in the domain v in the laboratory frame xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 corresponding to time component and v including its boundary is at rest in xy z namely any x v is independent of t all the elements of the tensor have first order partial derivatives with respect to time space coordinates x x ct m ller s theorem states if x t is divergence less x t 0 and x t 0 holds on the boundary of v for any time t zero boundary condition then the time column space integrals p v t const 4 x t d 3 x 30 constitute a lorentz four vector 3 pp 166 169 proof from m ller s sufficient condition we first demonstrate that the time column space integrals given by eq 30 are time independent p t 0 then we prove that the sufficient condition is not enough to make eq 30 be a four vector and we conclude that m ller s theorem is incorrect since x t 0 holds on the boundary of v using 3 dimensional gauss s divergence theorem we obtain v t const i i x t d 3 x 0 with i 1 2 3 31 because the boundary of v is at rest in the laboratory frame we have v t const t d 3 x t v t const d 3 x 32 from x t 0 with eq 31 eq 32 and x 4 7 ct taken into account we have 0 v t const x t d 3 x v t const i i x t d 3 x v t const 4 4 x t d 3 x v t const 4 4 x t d 3 x ct v t const 4 x t d 3 x 33 inserting eq 30 into above eq 33 yields p t t v t const 4 x t d 3 x 0 34 thus p v t const 4 x t d 3 x is constant although the integrand 4 x t may depend on t however it should be emphasized that t v t const j x t d 3 x 0 for j 1 2 3 may not hold 35 from the divergence less 0 and the zero boundary condition 0 on boundary we have achieved a conclusion that the time column space inte grals p v t const 4 x t d 3 x are time independent constants in what follows we will show that the divergence less and the zero boundary condition is not sufficient to make p be a four vector in other words m ller s sufficient condition is not sufficient from eqs 15 17 in the proof of theorem 1 we have p v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x x x x 4 x 1 v t const x t d 3 x x x x 4 xj 1 v t const j x t d 3 x allowed to be t dependent x x p with j 1 2 3 36 t independent thus like eq 17 we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for constant p to be a lorentz four vector given below a j v t const j x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 37 which is the same as eq 10 however m ller s suf ficient condition does not include this sufficient and necessary condition and accordingly m ller s theorem is fundamentally wrong thus we finish the proof counterexample of m ller s theorem to further convince readers given below is a pure mathematical counterex ample to disprove m ller s theorem based on theorem 1 as indicated in sec v later this counterexample of m ller s theorem is also the counterexample of landau lifshitz and weinberg s versions of laue s theorem 6 suppose that there is a symmetric lorentz four tensor a 0 0 0 f x 0 0 0 f x 0 0 0 f x f x f x f x ct fx fy fz 38 defined in the cubic domain v x y z where f x sinx 2 sin y 2 sin z 2 is independent of time with v f x d 3 x 3 and fx f x fy f y and fz f z a is divergence less a 0 a 0 because of a a and satisfies the m ller s zero boundary condition a 0 holds on the boundary x y z for t thus a satisfies the sufficient condition of m ller s theorem and m v t const a 4 d 3 x 3 3 3 0 39 is supposed to be a lorentz four vector however because v t const a 41 d 3 x v t const a 42 d 3 x v t const a 43 d 3 x 3 6 0 40 a does not satisfy the sufficient and necessary condition eq 10 of theorem 1 and accordingly m v t const a 4 d 3 x is not a four vector thus m ller s theorem is disproved by this counterexample based on theorem 1 8 the above counterexample shows that the sufficient condition of m ller s theorem indeed does not includes the sufficient and necessary condition eq 10 of the orem 1 obviously m ller s theorem can be easily corrected by adding the condition eq 10 as follows corrected m ller s theorem suppose that x t is an integrable lorentz four tensor defined in the do main v in the laboratory frame xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 corresponding to time com ponent and v including its boundary is at rest in xy z namely any x v is independent of t it is assumed that x t is divergence less x t 0 and x t 0 holds on the boundary of v for any time t zero boundary condition the cor rected m ller s theorem states the time column space integrals p v t const 4 x t d 3 x 41 constitute a lorentz four vector if and only if v t const j x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 42 holds however we would like to indicate by enumerating specific examples as follows that the corrected m ller s theorem has a limited application example 1 for corrected m ller s theorem consider minkowski em stress energy tensor for a pure radia tion field in matter 10 given by t t t with t t m cga cgm wem 43 where t is the transpose of t with t t t m gm t cga wem ct ga e h c 2 is the abraham momentum gm d b is the minkowski momentum wem 0 5 d e b h is the em energy density and t m de bh i 0 5 d e b h is the minkowski stress tensor with i the unit tensor 6 we first assume that the corrected m ller s theorem is applicable for this em tensor then let us see what conclusion we can get the pre assumption of corrected m ller s theorem is the tensor s divergence less plus a zero boundary condi tion the zero boundary condition requires that all the tensor elements be equal to zero on the boundary for any time t thus for the em stress energy tensor given by eq 43 the pre assumption re quires t 0 holding within the finite domain v of a physical system and poynting vector e h 0 and minkowski momentum d b 0 holding on the boundary of v for any time t physically the pre assumption is extremely strong and severe because it requires that i within the domain v there are no any sources t 0 and ii the em energy and minkowski momentum never flow through the closed boundary of v for any time e h 0 and d b 0 for t thus this physical system is never provided with any em energy and mo mentum according to energy momentum conservation law no em fields can be supported within the domain v in such a case leading to a zero field solution thus the corrected m ller s theorem only defines a trivial zero four vector for an em stress energy tensor of a finite closed physical system even if this theorem is applicable example 2 for corrected m ller s theorem nevertheless the corrected m ller s theorem may define a non zero four vector in general as an example consider the ten sor given by b x t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 f x 44 defined in the cubic domain v x y z where f x sinx 2 sin y 2 sin z 2 with v f x d 3 x 3 b x t is divergence less b 0 and satisfies the zero boundary condition b x t 0 on the boundary x y z for t thus the pre assumption of corrected m ller s theorem is satis fied on the other hand v t const b j x t d 3 x 0 holds for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 thus b x t also satisfies the sufficient and necessary condition eq 42 for the corrected m ller s theorem accord ingly v t const b 4 x t d 3 x 0 0 0 3 6 0 is a four vector the corrected m ller s theorem may define a non zero four vector in general conclusion for corrected m ller s theorem in con clusion the corrected m ller s theorem may define a non zero four vector in general however it only defines a trivial zero four vector for an em stress energy tensor of a finite closed physical system thus the application of the theorem is limited differences between three four vector theorems we have three four vector theorems theorem 1 and corrected m ller s theorem both presented in the present paper and generalized von laue s theorem presented in ref 6 for the convenience to compare we write down the generalized von laue s theorem from ref 6 as follows generalized von laue s theorem assume that x is an integrable lorentz four tensor defined in the domain v in the laboratory frame xy z where 1 2 3 and 4 with the index 4 corresponding to time component v including its boundary is at rest in xy z and is independent of time t 0 the 9 generalized von laue s theorem states the time column element space integrals p v 4 x d 3 x constitute a lorentz four vector if and only if v j x d 3 x 0 holds for all 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 between the corrected m ller s theorem and the above generalized von laue s theorem the difference is that in the corrected m ller s theorem the divergence less 0 plus a zero boundary condition 0 on boundary is taken as a pre assumption and x t is allowed to be time dependent while in the generalized von laue s theorem t 0 is taken as a pre assumption and x t x is not allowed to be time dependent but no boundary condition is required compared with the corrected m ller s theorem and the generalized von laue s theorem theorem 1 does not have any pre assumption however the three theorems have the same definition p as shown below from eq 36 we know that the same definition of p is used in both theorem 1 and the corrected m ller s theorem given by p v t t const 4 x x x t t d 3 x x x x 4 x 1 v t const x t d 3 x 45 if x t is independent of t namely x t x then the above eq 45 becomes p v t t const 4 x x x t d 3 x x x x 4 x 1 v t const x d 3 x 46 this is exactly the case of von laue s theorem presented in ref 6 where 4 x x x t is written as 4 x ct and t does not show up adaptability of theorem 1 since theorem 1 does not have a pre assumption it may have a better adaptability to show this a specific example is given below suppose that there is a symmetric lorentz four tensor r x t 0 0 0 x 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 x 0 0 ct 47 defined in the cubic domain v x y z with its boundary s x y z from eq 47 we know that i r 0 holds but r x t does not have a zero boundary condition r 41 x t 6 0 on the boundary x and y z for example thus the cor rected m ller s theorem does not apply ii r t 0 does not hold because of r 44 t c 6 0 thus the generalized von laue s theorem does not apply either iii v t const r j x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 holds satisfying the sufficient and nec essary condition eq 10 of theorem 1 thus n v t const r 4 x t d 3 x v t const x 0 0 ct d 3 x 0 0 0 8 3 ct is a lorentz four vector from above example we see that theorem 1 has a bet ter adaptability it is interesting to indicate that theo rem 1 can be used to analyze the em stress energy tensor for a plane light wave in a dielectric medium as shown in appendix b iv invalidity of weinberg s claim in relativistic electrodynamics there are two main stream arguments for the lorentz invariance of total elec tric charge one of them comes from an assumption that the total electric charge is an experimental invariant as presented in the textbook by jackson 4 p 555 the other comes from a well accepted invariant conservation law that the divergence less of current density four vector makes the total charge be a lorentz scalar as claimed in the textbook by weinberg 2 p 41 in this section by enumerating a counterexample we use theorem 3 to disprove weinberg s claim for a physical system defined in the domain v with s as its closed boundary we will show that the divergence less j 0 of current density four vector j j c plus a boundary zero integral given by s j x t ds 0 makes the total charge q in v be a time independent constant however it is not enough to make the constant be a lorentz scalar constant of total electric charge from j 0 j t 0 with q v d 3 x taken into account 21 p 461 we have s j x t ds dq dt 0 where the exchangeability between t and v is employed so that v t d 3 x dq dt holds as usually presented in textbooks 2 p 20 41 p 345 if s j x t ds 0 holds then we have dq dt 0 q const phys ically the current density j u is a charge den sity flow where u is the charge moving velocity and s j x t ds 0 means that there is no net charge flowing into or out of v thus the total electric charge q in v is constant however it never means that this con stant is a lorentz invariant it is should be emphasized that only from j 0 without s j x t ds 0 considered one cannot derive q const in v why is the constant total charge q in v in above 10 resulting from j 0 j t not a lorentz invariant that is because q in v in frame xy z and q in v in frame x y z do not refer to the same total charge in the same volume physically where x y z moves at c 6 0 relatively to xy z this conclusion directly comes from the fact that the volume v in v t d 3 x is fixed in xy z and the volume v in v t d 3 x is fixed in x y z so that t and v and t and v are exchangeable respectively as shown in eq 32 in order to make both v t d 3 x dq dt and v t d 3 x dq dt hold in general however according to einstein s relativ ity 20 v fixed in xy z is moving observed in x y z now v in v t d 3 x is at rest in x y z and thus v and v do not denote the same volume and q and q do not denote the same total charge therefore the continuity equation j 0 cannot be taken as the invariant charge conservation law in relativity 2 p 40 which can be better understood from the mathematical counterexample given below counterexample of weinberg s claim why is j 0 not a sufficient condition to make q const be a lorentz scalar even additionally plus a zero boundary condition j j c 0 on s s j ds 0 to understand this consider a mathematical four vector given by w x t w w 4 f x 0 0 ct fx 48 defined in the cubic domain v x y z where w f x 0 0 w 4 ct fx and f x sinx 2 sin y 2 sin z 2 with v f x d 3 x 3 w x t satisfies the zero boundary condition namely w w w 4 0 holds on the boundary s x y z w is divergence less namely w 0 and in addi tion w has a zero boundary condition s w ds 0 holds according to weinberg s claim w 0 makes w 4 d 3 x be a lorentz scalar however because of v t const wd 3 x 3 0 0 6 0 w does not satisfy the sufficient and necessary condition eq 23 of theorem 3 thus according to theorem 3 v t const w 4 d 3 x v t const ct fxd 3 x 0 is not a lorentz scalar to better understand this from eq 28 we have v t const wd 3 x x v f x d 3 x x 3 49 and cannot hold for any x 6 0 thus weinberg s claim is disproved namely w 0 is not a sufficient condition to make w 4 d 3 x be a scalar in the above counterexample w 0 holds but wd 3 x 0 does not hold thus in general the suffi cient condition 0 of weinberg s claim does not in cludes the sufficient and necessary condition d 3 x 0 of theorem 3 the current density four vector j j c and the above counterexample w w w 4 are all divergence less while the lorentz property of their time element space integrals does not depends on the divergence less now let us take a look of four vectors that are not divergence less and see what difference they may have example 1 consider a four vector given by 4 sinx sin y sin z 0 0 0 defined in the cu bic domain v x y z with cosx sin y sin z 6 0 holding except for some individual discrete points and v t const d 3 x 0 0 0 0 hold ing according to theorem 3 v t const 4 d 3 x 0 is a lorentz scalar because v t const d 3 x put it simply for 6 0 4 d 3 x is a lorentz scalar example 2 consider a four vector given by u u u 4 sin 2 x sin 2 y sin 2 z 0 0 0 defined in the cu bic domain v x y z with u 2 cosx sinx sin 2 y sin 2 z 6 0 holding except for some individual discrete points and v t const ud 3 x 3 0 0 6 0 holding according to theorem 3 v t const u 4 d 3 x 0 is not a lorentz scalar because v t const ud 3 x x 3 6 for any x 6 0 put it simply for u 6 0 u 4 d 3 x is not a lorentz scalar from above example 1 and example 2 we know that 4 d 3 x is a lorentz scalar for 6 0 and u 4 d 3 x is not a lorentz scalar for u 6 0 we have known that j 4 d 3 x is a lorentz scalar for j 0 6 while the counterexample of weinberg s claim tells us that w 4 d 3 x is not a lorentz scalar for w 0 thus we can generally conclude that whether the time element space integral of a four vector is a lorentz scalar has nothing to do with the divergence less property of the four vector the invariance problem of total electric charge has been resolved by using derivative von laue s theorem in ref 6 which indicates that the invariance comes from two facts a j is a four vector and b the moving ve locity of any charged particles is less than vacuum light speed this strict theoretical result removes the assump tion that the total charge is an experimental invariant 4 p 555 the difference between the derivative von laue s the orem 6 and theorem 3 is that the derivative von laue s theorem has a pre assumption of t 0 namely 4 is not allowed to be time dependent while theorem 3 does not for example we also can use the derivative von laue s theorem 6 to analyze the four vector 4 sinx sin y sin z 0 0 0 discussed above because t 0 holds but we cannot use it to analyze w x t given by eq 48 because w t 0 does not hold thus theorem 3 has a better adaptability 11 v remarks and conclusions in this paper we have developed lorentz four vector theorems theorem 1 for column four vector and theo rem 2 for row four vector they are essentially the same and lorentz scalar theorem theorem 3 based on the orem 1 we find that the well established m ller s theo rem is fundamentally wrong and we provided a corrected version of m ller s theorem see sec iii based on the orem 3 we disproved weinberg s claim and obtained a general conclusion for the lorentz property of a four vector s time element space integral see sec iv we have shown that the sufficient condition of m ller s theorem makes the time column space integrals of a ten sor be time independent constants however it is not a sufficient condition to make the integrals constitute a lorentz four vector the corrected m ller s theorem has a limited application especially for minkowski em stress energy tensor the corrected m ller s theorem only defines a trivial zero four vector we have shown that there are three four vector the orems a generalized von laue s theorem b cor rected m ller s theorem and c theorem 1 the gen eralized von laue s theorem presented in ref 6 has a pre assumption that tensor is required to be time independent t 0 the corrected m ller s theorem provided in the present paper also has a pre assumption that tensor is required to be divergence less 0 and required to satisfy a zero boundary condition 0 on boundary but is allowed to be time dependent compared with the generalized von laue s theorem and corrected m ller s theorem theorem 1 does not have any pre assumption while the three the orems have the same sufficient and necessary condition thus theorem 1 has a better adaptability as shown by a specific example described by eq 47 in sec iii however it should be noted that just because the generalized von laue s theorem has a pre assumption of x t t 0 but no boundary condition re quired and the corrected m ller s theorem has a pre assumption of x t 0 plus x t 0 on boundary zero boundary condition the four vector p v t const 4 x t d 3 x defined by the two theo rems is time independent p t 0 thus the gen eralized von laue s theorem and the corrected m ller s theorem can be taken as conservation laws in a tradi tional sense we also have shown that there are three incorrect four vector theorems i m ller s theorem which is also called m ller s version of laue s theorem in ref 6 ii landau lifshitz version of laue s theorem and iii weinberg s version of laue s theorem m ller s version is disproved in the present paper by taking the mathemat ical tensor eq 38 as a counterexample while landau lifshitz and weinberg s versions are disproved in ref 6 by taking the em tensor of a charged metal sphere in free space as a counterexample all the sufficient condi tions of the three disproved versions of laue s theorem include the divergence less of a tensor x t 0 but they do not include or derive the sufficient and nec essary condition eq 10 thus it is not appropriate that x t 0 is recognized to be conservation law 18 p 310 or to guarantee conservation of the total 4 momentum 21 p 443 in traditional textbooks the most convincing way to disprove a mathematical conjecture is to provide its counterexample the coun terexample eq 38 for m ller s version of laue s theo rem a is also a counterexample of landau lifshitz and weinberg s versions of laue s theorem because a is both divergence less a 0 and symmetric a a while the landau lifshitz version takes the divergence less of a tensor as a sufficient condition and the weinberg s version takes the divergence less plus a symmetry of a tensor as a sufficient condition in other words a given by eq 38 is a common mathematical counterexample to disprove m ller s landau lifshitz and weinberg s versions of laue s theorem which are all mathematical conjectures independent of physics al though originating from physics because all physical im plications have already been turned into mathematical descriptions there is a well known result in the dynamics of rel ativity that if a lorentz four vector is divergence less then the time element space integral of the four vector is a lorentz scalar for example weinberg claims that for any conserved four vector namely for any four vector j j c that satisfies equation j 0 cq j 4 d 3 x c d 3 x defines a time independent scalar 2 p 41 and m ller also claims a proof of such a result in his textbook 3 p 168 however in the present paper we have shown based on theorem 3 in sec iv that this well known result is not correct we have found a general conclusion for the lorentz prop erty of a four vector s time element space integral stat ing that whether the time element space integral of a four vector is a lorentz scalar has nothing to do with the four vector s divergence less property accordingly it is not appropriate for the current continuity equa tion j x t 0 to be called invariant conservation law 2 p 40 or the law of charge conservation 21 p 559 p 443 in textbooks as presented in traditional textbooks the local con servation law of energy momentum in general relativity given by t 0 22 p 298 is covariantly generalized from the conservation law t t 0 in spe cial relativity 1 p 83 2 p 45 26 thus the validity of the latter is a necessary condition for the validity of the former this law is often used for relativistic analysis of the abraham minkowski debate on the momentum of light in a medium 9 11 and it is also thought to play an important role in gravitation theory 21 p 132 be cause the gr general relativity field equations should be consistent with energy and momentum conservation t 0 22 p 299 this law is so well established that often no citations are given for its origin in research articles 27 30 however in fact the traditional conser 12 vation laws including both 0 and t 0 21 p 443 can be directly disproved by simple physical coun terexamples as shown in appendix c although they are claimed to have been already proved with the use of the modern language of exterior calculus 19 p 318 thus clarifying the two conservation laws in the present paper has a general significance in conclusion we have generally resolved two funda mental issues in the dynamics of relativity a un der what condition the time column space integrals of a lorentz four tensor constitute a lorentz four vector theorem 1 and b under what condition the time element space integral of a lorentz four vector is a lorentz scalar theorem 3 both theorem 1 and the orem 3 have their own sufficient and necessary condi tions which have nothing to do with the divergence less 0 or 0 symmetry and boundary conditions this point is especially important for example from theorem 1 we can directly judge that m ller s theorem is incorrect because the sufficient con dition of m ller s theorem does not include the sufficient and necessary condition of theorem 1 as shown in coun terexample eq 38 a similar argument is applicable to the invariant conservation law claimed by weinberg 2 p 40 as shown in counterexample eq 48 as a practical application we have used theorem 1 to analyze minkowski em tensor for a plane light wave in a moving medium with einstein s light quantum hy pothesis taken into account and we find that the four momentum of quasi photon and the lorentz invariance of planck constant can be naturally derived see ap pendix b einstein s light quantum hypothesis is the ba sis of bohr frequency condition of radiation from atomic transitions the invariance of planck constant is an im plicit postulate in dirac relativistic quantum mechanics 7 and the existence of four momentum of the quasi photon is required by momentum energy conservation law in einstein box thought experiment 25 thus this natural derivation is compatible with the quantum the ory and the momentum energy conservation law and the result obtained strongly supports the minkowski tensor as being the most qualified momentum energy tensor for descriptions of light matter interactions in the frame of the principle of relativity in relativity charge conservation law refers to that the total charge is a time and frame independent constant 2 p 41 as demonstrated in eq a 6 of appendix a while energy momentum conservation law refers to that the to tal energy and momentum constitute a covariant and time independent four vector 2 p 46 as demonstrated for a plane light wave in appendix b the problems of 0 and 0 as being conservation laws in relativity were first discovered in 6 7 and they are ex plicitly illustrated and generally resolved in the present paper one might argue that in the establishment of the positive mass theorems in general relativity rigorous mathematics has been used and loopholes possibly left in earlier works do not exist unfortunately this is not true these problems never got any attention in the proofs of the positive mass theorem by schoen and yau in 1979 32 and 1981 39 witten 33 and nester 34 in 1981 parker and taubes in 1982 35 and gibbons and coworkers in 1983 36 all the proofs are based on a flawed theoret ical framework set up by arnowitt deser and misner 37 38 where the total energy momentum p in an asymptotically flat spacetime is required to obey the differential conservation law t 0 of the energy momentum tensor t and required to transform as a four vector 38 however in fact the conservation law t 0 cannot guarantee that p is a four vector as shown in appendix d apparently this problem is ignored in all the proofs 32 36 39 moreover the equa tions t 0 t 0 t 0 or t 0 have been always claimed as conservation law in later litera ture such as in ref 28 by ratra and peebles in 1988 ref 27 by witten in 1991 ref 22 p 299 by rindler in 2006 and ref 29 by bic a k and schmidt in 2016 from this one can see that the community in the field of rela tivity has never become aware of these problems before the publications of 6 7 recently bojowald criticizes that the constant wave four vector k in appendix c does not constitute a counterexample to the traditional conservation law 0 4 d 3 x invariant because it does not obey the usual boundary conditions of conservation laws which state that the integrated current must vanish at timelike boundaries or at infinity 40 apparently bojowald s criticism has no basis at all because the con servation law 0 as claimed in 2 p 40 19 21 p 443 does not require 0 holding on bound aries a typical example is the current density four vector j j c for a sphere of perfect conductor with a radius of r 6 0 and a total static charge of q 6 0 in free space observed in the sphere rest frame the current density is given by j 0 holding everywhere and according to the basic properties for a perfect con ductor we know that any net charge resides on the sur face 41 p 97 with the charge density given by q r r 4 r 2 where x is dirac delta function the current four vector j satisfies the invariant conser vation law j 0 with cq j 4 d 3 x as a lorentz invariant as claimed by weinberg 2 p 40 however j 4 c cq r r 4 r 2 6 0 holds on the spherical boundary r r from this elegant example of classi cal electrodynamics four current j not vanishing on boundary for charged metallic sphere in free space one can see that bojowald s criticism is exactly based on his groundless speculation and it is not justified thus k 6 0 on boundaries does not lose its qualification to be a counterexample namely the wave four vector k with k 0 and k 4 d 3 x 6 invariant in appendix c is a completely qualified counterexample to the traditional conservation law 0 4 d 3 x invariant bojowald also criticizes that instead of from theorem 1 developed in the present paper the total momentum energy four vector should be constructed from a covari 13 ant combination of a stress energy tensor and the hyper plane differential element hde four vector 40 as pre sented in literature such as the textbook by jackson 4 p 757 however as shown in appendix a the hde four vector is apparently in contradiction with the principle of relativity and the principles of classical mathematical analysis thus this criticism by bojowald is not justified either coming from his negligence of the self consistency of a physical theory and his lack of a good knowledge about how to transform a space integral from one iner tial frame to another according to the change of variables theorem in mathematical analysis 14 appendix a how to transform space integrals between lorentz inertial frames in special relativity the hyperplane differential element hde four vector is often used to transform triple space integrals from one lorentz inertial frame to another 4 p 757 in this appendix we will show that the hde four vector itself is not consistent with the principles of classical mathematical analysis and the prin ciple of relativity although it is lorentz covariant confer appendix e for the definition of covariance under time space lorentz transformation there are two techniques used to transform space triple integrals between inertial frames the first technique is based on the change of variables theorem as presented in mathe matical analysis 14 and used in laue s original paper to derive laue s theorem 12 and also used to develop my theory in the present paper and the previous work 6 called technique i for convenience in this technique the differential element transformation formula or the change of variable formula from the laboratory frame xy z to the frame x y z is given by d 3 x x y z x y z d 3 x d 3 x a 1 where x y z moves at c with respect to xy z while xy z moves at c c with respect to x y z d 3 x is the proper differential element fixed in xy z while d 3 x is the corresponding element moving at c c in x y z jacobian determinant x y z x y z with 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 is calcu lated from eq 3 as illustrated in the analytical exam ple in sec ii note that d 3 x moving element d 3 x multiplied by its relativistic factor is a lorentz invariant in the technique i the second technique is based on the hde hyper plane differential element four vector as presented in some respected textbooks such as the book by jack son 4 p 757 called technique ii for convenience in technique ii the integral domain v is assumed to be at rest in the laboratory frame and then similar to the clas sical particle s four momentum proper mass multiplied by its four velocity a differential element four vector proper element multiplied by its four velocity normal ized to light speed c is constructed to define the change of variable formula in the laboratory frame xy z the hde four vector is given by ds ds ds 4 0 1 d 3 x 0 0 0 1 d 3 x a 2 in the frame x y z moving at c with respect to xy z the hde four vector is given by ds ds ds 4 d 3 x a 3 where is the normalized four velocity of v fixed in xy z moving at c c observed in x y z with taken into account we have ds 4 d 3 x d 3 x ds 4 a 4 the change of variable formula for technique ii in above eqs a 2 and a 3 ds 0 1 d 3 x means that d 3 x is fixed in xy z while ds 1 d 3 x means that d 3 x d 3 x moves at c c in x y z note that d 3 x d 3 x is an invariant in the technique ii in special relativity developed by einstein 20 a mov ing object lorentz contracts in the direction of motion while keeping in the same the dimensions of the object in all the transverse directions now d 3 x is fixed in xy z and it is moving observed in x y z thus according to einstein d 3 x denoting the size of d 3 x observed in x y z is given by d 3 x d 3 x a 5 which is exactly the same as eq a 1 derived from the change of variables theorem 14 that is because the change of variables theorem is the strict mathematical basis of the effect of lorentz contraction under time space lorentz transformation as shown in the analytical exam ple in sec ii however according to eq a 4 technique ii requires d 3 x d 3 x thus technique ii contradicts both the change of variables theorem in mathematical analysis and and the effect of lorentz contraction in einstein s special relativity more seriously technique ii directly contra dicts lorentz invariance of total charge in other words if technique ii were used then a non zero total charge would not be a lorentz invariant which is shown below total charge q invariant in technique i first we show that lorentz invariance of total charge is always valid in technique i without loss of generality we as sume that a charge distribution is created by charged particles which move at the same velocity otherwise it can be treated discretely as shown in ref 6 accord ing to special relativity there must exist an inertial frame xy z where the charged particles are at rest thus in the charge rest frame xy z taken as the laboratory frame the total charge can be formulated as q v x d 3 x 14 where x with t 0 is the charge distribution v is the volume at rest and q is the time independent total charge in v in such a case all charged particles are stationary and frozen in v so that no current exists j 0 observed in a frame x y z moving at c 6 0 with respect to the charge rest frame xy z the volume v is moving at c c but there are no charged par ticles crossing through the boundary of v although the current j c 6 0 holds in technique i as shown in eq a 5 the change of variable formula is given by d 3 x d 3 x from this with c c j and j 0 taken into account we have cq v c d 3 x v c j d 3 x v c d 3 x cq invariant a 6 thus we finish the proof that the total charge is always a lorentz invariant in technique i total charge q non invariant in technique ii now we show why technique ii contradicts the lorentz in variance of total charge in the laboratory frame xy z charge rest frame the four current density is given by j j j 4 with j 0 and j 4 c and the total charge q is defined by cq v c d 3 x v j 4 ds 4 ob served in the frame x y z moving at c with respect to the laboratory frame xy z we have j j j 4 with j j 4 and j 4 c j 4 and the total charge q is defined by cq v c d 3 x v j 4 ds 4 according to eq a 2 and eq a 3 of technique ii we have ds ds ds 4 with ds 0 and ds 4 d 3 x and ds ds ds 4 ds 4 with ds ds 4 and ds 4 ds 4 d 3 x from this we have v j 4 ds 4 v j ds v j ds v j 4 ds 4 v j ds v j 4 ds 4 v j 4 ds 4 v j 4 ds 4 2 v j 4 ds 4 1 2 v j 4 ds 4 v j 4 ds 4 2 cq cq q 6 q a 7 if q 6 0 holds where 6 0 is assumed 1 thus we finish the proof that a non zero total charge q 6 0 is not a lorentz invariant in technique ii so far we have shown that the total charge q 6 0 is never a lorentz invariant in technique ii while the total charge q is always a lorentz invariant in technique i both cases have nothing to do with the boundary condi tions of j j c conclusion from above analysis we can conclude that technique ii is based on the hde four vector as pre sented in 4 p 757 and it has three flaws i contra dicting the change of variables theorem in mathemati cal analysis 14 ii contradicting the effect of lorentz contraction in special relativity and iii contradicting the lorentz invariance of total charge to put it simply technique ii follows neither the principles of mathemat ical analysis nor the principle of relativity thus the lorentz covariant hyperplane differential element four vector eq a 3 is only a mathematical four vector in stead of a physical four vector 24 two subtle but apparently fundamental issues in analysis of the lorentz invariance of total charge in a volume a subtle and important issue is about how to define the volume if there are charged particles crossing through the boundary of the volume the total charge in the volume may not be lorentz invariant 15 possibly leading to a doubt of the completeness of maxwell em theory 16 thus the correct volume is supposed to be the one that moves at the same velocity as that of the charge as argued above another subtle issue is how to correctly understand the definition of total charge for example by analysis of an infinite straight charged wire bilic puzzled that the standard definition q v d 3 x and the so called covariant definition q j ds in units with c 1 are not equivalent in general 15 now we know that the problem turned out to be here the transform of triple integral j ds j ds contra dicts the change of variables theorem in mathematical analysis 14 as shown in eqs a 1 and a 4 appendix b natural derivation of four momentum of quasi photon and invariance of planck constant quasi photons are the carriers of the momentum and energy of the light in a medium and they are descriptions of the macroscopic average of light matter microscopic in teractions 17 lorentz invariance of planck constant is an implicit postulate in dirac relativistic quantum the ory 7 in this appendix we will apply theorem 1 to minkowski em tensor for a plane light wave in a moving uniform medium and find that the momentum energy four vector four momentum of the quasi photon and the lorentz invariance of planck constant can be nat urally derived for a plane light wave propagating in a moving non dispersive isotropic uniform medium observed in the medium rest frame minkowski quasi photons character izing the light matter interactions move along the wave vector kw at the speed c n with n 1 the refractive in dex in such a case there is a photon rest frame moving at the quasi photon velocity relatively to the medium rest frame 7 17 observed in the photon rest frame 15 xy z taken as the laboratory frame here there are some fantastic em phenomena to take place 1 the em fields e 0 h 0 d d 0 cos and b b 0 cos hold where d 0 6 0 and b 0 6 0 with d 0 b 0 are the constant amplitudes leading to em energy density wem 0 5 d e b h 0 and abraham momentum ga e h c 2 0 but the minkowski momentum gm d b 6 0 2 the wave angular frequency 0 and the wave phase t kw x kw x hold with the wave vector kw 6 0 leading to all the em fields behaving as static fields 17 the minkowski em stress energy tensor t is given by eq 43 with t m de bh i wem 0 and cga 0 holding the holding of v t const t md 3 x 0 and v t const cgad 3 x 0 the holding of v t const t jd 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 according to the sufficient and necessary con dition eq 10 of theorem 1 t time column t time row space integrals p c v t const gm wem c d 3 x b 1 constitute a lorentz four vector which is time independent because of all the em fields behaving as being static in the photon rest frame t t 0 including gm wem c t 0 observed in the inertial frame x y z moving rela tively to the photon rest frame xy z at a velocity of c we have p c v t const g m w em c d 3 x b 2 where the phase is given by t k w x and v is moving at c c from the lorentz transformation of em field strength tensors 7 see eqs 3 and 4 there with e 0 and h 0 taken into account we have e bc b 3 h dc b 4 d d d b 5 b b b b 6 where 1 2 1 2 and 1 2 from above eqs b 3 b 6 we obtain e h w em c c b 7 called the energy velocity traditionally where w em 0 5 d e b h d e b h is the em energy density because e h w em c given by above eq b 7 is the moving velocity of the vol ume v seemingly it indeed looks like the velocity of energy transport however in fact it is not the real energy velocity in general the real energy velocity is the phase velocity required by both fermat s principle and energy conservation law which are physical postu lates independent of maxwell equations 23 that is why c e h w em is called photon apparent velocity in ref 7 according to the lorentz transformation of the wave four vector k kw c with 0 in xy z taken into account we have k w c k w c b 8 as mentioned above both fermat s principle and en ergy conservation law require the em energy to propa gate at the phase velocity 7 given by phc k w k w k w k w phc b 9 from eq b 8 and eq b 9 we have k w k w ph b 10 as indicated the volume v in eq b 2 moves at c if the same volume v moves at phc we label it as v light called light volume 7 observed in the photon rest frame xy z the volume v is at rest and the light volume vlight is also at rest due to 0 phc 0 namely vlight v observed in x y z from eq b 10 we find that t k w x takes the same value for x x 0 ct with x v and for x x 0 phct with x v light thus with v in eq b 2 replaced by v light we obtain an equivalent expression given by p c v light t const g m w em c d 3 x b 11 the above eq b 11 is a time independent and lorentz covariant four vector so far with theorem 1 applied to minkowski em ten sor we have arrived at a conclusion that for a plane light wave in a medium the total minkowski em momen tum and energy contained in a light volume constitute a lorentz four vector the above result implies that observed in any inertial frame all photons in a light volume are moving at the same velocity as that of the light volume and no pho tons cross the boundary of the volume in other words observed at the same time in all inertial frames respec tively the photons in the light volume are the same pho tons this lorentz property of light volume was first formulated in ref 7 see eq 50 there directly based on the lorentz covariance of em field strength tensors instead of minkowski em tensor this makes sense be cause minkowski tensor is a covariant combination of the 16 em field strength tensors 17 footnote 7 and in princi ple all physical results obtained from minkowski tensor are already embodied in the em field strength tensors 24 especially if there is only one photon contained in the light volume v light and einstein light quantum hypothe sis is taken into account namely v light t const w emd 3 x b 12 then v light t const g md 3 x v light t const d b d 3 x v light t const w em k wd 3 x k w b 13 is the momentum of the photon in v light where the lorentz invariant expression d b w em k w is used 7 see eq 37 there and is the reduced planck constant inserting eq b 12 and eq b 13 into eq b 11 we find that k w c k p c b 14 is the photon s four momentum where k k w c is a known wave four vector since k and k are both four vectors g k x scalar and g k x scalar must hold where g is the minkowski metric and x is the time space four vector note that g k x is the scalar of phase and it can be any real number thus the planck constant must be a lorentz invariant this conclusion was first obtained in ref 7 directly from two em field strength tensors conclusion from above it is seen that the four momentum of quasi photon in a medium and the in variance of planck constant are naturally obtained by applying theorem 1 to minkowski tensor with taken into account einstein light quantum hypothesis that is the basis of bohr frequency condition of atomic transi tions in quantum theory on the other hand as shown in einstein box thought experiment 25 momentum energy conservation law requires the quasi photon to have a four momentum thus the minkowski tensor is compatible with the quantum theory of atomic light radi ation and the momentum energy conservation law and it is the correct momentum energy tensor for descriptions of light matter interactions question 1 is the generalized von laue s theorem 6 applicable for identifying the lorentz property of light momentum and energy for a plane light wave in a medium the answer is yes because its pre assumption t t 0 is satisfied as shown above question 2 is the corrected m ller s theorem applica ble for identifying the lorentz property of light momen tum and energy for a plane light wave in a medium the answer is no because this plane light wave is a non trivial solution of maxwell equations non zero field solution and the pre assumption of corrected m ller s theorem cannot be satisfied namely the divergence less t t t m gm t cga wem ct 0 is fulfilled 6 but the zero boundary condition t 0 on the boundary of v cannot be fulfilled for example t 14 t 24 t 34 cgm cd b cd 0 b 0 cos 2 kw x 0 cannot hold on the whole closed boundary surface of a finite 3 d domain v 6 0 because cos 2 kw x 0 only appears on the discrete planes with kw x 2 l 1 2 where l is an arbitrary integer question 3 is theorem 1 applicable for identifying the lorentz property of light momentum and energy for a plane light wave in free space the answer is no in free space for a non trivial plane wave observed in any given inertial frame xy z the em fields can be writ ten as e h d b e 0 h 0 0 e 0 0 h 0 cos where e 0 6 0 and h 0 6 0 with e 0 h 0 are the constant amplitudes t kw x is the wave phase kw with kw c 6 0 is the wave vector and 0 and 0 the vacuum permittivity and permeability constants abraham and minkowski momentums are equal namely ga gm e h c 2 6 0 according to theorem 1 the sufficient and necessary condition for the plane wave can be written as v t const t j x t d 3 x 0 for 1 2 3 4 and j 1 2 3 b 15 where the volume v is at rest in xy z and t is given by eq 43 from eq 43 we have v t const t 41 t 42 t 43 d 3 x v t const cgad 3 x 6 0 b 16 for a finite volume v 6 0 from above eq b 16 we find that the sufficient and necessary condition eq b 15 cannot hold thus we con clude that for a plane light wave in free space the to tal minkowsi abraham momentum and energy con tained in a given volume v that is at rest in an iner tial frame cannot constitute a lorentz four vector how ever it does not mean that the momentum and energy of light cannot constitute a four vector because the pho tons in free space cannot be stopped in a given volume v that is resting in an inertial frame in terms of ein stein s hypothesis of constancy of light speed from this it follows that always there are photons crossing through the boundary of v and flowing into and out of v and thus the photons in v are not the same photons ob served for different time note that the photon density 17 np wem 0 e 20 cos 2 is a wave depen dent on time and space locations on the other hand because of the relativity of simultaneity photons may cross through the boundary of v at the same time in one frame but these photons cannot cross through the boundary of v at the same time in other frames thus leading to a result that the photons in v are not the same photons observed in different frames that is why the total momentum and energy of the photons contained in v cannot constitute a four vector in such a case therefore theorem 1 only can be used to identify the lorentz property of the total momentum and energy of materials or particles which are moving at a velocity less than the vacuum light speed c so that there is a material rest or particle rest inertial frame such as in the case for a plane light wave in a dielectric medium shown above where minkowski quasi photon propagates at a velocity of c n c 17 note if a momentum energy tensor is contributed by materials or particles which move at different velocities individually then the tensor should be discretized so that each of the discretized tensors is contributed by the materials or particles which move at the same velocity just like in the proof of the lorentz invariance of total charge given in ref 6 it should be noted that in free space the invariance of planck constant and the covariance of wave four vector k have been already proved in 7 and 20 respectively thus the four momentum of photon in free space equal to k is a solved problem theoretically further specific explanation why is v t const cgad 3 x v t const e h c d 3 x 6 0 always valid for a finite v 6 0 for a plane wave in free space for a non trivial plane wave in free space observed in any inertial frames the power flow or poynting vector e h e 0 h 0 cos 2 6 0 e 0 h 0 6 0 holds otherwise there are no energy flowing and no wave on the other hand we have v t const cos 2 d 3 x 0 holding thus leading to the holding of v t const cgad 3 x 6 0 for a plane wave in free space note v t const cos 2 d 3 x 0 comes from the fact that v 6 0 is a finite 3 d volume and cos 2 0 holds with the zero points only appearing on discrete planes and thus there must exist a smaller volume v v where cos 2 0 exactly holds the hold ing of v t const cos 2 d 3 x v t const cos 2 d 3 x 0 appendix c physical counterexamples of thirring s claims the most effective and convincing way to disprove a claim is to give its counterexample in this appendix we will provide two physical counterexamples of the claims made by thirring in his book 19 with the help of exterior calculus thirring claims i 0 makes 4 d 3 x be a lorentz scalar namely invariant conservation law claimed by wein berg 2 p 40 ii t 0 makes t 4 d 3 x be a lorentz four vector namely landau lifshitz version of laue s theo rem 6 in both claims i and ii no boundary conditions are required however claim i can be directly disproved by a simple counterexample k and claim ii can be directly disproved by a simple counterexample t k k where k kw c is the wave four vector for a plane wave in free space first shown by einstein 20 with kw the wave vector 6 0 the angular frequency and kw c holding this is illustrated as follows apparently k 0 and k k 0 are both valid because k is independent of space and time vari ables x t suppose that x y z frame moves with re spect to the laboratory frame xy z at a velocity of c along the wave vector kw observed in xy z we have k 4 c and v k 4 d 3 x c v d 3 x c 1 where the integral domain v is fixed in xy z observed in x y z we have k 4 c and v k 4 d 3 x v c d 3 x c 2 where the integral domain v is moving at c c from the lorentz transformation of k we obtain the doppler frequency shift 20 given by c c kw 1 c c 3 where 1 2 1 2 is the time dilation factor and kw kw kw c is employed as shown in eq a 5 of appendix a the change of variable formula in such a case is given by d 3 x d 3 x inserting eq c 3 into eq c 2 with d 3 x d 3 x and 18 eq c 1 taken into account we have v k 4 d 3 x v c d 3 x 1 c v d 3 x 1 c v d 3 x 1 v k 4 d 3 x c 4 note that in above eq c 4 the integrand k 4 satisfies the definition eq 24 in the proof of theorem 3 from above eq c 4 we have v k 4 d 3 x 6 v k 4 d 3 x for c 6 0 c 5 thus we conclude that v k 4 d 3 x is not a lorentz scalar and thirring s claim i is disproved on the other hand we have v t 4 d 3 x v k k 4 d 3 x k v k 4 d 3 x c 6 in above eq c 6 k is a four vector but v k 4 d 3 x is not a lorentz scalar thus their product k v k 4 d 3 x v t 4 d 3 x c 7 must not be a four vector and thirring s claim ii is disproved as well proof by contradiction that eq c 7 is not a four vector if eq c 7 were a four vector then g k x v k 4 d 3 x scalar c 8 would hold where x x ct is the time space four vector and g k x t kw x scalar c 9 is the scalar of phase with g diag 1 1 1 1 the minkowski metric thus from eq c 8 and eq c 9 it follows that v k 4 d 3 x must be a scalar but v k 4 d 3 x is not a scalar according to eq c 5 this contradiction indicates that eq c 7 v t 4 d 3 x k v k 4 d 3 x cannot be a lorentz four vector an interesting question why is k 4 d 3 x not a scalar for the wave four vector k kw c while j 4 d 3 x is a scalar for the current density four vector j j c that is because the moving velocity of any charged par ticle is less than the vacuum light speed c and there is a particle rest frame where the particle current j 0 jd 3 x 0 holds with the sufficient and necessary condition eq 23 of theorem 3 satisfied j 4 d 3 x scalar as shown in eq a 6 of appendix a however for k kw c there is no such a frame where kw 0 kwd 3 x 0 holds thus k 4 d 3 x is not a scalar why is there no such a frame for kw 0 as we know the photon momentum energy four vector is given by k kw c with the planck constant according to einstein s hypothesis of constancy of light speed there is no photon rest frame in free space and the photon momentum kw 6 0 kw 6 0 holds in any frames appendix d why is the theoretical framework for the positive mass theorem flawed in general relativity the metric g are solutions of einstein s field equations for a given energy momentum tensor t that causes space to curve 21 p 5 accord ing to arnowitt deser and misner 37 the definition of the total energy momentum p is given by the volume integral of the components of t 0 namely p t 0 d 3 x d 1 which can be expressed as surface integrals through ein stein s field equations and gauss s theorem and where p 0 e is the total energy 38 in the proofs of the positive mass theorem 33 35 39 the total energy follows the definition in 37 38 21 p 462 given by e 1 16 gjk k gkk j d 2 sj d 2 where the integral is evaluated over a closed surface in the asymptotically flat region surrounding the source of gravitation arnowitt deser and misner claim that because of the conservation law t 0 p should transform as a four vector 38 which is clearly endorsed by nester 34 in the textbook by misner thorne and wheeler 21 p 462 it is also emphasized that the conservation law t 0 t 0 makes p t 0 d 3 x p t 0 d 3 x be a four vector unfortunately as shown by the counterexample in ap pendix c t 0 cannot guarantee that p is a four vector thus the arnowitt deser misner theoreti cal framework used for the proofs of the positive mass theorem is flawed nevertheless one might argue that in the framework of the positive mass theorem in addition to t 0 there is another important requirement called dominant energy condition 39 reading t 00 t d 3 for each 30 35 and both t 0 and t 00 t together make p t 0 d 3 x be a four vector in above arnowitt deser misner practice 0 1 2 3 used 19 however this is not true because the counterexample t k k d 4 in appendix c itself satisfies the dominant energy con dition t 44 t d 5 namely k 4 k 4 k k d 6 or c 2 k k d 7 where k kw c with kw c k here rindler s practice 1 2 3 4 22 p 138 used that is to say although the conservation law t 0 or t k k 0 and the dominant energy condition t 44 t or k 4 k 4 k k are both sat isfied p t 4 d 3 x k k 4 d 3 x k 4 d 3 x k d 8 is not a four vector because k 4 d 3 x is not a scalar as shown in eq c 5 of appendix c from above we can see that all the proofs of the posi tive mass theorem 32 36 39 are based on a flawed the oretical framework and thus the validity of the theorem itself could be called into question appendix e is gordon optical metric covariant how to define the covariance of physical quanti ties equations is one of the most important issues in op tics of moving media actually it is a long lasting un solved fundamental problem in the theory of relativity in this appendix we take maxwell equations and the four momentum of a massive particle as examples to give the definition of covariance and indicate why the covariance of gordon metric tensor 42 is indeterminate in principle the definitions of physical quantities used to construct a covariant theory of light propagation in moving media are supposed to be given in a general in ertial frame otherwise the covariance of the constructed theory is ambiguous at least one cannot identify the covariance of the quantity without a definition given in a general frame as a first principle maxwell equations are the physi cal basis for descriptions of macro electromagnetic phe nomena and all other alternative approaches including lagrange formalism must be confirmed by the maxwell equations 4 p 598 thus any justified results that can not be derived from maxwell equations could constitute a challenge of the completeness of classical electromagnetic theory it is well established that maxwell equations are co variant under lorentz transformation of two em field strength tensors 24 this covariance has three proper ties a maxwell equations keep invariant in mathematical form in all lorentz inertial frames b all physical quantities appearing in the equations have the same physical definitions in all frames c maxwell equations in one frame do not include any physical quantities defined in other inertial frames the above three properties do not contain each other to put it simply maxwell equations are frame independent under lorentz transformation of two em field strength tensors another typical example for the covariance is the four momentum of a massive particle given by m 0 u non covariant form m u covariant form in relativity mv mc 2 c covariant form in 3 d space e 1 in a general xy z frame where m 0 is the particle s mass in the particle rest frame rest proper mass u v c is the four velocity m m 0 is the mass 1 v 2 c 2 1 2 and v is the particle s velocity the definition of m 0 u is in a non covariant form m 0 u has the same mathematical form and physical def inition in all inertial frames and complies with proper ties a and b but it is not consistent with property c because m 0 u includes m 0 defined in the particle rest frame and thus m 0 u cannot provide the frame independent definitions of momentum and mass in a gen eral frame for example m 0 u defines m 0 as the parti cle s mass in the particle rest frame but m 0 u does not define the particles s mass m in a general frame properties b and c require that the definitions of particle s momentum and mass must be the same in all inertial frames and they do not include any quantities defined in other frames namely momentum mass velocity mv e 2 thus we have the mass transformation m m 0 obviously the definition of four momentum m u mv mc 2 c is frame independent un der its lorentz transformation especially like maxwell 20 equations it does not include any quantities of other frames thus this definition complies with property c in addition to properties a and b note that m u is a covariant form in relativity with m an invariant and u the four velocity of the particle in a general xy z frame while mv mc 2 c is a covariant form in 3 d space with mv the momentum and mc 2 the energy of the particle in a general xy z frame just like maxwell equations have the two forms of covariance confer 17 footnote 7 there unfortunately property c has been usually neglected in constructing a tensor in the community a typical ex ample is gordon optical metric tensor 42 which is gen eralized to describe the effective gravitational field for a nonuniformly moving medium in the works by leonhardt and piwnicki 43 44 the gordon metric in a general xy z frame reads g n 20 1 u u e 3 where g diag 1 1 1 1 is the minkowski met ric u u c 1 with v c is the normalized four velocity of the moving medium namely the medium moves at v c with respect to xy z and n 0 is the refractive index in the medium rest frame from eq e 3 we find that g n 20 1 u u is given in a general frame xy z but it includes n 0 which is a quantity defined in another frame medium rest frame obviously this is not consistent with prop erty c in their works 43 44 leonhardt and piwnicki are supposed to provide the definition of the refractive index in a general frame in order to remove this in consistency and make it expressed in a covariant form just like eq e 2 leading to the frame independent four momentum m u mv mc 2 c shown above un fortunately the authors failed to do so thus the covari ance of cannot be identified namely the covariance of gordon optical metric is ambiguous depending on how to define the refractive index in a general inertial frame it should be indicated that gordon defined the proper refractive index n 0 by assuming that the medium is isotropic observed in the medium rest frame 42 however when a medium is moving it becomes anisotropic in general 45 and gordon s way to define n 0 is not valid to define the refractive index in a general inertial frame it also should be indicated that the way to define the refractive index in a general frame could essentially re vise the descriptions of light propagation for example in wang s theory where the refractive index in a uniform medium is defined in a general inertial frame propaga tion of light complies with fermat s principle in all iner tial frames 7 while in leonhardt s theory it does only in the special case of a medium at rest 46 1 l d landau and e m lifshitz the classical theory of fields butterworth heinemann ny 1975 2 s weinberg gravitation

constitute a lorentz four vector theorem 1 and b under what condition the time element space integral of a lorentz four vector is a lorentz scalar theorem 3 both theorem 1 and theorem 3 have their own sufficient and necessary conditions which have nothing to do with the divergence less symmetry and boundary conditions this point is especially important for example from theorem 1 we can directly judge that m ller s theorem is incorrect because the sufficient condition of m ller s theorem does not include the sufficient and necessary condition of theorem 1 as shown in counterexample eq 38 a similar argument is applicable to the invariant conservation law claimed by weinberg 2 p 40 as shown in counterexample eq 48 why is the constant total charge q in v resulting from 0 j t j not a lorentz invariant as shown in sec iv that is because q in v in frame xyz and q in v in frame zyx do not refer to the same total charge in the same volume physically where zyx moves at 0 c relatively to xyz this conclusion directly comes from the fact that the volume v in v xdt 3 is fixed in xyz and the volume v in 3 v xdt is fixed in zyx so that t and v and t and v are exchangeable respectively in order to make both dtdqxdtv 3 and 3 dtdqxdtv hold in general however according to einstein s relativity 20 v fixed in xyz is moving observed in zyx now v in 3 v xdt is at rest in zyx and thus v and v do not denote the same volume and q and q do not denote the same total charge therefore the current continuity equation 0 j cannot be taken as the invariant charge conservation law in relativity 2 p 40 as a practical application i have used theorem 1 to analyze minkowski em tensor for a plane light wave in a moving medium with einstein s light quantum hypothesis taken into account finding that the four momentum of quasi photon and the lorentz invariance of planck constant can be naturally derived see appendix b in relativity charge conservation law refers to that the total charge is a time and frame independent constant 2 p 41 while energy momentum conservation law refers to that the total energy and momentum constitute a covariant and time independent four vector 2 p 46 the problems of 0 and 0 as being conservation laws in relativity were first discovered in 6 7 and they are explicitly illustrated and generally resolved in the present paper these problems never got any attention in literature before the publications of 6 7 such as in the proofs of the positive mass theorem by schoen and yau 39 and by witten 33 and in the textbook of rindler 22 my manuscript has been greatly and carefully revised according to the referee reports from physical review d 1 23 referee a did not provide any specific criticisms and comments about novelty and originality and whether analysis and calculations support claimed conclusions referee b has two main points which constitute thought provoking challenges over the novelty and originality of my research work and took me a lot of time to understand point 1 referee b argues that rindler s book has already solved the problems about the traditional conservations laws point 2 referee b argues that in the proofs of the positive mass theorem rigorous mathematics has been used and loopholes possibly left in earlier works do not exist by careful analysis i find that rindler did not realize the problems of conservation laws not to speak of solving them while the positive mass theorem itself is based on the incorrect conservation law 0 t which is not just a loophole but an error that is not fixable i think that i have clarified the above two points in the revised manuscript and all detailed explanations are attached in response to referee b thank you for your precious time to review my paper sincerely changbiao wang attached response to referee b 2 24 response to referee b response to point 1 referee b argues that rindler s book has already solved the problems about the traditional conservations laws i am sorry i don t think so which is shown below i invariance of total charge in a closed physical system is the charge conservation law which means that the total charge is a time independent and frame independent constant it is a fundamental issue in the dynamics of relativity in his book prof rindler argues that in special relativity four current density cj j satisfies conservation of charge equation 0 jj copied below w rindler relativity oxford ny 2006 p 142 and the charge q xdcj 34 is lorentz invariant from frame to frame copied below w rindler relativity oxford ny 2006 p 140 note that any charged particle takes up a finite space however the conservation of charge equation 0 j is not a sufficient condition for q to be invariant from frame to frame apparently prof rindler did not realize this problem in appendix c of my paper a counterexample is given to show why 0 j is not a sufficient condition for q to be invariant from frame to frame the counterexample is the wave four vector ck w k for a plane wave in free space first shown by einstein with wk the wave vector 0 the angular frequency and cw k holding like the four current density cj j satisfying 0 j the wave four vector k also satisfies 0 k but vv xdcxdk 334 is not a lorentz invariant why this is physically explained in appendix c copied below 3 25 see appendix c of my paper from above we can see that prof rindler did not realize the problem of 0 j as being conservation of charge not to speak of solving this problem therefore in his book prof rindler did not provide a proper formulation of the charge conservation law in the frame of relativity ii the covariance of total four momentum in a closed physical system is the energy momentum conservation law which means that the total energy and momentum constitute a covariant and time independent four vector for a closed physical system it is also a fundamental issue in the dynamics of relativity in his book prof rindler argues that 0 tt is the energy momentum four conservation equations for a closed physical system in special relativity copied below w rindler relativity oxford ny 2006 p 298 however there is no definition that is provided for what is the total four momentum of the system since prof rindler did not provide the definition of total four momentum for the energy momentum tensor t that satisfies the conservation equation 0 t prof rindler did not provide a proper formulation of the covariance of total four momentum for a closed system the energy momentum conservation law in the frame of relativity 4 26 conclusion to point 1 in his book i prof rindler did not realize that the conservation of charge equation 0 j is not a sufficient condition for q xdcj 34 to be invariant from frame to frame ii prof rindler did not provide the definition of total four momentum based on the energy momentum tensor t for a closed system thus the issues about the invariance of total charge and the covariance of total four momentum for a closed system are not appropriately formulated in other words prof rindler did not solve the problems of 0 j and 0 t as being conservation laws in my revised manuscript i added ref 22 to answer this comment by referee b response to point 2 referee b argues that in the proofs of the positive mass theorem rigorous mathematics has been used and loopholes possibly left in earlier works do not exist i am sorry i don t think so because in the proofs of the positive mass theorem the traditional conservation law 0 t is employed in other words the proofs are based on a flawed theoretical framework which is shown below the theoretical framework used for the proofs are shown in arnowitt deser misner framework part 1 arnowitt deser misner framework part 2 arnowitt deser misner framework part 3 arnowitt deser misner framework part 4 the problem of the conservation law 0 t never got any attention in the proofs of the positive mass theorem by schoen and yau in 1979 and in 1981 witten and nester in 1981 parker and taubes in 1982 and gibbons and coworkers in 1983 all the proofs are based on a flawed theoretical framework set up by arnowitt deser and misner where the total energy momentum p in an asymptotically flat spacetime is required to obey the differential conservation law 0 t of the energy momentum tensor t and required to transform as a four vector see arnowitt deser misner framework part 2 however in fact the conservation law 0 t cannot guarantee that p is a four vector as shown in appendix d apparently this problem is ignored in all the proofs conclusion to point 2 the proofs of the positive mass theorem are based on a flawed theoretical framework where 0 t is taken to be the energy momentum conservation law and this problem has never got any attention in the community to answer this comment by referee b i greatly revised sec v and added appendix d 5 27 arnowitt deser misner framework part 1 r arnowitt s deser and c w misner phys rev 118 1100 1960 arnowitt deser misner framework part 1 according to arnowitt deser and misner the definition of the total energy momentum p is given by the volume integral of the components of 0 t namely xdtp 30 which can be expressed as surface integrals through einstein s field equations and gauss s theorem and where ep 0 is the total energy arnowitt deser misner framework part 2 r arnowitt s deser and c w misner phys rev 122 997 1961 arnowitt deser misner framework part 2 according to arnowitt deser and misner because of the conservation law 0 t p should transform as a four vector namely it is a four vector 6 28 arnowitt deser misner framework part 3 misner thorne and wheeler gravitation w h freeman and company sf 1973 p 443 arnowitt deser misner framework part 3 in this textbook it is claimed that 0 j makes xdjq 30 be an invariant and 0 t makes xdtp 30 be a constant four vector arnowitt deser misner framework part 4 misner thorne and wheeler gravitation w h freeman and company sf 1973 p 462 arnowitt deser misner framework part 4 here in this textbook xdtp 30 is once again clearly claimed as a four vector because of the source conservation laws 0 t t is the source term of einstein s field equations the total energy expression ep 0 is exactly the one used for the proofs of the positive mass theorem by schoen and yau witten and parker and taubes 7 29 schoen yau proof schoen and yau commun math phys 79 231
