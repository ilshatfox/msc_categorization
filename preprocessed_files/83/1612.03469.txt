develop ment of a cauchy hypersurface is governed by a wave equation derived as the result of a canonical quantization process to find physically interesting solutions of the wave equation we employ the separation of variables by considering a temporal eigenvalue problem which has a complete countable set of eigenfunctions with positive eigenvalues and also a spatial eigenvalue problem which has a complete set of eigendis tributions assuming that the cauchy hypersurface is asymtotically euclidean we prove that the temporal eigenvalues are also spatial eigen values and the product of corresponding eigenfunctions and eigendis tributions which will be smooth functions with polynomial growth are the physically interesting solutions of the wave equation we consider these solutions to describe the quantum development of the cauchy hypersurface contents 1 introduction 1 2 existence of a complete set of eigendistributions 5 3 properties of a in the asymptotically euclidean case 14 4 the quantization of the wave equation 16 references 18 1 introduction in general relativity the cauchy development of a cauchy hypersurface s 0 is governed by the einstein equations where of course the second fundamental form of s 0 has also to be specified in the model of quantum gravity we developed in a series of papers 6 7 4 8 9 10 we pick a cauchy hypersurface which is then only considered

potential of the higgs field a nega tive cosmological constant m a positive constant 1 2 are positive coupling constants and the other symbols should be self evident the existence of the time variable and its range is due to the quantization process 1 1 remark for the results and arguments in 9 it was completely ir relevant that the values of the higgs field lie in a lie algebra i e could also be just an arbitrary scalar field or we could consider a higgs field as well as an another arbitrary scalar field hence let us stipulate that the higgs field could also be just an arbitrary scalar field if s 0 is compact we also proved a spectral resolution of equation 1 1 by first considering a stationary version of the hyperbolic equation namely the elliptic eigenvalue equation 1 3 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ijv 2 n 4 ab ij a i b iv 2 n 2 mv v v it has countably many solutions vi i such that 1 4 0 1 2 1 5 lim i let v be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 0 then we looked at solutions of 1 1 of the form 1 6 u x t w t v x u is then a solution of 1 1 provided w satisfies the implicit eigenvalue equa tion 1 7 1 32 n 2 n 1 w t 2 4 nw nt 2 w 0 where is the eigenvalue quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 3 we proved in 9 that for any stationary eigenfunction vj with positive eigenvalue j there is complete sequence of eigenfunctions wij of the temporal implicit eigenvalue problem such that the functions 1 8 uij t x wij t vj x are solutions of the wave equation cf also 8 section 6 however for non compact cauchy hypersurfaces one has to use a different approach in order to quantize the wave equation 1 1 let us first consider the temporal eigenvalue equation 1 9 1 32 n 2 n 1 w n t 2 w t 2 4 nw in the sobolev space 1 10 h 1 2 0 r here 1 11 0 is the cosmological constant the eigenvalue problem 1 9 can be solved by considering the generalized eigenvalue problem for the bilinear forms 1 12 b w w r 1 32 n 2 n 1 w w n t 2 w w and 1 13 k w w r t 2 4 n w w in the sobolev space h which is the completion of 1 14 c c r c in the norm defined by the first bilinear form we then look at the generalized eigenvalue problem 1 15 b w k w h which is equivalent to 1 9 1 2 theorem the eigenvalue problem 1 15 has countably many solu tions wi i such that 1 16 0 0 1 2 1 17 lim i and 1 18 k wi wj ij the wi are complete in h as well as in l 2 r 4 claus gerhardt secondly let a be the elliptic operator on the left hand side of 1 3 assuming that its coefficients are smooth and bounded in any 1 19 cm s 0 m n then a is self adjoint in l 2 s 0 c and if s 0 is asymptotically euclidean i e if it satisfies the very mild conditions in assumption 3 1 on page 14 then the schwartz space s of rapidly decreasing functions can also be defined in s 0 1 20 s s s 0 such that 1 21 s l 2 s 0 s is a gelfand triple and the eigenvalue problem in s 1 22 af f has a solution for any a cf theorem 2 5 on page 9 let 1 23 e a be the set of eigendistributions in s satisfying 1 24 af f f e then the f are actually smooth functions in s 0 with polynomial growth cf 10 theorem 3 moreover due to a result of donnelly 1 we know that 1 25 0 ess a hence any temporal eigenvalue i in theorem 1 2 is also a spatial eigenvalue of a in s 1 26 af i if i since the eigenspaces e i are separable we deduce that for each i there is an at most countable basis of eigendistributions in e i 1 27 vij fj i 1 j n i satisfying 1 28 avij ivij 1 29 vij c s 0 s s 0 the functions 1 30 uij wivij are then smooth solutions of the wave equations they are considered to describe the quantum development of the cauchy hypersurface s 0 let us summarize this result as a theorem quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 5 1 3 theorem let a and s 0 satisfy the conditions in 1 19 and assump tion 3 1 and let wi resp vij be the countably many solutions of the temporal resp spatial eigenvalue problems then 1 31 uij wivij are smooth solutions of the wave equation 1 1 they describe the quantum development of the cauchy hypersurface s 0 1 4 remark we used a similar approach to describe the quantum de velopment of the event horizon of an ads blackhole see 11 2 existence of a complete set of eigendistributions let h be a separable hilbert space s a complete nuclear space and 2 1 j s h an embedding such that j s is dense in h the triple 2 2 s h s is then called a gelfand triple and h a rigged hilbert space moreover we require that the semi norms p defining the topology of s are a countable family in view of the assumption 2 1 at least of one the semi norms is already a norm since there exist a constant c and a semi norm p such that 2 3 j c p s hence p is a norm since j is injective but then there exists an equiva lent sequence of norms generating the topology of s since s is nuclear we may also assume that the norms are derived from a scalar product cf 12 theorem 2 p 292 let sp be the completion of s with respect to p then 2 4 s p 1 sp and 2 5 s p 1 s p a nuclear space s having these properties is called a nuclear countably hilbert space or a nuclear fre chet hilbert space let a be a self adjoint operator in h with spectrum 2 6 a identifying s with j s we assume 2 7 a s s 6 claus gerhardt and we want to prove that for any there exists 2 8 0 6 f s satisfying 2 9 f a f s f is then called a generalized eigenvector or an eigendistribution if s is a space of distributions the crucial point is that we need to prove the existence of a generalized eigenvector for any 2 1 definition we define 2 10 e f s af f to be the generalized eigenspace of a with eigenvalue provided 2 11 e 6 0 if 2 11 is valid for all then we call 2 12 e a complete system of generalized eigenvectors of a in s 2 2 lemma if s is separable then each e 6 0 is also separable in the inherited strong topology of s proof the hilbert spaces sp are all separable by assumption so are their duals s p let bp be a countable dense subset of s p and set 2 13 b p 1 bp then b is dense in s in the strong topology indeed consider f s and a bounded subset b s then there exists p such that f s p in view of 2 5 and for any g bp we obtain 2 14 sup b f g f g p sup b p cb f g p proving the claim let e be the spectral measure of a mapping borel sets of to projections in h then we can find an at most countable family of mutually orthogonal unit vectors 2 15 vi h 1 i m and mutually orthogonal subspaces 2 16 hi h which are generated by the vectors 2 17 e vi b quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 7 where is an arbitrary borel set in such that 2 18 h m i 1 hi each subspace hi is isomorphic to the function space 2 19 h i l 2 c i l 2 i where i is the positive borel measure 2 20 i evi vi we have 2 21 i 1 and there exists a unitary u from hi onto h i such that 2 22 u v u v d i u v hi where we have set 2 23 u uu u hi hence there exists a unitary surjective operator also denoted by u 2 24 u h h m i 1 h i such that u ui is mapped to 2 25 u uu uui u i and 2 26 u i u i l 2 i moreover if u d a then 2 27 a u a u i u i u for a proof of these well known results see e g 2 chap i appendix p 127 2 3 remark we define the positive measure 2 28 m i 1 2 i i in and we shall always have this measure in mind when referring to null sets in moreover applying the radon nikodym theorem we conclude that there are non negative borel functions which we express in the form h 2 i 0 hi such that 2 29 h 2 i l 1 8 claus gerhardt and 2 30 d i h 2 i d the map 2 31 v l 2 i hiv l 2 is a unitary embedding 2 4 lemma the functions hi satisfy the following relations 2 32 m i 1 2 2 ih 2 i a e and 2 33 m i 1 2 2 ih 2 i 6 0 a e replacing the values of hi on the exceptional null sets by 2 i the two previous relations are valid everywhere in proof i we first prove that for a fixed i hi cannot vanish on a borel set g with positive i measure i g 0 we argue by contradiction assuming that hi would vanish on a borel set g with i g 0 let v h be arbitrary and let vi be the component belonging to hi then 2 34 g v i 2 d i g v i 2 d i gh 2 i v i 2 d 0 and we deduce 2 35 v i 0 i a e in g v h a contradiction since the v i generate l 2 i ii now let g be an arbitrary borel set satisfying g 0 and define i by setting 2 36 i g 2 i then we obtain 2 37 2 m i 1 g 2 2 id i m i 1 g 2 2 ih 2 i d concluding 2 38 m i 1 2 2 ih 2 i a e quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 9 as well as 2 39 m i 1 2 2 ih 2 i 6 0 a e where the last conclusion is due to the result proved in i since there must existst an i such that i g 0 now we can prove 2 5 theorem let h be a separable rigged hilbert space as above assum ing that the nuclear space s is a fre chet hilbert space and let a be a self adjoint operator in h satisfying 2 7 then there exists a complete system of generalized eigenvectors e if s is separable then each eigenspace e is separable proof since s is nuclear there exists a norm p such that the embedding 2 40 j sp h is nuclear i e we can write 2 41 j k 1 k fk uk s where 2 42 0 k k 1 k 2 43 fk s p fk 1 and uk h is an orthonormal sequence we may and shall also assume 2 44 uk d a since d a is dense in h let 2 45 vk d a be a sequence of linearly independent vectors generating a dense subspace in h then we can define an orthonormal basis v k in h which spans the same subspace hence there exists a unitary map t such that 2 46 v k tuk k n instead of the embedding j we can then consider the embedding 2 47 t j proving our claim thus we shall assume 2 44 which is convenient but not necessary we immediately infer from the assumption that j s is dense in h the following conclusions 2 48 the uk are complete in h 10 claus gerhardt 2 49 0 k k and 2 50 for all k there exists s such that fk 6 0 let u be the unitary operator in 2 24 then we define 2 51 u j k 1 k fk u k such that 2 52 u k u i k 1 i m 2 53 u ik l 2 i applying the embedding in 2 31 we can also express u k in the form 2 54 u k hiu i k 1 i m 2 55 hiu i k l 2 similarly we have 2 56 hi i and 2 57 a hi i in view of 2 27 here we identify and j i e 2 58 a a j we want to prove that 2 59 a j k 1 k fk a uk k 1 k fk u k indeed for any bounded borel set 2 60 ae is a self adjoint bounded operator in h such that 2 61 ae sup hence we deduce 2 62 ae j k 1 k fk ae uk and 2 63 ae uk u k quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 11 and we infer 2 64 a j k 1 k fk u k since is an arbitrary bounded borel set we conclude 2 65 a j k 1 k fk u k the right hand side of the second equation is square integrable and therefore the right hand side of the first equation too let us set 2 66 hi i hi i is an equivalence class and to define hi i as a complex number for a fixed requires to pick a representative of the equivalence class in order to define hi i it is well known that for a given representative hi i is well defined for almost every i e apart from a null set we shall show that can be well defined for any and any s the choices we shall have to make will be independent of firstly let us define the product 2 67 hiu i k unambiguously in view of lemma 2 4 hi is everywhere finite i e we only have to consider the case when hi 0 and u i k in this case we stipulate that 2 68 hiu i k 0 this definition insures that the integrals e g 2 69 hiu i k 2 d will give the correct values because of lebesgue s monotone convergence theorem approximate u ik by 2 70 min u ik r r n secondly we observe that 2 71 1 u k 2 m i 1 hiu i k 2 and hence 2 72 m i 1 hiu k i 2 a e in 12 claus gerhardt thirdly we have 2 73 k 1 m i 1 hiu i k 2 6 0 a e in indeed suppose there were a borel set 2 74 g such that 2 75 0 g i 2 i i g and 2 76 k 1 m i 1 hiu i k 2 0 in g then there would exist j such that 2 77 j g 0 and we would deduce 2 78 0 k 1 g hj u j k 2 d k 1 g u j k 2 d j contradicting the fact that the u j k are a basis for l 2 j fourthly we have 2 79 k i k hiu i k 2 d k k u k 2 k k hence we deduce 2 80 k i k hiu i k 2 a e in now for any i k we choose a particular representative of hiu i k by first picking the representative of hi we defined in lemma 2 4 and a representative of u ik satisfying the relations in 2 72 2 73 and 2 80 and then defining the values of these particular representatives in the exceptional null sets occurring in the just mentioned relations by 2 81 hi 2 i u ik 2 i 2 k then hiu i k is well defined for any and the relations in 2 72 2 73 and 2 80 are valid for any moreover the series 2 82 hi i k k fk hiu i k quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 13 converges absolutely since 2 83 k k fk hiu i k p k k hiu i k p k k 1 2 k k hiu i k 2 1 2 in view of 2 80 2 6 definition let us define the sequence space 2 84 l 2 a i k k i aik 2 with scalar product 2 85 aik b i k k i a ikb i k thus we have 2 86 k fk hiu i k l 2 since 2 87 2 k k for k large by a slight abuse of language we shall also call this sequence 2 88 k fk hiu i k we are now ready to complete the proof of the theorem let be arbitrary then there exists a pair i 0 k 0 such that 2 89 hi 0 u i 0 k 0 6 0 in view of 2 73 which is now valid for any define 2 90 f hi 0 u i 0 k 0 l 2 to be the sequence with just one non trivial term we may consider 2 91 f s p s by defining 2 92 f f s where the right hand side is the scalar product in l 2 indeed we obtain 2 93 f k 0 fk 0 hi 0 u i 0 k 0 2 k 0 hi 0 u i 0 k 0 2 2 p s yielding 2 94 f s p 14 claus gerhardt furthermore 2 95 f 6 0 since there exists s such that 2 96 fk 0 6 0 in view of 2 50 f is also a generalized eigenvector of a with eigenvalue since 2 97 f a f a f f because of 2 57 and 2 59 the final conclusions are derived from lemma 2 2 3 properties of a in the asymptotically euclidean case let a be the elliptic operator 3 1 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ijv 2 n 4 abg ij ai b iv 2 n 2 mv v we want to prove that 3 2 0 a in order to be able to quantize the wave equation 1 1 on page 2 using the results in 1 we shall show that 3 2 or even the stronger result 3 3 0 ess a where ess a is the essential spectrum is valid provided the following as sumptions are satisfied 3 1 assumption we assume there exists a compact k s 0 and a coordinate system xi covering s 0 k such that s 0 k is diffeomorphic with an exterior region 3 4 rn and 3 5 x xi the metric gij then has to satisfy 3 6 lim x gij x ij 3 7 lim x gij k x 0 where a comma indicates partial differentiation and there is a constant c such that 3 8 cr x c 1 r x where r is the geometric distance to a base point p k quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 15 furthermore we require that the lower order terms of a vanish at infinity i e 3 9 lim x r fijf ij abg ij a i b i v 0 let us refer the lower order terms with the symbol v v x such that 3 10 a n 1 v then we shall prove 3 2 theorem the operator a in 3 10 has the property 3 11 0 ess a proof we first prove the result for the operator v let us define a positive function 3 12 b c s 0 such that 3 13 b x x x 6 br p where br p is a large geodesic ball containing the compact set k in view of the assumptions 3 6 3 7 and 3 8 b satisfies the conditions i ii and iii in 1 properties 2 1 moreover the assumption 3 9 which implies 3 14 lim x v 0 insures that the condition iv in 1 theorem 2 4 can be applied yielding 3 15 0 ess v however since only the inclusion 3 16 0 ess v is proved while the reverse inclusion is merely referred to and we could not look at the given references we shall only use 3 16 this relation is proved by constructing for each 0 and 0 an infinite dimensional subspace g of c 2 c s 0 such that 3 17 m v 2 v 2 2 m v 2 v g multiplying this inequality by n 1 2 we infer that 3 16 is also valid when the operator v is replaced by 3 18 a n 1 v proving the theorem 16 claus gerhardt 4 the quantization of the wave equation the quantization of the hyperbolic equation 1 1 on page 2 will be achieved by splitting the equation into two equations a temporal eigenvalue equation an ode and a spatial elliptic eigenvalue equation let us first consider the temporal eigenvalue equation 4 1 1 32 n 2 n 1 w n t 2 w t 2 4 nw in the sobolev space 4 2 h 1 2 0 r here 4 3 0 is a cosmological constant the eigenvalue problem 4 1 can be solved by considering the generalized eigenvalue problem for the bilinear forms 4 4 b w w r 1 32 n 2 n 1 w w n t 2 w w and 4 5 k w w r t 2 4 n w w in the sobolev space h which is the completion of 4 6 c c r c in the norm defined by the first bilinear form we then look at the generalized eigenvalue problem 4 7 b w k w h which is equivalent to 4 1 4 1 theorem the eigenvalue problem 4 7 has countably many solu tions wi i such that 4 8 0 0 1 2 4 9 lim i and 4 10 k wi wj ij the wi are complete in h as well as in l 2 r quantum development of a cauchy hypersurface 17 proof the quadratic form k is compact with respect to the quadratic form b as one can easily prove cf 3 lemma 6 8 and hence a proof of the result except for the strict inequalities in 4 8 can be found in 5 theorem 1 6 3 p 37 each eigenvalue has multiplicity one since we have a linear ode of order two and all solutions satisfy the boundary condition 4 11 wi 0 0 the kernel is two dimensional and the condition 4 11 defines a one dimen sional subspace note that we considered only real valued solutions to apply this argument the elliptic eigenvalue equation has the form 4 12 av v where a is the elliptic operator in 3 1 on page 14 and v c s 0 a is a self adjoint operator in l 2 s 0 c let 4 13 s s s 0 be the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions then s is a separable nuclear fre chet hilbert space and 4 14 s l 2 s 0 c s a gelfand triple applying the results of theorem 2 5 on page 9 we infer that there exists a complete system of eigendistributions 4 15 e a in s i e 4 16 af f f e these eigendistributions are actually smooth functions in s 0 with polynomial growth as we proved in 10 theorem 3 assuming furthermore that the conditions in assumption 3 1 on page 14 are satisfied we conclude that 4 17 0 ess a in view of theorem 3 2 on page 15 i e the equation 4 12 is valid for all r and we conclude further that each temporal eigenvalue i of the equation 4 1 can also be looked at as a spatial eigenvalue of the equation 4 12 since the eigenspaces e i are separable we deduce that for each i there is an at most countable basis of eigendistributions in e i 4 18 vij fj i 1 j n i satisfying 4 19 avij ivij 4 20 vij c s 0 s s 0 the functions 4 21 uij wivij 18 claus gerhardt are then smooth solutions of the wave

and let wi resp vij be the countably many solutions of the temporal resp spatial eigenvalue problems then 4 22 uij wivij are smooth solutions of the wave equation they describe the quantum devel
