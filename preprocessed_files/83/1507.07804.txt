vector as electromagnetic power flow has prevailed over one hundred years in the community however in this paper it is shown from maxwell equations that the poynting vector may not represent the electromagnetic power flow for a plane wave in a non dispersive lossless non conducting anisotropic uniform medium this important conclusion revises the conventional understanding of poynting vector

medium maxwell equations fermat s principle pacs nos 03 50 de 41 20 q 1 introduction an electromagnetic em plane wave although not practical is a simplest strict solution of maxwell equations and it is often used to explore most fundamental physics for example einstein used it to develop his special theory of relativity and derived the well known relativistic doppler formula 1 in conventional em wave theory poynting vector as em power flow the rate of flow of energy per unit area per unit time has been thought to be a well established basic concept 2 7 in view of the existence of some kind of mathematical ambiguity for this concept some scientists suggested it to be a hypothesis until a clash with new experimental evidence shall call for its revision 2 however this conventional concept has been questioned from various perspectives 8 10 nevertheless recently some scientists have proposed it to be a postulate for resolution of the long lasting abraham minkowski controversy 11 12 this situation is very confusing in this paper from maxwell equations it is shown that the poynting vector does not necessarily represent the em power flow for a monochromatic plane wave in a non dispersive lossless non conducting anisotropic uniform medium this important conclusion revises the basic concept which has prevailed over one hundred years it is also shown that this conclusion is clearly supported by fermat s principle and special theory of relativity 2 proof as a basic concept of em wave theory the correctness of poynting vector as em power flow should withstand any tests of em waves especially the test of a monochromatic plane wave because the poynting vector consists of the em fields satisfying maxwell equations while a monochromatic plane wave satisfies the maxwell equations in a non dispersive lossless non conducting anisotropic uniform medium for a monochromatic plane wave with a phase function xk dnt the maxwell equations are simplified into ekb dn hkd dn 1 0 bkdn 0 dkdn 2 where cos 0000 h b d ehb d e with 0 e 0 d 0 b and 0 h being the real constant vectors is the frequency kdn is the wave vector and cnn dd k is the refractive index of medium with c the vacuum light speed and kdn are real because the medium is assumed to be lossless and non conducting by making cross products of ekbk dd nn and hkdk dd nn from eq 1 with vector identity cbabcac ba taken into account we have email address changbiao wang yahoo com 2 bvnene ph 3 dvnhnh ph 4 where knv dph n is the phase velocity and kkn dd nn is the unit wave vector by making inner products of ekbh dn and hkde dn from eq 1 with ekh dn hke dn taken into account we have hbde setting hes poynting vector and 5 0 hbde emw em energy density from eqs 3 and 4 we obtain pseupower sss 5 where phemphpower w vbdvs 2 6 devbhvs phphpseu 7 and they are perpendicular each other pseupower ss from eq 6 we see that powers carries all the em energy emw and propagates at the phase velocity phv thus powers is the real power flow and pseus is the pseudo power flow the physical difference between powers and pseus also can be seen from the divergence theorem from eq 6 we have 0 powers except for those discrete points while the time average 0 powers which means that powers is responsible for a power flowing in and out in a differential box and the powers going in and out are the same on time average with no net energy left in the box in contrast from eq 7 we have 0 pseus holding due to 0 b 0 d kb dn and kd dn mathematically the expression 0 pseus intself can imply that pseus is responsible for transporting a time independent energy density pseuw namely 0 twpseupseus but the total em energy density is given by 5 0 hbde emw and from the energy conservation emempseu www 0 pseuw thus for the plane wave pseus is not responsible for any power flowing at any time for any places that is why pseus is called pseudo power flow in an isotropic medium including empty space poynting vector is parallel to the wave vector leading to 0 pseus and powerss thus the poynting vector always represents the power flow in an electro anisotropic uniaxial medium which is the simplest anisotropic medium for any given propagation direction there are two kinds of waves ordinary wave and extraordinary wave 13 for the ordinary wave with kh dn and ke dn both holding poynting vector is parallel to the wave vector kdn leading to 0 pseus thus the poynting vector represents the power flow for the extraordinary wave except for those special cases where kdn is parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis z as shown in fig 1 poynting vector is not parallel to the wave vector kdn leading to 0 pseus thus the poynting vector does not represent the power flow in short the poynting vector does not necessarily represent the power flow in an anisotropic medium now let us examine the justification of powers as the power flow from energy conservation the em energy conservation equation for a plane wave is given by t wem s 8 in principle em field solutions can be obtained by solving maxwell equations associated with their boundary conditions without any ambiguity however there does be some ambiguity for the definition of power flow in terms of above eq 8 traditionally hes is defined as the power flow 2 7 however by adding a term with a zero divergence to s eq 8 will not be affected for example inserting pseupower sss into eq 8 with 0 pseus taken into account we have the same form conservation equation t wem power s 9 3 wave vector e d b b ndk optical axis z b h b b fig 1 general space relations between em fields e d b h wave vector kdn and optical axis z for extraordinary wave in an electro anisotropic uniaxial medium 13 kb dn and eb from ekb dn bh from hb with the constant scalar permeability kd dn and hd from hkd dn d e kdn and the optical axis z lie on the same plane kbd dn holds and poynting vector hes is not parallel to the wave vector kdn except for or kdn the optical axis z 1 thus we can re define powers as the power flow for an isotropic medium 0 pseus and powerss and this re definition has no effect from above analysis we can see that from the viewpoint of em energy conservation s and powers have the equal right to be the power flow however s as being em power flow may contain a unphysical pseudo power flow while powers does not from this perspective it is justifiable to take powers as the correct power flow in an anisotropic medium crystal fermat s principle is an additional physical condition imposed on the direction of em energy transport the medium which supports a plane wave is uniform 0 xdn but it can be isotropic or anisotropic according to the fermat s principle the optical length of an actual ray from one equi phase plane to the next is the one to make dsndsn dd the minimum 3 p 115 when ds is equal to the distance between the equi phase planes dsnd reaches the minimum thus the actual ray or the direction of energy transport must be parallel to the wave vector powers is parallel to the wave vector while pseus is perpendicular to the wave vector if powers is defined as the power flow fermat s principle is automatically satisfied thus powers as power flow is also required by fermat s principle it might be interesting to point out that if 0 pseus can be of em power flow a superluminal power flow could be constructed given by pseuc asss where a is an arbitrary constant with ss c for 0 a and powerc ss for 1 a obviously c s satisfies energy conservation eq 8 due to c ss since powerpseu ss holds we have 222 1 1 pseupower emem c a ww ss s 10 from this we have cwemc s holding for 0 pseus by a proper choice of a value which clearly is not consistent with the special theory of relativity 1 3 conclusions in summary we have shown that the poynting vector may not represent the em power flow for a plane wave in a non dispersive lossless non conducting anisotropic uniform 1 note when the wave vector kdn is parallel or perpendicular to the optical axis z we have de holding resulting in hes parallel to kdn which is shown as follows since ed t with zdiag t the constant permittivity diagonal tensor 13 we have zzyx eeed from 0 d we have kd dn holding a if znd k holds we have kd dn 0 zz dd 0 ze eeed yx namely de holds for znd k b if znd k holds we have kd dn z d because d kdn and z lie on the same plane for the extraordinary wave required by eigen wave equation 0 2 ekke dd nn t resulting from eq 1 13 further we have 0 yxz ddd 0 yx ee zzed namely de also holds for znd k 4 medium which means that the conventional understanding of poynting vector 2 7 should be revised however it should be emphasized that the poynting vector surface integral as d as dpower is always equal to the total em power no
