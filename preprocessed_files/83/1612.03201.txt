comment on resolution of the abraham minkowski dilemma disproof of a widely accepted mathematical conjecture changbiao wang shanggang group 70 huntington road apartment 11 new haven ct 06512 usa a mathematical conjecture is successfully identified which is used for relativistic analysis of dielectric einstein box thought experiment in a letter ramos rubilar and obukhov phys lett a 375 1703 2011 where the authors conjecture without any citations that the symmetry and divergence less property of a lorentz 4 tensor is a sufficient condition for the time column space integrals to constitute a lorentz 4 vector this mathematical conjecture has been thought to be a mathematical fact the validity of which was shown well in textbooks however in this paper we indicate that this conjecture has never been proved mathematically by enumerating a counterexample we find that this mathematical conjecture is flawed and it is not persuasive to use a flawed mathematical conjecture as a starting point to resolve abraham minkowski controversy over light momentum in a dielectric medium we also indicate that this flawed mathematical conjecture is actually a widely accepted conjecture in the dynamics of relativity in textbooks for many decades to eliminate a misunderstanding of this flawed conjecture in the community we provide a detailed elucidation of why m ller s mathematical statement also called m ller s version of von laue s theorem only defines a trivial zero 4 vector for an electromagnetic stress energy lorentz 4 tensor pacs numbers 03 50 de 03 30 p key words mathematical conjecture light momentum in media electromagnetic stress energy tensor abraham minkowski controversy special theory of relativity i introduction the momentum of light in a dielectric medium is a fundamental problem in physics so called abraham minkowski controversy to resolve this controversy various postulates and assumptions or even mathematical conjectures are invoked for example mansuripur and zakharian postulate that poynting vector represents the electromagnetic em power flow in any system of materials and claim that the abraham momentum is the sole electromagnetic momentum in any system of materials distributed throughout the free space 1 brevik assumes that abraham force is the correct em force in a medium and claims that abraham force simply fluctuates out when averaged over an optical period in a stationary beam but it is in principle measurable 2 however both mansuripur zakharian postulate and brevik s assumption are challenged based on the momentum energy conservation law when a plane wave propagates in a uniform medium 3 4 in a beautiful letter aimed to resolve abraham minkowski controversy a relativistic analysis is given of dielectric einstein box thought experiment also called balazs thought experiment 5 the authors conjecture without any citations that the symmetry and divergence less property of a lorentz 4 tensor is a sufficient condition for the time column space integrals to constitute a lorentz 4 vector this conjecture is thought to be a mathematical fact the validity of which was shown well in textbooks in this paper we would like to indicate that this conjecture has never been proved mathematically by enumerating a counterexample this mathematical conjecture is disproved the disproof is given below after a total tensor is constructed ramos rubilar and obukhov declare a 4 momentum vector based on an implicit assumption as shown in fig 1 from fig 1 we can see that the authors implicitly assume that if the total tensor t is symmetric and divergence less 0 t due to 0 ext j the time column space integrals v dvtp 0 must constitute a lorentz 4 vector if putting aside the physical explanations assigned by the authors the above ramos rubilar obukhov implicit assumption is equivalent to a mathematical conjecture as stated below mathematical conjecture if tx defined in v is a lorentz 4 tensor of which all the elements have first order partial derivatives with respect to time space coordinates ctx x and it is symmetric and divergence less 00 then the time row column space integrals assumed to be convergent vv xdxd 3434 1 constitute a lorentz 4 vector changbiao wang yahoo com 1 mailto changbiao wang yahoo com fig 1 copied paragraphs to show the basic implicit assumption made by ramos rubilar and obukhov in 5 this assumption is equivalent to a mathematical conjecture if a lorentz 4 tensor is symmetric and divergence less then the space integrals of time column elements constitute a lorentz 4 vector note that it is not easy to identify this conjecture because the authors did not provide any citations and the authors did not clearly explain why they can obtain the total 4 momentum just by integrating the conservation equation as we know the correctness of a mathematical conjecture cannot be legitimately affirmed by enumerating specific examples no matter how many however it can be directly negated by finding specific examples even only one in the following given is such a counterexample that disproves the above mathematical conjecture ii counterexample we will show that a charged metal sphere in free space is the right counterexample to disprove the mathematical conjecture by ramos rubilar and obukhov from the potential 4 vector a 6 we have the field strength 4 tensor given by aaf or 0 0 0 0 cecece cebb cebb cebb f zyx zxy yxz xyz 2 the maxwell equations dtdh ccc cj can be written as jg 6 where 0 0 0 0 cdcdcd cdhh cdhh cdhh gggg zyx zxy yxz xyz 3 with 1 1 1 1 diaggg being the minkowski metric the lorentz covariant minkowski electromagnetic em stress energy 4 tensor is defined as 2 fggfgg 4 1 or emm am wc c g gt 4 where 2 ca heg is the abraham momentum bdg m is the minkowski momentum 5 0 hbed emw is the em energy density and 5 0 hbedibhdet m is the minkowski stress tensor with i the unit tensor 2 edhb fg is a lorentz invariant from eq 4 we have fgfgjf 4 1 5 suppose that there is a charged metal sphere in free space with a radius of 0 r and a charge of 0 q and the metal sphere is made from perfect conductor so that the em fields within the sphere rr are equal to zero in free space ed 0 and hb 0 hold where 0 and 0 are the permittivity and permeability constants in vacuum respectively thus for the charged metal sphere observed in the sphere rest frame we have edde 0 hbbh 0 and ma gg 0 holding in the field distribution region rr leading to from eq 4 on the other hand a there are no current 0 j and no charge 0 in the region rr leading to 0 cj j b the region rr is filled with a medium of vacuum leading to 025 0 fgfg 7 thus we have 0 j and 025 0 fgfg 0 from eq 5 to put it simply for the charged metal sphere we have i is symmetric and ii is divergence less 0 satisfying the sufficient condition required by ramos rubilar obukhov mathematical conjecture according to the conjecture or eq 1 v xd 34 v em v m xdwxdc 33 g 6 must be a lorentz 4 vector where vv xdcxdc am 33 gg 0 3 v xdche and vv xdxdwem 33 5 0 hbed 8 0 2 rq however it has been shown in general that in free space the total abraham minkowski electromagnetic momentum and energy for the electrostatic field cannot constitute a lorentz 4 vector namely v xd 34 is not a lorentz 4 vector at all 7 8 thus the mathematical conjecture by ramos rubilar and obukhov is not true iii conclusions and remarks in summary we have successfully identified a mathematical conjecture implicitly used in the letter by ramos rubilar and obukhov for resolution of abraham minkowski controversy 5 by enumerating a counterexample we have shown that the symmetry and divergence less property of a lorentz 4 tensor tx is not a sufficient condition for the time row column space integrals v xd 34 v xd 34 to constitute a lorentz 4 vector accordingly we believe that ramos rubilar obukhov mathematical conjecture is flawed and it is not persuasive to use this flawed conjecture as a starting point for relativistic analysis of einstein box thought experiment to resolve abraham minkowski controversy 5 we also believe that ramos rubilar obukhov conjecture is actually the weinberg s conjecture as indicated in ref 7 where both weinberg s and landau lifshitz conjectures are shown to be flawed it should be noted that compared with weinberg s mathematical conjecture ramos rubilar obukhov conjecture is more difficult to be identified as seen in fig 1 that is because a the authors did not cite any references and b the authors did not clearly tell why they can obtain the total 4 momentum just by integrating the conservation equation it is usually argued in the community that m ller provided an absolutely rigorous proof of ramos rubilar obukhov conjecture unfortunately this is a misunderstanding m ller s mathematical statement also called m ller s version of von laue s theorem 7 is completely different from ramos rubilar obukhov conjecture in m ller s statement the divergence less plus a zero boundary condition of a tensor is taken as the sufficient condition while the symmetry is not required in contrast in ramos 3 rubilar obukhov conjecture the divergence less plus a symmetry is taken as the sufficient condition while no any boundary conditions are imposed m ller s zero boundary condition requires that all the tensor elements be equal to zero on the boundary for any time t in the case of an em stress energy tensor given by eq 4 m ller s zero boundary condition requires 0 on the boundary for any time including 0 cc a heg 0 he on the boundary for any time t physically m ller s sufficient condition is extremely strong and severe because it requires that a within the finite domain v of a physical system there are no any sources 0 and b the em energy never flows through the closed boundary of v for any time 0 0 he for t thus this physical system is never provided with any em energy in terms of energy conservation law no em fields can be supported within the domain v in such a case leading to a zero field solution thus m ller s mathematical statement only defines a trivial zero 4 vector for an em stress energy tensor that is why the application of m ller s mathematical statement is very limited 7 nevertheless one may persist that ramos rubilar obukhov mathematical conjecture is actually not a conjecture but a mathematical fact the validity of which was shown well in textbooks however that is not true the fact is that although ramos rubilar obukhov or weinberg s conjecture is a widely accepted conjecture in the dynamics of relativity in textbooks for many decades 8 its validity has never been confirmed instead its validity has been proved to be false in the present paper and in 7 8 references 1 m mansuripur and a zakharian maxwell s macroscopic
