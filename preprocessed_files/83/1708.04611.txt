where all rotational parameters are equal resulting in a wave equation in a quantum spacetime which has a sequence of solutions that can be expressed as a product of station ary and temporal eigenfunctions the stationary eigenfunctions can be interpreted as radiation and the temporal as gravitational waves the event horizon corresponds in the quantum model to a cauchy hyper surface that can be crossed by causal curves in both directions such that the information paradox does not occur we also prove that the kerr ads spacetime can be maximally extended by replacing in a gen eralized boyer lindquist coordinate system the r variable by r 2 such that the extended spacetime has a timelike curvature singularity in a 2 contents 1 introduction 1 2 preparations 5 3 the quantization 11

present in the einstein equations then the equation would contain further lower order terms cf 8 but a negative cosmological constant would always have to be present even if the einstein equations would only describe the vacuum using separation of variables we proved that there is a complete sequence of eigenfunctions vj or a complete set of eigendistributions of a stationary eigenvalue problem and a complete sequence of eigenfunctions wi of a tem poral implicit eigenvalue problem where plays the role of an eigenvalue such that the functions 1 3 u t x wi t vj x are solutions of the wave equation cf 7 section 6 and 8 9 in a recent paper 10 we applied this model to quantize a schwarzschild ads spacetime and we shall prove in the present paper that similar arguments can also be used to quantize a kerr ads spacetime with a rotating black hole we consider an odd dimensional kerr ads spacetime n dimn 2 m 1 m 2 where all rotational parameters are equal 1 4 ai a 1 i m and where we also set 1 5 n 2 m replacing the r coordinate in a generalized boyer lindquist coordinate sys tem by 1 6 r 2 we shall prove that in the new coordinate system the metric is smooth in the interval 1 7 a 2 and that the extended spacetime n has a timelike curvature singularity in a 2 cf lemma 3 5 on page 17 for the quantization we first assume that there is a non empty interior black hole region b which is bounded by two horizons 1 8 b r 1 r r 2 the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 3 where the outer horizon is the event horizon picking a cauchy hypersurface in b of the form 1 9 r const we shall prove that the induced metric of the cauchy hypersurface can be expressed in the form 1 10 ds 2 d 2 ijdx idxj where 1 11 r const and ij is a smooth riemannian metric on s 2 m 1 depending on r a and the cosmological constant 0 the metric in 1 10 is free of any coordinate singularity hence we can let r tend to r 2 such that the cauchy hypersurfaces converge to a riemannian manifold s 0 which represents the event horizon at least topologically furthermore the laplacian of the metric in 1 10 comprises a harmonic oscillator with respect to which enables us to write the stationary eigenfunctions vj in the form 1 12 vj x j x where j is an eigenfunction of the elliptic operator 1 13 n 1 n 2 r where 1 14 m and an eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator the frequency of which are still to be determined due to the presence of the harmonic oscillator we can now consider an explicit temporal eigenvalue problem i e we consider the eigenvalue problem 1 15 1 32 n 2 n 1 w n t 2 w t 2 4 nw with a fixed 0 where we choose to be the cosmological constant of the kerr ads spacetime the eigenvalue problem 1 15 has a complete sequence wi i of eigen functions with finite energies i such that 1 16 0 0 1 and by choosing the frequencies of appropriately we can arrange that the stationary eigenvalues j of vj agree with the temporal eigenvalues i if this is the case then the eigenfunctions 1 17 u wivj will be a solution of the wave equation more precisely we proved 4 claus gerhardt 1 1 theorem let j j resp wi i be eigenfunctions of the elliptic operator in 1 13 resp the temporal eigenfunctions and for a given index j let i 0 be the smallest eigenvalue of the i with the property 1 18 i 0 j then for any i i 0 there exists 1 19 ij 0 and corresponding ij satisfying 1 20 ij 2 ij such that 1 21 i ij 2 ij j i i 0 the functions 1 22 uij wi ij j are then solutions of the wave equation with bounded energies satisfying 1 23 lim t 0 uij t lim t uij t 0 and 1 24 uij c r s 0 c

1 29 a 2 2 in n where 1 30 2 r 2 2 to the region 1 31 s 0 0 1 while the part 1 32 2 the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 5 is represented by 1 33 s 0 1 the timelike black hole singularity corresponds to t 0 which is a spacelike curvature singularity in the quantum spacetime provided we equip q with a metric such that the hyperbolic operator is normally hyperbolic cf 8 lemma 6 2 moreover in the quantum spacetime the cauchy hypersurface s 0 can be crossed by causal curves in both directions i e the information paradox does not occur ii the stationary eigenfunctions can be looked at as being radiation be cause they comprise the harmonic oscillator while we consider the temporal eigenfunctions to be gravitational waves as it is well known the schwarzschild black hole or more specifically the extended schwarzschild space has already been analyzed by hawking 14 and hartle and hawking 13 see also the book by wald 19 using quantum field theory but not quantum gravity to prove that the black hole emits radiation the metric describing a rotating black hole in a four dimensional vacuum spacetime was first discovered by kerr 17 carter 1 generalized the kerr solution by describing a rotating black hole in a four dimensional de sitter or anti de sitter background higher dimensional solutions for a rotating black hole were given by myers and perry 18 in even dimensional ricci flat spacetimes and by hawking hunter and taylor 15 in five dimensional spacetimes satisfying the einstein equations with cosmological constant a general solution in all dimension was given in 12 by gibbons et al and we shall use their metric in odd dimensions with all rotational parameters supposed to be equal to define our spacetime n though we shall maximally extend it 1 3 notations we apply the summation convention and label coordi nates with contravariant indices e g i however for better readability we shall usually write 1 34 2 i instead of 1 35 i 2 2 preparations we consider odd dimensional kerr ads spacetimes n dimn 2 m 1 m 2 assuming that all rotational parameters are equal 2 1 ai a 6 0 1 i m 6 claus gerhardt the kerr schild form of the metric can then be expressed as 2 2 ds 2 1 l 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 dt 2 r 2 dr 2 1 l 2 r 2 r 2 a 2 r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 m i 1 d 2 i 2 i d 2 i 2 m 0 u 1 1 a 2 l 2 dt a m i 1 2 i d i r 2 dr 1 l 2 r 2 r 2 a 2 2 where 2 3 l 2 1 m 2

metric of s 2 m 1 where the i are the azimuthal coordinates the values of which have to be identified modulo 2 and the i are the latitudinal coordinates subject to the side condition 2 7 m i 1 2 i 1 the i also satisfy 2 8 0 i 1 1 i m the coordinates t r are defined in 2 9 t and 2 10 0 r respectively cf 12 section 2 and appendix b the horizons are hypersurfaces r const where r 2 satisfies the equation 2 11 1 l 2 a 2 m 2 m 0 0 let 2 12 the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 7 be the polynomial on the left hand side of 2 11 then is strictly convex in r and we have 2 13 0 0 and 2 14 lim from which we deduce that the equation 2 11 is satisfied if and only if 2 15 inf r 0 and in case 2 16 inf r 0 we have exactly two solutions otherwise only one if there are two solutions ri i 1 2 such that 2 17 0 r 1 r 2 then the outer horizon is called event horizon and the black hole has an interior region 2 18 b r 1 r r 2 in which the variable r is a time coordinate if there is only one solution r 0 then b is empty and the black hole is called extremal we shall first quantize a black hole with b 6 the quantization of an extremal black hole is then achieved by approximation thus let us consider a non extremal black hole and let s b be a space like coordinate slice 2 19 s s r r const where r also denotes the constant value in view of 2 2 the induced metric can be expressed as 2 20 ds

components of the metric are either 0 or are represented by the line element 2 24 r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 m i 1 d 2 i note the constraint 2 7 to eliminate the gt i we shall introduce new coordinates first let us make the simple change by defining t through 2 25 ct t where c 6 0 is a constant which will be specified later and dropping the prime in the sequel resulting in a replacement of the components in 2 21 and 2 22 by 2 26 gtt c 2 2 m 0 u 1 1 a 2 l 2 2 1 l 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 respectively 2 27 gt i g it c 2 m 0 u a 1 a 2 l 2 2 2 i next we define new coordinates t i by 2 28 t t and 2 29 i i a t where are non vanishing constants to specified later such that 2 30 i i a t in the new coordinates the only interesting new components are 2 31 gt t gtt t t t t 2 gt i t t i t g i j i t j t 2 gtt 2 a i gt i

combining then 2 35 and 2 33 by setting 1 we obtain 2 37 gt t 2 u 2 m 0 r 2 a 2 2 r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 a 2 1 l 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 a 2 u 2 m 0 r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 2 define 2 38 u 2 m 0 r 2 a 2 r 2 1 l 2 r 2 then 2 39 0 in b since the function in 2 12 is negative in b writing 2 40 a 2 u 2 m 0 r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 a 2 r 2 1 l 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 1 a 2 l 2 r 2 a 2 1 l 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 we infer 2 41 gt t 2 r 2 a 2 2

we can then state 2 1 lemma for any hypersurface 2 45 s s r b the induced metric can be expressed in the form 2 46 ds 2 s d 2 2 m 0 u a 2 1 a 2 l 2 2 2 i 2 j r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 2 i ij d id j r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 m i 1 d 2 i d 2 ijdx idxj where 2 47 ij ij r a l is a smooth riemannian metric on s 2 m 1 and ranges in r while in case 2 48 s s r n b the induced metric is lorentzian of the form 2 49 ds 2 s

case 2 48 however the proof of this case is identical to the proof when 2 45 is valid by observing that then the term in 2 41 is strictly positive the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 11 3 the quantization we are now in a position to argue very similar as in our former paper 10 section 2 for the convenience of the reader we shall repeat some of the arguments so that the results can be understood directly without having to look up the details in the reference the interior of the black hole is a globally hyperbolic spacetime and the slices s r with 3 1 r 1 r r 2 are cauchy hypersurfaces let r tend to r 2 and let s 0 be the resulting limit riemannian manifold i e topologically it is the event horizon but equipped with the metric in 2 50 which we shall write in the form 3 2 ds 2 d 2 ijdx idxj as in 2 46 on page 10 by a slight abuse of language we shall also call s 0 to be a cauchy hypersurface though it is only the geometric limit of cauchy hypersurfaces however s 0 is a genuine cauchy hypersurface in the quantum model which is defined by the equation 1 1 on page 2 let us now look at the stationary eigenvalue equation where we recall that n 2 m 3 3 n 1 v n 2 rv v in s 0 where 3 4 n 1 v n 1 v n 1 v and is the laplacian in the riemannian manifold 3 5 m sn 1 ij moreover the scalar curvature r is also the scalar curvature with respect to ij in view of 3 2 using separation of variables let us write 3 6 v x x to conclude that the left hand side of 3 3 can be expressed in the form 3 7 n 1 n 1 n 2 r hence the eigenvalue problem 3 3 can be solved by setting 3 8 v j where j j n is an eigenfunction of the elliptic operator 3 9 n 1 n 2 r such that 3 10 n 1 j n 2 r j j j 3 11 0 1 2 12 claus gerhardt and is an eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator the eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator can be arbitrarily positive or zero we define it at the moment as 3 12 2 where 0 will be determined later for 0 we shall consider the real eigenfunction 3 13 sin which represents the ground state in the interval 3 14 i 0 0 with vanishing boundary values is a solution of the variational problem 3 15 i 0 2 i 0 2 min 0 6 h 1 2 0 i 0 in the sobolev space h 1 2 0 i 0 multiplying by a constant we may assume 3 16 i 0 2 1 obviously 3 17 s 0 r m and though is defined in r and is even an eigenfunction it has infinite norm in l 2 r however when we consider a finite disjoint union of n open intervals ij 3 18 n j 1 ij where 3 19 ij kj kj 1 kj z then 3 20 n n 1 2 is a unit eigenfunction in with vanishing boundary values having the same energy as in i 0 hence it suffices to consider only in i 0 since this con figuration can immediately be generalized to arbitrary large bounded open intervals 3 21 r we then can state the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 13 3 1 lemma there exists a complete sequence of unit eigenfunctions of the operator in 3 9 with eigenvalues j such that the functions 3 22 vj j where is a constant multiple of the function in 3 13 with unit l 2 i 0 norm are solutions of the eigenvalue problem 3 3 with eigenvalue 3 23 j n 1 2 j the eigenfunctions vj form an orthogonal basis for l 2 i 0 m c to solve the wave equation 1 1 on page 2 let us first consider the following eigenvalue problem 3 24 1 32 n 2 n 1 w n t 2 w t 2 4 nw in the sobolev space 3 25 h 1 2 0 r here 3 26 0 can in principle be an arbitrary negative parameter but in the case of a kerr ads black hole it seems reasonable to choose the cosmological constant of the kerr ads spacetime the eigenvalue problem 3 24 can be solved by considering the generalized eigenvalue problem for the bilinear forms 3 27 b w w r 1 32 n 2 n 1 w w n t 2 w w and 3 28 k w w r t 2 4 n w w in the sobolev space h which is the completion of 3 29 c c r c in the norm defined by the first bilinear form we then look at the generalized eigenvalue problem 3 30 b w k w h which is equivalent to 3 24 3 2 theorem the eigenvalue problem 3 30 has countably many solu tions wi i such that 3 31 0 0 1 2 3 32 lim i 14 claus gerhardt and 3 33 k wi wj ij the wi are complete in h as well as in l 2 r proof the quadratic form k is compact with respect to the quadratic form b as one can easily prove cf 2 lemma 6 8 and hence a proof of the result except for the strict inequalities in 3 31 can be found in 4 theorem 1 6 3 p 37 each eigenvalue has multiplicity one since we have a linear ode of order two and all solutions satisfy the boundary condition 3 34 wi 0 0 the kernel is two dimensional and the condition 3 34 defines a one dimen sional subspace note that we considered only real valued solutions to apply this argument we are now ready to define the solutions of the wave equation 1 1 3 3 theorem let j j resp wi i be eigenfunctions of the elliptic operator in 3 9 resp the temporal eigenfunctions and let i 0 be the smallest eigenvalue of the i with the property 3 35 i 0 j then for any i i 0 there exists 3 36 ij 0 and corresponding ij satisfying 3 37 ij 2 ij ij such that 3 38 i ij n 1 2 ij j i i 0 the functions 3 39 uij wi ij j are then solutions of the wave equation with bounded energies satisfying 3 40 lim t 0 wij t lim t wij t 0 and 3 41 wij c r s 0 c 2 r s 0 for some 3 42 2 3 1 moreover we have 3 43 ij 0 i i 0 the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 15 if 3 44 i 0 j then we define 3 45 i 0 j 1 proof the proof is obvious 3 4 remark i by construction the temporal and spatial energies of the solutions of the wave equation have to be equal ii the stationary solutions comprising a harmonic oscillator can be looked at a being radiation while we consider the temporal solutions to be gravitational waves iii if one wants to replace the bounded interval i 0 by r then the eigen functions ij have to be replaced by eigendistributions an appropriate choice would be 3 46 ij e i ij also see 9 for a more general setting the hyperbolic operator defined by the wave equation 1 1 on page 2 can be defined in the spacetime 3 47 q s 0 r which can be equipped with the lorentzian metrics 3 48 ds 2 32 n 1 n 2 dt 2 gijdx idxj as well as with the metric 3 49 ds 2 32 n 1 n 2 dt 2 1 n 1 t 4 n 2 gijdx i dx j where gij is the metric defined on s 0 and the indices now have the range 1 i j n in both metricsq is globally hyperbolic provided s 0 is complete which is the case for the metric defined in 3 2 the hyperbolic operator is symmetric in the first metric but not normally hyperbolic while it is normally hyperbolic but not symmetric in the second metric normally hyperbolic means that the main part of the operator is identical to the laplacian of the spacetime metric hence if we want to describe quantum gravity not only by an equation but also by the metric of a spacetime then the metric in 3 49 has to be chosen in this metric q has a curvature singularity in t 0 cf 8 remark 6 3 the cauchy hypersurface s 0 then corresponds to the hypersurface 3 50 t 1 16 claus gerhardt which also follows from the derivation of the quantum model where we con sider a fiber bundle e with base space s 0 and the elements of the fibers were riemann metrics of the form 3 51 gij t x t 4 n ij x where ij were metrics defined in s 0 and t is the time coordinate that we use in q i e 3 52 gij 1 x ij x in the present situation we used the symbol gij to denote the metric on s 0 since ij is supposed to be a metric on s 2 m 1 thus the event horizon is characterized by the cauchy hypersurface 3 53 t 1 if a 0 i e in case we consider a schwarzschild ads black hole as in 10 then we shall obviously assume that the black hole singularity 3 54 r 0 corresponds to the curvature singularity 3 55 t 0 of q i e the open black hole region is described in the quantum model by 3 56 s 0 0 1 and the open exterior region by 3 57 s 0 1 if a 6 0 then there is no curvature singularity in r 0 only a coordinate singularity in our present coordinate system indeed if we choose generalized boyer lindquist coordinates cf 12 equation 3 1 the metric has the form 3 58 ds 2 1 l 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 d 2 ur 2 dr 2 1 l 2 r 2 r 2 a 2 u 2 m 0 r 2 r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 m i 1 d 2 i 2 i d i l 2 d 2 2 m 0 u d a 1 a 2 l 2 m i 1 2 i d i 2 then defining 3 59 r 2 such that 3 60 d 2 rdr we obtain new coordinates in which the metric is smooth up to 0 indeed the metric is even smooth in the interval 3 61 a 2 the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 17 in a 2 there is curvature singularity 3 5 lemma the extended spacetime n has a timelike curvature singu larity in a 2 proof the fact that the curvature singularity is timelike follows immediately from 2 49 on page 10 where we proved that outside the black hole region the hypersurfaces 3 62 const are timelike to prove the existence of a curvature singularity we first consider the case m 3 looking at the metric in 3 58 we observe that the components with respect to the coordinates i form a diagonal matrix without any cross terms with the other coordinates namely 3 63 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 m i 1 d 2 i where the i are subject to the side condition 3 64 m i 1 2 i 1 i e 3 63 represents the metric of a sphere of radius 3 65 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 embedded in rm and the corresponding sectional curvatures in n are defined independently of the other components of the metric in n and they obviously become unbounded when tends to a 2 since the sectional curvature p in a point p n of a plane spanned by two linearly independent vectors in 3 66 tp s m 1 tp n is equal to 3 67 1 a 2 l 2 a 2 secondly in case m 2 we used the package great 16 in mathematica to compute the squared riemannian curvature tensor in dimension 5 and obtained 3 68 r r 96 m 20 3 a 2 a 2 3 a 2 6 40 l 4 completing the proof of the lemma 18 claus gerhardt since the curvature singularity is timelike and not spacelike as the singu larity of a schwarzschild ads spacetime or the singularity in our quantum spacetime equipped with the metric in 3 49 it is easily avoidable despite this difference we stipulate that the region in 3 57 corresponds to 3 69 2 where 3 70 r 22 2 and the region in 3 56 to 3 71 a 2 2 3 6 remark the time coordinate in a generalized boyer lindquist coordinate system is a time function in 3 72 n b where n is the extended kerr ads spacetime we proved it directly with the help of mathematica if dimn 5 by proving 3 73 g g 00 0 for a proof in any odd dimension it will be sufficient to prove that the slices 3 74 const are spacelike in the region specified in 3 72 looking at the metric 3 58 we immediately see by setting d 0 that the induced metric is riemannian 3 7 remark when we have an extremal black hole with mass m 0 and corresponding radius r 0 for the event horizon then the function in 2 12 where 3 75 r 2 satisfies 3 76 0 0 inf hence 3 77 0 0 from the definition of we then conclude that any black hole with mass 3 78 m 0 m 0 while the other parameters remain equal will have an interior region hence our previous arguments could then be applied to yield a quantum model depending on the riemannian metric in 2 50 on page 10 letting m 0 tend to m 0 the corresponding radii of the event horizons will then converge to r 0 leading to a quantum model for an extremal black hole the quantization of a kerr ads black hole 19 3 8 remark in the quantum model of the black hole the event horizon is a regular cauchy hypersurface and can be crossed in both directions by causal curves hence no information paradox can occur references 1
