quantum spacetime which has a sequence of solutions that can be expressed as a product of stationary and temporal eigenfunctions the stationary eigenfunctions can be in terpreted as radiation and the temporal as gravitational waves the event horizon corresponds in the quantum model to a cauchy hyper surface that can be crossed by causal curves in both directions such that the information paradox does not occur contents 1 introduction 1 2 the quantization 4 3 transition from the black hole to the white hole 12 references 13 1 introduction in general relativity the cauchy development of a cauchy hypersurface s 0 is governed by the einstein equations where of course the second fundamental form of s 0 has also to be specified in the model of quantum gravity we developed in a series of papers 4 5 2 6 7 8 we pick a cauchy hypersurface which is then only considered to be a complete riemannian manifold s 0 gij of dimension n 3 and define its quantum development to be the solutions of the wave equation 1 1 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 1 t 2 4 n u n 2 t 2 4 nru nt 2 u 0 defined in the spacetime 1 2 q s 0 0 date november 2 2021 2000 mathematics subject classification 83 83 c 83 c 45 key words

v 2 2 claus gerhardt the laplacian is the laplacian with respect to gij r is the scalar curvature of the metric 0 t is the time coordinate defined by the derivation process of the equation and 0 a cosmological constant if other physical fields had been present in the einstein equations then the equation would contain further lower order terms cf 7 but a negative cosmological constant would always have to be present even if the einstein equations would only describe the vacuum using separation of variables we proved that there is a complete sequence of eigenfunctions vj or a complete set of eigendistributions of a stationary eigenvalue problem and a complete sequence of eigenfunctions wi of a tem poral implicit eigenvalue problem where plays the role of an eigenvalue such that the functions 1 3 u t x wi t vj x are solutions of the wave equation cf 6 section 6 and 7 8 in this paper we apply this model to quantize an ads spacetime by picking especially a cauchy hypersurface in the black hole region of the form 1 4 r const r 0 where r 0 is the radius of the event horizon it turns out that the induced metric of the cauchy hypersurface can be expressed in the form 1 5 ds 2 d 2 r 2 ijdx idxj where 1 6 r const and ij is the metric of a spaceform m m n 1 with curvature 1 7 1 0 1 the metric in 1 5 is free of any coordinate singularity hence we can let r tend to r 0 such that s 0 represents the event horizon at least topologically furthermore the laplacian of the metric in 1 5 comprises a harmonic oscil lator with respect to which enables us to write the stationary eigenfunctions vj in the form 1 8 vj x j x where j is an eigenfunction of the laplacian ofm and a harmonic oscillator the frequency of which are still to be determined due to the presence of the harmonic oscillator we can now consider an explicit temporal eigenvalue problem i e we consider the eigenvalue problem 1 9 1 32 n 2 n 1 w n t 2 w t 2 4 nw with a fixed 0 where we choose to be the cosmological constant of the ads spacetime the quantization of a black hole 3 the eigenvalue problem 1 9 has a complete sequence wi i of eigen functions with finite energies i such that 1 10 0 0 1 and by choosing the frequencies of appropriately we can arrange that the stationary eigenvalues j of vj agree with the temporal eigenvalues i if this is the case then the eigenfunctions 1 11 u wivj will be a solution of the wave equation more precisely we proved 1 1 theorem let j j resp wi i be eigenfunctions of 1 12 m resp the temporal eigenfunctions and set 1 13 j n 1 r 2 0 j n 2 n 1 n 2 r 20 let i 0 be the smallest eigenvalue of the i with the property 1 14 i 0 j then for any i i 0 there exists 1 15 ij 0 and corresponding ij satisfying 1 16 ij r 2 0 2 ij ij such that 1 17 i ij n 1 r 2 0 2 ij j i i 0 the functions 1 18 uij wi ij j are then solutions of the wave equation with bounded energies satisfying 1 19 lim t 0 wij t lim t wij t 0 and 1 20 wij c r s 0 c 2 r s 0 for some 1 21 2 3 1 moreover we have 1 22 ij 0 i i 0 if 1 23 i 0 j 4 claus gerhardt then we define 1 24 i 0 j 1 in case j 0 and 6 1 we always have 1 25 0 0 and 1 26 0 const 6 0 and hence 1 27 i 0 0 i 0 1 2 remark i the event horizon corresponds to the cauchy hypersur face t 1 in q and the open black hole region to the region 1 28 s 0 0 1 while the open exterior of the black hole region is represented by 1 29 s 0 1 the black hole singularity corresponds to t 0 which is also a curvature singularity in the quantum spacetime provided we equip q with a metric such that the hyperbolic operator is normally hyperbolic cf 7 lemma 6 2 moreover in the quantum spacetime the cauchy hypersurface s 0 can be crossed by causal curves in both directions i e the information paradox does not occur ii the stationary eigenfunctions can be looked at as being radiation be cause they comprise the harmonic oscillator while we consider the temporal eigenfunctions to be gravitational waves as it is well known the schwarzschild black hole or more specifically the extended schwarzschild space has already been analyzed by hawking 10 and hartle and hawking 9 see also the book by wald 11 using quantum field theory but not quantum gravity to prove that the black hole emits radiation 2 the quantization the metric in the interior of the black hole can be expressed in the form 2 1 ds 2 h 1 dr 2 h dt 2 r 2 ijdx idxj where ij is the metric of an n 1 dimensional space form m and h r is defined by 2 2 h mr n 2 2 n n 1 r 2 where m 0 is the mass of the black hole or a constant multiple of it 0 a cosmological constant and 1 0 1 is the curvature of m mn 1 the quantization of a black hole 5 n 3 we also stipulate that m is compact in the cases 6 1 if 1 we shall assume 2 3 m sn 1 which is of course the important case by assuming m to be compact we can use eigenfunctions instead of eigendistributions when we consider spatial eigenvalue problems the radial variable r ranges between 2 4 0 r r 0 where r 0 is the radius of the unique event horizon the interior region of the black hole is a globally hyperbolic n 1 dimen sional spacetime and the hypersurfaces 2 5 sr r const r 0 are cauchy hypersurfaces with induced metric 2 6 ds 2 h dt 2 r 2 ijdx idxj where 2 7 t note that r const and hence 2 8 0 h const the coordinate transformation 2 9 h 1 2 t yields 2 10 ds 2 d 2 r 2 ijdx idxj where r since we have removed the coordinate singularity we can now let r converge to r 0 such the resulting manifold s 0 represents the event horizon topologically but with different metric however by a slight abuse of language we shall call s 0 to be cauchy hypersurface though it is only the geometric limit of cauchy hypersurfaces however s 0 is a genuine cauchy hypersurface in the quantum model which is defined by the equation 1 1 on page 1 let us now look at the stationary eigenvalue equation 2 11 n 1 v n 2 rv v in s 0 where 2 12 n 1 v n 1 v n 1 r 20 v using separation of variables let us write 2 13 v x x 6 claus gerhardt to conclude that the left hand side of 2 11 can be expressed in the form 2 14 n 1 n 1 r 20 n 2 n 1 n 2 r 20 since the scalar curvature r of the metric 2 10 is 2 15 r n 1 n 2 r 20 hence the eigenvalue problem 2 11 can be solved by setting 2 16 v j where j j n is an eigenfunction of such that 2 17 j j j 2 18 0 0 1 2 and is an eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator the eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator can be arbitrarily positive or zero we define it at the moment as 2 19 r 20 2 where 0 will be determined later for 0 we shall consider the real eigenfunction 2 20 sin r 10 which represents the ground state in the interval 2 21 i 0 0 r 1 0 with vanishing boundary values is a solution of the variational problem 2 22 i 0 2 i 0 2 min 0 6 h 1 2 0 i 0 in the sobolev space h 1 2 0 i 0 multiplying by a constant we may assume 2 23 i 0 2 1 obviously 2 24 s 0 r m and though is defined in r and is even an eigenfunction it has infinite norm in l 2 r however when we consider a finite disjoint union of n open intervals ij 2 25 n j 1 ij the quantization of a black hole 7 where 2 26 ij kj r 1 0 kj 1 r 1 0 kj z then 2 27 n n 1 2 is a unit eigenfunction in with vanishing boundary values having the same energy as in i 0 hence it suffices to consider only in i 0 since this con figuration can immediately be generalized to arbitrary large bounded open intervals 2 28 r we then can state 2 1 lemma there exists a complete sequence of unit eigenfunctions j of with eigenvalues j such that the functions 2 29 vj j where is a constant multiple of the function in 2 20 with unit l 2 i 0 norm are solutions of the eigenvalue problem 2 11 with eigenvalue 2 30 j n 1 r 2 0 2 n 1 r 20 j n 2 n 1 n 2 r 20 the eigenfunctions vj form an orthogonal basis for l 2 i 0 m c the eigen vector 2 31 v 0 0 0 const is a ground state with spatial energy 2 32 n 1 i 0 m dv 0 2 n 1 i 0 2 n 1 r 20 2 the energy of the stationary hamiltonian i e the operator on the left hand side of 2 11 evaluated at an eigenfunction vj is equal to the eigenvalue j in 2 30 to solve the wave equation 1 1 on page 1 let us first consider the following eigenvalue problem 2 33 1 32 n 2 n 1 w n t 2 w t 2 4 nw in the sobolev space 2 34 h 1 2 0 r here 2 35 0 can in principle be an arbitrary negative parameter but in the case of an ads black hole it seems reasonable to choose the cosmological constant of 8 claus gerhardt the ads spacetime however if the cosmological constant is equal to zero i e if we consider a pure schwarzschild spacetime then we have either to pick an arbitrary negative constant if we still want to consider an explicit eigenvalue problem or we have to consider an implicit eigenvalue problem where plays the role of an eigenvalue cf 6 theorem 6 7 or 7 equ 7 9 since our stationary hamiltonian comprises a harmonic oscillator the frequency of which is still at our disposal we would choose a fixed negative e g 2 36 1 if we wanted to quantize a schwarzschild black hole the eigenvalue problem 2 33 can be solved by considering the generalized eigenvalue problem for the bilinear forms 2 37 b w w r 1 32 n 2 n 1 w w n t 2 w w and 2 38 k w w r t 2 4 n w w in the sobolev space h which is the completion of 2 39 c c r c in the norm defined by the first bilinear form we then look at the generalized eigenvalue problem 2 40 b w k w h which is equivalent to 2 33 2 2 theorem the eigenvalue problem 2 40 has countably many solu tions wi i such that 2 41 0 0 1 2 2 42 lim i and 2 43 k wi wj ij the wi are complete in h as well as in l 2 r proof the quadratic form k is compact with respect to the quadratic form b as one can easily prove cf 1 lemma 6 8 and hence a proof of the result except for the strict inequalities in 2 41 can be found in 3 theorem 1 6 3 p 37 each eigenvalue has multiplicity one since we have a linear ode of order two and all solutions satisfy the boundary condition 2 44 wi 0 0 the quantization of a black hole 9 the kernel is two dimensional and the condition 2 44 defines a one dimen sional subspace note that we considered only real valued solutions to apply this argument we are now ready to define the solutions of the wave equation 1 1 2 3 theorem let j j resp wi i be eigenfunctions of 2 45 m resp the temporal eigenfunctions and set 2 46 j n 1 r 2 0 j n 2 n 1 n 2 r 20 let i 0 be the smallest eigenvalue of the i with the property 2 47 i 0 j then for any i i 0 there exists 2 48 ij 0 and corresponding ij satisfying 2 49 ij r 2 0 2 ij ij such that 2 50 i ij n 1 r 2 0 2 ij j i i 0 the functions 2 51 uij wi ij j are then solutions of the wave equation with bounded energies satisfying 2 52 lim t 0 wij t lim t wij t 0 and 2 53 wij c r s 0 c 2 r s 0 for some 2 54 2 3 1 moreover we have 2 55 ij 0 i i 0 if 2 56 i 0 j then we define 2 57 i 0 j 1 in case j 0 and 6 1 we always have 2 58 0 0 10 claus gerhardt and 2 59 0 const 6 0 and hence 2 60 i 0 0 i 0 proof the proof is obvious 2 4 remark i by construction the temporal and spatial energies of the solutions of the wave equation have to be equal ii the stationary solutions comprising a harmonic oscillator can be looked at a being radiation while we consider the temporal solutions to be gravitational waves iii if one wants to replace the bounded interval i 0 by r then the eigen functions ij have to be replaced by eigendistributions an appropriate choice would be 2 61 ij e ir 1 0 ij also see 8 for a more general setting the hyperbolic operator defined by the wave equation 1 1 on page 1 can be defined in the spacetime 2 62 q s 0 r which can be equipped with the lorentzian metrics 2 63 ds 2 32 n 1 n 2 dt 2 gijdx idxj as well as with the metric 2 64 ds 2 32 n 1 n 2 dt 2 1 n 1 t 4 n 2 gijdx i dx j where gij is the metric defined on s 0 and the indices now have the range 1 i j n in both metricsq is globally hyperbolic provided s 0 is complete which is the case for the metric defined in 2 10 the hyperbolic operator is symmetric in the first metric but not normally hyperbolic while it is normally hyperbolic but not symmetric in the second metric normally hyperbolic means that the main part of the operator is identical to the laplacian of the spacetime metric hence if we want to describe quantum gravity not only by an equation but also by the metric of a spacetime then the metric in 2 64 has to be chosen in this metric q has a curvature singularity in t 0 cf 7 remark 6 3 the cauchy hypersurface s 0 then corresponds to the hypersurface 2 65 t 1 the quantization of a black hole 11 which also follows from the derivation of the quantum model where we con sider a fiber bundle e with base space s 0 and the elements of the fibers were riemann metrics of the form 2 66 gij t x t 4 n ij x where ij were metrics defined in s 0 and t is the time coordinate that we use in q i e 2 67 gij 1 x ij x in the present situation we used the symbol gij to denote the metric on s 0 since ij is supposed to be the metric of the spaceform m thus the event horizon is characterized by the cauchy hypersurface 2 68 t 1 and obviously we shall assume that the black hole singularity 2 69 r 0 corresponds to the curvature singularity 2 70 t 0 of q i e the open black hole region is described in the quantum model by 2 71 s 0 0 1 and the open exterior region by 2 72 s 0 1 stipulating that the time orientation in the quantum model should be the same as in the ads spacetime we conclude that the curvature singularity t 0 is a future singularity i e the present time function is not future directed to obtain a future directed coordinate system we have to choose t negative i e 2 73 q s 0 0 in the metric 2 64 we then have to replace 2 74 t 4 n 2 by 2 75 t 4 n 2 and similarly in the wave equation which is then invariant with respect to the reflection 2 76 t t as a final remark in this section let us state 2 5 remark in the quantum model of the black hole the event horizon is a regular cauchy hypersurface and can be crossed in both directions by causal curves hence no information paradox can occur 12 claus gerhardt 3 transition from the black hole to the white hole we shall choose the time variable t negative to have a future oriented coor dinate system the quantum model of the white hole will then be described by a positive t variable and the transition from black to white hole would be future oriented obviously we only have to consider the temporal eigenvalue equation 2 33 on page 7 to define a transition where of course 2 75 on page 11 and its inverse relation have to be observed since the coefficients of the ode in 2 33 are at least ho lder continuous in r a solution w defined on the negative axis has a natural extension to r since we know that w 0 0 denote the fully extended function by w too then 3 1 w c 2 r where we now without loss of generality only consider a real solution 3 1 theorem a naturally extended solution w of the temporal eigenvalue equation 2 33 is antisymmetric in t 3 2 w t w t and the restriction of w to the positive axis is also a variational solution as defined in theorem 2 2 on page 8 proof it suffices to prove 3 2 let t 0 and define 3 3 w t w t then w solves the ode in r and 3 4 w 0 w 0 0 as well as 3 5 w 0 w 0 hence we deduce 3 6 w t w t t 0 because the solutions of a second order ode are uniquely determined by the initial values of the function and its derivative 3 2 remark this transition result is also valid in the general case when the curvature singularity in t 0 does not necessarily correspond to the singularity of a black or white hole the quantum evolution of any cauchy hypersurface s 0 in a globally hyperbolic spacetime will always have a curva ture singularity either in the past or in the future of s 0 and the evolution can be extended past this singularity note also that the quantum lorentzian distance to that past or future singularity is always finite the quantization of a black hole 13 references 1 claus gerhardt quantum cosmological friedman models with an initial sin
