criterion for testing the covariance of physical laws and gordon optical metric changbiao wang shanggang group 10 dover road north haven ct 06473 usa the problem of covariance of physical quantities has not been solved fundamentally in the theory of relativity which has caused a lot of confusion in the community a typical example is the gordon metric tensor which was developed almost a century ago and has been widely used to describe the equivalent gravitational effect of moving media on light propagation predicting a novel physics of optical black hole in this paper it is shown that under lorentz transformation a covariant tensor satisfies three rules 1 the tensor keeps invariant in mathematical form in all inertial frames 2 all elements of the tensor have the same physical definitions in all frames 3 the tensor expression in one inertial frame does not include any physical quantities defined in other frames the three rules constitute a criterion for testing the covariance of physical laws required by einstein s principle of relativity gordon metric does not satisfy rule 3 and its covariance cannot be identified before a general refractive index is defined finally it is also shown as well that in the relativistic quantum mechanics the lorentz covariance of dirac wave equation is not compatible with einstein s mass energy equivalence pacs numbers 03 50 de 03 30 p 04 20 q 11 10 z physh classical field theory light matter interaction electromagnetism i introduction in the theory of relativity physical quantities can be tensors or their elements or a combination of tensors and their elements a physical quantity is said to be covariant if the tensors associated with it are covariant under a change of reference frame laws of physics such as newton s laws and em laws are usually written in terms of physical quantities and thus their covariance required by einstein s principle of relativity is guaranteed by the covariance of tensors unfortunately the problem of covariance of tensors has never been solved fundamentally in the theory of relativ ity which has caused a lot of confusion in the community a typical example is the gordon optical metric tensor 1 in this short paper we take maxwell equations and the four momentum of a massive particle as examples to give the definition of covariance this definition consists of three rules which constitute a criterion for testing the covariance of physical laws ii properties of covariance of maxwell equations in principle the definitions of physical quantities used to construct a covariant theory of light propagation in moving media are supposed to be given in a general in ertial frame otherwise the covariance of the constructed theory is ambiguous at least one cannot identify the covariance of the quantity without a definition given in a general frame electronic address changbiao wang yahoo com as a first principle maxwell equations are the physi cal basis for descriptions of macro electromagnetic phe nomena and all other alternative approaches including lagrange formalism must be confirmed by the maxwell equations 2 p 598 thus any justified results that can not be derived from maxwell equations could constitute a challenge of the completeness of classical electromagnetic theory maxwell equations are also the perfect embodiment of einstein s principle of relativity 3 and they themselves contain the principle of the constancy of the speed of light in free space 4 according to minkowski s electrody namics of moving media maxwell equations are covariant under lorentz transformation of two em field strength tensors 5 this covariance has three properties a maxwell equations keep invariant in mathematical form in all lorentz inertial frames b all physical quantities appearing in the equations have the same physical definitions in all frames c maxwell equations in one frame do not include any physical quantities defined in other inertial frames the above three properties do not contain each other to put it simply maxwell equations are frame independent under lorentz transformation of two em field strength tensors ar x iv 2 10 5 01 49 9 v 1 ph ys ic s ge n ph 1 7 a pr 2 02 1 mailto changbiao wang yahoo com 2 iii covariant form of four vector of momentum energy another typical example for the covariance is the four momentum of a massive particle given by m 0 u m 0 v c non covariant form m u covariant form in relativity mv mc 2 c 1 covariant form in 3 d space in a general xy z frame where m 0 is the particle s mass in the particle rest frame rest proper mass c is the vacuum light speed u v c is the four velocity m m 0 is the mass 1 v 2 c 2 1 2 and v is the particle s velocity the definition of m 0 u is in a non covariant form m 0 u has the same mathematical form and physical def inition in all inertial frames and complies with proper ties a and b but it is not consistent with property c because m 0 u includes m 0 defined in the particle rest frame and thus m 0 u cannot provide the frame independent definitions of momentum and mass in a gen eral frame for example m 0 u defines m 0 as the parti cle s mass in the particle rest frame but m 0 u does not define the particle s mass m in a general frame properties b and c require that the definitions of particle s momentum and mass must be the same in all inertial frames and they do not include any quantities defined in other frames namely momentum mass velocity mv 2 thus we have the mass transformation m m 0 obviously the definition of four momentum m u mv mc 2 c is frame independent un der its lorentz transformation especially like maxwell equations it does not include any quantities of other frames thus this definition complies with property c in addition to properties a and b note that m u is a covariant form in relativity with m a covariant scalar and u the four velocity of the particle in a general xy z frame while mv mc 2 c is a covariant form in 3 d space with mv the momentum and mc 2 the energy of the particle in a general xy z frame just like maxwell equations have the two forms of covariance 6 footnote 7 there iv is gordon metric covariant unfortunately property c has been usually neglected in constructing a tensor in the community a typical ex ample is gordon optical metric tensor 1 7 8 which was proposed in 1923 in a seminal paper by a german theoretical physicist walter gordon 1 to describe the equivalent gravitational effect of moving media on light propagation two decades ago leonhardt and piwnicki generalized gordon metric to investigate a non uniformly moving medium 9 and predicted a novel finding of opti cal black hole 10 which has been arousing wide interest 11 16 the gordon metric in a general xy z frame reads 1 g n 20 1 u u 3 where g diag 1 1 1 1 is the minkowski met ric u u c 1 with v c is the normalized four velocity of the moving medium namely the medium moves at v c with respect to xy z and n 0 is the refractive index in the medium rest frame from eq 3 we find that is given in a general frame xy z but it includes n 0 which is a quantity de fined in another frame medium rest frame obviously this is not consistent with property c in their works 9 10 leonhardt and piwnicki are supposed to provide the definition of the refractive index in a general frame in order to remove this inconsistency left by gordon 1 and make it expressed in a covariant form just like eq 2 leading to the frame independent four momentum m u mv mc 2 c shown above unfortunately the authors failed to do so thus the covariance of cannot be identified namely the covariance of gordon optical metric is ambiguous depending on how to define the refractive index in a general inertial frame it should be indicated that gordon defined the proper refractive index n 0 by assuming that the medium is isotropic observed in the medium rest frame 1 however when a medium is moving it becomes anisotropic in general 17 and gordon s way to define n 0 is not valid to define the refractive index in a general inertial frame it also should be indicated that the way to define the refractive index in a general frame could essentially re vise the descriptions of light propagation for example in wang s theory where the refractive index in a uniform medium is defined in a general inertial frame propaga tion of light complies with fermat s principle in all iner tial frames 18 while in leonhardt s theory it does only in the special case of a medium at rest 19 v conclusions based on above analysis we now can make a general definition for lorentz covariance of a tensor as follows under lorentz transformation a tensor is said to be lorentz covariant if 3 1 the tensor keeps invariant in mathematical form in all inertial frames 2 all elements of the tensor have the same physical definitions in all frames 3 the tensor expression in one inertial frame does not include any physical quantities defined in other frames the above three rules constitute a criterion for testing the covariance of physical laws as we know lorentz invariant scalar is the zeroth rank tensor m given in eq 1 fulfills all above three rules and it is a covariant scalar while the particle s rest mass m 0 is not a covariant scalar because it at least breaches rule 3 m 0 is a physical quantity defined in the particle s rest frame and it is the value of the covari ant scalar m in the particle s rest frame it should be noted that the definitions of momentum and mass in a general inertial frame given by eq 2 complies with newton s law momentum mass ve locity einstein s mass energy equivalence equation en ergy mass c 2 4 and principle of relativity there must be the same definitions of mass and momentum in all inertial frames because inertial frames are equivalent and laws of physics are the same no matter whether the space is filled partially or fully with dielectric or mate rials the mass m in eq 2 is also called relativistic inertial mass 20 p 110 21 p 69 22 p 33 and it is the total mass a sum of the rest mass m 0 and the kinetic mass 1 m 0 the mass and energy are equivalent and the mass of a body is a measure of its energy con tent this general conclusion was first drawn by einstein in 1905 based on analysis of a special radiation process where the body converts part of its rest energy into the kinetic energy of photons 4 gordon optical metric does not fulfill rule 3 either and thus its covariance is ambiguous before a general refractive index is defined if no general definition of re fractive index could be provided then the equivalence of all inertial frames would be challenged which is clearly in contradiction with einstein s principle of relativity un fortunately this subtle but apparently important basic problem in the gordon s theory 1 has never been real ized in the community traditionally it has been argued that when a law of physics is written in terms of tensors it will automat ically be covariant under a change of reference frame 23 however it should be emphasized that a tensor is not necessarily covariant the term tensor refers to the mathematical attribute of a physical quantity while the covariance refers to the physical requirement from einstein s principle of relativity imposed on the physical quantity gordon metric satisfies lorentz transformation and it is a tensor but its covariance is ambiguous as shown in the present paper from this one can see that the traditional argument mentioned above is incorrect because it is clearly disproved by the gordon metric in addition to the hugely controversial abraham tensor 5 note that i if abraham tensor follows lorentz transfor mation then it does not fulfill rules 1 and 2 or con versely ii if abraham tensor fulfills rules 1 and 2 then it does not follows lorentz transformation other wise its contradiction against two em field strength ten sors is stimulated finally it is interesting to point out that the defi nition of relativistic inertial mass for a particle given by eq 2 is consistent with einstein s mass energy equivalence equation but it makes the rest mass m 0 not a covariant scalar from this it follows that in relativistic quantum mechanics dirac wave equation for an electron is not covariant because the electron s rest mass appearing in dirac equation is not a covariant scalar although dirac took it to be in his proof 24 p 258 if the rest mass m 0 in the four momentum m 0 u m 0 v c is defined as a covariant scalar as argued in some respected textbooks 25 p 289 and research works 26 then it contradicts with einstein s mass energy equivalence equation thus the lorentz covariance of dirac wave equation is not compatible with einstein s mass energy equivalence 1 w gordon

metric is indeterminate why is my article worth reading i significant new results in physics the principle of relativity is a basic postulate in einstein s relativity stating the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good a einstein ann phys 322 1905 891 namely physical laws are the same in all inertial frames to keep the principle of relativity valid physical quantities equations tensors must be covariant which constitutes a basic principle in relativity for example maxwell equations must be covariant under the lorentz transformation of two em field strength tensors unfortunately the specific definition of covariance of physical quantities equations tensors has never been given in literature which has caused a lot of confusion in the community for example gordon optical metric is mistaken as being covariant in my paper based on analysis of maxwell equations a general definition of the covariance of a physical tensor is given stating under lorentz transformation a the tensor keeps invariant in mathematical form in all inertial frames b all elements of the tensor have the same physical definitions in all frames c the tensor expression in one inertial frame does not include any physical quantities defined in other frames a is well known b and c especially c are usually ignored in the community for example gordon metric does not comply with c which means that gordon metric is questionable about whether it follows the principle of relativity however gordon metric has been widely used to describe the equivalent gravitational effect of moving media on light propagation such as in the most influential prl letter by u leonhardt and p piwnicki relativistic effects of

definition of covariance of tensors which i provided and the problem of covariance of gordon metric i indicated are both significant new results in physics in my paper ii scientific interest and high quality how to define the covariance of physical quantities and tensors is a fundamental issue in relativity if the physical quantities used to develop a theory are not covariant then the justification of the developed theory is questionable thus the topic contained in my manuscript is of great scientific interest in addition i used very basic knowledge of relativity to address the topic in my manuscript and provided specific popular examples maxwell equations four momentum of a massive particle and gordon metric tensor to elucidate the issue of covariance and made the paper easily accessible therefore i am not modest to say that my manuscript is also of high quality iii important contributions to the literature as i mentioned in i the specific definition of covariance of physical quantities equations tensors has never been given in literature i also indicated the problem of the covariance of gordon optical metric of which the community has never got aware therefore
