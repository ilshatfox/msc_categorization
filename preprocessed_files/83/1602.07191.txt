yang mills and higgs field using canonical quantization similar to the approach in a previous paper we discard the wheeler dewitt equation and ex press the hamilton constraint by the evolution equation of the mean curvature of the hypersurfaces in the foliation defined by the hamil tonian setting expressing the time derivative of the mean curvature with the help of the poisson brackets the canonical quantization of this equation leads to a wave equation in q 0 s 0 where s 0 is one of the cauchy hypersurfaces in the hamiltonian setting the wave equation describes the interaction of an arbitrary riemannian metric in s 0 and a given yang mills and higgs field if the metric is complete q is globally hyperbolic in case s 0 is compact we also prove a spec tral resolution of the wave equation and establish sufficient conditions guaranteeing a mass gap contents 1 introduction 1 2 definitions and notations 6 3 the yang mills functional 8 4 the higgs functional 12 5 the hamilton

gravity is involved we have the hamilton constraint as a side condition deriving the einstein equations by a hamil tonian setting requires a global time function x 0 and foliation of spacetime by its level hypersurfaces thus we consider a spacetime n nn 1 with metric g 0 n assuming the existence of a global time function x 0 which will also define the time coordinate furthermore we only con sider metrics that can be split by the time function i e the metrics can be expressed in the form 1 1 ds 2 w 2 dx 0 2 gijdxidxj where w 0 is a smooth function and gij x 0 x are riemannian metrics let 1 2 m t x 0 t t x 0 n i be the coordinate slices then the gij are the induced metrics moreover let g be a compact semi simple connected lie group with lie algebra g and let 1 3 e 1 n g ad g be the corresponding adjoint bundle with bas space n then we consider the functional 1 4 j n r 2 n 1 lym 2 lh where the i i 1 2 are positive coupling constants r the scalar curvature a cosmological constant lym the energy of a connection in e 1 and lh the energy of a higgs field with values in g the integration over n is to be understood symbolically since we shall always integrate over an open precompact subset n in a former paper 5 we already considered a canonical quantization of the above action and proved that it will be sufficient to only consider connections aa satisfying the hamilton gauge 1 5 aa 0 0 thereby eliminating the gau constraint such that the only remaining con straint is the hamilton constraint cf 5 theorem 2 3 using the adm partition 1 2 of n cf 1 such that 1 6 n i s 0 where s 0 is the cauchy hypersurface m 0 and applying canonical quanti zation we obtained a hamilton operator h which was a normally hyperbolic operator in a fiber bundle e with base space s 0 and fibers 1 7 f x g t 0 1 x s 0 g x s 0 where f x is the space of riemannian metrics we quantized the action by looking at the wheeler dewitt equation in this bundle the fibers of e are equipped with a lorentzian metric such that they are globally hyperbolic gravity interacting with a yang mills field 3 and the transformed hamiltonian h which is now a hyperbolic operator is a normally hyperbolic operator acting only in the fibers the wheeler dewitt equation has the form 1 8 hu 0 with u c e c and we defined with the help of the green s operator a symplectic vector space and a corresponding weyl system the wheeler dewitt equation seems to be the obvious quantization of the hamilton condition however h acts only in the fibers and not in the base space which is due to the fact that the derivatives are only ordinary covariant derivatives and not functional derivatives though they are supposed to be functional derivatives but this property is not really invoked when a functional derivative is applied to u since the result is the same as applying a partial derivative therefore we shall discard the wheeler dewitt equation and express the hamilton condition differently by looking at the evolution equation of the mean curvature of the foliation hypersurfaces m t and implementing the hamilton condition on the right hand side of this evolution equation the left hand side a time derivative we shall express with the help of the poisson brackets after canonical quantization the poisson brackets become a com mutator and now we can employ the fact that the derivatives are functional derivatives since we have to differentiate the scalar curvature of a metric as a result we obtain an elliptic differential operator in the base space the main part of which is the laplacian of the metric on the right hand side of the evolution equation the interesting term is h 2 the square of the mean curvature it will be transformed to a second time derivative and will be the only remaining derivative with respect to a fiber variable since the differentiations with respect to the other variables cancel each other the resulting quantized equation is then a wave equation 1 9 1 32

complete riemannian metric ij in s 0 with a given yang mills and higgs field v is the potential of the higgs field and m a positive constant the existence of the time variable and its range is due to the lorentzian metric in the fibers of e 1 1 remark for the results and arguments in this paper it is completely irrelevant that the values of the higgs field lie in a lie algebra i e could also be just an arbitrary scalar field or we could consider a higgs field as 4 claus gerhardt well as an another arbitrary scalar field hence let us stipulate that the higgs field could also be just an arbitrary scalar field it will later be used to produce a mass gap simply by interacting with the gravitation ignoring the yang mills field if s 0 is compact we also prove a spectral resolution of equation 1 9 by first considering a stationary version of the hyperbolic equation namely the elliptic eigenvalue equation 1 11 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ijv 2 n 4 ab ij ai b iv 2 n 2 mv v v it has countably many solutions vi i such that 1 12 0 1 2 1 13 lim i let v be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 0 then we look at solutions of 1 9 of the form 1 14 u x t w t v x u is then a solution of 1 9 provided w satisfies the implicit eigenvalue equa tion 1 15 1 32 n 2 n 1 w t 2 4 nw nt 2 w 0 where is the eigenvalue this eigenvalue problem we also considered in a previous paper and proved that it has countably many solutions wi i with finite energy i e 1 16 0 w i 2 1 t 2 t 2 4 n wi 2 more precisely we proved cf 6 theorem 6 7 1 2 theorem assume n 2 and s 0 to be compact and let v be a solution of the eigenvalue problem 1 11 with 0 then there exist countably many solutions wi i of the implicit eigenvalue problem 1 15 such that 1 17 i i 1 0 1 18 lim i i 0 and such that the functions 1 19 ui wiv are solutions of the wave equation 1 9 the transformed eigenfunctions 1 20 w i t wi n 4 n 1 i t gravity interacting with a yang mills field 5 where 1 21 i i n 1 n form a basis of l 2 r c and also of the hilbert space h defined as the completion of c c r c under the norm of the scalar product 1 22 w w 1 0 w w t 2 w w where a prime or a dot denotes differentiation with respect to t 1 3 remark if s 0 is not compact then let 1 23 s 0 be an arbitrary relatively compact open subset of s 0 with smooth boundary and exactly the same results as above will be valid in the cylinder 1 24 q r by solving the eigenvalue problem 1 11 in the sobolev space 1 25 h 1 2 0 h 2 2 and arguing further as before finally we prove under which assumptions the lowest eigenvalue 0 of the eigenvalue problem 1 11 is strictly positive this property can also be called a mass gap we prove the existence of a mass gap in two cases in the first case we prove 1 4 theorem let s 0 be compact and let v satisfy 1 26 v 0 a e then there exists m 0 such that for all m m 0 the first eigenvalue 0 of equa tion 1 11 is strictly positive with an a priori bound from below depending on the data in the second case we only assume v 0 such that we may ignore the contribution of the higgs field to the quadratic form defined by the elliptic operator in equation 1 11 completely since its contribution is non negative and only look at the smaller operator 1 27 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ijv if we can prove that the eigenvalues of this operator are strictly positive then the eigenvalues of equation 1 11 are also strictly positive 1 5 theorem let s 0 be compact r 0 then the smallest eigenvalue of the operator 1 27 is strictly positive provided either r or fijf ij do not vanish everywhere 6 claus gerhardt 2 definitions and notations the main objective of this section is to state the equations of gau codazzi and weingarten for spacelike hypersurfaces m in a n 1 dimen sional lorentzian manifold n geometric quantities in n will be denoted by g r etc and those in m by gij rijkl etc greek indices range from 0 to n and latin from 1 to n the summation convention is always used generic coordinate systems in n resp m will be denoted by x resp i covariant differentiation will simply be indicated by indices only in case of possible ambiguity they will be preceded by a semicolon i e for a function u in n u will be the gradient and u the hessian but e g the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor will be abbreviated by r we also point out that 2 1 r i r x i with obvious generalizations to other quantities letm be a spacelike hypersurface i e the induced metric is riemannian with a differentiable normal which is timelike in local coordinates x and i the geometric quantities of the spacelike hypersurface m are connected through the following equations 2 2 x ij hij the so called gau formula here and also in the sequel a covariant deriva tive is always a full tensor i e 2 3 x ij x ij kijx k x i x j the comma indicates ordinary partial derivatives in this implicit definition the second fundamental form hij is taken with respect to the second equation is the weingarten equation 2 4 i h k i x k where we remember that i is a full tensor finally we have the codazzi equation 2 5 hij k hik j r x i x j x k and the gau equation 2 6 rijkl hikhjl hilhjk r x i x j x k x l now let us assume that n is a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold with a cauchy surface n is then a topological product i s 0 where i is an open interval s 0 is a riemannian manifold and there exists a gaussian coordinate system x such that the metric in n has the form 2 7 ds 2 n e 2 dx 02 ij x 0 x dxidxj gravity interacting with a yang mills field 7 where ij is a riemannian metric a function on n and x an abbreviation for the spacelike components xi we also assume that the coordinate system is future oriented i e the time coordinate x 0 increases on future directed curves hence the contravariant timelike vector 1 0 0 is future directed as is its covariant version e 2 1 0 0 let m graphu s 0 be a spacelike hypersurface 2 8 m x 0 x x 0 u x x s 0 then the induced metric has the form 2 9 gij e 2 uiuj ij where ij is evaluated at u x and its inverse g ij gij 1 can be ex pressed as 2 10 gij e 2 ij u i v uj v where ij ij 1 and 2 11 ui ijuj v 2 1 ijuiuj 1 du 2 hence graphu is spacelike if and only if du 1 the covariant form of a normal vector of a graph looks like 2 12 v 1 e 1 ui and the contravariant version is 2 13 v 1 e 1 ui thus we have 2 1 remark let m be spacelike graph in a future oriented coordinate system then the contravariant future directed normal vector has the form 2 14 v 1 e 1 ui and the past directed 2 15 v 1 e 1 ui in the gau formula 2 2 we are free to choose the future or past directed normal but we stipulate that we always use the past directed normal look at the component 0 in 2 2 and obtain in view of 2 15 2 16 e v 1 hij uij 000 uiuj 00 jui 00 iuj 0 ij here the covariant derivatives are taken with respect to the induced metric of m and 2 17 0 ij e h ij where h ij is the second fundamental form of the hypersurfaces x 0 const 8 claus gerhardt an easy calculation shows 2 18 h ije 1 2 ij ij where the dot indicates differentiation with respect to x 0 3 the yang mills functional let n nn 1 be a globally hyperbolic spacetime with metric g g a compact semi simple connected lie group g its lie algebra and e 1 n g ad g the corresponding adjoint bundle with base space n the yang mills functional is then defined by 3 1 jym n 1 4 f f n 1 4 abg 2 g 1 f a 1 f b 2 where ab is the cartan killing metric in g 3 2 f a a a aa fabcab ac is the curvature of a connection 3 3 a aa in e 1 and 3 4 fc f a cb are the structural constants of g the integration over n is to be understood symbolically since we shall always integrate over an open precompact subset of n 3 1 definition the adjoint bundle e 1 is vector bundle let e 1 be the dual bundle then we denote by 3 5 t r s e 1 e 1 e 1 r e 1 e 1 s the corresponding tensor bundle and by 3 6 t r s e 1 or more precisely 3 7 n t r s e 1 the sections of the bundle where n is the base space especially we have 3 8 t 1 0 e 1 e 1 thus we have 3 9 f a t 1 0 e 1 t 0 2 n when we fix a connection a in e 1 then a general connection a can be written in the form 3 10 aa a a a a gravity interacting with a yang mills field 9 where a a is a tensor 3 11 a a t 1 0 e 1 t 0 1 n to be absolutely precise a connection in e 1 is of the form 3 12 fca c where fc is defined in 3 4 a a is merely a coordinate representation 3 2 definition a connection a of the form 3 10 is sometimes also denoted by a a a a since we assume that there exists a globally defined time function x 0 in n we may consider globally defined tensors a a satisfying 3 13 a a 0 0 these tensors can be written in the form a ai and they can be viewed as maps 3 14 a ai n g t 0 1 s 0 where s 0 is a cauchy hypersurface of n e g a coordinate slice 3 15 s 0 x 0 const it is well known that the yang mills lagrangian is singular and requires a local gauge fixing when applying canonical quantization we impose a local gauge fixing by stipulating that the connection a satisfies 3 16 a a 0 0 hence all connections in 3 10 will obey this condition since we also stipulate that the tensor fields a a have vanishing temporal components as in 3 13 the gauge 3 16 is known as the hamilton gauge cf 2 p 82 however this gauge fixing leads to the so called gau constraint since the first variation in the class of these connections will not formally yield the full yang mills equations in a former theorem 5 theorem 2 3 we proved that the gau constraint does not exist and that it suffices to consider connections of the form 3 10 satisfying 3 13 and 3 16 in the yang mills functional jym 3 3 theorem let n be open and precompact such that there exists a local trivialization of e 1 in let a a a a a be a connection satisfying 3 13 and 3 16 in and suppose that the first variation of jym vanishes at a with respect to compact variations of a a all satisfying 3 13 then a is a yang mills connection i e the yang mills equation 3 17 f a 0 is valid in 10 claus gerhardt let b k xk k n be a covering of s 0 by small open balls such that each ball lies in a coordinate chart of s 0 then the cylinders 3 18 uk i b k xk are a covering of n such that each uk is contractible hence each bundle 1 uk is trivial and the connection a can be expressed in coordinates in each uk 3 19 a a a faa a dx we proved in 5 lemma 2 5 3 4 lemma in each cylinder uk there exists a gauge transformation t x such that 3 20 a a 0 t x 0 t x uk after applying the gauge transformation and in addition 3 5 lemma let uk ul be overlapping cylinders and let t x be a gauge transformation relating the respective representations of the connection a in the overlap uk ul where both representations use the hamilton gauge then does not depend on t i e 3 21 0 let e 0 be the adjoint bundle 3 22 e 0 s 0 g ad g with base space s 0 where the gauge transformations only depend on the spatial variables x xi for fixed t aai 0 are elements of t 1 0 e 0 t 0 1 s 0 3 23 aai 0 t 1 0 e 0 t 0 1 s 0 but the vector potentials aai t are connections in e 0 for fixed t and there fore cannot be used as independent variables since the variables should be the components of a tensor however in view of the results in lemma 3 4 and lemma 3 5 the difference 3 24 a ai t aai t a ai 0 t 1 0 e 0 t 0 1 s 0 hence we shall define a ai to be the independent variables such that 3 25 aai a a i 0 a ai and we infer 3 26 aai 0 a a i 0 in the hamilton gauge we therefore have 3 27 f a 0 i a a i 0 gravity interacting with a yang mills field 11 and hence we conclude 3 28 1 4 f f 1 2 w 2 gij aba a i 0 a b j 0 14 fijf ij where we used 1 1 writing the density 3 29 g det gij in the form 3 30 g det ij where is a fixed riemannian metric in s 0 ij ij x such that 0 x gij is a function we obtain as lagrangian function 3 31 lym 1 2 abg ija ai 0 a b j 0 w 1 1 4 fijf ijw in order to prove a spectral resolution of the combined hamilton operator after quantization we need to modify the yang mills lagrangian slightly we shall call this modification process renormalization though the renormaliza tion is different from the usual renormalization in quantum field theory 3 6 remark the renormalization is necessary since the yang mills en ergy depends quadratically on the inverse of the metric and hence shows a wrong scaling behaviour with respect to the metric the appropriate scaling behaviour would be linear 3 7 definition when we only consider metrics g that can be split by a given time function x 0 such that the yang mills lagrangian is expressed as in 3 31 then we define the renormalized lagrangian by 3 32 lymmod 1 2 abg ija ai 0 a b j 0 w 1 p 1 4 fijf ijw p where p r is real we shall choose 3 33 p 2 n an equivalent description is that we have replaced 3 34 f 2 f f by 3 35 f 2 p though this always requires that the metric is split by a time function other wise the definition of makes no sense the a ai t can be looked at to be mappings from s 0 to t 1 0 e 0 t 0 1 s 0 3 36 a ai t s 0 t 1 0 e 0 t

convenient to consider the fibers to be riemannian manifolds endowed with the above metric let p 1 p n 1 n where n 1 dim g be local coordinates and 3 39 p a ai p a be a local embedding then the metric has the coefficients 3 40 gpq a p a q abgija ai pa bj q hence the lagrangian lymmod in 3 32 can be expressed in the form 3 41 lymmod 1 2 gpq p qw 1 1 2 n 1 4 fijf ijw 1 2 n and we deduce 3 42 p lymmod p gpq qw 1 1 2 n yielding the hamilton function 3 43 h ymmod p p lymmod 1 2 gpq pw 1 1 2 n qw 1 1 2 n w 1 2 n 1 4 fijf ijw 1 2 n 1 2 gpq p qw 1 2 n 1 4 fijf ijw 1 2 n hymmodw thus the effective

by 4 2 lh 12 g ab a b mv where v 0 is a smooth potential andm 0 a constant given a global time function with corresponding foliation of n we also consider a renormalized potential namely we replace v

assume for simplicity that in a local coordinate system has real coefficients the covariant derivatives of are defined by a connection a aa in e 1 4 5 a a f a cba c b as in the preceding section we work in a local trivialization of e 1 using the hamilton gauge i e 4 6 aa 0 0 hence we conclude 4 7 a 0 a 0 moreover let 4 8 s 0 e 1 be an arbitrary but fixed smooth section of e 1 depending only on x s 0 and let 4 9 n e 1 be an arbitrary smooth section then we define 4 10 to be the argument that enters in the higgs lagrangian but stipulate that will the variable expressing the density g as in 3 30

again consider the vector space g to be a rie mannian manifold with metric ab the representation of in the form a can be looked at in a local trivialization to be the representation of the local

component of the einstein equations 5 9 g t 0 cannot be derived from the hamilton equations and this equation has to be stipulated as an extra condition the so called hamilton condition gravity interacting with a yang mills field 15 in 4 theorem 3 2 we proved that any metric g which splits according to 1 1 on page 2 satisfying 5 8 and 5 9 on page 14 also solves the full einstein equations i e it also satisfies the mixed components 5 10 g 0 j g 0 j t 0 j 0 the hamilton condition is equivalent to the equation 5 11 h 0 and after quantization when the quantized hamiltonian still denoted by h is a differential operator in a fiber bundle the quantum equivalent of equation 5 11 is considered to be 5 12 hu 0 i e the elements of the kernel ofh are supposed to be the physical interesting solutions the equation 5 12 is known as the wheeler dewitt equation in our former papers 4 5 we used this approach and solved the wheeler dewitt equation in a fiber bundle e the hamilton operator is then a hyperbolic operator acting only in the fibers of the bundle as a differential operator and not in the base space s 0 which is unsatisfactory therefore we shall express the hamilton condition differently the foliation m t is also the solution set of the geometric flow 5 13 x w with initial hypersurface 5 14 m 0 s 0 where is the past directed normal cf 3 equ 2 3 25 let hij be the second

on the right hand side of this evolution equation we now implement the hamilton condition by replacing 5 30 1 gij kl ij klw by 5 31 r 2 w h 1 h 2 expressing the time derivative on the left hand side

which is equivalent to the hamilton condition if the hamilton equations are valid thus we have proved 5 1 theorem let n nn 1 be a globally hyperbolic spacetime and let the metric g be expressed as in 1 1 on page 2 then the metric satisfies the full einstein equations if and only if the metric is a solution of the hamilton equations and of the equation 5 32 6 the quantization for the quantization we use a similar model as in 6 section 4 first we switch to the gauge w 1 in our previous paper we considered a bundle 18 claus gerhardt with base space s 0 and fibers f x x s 0 the elements of which

where gab is independent of t and the coordinates t a are independent of x cf 6 equ 4 60 in the present situation we consider a bundle e with base space s 0 and the fibers over x s 0 are 6 4 f x g t

have obtained the final equation governing the interaction of a riemannian metric with yang mills and higgs fields we shall choose a ai 0 and a 0 such that only the arbitrary sections a ai and a are involved and not any elements of the bundle the fibers in 6 4 are equipped with the metric 6 7 ds 2 16 n 1 n dt 2 4 n 1 n t 2 gabd ad b t 2 1 g pqd pd q t 2 2 abd ad b where the metrics g pq and ab are independent of t the metric gpq in 3 45 on page 12 is related with g pq by 6 8 gpq t 4 n g pq here we used that a metric 6 9 gij x f x can be expressed in the form 6 10 gij t 4 n ij gravity interacting with a yang mills field 19 where ij is dependent of t satisfying 6 11 det ij det ij cf 6 equ 4 66 let us abbreviate the fiber metric in 6 7 by 6 12 ds 2 g d 0 n 2 such that 6 13 0 t and let r be the corresponding ricci tensor then 6 14 r 0 0 as can be easily derived by introducing a conformal time 6 15 log t such that 6 16 g e 2 g where the coefficients g are independent of 6 17 g 00 1 and 6 18 c c const and using the well known formula 6 19 r r n 1 g n 1 d 2 connecting the ricci tensors of conformal metrics norms and derivatives on the right hand side are all with respect to the metric g the index 0 now refers to the variable we can now quantize the hamiltonian setting using the original variables gij kl we consider the bundle e equipped with the metric 6 7 in the fibers and with the riemannian metric in s 0 furthermore let 6 20 c c e be the space of real valued smooth functions with compact support in e in the quantization process where we choose 1 the variables gij ij etc are then replaced by operators g ij ij etc acting in c c e and satisfying the commutation relations 6 21 g ij kl i klij for the gravitational variables 6 22 p q i p q for the yang mills variables and 6 23 a p b i a b 20 claus gerhardt for the higgs variables while all the other commutators vanish these oper ators are realized by defining g ij to be the multiplication operator 6 24 g iju giju and ij to be the functional derivative 6 25 ij 1 i gij i e if u c c e then 6 26 u gij is the euler lagrange operator of the functional 6 27 s 0 u s 0 u hence if u only depends on x gij and not on derivatives of the metric then 6 28 u gij u gij the same definitions and reasonings are also valid for the other variables therefore the transformed hamiltonian h can be looked at as the hyperbolic differential operator 6 29 h c 0 c 1 c 2 where is the laplacian of the metric in 6 7 acting on functions u c c e and the symbols ci i 1 2 3 represent the lower order terms of the respective hamiltonians h 0 h 1 and h 2 following dirac the poisson brackets on the left hand side of 5 32 on page 17 are replaced by 1 i times the commutators of the transformed quan tities in the quantization process since 1 dropping the hats in the following to improve the readability the left hand side of equation 5 32 is transformed to 6 30 i h 12 gij ij h 1 2 gij gij as we proved in 6 equ 6 25 6 31 1 2 gij gij n 4 t when applied to functions u hence 6 32 n 4 t u 0 in view of 6 14 and 6 33 c 0 c 1 c 2 1 2 gij gij u n 1 1 2 u 1 2 2 k 0 gij ck u gravity interacting with a yang mills field 21 cf 6 equ 6 27 where is the laplace operator with respect to the metric gij here we evaluate the equation 6 33 at an arbitrary point 6 34 x gij a a k b x t a in e where we used the abbreviation 6 35 0 a t a to denote the fiber coordinates in a local trivialization the spatial fiber coordinates a are the coordinates for the fibers of the subbundle 6 36 e 1 t 1 which is a cauchy hypersurface since the fibers of e are globally hyperbolic cf 5 theorem 4 1 6 1 remark if we consider u to depend on the left hand side of 6 34 then u has to be evaluated by applying the chain rule however if we consider u to depend on x t a which are independent variables then u is the laplacian of 6 37 u t a we shall adopt the latter view indeed after having derived the quantized version of 5 32 on page 17 we shall consider u to depend on x t and only implicitly on a fixed a i e on a given a ai and a especially since we shall then specify 6 38 a ai 0 a 0 let us now transform the right hand side of 5 32 on page 17 by having in mind that w 1 and by multiplying all terms with 1 2 before applying them to a function u later when we compare the left and right hand sides we of course multiply the left hand side by the same factor 1 2 the only non trivial term on the right hand side of 5 32 is the first one with the second derivatives we arrange the covariant derivatives such that we obtain 6 39 1 32 n 2 n 1 u where the derivatives are ordinary partial derivatives with respect to t cf the arguments in 6 equ 6 28 6 33 the other terms are trivial and we infer that the right hand side is transformed to 6 40 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 2 c 0 c 1 c 2 u gij gij c 0 c 1 c 2 u 22 claus gerhardt now multiplying 6 33 by 1 2 and observing that it equals 6 40 we finally obtain the hyperbolic equation 6 41 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 1 u n 2 r 2 u 1 n 8 fijf ij 1 2 n 2 n 4 abg ij ai b i u 2 n 2 mv 1 2 n u 0 where 6 42 gij a a k b are arbitrary but fixed elements of the bundle in 6 equ 6 35 6 37 we have shown that 6 43 gij x t t 4 n ij x where 6 44 det ij det ij such that 6 45 ij a a k b belong to the subbundle e 1 observing that 6 46 u t 4 n iju and 6 47 r t 4 nr ij where r ij is the scalar curvature of the metric ij we can express 6 41 in the form 6 48 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 1 t 2 4 n u n 2 t 2 4 nru 1 n 8 t 2 4 nfijf iju 2 n 4 t 2 4 n ab ij ai b iu 2 n 2 mt 2 4 nv u nt 2 u 0 where we dropped the tilde from u and where the laplacian the scalar curvature and the raising and lowering of indices are defined with respect to the metric ij in 6 remark 6 8 we have proved that we may choose ij ij and since ij has been an arbitrary riemannian metric on s 0 we can therefore prove 6 2 theorem let s 0 ij be a connected complete and smooth n dimensional riemann manifold and let e 0 s 0 g ad g be the adjoint bundle defined in 3 22 on page 10 and let 6 49 a aai be an arbitrary smooth connection in e 0 i e an arbitrary smooth section and let 6 50 a gravity interacting with a yang mills field 23 be an arbitrary smooth higgs field then the hyperbolic equation 6 48 in 6 51 q r s 0 describes the quantized version of the interaction of s 0 ij with these bosonic fields proof we only have to prove that we may choose the connection aai and the higgs field a as arbitrary smooth sections this follows immediately by evaluating 6 48 at the bundle elements 6 52 a ai 0 a 0 then the connection aai and the higgs field a coincide with a ai resp a which are arbitrary smooth sections 6 3 remark if we define in q the lorentz metric 6 53 ds 2 32 n 1 n 2 dt 2 1 n 1 ijdx idxj then q is globally hyperbolic and the operator in 6 48 is symmetric if we equip q with the metric 6 54 ds 2 32 n 1 n 2 dt 2 1 n 1 t 4 n 2 ijdx idxj then q is also globally hyperbolic the operator in 6 48 normally hyperbolic but not symmetric and q has a big bang singularity in t 0 if n 3 proof since ij is complete it suffices to prove the big bang assertion let 6 55 m t x 0 t be the cauchy hypersurfaces and hij their second fundamental form with respect to the past directed normal then 6 56 hij 1 2 n 1 t 4 n 2 ij p 1 2 n 1 t p 1 ij where 6 57 p 2 4 n hence the m t are all umbilical let h be the mean curvature then 6 58 h np 2 t 1 moreover let r be the scalar curvature of them t and r the scalar curvature of ij then 6 59 r n 1 tpr and we deduce 6 60 lim t 0 r 0 24 claus gerhardt and 6 61 lim t 0 h 2 hence some sectional curvatures of the ambient metric must also get un bounded in view of the gau equation and the fact that the m t are umbil ical 7 the spectral resolution in case s 0 is compact we can prove a spectral resolution for the equation 6 48 on page 22 where will act as an implicit eigenvalue the proof is similar as in our previous paper 6 section 6 first let us consider an elliptic eigenvalue problem which can be looked at to be the stationary version of equation 6 48 7 1 lemma let s 0 be compact equipped with the metric ij then the eigenvalue problem 7 1 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ij v 2 n 4 ab ij a i b iv 2 n 2 mv v v has countably many solutions vi i such that 7 2 0 1 2 7 3 lim i and 7 4 s 0 v ivj ij where now we consider complex valued functions the solutions are smooth in s 0 and form a basis in l 2 s 0 c this result is well known for clarification let us recall r is the scalar curvature of ij and the other coefficients depend on a given smooth yang mills field and a higgs field there is no sign condition on the potential v but later when establishing assumptions guaranteeing that 7 5 0 0 we shall require that 7 6 v 0 or even 7 7 v 0 a e i e v is strictly positive except on a lebesgue null set the constant m is always supposed to be non negative gravity interacting with a yang mills field 25 to prove a spectral resolution of the hyperbolic equation 6 48 we choose an eigenfunction v vi with positive eigenvalue i and look at solutions of 6 48 of the form 7 8 u x t w t v x u is then a solution of 6 48 provided w satisfies the implicit eigenvalue equation 7 9 1 32 n 2 n 1 w t 2 4 nw nt 2 w 0 where is the eigenvalue this eigenvalue problem we also considered in our previous paper and proved that it has countably many solutions wi i with finite energy i e 7 10 0 w i 2 1 t 2 t 2 4 n wi 2 more precisely we proved cf 6 theorem 6 7 7 2 theorem assume n 2 and s 0 to be compact and let v be a solution of the eigenvalue problem 7 1 with 0 then there exist countably many solutions wi i of the implicit eigenvalue problem 7 9 such that 7 11 i i 1 0 7 12 lim i i 0 and such that the functions 7 13 ui wiv are solutions of the wave equations 6 48 the transformed eigenfunctions 7 14 w i t wi n 4 n 1 i t where 7 15 i i n 1 n form a basis of l 2 r c and also of the hilbert space h defined as the completion of c c r c under the norm of the scalar product 7 16 w w 1 0 w w t 2 w w where a prime or a dot denotes differentiation with respect to t 7 3 remark if s 0 is not compact then let 7 17 s 0 be an arbitrary relatively compact open subset of s 0 with smooth boundary and exactly the same results as above will be valid in the cylinder 7 18 q r 26 claus gerhardt by solving the eigenvalue problem 7 1 in the sobolev space 7 19 h 1 2 0 h 2 2 and arguing further as before finally let us consider under which assumptions the lowest eigenvalue 0 of the eigenvalue problem 7 1 is strictly positive this property can also be called a mass gap we prove the existence of a mass gap in two cases in the first case we assume that v satisfies the condition 7 7 7 4 theorem let s 0 be compact and let v satisfy 7 7 then there exists m 0 such that for all m m 0 the first eigenvalue 0 of equation 7 1 is strictly positive with an a priori bound from below depending on the data the theorem immediately follows from a well known compactness lemma 7 5 lemma under the assumptions of the previous theorem there exists for any 0 a constant c such that 7 20 s 0 u 2 s 0 du 2 c s 0 v u 2 u c 1 s 0 proof we prove the estimate 7 20 in he sobolev space h 1 2 s 0 instead of c 1 s 0 since this is the appropriate function space and argue by contradic tion if the estimate 7 20 would be false then there would exist 0 and a sequence of functions 7 21 uk h 1 2 s 0 such that 7 22 s 0 uk 2 s 0 duk 2 k s 0 v uk 2 without loss of generality we may assume 7 23 s 0 uk 2 1 hence the uk are bounded in h 1 2 s 0 and a subsequence not relabeled will weakly converge in h 1 2 s 0 to a function u such that 7 24 uk u in l 2 s 0 since the embedding from h 1 2 s 0 into l 2 s 0 is compact and we would deduce 7 25 s 0 u 2 1 and also 7 26 s 0 v u 2 0 gravity interacting with a yang mills field 27 a contradiction in the second case we only assume v 0 such that we may ignore the contribution of the higgs field to the quadratic form defined by the elliptic operator in equation 7 1 completely since its contribution is non negative and only look at the smaller operator 7 27 n 1 v n 2 rv 1 n 8 fijf ijv if we can prove that the eigenvalues of this operator are strictly positive then the eigenvalues of equation 7 1 are also strictly positive 7 6 theorem let s 0 be compact r 0 then the smallest eigenvalue of the operator 7 27 is strictly positive provided either r or fijf ij do not vanish everywhere proof under the assumptions the eigenvalues are always non negative and the spectral resolution described in lemma 7 1 is valid therefore assume that 0 0 and let u be a corresponding eigenfunction then 7 28 0 s 0 du 2 n 2 s 0 r u 2 1 n 8 s 0 fijf ij u 2 hence each of the integrals will vanish and we conclude that 7 29 u const and 7 30 r fijf ij 0 contradicting the assumptions 7 7 remark the eigenfunctions v of the eigenvalue problem 7 1 cer tainly have a mass if the assumptions of theorem 7 4 are satisfied and the eigenfunctions w of 7 9 have positive energy independently of any yang mills field only because of the interaction of gravity with the scalar field we therefore believe that the eigenfunctions v could be responsible for the dark matter and the corresponding eigenfunctions w for the dark energy where 7 31 u wv has to be a solution of the hyperbolic equation 6 48 on page 22 references 1 r arnowitt s deser and c w misner the dynamics of general relativity
