numerical bifurcation analysis of the conformal method james dilts michael holst tamara kozareva and david maxwell abstract the conformal formulation of the einstein constraint equations has been studied intensively since the modern version of the conformal method was first pub lished in the early 1970 s proofs of existence and uniqueness of solutions were limited to the constant mean curvature cmc case through the early 90 s with analogous results for the near cmc case beginning to appear thereafter in the last decade there has been some limited progress towards understanding the properties of the conformal method for far from cmc solutions as well although it was initially conceivable that that these far from cmc results would lead to a solution theory for the non cmc case that would mirror the good properties of the cmc and near cmc cases examples of bifurcations and of nonexistence of solutions have been since discovered nevertheless the general properties of the conformal method for far from cmc data remain unknown in this article we apply analytic and numerical continuation techniques to the study of the con formal method in an attempt to give some insight into what the solution behavior is in the far from cmc case in various scenarios contents 1 introduction 1 1 1 the conformal method 2 1 2 far from cmc results for the conformal method 4 2 tools from

where ricg is the ricci curvature tensor rg its scalar r ricabgab and t is the stress energy momentum tensor of any matter fields present once a time function has been chosen space time is foliated by space like constant time hypersurfaces t and evolution and constraint equations are obtained by considering the projections of the field equations 1 1 in directions tangent and orthogonal to the space like hypersurfaces the evolution equations can be cast as a first order system for the first and second fun damental forms associated with the time slices namely the three metric g and extrinsic curvature k with g and k symmetric tensors this represents 12 equations for the 12 components of g and k with the equations being first order in time and second order in space the four constraint equations on the 12 degrees of freedom are rg 2 k 2 g 0 1 2 div k d 0 1 3 withrg the scalar curvature of g and g ij k ij the trace of the extrinsic curvature these equations are direct consequences of the gauss codazzi mainardi conditions which are required for an 3 manifold to arise as a submanifold of a 4 manifold if matter and or energy sources are present then the 12 evolution equations and the four constraint equa tions 1 2 1 3 contain additional terms the constraint equations are obviously under determined as a stand alone system of equations for the initial data in that they fix only some part of the 12 degrees of freedom one must therefore make a choice of which parts of the initial data one wishes to fix and which parts are to be determined by the constraint equations 1 2 1 3 the conformal method described in the next section is an approach to parameterizing the initial data so that the constraint equations for the remaining degrees of freedom can potentially be uniquely solved it provides an effec tive parameterization of the constant mean curvature cmc solutions of the constraint equations and is generally effective for near constant mean curvatures as well there has been recent progress in determining its properties in the far from cmc setting and what little we know indicates the situation is somewhat complex the aim of this paper is to bring numerical methods and numerical bifurcation theory specifically to yield further insight into what can be expected for the conformal method when applied to far from cmc initial data 1 1 the conformal method the conformal method was proposed by lichnerowicz in 1944 37 and then substantially generalized in the 1970 s by york 49 among other authors the method is based on a splitting of the initial data g a riemannian metric on a space like hypersurface t and k the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface t into eight freely specifiable pieces with four remaining pieces to be determined by solving the four constraint equations the pieces of the initial data that are specified as part of the method are called the seed data and are comprised of a spatial background metric g on t defined up to multiplica tion by a conformal factor five free functions a positive function n a so called densi tized lapse a function and a transverse traceless tt tensor ij effectively two free functions as it is symmetric trace free and divergence free the two remaining pieces of the initial data to be determined by the constraints are a scalar conformal factor 0 2 and a vector potential w the full spatial metric g and the extrinsic curvature k are then recovered from w and the eight specified functions from the expressions g 4 g and k 2 1 2 n ckw 1 3 4 g this transformation has been engineered so that the constraints 1 2 1 3 reduce to coupled pdes for and w with standard elliptic operators as their principle parts in three spatial dimensions the equations are 8 r 2 3 2 5 12 nlw 2 7 0 1 4 div 1 2 n lw 2 3 6 d 0 1 5 here is the laplace beltrami operator with respect to the background metric g l denotes the conformal killing operator lw ij iwj jwi 23 kw k gij and k ij g ij is again the trace of the extrinsic curvature we note that the densitized lapse n is more commonly associated with the conformal thin sandwich method 50 but the equivalence of that method with the standard conformal method was demonstrated in 43 in particular the conformal method represents a family of parameterizations of the constraint equations within a given conformal class of metric one for each choice of n or one for each choice of metric representing the conformal class a detailed overview of the conformal method and its variations may be found in the 2004 survey 3 when is constant i e when the cauchy surface t has constant mean curvature then the term in equation 1 5 involving d vanishes and the two equations decouple the only solutions of 1 5 have lw 0 and it remains only to solve the lichnerowicz equation 1 4 with lw 0 a similar decoupling occurs for non vacuum seed data data initial work starting with 47 focused on the cmc case of the conformal method and a full description of the parameterization on compact manifolds was achieved in 31 the theory depends on on the yamabe invariant y g of the seed metric 1 and is summarized in table 1 table 1 constant mean curvature cmc

boundary models 18 39 results allowing for rough data 40 7 and numerical relativity e g 15 14 investigations of near cmc seed data began to appear in the mid 90 s and we point to 32 1 and 33 which developed the near cmc theory 2 on compact manifolds sum marized in table 2 1 recall that y g 0 if and only if g has a conformally related metric with positive scalar curvature and similarly for y g 0

none unique y g 0 unique unique the existence results in this table require an additional hypothesis that the background metric not have any conformal killing fields and it has been recently shown 25 that in some cases this hypothesis is necessary conformal killing fields form the kernel of the self adjoint elliptic operator appearing in equation 1 5 and their presence in terferes with iterative approaches to obtaining solutions nearly all theorems concerning non cmc seed data for the conformal method assume there are no conformal killing fields extensions of the near cmc theory are available in other asymptotic geometries asymptotically euclidean 9 asymptotically hyperbolic 34 and it has been applied in numerical relativity 16 5 24 48 1 2 far from cmc results for the conformal method in the last decade a handful of results have appeared concerning the conformal method in the far from cmc setting they provide the main context needed to understand our numerical experiments and we summarize them in somewhat more detail in this section building off of a strictly non vacuum result 29 the following theorem provides ex istence in vacuum for arbitrary mean curvatures so long as the background metric is yamabe positive and the tt tensor is sufficiently small theorem 1 1 41 let m g be a compact yamabe positive manifold with no confor mal killing fields given arbitrary vacuum seed data n if 6 0 is sufficiently small with smallness depends on the choice of then there exists at least one solution of the conformally parameterized constraint equations 1 4 1 5 variations on this theorem have subsequently been demonstrated in other contexts asymptotically euclidean manifolds 20 27 4 manifolds with asymptotically cylindri cal or periodic ends 12 13 and other settings 30 28 19 29 4 although theorem 1 1 is silent on the issue of uniqueness it is consistent with table 2 extending generally for arbitrary mean curvatures and there was some optimism that this might be the case when 29 41 appeared although it is evidently a far from cmc result the alterna tive perspective of 22 demonstrates that the solutions found in theorem 1 1 can also be thought of as rescalings of near cmc solutions that are perturbations off of 0 solutions as allowed in table 1 for yamabe positive seed data the following result is a consequence of a groundbreaking blowup analysis for the conformal method theorem 1 2 17 let mn g be a compact manifold without conformal killing fields and let n be vacuum seed data on it with 6 0 having constant sign if there does not exist a solution of the conformally parameterized constraint equations 1 4 1 5 then there exists a solution of the limit equation div 1 2 n lw n 1 n 12 n lw d 1 6 for some 0 1 4 see also 23 21 where theorem 1 2 has been extended to other settings the main idea behind the proof of the theorem is that if one cannot maintain l control on approx imate solutions of the conformally parameterized constraint equations then rescalings of the approximations eventually lead to a solution of the blowup profile 1 6 one po tential application of theorem 1 2 is to show solutions exist by ruling out the possibility of solutions of the limit equation 1 6 and indeed 17 contains a near cmc existence theorem with a large perturbation constant based on this idea although theorem 1 2 has proved difficult to apply in practice because of the challenge of working with equa tion 1 6 our numerical work suggests that it plays a decisive role in analyzing system 1 4 1 5 for constant sign mean curvatures for mean curvatures that change sign little is known in general aside from theorem 1 1 however 42 contains an analysis of some very specific families of seed data on the flat torus that includes the sign changing case among the seed data considered there is a family of mean curvatures of the form 1 a where is a particular dicontinuous piecewise constant function equal to 1 and tt tensors of the form for a particular reference tt tensor and an arbitrary constant theorem 1 3 42 for particular seed data on the flat torus t 3 of the form 1 a n if a 1 and hence changes sign there is an 0 depending on a so that if there is no solution of system 1 4 1 5 with the symmetry of the data but if 0 then there are at least two solutions this was the first theorem to demonstrate the existence of multiple solutions of the vacuum conformal method in the far from cmc setting although in involves yamabe null examples it cast doubt on the possibility that theorem 1 1 concerning yamabe positive seed data could be extended to include a uniqueness statement or that its small tt tensor requirement could be dropped the follow up study 44 contains additional results on related families of far from cmc data using ideas from 17 nguyen 45 recently showed conclusively that the restrictions of theorem 1 1 are essential theorem 1 4 45 let m g be a compact yamabe positive manifold m g with no conformal killing fields consider a family of seed data a n with a 0 r where is a fixed positive function assume additionally satisfies l d c d 2 1 7 for some c 0 and that is supported away from the critical points of then if a is sufficiently large and if is larger than a threshold depending on a the conformally parameterized constraint equations 1 4 1 5 do not admit a solution for the same a there is a sequence k 0 such that there are at least two solutions to these equations along the sequence and such that there is a solution with 0 the set of seed data satisfying these conditions is nonempty the restrictions on the seed data in theorem 1 4 are quite severe but the result is remarkable nevertheless in particular the existence of solutions at 0 for yamabe positive data was a surprise in addition to proving theorem 1 4 45 gives insight into the role of the deficiency parameter in the limit equation 1 6 and these unexpected 5 0 solutions on a yamabe positive manifold if there does not exist a solution for given seed data and if there does not exist a solution of the limit equation with 1 then there is in fact a solution for the same seed data but with 0 very recently nguyen obtained the following extension of theorem 1 4 theorem 1 5 46 let m g be a compact yamabe positive manifold m g with no conformal killing fields consider a family of seed data a n with a 0 r and where is a fixed positive function satisfying inequality 1 7 then for each a sufficiently large there is a m 0 depending on a such that if 0 m 0 there are at least two solutions of the conformally parameterized constraint equations and when 0 there is at least one while theorem 1 5 significantly relaxes many of the hypotheses of theorem 1 4 and strengthens some of its conclusions it makes no claims concerning non existence for large a point we will revisit in our numerical experiments inequality 1 7 needed for theorems 1 4 and 1 5 is non generic and our numerical work gives insight about the extent to which theorem 1 5 holds more generally in summary we have the following on yamabe positive manifolds arbitrary mean curvatures can be used for seed data so long as the tt tensor is small enough for certain families of yamabe positive seed data there are multiple solutions for small tt tensors moreover for these families of seed data there exist solutions at 0 something ruled out in the near cmc case table 2 additionally there are some cases where there are no solutions for large tt tensors on a particular yamabe null manifold with particular sign changing seed data we have multiple solutions for small tt tensors and nonexistence within the symmetry class for large tt tensors nothing specific is known for yamabe negative seed data the limit equation criterion holds for all yamabe classes but the question of the existence of solutions of the limit equation is essentially open these limited results provide our motivation to look at analytic bifurcation theory and closely related numerical continuation methods to try to gain intuition for what can be expected more generally from the conformal method in the far from cmc regime 2 tools from bifurcation analysis the unexpectedly complex behavior of solutions to the conformal method equations in the far from cmc regime leads one to the language and technical tools of analytic bifurcation theory this area of nonlinear analysis is the study of the branching of solu tions of nonlinear problems with respect to the parameters numerical continuation or numerical homotopy methods is a related area and refers to a collection of practical nu merical methods for computing solution branches of nonlinear problems through critical points such as folds and bifurcations 2 1 analytic bifurcation theory to explain the main ideas that are relevant here consider again the pde representation of the conformal method 1 4 1 5 but written more simply as the abstract nonlinear problem find u x such that f u 0 2 1 where f x z y for suitably chosen banach spaces x y and z and where z represents the parameters of interest that are moved through the parameter space 6 z in the setting of the conformal method and its variations one can consider various parameterizations once a parameterization is chosen one is interested in the local behavior of the solution curve u in a neighborhood of a known solution u 0 0 the techniques of both analytic and numerical bifurcation analysis rely on the implicit func tion theorem ift as the basic tool for doing this exploration given f x z y where x y and z are banach spaces if f u 0 0 0 if f and fu the freche t derivative of f are continuous on some region u v x r containing u 0 0 and if fu u 0 0 is nonsingular with a bounded inverse then there is a unique branch of solutions u to f u 0 for v moreover u is continuous with respect to in v the ift effectively states that if the linearization fu of the nonlinear operator operator f is nonsingular at the point u 0 0 then there is a unique solution u for each in a ball around 0 more details about this theorem and its proof can be found in 36 51 10 if fu is singular however the proof of the ift fails suggesting the possibility of two or more u branches or no solutions for some in every neighborhood around 0 the form of the branching depends on the structure of the subspaces associated with the linear maps fu u 0 0 and f u 0 0 in the case of a fold there is a one dimensional path through u 0 0 in the case of a simple or more general singular point there is the possibility of branch switching with two or more branches of solutions crossing through u 0 0 one of the central tools in analytic bifurcation theory is lyapunov schmidt reduc tion 52 to explain assume fu u 0 0 is a fredholm operator of index k and that dim n fu u 0 0 n define now projection operators p x x and q x x with p x n fu u 0 0 and i q y r fu u 0 0 equation 2 1 is equivalent to the pair i q f y z 0 2 2 qf y z 0 2 3 with y i p u and z pu equation 2 2 satisfies the assumptions of the ift and so one obtains a unique solution branch y z then substitutes into 2 3 to obtain the branching equation qf y z z 0 2 4 one then solves for z to get the branch u y z z in practice one solves 2 2 2 3 by expanding the operators in bases of n fu u 0 0 and n fu u 0 0 a more detailed description of the application of lyapunov schmidt reduction to varia tions of the conformal method may be found in 26 11 one of our goals here is to apply the reduction technique to the far from cmc parameterizations that were described ear lier more information on this decomposition can be found in 36 2 2 numerical bifurcation analysis to apply lyapunov schmidt reduction analyti cally one needs detailed information about the null and range spaces of the linearization operators fu and f u and therefore the technique is usually limited to model situations however by discretizing problem 2 1 it becomes tractable to explicitly compute the information one needs for a finite dimensional approximation of 2 1 the problem re tains the structure of 2 1 but the discretized problem now involves finite dimensional spaces x y rn and z rm where n is the resolution of the discretization e g number of finite element basis functions and m is the number of parameters one now numerically computes bases explicitly for the range and null spaces of what are now matrix operators fu and f moreover a numerical continuation algorithm can be 7 designed around a predictor corrector strategy one increments the parameter 0 1 as part of a prediction step followed by the use of newton s method to solve 2 1 to correct the solution u 0 u 1 where the fold or higher order singularity on the branch is encountered the linearization fu becomes singular leading to failure of new ton s method at the correction step to remedy this one adds a normalization equation n u s s s 0 that allows the larger coupled system involving f and n to again be solvable one of the standard normalization techniques is known as pseudo arclength continuation based on parameterizing s by arclength s these numerical techniques are well studied 35 and there are well established software packages that implement these techniques such as auto 6 we use auto as our primary tool in our numerical analysis of the conformal method for far from cmc seed data 3 numerical results the auto software package applies numerical bifurcation analysis to systems of or dinary differential equations thus to apply it to the conformal method we require seed data with sufficient symmetry so that the conformally parameterized constraint equations 1 4 1 5 reduce to odes once this is done the parameter space can be explored via homotopies starting with cmc solutions the following subsections describe a number of concrete datasets where we have done so and report on folds and the number of solu tions found as the mean curvature is made increasingly far from cmc and as the size of the tt tensor is varied some care is needed in interpreting our results if we find e g two solutions for a given seed data set it does not imply that there are only two rather with homotopies we chose starting from cmc data we were only able to find two there may be more that we did not find because we did not or were not able to explore the parameter space more broadly a similar caveat applies when we find no solutions there may be solutions that we did not find along our homotopies additionally because we seek solutions having the same symmmetry as the seed data in practice these are solu tions depending on only one coordinate of the underlying 3 manifold we cannot rule out the possibility of additional solutions that break this symmetry finally because of the high symmetry of our seed data our metrics always admit conformal killing fields and hence violate a key technical hypothesis of most theorems concering the conformal method with non cmc seed data 3 1 sign changing mean curvature in this section we examine properties of the con formal method when the far from cmc regime is reached via a sign changing mean curvature the conformal seed data has the following form the manifold is s 1 m 2 where m 2 is one of s 2 t 2 or a compact quotient h 2 of hyperbolic space we use s for the unit speed parameter along s 1 the mean curvature is 1 a cos s so a 0 is the cmc case and is sign changing whenever a 1 we work with two different classes of tt tensors 1 on a product mn 11 g 1 m n 2 2 g 2 the tensor n 1 g 2 n 2 g 1 3 1 is easily seen to be transverse traceless for many of our experiments we use a tt tensor of the form where is a constant 8 2 additionally on s 1 t 2 and on s 1 s 2 we can find a tt tensor with con stant nonzero norm that is pointwise orthogonal to lw for w w s ds these are easy enough to find on t 2 and appendix a describes a suitable construction on s 2 some of our experiments make use of tt tensors of the form where is a constant for simplicity of exposition we use a lapse density n 1 2 we conducted experiments with other choices for the lapse density but did not see qualitatively different phenomena for solutions s and w w s s of the conformally parameterized constraint equations 1 4 1 5 having the same symmetry as our seed data the constraint equations reduce to the coupled odes 8 r 2 3 2 5 2 3 2 w 2 7 2 7 3 2 2 w 6 3 3 wherer is the constant scalar curvature of the product manifold and where we set 0 if r 0 we start by examining solutions on s 1 t 2 and it turns out that the effects of the two tt tensors corresponding to the parameter and corresponding to the parameter are quite different in particular if 0 and hence it is easy to see that 1 6 and w a sin s solve system 3 2 these exact solutions are among those discussed in 44 and are the only solutions we were able to find using auto hence we obtain results consistent with existence and uniqueness for this family save for the exceptional case 0 where the solution degenerates to zero volume on the other hand fixing 0 figure 1 indicates the multiplicity of solutions found on s 1 t 2 with 1 a cos s and as the parameters a and are varied this computation is an analogue of the examples of 42 recalled in theorem 1 3 except that it involves a family of smooth rather than piecewise constant mean curvatures in the region where the mean curvature changes sign i e for a 1 we find a fold indicated by a solid blue line and no solutions when the tt tensor is sufficiently large figure 2 indicates how the volume of the solution metric changes changes as we traverse the gray dashed lines of figure 1 the plots in green indicate s 1 6 which agrees with volume up to an inessential constant factor depending on the second factor of the product manifold on the vertical gray dashed line corresponding to figure 2 left hand side the sign changing mean curvature is fixed and the size of the tt tensor is varied when the tt tensor is sufficiently large a fold appears and there are no solutions and as it is decreased to zero there are two solutions one heading to zero volume and the other blowing up the horizontal gray dashed line of figure 1 corresponds with figure 2 right hand side and we again observe the fold and a branch where the volume blows up it is difficult to ascertain from this graph the precise value of a where the blowup occurs and computationally we found it difficult to approach the singularity we find however that near the singularity the value of 6 along this line is in reasonable agreement with a growth rate a 1 5 14 in later related examples we find more conclusive evidence of blowup at a 1 so we infer this is the case here as well that is there is a transition at a 1 the threshold of sign changing mean curvatures the red dashed lines of figure 1 indicate locations where we have inferred blowup occurs the results we observe here are completely parallel with the prior analytical results of 42 found for a more restrictive mean curvature 9 0 0 0

hand graphs correspond with the vertical and horizontal gray dashed lines of figure 5 respectively 12 recalling that the only analytical results for sign changing mean curvatures are avail able in the yamabe null case we now consider the effect of changing the yamabe class in these computations we first consider the yamabe positive case by adjusting the previ ous computation by settingr 0 001 in system 3 2 e g by working on an appropriate s 1 s 2 as in the yamabe null setting when working with families of seed data with we found tame behavior one solution was found for each parameter on the other hand for seed data with and 1 a cos s the situation is more com plicated figure 3 indicates the multiplicity of solutions found for this family and can be compared directly with its yamabe null counterpart figure 1 the region of zero solutions has vanished and we find solutions exist always however in a region near the original yamabe null fold we find two folds and a narrow region of multiple solutions in between figure 4 shows the effect of traversing along the dashed gray lines of figure 3 and indicates how the family of solutions in this case corresponds with the yamabe null families in figure 2 note that the various blowup phenomena found in the yamabe null case have vanished the observed fold can be thought of as a purturbation of the situa tion at r 0 and separate computations show that as r is pulled away from zero and approaches e g r 1 the volume curves in figure 4 stablize further and the doubling back behavior vanishes turning to the yamabe negative case we set r 0 1 in equations 3 2 and use 0 since we do not have an equivalent for for yamabe negative seed data thus we use to scale the size of the tt tensor and unlike the yamabe positive and null cases when using we find interesting results figure 5 shows the number of solutions found when using mean curvatures of the form 1 a cos s note that unlike the parameter system 3 2 does not have even symmetry with respect to and hence our computations involved values of with both signs as the mean curvature is made increasingly far from cmc we find a fold and subsequently no solutions just as in the yamabe null case the second branch of solutions blows up at a 1 the value of a that transitions from constant sign to sign changing mean curvatures figure 6 right hand side on the other hand far enough into the far from cmc regime we were unable to find solutions of system 3 2 this is perhaps surprising since in the near cmc setting one can always find solutions when 0 unless 0 as well and indeed solutions at 0 are a hallmark of yamabe negative cmc seed data instead we find that at 0 as a is increased to make the solution far from cmc there is a fold around a 2 and no solutions were encountered beyond this point the absence of solutions appears to be loosely associated with the behavior when 0 i e 0 although one notes that the tip of the nose on the blue fold line of figure 5 does not lie on the line 0 therefore there are values of awhere no solutions exist at 0 but for which solutions exist for certain values of 6 0 3 2 constant sign mean curvatures we now examine excursions into the far from cmc regime using mean curvatures of the form a where is a positive function starting again with s 1 dependent data of the form of the previous section but now with mean curvature s 2 3 1 3 cos s a we were only able to find a single solution of the constraint equations for all choices of a and except as is expected when 0 in the yamabe non negative case we can understand the tame behavior we observed by appealing to the limit equation of theorem 1 2 for s 1 symmetric solutions of the s 1 dependent data we consider the limit equation becomes w n w n 3 4 13 and it is straightforward to show that this admits no solutions on s 1 theorem 3 1 let 0 be in c 1 then there are no nontrivial c 2 solutions w of the s 1 dependent limit equation 3 4 proof suppose w is a nontrivial solution and consider a maximal interval on which w does not vanish on this interval we have log w k log 3 5 where k if w 0 on the interval and k if w 0 hence w c k 3 6 for some constant c 6 0 at the endpoints of the interval w tends to zero but the right hand side of equation 3 6 is uniformly bounded away from zero strictly speaking theorem 1 2 does not apply in our setting because of the presence of conformal killing fields we expect however that one can use techniques found in 42 to adapt the main theorem of 17 to this specific family of data to conclude that the nonexistence of solutions to 3 4 implies existence of s 1 symmetric solutions the simple behavior seen for s 1 dependent data does not hold generally however throughout the remainder of this section we use conformal seed data of the following type the manifold is s 2 m 2 where m 2 is one of s 1 or h 2 we use 0 for a latitude parameter on s 2 the mean curvature a depends only on where 0 1 and 1 somewhere in practice we used 2 3 1 3 cos k with k 1 or 2 the tt tensor is where was introduced in equation 3 1 the lapse density is n 1 2 as a first example consider data on s 2 s 1 the reduced conformal constraint equa tions for latitude dependent data are more complicated than those for s 1 dependent data the main differential operators are f 1 r f cot f and divlw 3 w 3 cot w 1 2 r 1 3 cot 2 w d where f f and w w d we seek solutions of the constrant equations 1 2 1 3 the form andw w d supplemented with boundary conditions 0 and w 0 at 0 and needed to ensure regularity an additional boundary condition w 0 at 0 is effectively enforced by the momentum constraint figure 7 shows the number of solutions found on an s 2 s 1 with scalar curvature r 1 with and a relatively simple non cmc mean curvature 2 3 1 2 cos a theorem 1 5 would apply to this data except for the usual caveat about conformal killing fields and more crucially the fact that the mean curvature violates the non

for the large solution of the conformally parameterized constraint equations at a 2 46 1 in figure 7 the ratio is nearly 1 indicating that the vector field w of the solution is nearly a solution of the limit equation 1 6 solutions when both a is sufficiently large and 6 0 is sufficiently small moreover the transition to the far from cmc regime is abrupt starting at a 2 46 which we will call a figure 8 right hand side shows that a is associated with a blowup of a branch of solutions and one expects there is a solution of the limit equation 1 6 with 1 at a a indeed the limit equation arises as the hamiltonian constraint degenerates to the algebraic equation 2 3 6 12 n lw 3 7 which can then be substituted back into the momentum constraint figure 9 shows the ratio of the two sides of equation 3 7 for the larger of the two solutions at the point a 2 46 m 1 in figure 7 the ratio is nearly 1 so the solution vector field w at that point is nearly a solution of the limit equation the proofs of theorems 1 4 and 1 5 demonstrate the existence of multiple solutions for a large and small by showing that at 0 there is both a zero volume solution and a true solution and that perturbing off of these yields two solutions this mechanism is illustrated in figure 8 left hand side recall that solutions with 0 are impossible in the near cmc setting for yamabe positive seed data such as this and at the dotted line at 0 of figure 7 there is one less solution than at neighboring points so there is no solution to the left of the singularity at a a and just one solution to the right as a

figure 10 illustrates the multiplicity of solutions we found as we varied the parameters and a here again we find a sharp transition to the far from cmc setting now at a a 3 3 there is blowup associated with this transition figure 11 right hand side and again we presume there is a solution to the limit equation with 1 and a a for a a we find a solution at 0 in addition to the zero volume solution figure 11 left hand side and hence there two solutions for sufficiently small however we find an apparent difference between scaling large and positive versus large and negative for this seed data for positive and large enough depending on a there are no solutions just as was the case in figure 7 but for large and negative we were unable to find a fold and a consequential transition to zero solutions instead the two solutions remain well separated in volume as is made large figure 11 left hand side we cannot rule out the possibility that the two branches eventually merge but this was not the case out to 2500000 although this data violates inequality 1 7 of theorem 1 5 our observations are nevertheless consistent with its conclusions in particular unlike theorem 1 4 theorem 1 5 does not predict non existence for large tt tensors and it is conceivable that 1 5 holds more generally for mean curvatures not satisfying inequality 1 7 the previous two examples involve yamabe positive data to explore the other yam abe classes we consider latitude dependent data on s 2 h 2 by varying the size of the round s 2 factor we can obtain any desired constant scalar curvature before looking at the other yamabe classes however we remark that even for yamabe positive data of this type we find differences from what was observed for s 2 s 1 figure 12 illustrates the multiplicity of solutions found on an s 2 h 2 with r 0 1 where the seed data has and 2 3 1 3 cos a this seed data is comparable to that used for figure 7 but there are some fine differences in the results again we find a sharp transition to the far from cmc setting now at a a 2 8 however for a a the multiplicity of solutions is a bit complicated there is a primary fold roughly at a 3 23 in the far from cmc regime beyond this point the behavior is similar to that of figure 7 with no solutions when is sufficiently large and two solutions when 6 0 is sufficiently small between a a and a 3 23 however the situation has changed from that of figure 7 we found variously between 1 and 4 solutions and no convincing evidence that there are no solutions when is sufficiently large at e g a 2 87 figure 13 illustrates how the the various folds appear as the dashed line at 7 in figure 12 is traversed first the right most purple fold is encountered then the left most and finally the blue fold around a 3 23 is hit before heading off to the singularity at a a conversely figure 14 illustrates the various solutions along the line a 3 2 and we see two disconnected loops the upper branches in figure 14 left hand side rejoin at 800000 as was discussed previously for figure 8 figure 14 illustrates how one can visualize the multiple solutions near 0 as perturbations of the usual zero solution at 0 and the additional three non trivial solutions we found there turning to non yamabe positive seed data figure 15 illustrates the number of solu tions found with the same conformal data as in figure 12 except now with r 0 1 and r 0 for this seed data there are no applicable far from cmc theorems to guide expectations and we find a situation similar to the yamabe negative sign changing data of figure 5 there is a sharp transition to far from cmc data at a 2 8 but now solutions vanish sufficiently far into the far from cmc regime the blue fold from the 18 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 a 30 20 10 0 10 20

having r 0 2 left r 0 middle and r 0 1 right mean curvature 2 3 1 3 cos a conformal seed data is the same as in figures 12 and 15 yamabe positive data of figure 12 persists but the purple fold that extended out along the line 0 has vanished the apparent non existence of solutions far enough into the far from cmc regime violates the conclusion of theorem 1 5 and we therefore suspect that the yamabe positive hypothesis of theorem 1 5 is essential although the vertical scales for figures 12 and 15 are markedly different it is not the case that we have missed a fine feature near the line 0 in figure 15 corresponding to the purple folds of figure 12 indeed figure 16 illustrates the volume of solutions along the line 0 i e 0 for the three cases r 0 2 r 0 and r 0 1 illustrated in figures 12 and 15 for far from cmc yamabe positive seed data figure 16 right hand side we find solutions at 0 these solutions are not present for near cmc data and had not been expected before 45 by contrast for the yamabe negative seed data the near cmc solutions at 0 vanish once the mean curvature is sufficiently far from cmc figure 16 left hand side at the boundary r 0 figure 16 middle we find a narrow band in which solutions exist none in the near cmc case which is expected and none for the far from cmc seed data as well the narrow band is reminiscent of the well known one parameter family of solutions found found for cmc yamabe null seed data when 0 and when 0 it is also similar to the somewhat analogous one parameter families found for particular yamabe null seed data in 42 and 44 what would have been a vertical line of solutions in the analytic cases has been deformed to the distorted vertical line of figure 16 middle the role of solutions at 0 appears to be important for understanding the conformal method in the far from cmc setting and we believe this is a consequence of being absent from the limit equation nevertheless the interplay between 0 and 6 0 is nuanced for example the breakdown of the existence of solutions along 0 for yamabe negative data figure 16 left hand side at a 3 2 is not perfectly correlated with nonexistence of solutions for nearby values of a this can be seen by inspecting the blue fold of figure 15 left hand side it crosses 0 at a value a 3 2 but there nevertheless exist certain solutions for values of a 3 2 beyond the crossing point but not much larger finally we consider seed data on s 2 h 2 with and 2 3 1 3 cos 2 a 21 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 a 40000 20000 0 20000 40000 1 solution 2 solutions no solutions 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 a

1 3 cos 2 a and the solid blue line indicates a fold whereas the red dashed line indicate locations where blowup is inferred the blue dotted lines at 0 indicate one solution has zero volume and should be ignored which can be compared with the seed data used for figure 10 figure 17 illustrates the number of solutions found for r 0 and r 0 5 and the outcomes are qualitatively similar to those of figure 10 in particular for 0 we do not find evidence of non existence of solutions on the other hand for this same data but r 1 2 we obtain multiplicities shown in figure 18 and find a situation akin to what we have seen previ ously in figure 5 and figure 15 left hand side for yamabe negative data no solutions for a sufficiently large in an independent computation not shown we found that the location of the blue fold crossing 0 e g at a 108 in figure 18 grows as r 13 and therefore we believe there is indeed a transition at r 0 between the two qualitative behaviors seen here for r 1 2 and r 1 2 4 discussion the limit equation 1 6 appears to play a central role in the solution theory of the conformal method at least for mean curvatures that do not change sign in the cases where we could show that there is no solution of the limit equation with the symmetry of the data s 1 dependent seed data on s 1 m 2 we were also unable to find behavior that was any different from the near cmc theory for the remaining cases where we investigated constant sign mean curvatures a there was a singular value a for a a we found differences from the near cmc theory multiple solutions or non existence of solutions were the general rule with exceptions occuring only at transitions such as folds as a a from above we found solutions of the constraint equations with volumes that appeared to approach infinity in particular it was always possible to find such solutions with 0 we conjecture that at a a there is a solution of the limit equation with 1 in which case for each a a there is also a solution of the limit equation with a a 1 that is far from cmc behavior appears to occur precisely when a solution to the limit equation exists for some 0 1 for sign changing mean curvatures we found a corresponding transition to far from cmc phenomena once the mean curvature changed sign this was certainly true for the yamabe negative and yamabe null data we examined and at least weakly so for the yamabe positive data of figure 3 where narrow folds occurred but unique solutions were 22 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 a 2000 1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 1 solution 2 solutions no solutions figure

is inferred more typical in any event in these examples non standard behaviour only occurred for conformal seed data where the mean curvature changed sign in may be a that a better parameterization for sign changing mean curvatures different from 1 a would provide a sharper more definitive transition although theorem 1 1 does not apply strictly speaking to our examples as they possess nontrivial conformal killing fields our observations were consistent with it whenever we worked with yamabe positive seed data we were able to find solutions of the constraint equations so long as 6 0 was small enough figures 3 7 10 12 and 17 right hand side conversely except for cases where we could show that there was not a solution of the limit equation far from cmc yamabe negative seed data lead to non existence sufficiently far into the non cmc zone figures 6 15 left hand side and 18 this was true even at 0 in stark contrast to the near cmc theory the situation for yamabe null data is harder to characterize sometimes it behaved like yamabe positive data figures 1 and 17 left hand side with solutions existing for sufficiently small tt tensors sometimes it behaved like yamabe negative data figure 15 right hand side with solutions vanishing far enough into the far from cmc zone moreover the analytical work of 42 shows that other variations are also possible the conclusions of theorem 1 5 were found to hold generally even for mean curva tures that violate inequality 1 7 so long as there appeared to be a solution of the limit equation that is for far from cmc yamabe positive data with constant sign mean cur vature we found that there were at least two solutions when the tt tensor was small enough and that there was at least one corresponding nonzero solution at 0 on the other hand theorem 1 4 which also describes non existence for yamabe positive far from cmc seed data when the tt tensor is large was not found to hold in general indeed we found a hodge podge of apparent non existence phenomena on 23 yamabe positive seed data sometimes there was an immediate onset of nonexistence behavior in the far from cmc zone figure 7 sometimes nonexistence was brought on by scaling the tt by a large constant of one sign but not for large constants of the other sign figures 10 and 17 right hand side in one case figure 12 there appeared to be certain far from cmc seed data that did not lead to nonexistence regardless of how large the tt tensor was scaled and in the sign changing yamabe positive case we examined existence appeared to be pervasive figure 3 it is similarly hard to pin down precise non existence behavior for the yamabe null seed data we examined we saw no apparent rule to describe the profiles of the various folds we saw that is we were unable to discern anything that might help concretely predict the threshold of non existence when scaling the tt tensor or the specific number of solutions corre sponding to given seed data although zero one or two solutions were typical sometimes there were more 5 conclusion our numerical work suggests that the conformal method appears to suffer from per vasive drawbacks as a parameterization of vacuum non cmc solutions of the constraint equations at least among the data we considered the general rule was multiple solutions or no solutions at all once the conformal seed data was sufficiently far from cmc be cause of the limitations of auto we were only able to examine highly symmetric seed data and we therefore only probed a select few very special examples nevertheless it is difficult to imagine that the many cases of multiple solutions we found are not stable under small perturbations of the metric that violate symmetry our results suggest a couple of theorems that might be reasonable targets for fu ture efforts for example can non existence of solutions for sufficiently far from cmc yamabe negative seed data be established however we caution that it is possible that describing the details of the conformal method for far from cmc data will lead to a fuller understanding of the conformal method but also to nothing useful about general relativity unless there is some physics associated with to the multiplicity of solutions or the various shapes of the folds it may simply be that the conformal method is an excel lent parameterization of the cmc solutions of the constraints that breaks down as a chart on the larger constraint manifold since the conformal method is the only general tool available for constructing solutions of constraint equations de novo it raises the ques tion of whether a suitable alternative parameterization for non cmc initial data exists one potential was proposed in 38 and examined for near cmc constructions in 25 but its properties in the far from cmc setting are unknown and the broader question of finding a well behaved global parameterization of solutions of the constraint equations is essentally open 6 acknowledgments jd was supported in part by
