newman to show the relation between the stu tzfunktion of the former theory and the cut function introduced by ted this leads to a conjectured inequality for space like two spheres in minkowski space that generalises minkowski s inequality and is implied by penrose s cosmic censorship hypothesis 1 introduction the work described in this paper arises from a problem posed to me by ted newman during my first visit to the university of pittsburgh in the mid 1970 s it turns out that this problem can be solved by newman style methods and that it leads on to making interesting connections with other areas of ted s work the problem is as follows given a cut of the future null infinity i of minkowski space m how do you reconstruct a space like 2 surface s inside m such that is the intersection with i of j s the boundary of the future of s this is related to a version of the fuzzy point idea which was current at that time if is a cut of the i of a non flat but asymptotically flat space time m arising from a point p in m known then as a light cone cut then when transferred to the i of m will determine a null hypersurface n which does not converge to a point however n may nearly converge to a point and may determine small 2 surfaces s which are nearly points or are fuzzy points if so then by taking all possible for all possible p in m one might obtain a representation of the curved space time m as fuzzy points in the flat space time m the plan of this paper is as follows in section 2 i discuss convex bodies in r 3 the theory of convex bodies centres on the stu tzfunktion or support function which i ll anglicise as stutzfunction and i review some of this theory in section 3 i turn to minkowski space and identify the relation between the stutzfunction of a convex body and the cut function which the boundary of the future of the body defines at i this effectively solves the problem posed above and it also illuminates some of the theory in section 2 in section 4 i sketch some further developments of the theory of convexity for 2 surfaces in minkowski space these include an approach to an inequality found by gibbons and penrose 13 5 as a prediction of the cosmic censorship hypothesis it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this paper to ted newman in his 60 th year 1 to acknowledge his long standing and beneficial influence and to record my debt and gratitude to him this is a corrected revised and updated version of a paper which originally appeared in recent advances in general relativity eds a i janis and j r porter einstein studies vol 4 birkhau ser 1992 1 note the previous footnote 1 http arxiv org abs 1710 10052 v 1 2 convex bodies in r 3 in this section i develop some standard theory of convex bodies in r 3 following 1 and 3 but with the kind of formalism that i learned from ted newman we may define a convex body b in r 3 to be a closed body such that if p q are two points of b then the line segment tp 1 t q for 0 t 1 lies entirely in b then a convex surface s is the surface of a convex body we define the gauss map in the familiar way choose an orthonormal triad and parametrise a unit vector by spherical polars as sin cos sin sin cos 1 in the triad thus corresponds to a point on the unit sphere s 2 given a choice of that is a choice of take the plane with normal that is tangent to the convex surface s with the outward normal if this happens at p s then the gauss map from s to s 2 takes p to the point labelled on the unit sphere for a smooth strictly convex body the gauss map is one one as we shall see in that case we have introduced coordinates on s the tangent plane to s at p has the equation x h 2 where h is the perpendicular distance from the origin which we ll assume to be inside s to the tangent plane a knowledge of h determines s as an envelope of tangent planes and h is the stu tzfunktion 1 or support function which we ll call the stutzfunction to obtain a parametric expression for the surface s we can solve 2 and its derivatives for x y z to this end we introduce the newman penrose operator eth 12 defined on a spin weight s function by 1 2 sin s i sin sin s and define m 1 2 cos cos i sin cos sin i cos sin m 1 2 cos cos i sin cos sin i cos sin these have s 1 1 respectively and by differentiating again m 0 m m m the positive definite metric of r 3 can be written mm mm 3 note also as usual that s 4 when has spin weight s to obtain the convex surface parametrically we must solve 2 simultaneously with x m h x m h which with the aid of 3 can be solved to give x x h hm hm 5 2 this gives an explicit parametrisation of s using the standard theory of surfaces in r 3 see e g 2 we find the area element of s to be da h h 2 2 h 2 h sin d d 6 by general theory the jacobian of the gauss map is the gauss curvature k so that k 1 r 1 r 2 h h 2 2 h 2 h 7 in terms of principal radii of curvature r 1 r 2 a similar calculation gives the mean curvature h h 1 2 r 11 r 1 2 h h k so that hda h h sin d d for use below note that then s hda s 2 h sin d d 8 since is a constant multiple of the 2 sphere laplacian so the second term integrates to zero for strict convexity we require r 1 r 2 0 which is equivalent to h k 0 since necessarily h 2 k it is sufficient to require k 0 h will be positive somewhere on s since we are using the outward normal finally since this is the jacobian of the gauss map the gauss map is one one and onto precisely for smooth strictly convex surfaces this imposes restrictions on h which we shall discuss first we note how simple the gauss bonnet theorem is in this context proposition 2 1 the gauss bonnet theorem for a strictly convex surface s s kda 4 proof from 6 and 7 kda sin d d now what conditions do we requireh to satisfy for it to be the stutzfunction of a smooth strictly convex surface we need h positive and in 7 we want the right hand side to be positive if it fails to be positive then the surface enveloped by 2 will have cusps however if k from 7 is not positive then it can be made positive by adding a positive constant to h the process of adding a positive constant to h is an interesting transformation that changes a convex surface s into another s which is parallel to it in the sense of 15 in that reference the idea is motivated by imagining rolling a sphere k of constant radius s over the surface s the locus of the centre of k defines s equivalently one moves the centre of k over s and takes s to be envelope swept out by k in this second form one sees a connection with the idea of huyghens secondary wavelets which will reappear in section 3 given a convex surface s one can consider a sequence of surfaces parallel to s with larger and larger separations s in this way one arrives at the following string of theorems proposition 2 2 steiner s theorem along such a sequence the area is given by a s a 2 sm 4 s 2 9 while the volume contained is v s v sa s 2 m 4 3 s 3 10 3 here a and v are the area and volume of s and m is the integral of mean curvature m s hda 11 proof clearly the surface parallel to s at distance s has stutzfunction h s substitute into 6 and expand in powers of s to obtain 9 using 8 along the way integrate 9 to obtain 10 along a sequence of parallel surfaces the surfaces should become rounder this intuitive feeling is made precise in the following which i won t prove proposition 2 3 the brunn minkowski theorem define r s v s 1 3 then r is convex in s in that d 2 r ds 2 0 take this to be true and calculate the derivative then for positive s 6 mv 2 a 2 2 s 12 v am 2 s 2 4 a m 2 0 12 from this we may deduce minkowski s inequality m 2 4 a 13 as well as the isoperimetric inequality 36 v 2 a 3 14 although 13 follows from 12 there is a straightforward direct proof due to blaschke and using the stutzfunction see 1 blaschke s proof of minkowski s inequality from 6 4 and integration by parts a h 2 h h sin d d while from 8 m h sin d d set h h 0 h 1 where h 1 sin d d 0 and h 0 is constant then m 4 h 0 a 4 h 2 0 h 21 h 1 h 1 sin d d it follows by expanding h 1 in spherical harmonics that the integral contribution to a is strictly negative unless h 1 is a combination of 1 spherical harmonics this case corresponds to a sphere with a translated origin so that 13 is proved with equality only for a round sphere to conclude this section i shall record another way of obtaining the surface s from the stutzfunction h define h r rh f x y z where x y z are expressed in terms of spherical polar coordinates r in the usual way then 5 is equivalent to the parametrisation given by x f x y f y z f z where after the differentiation x y z are again eliminated 4 3 stutzfunction and cut function in minkowski space m we introduce the null tetrad a 1 ma a 0 m ma a 0 m na 1 2 1 with m as in section 2 the minkowski metric can then be written ab 2 anb 2 m amb note that ma 0 1 2 a na define the unit time like vector ta 1 0 15 so that also abt a b 1 and introduce advanced null polar coordinates u r by xa uta r a see e g 7 then u are coordinates on i which is located at r a cut of i is defined by a function u v where v can conveniently be called the cut function for the cut if we choose an arbitrary point p with coordinates xa 0 and a null vector a 0 0 at p then the null geodesic from p in the direction of a 0 0 meets i at u xa 0 a 0 0 0 0 16 now suppose we are given a convex surface s in the form xa 0 x with x determined by a stutzfunction h according to 5 the boundary of the future of s j s is ruled by null geodesics that meet s orthogonally from the definitions so far made the outward null normal at the point p of s labelled by 0 0 is a 0 0 and the null geodesic from p in this direction meets i at u given by 16 as p runs over s the cut j s i is generated with the cut function u xa a x 17 comparing 17 with 2 we conclude that the cut function is minus the stutzfunction conversely if we are given the cut and its cut function v then 17 determines a null hypersurface n xa a v which with its angular derivatives we can solve for n parametrically as xa xa hna hma hma a for arbitrary real now intersecting n with hypersurfaces of constant t i e hypersurfaces orthogonal to ta in 15 gives a sequence of parallel surfaces in the sense of section 2 this shows how the parallel surface idea is related to huyghen s secondary wavelets if a convex surface is 5 momentarily lit up then the resulting expanding out going wave front traces out a sequence of surfaces parallel to the first of course this converse is incomplete in the following sense if what we are given is just the cut function then we can define the null surface n but we cannot fix a unique value of to represent the 2 surface s without some extra input if we are trying to make precise the fuzzy point idea then we might want to pick out an instant of minimum volume or of best focus this could also involve boosting the cut function or considering a different set of constant time hypersurfaces 4 further developments in this last section i describe some attempts to carry over other parts of the theory of convex 2 surfaces into minkowski space i shall work with the ghp formalism 4 and omit proofs a space like 2 surface s in m defines a pair of future pointing null normals a na where we shall take a to be the outward normal and na the inward normal or equivalently a normalised spinor dyad oa a the second fundamental form of s is coded by the ghp formalism into weighted scalars see e g 16 for an account of this in terms of these i shall say that s is future convex iff 0 2 0 past convex iff 0 2 0 we recall that the gauss curvature of s is twice the real part of the complex curvature q 14 proposition 4 1 if s is future and past convex then the gauss curvature of s is everywhere positive proof this is elementary since k 2 2 2 and 2 2 2 2 the quantities occuring in the above definitions of convexity arise in the various gauss maps that can be defined for s if we choose and fix a constant normalised spinor dyad a a then we can define a future gauss map by f s cp 1 p 7 oa a oa a and a past gauss map by f s cp 1 p 7 a a a a equivalently these express oa and a in terms of a a as oa a a 1 1 2 a a a 1 1 2 where are not fixed by the gauss maps but note that ta a 1 2 tana 1 2 6 where taa 1 2 a a a a so that ta is a unit time like vector determined by the chosen tetrad these gauss maps are similar to but different from those defined by kossowski 8 there is a third gauss map conveniently called the complex gauss map which can be defined by 2 o a b a b 2 a b a b where this are to be distinguished from the previous this maps s to the complex quadric q defined by 2 1 in c 3 this gauss map has also been considered by roger penrose the images of the future and past gauss maps carry volume forms 4 d d 1 2 and 4 d d 1 2 while q admits the holomorphic 2 form d d 2 d d 2 d d so that we can calculate the jacobians for the gauss maps as in section 2 proposition 4 2 for the future gauss map we find 4 d d 1 2 1 ta a 2 2 da for the past gauss map 4 d d 1 2 1 tana 2 2 da and for the complex gauss map d d da as in section 2 we integrate these expressions over s proposition 4 3 generalised gauss bonnet theorem for the three cases treated above integration gives s 1 ta a 2 2 da s 1 tana 2 2 da 4 tata 18 s da 2 in 18 i have included the term tata explicitly both to give a slightly more general formula valid when ta is any constant time like vector and to point up the resemblance to newman s expression for the h space metric 10 next we turn to consideration of possible generalisations of the notion of parallel bodies and propositions 2 2 2 4 for this we need to write down and solve the sachs equations which are the np spin coefficient equations for the evolution of and 11 given s we consider the null hypersurface n generated by the outgoing null normals to s we scale a to be affinely parametrised d a b b a 0 and choose an affine parameter s with ds 1 s 0 at s 7 then the sachs equations are d 2 d 2 while the area element is carried along a according to d da 2 da then the sachs equations can be solved explicitly as s 1 0 s 20 0 0 s 1 0 19 with 1 2 s 0 s 2 20 0 0 and 0 0 are the values at s for the area element we similarly find da s da 0 we deduce at once the following proposition proposition 4 4 for a future convex surface the outgoing null hypersurface encounters no caustics to the future proof caustics to the future are signalled by singularities in s or equivalently zeroes in for positive s but from the definition of future convex is positive definite in this range there is a corresponding statement for past convex for the analogue of proposition 2 2 steiner s theorem we need to integrate da s however there is a problem of weights in the ghp sense at this point we have the freedom to rescale a at s by a a 20 and under this transformation s 1 s 0 0 0 0 so that we would not get a formula like 9 by simply integrating da s the simplest way to resolve this difficulty is to choose a constant unit time like vector ta and define s sta a as s is unchanged by 20 and now we can integrate da s proposition 4 5 generalised steiner theorem a s a 0 2 s m 4 s 2 where m s 0 ta a da 21 and we have used proposition 4 3 8 now we might hope to prove a counterpart of the brunn minkowski theorem proposition 2 3 or of minkowski s inequality proposition 2 4 however this is impossible since with m as in 21 examples can be found to show that it is not the case that m 2 4 a in fact the isoperimetric inequality 14 can also be violated in minkowski space in the following sense given a space like 2 surface s one may be able to find space like 3 surfaces spanning s on which the volume v enclosed by s and the area a of s have 36 v 2 a 3 the correct inequality to generalise 13 would seem to be one proposed by gibbons and penrose in an investigation of cosmic censorship 13 5 this may be phrased as follows consider the vector p a 1 2 s a na da s pada 22 with pa 1 2 a na if s is future convex with 0 as well or past convex with 0 as well then one conjectures the inequality pap a 2 a 23 where a is the area of s this is not the form in which the inequality is stated by gibbons and penrose but i believe it to be equivalent note that the mean curvature vector ha of s equivalently the trace of the second funda mental form is ha 1 2 a na 24 the significance of ha is that given a vector field x a on s the rate of change of the area of s under displacement along xa is a s hax ada we see that the vector pa in 22 lies in the normal 2 plane to s and is orthogonal to ha so it defines the direction in which da does not change to first order also by taking xa to be a constant translation under which the area will not change it is clear that s hada 0 and so s ada s nada thus we can write p a as p a s nada s ada in this form it is clear that p a is time like and future pointing for past or future convex s as partial confirmation of 23 we note that if s lies in a flat space like 3 surface with unit time like normal ta then p a 1 2 mta with m as in 11 thus in this case 23 is minkowski s inequality further if s lies in an in or out going null cone then 23 can be established directly as it reduces to an inequality for functions on the unit sphere 13 5 which can be proved 16 17 finally one can verify 23 for surfaces infinitesimally close to a round sphere in a flat hyperplane what is still lacking is a proof of 23 in full generality subject only to the conditions of convexity 2 2 the claimed proof in 6 is
