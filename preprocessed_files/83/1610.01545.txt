national academy of sciences of ukraine 3 b naukova street lviv 79060 ukraine the typical motions of a spinning test particle in schwarzschild s background which show the strong repulsive action of the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling are considered using the exact mathisson papapetrou equations an approximated approach to choice solutions of these equations which describe motions of the particle s proper center of mass is developed pacs numbers 04 20 q 95 30 sf i introduction for over 50 years the effects of general relativity in strong gravitational fields of massive compact objects schwarzschild s and kerr s black holes neutron stars quasars are the focus of many studies relevant results are presented in the classical books on general relativity 1 2 also note that the recent historical registration of the gravitational waves is directly related to the interac tion and merger of the two massive black holes 3 the existence of some strong gravitational fields is not only caused by the large masses it is pointed out in 4 12 that when an ordinary not so great schwarzschild mass is moving with the velocity close to the speed of light its gravitational field becomes much grater than the field of this mass at rest it means that in terms of the gravitoelectric field e i k and the gravitomagnetic field b i k which are determined in 13 some components of e i k and b i k are proportional to or 2 is the relativistic lorentz factor the values e i k determine the tidal forces 11 12 whereas the components b i k act on a spinning test particle similarly as the usual mag netic field acts on a rotating charge according to the known mathisson papapetrou mp equations 14 15 it is shown in 16 25 that just the highly relativistic regime of spinning particle motions in schwarzschild s and kerr s background reveals new features of the grav itational interaction when the velocity of a spinning particle is not very high the gravitational spin orbit and spin spin interactions were considered in 26 it is im portant that depending on the correlation of signs of the spin and the particle s orbital velocity the spin gravity coupling acts as a significant repulsive or attractive force the purpose of this paper is to present new results con cerning different physical situations in schwarzschild s background when a spinning test particle feels the strong repulsive action caused by the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling note that the consideration of these antigravity effects may be useful in the context of the repulsive phenomenon in cosmology for example some corresponding results can be generalized for the schwarzschild de sitter metric the paper is organized as follows in sec ii we develop the results of paper 22 concerning the properties of the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background in the case of the strong repulsive action of the spin gravity coupling the energy and angular momentum on these orbits are considered sections iii and iv are devoted to the specific repul sive features of the noncircular highly relativistic trajec tories of a spinning particle which begins to move with rg r 1 5 rg in sec iv an approximated method of selection solutions of the exact mp equations which describe the motions of the particle s proper center of mass is elaborated and used in computer calculations we conclude in sec v ii energy and angular momentum of a spinning particle on highly relativistic circular orbits in schwarzschild s background it is known that the geodesic circular orbits of a spin less test particle in a schwarzschild background are allow able only for r 1 5 rg r is the radial coordinate and rg is the horizon radius and the highly relativistic circular or bits exist only for r 1 5 rg 1 where 0 1 1 2 the situation with possible circular orbits of a spinning test particle in schwarzschild s background is another the space region of existence of the relevant highly rel ativistic circular orbits is much wider 19 22 in par ticular it is shown that due to the significant repulsive action of the spin gravity coupling the highly relativis tic circular orbits of a spinning test particle are possible for r 1 5 rg it means that the corresponding solutions of the mp equations differ essentially from the solutions of the geodesic equations and the worldlines and trajec tories of the spinning and spinless particles which start with the same initial values of the coordinates and veloc ity are not close in addition in this section we compare the values of the energy and angular momentum of the corresponding spinning and spinless particles like the geodesic equations the mp equations in schwarzschild s metric have the constants of motion the energy e and the angular momentum j we take into account the mp equations in the form http arxiv org abs 1610 01545 v 2 2 14 15 d ds mu u ds ds 1 2 u s r 1 ds ds u u ds ds u u ds ds 0 2 where u dx ds is the particle s 4 velocity s is the tensor of spin m and d ds are respectively the mass and the covariant derivative along u and r is the riemann curvature tensor units c g 1 are used here and in the following latin indices run 1 2 3 and greek indices 1 2 3 4 the signature of the metric is chosen as usual these equations are considered with some supplementary condition and most often the mathisson pirani condition 14 27 s u 0 3 or tulczyjew dixon one 28 29 s p 0 4 are used where p mu u ds ds 5 is the particle 4 momentum both at 3 and 4 the constant of motion of the mp equations is s 20 1 2 s s 6 where s 0 is the absolute value of spin in different contexts the mp equations are taken into account in many recent papers 30 44 in 19 22 equations 1 and 2 are considered in schwarzschild s metric using the standard coordinates x 1 r x 2 x 3 x 4 t to describe the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in the plane 2 in these coordinates the constants of the particle s energy and angular momentum are e mu 4 g 44 u ds 4 ds 1 2 s 4 g 44 7 j mu 3 g 33 u ds 3 ds 1 2 s 3 g 33 8 in the following we shall use the dimensionless quantities yi connected with the particle s coordinates and velocity y 1 r m y 2 y 3 y 4 t m 9 y 5 u 1 y 6 mu 2 y 7 mu 3 y 8 u 4 10 where m is the schwarzschild mass then the equations which determine the region of existence of the circular or bits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background and the dependence of the particle s angular velocity on the radial coordinate can be written as 22 y 37 y 1 3 2 y 8 y 1 1 0 y 27 y 1 3 y 7 2 y 1 3 0 y 8 y 31 y 2 1 0 11 y 8 1 2 y 1 1 2 1 y 21 y 2 7 12 where 0 s 0 mm 1 13 equation 11 follows directly from the mp equations 1 and 2 at condition 3 for the schwarzschild metric when the spinning particle is moving in the plane 2 with the spin orthogonal to this plane and equation 12 is a simple consequence of the condition u u 1 figures 3 5 in 22 illustrate the dependence of the lorentz factor on r for the orbital velocity which is necessary for the particle motions on the circular orbits with r const in the region 2 m r 3 m 1 it is noted in 22 that all orbits in figs 3 5 are possible due to the significant repulsive action of the spin gravity coupling let us compare the values of the energy and angu lar momentum for the spinning and spinless particles which begin to move with r from the region 2 m r 3 m 1 we consider the case when a spinning parti cle is moving on the circular orbits as in the pointed out above situations from 22 and a spinless particle begins to move with the same initial velocity there are expres sions for e and j according to 7 and 8 in notations 9 and 10 e m 1 2 y 1 y 8 m 0 y 1 y 1 3 y 37 14 j mmy 21 y 7 mm 0 1 2 y 1 1 3 y 1 y 38 15 narurally at 0 0 from 14 and 15 the corresponding expressions follow for the spinless particle using the corresponding solutions of eqs 11 and 12 in 14 and 15 we obtain the graphs which present the dependence of the particle s energy and angular mo mentum on r in different subregions of the region 2 m r 3 m 1 figures 1 and 2 show the subregions where the energy and angular momentum of a spinning particle significantly differ from the energy and angu lar momentum of a corresponding spinless particle and where these values are close as in 22 here we put 3 fig 1 energy vs radial coordinate for the circular orbits of a spinning particle solid line and for the geodesic motions dotted line with the same initial velocity the three pictures correspond to the different intervals and scaling by r fig 2 angular momentum vs radial coordinate for the circu lar orbits of a spinning particle solid line and for the geodesic motions dotted line with the same initial velocity the three pictures correspond to the different intervals and scaling by r s 2 s 0 then d ds 0 0 10 2 note that according to 22 the orbits with r larger then 3 01 are not highly relativistic and here factor is close to 1 among all highly relativistic circular orbits of a spin ning particle in schwarzschild s background the orbit with r 3 m 1 5 rg has a specific feature the solu tion which describes this orbit is the same for the exact mp equations and for their linear spin approximation and is common for conditions 3 and 4 other highly relativistic circular orbits do not have this property it is pointed out in 22 25 45 that in general for the correct description of the highly relativistic orbits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background condition 3 is more appropriate according to 22 the dependence of the factor on 0 for the highly relativistic circular orbits is determined by the value 1 0 the same dependence on 0 takes place for e and j on these orbits iii beyond the circular orbits in addition to the results on the properties of the highly relativistic circular orbits important information con cerning the possibilities of the strong repulsive action on a spinning particle follows from the shape of the highly relativistic noncircular orbits we begin from the orbits which start with r 3 m and correspond to different values of the particle s orbital velocity to describe most general motions of a spinning parti cle without restrictions on its velocity and spin orienta tion in schwarzschild s and kerr s backgrounds by the exact mp equations at condition 3 the representation of these equations was developed using the integrals of energy and angular momentum 21 25 in the more sim ple particular case of the equatorial noncircular motions of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background the corresponding equations can be written as 46 y 5 y 25 y 1 y 1 1 3 y 1 2 y 27 1 y 21 e 0 y 7 y 1 j 0 y 1 y 25 1 2 y 1 1 y 27 y 2 1 1 2 16 y 7 y 5 y 7 y 1 y 1 y 27 1 y 2 1 y 5 y 7 3 y 7 y 1 e 0 1 y 1 y 5 0 1 j y 7 y 25 1 2 y 1 1 y 27 y 2 1 1 2 17 y 1 y 5 y 3 y 7 18 where e e m j j mm 19 and a dot denotes the usual derivative with respect to x s m by choosing different values of e and j for the fixed initial values of yi one can describe the motions of dif ferent centers of mass of a spinning particle 21 among 4 the set of the pairs e and j there is the single pair corre sponding to the proper center of mass it is known that in minkowski s spacetime the exact mp equations at con dition 3 have in addition to usual solutions describing the straight worldlines a set of solutions describing os cillatory helical worldlines 47 48 this situation was interpreted in 49 where it was pointed out that in rel ativity the position of the center of mass of a rotating body depends on the frame of reference and condition 3 is common for the so called proper and nonproper centers of mass 50 more detailed analysis can be found in 42 51 concerning the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle with r 3 m in notations 9 it means y 1 3 we note that according to 11 and 12 the value of y 7 on this orbit is y 7 3 3 4 0 1 o 0 20 then by expressions 14 and 15 in the main approxi mation we have e 3 1 4 0 j 3 5 4 0 21 let us consider the highly relativistic noncircular mo tions of a spinning particle which starts from y 1 3 with the initial values of y 5 6 0 and with y 7 which dif fers from 20 for this purpose we integrate equations 16 18 the values of e and j which correspond to the motions of the proper center of mass can be found using search computer as typical in fig 3 we show the results concerning the shape of the spinning parti cle trajectories at 0 10 2 with the fixed initial values y 1 0 3 y 5 0 2 5 10 2 and different values of y 7 the solid line corresponds to y 7 0 4 39 this value is determined by 20 with 0 10 2 the dashed line long dash line and dash dotted lines describe the cases when y 7 0 is equal approximately to 4 39 mul tiplied by 2 4 and 6 correspondingly in all cases the particle starts clockwise from the position r 3 m and 0 in the polar coordinates according to the solid line the spinning particle with the corresponding initial values of y 7 falls on schwarzschild s horizon surface as well as the spinless particle which begins to move with the same initial conditions for comparison the dot line in fig 3 illustrates the trajectory of this spinless par ticle the three other curves dashed long dash and dash dotted lines show that the spinning particle with the corresponding initial values of y 7 goes away from the schwarzschild source whereas it is known that by the properties of the geodesic lines in schwarzschild s metric the spinless particle in all these cases falls on the hori zon surface similarly as the dot line in fig 3 so fig 3 illustrates how the spin gravity action on the trajectory of the spinning particle increases with its orbital velocity y 7 fig 3 noncircular trajectories of the spinning particle at different initial values of y 7 the circle y 1 2 corresponds to the horizon line note that the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background exist be yond the small neighborhood of the value y 1 3 as well for 2 y 1 3 then the necessary value of y 7 is deter mined by y 7 1 0 y 1 1 2 y 1 1 4 3 y 1 1 1 2 1 o 0 22 similarly to 20 expression 22 is proportional to 1 0 the expressions for e and j which correspond to 22 are e 0 y 1 1 2 y 1 1 4 3 y 1 1 3 2 1 3 y 1 3 y 21 23 j 0 y 1 1 2 y 1 1 4 3 y 1 1 3 2 1 9 y 1 15 y 21 24 that is in contrast to 21 here both e and j are pro portional to 0 to describe noncircular highly relativistic orbits of a spinning particle which starts with 2 y 1 0 3 one can use search computer of such values e and j which pick out the corresponding motions of the particle s proper center of mass similarly as it was pointed out above for 5 the motion with y 1 0 3 naturally if some noncircular orbits are closer in a certain sense to the circular orbits with 22 the corresponding values e and j are close to 23 and 24 in general it is useful to have some analytical estimations for the necessary e and j in any concrete case of the spinning particle motion iv on the values of e and j for the proper center of mass the procedure of finding the e and j for the proper center of mass of a spinning particle moving in schwarzschild s background which is based on the consid eration of the mp equations in the linear approximation by the small displacement of the values y 1 y 5 y 7 from their initial values y 1 0 y 5 0 y 7 0 is presented in 46 it is important in this approach that e and j are the constant of motion that is their values are the same for the all time of the particle s motion in notations 1 y 5 y 5

29 where n y 25 1 2 y 11 1 y 2 1 y 2 7 1 2 for brevity we omit 0 near the initial values of yi in 29 and in the following 6 according to the known result of the differential equa tions theory the general solution of linear equations 26 28 is determined by the combination of e ix i 1 2 3 where i are the solutions of the third order algebraic equation 3 c 2 2 c 1 c 0 0 30 here the coefficients cj j 0 1 2 can be expressed through a b c and depend both on y 1 0 y 5 0 y 7 0 0 and on the parameters e and j for example the corre sponding expressions for c 2 and c 1 are c 2 a 10 b 20 j 10 a 11 b

31 and 32 for the concrete cases of the particle s highly relativistic noncircular motions when its 4 velocity is determined by the relationships y 5 p 0 y 7 k 0 33 where the parameters p and k satisfy the conditions p 2 0 1 and k 2 0 1 that is similarly to the case of the circular orbits with 22 according to 33 the particles 4 velocity is proportional to 1 0 our task is to find such values e and j which at the fixed initial values y 1 y 5 and y 7 determine just the motion of the proper center of mass using some analogy with the highly relativistic circular orbits when the necessary val ues e and j are determined by 23 and 24 here we search for the corresponding values in the form e k 1 0 j k 2 0 34 where k 1 and k 2 are some parameters which we have to find for this purpose we take into account the known expressions for the roots of the third order algebraic eq 30 through the values c 2 c 1 and c 0 it follows from these expressions that the values of the three roots 1 2 and 3 significantly depend on 0 in general the ex pressions for these roots contain the large terms which are proportional to 1 0 just these terms determine the high frequency oscillatory solutions as well as the solu tions which are proportional to the exponent with the large absolute values of the real index of this exponent such all solutions do not describe the motions of the par ticle s proper center of mass in which we are interested therefore to choice the necessary solutions we take into account the partial solutions of eqs 26 28 for which the corresponding expressions of 1 2 and 3 do not contain the large terms of the order 1 0 it is not dif ficult to check that the possible approximated approach consists in putting zero the coefficients near the terms with 1 0 in the expressions for c 2 and c 1 then we obtain the two linear algebraic equations for k 1 and k 2 which determine the necessary values of these parame ters k 1 k 2 n y 21 k p 2 2 y 21 k 3 k 2 y 1 y 1 3 y 1 2 2 y 1 n

relationships 34 36 in eqs 16 18 for the concrete motions of a highly relativistic spinning particle with the initial value y 1 0 2 5 figure 4 shows a case when y 5 0 3 6 y 7 0 9 2 and 0 10 2 the dot lines in fig 4 correspond to the motion of a spinless particle with the same initial values y 1 0 y 5 0 and y 7 0 because expressions 35 and 36 can be used only for some approximated description of motions of the particle s proper center of mass the graphs in fig 4 have the oscillatory features it means that the proper center of mass is moving according to the corresponding middle lines of the graphs in fig 4 note that both graphs in fig 3 and fig 4 correspond to the spinning particle motions under the strong repul sive action of the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling v conclusions there are significant differences in the spin gravity coupling for a spinning test particle in schwarzschild s background when its velocity 1 is not very high and 2 is very close to the speed of light i e when the cor responding relativistic lorentz factor is of the order 1 or much greater than 1 just in the second case it follows from the mp equations that general relativity is both the 7 fig 4 an example of the oscillatory motions in the polar coordinates and in the dependence r vs t theory of gravity as a generalization of the newtonian de scription of gravity and in the certain sense predicts the effects of strong antigravity in some extremal situations which is impossible in the newtonian theory in this pa per we have considered the examples of the highly rela tivistic motions of a spinning particle which are caused by the strong repulsive action of the spin gravity coupling in schwarzschild s background this action is shown in the form of the spinning particle trajectories as compared to the corresponding geodesic trajectories of a spinless particle secs iii and iv the effects of the significant influence of the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling on the spinning particle energy and angular momentum are presented in sec 2 for further investigations of the concrete types of the highly relativistic motions of a spin ning particle in schwarzschild s background according to the exact mp equations one can use the approach which is described in sec iv the question arises concerning possibilities of the ex perimental registration of the strong spin gravity effects naturally the situation with a macroscopic spinning par ticle body moving relative to schwarzschild s mass with 1 is not realistic quite the reverse the elementary particles which are the active participants of the high en ergy astrophysical processes have the very large factor which values of are necessary for the manifestations of the effects of the highly relativistic spin gravity cou pling that are considered in this paper note that the main large term which determines these values is equal to 1 0 in the case when m is equal to 10 6 of the sun s mass for an electron and a neutrino with the mass 0 3 ev we have that 1 0 is equal to 9 1010 and 7 107 respectively these values are very high and the parts of electrons and neutrinos with the corresponding values of the factor near the black holes are low nev ertheless one cannot exclude that for example the data concerning very high energy neutrinos from the ice cube experiment will be useful in the context of the possible registrations of the strong spin gravity coupling effects 1 c w misner k s thorne and j a wheeler gravi tation freeman san francisco 1973 2 s chandrasekhar the mathematical theory of black holes
