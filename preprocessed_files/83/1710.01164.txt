cosmological constant claus gerhardt abstract we apply quantum statistics to our quantized versions of schwarzschild ads and kerr ads black holes and also to the quantized globally hyperbolic spacetimes having an asymptotically euclidean cauchy hypersurface by first proving for the temporal hamiltonian h 0 that e h 0 0 is of trace class and then that this result is also valid for the spatial hamiltonian h 1 which has the same eigenval ues but with larger multiplicities since the lowest eigenvalue is strictly positive the extension of e h 1 to the corresponding symmetric fock space is also of trace class and we are thus able to define a partition function z the operator density the entropy s and the average energy e we prove that s and e tend to infinity if the cosmologi cal constant tends to 0 and vanish if tends to infinity we also conjecture that e is the source of the dark matter and that the dark energy density is a multiple of the eigenvalue of with respect to the vacuum vector which is z 1 contents 1 introduction 2 2 trace class estimates 6 3 the partition function 19 4 the friedmann universes with negative cosmological constants 26 references 28 date november

three recent papers we applied our model of quantum gravity to a globally hyperbolic spacetime with an asymptotically euclidean cauchy hy persurface 5 and to a schwarzschild ads 4 resp kerr ads black hole 6 in all three cases the quantized model had the same structure namely it consisted of special solutions to a wave equation 1 1 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 1 t 2 4 n u n 2 t 2 4 nru nt 2 u 0 in a quantum spacetime 1 2 n r s 0 where s 0 is a n dimensional n 3 cauchy hypersurface of the original spacetime the laplacian and the scalar curvature correspond to the metric ij in s 0 cf 3 theorem 6 9 where we derived this wave equation after a canonical quantization process the special solutions are a sequence of smooth functions which are a product of temporal and spatial eigenfunctions where the spatial eigenfunctions are eigendistributions in case of the globally hyperbolic spacetime with an asymptotically eu clidean cauchy hypersurface the solutions to the wave equation can be ex pressed in the form 1 3 uij wivij i n 1 j m where the wi are the eigenfunctions of a temporal hamilton operator h 0 1 4 h 0 wi iwi and the i have multiplicity one such that 1 5 0 0 1 and for each fixed i the at most countably many vij generate an eigenspace 1 6 e i s s 0 of a spatial hamiltonian h 1 i e 1 7 h 1 vij ivij we have 1 8 vij c s 0 s s 0 in the two remaining cases of the black holes the special solutions are labelled by three indices 1 9 uijk wi ijk j where the wi are the same temporal eigenfunctions as before the j are the eigenfunctions of an elliptic operator a on a smooth compact riemannian manifold m ij where topologically 1 10 m sn 1 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 3 at least the physically interesting cases i e 1 11 a j j j 1 12 0 1 2 the j form a mutually orthogonal basis of l 2 m for a schwarzschild ads black hole we know that 1 13 0 0 and for a kerr ads black hole this condition can be assured by assuming that the rotational parameter a is small enough such that the scalar curvature of ij is positive let us emphasize that we considered in 6 kerr ads black holes of odd dimensions 1 14 dimn 2 m 1 m 2 and assumed that all rotational parameters ai are equal 1 15 ai a 6 0 1 i m the ijk are eigendistributions in s r satisfying 1 16 ijk 2 ij ijk k 1 2 where 1 17 ij 1 1 2 ei ij and 1 18 ij 2 1 2 e i ij where 1 19 ij 0 is defined by the relation 1 20 i j 2 ij i e for any i n we look for all j satisfying 1 21 j i and then choose ij 0 satisfying 1 20 let ni be the set of integers such that the j satisfy 1 21 then the smooth functions 1 22 ijk j are mutually orthogonal in l 2 m ij for fixed i and k note that we only have two different eigendistributions ijk if 1 23 ij 0 otherwise we have only one the eigendistributions ij 1 and ij 2 are also considered to be orthogonal since their fourier transforms 1 24 ijk ij 4 claus gerhardt have disjoint supports finally the smooth functions uijk in 1 9 can be considered to be mutually orthogonal since uijk and ui j k are mutually orthogonal in 1 25 l 2 r d l 2 m where 1 26 d t 2 4 n dt if 1 27 ij i j k k and as tempered distributions otherwise the uijk are eigendistributions for both the temporal hamiltonian h 0 as well as for the spatial hamiltonian h 1 with the same eigenvalues i where now the eigenvalues have finite multiplicities different from 1 by definition of the eigendistributions and the uijk also solve the wave equation since the wave equation can be expressed as 1 28 0 h 0 u h 1 u 0 where u u t x is a smooth function 1 29 x s 0 r m and 1 30 0 t t 2 4 n in section 3 we shall prove that we can define an abstract hilbert space h where the eigendistributions uijk resp uij in 1 3 form a basis of mutually orthogonal unit vectors such that the hamiltonian h 1 can be defined on the dense subspace which is the algebraic span of the basis vectors as an essentially self adjoint operator let h 1 be its unique self adjoint extension namely its closure then we shall prove that for any 0 1 31 e h 1 is of trace class in h in addition h 1 satisfies 1 32 h 1 0 i 0 0 let 1 33 h d h 1 be the canonical extension of h 1 to the symmetric fock space 1 34 f f h then 1 35 e h a partition function for quantized spacetimes 5 is of trace class in f because of 1 31 and 1 32 cf 1 prop 5 2 27 hence we can define the partition function 1 36 z tr e h the density operator 1 37 z 1 e h and the von neumann entropy 1 38 s tr log logz e where e is the average energy and 0 the inverse temperature 1 39 t 1 here is a summary of the results derived in section 3 1 1 theorem i let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 1 40 0 0 we have 1 41 lim 0 e as well as 1 42 lim 0 s where the limites are uniform in ii let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 1 43 0 we have 1 44 lim e 0 as well as 1 45 lim 0 s 0 where the limites are uniform in the behaviour of z with respect to is described in the theorem 1 2 theorem let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 1 46 0 0 we have 1 47 lim 0 z and for any 1 48 0 6 claus gerhardt the relation 1 49 lim z 1 is valid the convergence in both limites is uniform in 1 3 remark the first part of theorem 1 1 reveals that the energy be comes very large for small values of since this is the energy obtained by applying quantum statistics to the quantized version of a black hole or of a globally hyperbolic spacetime assuming its cauchy hypersurfaces are asymptotically euclidean a small negative cosmological constant might be responsible for the dark matter where we equate the energy of the quantized universe with matter as source for the dark energy density we consider the eigenvalue of the density operator with respect to the vacuum vector 1 50 z 1 i e the dark energy density should be proportional to z 1 1 4 remark let us also mention that we use planck units in this paper i e 1 51 c g kb 1 in section 4 we also applied quantum statistics to the quantized version of friedmann universe and proved 1 5 theorem the results in theorem 3 4 remark 3 5 and theorem 3 4 are also valid if the quantized spacetime n nn 1 n 3 is a friedmann universe without matter but with a negative cosmological constant and with vanishing spatial curvature the eigenvalues of the spatial hamiltonian h 1 all have multiplicity one 2 trace class estimates we want to apply quantum statistics to the system described by the wave equation and its special solutions therefore we need a separable hilbert space h and a hamiltonian h such that 2 1 h 0 0 and 2 2 e h 0 is of trace class in h a natural candidate is the temporal hamiltonian h 0 mentioned in the introduction which corresponds to a generalized eigenvalue problem that has been considered in 5 section 4 define the bilinear forms 2 3 b w w r 1 32 n 2 n 1 w w n t 2 w w a partition function for quantized spacetimes 7 and 2 4 k w w r t 2 4 n w w in the sobolev space h 1 which is the completion of 2 5 c c r c in the norm defined by the first bilinear form we then look at the generalized eigenvalue problem 2 6 b w k w h 1 the following theorem was proved in the former paper 2 1 theorem the eigenvalue problem 2 6 has countably many solu tions wi i such that 2 7 0 0 1 2 2 8 lim i and 2 9 k wi wj ij the wi are complete in h 1 as well as in l 2 r the eigenfunctions wi solve the ordinary differential equation 2 10 awi 1 32 n 2 n 1 w i n t 2 wi it 2 4 nwi let 0 0 t be defined by 2 11 0 t t 2 4 n then the operator 2 12 a 10 a is symmetric in 2 13 h l 2 r d d 0 dt and the wi are eigenfunctions of a 2 14 a wi iwi the equation 2 10 is equivalent to 2 15 0 a wi i 0 wi and a with domain 2 16 d a wi i n h is essentially self adjoint as will be proved later lemma 3 1 on page 19 in a more general setting we denote its unique self adjoint extension by h 0 8 claus gerhardt we shall now prove that 2 17 e h 0 0 is of trace class in h first we need two lemmata 2 2 lemma the embedding 2 18 j h 1 h 0 l 2 r d where 2 19 d 1 t 2 2 dt is hilbert schmidt proof maurin was the first to prove that the embedding 2 20 hm 2 l 2 where 2 21 rn is a bounded domain is hilbert schmidt provided 2 22 m n 2 cf 8 theorem 1 p 336 we adapt his proof to the present situation let w h 1 then assuming w is real valued 2 23 w t 2 2 t 0 w w 2 o w 2 1 2 0 w 2 c w 21 for all t 0 where 1 is the norm in h 1 to derive the last inequality in 2 23 we used 2 24 1 0 w 2 2 1 0 w 2 1 2 1 0 w 2 which is easily be deduced from the equation in 2 23 the estimate 2 25 w t c 0 w 1 t 0 is of course also valid for complex valued functions from which infer that for any t 0 the linear form 2 26 w w t w h 1 is continuous hence it can be expressed as 2 27 w t t w where 2 28 t h 1 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 9 and 2 29 t 1 c 0 now let 2 30 ei h 1 be an onb then 2 31 i 0 ei t 2 i 0 t ei 2 t 21 c 20 integrating this inequality over r with respect to d we infer 2 32 i 0 0 ei t 2 d c 20 completing the proof of the lemma 2 3 lemma let wi be the eigenfunctions of h 0 then there exist positive constants c and p such that 2 33 wi 1 c i p wi 0 i n where 0 is the norm in h 0 proof we have 2 34 wi 21 i 0 t 2 4 n wi 2 let 0 be arbitrary and define 2 35 q 2 2 2 n n n 1 and the conjugate exponent 2 36 q q q 1 n then the integral on the right hand side of 2 34 can be estimated from above by 2 37 1 q q 0 t 2 4 n 1 t 2 n q wi 2 1 q q 0 1 t 2 n q wi 2 we note that by definition 2 38 t 2 4 n 1 t 2 n q 1 t 2 and that in view of 2 24 2 39 0 1 t 2 wi 2 c wi 21 10 claus gerhardt combining 2 34 2 37 and 2 39 we then infer 2 40 wi 21 c 1 q q i wi 21 c 1 q q i wi 20 and deduce further by choosing appropriately that the result is valid with a different constant c we are now ready to prove 2 4 theorem let 0 then the operator 2 41 e h 0 is of trace class in h i e 2 42 tr e h 0 i 0 e i c proof in view of lemma 2 2 the embedding 2 43 j h 1 h 0 is hilbert schmidt let 2 44 wi h be an onb of eigenfunctions then 2 45 e i e i wi 2 e i 1 i wi 2 1 e i 1 i c i 2 p wi 20 in view of 2 33 but 2 46 wi 20 wi 21 w i 20 i w i 20 where 2 47 w i wi wi 11 is an onb in h 1 yielding 2 48 i 0 e i c i 0 w i 20 since j is hilbert schmidt there is also a spatial hamiltonianh 1 which in the case of the black holes considered is a direct product of a classical harmonic oscillator in r and an elliptic operator a on a compact smooth riemannian manifold m mn 1 n 3 with metric ij where a has the form 2 49 a n 1 n 2 r and the laplacian is the laplacian in m and r the scalar curvature of the metric a is self adjoint with domain 2 50 d a h 2 2 m l 2 m a partition function for quantized spacetimes 11 where 2 51 hm 2 m m m are the usual sobolev spaces with norm 2 52 2 m 2 m m d 2 a has a pure point spectrum with countable many eigenvalues j with finite multiplicities and mutually orthogonal eigenfunctions j such that 2 53 0 1 and 2 54 lim j j we want to prove that 2 55 e a 0 is of trace class in l 2 m the proof of this result will follow the previous arguments very closely 2 5 lemma let m n 1 2 then the embedding 2 56 j hm 2 m l 2 m is hilbert schmidt proof this result is due to maurin and its proof is identical with the proof of lemma 2 2 apart from some obvious modifications we also need the lemma 2 6 lemma let m n then there exists cm 0 such that 2 57 22 m 2 cm am 2 2 and the bilinear form 2 58 am am 0 0 defines an equivalent scalar product in h 2 m 2 m where 2 59 0 m proof let 2 60 f hm 2 m and 2 61 h 2 2 m a solution of 2 62 a f 12 claus gerhardt then it is well known that 2 63 hm 2 2 m and there exists c m such that 2 64 m 2 2 c m f m 2 0 the constant c m also depends on a and m using this estimate the relation 2 57 can be easily proved by induction now we are ready to prove 2 7 theorem let a be the self adjoint operator in 2 49 then 2 65 e a is of trace class in l 2 m for any 0 proof let m n 1 4 and equip h 2 m 2 m with the scalar product 2 58 such that 2 66 22 m 2 am am 0 0 then any eigenfunctions i j of a satisfy 2 67 i j 0 0 i j 2 m 2 0 let j be an onb of eigenfunctions of a in l 2 m and define 2 68 j i j 12 m 2 then the j form an onb in h 2 m 2 m and we conclude 2 69 e j e j j 20 e j j 22 m 2 j 20 e j 1 j 2 m j 20 c j 20 yielding 2 70 j 0 e j c j 0 j 20 in view of lemma 2 5 with the help of the preceding lemma we can now prove that in case of the black holes the spatial hamiltonian h 1 has the property that 2 71 e h 1 is of trace class for all 0 where we still have to define an appropriate hilbert space we have 2 72 h 1 v v av where we write v as product 2 73 v x x a partition function for quantized spacetimes 13 with 2 74 r x m mn 1 where a is the differential operator in 2 49 let j be the eigenfunctions of a with eigenvalues j then for any eigenvalue i we define 2 75 ni j n j i and ij 0 such that 2 76 2 ij j i note that 2 77 0 ni i n since 2 78 0 0 let 2 79 ijk k 1 2 be the tempered distributions 2 80 ij 1 1 2 ei ij and 2 81 ij 2 1 2 e i ij where this distinction only occurs for 2 82 ij 0 let ijk be the fourier transform of ijk then 2 83 ij 1 ij ij 2 ij such that these tempered distributions are considered to be mutually or thogonal the smooth functions 2 84 uijk ijk j satisfy 2 85 h 1 uijk iuijk label the eigenvalues of h 1 including their multiplicities and denote them by i then 2 86 i 0 e i 2 i 0 e in i 2 i 0 e 2 ie 2 in i where 2 87 n i ni 14 claus gerhardt 2 8 lemma let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 2 88 0 0 and for any i n the estimate 2 89 e 2 in i c c 0 where c 0 also depends on a but is independent of i n proof each ni is the disjoint union 2 90 n i n i where 2 91 n i j ni j 0 and n i is its complement the operator a has only finitely many eigenvalues which are non positive i e 2 92 n i n 0 i n hence 2 93 e 2 ini i n 0 j n i e 2 i n 0 j n i e 2 j n 0 j n 0 e 2 j n 0 j n 0 e 2 j 1 2 mj j 20 n 0 c j 0 j 20 where we used 2 69 the estimate for the hilbert schmidt norm of the embedding 2 94 j hm 2 m l 2 m depends on a since we used the equivalent norm given in 2 66 and 2 95 c sup t 0 e 2 t 1 t 2 m 2 9 corollary the sum on the left hand side of 2 86 is finite and hence 2 96 e h 1 0 is of trace class provided we can define a hilbert space h such that such that the eigendistributions form complete set of eigenvectors in h and h 1 is essentially self adjoint in h a partition function for quantized spacetimes 15 proof the first claim follows immediately by combining 2 93 and theo rem 2 4 in lemma 3 1 on page 19 we shall define the hilbert space h and shall prove that h 1 is essentially self adjoint in h and that the eigendistri butions form a complete set of eigenvectors in h the elliptic operator a also depend on since the underlying riemannian metric depends on it the estimates in the preceding lemma remain valid provided remains in a compact subset of r since the operator a is then still uniformly elliptic and smooth however when 2 97 then the relation 2 57 is no longer valid and a more sophisticated analysis is necessary to achieve a corresponding estimate let us treat the cases schwarzschild ads and kerr ads black holes separately for a schwarzschild ads black hole the operator a can be written in the form 2 98 a r 20 a where r 0 is the black hole radius and 2 99 a n 1 n 2 r here the laplacian and the scalar curvature r refer to the corresponding quantities of sn 1 with the standard metric cf 4 equ 2 12 and 2 14 the eigenfunctions of a are the eigenfunctions of a let j be the eigenvalues of a and j the eigenvalues of a then 2 100 j r 2 0 j from the definition of the black hole radius 2 101 mr n 2 0 1 2 n n 1 r 20 it is evident that 2 102 lim r 0 0 and also 2 103 lim r 20 though the latter result is only needed when we shall treat the kerr ads case we can now prove 2 10 lemma let 0 be arbitrary and 0 so large that 2 104 r 0 1 0 then for any i n any 0 and any 0 2 105 e 2 in i c c 0 16 claus gerhardt where c 0 also depends on a but is independent of and i n proof we follow the proof of lemma 2 8 but use a instead of a to define an equivalent norm in hm 2 m 2 106 m sn 1 then we infer cf 2 93 2 107 e 2 ini i n 0 j n i e 2 i n 0 j n i e 2 j n 0 j n 0 e 2 j n 0 j n 0 e 2 j 1 2 mj j 20 n 0 c j 0 j 20 here we used 2 108 j r 2 0 j j 0 let us now look at kerr ads black holes in 6 equ 2 50 we described the metric ij on m s n 1 2 109 ds 2 m r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 ijd id j 2 i ijd id j a 2 1 l 2 r 2 r 2 a 2 r 2 1 a 2 l 2 2 2 i 2 jd id j here 2 110 n 2 m m 2 and the coordinates i 1 i m are subject to the constraint 2 111 m i 1 2 i 1 they are the latitudinal coordinates of sn 1 and the i 1 i m are the azimuthal coordinates the metric 2 112 ijd id j 2 i ijd id j is the standard metric of sn 1 the constant r is the radius of the event horizon a 6 0 the rotational parameter and 2 113 l 2 1 m 2 m 1 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 17 the relation 2 114 a 2 l 2 1 is assumed we also require that a is small enough such that the scalar curvature r of the metric ij is positive we can write the metric as a conformal metric 2 115 ij r 2 a 2 1 a 2 l 2 ij we note that the schwarzschild ads black hole is obtained by setting a 0 and that 2 116 lim a 0 r r 0 the schwarzschild black hole radius in order to prove the analogue of lemma 2 10 we assume that when 2 117 a is supposed so small that 2 118 lim a 2 0 and 2 119 lim r 2 and we emphasize that these assumptions are always satisfied if a 0 cf 2 103 if these are satisfied then the operator a can be expressed in the form 2 120 a 1 a 2 l 2 r 2 a 2 a where a converges uniformly in c m to the operator a in 2 99 i e for large a is uniformly elliptic and smooth such that the number of non positive eigenvalues n 0 a is bounded from above by the n 0 of the limit operator 2 121 n 0 lim sup n 0 a since n 0 is upper semi continuous as it is well known 2 11 lemma under the assumptions 2 118 and 2 119 the results of lemma 2 10 are also valid for the kerr ads black hole i e there exists 0 0 such that for all 2 122 0 and for any satisfying 2 123 0 0 18 claus gerhardt where 0 is arbitrary 2 124 e 2 in i c 0 uniformly in i n and proof the proof is identical to the proof of lemma 2 10 by using the fact that the special hm 2 m norm 2 125 a m a m 0 0 with different m than used to express the dimension of m is uniformly equivalent to the standard hm 2 m norm hence the hilbert schmidt norm of the embedding 2 126 j hm 2 m l 2 m is uniformly bounded we also relied on 2 127 j 1 a 2 l 2 r 2 a 2 j j 0 for j n i finally let us derive the last result in this section 2 12 lemma let i be the temporal eigenvalues depending on and let i be the corresponding eigenvalues for 2 128 1 then 2 129 i i n 1 n proof let b and k be the bilinear forms defined in 2 3 resp 2 4 where b corresponds to the cosmological constant and let b 1 be the form with respect to the value 2 130 1 moreover let us denote the corresponding quadratic forms by the same sym bols then we have 2 131 b k n 1 n b 1 k 0 6 c c r to prove 2 131 we introduce a new integration variable on the left hand side 2 132 t 0 to conclude 2 133 b k 4 n 1 n b 1 k 0 6 c c r a partition function for quantized spacetimes 19 provided 2 134 14 the relation 2 131 immediately implies 2 129 3 the partition function we first define the partition function for the black holes and shall later show that the definitions and results are also applicable in case of the quan tized globally hyperbolic spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant and asymptotically euclidean cauchy hypersurfaces we define the partition function by using the spatial hamiltonian h 1 of the quantized black holes kerr or schwarzschild which is now defined in the separable hilbert space h generated by the eigendistributions 3 1 uijk wi ijk j which are smooth functions satisfying the eigenvalue equations 3 2 h 1 uijk iuijk as well as 3 3 h 0 uijk iuijk where h 0 is the temporal hamiltonian in order to explain how the eigendistributions can generate a hilbert space let us relabel the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues by ui i such that 3 4 h 1 ui iui and 3 5 h 0 ui iui i e the multiplicities of the eigenvalues are now included in the labelling and the ordering is no longer strict 3 6 0 1 2 to define the hilbert space h we simply declare that the eigendistributions are mutually orthogonal unit eigenvectors hence defining a scalar product in the complex vector space h spanned by these eigenvectors we define the hilbert space h to be its completion 3 1 lemma the linear operator h 1 with domain h is essentially self adjoint in h let h 1 be its closure then the only eigenvectors of h 1 are those of h 1 proof h 1 is obviously densely defined symmetric and bounded from below 3 7 h 1 0 i 0 since 0 0 the eigenvectors also span r h 1 i e r h 1 is dense let 3 8 w h 20 claus gerhardt be arbitrary and let 3 9 h 1 vi r h 1 be a sequence converging to w then vi is a cauchy sequence because 3 10 0 vi vj 2 h 1 vi h 1 vj vi vj h 1 vi h 1 vj vi vj hence 3 11 r h 1 h and h 1 is the unique s a extension of h 1 it remains to prove that h 1 has no additional eigenvectors thus let u be an eigenvector of h 1 with eigenvalue 3 12 h 1 u u and let 3 13 e i h i n be the eigenspaces of h 1 let us first assume that there exists j such that 3 14 j but 3 15 u e j without loss of generality we may assume 3 16 u e j however this leads to a contradiction since then 3 17 u e i i n and hence 3 18 u h which implies u 0 thus let us assume 3 19 6 i i n but then 3 17 is again valid leading to the known contradiction 3 2 remark in the following we shall write h 1 instead of h 1 3 3 lemma for any 0 the operator 3 20 e h 1 is of trace class in h let 3 21 f f h be the symmetric fock space generated by h and let 3 22 h d h 1 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 21 be the canonical extension of h 1 to f then 3 23 e h is also of trace class in f 3 24 tr e h i 0 1 e i 1 proof the first part of the lemma has already been proved in corollary 2 9 on page 14 this property can now be rephrased as 3 25 tr e h 1 i 0 e i the second assertion is well known since 3 26 h 1 0 i 0 and the properties 3 25 and 3 26 imply 3 24 cf 1 proposition 5 2 7 and 7 volume ii p 868 where the equation 3 24 is also proved we then define the partition function z by 3 27 z tr e h i 0 1 e i 1 and the density operator in f by 3 28 z 1 e h such that 3 29 tr 1 the von neumann entropy s is then defined by 3 30 s tr log logz z 1 tr he h logz logz logz e where e is the average energy 3 31 e tr h e can be expressed in the form 3 32 e i 0 i e i 1 here we also set the boltzmann constant 3 33 kb 1 22 claus gerhardt the parameter is supposed to be the inverse of the absolute temperature t 3 34 t 1 in view of lemma 2 12 on page 18 we can write the eigenvalues i in the form 3 35 i i n 1 n where i are the eigenvalues corresponding to 1 hence z s and e can also be looked at as functions depending on and or more conve niently on where 3 36 n 1 n since the i can also be expressed as 3 37 i j j n 1 n where j is different from i 3 38 j i because of the multiplicities of i let emphasize that the multiplicities also depend on hence it is best to simply note that 3 39 0 0 0 n 1 n and that the i are ordered we shall never use the relation 3 37 explicitly in the proofs of the subsequent theorems and lemmata referring to 3 35 instead 3 4 theorem i let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 3 40 0 0 we have 3 41 lim 0 e as well as 3 42 lim 0 s where the limites are uniform in ii let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 3 43 0 we have 3 44 lim e 0 as well as 3 45 lim 0 s 0 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 23 where the limites are uniform in proof i we first observe that 3 46 e i 0 i e i 1 i 0 i e i 1 now let m n be arbitrary then 3 47 e m i 0 i e i 1 m i 0 i e i 1 and 3 48 lim inf 0 e lim 0 m i 0 i e i 1 m 1 1 m 1 10 yielding 3 49 lim 0 e uniformly in since z 1 the relation 3 42 follows as well ii we estimate e from above by 3 50 e i 0 ie i 1 e i i 0 ie 2 ie 2 i 1 e i 1 1 e 0 0 1 c 0 i 0 e 2 i where we used 3 43 and 3 51 ie 2 i sup t 0 te 2 t c c 0 furthermore we know that 3 52 i 0 e 2 i c i 0 e 4 i c 0 i 0 e 0 4 i cf lemma 2 10 on page 15 and lemma 2 11 on page 17 hence we obtain 3 53 e 1 e 0 0 1 c 0 c 0 i 0 e 4 i 24 claus gerhardt deducing further 3 54 lim sup e c 0 c 0 lim i 0 e 4 i 0 uniformly in and hence 3 55 lim e 0 it remains to prove that s vanishes in the limit we have 3 56 z i 0 1 e i 1 i 0 1 e i 1 e i 1 exp 1 e 0 0 1 i 0 e i where we used the inequality 3 57 log 1 t t t 0 in the last step applying then the arguments preceding the inequality 3 54 we conclude 3 58 lim z 1 uniformly in 3 5 remark the first part of the preceding theorem reveals that the energy becomes very large for small values of since this is the energy ob tained by applying quantum statistics to the quantized version of a black hole or of a globally hyperbolic spacetime assuming its cauchy hypersurfaces are asymptotically euclidean a small negative cosmological constant might be responsible for the dark matter where we equate the energy of the quantized universe with matter as source for the dark energy density we conjecture that the dark energy density should be proportional to the eigenvalue of the density operator with respect to the vacuum vector 3 59 z 1 which is z 1 the behaviour of z with respect to is described in the theorem 3 6 theorem let 0 0 be arbitrary then for any 3 60 0 0 we have 3 61 lim 0 z and for any 3 62 0 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 25 the relation 3 63 lim z 1 is valid the convergence in both limites is uniform in proof 3 60 let m n be arbitrary then 3 64 z i 0 1 e i 1 i 0 1 e i 1 m i 0 1 e 0 i 1 and we infer 3 65 lim 0 z lim inf 0 z 3 63 this limit relation has already been proved in 3 58 let us now consider the quantized globally hyperbolic spacetimes with an asymptotically euclidean cauchy hypersurface the eigenspaces 3 66 e i s s 0 of h 1 are separable but they are in general not finite dimensional as can be seen by the following counterexample 3 67 h 1 in rn the eigenspaces 3 68 e i i 0 contain the tempered distributions 3 69 ei k x k sn 1 i as a hamel basis they generate a vector space the dimension of which is equal to the cardinality of sn 1 of course as a schauder basis the functions with 3 70 k d sn 1 i where d is countable and dense generate a dense subspace this example indicates that not all eigendistributions ofh 1 might be phys ically relevant contrary to the cases of the black holes where the selection of eigenvectors and eigendistributions was a natural process only the temporal eigenvectors are naturally selected in the present situation and of course at least one matching spatial eigendistribution to obtain a solution of the wave equation hence we could use h 0 to define the partition function however we believe this choice would be too restrictive and we shall instead stipulate that we only pick at most 3 71 c i p 26 claus gerhardt spatial eigendistributions in e i where c and p are arbitrary but fixed con stants i e we assume that 3 72 n i c i p i n with this assumption it becomes evident that the results and conjectures of theorem 3 4 remark 3 5 and theorem 3 6 are also valid in case of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with asymptotically euclidean hypersurfaces 4 the friedmann universes with negative cosmological constants in 3 remark 6 11 we observed that if the cauchy hypersurface s 0 is a space of constant curvature and if the wave equation 1 1 on page 2 is only considered for functions u which do not depend on x then this equation is identical to the equation obtained by quantizing the hamilton constraint in a friedman universe without matter but including a cosmological constant the equation is then the ode 4 1 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 2 rt 2 4 n u nt 2 u 0 0 t where r is the scalar curvature of s 0 we cannot apply our previous ar guments to the solutions of this ode however if we consider instead the more general equation 1 1 where u is also allowed to depend on x which certainly is more general and accurate then the previous arguments can be applied if the curvature of s 0 vanishes 4 2 0 the scalar curvature which is equal to 4 3 r n n 1 then vanishes too and 4 4 s 0 rn we are now in the situation which we analyzed at the end of the previous section where now the spatial hamiltonian is 4 5 h 1 n 2 and some spatial eigendistributions are shown in 3 69 on page 25 however since we consider the quantized version of a friedmann universe we shall look for radially symmetric eigendistributions i e we look for smooth functions v v x satisfying 4 6 v x r such that 4 7 v n 1 r 1 2 in r 0 a partition function for quantized spacetimes 27 where 0 obviously it is sufficient to assume 1 because if is an eigenfunction for 1 then 4 8 r r is an eigenfunction for the eigenvalue 2 therefore let us choose 1 we shall express the solution with help of a bessel function j let be a solution of the bessel equation 4 9 r 1 1 r 2 2 0 where 4 10 n 2 2 then the function 4 11 r r satisfies 4 12 r 2 1 r 0 which is equivalent to 4 7 with 1 the bessel equation 4 9 has the two independent solutions j and y the bessel functions of first kind resp of second kind it is well known that the functions 4 13 r j can be expressed as a power series in the variable r 2 cf 2 equ 21 p 420 i e the function 4 14 v x r r j is smooth in rn while the functions 4 15 r y have a singularity in r 0 hence there exists exactly one smooth radially symmetric solution v of the eigenvalue equation 4 16 v 2 v 0 which is given by 4 17 v r j r this solution also vanishes at infinity hence it is uniformly bounded and a tempered distribution a solution of the wave equation 1 1 on page 2 in case of a quantized friedmann universe is therefore given by a sequence 4 18 ui wi t vi x i n where wi is a temporal eigenfunction and vi a spatial eigenfunction the ui are also eigenfunctions for the temporal hamiltonian as well as for the spatial hamiltonian each eigenvalue has multiplicity one we have therefore proved 28 claus gerhardt 4 1 theorem the results in theorem 3 4 remark 3 5 and theorem 3 4 are also valid if the quantized spacetime n nn 1 n 3 is a friedmann universe without matter but with a negative cosmological constant and with vanishing spatial curvature the eigenvalues of the spatial hamiltonian h 1 all have multiplicity one references 1 ola bratteli and derek w robinson operator algebras and quantum
