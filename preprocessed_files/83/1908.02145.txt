open problems in physics the einstein equations are the euler lagrange equations of the einstein hilbert functional and quantization of a lagrangian theory requires to switch from a lagrangian view to a hamiltonian view in a ground break ing paper arnowitt deser and misner 3 expressed the einstein hilbert lagrangian in a form which allowed to derive a corresponding hamilton func tion by applying the legendre transformation however since the einstein hilbert lagrangian is singular the hamiltonian description of gravity is only correct if two additional constraints are satisfied namely the hamilton con straint and the diffeomorphism constraint dirac 7 proved how to quantize a constrained hamiltonian system at least in principle and his method has been applied to the hamiltonian setting of gravity cf the paper by dewitt 6 and the monographs by kiefer 16 and thiemann 18 in the general date august 7 2019 2000 mathematics subject classification 83 83 c 83 c 45 key words and phrases

claus gerhardt case when arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetime metrics are allowed the problem turned out to be extremely difficult and solutions could only be found by assuming a high degree of symmetry cf e g 8 however in the papers 9 10 we developed a model for the quantization of gravity for general hyperbolic spacetimes in these papers we eliminated the diffeomorphism constraint by reducing the number of variables and proving that the euler lagrange equations for this special class of metrics were still the full einstein equations the hamiltonian description of the einstein hilbert functional then allowed a canonical quantization we quantized the action by looking at the wheeler dewitt equation in a fiber bundle e where the base space is a cauchy hypersurface of the spacetime which has been quantized and the elements of the fibers are rie mannian metrics the fibers of e are equipped with a lorentzian metric such that they are globally hyperbolic and the transformed hamiltonian which is now a hyperbolic operator h is a normally hyperbolic operator acting only in the fibers the wheeler dewitt equation has the form h u 0 with u c e c and we defined with the help of the green s operator a symplectic vector space and a corresponding weyl system the wheeler dewitt equation seems to be the obvious quantization of the hamilton condition however h acts only in the fibers and not in the base space which is due to the fact that the derivatives are only ordinary covariant derivatives and not functional derivatives though they are supposed to be functional derivatives but this property is not really invoked when a functional derivative is applied to u since the result is the same as applying a partial derivative therefore we discarded the wheeler dewitt equation in the paper 14 and also in the monograph 15 and expressed the hamilton condition dif ferently by looking at the evolution equation of the mean curvature of the foliation hypersurfaces m t and implementing the hamilton condition on the right hand side of this evolution equation the left hand side a time de rivative we replaced by the corresponding poisson brackets after canonical quantization the modified evolution equation was transformed to an equation satisfied by operators which acted on functions u c e c since the poisson brackets became a commutator we could now employ the fact that the derivatives are functional derivatives since we had to differen tiate the scalar curvature of a metric when we applied the operator equation to a smooth function and tried to simplify the resulting equation as a result of the simplification of the commutator action we obtained an elliptic differ ential operator in the base space the main part of which was the laplacian with respect to a fiber element here we considered functions u depending on the variables x gij where x is a point in the base space s 0 x s 0 and gij is an element of the fibers the fiber metrics have the form 1 1 gij t 4 n ij applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 3 where 0 t is a time like fiber variable which is referred to as time n 3 is the dimension of s 0 and ij is a riemannian metric depending only on x subject to the requirement 1 2 det ij det ij cf 15 equs 1 4 103 1 4 104 p 29 and also 15 remark 1 6 8 the arbitrary but fixed metric ij in s 0 had been introduced to transform the densities det gij to functions on the right hand side of the evolution equation the interesting term was h 2 the square of the mean curvature it transformed to a second time derivative the only remaining derivative with respect to a fiber variable since the differentiations with respect to the other variables canceled each other the resulting quantized equation is then a wave equation in a globally hyperbolic spacetime 1 3 q 0 s 0 of the form 1 4 1 32 n 2 n 1 u n 1 t 2 4 n u n 2 t 2 4 nru nt 2 u 0 where s 0 is a cauchy hypersurface of the original spacetime and the laplacian and the scalar curvature r are formed with respect to a metric ij satisfying 1 2 and is a cosmological constant the function u depends on x t ij since the metric ij is also a fiber metric we may choose ij ij and because it is also arbitrary we may set ij to be the original metric of the cauchy hypersurface s 0 cf 15 remark 1 6 8 on page 49 the function u then only depends on t x u u t x for a detailed derivation of equation 1 4 we refer to 15 chapter 1 6 or 14 section 6 when s 0 is a space of constant curvature then the wave equation consid ered only for functions u which do not depend on x is identical to the equa tion obtained by quantizing the hamilton constraint in a friedmann universe without matter but including a cosmological constant cf 15 remark 1 6 11 on page 50 or 14 remark 6 11 there exist temporal and spatial self adjoint operators h 0 resp h 1 such that the hyperbolic equation is equivalent to 1 5 h 0 u h 1 u 0 where u u t x the operator h 0 is defined by 1 6 h 0 w 1 0 1 32 n 2 n 1 w nt 2 w where w w t w c c r c and 0 t 2 4 n while the definition of h 1 is given by 1 7 h 1 v n 1 v n 2 rv 4 claus gerhardt where v v x v c c s 0 c more precisely the operators hi i 0 1 are the corresponding unique self adjoint extensions of the operators defined above in the appropriate function spaces assuming 0 we proved that h 0 has a pure point spectrum with positive eigenvalues i cf 15 chapter 6 2 especially 15 theorem 6 2 5 on page 144 while forh 1 it is possible to find corresponding eigendistributions for each of the eigenvalues i if s 0 is asymptotically euclidean or if the quantized spacetime is a black hole with a negative cosmological constant cf 12 11 13 or 15 chapters 3 5 and also if s 0 is the hyperbolic space s 0 h n n 3 cf section 6 on page 16 let wi i n be an orthonormal basis for the temporal eigenvalue prob lems 1 8 h 0 wi iwi and vi be corresponding smooth eigendistributions for the spatial eigenvalue problems 1 9 h 1 vi ivi then 1 10 ui wivi are special solutions of the wave equation 1 4 the temporal eigenvalues i all have multiplicity 1 the spatial eigenval ues are the same eigenvalues but they may have higher multiplicities in case of black holes this is caused by very compelling intrinsic mathematical reasons cf 15 chapter 6 4 but unless there are either convincing intrin sic or extrinsic reasons like data we choose the spatial eigenspaces to be one dimensional because the spatial eigenvalues belong in general to the continuous spectrum of the spatial hamiltonian h 1 if s 0 is the cauchy hy persurface of a friedmann universe we only considered smooth spherically symmetric spatial eigenfunctions which also leads to one dimensional spa tial eigenspaces cf 15 chapter 6 6 for the euclidean case and section 6 on page 16 for the hyperbolic case one can then define an abstract hilbert space h spanned by the ui and a self adjoint operator h unitarily equivalent to h 0 such that 1 11 hui iui e h is then of trace class in h for all 0 and the canonical extension of h to the corresponding symmetric fock space f which is still called h shares this property hence we can define the partition function z 1 12 z tr e h the operator density 1 13 z 1 e h 0 applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 5 the average energy and the von neumann entropy in f the eigenvectors ui can also be viewed as to be elements of f and they are then also eigenvectors of in the present paper we want to apply these quantum gravitational results to cosmology by looking at a friedmann universe 1 14 n i s 0 where s 0 is a n dimensional simply connected space of constant curvature 1 15 0 1 i e s 0 is either r n or the hyperbolic space hn n 3 we tried to an swer some questions related to dark energy dark matter inflation and the missing antimatter in doing so we shall also show that assuming a negative cosmological constant is not a contradiction to the observational result of an expanding universe usually a positive cosmological constant is supposed to be responsible for the dark energy and dark matter is sometimes explained by assuming so called extended theories of gravity confer e g the papers 5 and 4 in this paper we rely on general relativity combined with some quantum gravitational ingredients let us summarize the main result as a theorem where dm resp de refer to the dark matter resp dark energy densities which we defined as eigenvalues of the operator density in f and 3 is a conventional density z is the partition function t 0 the absolute temperature and 0 0 the smallest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian h theorem 1 1 let the cosmological constant 1 16 1 0 be given and consider the perfect fluid defined by the density 1 17 dm de 3 satisfying the assumptions 4 23 4 24 4 36 and 4 37 moreover we suppose that t 1 and the scale factor a are functions depending on t the initial value problems 1 18 a a 2 n n 1 n 2 np 2 n n 1 and 1 19 n dm dm de a 1 a with initial values 0 a 0 a 0 are then solvable in i t 0 provided 0 0 is so large that 2 12 on page 7 as well as 1 20 2 2 n n 1 z 1 1 1 2 n 2 0 e 0 2 n n 1 0 6 claus gerhardt are valid at 0 and a 0 0 has to be chosen such that after adding 1 21 2 n n 1 n 1 3 2 3 a n 1 3 0 to the left hand side of 1 20 the inequality still remains valid at 0 the initial value a 0 is supposed to be positive the solution a then satisfies 1 22 0 1 23 a 0 1 24 a 0 and 1 25 2 n n 1 2 2 n n 1 a 2 0 in order that a also satisfies the first friedmann equation a 0 has to be chosen appropriately namely such that the first friedmann equation is valid for t t 0 which is possible in view of 1 25 remark 1 2 let us also mention that we use modified planck units in this paper i e 1 26 c 2 kb 1 where 2 is the coupling constant connecting the einstein tensor with the stress energy tensor 1 27 g g 2 t 2 the dark energy density in 15 remark 6 5 5 we proposed to use the eigenvalue of the density operator with respect to the vacuum vector which is z 1 2 1 z 1 as the source of dark energy density and though this eigenvalue is the vac uum or zero point energy and many authors have proposed the vacuum energy to be responsible for the dark energy these proposals all assumed the cosmological constant to be positive while we assume 0 because of the spectral resolution of the wave equation otherwise the temporal hamiltonian does not have a pure point spectrum however if 0 then we have to assure that z 1 dominates which will only be the case if 2 2 t t 0 t 0 note that z depends on the eigenvalues i and on 2 3 t 1 first we emphasize that we shall treat 2 4 de z 1 applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 7 as a constant i e we shall define the perfect fluid stress energy tensor by 2 5 t deg let i 0 i n be the eigenvalues of the temporal hamiltonian h 0 for a given 0 and let i be the eigenvalues for 2 6 1 then 2 7 i i n 1 n cf 15 lemma 6 4 9 p 172 and define the parameter by 2 8 n 1 n where we now assume 2 9 1 throughout the rest of the paper we proved in 15 theorem 6 5 6 p 180 that 2 10 lim 0 z or equivalently that 2 11 lim 0 de 0 however we shall now derive a more precise estimate of de z 1 involving and lemma 2 1 for any satisfying 1 0 there exists exactly one t 0 0 such that 2 12 z 1 0 t 1 0 where we recall that 2 13 t 1 proof in view of 2 7 we deduce that 2 14 z z i z i z where 2 15 n 1 n from the relations 2 16 0 e logz logz 1 cf 15 equations 6 5 30 and 6 5 32 p 176 2 17 lim z 1 8 claus gerhardt and 2 18 lim 0 z cf 15 theorem 6 5 8 p 181 we then conclude that there exists exactly one 0 such that 2 19 z 1 0 and furthermore that 2 20 z 1 z 1 0 0 completing the proof of the lemma thus defining the dark energy density by 2 4 and 2 5 we immediately deduce theorem 2 2 let t 0 be the temperature defined in lemma 2 1 and as sume that the temperature t satisfies t t 0 then the dark energy density guarantees that the friedmann universe with negative cosmological constant 2 21 1 0 is expanding such that 2 22 a 0 as well as 2 23 a 0 proof the friedmann equations for a perfect fluid with energy and pressure p are 2 24 a 2 a 2 2 n n 1 2 2 n n 1 a 2 and 2 25 a a 2 n n 1 n 2 np 2 n n 1 choosing de we also specified 2 26 p de yielding 2 27 a a 2 2 n n 1 de 2 n n 1 moreover in our units 2 28 2 1 and we also only consider space forms satisfying 2 29 0 applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 9 hence the theorem is proved in view of lemma 2 1 3 the inflationary period immediately after the big bang the development of the universe will have to be governed by quantum gravitational forces i e by the eigenfunctions resp eigendistributions of the corresponding temporal and spatial hamiltonians which we have combined to a single hamiltonian h acting in an abstract separable hilbert space h spanned by the eigenvectors ui 3 1 hui iui where the eigenvalues all have multiplicity 1 are ordered 3 2 0 0 1 and converge to infinity 3 3 lim i i the dominant energies near the big bang will therefore be the eigenvalues 3 4 i hui ui for large i and we shall assume when considering the development of a fried mann universe that this development is driven by a perfect fluid 3 5 t ig where 3 6 i i looking at the friedmann equations 3 7 a 2 a 2 2 2 n n 1 i 2 n n 1 a 2 and 3 8 a a 2 2 n n 1 i 2 n n 1 we conclude that the universe is expanding rapidly depending on the eigen value i i the corresponding eigenvector or particle ui will decay after some time and produce lower order eigenvectors or maybe particles that can be looked at as matter or radiation satisfying the corresponding equations of state after some time the inflationary period will have ended and only the stable ground state u 0 3 9 hu 0 0 u 0 together with conventional matter and radiation will be responsible for the further development of the friedmann universe the eigenvalue 0 is of the order n 1 n in view of 2 7 on page 7 hence it will dominate for small values of 10 claus gerhardt 4 the dark matter let be the density operator acting in the fock space f 4 1 z 1 e h where we use the same symbol h to denote the self adjoint operator h in the separable hilbert spaceh as well its canonical extension to the corresponding symmetric fock space f h f in section 2 we defined the dark energy density de by 4 2 de z 1 and we propose to define the dark matter density by 4 3 dm 0 u 0 u 0 0 e 0 z 1 where u 0 is a unit eigenvector of h satisfying 4 4 hu 0 0 u 0 and 4 5 0 1 an otherwise arbitrary constant its presence should guarantee that there exists 0 0 such that 4 6 dm de 0 0 as we shall now prove lemma 4 1 let 0 satisfy 4 5 and 4 7 1 0 0 then there exists 0 0 0 0 such that the inequality 4 6 is valid proof in view 2 16 on page 7 we have 4 8 dm de 0 0 e 0 z 1 0 e 0 z 1 e z 1 e where 4 9 e i 0 i e i 1 0 e 0 1 i 1 i e i 1 cf 15 equ 6 5 32 p 176 or simply differentiate hence we obtain 4 10 ee 0 0 e 0 e 0 1 i 1 i e i 0 e 0 0 e 0 e 0 1 i 1 i e i 0 1 applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 11 and we conclude 4 11 lim ee 0 0 since 4 12 i 1 i e i 0 1 i 1 i 0 e i 0 1 i 1 0 e i 0 1 i 1 i e i 1 0 1 0 1 i 1 i e i 1 where i is defined by 4 13 i i 0 1 0 0 i 1 thus the right hand side of 4 12 is estimated from above by 4 14 1 0 1 0 1 e i and 4 15 lim e i 0 cf 15 equ 6 5 71 p 181 furthermore we know 4 16 0 0 n 1 n cf 2 7 combining these estimates we conclude that there exists 4 17 0 0 0 0 such that 4 18 dm de 0 1 2 0 e 0 z 1 0 the limits in 4 11 and 4 15 are also uniform in because of 4 7 dark matter is supposed to be dust i e its pressure vanishes and hence dm cannot be constant which is tantamount to 4 19 6 const since we assume that is constant thus de is also not constant though we still assume that its stress energy tensor is defined by 4 20 t deg therefore we can only establish the continuity equation for 4 21 dm de and not for each density separately let a dot or a prime indicate differenti ation with respect to time t then the continuity equation has the form 4 22 dm de n dma 1 a because 4 23 pdm 0 12 claus gerhardt and 4 24 pde de the left hand side of 4 22 is equal to 4 25 dm de and we see that the continuity equation can only be satisfied if 4 26 n dm dm de a 1 a from lemma 4 1 we immediately derive lemma 4 2 let the assumptions of lemma 4 1 be satisfied and suppose that a 0 then for any solution t of 4 26 in the interval 4 27 i t 0 b t 0 b with initial value 4 28 t 0 0 the inequality 4 29 0 is valid and hence 4 30 t 0 t i furthermore can be expressed in the form 4 31 n 0 1 1 0 a 1 a where t 0 satisfies 4 32 1 2 and 4 33 lim 0 1 i e 4 34 t t 0 n 0 0 1 1 log a t log a t 0 proof 4 29 follows from 4 6 and 4 26 4 31 to prove the claim we combine 4 8 4 26 and 4 11 4 32 and 4 33 same argument as before 4 34 obvious in view of 4 31 and 4 33 applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 13 now we are prepared to solve the friedmann equations 2 24 and 2 25 on page 8 for 4 35 dm de 3 where 3 is a conventional density satisfying the equation of state 4 36 p 3 3 3 assuming 4 37 3 1 3 is only added for good measure and we are allowed to assume 4 38 3 0 since its presence is not essential we also emphasize that we have to solve an additional third equation namely equation 4 26 we shall solve the friedmann equations and 4 26 in the interval 4 39 i t 0 t 0 0 for the unknown functions a with prescribed positive initial values a 0 a 0 0 0 can be arbitrary but large enough such that the assump tions in lemma 4 1 and lemma 4 2 are satisfied if 3 vanishes then a 0 0 can be arbitrary otherwise it has to be large enough the last initial value a 0 0 cannot be arbitrary instead it has to be chosen such that the first friedmann equation is initially valid at t t 0 if these assumptions are satisfied then we shall solve the equations 2 25 on page 8 and 4 26 the first friedmann equation will then be valid auto matically for simplicity we shall only consider the case 4 40 3 0 to avoid case distinctions then we deduce from the continuity equation 4 41 3 3 a n 1 3 where 3 0 is a given constant let us now prove theorem 4 3 let the cosmological constant 4 42 1 0 be given and consider the perfect fluid defined by the density 4 43 dm de 3 satisfying the assumptions 4 23 4 24 4 36 and 4 37 moreover we suppose that t 1 and the scale factor a are functions depending on t the initial value problems 4 44 a a 2 n n 1 n 2 np 2 n n 1 14 claus gerhardt and 4 45 n dm dm de a 1 a with initial values 0 a 0 a 0 are then solvable in i t 0 provided 0 0 is so large that 2 12 on page 7 as well as 4 46 2 2 n n 1 z 1 1 1 2 n 2 0 e 0 2 n n 1 0 are valid at 0 and a 0 0 has to be chosen such that after adding 4 47 2 n n 1 n 1 3 2 3 a n 1 3 0 to the left hand side of 4 46 the inequality still remains valid at 0 the initial value a 0 is supposed to be positive the solutions a then satisfy 4 48 0 4 49 a 0 4 50 a 0 and 4 51 2 n n 1 2 2 n n 1 a 2 0 in order that a also satisfy the first friedmann equation a 0 has to be chosen appropriately namely such that the first friedmann equation is valid for t t 0 which is possible in view of 4 51 proof by introducing a new variable 4 52 a we may consider a flow equation for a where replaces a and 4 53 a is an additional equation choosing then 0 a 0 as above and 0 0 arbitrary the flow has a solution on an maximal time interval 4 54 i t 0 t 1 t 1 t 0 because of lemma 4 1 and lemma 4 2 it is also obvious that the relations 4 48 4 51 are valid in view of these lemmata furthermore if the interval i was bounded then the flow would have a singularity at t t 1 which is not possible in view of the relation 4 34 which would imply that as well as a and a would tend to infinity by approaching t 1 which however contradicts the second friedmann equation 4 44 from which we then would infer 4 55 0 a ca t i applications of canonical quantum gravity to cosmology 15 an apparent contradiction hence we deduce 4 56 i t 0 it remains to prove that the first friedmann equation is satisfied if a 0 is chosen appropriately define 4 57 a 2 2 n n 1 2 2 n n 1 a 2 then we obtain 4 58 0 in view of the continuity equations and 4 44 yielding 4 59 t t 0 0 t i 5 the missing antimatter in 15 theorem 4 3 1 p 110 we proved that a temporal eigenfunction w w t defined in r can be naturally extended past the big bang singu larity t 0 by defining 5 1 w t w t t 0 the extended function is then of class c 2 5 2 w c 2 r for some 0 1 and its restriction to t 0 is also a solution of the variational eigenvalue problem hence we have two quantum spacetimes 5 3 q r s 0 and 5 4 q r s 0 and a c 2 transition between them if we assume that the common time function t is future directed in both quantum spacetimes then the singularity in t 0 would be a big crunch for q and a big bang for q and simi larly for the corresponding friedmann universes n governed by the einstein equations no further singularities will be present i e the spacetime n will have no beginning but will end in in a big crunch and will be recreated with a big bang as the spacetime n this scenario would be acceptable if it would describe a cyclical universe however there are no further cycles there would only be one transition from a big crunch to a big bang therefore the mathematical alternative namely that at the big bang two universes with opposite light cones will be created is more convincing especially if the cpt theorem is taken into account which would require that the matter content in the universe with opposite time direction would be antimatter this second scenario would explain what happened to the missing antimatter 16 claus gerhardt 6 spherically symmetric eigenfunctions in hyperbolic space the spatial hamiltonian h 1 is a linear elliptic operator 6 1 h 1 v n 1 v n 2 rv where the laplacian is the laplacian in s 0 and r the corresponding scalar curvature we are then looking for eigenfunctions or more precisely eigendis tributions v 6 2 h 1 v v such that for each temporal eigenfunction i wi there exists a matching spatial pair i vi the product 6 3 ui wivi would then be a solution of the wave equation 1 4 on page 3 if s 0 is the hyperbolic space h n n 3 we have 6 4 r n n 1 and given any temporal eigenvalue i we would have to find functions vi satisfying 6 5 n 1 vi i n 2 2 n 1 vi we are also looking for spherically symmetric eigenfunctions vi in hyperbolic space the radial eigenfunctions known as spherical functions are well known for each c there exists exactly one radial eigenfunctions of the laplacian satisfying 6 6 2
