de cie ncies del cosmos iccub facultat de f sica universitat de barcelona mart franque s 1 08028 barcelona catalonia spain we show that belinfante construction of an improved energy momentum tensor can be carried over to curved backgrounds in analogy to the case of flat space time the results hold irrespective of the background being dynamical or a fixed non backreacting one it turns out that the analogous would be canonical energy momentum tensor is not covariantly conserved in general but its belinfante im provement is we relate this last tensor with the hilbert tensor obtained by func tionally derivating the lagrangian with respect to the metric when the background in non dynamical we discuss some issues concerning the noether conserved currents associated with its killing symmetries and the role played by the belinfante ten sor next we study extended objects p branes either in a dynamic or in a fixed background and obtain the noether identities associated both with target space time and world volume diffeomorphisms we show that in field theory as well as with extended objects the killing symmetries of the background become ordinary rigid noether symmetries of the theory in this fixed background with the example of maxwell theory in minkowski spacetime we show in an appendix the role of the belinfante tensor in the construction of these symmetries electronic address pons fqa ub edu http arxiv org abs 1708 09620 v 1 mailto pons fqa ub edu 2 i introduction this paper is devoted to the formulation of classical fields and branes in curved spacetime in particular we explore as to whether some results holding for flat spacetime can be extended to curved backgrounds in this sense this paper generalizes 1 where some aspects of field theories with the poincare group of symmetries in flat spacetime are studied in such theories it is well known that there are essentially two equivalent procedures to define a symmetric energy momentum tensor in one procedure due to belinfante 2 one starts with the canonical energy momentum tensor obtainable form the noether theorem 3 and applies to it an improvement in the form of a divergence in the second method due to hilbert 4 one covariantizes the lagrangian and defines the tensor as its euler lagrange derivative with respect to the metric setting at the end the metric to its original minkowski form rosenfeld 5 showed that both methods coincide on shell in fact belinfante tensor is only symmetric in general on shell one may wonder whether there exists some analogous construction for curved spacetime in this paper we show that this construction is possible for matter lagrangians with mini mal couplings to gravity an important difference is that the riemann tensor appears as a possible obstruction to the conservation of the would be canonical energy momentum ten sor whereas its improvement a la belinfante overcomes this obstruction and it is always conserved on shell in fact belinfante s tensor can be defined directly form the hilbert tensor with no restriction to minimal coupling cases we will next apply the previous results to theories formulated in fixed backgrouds with killing vectors the generally covariant matter lagrangian can be truncated to a fixed background and define a new lagrangian which is no longer generally covariant for the matter fields we show that the killing symmetries of the fixed background become rigid noether symmetries of the truncated lagrangian the associated conserved density current is just the contraction of the belinfante energy momentum tensor with such killing vector a sublte point concerning the realization in phase space of these symmetries is that to construct their generator one must use belinfante s not hilbert s energy momentumm tensor the second half of the paper is devoted to the classical dynamics of extended objects in a curved background which can be either dynamical or fixed our focus will be the nambu goto brane we will show the contents of the noether identities associated both with the target spacetime diffeomorphisms and world volume diffeomorphism interestingly enough we are able to obtain just from the noether analysis the equations of motion eom for the ng lagrangian that is the vanishing of the trace of the extrinsic curvature without doing any explicit computation of the euler lagrange derivatives of the ng lagrangian in the case of a fixed background we show that in a way similar to the result for field theories the killing symmetries of the background become rigid symmetries of the truncated theory a simple geometric interpretation of the associated conserved currents is also given 3 the paper is organized as follows afer some basic preliminaries section iii is devoted to the noether identities in a general background and the connection between hilbert belinfante energy momentum tensors and what we call the canonical tensor in section iv we discuss the fate of the killing symmetries in theories truncated to a fixed metric background next in section v we turn to branes in the different settings of fixed or dynamic backgrounds and we identify for the brane lagrangian the symmetries associated with the killing vectors in section vi the noether identities associated with target spacetime and or world volume diffeomorphisms are obtained conclusions are drawn in section vii we finish with two appendices the first to underline the relevance of belinfante tensor in the construction of the generator of the noether symmetries originated from killing vectors and the second in order to make the paper more selfcontained with a review of basic results on the extrinsic curvature useful for the sections on extended objects ii preliminaries here we introduce some notation and basic observations a infinitesimal diffeomorphisms praise for the active view let us examine the transformation of the fields under reparametrizations of a manifold p x x x x with x an arbitrary infinitesimal function though the infinitesimal parameter can always be factored out from x reparametrizations that is changes of coordinates are the passive interpretation of diffeomorphisms to discus the active versus passive views of diffeomorphisms consider for simplicity the case of a scalar field x according to the passive view under an infinitesimal diffeomorphism the coordinates undergo a change x x x and the fields remain the same the only change being in their mathematical description because we must write them or their components in the new coordinatization for the scalar field this is given by x x instead in the active view the coordinates do not change but the fields undergo the change x x so that the functional variation of x is x x l where the differential operator l is the lie derivative under the vector field x in general any vector tensor form will experience an active variation given by its lie derivative under x some praise is deserved for the active view of spacetime symmetries in which we only consider the functional variation of the fields first it puts the spacetime symmetries on an equal footing with respect to the other internal symmetries that may eventually exist second the functional variation commutes with the partial derivative with respect to the coordinates 0 third the functional variation of an action does not modify the boundaries because the coordinates are unchanged thus simplifying intermediate compu 4 tations fourth if the variations are obtained in a canonical phase space formalism with a generator acting through the poisson bracket they are automatically functional variations that is of the active type this is the case of conserved quantities acting as generators of symmetries according to noether s theorem when the dynamics of extended objects embedded in the manifold p is considered the same ideas apply we must distiguish in this case target spacetime diffeomorphisms and world volume diffeomorphisms but in both of them we will apply the active view it is this active view of diffeomorphisms that we will adopt throughout the paper move the structures fields branes not the coordinates b truncation to a fixed background we consider theories formulated in manifolds endowed with a lorentzian metric with g representing the metric field and the matter fields we will consider a matter lagrangian l g fully covariant that is behaving as a scalar density under diffeomorphisms at any moment l can be truncated to l 0 l g g g 0 where g 0 is a fixed background 1 this type of truncation is not a gauge fixing nor it is a consistent truncation it is not a gauge fixing because evidently there is no diffeomorphism connecting a generic metric configuration to g 0 as a truncation it is not consistent because gravity universally couples with matter and therefore the backreaction must not be neglected but it may be a useful approximation as it is the case of field theory in flat spacetime once the background is fixed for instance to minkowski spcetime the gauge symmetry of diffeomorphisms is no longer there in the minkowski case the residual not exaclty so because fixing the background is not a gauge fixing symmetry is rigid poincare it is the symmetry generated by the killing vectors of the background in the active interpretation one can still say that the spacetime configurations before and after the action of a poincare symmetry are physically indistinguishable the language remains of gauge equivalent con figurations and in fact in the passive view we see that we are describing a unique physical configuration with different coordinates but now the indeterminism with respect to the initial conditions which is a characterisitic feature of the gauge freedom has disappeared 1 by fixed background we mean a non dynamical metric field with no equations of motion for it 5 iii energy momentum tensors and noether identities in field theory a noether identities consider a first order lagrangian l with gauge freedom described by a raa a qa a a l divergence iii 1 where a are the infinitesimal arbitrary functions of the gauge symmetries in a certain number given by the running of the index a the associated noether identities are 2 l a raa l aqa a 0 iii 2 with the usual notation l a l a for the euler lagrange functional derivatives with respect to the fields or field components a or equivalently after saturating with the arbitrary functions a l a a l aq a a a 0 iii 3 we are interested in a special type of gauge symmetries spacetime diffeomorphisms in view of that it is convenient to express these identities in covariant language 3 for notational convenience let us distinguish among the generic fields a the metric field g and the matter fields a which we consider bosonic fermionic matter has to be formulated within the tetrad formalism we assume that l g depends at most on the first spacetime derivatives of the fields a as usual in the framework of generally covariant theories we consider that the matter lagrangian l g behaves as a scalar density under diffeomporphisms thus diffeompor phisms are noether gauge symmetries for the theory described by this lagrangian in the active view diffeomorphism covariance is expressed infinitesimally with the transformations lie derivative g a a qa iii 4 indices a for fields or field components may generically include spacetime indices as well as internal indices which are just the lie derivatives of the metric and the matter fields under an infinitesimal spacetime vector field the covariant derivative is defined with the levi civita connection these transformations iii 4 will induce l l the noether identities iii 3 now associated with diffeomorphism covariance read with l l g l g l a a 2 l l aqa 0 iii 5 2 this subject is quite standard all details are given for instance in 1 3 the only connection we consider throughout the paper is the levi civita connection 6 identically 4 b hilbert and belinfante s energy momentum tensors the hilbert energy momentum tensor density is defined as t 2 l g and so we can write t l a a t l aqa 0 iii 6 for arbitrary comparing with the standard results in the minkowski case see details in 1 it is reasonable to define the combination t b t l aqa iii 7 as the belinfante energy momentum tensor density 5 which will connected later see next subsection be with the canonical tensor defining qa r a qa with the christoffel symbols we may write iii 1 in a covariant form a qa qa then integrating iii 6 with the arbitrary taken with compact support we can eliminate these arbitrary functions and obtain the covariant noether identities t l aqa l aqa 0 iii 8 notice that eq iii 8 can be understood as an identity satisfied by the matter lagrangian in a fixed background clearly since to compute its hilbert tensor one has to functionally derivate with respect to the components of the metric field one must know the lagrangian for metrics around the fixed configuration but this is our case because our starting point was a fully covariant scalar density lagrangian we observe that the hilbert tensor and belinfante s according to iii 7 is covariantly conserved as long as the eom for the matter fields are satisfied irrespective of being either in a fixed or a dynamical metric background more on dynamics on a fixed background in section iv c contact with the canonical tensor to continue we will asume that the matter lagrangian depends only up to the first spacetime derivatives of the metric this means that we are excluding some non minimal 4 we have replaced the covariant derivative for the partial derivative because they coincide when defining the divergence of a vector density of weight one this is also true for the divergence of an antisymmetric tensor density this replacement will be made at convenience in the following sections with no further warning 5 we underline b to distinguish the notation for the belinfante tensor tb from a tensorial index we will do the same for the canonical tensor below 7 couplings that may use the riemann tensor 6 in addition to hilbert s and belinfante s tensors in minkowski spacetime one defines the canonical energy momentum tensor l a a l in this spirit we now define the canonical tensor 7 in curved spacetime t c l a a l iii 9 in the following we will connect this tensor with belinfante s to do so we revisit the result l l for the lie derivative of the lagrangian under an arbitrary spacetime vector it may be written 8 as l l g g l g g l a a l a a l iii 10 as consequence of our assumption the dependence of l on the derivatives of the metric will be concealed within the covariant derivatives of the fields a so that l g l a a g 1 2 m with 9 m m being a tensor density because the first factor l a in the expres sion above is a tensor density whereas the other two are tensors thus we can write iii 10 as t m l a a l a a l 0 iii 11 subtraction of iii 11 from iii 6 and the use of iii 4 together with definiton iii 9 yields the identical conservation law t l aqa m l a a qa l t b t c m l a qa g 0 iii 12 6 this restriction does not apply to the case of killing symmetries analyzed in the next section 7 denominating this tensor the canonical energy momentum tensor would be misleading because as we will see below it is not covariantly conserved in general 8 notice that we take the euler lagrange derivative l a for l a a as l a l a l a so that both terms l a and l a are geometric objects 9 we use the standard notation for symmetrization n ab 1 2 nab n ba and antisymmetrization n ab 1 2 nab n ba and so on 8 we will get interesting information from the fact that this conservation law consequence of general covariance holds for any spacetime vector relation iii 12 has the form a b c 0 iii 13 identically being arbitary the coefficient of must vanish which implies that c is antisymmetric in its first two upper indices c c which in turn means that the last term in iii 13 is 10 c 1 2 c r so finally we obtain c c b 0 a 1 2 c r 0 which translated to iii 12 becomes c m l a qa g 0 t b t c c 0 t b t c 1 2 c r iii 14 the third equation in iii 14 is just a consistency check for the second the second equation gives the relation t b t c c iii 15 the first equation is a statement on the decomposition of l a qa g into partially symmetric and partially antisymmetric parts that is l a qa g c m as a matter of fact it is well known that given an object with three indices o it has a unique decomposition of the form o o a o s in particular defining the antisymmetric combination s a b b qa g qa g qa is linear in the fields for the lie derivative iii 4 it turns out that c 1 2 l a s a b l a s a b l a s a b b iii 16 expressions iii 15 and iii 16 generalize to curved spacetime the classical formulas for obtaining belinfante s tensor as an improvement of the canonical tensor see section 4 1 of 1 with a caveat in curved spacetime since iii 8 and iii 7 imply that belinfante s 10 we use the conventions in 6 9 tensor is covariantly conserved on shell we infer that the canonical tensor is not conserved in general indeed from the third equation in iii 14 we obtain t c on shell 1 2 c r iii 17 with r the riemann tensor thus the construction of the belinfante tensor out of the canonical tensor is not exactly an improvement but a procedure to obtain a conserved tensor which coincides on shell with hilbert tensor see iii 7 and thus is symmetric on shell only for minkowski spacetime with vanishing riemann tensor or for theories with only scalar fields for which qa in iii 4 vanishes the covariant conservation of the canonical tensor can be generally asserted iv fixed backgrounds with killing vectors complementing what has been already said we notice that the basic equations of the previous section iii 6 iii 8 iii 11 iii 12 can be understood as identities satisfied by the matter lagrangian l 0 truncated to a fixed background g 0 in this section we will interpret these equations in this sense as identities they are a gift from the former diffeo morphism covariance enjoyed by the theory before truncation an immediate consequence of identity iii 6 and definition iii 7 is that if is a killing k vector of the fixed background that is g 0 k iv 1 then l 0 a a t b 0 k iv 2 identically eq iv 2 neatly displays the result that the killing symmetries of the back ground g 0 have morphed into rigid noether symmetries for the truncated lagrangian l 0 also this equation identifies the vector density j t b k iv 3 as the noether current for this rigid symmetry l 0 a a j 0 we may say in field theory the conserved density current of a noether symmetry generated by a killing vector of the fixed background is the contraction of the belinfante energy momentum tensor with such killing vector one finds in the literature a trivial proof of the existence of an the shell conserved current t based on the killing condition iv 1 and the fact that hilbert tensor is on shell 10 covariantly conserved but the status of a noether symmetry is more than that and this conservation does not make the current to be a noether current although both currents coincide on shell the true noether current associated with the killing symmetries of a fixed background is iv 3 which uses the belinfante not hilbert s tensor switching to canonical variables one would find as generator under the poisson bracket of the symmetry the quantity g d 3 xj 0 which under suitable conditions at the spatial boundary is a conserved charge if the matter theory is a gauge theory there may be obstructions 7 for this quantity g the generate the symmetry transformations in phase space as an illustration we work out in apendix a some details of the application of this analysis to vacuum maxwell theory in flat spacetime and we will show the crucial role played by belinfante tensor in constructing the internal gauge symmetry generators notice that in the case of a fixed background with killing vectors as far as the rigid noether symmetries generated by the killing vectors are concerned we do not need to restrict ourselves to the minimal coupling case leading to iii 10 because g vanishes thus we can write iii 10 with no restrictions on the coupling to gravity as l 0 l 0 a a l 0 a a l 0 k iv 4 for the lagrangian l 0 in the fixed background g 0 and with being a killing vector of g 0 comparison of iv 4 with iv 2 shows the existence of an identically conserved density current t b l 0 a a l 0 0 k iv 5 which again is a gift from the general covariance properties held by the theory before being truncated to a fixed background some comments are in order eq iv 5 and eq eq iv 2 show that there are two equivalent presentations of the noether conserved density current associated with the killing symmetry the classical one would have been by typical use of noetherian methods from iv 4 j class l 0 a a l 0 k whereas the alternative presentation is iv 3 as far as we know little attention is paid in the literature to the relationship existing between these two currents both currrents differ by an identically conserved density current which must have locally the form j j class n with n an antisymmetric tensor density 11 thus both g d 3 xj 0 or gclass d 3 xj 0 class generate the same transformations because they differ by a boundary term 11 with a torsionless connection n n notice that n n 12 n 11 an example just as an example let us consider the lagrangian l 0 1 2 gr 2 which describes a non minimal coupling of a scalar field with the metric through the cur vature scalar here for a fixed background and suppose that is a killing vector for this background one can write iv 5 for this case as here hilbert and belinfante tensors coincide t l 0 g 2 r 2 0 k iv 6 and using for the killing vector the relation r k one easily finds for the relevant term in iv 6 g 2 r 2 n n k with n the antisymmetric tensor density n g 2 2 2 k thus explicitating in this example the identical conservation of iv 5 a conformal killing vectors going back to iii 6 t l a a t b 0 iv 7 for arbitrary we realize that conformal killing vectors g are noether symmetries of the truncated lagrangian as long as the product t is a diver gence with t the trace of the hilbert tensor thus the requirement is t d d for a vector density d then iv 7 will be written as l a a t b 1 2 d 0 iv 8 1 2 r n 1 2 r n 1 2 r n 1 2 r n r n 0 with r the ricci tensor which is symmetric 12 condition t d amounts 12 to require that the euler lagrange derivatives of t vanish t a t a t a 0 iv 9 this is a check that must be done in a case by case basis in the particular case of homothetic killing vectors constant the condition to implement a noether symmetry is that t must be a divergence that is t a 0 obviously t 0 is a particular case of fulfillment of iv 9 in such case all conformal killing vectors yield noether symmetries of the truncated theory a well know example is maxwell theory in a curved background including the flat case where the hilbert tensor satisfies this condition in d 4 dimensions indeed for the lagrangian l 1 4 gf f the hilbert tensor is t g l gf f iv 10 whose trace is t 4 d l v extended objects the nambu goto brane consider a lorentzian manifold p the background and a submanifold m the p brane or brane the levi civita covariant derivative is defined on p as notation x will be the coordinates on p and a the coordinates on m the embedding of the brane is locally defined by the functions x thus on the tangent bundle tm a x a x u a x as a matter of language we can also say that the world volumem is embedded in the target spacetime p notice that u a defined with support onm is a contravariant vector under reparametriza tions of the background and a covariant vector under reparametrizations of the brane let g be the background metric the induced metric on the brane is locally given by ab g u a u b we consider massive branes the p brane is a p dimensional spacelike object evolving along the time coordinate of the lorentzian manifold p thus the induced metric ab is again lorentzian considering the index a as a label u a span a basis for tm we can rise and lower indices with ab g and their inverses so for instance u a abg u b note that t u au a v 1 12 all our statements are local 13 is the projector from tp m to tm note also that given a vector v in tp m its orthogonal projection to tm is va ua v proof t v u au a v u a v a v a a 13 more geometric results are given in appendix b the nambu goto ng lagrangian of the p brane is l v 2 where is the determinant of ab and the tension of the brane in the following we will take 1 for simplicity regarding the analysis of the covariance of v 2 with respect to spacetime diffeomor phisms there is the crucial difference as to whether we consider a dynamical or a fixed background of course if the background is dynamical the variational principle with la grangian v 2 is incomplete because the kinetic terms for instance the einstein hilbert lagrangian for the metric are missing but the behaviour of v 2 under target spacetime diffeomorphisms can be studied nevertheless a dynamical background in the case of a brane we can think of it as a limit of a regular scalar field when its support shrinks to m if the field is peaked at a point with coordinates x 0 the actively transformed field will be peaked at coordinates x 0 x 0 x 0 so that x x in the case of the brane this means that the embedding has changed from x to x x x alongside with it the metric field will have changed under the active diffeomorphisms as well with g x g x g x l g all in all the lagrangian v 2 will have changed to l where ab g x x a x b notice in this expression above the subtle point that the active interpretation of diffeomor phisms imposes that the new spacetime metric g is computed at the points x of the new embedding since the new embedding is x x x we obtain to first order in the infinitesimal parameter ab g x x x x a x x b g x l g u au b g x u au b ab v 3 which in turn implies that since the induced metric is invariant ab ab so it is indeed the lagrangian l 0 note that the proof of invariance would be the same for a lagrangian 13 this result implies that for vectors already in tm but expressed in the target spacetime coordinates ua converts target spacetime indices into world volume indices 14 describing the minimal coupling of a p brane with a p 1 form which is a generalization of the coupling of the particle to the electromagnetic gauge field again the change of the world volume description of the brane will be matched by the active change of the p 1 form thus the requisite of general covariance is satisfied of course under world volume dif feomorphisms the lagrangian is not invariant but behaves as a scalar density see details in section vib summing up the lagrangians of the ng brane and its generalizations are scalar densities under world volume diffeomorphisms and are invariant under target space diffeo morphisms b fixed background in the case of a fixed background an active diffeomorphism will move the brane and all the other existing structures and fields according to their geometric character except for the metric which will remain unchanged the reason is that in the active view we do not change the coordinates and hence a fixed background remains the same now the lagrangian will have changed to l where ab g x x a x b notice the crucial difference with the previous case now we have written g instead of g and we obtain ab g x l g u au b where l is the lie derivative under the vector field as for the determinant 1 t l g with t abu au b the projector defined above v 1 finally for the variation of the lagrangian we obtain l l l 1 2 t l g v 4 note that if is a killing vector of the background then l g 0 that is the lagrangian is invariant but now under a rigid not gauge symmetry summing up starting with a theory v 2 with invariance under the target spacetime diffeomorphisms we have ended up after freezing the background with a theory in which the killing symmetries of such fixed background have morphed into rigid noether symmetries of the new theory this is the same phenomenon already seen in field theory eq iv 2 iv 3 15 we can look for the conserved current under this symmetry since l l x is the euler lagrange derivative l l x a l u a x v 5 now for x being a killing vector we infer from v 4 that l 0 and the on shell conserved current is the world volume density vector we factor out the infinitesimal parameter in so now will be finite ja l u a x l u a ua a k v 6 this is a nice result according to the intepretation of ua made after eq v 1 we have found that for the ng brane the conserved density current of a noether symmetry generated by a killing vector of the fixed background is the densitized projection to tm of such killing vector eventually there can be a conserved charge g dp j 0 where the integration is at 0 constant but this conservation in will crucially depend on the spatial boundary of the brane in the particular case of the massive particle in a fixed background with lagrangian l m g x x this conserved charge is g 1 g x x g x but regardless of being conserved or not g is nevertheless the gauge generator in the canonical formalism since from v 6 j 0 l u 0 x p with p the momenta canonically conjugate to the target spacetime coordinates we obtain the trivial result in the canonical formalism for the variation of the embedding x x g equal x dp p equal the algebra of the noether symmetries associated with killing symmetries of the fixed background reproduces that of the killing symmetries if and are two killing vectors then g and g satisfy g g g again with the massive particle consider a stationary background with x 0 the back ground time coordinate so that x 0 is a killing vector 0 if is the world line parameter the induced metric has a single component x 2 where x 2 g x x the embedding is u x and u 1 g u g x x 2 so u g x x 2 p applying v 6 the conserved quantity j g is g 0 p p 0 which is the ex pected result for a mechanical system with a cyclic coordinate x 0 namely that its conjugate momentum p 0 is a constant of motion 16 vi noether identities for the brane it is instructive regardless of the killing condition to compute directly the divergence of a ua for an arbitrary infintesimal we have 1 a a a a a ua a ua ua a abg a u b ua u ag abg k ab 1 2 t l g vi 1 where we have used that au b k ab is the extrinsic curvature of the brane see the appendix b for details and also for a discussion on the covariant derivatives a a note that vi 1 can be rearranged as k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature 1 2 t l g g k a a vi 2 which is exactly v 5 applied to our case with x and a ua eq vi 2 is an identity actually it is a noether identity see next subsection with arbitrary as a byproduct we obtain comparing v 5 and vi 2 l l x g k vi 3 that is we have obtained the well known result see for instance 12 that the eom for the ng lagrangian is the vanishing of the trace of the extrinsic curvature with no need to make the explicit computation of the eom a target spacetime noether identities as anticipated above eq vi 2 has yet another interpretation it is the noether identity for the target spacetime diffeomorphism invariance of the ng lagrangian v 2 when the background is dynamical indeed given some fields or field components a and expressing the active infinitesimal gauge transformation as iii 1 with x x but now for the world volume action a ra qaa a vi 4 where a is a generic field or field component and a u a the noether identity in the version with the arbitrary functions in it takes the form iii 3 but with derivatives with respect to the a coordinates of the brane l a a a l aqaa 0 vi 5 in our case the fields a are the target coordinates x and the metric g x for the metric g l g which implies with a for the world volume description g r qa a with r g q a g u a g u a vi 6 17 then taking this into account together with x we obtain the noether iden tity associated with target spacetime diffeomorphism invariance of the ng brane l l g l l x l g l a l g ua g ua 0 vi 7 identically using the fact that l g 1 2 t and eq vi 3 one can check that eq vi 7 saturated with becomes vi 2 the advantage of the noether identity formulation eq vi 5 vi 7 is that it shows how the mecanism works beyond the ng lagrangian that is when we consider corrections to it in the first term of eq vi 5 there will always be the term l g g if the background is fixed the factor l g will not vanish in general but g will vanish by definition for the variations engendered by the killing vectors of the metric thus defining the on shell conserved current see eq vi 5 vi 6 ja l g qa b world volume noether identities clearly the ng lagrangian v 2 is generally covariant with respect to world volume diffeomorphisms so that in the active intepretation with a a we will have x a ax and due to the variation x there will be a vicarious variation of g x but the metric won t have any variation by its own unlike the case of the target spacetime diffeomorphisms both the target coordinates and the metric components are scalars under world volume diffeomorphisms all in all we find the world volume scalar density behaviour l a al the noether identity becomes l u a 0 identically its contents for the ng case is just k g u a 0 which is an identity proved directly in appendix b see eq b 9 vii conclusions in this paper we have extended the results in 1 to curved spacetime and in addition we have made a parallel analysis for the case of extended objects embedded in the back ground we have shown in particular the relationship between the canonical tensor belin fante energy momentum tensor and hilbert energy momentum tensor when these results are applied lo matter lagrangians truncated to a fixed background we have shown that the killing symmetries of the background become ordinary non gauge noether symmetries of 18 the truncated theory we stress the role of the belinfante tensor in the construction both of the noether conserved current and of the canonical generator of the symmetries we have followed similar lines to analyze the case of ng branes embedded in the back ground distinguishing the two types of gauge symmetries available namely target space diffeomorphisms and world volume diffeomorphisms we use the noether identities of the former type to give an alternative derivation of the eom of the theory truncated to a fixed background again the killing symmetries of the fixed background give rise to noether sym metries of the world volume theory with a simple geometric intepretation of the conserved currents appendix a poincare symmetries as the killing symmetries for maxwell theory in flat spacetime in this appendix we do not intend to give a complete analysis on how the poincare transformations for the maxwell gauge field in flat spacetime can be reproduced within the canonical formalism our much more modest goal here is to underline the crucial relevance of the belinfante tensor in such an endeavour in flat spacetime with mostly plus metric the maxwell lagrangian is l 1 4 f f the momentum canonically conjugate to a is l a f 0 which identifies the primary constraint 0 0 means equality on shell hilbert energy momentum tensor t iv 10 is obtained by the standard methods belinfante energy momentum tensor is from iii 7 t b t l a qa l f f f a notice that the last term which vanishes on shell distinguishes this tensor from hilbert tensor t acording to iv 2 the conserved current is j t b l f f f a with the killing vector a x describing the infinitesimal poincare transformations the candidate to be the generator of these transformations is g d 3 x j 0 which expressed with the canonical variables is 0 i with bi 1 2 ijkfjk g d 3 x 1 2 2 b 2 0 b i i a a 1 there is an ambiguity in g because a term linear in the primary constraint 0 can be added without consequences in tangent space the pullback of this term from phase space to tengent space vanishes identically this ambiguity can be solved in the light of the analysis in 7 but we will not dwell further on this issue 19 although it is not our goal here let us mention that following the results in 7 one can immediately identify a problem with this expression a 1 in what concerns its eventual role as generator of noether symmetries as a matter of fact g 0 i i 0 where one can identify in the right hand side the secondary constraint of maxwell theory the gauss law i i 0 the presence of a necessarily first class secondary constraint in the rhs of the computation of the poisson bracket of g with a first class primary constraint signals an obstruction for the projectability from tangent space to phase space of some of the transformations generated by g in our case we infer from the results of 7 section iii b that this quantity g won t generate the time translation for a 0 we say that this transformation which can be written straightforwardly in tangent space a 0 ta 0 is not projectable to phase space it can not be retrieved by canonical methods alone 14 because owing to the fact that 0 is a constraint the velocity a 0 can not be expressed in terms of the canonical variables more details can be found in 7 but let us compute some projectable transformations all transformations for the space components ai of the gauge field are projectable and are not affected by the ambiguity in g mentioned above so we have ai ai g i 0 b i i a it is immediate to verify that the pullback of this transformation to tangent space is exactly what is expected indeed after implementing the pullback i f 0 i ai f 0 i 0 fij j ia a i ai a i l ai a 2 with l the lie derivative under the poincare killing vector a x in fact rem iniscent of the original diffeomorphism covariance before truncation to a fixed background of our matter lagrangian eq a 2 gives indeed the right transformation under general dif feomorphisms arbitrary but only for poincare transformations we do have a noether symmetry in flat spacetime let us stress the crucial role played in this computation by the term i i a in a 1 which would have been missing should we had used the hibert tensor instead of belinfante s the projectability problem mentioned above is solved by adding to the generator a 1 the generator of a particular u 1 gauge transformation details in the more general framework of einstein yang mills theories are given in 10 14 a parallel situation takes place in the canonical formalism of einstein hilbert lagrangian for general relativity where some diffeomorphisms are not projectable to phase space see 8 9 for an analysis and a way out of that situation 20 appendix b basic notions on the extrinsic curvature consider a riemannian or lorentzian manifold p the background and a submanifold m the brane the levi civita covariant derivative is defined on p as notation x will be the coordinates on p and a the coordinates on m the embedding of the brane is locally defined by the functions x thus on tm tangent space a x a x u a x notice that u a defined with support on m is a contravariant vector under reparametriza tions of the background and a covariant vector under reparametrizations of the brane let g be the background metric the induced metric on the brane is locally given by ab g u a u b b 1 considering the index a as a label u a span a basis for tm we can enlarge this basis to form a basis for tp m tp m tm t m with some new vectors u a with labels a which we will take orthonormal and orthogonal to tm that is with the notation a a a g u au a aa b 2 we can define the matrix ua as the inverse matrix to u a notice that these inverses still go through the rule of raising and lowering indices with the corresponding metric or inverse metric ua abg u b u a a b g u b consider vector fields x y in tm one can compute xy under the background levi civita covariant derivative and decompose it in its tangent part in tm and an orthogonal part in t m in fact we have u au a u a ua t h b 3 where t projects onto tm and h onto t m the projection to tm will define the induced covariant derivative on tm and the projection to t m will define the extrinsic curvature 1 induced covariant derivative with x xa a x that is x xau a and same for y we obtain for the tangent part x y t xa ay c au b u au b u c y b c 21 which defines the induced covariant derivative xa ay c c with connection cab abx u a u b u c b 4 this induced connection is obviously torsionless one can easily check that it is metric compatible by taking for instance adapted coordinates thus we infer that cab is the levi civita connection for m 2 extrinsic curvature the t m component of xy will define the second fundamental form or extrinsic cur vature k x y xy h its components in the basis u a of t m turn out to be kc ab abx u au b u c b 5 which is obviously symmetric note that from b 4 and b 5 we can write abx u au b c abu c k c abu c b 6 now let us remember what we said on the double vector character of u a under background and brane reparametrizations to take into account both behaviours the complete covariant derivative a is defined so that au b au b u a u b cabu c b 7 which in view of b 6 can be writen as au b k c abu c k ab b 8 now we can directly prove that k ab is orthogonal to tm let us compute using b 8 aabc k ab g u c au b g u c a u b g u c u b g au c a bc au c g u b aacb b 9 but it is well known that a three index quantity aabc symmetric in two indices a b and antisymmetric in two indices b c must vanish 3 expressions for the extrinsic curvature since u b are taken orthonormal we have kc ab c d k abg u d c d au b g u d c d u b g au d c d u b g u a u d u b g au c b 10 22 or au c t k c ab bcu c b 11 in the particular case of a spacelike codimension one brane on a lorentzian background then c 0 00 1 mostly plus u c n notice from b 2 that n n 1 kc ab kab which is of interest for the adm formalism of general relativity 11 we will have from b 11 and using n an 0 an kabu b if we take an adapted coordinatization so that a xi a subset of the background coor dinates and m is locally defined by the remaining background coordinates xi as functions of xi we will have u a i etc so from b 10 kc ij c d gj iu d c d iujd c d iju d c d j ijuj d where ujd 0 has been used in the last two equalities in the adm case m will be an equal time surface and we will have kij inj 0 ijn 0 continuing with adapted coordinates the i j components of the lie derivative of the background metric read l u c gij u c gij g j iu c g i ju c 2 iujc 2 c d kd ij so kc ij 1 2 c d l u d gij which in the adm case yields kij 12 lngij 4 dynamical intepretation of the extrinsic curvature here we show that the vanishing of the trace of the extrinsic curvature is just the contents of the eom of the ng brane first let us write the trace of the extrinsic curvature from b 8 k abk ab ab au b x t where is the dalembertian of the world volume the brane with x taken as it is as a scalar under world volume diffeomorphisms and t abu au b is the projector onto tm defined in b 3 now consider the ng dynamics defined by the lagrangian l with the determinant of ab the e l functional derivatives turn out to be l x g k 23 thus the contents of the eom is the vanishing of the trace of the extrinsic curvature the curvature vector 12 for the 0 brane particle k 0 is the geodesic equation with arbitrary time parameter in fact k particle p x x x with p g x x where p is the projector orthogonal to the velocity x so k 0 means that x x x x for some function this function vanishes when is taken to be the proper time or a parameter proportional to it 1 j m pons noether symmetries energy momentum tensors and
