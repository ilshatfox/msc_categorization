institute for applied problems in mechanics and mathematics national academy of sciences of ukraine 3 b naukova street lviv 79060 ukraine e mail plyatskor gmail com abstract in this paper analytical solutions of the mathisson papapetrou equa tions that describe nonequatorial circular orbits of a spinning particle in the schwarz schild de sitter background are studied and the role of the cosmological constant is emphasized it is shown that generally speaking a highly relativistic velocity of the particle is a necessary condition of motion along this type of orbits with an exception of orbits locating close to the position of the static equilibrium where low velocities are possible as well depending on the correlation between the spin orientation of the particle and its orbital velocity some of the possible nonequatorial circular orbits exist due to the repulsive action on the particle caused by the spin gravity coupling and the others are caused by the attractive action here values of the energy of the particle on the corresponding orbits are also analyzed keywords spinning particle schwarzschild de sitter background highly rela tivistic motions spin gravity coupling pacs 04 20 q 95 30 sf 1 introduction description of circular orbits is considered very important when it comes to in vestigating different possible types of test particles motions in gravitational fields for simple test particles which follow geodesic lines in schwarzschild s and kerr s metrics the corresponding analysis is presented for example in classical books 1 2 despite the fact that circular orbits describe only few partial cases of all possible trajectories they illustrate some important features of influence that a strong gravi tational field has on a fast moving particle in particular these orbits are interesting in the context of studying possible synchrotron radiation 3 4 5 highly relativistic equatorial circular orbits of test particles with inner rotation spin in the schwarzschild kerr and schwarzschild de sitter backgrounds are thor oughly investigated 6 7 8 9 10 using the mathisson papapetrou mp equations 11 12 which were derived for classical nonquantum spinning particles and proved to follow from the general relativistic dirac equation in certain classical approxima tion later on 13 as far as types of orbits of the test particle in schwarzshild s and kerr s back ground are concerned the majority of researchers turn their attention to equatorial 1 http arxiv org abs 1811 01391 v 2 orbits only and only few of them are looking into the possibility of existence of nonequatorial orbits as well for example in 14 it was suggested that such orbits might be allowed in the kerr metric according to the geodesic equations however in 15 with more careful analysis being conducted this suggestion was refuted and it was indubitably proved that the correspondent solutions do not exist in the case of a spinning test particle its nonequatorial circular orbits in schwarzschild s and kerr s backgrounds are considered in 9 16 17 nowadays a lot of attention is drawn to unraveling the role which the cosmo logical constant plays in astrophysics and cosmology so it would be interesting to study the influence of on motion of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background in this context we point out the recent papers 18 19 nat urally it is important to continue further research in line with the investigation presented in 10 18 19 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of in the case of possible nonequatorial circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background in more general context the data concerning influence of on highly relativistic spinning particles are useful for more detailed analysis of formation stages of the universe the paper is organized in the following way basic information about the mp equations is presented in sect 2 sect 3 is devoted to the analysis of the main relations following from the mp equations for possible nonequatorial circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background thoroughgoing analysis of different special cases of these orbits is given in sect 4 in sect 5 the energy of the spinning particle on the nonequatorial circular orbits is estimated we conclude in sect 6 2 initial equations we use the mp equations in the form that was presented in 11 d ds mu u ds ds 1 2 u s r 1 ds ds u u ds ds u u ds ds 0 2 s u 0 3 where u dx ds is the particle s 4 velocity s is the antisymmetric tensor of spin m and d ds are the mass and the covariant derivative along u respectively here and in the following greek indices run through 1 2 3 4 and latin indices run through 1 2 3 the signature of the metric and the unites c g 1 are chosen later instead of 3 other relations for the tensor of spin were introduced and now these relations are known as supplementary conditions for the mp equations different conditions are connected with different representative points that describe the motion of the particle 12 as in our previous papers 7 9 10 22 23 24 2 below we use condition 3 detailed analysis of physical meaning of this condition is carried out in 25 and what is most important the known helical solutions of eqs 1 3 are explained other aspects of using condition 3 in practical calculations are discussed in 26 27 working with eqs 1 3 it is convenient to use their representation through the spin 3 vector si which is defined by si 1 2 g iklskl 4 where ikl is the spatial levi civita symbol for example with condition 3 the three independent equations of set 2 can be rewritten as u 4 s i u 4 si 2 u 4 ui u u 4 ui sku k 2 sn n 4 ui u 0 5 where are the christoffel symbols a dot denotes the usual differentiation with respect to the proper time s and square brackets denote antisymmetrization of indices equation 5 can be obtained directly from the three equations of set 2 with the spatial indices by using the expression si 4 uk u 4 ski 6 which follows from 3 and the relation skl 1 g klmsm 7 that is the inverse relation to 4 3 relations which follow from the mp equations in the schwarzschild de sitter metric for nonequatorial circular orbits we use the schwarzschild de sitter metric in the standard coordinates x 1 r x 2 x 3 x 4 t then the nonzero components of the metric tensor g are g 11 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 g 22 r 2 g 33 r 2 sin 2 g 44 1 2 m r r 2 3 8 where m and 0 are respectively the mass parameter and the cosmological constant let us check if eqs 1 3 in metric 8 have solutions that describe nonequa torial circular orbits with r const 6 0 const 6 0 2 9 3 u 3 d ds const 6 0 u 4 dt ds const 6 0 10 taking into account eq 2 in the form 5 by 9 we obtain s 1 s 3 u 3 u 4

133 s 2 g 33 233 0 16 after calculating the christoffel symbols 133 1 44 and 2 33 for metric 8 relation 16 becomes s 1 1 3 m r s 2 cos r sin 0 17 concerning the set of eqs 1 we note that with relation 9 10 14 and 15 the two equations with 3 and 4 are satisfied automatically the other two with 1 and 2 can be rewritten through the 3 vector components s 1 and s 2 as m 133 u 3 u 3 144 u 4 u 4 u 3 133 g

into account explicit expressions for the christoffel symbols and relation 17 we obtain from 18 and 19 u 3 mr 6 s 2 sin 1 r 3 3 m s 2 6 0 21 at s 2 0 eqs 18 and 19 do not have solutions by 20 and 21 we write u 4 mr 2 6 s 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 1 r 3 3 m 2 36 s 22 m 2 r 4 1 2 22 4 we consider direct motions in time when u 4 0 and the condition g 44 0 is used using expressions 21 and 22 we find the necessary and sufficient condition for compatibility of eqs 18 20 in the form sin 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 r 3 3 m m r 4 9 m r r 3 3 m 1 r 3 3 m 36 s 22 m 2 r 4 1 1 r 3 3 m 6 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 3 m r 1 23 in the written below it is necessary to take into account the physical condition for the spinning test particle 28 s 0 mr 1 24 where s 0 is the absolute value of its spin by contracting eq 3 with s it is shown that s 0 is a constant of motion of the mp eqs 1 3 and by definition s 20 1 2 s s 25 it is not difficult to calculate that for the solutions of the mp equations for the nonequatorial circular orbits in the schwarzschild de sitter background the relation s 20 s 22 r 2 u 4 2 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 cos 2 1 3 m r 2 sin 2 26 takes place using eq 22 from 26 we get s 0 mr 6 s 22 m 2 r 4 a b 27 where a 6 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 3 m r 1 r 3 3 m 36 s 22 m 2 r 4 4 m r 9 m 2 r 2 r 2 3 1 2 b 1 3 m r 1 r 3 3 m 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 1 r 3 3 m 2 36 s 22 m 2 r 4 1 2 28 it follows from 27 that condition 24 is satisfied when 6 s 22 m 2 r 4 1 29 5 then by 24 and 27 29 the following relation between the left hand side of 29 and takes place 6 s 22 m 2 r 4 6 1 3 m r 1 2 1 r 3 3 m 3 2 1 o 30 note that expressions 21 22 23 26 and 28 are exact in contrast to 30 and other relations below in the next section where we present results of the ana lytical calculations at condition 29 this approach is possible due to the existence the natural physical small value which is determined in 24 4 conditions of existence of nonequatorial circular orbits of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background below in this section we consider the possibility of the dynamic equilibrium of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background in the form of the nonequatorial circular orbits from eqs 21 23 and 30 we obtain the explicit conditions on the motion of the particle along possible nonequatorial circular orbits in terms of its coordinates and velocity 4 1 the case r 3 3 m 1 we begin with the partial case r 3 3 m 1 31 when the basic expressions for the schwarzschild de sitter background is close to the corresponding expressions for the schwarzschild background which is interesting from the physical point of view indeed under conditions g 44 0 and 0 we have m r 2 and then it follows from 31 that r 2 3 1 32 note that according to eq 8 the only difference between the schwarzschild de sitter and the schwarzschild metrics is the term r 2 3 so 31 let us estimate the small corrections caused by 6 0 and check the boundary transition condition 23 can be satisfied only if the right hand side of 23 is within in the interval 0 1 we analyze eq 23 in the linear approximation in then according to 23 we write sin 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 m m r 1 m r 4 9 m r r 2 3 1 9 m r 6 1 2 m r 1 3 m r 1 33 6 where by 29 and 30 36 s 22 m 2 r 4 1 34 i e we put that not only the value in the left hand side of 29 but the six times bigger value in 34 is also much smaller then 1 let us estimate when the right hand side of 33 has values in the interval 0 1 first of all we note that for 0 the right hand side of 33 is equal to 1 when the second order algebraic equation for m r is satisfied 1 2 m r 1 m r 4 9 m r 6 1 2 m r 1 3 m r 35 this equation has real roots which in the linear for approximation for are m r 1 7 15 1 5 m r 2 1 3 1 36 then according to 33 the condition sin 2 1 is satisfied if and only if 15 7 m 1 5 r 3 m 1 37 or approximately when the small value is neglected in comparison with 1 15 7 m r 3 m 38 in the corresponding approximation it follows from the right hand side of 33 that the minimal value of sin 2 is equal to 0 465 and is achieved at r 5 5 3 5 1 2 35 m at r 2 25 m and r 2 5 m from 33 we have sin 2 0 5 when 6 0 it is easy to obtain from 33 the corresponding corrections to expressions 36 in the linear approximation in and a generalization of condition 37 for a nonzero is 15 7 m 1 5 152 74 12 m 2 r 3 m 1 39 here the relation m 2 1 takes place as a simple consequence of 32 for 0 and g 44 0 so relations 33 and 37 determine the space region of existence of the nonequa torial circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter back ground with condition 34 for motions on the orbits with an arbirtuary value of r from the interval which is determined by 39 and with the corresponding value of sin 2 which follows from 33 7 the spinning particle must possess the orbital velocity that is determined by 21 in the certain sense this situation is similar to the case of the equatorial circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background which were considered in 10 for example there is correspondence between expression 21 and the expression for u 3 in the case of the equatorial circular orbits obtained in 10 for r 3 m u 3 1 r 3 m r 1 1 2 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 4 1 1 o 40 indeed according to 17 for sin 1 and r 6 3 m we have s 1 0 i e the spin is orthogonal to the equatorial plane and by 39 the condition sin 1 is satisfied for r 15 7 m 1 152 74 12 m 2 41 this expression is written in the approximation when is neglected and the same approximation is used in 40 it is not difficult to check that for sin 1 and r from 41 in the corresponding approximation both expressions 21 and 40 have the same value u 3 2 1 23 1 451 4 1 41 4 152 74 m 2 1 m 42 so when sin 1 and r tends to the value that is determined by the right hand side of 41 the nonequatorial circular orbits tend to the corresponding equatorial circular orbit it is a feature which shows the common physical nature of the nonequatorial and equatorial circular orbits in this context we note that according to the analysis from sect iv d of paper 10 eqs 70 76 the corresponding orbits cannot be interpreted as some partial case of the known helical solutions of eqs 1 3 this issue will be discussed in more detail in sect iv after eq 78 let us estimate the orbital velocity of the spinning particle that is necessary for its motion on nonequatorial circular orbits from the point of view of an observer which is at rest relative to the source of the schwarzschild de sitter background for this observer the particle moving with any 4 velocity u possess the lorentz factor which is determined by the expression u 4 u 4 43 relationship 39 follows directly from the definition of the factor 1 1 v 2 44 where v 2 is the second power of the particle s 3 velocity relative to the observer in the case of diagonal metric 8 according to the general expression for the 3 velocity components vi we write 31 vi dxi g 44 dt 45 8 then for v 2 we have v 2 viv i ikv ivk 46 where ik is the 3 space metric tensor with the following relationship between ik and g for the diagonal metric ik gik equation 43 follows from 44 with u u 1 after 22 30 and 43 we have 2 1 1 6 1 3 m r 1 2 1 r 3 3 m 1 2 47 it follows from 47 that when r 3 3 m is not very close to 1 in particular in schwarzschild s background the relationship 2 1 48 takes place i e the corresponding value of the velocity of the particle is highly relativistic we will use eq 47 below for other cases of nonequatorial circular orbits 4 2 other conditions for r 3 3 m let us consider relation 23 at the condition 1 r 3 3 m 1 1 r 3 3 m 49 because 1 this condition is satisfied both for 0 and for 6 0 if r 3 3 m is not very close to 1 according to 21 and 34 it follows from 49 that ru 3 2 1 and it means that the particle velocity is highly relativistic then eq 23 at 49 takes the form y 2 x 5 1 sin 2 y x 2 x 3 x 2 9 x sin 2 1 2 x 34 x 45 x 2 6 sin 2 0 50 where for the sake of brevity we use the notation x r m y m 2 3 51 by 51 eq 50 is the second order algebraic equation for where the correspond ing coefficients depend on m r and sin 2 4 2 1 the case sin 2 first of all we want to point out that according to eq 50 the nonequatorial circular orbits are allowed for any x 3 with a specific value of even when the angle is very close to 0 in contrast to the case considered above with r 2 1 indeed if sin 2 0 1 52 9 eq 50 along with the condition g 44 0 has a single positive root y 1 x 3 6 x 4 x 3 53 according to eq 21 the necessary value of the velocity of the particle u 3 on such orbits is u 3 1 yx 3 mmx 6 s 2 54 because from 53 1 yx 3 6 1 3 x 55 it follows from 54 u 3 mmx s 2 1 3 x 56 in notation 51 with the expression for which follows from 30 condition 49 means 6 1 3 x 1 2 1 yx 3 1 2 57 then it is easy to check that the value y in 53 satisfy 57 if and only if 58 note that for s 2 0 and any fixed x 3 in 56 u 3 0 and for 0 we have u 3 0 according to eqs 51 and 53 the necessary value of is determined by 3 m 2 x 3 18 m 2 x 4 x 3 59 it follows from 59 that for any x 3 the value of tends to 0 3 m 2 x 3 3 m r 3 60 if 0 where 0 is the known value of the cosmological constant that provides the static equilibrium position of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background 29 30 equations 52 56 describe a partial case of the nonequatorial circular orbits of the spinning particle which prove the possibility of the dynamical equilibrium position in other words the effect of hovering note that in contrast to the effect of the static equilibrium which is independent of the value and orientation of the spin of the particle the dynamical equilibrium significantly depends on its spin indeed according to 17 and 52 for sufficiently small the relation s 1 s 2 r 10 takes place which means that the spin is oriented along the radial direction with the corresponding accuracy according to 43 and 56 the velocity of the particle that is necessary for the realization of nonequatorial circular orbits with 52 and 56 corresponds to the lorentz factor 2 1 2 1 3 x 2 m 2 r 4 s 22 61 using 30 in 61 we obtain 2 1 62 it follows from 62 and 58 that 2 is highly relativistic a special situation arises when 63 indeed let us consider eq 23 at the condition 1 yx 3 1 yx 3 64 then eq 23 in notation 51 becomes 1 x 4 9 x yx 3 1 yx 3 6 1 2 x yx 2 1 3 x 1 2 x yx 2 1 yx 3 65 where according to 30 and 34 6 1 3 x 1 2 1 yx 3 3 2 66 it easy to check that eq 65 at condition 63 is satisfied if and only if y 1 x 3 6 x 3 1 3 x 67 in the linear approximation in note that condition 64 is satisfied at 63 66 and 67 after 63 67 and 47 the value 2 is close to 1 that corresponds to a low velocity of the particle and 2 1 with 0 for any fixed we want to emphasize that eqs 52 59 are valid for x 3 i e r 3 m it is easy to check that for x 3 eq 50 with the condition g 44 0 does not have any positive roots it means that under condition 52 any nonequatorial circular orbits in the region r 3 m are impossible further analysis shows that if sin 2 is not small in the sense of eq 52 it follows from 50 that the nonequatorial circular 11 orbits are possible both at x 3 and x 3 as an example we consider the special case when sin 2 0 5 down below 4 2 2 the case sin 2 0 5 first we note that below we take into account eq 30 in notation 51 in the case sin 2 0 5 for x 3 and g 44 0 eq 50 has a single positive root y 4 x 9 x 4 68 according to 21 the necessary value of u 3 is u 3 mm s 2 2 x 3 69 by 43 and 69 this value corresponds to the lorentz factor 2 1 1 2 70 after 24 relation 70 shows that 2 1 in the region x 3 with the condition g 44 0 eq 50 has two positive roots y 1 4 x 9 x 4 71 for 2 25 x 3 and y 2 2 x 5 x 3 72 for 2 5 x 3 in the case 71 by 21 the corresponding value of u 3 is u 3 mm s 2 2 3 x 73 whereas for 72 we have u 3 mmx 2 3 s 2 3 x 74 values 73 and 74 correspond to the lorentz factor 2 1 1 2 75 and 2 1 x 3 76 respectively it is easy to check that in cases 68 71 and 72 condition 49 is satisfied 12 let us summarize the results obtained in sects 3 and 4 first of all it is worth noticing a common feature of all possible nonequatorial circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background that are described with 48 70 75 and 76 this is that the particle must posses highly relativistic velocity with 2 proportional to 1 in order for these orbits to be possible with the only exception for orbits with a very small value of sin 2 when 2 is close to 1 secondly there is also essential distinction between different types of these orbits for the fixed sign of s 2 the direction of the orbital rotation which is determined by the sign of u 3 in the region x 3 eqs 21 73 and 74 is opposite to that in the region x 3 eqs 56 and 69 this situation is similar to the cases of the equatorial circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background that were studied in 10 where the effects of the strong spin gravity repulsion for r 3 m and the attraction for r 3 m were discussed it is appropriate to compare the circular orbits of the spinning particle in the schwarzschild de sitter background that were considered in both 10 and the present paper with the circular orbits in the minkowski spacetime which are a partial case of the known helical orbits in the coordinates x 1 r x 2 x 3 for the circular orbits in the plane 2 in the minkowski spacetime the relation between the angular velocity u 3 d ds and the single nonzero component of the particle spin vector s 2 s is u 3 mr s 2 77 this relation is valid for any orbital velocity including its very high values with r u 3 1 at the same time for the highly relativistic nonequatorial circular orbits in schwarzschild s background we have u 3 mr 6 s 2 sin 78 this relation follows from 21 for 0 at m 6 0 note that for sin 1 i e when the circular orbits go close to the equatorial plane relation 78 does not transform into relation 77 this fact is connected with different nature of the two types of the circular orbits for which eqs 77 and 78 take place in this context we draw the reader s attention to the analysis of the possibility of interpreting the highly relativistic circular orbits as corresponding to the partial case of helical orbits from sect iv in 10 5 energy on the nonequatorial circular orbits along with its velocity another important characteristic of motion of a par ticle along its orbit is the value of its energy because of the symmetry of the schwarzschild de sitter metric the mp equations demand that the energy of the spinning particle must be their constant of motion it is known that equations 1 and 2 have the killing vector t t that corresponds to the constant of motion 13 e as the particle s energy 32 33 e pt 1 2 gt s 79 where pt p 4 is the time component of the particle 4 momentum there is relation between the momentum p and the particle 4 velocity u p mu u ds ds 80 it follows from 79 and 80 at condition 3 in the coordinates chosen above x 1 r x 2 x 3 x 4 t that e mu 4 g 44 u ds 4 ds 1 2 s 14 g 44 1 81 first of all with better clarity and comparability of our results in mind let us write the expression of the energy of the spinless particle in the position of the static radius r 3 m 1 3 82 according to 81 for the spinless particle we have e mu 4 at the condition of the static position u 1 0 u 2 0 u 3 0 taking into account the relation u u 1 for metric 8 we write u 4 g 44 1 2 83 inserting the value r from 82 into the expression for g 44 which follows from 8 we obtain g 44 1 3 m r 1 84 and then e m 1 3 m r 1 2 85 taking into account 5 6 17 and 21 after direct calculations from 81 we obtain the expression of the energy of the spinning particle on the nonequatorial circular orbits that were considered in sect 4 e m 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 1 1 1 r 3 3 m 2 1 2 k 86 where k m 6 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 2 1 r 3 3 m 1 r 3 3 m 2 1 2 14 m r 4 9 m r r 3 3 m 1 3 m r 1 1 2 m r r 2 3 1 1 and is determined in 34 let us estimate the energy for the case of the orbits with sin 2 it follows from 86 that e m 1 3 m r 1 2 1 3 m r 2 1 1 2 87 as it can easy be seen the right hand side of 87 is always less than that of 85 and tends to it when 0 at fixed whereas when it follows from 87 that e m 1 3 m r 1 2 1 3 m r 2 1 2 1 4 88 note that according to 62 the case of with 1 corresponds to the highly relativistic circular orbits with 2 1 and energy 88 proportional to 1 in the case of sin 2 0 5 with r 3 m it follows from 86 that the value of the energy which corresponds to 68 is e 21 4 1 3 x m 89 whereas for sin 2 0 5 with r 3 m from 86 we find the values of the energy that correspond to 71 and 72 in the form e 21 4 3 x 1 m 90 and e 2 x 3 3 4 3 x 1 3 2 m 91 respectively according to 70 75 and 76 all above mentioned values of the energy are proportional to 1 6 conclusions the role of the constant in cosmology has been made by numerous researchers a pivotal point of their investigations at the same time it is important to study the effects of on an individual particle in particular in the context of reaction of highly relativistic fermions on gravitational fields 34 in the classical nonquantum approximation an appropriate instrument for studying the spin gravity coupling are the mp equations in the presented paper we study the effects of the dynamic equilibrium hovering of the spinning particle relative to the gravitational source of the schwarzschild de 15 sitter background using the mp equations the analytical solutions of these equa tions that describe the nonequatorial circular orbits are obtained it is shown that such orbits exist in both regions r 3 m and r 3 m but at the fixed orientation of the spin of the particle the directions of its orbital motion are different for all possible nonequatorial circular orbits in the region r 3 m the velocity of the par ticle is highly relativistic the similar property takes place in the region r 3 m apart from the partial case of the orbits with a small value of sin the energy of the spinning particle on highly relativistic nonequatorial circular orbits is proportional to 1 while the energy of the spinless particle which moves with a highly relativistic velocity along any arbitrary orbit according to the geodesic equations is proportional to it means that the contribution of the spin gravity coupling to the energy of the spinning particle is great the obtained data concerning the highly relativistic circular orbits in the schwarz schild de sitter background provide a good starting point for further analysis of more complicated types of motions of spinning particles which can be used to build effec tive models of astrophysical processes involving highly relativistic particles 16 bibliography 1
