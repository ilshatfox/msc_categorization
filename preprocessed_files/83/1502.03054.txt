abstract a conventional general electromagnetic force definition has been widely used to analyze radiation forces in dielectric media in published research works however in this paper we would like to indicate that this conventional force definition is flawed keywords electromagnetic force on medium light momentum in medium pacs 42 50 wk 03 50 de 42 25 p in a recent paper 1 brevik and ellingsen proposed a novel idea to experimentally measure the time dependent abraham force which is a component of the conventional general elec tromagnetic em force definition 2 however in this paper we would like to indicate that this general em force definition itself is flawed the conventional general em force definition namely the expression of the force exerted by an em field on a unit volume of isotropic dielectric material is given by 2 f f am f a 1 where fam is the abraham minkowski term force and fa is the abraham term force 1 note for a uniform medium eq 1 is the same as the one given in 3 for a non magnetic medium relative permeability r 1 without any sources fam and fa are as shown by brevik and ellingsen 1 4 given by f am 1 2 0 e 2 n 2 d 2 f a n 2 d 1 c 2 t e h 3 where 0 is the vacuum permittivity constant nd r r 1 2 is the refractive index with r the relative permittivity and c is the vacuum light speed in the idea proposed by brevik and ellingsen the dielectric medium is assumed to be uniform nd 0 and thus fam 0 holds f fam fa fa is thought to form possibly measur able abraham radiation torque in a micrometer sized dielectric tel 1 203 893 2084 email address changbiao wang yahoo com changbiao wang 1 as indicated by stratton if there is any deformation in the dielectric ma terial eq 1 is manifestly incorrect because it does not include the forces associated with the material deformation 2 however eq 1 is correct for the widely used physical model of uniform isotropic medium such as the one used in the work by brevik and ellingsen 1 because the uniform material is rigid and no deformation is involved in other words in the stratton s sense eq 1 is the general em force definition in a rigid isotropic medium spherical resonator operating at the whispering gallery mode 1 unfortunately as shown below this general em force def inition f fam fa itself is flawed in principle the correctness of f fam fa as a general em force definition cannot be legitimately affirmed by enumerating specific examples no matter how many however the correct ness can be directly negated by finding specific examples even only one in the following such a specific example is given to show why the conventional em force definition f fam fa is flawed an electromagnetic plane wave although not practical is a simplest strict solution of maxwell equations and it is often used to explore most fundamental physics for example ein stein used a plane wave to develop his special theory of relativ ity and derived the well known relativistic doppler formula in free space 5 thus if the general force definition f fam fa is correct it must withstand the test of a monochromatic plane wave in a non dispersive lossless non conducting isotropic uniform medium suppose that the em fields are given by e b d h e 0 b 0 d 0 h 0 cos for the plane wave where e 0 b 0 d 0 and h 0 are the constant amplitude vectors and t kw x is the phase function with the frequency and kw the wave vector since the medium is uniform fam 0 holds and the general em force f fam fa is reduced to f f a n 2 d 1 c 2 t e h 4 from maxwell equations the momentum conservation equa tion is given by t e h c 2 t a 5 where the stress tensor t a is given by t a 2 ph ed hb i 1 2 d e b h 6 preprint submitted to optik march 23 2022 http arxiv org abs 1502 03054 v 3 with ph 1 nd the absolute phase velocity normalized to the light speed c and i the unit tensor inserting e h e 0 h 0 cos 2 into eq 4 we indeed have f fa 0 holding except for those discrete points thus f 0 looks like a force but that is not true this can be seen from the following analysis inserting eq 5 into eq 4 we have f n 2 d 1 t a 0 from eq 6 we know that t a cos 2 is a pure travelling wave stress tensor and thus the abraham momentums flowing into and out from a differential box are usually different result ing in t a 0 f 0 from this we can see that f 0 is re sulting from the attribution of the pure travelling wave of ten sor t a this pure travelling wave attribute will not produce any force effect on the medium 2 3 this phenomenon can be clearly understood through einstein s light quantum hypothe sis photons are the carriers of light momentum and energy since the dielectric medium is assumed to be a non dispersive lossless isotropic uniform medium all the photons move uni formly at the dielectric light speed c nd and they do not have any momentum exchanges with the medium since f fam fa fa 0 does not represent a force for a plane wave f fam fa cannot pass the plane wave test and f fam fa as a general em force definition is flawed un fortunately this flawed em force definition is widely accepted in the community 1 4 6 7 8 and it is argued that the fa term simply fluctuates out when averaged over an optical period in a stationary beam but it is in principle measurable 6 in summary we have shown that the conventional general em force definition f fam fa is flawed specifically speak ing the abraham term fa n 2 d 1 t e h c 2 is not a physical em force at all for a plane wave it is interesting to point out that the conclusion obtained in the present paper is completely consistent with that obtained from analysis of dielectric einstein box thought experiment which states that the momentum transfer from the light pulse to the box only takes place on the vacuum medium interface while the pulse edges located inside the uniform medium do not have any contributions to momentum transfer 9 this conclusion is also consistent with the recent assertion by ramos and coworkers that there is no reason to assume the existence of the abraham term force 10 appendix a abraham momentum conservation equation isotropic medium is a special case of anisotropic media be low we will show that eq 5 is also valid for an anisotropic 2 that t a 0 is an attribution of pure travelling wave of tensor t a can be better understood from the free space case where there is no dielectric medium but t a 0 holds 3 one might argue that to calculate the total force on a material differential box the bound surface charge on the box boundaries needs to be considered even if it is embedded within the surrounding material however according to the uniform medium model used in the paper no sources are assumed and the maxwell equation d 0 r e 0 holds where d 0 e p with p the electric polarization resulting in p 0 namely no polarized charge or bound surface charge on the differential box boundaries and thus there is no additional surface charge caused force medium mathematical statement if a plane wave propagates in a lossless non dispersive non conducting uniform anisotropic medium the abraham momentum conservation equation can be written as 11 4 t e h c 2 t a a 1 where the abraham stress tensor is given by t a 2 ph ed hb i 1 2 d e b h a 2 in abraham theory e h c 2 is defined as em momen tum density thus eq a 1 means that in unit time the total em momentum flowing into a differential box is equal to the increase of the em momentum in the box proof for a monochromatic plane wave with a phase function of t kw x maxwell equations are simplified into b kw e d kw h a 3 kw b 0 kw d 0 a 4 where the em fields are given by e b d h e 0 b 0 d 0 h 0 cos with e 0 b 0 d 0 and h 0 the real constant vectors the frequency and the wave vector kw are real because the medium is assumed to be non conducting and lossless from eq a 3 we have d b d e kw a 5 by making cross products of kw b kw e and kw d kw h from eq a 3 with vector identity a b c a c b a b c taken into account we have e n e n vph b a 6 h n h n vph d a 7 where n kw kw is the unit wave vector and vph n kw is the phase velocity the refractive index for anisotropic me dia is defined as nd kw c with c the vacuum light speed and thus the phase velocity also can be written as vph n c nd by making inner products of h b kw e and e d kw h from eq a 3 with h kw e e kw h taken into account we obtain e d b h 4 one might argue that eq 5 or eq a 1 is incorrect and it should be replaced by t d t e h c 2 n 2 d 1 e h c 2 according to the review paper by brevik 12 however this is apparently wrong because t e h c 2 and n 2 d 1 e h c 2 have different physical dimensions as we know 20 kilograms 5 meters usually does not produce any physical meanings because kilogram and meter are of different physical dimensions 2 from eqs a 6 and a 7 and eq a 5 we obtain e h c 2 2 ph cos 2 kw e 0 d 0 kw h 0 b 0 d 0 e 0 kw a 8 where ph vph c is the normalized phase velocity with the help of ab a b a b we obtain ed hb 2 cos sin kw e 0 d 0 kw h 0 b 0 a 9 by use of d kw 0 from eq a 4 b h e d and a b c a c b a b c we have i 1 2 d e b h 2 cos sin d 0 e 0 kw a 10 inserting eqs a 8 a 9 and a 10 into eq a 1 we find the left and right hand sides of eq a 1 are equal thus eq a 1 is confirmed references 1 i brevik and s ellingsen possibility of measuring the abraham force using whispering gallery modes phys rev a 81 063830 2010 2 j a stratton
