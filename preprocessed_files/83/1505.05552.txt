of mathematics rutgers the state university of new jersey piscataway nj usa miki math rutgers edu shadi math rutgers edu version of may 10 2015 revised version abstract the results of a study of dirac s hamiltonian for a point electron in the zero gravity kerr newman spacetime are reported here zero gravity means g 0 where g is newton s constant of universal gravitation and the limit is effected in the boyer lindquist coordinate chart of the maximal analytically extended topologically nontrivial kerr newman spacetime in a nutshell the results are the essential self adjointness of the dirac hamiltonian the reflection symmetry about zero of its spectrum the location of the essential spectrum exhibiting a gap about zero and under two smallness assumptions on some parameters the existence of a point spectrum in this gap corresponding to bound states of dirac s point electron in the electromagnetic field of the zero g kerr newman ring singularity the symmetry result of the spectrum extends to dirac s hamiltonian for a point electron in a generalization of the zero g kerr newman spacetime with different ratio of electric monopole to magnetic dipole moment the results are discussed in the context of the general relativistic hydrogen problem also some interesting projects for further inquiry are listed in the last section 1 introduction there are many studies of dirac s wave equation on curved background spacetimes see e g 42 36 10 14 15 39 5 16 53 6 8 51 52 4 20 21 22 23 37 13 the papers 39 6 8 51 52 2 3 4 45 20 21 22 23 in particular deal with dirac s equation on some member of the kerr newman family of spacetimes however to the best of our knowledge nobody has yet investigated dirac s equation on the entire maximal analytically extended topologically nontrivial kerr newman spacetime such an investigation faces many conceptual and technical obstacles but it becomes feasible in a zero gravity limit which preserves the nontrivial topology of the kerr newman spacetime and its associated electromagnetic structures in this limit one can rigorously study these general relativistic effects on the dirac hamiltonian separated from and not obscured by those caused by general relativistic gravity the results of such a zero gravity investigation 47 31 are reported here readers whose expertise includes hyperbolic partial differential equations on nontrivial background space times and who right away want to find out about the results that we have obtained may now want to jump to the technical section 3 readers with expertise elsewhere in mathematical physics may find the few intro ductory lines written above hardly motivating enough to read on however fortunately a study of dirac s equation on a zero gravity kerr newman spacetime can be motivated in at least two different other ways one of which we are going to elaborate on in the next section there we discuss the perplexing problem of the general relativistic hydrogen spectrum which ought to be interesting to most mathematical quantum this is an expanded version of the talk titled the dirac equation and the kerr newman spacetime given by the first author at the quantum mathematical physics conference regensburg 2014 2 physicists 1 yet another way to motivate our study which is even more intriguing but was not yet ready for public announcement at the time of the regensburg conference and is therefore only briefly mentioned here in the last section has meanwhile been made public in our paper 32 our results are stated informally in the context of the general relativistic hydrogen problem at the end of the next section while the precise statements and some technical details are given in section 3 in section 4 we list open questions left unanswered by our study and we indicate the key idea of 32 2 on the general relativistic hydrogen spectrum hydrogen has played a crucial role in the development of the quantum theory of atomic spectra and pre sumably this simplest of the chemical atoms will continue to play an important role in the ongoing efforts to find a more satisfactory theory for instance one that does not rely on artificial uv cutoffs etc yet we do not have to venture into the realm of quantum field theory or quantum gravity to encounter perplexing issues that await clarification we simply ask for a general relativistic counterpart of the special relativistic spectrum of the quantum mechanical dirac hamiltonian for an electron modeled as a point charge in the electromagnetic field of a proton modeled either as a point or spherical charge or as a combination of electric charge plus current distribution to account also for the proton s magnetic dipole field since gravity is very weak one would expect the general relativistic dirac point spectrum to differ from sommerfeld s fine structure formula only by the tiniest amounts and in particular to be computable perturbatively using new ton s constant of universal gravitation g as expansion parameter but if that is indeed what one expects then one will be in for a surprise 2 1 the coulomb approximation in this subsection only the electric field of the proton is considered to have a reference point we begin by recalling the spectral results of the familiar textbook problem which is dirac s equation for a point electron in flat minkowski spacetime equipped with a proton modeled as a point charge having straight worldline in the rest frame of this model proton the electron experiences only the electrostatic coulomb field of the point charge subsequently we turn to the general relativistic version of this problem 2 1 1 the special relativistic spectrum the pertinent dirac hamiltonian with domain 2 c c r 3 0 4 is essentially self adjoint on l 2 r 3 0 4 with spectrum ac pp the absolutely continuous part of which is given by ac m m 1 where m is the empirical mass of the electron while the discrete here equal to the pure point part is given by sommerfeld s famous fine structure formula pp mc 2 1 2 s n 2 2 s 2 1 2 n 1 1 n mc 2 1 2 s 2 n 2 n n mc 2 o 4 s 2 where j 1 2 with j 1 2 n 1 2 being nowadays total angular momentum quantum number 3 in 2 the expansion of the discrete spectrum in powers of sommerfeld s fine structure constant s e 2 c 1 we are not suggesting that experimental physicists should worry about this academic problem for the empirically relevant problem to estimate the influence of say earth s gravitational field on the spectrum of hydrogen in the lab see papapetrou 40 2 we follow the notation of lieb and loss 34 thus c c r 3 0 denotes functions which are compactly supported away from the origin in r 3 3 for a modern semi classical approach that produces these quantum numbers see 30 3 1 137 036 reminds us that except for the constant shift 4 by the electron s rest energy mc 2 special relativity only makes tiny correctionsmc 2 o 4 s to the born oppenheimer approximationmp of bohr s energy spectrum bohr pp c 2 2 s 2 n 2 n n 3 mmp m mp is the reduced mass of the hydrogen atom so m as mp 2 1 2 the dirac electron in reissner nordstro m spacetime we next switch on g and ask for the general relativistic spectrum of a test electron in the reissner nordstro m electromagnetic spacetime of a point proton this spacetime is a spherically symmetric eventually in an open neighborhood of spacelike infinity static charged solution of the einstein maxwell equations see below having a metric g with line element ds 2 g g dx dx given by ds 2 g f r c 2 dt 2 f r 1 dr 2 r 2 d 2 sin 2 d 2 4 f r 1 2 gmp c 2 r ge 2 c 4 r 2 5 here t r are schwarzschild type coordinates which asymptotically near spacelike infinity become just the spherical coordinates of minkowski spacetime obtained by setting f r 1 in the above metric for the empirical values of mp and e one has gm 2 p e 2 1 so this spacetime is then static everywhere and covered by a single chart of t r coordinates exhibiting a timelike naked singularity 5 at r 0 in the naked singularity sector gm 2 p e 2 recall that the empirical proton s mass charge pair belongs in this sector one is confronted with the perhaps unexpected result that the dirac hamiltonian is not essentially self adjoint any general relativist who abhors naked singularities will presumably feel vindicated by this result yet as shown in 16 5 7 there exists a one parameter family of self adjoint extensions of the dirac operator with domain c c r 3 0 4 which commute with the angular momentum operator and all of these have an absolutely continuous spectrum given by ac mc 2 mc 2 6 furthermore cohen and powers 16 show that any pure point spectrum can only be located inside the gap of the continuum unfortunately cohen and powers merely state that their preliminary studies indicate the existence of eigenvalues and we are not aware of any work that has actually shown the existence of eigenvalues for any of the self adjoint extensions of the formal dirac operator on the naked reissner nordstro m spacetime 6 remark 2 1 one may also want to replace mp by other positive values in particular by md 2 mp to study the deuterium spectrum and by mt 3 mp to study the tritium spectrum these choices leave one in the naked singularity sector of the reissner nordstro m spacetimes 4 the additive constant mc 2 drops out in the calculation of rydberg s empirical formula for the frequencies of the emitted absorbed radiation which are proportional to the differences of the discrete energy eigenvalues 5 this well known naked singularity is usually not considered to be a counterexample of the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis based on the following reasoning paraphrasing freeman dyson general relativity is a classical physical theory which applies only to physics in the large e g astrophysical and cosmic scales not to atomic physics and so since cosmic bodies of mass m and charge q must have a ratio gm 2 q 2 1 the reissner nordstro m spacetime of such a body assumed spherical when collapsed exhibits a black hole not a naked singularity while we agree that cosmic bodies in mechanical virial equilibrium must have a ratio gm 2 q 2 1 we don t see why the successful applications of general relativity theory at astrophysical and cosmic scales would imply that general relativity cannot be successfully applied at atomic or even sub atomic scales where typically gm 2 e 2 1 6 interestingly enough though belgiorno martellini baldicchi 7 proved the existence of bound states of a dirac point electron equipped with an anomalous magnetic moment in the reissner nordstro m spacetime with naked singularity provided the anomalous magnetic moment is large enough in that case the dirac hamiltonian is essentially self adjoint 4 while the general relativistic hydrogen deuterium and tritium problems formulated with the reissner nordstro m spacetime for an electrostatic point proton inevitably lead to the naked singularity sector math ematical physicists have also studied a whole family of hydrogenic problems with other possible positive mass values m in place of mp when gm 2 e 2 the analytical extension of the outer reissner nordstro m spacetime will feature the event horizon of a black hole behind which lurks the timelike singularity more over when gm 2 e 2 then there exists yet another inner horizon between the timelike singularity and the event horizon and the region between this and the event horizon is not static furthermore the maximal analytical extension features multiple copies of these spacetime patches which to some extent are causally separated by cauchy horizons for the black hole sector gm 2 e 2 of parameter space cohen and powers 16 showed that the dirac hamiltonian is essentially self adjoint on the set of c bispinor valued functions which are compactly sup ported outside the event horizon but its spectrum is the whole real line and the pure point spectrum is empty the problem was picked up again by belgiorno 5 and by finster et al 19 who also proved the absence of bound states supported outside the outer event horizon in the reissner nordstro m black hole spacetime the latter authors considered also bispinor wave functions which are supported on both sides of the event horizon in particular they also showed that in the extreme case gm 2 e 2 any bound state must be supported entirely behind the event horizon an interesting open question is whether in the subextreme black hole sector gm 2 e 2 any bound state of a self adjoint dirac operator must be supported entirely inside the event horizon now according to the mainstream view of relativists only the black hole sector of a spacetime family is physically relevant and for physicists taking the for a long time also mainstream positivistic view only the part outside of the black hole s event horizon is of concern to physics this combination of viewpoints thus forces one to conclude that in such a physical reissner nordstro m spacetime there are no bound states of a dirac point electron without anomalous magnetic moment but positivism is just a form of philosophy not universally shared by all physicists and so if with werner israel one believes as we do that general relativity makes statements about the physics inside the event horizon of a black hole and explores mathematically what it says the physics is then bound states of a dirac point electron without anomalous magnetic moment may conceivably exist in a physical reissner nordstro m black hole spacetime namely supported inside the event horizon in the same vein we may as well ignore the censorship hypothesis for the naked singularity spacetimes and worry about whether bound states of a dirac point electron without anomalous magnetic moment exist in a reissner nordstro m spacetime with naked singularity in either case their existence would yet have to be proved but one thing seems clear none of these putative point spectra can be obtained perturbatively from sommerfeld s fine structure spectrum by switching on g in particular the black hole point spectrum would presumably vanish as g 0 because the black hole itself vanishes in this limit and so bear no resemblance to sommerfeld s fine structure spectrum as g 0 and whether any part of any of the hypothetical point spectra for the naked singularity sector will resemble sommerfeld s fine structure spectrum as g 0 is anybody s best guess hopefully someone will work it out eventually remark 2 2 the putative failure of g perturbative reasoning can be traced to the non integrable elec tromagnetic stresses and energy density which are the source terms for the ricci curvature tensor of the reissner nordstro m spacetime this is the old problem of infinite electrostatic self energy of a point charge which because of the equivalence of energy and mass becomes its infinite self mass problem in a special relativistic setting it assigns an infinite inertia to a point charge which hounds one when trying to formulate a dynamical theory of charged point particle motion beyond the test particle approximation but in a general relativistic setting the gravitational coupling leads in addition to very strong curvature singularities of the spacetime generated by the non integrable self energy etc densities interestingly enough for the remark ably accurate computation of the special relativistic quantum mechanical point spectrum of hydrogen in the born oppenheimer approximation only the electrostatic interaction energy of a point proton and a point electron enters the dirac equation through the usual minimal coupling i e both self energy terms are ignored these self energy terms are also ignored in the electromagnetic minimal coupling term of dirac s equation on a reissner nordstro m spacetime but the electric self energy density of the point proton enters 5 the general relativistic dirac equation of a point electron in the reissner nordstro m spacetime also through the covariant derivatives of the spacetime for this non integrable density is a curvature source term in the einstein maxwell equations so one may contemplate purging it too this leads to the vacuum einstein equations and so instead of the reissner nordstro m spacetime one would obtain the schwarzschild space time see 27 for a recent pedagogical treatment yet to retain the electrostatic interaction between point electron and proton in the dirac hamiltonian consistent with this approximation one would next have to solve the maxwell equations with a point proton as source in a schwarzschild background spacetime with the point proton located in its center if this makes any sense at all and then treat the dirac point electron as a test charge experiencing the uncharged background metric as well as the electric field of the point proton imposed on that background metric we are not aware of any such study furthermore we are not sure whether a mathematically well posed formulation of the indicated classical electrical problem is feasible because the schwarzschild black hole spacetime is not static inside its event horizon and its singularity is spacelike so that its center is a spacelike line not a point raising the question where exactly to place the point proton yet it may be mathematically interesting to sort this out we close this subsection by emphasizing that the just contemplated removal of the self energy density of the point proton from the spacetime equations is a rather contrived step and not easily justifiable if at all in contrast to the readily vindicated omission of the infinite self interaction terms from the electromagnetic energy in the hamiltonian it has the flavor of a last desperate attempt to cling to the point proton approximation when setting up the general relativistic hydrogen problem for a dirac test electron interacting with it since a physical proton is a compound particle with a finite size the mathematical catastrophes associated with the point proton approximation may well be dismissed as the result of an oversimplification and declared not a cause for real concern indeed since it is known that finite size proton models remove the special relativistic catastrophe of the hydrogenic problem at z 1 s 137 036 26 it is not difficult to convince oneself that a finite size model of a spherical proton avoids the general relativistic spacetime singularity of the reissner nordstro m spacetime of a point proton although this introduces the problem of having to make assumptions about the structure of the proton the tiny size of the proton suggests that all possible spherical finite size models should yield the same leading order corrections in terms of powers of g to the special relativistic spectrum for example assuming a model that produces a spherical surface charge and zero binding energy one would obtain a spacetime which coincides with the reissner nordstro m spacetime for r rp and which is flat for r rp here rp is the solution to mpc 2 e 2 r 0 viz rp e 2 mpc 2 which is 1836 times smaller than the so called classical electron radius e 2 mc 2 where m is the electron s empirical mass the spacetime is not smooth at rp but its singularity corresponds to just a jump in its ricci curvatures so a g perturbative calculation of the dirac spectrum should be feasible 2 2 the hyperfine structure so far we have assumed that the proton has only an electric charge however the physical proton appears to also possess a magnetic dipole moment the interaction of the electron spin magnetic moment with this magnetic moment of the proton accounts for a hyperfine structure of the hydrogen spectrum as computed with quantum mechanical perturbation theory unfortunately assuming a point proton carrying an electric charge and magnetic dipole is qm non perturbatively catastrophic even in a non relativistic setting a qm non perturbative calculation requires a model of a finite size proton pekeris 41 proposed that as a substitute for such a finite size model of the proton with charge and currents one may want to take the well known electromagnetic kerr newman spacetime family with its ring singularity and electromagnetic fields which near spacelike infinity approach an electric monopole and a magnetic dipole structure of course this proposal should not be taken too seriously in the sense that the inner structure of the proton is hardly reproduced correctly by the kerr newman solution yet it is certainly interesting to investigate dirac s equation for a point electron in the kerr newman spacetime with its parameters matched to those of the proton 6 2 2 1 the dirac electron in the kerr newman spacetime with g 0 in the spirit of the previous subsection we now inquire into the general relativistic spectrum of a test electron in the electromagnetic kerr newman spacetime 38 pretending that its electromagnetic fields represent those of an extended proton with charge and magnetic moment we do not display its metric the line element of which is much more complicated than 4 a special case will be exhibited further below though but only mention that it has three parameters charge q here chosen to equal e adm mass m here chosen to equal mp and adm angular momentum per unit mass a here to be chosen such that ea equals the magnetic moment of the proton this puts us into the naked singularity sector but as before we give a mini survey of both naked singularity sector and black hole sector cf 11 the open black hole sector gm 2 q 2 a 2 c 4 g was studied in 6 20 21 52 and no bound states of the dirac equation were found for its domain supported either outside the event horizon or on both sides of it 7 the latter situation was studied only in 20 21 involving also a matching across the cauchy horizon lurking inside the event horizon interestingly in the extreme case gm 2 q 2 a 2 c 4 g the boundary of the open kerr newman black hole sector which belongs to the black hole sector too bound states supported outside the event horizon exist for a sequence of special m values 52 in the naked singularity sector gm 2 q 2 a 2 c 4 g the whole spacetime manifold is causally vicious and we are not aware of any study of the dirac equation on it since in this subsection we inquire into whether a g deformation of the sommerfeld spectrum with hyperfine corrections can be computed by studying dirac s equation on the kerr newman spacetime the outcome is somewhat disappointing the proton parameters m mp and q e belong to the naked singularity sector of the kerr newman family and nothing seems to be known about the dirac equation on it on the other hand since the proton mass does not enter the sommerfeld fine structure formula one may still ask about the g dependence of the discrete dirac spectra in the extreme kerr newman black hole spacetime and whether they resemble the sommerfeld spectrum with hyperfine corrections as g 0 unfortunately so far not much is known about these point spectra either but someone should work out the answer eventually 2 2 2 the dirac electron in the zero g kerr newman spacetime the inquiry started in the previous subsection suggests a closely related spectral question about the dirac operator and the kerr newman spacetime one which avoids all the causal pathologies associated with the latter namely since the canonical in the sense of geroch 25 zero g limit of the maximal analytically ex tended kerr newman spacetime zgkn does not yield the minkowski spacetime but a flat yet topologically nontrivial spacetime with a ring singularity 47 it is an interesting question whether the dirac spectrum for an electron in this spacetime bears any resemblance to the sommerfeld spectrum with hyperfine corrections the apparently first investigation in this direction is by pekeris 41 however following israel 28 he works with the zero g limit of a single sheet of the kerr newman electromagnetic spacetime which is a minkowski spacetime decorated with truncated multi valued harmonic fields fig 1 produced by j gair and published in 24 and in 35 by d lynden bell and which is reproduced here with permission from both d lynden bell and j gair shows a drawing of electric top and magnetic bottom lines of force in a planar section containing the axis of symmetry of a spacelike snapshot the ring singularity pierces the drawing at the two singular points where all the field lines seem to emerge from respectively end at if one chooses to interpret the zero g limit of the spacetime in this single sheeted way then one is forced to interpret the inevitable jump discontinuities in the electromagnetic fields as being caused by ultra singular two dimensional sources a geometrically distinguished choice of such a source is the ultra singular disc 7 the addition of a positive cosmological constant 8 has not lead to bound states either 7 figure 1 from 24 and 35 electric top and magnetic bottom lines of force in a euclidean plane containing the z axis of symmetry of a constant t section of a single sheet of the zgkn spacetime note that in these plots r denotes a cartesian coordinate z and not the boyer lindquist coordinate the orientation of the lines indicated by the arrows reverses across the straight line segment between the two singular points which are located at r a z a 1 0 and r a z a 1 0 associated with this reversal is a jump discontinuity in the magnitudes of the respective field strengths when one crosses that line segment source spanned by the ring singularity studied by 28 41 24 35 and 29 these disc type charge and current densities are not integrable but are magically compensated in parts by oppositely infinite charges and currents on the ring in such a manner that the finite charge of the kerr newman fields is produced by contrast from the perspective of a two sheeted interpretation of the zgkn spacetime and its electro magnetic fields the jump discontinuities across the line spanned by the two singular points seen in fig 1 are artifacts of the single sheeted drawing of the multi valued harmonic functions with branch cut placed arbi trarily at the disc spanned by the singular ring namely the sources of the fields living on the double sheeted maximal analytically extended zero g kerr newman spacetime are finite sesqui poles concentrated in the singular ring see 47 thus the dirac equation on this maximal analytically extended zero g kerr newman spacetime can be studied in an orderly manner we have begun such a investigation 31 32 of dirac s equation on the maximal analytically extended zero g kerr newman spacetime and in the following we report on it in the zero g limit of the maximal analytically extended kerr newman spacetime with metric expressed in boyer lindquist coordinates t r one obtains a flat double sheeted spacetimem with zipoy topology 54 having a metric g with line element ds 2 g g dx dx given by ds 2 g c 2 dt 2 r 2 a 2 cos 2 r 2 a 2 dr 2 r 2 a 2 d 2 r 2 a 2 sin 2 d 2 7 here t r 0 0 2 by n we denote any of the spacelike t const slices of the zgkn spacetime m note that n is independent of t the zgkn electromagnetic field is an 8 exact two form f da with a r r 2 a 2 cos 2 qcdt qa sin 2 d 8 we have studied dirac s hamiltonian for an electron in the above electromagnetic spacetime an informal summary of our main results follows the dirac operator with domain c c n c 4 is essentially self adjoint its unique self adjoint extension has a symmetric spectrum about zero its continuous spectrum is given by ac mc 2 mc 2 its discrete spectrum is non empty if 2 a mc 1 and also eq c 2 a mc 1 2 a mc and then it is located inside mc 2 mc 2 if the limit a 0 of the discrete spectrum converges to the spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian on the a 0 electromagnetic spacetime it is a union of a positive and a negative sommerfeld fine structure spectrum remark 2 3 our sufficient conditions for the existence of the discrete spectrum presumably are not nec essary conditions in any event for our inquiry into general relativistic effects on the hydrogen spectrum we use the empirical magnetic moment of the proton and find 2 a 10 3 mc in rough agreement with the empirical size of the proton cf 41 so the first sufficient smallness condition is fulfilled note that it demands that the ring diameter 2 a is smaller than the electron s compton wavelength mc and for q e the l h s of the second sufficient smallness condition becomes s 1 137 036 so the second condition is fulfilled then too 3 a zero g kerr newman born oppenheimer hydrogen atom in this section we present the essentials of our study we begin by describing the zero g kerr newman spacetime and its electromagnetic field in more detail then we formulate dirac s equation on it in its standard format using cartan s frame method which allows us to define the dirac hamiltonian on a static spacelike slice of the zgkn spacetime finally we state precisely our results together with a few remarks regarding our proofs 3 1 the zero gravity spacetimes and their electromagnetic fields 3 1 1 the einstein maxwell equations an electromagnetic spacetime is a triple m g f where m g is a four dimensional lorentz manifold with metric g and f da is the faraday tensor of the electromagnetic field on m the einstein maxwell equations for an electromagnetic spacetime are a system of pde given by einstein s field equations r g 1 2 rg 8 g c 4 t f g 9 with 0 1 2 3 and 0 1 2 3 and where t f g 1 4 f f g f f 10 is the energy density momentum density stress tensor of the electromagnetic field f the bianchi iden tities r g 1 2 rg 0 imply the conservation laws t 0 11 9 which in turn imply that the maxwell tensor m f satisfies dm 0 here is the hodge dual operator recall that df 0 because dda 0 incidentally the einstein maxwell equations simplify somewhat due to the vanishing trace t f g 0 which implies r 0 3 1 2 the zero g kerr newman spacetime and its electromagnetic field the kerr newman spacetime with its electromagnetic field is an axisymmetric asymptotically flat and stationary three parameter solution of the above einstein maxwell equations see 38 11 in the limit g 0 their spacetime metric becomes 7 solving einstein s vacuum equations r 0 usually obtained by setting t 0 while their electromagnetic field f da with a given by 8 solves the zero g maxwell equations which in our compact notation look unchanged on the limiting zero g spacetime the zgkn spacetime is readily illustrated as follows since it is static it suffices to discuss a constant t snapshot n whose metric is given by the space part of 7 with r oblate spheroidal coordinates since n is axisymmetric it furthermore suffices to discuss a constant section of n shown in fig 2 are the ring singularity and the part r 1 1 0 of such a constant azimuth section of n slightly curved to separate the sheets for the purpose of visualization the coordinate grid on the sheets shows the constant lines hyperbolas and constant r lines ellipses solutions to einstein s equations having this two sheeted topology were first discovered by zipoy 54 for which reason we speak of zipoy topology figure 2 an illustration of the zipoy topology to illustrate the zgkn electromagnetic field we consider e ib i t f i f where e and b are the electric and magnetic fields obtaining e ib d q r ia cos 12 they were discovered in this form by appell 1 who realized that these are multi valued harmonic fields on euclidean space the insight that multi valued harmonic fields become single valued on so called branched riemann spaces is due to sommerfeld 43 whose pioneering work was generalized and completed by evans 17 and his students in particular the fields e and b given in 12 are single valued harmonic fields on n moreover due to the axisymmetry the lines of force of e and b are planar curves in doubled half planes with zipoy topology which contain the axis of symmetry as an illustration of the single valuedness and smoothness except for their divergence at the ring singularity of the electromagnetic fields on the maximal analytically extended zgkn spacetime in fig 3 we show the graph of the electric potential modulated onto the constant t section of spacetime depicted in fig 2 the electric potential is positive on the upper and negative on the lower sheet diverging at the ring singularity omitted in this picture yet discernible due to the spikes in the potential and smoothly 10 criss crossing at the disc spanned by the singular ring a line in this constant t section the electric lines of force not shown in fig 3 are orthogonal to the equipotentials figure 3 graph of the electric potential modulated onto a constant t section of the zgkn spacetime the two sheets are separated and bend for purposes of visualization 3 2 relativistic quantum mechanics in zgkn spacetime 3 2 1 the general relativistic dirac equation the dirac equation for a test electron of charge e and mass m in an electromagnetic lorentz manifold is a first order system of pde for a bispinor field m g f c 4 given by i 1 c ea mc 0 13 here the a are defined by a a dx and the are 4 4 dirac matrices satisfying the fundamental identity of a clifford algebra 2 g 14 4 14 where g is the inverse matrix to g moreover denotes the covariant derivative for the metric g 3 2 2 dirac s equation in standard form while concise the above version of dirac s equation is not necessarily convenient for analytical studies it is more convenient to use cartan s frame formulation 10 which expresses the matrices in terms of the standard matrices of minkowski spacetime thus e 1 4 15 here we introduced dirac s gamma matrices satisfying 2 14 4 16 11 where diag 1 1 1 1 17 is the matrix of the minkowski metric in rectangular coordinates and we also introduced the ricci rotation coefficients defined by de e e 18 plus an anti symmetry condition in the lower two parameters moreover we introduced the orthonormal frame field e e g 19 finally we obtain dirac s equation in standard form temporarily setting 1 c e iea im 0 1 4 20 here a e a 21 3 2 3 the standard form of dirac s equation on zgkn we begin by introducing a cartan co frame 3 0 for the cotangent bundle 12 0 dt a sin 2 d 1 d 2 sin adt 2 d 3 dr 22 with the abbreviations r 2 a 2 r ia cos 23 let us denote the oblate spheroidal coordinates t r collectively by y let g denote the coefficients of the zgkn spacetime metric in oblate spheroidal coordinates i e g g y y one easily checks that written in the frame the spacetime line element is ds 2 g g dy dy 24 with respect to this frame the electromagnetic sommerfeld potential a a with a 0 q r a 1 0 a 2 0 a 3

respect to this frame on a zgk spacetime the covariant derivative part of the dirac operator can be expressed with the help of the operator o 0 l m l m 0 30 where l 1 d l l d 31 and l 1 d l l d 32 with d r t a l i a sin t csc 33 while with denoting complex conjugation m 1 2 2 c f ib 1 a 2 e id 3 1 2 r cot ia sin cot ia sin r 34 and m 1 2 2 c f ib 1 a 2 e id 3 m 35 where denotes hermitian

of the two square bracketed operators are functions of only r respectively only and the lower order term in o can be transformed away achieving exact separation for o namely setting r 1 2 log sin 38 13 it is easy to see that m l m l 39 define now the diagonal matrix d diag e e e e 40 and a new bispinor related to the original by d 41 and denoting the upper and lower components of a bispinor by 1

and left multiply the equation by the diagonal matrix d d and conclude that solves the transformed dirac equation with 1 c e iea imr 0 45 3 2 4 the dirac hamiltonian on a contant t snapshot of zgkn spacetime we now recast dirac s equation 45 for in schro dinger form i t h 46 for which we have to compute the dirac hamiltonian from 45 let matrices m be defined by e m 47 in particular m 0 0 a sin 2 48 we may thus rewrite 45 as m 0 t mk k ie a imr 49 finally restoring and c and defining h m 0 1 mk i k 1 c e a mcr 50 we arrive at 46 14 3 2 5 a hilbert space for h in order to obtain the correct inner product for the space of bispinor fields defined on the zgkn spacetime we left multiply the original dirac equation 13 by the conjugate bispinor defined as 0 51 integrate the result over a slab of spacetime and obtain the action for this equation we find s i dt t 0 d t 52 where i r is a finite interval and d t is the volume element of t n any spacelike t constant slices of zgkn using oblate spheroidal coordinates with d n 2 sin d d dr it follows that the natural inner product for bispinors on t n needs to be n 0 0 d n 2 0 0 m 2 sin d d dr 53 with m 0 0 0 e 0 0 a sin 2 54 here 2 is the second one of the three dirac alpha matrices in the weyl spinor representation k 0 k k 0 0 k k 1 2 3 55 and for notational convenience the 4 4 identity matrix has been denoted by 0 12 2 0 0 12 2 56 now let d and d with d as in 40 then we have 2 0 0 m d d dr 57 where m 0 a sin 2 58 the eigenvalues of m are 1 a sin both of which have multiplicity 2 and are positive everywhere on this space with zipoy topology note that 0 on the ring which is not part of the space time but at its boundary we may thus take the above as the definition of a positive definite inner product given by the matrix m for bispinors defined on any t const section of m a rectangular cylinder z r 0 0 2 with its natural measure m z m d d dr 59 the corresponding hilbert space is denoted by h thus h z c 4 2 m m 60 note that h is not equivalent to l 2 z whose inner product has the identity matrix in place of m we are finally ready to list our main results which are proved in 31 15 3 2 6 symmetry of the spectrum of h following the strategy of glazman in 31 we prove theorem 3 1 let any self adjoint extension of the formal dirac operator h on h be denoted by the same letter suppose e spec h then e spec h remark 3 2 we can also replace qa with i a 2 c in 8 introducing a kn anomalous magnetic moment here i is an electrical current supported by the ring singularity independently of q this changes a 0 and a 2 to a 0

winklmeier yamada 52 in 31 we prove theorem 3 3 let q e i a c let z denote z with the ring singularity r r 0 2 deleted then h with domain c c z is essentially self adjoint on h the unique self adjoint extension of h will also be denoted by h 3 2 8 the continuous spectrum of h using the chandrasekhar page toop separation of variables and an argument of weidmann 50 in 31 we prove theorem 3 4 for q e

nonempty and located in mc 2 mc 2 the end points are not included remark 3 6 in the hydrogenic problem where the proton charge e is replaced by the charge q ze of a nucleus with z 1 and the proton mass mp by the nuclear mass m 0 although this does not show in the zero g formulation of the problem of a test electron in the electromagnetic field of a nucleus a point spectrum exists in the gap of the continuum as long as z 137 036 2 a mc 1 2 a mc since our upper bound on z goes 0 as a 0 it is presumably not sharp at least not when judged against the familiar dirac bound z 137 036 for the existence of a point spectrum in the hydrogenic problem with point nuclei on minkowski spacetime we briefly indicate our strategy of proof of the point spectrum we employ the chandrasekhar page toop separation of variables ansatz t r e iet i r 1 r s 1 r 2 r s 2 r 2 r s 1 r 1 r s 2 62 16 with e mc 2 mc 2 and 2 z 0 obtaining coupled eigenvalue problems for r r 1 r 2 t and s s 1 s 2 t trad r e r

of equations the second one can be integrated once a solution to the first one is known the first equation in each pair is independent of the second one in the pair however the two first equations are still coupled through the eigenvalue parameters and need to be solved jointly there are integrability conditions combined with the chandrasekhar et al ansatz the pru fer transform yields t r r r s e i

dynamical system and treated as such with dynamical systems theory for the many details see 31 this completes the survey of our main results from 31 we have also numerically computed what we believe is the positive energy ground state for various a values a typical profile is shown in fig 4 for small a the profile is close to the known hydrogen ground state profile for a 0 in the r 0 sheet in addition a tiny exponentially decaying tail extends into the r 0 sheet this is what one would intuitively expect from a negatively charged electron in the r 0 sheet that is attracted to a small a ring singularity which appears positively charged in the r 0 sheet the likelihood of finding the electron on the negatively charged side of the ring singularity should be exponentially small interestingly by anti symmetry the negative energy ground state in the sense of having smallest absolute energy is obtained by reflection of the positive energy ground state profile at r 0 by the same kind of intuitive explanation given of the behavior of the electron in the positive energy ground state the negative energy ground state corresponds to the behavior expected rather from a positron 17 figure 4 the absolute square of the putative positive ground state vs the oblate spheroidal r coordinate 4 summary and outlook 4 1 summary motivated by the mathematical physics problem of general relativistic extensions of the sommerfeld fine structure spectrum of hydrogen in particular those including the hyper fine structure in this presentation we have addressed the dirac equation of a point electron in the zero g limit of the maximal analytically extended double sheeted kerr newman spacetime a related study has been proposed by pekeris 41 who however studied dirac s equation on a one sheeted truncation of the zgkn spacetime which comes at the price of nonintegrable proton charge and current densities concentrated in a disc 8 and raises the question of boundary conditions for the dirac bispinors at the disc cf also 24 by contrast we have found that our zgkn dirac hamiltonian is essentially self adjoint and its unique self adjoint extension has a spectrum which is symmetric about zero containing the familiar continuum mc 2 mc 2 plus under a smallness condition a discrete spectrum in the gap of the continuum for the hydrogen parameter values the smallness condition is satisfied moreover our results imply that the point spectrum converges to two anti symmetric copies of the sommerfeld spectrum when the ring radius of the zgkn spacetime vanishes if it converges to the spectrum of the zero a operator we end this summary with a disclaimer we are not advocating that the ring singularity of the double sheeted zgkn spacetime were an accurate model for a physical proton rather our zgkn born oppenheimer hydrogen atom model is merely an interesting toy model which reduces to the familiar special relativistic born oppenheimer hydrogen atom model and an antisymmetric copy thereof when a 0 and thus allows one to rigorously study non perturbatively some general relativistic a 0 effects on the quantum mechanical hydrogen spectrum such as the hyperfine structure which cannot be studied non perturbatively with the point proton model featuring an electric charge and a magnetic dipole moment 4 2 outlook our study leaves many questions unanswered but also suggests some intriguing speculations the latter were not included in the talk at regensburg 4 2 1 open questions first of all we would like to know the point spectrum of the double sheeted zgkn dirac hamiltonian in more detail and as function of the ring radius a a numerical study is currently in progress more in line with pde research into dirac s equation on general relativistic spacetimes we would like to know what happens when a dirac bispinor wave function impinges on the zgkn ring singularity in 8 for integrable yet infinitely extended astrophysical kerr newman disc sources see 33 18 particular how much of it scatters and how much will dive through the ring furthermore we would like to know what happens if the zgkn magnetic moment qa is replaced by i a 2 c so that the electromagnetic zgkn spacetime becomes a zgk spacetime decorated with an appell sommerfeld field of arbitrary charge q and current i is the dirac hamiltonian still essentially self adjoint if not are there distinguished self adjoint extensions can one characterize the spectrum of the self adjoint extension s note that if q 6 i a c then the chandrasekhar page toop ansatz to separate variables fails and one is faced with a two variable pde eigenvalue problem incidentally independent of any inquiry into the dirac equation the following question is relevant to the problem of uniqueness of the kerr newman manifold is it possible to g deform the zgk spacetime decorated with an appell sommerfeld field of charge q and current i into a solution of the einstein maxwell equations only for the kn choice qa i a 2 c thus we also would like to investigate what happens when gravity is switched back on after reviewing the enormous obstacles which are encountered in the pertinent literature on the subject we concluded that these are caused mainly by the non integrable electromagnetic self energy densities of point electron and point or ring proton as computed with the linear maxwell lorentz equations which lead to unphysical spacetime curvatures once gravity is switched on to avoid these problems we plan to study the nonlinear einstein maxwell born infeld system which promises to yield the mildest conceivable spacetime singularities 46 unfortunately their nonlinearity is formidable and progress will most likely come slowly moreover it is clear that one has to abandon the born oppenheimer approximation but the full two body problem cf 9 may still be out of reach 4 2 2 speculations as for the intriguing speculations our research also led to a completely different line of inquiry which we have embarked on in 32 namely as has been advocated by stu ckelberg 44 feynman 18 thaller 48 49 and others the puzzling spectral properties of dirac s equation interpreted quantum mechanically as again highlighted by the mysterious anti symmetry of the dirac spectrum of a point electron in the anti symmetric double sheeted zgkn spacetime suggest that dirac s equation captures the dynamics and bound states of both electron and positron yet interpreted as a quantum mechanical equation dirac s equation is a single particle equation this has suggested to us to entertain the hypothesis that particles and anti particles are merely different sides of the same medal i e forming a single meta particle with a binary structure rather than being different particles in their own right the very anti symmetric structure of the zgkn ring singularity supplies just such a binary structure which in 32 we have tentatively identified with an electron anti electron meta particle there we show that the dirac spectrum of such a zgkn ring particle in the electrostatic field of a given point charge now playing the role of the point proton with straight world line in the pertinent zgkn spacetime is determined by the same equation that we have discussed in this presentation it s the narrative that changes not the mathematics this narrative where electron and anti electron are just two different sides of the same medal is faithfully realized by the electromagnetic ring singularity of the zgkn spacetime and we ponder seriously the possibility of it having a true physical significance
