relativistic spinning particles in schwarzschild s and kerr s background which follows from the mathisson papapetrou mp equa tions are considered it is shown that dependently on the correlation of signs of the spin and the particle s orbital velocity the spin gravity coupling acts as a significant repulsive or attractive force numerical estimates for electrons protons and neutrinos in the gravitational field of black holes are presented the correspondence between the general relativistic dirac equation and mp equa tions is discussed it is stressed that for the highly relativistic motions the adequate supplementary condition for the mp equations is the mathisson pirani condition in the following it is important to study the possible role of the highly relativistic spin gravity

nonquantum spinning particle in 1 2 investigations of their so lutions for some backgrounds were started in 3 7 schwarzschild s metric was taken into account in 3 5 6 lense thirring s and melvin s metric were under consid eration in 4 and 7 correspondingly the concrete phys ical effects of spin gravity coupling on rotating body tra jectories have been studied for example it was shown that the correction in perihelion motion of the planet mercury because of its spin is negligible 3 similar re sults were obtained for other cases of spinning particle motions in the gravitational field which were considered at that time therefore it is naturally that the corre sponding statement was formulated in the known book 8 from 1973 however the same year is dated paper 9 where another supposition one can read the sim ple act of endowing a black hole with angular momen tum has led to an unexpected richness of possible phys ical phenomena it seems appropriate to ask whether endowing the test body with intrinsic spin might not also lead to surprises this paper together with 10 where the spin spin and spin orbit gravitational interac tions were considered gave the impulse for realizing our program of more detailed investigations of physical ef fects following from the mp equations we began from searching possible new analytical solutions of the ex act mathisson papapetrou equations in schwarzschild s background without the supposition that they must be close to the corresponding solutions of the geodesic equa tions that is in our calculations we did not use the approach of small corrections because of the spin to the known geodesic solutions it is known that the exact mp equations have a simple analytical solution for the radial motion with any ori ented spin in schwarzschild s background this solution describe the particle s world line which coincides with the corresponding geodesic world line other solutions of the mp equations in schwarzschild s background which de scribe the circular orbits of a particle with spin orthogo nal to the equatorial plane of its motion is known as well these solutions differ from the corresponding geodesic solutions because of the terms which describe the grav itational spin orbit interaction at the same time it is not difficult to check that the mp equations do not ad mit solutions in schwarzschild s equatorial plane with the spin non orthogonal to this plane however paper 10 inspired the question do the mp equations admit any solution which describe circular orbits of a spinning par ticle beyond the equatorial plane of schwarzschild s back ground indeed it was shown in 10 that according to the mp equations the spin spin interaction cannot main tain a spinning test particle at rest on the axis of rotation of kerr s mass nevertheless this fact does not exclude a priori an effect of particle hovering above kerr s or schwarzschild s mass due to the spin orbit interaction i e for some dynamical nor statical cases then it was shown that the mp equations admit the corresponding solutions both in the schwarzschild 11 12 and kerr backgrounds 13 which describe just the circular non equatorial orbits it is important that for realizing these orbits a spinning particle must posses the highly rela tivistic velocity relative to a source of the gravitational field late those and other results of studying the highly relativistic spinning particle motions were summarized in book 14 further development of the corresponding di rection of investigations for the last 15 years is presented in 15 23 the important point in the description of spinning par ticle motions by the mp equations is the choice of an ap propriate supplementary condition from the first steps in our investigations we chose the mathisson pirani sup plementary condition 1 24 as a basic one in this choos http arxiv org abs 1507 01696 v 1 2 ing we took into account the results of papers 25 26 if we need to describe in the proper sense just the inner rotation of the body it is necessary to use the mathisson pirani condition nevertheless in many cases when the body particle velocity is not very close to the velocity of light this condition can be substitute by the tulczyjew dixon condition with high accuracy more on this subject we write below here we present our results of the theoretical investi gations of the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling by analysis of the corresponding solutions of the mp equa tions in schwarzschild s and kerr s background natu rally from a practical point of view the situation with a macroscopic test particle moving relative to a massive body with the velocity close to the velocity of light is not realistic however the highly relativistic velocities are usual in astrophysics for elementary particles in this connection we stress the important fact in many papers 27 35 it was shown that in a certain sense the mp equa tions follow from the quantum general relativistic dirac equation 36 38 as a classical approximation ii different representations of mathisson papapetrou equations because the traditional form of the mp equations are presented above in other papers in this section we write only their non traditional forms which are convenient for further analysis of physical meaning of the corresponding solutions a mp equations through spin 3 vector for description of the particle spin by the mp equa tions in many papers both the tensor of spin s and the 4 vector of spin s are used where by definition s 1 2 gu s s u s 1 where and g are the levi civita symbol and the determinant of the metric tensor correspondingly here and in the following greek indices run 1 2 3 4 and latin indices 1 2 3 the signature of the metric is chosen units c g 1 are used that is instead of the six components s one can deal with the four components s in the term of s the mathisson pirani condition is s u 0 2 and the spin part of the mp equations takes the form ds ds s du ds u 3 i e according to the mp equations at the mathisson pirani the 4 vector of spin is fermi transported 8 for further reduction of the number of the spin compo nents which are presented explicitly in the mp equations it is possible to do another step we can operate only with the three components of the spin tensor s which con tain only the spatial indices i e sik because the three other components of this tensor by the mathisson pirani condition are expressed as si 4 uk u 4 ski 4 the useful form of the mp equation can be obtained if in stead of the spin tensor components ski the 3 component value si is introduced by definition si 1 2 u 4 g iklskl 5 where ikl is the spatial levi civita symbol the expres sion of ski through si is sik u 4 g iklsl 6 then the transport part of the mp equations can be writ ten as 14 15 m u m m u u 2 d ds g 1 2 u u u u 4 s ngp g 4 s pun g 1 2 u u u u u 4 m i gk 2 ui m kg 4 iklsl 1 2 g 1 2 u u 4 rm ik 2 uirm k 4 iklsl 0 7 where for the free indices m n and p it is necessary to put the circle combinations 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 and the fourth equation of the mp transport part can be trans formed to the form m u 4 4 u u d ds g 1 2 u u u g kui iklsl g 1 2 u u u u u 4 4

three independent equations of the spin part of the mp equations can be written as 14 21 u 4 s i 2 u 4 ui u u 4 ui sku k 3 2 sn n 4 ui u 0 9 in practical calculations for the concrete metric both analytical and numerical it is often more convenience to use the mp equation representation just through the 3 vector si in particular at a glance from 9 we see that the spin part of the mp equations becomes much simpler if the condition siu i 0 is satisfied i e when the spin is orthogonal to the particle s trajectory according to 1 and 5 there is a simple relationship between si and s si si ui u 4 s 4 10 b mp equations in comoving tetrad representation in many cases it is important to describe a physical event in different frames of reference concerning the mo tion of a spinning test particle in the gravitational field it is useful to consider the main properties of this motion from the point of view of an observer moving with the spinning particle with respect to which the representa tive point of the particle is at rest as usual the comoving frame of reference are deter mined by a set of orthogonal tetrads where 4 u and g g 11 here and in the following in contrast to the indices of the global coordinates the local indices are placed in the parenthesis is the minkowski tensor the local components of the spin 4 vector for a comov ing observer satisfy the condition s 4 0 26 concern ing the spatial components of this vector without loss in generality for convince we direct the first vector along the direction of spin that is we write s 1 6 0 s 2 0 s 3 0 s 4 0 12 the mp equations have the constant of motion s 20 s s where s 0 is the absolute value of the particle spin 26 and according to 12 s 1 s 0 by relationships 11 and 12 for the local components of the spin 3 vector we have s 1 s 1 6 0 s 2 0 s 3 0 13 then according to 10 the global components of this 3 vector are connected with its local components by the relationship 4 4 si 4 4 1 i 4 i 1 4 s 1 14 it follows from equations 9 that k 1 4 0 15 where k 1 4 are the ricci coefficients of rotation be cause these coefficients are antisymmetric in the first two indices equation 15 contains the two relationships 2 1 4 0 and 3 1 4 0 the similar third rela tionship 2 3 4 0 can be added if one need exclude the rotation of the second and the third local spatial vec tors relative to the direction of the first vector which in our consideration is connected with the spin orientation therefore we are free to put i k 4 0 16 equation 16 is the known condition of the fermi trans port for the local orthonormal vectors by direct calculations which are quite simple but rather lengthy it follows from equations 7 that m 1 4 4 s 1 r 1 4 2 3 17 m 2 4 4 s 1 r 2 4 2 3 3 4 4 2 4 4 2 3 4 18 m 3 4 4 s 1 r 3 4 2 3 2 4 4 3 4 4 2 3 4 19 here as for the spin part of the mp equations the first local spatial vector is determined by the spin orientation it is known that the value i 4 4 is the dynamical characteristic of the reference frame namely its acceler ation in the linear spin approximation instead of equations 17 19 we have the more simple equations m i 4 4 s 1 r 1 4 2 3 20 that is according to 20 the force of the spin gravity interaction as estimated by the comoving observer in the linear spin approximation is fully determined by the local components of the riemann tensor we shell an alyze expression 20 in some concrete cases of spinning particle motions in the gravitational field iii highly relativistic solutions of mp equations in schwarzschild s background we begin this section from consideration of a phys ical situation which is not connected directly with the mp equations and in a certain sense is similar to the known one in electrodynamics when the electromagnetic field of a moving electric charge is under consideration now we are interested in the gravitational field of a mov ing mass more exactly let us analyze the expressions for riemann s tensor components as evaluated by an observer which is moving with any velocity relative to schwarzschild s mass 4 a gravitational field of a moving schwarzschild s mass as usual to describe a moving observer we can use the corresponding set of orthogonal tetrads fol lowing many papers where the deeper analogies between gravitation and electromagnetism are under investiga tions we consider the gravitoelectric e i k and gravito magnetic b i k components of the gravitational field for example in 39 these components are determined as e i k r i 4 k 4 21 b i k 1 2 r i 4 m n m n k 22 here our consideration is restricted by the gravitomag netic components only for the observer which is moving relative to schwarzschild s mass the space local vectors can be oriented as 1 the first vector is orthogonal to the plane that is determined by the instantaneous direc tion of the observer motion relative to the schwarzschild mass and the radial direction 2 the second vector is di rected along the direction of the motion of the observer then using the standard schwarzschild coordinates we obtain the nonzero components of the gravitomagnetric field b 1 2 b 2 1 3 mu u r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r 1 2 23 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 mu 2 u 4 r 3 u 4 u 4 1 1 2 m r 1 2 24 where u dr ds and u rd ds are the radial and tangential components of the observer s 4 velocity and m is schwarzschild s mass let us analyze expressions 20 at different velocities of the observer relative to schwarzschild s mass note that the gravitomagnetic components are nonzero only at u 6 0 that is here the situation is similar to the known one in the electrodynamic for the components of the magnetic field of a moving electric charge then it is easy to see that the components 20 significantly depend on the velocity of an observer relative to the schwarzschild mass indeed at u 1 u 1 the common term 3 m r 3 in expressions 20 is multiplied on the corresponding small values whereas in the highly relativistic case for u 1 this term is multiplied by the large as compare to 1 values and then we have b 1 2 b 2 1 3 m r 3 b 1 3 b 3 1 3 m r 3 2 25 where is the relativistic lorentz factor as calculated by the particle velocity relative to the schwarzschild mass b highly relativistic spin orbit acceleration as measured by a comoving observer what physical effects are caused by the gravitomag netic components 23 25 to answer this question let us consider equation 20 which can be written as a i s 1 m r i 4 2 3 26 where a i are the local components of the particle 3 acceleration relative to geodesic free fall as measured by the comoving observer s 1 is the single nonzero compo nent of the particle spin i e here the first local space vector is oriented along the spin in the concrete case of particle motion in schwarzschild s background when the particle s spin is orthogonal to the plane determined by the direction of particle motion and the radial direction by 22 and 26 we have a i s 1 m b 1 i 27 where the nonzero values of b 1 i come from 23 and 24 according to 25 the acceleration components 27 de pend in the case of highly relativistic nonradial motions on such that a 2 a 3 2 the component a 1 remain equal to zero at any velocity the absolute value of the 3 acceleration is proportional to 2 so according to the mp equations from the point of view of the observer comoving with a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background the spin gravity interac tion is much greater at the highly relativistic particle s velocity than at the low velocity this interaction has the clear feature of the spin orbit interaction however it is interesting to estimate the effects of this interaction for another observer e g which is at rest relative to the schwarzschild mass c exact mp equations in schwarzschild s background after using constants of motion due to the symmetry of schwarzschild s and kerr s metric here the mp equations have the constants of mo tion the particle s energy e and the projection of its angular momentum jz 5 40 42 it is known that in the case of the geodesic equations the analogous constants of motion were effectively used for analyzing possible or bits of a spinless particle in these metrics 43 namely by the constants of energy and angular momentum the standard form of the geodesic equations which are the differential equations of the second order by the coordi nates can be reduced to the differential equations of the first order naturally it is interesting to apply the sim ilar procedure to the exact mp equations however in 5 contrast to the geodesic equations the exact mp equa tions at the mathisson pirani condition contain the third derivatives of the coordinates the corresponding explicit form of the mp equations in kerr s background is presented in 21 here we write these equations for schwarzschild s background as in 21 we use the set of the 11 dimensionless quantities yi where by definition y 1 r m y 2 y 3 y 4 t m y 5 u 1 y 6 mu 2 y 7 mu 3 y 8 u 4 y 9 s 1 mm y 10 s 2 mm 2 y 11 s 3 mm 2 28 in addition we introduce the dimensionless quantities connected with the particle s proper time s and the con stants of motion e jz x s m e e m j jz mm 29 some quantities from 28 satisfy the four simple equa tions y 1 y 5 y 2 y 6 y 3 y 7 y 4 y 8 30 here and in the following a dot denotes the usual deriva tive with respect to x other seven equations for the 11 functions yi can be written as y 5 a 1 y 6 a 2 y 7 a 3 y 8 a 4 31 y 9 a 5 y 10 a 6 y 11 a 7 32 where a 1 a y 1 y 2 6 y 1 y 2 7 sin 2 y 2 y 28 y 21 q y 25 y 21 q a 2 b 2 y 1 y 5 y 6 y 2 7 sin y 2 cos y 2 a 3 q 1 y 5 y 10

mp equations in schwarzschild s or kerr s background the condition for a spinning test particle s 0 mr 1 35 must be taken into account 10 d highly relativistic circular equatorial orbits of a spinning particle equations 31 and 32 can be used for description of all possible types of the spinning particle motions in schwarzschild s background according to the mp equa tions under the mathisson pirani condition we begin from considering the important partial solutions which describe the circular orbits of a spinning particle in the equatorial plane 2 of schwarzschild s metric when the spin is orthogonal to this plane then all the mp equations are reduced to the single algebraic equation where among the values yi only y 1 y 7 and y 8 are present 22 y 37 y 1 3 2 y 8 y 21 0 y 27 y 1 3 y 31 y 7 2 y 1 3 0 y 8 y 1 0 36 without any loss in generality this equation is written for the orientation of the particle s spin when s 2 s 0 per relationship u u 1 the value y 8 can be ex pressed through y 7 y 8 1 2 y 1 1 2 1 y 21 y 2 7 37 in the limiting transition to the spinless particle 0 0 we have from 36 the result known from the geodesic equations equation 36 with 37 determine the region of ex istence of the circular orbits and the dependence of the particle s angular velocity which in notation 28 cor respond to y 7 on the radial coordinate naturally it is interesting to compare the situations with the spin less and spinning particle the known result is that by the geodesic equations these orbits are allowed only for r 3 m and the highly relativistic circular orbits exist only for r 3 m 1 where 0 1 in this context we point out that equation 36 admits the highly rela tivistic circular orbit of a spinning particle with r 3 m i e y 1 3 indeed it is easy to calculate the single real root y 7 of equation 36 in the simple analytical form y 7 3 3 4 0 1 o 0 38 here we take into account that by 35 it is necessary 0 1 then the absolute value of the particle orbital 4 velocity which corresponds to 38 in the main spin approximation is equal to 31 4 0 the same value has the relativistic lorentz factor of the spinning particle as calculated by an observer which is at rest relative to schwarzschild s mass hence 2 1 i e for the mo tion on the circular orbit with r 3 m the velocity of a spinning particle must be ultrarelativistic the more ul trarelativistic the smaller is the ratio of spin to mass of the particle it is known that by the geodesic equations a spin less particle with nonzero mass of any velocity close to the velocity of light starting in the tangential direction from the position r 3 m will fall on the horizon sur face within a finite proper time on the other hand a spinning particle can remain indefinitely on the circular orbit with r 3 m due to the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling if condition 38 is satisfied it means that in this concrete situation the spin gravity coupling acts as a strong repulsive force which compensates the usual geodesic attraction by the way from the point of view of an observer comoving with the spinning parti cle the value of this force is the same order as the formally calculated value of the newtonian gravitational force for the masses m and m at distance r 3 m 16 certainly the picture described for the spinning parti cle on the circular orbit with r 3 m holds in the ideal case only when perturbations are neglected some cases 7 with perturbations noncircular motions we shall con sider below we stress the important feature of the partial circular solution of the mp equations with 38 this solution is common for the exact mp equations and their linear spin approximation and as a result both for the mathisson pirani and tulczyjew dixon condition 14 17 let us consider other circular orbits of a spinning par ticle in schwarzschild s background which are described by equation 38 the detailed analysis is presented in 22 and here we show some graphs which illustrate the domain of existence of the highly relativistic circular or bits and the dependence of the factor which is neces sary for realizing these orbits on the radial coordinate figure 1 describes the orbits with the negative values of the particle orbital velocity y 7 0 at s 0 i e the signs of these values are the same as in the case of the highly relativistic circular orbit with y 1 3 and y 7 from 38 in these figures below we put 0 10 2 the orbits corresponding to fig 1 exist in the space region 2 m r 3 m and similarly to the circular orbit with y 1 3 these orbits are caused by the significant repul sive action of the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling however in contrast to the orbit with y 1 3 which is fully determined by the linear spin terms for the orbits in fig 1 the nonlinear terms are important in this context fig 2 shows the difference in the description of the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning par ticle in the small neighborhood of y 1 3 that is when y 1 3 0 1 by the exact mp equations and their linear spin approximation according to the solutions of equation 36 for different y 1 the highly relativistic orbits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background exist for r 3 m as well however in contrast to the orbits from 2 m r 3 m they are caused by the significant attractive action of the spin gravity coupling and for realizing these orbits the sign of the particle orbital velocity must be positive d ds 0 for s 0 figure 3 describes the small space domain where y 1 3 0 1 and fig 4 corresponds to the region for the large values of y 1 there is an essential difference between the upper and lower part of the solid curve in fig 3 namely the last curve is close to the dashed line for 0 00631 and both these curves tend to the geodesic line if is growing whereas the upper part of the solid curve in fig 3 significantly differs from the geodesic line the dependence of the on r m for this case on the interval from 3 02 is presented in fig 4 and for r 3 m the value is proportional to r it means that for the motion on a circular orbit with r 3 m the particle must posses much higher orbital velocity than in the case of the motion on a circular orbit near r 3 m for deeper understanding of physics of the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background let us estimate the values of the particle s energy e on these orbits it is not difficult to calculate the values for e in the case of the circular fig 1 lorentz factor vs r for the highly relativistic circular orbits with d ds 0 of the spinning particle beyond the small neighborhood of r 3 m according to the exact mp equations fig 2 lorentz factor vs for the highly relativistic circular orbits with d ds 0 of the spinning particle in the small neighborhood of r 3 m according to the exact mp equations solid line and their linear spin approximation dashed line fig 3 dependence of the lorentz factor on 0 for the highly relativistic

spinning particle beyond the small neighborhood of r 3 m by the exact mp equations solid line the dotted line corresponds to the geodesic circular orbits orbits in the schwarzschild background as 22 e m 1 2 y 1 y 8 0 y 1 y 1 3 y 37 39 it is easy to check that by 39 the energy of the spin ning particle on the above considered highly relativistic circular orbits is positive and much less than the energy of the spinless particle on the corresponding geodesic cir cular orbits for example the energy of the spinless par ticle on the circular orbits with r 3 m tends to if r 3 m whereas according to 36 the energy of the spinning particle is finite for its circular orbits with any r including r 3 m in the case of the highly relativistic circular orbits of the spinning particle beyond the small neighborhood of 3 m it follows from 39 that e m 0 y 1 1 2 y 1 1 4 1 3 y 1 3 2 1 3 y 1 3 y 21 40 hence by 40 we have e 2 m 2 note that the right hand side of equation 40 is positive for all values y 1 beyond the horizon surface that is in this sense one can draw a conclusion concerning the strong binding en ergy for those orbits which is caused by the interaction of spin with the gravitational field e circular nonequatorial orbits it is not difficult to verify that the mp equations in the standard coordinates of the schwarzschild metric have the partial solution with 14 r const 6 0 const 6

with the constant orbital velocity when the spin lays in the meridional plane when the particle orbits the schwarzschild mass the neces sary particle s velocity for motions on these orbits is de termined by u 3 k 1 4 1 2 m r 1 4 r 6 sin sign s sin 1 o 45 where we note k 1 1 2 m r 1 3 m r 2 cos 2 sin 2 0 46 and is the small value as determined by 35 the dependence of the angle on r is sin 2 1 2 m r m r 4 9 m r 6 1 2 m r 1 3 m r 1 1 o 47 for the nonequatorial circular orbits it is necessary 0 sin 2 1 it follows from 47 that this condition is satisfied if and only if 15 7 m 1 o r 3 m 1 o 48 therefore relationships 45 48 give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the motion of a spinning test particle on the nonequatorial circular orbits in the schwarzschild background according to 48 the space region of existence of these orbits by the radial coordi nate is determined without small correction of the order as 15 7 m r 3 m 49 it follows from 47 that the minimum value of sin 2 is achieved at r 5 5 3 5 1 2 35 m and sin 2 min 0 465 min 43 whereas at r 2 35 m and r 2 5 m we have from 47 the common values sin 2 0 5 and 45 9 we stress that for the realization of the considered nonequatorial circular orbits a spinning particle must posses the highly relativistic velocity in the sense that 2 1 1 concerning the correlation between the direction of the particle orbital motion and its spin orientation we conclude from 45 that for example when sin 0 0 2 the signs of s and u 3 d ds are oppo site the considered circular orbits one can called hov ering because a spinning particle hovers above the schwarzschild mass under the angle hover 2 according to 44 if r is in the small neighborhood of the value 3 m the relationship sr s takes place i e in this case the particle s spin practically lays in the equa torial plane and by 47 hover is close to 0 whereas if r is in the small neighborhood of the value 15 m 7 the relationship s sr is valid i e here the spin is prac tically orthogonal to the equatorial plane and hover is close to 0 then it follows from 45 that if r 15 m 7 the expression for the particle s orbital velocity pass the corresponding expression for the highly relativistic equa torial circular orbit with r 15 m 7 we stress that equations 44 47 were obtained from the exact mp equations under the mathisson pirani sup plementary condition the mp equations in the linear spin approximation have the solutions which describe the nonequatorial highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background as well however these solutions exist only in the small neighbor hood of the radial coordinate r 3 m under the small hovering angle f highly relativistic noncircular orbits while investigating the highly relativistic noncircular orbits of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild back ground it is necessary to integrate the set of the differen tial equations 31 33 note that this system contains the two parameters e and j proportional to the con stants of the particle s motion the energy and angular momentum by choosing different values of these pa rameters for the fixed initial values of yi one can describe the motions of different centers of mass to describe the proper center of mass of a spinning particle in the schwarzschild background the method of separation of the corresponding solutions of the exact mp equations was proposed and realized in explicit relationships for the cases when the initial radial component of the par ticle velocity is much less than the tangential one 18 the corresponding motions are considered and discussed in detailed in 18 22 here we present three typical figures which illustrate some important features of the highly relativistic noncircular nonequatorial motions of a spinning particle in schwarzschild s background more illustrations are in 20 figures 5 and 6 show the situ ations when the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling fig 5 trajectories in the polar coordinates of the spinning solid line and spinless particle dotted line with the same initial values of their 4 velocity components the tangential and radial velocities are equal to 35 and 10 2 correspond ingly the initial value of the radial coordinate is equal to 10 m 0 10 2 causes the significant attractive and repulsive action cor respondingly the circles with the radius 2 in these figures correspond to the horizon line figure 7 illustrates the cases of the nonequatorial mo tions when the particle s spin is not orthogonal to the equatorial plane 2 more exactly this figure de scribes oscillations for different values of the inclination angle of the spin to the equatorial plane due to sr 6 0 with s 0 all graphs in fig 7 are interrupted be yond the domain of validity of the linear spin approxi mation within the time of this approximation validity the period of the oscillations coincides with the period of the particle s revolution by whereas on this in terval the value of the spin component s 1 is const just as the components s 2 s 3 and the coordinate r this situation differs from the corresponding case of the cir cular motions of a spinning particle that are not highly relativistic indeed then the nonzero radial spin com ponent is not const but oscillates with the period of the particle s revolution by besides in the last case the mean level of coincides with 90 whereas in fig 7 the mean values of are above 90 according to this figure the amplitude of the oscillation increases with the in clination angle however 90 is small even for the inclination angle that is equal to 90 g a restriction on using the tulczyjew dixon condition now we consider some interesting situation which arise when the highly relativistic solutions of the mp equations under the tulczyjew dixon condition are studied 21 let us write the main relationships following from the mp equations at tulczyjew dixon condition the mass of a spinning particle is defined as p p 50 10 fig 6

the quantity v is the normalized momentum where by definition v p 51 as the normalized quantities u and v satisfy the rela tionships u u 1 v v 1 52 there is the important relationship between u and v

condition we write s 14 p 3 p 4 s 13 s 24 0 s 34 p 1 p 4 s 13 57 using corresponding expressions for the riemann tensor in the schwarzschild metric from 53 we obtain u 1 nv 1 1 3 m r 3 v 3 v 3 s 2 0 2

for n we obtain directly from the condition u u 1 in the form n 1 2 m r 2 3 v 3 v 3 2 m r 2 2 m r 1 2 62 11 inserting 62 into 60 we obtain the expression for the components v through u v 2 u 2 0 v 1 u

spinning particle the values v 1 v 3 v 4 become imaginary indeed if u 3 1 6 mr 65 in 64 we have the square root of the negative value as writing 65 we neglect the small terms of order 2 all equations in this section before 65 are strict in using the notation for the particle s tangential velocity u ru 3 by 65 we write u r 6 m 66 if r is not much greater than m the velocity value of the right hand side of equation 66 corresponds to the particle s highly relativistic lorentz factor of order 1 this fact that according to 51 63 66 the expres sions for the components of 4 momentum p become imaginary if in 50 is real is an evidence that the tulczyjew dixon condition cannot be used for the parti cle s velocity which is very close to the velocity of light in this context it is clear the sense of a result of recent paper 44 concerning some solutions of the mp equations at the tulczyjew dixon condition which allow accelera tion of a spinning particle to the superluminal velocity in schwarzschild s background this result is connected with the situation when relationship 66 takes place i e when the tulczyjew dixon condition cannot be applied under the mathisson pirani condition the corresponding result is not allowed by the mp equations iv highly relativistic solutions of mp equations in kerr s background some solutions of the mp equations under the mathisson pirani condition in kerr s background which fig 8 dependence of the lorentz factor on r for the highly relativistic equatorial circular orbits with d ds 0 of the spinning particle in kerr s background at a 0 0145 m 0 10 2 and s 0 solid lines the dotted line corresponds to the geodesic circular orbits here we use the notation r for r ph and r for r ph describe highly relativistic motions of a spinning parti cle posses the feature common with the case of the cor responding motions in schwarzschild s background both for a m and a m here a and m are the rotation parameter and the mass of the kerr metric source we put a 0 for example far from the horizon surface when r rg the highly relativistic equatorial circular orbits of a spinning particle in kerr s background are allowed practically with the same dependence of the factor on r as in fig 4 for the schwarzschild background 23 in 23 the boyer lindquist coordinates are used in this context we note that for growing values r the spin orbit and spin spin interactions decrease as 1 r 3 and 1 r 4 cor respondingly therefore for r rg the influence of the spin orbit action on a particle is prevailing other sit uations arise when a particle is not far from rg for example fig 8 illustrates a case of the circular orbits in the narrow space domain near r ph and r ph these values are the radial coordinates of the co and counter rotation photon circular orbits correspondingly at the small value of the parameter a in contrast to fig 3 for a 0 in fig 8 there is the upper graph which arise just due to a 6 0 i e when spin spin action is nonzero many other figures for different correlation of the signs a d ds and s are presented in 23 similarly to the case of schwarzschild s background the mp equations have the highly relativistic nonequa torial circular orbits in kerr s background as well 14 the space domain of these orbits existence increase with the increasing parameter a if a m this domain is determined by 1 89 m r 4 m the maximum value of the hovering angle 2 is achieved at a m and is equal to 63 in contrast to 47 at a 0 some graphs which describe nonequatorial motions in particular the oscillations in kerr s background when its spin is not orthogonal to the equatorial plane are pre sented in 23 12 v numerical estimates do some particles in cosmic rays posses the sufficiently high factor for motions on the highly relativistic circu lar orbits or on some their fragments in the gravitational field of the schwarzschild or kerr black hole which are considered above yes they do by the numerical esti mates for an electron in the gravitational field of a black hole with three of the sun s mass the value 0 is equal 4 10 17 then the necessary value of the factor for the realization of some highly relativistic circular orbits by the electron near this black hole is of order 108 this factor corresponds to the energy of the electron free motion of order 1014 ev analogously for a proton in the field of such a black hole the corresponding energy is of order 1018 ev for the massive black hole those val ues are greater for example if m is equal to 106 of the sun s mass the corresponding value of the energy for an electron is of order 1017 ev and for a proton it is 1021 ev naturally far from the black hole these values are greater because the necessary factor is proportional to r note that for a neutrino near the black hole with three of the sun s mass the necessary values of its factor for motions on the highly relativistic circular orbits corre spond to the neutrino s energy of the free motion of or der 105 ev if the black hole s mass is of order 106 of the sun s mass the corresponding value is of order 108 ev can the highly relativistic spin gravity effects be reg istered by the observation of the electromagnetic syn chrotron radiation from some black holes perhaps how ever it is difficult to differ the situation when the circular orbits of a spinning charged particle and its synchrotron radiation are caused by the magnetic field or the spin gravity coupling the detailed analysis of the observa tional data is necessary vi on correspondence between the dirac and mp equations here we point out a question which arise after the com parison of the mp equations with the general relativis tic dirac equation as we note in the introduction the first equations follow from the second equation in some classical approximation however this result has been obtained in the linear spin approximation only when ex pression 3 for the fermi transported spin practically co incides with the corresponding expression for the parallel transport note that the general relativistic dirac equa tion was obtained for eight years before the mp equations and therefore the fermi transport was not discussed in the context of possible description of a quantum spinning particle in the gravitational field at the same time if one want to satisfy the principle of correspondence between an equation for a quantum spinning particle and the mp equations now it is necessary to take into account the known fact that according to the mp equations the spin of a test particle is transported by fermi however in common sense the notation fermi transported spinor cannot be introduced without violation of the lorentz invariance in this context it is interesting that for last years the possibility of the lorentz invariance violation is discussed in the literature from different points of view in any case with violation of the lorentz invariance or not it is necessary to propose a more exact equations for fermions in gravitational field than the usual general rela tivistic dirac equation probably this corrected equation must be nonlinear in the function 45 vii conclusions 1 the mp equations are an important source in the certain sense even the unique source of information on highly relativistic motions of spinning particles in the gravitational field 2 different solutions of the mp equations in schwarzschild s and kerr s background show clearly that the highly relativistic spin gravity coupling can change significantly the trajectory of a spinning particle as com pare to the corresponding geodesic trajectory of a spinless particle in particular the highly relativistic spin orbit interaction reveals the strong repulsive action on a spin ning particle 3 in the highly relativistic regime of the spinning par ticle motions in the gravitational field the adequate sup plementary condition for the mp equations is just the mathisson pirani condition 4 by the numerical estimates some particles in cosmic rays posses a sufficiently high factor for motions on the significantly nongeodesic orbits near schwarzschild s or kerr s black holes 5 the mp equations can be useful for searching ade quate corrections in the known general relativistic dirac equation with the aim to investigate the highly relativis tic spin gravity coupling on the quantum level 1 m
