about de sitter space leading up to a discussion of penrose s quasi local mass construction for linear gravity theory in the de sitter background the corresponding results for minkowski space and anti de sitter space are familiar and can be found in 1 or 2 for the former and 3 for the latter some of the formulas given here are also quite familiar but some are thought to be new and it is convenient to have these facts collected in one place 1 the metric of de sitter space 1 the simplest definition of 4 dimensional de sitter space is as the hyperboloid u 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 w 2 h 2 1 for h 0 in the 5 dimensional minkowski space with metric ds 2 du 2 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 dw 2 in this form it is clear that the isometry group is the pseudo orthogonal group o 1 5 2 the whole manifold can be covered by the coordinatisation u h 1 sinhht x h 1 coshht sin r sin cos y h 1 coshht sin r sin sin z h 1 coshht sin r cos w h 1 coshht cos r when the metric is g dt 2 h 2 cosh 2 ht dr 2 sin 2 r d 2 sin 2 d 2 2 as is well known and will be shown below the weyl tensor of this metric is zero and the ricci tensor is proportional to the metric with conventions as in 1 we have rabcd h 2 gacgbd gadgbc rab 3 h 2 gab so that the ricci scalar is r 12 h 2 and the cosmological constant is 3 h 2 3 it will be convenient to write the metric 2 in the form ds 2 dt 2 h 2 cosh 2 hthijdxidxj 3 and then hij is the metric on the unit s 3 in flat r 4 this metric is einstein with scalar curvature sh 6 1 http arxiv org abs 1505 06123 v 1 4 to add the conformal infinity of de sitter space as a boundary first introduce conformal time by d sech htdt so that w l o g coshht csch sinhht coth now the range t in proper time is 0 h in conformal time and the conformal boundary is at 0 in the past call this i and h in the future or i 5 to add the conformal boundary in a more geometrical way recall the definition of com pactified minkowski space as the projective o 2 4 null cone equivalently as the space of generators of the o 2 4 null cone v 2 u 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 w 2 0 4 when the metric is ds 2 dv 2 du 2 dx 2 dy 2 dz 2 dw 2 evidently the hyperboloid 1 is the slice v h 1 of the null cone 4 in a similar fashion minkowski space is realised as the slice v w 1 and anti de sitter space as the universal cover of the slice w h 1 the slice v h 1 misses those generators of the null cone 4 with v 0 and these constitute two copies of s 3 with u 0 and u 0 respectively these are i and i respectively 6 we may find the killing vectors of de sitter space by decomposing an arbitrary killing vector as k a t b i i then the killing vector equation can readily be solved to find k f xi t h tanhhth ijf i j x i xj i 5 where hij is as in 3 x i i is a killing vector for hij and f is a conformal scalar for hij by which we mean didjf fhij 6 where di is the levi civita derivative for hij the space of such f is 4 dimensional since they are induced by linear functions of the cartesian coordinates in the ambient flat r 4 and the space of such xi is 6 dimensional giving the 10 dimensional space of killing vectors for de sitter space by inspection though it is a general result any killing vector k extends to i and there it reduces to hijf i j x i xj i and is a conformal killing vector of hij we shall consider the conformal killing vectors of de sitter space in section 3 below 2 2 twistors in de sitter space 1 in de sitter space the four dimensional twistor equations are aa b i ab a aa b i a b a 7 where r 24 h 2 2 is the curvature scalar in newman penrose conventions these are integrable in the sense of having a 4 complex dimensional vector space of solutions the twistor space t as is conventional we write the elements of t as twistors x y z where each element corresponds to a pair of spinor fields a a 2 as with minkowski space the conformal group acts on t in that the lie derivative along any conformal killing vector of spinor fields a x a x satisfying 7 also satisfies 7 3 from 7 we see that z z defined for two linearly independent twistors z z with corresponding spinor fields a a a a by a a a a 8 is constant as a scalar field and so defines a pseudo hermitian form on t which we may write as z z it is a standard piece of twistor theory that this form has signature and so in particular it is nondegenerate and therefore invertible write the inverse as this hermitian form is conventionally used to eliminate primed twistor indices so that for example y w are written in terms of y y w w with this usage complex conjugation is viewed as a map to the dual of t rather than to the complex conjugate of t z z z z 4 there is also a canonical 4 form on t which can be defined on a choice of four twistors z 1 z 4 by choosing a normalised spinor dyad and its complex conjugate and forming the determinant whose rows are the four functions 0 1 0 1 which are components in the dyads for each twistor this determinant is constant as a scalar field by 7 and so determines a 4 form as det z 1 z 4 both and are conformally invariant and the endomorphisms of t preserving and make up the group su 2 2 5 one more canonical structure is given on t in de sitter spacee this is the anti linear map n a a a a which can be seen to map solutions of 7 to solutions it can be written as a map on t as z z n z 9 there will be an adjoint n and then it can be seen that n n 10 n n 11 n n 12 6 motivated by the last of these we can introduce i n i which is the infinity twistor for de sitter space in coordinates with z a a we have i diag ab a b the subgroup of su 2 2 preserving the infinity twistor will be a finite cover of the de sitter group 3 the infinity twistor satisfies various identities including 1 2 i i i i the overbar on i is therefore redundant and can be omitted 3 killing and conformal killing vectors in de sitter space 1 killing and conformal killing vectors can be constructed from twistors as follows sup pose that z z are two linearly independent twistors with corresponding spinor fields a a a a and define vector fields ka a a a a la a a a a k a a a a a l a a a a a then by virtue of 7 ka and k a are killing vectors and la and l a are conformal killing vectors note that ka and la are complex in general that k a and l a are real and that k a is space like and l a is time like and future pointing we claim that la and l a are also gradients to see this introduce a a a a 13 and calculate a 2 i la 14 so that la is indeed a gradient while with i a a a a 15 which is real calculate a 2 l a 16 and so l a is also a gradient 2 we noted above that l a is a conformal killing vector which is time like and future pointing for future use we note that in de sitter space there are no killing vectors which are everywhere time like and future pointing one way to see this is to recall that killing vectors for which we have found explicit expressions extend to i and are then tangent to i since i is space like the killing vectors must be space like or zero at i and so cannot be time like throughout a neighbourhood of i another way is to consider a general killing vector xa at a surface of constant t in the metric 2 if s is a 2 surface on bounding a ball b on then we have the identity s axbdsab b xad a 6 b xan ad where na is the unit normal time like and future pointing c c and we use the killing vector identity xa 6 xa as b expands to sweep out we arrive at xan ad 0 which shows that xa cannot be time like and future pointing everywhere on 4 3 we can go further with 14 and calculate a b 2 i alb 2 gab making use of 7 as in section 1 6 we call any solution of a b 2 gab 17 a conformal scalar then from 13 is a complex conformal scalar and from 15 is a real one it is a familiar fact that given an umbilic surface in flat space linear functions of the cartesian coordinates on the ambient flat space restrict to conformal scalars on the surface in the induced metric thus here linear functions in u x y z w define conformal scalars and so there is a 5 dimensional vector space of them 4 it may be less familiar but is easy to see that the 15 dimensional vector space of conformal killing vectors can be expressed as a sum of a 10 dimensional vector space of killing vectors and a 5 dimensional vector space of gradient conformal killing vectors to see this suppose xa is any conformal killing vector so that axb mab qgab for some q and mab with mab mba commute derivatives on xa and rearrange to find cmab qa 2 xa gbc qb 2 xb gac where qa aq commute derivatives on mbc to find a bq 2 qgab so that q is a conformal scalar now it is apparent that ka xa qa 2 is a killing vector so that xa has been written as a sum of a killing vector and a gradient conformal killing vector 5 to obtain the whole 5 dimensional space of conformal scalars note that z z in 13 regarded as a function on t is antisymmetric there is a 6 dimensional vector space of antisymmetric 2 tensors on t which can be written q q however the particular antisymmetric combination i z z a a a a gives a constant on space time now the 5 dimensional vector space of q modulo i gives the conformal scalars these can be characterised as trace free q in the sense that q i 0 the real conformal scalars like in 15 are now of the form q z i z provided q i i q there is a 5 real dimensional vector space of trace free such q 6 the gradient conformal killing vectors have an interesting form at i set h 1 and take the conformal scalar to be induced by the linear expression u x y z w 5 so that in the coordinates of section 1 sinh t cosh t sin r sin cos sin r sin sin sin r cos cos r then la a g ab a b sech t t sech 2 t hij xi xj when the spatial part of the de sitter metric 2 is cosh 2 t hij at i this reduces to la a n r 18 with n sin r sin cos sin r sin sin sin r cos cos r thus l extends to i in the rescaled metric and is a function n times the unit normal to i where n is a constant plus a conformal scalar for the standard s 3 metric on i in particular the gradient conformal killing vectors are all time like at i except where they vanish 7 symmetrised products of the form ab a b define killing spinors since a a bc a a b c 0 by 7 and this is the defining property of a killing spinor in fact aa bc i a bkc a 19 with ka as in subsection 3 1 above 4 explicit formulas if desired it is possible to obtain explicit expressions for the solutions of 7 1 for simplicity set h 1 in 1 and use the np formalism with the tetrad d 1 2 t sech t r 1 2 t sech t r sech t 2 sin r i sin this tetrad has spin coefficients as follows 0 i ij 1 2 2 tanh t 1 2 2 cot cosh t sin r 1 2 tanh t cot rsech t 1 2 tanh t cot rsech t and the only nonzero curvature component is 1 2 the ricci tensor is rab 3 gab the ricci scalar is r 12 and the cosmological constant is 3 we can restore h as a parameter in the metric and then r 24 h 2 2 6 this confirms the expression for the riemann tensor in section 1 2 6 2 now take components of 7 in the implied spinor dyad the equations separate and the angular parts are solved in terms of the lowest spin weighted spherical harmonics the radial time dependence is simpler in terms of advanced and retarded null coordinates u r v r the solutions can be given in terms of four complex parameters a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 which are coordinates on t by 0 cosh t 1 2 0 1 cosh t 1 2 1 0 i 2 cosh t 1 2 p 0 1 i 2 cosh t 1 2 p 1 with 0 sin 2 ei 2 a 1 cos v 2 a 2 sin v 2 cos 2 e i 2 b 1 cos v 2 b 2 sin v 2 1 cos 2 ei 2 a 1 cos u 2 a 2 sin u 2 sin 2 e i 2 b 1 cos u 2 b 2 sin u 2 p 0 sin 2 ei 2 a 1 cos u 2 a 2 sin u 2 cos 2 e i 2 b 1 cos u 2 b 2 sin u 2 p 1 cos 2 ei 2 a 1 cos v 2 a 2 sin v 2 sin 2 e i 2 b 1 cos v 2 b 2 sin v 2 note that all components of a a blow up on approach to i and at the same rate 5 conserved quantities killing and conformal killing vectors allow the definition of conserved currents 1 given a conserved energy momentum tensor tab as a field on de sitter space one can make conserved currents ja tabk b with any killing vector ka and also if tab is trace free as ja tabl b with any conformal killing vector la now given any space like two surface s spanned by a space like 3 surface one may associate charges with s by integrating over q s k tabk bd a 20 and there are similar charges made with la in the trace free case 2 in the case when s approaches or even lies on i convergence of these charges will require fall off conditions on tab simple power counting suggests that finiteness for k a requires that coshht 3 tab be bounded as t while for la one needs coshht 4 tab bounded 7 6 linear theory in de sitter space penrose s quasi local mass construction 1 is motivated by using twistor theory to convert the 3 surface integrals for conserved charges 20 to 2 surface integrals over when the conserved energy momentum tensor tab is the source of a linearised gravitational field to write out this construction we need to review the linearisation of general relativity about de sitter space 1 suppose we perturb the de sitter metric gab gab gab and write hab gab we raise and lower indices with the de sitter metric and then the perturbation of the contravariant metric is gab hab and the perturbation in the christoffel symbols is abc 1 2 bhac ch a b ahbc 21 as is entirely familiar the gauge freedom in hab is hab hab axb bxa for any suitably differentiable vector field and this freedom can be used to impose the gauge condition qb a hab 1 2 hgab 0 22 where h habg ab by solving xa 3 h 2 xa qa 0 2 the perturbation in the riemann tensor requires care as the background riemann tensor is not zero so that the position of indices is significant the variation in r dabc is r dabc a c h d b a dhb c h 2 h d agb c hc a d b we can take the trace of this to obtain rab 1 2 hab h 2 4 hab hgab with the aid of 22 so that also r gabrab 1 2 h 3 h 2 h 23 and then g ba g bcrac 1 2 rgba 1 2 h ba 1 2 h ba h 2 h ba 1 2 h ba now given a symmetric divergence free tensor tab the linearised einstein field equations are g ba t b a 24 8 with 8 g c 2 and one checks that both sides are divergence free as is necessary for consistency we shall want to consider the trace free ricci tensor sab rab 14 rgab unperturbed this is zero and the variation is found to be sab 1 2 hab 1 4 hgab h 2 hab 1 4 hgab 25 it is convenient to introduce the tensor tabcd rabcd gder e abc so that tabcd a c hb d a d hb c 1 2 h 2 gachbd gbchad gbdhac gadhbc 26 which is easily seen to have riemann tensor symmetries tabcd tbacd tabdc t abc d 0 it can be decomposed into irreducible pieces as tabcd cabcd 1 2 gac sbd gbd sac gab scd gcd sab 1 12 r gacgbd gbcgad h 2 gachbd gbdhac gbchad gadhbc where cabcd is the variation in the weyl tensor sab is as in 25 and r is as in 23 we introduce spinor equivalents cabcd abcd a b c d h c sab 2 aba b where h c stands for hermition conjugate we choose not to include on the right in these definitions since the corresponding weyl and ricci spinors are zero in the background in terms of these spinor fields the bianchi identities take the usual form da abcd b a bc a b 27 bb aba b 1 8 aa r 3 given the perturbations in curvature and a choice of two twistors a b we construct the two form fab i abcd c d a b i a b cd c d ab i 12 r a b a b 28 and then calculate bfab 2 tabk b here we use the linearised einstein equation 24 the bianchi identities 27 and 19 thus 2 fab is a potential for the conserved current in 20 which is the key observation underlying penrose s quasi local mass construction 1 9 we can write a z z 2 fabd ab tabk bd a 29 where z z are the elements of t corresponding to a b respectively is the 2 surface bounding and d ab is the normal 2 form to this formula serves to define the angular momentum twistor a for 4 from the definition a is symmetric it also has a hermiticity property a i i a since if one uses z i z then the killing vector in 29 becomes k a from section 3 which is real 5 when the construction is carried through for linear theory in minkowski space or in anti de sitter space one can also show positivity of a in that a i z z 0 provided the source tab satisfies the dominant energy condition dec however for linear theory in de sitter space one does not have this positivity for a reason already discussed there are no everywhere time like killing vectors 1 acknowledgement this article arose from a desire to provide basic background material for 5 and i am grate ful to laszlo szabados
